"I dunno. Check these cabinets or...ask Jarvis or something," Hawkeye said, looking around. Loki yanked on his straps, alarmed when they didn’t give.
It made a strange old radio sound as Clint waved it over the ground experimentally. Hopefully those got louder when it passed above something metal.
“Peter, if this boyfriend of yours doesn’t want to be public with how he feels about you, I’m not sure he’s a good person. You’re a good person. He’s lucky to have you at all.”
It didn't exactly send a "no we're not dating" message, but Peter patted the guy's back anyway. Wade was in the crosshairs because Peter had overprotective hero...mentor...parental unit...friends? Well, friends was definitely the wrong word.
Wandering around the beach with Bruce felt surreal, and if Clint thought about it for too long, he could easily convince himself that it was all some strange dream he’d cooked up while laying around in the medical ward in a coma or something. One of THOSE stories.
The place looked like a haunted house, weak light falling in through the windows. The lightning flashed and lit the room occasionally, too. Hulk placed Loki carefully onto the couch and shook a finger at him.
“W-we got kind of lost hiking,” he explained quickly, taking one of Matt’s arms and leading him back toward the campfire. “Sorry I’m all wet—we fell in the lake, too. And got rained on. And went through a cave. Wade knew a shortcut.” He glanced back over his shoulder to smile at Wade, carefully avoiding looking at Cap in the process. Arriving at the campfire with Matt, he asked, “Is Hawkeye okay, Tony? His stitches have been bleeding all over the place.”
“Thor, wait,” he said, cringing even as he tried to phrase the next part in his head. What exactly was he supposed to say here? ‘Your summer fling is actually your super villain stepbrother’? Yeah, that would go over really well. What if he didn’t believe them?
“It’s fine!” Clint groaned.
"Why? Because Bruce is a lot easier to control than the Hulk, so if somebody wanted to capture him, they'd need him to be Bruce," Tony said. He crossed his arms, looking at the scientist's door. "What I don't understand is why he didn't just leave with him when they headed out last night."
"At this point I'd be happy if they didn't kill you," Peter whispered back, shaking his head. "You don't get it--they're acting exactly how they did when they thought this lady earlier was hitting on me. They must think you're my boyfriend."
“If so, he must be bleeding a great deal. Worrisome. When I sighted Banner, I thought it best to return him to camp and speak with you and Stark rather than continuing to fly in circles. If you like, I could fly you up to the trail to search as well,” he offered.
“Oh, OH NO. We are way past that! If Matt got to get all smoochy with you in front of them, so do I!”
"A-appreciate it."
"It says Stark, Spidey! Why in the hell would it say 'steak?'" Deadpool snorted, waving his arms as he spoke.
"Hey—Jarvis was scanning you, you know." Tony turned and rested a hand on Steve's shoulder like he might tip over without some kind of support, examining his face. "Doom's political, I can't escape hearing about him at all of those stuffy parties."
"You don't know?" Steve asked. He was a little shocked, but then again, it wasn't like his friend had slept recently either.
“HEY!” Loki snapped, batting his hand away.
“OH MY GOD! YOU MADE IT! YOU’RE ALRIGHT!”
“Wanna do the honors?”
Johnny hopped up and headed to check on Peter, pulling a few wrinkled dollars out of his pocket.
True to his word, Tony didn't toss them into a cold prison cell or anything. Instead, the two Clints got to share the one cell that had a room around it—the big clear container usually reserved for containing the Hulk. Bruce wasn't fond of the thing, but took a seat outside of it since he'd promised himself not to let his Clint—the one with the wristband—out of his sight.
"I, ah, I might've gotten stabbed in the hand. It's nothing," he said quietly. "Hawkeye left to find you—did you see him?"
“Cap, if Hawkeye grumbling about something was the criteria for it being a bad idea, everything would be a bad idea.” He shrugged and adjusted the shoulders of his backpack. “It’ll be a lot more relaxing once we’re there.” For the rest of team, anyway. He and Steve didn’t just have relaxation in the cards for this weekend getaway. In fact, the rest of the team didn’t know it yet, but the whole point of this vacation was to give the Avengers co-leaders a chance to break some very important news to each Avenger one-on-one.
“I don’t give a damn about the view. If you’re really just here to camp, prove it by staying the hell away from us,” Cap told him shortly, keeping a hand at Tony’s back.
"Let's find a phone. Anybody who has a problem with tons of anchovies and pineapple, speak up now!"
"So, instead of taking on the Fantastic Four like usual, you decide that it'd be better to take on the Avengers? There's twice as many of us." He tried to get at least one hand loosened up while Doom's back was turned.
Thanks for checking out our fic! We're Marvel fans from years back who just became active in the fandom again (after binge watching Earth's Mightiest Heroes again and binge reading a whole bunch of Marvel comics.) We've co-written lots of chapter fics, and wrote a great deal of Marvel fic back in the day, but didn't publish much of it (editing 500k is a big undertaking!) Therefore, this is our first POSTED Marvel co-written story.
Whatever reaction Tony had expected Steve to have to those words, it wasn’t what happened.
Steve walked faster again.
If only Steve could have an hour alone with Tony and take him out for a nice boat ride. Maybe they could still do that when they were looking for the alleged lake monster later.
Alone? That probably wasn't the best choice...
"I dunno Thor, you know what they say about babies born out of wedlock." Clint leaned over to stare at Thor face to face. "They have no souls."
"I know because he kissed me. The real Hawkeye wouldn't even want to, so..." He gritted his teeth and quickly turned his back on the door, balling his fists. “Forget it."
"Then DOOM shall hear you." He started down the hallway with Clint in tow.
Tony took the spatula back grumpily. Of course Steve noticed the sauce was boiling and needed stirring. He was so good at focusing on whatever distraction--WORK was at hand, instead of thinking about their ongoing tangled mess of a relationship. Relationship? Friendship? No word really fit right now. What were they to each other, anyway? "Teammates" sure didn't cut it.
"He...that is odd," Bruce agreed, a bit taken aback. "Usually he only mentions me to call me puny or something."
Fleeing the kitchen wasn't exactly a proud choice, but it was the right one right now. He couldn't play unaffected by Steve in front of everybody until he took a minute to slap some armor back on. Figuratively.
Paling a shade, Steve swam up close, shaking his head.
Doom had been surprisingly civil, for a super villian who abducted his team and locked them in a dungeon for no apparent reason. Well, for an Arc reactor, but that seemed dense for somebody like Doom. There had to be easier ways to get ransom...unless. Hmm. Maybe Doom knew how fond Tony was of Steve.
“Sorry,” Matt said sincerely. “I met Peter at work. I was researching a court case and he helped me find some old newspapers. We got coffee and things went from there.”
Clint chuckled to himself, imagining Loki trying to get the jump on the Hulk. It’s probably be the last thing he did. Pushing on the first aid kit, he frowned as he realized that he wasn’t on top of his big green buddy anymore. He was on the rock itself.
“Hey, sorry to bother you,” Peter began, stepping inside quickly and tugging Matt along with him. Standing there dripping all over the entryway to the cabin, he instantly felt awkward. It sure looked like the King of Wakanda had been enjoying a leisurely day on vacation, the way a normal person would instead of spending it matchmaking your super-powered parental units…
Clint stared up at him, wet hair blowing back as he thought to use the light from the strike to look for Bruce. He turned away, looking off into the woods.
Slapping his hand into Cap’s, Wade pumped it heartily.
Peter was with TWO men? They were so drastically different, too! A kindly blind lawyer and a loud mouthed killer?
“I’m fine, Tony. You first.” Cap stepped aside, resting a hand on top of the kayak and waving for the dark-haired man to climb under it.
"N-no thank you," Cap wheezed, leaning back against the wall. If Doom really wanted to do the awful things that he did to Clint, he'd have to do them on the cold dungeon floor. Who knew? Maybe that was his thing, Steve thought with a cringe.
Bruce wasn't sure how to reply to that kind of bluntness. WHY Clint was even interested in him was something that was just beyond his tired mind right now, and he decided it was better not to try to figure it out. Maybe tomorrow when they were both rested, they would laugh and think this whole night had been some kind of delirium or something.
Tony mustered up the best smartass grin he could in response—and him being Tony Stark, it would have been a pretty good one even if he had actually been on his deathbed.
Cap had stepped away from Clint and glanced Tony’s way too.
"Of course not...that'd be too easy," Tony said drolly.
"Mr. Stark designed this containment cell for the Hulk, sir," Jarvis said drolly. "After the Hulk retreats, Dr. Banner is always in need of new clothing."
“Does that sentence worry you?” Tony asked Cap dubiously, his tone clearly saying that it worried HIM. What exactly did Thor and Bruce have to hide from the rest of the team?
"Let's see. Big rage monster in small dark room. Hm," Loki hummed. "Anyway, I wasn't running from him. I was worried about Thor." Loki looked around. "Where is he?"
"What? NO! See?! See?!" Deadpool waved his arms above his head, throwing the lighter. "I do the good thing and ask his parents but that...that...that scoundrel steals him away! WHhhhhyyyyyy?!" He wailed, grabbing at Tony's shirt pathetically.
“Or two,” Cap added. Not because he wanted Matt to stay longer, but just because he needed to have a few words with him before he left.
"It's also not like his technology to go out from a storm," Bruce pointed out, turning to the big blonde man. "Somebody's up to no good. They probably led Tony away so he wouldn't be able to bail us out of whatever this is."
Leaning in to whisper put him just inches from Tony's face, something that he didn't realize until the other man actually leaned in even closer. About an inch from touching noses, Tony glanced sidelong at the door and started whispering back.
The teenager sat on the rooftop cross-legged, pulling off his mask. It was still dim out, and up on a rooftop there was nobody to see, anyway.
Then the huge blond turned to the Clint remaining seated beside him, Loki in truth, frowning.
"Master Stark is working, and told me to tell you he isn't here," Jarvis answered in his usual droll way.
Clint's eyebrows lowered as he scowled at it.
“Wow. I love your attention to detail. You must be used to working with your hands,” she purred down to Cap, who averted his eyes from her legs up to her face.
Amora climbed from the rubble woozily.
“I feel the exact same way,” Bruce murmured, leaning in for a second soft kiss. He smiled in the middle of it, though, and sat back with a soft laugh. “Right…can’t sleep all week.”
Maybe Doom had already gotten him? Would it seem weird for Cap to call him again? It was worth the risk. "Can I h-have your card, Clint?" He held a hand up to the SHIELD agent.
"Not with that attitude," he mumbled. He was positive that there was more going on with these two. Cap seemed sad that they 'would never be' a couple, and Tony had completely avoided even showing a reaction when he'd heard 'we certainly aren't an item', sooo...what was their deal?
"Good luck." Steve couldn’t help worrying for her. It felt like the whole team had been spread out across the city. He could count maybe once in the last four days that he had seen the entire team together.
Bruce brought a hand up to rub the back of his neck, glancing out at the ocean too.
"Whoa, whoa, wait. Is Peter dating this guy, or Spider-Man? SHIELD would only know Spider-Man, and we've got to know which of his lives to poke around in!" He knew for a fact that SHIELD didn't know who Peter was. He'd hacked their database a time or two, and checked on their Spidey files every time just in case they got too close to the truth, but they never had. Probably because SHIELD didn't seem to think Spider-Man was that big-time of a hero, even though he frequently spent time with the Avengers.
“Why do you think Thor’s gay?”
Smooth subject change, Pete, he thought sarcastically. It wasn't like he'd TIMED the stomach growling, though...
"He talked about Bruce having freckles 'all over'," he continued mildly to Cap, turning to him. "And he asked ME to tell you, because he said if he did it, you weren't gonna take it well. I don't suppose you just went in there and did--what did Clint call it? The 'endangering the team' speech?"
This dungeon was almost too theatrical to be real. Tony kept expecting a film crew to be hiding somewhere, or a stage hand to hurriedly conceal the boom mic as he walked past each cell. A few paces ahead, Doctor Doom strode along with his green cloak flowing out behind him like some kind of robo-vampire.
Cap came over to Clint, taking his elbow and lifting his arm. Immediately, he frowned right at the blond.
"Hey Bruce?"
"Did Banner not feed you?" Thor sat up, looking somewhat alarmed.
Oh wow, Steve thought, feeling his face warm up. Why was everyone flirting with him? Was it because of the wet swim trucks or something?
Seated beside him, Wade shivered, big arms hugging himself tightly. He seemed like he was really into the story, too.
Tony lingered in the doorway.
“Hey, I need backup! Pete’s totally kicking my ass!” Wade shouted, sliding to a stop in a puff of sand right in front of Tony. He jabbed a finger at the billionaire. “How ‘bout it, pops? Uh, other pops?” The blond added, looking at Cap hopefully.
Cap looked at Tony.
"Where's that punk, bub?" Wolverine snarled, extending his claws. He shook Spider-Man by the shirt front. "Where the hell is my bike?"
Pepper gave him the oddest, most blank stare for a moment.
“Baby, let’s tie him to a tree with a note and go! We’re never gonna find the treasure at this rate!”
Lifting his left arm up, Clint groaned. The back of his arm was smeared with blood, as was the side of his shirt.
"No, I don't think so," Tony said dubiously. "But I'm gonna go in there with you. Carol, keep an eye on the shield—and let me through, pretty please?" He gave the blonde a thumbs up. She couldn't see his grin, but heard it in his voice.
“Anyone see where Bruce wound up?” The archer asked, scowling at everyone.
As for Tony, well, the man was a notorious playboy. While he liked to tease and flirt with everyone, Cap had noticed that Tony was more interested in his inventions than in relationships. If Tony was interested in any woman, it should be Pepper Potts, in Cap’s opinion. Tony would have been dead or poor a hundred times over if it wasn’t for that woman.
“…Wentworth does come back. Correct?”
"You ever think that maybe we could work on that?" Loki asked, adding a dash of hope in his voice. "Meditation or something. I mean, I'm really lousy at it, but I'd try. For you." Maybe they could meditate near a nuclear reactor.
The cave was natural and looked like it had been smoothed by the flow of water. Clint guessed that in the rainy seasons, it probably worked as a natural drainage pipe down to the lake.
“Tony?” Steve’s concerned voice called to him from the beach. The big blond was already wading out to him, all frowny faced. “You shouldn’t swim when you’re drunk. You could drown.”
Ducking back out into the storm, Clint barely had one foot out of the door when he ran into someone.
Peter caught the frisbee easily, and in a matter of seconds it was clobbering Wade in the side of the head since he was looking over at Cap.
Sheepishly, he glanced over at Clint as they arrived where Wade had led them—a rocky wall with a cave mouth in the side. “Sorry to drag you into all this dating stuff, Hawkeye. I know you’d probably rather be taking a nap somewhere.”
"You didn't even need to ask," Tony replied, stepping over to drape one of Steve's arms over his shoulders. "It must be weird actually getting tired like us mere mortals, right?"
"Heed his words, friends. You appear to have been harmed enough as it is." He was eyeing Clint's bandaged side and Bruce's wrapped hand as he said it.
"Sounds good to me."
Bruce didn't reply for a long moment. Perhaps he was listening to the Hulk commenting on the situation at hand, as he was growing more awkward and shy by the moment.
“Well hey, the cabin’s where we’re headed, so we’ll grab it while we’re in there,” He told Matt, smiling to try and lighten the mood. The rain was seriously running down their faces, and being indoors sounded very appealing anyway. He led the way to the cabin, quickly opening the door for Matt. “I really hope Cap and Tony stayed on that sandbar!”
Doom crossed his arms.
Thunder made the sky rumble again, and very soft pattering sounded around them. Clint felt a cold touch here or there—raindrops beginning to fall.
The rain on the roof was loud at first, but now it felt like background noise, giving Hawkeye and Bruce their own space. They’d retreated from the weather into the cabin, only to hide away in their room. Everyone else was hanging around in the main room.
"Wh-who's there?"
"T'Challa hasn't been paying attention to Cap and Tony," Peter whispered, looking saddened. "Unlike YOU, who went and gave Tony a bunch of tequila last night. What was that about?"
Hawkeye’s eyes narrowed, then Steve’s narrowed as they stared at one another.
"Cap, if this's about--" Sighting Daredevil, Peter blinked and stopped in his tracks. "Oh, wow. In the rain you look just like a gargoyle."
"Alright, alright! I tried to—I freaked him out." Vagueness? Check. Hopefully, the Hulk would be pleased with any answer and would calmly go to the training room or kitchen to eat a turkey.
It was Hawkeye, complete with his mask and bow strapped to his back. His clothes were dirty and he was soaking wet.
"Then why does everyone hug in return? Hugging is a long-held tradition on Midgard."
"REALLY? A secret knock? Just get in here."
"I have a feeling only Doctor Doom can get rid of this. Maybe Tony could..." Steve shook his head, wheezing. "I think it's actually getting worse."
"Hey! That reminds me, I've got to grab some buns," Tony added immediately, "yup, buns for the hamburgers. Be right back." He turned and headed straight after Steve, nearly jogging to catch up. Ouch, ouch, jogging while still a little hung over, ouch.
Deadpool leaned back out.
“I haven’t been outside yet.”
"Yeah, sorry, that would be for a DNA sample," Tony said drolly. "I'm looking at how a virus reacts with another virus in your bloodstream, and that kind of requires blood." He placed the tip of the needle onto Clint's arm...then paused, looking at it.
"Okay, I really hope he knows you're hitting on him now, or you might be creeping him out." He glanced around to check where everybody else was, and found that Thor had roped Hank and Jan into a two-on-one night beach frisbee game. Thor would probably win against both of them easily, but at least he didn't seem to mind being the third wheel.
“Reminds me…teargas,” Cap said shakily, pointing to his chest.
"Dude, you smell like window cleaner!"
“How about tonight, at the bonfire, I try to get Tony talkin’ with some help from my friend Señor Tequila and YOU get Cap to open up?”
That definitely got Bruce to look at him with caution. Did he really believe the other Clint was the real one so much? Or maybe he had some extra affection for that other Clint, so he didn't want this to be the real one...
What was he thinking? The team needed two leaders, not parents. As much as the Avengers liked to make jabs at him and Tony, it’d be easier on everyone if they kept their relationship professional. It was easier that way. They’d be focused on their work and not each other.
“Peter! That’s LOKI!” He heard Matt say. “You can’t go in there alone. I’m coming with you.”
"Say cheese!" He, Tony and Steve all smiled for the picture, posed around their rather Stark-looking sandcastle as the camera clicked.
"Eh, it can wait until we're outside I guess."
The waffle was a bit crunchy, but it was alright. Cap stacked it on top of the other, smashing the fruit in the middle like a sandwich.
Peter wrinkled his nose and slung his way over there.
Tony rubbed his forehead. He needed coffee before dealing with this. Still, he put on a smile and waved since Peter had to be here if Wade was.
"So, this's graph paper because it's for my math class, but this's a much better use for it," he said with certainty.
Have someone all to himself? Was he seriously cheating on Wade?
Nope. Not thinking about it. Not thinking… Clint tried to tell himself.
“Yeah,” Clint whispered, still facing forward. “I’ll climb a rock and let you guys know when they get out to the island. It’s not gonna take them long to put little flags up—we need to be ready to move as soon as they’re heading that way.”
"Jarvis, where'd they go?" Tony landed in his living room and folded his mask face up, glancing around.
Loki paused.
"'Buddies'..." Bruce smiled and shook his head slightly. "Listen, if you want to spend time with him, feel free to talk to him when I'm...not here. Just don't try and make me go away, okay?" He turned and looked at the sandwich shop for the umpteenth time, like the hours on the sign might have magically changed since last time.
"By not being trouble? Carol, if you could rig some kind of field to seal off the mansion, I wouldn't have to keep such a close eye on everybody, I guess," Tony said, turning to Ms. Marvel. "Hulk ripped part of the roof off, so..."
Bruce glanced at Hawkeye across the room, a bit surprised. He managed to hide it well, though, reaching for another piece of gauze and layering it over the first one. Pressing it in place again carefully, he looked up at Loki.
Due to a record-breaking heatwave, this update is a day late—sorry about that! As always, comments and kudos make our day. ♥
"Miss Potts, w-we shouldn't s-split up."
Pepper stepped over and knelt down to get a better look at the arrangement.
“I’d love to try my hand at 21st century cooking,” Cap told him, smiling back at him as he went into their cabin.
Turning his attention back ahead of them, Cap tried not think about it. Did Loki know about he and Tony’s engagement? He’d said they were the talk of the town. Had he told Peter? Was that why they couldn’t find him?
"Y-you make my heart pound," Bruce said a bit awkwardly, looking down. The ground was muddy and the Hulk's footprints were still there, filling up with rainwater. "But you wouldn't have if I didn't ask you to let me try...right? I thought I could stay calm, and I was wrong. It's on me."
"Mm?" Tony hugged around his neck a little tighter, yawning. "There's no doors on the beach," he insisted. He wasn't drunk or tired enough to miss the cabin door right there, but that meant Steve sitting him down soon... Then again, if he opened it, it seemed Steve planned to carry him inside, so he reached for it. "Well would you look at that."
Loki was wishing himself away and huddled into a ball, Tony was staring intently at Cap, and the captain looked like he had a fever. Clint had to go while the going was good.
“New York, actually.” Loki propped a hand on his hip, shrugging. “And for your information, I made my reservation months ago. Too bad you’ve spoiled the view…” As he spoke his eyes drifted to Cap and he cracked a smile. “Though not entirely.”
Leaning over the sleeping form, Clint stared. It was Bruce and he was completely NAKED.
"Just...advice."
"P-put the meat in here," he sniffled at Wade, blurry-eyed. Why were they only scolding Hawkeye if Dr. Banner was half the problem, he wondered. And why wasn't Tony affected by this onion? Was he even human?
“Why don’t we try calling him again first?” Tony suggested, moving over to grab his phone from his and Steve’s tent. He did not let go of the blanket, Steve noted.
Peter tossed his hands up and exclaimed, "Right? Although, I haven't seen that many people today compared to yesterday. Maybe I'm just used to crowds back home, but it seems practically empty here." He paused and gestured to Thor. "You think you'd like frisbee better if you were playing it with him? He's an easygoing guy, I bet he'd let you join."
The sound of the bedroom door opening made him peek over his pillow. Speak of the devil...
"OhoHO, defensive MUCH?" Tony grinned.
Loki tried to clear his mind of all the distractions, taking a deep breath as quietly as he could. He still needed to find that arrow. There was no way he could allow the Avengers to have a weapon that hurt him—even if they didn't know it did. But why else would they make a magical arrow? Surely not to hurt Thor.
"Yeah, well, y'know," Peter managed to reply, realizing Cap had commented on his own dating. Or lack thereof. "There's a lot of crime, and...gotta be responsible and stuff." He cleared his throat nervously and lowered his voice. "Hey, you think Tony's, uh, troubles are anything we could maybe help with?"
"Am I supposed to believe we ended up on the same train by chance, Wolvie?"
"No one s-should be off by t-themselves right now." What worried him was that Tony had the terrible habit of underestimating the danger he was in. He'd call for help--if his ego didn't get in the way.
If he had, Hulk would know about it. Clint had dizzy memories of hanging out with his giant green friend last night after Bruce had gone to sleep. There was no way Hulk would have thrown the box out, right? Maybe he'd smashed it... Ugh, Clint wouldn't put it past his very drunk self last night to ASK Hulk to smash the box. Bruce had spent the entire day with him, pretty much, and even sneakily plotted with him about how to figure out Cap's and Tony's relationship woes. They made a good team. Clint didn't regret hiding the stupid box.
As the hero turned to go back inside, sirens could be heard echoing their way down the busy bright street. Steve dashed back inside, finding the stairs across the office quickly and heading up.
“Yes, PETER Peter,” Cap sighed, hurrying over to save the waffle. It still had a chance—unlike the forgotten waffle on his plate, which was saggy in the middle as it grew soggy.
That must have been nice.
He wondered if Steve would be back to avoiding him again tomorrow.
Apparently one mistook that call as directed at them, because at that moment, a shiny yellow taxi with black and white checkers on the side pulled up beside them.
Tony had been determined to just look at the frisbee game and fume in silence, but he couldn't help a sidelong glance at Cap when he heard that. He'd seen many, many documentaries, history books and other articles about Steve's story, and had seen a photo or two of him from before the whole super soldier program.
"D-do you—" Steve stared down at her. “Do you think the public would be angry at the Avengers...if I asked Tony to m-marry me? I know that it's not the ‘40s anymore, but...” Trailing off to a mumble, he continued along the hallway, unsure what he thought he was doing.
“We were about to start lunch.” There was a pause, then Cap added, “A woman came looking for you this morning. Black hair, green eyes—very beautiful—oh right. You played frisbee together. Sorry, I forgot,” the captain mumbled, fidgeting with the hamburger patties. “I think she wants a rematch.”
"WAIT!" Deadpool screamed, lunging onto Peter.
Bruce shrank away from the unexpected touch.
The fact that Steve was engaged was still surprising when he took a moment to think about it. They weren’t wearing rings yet, of course, but it all felt so surreal.
“It’s none of your business,” Clint huffed, crossing his arms and looking away.
“I’ll bet the bear thing was worse than he admitted to,” he mused aloud. “Maybe he didn’t want you to know or you’d make him camp closer to us. I can kind of see why he’d want to avoid hanging out in camp now.” If Bruce had actually been mauled by a bear, then there was a radioactive gamma energy biohazard patch of forest somewhere up the hill…
Wearily, he replied, "The last Clint I saw left when I wasn't looking. I guess you're a different one."
“Well, the sun’s back, so you’ll just have to wonder about that one for now! Eheheh.” Peter paused and glanced around, realizing that the various Avengers had slowly gathered on the beach to welcome their leaders back. Even Thor and Loki—still looking like Lola—were there, arms around each other’s waists. T’challa still held a coffee mug. Dr. Banner and Hawkeye actually looked relaxed for once.
"Um. Thanks." Loki took a deep breath to humor him. Why, of all the Avengers, did it have to be the most powerful one? Thor at least was foolish and easy to confuse. "Now, can I have a few minutes to think?" He wanted to add 'alone' loudly at the end of that sentence, but refrained.
"Banner! The Captain requires your aid!" He boomed.
“’Course I do! I was just distracted by el hombre with the cooking skills. You know what they say about men knowing their way around the kitchen!” He said loudly, nudging Peter’s elbow with his.
That…was probably the perfect time to bring up how Bruce had hulked out the other night, but there was a knock on the door. Clint hopped up to get it, already suspecting who it might be.
"Look, every minute we spend bickering about this is one more minute I'm not curing Cap. This thing's really weakened him—if I don't find a cure soon, he might have trouble breathing."
“Thor, can you fly up the mountain and look for Peter?” Cap asked, moving back to rest an arm around Tony’s shoulders. It bothered him that he’d been so worried about Peter that he hadn’t noticed that Tony was standing around in the bad weather.
"We are not having a conversation, you pawn," Doom said haughtily, holding up a burning fist. "I am questioning you! If you truly are as WORTHLESS as you convey yourself to be, then there is nothing to do but dispose of you!"
THe Hulk stepped behind the couch and proceeded to shrink back down to Bruce—who promptly fell over on his stomach on the floor.
"No, he can't." Clint scooted closer, keeping a few inches distance between them.
"We never even got 'em, actually." Clint sighed, hugging onto Thor tightly. "Maybe the hunger drove him mad."
"Take a seat," Bruce sighed. "The couch will work, I guess." He sounded terribly unenthused with playing at being a medical doctor...probably because he actually wasn't one, even if he knew a lot about doctoring from years of unofficially practicing as one.
Watching Matt and Wade not getting along sucked, because he felt bad for both of them. Neither had exactly had it easy in the relationship department before starting to date him, from what little he had been able to find out about that.
"Which kind would that be?" Peter sighed, patting his back and scooting away. There was no sense in trying to avoid being glommed onto—Deadpool wouldn't get it, or wouldn't care if he did.
The scent of tequila caught Cap’s attention and he glanced across the campfire to see Clint holding a bottle and chatting with Tony.
"Did you crawl on a wet window or did some super villain try to bug spray ya?"
"I won't," Clint reassured him, patting the thin man’s arm. There was no need to summon the rage monster now, he supposed. That would be AFTER Loki was done causing trouble among the Avengers. Hawkeye’s trampish nature was proving to be way too much fun—
“Before you go,” Matt cut in quickly, stepping around Peter, “you said you’d give Wade a good talking to about responsibility.”
Matt felt like a mature, steady person. Like Cap.
“I'm not here for you, monster,” the third Hawkeye growled, magic spiraling from his hands to wrap around the arrow he had ready.
Tony looked up at him with unrestrained adoration--which probably just looked like shiny-eyed drunk happy face to Steve, thanks to Señor Tequila--and patted one of his hands.
The silence lingered, before an alarm rang through Peter’s mind.
Steve gave him a long look and shook his head.
Cap frowned as Tony spoke, staring at the castle like it had done the Hydra salute.
"Aye, I would enjoy that."
“Whoa! This is so awesome!” Jan gasped, sweeping into the door with a big grin. “Tony, Tony! Can I have the other key?” The Wasp stuck a hand out to him, big blue eyes blinking sweetly.
"Sure, sure." He started out of the door, taking note of where the others were. Everyone except for Hank was already inside the cabin. The blond scientist was pulling a couple of regular-sized suitcases--that was to say, large-for-regular-sized--out of the trunk with a determined frown. Back at the mansion Hank had offered to shrink the luggage to make it super easy to carry, but Tony had known exactly what he was up to, and wouldn't allow it. No sneaking along a whole lab shrunken down small enough to pack. No conveniently having to bring along the Pym particle gun to resize the luggage and everything else. This was a low-tech vacation, and Hank would have to carry full-size luggage like everybody else.
Thor paused and looked back, Lola’s hand still in his.
Slapping a hand onto his side to show that he was listening, Loki swooned from the pain. How had he forgotten how that felt? Straightening up and taking a shaky breath, he turned around to face the Hulk.
The chemical smoke had a lingering effect; he could barely speak. Whatever was in that bomb, it must have been specially made to work on him, as no normal gas would. Cap looked around the cell. There was some dirt along the walls, otherwise it was stripped of anything useful.
"Yeah, you guys don't have to be in a cell anymore. Bruce is in the medical room, hopefully curing Cap since YOU weren't any help with that..."
Slumping into his chosen seat, Peter looped an arm around the nearest support pole that hooked to the ceiling and leaned against it, thinking back on the news report by Jameson. It had said Captain America had abandoned his post. He knew Spider-Man wasn't to blame, but that didn't explain who was...
Like Peter and his boyfriend.
"Me, unkind to Cap? Can't imagine what you're talking about," he said coolly.
"Actually, I think Thor would be a better option. Jarvis hates me," Clint told Tony.
The first thing she saw was a blonde man strapped to a table by his wrists and ankles, his bloodied shirt pushed up to reveal a stitched-up wound. The table was a little bloody, too, and there were some medical supplies and needles scattered on the floor near it.
"Delighted," he muttered to the empty room.
Settling next to Peter, he went quiet while Cap and Tony served out the coffee.
He coughed, taking a sudden long gulp of his coffee. It was lukewarm by now. Still delicious.
"I know you're trying to help, pal, but it's been a long couple of days."
"Twice? How'd I miss that?" Johnny mumbled, scratching his head.
"Relax, it's not a bomb, just a tracking device," Tony snickered.
"Ahh." The archer didn't move, but stared at him. "Why don't you?"
“Hey!” His grin faded as they got closer and he realized that the kayak was dragging really bad in the back. Cap’s elbows were in the water, actually. He’d seen them paddle out, so he knew that Cap couldn’t just be too heavy for the blue kayak to handle. Despite the dragging tail-end, Cap was paddling strongly enough to move them forward at a good pace anyway. Tilting his head, Peter watched as they glided the rest of the way to the shore.
“Imagine if we’d taken the entire team instead of just a few at a time,” Tony said drolly. He smiled after a moment, though, raising Steve’s hand up to kiss it. “I admit, I’d love to actually be able to wear our engagement rings. If we could sneak around for the last month, though, we can sneak around a few more days. Let’s do this right. Even if this trip goes up in flames, I still get you all to myself for the honeymoon.”
"Oh, it is, and the power's out over half of downtown, too," Tony called after them. "Have fun!" There was the sound of his armor's boosters firing behind them as they headed outside.
"I'm starting to think that whole 'help, my building's on fire' thing was a setup," Clint grouched, stretching to reach the control panel the man had been typing on.
"Tony shouldn't be making you move around right now," Bruce said quietly, turning and leading him down the hallway again. Whoever this other Clint was, he was positive he had the real one walking beside him.
"Yeah...sleeping probably isn't the best option, uh, self." Circling around the bed to be opposite Bruce, Hawkeye patted his double's arm. "What'd you want to talk to Thor about, anyway?"
“WELL?” Loki pressed impatiently, crossing his arms. “If you have something you want to say, spit it out. I have piña coladas to drink.”
Clint felt his heart skip and he fought not to have any reaction.
“I don’t think I should stay, Peter. I don’t want to get anyone in trouble and I’m sure that driver’s going to sue--”
“Sure, let’s get that double chocolate going for Wade,” Peter said, making a beeline for the campfire. As always, Cap and Tony approached things with different tactics. For some reason Steve didn’t want to have an all-out discussion about it, but Peter knew better than to relax just yet. This wasn’t over.
Well, there went that heart pounding problem again. Bruce turned to look at him and found himself freezing up a little. He was joking, right? Of course he was.
Peter patted the blond's arm, shooting him a sympathetic look. What was that about?
The set of big blue eyes staring at him blinked, then Wade asked in a whisper, “Did I get shot in the head again? Damn, that always makes the hallucinations weirder.”
“Well, Wade, why don’t you join us for lunch? We’d love to get to know you and if you’re friends with Peter, you must like hot dogs,” Cap told the man, his eyes glancing in Peter’s direction.
Slipping out of Wade’s arms, Peter shot a web string up into the trees and swung up the hill toward the campsite. Yeah, the mere thought of having Captain America and Iron Man disappointed in his life choices made him panic a little. They had to know how hard it was to date as a superhero! Although now that he thought about it, the Bugle had just done a tabloid conspiracy theory article on why Tony hadn’t been seen with any supermodels in almost a year…
No. Nope. He wasn’t going to complicate his life by dating at work. NOPE.
Steve knew his reasoning was completely selfish. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could NOT show how much he loved Tony.
"Jarvis, w-where is Iron Man?"
Cap rotated in his seat, squishing Clint against the door. Without comment, he gave the door a firm kick to try and free it from its hinges. The cab door bent outward, but did not pop open. The driver punched a button on the dash, then, and the road in front of them seemed to lift up like a hatch. They sped right down under it, down some kind of ramp. The walls of this new tunnel were pretty close to the car.
Having just gotten a couple hours of solid sleep, the blond felt way better. Not ‘woohoo’ better, but better than before.
2: In this chapter, Captain America uses the term "queer". Please note that we are aware this word can be seen a slur for some people, and as an empowered retaken word for others. Cap is from the 1940s, and not in the know about modern terminology to refer to LGBTQA+ people (in EMH he wakes up from the ice and joins the team straight away, so he hasn't been awake for very long at all) so he's still using this term. In the 1940s, some people did self-identify as queer, so it's not necessarily just a name to call others. If you're curious,
Glancing away and back, Clint frowned.
“It’s just for the week,” Cap corrected quickly as they reached the cabin door. The blond man stopped, glancing at the door and lowering his voice. “Tony’s alright, but I think he has dating trouble of his own.”
With both of them paddling (or maybe just Steve putting in an honest effort), they rocketed up to the sand bar fast enough that the nose of the boat slid up onto the shore almost a foot. Cap wasted no time hopping out and hauling the kayak, Tony and all, further up onto the sandy spit. Shading his eyes, the big blond looked around for the shark before he stuck a hand out to help Tony out of the boat.
Abruptly, Wade fell silent, blue eyes wide. He coughed loudly into his hand, glancing Peter’s way.
"How's that?" Peter asked dubiously. "I mean, don't get me wrong, I-I wanna help them too. They're doing a LOT of moping for guys on a tropical beach vacation."
Rolling his eyes at the childish saying, Clint slogged after them. The sooner they made it back, the sooner Clint could go back to not hearing about everyone’s dating life!
"Well, it doesn't SOUND very appetizing. Skunks have nothing to do with mythical creatures like the other flavors, so I'm not sure why they went there."
"It's not because s-she's your secretary—she t-takes care of you." Steve pushed open the basement door and led them to the bottom of the stairs. "Sort of l-like I do," he added thoughtfully.
“Dear God,” Steve breathed, swimming away again. He made a circle and when he arrived back, he sighed. “Alright. Say they are dating, how do we stop… No.” Slowly, Cap shook his head. “We should trust Peter to make his own judgment. I guess.”
“If they are the dangerous kind of enemies, does that mean he’s a hero?” The captain asked, concerned. “I wasn’t sure if he knew about Spider-Man or not.”
Maybe because Tony couldn't figure out exactly what, either. What did Steve want from him, anyway? First they avoided each other, then Steve made sure he got to bed okay drunk and fed him waffles in the morning, and now there was the whole family sandcastle time and 'we're his dads' to that babe in the bikini.
He wished the synthesizer would be done so that it could beep and interrupt this conversation. He'd been pretty sure the other Hawkeye was the real one, and now this. What a mess. It was exhausting. HE was exhausted.
"Cap, America's changed, too. Being yourself is a-a really important example to lead with," she said frankly. "Besides, I-I know Tony's really into you. It's pretty obvious..."
"Now that you see they are alive, we will discuss business," Doom said, watching this with a sort of impatient annoyance—like he wanted to get on with this already.
If they were gonna start in with the bear speech one more damn time…
Bruce watched him head out the door again before he could get a word in edgewise.
“Okay, it’s not like Hulk is a mindless monster,” Clint pointed out, carefully stepping closer. “Yeah, I guess nobody knows you that well. I feel like I’m beginning to. If you’ll let me.” Tentatively, he leaned to take Bruce’s hand.
Floating above the water, kicking around like he was falling, hovered Clint. A dim green glow wrapped around him as he drifted to the shoreline. As soon as he was over solid ground, the magic vanished and he dropped onto his butt in the mud.
It was indeed the two blonds, now drenched from head to toe. Hawkeye perked up at seeing the Hulk.
"Jeez!" Thanks to hitting into the Human Torch, Peter went spinning on his piece of web, still in mid-swing. He quickly let go of that piece and snapped a new web string to the nearest building, splatting against it on his back and staying stuck there with his hands and feet until he got his bearings.
"Don't worry ma'am!" Deadpool chimed in. "I've got him!" Keeping his back to Aunt May, Wade pulled Peter to his feet, dusting him off all over. Heavy footsteps suddenly came from behind them.
"Captain, wake up," Pepper whispered from nearby.
“Tell him I won't do it again.”
"They saw me and Cap get into a taxi—then they went missing." Clint got up too, straightening out his pajamas. The blond stared at Bruce for a minute, looking more and more uncomfortable. "Hey. I'm sorry for..." He trailed off and stared down at his feet. "You know. The whole..." Mumbling and shivering, he started picking up the wad of blankets off of the floor.
"I've got work today," Peter said hastily. "Power blackouts mean people to help! Maybe some other time." He shot a web at the nearest streetlight and went swinging that way.
"Just be blunt," she suggested. "It's not polite, but that's okay."
Bruce had already been under the covers, so he'd figured he should lay down. He was already laying down, so he'd figured he could close his eyes, just to rest them for a moment. And then he was asleep, just like that.
"Captain America and YOU?" Bruce looked at him quickly. "Then how come you're here?"
Cap gently lay him down in the hammock bed, leaning over him briefly to tug the blankets up over him.
Wait a minute. Clint’s tired brain drew on the sip of coffee and managed to come up with a single answer.
"Oh, my god," Spider-Man groaned, swinging from the fire escape to stick to the side of the skyscraper he was climbing. "You're STILL here?"
“Out?” Cap wondered, thinking for a moment. “Oh. As queer,” he told himself more than Peter. Clearing his throat, he nodded as he grew serious again. Then the blond sighed, shaking his head and gazing up at the stars. “I forget that some of us have multiple lives to live. I’m sorry, Peter. It’s really none of my business. God, I feel like I’ve been saying that a lot lately.”
“So, any plans for today? I was hoping someone would indulge me and help me build a sandcastle. I haven’t done that since I was a kid.”
"He's 18, he barely knows what a serious relationship is!" He replied quietly as well. He kind of wanted to just say it loudly so Wade over there would get the picture.
Swiping his hair back away from his face, Steve paced around the camp.
As soon as they were back, Clint planned on convincing Cap and Tony to give up on the stupid camping trip and go home, where Bruce wouldn’t get mauled by a bear.
"Hey Bruce." He waved a hand.
Bruce sighed.
"I-I..." Clint mumbled under his breath, face reddening.
"Thanks, Cap," Peter said with relief. "That means a lot. Don't worry, I've been in over my head plenty of times as Spider-Man and I always figure things out. " He laughed nervously and waved a hand. "I-I mean, in the past! Now I've got you and the other Avengers if I really need help." He glanced off in the direction Tony and Wade had gone, adding more quietly, "You know Tony was asking if he should act like me and Wade were a couple earlier, right? Not you and him."
"You hope you DO get pneumonia...?" Bruce asked, taking hold of his side of the vest so that Clint could let go of it. Not that there was anywhere for the archer's arm to rest, with Bruce sitting right up against his side to huddle under the vest. Clint's arm was behind him at the moment.
“Hi Wade,” said a put-upon sounding man’s voice. “And Hawkeye.”
"He managed to lose Thor. We have to find him!" Loki huffed, trying to pull Bruce toward the living room.
"They're still gonna be in the same place everybody else is if we do that," Peter said worriedly. "I hate to say it, but I think they need to be STUCK somewhere together or they won't talk. How are we gonna do that?"
"This 'news' is to inform, is it not?" Thor was still offended. "To tell anything less than the truth is a failure of his duty! I prefer to watch the nature over this deceit." He shook his head disapprovingly and reached for the popcorn. Ever since Bruce had made a bowl of popcorn during movie night, Thor had it nearby any time the television was turned on.
"Don't...don't hurt them," he told the archer, still doing his best to shield both of the other Clints behind him. Realistically, stretching his arms out to the sides didn't cover much of them, but he had to try.
"Where. Is. He."
"...Are we having a moment?" The man said suddenly, tilting his head. "Shut up!" He hissed to one side, returning his attention immediately to Peter.
Clint tried to ignore Johnny, instead pulling his feet up and sinking into the couch a bit.
The pizza smelled divine. Bruce would have liked nothing better than to grab a whole box and retreat to his room to devour it. Instead, he cautiously swiped two slices, being careful not to brush hands with Clint or look at him for too long or anything. If things seemed awkward now, he didn't want to THINK about how they would be if the others found out about the escapades he and Clint had been on all night...
"Tony? Are you alright?"
“Thor!” Loki said, waving a hand in greeting. Mixed in with the crowd, Thor didn’t pay him much attention. He was busy answering one of the reporters.
Bruce instinctively leaned away from his hand, so Clint wound up just grasping his shirt sleeve. It still kind of worked to haul the reluctant scientist along by the arm, though he looked dubious about this whole thing.
“No security cameras on the mountain,” he assured himself, spearing a marshmallow on a stick and holding it over the fire. He’d heard Dr. Banner talking about his favorite camping spot on the edge of a lake near here, and the bright idea to go camping had come to mind. So far it was pretty peaceful, although he’d expected Wade to spend more time with him and less time looking for firewood or being distracted by pretty birds like he’d been doing half the day.
Everyone in New York was convinced that he and Tony were together. Even some of the other Avengers had made comments and jabs at them being an item. After being around Tony for even a few months, Cap had started to notice the lingering thoughts about him. His smug smirk and biting wit. Those beautiful topaz eyes.
“If Hulk did anything violent toward Peter or any of his friends, I’m sincerely sorry. Why did you want me to be me for this trip, anyway? It’s safer for everybody if I just stay as the Hulk.”
"How long are we going to wait?" Sitting around among mortals was a waste of time if they were really just going to wait. They weren't the regular ones either, they were the kind he spent most of his time trying to get rid off. This way it was too easy for them to keep an eye on him. He needed to get one alone...
"Technology's Tony's first love, that's for sure," Pepper said a bit dryly. She coughed slightly, then sighed. "If pizza and lingerie can't get his attention, I've learned to stop trying and let him work. When he gets an idea, it's like he's possessed."
"Sounds like a problem they could fix pretty easy if they just talked it out. Like adults," he added pointedly, looking off the side of the kayak into the shining blue water. There were probably sharks down there somewhere. It was kind of funny that that was the least of his worries right now.
"Uh huh." Clint hummed, tugging at his restraints, trying to scoot further away. "Keep your hands where I can see them."
Peter swung his way over to the living room, flipping down from the roof to his feet and tugging his mask off at last.
Slowly, Clint felt his mouth hang open.
The scientist stopped and turned toward him, placing the hand that wasn't on Clint's back onto his shoulder.
“Most likely he’s just on a hiking trail somewhere up there, Steve,” Tony said, standing and moving to take one of Steve’s hands. Looking down at it, he smiled, squeezing Steve’s fingers. “With any luck, Loki doesn’t even know he’s here yet.”
The sun was just getting high enough to warm the long shadows across the beach and Cap had been sitting out there before those shadows had even appeared, grateful that the storm had whisked itself away overnight.
"In a minute it won't." To Hawkeye, he added, "Knowing Tony, he rigged something up. He's good at that."
"Cut it out! We've got bigger problems, and Peter's a teenager!"
What would that even be? It was bizarre to realize that even though anger was the thing everybody talked about using to bring out the Hulk, Clint had absolutely no idea what pissed Bruce off. Generally with the Avengers, the transformation thing always happened after somebody was stupid enough to attack Bruce (possibly Hawkeye himself.)
“He came by to say good morning and ask if we could bring you this,” Cap explained, offering Peter a white T-shirt.
Hauling Bruce along by the arm, Clint was honed in on the scent of fresh coffee. It was drifting out of the camp as they got closer.
“Cap and Tony have been in this nice, quiet, we-get-along spree for WEEKS,” he added to Peter, trying to come up with something nicer to say than ‘look away while I shoot your boyfriend.’
“Should I grab you a shirt, then?” Clint jerked a thumb back up toward the cabin.
Tony looked up at him and smiled.
“How dare you!” The God of Mischief managed, eyes on Wade as he bobbed to the surface. Loki spotted his book and a tiny umbrella drifting past them and Peter thought he could see Loki’s face redden with rage.
Cringing, Cap rubbed his forehead. Wonderful. Tony didn’t remember!
Peter cleared his throat and glanced that way awkwardly as well.
Bruce blinked and looked down.
“For the part about Tony and Cap being together, or about us being together? That elephant statue DOES look pretty graphic at that angle,” Bruce joked dryly.
"Come on in, boys," Ms. Marvel said through a sigh.
"I mean, if you like it, okay. But if you change your mind, just let me know." He turned to Tony. "Want me to bring you some paper and a pencil to get started on that sandcastle design?"
He gestured toward the door in an "after you" motion.
Cap frowned.
The only way Cap could think of explaining himself was in a letter. It was silent, dodging Daredevil’s super hearing, and it was easy to tear up if he changed his mind about handing it to Tony. Without any actual paper along on their vacation, he had settled for writing on the back of one of the recipe cards he’d brought along. He wasn’t a good cook anyway.
Eying Matt, Lola giggled behind her hand.
"Well, it's worth a try." Hawkeye shrugged, sticking the light arrow into the wall and drawing a new arrow. They all moved away from the door, taking cover behind the far row of beds. With expert skill, the archer fired the arrow into the door.
No doubt he wondered why Steve had Hawkeye's card, but he didn't waste time talking about it.
"Ah, don't bother with that." He said it so calmly, but a bit awkwardly. Since when did Clint care about his clothes, or anybody else's?
"Hell no!" Clint growled, stepping back from them. "I'll stay here but I'm not going into a cell. No way!"
"If only I was known for being responsible, I could use that excuse in case Pepper calls me."
"Hey, I have a great idea. Let's all relax and order pizza. I’m sure some place has a backup generator!" People were so grumpy, they clearly didn't need to wait for somebody to cook dinner...especially if Thor had no idea what he was cooking.
"What is it?" The scientist asked, trying to breathe evenly and get rid of that racing pulse as quickly as he could.
"This is not my doing."
The green Avenger snorted.
The muscular blond closed his eyes, focusing on taking slow deep breaths.
"Yeah, right. If I did this every night, I'd never study for chemistry and I'd flunk it," he commented.
Hello from the writers! We were on top of this posting twice per week thing with a bunch of chapters written in advance, but a combination of Stressful Real Life (TM) this month and just plain working on a lot of projects at once had led to us running out of prewritten chapters. The TL;DR is that we are dialing back the posting schedule to once per week, on Tuesdays. Don't worry, we will keep posting regularly and onward 'til the end, though. ♥ Thanks for reading and enjoying our fic, as always!
Loki went to him immediately, pressing a kiss to his cheek and hugging herself against his chest happily. She smiled back Peter’s way.
Peter slapped his hand in a high five.
“You make that sound dire, Captain. What has Banner done?”
“Yep, allies. You go camping in the middle of the woods alone with your allies,” Tony added dryly, crossing his arms.
"Look. How can I prove to you that I'm me?" Hawkeye frowned at him.
"Er....hmm." Tony paused and hovered there, bringing a hand to the chin of his mask like he could stroke his goatee through it. "Jarvis? Check in on Dr. Banner for me real quick. I mean, I'm sure he's in his room, he hasn't left it for a week, but..."
Turning quickly, Loki spotted Tony Stark on the other side of the gate. The man was in leather sandals, red swim trunks and a white tank top. Clutched in one hand was a bright orange mixed drink with a little umbrella and his cell phone in the other. To top off his summer look, he had on a pair of huge gold rimmed mirror-lensed sunglasses.
“We’ll just follow you.”
Bruce looked at him thoughtfully.
"Whoa!" A familiar youthful voice exclaimed from the trunk. "Whoops, wrong trunk, this isn't New Jersey!"
Steve turned to smile at Tony.
"Then Doom shall heed your advice, Asgardian—Thor's allies shall be freed before he is drawn out alone. And you shall also be freed with them, taken back with the others to their refuge. In return I ask only this of you..."
"That bad, huh?"
How long had the coffee been perking? He hadn’t bothered to time it, but it felt like a long time, so Tony took the pot off of the fire. Smelled like coffee. Success.
"Bruce?" If he turned into the Hulk now, it wouldn't be a bad thing. Everyone was stuck, injured or busy. Maybe Hulk could go check on Pepper.
"Hey, don't hurt each other. This whole stitches situation started because you were fighting," he sighed.
“What Tony does is his business. As long as he does what he needs to do to keep the Avengers together, I keep my nose out of his private life. I’m done arguing with him about it,” Cap told him quietly, taking a long sip from his root beer like it might have been an ACTUAL beer.
"It's a girl, huh?"
"Getting hotdogs or whatever you said you were gonna do," the red and blue hero said, waving a hand in a "shoo" kind of gesture. "What are you followin' me around for?"
Tony gave a sigh of exasperation and started to paddle over there. So much for a quiet camping trip with the team…
“You’re not allowed on the PLANET,” Steve snapped back, scowling up at the God of Mischief.
They both had a sense of humor and were inventor types, it made sense they might have a lot to talk about.
"We have to at least TRY to get out of here," Pepper said, pushing herself to her feet and leaning against the wall. She looked around the cell for any sign of a weakness.
“He’s never said it like that, but he did slip up and call you dad one time.” Matt paused to sip his coffee, laughing to himself. “He was mortified, until he realized that you had hung up before he said it.”
Clint took note of the alcove, as it might work as a spot to bury that tackle box. It was out of the way and the sand was piled up, so he could just rake it around to cover any holes he dug.
Matt gave her a nervous smile, holding up his walking stick.
Tony rolled over yet again, pulling the sleeping bag over his head. Ugh—he’d hardly slept all night. After the constantly-talking Wade had returned from the campfire errand, he and Peter had stuck around for a few hours to make s’mores and tell ghost stories. Usually Thor and Clint would get into sharing tall tales about past fights they’d been in, but Peter had insisted on spooky stories for some reason.
"S-so that's how it is, huh...'if I were a woman'." If there was one thing Tony was good at from his years of partying and flirting and general goofing off, it was a puppy-eyed stare. He put on his best one now, just to see what the blonde would do.
Bruce shook his hand, smiling uneasily. "Well I'm also not very smooth at bonfire beach parties, and I can't touch alcohol." He perked up, blinking as he realized aloud, "Hey, Cap doesn't drink, either. There's something to start talking to him about."
Clint followed him, though, slinging on his dripping vest.
“FINE,” he groaned, ending the call and shoving the card back into one of his many pockets. Slapping Hulk’s arm, Clint waved a hand in the general direction of the Avenger’s mansion. “Let’s go.”
It’d be a shame if he didn’t, because Peter was sleeping just down the hall. If Cap had to explain it again, it'd be hard to do without being suspicious.
Cap stared at Daredevil, perplexed by the sudden concern in his voice. The redhead stared back, putting on a calm expression again. Maybe he hadn’t meant to upset Peter after all.
"I can't sit in there with everyone. It's...not relaxing, it's just a room full of noise." He looked into the glass of water he was holding like he'd just remembered he was holding it.
Thor had crossed his arms, and was listening rather seriously to everything they said. He didn't interrupt, though.
Clint was having a hard time now believing that Doom had never actually seen Wall-E, with a response like that. He still had no idea what the man wanted, though, which unfortunately meant that they had to keep talking to each other.
"Huh. Maybe Bruce CAN sleep outside on the beach if he wants," Tony said sheepishly. He hadn't thought things through that far yet. It seemed counter to their group vacation to leave a member of the group outside overnight, though. "We'll figure something out. The kid's shrimpy, these cabins are big--we could make him a sleeping bag or something."
“Speaking of shooting,” Clint muttered, snagging Dr. Banner’s arm and leading him back toward the tree.
Again, there was a moment of silence.
It was definitely MJ's.
“Great. Now I need to pee too.”
“’Again’?” He asked.
“Matt’s not leaving,” Peter told Wade, sighing a little as well. “I need both of you guys with me when we sit them down for the big talk tomorrow morning. After all of this is over, I promise we’ll have a do-over of our weekend alone, okay? This one’s full of Avengers.” He stepped over to the fallen tree and webbed his way into the branches above it, shooting strands onto the sides and pulling to make it roll. The tent underneath was indeed crushed to bits of plastic, bent metal, and torn canvas. What did the Hulk have against their camp in particular?
“Yeah, uh huh. So, anti-fraternization includes you two, RIGHT?” Hawkeye snapped, flicking a hand in Steve’s direction.
“Oh, no, no.” Cap shook his head, growing shy. “I have a recipe card.” He turned and picked up a worn little index card, showing it to them with a smile. “I don’t cook that much, to be honest.”
“You know my last name? Wow.” That was sort of flattering. Matt could hear every word, he reminded himself. Wait, would Matt think Loki was hitting on him? Did Loki think that after the whole Jane Austen quote thing from last night? …Great, now, Peter was starting to blush.
"Inside, bleeding," Hawkeye said with a shrug. It was a good thing Tony already knew about all of that or he might assume that they were trying to break out for a more evil reason. "Don't worry—we left him with Cap in the living room."
“Thank you, Peter,” Steve told him, stepping back to grab the lunches. As soon as he was near the kayaks, he handed both the sandwiches and the map off to Tony so he could move the blue kayak into the water.
And here was Steve.
“I’m sorry, Bruce, excuse me for a moment,” Steve told him quickly, heading back over to Thor and Tony. He would just ask the demigod to tie his hair back,a nd maybe he would be less recognizable. “Thor?”
“Been there, done that. No thanks.”
"Uhhhh..." Clint said through his captured jaw. "He's tall and shtupid?"
So this wasn’t just weird for Clint, then. It was true that these days the Hulk pretty much stayed the Hulk, even when he slept. It made Clint wonder if Bruce could take over while the big green guy was sleeping if he wanted to. Was that how that worked?
"It's actually kind of brilliant," Peter said, raising his eyebrows. "They'll think they're distracting themselves and doing a team thing and they'll really be off alone for hours. Maybe even all day."
“I’ll help!” Tony called over the din, turning and grabbing hold of the kayak. He knew perfectly well that Steve was strong enough to carry it on his own, so he must have been sticking close out of sheer stubbornness.
Tony sighed and rubbed his forehead. He didn’t seem particularly surprised by the peck on the cheek, but not exactly pleased about it, either. Peter himself actually blushed, clearing his throat.
“Ooh,” Loki purred, a twinkle in his eyes. “I like it when good men use bad words.”
"Hey Jeff! We'd like some dogs, man!"
"Okay...I sent this out with Pepper. Where is she?"
"Uh, okay, sure. Why are we being so sneaky about this whatever-we're-doing?"
Having reluctantly handed over his pocket money for a ticket, the brunette stepped aboard the train and headed as far to the back as he could to get a seat that hopefully was a few spaces away from other people. Man, oh man did heightened senses point out the folks who didn't wear deodorant like no other...
Tony laughed as casually as he could and gave Steve's arms one last pull to try and lift him up. When that did exactly nothing, he glanced around.
“I think you’re right about the sunscreen. I bought some.”
Cap listened to him walk off, then turned to Tony, crossing his arms and giving him a look.
"...I guess the world hasn't changed as much as I thought. But next time, you might try an omelet. He seems to like those." It was a really strange comment, but Cap didn't add to it. "I don't suppose you're wearing a hair pin?"
"Man. Now I'm really confused." He heard a step as Hawkeye moved closer. "So, are you just hanging out in the hallway or what?"
"Gross," he said, of the last comments. "I'd take mold over Limburger any day."
“Ah man!” Clint groaned from behind them. He rushed in the middle of the gathered group, snagging the fishing box and shoving it back into the trunk.
"Oh," Bruce said, and tired as he was he didn't bother to disguise the disappointment in his voice. Whatever. At this point, if the Hulk showed up at least he would get a break from this awkward conversation...as selfish as that was to even think about.
Grumbling, the blond archer shifted, yawning and stretching an arm out to dangle off the Hulk’s head. He took a moment to clumsily get his Avenger’s indenticard out and tap the glowing arrows.
"Well. No." Clint followed him around the bench, his feet splashing through a small puddle. "Hulk’s not a big talker, okay?"
Plunking back into his seat hard enough that the kayak bobbed, Steve started paddling again, turning their boat out to sea. The long lumpy sand bar was dead ahead.
"No problem." The Human Torch plunked back down and opened the top pizza box, handing out slices.
Hawkeye had believed he and Tony were an item. Perhaps Clint was just being defensive and had said it to make Tony uncomfortable.
"Cap's cure is still synthesizing in the lab," Bruce said apologetically. "I was hoping you would walk me back there to check on it. Tony can't keep this up forever. I'll be quiet, though, so you can think."
"It would clean the scrape out really well," he ventured, after what felt like a really long time. "Do you really think..." He paused, looking down into the water pensively. "If Cap and Tony really are together, and having issues, that's bad for everybody. Imagine if the team split up. We should try and help mediate."
He was doing his best to look on the bright side, but oof, the Spidey tendency to angst was a powerful one. Somewhere in the back of his mind was a little voice freaking out about how Wade was too jealous for this group thing, how Matt felt left-out, how Cap and Tony were somehow gonna arrest both of them and haul them off to villain super-prison…
Zoning back out of his exhausted thoughts, Clint frowned as he tuned into the endless chatter that was Deadpool.
"Yeah. We could do that, or, just a thought, we train with lasers and robots." He gave Bruce a sly grin. "You know, shoot stuff...smash stuff."
Outside, Tony could hear Wade.
"Whoa--thanks, I forgot!" Peter took the offered ice-cream and shot Hawkeye a smile. The archer had seemed extra irritated all morning, especially when he and Peter and Dr. Banner had been shopping. Maybe he missed the Hulk.
Stubbornly staying right where he was, Tony gestured to the kayak fort again with emphasis.
"I don't think that's a good idea," Bruce said cautiously. "If the other guy showed up, he would be more trouble than any trouble we ran into."
Rolling his eyes, Clint groaned.
"Emergency kits are in the closets," Pepper and Bruce said in unison. The two looked at each other and blinked. Apparently both knew Tony's tendencies just that well at this point.
"I think we should all go to the living room, order some Chinese food, and figure this out on a full stomach." Clint patted Thor's hulking arms gingerly.
Peter watched him go curiously.
Sleeping after his conversation with Bruce had proved to be really hard. Now that he knew the scientist had a thing for him, he felt bad for leading him on. It wasn’t like Bruce could do anything, and there was no way they could even try to do anything if poor Hulk would arrive in the middle of it. Not even kissing. Nope.
Peter wanted to slap his own forehead, but that would’ve made noise. What was Wade even trying to find in the lake, anyway? Did he make something up just to see if Loki would help him look for nothing?
“We’ll have to wait until it’s dark.”
Remarkably handsome and incredibly stubborn.
Steve had to agree there.
Awkwardly, Bruce slipped the shirt over his head, stuck both arms through the top along with his head, and pulled it down to wear around his waist like a skirt. Probably wasn't the first time he'd ever done that, from how fast he decided how to wear it. It was just a tank top, but he held onto one shoulder strap to keep it from falling down and turned to get his bearings about where they were. It was a stretch of beach Clint didn't recognize. Great, which way did they come from?
"I can't go anywhere with you," Peter informed Deadpool in a rather urgent whisper. "Aunt May'll worry if I just take off! I'm supposed to just be coming HOME, okay?"
Pepper glanced at him from where she'd sat down on the floor beside Cap and kind of leaned on him a bit. She seemed to be worried that Doom might take him away and was keeping tabs on him. Steve seemed to be sleeping for the moment. His breathing was raspier than before, though.
"Just head up toward the Baxter Building," Peter said as casually as he could. His aunt looked at him oddly, but he only smiled in response and shrugged. The Baxter Building was not only nowhere near the same direction as their place, but it was also closed to the public at this time of the evening.
"Has the pain faded yet?"
For some strange reason, the masked man decided to play the piano for a while. Perhaps he was just making sure that Cap didn’t die before Tony came back. He seated himself in front of the enormous instrument and began to play a melodious piece by Mozart without comment.
"You k-knew?" The blond asked quietly. Suddenly, he stood up and made his way slowly over to his friend.
"Whoa, wait, we could've sent BOTH of them off away from Peter for the week, and you stopped them? WHY?" He was mystified. Cap must have a good reason for this, but he couldn't think of what.
A castle. His own castle. Loki wondered vaguely how Midgard would take it if he moved in and built his own small nation, before he realized that he had been staring up at the demigod the whole time.
“What do you want for lunch? Old or new?” Tony pulled his phone out. Three new messages from Pepper. Nothing too terrible then. It could wait.
“Oh yeah? Anything left of it?”
Breathe, honey. Tony’s voice.
“Gee, thanks. That hadn’t occurred to me.” Steve pulled away from the comforting touch and crossed his arms. “So did you take me to lunch just to tell me that I’m sad and pathetic? Cuz you coulda just told me in the elevator.”
“It has been 76 years since my last confession. Not since Ma died.” There was a stunned silence before the priest cleared his throat.
“Malibu.” It was muffled against his shoulder, but Steve heard it too clearly. “Pepper says I need to go back before the end of the year. She wants me to show up to more meetings and take a more active role in the company. I’m supposed to meet her there next week.” Steve gently lifted Tony’s head from his shoulder and repeated the touch Tony had used on him, holding his face in his hands.
“You would certainly look out of place sitting behind a desk all day. And you’d be okay moving to DC?”
“You know, Aunt Peggy used to tell me about the grenade at boot camp. And the flagpole. The way that you kept on going, even with half the other recruits laughing in your face.”
“Like shit.” Tony downed his drink.
“Sorry, Cap. From another movie we’ll make you suffer through.” His smile faded. Tony moved his hands into Steve’s hair and Steve tilted his head into the touch.
“Notice what?”
“Are you kidding? I was always gettin in trouble for fightin’.”
“Yeah, I think so. But I want more and I can’t have it.”
“Good morning, Cap.” But there was a growing list of reasons why he really wanted to. Tony greeted him with a cup of coffee and a tired smile. His hair reminded Steve a bit of a mad scientist. Like Tony had run his hands through it a few times too many. It stood up in all directions and dammit if Steve didn’t want to run his hands through it too. Tony was clearly tired but his smile reached his dark brown eyes and Steve couldn’t help but smile back.
He did his best to lose himself in the punching bag. It was difficult this morning. His mood was already questionable. He had too many things on his mind. Steve could still taste the cigarette he had shared with Johnny. Cigarettes and coffee. They had all lived on that during the war. Jesus, why was this so hard? Why couldn’t he just get over it? And why the hell were there planes flying over? They hadn’t requested any damn air support.
“Yeah, yes. Dinner. Absolutely. We’re on our way home and I’ll see you for dinner.” Tony hung up before she could answer. Pepper was going back to California. To his actual house. He had gotten so wrapped up in the Battle of New York and Bruce and Steve and the Avengers...he had forgotten that he didn't normally live in New York. Huh. Stay in New York with Steve and Bruce and maybe Natasha and Clint depending on how charitable he feels. Who knows about Thor. Or go back to Malibu with Pepper. His girlfriend. He had been contemplating proposing before all of this. Before the Avengers. ...Before Steve. Fuck. He was in so much trouble.
“He did mention camping apart for the safety of others. I hadn’t thought it was this serious, however.”
“That’s neither here nor there,” Matt told them, pushing off of the car to meet Cap and Wade. “Wade, I need to talk to you. Now.” Taking Wade’s arm, he led him off to the front of the car.
"No! Us! The Fantastic Four, man! I went home this morning and there's no one there! Herbie's all ripped apart and none of the security cameras got anything!" He let go of Spider-Man's shirt and clasped his hands together. "Come on! I gotta talk to the Avengers! How'd you get out?"
“Let’s say…some kind of team building exercise?” Clint suggested. “We’ve got ten people here, plus Thor’s lady friend and YOU.” He pointed to Matt, who blinked at him sleepily.
"The creature is hard to miss," Thor pointed out, hovering them there to scan the area below. "Perhaps he has transformed back into Banner by now."
"Not sure, this stuff was made with Cap in mind," Tony frowned, pressing a bit harder on the syringe.
"It's not worth what happens if I mess up even once. After yesterday, I don't think it's possible anymore..." He sat down on the other end of the couch and put his head in his hands.
"All of NEW YORK? Jameson's still here, he's on TV," Spider-Man said dubiously. "They probably didn't want him."
"Doom. He likes blonds," Clint grumbled, glancing past Bruce at his lookalike, then to Bruce. His eyes were the same—sky blue and sharp. "Are YOU okay? Your beard's getting long," the archer added with a smirk.
"The Hulk went on two rampages yesterday—BOTH because of me." He stepped closer, shrugging. "He's usually under control, except for yesterday, when he was going berserk." The archer stared at him. "Is he going to throw me through a wall when he comes back?"
What a vacation, Steve thought bitterly, swiping his hair back from his face. They’d waited for almost half an hour by his best guess, and the weather had only gotten worse.
Quietly, he glanced Tony’s way, giving him a look. Then he turned back to Wade, pulling on a careful smile.
“Here you go. You know, the kid’s brilliant, but I hear he’s also really bad about turning in homework, so his grades probably don’t look so great to those colleges. That helping people part is more important to him than some math test, I guess.”
It seemed like Tony knew about Peter and his boyfriends, but did he know about the super senses?
"But it isn't raining, Peter," his aunt said, chuckling.
Faking a smile the moment the question was asked, Cap slapped a hand on Peter’s back in return and shook his head.
There was no reply from Steve.
"That's...probably the first and last time anybody will ever call me 'cool'," he said, offering a smile to show he wasn't taking it too seriously. "I figured after watching me when I'm in my room, you would rather spend time with just about anybody else."
Unsticking his hand, Peter sighed and took a step back from the blond, pushing on his chest to put some space between them.
The screaming crowds had stampeded down the street, pushing the baby's stroller away from its mother and onto a slope. It had rolled away...downhill and into the side of a dumpster. The screen faded to black as the baby's eyes glowed red and it gnawed right through the stroller's straps...
Bruce was starting to wake up a little; the rain was pretty cold. He ran his fingers through his hair, trying to wipe wet bangs away from his forehead, and offered a weary little smile.
The scientist blinked sleepily from the other end of the bench, where he had leaned back and passed out for awhile, and looked at his watch dully.
Snagging his arm, Steve pulled him gently back over, whispering, “Speaking of Peter, did you hear what he and Wade were saying?” The big blond sighed and shook his head. “I’m not sure that Wade likes Peter the way that Peter likes him.”
If one of his whack job super villains in animal suits followed him up this mountain, he swore he was going to web them up and throw them all the way back to New York. Or stick them to the side of some car traveling that way, at the very least. “Let’s just go down the trail a little bit and see if we see anything, okay?” He told Wade, starting that way without waiting for a reply.
Bruce sighed, bowing his head a little more. He must have been really out of it for leaning on Clint's shoulder to look this appealing.
Bruce sighed heavily and combed his fingers through his hair, trying to get it to stay out of his face.
"Uh, thanks Bruce, but you don't look so hot yourself." Loki pulled on a smile, trying to catch the laziness of Hawkeye’s expressions.
Puffing out a sigh, Clint rested his head against the balcony bars and stared down at the people on the beach. That tall blond guy had changed course while Clint was lost in thought land. Now the man was stopped below the balcony, big blue eyes looking excitedly up at Hawkeye.
"Sharks are more active near twilight," Bruce replied mildly, running his hands over Clint's back. It stung a bit; maybe the sunscreen could've happened a LITTLE sooner. Too late now, though. "Maybe we'd better go return the metal detector before they come looking for us?"
"I wonder if that was all over town or if Tony rigged something up."
The only person not on the beach was Hank and Clint had seen the man retreating into his own cabin last.
Thor pulled Tony right into the hug, too, though, patting them both on their backs cheerfully.
Swallowing nervously, Wade slung an arm over Peter’s shoulders and coughed loudly.
Loki paused in his speech, wriggling his hands. He looked up at Bruce, who had burning green eyes. Loki had seen those eyes before!
To Peter’s surprise, Hawkeye went willingly and both blonds charged off of the trail into the trees.
"Careful, the hallway's got rubble in it," Bruce said tiredly.
Without waiting for Loki to respond, Thor held up Mjolnir and effortlessly made the rain and clouds roll away. Several golden sunbeams shone through on the drenched ground.
“Better—I brought trail mix with chocolate bits in it.” Unslinging his backpack, Peter unzipped the top and pulled out a big bag, handing it to Clint. It looked like a mix of fruit and nuts, but there were bright colorful candy pieces all over the place as well.
The blond followed, blanket flowing behind him like a cape. He seemed pleased. Leaning over to nab a pizza, he waved at Thor.
"Look, let's just keep our feelings to ourselves," Loki said at last, hugging the blanket as insecurely as he could. Maybe he could muster a tear or something and really make his brother upset!
Slowly, Cap looked between the two of them with obvious worry.
“Was that for me or for Hulk?” The brown-haired man smirked at him.
"Yes, but have you captured one before?"
Of course, Clint thought angrily. It had seemed WAY too convenient.
“Ah, let me make a guess…Loki?”
"We don't know that. Don't let it get to you--deep breath, right?" Bruce patted his shoulder.
He had it covered, though. He really did.
Loki froze, cowering back from Thor, then reaching a hand out, he mustered his best sad face.
"Oh." Clint's eyebrows dropped suddenly. "That. Um." He glanced around the room.
Hurrying to plug the green back in, Steve grimaced.
“Fishing, I guess?” Tony offered. Thor really hadn’t sounded like fishing was what he was planning, but Clint seemed convinced that was all Bruce would want to do. Tony was sort of expecting to hear the Hulk roaring from the lake shore any moment now. Maybe Thor wanted to spar with him, and had some plan to startle Bruce into transforming. Tony honestly had never seen the big blond that excited to go off with Bruce alone, and it still struck him as just plain odd.
“Should we just tell them? What’s the worst he could do, Hulk out again?”
“ME?”
“This was a bad idea.”
"Hey Spider-Man, this is Carol. We're currently under lock down due to…” She trailed off. “What do you need?"
"That's why I'm here to keep an eye on you." He patted Bruce's shoulder reassuringly. It was then that Bruce noticed that Clint had slowly gotten closer over their conversation. He now sat right in front of the scientist, having scooted the donuts aside when he sat up. With another pat on his shoulder, Clint flashed him a grin. "Don't worry about it. I'll keep you out of trouble."
Tony exchanged a glance with Cap.
Dropping the kayak, Steve hesitated to move around to lean it on the rocks, especially since it was right next to Tony. Slowly circling the kayak to hoist it up against the rocks, he frowned.
Pepper blinked as one of the Iron Man gloves buzzed to life and hovered over to her.
"No dashing off to Tony."
Cap slid down the wall where he had been slumped, settling onto the floor instead.
“Huh? I don’t see any monster down there,” he told Clint, still scanning the view for a hint of it.
"You should both get some rest. This isn't something that will be done in fifteen minutes—Doctor Doom is a brilliant scientist. I'll need some time to reverse engineer what he made and see if the sample Captain America brought back really is an antidote."
“Yeah… Sorry I said that,” Clint mumbled, cringing at the sting from the alcohol. “Honestly, I don’t even know you. I’d like to.”
“Yeah, yeah, dad,” Clint grumbled under his breath.
"Do you like it?"
At the rate those guys were going, they were probably using the horrible weather as an immediate problem to focus on so they could avoid actually having an honest conversation about each other.
Steve gave him an odd look, thankfully going back to making noodles.
Of course, it was still very dark. The arrow in the medical room and the lightning outside were the only sources of light. Loki squinted ahead of them. Where was the archer's room, anyway?
The fake Shield agent pulled his hand away like Thor might grab it.
Pulling out the card, the web-slinger pressed the activation point on it and watched it light up.
The blond had yet to see Clint or anybody else, and hollering a few times hadn't yielded any results.
"It was a chemical bomb in an office building. Obviously a trap." He sighed, but it came out more like a dry gasp. "We have to find a way out of here before Doom comes to check on us."
“Amen to that.” Matt toasted him with the mug and took a sip.
"Said you should give it to me yourself," Bruce continued, bemused. "H-he seems embarrassed for some reason."
The Hulk growled something under his breath and gave the shield one last glare before heading for the door.
“Uh, you know you’re on the wrong side of the lake, right?”
"Is he...?"
Crossing his arms, Cap surprised Peter when he nodded.
"Hey buddy," Clint breathed, shivering and sinking into the blankets. "Brr. You're letting all the..." The blond fell silent, blinking hard up at Bruce. "Wh—" Hawkeye sat up suddenly, scooting away from his friend and falling off the bed—taking all of the covers with him.
Tony snorted in amusement.
“I’ll take full responsibility for Wade.”
"Friends!" Thor's booming voice sounded just moments before the sky flashed bright with lightning. A deep grumbling roll of thunder sounded not more than a few seconds afterward.
Spider-Man cautiously stepped back over closer to the two since they weren't attacking each other at the moment.
"We get it," Tony interrupted drolly, stepping up and crossing his arms. "How'd you go from there to inside the trunk?"
“Yeah, I think it’s more of a group thing, Cap.” Tony kept his voice low but still interrupted the peaceful quiet, plunking down in the mud beside him and resting an elbow on the rock. Propping his chin on his hand, Steve’s fiance frowned distantly, like he was looking at some memory. “You know we missed his birthday? It was last month. He didn’t say a word about it, but he’s 18 now.”
Cap frowned, saying softly, "Not s-since two days ago. Might b-blame Hawkeye. Pancakes…were t-terrible." It was a toss up if the pain on his face was from thinking back on the pancakes or the gas damaging his lungs.
"Hey, I think it's done," Loki pointed out, nodding to the vial.
Hawkeye shakily pulled an arrow from his quiver.
“They…Lady hitting on you? Boyfriend?” Absently chucking the lighter into the now lit paper towel, Wade took a long step to stand chest to chest with Spidey. His eyes narrowed and he leaned down to look Peter in the eye suspiciously. No comment, just the look.
“I'm fine,” Cap said quickly, turning away from Tony. “I think the cure is working.”
Tony snorted in amusement, gesturing to his bedraggled hair and clothing.
"...I'm gonna run some more tests," he said, glancing at the Clint in pajamas and then back to T-shirt Clint. "It's possible Doom did something—Cap and Pepper said he spent the most time alone with you."
Loki couldn't think of any better excuse. He needed to be alone for a few seconds so he could muster the power to teleport. Then he could be gone without anyone knowing that he was ever there. Even the annoying computer was offline. The last thing he wanted was to be dragged around like a toy.
Steve shot past Tony, swimming quickly over to bob at Thor’s side.
"Very well."
Holding hands was nice. Would a kiss cross the line?
"Yeah. Something like that," Clint agreed.
Thor had turned and promptly headed out the door after Hawkeye. Maybe he didn’t want the new Hawkeye to be alone with Tony.
"H-Hawkeye, give him a hand," Tony grumbled. "C'mon, Cap's suffering." Having everyone in one room was chaotic.
Snickering to himself, he made his way out of the alcove and looked both ways up and down the beach.
Bruce squished the marshmallow between his fingers, but didn't actually move to eat it.
“Oh no, I just… Well, you seem familiar but I guess I’d remember meeting someone like you.”
"What's so wrong...with men? You're one!" Tony said, waving in his general direction for emphasis. He put his hand over his chest, casting big shadows on the walls as the Arc reactor was half-covered. "And, I don't have 'sensibilities'. 21st century's about doing...doing whatever you...please..."  He closed his eyes and slumped back down. Whatever. He didn't have the energy to follow Steve or even sit up right now. Peeking at Cap, he saw the blond was actually blushing.
"Hello?" He called, carefully stepping around the glowing fires in the smoke. The flames had spread quickly through the office building, blazing through the piles of papers and the bits of furniture that were flammable. Steve squinted, able to see someone across the room.
Thor’s eyes twinkled at that, and he grinned.
"You guys are freakin' me out. Why in the world would you think I'm not me?"
"Oh, come on," Tony grumbled as he climbed down from the hammock, turning back to face the redhead. "You can't tell me you have no reason to hang around Peter besides keeping Wade in line. Seems like that's a handy excuse for you, but we're not stupid--we both see the way he looks at you." He shot Cap a glance, trying to do like the blond man always did and be on-task when the conversation was about anybody else's problems.
"Thanks," Peter said with a winning smile, taking the offered sweet treat. Double chocolate was an awesome habit to have. Cap was pretty awesome in general, though.
The bedroom he chose on the right looked exactly like it had in the photos--a nautical-themed room with driftwood wall decor, round porthole-style windows, and a hammock in two of the four corners set at an angle. Tony moved over to the nearest wall and sat the suitcases there to lean against it, sighing in relief.
"I-I...said green...didn't I?" He groaned. "Blue. BLUE."
Thor tilted his head.
Loki moved closer again, holding his side where the arrow was still stuck.
“I don’t say your name a lot, Tony,” Cap chuckled, cutting himself off abruptly as he noticed that he HAD been saying ‘Tony’ a lot. Lost in thought, he shrugged a shoulder.
Forcing his eyes back to meet Tony’s gaze, Steve felt his throat tighten again.
"NO! Don't leave meee!"
"There are a lot of bugs in hot climates," Tony said, shrugging. "This's practically the tropics. But Hank does science every day--and listen, if I can leave my armor and business and high tech smart house for a week, he live without mapping bug genomes for that long! Am I wrong?"
That sounded nice. Together.
“Oookay, which trail did they go up?” Matt asked, getting to his feet and shucking the blanket.
Cap crossed his arms and watched them go, turning instantly to look at Peter with disappointment.
“I don’t see them…” That couldn’t be good, either.
"Wow, what manners," Peter joked, swinging in to perch on the frame of the porch behind him. He looked at the door expectantly.
A voice answered Thor’s, loud and clear over their hushed conversation.
Cap paused just inside the door, sliding his arm off of Tony's shoulder.
Loki snickered. It was time to move to plan C: get the Hulk to break open a big hole and then jump out while everyone was distracted. Right. That would work. Why did the voice in the back of his head say that it was a bad idea, then?
Now just wasn't a good time.
The Hulk poked Loki's shoulder with a big finger.
“When do you think the power will come back on?” The question wasn't really aimed at anyone. He was tired...wait. Glancing down the cold pills still in his hand, he shook his head. He had completely spaced getting those or even taking them. The archer hopped down and went to find a glass of water. “I'll be right back, Bruce. You thirsty?”
Slowly, Steve blinked, trying to gather his thoughts. After everything they’d been through together, he hadn’t been Tony’s choice. Maybe that was why Tony had been so offended by the article? It wasn’t that he was insulted the press assumed he was queer—it was who they thought he was sweet on.
"I jest, my friends! Of course you're getting along well--I happened upon you this morning and you seemed quite amiable indeed!" With a little smirk, he turned and headed off down the hallway for the cabin door.
"K-knock yourself out," Tony told Cap, voice wavering a little now. And there it was--a sniffle, an actual sniffle! Maybe the fumes just took longer to reach them over there. "I've got it covered in here..."
Wow, had he just went right along with Matt calling Cap and Tony his parents, just like that? He had.
Tony had almost eagerly accepted the idea of playing frisbee. It was probably his attempt to avoid talking to Steve anymore.
Tony shrugged.
“Yes, he’s Daredevil. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised the Avengers know that… And Wade knows about us,” he said, frowning. Pulling out a fresh roll of gauze, he took hold of Clint’s arm and started to wrap the stitches carefully again. “Matt knows about Wade, too. It’s a…” He shrugged. “A group kind of thing.”
"Wh-what's no, then? Flipping the bird?"
For a minute, the captain completely forgot that he outweighed Tony as he reached up and took the hands offered to him, leaning to stand up.
“That’s not the point and you know it!”
Wade slapped a hand onto the meat blob, sinking his fingers in and ripping the plastic off. He picked a piece of plastic off the top of the handful of raw hamburger he had before he started smashing it into a ball shape.
“He better not be,” Cap muttered, filling a soup pot full of water.
"Well, purple dude went outside anyway." The mercenary shrugged. "He's probably washed away with the whales by now." He made a little wave with his hand in the air.
“Stony sounds like we’re talking about rocks,” Peter said, smiling despite himself. Wade was so weird, but he was fun to be around. His heart was in the right place, too—he really seemed to want Cap and Tony to get together already. Like most everybody else on this vacation…
"This is most disturbing," Thor commented, watching the screen with wide eyes. Evidently cannibal monster babies were something they didn't have in Asgard.
“Do you know if Bruce has a problem with anyone? Maybe Spider-Man?”
"Oh, really?" Tony glanced at Ms. Marvel, and Carol could practically see the smirk through his mask just from his tone of voice. "Do tell."
"What's going on around here?" She looked at Loki and sighed. "I better go find Cap and Tony." With that, she flew off into the hole in the side of the mansion.
“Um, we’d love to stick around and visit, but we should go put out our campfire so it’s not burning unattended,” he told Cap and Tony. It was a reasonable excuse. The responsible thing to do. How could they refuse?
"Ouch," Peter winced sympathetically, "Sorry Wade!"
“Want to help me unload the car?”
"The other guy almost attacked both of you," Bruce mumbled, heading over to check on Cap's cure.
"The edges of the wound seem weaker, but I still had to use the titanium needles Tony made for Captain America last time I did the stitches," Bruce said evenly. He placed a hand on Loki's side near the wound and then dabbed some of the alcohol around the edges as gently as he could. "This will sting—I'm sorry."
"I'll wait f-for Tony."
"You were just alone with Doctor Doom," Tony grumbled. "ANYTHING could happen. What if he brainwashed you, or you're actually a Doombot or something? BOTH of you can't be the real Clint, so somebody's an impostor—I wanna keep an eye on any impostors in my home base, thanks."
“Sometimes I forget just how much shit you’ve already lived through.” Tony reached over and brushed Steve’s hair back. “You’ve been through the Depression and World War II. And here I’ve been laboring under the delusional that you were a fragile kid who had barely lived at all.”
“War Machine was too violent I guess.” Tony shrugged. “It’s been rebranded as Iron Patriot.”
“Tony, I--” Luckily, at that moment, the food arrived. Tony had never been so fucking happy to see Indian food before in his life. Steve smiled at the server and let whatever he was going to say drop. Tony spent the next couple minutes pointing out all the dishes and describing them for Steve. And then they ate in silence for a while. Steve taking a little of everything and then going in for seconds on the things he really liked. Tony may or may not have been taking mental notes. Shut up.
“You said something about Chinese food?” Steve finally found his voice and wondered if he was the only one that could feel this. The air seemed thick. Too heavy to get a real, deep breath. It was all in his head. Just breathe normal you fucking idiot.
“And you Googled me?”
“Last night.” Bruce raised an eyebrow but Steve kept his mouth shut. Now that he was breathing normally again and had a better handle on the situation, he wasn’t about to volunteer information that was gonna get him tossed into a SHIELD psych ward with Clint.
When he tried to sleep the last couple nights, when he closed his eyes, it was Tony. Tony leaning in to kiss him, Tony touching the nape of his neck, Tony, Tony, Tony. And there went bag number two. Fuck. He could feel Johnny’s eyes on him but thankfully he said nothing. Steve stooped and picked up a third bag, hanging it up.
They finished their meal without any more deep, emotional conversation. And Tony had gotten out of it all without actually apologizing for anything. Thank fuck for that. As they waited for Happy to pull the car around, Tony checked his phone again. Three messages had jumped to eight. Damn. He better call her.
“I know.” He murmured, kissing the top of his head. “I know.”
“...Steve. A lot of what I said wasn’t about you either. That was all...” He did not wanna bring Howard into this. Not right now. Not without a drink. “That was my own shit. I know you were special before Rebirth.”
Now, normally Tony would not be worried about a stupid crush. Except, here’s the thing. He’s in a relationship. Like, an adult, serious, committed relationship. And Steve was Captain America. So this crush was problematic at best. And fucking catastrophic at worst. And Tony wasn’t making things easier on himself by inviting Steve out for shopping and lunch. It was by no means a date. Just two guys. Hanging out. Totally normal.
“Is this you talkin’ or is it Fury?”
“I’ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen.” Steve smiled wistfully. “Guys used to sing it in the bar all the time.”
“No. I don’t need Nick Fury to tell me that one of my roommates is depressed out of his mind with PTSD aggravating the symptoms.” Bruce crossed his arms over his chest. “I get why you’re wary about Fury. I am too. But I’m not Fury. And neither is Tony. You can trust us, Steve.”
“Thank you, sir.” Steve turned and left the conference room. The meeting was pretty much exactly as he had expected. Washington, DC had been a bit of a surprise. But then again, where better to have a shadowy, government agency? The FBI, the CIA, and SHIELD. Each one more secretive than the last. Still, Fury had a point. What was Steve going to do otherwise? He couldn’t stay at the Tower forever.
“Relax, Steve. It’s the name of a Star Trek episode. One of my favorites, in fact. Now, keep in mind this show is from the 60s so it’s a little dated by today's standards.”
“Steve, we’ve all been there. We all seen shit nobody should have to see. And we all did things that nobody should have to do. You know how many nights I laid awake, shitfaced, planning my suicide? Too many. I still have guilt about makin’ it out of there when so many people didn’t. And we all had to work through it. You can’t just push it all down and pretend it happened 70 years ago to someone else. It happened to you and it happened six weeks ago.”
“Yeah, you do. You gotta deal with your shit and I gotta deal with mine and Bruce has to deal with his. We all have shit. But maybe what we need is each other. You jump, I jump.”
“What time are you running to Brooklyn? Cuz I feel like you’re here when I get up.”
Steve shrugged out of his jacket and tossed it to the other couch in the room. They were just two friends, enjoying each other's company, watching tv. Do not be weird about this. Of course, that was easier said than done. Steve stood from the couch and took stock of the room. The large window that Loki had thrown Tony through was fixed. No more broken glass glittering on the floor. Speaking of the floor, for whatever reason, Tony had not fixed the large dent and crumbling tiles where Hulk had...well...smashed Loki.
“I think it’s the whole, I’m also her boyfriend thing that gets her a little cranky.”
“Did you forget about lunch?” Pepper at least sounded slightly amused. Good. Less pissed off and more vaguely irritated.
“And how did it feel?”
“How long since your last confession?” The priest’s voice was rough with age and Steve felt like he was 8 years old again. Kneeling in the same confessional, dark and stuffy as it had been the last time he had been here.
“Not all of it. Not enough of it. Personally, I find the idea that God should hate anyone simply for who they are deplorable. And I do my best to teach a message of love and acceptance and forgiveness.” Steve didn’t know why, but he felt his eyes burn with unshed tears. “My son, it is not forgiveness from the Lord that you need. But forgiveness for yourself. You must forgive yourself for surviving. You must forgive yourself for your impure thoughts. God has already forgiven you. He simply waits for you to forgive yourself and accept His love and forgiveness.”
“I had the honor of meeting General Patton.” Steve glanced over at Tony. “He was a great military mind. And a son of a bitch.”
Steve rested his head against the punching bag. He was tired of hearing this crap. When would everyone just drop it already? This was his life and his shit and he didn’t need everyone telling him how fucked up he was. As if he didn’t know. Like he wasn’t the one with the perfect memory, reliving it all over and over again.
“I hear you’re spending a lot of time with him.” Fury leaned back in his chair. “Moved into that godawful building and everything.”
When he finally got his vision back, it was to find Tony with his sweatpants around his thighs and his own cock in his hand. No, this was the moment Steve wanted to remember forever. Tony Stark, his pants around his thighs, his cock hard and straining in his hands, jerking off to the image of Steve coming.
“Can I hug you?”
“You’re up early.” Johnny took a drag from his cigarette and offered it to Steve. He took it and held it for a moment before he took a drag himself.
“Do not say He works in mysterious ways. Even if it’s true, it’s bullshit. God doesn’t work in mysterious ways. He’s just a vindictive son of a bitch.” His mother she would have slapped him upside the head for using language like that in a church.
“Tell me.” He could hardly breathe. He really was dying this time.
“You listen to me, Steven Grant Rogers...” Steve couldn’t help but laugh. And then Tony lifted his head off his shoulder and took Steve’s face between his hands. “I don’t give a shit if the world needs you. I need you.” Tony’s voice faltered. “We...we need you. And don’t gimme this crap about you can’t make peace. You are the glue that holds this stupid team together. I couldn’t. And Fury sure as hell can’t. So the world needs you, the Avengers need you. I need you.”
“I don’t have to.”
“God, that is adorable.” Steve shoved his hand in his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. He lit it and breathed out a sigh.
“The food has arrived just now, sirs.” Tony jumped up from the couch and jogged to the elevator. The doors opened and someone handed several bags to Tony.
“Oh.” Steve smiled at the poor, poor sales girl as he handed over the last of the clothes. “I guess that makes sense.” Did it? Tony had thought about that a lot over the last week or so. Was Pepper right to want him to quit the whole Avengers gig? Then again, weren’t relationships about compromise?
“Did you call for something in particular, Tony?” Steve started walking back to his bike. Tony was really going to be the death of him.
“That’s fair.” Fury leaned forward again, resting his elbows on the table. “Shall we cut to the chase, Captain?”
“I can’t say it’s my favorite place in the world.” Steve shrugged and tried not to think about moving to another city. He would be moving out of the Tower. Away from Bruce and Clint and Tony. Tony. Therein laid a huge problem. He wondered if that’s what Natasha meant. And if it was, how did she know?
“God, Steve.” Tony pushed his shirt up and Steve helped him pull it off. Once it was discarded, he pushed Steve down onto the couch. He leaned down and started kissing and sucking on Steve’s neck. His teeth scraped over his collarbone and his hips bucked up into Tony. “Fuck, look at you.”
“Steve.” Natasha leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. “I think we both know that’s not what I mean.” Steve looked away and couldn’t come up with an excuse before she started talking again. “Don’t think that I haven’t noticed. Hell, Bruce has noticed. Clint would notice if he were around to see it.”
“No, I’ll meet him there. Which floor?” Steve knew this was a bad idea. He had been running from Tony Stark for the last 36 hours. But it was either face the man and maybe get his mind off his other demons or lie awake and try not to think about how good Tony’s calloused hands would feel on other parts of his body.
“Barely managed to go to school most days. Never was a damn boy scout.”
“Bullshit, Steve. You think Bruce only cares about you when you’ve got the uniform on? You think Romanoff only cares about you when you’re tossing her onto alien hover bikes? You think I would take Captain America shopping over you?”
“I feel like you promised you were going to stop zoning out on me, soldier.” Steve dragged his eyes back up to meet Tony’s. He was watching Steve and the upper half of his body was leaned towards Steve. “Are you even dealing with it?”
“Can you tell me where you are?” Bruce took his wrist and looked at his watch.
“You’re full of surprises, Steve Rogers.” Tony gave a teasing grin. “Who knew you were such a little punk?
New turned out to be Indian food. A little hole in the wall that Tony had found years ago. Steve had looked at the menu, a bit bewildered, before Tony simply ordered one of everything. Probably the best way to go about finding what he does and doesn‘t like. Though why Tony had decided that was his job was a mystery. Okay. Not much of mystery. The slight scrunch of Steve’s nose as he took a sip of his Coke. Fuck.
God, what the fuck had they just done? Tony was still with Pepper. Still moving back to Malibu. Still Tony Stark. And Steve was still a kid from Brooklyn. Still probably moving to DC. Still wanting to keep Tony all to himself.
“Mm, lucky for me.” Steve stepped closer before moving to the side. “Always next time.” He moved to the punching bag hanging from the ceiling. It was nothing like the old, beat up ones at Johnny’s. This was covered in sleek, soft black leather. Steve ran a hand up the surface and knew if he broke this bag, he might not be able to replace it.
“Yeah, Steve?” Steve looked down at Tony and honestly had no idea what he wanted to say. Nothing he could think of was remotely acceptable. He wanted to wrap himself up in Tony. Lay down and just sleep with his warm presence and embrace. Cross those few, too few inches between them and taste the coffee on his tongue. Instead, Steve reached up and laid his hands over Tony’s and squeezed.
“Touch me. Want you...want you to touch me. Make me come.” He watched Tony’s eyes darken and felt his cock twitch.
“Well, he was freaking out. So yeah, it was urgent.” Tony gently pushed Steve down onto the bench and released his hands. Steve looked down at his hands, still shaking.
“Well, if Pa taught me anything, it was that you gotta do what you have to survive.” Steve shrugged and leaned his shoulder into the couch to better face Tony but still be comfortable. “When Ma died, we were still in the middle of the Depression. Buck and I took whatever jobs we could find.”
“...Not sleep, drink, and hug?”
“Sorry, Tony. Guess I’m not really all here.” Steve swirled the amber liquid in the glass. Most of the time he felt that he wasn’t all here. Part of him was here. Part of him was back in 1943. Back in the freezing cold winters of Europe. The roar of the planes. The crunch of the ice and snow under the tanks. The Commandos huddled around him for warmth like he was a bonfire. Bucky’s bloodshot eyes stared off into the distance.
“They talk to you about it?” Steve downed the rest of his glass and set it aside. “Sorry, Tony. I’m just...” That hadn’t been particularly kind. Or tactful. In the few interactions they had, Steve knew Tony wasn’t really an open guy. That disarming smile did its job.
“Even the ones that are queer?” Steve challenged the priest. He would never admit it, but he waited for the answer with bated breath.
“Nope. I just finished lunch.”
“I don’t know, Steve...” Tony sighed and looked down at him. “I don’t know.”
“Hey Steve?” He opened his eyes and he swore Tony was closer than he had been only a moment ago.
“It isn’t a little...tight?”
“Well, no argument here.” Tony smirked and gently knocked the side of Steve’s head. “Still, it would be a pity to muck up that pretty, pretty face.”
“Look at me, baby.” Steve forced his eyes open to look up at Tony. “I want to see your face when I make you come.” And that was all she wrote. Steve came with a shout of Tony’s name, his back arching up off the couch. His orgasm was so intense, his vision blacked out. All he could do was hold on to Tony’s hips, groaning as he rode it out.
“Cap? Steve? You okay? JARVIS, what’s it look like?” It sounded muffled, like he was under water. Was he? Was he back under the ice? Or had he taken a bullet? Possible collapsed lung. Where was he? When was he?
“That is something that you must discover on your own. Have faith, son, and God will guide you through this.”
Steve could only do his best to try and keep up. When Tony tugged on his hair again, a lot less gentle this time, a spark shot down his spine and he gasped into Tony’s mouth. He gripped Steve’s ass and pulled him down into the crook of Tony’s legs. He was hard against Steve’s thigh and he didn’t think he would ever be capable of higher thought again.
“...Thank you, Father.”
“Why are you buying him clothes?”
“And did you take it?”
“I know you don’t wanna see a therapist. And I get that. Believe me. But...Bruce is right. We’re here for you. You can talk to us. We care about you.”
“Huh? Oh! No! I just...I hadn’t seen the new leather jacket we got you in action yet. It uh...it looks really good on you. With the bike and the hair and the cigarette. You look like a greaser out of West Side Story.”
“Take a seat, Captain.” Fury gestured to the chair across the conference table from him. Steve eyed him for a minute before he sat down. “I appreciate you finally agreeing to meet with me.”
“The point is...she knew you were special long before the serum. And so did Dr. Erskine.”
“I don’t wanna put all of this on you, Tony. That isn’t fair. I gotta deal with this.”
“Captain Rogers last slept for approximately three hours two nights ago.”
“Hey, it’s a nice ceiling.” Tony yawned. “Worked hard on that ceiling.”
“Steve?” He opened his eyes and God, Tony was so close. His warm, brown eyes were watching Steve and he couldn’t remember any of the stupid things he had just thought.
“Come on, you did not get in trouble with nuns.”
“Allow me, Captain.” The elevator started moving and Steve had to remind himself to breathe. God, why did it have to be Tony Stark? It seemed like he was destined to only want what he couldn’t have. And he could not have Tony. The man was in a committed relationship and they worked together in a fairly stressful work environment. Neither of them could afford to be distracted by the well-being of their boyfriend in the middle of a fight. There were too many reasons for why he couldn’t pursue Tony.
“Jump?” Steve opened his eyes and Tony grinned at him.
“New it is.”
“You worked in a bar?”
“Thanks, Tony.”
“Sorry, Tony. Promise I’ll stop doin’ that.” Steve took the glass handed to him.
“I thought you two didn’t get along?”
“Did we?” Steve sat back in his chair. “Bruce seemed pretty sure of what he was saying. Maybe he didn’t wanna say it but...he meant it. I guess I meant it too. But not about you.” Fuck. Shit. Shit. Goddammit. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Tony was going to have to actually apologize. Because apparently Steve had taken what Tony said in that stupid lab to heart. Apologies were not his thing. He apologized to Pepper once in all the time he had known her. He made her a shitty omelet.
“Does it taste different?”
“Thank you.” Steve closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against Tony’s.
“The what?” Steve stared at him with wide eyes and Tony chuckled.
“You’re so pretty when you curse.” Tony mumbled against his skin. “Do it again. Do it again for me, baby.” He twisted his wrist and Steve cried out.
“You know, Pa fought in the Great War. He was in the trenches. He never talked about it. And when I was a kid, I didn‘t get it. He couldn‘t hold down a job. Ma had to work extra shifts just to make ends meet.” Steve laughed and took a drink. “Not sure I ever understood it until...” Until Bucky fell off a train. “War changes people. You gotta do things that you never thought you would or could do. Pa had trenches and gases and tanks. We had planes and Hydra and...nuclear weapons. Howard helped make the bomb, didn’t he?”
“Kid, maybe you should go home and try to sleep. You remember sleep right?”
“Tony? Is he okay?” Bruce jogged into the room. “JARVIS said it was urgent.”
“You’re dismissed, Captain.”
“I couldn’t stay in Brooklyn, sir. Just wasn’t the same.”
“I don’t know, Nat.” He leaned back against the sticky booth and crossed his arms. “I enlisted to fight Nazis. I didn’t mean to...become some symbol or anything more than just another enlisted private. This was never what I wanted to do with my life.”
“I guess so. I just...you know, that stuff I said on the Helicarrer--”
“The bar I used to work in. Off of 3rd in Bay Ridge. Bunch of first-generation Irish immigrants. Get off of work and come in to get drunk.”
“Can I hug you? I feel like I wanna hug you.”
“You aren’t sad and pathetic. I just want to point out that there’s no reason to stay here. Not really. Tony is with Pepper and I think he intends to stay that way. And he’s going back to Malibu before Christmas.” Steve felt a weight in his chest.
“Somehow I’m not convinced.” Tony set his glass down and leaned toward Steve. “...SHIELD talk to you about seeing a therapist?”
“Hey, Steve Rogers doesn’t run from a fight. I know I’m not Bucky or Peggy but I’ve got your back. Okay?” Tony rubbed his cheekbones with his thumbs and Steve closed his eyes.
“Hey, Steve.” Bruce gave him a gentle smile. His hair was haphazard and his glasses were crooked. “How’re you feeling?”
“Yeah, get a couple hours of sleep.” Steve managed to smile and he hoped it was convincing. He had no plans of going back up to bed. Not now. He needed to get out and run. Run as far and as fast as he could. Ma always used to tell him he couldn’t run from his problems. And he never did. Until now. Until this century. Steve couldn’t fight these problems in a back alley. Bucky wasn’t going to jump in and help him. This was more than he could handle.
“I don’t blame him.” Steve took the drink from Tony who looked at Steve like he had grown a second, Chitauri head.
“I was never a Boy Scout.” Steve turned back to walk into the dressing room and Tony thought it should be illegal for such an innocent phrase to sound so dirty. That was probably just Tony reading too much Captain Kirk into it but still.
“Steve, honey, we have a gym here.”
“Forgive me, Director, but I disagree. Any team that hopes to have a chance at success needs to build a bond, a trust. That doesn’t happen overnight.”
“I just wanted to see how your meeting went.” Natasha pushed the call button for the elevator. “Fury offer you the job in DC?”
“Why not? I think you would make an excellent lumberjack.” The doors to the elevator opened and Tony grabbed his hand again and pulled him into the penthouse. “A full beard, plaid flannel, those clunky hiking boots. God, all over the country, ovaries are exploding at the mere thought.”
“Tower.”
“Old, familiar, vintage. You know, pizza, burgers, hot dogs on Coney Island. Or new. Sushi, ramen, pho, fusion cuisine. Shwarma.”
“Do you know who I am?”
“Be nice. Clint is having a rough time.” Steve mimicked throwing the shield. “I don’t know, Tony. I feel like it’s gonna tear if I move too fast...”
“Well it’s my pleasure, Cap.” Like playing dress up with a Ken doll. “And I’m not really as busy as I say I am. I just want people to think I am. Like Fury.”
“Hey, all troubled water under the bridge, Cap.” Tony waved it off. He did not want to talk about this again. That whole scene had been ugly. Everyone had been. Except Thor. He was just kinda...there.
“You’re such a good Boy Scout.”
Breathe, darlin’. You’re all right. His mother’s voice when she would hold him through a coughing fit. He took a deep breath.
“We don’t know yet.” This was a stupid idea. What had Steve expected to get out of this? Peace? Calm? “But whatever the purpose is, you have every right to be alive.”
“Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.” Steve automatically crossed himself. Guess his muscle memory was pretty impressive too.
“You’re beautiful. So fucking beautiful. And you look even better with teeth marks.” Tony leaned down again and bit his collarbone. Steve cried out and his hips jerked up again. His jeans were uncomfortably tight as his cock leaked precome. He cursed Tony for buying him new, tight fitting jeans. “So sensitive, aren’t you baby...”
“What are you talking about? You look great!” Tony waved his hand at him. Steve raised an eyebrow.
“No. I uh...I was walking around my old neighborhood actually.”
“Haven’t you heard? That’s the look now. Have you not seen all of Clint’s outfits? Has to show off his arms all the time. Like, we get it. You’re useful.” Tony rolled his eyes and Steve chuckled.
“If only Fury knew that his paragon of truth, justice, and the American way could suck cock like a pro.”
“Are you coming to the point, Director?”
“I think that might be cheating.”
Steve got his hands under Tony, running his hands up his back to his shoulders. He lifted Tony off of the couch and pulled him forward into his lap. Tony broke from the kiss in a loud groan as their cocks lined up together.
“Don’t worry about it. Sit.” Tony pushed him onto the couch. “I’m gonna change really quick. Make yourself at home. And stop looking like you shouldn’t be sitting on the furniture or something.” Tony disappeared into the bedroom and Steve sighed.
“Can you imagine something that you helped create, destroying so many lives?”
“Whatever you want.” Tony moved into his space and Steve was surprised at the sudden gentler tone. “Be a docent at a museum, take up sculpting, decide to be a concert pianist.” Tony cupped the side of his face and Steve leaned into the touch. “You have to stop letting the world decide what you can or can’t do.”
“...You’re welcome, Steve.” Tony tightened his grip in his hair and for a moment, Steve wondered if Tony wanted to kiss him too. But no, of course not. Tony Stark is a brilliant, successful engineer with a beautiful girlfriend. What would he need to waste time with Steve for? Tony was a friend, a good friend. And Steve just needed to be okay with that and let this whole, stupid crush go. Just breathe and let it go.
“Thanks, Bruce.” Steve nodded. Bruce gave his shoulder a squeeze and walked out of the gym. Steve and Tony stood in silence for a couple minutes before Tony spoke.
“Of course, sir.”
“I wouldn’t know.” Steve sounded slightly amused and Tony had to resist the urge to smile. “I’m...not sure how I feel about this one...” He glanced down at the outfit Tony had picked out for him.
“Fuck.” Steve gasped harshly into Tony’s neck, dropping his forehead down onto his collarbone. Tony had pushed a thigh between his legs and had both hands on his hips now. His fingers dug into the denim at Steve’s hips as he tried to guide Steve into riding his thigh the way Tony was riding his.
“I’m not not happy, Tony. I just wish you had remembered that we were supposed to have lunch and maybe called me.”
“Absolutely. You’re 90, not a hipster.” Tony dropped his phone back in his pocket and grinned at the look of confusion on Steve’s face. “I‘ll point them out to you. Let’s drop those at the front and we’ll have them sent to the Tower.”
“Sure thing, Cap. Can’t let you go hungry, now can I?” Tony settled back on the couch once he had finished opening all the bags and little, white boxes. “All right, J, queue up The Naked Time.”
“Tell me to stay.” Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s shoulder. “Tell me stay here. Tell me you need me and you can’t possibly do this by yourself.”
“Scouts honor?”
“I’m always up for a challenge.” Steve felt like he was doing his best statue impression. He didn’t want to move away from Tony but he also couldn’t get closer. Purgatory. His mother was always right.
“Listen, Cap--”
“My son...God hates the sin, not the sinner. And just as all men are created equally, so are their sins. Sin does not exist on a spectrum. The lie you told to your mother as a child is the same as the impure thoughts you have for this man. A sin is a sin. And Jesus Christ was crucified to pay for all sin. Not just the sins that most of Christianity find palatable.”
“Nothing like the lives of the rich and the famous.” Steve stood as well. “I’ve already seen poor Bruce splashed all over the news and people trying to suss out who Black Widow and Hawkeye are. Just think, soon you’ll be on page two.”
“Didn’t you just say stock was up?”
“Please.” Steve wanted to take the word back as soon as it left his lips. Tony didn’t say anything, just moved into his space and wrapped his arms around Steve.
“...Our lunch?”
“I think new.” He smiled then and it was different than the polite smile he had given the gawking sales people. It reminded Tony of the first time he had ever seen Steve smile. When Tony had woken up to see Captain America hovering over him. Except it hadn’t been Captain America. It had been Steve Rogers. Tony was starting to understand that they weren’t always one and the same.
“Yeah. She said it was a nice song but you couldn’t dance to it.” He smiled sadly and sighed. “Anyway, it was good. The show I mean. I liked it.”
“I’m putting together a new Strike Team. And I want you in charge.”
“You ever gonna talk about it?” Johnny leaned against the wall beside Steve.
“Tough talk?” Tony turned and raised an eyebrow. Steve walked toward him and smirked, cocking his head to the side.
“This is Tony.” Usually, Steve would be thankful to hear his voice. But after hearing that Tony would be leaving... “You out breaking more punching bags? Meeting with Fury that bad?”
“Yeah?” This felt so much different than huddling close to Bucky or Dum to keep warm. It felt...intimate. Steve almost laughed aloud at the thought. As if he would know what intimacy felt like.
“What is?”
“...Has Tony noticed?”
“Thank you, Tony.”
“I would appreciate that, sir.”
“He gave me a few weeks to think it over.”
“You bet your sweet, tight ass I’m gonna make you come.” Tony moved down his body so he could unbutton and unzip his pants. Steve lifted his hips to aid in the removal of his jeans. Tony pulled them and his boxer briefs off in one tug. Steve kicked them off and pushed them to the other end of the couch.
“Yeah. I bet.” He didn’t really know how to answer that. Deflect. Evasive maneuvers.      “You settling into the Tower all right?”
“Steve...even you have your limits. You need to sleep.”
“I’m not sayin’ that what he did was right, Tony. It wasn’t. And I’m not makin’ excuses for him either. All I’m sayin’ is that...you gotta find a way to deal with the things that you did. You have to find a way to keep going on. Whatever that looks like.” Steve finished his drink too and set the glass down. “And it ain’t always pretty. And some men don’t find a way to keep going. Some just...lay down their arms and quit fighting.”
“Steve, honey...” Tony hesitated and the pet name thing was slowly killing Steve as well. “You can’t go to DC. They would chew you up and spit you out.”
“I used to tell Peggy that if her name was Kathleen, it could be our song.”
“Sure. Why not?”
They hadn’t talked about or made any mention of the kiss since it had happened. But Steve noticed that Tony no longer hesitated when he went to touch him. And Tony was very touchy. They were all simple, friendly touches but any time Tony touched him, Steve could feel his heart race. Tony surely didn’t mean anything by them. And Steve had to stop reading into things. The guy grew up in a different time than Steve. Two men holding hands wasn’t automatically gay or even a crime. Steve had spent a couple sleepless nights reading all about Stonewall and toxic masculinity and second wave feminism and the sexual revolution. It had been fascinating. And he was a little sorry to have missed it.
“Why does everyone think I was a boy scout?” Natasha laughed.
“The captain appears to be suffering from a panic attack brought on by severe post-traumatic stress disorder, Sir.”
Steve let himself drink Tony in like that first glass of whiskey. Slow, calculated. For all the drinks that Tony had he looked pretty damn lucid. Probably from a lifetime of drinking.  Even now, in the middle of the night, after a few drinks, Tony‘s eyes had a gorgeous spark. Always bright and curious. Maybe instead of concern for Steve, Tony just wanted to solve him. Like Steve was a new puzzle to be taken apart and put back together. Better and more efficient than he had been. Tony Stark, always improving on his father‘s legacy. Never to be outdone by Howard. His eyes trailed down to Tony’s lips. Lips usually curved in an arrogant smirk. But not right now. This was wrong. It was all wrong.
“Half?” Steve raised an eyebrow. “Try all of ‘em.”
“You never know.” Steve shrugged.      “Should always be prepared.”
“Nah, I run down to this gym in Brooklyn--”
“Church is still here. I swear Sister Agnes was glaring at me from the schoolyard.”
“Someone saw me struggling to use the computer at the library to find history books. They helped me with that and then said it would be faster to Google everything.”
“What else am I gonna do?” Steve had sort of resigned himself to this already. After his talk with Natasha.
“Yeah, Tony?”
“He didn’t tell you?”
“That’s not sayin’ a lot, Tony. Sometimes you don’t get up until the afternoon.”
“Don’t I feel special.” Steve smirked over at Tony. Damn. Why was this so easy? Steve should be stammering and falling all over himself. Why did Tony have to make this so easy?
“Well I got distracted by buying him new clothes.”
“Nope. Told myself that I would get over it.”
“Put on the suit. We’ll go a few rounds.” He really had not meant for it to come out as suggestive as he was afraid that it had. Oh, this was a bad idea. Tony raised his other brow.
“Think you gave up the playboy image when you started dating Ms. Potts.”
“Stay.”
Just breathe, Stevie. Bucky’s lazy drawl as he rubbed Steve’s back. Another deep breath.
“So, have you got a list going?”
“SHIELD doesn’t need Captain America and it sure as hell doesn’t need Steve Rogers.” He looked down at the floor. “Fury wants the public on his side and Captain America is perfect for that. But he needs the Security Council too. Steve Rogers fits the bill for the suits.”
“Only so much staring at the ceiling a guy can take.” Steve shrugged and went back to his book. An orphaned kid discovering he was actually more powerful than he thought. People said he should read it.
“Yeah?”
“I wish I could say I was surprised.” Steve sighed. “But even when I knew him, he loved to drink and work. Not a great combination for a father.”
“Nah. Super soldier, remember? Asphalt is no match for the thickness of my skull.”
“Tony...” He didn’t know what Tony heard in his voice but he seemed to understand. He stroked his hair again.
“Steve? Seriously, what is so damn funny?” Natasha sounded a little irritated. He looked up at her and started laughing all over again.
“Every time I look at it, it reminds me how soundly we all kicked his ass.” Tony’s voice came from behind him and he turned. Tony and traded in his jeans for more comfortable looking black sweats and his dirty tank top for a worn AC/DC t-shirt. He must have taken a quick shower too because his hair was damp and sticking up in different directions.
“I’m not--” Steve stopped himself. He was getting irritated. Deep breath. “I really am fine. I just need to eat breakfast.”
“Well, it’s definite now. A couple weeks before Christmas.” Natasha sighed. “Look, you’ve been through enough, Steve. I understand the appeal of Tony Stark. There’s a reason he has such an infamous reputation. I’m just trying to save you a little heartache. Move on from New York and from Stark Industries. Get a real fresh start.”
“Old? What is old lunch?“
“’Course. I’m taking it all out on the punching bags.” Steve wanted to reach over and brush the hair back from Tony’s forehead. He blamed the whiskey. Or the late hour. Maybe the fact that he hadn’t really had a decent nights sleep since before the war. But...it could also be the way Tony had been looking at him.
“I guess that’ll hafta be our next field trip.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck, still warmer than the rest of him from the touch of Tony’s hands.
“This is nice...” Tony tightened his grip around Steve and...nuzzled? Was Tony nuzzling his neck? Fuck. Steve closed his eyes and sighed.
“Are you telling me that Captain America cheats?”
“If it makes you feel better, they were Nazis.”
“You forgot playboy.”
“...He may have stopped by.” Johnny at least had the decency to sound apologetic. Steve gave the bag one, good punch and sent it across the room, split at the seam.
“Aside from the early bird specials?”
“Go in peace, my son.” Steve crossed himself and stood from the confessional. He remembered always being sore as a kid. It was hard on his bony knees to kneel for that long. But now he was only a little stiff from being hunched over in the small space.
“Yeah, yes...fuck, Tony.” Steve closed his eyes and arched his neck, tossing his head back. He felt teeth biting into his neck and he moaned, bucking his hips and fucking Tony’s fist.
“Do you anticipate fighting Doombots in jeans and a t-shirt?”
“I appreciate that but you should really see yourself.” Tony rolled his hips again and Steve arched his back.
“I’m fine. I appreciate your concern but--” Steve started to stand.
“I get out of the Tower. I get out every day.” Steve was trying for nonchalance. He wasn’t convinced he had nailed it.
“Not sure I’m ready to see Coney Island for the modern era just yet.” Steve opened the dressing room door and stepped out with his arms full of clothes. All of which Tony had picked out. “Are you sure you wanna buy all this?”
“Post-traumatic stress disorder.” Steve closed his book. No amount of magic was going to save him from this conversation. “Of course SHIELD wanted me to see a therapist.” They couldn’t exactly have a traumatized super soldier running around. In the middle of a mission and having a total breakdown because the sound of bullets took him back to the battlefields of France and Germany.
“Sure. I’ve got a whole new nightmare to keep me up at night.” Tony grinned at Steve. “Flying a nuke through a wormhole into space is pretty...” He trailed off and finished his drink.
“You’re not subtle at all, Steve. And while the kicked puppy look that you’re constantly giving Tony behind his back is adorable, it’s getting a little sad.”
“Well, it’s no New York City.” Natasha sighed and looked out the window, slightly foggy with years of grease build up. “But it might be better for you to be in a new environment. Maybe it wouldn’t feel like you were chasing the past while trying to live in the present.”
“Please what? Tell me what you want?” He was rolling his hips against Steve’s and yep, there went thought processes again.
“It’s a nice early morning run.” Steve shrugged.
Steve turned his attention back to the punching bag. Maybe he should try and get some sleep tonight. He wasn’t usually like this. It wasn’t Johnny’s fault that Fury wanted him to see a therapist. He wondered if Fury had convinced Tony to talk to him about it last night. Damn, was he so transparent that even Nick Fury could see Steve wanted something more from Tony? He hit the bag harder than he had meant to. No, Tony didn’t listen to Fury about anything. Their late night talk had been organic, if a little bizarre.
“...We all said things we didn’t mean.” Tony shrugged and wished he had never decided to take this guy out for lunch. This was way too...Too much.
“I’m pretty familiar with the thousand-yard stare, Steve.” Tony dropped back onto the couch, closer than he had been previously. “My buddy Rhodey has had his fair share of tours in the middle east.”
“Don’t know.” Steve looked up at Tony who was watching him, his arms crossed over his chest. The light from the arc reactor was still visible.
“No, I know. But...I want you to know that none of that really had anything to do with you.” Steve sighed and glanced around at the restaurant. “That was all me. I was angry and I took it out on the wrong person. When I read your file, I actually really admired what you had accomplished. I kinda hoped we would meet.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Messed that up I guess.”
“Lookin’ forward to it.” Steve watched Tony disappear back upstairs. He sighed and fought the urge to just fall back onto the couch. Out. He needed to run and clear his head. State of the art gym be damned. He was running to Brooklyn and he was gonna take all this out on some breakable punching bags. Steve couldn’t fight the painful, vivid memories or this wonderful but frustrating new feeling. And sleeping sure as hell wasn’t going to help. Steve heaved a sigh and dragged his feet to the stairs to go down to his floor. He should at least change his clothes.
“Yes...God, please...”
Tony straddled his thighs, still in his black sweatpants. Steve reached for him and ran his hands up his chest. The arc reactor was glowing in the dim light of the living room. Steve loved the way it made Tony’s face look. Casting shadows and making him even more beautiful. He felt Tony stiffen as he slowly traced around the reactor.
“I love that song.” Steve had mentioned when the crew of the Enterprise was safe once again and the screen had faded to black.
“It’s a sick irony. I should have died so many times and I never did. When I was a kid, when I was an adult, in the war. I wasn’t supposed to live to see my 21st birthday. And here I am. But people that should have lived long, happy, healthy lives are gone. Where is the good in that?”
“Funny, I was about to say the same about you.”  Steve handed the cigarette back to Johnny. “What are you doin’ here?”
“You just said it yourself. You cannot run from these things. The only thing to do is face them. I’ve had soldiers in my confessional for years now. They all run from the same things. The enemy, the gunfire, the humidity of the jungles of Vietnam, the biting winds of Germany and Russia, the scorching sands of Afghanistan. These things live within you. And you cannot run from yourself.”
“I’m sure you did, Tony.” Steve tried to focus on the words in front of him. And not the new and shiny distraction that was Tony Stark. He often thought that Tony embodied this new millennium so well. So well that he had invented a bright and shiny, flying suit of armor. Tony made Steve feel superfluous. He scrubbed a hand over his face and startled slightly when he opened his eyes to see a tumbler being held in front of him.
“It’s got built in sensors. Can track and record your movements and how much weight you’re putting behind your punches.”
“Is this your way of saying you’re sorry?” Steve lolled his head to the side to look at Tony. He sighed and grabbed both of their glasses.
“Sir?” JARVIS startled Steve as he stepped into the elevator. “Mr. Stark would like you to join him in the gym this morning if you are agreeable.” Steve hit the back of his head against the elevator wall. “Shall I tell him that you are going to rest?” Even JARVIS wanted Steve to go to sleep. Did he look as bone tired as he felt?
“You had lunch with Steve?”
“Yeah, yeah. ‘Course.” Steve forced a smile on his face and took a sip of the whiskey. It burned going down. Reminded him of the bombed-out bar he had taken refuge in after Bucky had fallen. He could still smell the smoke and the gun powder.
“You should take it.” Natasha crossed her arms. “I know after the Helicarrier, you aren’t inclined to trust SHIELD. But I think we need you, Steve.”
“Uh...y-yeah. Guess so.” How could he say no to that? Tony smiled and it wasn’t one of his patented Tony Stark smiles. It was bright and warm and genuine. He leaned into Steve and wrapped his arms around his neck. Steve hesitated briefly but placed his arms around Tony’s waist. It was awkward but so nice. The physical gesture was clearly something that neither of them were used to. But Steve found himself pulling Tony closer to him.
“Thanks, Johnny.” Steve finished the cigarette Johnny had given to him. He had never been much of a smoker. Especially before the war. But sometimes it helped to calm his nerves. Probably all in his head. But wasn’t everything these days? He sighed and dropped the butt to the floor.
“Sure, Cap. Let’s get some breakfast.” Tony gave Steve a smile. It was strained and tired but genuine. Steve glanced between Tony and Bruce but finally nodded. “All right. I hope you can cook cuz I sure as shit can’t. You coming, Bruce?”
“I like that.” Tony chuckled. “Field trip, that’s cute.” He yawned and Steve couldn’t help but smile. He was in so much trouble.
“I see. What brings you to confession today, my son?”
“It’s a night cap. Get it?” Tony smirked at him and Steve took the drink. “Come on, I don‘t even get a courtesy laugh? Night, Cap?” Steve huffed out a small chuckle.
“Who taught you how to Google? And who told you to Google me?”
“I have an eidetic memory, Tony. No amount of talking to a stranger is going to erase all that.” Steve shrugged and leaned back into the couch. “It felt like a waste of everyone's time.”
“I’m not saying that SHIELD is perfect or even the best place for you right now.” Natasha stirred her ice tea idly as she spoke. “But what else are you going to do? You could make SHIELD a better place, Steve.”
Tony. Therein lied the issue though. The whole reason Steve had jumped out of bed and ran from the Tower like it had spontaneously combusted. Maybe it had. He had found a life preserver floating in the freezing cold water of the Artic. But he knew that if he held on, they would both drown. He had to find his own way back to shore. Steve did his best to ignore the sound of the treadmill and the man on it. Gotta find his own pace and rhythm.
“Well let me know if you change your mind. Pepper accumulated a pretty decent list of psychiatrists after Afghanistan.”
“I get the feeling most faces are familiar to you.” She just smirked and pushed off from the wall. “What are you doing here?”
Steve reached back in his memories to church on Sundays. Purgatory. Limbo. A waiting place. Not hell but not heaven either. Not dead but not really alive. Maybe he had been in purgatory for the last 70 years. Maybe he had never made it out of the ice. Steve wasn’t sure if this made him feel better or worse. And he didn’t know how to feel about that either. It probably wasn’t a good sign. He should drag himself to a church. Could hear the damn priest now. How long since your last confession? Seventy-six years. Not since Ma died.
“I’ll pass. I have some more work to do. Save me some burned toast.” Bruce smiled at Steve and patted him on the shoulder. “We’re here for you. No judgement. What kind of team are we without our fearless leader?”
“I know this is gonna sound like cliched bullshit but...this gets better. And you’ll get through this. We all will.” Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist. This felt a lot different from their hug the other night. Maybe because they were standing this time. And Steve could feel the warm metal of the arc reactor pressed to his chest.
“It’s what I would do.”
“Steve? You all right?”
“God, Tony, please...” Steve didn’t know what he wanted. Aside from Tony. He knew that much. He wanted Tony and he wanted Tony to do anything he damn well pleased.
“Gee, however will I manage?”
This was it. His life had reached it’s pinnacle of absurdity. He had thought that happened 70 years ago. Or maybe even when he kissed Tony Stark and begged him not to go back to California. But no. It was here. A modern diner made to evoke nostalgia for an era he had never even lived through. A Russian spy that had defected to the United States. A product of a war he had not fought in. Music playing through the speakers that was considered old but was all new to him. And what did he want to do with his life?
“Why you keep running to this gym all the way from Manhattan at three in the morning to break my punching bags and drink my shit coffee.”
“...You think you’re up for it, soldier?” Tony moved into his personal space and, much like this moment on the Helicarrier, Steve didn’t know if they were talking about fighting anymore. Fondue, fighting, fucking...all the same to him apparently.
“No, you aren’t really. You aren’t even 30, Steve.” Tony got up on his knees, kneeling on the couch facing Steve. His other hand moved to his face too and Steve could hardly breathe. That thickness in the air was back only worse. Maybe he was dying. Maybe his 93 years were finally catching up with him. “Look at you. You’re still just a kid.”
“It’s a compliment. Trust me.” Tony grinned at him and reached up to ruffle his hair. “No helmet, Mr. Responsible?”
“And how am I supposed to learn how to live with this every day?” Steve hated the desperation in his voice.
“Tony is so egotistical and self-absorbed he wouldn’t notice if you stripped naked in front of him and covered yourself in whipped cream.” She reached out and gently laid a hand on his arm. “You’re pining for the very wrong person here.”
“Cheating? You think that I would use that information to try and best you in a fight?” Steve turned to see Tony put his hand to his heart and shake his head. “I am shocked that you think so little of me, Cap.”
“We were having lunch?” Pepper sighed on the other line. Vaguely irritated was very into annoyed.
“The footage says otherwise.” Fury pulled up news coverage from the Battle on the screen in the conference room. “Now prior to a day before this, you two had never even met.”
“Oh man! That beach is CLEAN,” Wade announced, slipping past Tony to drop what looked like an umbrella handle into the fire. Pretending to wipe sweat from his forehead, Deadpool looked around at the three of them and grinned. “Something smells awesome!” He sniffed and looked at Tony. “Oh.”
"Listen, I'm really sorry--I didn't plan to be gone a week and he got worried about me," he began, gesturing to Wade over his shoulder. "I didn't plan to crash your vacation, and I really really didn't plan for him to!"
Raising shining blue eyes to meet Tony’s gaze, Cap seemed completely steady as he stated “I love you, Tony.”
Needles weren’t Clint’s favorite thing either. He watched the one in black offer his arm to Tony, frowning at the floor. Gee, somebody looked guilty!
Clint surfaced beside Peter, holding up his bow in triumph.
“I love Hulk, I really do, but you’re right. I get to spend every day with him usually. Now that I’ve had some time around you, though...” Clint coughed, weighing different words. “I, um, well, uh,” he stammered. “I don’t think it’s fair that Hulk’s out all the time. And Hulk, buddy, if you’re awake, I’m sorry! Alright, but Bruce is in there too! You guys gotta share or nobody gets to play. Capiche?”
"Hey Bruce," the half naked Clint said casually.
Oh, no. Thor was going to bring Loki back to the Avengers mansion with him? Where was she going to fit into one of the cars, even?
"...Banner says you're right." He reached back and dug in his pants pockets. The syringe was probably too tiny not to crush by accident. "Maybe Banner should be here," he said gruffly.
Bruce nodded and stepped over to pick it up. Inwardly he was thinking how he'd come within inches of stepping right on it.
"I'm here too," Carol chimed in. "You know. Cosmic powers and all that. I could watch one of these two."
After the news from Tony about Peter dating Deadpool, Cap hadn’t been able to stay calm when he ran into Loki. After the fact, he’d convinced himself that everything was okay. That they’d go back to the campsite, get everyone, and face Loki together.
