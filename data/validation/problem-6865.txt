He found Dvorak sitting slumped at a small table by the window, crowded with empty beer bottles. The breakfast tray at his feet looked untouched, the food long gone cold. Dvorak looked how Bucky felt, the picture of misery. His jacket was discarded on the bed, his white shirt left unbuttoned and his hair distressed as if he’d been running his hands through it all night.
They took the train into Rotunde Station. James had been excited to show off what they’d learned in that mornings lesson about the railway system to the indulgent ticket man, but as the line behind them was rather less indulgent Stefen had hurried them along with the promise that there would be plenty more train riding to be had.
"I do." Steve said tightly, looking up with a hard jerk of his head, resettling back into the man the world knew as Captain Rogers. He pinned Bucky with one last look, murmuring, "And you’d do well to remember that" before he turned and walked back into the street.
“Took time out of his day to see me at my barracks. Told me a story about his sister’s family and then threatened mine. So we must be doing something right” he finished, rubbing the back of his neck.
“I did call your name this time. Artur cannot find one of his shoes and is blaming James, probably correctly, who is insisting that Artur will cut his foot, get an infection and have to have it amputated. They’re going to start fighting.” Nodding towards the phone she added, “When are we leaving?”
“You must not have been very close or you would have mentioned her before now.” Steve pointed out and Tony smiled ruefully.
“Are you alright?” Tony heard Stefen ask quietly and James just nodded, apparently no longer as concerned with the incident where he could have drowned as he was with testing out his swimmers legs.
For three long, wet, hours they all worked together to keep the little vessel limping toward the shoreline. Luzzato guided Ester and stuck to the radio, alerting nearby aircraft and sea vessels to their position and giving the captain’s clearance codes. It was necessary to keep the French from blowing them out of the water, but just as likely to draw fire from German aircrafts. Tony pumped faster and prayed that luck was on their side.
“Your cook called the girl away to help with supper and I did not wish to be more of a bother. Stefen and I are such old friends, I was sure he wouldn’t mind.” Werner waved away his concern as she marched from the room with an air of business.
“What’s wrong with that? It’s romantic.” Ian asked, taking a lick of his cone and beside him Natacha rolled her eyes.
"What was Stephen doing down here with you both sitting on the floor?" Steve replied looking into Tony's eyes.
Stephen updated them about Wanda and all her abilities after and before test. He was very pleased with the progress. Tony touched his shoulder and thanked him. Beside him Steve just glared at Tony's hand which was touching Strange. Tony announced he was going to his lab and he will see everyone in the night and went down.
"Well I have decided I can stay here for a few more hours, that wont be a problem right Tony? Stephen was looking at Steve and speaking to Tony. Tony was confused and Stephen knew what Steve wanted and he would not give him that easily.
"I came to take you upstairs, lets go mum" He held her hand and they went away. Everyone just stood there. Sam was just shaking his head like he was disappointed in everything. Bucky was just confused. Wanda seemed a bit shaken up. They all left quietly. Steve stood there he did not know why but looking at Tony carrying a kid and being so close to other kids made him jealous but he knew it was his own fault. He was pissed at Clint for saying shit about Tony but he just stood. Clint was ashamed.
"Well he did not hide stuff from Laura neither he put a shield in her chest so yeah" Tony blurted out and he realised how wrong he was
The coffee at his floor had run out and he thought he needed a really strong one after this. He could feel a headache coming up. He went down to the common kitchen hoping no one was there Boy he was wrong. Sam and Bucky were sitting there.
"No Mr Stark, I mean it was quite long when Carol came up to get you and you guys werent down and I thought.." Peter babbled
"Take care Steve and look after your man he is one of a kind. Next time I see you, you better have some kids to call me uncle" Bucky whispered and Steve turned red. Bucky went towards the jet and he was gone. Steve still hasn't spoken to Tony since last night. Tony was about to walk away to his lab when Steve called his name.
"Tony shut up I will sleep here and Vis can stay on the couch like before right Vis? Nat said knowing Tony wanted to be alone but he wont say it.
"He just have a couple of fractures and a concussion, with his fast metabolism and serum he will heal in 2-3 days. He can leave by tonight" The doctor explained Tony.
"Yeah Jerk. Bucky are you sure you want Tony with you in there? I know I am not allowed and I will be watching from outside with everyone else but T'challa can do it" Steve said.
"Why?! I think I deserve an answer or have you screwed up again Steve?!" Tony shouted. Tony did not sleep in 2 days wondering why did Steve left the shield behind and he was tired and frustrated.
"No steve! Wake up please" he sobbed sitting there with him in his arms looking around seeing all the bodies.
Steve could hear people whispering. His super soldier serum heard some whispering going on around him. Was something wrong and why were there people in his room and as soon as he opened his eyes everything just hit him. He was with Tony. Tony was here he was okay.
"Steve you have to understand it reminds me of you and you remind me of pain" Tony said and kept them there. Steve did not say anything and just nodded silently.
"Good luck Dr Banner, Good luck Bucky" Peter said with a smile. He was upset that Tony was leaving him behind but now he had the responsibility to arrange a party. Maybe he should call Ms Potts and ask for her assisstance.
Tony hugged her "Laura that is a big step, I know you still love him but think about this okay? this is a big step" He replied.
"Tony I am so sorry. I was angry I am so sorry for everything I did not mean to say all this. I am sorry" Clint said
Steve came close and gently kissed him. "You okay? want me to come with you to check on Pete and Rhodey?" He asked. Steve could see the trouble in his sweetheart's eyes but he knew Tony if you push him he will run away.
"Why dont you stay for dinner? I am cooking lasagne and some garlic bread" Sam stated hoping Tony will stay with them.
"Tony stop protecting everyone around you and start protecting yourself. He needs to know you know. I wont allow him to hurt you again I have seen enough"
"Jeez I am going, do you wanna stay in my room?" Tony asked he knew it was hard for her and if she went to her room she will just drink vodka and think about Bruce and Clint. Maybe Tony did not want to feel alone.
"No Tony I did not mean it that way. The winter Soldier does not know the difference and Serum gives him-" Steve was cut out by Tony.
"I can go on the Trial Tony. Shuri has cleaned most of the Winter Soldiers memory and I can control it. The risk is too high and I have not been in that normal line for a long life all my life I have been a soldier I cant leave this Tony" Bucky said and Tony just looked up to him. Tony understood the guy he was more worried about Bruce.
"We thought you will be down in your lab longer Mr Stark I wanted to know when will we be going back? Peter asked him
This all made so much sense now. He was the only one they knew would go to any lengths to make sure that the avengers fall apart or are destroyed. Honestly, the guy won stop at anything Tony remembered. What happened between Ross and Bruce in the start was a clear indication. Also, how he tried to attack him in the room through Bucky. Everyone else was silent in the room. It made sense but what will they do next.
Steve picked Tony up and ran towards the lift. Tony felt light Steve thought. He had lost weight. Rhodey, Bruce and Nat were with him. The rest took the stairs. As soon as they arrived on the hospital floor. Tony was rolled away. Steve was in shock he just stood there looking at his arms. Tony his Tony was slipping away. He had lost Tony once and now he was going to lose him again. He was numb. Everyone sat in the waiting room while Bruce was in with the doctors. Steve just stood there numb. All he could think of was that he did this to him. He did this to Tony.
"Well if that is what you want do it Laura. Cooper will come around. I am sure" Tony smiled and squeezed her hand.
[Shrugging] They were very different men, but father respected Tony like he respected few others. He thought Tony was a fundamentally good man. That was important to my father.
“It’s a shame that Virginia has misplaced the key. I’ll try and see what I can do but I doubt that old door will budge,” Hammer was lamenting. Tony cleared his throat and both men looked up.
“If I collect my share of the trust fund how much is left?” Tony asked, getting down to the heart of things.
It was torture. Every scrape of a spoon or scuffle of a chair ricocheted off the inside of his skull like a deranged bat. Why did he bother with Vodka anyway? Vodka always left Bucky like this aching, regretting, and ultimately wanting more. It was nothing like the soothing touch of fine Grappa. Now that was a drink. But his last bottle had mysteriously gone missing due to - he was damn sure of it - Stark’s sticky fingers.
They reached the tower soon. Happy was driving Laura and Nathaniel, whereas, Tony was driving the other car which had all the kids including Peter.
Tony knew what he was doing. He and Steve needed to be able to speak to each other. They were going to work together and that meant speaking and not trying to hide from him. life depended on there missions and he knew that he needed to make sure that they were able to speak. He did not want to be friendly with him just an acquaint. He also knew Steve did not had anyone to speak to. Bucky was busy with his new friends at the moment and he knew Steve would not open up to Bucky or he would have been here already same with Sam. Nat was still not talking to Cap properly.
Not gestapo then. Probably a vagrant, if he was mucking around in their paddock. Of course, of course it wasn't the gestapo. Franz would never... alright he had quite a mouth on him when you got him talking about politics, which was all the time, but he was just talk. Just all talk. Anyone with half a brain could see he wasn't dangerous. Franz would never put the family at risk by doing anything too outlandish.
"These guys, neighbors of theirs, showed up at the door. I didn't even know the farmer was a Jew until they were yelling at him about how he should have sold them the land when he had the chance. They don't have stars yet like we have here." Péter's voice cracked and he paused, licking his lips nervously and took a deep breath before he continued. "The men dragged the family out to the barn. Even the kids. But the wife, she hid me and the baby before they got to her. They set the barn on fire. I-I heard them all screaming, and I tried to save them, I did, but it was too late."
"Willamina's got some jars of tomato preserved in the pantry." Bucky instructed. "It aint what we grew back home but it does in a pinch." He finally seemed to get on board with the program because he came around the other side of the bed and slid his hands underneath Stefen, helping to prop him up. Stefen let out a pained moan and Tony's gut churned.
"I've spoken to some friends of mine. With time we might be able to determine which town they are headed to.” Stefen thankfully broke up the endless cycle of breathes so heavy in Tony’s ears.
“You never could tell your fingers from sausages that’s for sure,” Bucky was teasing gently even as James scrambled to comply. “But with all those medals on your jacket nobody here’s gonna be brave enough to tell ya.”
"But I suppose..." he pondered slowly until even Péter had looked up from his plate, cautious but undoubtedly curious. "… I suppose if it drags out, like it did last time. You'll just have to come stay with me."
"Yes," Stefen answered tersely, and there was something about hearing it said from his lips - so resolved and without trapping - that made Charlotte's heart crumble in her chest. What was so lacking in her, that he could not love her with such simple certainty?
"It means boy, and I know a boy who needs to wipe his face." Steve drawled with a note of sternness to urge the boy to comply. James made as if he was going to wipe his face with his sleeve but a swat on the arm from Natacha made him think twice and he glowered at his sister as she thrust his napkin under his nose.
. They looked so terrified. Péter lowered his voice, leaning closer to Tony murmuring, “James can be awfully stubborn.”
He clenched his fingers tightly around the stick he still held, the wood creaking dangerously. They were just words. No better than Tony should expect from a Nazi officer. But he didn’t think he could handle hearing them and he wondered when he’d been so stupid as to start falling for Captain Rogers.
Everything wasn’t going to be okay by itself, but it didn’t matter. He believed she was strong enough to survive it and to help her siblings survive it. And in that moment at least, so did she.
Gloominess descended over the car once more. Natacha couldn’t decide whether she welcomed or hated the silence.
“Not as dead as all that. You did have your friend here looking for me.” Tony nodded to the stranger in the corner and Stanislov chuckled, the sound rumbling deeply in his chest.
Tony was finding it harder to breathe under Stefen’s stare, his heart quickening in his chest under the weight of what that necklace meant to him and the absurdity of him wanting to give something so priceless to Tony of all people.
"It looks as if our monk is in trouble again," Steve met the anxious eyes of the children and was gratified when their anxiousness gave way to mirth and curiosity as the commotion outside the doors got closer.
“My name is Filip Coulson.” Coulson extended his hand for a shake which Steve took and shook firmly, his suspicions confirmed doing nothing to ease the tension coiled tightly within his stomach.
“Of course, it just came like this I suppose?” Tony countered still taking in the destruction in the room with a sinking feeling. Pepper was not going to be happy.
“Very good.” Neuman beamed down at him. “You’ll report for training in Hamburg immediately, with an escort of course. You-”
Tony was tempted to look away as Stefen’s eyes searched his but he resisted the feeling as cowardly. He’d not talked about his mother in a long time, but if a fourteen-year-old boy could pluck up the courage, Tony could hardly expect less of himself. And besides, it was for a good cause. Mama would not have minded.
What must Stefen think after hearing something like that, hearing that Tony had been the worst sort of youth before he’d been locked up behind the abbey walls and that he’d wanted to fight against his own countrymen? No doubt the worst.  How could he not, when he’d given so much for Austria, fought so long and so hard.
“Well, yes!” Stefen did not look nearly as amused by this as Tony was. “God… where did you even learn something like that?”
From the moment rumors of Plan Z had filtered down through the network, Steve had known they would come knocking. If the Führer was asking for the impossible, the only solution was to cast their hope on the name that had gotten famous for making the impossible possible.
Stefen wanted him to go to Berlin, to attend a dinner with a bunch of stuffy Nazi researchers because the conversation would go over his head. That sounded an awful lot like Steve wanted... company to Tony.
In just a few months Péter had managed to capture a fascinating spread of people and places. To Tony’s inexperienced eye it seemed he had a natural talent for catching people in their element in a way that spoke volumes.
“They don’t like outsiders either, but they have good reason, don’t they?” Ian swept back a lock of hair that had fallen in front of his eye. He either didn’t see or ignored the anxious glances his siblings traded with each other as he blithely continued. Steve closed his eyes and released a silent sigh, opening them again when his incredibly stupid and
Ian’s heart was racing. It was so cold within the room he could feel it prickling over his skin. He felt dizzy but he swallowed and tried to remember what Tony had told them to say. What Natacha would say if she were there, but neither of them were there. He was alone, and the man who called himself Agent Neuman was staring down at him as if he could see under Ian’s skin.
Steve nodded his understanding and Luzzato left them, after assuring them that someone would be along with dry towels and supper was in an hour. Thankful the trunks that they had packed for the journey had held up well in the rain, and their few belongings had suffered nothing more than a little dampness.
"They are second hand, and good enough for schoolboys. Should the Führer expend his recourses just so Robert Drake can find further excuses to explain his less than satisfactory performance?"
There were the frigid temperatures, wild animals and the scarcity of food to keep him on his toes. They could all very well die before the winter was out or worse yet maybe he’d only lose one or two.
over everything the world had offered him. Over her… She never would have thought it possible. It was heartbreaking. Infuriating.
Still, he was grateful for his family’s caution and foresight to hold Stefen back and send Antonia instead. Women were less conspicuous in general and to an outside observer it wouldn’t be unusual for the widow to receive a female friend around teatime. It was rather amusing though; the heavy scarf Aunt Antonio had draped over herself for subterfuge. The weather was still cool, but not as cold as all that.
"And why would I do that?" Steve grinned, snatching Tony's hand back and placing it back on his chest, right over the spot where his heart beat so strongly. Tony's fingers splayed out over his heated skin and Steve felt his lashes lower, the ache in his body giving way to a sleepy contentment.
“Have a nice break Péter. Don’t forget to write!” he called with a wave as he trotted to catch up with the line and Péter waved until he was out of sight. Another sharp whistle filled the station and a loud voice announced the train headed east was now boarding. That was him. Péter grabbed his trunk and made to move toward the line that was forming in front of the ticket collector but something made him pause and look back at the little girl. She was still holding her mother’s hand, but her gaze was now on the floor, an expression so forlorn on her face it made Péter’s stomach twist.
"He is a friend of Tony so dont worry about being professional" Carol said. Carol was smart she knew what Steve was trying to do. She was not oblivious. She gave Nat a looked and Nat knew s well. Carol thought this would be fun.
Soon Tony everyone was served breakfast and Steve sat a plate of Avocado on toast and some yogurt with fruits and a glass of smoothie.  Steve knew Tony wont be happy but he had spoken to the doctor about Tony's diet. Sam had some knowledge as well. He knew Tony wont be happy but he could be grumpy all he wants if that meant keeping him healthy.
"I understand" Steve replied with a sigh. He could not force Tony to do anything and he knew Tony just wanted to get over with.
Steve woke up next morning and went for his run. He was deciding what to wear. Usually he put on whatever he saw but today this Stephen guy was going to be there and Steve just wanted to look good. It was stupid but Steve just wanted to be ready.
"Strange it wasnt his fault I freaked out and he helped me. You cant start transporting people to Everest because they piss you off. Trust me if I could do that the whole board of SI would be at Everest" Tony replied. Natasha was looking at him and Bruce just smiled.
"Dont say it like that Tony. We will have all the time in the world" Steve replied. He was scared he did not want Tony to leave him ever.
"Tony? My love, why dont we take a break?" Steve said softly. Tony turned around from his holograms screens and gave Steve a hard look "I cant rest without knowing who did this. Carol and Rhodey could have been dead, Peter could have been kidnapped or Clint and his family or Scott. Do you want me to rest so they can take another shot at one of us" Tony replied while his voice was rising with every word. Currently Clint and Nat were on computers and phone trying to find out more information, Bruce was tracing those people and Sam and Stephen were running checks. Wanda and Vision were hard at work as well. After Tony's outburst everyone stopped and could feel the tension.
"Thanks I know I have a great ass you tell me all the time when we are in bed" Steve just smiled and replied "Tony everyone is waiting". "Steeeevee I have work to do you know, I need complete these SI projects and equipment and my suits" Steve smiled. He loves it when Tony speaks about his work and what he made and what he had to do. The way his eyes light up and the way he smiles. "Steve? Steve? are you even listening to me?" Tony broke his thought process. "Yes Tony I am listening but Pepper is upstairs as well and she wont mind now cmom" Steve replied.
"Well I had a good day yesterday I told Steve we will be friends as we have the team to run. However, I had a panic attack because Steve touched me well almost touched my face. I dont know some days I want to be like how we use to be but it is hard"
"You thought blackmailing Tony would work and when it did not happen you did this because you knew you could take Bucky in this way" Steve had shouted.
"Bring up file Alpha Roger five echo X-ray, we have work to do and DUM-E, don't start being happy and chirpy yet you are with me, YOU go make me a good healthy drink and Butterfingers help me with the space and if anyone of you annoy me I will donate you to the local community college"
"I should have taken this treatment after we went to Wakanda but I thought I was okay. Please let me do this"
"Its funny Cap how you care about me now, all of a sudden I mean something to you. Last time i checked you dont leave "love of your life" to die in cold but I guess thats how you love people"
"No Stark unlike you I have actual work to do so no. I just wanted to see if you were okay. Oh yeah if you want I can disappear Ross no one would know" Stephen got up.
"You protect yourself Tony no matter what" Steve whispered this in his ear and moved back. He knew what it meant, Bucky wont be there if the Soldier came out and he wanted to make sure Tony knew he wont hold anything against him.
"Laura and the kids are still on Clints floor so they might not be able to join" Sam spoke up. Sam, Bucky and Scott were sitting together waiting for the guys to show up.
"Yup Pep just tired. How are you Happy doing? He taking good care of you?" Tony asked knowing how well Happy treated Pepper.
"I did it" Bucky whispered and hugged Tony. Tony smiled. He was happy that he helped Barnes. He knew how fucked up it would be to feel like someone else will take over his body. Tony knew that Barnes was not who killed his family. Steve hugged bucky. He was so happy and proud of him. Tony was about to leave.
"So you are Steve" Stephen said looking him from head to toe like sizing him. Steve just stood there thinking what does that mean.
"Whats going on? you are not leaving the company? are you? oh my god you are leaving me forever and shifting to some weird place arent you?" Tony stated horrified. Pepper just rolled her eyes and continued.
"Everything wont fix in a day Tony it will take time. Time heals everything" Steve said when Tony was getting out of the elevator and Steve went to his floor giving him some space.
"Tony I am so sorry. I swear I did not know the damage which would be caused by it. I cant look at the shield" Steve replied.
It was almost dinner time. Sam and Bucky were on cooking duty. Steve knew Sam was good at cooking but Bucky did not know much about it. Scott was watching TV and Clint was sulking. He missed his family and Steve felt guilty about it. He told him that Laura might give him a chance but his son seemed upset. It had been almost a week since Wanda left. Also, the last time he saw Tony. He knew when Tony was in tower and he made his mission to avoid him. He could not see Tony till the guy called for him. He did not want to hurt him anymore than he already had. Suddenly the lift opened and he saw Carol, Rhodey and Peter coming out.
"I like what they have done" Steve replied. He liked the setting and he knew he had to move forward.
They drove silent. Vision had just flew back. He was sure vision was hurt that Wanda did not even greet him. When they arrived Carol and Rhodey were waiting for them. Cooper and Peter wished everyone night and went directly to the room. Tony was sure they will talk about everything.
They all had dinner quietly. Tony asked Peter about his patrol and that was it. Tony was upset that he could not help Barnes the way he wanted to. Steve wanted Bucky to stay with him. The mood was really tense. After dinner everyone slowly left. They were informed that bucky was leaving at 9 in the morning so everyone had to wake up early. Tony limped to his room and Steve followed him. He tucked Tony in and wished him good night. Tony knew Steve was hurting but Barnes was a sensitive topic between them and did not say anything. Tony thought maybe Steve hated him as he was the reason Barnes was leaving. Steve just went down to Bucky's room and sat outside.
"Tony please I did not know I thought it would just power your suit down and I knew Friday would send a signal"
"Tony are you okay? I am sorry I did not want to make you feel uncomfortable I dont even remember when we fell asleep" Steve said. He was scared of Tony's reaction. He did not want to lose all the progress they had made.
"Do I look like a nurse to you Strak" Stephen replied. He knew Tony wanted to help him. He wanted to see what Tony would do.
"Well they have holidays coming soon and you know the tradition you have started which drives me nuts but I cant do much. Is he there?" Tony knew why she was calling him, he kept her updated about Clint but also made sure they had enough security.
"Carol what happened?" Tony said getting out of bed and Steve understanding the situation pushed the avengers alarm.
"Cap get up" Tony said. Steve could not stop crying. he felt like he lost everything. All he wanted was Bucky safe and this cost him everything.
"So what is this party for, last I checked it isnt my birthday Rhodey bear so why does it look like unicorn pooped here? not that I am complaining"
"Yeah seriously I had a panic attack wasnt the first time wont be the last so calm down about it" Tony shouted.
"Okay pepper calm down, one minute you are throwing words and next minute you are hugging me. Are you okay? Am I about to be an uncle here because-"
"I am trying Tony and he is trying as well you know. He has apologised so many times and I told him about the divorce. He said to give him a month and if he could not prove himself he will not object. I want to forgive him you know I maybe have. Its Cooper I am worried about what if he doesnt understand this decision and starts to hate me too" Laura said looking outside the window.
"Friday can you call Steve up to my bedroom" Tony knew how Steve must have felt but he knew this wasnt his fault. He understood Steve better now. He had protected Bucky that day because he was innocent and today he protected Tony because he knew Tony was unarmed. In a way Steve knew Tony would have felt great regret if Bucky was seriously injured and he knew Bucky would feel the same as well. Also, the words he had told Tony before he went in reminded him that Tony was his first priority now.
"I swear Rogers if you dont stop interrupting me I will put your mouth to good use" Steve moaned again. He wanted Tony right here and Tony wanted that as well but he needed to apologise. He pulled back and Steve made a groan of displeasure as he was removed from Tony's neck gently. "Hey I know but before I make love to you there are things I need to say and stop interrupting me. I am sorry Steve I did not mean to bring that up and trust me when I say I have forgiven you I have its just that I am scared Steve what if they attacked you and took you away from me what will I do and I-"
Nat had volunteered to stay for the first night and Steve wanted to object but he agreed. Although he stayed in the corridor after everyone went to sleep but did not come in. He did not want anyone to know that he was there. Bucky and Sam had tried talking to him but he shut them out. Every time he went to see Tony he saw someone there with him. Peter, Rhodey and Cooper were with him at breakfast time, in the afternoon he found Bruce and Nat there speaking to him. For lunch Carol was there with Bucky and Sam. Whenever he went in he just stood in the shadows making sure he did not make Tony uncomfortable.
"Its okay birdbrain they are your family so they are mine as well" Tony smiles and Clint pulled him in a hug.
"Barnes listen to me I know you are still in there you have to fight" Tony said while making sure the gauntlet was covering his hand but he knew he could not protect himself with only the gauntlet. Steve was still trying to break the door with his strength. Turns out the door was made with titanium alloy and Steve was not given his Shield back.
"Thank you Tony, can you just keep this in your lab I mean I will take it from you" Steve said and Tony just gave him a look and was about to ask whats wrong when Peter swinged in.
Steve ran and ran. He did not know what time it was anymore but he just couldn't stop. He needed this to run to let the anger go. Anger he felt towards himself for hurting Tony. He has so strongly believed in protecting Bucky that he did not realise what he was losing. Tony could not even bear the touch of him anymore. His Tony who would touch him randomly by taking his hand while they were eating or just cuddling while watching a movie. Touching was Tony's thing he just could not keep his hands to himself and Steve never complained because he loved it. Now Tony could not even bear to be close to him. He wanted to get out of tower to let Tony be comfortable he realised whatever progress he had made went down the drain. He did not deserve Tony after what he did. He sighed. The thought of Tony not being in his life made his heart ache. If he could take it back he would but now it was too late. The panic in tony's eyes thats all he could see. He stopped and walked back towards the tower. He knew it was late and hopefully no one will be waiting for him. He would just go and cry himself to sleep without Tony being wrapped up in his arm.
"I am giving them a chance except for Steve and Wanda. I dont like her if she is going to behave the way she does"
Stephen's back was facing Tony. He froze for a second and turned a bit not looking Tony in the eye he couldnt lie to Tony but he never wanted to put Tony in the position he was in. "Tony you are a great friend and all I want from you is your friendship. Take care Stark I will see you soon" and he was gone. Tony wasn't convinced but he knew if Stephen had feelings for him he would have made his mood. He sat in the lounge as everyone was busy eating. Steve came in.
"I could have asked a number of things such as steal Nat's coffee in the morning or piss Carol off or go out on a date with me" Tony replied
"Thank you Doc" Tony shook his hand and just nodded. He was too pissed at Steve right now and decided it would be better if he went to his lab.
"Yeah there are some glitches in Friday and no matter what they keep coming back. It looks like someone is trying to mess with system and they are not able to get in" Tony explained.
"yeah and your prep talk was going to work? I know he was having a break down and he needed rest. He hasn't been sleeping well in the night Friday keeps me updated" Carol replied. Everyone know settled down waiting for any news. Banner walked in.
"Lets go Spiderman you have had a long night how about you get some sleep?" Sam said stepping forward. Peter just nodded and went with Sam and Steve. "I will be there in a sec Kid" Tony replied and hugged Stephen. "Thank you Thank you, tiy do not know what you have done for me. How will i ever repay you?" Tony said as he moved out of his arms. "Well you keep that stupid smile on your face for like forever and that would repay the debt" Stephen replied. Tony just smiled at him. "Go check on the kid while I go check on Carol and Rhodey. Also I know what you are thinking we need to have a meeting" Strange said and walked off joining Nat who was on her way down.
"That was hell of a speech" Tony whispered. Steve just looked down and nodded. Tony reached out and lifted Steve's face up. Tony could see the tears.
"That is not true cap you know that. You know its not your fault that Clint and Laura are fighting that is how couple are you know they fight but they will be okay" Tony replied sounding confident but he knew Laura wanted to go for divorce.
Tony sat on the floor taking deep breaths, his hands touched the cold floor making him feel a bit alive. He tried counting in his head to calm himself and after a few minutes his breathing was finally normal. Tony was not sure what Steve wanted to talk about after all this time.But he knew he had to speak to him soon. Clearly he wanted to throw some apologies at him. Nothing mattered anymore and what good an apology will bring. He knew nothing will go back to normal. There wont be anymore nights where Steve held him while they slept or how they use to make love in early hours of the morning or how Steve use to go run and made sure he was back before Tony woke up so his face would be the first thing he will see. Steve was a face what his nightmares held. Sometimes he wanted to compare Steve to Stane but somehow he just could not.
"Tony, listen to me, focus on my voice I know it is hard just breath yeah? Take my hand just hold on to it I promise it will be okay just deep breaths. Take deep breaths" Stephen put his hand forward and Tony grabbed it. He slowly brought it to his own heart and kept his hand there. "Tony, I know it is hard but just count my heartbeats yeah? I will count with you. 1001, 1002, 1003...1060" Tony was almost breathing normally and Stephen just hugged him. "It is okay Tony, you'll be okay". Stephen hated this, seeing Tony in pain was never easy for him he sometimes wished that he could take away all of his pain. "What happened? talk to me"
"No Tony No I? what do you mean die? you had the arc reactor removed" Steve was confused and horrified at the same time what had he done.
"Tony is stable. He had a heart attack and we brought him on the right time. He has not been sleeping well and all this stress has been too much for him. I need to breath and Hulk out. The other guy is hurt about Tony. Where is Steve?" Bruce asked looking around.
"He called me to inform me that he will show up tomorrow for a day only though he is needed back Kamar Taj" Nat replied
"I will be around the tower tomorrow as well so yeah just come down in the lab" He said and walked away. He was waiting for the elevator and bumped into Steve
Everyone saw Tony leaving and Steve coming out with red eyes. They had an idea but no one said anything.
"Okay so I have to speak to you about something. I know you care about me a lot but just give them all a chance Carol please" Tony said.
"No Tony wait. I would come and see you but did not want to disturb you and your boyfriend. I please listen to me I-" Steve was cut off by a laughter. Tony was laughing. Steve thought Tony found his misery amusing.
"Captain I was just saying if you could hurry up" Tony said looking everywhere except Steves face. His blue eyes, Tony loved those eyes. He use to love looking at them all the time. Now he just couldnt. He remember looking in those eyes while he felt the Shield hitting him in his chest. his breath getting knocked out.
"You know what she is trying to say Ross. You are the reason Hulk was created in the first place we all know the history and we have papers to prove it" Nat had replied.
Peter entered Tony's room and just stood there. Nat just squeezed his and left. Giving Peter and Tony privacy. Peter had always looked up to Tony he was always around the genius. He was a very important figure in Peters life. The only male figure and Tony knew how terrified Peter would have been. Tony just nodded at peter and lifted his arms. Next thing Tony knew Peter was hugging him gently and Tony could feel his gown getting wet. He wanted that when he was informed that his parents died and no one was there to do this for him.
"Tony I cant do that I get nightmares thinking about-" Steve said and stopped himself halfway. He took his face in his hands and he knew he was about to break down but he couldnt do that not right now. Tony just stood there for a minute. He had told Steve plenty of time he had forgiven him but Steve was hurting and the blonde did not even saw anything about it. Tony felt so stupid for pushing Steve to answer. He walked towards Steve and sat beside him.
Steve saw Rhodey sitting beside Tony. Tony looked so peaceful, he always did when he slept. He looked like a baby. If only Steve could go back in time and fix it. The doctors had clearly instructed them that Tony needs to rest and be stress free. Steve knew if he had to he will take all the blame away from Tony.
"Shh Tony just please accept it. What you did for Bucky on the day of Trial and arranging all this no one would have done it. I am so grateful Tones. Thank you " Steve said and kissed his cheek. Tony just blushed and nodded. He went to his lab in a hurry. What had just happened.
Tony was discharged at 5 am in the morning. Okay Tony wont say it being discharged but he kind of snuck out by telling nurse he was done and he is leaving. He knew he had to speak to Steve and he knew the blonde will be getting ready for his run.
As soon as Bucky was out everyone move towards Tony. He was still struggling to breath and Rhodey was making everyone back out so he could have some space.
"Steve? Sam? where is Tony? please tell me he is alright? Bucky said standing up. Tony moved forward so Bucky could see him and Bucky winced what had he done. Steve turned around to look at Tony and gave him a look to stay behind him but Tony being Tony moved in front and Steve still stood in front of the glass. Bucky could still Tony's face but Steve's body was covering Tony.
"It does not matter, you are here and safe thats all that matters. Did you speak to Nat?" Tony asked
"Jeez Doc give a guy a warning. I have a heart condition" Tonys said and instead of a reply he was gently hugged by Stephen. Steve chose this exact moment to enter and saw Stephen and Tony hugging. His heart broke. He knew this was it. Tony had people to look after him and the Doc guy who Steve knew liked Tony was with Tony instead of him. He started walking back to his place to pack. He would tell the guys in the morning and leave quietly without hurting anyone anymore. Tony was okay and Bucky was home he did not want anything else.
"No nurses are attractive and you look like shit anyway. I will fix it" Tony knew this was wrong but he just couldnt help his nature for fixing everything. He had done this 100 times before. He knew Steve would ignore this and it will get worst in the morning and Steve wont be able to do anything. His serum will fix it in 2 days but still he knew how stubborn Steve was. Carol was giving him the eye to dont do this. Rhodey just sighed. Nat's face was normal. Somehow she understood him. Bruce was too busy eating food to form an opinion.
"Yeah maybe I dont know. I just started to talk to Tony again and if this guy is his friend maybe I should be nice to him as well" Steve sighed. He knew he was being wrong about this. Maybe he was over exaggerating the whole thing.
"Well I have list of people who have these abilities and i keep a check on them if you become a threat to others i will strip you from your powers and before you ask yes young lady I can do that" Strange calmly replied.
"Tony I am so sorry I havent been around after Ultron I went away to another planet and was rescued by Thor. He couldn't come back as he is in Asgard. I am so sorry I should be her-" Bruce was interrupted.
"Okay Pep and Nat what are you doing there" Nat turned around looking at the mess YOU and Butterfingers had created.
"Can I see him?" Steve asked. Carol nodded and started to walk towards the door she stopped and whispered.
"Carol give him sometime" Stephen replied. He knew how Tony worked and he wanted to be alone right now.
Next morning everyone collected to wish Wanda goodbye. Surprisingly Carol came with Tony as well. Laura and the kids were the only one those werent there. Steve stood far away from Tony. He wouldnt even meet Tony's eye. Wanda hugged around and came in front of Tony.
"I know Tony" Stephen hugged him. He knew Tony still loved Steve however, he liked Tony a lot but he knew Tony would never see him that way. He may not be able to get Tony but he promised himself that he will protect the guy.
Suddenly a lightning circle formed in the middle of the lounge and a guy walked in. He was wearing some sort of coat/cape Steve thought. The guy looked good. This was not good for Steve.
"I do not mix personal and professional life Captain so dont worry about missions. You prove it to me that you deserve a second chance and I will give you one but till then I dont care. I think we will get along fine Captain till you not hurt Tony. You are hanging on a very thin line" Carol said and left without even listening to Steve's reply. Steve went off to gym to let all his anger out.
"No Tony he was right it was my fault-" Steve had a hand on his lips. It was not like Steve wanted to kiss that hand or anything but the touch made him shiver.
"Is there something wrong I mean do you require anything else I can ask Nat or Friday to make necessary-"Tony was cut off by Stephen
"Goodbye Cap." Tony said walking towards elevator. He waited all of a sudden and Steve thought he would turn around and come back but he started walking again.
The car ride was quiet Steve was sitting next to Tony while Bucky and Sam were in the back. It felt weird sitting with Tony in front. Whenever they use to drive Tony use to hold his hand throughout the way. He use to scold Tony about it but he liked it. It was a habit they had and now they were just sitting like strangers. He turned to look at Bucky and he was just staring outside. Steve prayed that everything would go well.
"Okay Ed. Remember your family is waiting for you" she squeezed his hand and gave a nod to Sam and Bucky and left.
"Coop you know how lucky you are that your dad is here? Me I wasnt that lucky. Me and my dad we use to fight you know and the day he died I was fighting with him as well. He walked out of that door angry. I think about it so many times what if I did not fight with him or probably told him I loved him. But I cant you still have the choice" Tony said
"I believe Boss is having a Heart Attack. The lift is ready to take boss to the hospital floor and the doctors are preparing for necessary arrangements.
"Yeah, just need to submit final paperwork and we can start with training next week. Lang I have contact Pym. The process is taking long but it will be done soon but meantime I have arranged for Cassie to come over tomorrow and Barnes come down whenever you are free the arm is ready" Tony said.
"Nope, I need to speak to him. Also, I know it has been a long morning why dont everyone go to there rooms and relax we will meet in the evening and have a movie night?" Tony said. Rhodey guided him to Peters room. While everyone went to there rooms. Steve went and sat beside Sam for a bit but Tony had told them that it would take more than 2 days for Bucky to wake up. He went to gym instead to flush all the anger out. He was angry at everything.
"No Stephen just-its not his fault. Please I want to be alone" Tony replied. Stephen just nodded and left the way he came.
Tony sat in his lab. It was a temporary one he had at the mansion. This mansion held memories good and bad that is why when Carol and Rhodey got married Tony thought to gift them the mansion. Although, Rhodey and Carol did not agree to it however, they made a deal that they will pay rent as they both have been to this place numerous time while they were young. Tony had his lab here because usually Rhodey or Carol dragged him here for dinner and made him stay with everyone else. Once he had brought Steve here and he had thought that one day maybe him and Steve can live here. Well it was not going to happen ever.
"Welcome back Mr stark. Captain Rogers is packing his bags as we speak" Friday replied. Tony was alarmed. Packing? where was he going what had happened? He said he wont leave him so what was wrong? Tony reached Steve's floor and moved towards his lounge and Steve came out at the same time with a bag to keep it beside the other. He saw Tony and just froze. What was Tony doing here and where was Doctor guy. Tony looked hurt, he was upset and confused what was going on with Steve. Steve dropped his bag and just stood there.
"He wants his revenge and I think he knows he will go down so why not get rid of us" Bruce replied. He knew Ross well and he knew he thought that he would go down for his crimes. He just wanted to get rid of them.
"I know Barnes I know. I have let it go and so should you" Tony squeezed his shoulder. Bucky left and shortly Tony left with Peter. he dropped him at May's and went to attend his meeting or else Pepper would actually kill him. She was so moody these days.
"Let's get my fella some nice food" Steve replied and extended his hand towards Tony. "Well, if you want to spoil your fella with food, who am I to stop my love" Tony took his hand and they went to the common room. Everyone was already in their seats. They had Ross on their tail and had so much information to go through but right now all that mattered was sitting here next to Tony, surrounded by their family. This was more than enough for Steve. They would deal with ross after this moment but this was his moment. Tony felt eyes on him and looked up to Steve who was staring him with a smile. Tony asked what with his head and Steve just nodded back nothing and placed a kiss on his cheek. Yeah they will be alright Steve thought.
"No you were a victim as well Bucky and it took me time to understand that but its all in the past. It is not your fault"
"Why? are you 2 together or something after Steve kicked you out of his life you fo-" It was cut off by a slap. Laura had slapped him.
"I need someone with a tranq for a super soldier" Carol shouted and everyone held Steve down while they injected him. He was taken in a room where he would stay sleep for 6 hours maximum.
"I know what you wanted to ask me and yes we can sleep in the same bed. The night we slept together was the fisrt time I did not had night mares Tony so yes I would love to sleep in the same bed" Steve said.
"Tony?" he could hear in the distance 2 people shouting "Hi uncle Tony, I want to talk to uncle Tony. No I want too"
Tony smiled knowing it was Cooper and Lila "Hey Laura, I believe the kids are super excited for some reason"
The next morning when they all met for breakfast the lighting circle according to Steve, appeared and Wanda, Vision and Strange walked out. He was happy to see them back. Wanda had completed all her test set by Strange and was back with the Avengers. Tony hugged them all and smiled when he saw Strange in normal clothes instead of his outfit. "What is the occasion Strange you getting married or what?" Tony said as they took the seat at the table. Strange just rolled his eyes and replied "If you are the groom then yes I am getting married" Steve just narrowed his eyes at him and Tony just rolled his eyes. "Okay boys behave lets eat" Nat said. Steve was jealous and he was not ashamed to admit it.
"Tony you are okay. You are in your room and you are safe" Steve whispered. Tony just nodded and kept his hand on his face.
"Guys we have a situation in a town 20 miles away. There are some weird robots sightings and civilians around. Someone call it" Bruce said. Everyone looked towards Steve including Tony. Steve's eyes were fixed at Tony and Tony just nodded.
The thought of Steve made his heart ache a bit the way the soldier had begged him. He remember begging as well to come with him ,however, shit had happened and Steve left him not the same way Tony left him. Tony wanted to be busy.
"You are so innocent Nathan and i wish you didnt have to grow up but you will and this place is not that nice but Uncle Tony will always be here for you" Tony kissed his cheek and brought him at the table. Steve just looked at the sight. Tony holding a baby, it could have been there baby if this whole thing did not had happened but he knew he might not be able to have that chance. But that sight made Steve's heart melt. He just wanted to go there and wrap his arms around him.
After the excitement had died down now they were all sitting in the common room and chatting. Tony and Pepper were sitting and talking about business and Pepper was updating him what will happen when she is off. "Pep you dont worry I am sure you have thought about the whole thing and I trust your judgment. You rest and take as long as you need. I am so happy for you" She held his hand "Tony thank you so much. You know this doesn't change anything and I will always be here for you" "I know Pep".
"Mr Stark I made you coffee just the way you like it" Peter kept the cup in front he knew Tony did not like things handed to him.
"Wait Steve, Laura you go in the car and get settled I will be there" Laura just gave him the look but said nothing and went.
"It wont come to that. Bruce, Nat and Clint are still in lab trying to hack into Ross's Server. Bucky is preparing himself with Sam and Scott" Carol informed him.
"So yeah where was I, Clint you better get your shit sorted because honestly I do not know how long Laura will want to stick around with that attitude of yours and do not interrupt. Steve you are pass the pissing point I can put a bullet in your head and wont even feel bad about it. The only reason you are alive in this room is because of Tony. He made me promise him not to hurt you or anyone else in this room because trust me nothing will make me more happy than getting rid of you from his life. You have hurt him enough for a life time. If I would have been late in retrieving him he would have been dead because of you. If you would kill your boyfriend for you friend imagine what will I do for my family to you and you mean nothing to me. Last warning Rogers stay.." Carol was clear on her words. She has to protect Tony. Rhodey would not say this to all of them because he still considered these people friends but she did not know them at all. All she knew was how Tony took her in when her parents kicked her out. How he sat with her and helped her through nightmares. He was her brother and if she knew he needed them earlier she would have been there. Before she could complete Tony came up.
"Good morning Tony" Steve replied with a smile on his face. Steve wasnt sure if this was a dream or reality was Tony really here in his arms?
"Can we have this conversation later when I am not too drugged up" Tony said and was falling sleep again. Steve nodded and was about to go  get the doctor when Tony held on to his hand tightly.
"Sure kiddo you can help me pack. Yes Cap after I am done packing you can" Tony replied and walked off with Peter.
"Ross has the video of the Bunker. The fight between Steve, Bucky and Tony" Nat said. Everyone was tense now. No one knew there were cameras there not to there information.
"Hey T'Challa has agreed to help Bucky. He can leave tomorrow. I have arranged Quinjet to be ready" Nat told Steve.
"I wanted to tell you that I would like Wanda to learn to control her magic a friend of mine he has offered and he is great with this magic stuff. The guys is great but is a pain my ass" Tony had a small smile at his lips. He remembered how Stephen always shows up with his idiotic light circles to update him about threats. They met up a year ago while a mission.
They got up and moved to the common room where everyone was gathered. Tony entered followed by Steve, everyone looked up and Strange was next to Tony in a second he knew something was terribly wrong. Steve didn't like Strange but he was glad Tony had people who really cared for him. "There was an explosion at the mansion" Tony started. Everyone interrupted with questions.
"Last time I fought a super soldier I walked out my way fine so do not give me your reasons. Barnes are you okay with me being there?"Tony asked dismissing Steve.
"Tony we just wanted to celebrate you, you have done so much for us and we thought with Bruce back we-" Laura said and was interrupted by Nat
"Hey Tony its okay Tony listen to me look at me look in my eyes" Steve knew what had happened and he was so stupid to let it happen. He took Tony's hand and kept it on his chest. "Breath with me Tony breath baby" Steve tried speaking to him. Tony started counting after 5 minute he was back to normal. He looked towards Steve who was siiting with him on the floor with his hand clasped around Tony on his heart. He could clearly see the tears in his eyes.
"hey everyone. Friday informed me you were still here Tony. Is it okay if I come with you back to the mansion? "Laura said
"We are clear for duty in 2 days I think. That is what Tony mentioned last night when I saw him" Sam said.
The jet opened and there was he, Tony stopped breathing for a second he swear if he could see his face it would look like he wanted to puke or he was constipated. Suddenly someone touched his back and he knew it was Peter as Nat, Vision and Carol were beside him. He relaxed. He looked the same except he had grown a beard, beside him was Bucky the reason he left Tony thought. It pained him to see him with someone else but he knew he was doing it for the best, Clint came next with Sam and Scott. Wanda behind them looking at Vision. Vision looked exactly like Tony like he was constipated but Tony touched his shoulder and he relaxed. They were all walking towards them and Tony started panicking as it reminded him of the airport.
"Tony I want to apologise, I am so sorry as sorry as I can be for the whole Berlin and Siberia mess. Not only that I am sorry for leaving you there alone. I know you might not understand me but I had to protect Bucky and at that time nothing made more sense than what I did. I knew you could not help us after the accords and you knew I was looking for him. I knew I had to keep him safe. I got to know about your parents a few days after we fought about the Accords. I knew if I told you, you would react that way. I had to keep Bucky safe. Tony you need to understand that he is the only thing I have from my past. I just could not let him go. All I am saying is I did what I had to do to keep him safe. But that does not mean I love you any less. Tony after walking away from that bunker every night I have dreamt about you. You were the only thing on my mind and I just wanted to come back to you but I know I broke your trust. I just want you to forgive me and be with me. Thats all I ask. I wont let you go over. Bucky is my friend but you are the love of my life" Steve completed while Tony just sat there.
"Move aside Steve" Carol shouted.  She blasted the door and for a second everyone looked at her and ran inside. Steve was the first one in followed by Nat, Carol and Rhodey. Sam and Bruce were the last and guarded the door not allowing any of the guards sent by Ross in. They could see Ross standing with other members looking shocked. However, there was a glint in his eyes.
"So Rogers I heard you and Tony are back together" Strange said and Steve looked at him. Nat was glad that she was in the room and if these 2 idiots decide to fight she would just throw them both out of the tower.
"Jesus christ! what the hell re you doing up so late. Friday lights. I have a heart condition don't sneak up on me like that" Tony glared at Steve. He came back because he was sure Steve would be asleep and he would just watch him sleep from his door and leave. He did not even know why he was avoiding him.
"Come here Lila I have missed you my love" Lila looked unsure but Tony and Laura smiled at her and she moved towards Clint and hugged him.
"I took the day off I wanted to be here with you and we have something planned f-" Carol kept her hand on his mouth.
"Tony my love, I do not know if you can hear me or not but I just want you to know that I love you and I always have and you need to be alright and wake up soon because I need to say it how much I love you because I regret not saying it enough. You gave me home when I thought I had no where to go. Tony you made me the happiest man on planet. When I woke up in that room I thought I would never be happy everyone I knew was gone and I met you. The genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist and I had never been so wrong about someone in my entire life. You proved me wrong. I hated it when you carried the nuke in the wormhole. I was so scared and when you came back I was so relieved. You always beat me up to things you know. Nat had been teasing me about you since we moved in the tower and I had the whole speech planned to ask you out but you beat me to that and asked me out on the date. You did not see me as Captain America I was just Steve to you. Your Steve. I know you say you have forgiven me but I hate myself for what I did to you. One day I hope you could forget everything because I just realised life is to short to not tell the other person how much they mean to you. Tony I do not want to live in a world where you dont exist. I love you and I will always be here because I do not want to spend another moment fighting with you. I know my presence have hurt you enough and I will do whatever will make you happy and safe. Even if that means being away from you. I love you baby" Steve kissed his hand and just held on to it.
"You fell unconscious and Steve caught you. He brought you down and after that he just lost it" Nat replied.
Steve saw Tony nodding at Bucky. The guy was rubbing his left arm up and down and Steve moved slowly towards Tony.
Pepper moved forward and just hugged the man. She knew him well, she knew how stressed he was and here she was dumping all this on him so he could stay busy and not think about anything but she knew he was just trying to be normal and she appreciated that.
"Friday code Whiskey" an arrow was shot and wanda was on the floor. Clint ran towards her and everyone just paused.
"Tony I might want a divorce from Clint I am not sure yet but I just cant forgive him I cant find a will to do that" See said almost crying.
"You know you can get in this blanket Steve, plenty of space" Tony pulled the blanket up and Steve just got in. It felt so right and weird at the same time.
"What is this? Where are my gluten free waffles with some syrup?" Tony asked. Nat and Carol rolled there eyes.
"Why? because I told you my dad made it? is it that the reason that I took it away and now you dont want it" Tony said. He just wanted to know why was Steve being so stupid.
"If you need me I am just a message away you know I will be there" Stephen said and made his portal and went in with Wanda and Vision.
It has been 2 weeks after Bucky's departure. Steve had been a bit quiet. Although he had kind of shifted to Tony's floor as he use to sleep in his lounge or the guest room. Tony did not push him. Steve still use to care for him and bring him meals when he went in the lab but he did not enter Tony's lab. Ross was dismissed until further notice and a inquiry was launched against him. All the avengers were cleared today for duty. Today had also happened to be the day for Tony's and Steve's date. Tony was nervous and that might be the reason he was up for 36 hours. His cast had came off yesterday and the whole team had a small party. Laura and Clint had left to there home as well. Now as everyone was free they were allowed to leave. Right now Nat, Bruce, Sam, Peter, Steve and  Steve had just told him to be ready by 7 pm.
Tony just stood there for a minute. He wasn't sure how Steve could still read him but he knew that he was right. He freshened up and directly went down to his lab. The lab still had Steve's Shield and Tony knew he had to give it back. 6 hours later they heard the avenger alarm. Everyone gathered up in the common room all dressed up.
"Are you sure about that?" Steve replied. Suddenly Tony moved back and looked at him. "Where is this coming from Steve, what's wrong?" Tony did not know what was Steve thinking, they had a lovely afternoon together and Steve was asking if Tony loved him back.
"Hi Mr Hulk" Peter started and Tony just gave him a look. Would this kid stop calling everyone mister.
"I know Tony but I know tomorrow is the day.." Tony interrupted "I know he is coming back and so are the others, are you okay? I know you havent seen Clint in a long time and last time was not pretty"
“I always thought his mother gave birth to him with uniform on and everything.” Johan’s added timidly, and the dam broke. The group of soldiers laughed loudly under the lanterns of Hugel street, inhaling the crisp night air and for one moment at least, ignoring the fear they carried.
"Is that why you have to go?" She knew it was true even if he didn't. "Even when you didn't go after Péter."
“Put this on. Hurry.” Magda threw the coat at him and Steve caught it before it could hit his face, gripping it tightly between his trembling fingers. Gone. Tony and the children might still be alive. At the cabin. Waiting. But they couldn’t wait long. Soon they might be gone for good.
In the interim, we've discussed the possibility of posting some asides from Tony and Steve's childhoods to keep the universe alive (and okay I'll admit it, the thought of not writing this fic for months depresses me) and combat the sound of crickets. We have more than enough world building for it so please let me know if that's something that would interest you and if there's anything in particular your interested in seeing/knowing. Until then friends, so long and farewell.
Tony was rarely late for breakfast. That should have been Steve's first warning, but it happened on occasion, usually when the monk had spent his sleeping hours neck deep in one of his projects.

"I sincerely doubt that Stark." a smooth baritone interrupted Willamina's laughter and Tony tensed, straitening up from where he leaned against the doorframe. The jovial mood drained from the room as all eyes turned to meet the captain's as he entered the kitchen.
In over a year and a half nothing Stefen had said or done (or not said and done for that matter) had shaken that confidence. Antony Stark however, was another matter entirely.
He’d held men before. Held them together when their insides were falling out (sometimes all too literally) and told them to keep breathing. He said it now, for them both, like he would for any of his men, but he couldn’t manage the delusion that he meant it in the same way.
Péter didn’t know. Thankfully he was saved from having to respond by a sudden clap of thunder, much closer this time, and the sudden down pour that followed. Harry cursed, but grabbed Péter’s hand with a grin, and together both boys ran for the shelter of the gazebo.
“You'll have to undo your shirt,” she said, her nimble fingers already undoing his waistcoat. Steve let her, keeping his face turned away.
“In my humble opinion, Sir, it would benefit your goals if you were to wait a while more. Yes? Just to see how things work out.”
“I know. I’m sorry.” Tony stroked Steve’s hand with his free one, skillfully managing to wiggle his fingers under Steve’s and loosen his grip in the process. Steve let him go, his palm burning. He needed to focus. The family was in real danger.
He found Virginia and Julia setting the table in the dining room just as he expected, but Herr Hammer was the real surprise. The butler was in his uniform, looking polished and pressed as he had every morning of the past decade, save the two days previous.
“Enough of this nonsense.  Open the door Herr Stark,” Hammer snapped, gesturing up the stairs. Tony swallowed, mind racing to find some way to keep the men out of the attic but he knew better than to resist any further. That would only rouse the officer’s suspicions.
Bucky got up carefully, adjusting Natacha gently until she lay down and he could tuck a pillow under her head. Tony observed the tenderness of the movements and thought with a strange pang in his chest that it was a pity Bucky had never settled down to have children of his own. For a moment there with Natacha, he’d almost looked soft – like a man the worst of life hadn’t touched.
Steve clung to the dream but the light spilling in from the window dragged him toward wakefulness. Slowly, he opened his eyes and stretched his legs out. His muscles protested and then accommodated, easing to the morning chill in the room. He was stiff from sitting prone for so long. Steve shifted, thinking of his dream, his hand curling on his thigh. He was stiff all over. His eyes flicked nervously to the men lying around the room in their sleeping bags, a few early risers like himself already beginning to stir. It wouldn’t be the first time any of them had seen a man wake up eager, but the pressure in his groin was insistent and he didn’t relish the embarrassment of walking around stiff all morning in front of the men.
“You may take the children,” he finally relented with a sigh and Tony knew better than to get his hopes up, because no sooner had his emotions begun to soar then Rogers delivered the parting blow. “But Bucky and I have too much to do.”
Because Steve had tried to teach him to stand up for others and not to back down even when the odds were stacked against you. Because the chances of the Klein boys making it into Poland were better with him than without him, and that was enough reason for a good man to try.
As more and more of Salzburg's jews found their businesses and properties seized by the officials they were forced to relocate to the only place in the city where they were still allowed to live and do business amongst themselves so long as they kept to themselves and didn't cause trouble.
"Let me get this straight," Abbot Farkas leveled Tony with a hard look, one furious black brow raising skeptically as he regarded Tony carefully, who was pacing the length of his office. "You want my help infiltrating a prison camp, to liberate a pair of criminals?"
James had lost his mother too young and his father had not been well enough to pick up the pieces. He’d been left to pick himself up. Which he did.
She held out her hands and Steve unclenched his fingers with a whimper, the shotgun falling into her outstretched hands. His legs gave up holding him and he slid to the ground, his teeth chattering despite the buzzing of his nerves.
Of course it was better to avoid loud sounds and sudden shouts for the obvious reasons, but sometimes those didn't bother him at all while all it took was a word or a certain smell and he'd be back on the battlefield, smoke in his eyes and canons bursting in his ears.
There were the good citizens scurrying about with their morning errands, blithely ignoring those poor souls who could be spotted wearing the yellow band that marked them as Jews thanks to the newly enforced
His heart stopped, eyes trying to make sense of the sight as the girl who shouldn't have been there raised one thin shaking hand to point accusingly in his direction.
He hesitated for a long moment, unable to determine whether the powerful urge to take it back was gut instinct or fear. He’d learned to trust his instincts, but he was also learning that he’d been confusing the two for far too long.
They all worked side by side, prisoner and freemen alike, temporarily bound together by the same miserable work, the Gestapo urging them along and dissuading any of the prisoners from considering escape. Their presence made Tony anxious, and as the hour clicked closer and closer to the arrival of the afternoon train, the feeling of disquiet in Tony grew and grew, until he was fairly jumping at every shout and every clang of a pickaxe.
Steve and Bucky go to Vienna again for round two of boring meetings and social parties, only this time Steve cant stop thinking about his children, and Tony (but that's because children). There's a handsome prince and his dick of a brother, and intrigue galore. Steve just wants to know if Tony's here yet with the kids. Don't tell Bucky he's not a good bro. He'll fight you. And he doesn't even know what problematic means. Oh and Steve attempts to date Charlotte. That too.
‘That’s why!’ Tony mouthed, giving Stefen a stern glare as he rose with his clothes bundled in his arms. But he didn’t resist it at all when Stefen caught his arm again and tugged him down until their mouths met once more.
There were soldiers everywhere they looked, marching through the wiesn in rows as they were greeted with thunderous applause. The captain was marching up front behind a truck load of tearful people, waving and blowing thankful kisses at the crowd.
Stefen hadn’t moved his hand or even looked away, only said, “I don’t know if I’ll ever see you this way again.”
“Garbage. You were brave enough to see what the rest of us refused to and act on it. You’ve saved his life, probably more times than either of us know. It’s exactly because you are able to see things so clearly and not become encumbered by your own emotions that
Blearily Steve opened his eyes, confused by the brightness coming from the lamp on the bedside and the blurred but distinctly unfamiliar surroundings slowly taking shape around him. This was not the tent his family shared! There was someone looming over him, touching him! Not Ma, not Bucky, not -!
"Is Bucky more important than we are?!" She wailed over his attempt to explain. She'd heard it all already. It was always the same with the captain. There was always a mission, and he would always need her to take care of everything in his absence, and to hold him together when he came back more broken than the last time.
“I know you do, bambina.” He answered with a heavy sigh. “But I say them for you nevertheless, because I know if I don’t, that no one else will and that strikes me as incredibly unfair to you children.”
The boy mouthed something suspiciously like ‘what’ as in the background Hammer hummed like a kettle about to shriek.
Tony opened his mouth but Stefen wrested control of the conversation away from him before he could even begin.
Maria was losing control of her roll. It slipped, falling apart in her fingers and smearing her face as she tried to munch at it.
Bucky didn’t look appeased. Pursing his lips in a resigned manner he sighed.  As Stefen pushed past him to head for the door he heard Bucky shift behind him and entreat his back, “Be careful Stefen. He might be more dangerous than you realize.”
"Do any of you have further questions?" Father asked once silence had fallen once more. He asked in the way that meant now he needed them to be soldiers, strong and clever even if they didn’t understand everything or even want to be.
Be careful. Whether she was talking directly to his deplorable affair with their employer, his somewhat Jewish looks, or simply just a heartfelt plea to make it home in one peace as the world crumbled around them he didn't know. Either way, it didn't' matter. He hung up and walked back upstairs.
The words to the old love song drifted up from his memory as If Peggy were right there beside Tony at the piano, their voices blending together in his head, singing the song of parting lovers.
“Yes… but they said I’ll have to send my rolls back to the manufacturer to get them developed. It could be months before I got it back.” Péter revealed, his hands tightening protectively around the camera. He never went anywhere without it Tony had noticed. He didn’t know if it was because it had belonged to his mother or because it had been a gift from his father. Maybe both.
Stefen looked over at Tony and Tony saw his own questions mirrored in the captain’s gaze. Since Catherine was the name they had been given and Mrs. Hudson was the passphrase, they were as sure as they were likely to get, but this woman was not what either of them had expected.
They worked quietly for a time after that, and eventually the stone sitting in Tony’s chest disappeared. And then, without looking up from his work, Bruce broke the hum drum sounds of the refectory with a sigh and a softly spoken observation.
“I was the one who was always the outsider. The unclean half-breed. The sickly child carrying bad luck. But he called me brother anyway. He gave me a home Tony. The truth is, Bucky followed me so that I wouldn’t die alone, a rom without family. But I didn’t die, and I now I have a family of my own. A new home.” Steve replied and stepped toward Tony with a deliberation that had Tony taking a nervous step back. With deliberation Steve spread the two sides of the necklace apart and slipped the open circle over Tony’s head before he could muster a protest. The coins settled back into place over his ribcage – too right – and Tony choked up, the words dying in his throat.
“But we know plenty of stories by heart.” The brunette said, clapping Stefen upon the shoulder and ignoring his glare as he said to the children, “Your Baka was one of the best story tellers in the- ”
“Antony.” Vonkov practically growled and Steve could feel the tension reverberating off of Tony, though the monk’s expression stayed politely placid as he returned Vonkov’s greeting stiffly.
“It belonged to this guy Archie we served with. Used to read to everybody. When he froze to death we all split up his stuff. Stevie didn’t want nothing but that stupid book.”
Tony was just finishing helping Sara wash her hands and dumping a fresh layer of pine needles over the bucket they were forced to use temporarily as a latrine when the news report began.  At first Tony only kept one ear open, so used to the routine of it now that it took a few moments for him to process that he truly had heard it this time. Stefen’s name. They were talking about Stefen!
in Stevie if I don’t get some supper in me.” Bucky grumbled in reply as Harold led the way inside. “Where are the kids? We should have heard the herd coming by now.”
A midnight adventure gone wrong, Tony guessed as he hurried up the stairs reaching for his pick to unlock the attic door.
Tony would not like this plan but it was all Steve had, the only way he had to be sure that he wouldn’t be leaving his children penniless and at the mercy of the Reich when he died. It would change nothing about them or any of the promises Steve had made to him. Tony would just have to understand and if he didn’t, then Steve would just have to make him.
Holmes wasn’t able to hide the flash of surprise in his eyes at Tony’s announcement. Stefen didn’t even stir, so it was hard to discern whether he had heard. Seeing him look like that, defeated and crushed like all the hope had been taken from him, sharpened the rage inside Tony steel.
“Just fine. Sara is still getting her legs, but give her a year or two and I think she’ll catch the hang of it.”
It felt like several lifetimes, but the morning did finally come. The 28th of March, the very day that the coded letter from Holmes had said the British officer (who was to be their liaison with the French and get them safely to the port at Dunkirk) would meet them at the Basilica of Notre Dame on Victory Avenue. It was hours yet till noontime, but they could not linger at the synagogue longer than it took to repack their things and eat the meager meal that the women served up in the hall.
“I-I’m s-sorry Tony.” James stammered through chattering teeth, his voice barely above a whine. He looked up at Tony with round glassy eyes and Tony’s heart crumpled. He stooped, hauling the shivering boy up into his arms and holding him tight. Swallowing back the block in his throat he gestured sharply with his head for Péter and Ian to grab the door and carried James inside. Natacha who must have been watching at the window met them at the door.
"Here bambina put this on." Tony draped his own coat over her shoulders, and she smiled again, gratefully, the garment pooling around her dramatically.
Although it wasn’t in Tony’s official duties to mind the children after their lessons had ended for the day, it was safe to say that by now no one in the Rogers household (least of all Tony) was going to try and pretend that his duties didn’t fall somewhere messily between governess and surrogate parent. Not that Tony was under any illusions to who the real parent was and how quickly he could lose his place in the house.
dance Herr Stark?” the countess asked poignantly, drawing his attention once more and Tony forced another smile.
Tony shot him a calculating look before tipping the bottle to his lips, effectively dismissing him. Steve tightened his jaw. It wasn’t going to be that easy. Hatred or no hatred, Steve would keep Tony safe.
"Yes." Tony answered low and quick. Maria's eyes filled with tears but Tony was already shaking his head, brushing them away with his thumbs almost before they'd even finished welling. He leaned forward and kissed her forehead, then Artur's, stroking her brother’s cheek as he murmured in low rapid-fire Italian, "Just for a little while. I can't explain. I wish I could. But I promise it won't be forever. I'm going to come get you. But you can't say anything about it. You understand?  You just have to trust me."
The thought whispered insidiously inside of his head like the snake must have whispered to Eve. And trust Farkas to get under his skin like this, have him thinking about and twisted up over old stories and myths that amounted to nothing.
“I don’t know why that horrible woman always thinks she can cheat me. I can spot the handiwork of a machine a mile away.” She grumbled as they trudged through the crowds with their many boxes and bags towards the automobile where Harold waited, lace placemarks acquired on discount.
“What about Italian?” Tony offered, pausing only to roll his eyes right back at Natacha before continuing.  “All the greatest music is in Italian Maria and you’ll want to know how to read it yes?
He’d seen the star on her sleeve when her shawl had slipped but dared not draw attention to it, neither wanting to put her or the kindly Frau Richter at risk. But Stefen had seen. Tony had seen it on his face as he’d watched the woman flee the shop. He’d held his breath terrified at what Stefen might do.
His office smelled heavily of burnt paper these days. Hughard’s office had smelled like that, near the end, like secrets burned in the dark.
“Not exactly.” Tony answered, shutting the door of the workshop behind him. “She’s bigger, to carry more passengers, but her engine is going to make her the fastest thing on the water. Big bottom or no.”
“It would be difficult for them to make it up here anyhow,” Dagmar grunted in response, and Karlina sighed, commiserating. “Life on the mountain can be hard. But we help each other through. Dagmar, in the morning you’ll help him find the way back. I’ll send you both with some fresh linens and my good soup.”
mattered he realized with startling clarity, his eyes stinging and his throat convulsing around a swelling sob. A hand gentle and achingly familiar rubbed his scalp, fingers threading through his hair. He knew it wasn’t really there, just like the voices in his head, but that didn’t make it feel any less real.
Good, Bucky thought. The rescue was done. Lucas and his companions on Kirk’s ship and probably half way to London by now. It was over, and now maybe Steve could think about getting the hell out of Austria and leaving the damn Germans far behind them.
There was no gentleness in the kiss. It was demanding and rough, too much too quick, and it was Tony who tore his mouth away first - to preserve what wits he had left – pushing at Stefen's chest grateful when the man stumbled back enough for him to stagger away from the door and put some much needed distance between them.
He could hold his liquor, he was a captain after all, but something about the sight of his cup being filled with black made him nearly giggle.
"The police will be looking for us, won't they?” Ian asked, shifting on the seat next to James and poking him with his elbow. “What if someone recognizes our names and they turn us in?"
Tony tucked the letter back into the pocket of his trousers (that’s three times now he’d read it, one would think it was some great literature) grimaced at the heat, and then decided once more that it was time to take action and end all their misery.
It was dotted and line with cedar and maple trees, its crowning feature a glittering fish pond with a small bubbling fountain at the center.
“Dagmar. You’re frightening the poor child.” Karlina scolded from the kitchen but Dagmar just continued to stare at Ian as if he could peel back his skin and see behind it.
She hoped it was soon, but not too soon. After the ladies from the Women’s Labor Force had come and gone would be best. Charlotte was doing her very best to craft the illusion of the aryan ideal – of untouchability – around the family, but it made her head spin thinking about how quickly things could turn sour if either James or Stark were present.  Stark was dark featured, brazenly outspoken, and Italian in the absolute worst way. And one look at James Bakhuizen was all it took to know he didn’t have so much as a drop of true German blood in him, and God love him but James wasn’t any more likely to hold his tongue than Stark was.
Cruel hands gripped is face, brutally twisting his neck until he was eye to eye with the blurred creature swaying above him. His eyes leaked with tears from the wave of pain. There was nothing he could do but ride it.
"You mean, you’re going to tell them about grandmother?" Natacha asked, finally lifting her head up to look at him just long enough for him to nod again.
"Well it's obvious, isn’t it? Nobody knows the man by face. You've seen one man in a ridiculous robe you've seen them all. We'd need the abbot's help; but with a letter with the right stamps on it, there's no reason Cardinal Rossi can't show up early to take a few more lost lambs than originally expected. There will be confusion, suspicion, but with the stunt the Nazi’s just pulled, and a public to convince their actions were justified, they can't afford the church to start preaching against them in earnest. Which means they can't afford to piss off Cardinal Rossi because somebody messed up the paperwork."
It was like they were crouched in wait he realized as he passed the black car and the man sitting in it, pretending to read a newspaper. They were holding their breath for a signal, and Bucky could feel the anticipation for it crackling against his skin.
James dropped his armful of wood, either not seeing or ignoring altogether his father's vague look of disapproval, and trotted over to Ian.
Péter rolled over on his bed, scowling at his dark empty room which felt almost like a stranger's room. He recognized his things: his books, his clothes, a few of the unfinished inventions he'd started before going off to school - they might as well have belonged to someone else. Some other Péter who hadn't jumped from the back of a moving train and been shot at. Who hadn't seen people rounded up into a barn and burned. Some kid whose biggest worry was whether or not his father paid enough attention to him.
Five ducklings accounted for Tony continued his search, finding Péter once more in a group with the older children from the youth programs. He was talking to a pretty brunette and there was a faint blush on his cheeks that might have been blamed on the cold, if not for the way Harry and Bobby were standing behind him, snickering and trading all sorts of looks between them.
Once the guests got over the shock that they would be picnicking outdoors and playing rudimentary country games with his neighbors, most everyone got into the spirit of things rather quickly. It helped too that participating in the games and guzzling down Willamina’s hot cider was the best way to keep warm against autumns nip.
When Captain Rogers had picked her up that night she’d been expecting Péter and Natacha to be tagging along since she’d been the one to suggest bringing them in the first place. But it had become clear at the first sight of the (very) full car that met her at her door that he’d misunderstood her to mean that he should bring all
"I looked all over for you asshole, nobody had any idea you were lurking in the fucking attic listening to illegal broadcasts."
Steve had meant to keep his cool, but once he’d begun to speak the words had hissed out of him like tightly compressed air. All the anger boiling to the surface. Tony stared back at him, the slight widening of his eyes the only hint of emotion he allowed on his face. Was it shock? Fear? Steve had no idea and that just made him angrier.
Tony heard his feet crunching in the snow before his cousin Grigur appeared, joining Tony where he sat on the bench in the yard watching Stefen go about his morning exercise.
“And Hammer -” The butler stopped at the door, head tilted slightly to indicate he was listing. Frau Hogan injected a chilling amount of sweetness into her tone as she finished. “No need to return. The baroness and I will see to our guest’s needs, thank you.”
"Lehnsherr is German. The rising tensions in Germany before Hitler came to power had him retreat from the pubic and the last fifteen years or so has seen him living like a recluse on old family land. The Rom do not like outsiders, but they have been known to make expectations for those willing to allow them to camp on their land undisturbed. The rest I'm sure you can put together yourself."
Tony stiffened. The question was unexpected but not wholly surprising. Not after that bout of insanity he'd displayed praying for that poor bastard who'd died right under his hands.
He buried his face in his pillow with a deep groan, biting into the soft fabric as he bucked into his fist, the bed frame rattling against the wall.
He could see that his behavior was putting the children on edge. He wasn’t any good for them like this, but he refused to leave them unprotected. Charlotte made a good effort to separate them and send him to bed for rest but there was no help for it, the minute Steve stepped out of the room (even just to talk to Virginia) one of them was calling for him in a frightened voice that had him back at their side in seconds.
Other people might be impressed to receive an invitation to the Führer’s home. But more and more Ian was beginning to think Tony had been right, and that other people were too stupid to know better. They had to be stupid to try and forget so quickly what they had done. Ian hadn't forgotten. Nobody wanted to talk about the riot. Least of all Ian, who could still remember the way his heart had lurched and pounded like it might come out of his chest when that man had grabbed Maria to take her. He wasn't sure where. Away, somewhere... or maybe just to hurt her.
Between them all they were able to unload quickly and make their way inside the building, where Herr Grimm led them up a narrow stairway and into a tiny apartment. As they walked, Herr Grimm explained in a few muttered breaths that the building was mostly deserted.
“Yes, those! I want to learn about spiders! And all the other animals, bugs too!” the boy paused for a quick breath and then added as an afterthought “Please!”
“Ah, I see. Nevertheless, “She kept her expression pleasant while she continued to deny him. Emil was not a boy who liked to be told no. “My Father will have sent the driver. We don’t live in the city.”
“Peliali?” Tony asked, though he didn’t truly need to. The girl had her mother’s look, Maria’s South-American roots still telling tales through the dusky hue of her daughter’s skin. The young woman nodded but did not step closer.
He chuckled deep in his throat. Stark was anything but that. He was so many things really… too many to properly put labels on him, but that didn’t stop his mind from trying.
It had to be Stefen. All of the pieces were there, but Bucky could not figure out why he would have left with the woman. He was probably still weak, not well enough to travel long distances on foot, but Steve wouldn’t have forced her to escort him somewhere. The damn fool would most likely have set out on his own and passed out not five feet from the farm. But the timing of her disappearance was too close to mean anything but that she’d taken Steve somewhere. But where? Bucky couldn’t very well ask her from prison. If she was even still alive at this point.
will tell if someone is here. Do you trust him to tell you the truth more than me?” Magda’s voice rang out, filled with agitation. And fear. Steve could hear it though she tried her best to hide it. His muscles clenched tighter in an effort to keep still. It was dark and musty under the blanket, the air thick with dust and straw tickled in his healing lungs.
The likelihood that they were walking into a trap was small but there and Steve was glad once more to have Bucky at his side. It was more comforting even then the gun he had tucked against his side. He knew that Bucky was armed as well. Nobody was a better shot than Bucky and when it came to defending them he wouldn’t hesitate.
As Ian and Péter rose from their seats and reluctantly gathered their things, James still looked as if he were deciding whether or not to expend the energy on having a fit and Tony tried to cut him off at the crossroad.
His heart hammering within his chest Tony was certain the captain meant to strike the boy and he had the fleeting thought to jump between them, but quickly discarded the thought as foolish. One did not jump between a charging bull and the cloak. Better to take the cloak away from foolish matador.
“Well perhaps that business won’t keep us too long.” Stefen returned after a beat. “Artur might be driven to murder if he missed Nockerl.”
“I d-don’t know where Daniel is. He never came b-back from the party. What if they got him too?” Cameron began to choke and even though Tony’s chest was tight and he was finding it difficult himself to breathe, he wrapped the boy up in his arms and held him as he sobbed.
Tony left them to it, shedding his coat and his gloves as quickly as he could and rushing toward Stefen’s room. He’d heard how clean that engine sounded. Automobiles of that caliber were for the wealthy or the government connected, and nobody wealthy drove a car that nondescript. Stefen’s bedroom door was closed as he approached but he could hear low voices inside. He had no idea what excuse he was going to come up with for interrupting what was clearly a closed doors meeting, but he’d figure it out as he went. They’d already made one attempt on Stefen’s life, he wasn’t going to give them the chance to make another.
It wasn’t public knowledge yet of course, but the Wehrmacht had plans to send him to the research facility at Dachau while they slowly unveiled the details of the investigation to the common people. A slow but necessary rebranding. A worse fate for any man Deiter could not imagine, then to be under the knives of the researches at Dachau, but at least it would not be very long. When they were done poking him full of holes, they’d execute him, not quietly but for the whole world to see. And the people would cheer. Or so they hoped.
Dvorak was down, a pool of blood spreading out around him like angels' wings against white clouds of snow. Bucky released the breath he’d been holding long and slow and looked away from the grim sight and unslung his pack from his back to begin reloading his rifle.
The next day Tony and the children had been busy practicing, having only a few hours to get together the program they would perform and to calm their nerves. This was only the second time they’d performed in public and unlike at the Officer’s ball, Tony knew that there would be hundreds crowding the fairgrounds. He’d gotten them dressed in their uniforms and then they’d all piled into the back of the car they’d be using to join the parade line.
Karlina had gone still and was looking at him now too, like a cat might consider the shadows where a mouse was hiding.
Péter stared down at his plate, shoulders tight, looking angrier than he’d been before. He looked on the verge of saying something but he bit his tongue.
“We’re going to change his mind.” Tony announced and he didn’t miss the alarmed looks Péter and Natacha traded. “Rumor has it, he used to enjoy music. It’s a shame don’t you think, that he’s forgotten? There are enough terrible things in the world, it’s a pity to forget one of its most beautiful. But we’re going to remind him and by the time we finish you’ll sound so lovely he’ll forget all about laws against music.” He promised, touching Maria’s nose. The little girl beamed at him.
With a sharp nod, Stefen turned and strode from the study with militant stride, his back ramrod straight and his hands fisted tight, leaving Tony staring after him with the memory of the hurt in those eyes haunting his every thought.
The red coral complemented his coloring, and the flat gold coins were cool and heavy as they settled against his skin, just under his pectorals, right above where his heart was thudding so loudly.
She didn’t know what it meant to be Roma. Not the way he did. She was as much part of the people who had enslaved and hated gypsies for hundreds of years as she was a gypsy herself. Rightfully more so, but even here, the way he looked at her offered no judgment.
Tony was right outside his door. Steve could imagine that the slight thunk he heard was of Tony’s hand landing against it to steady himself.
He was yanked from the dream at the sound of a thump. Eyes fixed on the ceiling, Steve struggled to calm his breathing as his eyes darted around the room.
"C-Captain -" Hammer stuttered but Steve quickly overrode his objection, wanting the situation over and dealt with.
Tony felt rather than heard Stefen move, the skin on the back of his neck prickling with heat a moment before the captain breathed his name lowly in the quiet room.
Except- Steve skid to a halt, heart hammering in his chest - in front of him lay three figures, their bodies sprawled out haphazardly on the ground. A child half covered by the body of a man with jet black hair.
"Good luck Wanda I hope you will have a nice time at Kamar Taj. If you dont you can come back if you dont like it there" Tony said softly. He knew Wanda did not like her and somewhere still blamed him for her parents death. Suddenly Wanda just hugged Tony. Everyone was surprised including Steve.
Tony was walking Stephen to his room the one Nat had prepared for him. Nat, Carol and Peter went to his floor instead and told him to see them later. He still did not understand what was all that about. Strange always wanted to get things done quickly and go back. He remember him mentioning something about Kamar Taj and how he could not leave it for a long time. They entered Stephen's room.
The moment Steve opened his eyes he knew what had happened. He was so busy fighting the 2 robots that he did not notice the third one. It was just miscalculated he believed. The doctor has told him about his injuries, Nat and Sam were currently with him.
"Steve look at me he is going to be fine Steve look at me" Nat made Steve look at her. Making sure she kept the eye contact. Rhodey was moving towards Steve but Carol just stood at her place.
"Remember when you were there and this guy was interested in Science. You started teaching him about your technology instead of letting him read the books" Stephen replied.
"Well did it occur that I do not want to talk to you or see you?" Tony said he did want to take it back but it was already said.
"My name is Steve Rogers you must be here for Wanda" Steve introduced himself. Stephen went and stood in front of him taking his hand to shake. They had a strong hand shake.
Tony's hand was itching, all he needed was a glass of whiskey. Yeah that would calm him down but he had promised them all that he will not. After Steve left him Alcohol was the best thing to him. It did not ask questions, help him ease pain and did not leave him behind like Steve. He loved it so much that ended up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Happy and Pepper came to visit him and found him passed out. After that day they made him give up Alcohol. However, right now that would really help him he thought. He sat at the table and motioned Steve to sit in front of him. He was on alert if Steve tried to attack at least he will have Friday ready with suit.
"He is just upset you know how he is. He is blaming himself for breaking the family and what was said about you" Nat replied.
"Hey Steve it is okay calm down Tones will be fine okay?" Rhodey said putting his hand on Steve's shoulder.
"Okay dont be all mushy with me. What have you thought about Wanda" Tony asked backing away from Stephen.
Steve prayed that Tony will listen to him once he had so much explaining to do and all he wanted was Tony back and he would do anything to get him back. Whereas Tony sat in his lab panicking about the whole morning. He couldnt believe how he had managed all that. He was angry at Steve. How dare he come back and start asking to talk to me. But Tony knew he will have to talk to him as the Team had to be one and he did not have enough time left.
"Yeah, I think he does" Tony replied with a smile and Peter just nodded and hugged him. He took Tony back to his room and left.
Steve was losing his cool thats what use to happen when they use to fight. Tony always brought the best and worst in him. He knew what buttons to push. "You want to know why? because every fucking time I look at that shield all I remember is how I slammed it in your chest and you could have been dead because of me" Steve shouted back and Tony stilled. This was not the answer he was expecting. Steve just sat back on the sofa. It felt so weird admitting it out loud. He was ashamed and angry at himself. He did not cry much but this admission made his heart hurt.
After 20 minutes everyone was back in the common room. Stephen was standing a bit to close to Tony for Steve but he did not say anything and just averted his eyes.
"Strange for god sake get your Cloak away from me. You Cloak make up your mind one day this thing is hitting me and next its hugging me. Tony said annoyed but he was not that annoyed. Strange just rolled his eyes and it came back. Steve just stood there. He was not liking this at all.
"Thank you Tony, I know you suggested Stephen for Vision to come with me. You have done enough for all of us and I think if you can forgive Barnes I can forgive you too" She whispered. Tony just looked at her he wanted to cry but he couldnt. "Thank you Wanda" He whispered. He was so grateful for that.
"Its okay Barnes. You did good okay? you just have to relax and look at me. I will be there in the room and just look at me no matter what and we will get through this okay?" Tony went over to Bucky crouched down to his seat. Steve wanted to go and calm Bucky down but seeing this made him happy. This was all he wanted Tony and Bucky getting along.
"Cap what happened to your knuckles" Scott asked and everyone started looking at him. Tony knew what happened. he knew Steve must be angry about something because thats what he does when gets angry.
"STOP EVERYONE! enough. Carol I know you do not like them but please do not start a fight. Guys you need to back off as well. You will say something and trust me she will bite. Everyone just calm down" Tony said in a high voice so everyone could be clear.
"Yeah Carol, Nat and Pepper remodelled it" Tony replied. Steve looked around and everything was different their picture on the bedside was missing. The whole room was changed.
"Everything cant be fixed Steve" Tony gave him a sad smile. "Lets go down the sun is out and I want some coffee" Steve just nodded and followed Tony.
Clint saw his family and his eyes were already filling up with tears it was so long he had not seen any of them. He was so excited to move and kiss Laura and his kids. However, everyone seemed a bit weird he thought. His eyes went on Nathaniel he hadnt seen him since he was 2 months old and now he is all grown up. He moved forward to kiss Laura
"Tony we love you just remember that" Nat said and he smiled at her and turned to see everyone nodding.
"Friday initiate protocol Lima Delta 5612 Alpha. I want complete lock down and do not let anyone in. No override codes nothing" Tony said and started working on his suit. He just wanted to work and forget about everything else. He just wanted a normal moment with Steve and he just couldnt even do that.
"I cant lose him you know. I have made that mistake once and I didnt knew about his health you know. He hated me and I hated myself. I still do but I knew he was alive. Tony not-" Steve paused and took a deep breath and continued "Him not existing in this world that would kill me. I dont even know what will I do"
"Tony please I will do anything I promise whatever you want just don't leave. I know I have hurt you and I did not know the damage I had caused till it happened. I please just I am so sorry I am so sorry" Steve was desperate and Tony knew that but he knew he had to protect himself because honestly in the end you have to protect yourself.
"Well Cap you knew how weak my heart is and that force you hit me with you knew what it could do to me. I would have died if Carol did not show up. Honestly, that would be better if she-"
"How are you Steve, since Tony left you went for run and did not show up for dinner or anything we were just worried" Bucky asked. he knew his friend better than anyone.
Bucky was being taken away and Tony saw it from his side. All the council members were present outside.
"Tony I just wanted to apologise for everything I did not get the chance to but I want to-" Bucky was interrupted by Tony.
"I dont hate you Steve" Tony said looking in Steve's painful eyes. They were red and he knew Steve was hurting.
"Nice to meet you Steve" Tony said and laughed. Steve smiled at him. How much did he miss this laugh.
"I will see you guys in one hour" Stephen said and started walking with Tony. Steve did not like this at all he wanted to go with them. why were they going alone to his bedroom. He felt better when Peter, Nat and Carol followed them.
"Who the hell is Barnes" The winter soldier announced and ran towards Tony. Tony shot a repulsor at him but making sure it would only put him down. The soldier dodged and took Tony's hand while dislocating it and throwing him across the room. Outside everyone was panicking and Bruce knew he could not turn into Hulk as it would jeopardise this whole thing and the other guy was not happy. They all knew who did this. While Soldier was beating up Tony. Carol moved towards Steve who was trying to break the door. The door had dents in but was still not opening.
"I am okay Tony just trying to make peace with Bucky being gone and Clint as well you know" Steve answered honestly. "What about you? I know you havent been sleeping and dont ask me how. I am just worried" Steve said.
"Surp- what happened Mr Stark!" Peter ran towards Tony and looking at him. His one eye was black and he had 2 cast and bruises. Tony looked like when he came back from the hospital after Siberia.
"Okay guys I am off I will see you guys tomorrow at 2 pm. Nat Stephen is coming in so make sure his room is ready I do not want to hear him yapping all day"
As soon as the lift opened to the ground floor Steve stood there. Steve saw Tony and took 2 step back and looked at everywhere except Tony's face. He did not want to hurt or upset Tony anymore.
"Nice to meet you Carol" Steve said. He knew who she was Tony use to talk about her. He was happy she was back in Tony's life as he missed her.
"Well Mr Rogers what is it that you cannot say in front of us?" Carol said making sure he could listen to the hatred in her voice.
Everyone was gathered in the room. Carol came and hugged him, he loved how she did not super coat things for him ever that was one of the few things he admired about her. He knew she also made Rhodey happy. She worked with Avengers but no one except Him, Rhodey and Nat knew about her powers after the whole accident. She could fly, had fire in her fist, she could manipulate minds but that was something that she never did. It was similar to Wanda but she knew once that power was used you could not stop.
"Peter enough!" Tony did not raise his voice but he had voice in his command. He knew Peter was upset and he knew why he thought it was Steve's fault but it was not.
If I attach this in the arm this will make it warm which is going to be good but the depth and the circumference wasnt exactly what he wanted and-suddenly there was a knock.
"Okay common lets eat something I am starving and my husband has made amazing steaks right honey?" Carol spoke and went to give Rhodey a kiss.
"Vision spoke to her in the morning and told her that if she wants something with him than she has to listen to us because we have best interest in our mind which we do so I am hoping she will agree"
"Captain follow me I have to go soon so can we talk whatever you want to talk about" Tony said walking towards kitchen.
Rather than pout or protest as Tony half expected Artur nodded and fell against him. Tony jerked as Artur’s arms wrapped around him and squeezed.
Péter’s room was next. Tony wasn't sure what he had been expecting but it was, oddly, not the mess of books and knick knacks cluttering the room, enough for two boys he'd wager. It did look fresh however.
Steve breathed in deep, the rush of air flowing into his lungs almost too much as he came back to his surroundings.
“What happened?” he prodded gently when the silence had stretched too long and Banner’s face twisted in a mockery of a smile.
Captain Rogers, children?” and she continued quietly after he confirmed. “Antony. No, this is- is no good. He is a bad man. A very bad man.”
“Don’t touch me,” he snarled irrationally, leaning back so far that he almost tipped over again. And if he weren’t so paralyzed with the fear of it, he would have kicked himself for scaring off her touch. He had to let her get closer, and yet the very thought of it was enough to make his whole body break out in sweat. He could feel the phantom pain of a hidden knife, of whips, boots, and sharp slaps to the face, the blunt pressure of a hit to the back of his head.
“Christ in heaven!” Tony cursed, tasting blood in his mouth from where he’d bit his tongue and turning to spit in the dirt beside the door before turning back to hiss in demand at the boy who’d just literally dropped in on him. “Clinton, you imp. What the hell are you doing here at this time of night?!”
The hens flapped around her, suddenly agitated, and Magda looked over her shoulder to find her younger sister stood by the fence, hands empty of garden tools. There was a stunned and confused expression frozen on Ona's face that had dread dropping into Magda’s stomach. Was it their parents? Was it Franz? He was becoming more and more outspoken at university. Outraged at the way his former professors had been treated when Hitler came to power.
because it was what his hands and mind were good for. And if he couldn’t ignore the voice that whispered it was the
“Yes it is,” she replied. She glanced at his fingers, and Steve noted the whitening of his knuckles. He might be hurting her, but if he was it didn’t show on her face. The feeling of sickness rolled through him and he shoved it down. Down down down down, where it couldn’t leach his strength and keep him from doing the things he had to do.
“Well then you don’t know what you’ve got. Do your children play? There’s seven of them I assume one of them plays, you could have your own merry band of Rogers’ players. Do they sing too? All hours of the night I’m sure. It won’t be a problem, well not for me, monk and all. Up all hours anyway, midnight vespers is great preparation for overzealous opera singers,” Tony babbled and the Captain's face twitched, something unidentifiable fluttering over his blank mask. In the face of his silence it seemed that Tony’s brain to mouth filter remained as unreliable as it had ever been.
“Two nights ago, James Bahkhuizen resisted arrest and interrogation, and shot an intelligence officer.” Agent Neuman warned darkly, slapping a stack of wrinkled black and white photos down upon the table where Lt. Stevens sat, finishing his lunch alone.
The sun dipping low in the sky and the rumbling of hungry stomachs was finally enough to convince the Rogers children to abandon the water entirely. Tony was partly grateful for it because after so many hours in the cool water of the lake even his over eager libido had flagged.
“Two men, wanted to know which of them was the fairest. Frankly, I thought they were both ugly as sin.” Tony rubbed at Stefen’s arms, reminding him to loosen his grip. He flinched when Steve reached and his fingers found the corner of the largest bruise. “Ouch. As you can see, the pipe didn’t agree with me.”
Additionally this chapter touches on the romantic feelings of a minor towards an adult. This is where the Bucky/Natasha tag starts coming into play. I understand that this may be a triggering subject or a squick for some.That's absolutely fine. But so there is no confusion from the start, I want to state it plainly. Here in this stage of her life, Natasha feels how she feels about Bucky. Bucky has no romantic interest in children, nor would he entertain an advance if she were brave enough to make one. This is not that kink or that fic. He's MIA so he doesn't have to adress Natasha's feelings. Tony chooses to treat them as if they are valid and natural because they are. :) I wanted him and the story to allow her to be a whole person with all the complexity that requires. I hope I succeeded.
“It’s still Christmas Tony. Reich or no Reich,” she’d said, pointing to one of the adventskranz that decorated the hall tables, before continuing to pull on her gloves. She was right he realized, seeing that the second candle had been lit. Tony didn’t doubt that one of the maids was responsible for lighting the decorative ones in the hall, but he’d seen Pepper assisting James and the little ones with putting together the big one that decorated the table in the sitting room.
“Father! Uncle Bucky!” a near dozen young voices called out in various orders and the whole lot of them abandoned their lesson to come greet them.
Tony's last morning of freedom dawned bright, but clouded, the sun casting the sky in delicate pink and gold. It promised to be another beautiful summers day. An auspicious beginning for any man's last morning, regardless of its deceptive promises.
"Really?" Tony scoffed, "you're going to hold your future hostage over some pipe dreams I scribbled in a journal when I couldn't sleep once?"
“But the Führer doesn’t want Czechoslovakia. He just wants the Sudetenland, and now we’ve got it.” Julia refuted desperately, ringing her hands. Pepper placed a steadying hand on the younger woman’s arm and gave Tony a very purposeful look.
Or maybe whoever was looking for him had found him.  It went unspoken between them, but no less loud for it. Steve clenched his teeth together until he thought that they would crack.
"I don’t think anyone survived the blast." Lucas commented from where he was leaning against the truck, with a tired jerk of his head toward the pile of burning metal behind them.
When had she learned to dip her bread? It was a habit Steve himself had had to break long before she was born. Good table manners helped make the difference from one class to the next and, in his opinion, was one of the only differences.
“Will you take her for a moment? Thank you.” Tony didn’t give the man much choice as he handed the child over, it was between accepting her and dropping her which considering how much beer the man had swimming in his system was almost a near thing.
Stefen was sitting up in bed, Bucky sitting at his feet on the end of it. Both men had turned to look at him but it was Brother Filip sitting in the chair across from the fireplace wearing a smart suit, with his hair neatly combed and polished shoes that flabbergasted Tony.
Stark laughed and quipped something about it being quite enjoyable, and Bucky tore his eyes away from the god damn spectacle they insisted on making of themselves and quickly glanced to Charlotte. Charlotte just looked amused from where she stood at Stefen’s side, seemingly unaware of the current flowing between Steve and Stark as she watched the conversation unfold.
“You’re right. If they separate them, we’ll never get them all back. But we can’t sneak them out of here. It will be easier to take them on the road, but we need them all in the same place.”
Tense, Steve watched and waited as Tony’s relatives digested the revelation. An entire unspoken conversation seemed to pass between them all before Isiah smiled somewhat ruefully and quipped, “You teach them to talk, and they teach you silence.”
Steve paled, the blood draining from his bruised face, and lifted his hand to reach for him but Bucky jerked away. Stark grabbed at his shoulders, taken off guard at his sudden movement and Bucky snarled wrenching himself hard to escape his reach.
The man tilted his head just slightly and reached out a hand to touch the wall next to his bunk. He began to tap the same tune in response only a bit faster. “I recognize it. We play the same song in Liechtenstein only a little faster.” he said, and tapped again, a ghost of a smile tugging at his lips.
"I’m telling you the time to strike is now while he’s down. You'll regret it if you don’t, mark me. Stalking through the house all hours of the day and night armed to the teeth! He's not the type to go quietly. You know what I say-"
The thought of being miles in the air and at the mercy of the skill of Captain D’Anvers and her crew made Steve’s chest tight but he got on with it. They didn’t have time to waste and the children would benefit from a strong show of courage.
"Ugh, I can't stand it." Coming up beside him once more Rogue hissed in the dark, already reaching for it as she demanded. "Spider give me your brush."
Anya and Péter shared wide eyed looks of fright and Tony wondered if they’d even understood the Captain’s words. Péter clutched his sister’s hands tightly and drew her backward and Pepper’s eyes flew to the captain anxiously.
As Stefen sang his eyes slowly moved over the faces of the audience, establishing a connection with each one as the song carried them back to memories of their childhood. Tony was in the kitchen with Ana and Jarvis, the radio playing, Ana humming along with the old folk tune, the scent of sugar and apricots filling the air.
They’d made it back to their hotel room and Steve had closed the door firmly behind them. When Tony strode towards the bedroom like he was on a mission, Steve followed, feeling the beginnings of a fight coming on and resenting it when all he’d wanted since they’d left was to have Tony in his arms again.
“Warmed leftovers prepared by my own two hands. I’m sure that appeals to your tender sensibilities.” A grin at the indignant sound that escaped from Tony was the only sign he gave of paying any attention to him as he then turned to James and said, “It couldn’t be helped. They had to catch the early train.”
“Zvekan!” Bucky cursed softly, some of the anger slipping from his voice, “let me get a good look at you.” He tilted Steve’s head and inspected the fading work of General Schmidt's men. Steve let him because the bite of Bucky's finger against his chin was as grounding as it had always been.
Stefen shifted and buried his face in Tony’s neck, hot breath splashing over Tony’s skin sending distracting shivers through his body so that he almost didn’t hear the low rumble of his voice as he asked, “The season?”
Steve shook his head to clear it. The monk had to go. He needed a proper tutor and Antony Stark was a laughable liability he couldn't afford.
She was right in all that she'd said. He was putting the family at risk. He could only hope that one day she would understand why he’d had to go.
“You ought to stop by and see me, to get your official ancestry credentials. You need them to marry, and it would be a shame to waste genes like yours. Hughard was a man of genius and I can see by your enlarged -” Tony’s eyes widened, wondering what on earth was going to come out of the woman’s mouth next, but thankfully that moment another voice intruded.
He was on his father’s shoulders, the ocean crystal blue spraying up around them as they ran through the waves on the pebbly shore.
To Tony’s delight, his pupils dilated tellingly. Stefen turned his head, perhaps to hide them from Tony’s view (too late) and grit his teeth.
“Frighteningly so.” Rogers drawled and the smirk only widened. Now the resemblance was uncanny. Or perhaps not. He was the boy’s father after all. Why shouldn’t they resemble each other? Tony could not figure out why he always tempted to wax poetic where Captain Rogers was concerned. There was only one thing for it. Tony would take the man’s invitation to share his thoughts, because who was he to waste a perfectly good invitation like that. Smiling once more into his cup Tony took a fortifying sip before lowering cup and saucer to the table.
“He’s right you know,” Tony assured them. “It’s just the sky making noise at us. Some people are like that. All hot air. You know what you have to do though, when someone speaks to you that way?”
"You heard me." Tony continued undaunted by Steve’s tone, fire burning in his eyes. "They despise you! Hate every last thing running through your blood that makes you good, hate your people, hate what goes through your mind and your heart!”
“I’ve heard what they do to people.” Peter admitted boldly, jaw working stubbornly. “I’ve seen it. How can you fight for them?”
Dr. Fischer’s eyes snapped up to the housekeeper at the bold announcement, his hand freezing with the needle mere inches from the man's forearm. The glare he shot the woman was intense and cold, heavy with the full might of the Reich behind it and Frau Hogan shivered. A gossamer motion, but there all the same. Still she didn't move and her voice was steady as she insisted, “I think it for the best.”
“Heads will roll if any harm comes to me!” he shrieked unnecessarily. The two soldiers examined the papers in a rush, their eyes continuously drawn back toward the camp where smoke and shouts continued to rise. Tony saw immediately the moment they decided not to risk delaying his exit with further questions.
There was a slight pause and then Ian heard a very familiar voice reply, “Yes. Thank god. Is he here?”
"Why would I want to deny it?" Ian asked, confused, and Rita and her friend traded a glance before bursting into giggles.
“A man with seven children to his credit can hardly afford to be making that face Stefen,” Tony quipped, appearing at Steve’s side suddenly. Steve felt his cheeks heat in a prickle of embarrassment. He shot Tony a look, but it was hard not to laugh when he saw the mirth dancing in the monk’s eyes and the exaggerated smirk he wore.
"I am here for you Tony till the end" Steve whispered. Tony just looked at him and leaned in so did Steve and their lips met. It was a tender kiss. It was like assuring each other that they were here. Tony pulled back and sighed. Steve was looking at him and a blush was spreading on Steve's face.
Finding it, he shoved the pistol back into his pocket and grasped the first handhold, his feet finding the appropriate notch with some minor scrambling. He’d memorized the placings so the noise was minimal but he still flinched, hoping that the soft sounds he made would be mistaken for that of a squirrel or something similar.
“Which country is that exactly, Natacha, Germany or Austria?” Tony rebutted with a curious lift of one eyebrow. His gaze fixed on his oldest female charge didn’t prevent him from noticing the way James’ mouth had fallen slightly open and the other children were moving their heads back and forth between him and Natacha like spectators at a tennis match.
"I saw plenty of grenades back in the war," the ex-soldier grunted, focusing once more on Tony, his dark brows narrowing. "But nothin with a blast like that."
Steve let him go, the anger that had gripped him already crumbling in the wake of memory and the absurd desire to poke his tongue out at his old friend.
Well shit. All right. He'd have expected the nosiness from James or Tacha, but Ian came as a surprise. He was the quiet boy, the shy one. All the soft parts of Peggy and Steve. But then again, Bucky supposed that still left room for being a little snoop.
That wasn’t true. Tony had his letters to prove it, but Stefen was acting as if it was and for the life of him Tony couldn’t figure out why.
Tony winced. James had been slipping behind his siblings in languages, but Tony had not been exactly giving his pupils his full attention, lately had he?
“I brought some of your supplies.” When Stefen’s eyes narrowed on him with confusion Tony licked suddenly dry lips and babbled on in a rush. “Just some sketchbooks and some of the pencils and things, I confess I’m no artist myself so I wasn’t sure what you’d need, but I’ve noticed the paintings, and when I saw you sketching the other day I realized they were yours, and Pepper thought it was a good idea and helped me get what would be useful. Because I just thought you might like – ”
“Whatever you do.” Bucky’s voice was soft and low under the snores of the others, a softly rumbled warning.
“Steve...” his voice sounded weak and pitiful even to his own ears. Stefen didn’t look back at him. He was yanking open the bedroom door and striding from the room before Tony could stop him. Tony followed, his heart pounding, his feet moving too slowly as if they were laden with lead weights. Stefen must have had legs a mile long because the distance between them widened at an alarming speed. Perhaps it was intentional on Stefen's part, because by the time Tony was falling against the door of the captain's room and wrenching it back open Stefen was already halfway down the hall, facing off with Hammer and the two policemen he'd obviously led up the stairs. Pepper and Harold were behind them, looking as if they'd rushed from their bed only moments before. Pepper's uncombed hair hung wild around her shoulders, bangs framing her wide frightened eyes as they met Tony's. A warning flashed through them as her eyes darted franticly up and down his form and Tony flinched, ducking back inside of the room.
“German?” Bucky asked, eyebrows rising and she nodded.  Bucky grunted, stifling the urge to say something rude. Nele was a nice girl. It was probably a good thing she’d ended up married to someone decent, instead of shackled to the likes of him, though he wasn’t much sold on the decency of Germans.
“It’s not just the children either,” Pepper replied with a small smile stepping over Maria who was helping Natacha sort through what looked like a mountain of delicate bright satin sashes. “He’s sent something for all of us.”
He could still go home, back to the monastery that was. Father Niklas would... do what exactly? Agree to hide him for another week or so until he too was thrown in prison with the rest of the Jews in- it didn’t bare thinking.
The officer examined both booklets quickly, noting the official stamp from Herr Lehmann giving Péter permission to be out after hours with a huff and a dark glare of suspicion as he took in Anamarie's documentation, noticeably absent of a similar stamp. His hard eyes raked her up and down, mouth curling judgmentally at the waves in her dark hair which she wore down with pride, against the German style.
