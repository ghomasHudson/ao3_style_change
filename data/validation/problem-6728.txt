play them for fools. They're older and they're pop, but they're intelligent and talented men. If you do this," he stood and walked around the desk, "then I have a nice cushy office waiting for you as a partner."
"Have at it. I'll check for stragglers. Iron Man, aerial attack, Thor, use your lightning to electrocute him. Bruce, stand by, we may not need the big guy."
Thor was waiting outside when they pulled back up at the tower. Tony's face split into a grin -- it had been a while since he had seen the Asgardian.
At least I don't think I am. So can we stop with the nasty attitudes?" His body went slack, his anger diffusing into concession. "I don't know what I did," he pleaded, looking back and forth between them both, "but whatever it is must be pretty bad to have even someone I considered family angry with me." Pausing, Howard swallowed, visibly upset, "I just wanted to see Steve again. I'll work on getting home and be out of your hair. I'm… I'm just happy he's okay."
"This one time, in Cairo," Howard was standing on the cushions, "I challenged a Sheikh to a wine drinking contest."
"Spare a dollar?" The man held his hand out, his palm covered by greyed fingerless gloves. "I haven't eaten in three days," he pleaded, "just a dollar. That's nothing to you."
"I don't know," Tony sighed, looking away out over the landing pad and past the buildings. Down toward Fifth Avenue where a mansion used to sit, "I wish I did. You don't deserve to know any of this."
"I'll get them," Nat offered, standing up, though she loathed having to re-shoulder her burdens. "You get Howard. Better to hear it from us. I know JARVIS can just tell them to come out but…"
He'd let them believe what they wanted, but if they honestly thought he was going back without remembering, they were wrong. Howard never feared for his future prior to this. Not even a little bit. He greeted each day as a brand new set of hours to accomplish what he pleased. Worrying about what might happen was only asking for trouble. That was for Catholics and men in the fox hole.
Clint shrugged. "Dunno, maybe he's too much of a pussy to hope." He got a loaded look for that. "I'm just saying! If he's convinced Steve is straight, he's not going to entertain the idea that it's him. Why break ya own heart, you know?"
to get you in the Top 40 again," she held her hands up placatingly at the start of their protests. "Just this album. If it doesn't work, then I swear you guys can go right back to what you were doing."
"Besides," Steve said, his hands running down Tony's back to grip his bottom, "perfect implies normal and that's infuriatingly boring." In one movement, he hoisted Tony up, happy to hear that he actually did squeak when unexpectedly manhandled, just like he had imagined in his fanfiction. "And we're not normal." He cheeked, "Our relationship catalyst was me writing about us having sex for our fans."
She was scared. And she didn't want to hide it. She didn't want to soothe and comfort herself, she needed her friends. Needed to not lose
"Right." Steve turned and started walking, not sparing Tony another glance. It had been awkward between the two; Steve avoided Tony whenever there was a chance they'd be alone together, hurrying off, claiming some unfinished business or a prior obligation. Each excuse getting worse than the last. This had to end.
"-Drop it, Barton." The waiter was approaching the table, so Tony lowered his voice and leaned forward, "Steve looks at me like a brother, he will
"Maybe Clint will teach me how you shoot an arrow. Or! That cool, silent, creepy sneaking thing Nat knows how to do so well!" As the elevator doors closed, Howard turned to Steve, a sly smile on his face. "Hey! You think Tony will let me fly the suit?"
He could hear Tony and Rhodey talking quietly, his incredible hearing picking up on words here and there through the clanging of the cabinets and the rattling of china against china. He wasn't trying to eavesdrop, he just couldn't help it.
Tony laughed quietly to himself. Bruce tried, he really did, to go tit for tat with Tony, but really, who could win against the king of banter?
Then there were the migraines, his nails brittle and breaking, the pure exhaustion, the weight loss, his stomach so distended that he would have sworn he was going to burst, and the brain fog. That was the worst. He would sit in his workshop, hell bent on getting something done, and his mind would just… leave. He couldn't focus; he kept forgetting. Things a genius like himself should never have to deal with.
A burst of heat enveloped Steve as he stepped out of the shower, compliments of the heaters Tony had installed in everyone's bathroom. That wonderful man really did think of everything. The ridiculously fluffy towel he wrapped around his waist was just another luxury courtesy of Tony, and he entered his bedroom to dress only to find Natasha sitting on his bed, flipping through his sketchbook.
Steve came first this time, once again filling Tony. He groaned into the smaller man's neck, breathing in the scent of eucalyptus and sex, his hand picking up the pace on Tony's cock.
Tony's left leg buckled, Steve had found one of his weak spots. "Oh, fucking hell!" Steve pulled back to fumble with the buttons on his waist cost, popping a few off in his hast, ignoring the whine his stopping drew from the Don.
Tony swallowed. "My father. He…he was awful to me. He drank a lot." Tony's eyes flickered down to the glass in Howard's hands then back up to his face. Howard flushed and set the cup down.
Some times - and she'd never admit it to anyone - she put on her favorite sparkly dress, did her hair and makeup, threw on a pair of stilettos, and rode the train with them. Sitting with the girls and talking, laughing, and bonding with a group of drunk people she'd never see again. There really was no one more supportive than inebriated women after a good night out.
Steve not entirely straight? He might believe that. No one had known Tony was bisexual, it wasn't like there was a particular tell to see if someone was gay. Hope bloomed in Tony's chest, but he squashed it. Even if Steve was some form of
He shot up quickly, his heart beating fast before the events of the day before crashed back into focus.
He nodded, his smile tight. "Right, right. No one in Tony's life likes me. Not at first anyway." He leaned back, letting his hand rest on the counter top. "I'm trying to do right by him, you know."
were only some of the words he had used to describe him. Before he had met the man, back when Captain America was still just a legend who died heroically, Rhodey had looked up to him, had wanted to
"I know of her, she did work with a few singers I've worked with, don't know much, why?" She paused and laughed, "is she the new manager? How long before you chase this one away?"
There was brief silence like the quiet between a lightning strike and its answering thunder, before Steve's dam burst, his fears and apprehensions too heavy to continue to carry. The weight of them dipped into his voice, forcing a hoarse, desperate tone, overwhelmed by too much rain. Too much water. Too much pain. It hurt to hear.
Tony grinned wickedly, stalking past him and sliding the napkins to the center of the table, "Serves you right!"
Steve was chuckling, "Can't wait to see this end up on TMZ!" He was syncing his legs with Tony's, making wide strides out to the side, but Tony's shorter legs were falling behind.
Rhodey swooped below him, pulling up and making a circle around Tony as the Iron Man armor leveled out. "ETA Three minutes!"
hate him. Probably more than you do, because he's still a part of me. As much as I don't want to admit that. He's all the bad within me."
"Not for special cases. I would have gone over everything with you here, but seeing as-" she holds her arms out, implying Tony and his
"As am I," Thor admitted with a grin. "But what is the fun of getting it right all the time? Imperfection is the fun of life. Learning is the icing, like this," he chuckled, swiping some icing on his finger and licking it off. "It makes things so much sweeter."
"Surprisingly, yes. Nice to not be dying for once," his attempt at a joke was a little dark, but she laughed. "Beginning to think I might be immortal."
"And don't you forget it." It would have been sassier, but a yawn halfway through just made him look more adorable than a partially asleep Tony Stark should be, and that was saying something.
"Not gonna happen, Cap. I'll see you down there." And he was gone, legs moving quickly into the living room and to the landing pad. Steve watched him go before entering his apartment. "Damn it!" Tony was in no shape to be fighting, but the stubborn brat wasn't going to listen to reason. If there was a threat, Tony would meet it head on, regardless of his mental state. His ridiculous courage,
"Right," Hill motioned to the couch, "Mr. Stark," she looked at Tony, then to Steve. "Captain. Uh-" she faltered, squinting at Howard, "Mr. Stark… as well? Sit. You're going to need to."
Howard spent approximately one half hour sitting on the bed in the guest room contemplating exactly what had just happened in the hallway. Steve had basically threatened him - and sure, he deserved it - but if he was going to win Tony over and fix this, he needed Steve as an ally. Hell, he'd come to the future to see the soldier to begin with, regardless of the sharp left-hand turn this little trip had taken. Shifting on the bed, he used the momentum to tuck a knee under his body, leaning slightly to the left against one of the absurdly fluffy pillows. His priorities had certainly switched in life before, but never this…quickly?
He turned the vibrator on, readying himself, and pressing it against his opening, bringing himself back into the present. Steve carrying him. Fuck, that was a whole fantasy.
"What can I say?" Howard grinned, hefting the tray and heading back to the table, "My kid's got great taste. Just look at his boyfriend."
It's hard to get a reading on Coulson, and that's quite frustrating for Tony. Centuries of having to hide who he is have made him nearly impenetrable. It's honestly a little bit admirable; Tony has worked hard for his entire adult life to lessen his tells and keep people from ever fully understanding him. It's protection. If people didn't know the real him, then they couldn't hurt him. It's just another thing that Coulson will teach him, whether the older angel knows it or not.
"Were you sick at any other point during the week?" Avery asked, and when Tony shook his head in the negative, he continued, "and what about after the bagels?"
Tony's entire body jerked and jolted, and he froze as his climax hit, screaming out in ecstasy, his hips pumping up and down as he humped his orgasm into the coat, his come smearing and staining the pristine white fabric. His hands flung out, scratching at the carpet under him, nails raking through the threads as jet after jet of come spurted from his cock. His ass tightened around Steve, and it was almost too much. Steve's fingers tightened around Tony's waist, digging deep enough to leave bruises. He rutted against Tony's round ass, all control gone as he chased his own orgasm, so ready to fill Tony up like one of his prescription pads.
He sat on the edge of the bed, drying his hair using a second towel with vigorous rubs across his scalp before running the towels over his chest and glancing up at Natasha with a quirked eyebrow.
Bruce leaned forward, steepling his fingers, "Anything is possible, but that doesn't mean it's going to be easy."
"I'm not that man yet." He pushed off the bed, stumbling to his feet, the aches in his body becoming shockingly pronounced as he allowed himself to be made aware of them. "
Conceding, Rhodey fixed his tea and beckoned Tony back to the couch. "Sit back down, we promise we won't do it again."
sassy. I love it." Clint grinned, reaching across the counter for a napkin. "Just try insulting him, go on! Try it!" He subtly bumped Tony's shoulder, a silent promise to diffuse the tension as necessary.
Stupid and silly? Maybe. But the next chapter has some serious bits in it, so yuck it up while you can! And PLEASE LOVE ME AND LEAVE A COMMENT?!
"Take me to bed, Steve." Tony breathed. Aware of his own cheesiness and for once not caring. All he wanted was to connect with Steve intimately.
Steve blinks, looking owlishly at Tony. It's such a cute look on him; Tony is almost unable to do anything else but stare. But the tears remain in his eyes, and Tony knows he's got a small window until Steve throws in the towel completely, and Tony wants more than anything right now to cheer him up.
The next morning brought a slight headache (wine hangover, ugh!), and Natasha fucking Romanoff sitting at the foot of his bed, playing on her phone.
Steve, exasperated but wholly amused, just shot Howard a look that clearly said it was never going to happen. "You're gonna be trouble, aren't you?"
. He wasn't even omitting. They had just assumed he said all he knew. And maybe he was silently encouraging them to continue to believe that. Especially now that he knew Tony was his son and exactly what he did to him. It was imperative he have all the time he could get to repair that relationship. Just in case.
"Which is fine - and frankly good to hear - but you still need to take a seat." Bruce motioned to the empty chair again. "We still need to talk about your reaction and how you can fix this."
"I'm okay," he mumbled, "I might be better than okay, you know, if everything goes how I hope it will tonight."
Looking proud, Steve slid the tray of pork chops onto the stovetop. He turned and grabbed Tony's face with the oven mitts still on, "Exactly!" And nipped his nose before letting go and swinging back around to the stove.
It's not that Tony stops listening. On the contrary, he's extremely interested, but he's had a long day. Dying takes a lot out of you, and Coulson's voice is as steady and soothing as a metronome. His eyes slip closed, and as Coulson describes the feeling of having wings for the first time, Tony falls asleep.
"That's great, except for the whole part about being one of hundreds if not thousands that have seen that."
"Two robots. But, no," he breathed, his excitement palpable, "not robots! Men! This century is incredible!"
"Let Hill know what we're planning and get the coordinates. We'll leave in an hour, at zero-nine-hundred." He pulled his fingers from Tony, wiping them on his back and reached to the table next to them, opening a drawer and plucking a shiny blue vibrator from it. "Have the quinjet ready." It slid a little too easily into Tony and when he turned it on, the low buzz filled the room, Tony wasn't the only one who moaned. Thor let out a low grumble; his body rocked slightly.
Tony heaved another sigh and rubbed a hand down his face. "I was abused. You were right." Steve froze, unwilling to upset the moment by moving, breathing too loudly, or -- frankly -- doing anything. This was a big admission for Tony. "He abused me. I
Rolling his eyes, Bruce shrugged. He walked down the aisle and tossed in a box of organic fruit snacks and a box of high end crackers. "And your total for seven items is $564."
They were led to a yellow, Victorian style couch in a corner, a white marbled coffee table placed directly in front of it. The GM smiled at them, holding out two menus. "Liz will be your waitress, she'll be around in a few. I recommend the Cream Sodas, particularly the orange creamsicle, or for espresso drinks, my personal favorite is the Autumn or the Solstice. Enjoy!" With a grin and wink obviously aimed at Tony, she turned and left.
"That sounds like wonderful news?" Perplexed, Howard tried to move closer again, but Tony stepped back until he was standing in the doorway, the frame casting a shadow across half of his face. "Tony?"
But that was never going to happen. So, he'd have to settle for being friends with him. And Steve wasn't the type of friend to just look past seeing someone come hard while screaming his name. (Too bad, really, Tony was well aware of how hot he was like that.)
"Tony, oh my god, Tony!" The self-control was back as Steve pushed Tony's head away, "Wait, shit! Not yet!" It was harder this time. But he had a goal, and he meant to keep it.
, but honestly, who was going to tell Tony Stark he couldn't use a bunch of chemicals he found under his kitchen sink to make a bomb. No one got hurt and the black scorch marks in the middle of the meadow were the only clues as to who was there.
He doesn't fight it as he's lifted carefully into strong arms. Steve carries him with a gentleness born of a deep love and Tony wonders why he's never seen it before.
On the other side, Clint wasn't even trying to make conversation. He was hungrily watching the vibrator as it moved, his hand flying quickly along his length, his other hand gripping the back of Steve's chair.
"You really do got a smart mouth." A little bit of Brooklyn slipped through and Tony was surprised at the way it tingled through him.
Steve didn't want to stop kissing him, but there was a promise for so much more; his hands left Tony's hair and chin, and he popped the bottle of lube open again. He concentrated on coating his cock first, slicking it before wiping the excess across Tony's hole. Breaking the kiss, Steve took himself in hand and carefully, slowly guided the tip of his length just past the tight rim.
"Where the fuck have I been?" Tony muttered. The coffee was finally fucking done, and he poured himself a cup, keeping it Americano, and chugging half of it. "Oh yeah, that's a good burn!" He took another gulp as he picked up the salt from the spice rack.
Steve's hand shot down to clamp around the base of his length in an attempt to stave off his orgasm. In all the years he’d wanted Tony, he never once thought that him
"That would be the general consensus, yes." Clint said, sitting up, "Look, do you take requests? You take them on the page, right? But I don't have time to comment, so face to face works better."
The museum was nice, considering Tony had no interest in anything in there other than the soldier next to him. Although, Steve talking about art, about drawing and painting, and the use of technique...now that Tony could watch everyday.
"I mean, it doesn't have to be the zoo, you're not a kid but I figured you'd maybe want to do something you never got to and-"
"Nope." Clint set down the mug and brandished a spoon from his pocket. "But we sure did know how to dial a phone number."
"Incredible, isn't he?" Steve added, if a bit smugly. Tony could tell he was making an extreme effort to not lose his temper once again, though it wasn't hard with the reminder on Howard's cheek. He just wished Steve would back down. "Tony created him.
Pepper groaned and tugged Tony down onto the couch, taking a moment to cup his face with one hand, forcing him to look her in the eyes. "Are you okay?"
Tony slipped an arm around Steve's waist and leaned up on his toes to kiss his cheek. "And I appreciate it. Lord knows I was too scared to make a move. Although, I still need to have an actual eye exam. This prescription is no longer good."
Howard looked apprehensive, but he pushed away from the doors, gesturing for Thor to lead the way. Tilting his head knowingly, Thor started through the kitchen, only turning back to assure himself that Howard was following. The man was fearful, that much was clear. He walked a good distance away and kept Thor in his sights for the entirety.
," she said instead, recognizing how uncomfortable he was. She would get nowhere with him if he closed up. In that, Tony was a carbon copy of Howard. At least she had experience.
Howard saw a dark spark, a small flash of brightness as Tony's eyes briefly lifted before falling again, right back to the same spot below him. "What's not fair?" He asked, his own voice taking on a slightly defensive tone.
"Good, because you guys will probably have to save us again at some point." And Tony laughed loudly at that, the woman looked happy that she managed to get him smiling something real. "Just don't forget: Rich, famous, smart, superhero? Doesn't matter. It's your damn body." She looked at Steve, "Make sure he gets that through his big head!"
to," she answered easily, mocking his words from before. The sass of the comment was covered by Clint making farting sounds, and she threw a disgusted look at him.
"Don't thank me yet. Here," Coulson hands Tony the pass and itinerary. "Plane leaves tomorrow at 8 am. We're flying to DC."
Sweat had gathered along Tony's back, and he slipped down the couch, laying flat on his back. His knees were bent and up, the muscles aching with the positioning, but he didn't care.
Holding up his hand to stop further conversation, Clint interrupted. "I'm making a plate for Bruce to bring to him. And going to lick my wounds. Be right back. Don't miss me too much."
With that, Steve bent his knees, dropping to the floor and leaning back enough to lift Tony's hips up against him, driving back into his stretched and wonderfully abused hole from behind, the rim deliciously creamy with his precome and the lube. Tony propped himself up on his elbows, his forehead resting on his arms, cock swinging between his legs. His knees dug into the rough carpet.
how much fun this is going to be." Diving down, he silenced Tony's laugh at his pun with a deep kiss, licking into his mouth and using one hand to tug at his hair while the other cupped Tony's chin, moving his head to exactly where Steve wanted it to be.
Rhodey spoke quietly, his voice barely concealing the inner fight waging in his mind, "You think this Howard will try to make up for what his future self did?"
"All day they've been trying." Tony started. "All day. Telling me I'm worthy. That I'm good enough. And you just...So completely." His point needed to be made clearly, so he dropped his head back onto the pillow, looking Steve in his eyes. Those blue, blue eyes, like the sky after a storm, when the sun pushes its way past the clouds. "You make me feel safe. Secure. Like what's in my past, for once, doesn't matter."
Those conversations had usually started at the end of a bottle. With Tony drinking so much to try and suppress the memories that after all that, after getting shit-faced, they had been all he could think about. The unkind words from his father were just the beginning. When the subject did get breached, it was only bits and pieces to a much larger puzzle that Rhodey had to build over the years.
He was Tony's anchor, but Tony was his ship. He guided Steve, had shown him a world after the ice, had given him a reason to continue on despite his own traumas and his own reasons to forfeit and give in. Tony helped him find a safe harbor, and he had pointed Steve in the direction of a lighthouse as it glowed with a blue that existed nowhere but in Tony's chest. A light to guide him home.
Tony winced, looking at Steve a little guiltily. "It was needed, as I said, but I didn't mean to upset him."
She sighed, knowing she wasn't getting much else done at that moment. "Yes," she relinquished, "I took the liberty of starting you guys in New Mexico, and you end in New York at the Jones Beach Theater. March 15th through September 12th, fifty-six dates, with some double shows."
"Please," Clint sassed, as they stopped to pick out some carrots. "A whole new world has opened up to me. I am the Soup King!"
"Good, because this next part tends to make or break most with their choice. If you die, the only guaranteed safe passage back to Heaven is if you die on holy ground. Anywhere else, and you're susceptible to attack."
Steve smirked, inching the stool a little closer. "Keep going." The anticipation was growing, and so was his erection. This close, he could smell Tony: his aftershave, the musk of his work, motor oil, and something earthy. It was invigorating.
"Come on." Taking a few steps, Bruce turned and motioned for Steve to follow, "I'll lead the way." He held the door open as Steve entered and turned on the overhead light in the kitchen so he could see where he was walking. "Don't be mad at Tony." He said quietly, pulling back the covers so Steve could lay Tony down.
It's only just over a week later when Coulson descends the steps into Tony's workshop, holding a visitor's pass and a flight itinerary. "You're coming with me to SHIELD to meet Natasha and Clint and to hopefully get a job consulting so you can be near them as well."
Shaking his head, Tony softly bopped Steve on his arm. "No, I hurt you. I was wrong. You have no fault in that. I had convinced myself you were better off without me."
Tony takes a deep breath; he knows he needs to steer the conversation away from such a horrendously sad topic. "Who else are you watching over?"
The glass of the window was cold under his hand, the heat from his body creating a foggy outline. "Where-" he couldn't finish his question. It was all a bit overwhelming. Maybe he really didn't think this through enough.
Finally gaining purchase on the curtains, Tony swings his arm forward, sending the divider sailing between them. It hurts, pain shooting up his hand and into his forearm, but he needs to get away from Steve, and since he's stuck on the bed, his best option is not seeing him. He'll take what he can get.
Because standing directly in front of him, at quarter past 11 in the morning and hours earlier than expected, was Steve.
"I do. And this distraction wouldn't happen to come in a package that's about 5'8, brown hair, big brown puppy dog eyes, and a penchant for being as annoying as possible?" Her grin was devilish and somehow fond. Nat snorted, and Clint grinned. "He's like a fungus. Grows on you."
When it came to missions, to team things, Steve could tell Tony no. He had no trouble putting his foot down when it involved dangerous situations. But at home, where they were just two people deeply in love, he could never deny Tony anything. It was his weakness.
"I'll see you two kiddies later." Another peck of their lips and Tony was gone, jogging out the door and to the elevator.
He - all at once - realized exactly why Tony picked at his thumbs, how he felt during his panic attacks, and why Steve seemed to be one of the only people capable of calming him down. Because at the moment, all he wanted was Tony.
He had accepted it when Tony was becoming friends with him. It made sense if they were going to work together, but a romantic relationship? That hit hard. And Rhodey was
Steve had to shake his head and take a sip of his tea to push the thoughts from his mind. He had writing to do. The scene on the subway was rolling about in his brain. It was all any of the fans could talk about. No one was happy that Tony apparently thought so little of himself; it was shock to the system. Steve knew, and so did the rest of the team. He was sure Pepper, Rhodey, and probably Happy knew as well. Tony could hide his insecurities from the public all he wanted, but to those who saw him almost everyday? It had become painfully obvious.
Rhodey smiled kindly, his brown eyes soft and full of all the love he had for Tony. "Whatever you need it to, Tones."
"Then what was that?" He gestured to Steve's lap, "Not that I don't like sitting on you, just prefer it when we're naked." He was deflecting again, and Steve let him.
Bruce let out a hollow laugh, "He's dealing, if that's what you mean. But he's a mess. You know he hides it well."
It was a picture of Steve, framed against a crumbled Manhattan, with Tony in his suit in the background. The Chitauri Invasion. Steve's shield was in mid-air, flying back to him and Tony had his arms out, repulsers charging. The sign underneath was typed out in bold letters.
They're bundled up, but even under their winter parkas and the hemmed slacks, he can see that they are frail, withered with age and experience. There is still strength there - hidden under wrinkles - and it reveals itself with their linked arms and careful stride.
"I can't speak for the others, but I know what it's like to be judged for someone you no longer are, or in your case, have yet to become."
"I know," Tony took a deep breath, sobering, "I know. It's just...I can't make the thoughts go away." Somehow, it was the most revealing thing Tony had ever said. But Steve understood.
"I should hope not!" Steve laughed, a tint of self-recrimination audible around the edges, "What did you find out?"
Tony tensed but said nothing. Steve was right, after all. "You can come down to the workshop. Not right now, because I'm going to talk to Pep, but maybe tomorrow?"
Most of their time was spent in the common rooms, a kitchen and a living room that catered to housing six superheroes. Tony was the only one with an actual apartment, but then again, it was
Nodding, Steve let Tony lead him down the hallway and into Steve's apartment, leaving Rhodey alone in the living room. All he was aware of was the way the curls at the back of Tony's neck swirled up from being mussed by the helmet. The way his cologne gently wafted back to Steve, smelling expensive and subtle. Mixed with an underlying scent of metal and oil and coffee, with an undercurrent of baby powder from after his shower, the one thing from Howard that Tony learned that was good. He noticed the dip in Tony's waist, how it popped out to form his round and perfectly shaped behind. How Tony's gait was sure and steady, a bit cocky but somehow still sheltered behind a calm confidence that Steve had at one time taken for arrogance.
It had taken too long to get back to New York, and she worried about the effect this was having on Tony and how her absence may have made it worse.
Howard had been so proud to learn of Tony's accomplishments. He spoke with wonder over his genius. It had felt so good to get that recognition he had craved for years growing up under the abusive version of that man. It was something that had followed Tony to adulthood, that need for approval. The thought of losing what little acceptance he had attained was frightening, but if he wasn't the one to inform Howard of their relationship, the chances of keeping that dropped significantly.
Still, Bruce decided as he crossed the street, he'd buy some flowers. Some he'd place in a vase in the apartment; a little burst of color to cheer him up. The rest he'd give to the Hulk.
It wasn't healthy, and Steve knew he should really get Tony up and doing something productive, but he couldn't bring himself to force it. Instead, he bent down to kiss his forehead and smiled sadly. "I'll bring up some food in a little bit. Rest, angel."
"Do I look like someone who read the menu? I knew what I wanted as soon as we walked in. Get the schweinshaxe, bratwurst is common." With that said, he plucked the menu from Tony's hands and set it on top of his. "I think Steve is having a harder time deciding."
"Thank you," Tony's hand flew up into the air, signaling that what Bruce said was all that needed to be laid out. "A
"The Other Guy is agitated," he tried, dropping the humor and going for logic, "and he knows something is up with Tony."
She grinned widely, too many years under her belt with him to not notice his flushed face or the breed of confidence in which he walked. "Do you two do anything other than have copious amounts of sex? Or is it just me?" She looked at Natasha.
Howard stood - and Steve pretended not to notice the wide girth he made to avoid moving too close to him - and sat next to Tony. "This is the camera!"
"More than a camera." Tony quietly laughed, turning the device on. "This is a Starkpad, a handheld computer."
"You can tap this ass later, my little chicken nugget, don't you fret!" Tony called over his shoulder as he opened the door.
Steve put his arm around Tony's waist, and it fit so perfectly Tony almost welled up again. Almost. He had enough of tears to last a lifetime.
She turned to look at him, hunched in the hoodie and looking like death. "What's wrong?" It had been a few months since she had seen him in the flesh and not through a computer screen, having just returned from California after dealing with the West Coast end of Stark Industries. She had seen the headlines, but the media was so often wrong about all things Tony Stark that she wasn't concerned. Tony's pale features and gaunt face were a shock to her. For once, the magazines and newspapers weren't too far off the mark.
Coulson looks offended for half a moment, but it dissolves into confusion. "You would rather hear about a pickle I got into than about what you're going to be doing as an angel?"
Slipping his hands under Steve's shirt, Tony pushed it up. "I just said I wanted you. Get your hearing checked, old man!"
The man at the cart looked up, surprised, but smiled when he saw Natasha. "Anything for my beautiful friend here. Feeding the masses again, Miss Natasha?"
Bruce stood up, "Then he should be here, as well as Steve and Tony," his eyes moved to glance at Rhodey who nodded. "That's good news at least."
But was it right to mess with time more than he already had? Would that just complicate things and make it so much worse?
Steve crashed their lips together and pulled out, enjoying the shiver he felt run through Tony's body. When he pushed back in, it was like the whole world opened up. Like he all of a sudden had the answers to everything.
The evening peak commuter hours were winding down, not that there was as much on a Sunday, mostly retail workers, police officers, and medical personnel, and she had several hours before she'd be missed at the tower. Enough time to stretch her legs and wander Eighth Avenue for a bite to eat.
Trailing behind is a nurse in a light pink scrubs and clogs. She holds a beige canvas bag and, when prompted, plucks out a tissue to pass over to the old man. He smiles his thanks and gently wipes spittle from the corner of the woman's mouth, his movements gentle and loving.
is Howard Stark, who sent himself to the future and made Tony trust him and started building a relationship with him." He looked close to letting his fellow assassin go to town, Thor noted the edge he heard just underneath his voice. "Tony came out to him about him and Steve and he-- he--!" His anger too much, Barton gestured wildly, letting his frustration show the rest of the story.
He placed his hand on the table, guarding his plate and shoving a huge chunk of waffle into his mouth. "But, seriously, how blind can you be?" It was said around a mouthful of syrup and butter.
When he finished, he didn't feel any lighter. Getting the story out hadn't helped in the slightest. As his eyes focused on Howard, he felt his skin crawl. He needed someone to blame along with himself.
This time, Steve doesn't hang up. He waits for the beep, and is silent for a moment before speaking. "Tony? Tony, please, call me back! Just tell us you're okay! Please!"
He wasn't being fair. He knew that. Howard had no idea why he was so hated. Could Tony really punish him for something that hadn't transpired yet? He rubbed his forehead. It was barely seven in the evening and he was ready for bed. Ready to curl up with Steve and just sleep. To forget everything for a few hours.
To the Put on the Suit -- the Stony discord server -- for just being a whole slew of positivity and cheering.
"Right." It was no time to lose footing, so she hurried on. "Also, BLI said they'd consider letting you guys in for SummerJam
"You talk really loud when you're on the phone! I'm surprised all of Manhattan doesn't know he's on his way!"
So Steve did. He thrust, hard and fast into the compliant man below him, taking his pleasure as much as he was giving it. Tony's body rocked, his back arching, and his head twisting and turning in absolute bliss. He had never felt like this: So undone, so worshipped.
up here?" It was said with a huff of exasperation and a slap to the mattress. Tony chuckled and wiggled his way out from under the bed.
There was minimal tinkering in the workshop, he hadn't attended a single Stark Industries function or meeting, and as for flying? He didn't even count the assemble call. It was three blocks away, and he was knocked out of the air fairly quickly. As soon as Howard had landed in the living room, it was like Tony's entire life had hit the pause button.
"Of course! The Boss only cares about what's in your heart and you, evidently, have a good one. But I still need your name."
Tony watched him go, his face drawn and pensive. "I think there'll be complications no matter what we choose."
Howard awoke to the brightness of the day. It was awful. His head was clanging with the insistent stampede of a high school band, and his mouth was as dry as a cracker. He groaned and rolled over, flopping to his stomach with one hand hanging off the bed. Eyes barely open to the intruding sun of the bedroom.
you want bacon?" Hands on his hips, Steve cocked his head to the side, he did well enough to look the vision of an annoyed and harassed boyfriend, but Tony knew better.
He held his hand up to stop her. "We represent some of the biggest names in music and movies. So far you've dealt with
"Honeybear!" Tony's face lit up, and Rhodey had to force a smile. It was glaringly obvious that what Bruce had said was true. Tony was grasping at any light he could find. Not that Rhodey wouldn't put a smile on his face any other day, but there was something forced about this one. It was earnest, but also hopeful in a way that had his heart sinking. "What brings you here? You just missed breakfast - Bruce made pancakes and they were just perfection, as usual, of course. But especially delicious today. There's some leftovers in the fridge, I could heat them up for you. Do you want coffee? I'll make you coffee. Or would you rather tea?" He had been loading the dishwasher but paused to speak, a sticky looking plate flailing around as he gestured. "I don't know, you switch back and forth between the two depending on how much shit you got to do, and tea is great, don't get me wrong, but coffee is like the nectar of the gods. Do you want tea? You look like you want tea today. Bruce turned me onto Darjeeling, it's incredible, but I like it with half and half, I know you usually take yours with no cream-"
Michael looks pleased with Tony's understanding. "Your genius works well with this; you can process a lot faster than most."
"That's a high task, Mr. IQ of 270." Another glare and Steve just looked satisfied. He continued, his tone seriouser than before, "He isn't an idiot, we know that, so he figured from the frosty reception-"
"So what happened had already happened?" Tony sat forward, steepling his fingers. "The Howard I knew was already the split Howard, even though this one didn't come to us yet?"
But Steve did speak Tony fluently, after all. The return of the sarcasm meant the point had been comprehended. It meant that Tony understood. It wasn't a fix for his insecurities, but it was a start.
Tony scoffed, amused. "Is that even a question? He'll play fetch until his battery runs out. You didn't answer my question before."
Pulling the Ziploc bag from his coat pocket, Tony takes the parsnip but gives the beans to Steve. "I'll do the nose since I'm so
She grumbled, several words in Russian rolling off her tongue. With a hard kick to the railing that had Clint wincing, she sighed. It was true. He
"They're good at finding out things like this," Tony grumbled, "the truth? They couldn't find it if it bit them on the ass."
Another smack. "You're getting precome on my pants, slut. Knock it off." Steve glared at the body on his lap, but Tony couldn't control his movements. He let out a guttural groan, his fingers going to his own hair and grasping it.
Forcing his eyes away, Steve tried to temper down the longing that began to boil within him. Not just for missing Tony, but for wanting his own best friend. His biggest missing piece.
"Natasha mentioned something," his eyes flickered from Tony up to Steve, unsure. "I'm not exactly on board with it, but I'm not totally opposed either."
And nothing sounded better than the soft gasps and moans Tony made as he buried himself to his hilt and gave an experimental roll of his hips.
Steve swallowed, leaning against the door frame. There was a beauty in Tony that couldn't be quantified by his large, doe-like eyes or his jawline. It would never be defined by his smooth olive skin, or the solid body underneath his designer clothing. It was something that existed only inside Tony: a grace that was exhibited through his music. Personal lyrics and melodies that told stories, notes that climbed through the air like a gentle fog, enveloping and mysterious. When Tony sang, he was like an orchid blooming, rare and beautiful all at once.
Bruce laughed affectionately, "He's like a musically inclined ninja savant. Check the bench out back, I found him there this morning."
But, twenty minutes later, they were interrupted by hushed whispers coming from the kitchen. When they went to investigate, the other four Avengers were standing around the island staring dumbly at Steve and Tony in the doorway.
There is a pause, and Steve is amused to see Tony snickering, the sound is like wind chimes dangling in the sunlight. JARVIS speaks again, his voice smug. "Saint Jude's thanks you for your generous donation of your gaming devices, Agent Barton. The children will be so happy."
"And so are you," Steve whispered, tightening his hold on Tony's body and rocking softly. "You conquer everything thrown at you."
He's gifted a smile, something he's learning that Coulson doesn't give freely. "You'd never make it as a boy scout, Tony. Don't kid yourself." As he's jogging up the stairs, he calls out, "Also sorry to hear about your stocks. Don't be late!"
"And why not? We're sneaking around, almost getting caught. I can't touch you outside of our rooms, and it sucks, Steve! It really fucking sucks!"
"What's up, Agent Hill?" Fury asks, standing from behind his desk. He rounds it, coming to rest in front of her.
Steve continues, his voice soft. "I didn't know if I could ever love again. It didn't seem possible. But that's the thing, Tony," he leans in close. "The heart has an amazing capacity to love. And though I didn't think it possible, I fell in love again. With you. And somehow it's greater. Maybe because I know you better than Peggy - I never really got the chance to know her like I know you."
"You're going to make me burn the bacon. Haven't you had enough?" Steve chastised, as Tony's hands explored his chest. He stood behind Steve, the side of his face pressed into the warmth of his shoulder, his hands dancing along his skin, running over Steve's nipples and making the soldier's breath quicken.
Steve shook his head, "He's a science guy like you, I doubt he's dabbled in magic," he paused, "worth a shot in asking though."
Tony glanced up, it was the man who had been too far to help, but had tried anyway. So those three with the phones weren't the only ones who knew who he was. The rest of the New Yorkers and tourists just had more class.
A trip to the market meant getting dressed, and Bruce slugged on a pair of khakis and a polo. He didn't bother with the mess of curls on his head, only threw on his shoes and jacket, and grabbed his cellphone and wallet on the way out. He didn't leave the tower often, mostly he just ordered what he needed from JARVIS and had everything delivered. There was no room in the world for a man with a giant green problem.
When Rhodey was a dot in the sky, he turned away from the glass and announced to the room, "I'm going to see Bruce. And no, I don't need an escort." He looked pointedly at Steve.
The switch in demeanor was quick, meant to throw Steve off his guard. It worked enough that Steve answered, "About two years ago."
Still though, taking a life didn't sit right in Steve's chest, evil bastard or not. He needed to get out of there. Not only to remove himself from what he did, but because it was getting harder to ignore the urges of his lust.
The sweet momentum was driving them closer and closer, but not enough to send them over the edge. Steve pulled Tony up to sit on his lap, kissing him deeply as the position drove his cock deeper into Tony, swallowing the genius' gasp as he stilled him from moving by grabbing his hips.
Climbing onto the bed and plopping next to Steve, still naked but content, Tony handed him a plate stacked with sandwiches and tossed two bottles of water onto the bedding. They ate and drank their fill and pushed the plate to the floor along with the empty bottles, and Steve took him again.
Taking another bite of the sandwich, Tony picked up an apple slice with his other hand. "Your grandfather used to sprinkle salt on these," he gestured to the slice with the sandwich, "if you want to talk about nasty…"
"It says that you searched for love in between the sheets because you couldn't find it anywhere else. It says that you drink to drown out the voices inside your head that tell you you’re worthless and unworthy. We all have demons, Tony. We all have things we're not proud of, things we try to hide. But, most of us didn't have to do it in the public eye, as you did. As you do."
Steve grinned in appreciation, "that would look so nice buried in his ass." Barton let out a sound that had Steve almost stopping the game to let him fuck his boyfriend. He had to tear his eyes away from the cock, it was so tantalizing to watch Clint jerk himself to what he was doing to Tony. He looked over at Thor, still standing by the doorway, sweats still tented. "Are you waiting for a personal invite? Get over here."
"And it was a new pot that hadn't been used, so no chance for cross contamination," added Bruce. "Rice Chex are gluten free. So are all the vegetables and fruits he's been eating. Bagels, however, are not."
He can see the wheels turning in that brilliant mind. Tony's brows are furrowed, dissecting the puzzle set before him. "Yeah, burgers sound good."
Tony shook his head. His eyes, red rimmed and exhausted, still had tears falling from them. Steve wanted to reach out, draw him into his arms and kiss his tears away, just as he had done countless times before. His arms lifted, stretching toward Tony, but an explosion rocked outside, and Steve, falling back on instinct, braced Tony against the wall, protecting him. The aftershock of whatever exploded settled, and neither were worse for wear, nor did he see any damage to the hallway they were in. He hadn't really needed to protect Tony. It was just his first instinct.
"Search engine, it's that page - webpage? On the internet - that I showed you." Standing, Tony smiled brightly. "It's all there."
Shaking his head, Steve gave another set of pulses against Tony's sweet spot and answered, "Nope, been playing all night. But, trust me when I say: I'm fully relaxed."
like this. Maybe it was the fact that his mouth wasn't running. Or maybe it was because the stresses of his life smoothed out when he was sleeping. Whatever it was, when Tony slept, Bruce sometimes forgot that this was a middle-aged man with a whole lot of baggage. "He needs it," he said at last.
Hello! Sorry for the delay in posting, but the good news is that entire story is officially written! This was supposed to be the last chapter, but it was far too large, and I felt bad dumping an almost 20k chapter on you guys, so it's split up. Two 9k-ish chapters and an epilogue that's less than 2k.
He let his hand rest on the glass before knocking lightly, and Tony jumped, hands grabbing at a socket wrench as he reeled around on the stool, ready to defend himself. His body relaxed upon seeing Steve, and he let the wrench fall back to the workbench. His mouth moved, speaking words Steve couldn't hear to JARVIS, and the doors slid open.
"He needs what they call a celiac panel, bloodwork from the doctor." Clint answered. "Then we'll know for sure."
When Tony finally lets go of his life, it's with the reassurance that he's never actually been alone.
"It better be a big palm tree," she muttered, gazing down at the handsome faces of the five aging boy band members. "With coconuts. So then at least I'll be in good company."
"Pick a restaurant," handing the menus to Howard, Natasha stood again, angling toward the bar, "I think it's time for happy hour."
An hour later, Tony was asleep and Steve finally allowed himself to close his own eyes. His dreams were fitful, filled with shadows and of Tony, too far to reach, tumbling over the edge of something he couldn't see.
"I do not pretend to know what it is that goes on in the minds of my mortal friends. I am but a fallible being myself, if my own troubles can demonstrate anything. But I know their hearts as I know a brother's." He paused, allowing his words to reach Howard. "I do not believe Steve hates you, as you've said. But perhaps he fears you. Fears what you become and what you will do to his beloved. Tell me, Howard Stark, at this moment do you wish to harm your child?"
She had been there from the beginning. Sure, Rhodey had been too, but he was oftentimes unavailable. Pepper was Tony's daily support, and that meant something bigger. She was there when he returned from Afghanistan, there through the whole debacle with Stane, there through it all. She had seen Tony through his manic building frenzies and his inevitable collapse afterwards. Had seen him go through countless one night stands searching for
"That's a nice thought." Puffing his lips out, Howard blew air through them and sat forward. "Anyway, I am sorry for causing this mess and any issues it created between you and Tony."
JARVIS answered, his calm voice needed over the chaotic din of the alarm. "They are en route, Thor Odinson. Agent Barton has informed me they are fifteen minutes out in the borrowed quinjet from SHIELD."
emotions carried easier. There was room for a few of the negative ones. They tacked on at the bottom. So the second Howard isn't a Stepford Wife, but he'll be happier in general because the positive emotions all came with him." Fury fell silent, letting the implications run through each of their minds.
His guess - and he's sure he's right - is that the couple are well into their nineties, most likely born around the time he was. Hell, if they were from the city to begin with, he may have even known them. Stranger things have happened.
Tony knew that, and he bit back a snarky retort, knowing that it was just something Avery had to say. "Am I dying?" He tried to laugh, tried to smile, but it came out flat. It was a real worry.
Chuckling, Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair. "Never thought I'd actually get to see this. To have you do this."
Howard didn't seem to notice as he took the armchair, happily munching on his food and pointing out his favorite bits of the movie. As the film ended and they gathered up their plates, he said, "Since you're all planning to erase my memory anyway, mind if I poke around?"
Steve would have been concerned, he wasn't too sure how much tech they should allow him to see. Especially tech that held the name of his butler, a fact that would make Howard suspicious of their connections to him. It was something that could lead him to learning exactly who Tony was, and if Tony didn't want that… but Howard was already asleep.
The twitch of his own erection reminded Tony of why he was reading this in the first place. He felt breathless. Like Steve was actually kissing him, and he wrapped a hand around himself, groaning with the feeling.
Steve frowned and rubbed his face, "I can feel his ribs when I hold him." They all looked down at that. Tony was always so fit. "If something doesn't change, the next time he puts on the suit it's liable to snap him in half." Maybe it was an exaggeration, but the implication was clear.
"Yeah, well, you know what they say: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day," he answered lightly, pushing down the emotions that were threatening to surge up.
. But," she said, taking two steps backwards, "if he were to get some closure with Howard, he may not blame himself. He may not chase Steve away.
Tony moaned, "Yes!" The slap hurt in the best way, sending bolts of pleasure through his body. Steve wore Tony's MIT ring, the hard platinum slamming into the genius' skin.
Tony's fingers twitch. He wants to cover the blueprints, to shove Coulson away, to keep it secret for just a little longer. But he knows he can't. As much as this
Shrugging, Rhodey sipped at his own drink. "How did I know you were abused or how did I know that you didn't know it?"
The moonlight fluttered through the curtains and Steve took a moment to just gaze at Tony. With his eyes closed and his body so curled up on Steve's chest, he looked absolutely innocent. Steve, of course, knew better.
"That's an impressive suit you got there, Colonel," but Howard kept smiling, sticking out his hand to shake Rhodey's. He pointedly ignored the friendly gesture.
he began to recite, drawing a smile from Steve. He hadn’t meant to say it aloud but was pleased to hear Tony recite his favorite poem by heart.
Seeing Howard the night before had jarred Steve's memories. Yes, this Howard was a bit older, but in many ways he looked the same. He seemed to act the same too. Still reckless, still impulsive… It set off a wave of nostalgia inside of Steve that he thought he had conquered.
Tony couldn't help it. He smiled. How had he gone from a misanthropic man with media tendencies, to someone whose friends and teammates knew him better than anyone? His list used to be only Rhodey and Pepper and to some extent Happy. These days, Bruce, Natasha, Clint, and even Thor when he was on earth could see through almost all of his masks. And Steve? Steve didn't just know him biblically, he had been allowed in further than even Rhodey.
A few friends mentioned wanting Tony to hook up with Clint in the interim. As tantalizing as that may be, it probably won't happen unless like every comment I get here on out demands it. Instead, I'll work on a one-shot dealing with them as rambunctious butt-buddies. Maybe I'll throw in a sarcastic Natasha to tease them when she figures out they're fucking.
She grinned. "If the rest of the world figures out about your sweet tooth, you're screwed. You know that, right?"
Natasha deflated, "We know. But what you need to understand is that we have the chance to help him, even fix it!"
Tony played the piano, and he played beautifully. Enough so that Steve would take his sketchbook out and let the music guide his hands. They'd spend hours just like that. No need for conversation. It was cozy. Natural.
They would know, of course, because they always did. But if he could pretend he was okay, maybe he'd start to actually feel like it.
"Tough. There's a cafe on Long Island that's supposed to serve pretty amazing coffee in an out there atmosphere. I've wanted to go, but only with you. You're the coffee connoisseur."
It was a testament to both their bond to each other and their commitment to their fans. Natasha knew that there were worse acts out there to manage. But they were still considered poison to work for. She
In the bedroom, Natasha had laid out a pair of jeans and a plain black t-shirt. She had also been through his underwear drawer--of fucking course--and had set out a pair of briefs and a pair of socks. Emerging from the closet, she tossed a grey zip-up hoodie onto the pile. It was one of Steve's, worn, and comfortable.
"What movie?" Clint asked, picking up the two hot dogs with no sauerkraut on them. A small piece had edged onto one of the buns, and he flicked it off.
Making a face, she grumbled, "No." Turning, she eyed him, taking in the dark blue sweater. "That's Steve's."
Tony jumped up, ripping the toys from his body before he could come, he stumbled, almost falling back to the bed, before letting out a string of curses.
"How did you get here?" Bruce asks, holding Tony at arms length to look him over, just to make sure.
was the point if one wasn’t relevant? That's what brings the money in, that's what sells the records, that's what-
"Not yet. He has to actually agree to date me first." Tony replied, picking up the empty cellphone box and opening and closing it, just to have something to do with his hands.
"I want to explore every inch of you, Tony. I've wanted you, loved you! for so long." He paused, stilling his fingers. "I need you to know, unequivocally, how much I love you."
"No. You can't loop through time, at least not with this spell." Frowning, Fury looked at Tony when he spoke next. "Instead it creates two of the same person, splitting them. One continues on track, and the other gets to travel. The problem occurs when you examine the split."
Natasha turned to her, sizing up her intentions before answering. "We don't know, he goes to the doctor tomorrow."
"Can you come?" Steve asked, pressing both fingers hard against that spot within Tony, his mouth slightly open as he witnessed just how beautiful Tony looked with his body moving like that. "Can you come from that? Just that?"
"No," Tony laughed hollowly, "but it's better if I go alone." Tony turned to go, ready to face Howard, but Steve's fingers gently circled his wrist.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, picturing Steve's face between his legs and came. Shouting his name and arching as his come spurt, never stopping the movement of the toy inside him.
"It's amazing, Tony hardly sings on it at all," Clint joked, making Tony throw his head back in laughter.
"Too late now," he said, moving forward to the sliding doors. Howard looked over at him as he passed. "Is that him? Is that the robot?"
Thor, he was positive wasn't in any way involved, but he told him he liked wake-boarding. Not even a real kink, but the Asgardian used his tablet to read, so a Google search history would prove he wasn't involved.
He took her hand. "That's me!" One of the three leads back in the day before they started dividing up the solos equally, he had a strong melodic voice, though he had struggled with vocal problems a few years prior: mental stress from an illness and losing his brother tragically. Single. No kids.
"Because I need you to understand, Tony." He senses Steve's hand before he feels it, sliding under his cheek and turning his face so Tony has no choice but to look at him. "I lost her. And it nearly destroyed me."
Tony stood close to Steve in his shadow in an attempt to make himself disappear (or to send a warning to anyone dumb enough to try something that he was with Steve, and didn't that put a hop in his step!).
Tony suffered panic attacks often enough that Steve knew exactly how to help him. He knew how to ground him, how to bring him back from the traumas of his past. He could anchor Tony like no one else had ever been able.
Wrapping his arms back around Tony, he pulled him backward to the door. "You only like me for my beans."
The more Tony thought about it, the more he knew that he had to be the one to tell Howard. It was the only way to exert any control over the situation. If Howard was to find out - and it was only a matter of time - it was infinitely better if he was told rather than figure it out on his own.
and skittered into the guest room as the elevator dinged. After the morning he had, he wanted nothing more to do with anyone in the tower, at least not until he processed the bomb that Tony -
"Tony," Rhodey began, pulling Tony's menu from his grasp and setting it aside, "He loves you. You love him. The both of you are meant for each other, and letting the crap that's going on with your dad right now interfere with that is just stupid as hell."
he meant it. Forcing Tony to talk about what had just happened wasn't going to help him. It was too much, too soon. Tony had come a long way from his lonely days prior to the Chitauri attack, but he was still healing. Decades of abuse at the hands of people he should have been able to trust had dimmed his ability to speak freely about his emotions. They had been thrown back into his face all too often.
"Lies and slander." Turning quick, he took advantage of Rhodey's distraction and swept his legs up, depositing them in his best friend's lap and leaning heavily against Steve. Rhodey side-glanced him but made no move to shove him off.
It's surreal. He could have wheeled him over then lifted Tony from chair to cushion, but instead, he stops Clint at the doorway where the archer was pushing him and scoops Tony up into his arms. He's warm and steady. Careful with Tony's broken body.
A Facebook message popped up in his notifications on his cellphone,startling him, and Steve would have been annoyed with the interruption had it not been from Cara, one of the other writers on the site he had grown close to (and no, she had no idea who he was.). It had become inevitable that he would strike up friendships with the others who wrote stories about him and the team, particularly writers who were just as into Stony as he was.
"Sounds less complicated to me." Tony chuckles, gesturing to the table. "Look at these delinquents!"
It flashes into Tony's mind immediately: The horrible, twisted demon-like creature, the screams of the civilians, and the old man who never stood a chance that Steve tried to save anyway. "You did everything you could."
Tony had to hide his face in his hands; he was laughing hard enough to offend Clint, and since the archer had just saved dinner with his fantastic ability to divert, he knew he really shouldn't egg JARVIS on. Then again, Tony never did well with keeping his mouth shut. "J, have I told you lately that I love you?"
laughing," Tony said honestly. He motioned to Howard, pushing off the table, "I'll let you two do the talky thing. I had mine." He stepped up to Steve and slid a hand around his waist, pulling him close and tilting his head up to kiss him. "I'll meet you back upstairs?"
Everything in Tony froze up at that moment. He could feel his brain screaming at him. Be logical! Don't freak out!
!" He heard one of his underlines yell out, but Tony wasn't bothered. A drunk was of no concern to him. He sat up and dabbed at the white fabric.
"They came out to Howard." Rhodey stopped short, his heart dropping. Bruce, unaware at first that Rhodey had ceased his steps, kept going. He froze several feet from Rhodey, realizing, and turned. "Col. Rhodes?"
Laughing, the slight against Hill and Clint at least bringing the mood up a little, Nat left the kitchen and headed into the living room and the couch in the corner. She sat, crossing her legs and letting the weight she was carrying fall off as she sank into the cushions, her back melting into the softness. Thor and Bruce both entered, looking curious and taking the loveseat across from the bookcase. Clint stretched out next to Nat, and Hill took the armchair, her face creased with worry.
"Barton, you better not be in the vents!" He called out, standing and rolling his desk chair over to the opposite wall to stand on it. But when he peered inside the high up air duct, nothing was there. "Huh."
. The way Tony's eyes had fallen to his glass of whiskey (and what right did he have boozing it up at nine in the morning
Tony was introduced and brought on stage at 3pm exactly. Off to the side, standing together, were his teammates and friends; they gave him encouraging smiles as he adjusted his tie and fiddled with the microphone clipped to the lapel of his suit jacket.
Around his cock, Tony moaned, eyes rolling back at the very idea. Slowly, Steve pulled out of Tony's mouth almost the whole way, letting the head rest on the tip of Tony's tongue. Behind his large glasses, Tony's eyes were wide. Drool dripped from his mouth, and his lips closed over the head, trying to suck him back in with a needy whimper. Steve couldn't say no -- how could he? Cupping Tony's cheek, he pushed back into his mouth, watching with unveiled arousal as Tony's lips stretched out again.
It was Clint's turn to snort. "Like the aftermath of an F5." Nat turned to him and frowned judgingly. "What?" he defended, "I'm from Iowa!"
"Tony…" Voice like a whisper, like a prayer, Steve breathed heavily, "Tony, god, Tony." His head bent down to kiss up Tony's neck, sucking lightly at the skin. Tony tilted his head, his own breath coming out in puffs and small, aroused whines.
"Most likely. But who's counting?" Sitting, Tony picked up the filled glass that was slid over to him. "But really. I, uh, I know I was difficult. You know. With not wanting to go to the doctor. I'm sorry for that."
to love him. Steve admired him. He admired him and he loved him with every single fiber of his being.
"Okay, angel." Steve pressed his lips to Tony's forehead, and Tony closed his eyes, savoring the moment. The tight coil that had been the entirety of his insides was unraveling with each passing moment. He had Steve back, and although his father couldn't go back to his time, it didn't damn Tony to vanishing. They had a solution to give Howard a decent life in the future, and although Tony was sad for the loss of Howard's past life, he was excited to finally have the ability to curate an actual relationship with the man that could be positive and loving.
"Howard," Clint started, still genuinely liking the guy despite hating what he would eventually do to Tony; he had to warn him, and that just irked him even more, "Howard, that's Tony's best friend. Colonel James Rhodes."
"I'll go. I have -- uh -- I have some… Some paperwork." He stood up, fully intending to slink off to his apartment to lick his wounds when Tony raised his hand to stop him.
He's sitting on a bench in Central Park, the bare trees swaying above him in a waltz that only the winter winds could choreograph. The limbs are stripped of their leaves and are a deep, dusty brown. Where the earth shows between half-melted mounds of snow is a dull yellowed grass and sticky mud that sinks heels and stains the bottoms of pants. But in the sky, peeking through the naked canopy, the sun is bright. Steve squints through its glare. With his hands deep in his pockets, he watches an older couple stroll by, arm in arm, the man leaning on a cane and the woman dragging an oxygen tank. The sound of the wheels towing over the concrete is hushed scraping and rattling. It's strangely soothing.
"It's rare," Coulson informs him. He's looking down at his hands, and Tony can sense how this topic of conversation is affecting him. "But you know when they die."
There was nothing he could do until they found a way to get him back (not that he was being very helpful), no way to plan and plot until he was back in 1961. Howard wouldn't exactly say he was dragging his feet by offering no further details as to how he got to the future, and it wasn't like he was outwardly
Tony barked a laugh, "Celine Dion, and if you tell anyone I know that song, I'll piss in your Wheaties."
. The cabinet above also had the same sign, further inspection showed that in it were the things he needed to stay away from: wheat bread, regular cookies, regular breadcrumbs, regular pasta, all storable items that contained gluten. Directly next to that counter was the sink, a barrier between what was cleaned and what wasn't.
"The most interesting part of getting sick and figuring it out isn't that I have an answer, it's why I hadn't thought of it before. It's why I'm donating 3.5 million dollars to the NCA and will continue to do so yearly. Because now I know what I should have before." Pausing, Tony let the murmurs through the crowd soften before he continued.
Steve's hand wrapped around him, jerking his dick, pulling guttural moans and heavy breaths as his fingers dug into the skin of the taller man's back. Drawing him in, marking him as belonging to Tony. Marks that Steve would look at in the mirror in the days to come and grow instantly hard from.
He should have known, but sixteen years was a long time, and Howard had forgotten just how stubborn Steve could be. "I told you, Steve, I needed to know. And I found a way. Don't you see? It worked!"
"Tony! Tony, wait, let me explain." Standing, Steve quickly wiped himself with his discarded shirt. He tossed it to the side and held his hands up, trying to calm Tony, to placate him.
Tony learns about what being an angel entails, gets a new job, meets two familiar faces, and finds out something disconcerting about a certain Captain.
Tony didn't question it. He gingerly picked up the toast and took a bite, but his face turned sour, and he swallowed dryly before taking a large gulp from the bottle of water Steve had also brought up with him. "Nothing tastes right." He pushed away the tray. "Maybe later."
"I let my anxiety and stress and- and, well frankly… my daddy issues get in the way. I should have never broken up with you. I've made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life-" He barked out an embarrassed laugh, "-especially for being a genius. Stupid, stupid mistakes. But the worst… the worst was letting you go."
Tony had screamed Steve's name the day before. When Natasha had tricked him into going to the workshop. Fuck, he
"They buy the albums, they play the songs on Spotify, they sell out the tours…  Radio doesn't give a damn about five middle aged guys who are still in a boy band."
Got a speckle of the serious in here, sorry. I mean it IS crack taken seriously, right? And we want Steve and Tony to have like a solid foundation for their relationship, right? Look, I'm sorry, I can't seem to write straight humor. It's not my fault. It's Tony's. Just blame him, the precious little fuckhead.
"I don't need to hear that, man." Dropping his head into his hands, Rhodey laughed. "Price I pay for being your friend," he smacked Tony's shoulder, "I know way too much about your sex life."
Tony gave a tired chuckle, lounging back in the chair, "Yeah, that would be counterproductive." His stomach grumbled loudly, and Steve barked a laugh, bending down to kiss him, resting his hand on Tony's toned stomach.
The sounds of the party vanish in an instant. The silence hurts. It's too sudden, too confusing. He rolls his head to the side, and there's Steve. He tries to smile, but he's too tired, too worn out from living, an exhaustion that has smothered him since childhood. When he falls unconscious this time, he welcomes the darkness.
She rolled her eyes. "It's from Tony," she spoke, not looking at him and swiping her phone open. "He's an idiot."
Smiling softly into Tony's hair, Steve slipped his arms around him, "I know, I started the fire, and if you start singing that song, I'm getting out of this bed and taking the blankets with me."
But it was honestly nice, just for a little while, to feel a part of something more mundane and just as wonderful. To feel camaraderie with girls her age. Women with no ulterior motives than just wanting to make someone else feel good and smile. Attention from gorgeous men with or without a trust fund, vying for her number, asking her to meet at the Leaky Sailboat in Seaford the next weekend or Mulcahy's in Wantagh because
Natasha studiously ignored the loaded look Clint was giving her. "They're very close. And I'm not going to lie, Tony has suffered from it. But, Howard, you know this is your chance, right?"
"That was Bruce. He wanted to know if we would like to go to lunch with him later. Or a late brunch. Anything to get out of this godforsaken tower. His words, not mine."
Rhodey took the tray from Bruce's hands. "Just call me the Tony Whisperer." As he walked out toward the hallway, he called back over his shoulder, "I'll do my best to get Tony back on solid ground, you keep Steve from falling apart."
"That's because I love you!" Swinging an arm around his shoulders, she squeezed, purposely putting pressure on the arm she had punched twice.
"I didn't know," Tony says again. "If I'd have known…" he shrugs and holds his hands out, palms up, in apology.
"Ugh, they're annoying. I had high hopes Howard could keep up," she shook her head, "and he called Tony the disappointment."
"And?" Tony asked, pulling back a bit too look up at Steve. "If Bruce can't figure it out? If we can't find the book or there's nothing in there to get him back?"
This time, he didn't get sick. He even felt well enough that afternoon to put some time in on one of his projects.
His legs, stretched up the back of the couch with the knees bent over the top, kicked up and down comically, "Very!"
"Tony," Bruce's voice is cracking, "Tony, your flight went down. No one survived. Jesus, we thought- we thought you were dead!" Steve steps back to let Bruce in, and the scientist throws his arms around him. He can hear Nat on the phone.
And quite suddenly it was dark. The lights inside the living room hushed out, and Tony had to adjust his eyes to the ambient light of the city, light that framed Steve in a halo. His breath caught.
"That had to have gone over well," Clint was giggling into his glass. Evidently, a completely wasted Barton was more open to the idea of Howard.
"Something like that. Hey!" He pointed right into Tony's face, who swatted at the hand and leaned back, "Hey, don't do-stop that! I'm trying to talk here!"
"Huh," Tony felt a smile ahead across his face, "finally made it to the workshop, I see. Is he making a mess?"
Tony blinked, drawn out from his fantasy. In answer, Tony filled the machine, turned it on, and pointed to the percolating coffee, "I got nourishment right here. Zoom Zoom Juice."
Tony's face split into a grin and Rhodey was about to count it as a win when the smile slid off his face and he turned away. "I showered and I ate. Isn't that enough?" He pulled on the rest of his clothes and fiddled with the zipper to the hoodie.
Natasha tried, she really did, not to let her disappointment show on her face. "Look, guys, you're better than 90% of the music currently in the 40. You have more talent in your-
Tony laughed as he shut the door behind him, but as soon as he cleared the doorway, his face fell. His little suite with its living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom was like a bubble. In there at least, he could be protected from the annoying and upsetting fact that his father was currently sleeping off a hangover in the guest room. But outside of it…
Leaning down, Steve took Tony's lips with his own, slowly backing them up to the bedroom. "Now let's get this suit off you before we get it all dirty and you have to change."
"If you told me," Steve giggles, wiping at his eyes, though this at least for a better reason, "when we first met, that you had looked up to me as a child, I would have called you a dirty rotten liar."
His back arched off the bed, and his legs started to shake; Tony was close to undone. The slow build of pressure swirling through his abdomen and curving up his almost purple leaking erection, bright yellow and white sparks shooting through his body with every pass over his prostate. "Steve," he moaned, like the name was all he had the ability to say, ushering in every emotion, every want and desire into that one little syllable. "Steve…"
Clint opened the fridge, but instead of grabbing the butter, he leaned back to whisper to Howard in a horrible Russian accent, "We must not insult Mother Russia."
"Whatever, I didn't want pancakes anyway," she huffed, crossing her arms, but the tapping of her foot gave her away.
"To be continued." Swinging his feet over the edge of the bed, Steve kissed Tony quickly and stood, hurrying to the bathroom.
Steve shrugged. "Your guess is as good as mine. But too much. He's weak, he's fatigued. We're changing his diet, trying to see if that helps."
Steve let his lips trail down Tony's jaw, nipping at his chin before pulling back and smiling down at him. "What do you want, angel?"
Finally having Tony back in his arms made it difficult, but Steve managed to keep the shower brief. They washed quickly, even considering how Steve took the loofah from Tony's hands to wash his thighs and butt, proclaiming that he
"Biggest regret of my whole damn life." He swallowed and went back to the safe, pulling out three more crisp one hundred dollar bills. "Do what I couldn't." And handed them to Steve.
"Says you," Steve chuckled, kissing him again. "Call me right away when you leave the doctors, I may not answer, but I’ll call back when I can."
"If he knows what's good for him, he will." There was a shout behind them, and a boozehound toppled into Tony's chair, his tea cup spilling over and landing on Tony's spats.
If only parents knew the impact their words had on their children, how a phrase or a fist could shape them long after they were in a hole in the ground.
"Fuck." And he dropped back down against the mattress. Magic and spells. Time travel and Steve. Drinking with that beautiful and dangerous woman and the man that called him Asshole. Steve yelling at him. The man Tony barely looking at him but then… putting him to bed?
Steve didn't care. He ripped Tony's shirt from the waistband to his--he was sure equally expensive--trousers and pulled down his suspenders. "Too many layers!" He complained. Tony laughed and took over, expertly unbuttoning his bottoms and shirt and letting everything fall to a pile on the floor. He stood in front of Steve, in nothing but a peach colored pair of boxers, something Steve had heard of, but didn't know of any men who wore them.
"Yeah, and he's still a mystery to me sometimes," Steve responded, his voice frustrated. "Look, chances are he's not okay. But if we act like he's not, he's just going to close up shop and we'll never get anywhere. Treat him as normal, just - I don't know - watch what you say."
"No, I knew he was going to be trouble." He let the television play through the rest of the footage from the battle, raising his eyebrows as Thor sent the lightning into the dragon.
It always worked on Asgard and almost anywhere else he used it. But this was Howard Stark. And Howard Stark had no idea who he was.
Howard moved over to the bar, sucking in deep breaths to calm himself. Screaming was getting them nowhere, "Mind if I have a drink?" He didn't wait for an answer, just walked behind the counter and grabbed a glass. Picking up a bottle and studying it, he said, "When were you, uh, thawed? Was it?"
And Clint? Well, he really did try. He was half on the back of the couch, trying to get into his usual spot, but one leg was still on the floor. Slowly, without moving the rest of his body, he lifted his leg, staring off somewhere decidedly not Tony or Steve and hoping beyond hope that his movements were careful enough to not bring their gaze. As usual, he was about as subtle as a sledgehammer.
Bruce looked completely grossed out, paused over the table where he set the eggs down, "I don't need to know
But Tony didn't smile back. He looked confused, a bit scared, and his deep brown eyes were wide with both emotions.
and not even selfless intentions of helping. He had done all of this for a selfish desire to see his friend again.
"Then you know about wizard space—same concept, but only good for wings. And it's not roomy. Which," he says, holding up his index fingers, "leads me to my next point. If you keep them away for too long, it'll hurt like the dickens to get them back out. So don't do that. It's like keeping your arm folded against you for several days; trying to straighten it out is painful."
"And after all you've survived and accomplished, you still don't think you deserve any of it! Tony, for fuck's sake, all your family's money did was ensure you wouldn't have debt when you graduated. Everything else, you created yourself!"
Natasha calmly closed the text in front of her and stood, walking around the table and clearing the chair across from them of their papers and notes. "Agent Hill, have a seat."
Tony did look up at those words, his head snapping straight, shock and anger smeared across his handsome features. "They had no
But not America. Which left her without any more questions at the moment, but also with two very inebriated men.
"Do you see now? How perfect you are like this? Look at what you're doing to them, my pretty little slut."
Fury was still watching the doorway through which Howard had disappeared. "Now we create a life for him here. The public already figured out who he is." At Tony's stunned look, Fury held up a hand. "It's crazy. I know it. You know it. Hell, the hot dog vendor down the block from here fucking knows it, but I say we go with that. If they didn't know, I might say differently. But let's work with the shit we already have. Introducing him as anything else will cause the public to call our bluff. With all the technology out there -- most of which you created, so you know what it's capable of -- there's no way we can keep this secret. And it will make the transition easier on everyone."
Instead of responding, Steve just kissed Tony's head and stood, unsure of how to answer that. "Dinner will be ready in about an hour, give or take."
He turned, dropping Tony to the chair with a grunt and laying on top of him. Tony's legs spread, letting Steve fit in between them, and he lifted his hips, grinding upwards. It was delicious friction, and they moaned, each lost in the haze of their cocks rutting together.
"Thor tries. He just usually gets it wrong. E for effort, and all that." Taking a long drink from his glass, he appraised it. "Needs more Tabasco." She handed him the bottle on the table. "Thanks. But I think the one in denial is Steve. He knows Tony is bisexual, and he knows Tony is getting off on these stories. What's keeping him from throwing him down and fucking him until the cows come home?"
Tony used Steve's arms as leverage, anchoring himself through their clasped hands, and pushing up and down, his body rocking, and his legs trembling. "Steve," he let his head roll forwards, "fuck, Steve." His breath was coming quicker, the muscles in his abdomen flexing and releasing with each slide of his body.
The half-Sicilian's eyes fluttered closed and his hands ran up Steve's back and into his hair, the kiss he gave him seemed to pour his own emotions out. Steve could read them out loud and clear.
"Vaguely." Steve answered, stepping forwards to examine the photo used to advertise the exhibit. "I don't remember this, that whole day is kind of a blur."
"Sir," he started, but on the screen his question was answered as Howard freaking Stark tackled the bad guy.
Steve kept his voice soft when he spoke next, not wanting to startle Tony. "Why don't you guys go to the living room; I'll put the kettle on."
Steve allowed his lips to tug up just a little. "Are these those 'pesky feelings' Tony always complains about?"
Bruce was in his lab, like he expected him to be, but he wasn't working on anything. Not that Tony could tell anyway, but he was splayed out in his desk chair, swiveling back and forth, his head thrown back, looking bored.
Steve shook his head, "I don't know. Hey," he pulled back, keeping his hands on Tony's shoulders, "why don't you take a bath, relax, maybe do some reading? You don't have to talk to him if you don't want to."
"That was a low blow," he squeezed out between clenched teeth. "Deserved. But low." Bruce squeezed his shoulder in sympathy before casting a nervous glance in Howard's direction and retreating from the room. Clint didn't blame him. Regardless of the steps Howard had taken to prove himself, the Hulk still didn't understand. All he knew was that this guy had hurt
Steve’s arms encircled his waist from behind and Tony leaned his head back onto his shoulder, closing his eyes, letting Steve's warmth and strong arms envelope him. "The kitchen in the penthouse is getting a similar makeover, Bruce and Thor are up there right now, only it will be 100% gluten free." He placed a chaste kiss on Tony's jaw.
"Oh God, please, please!" Tony was trembling with need, so the next time Steve pulled out, he thrust back in faster, a little harder. Picking up speed with each stroke.
Over-stimulation, he told Natasha, fully expecting the next story to encompass that. The whole team knew of Steve seeing Tony orgasm at this point (Oh, she so did that on purpose, the brat! If the whole team knew, he couldn't prove anything!), so a story about joining him wouldn't prove a thing. But forcing him to come a second time without a break? Natasha
Tony's elbow jolted out in surprise, sending his water glass shattering to the floor. "Steve is not in love with me, Tashy."
Tony was hard. Already. And nothing had even happened yet. He felt the same anticipation as his counterpart in the story. Ready and willing for Steve to use his pretty tongue inside him.
"What the hell does that have to do with anything?" Steve bit out vehemently, "So we both have had to calm Tony down after a nightmare about his piece of garbage father, if anything that proves my point!"
Natasha was a spy, she prided herself on noticing things about people. Maybe she didn't know all the details, but she knew Howard was an awful father. She could easily pinpoint the neglect, and there was evidence of physical abuse, but without hearing from Tony himself, she could never know the full extent.
As usual, many thanks Wilmakins and LadyLanera for the cheering, and all the praise for MugiwaraLexi for the beta!
"And you are stubborn, friend Banner!" Bruce barely had a second to prepare before he was pulled up into a tight hug. "It is good to see you!"
"I'm not trying to help in the way you think you need." Coulson smiles tightly. "You hide behind your public persona to protect yourself. To protect who you really are, which is a nerd who loves robots and learning. You are a geek over cars, and you deny, it but you love science fiction and fantasy. You love music, all types. You play the piano, have a lovely singing voice, and speak more languages than most people ever even hear.
"I promise." Placing his hand at the small of Tony's back, he guided him toward the bathroom. "Let's get cleaned up, talk, and then figure something out for dinner. Afterwards, I promise I'll be the best pillow you've ever slept on."
"Is that so?" Steve's hands instinctively went to the sides of Tony's thighs, his fingers curving around his bottom.
Tony moved out of his reach, his shoulder dipping away from Steve's hand as he turned to his standing tool box and plucked a set of wire cutters from it. He pointed at Dum-E, "What's this mess?" He gestured to a few tools on the floor, "Right here? Clean that up."
The realization hit him hard, and now that he knew, he felt so incredibly stupid for not figuring it out sooner. It was never Natasha. It was
Two days later had Tony literally laying on top of Steve's naked form, happy and content, except for the grumbling in his stomach.
"I was angry at first, upset and all over the place," he began, popping a Kiss into his mouth, "but then Howard started showing pride in me, especially after I told him who I was. And it just, I don't know, Pepper, it felt good."
"Oh, fuck shit. That hurts." His voice was pinched. "Oh no, oh no no no!" Steve could only follow as Tony ran to the bathroom and dropped to his knees. So much for feeling better.
He was so beautiful. It took Steve’s breath away whenever he thought about it, whenever he contemplated his luck to have this amazing, gorgeous, and brilliant man to call his own.
She laughed, the sound crisp in the air. "Sure. It's not going to help you figure it out. He'll be forty-four at the end of May." With that, she left the kitchen in a sprint, and the only evidence of what she was doing was the unmanly squawk of Clint, followed by a whole lot of cursing.
It was. Without Howard tackling the lunatic, he would have shot Tony with the crossbow point blank and instead of joking with a civilian paramedic, Tony wound be laid out on the street. Dead. Steve looked down, shifting his shield from one arm to the other. He had been so messed up in his own head that he couldn't even act. Howard had saved Tony's life.
If Tony were to admit anything, it would be to Rhodey. His person. His rock. The man he went to for all things good and bad. The man who showed him how to let others in -- like Steve. Without his guidance and support and unwavering love, Tony would never have felt the confidence to take that step with Steve. Nor would he have let Pepper in, or the other Avengers. Like his own Blue Fairy, it was Rhodey who all those years ago helped to turn him into a real boy.
Still, they had a strong fanbase, selling out venues around the world and pulling in money, despite the lack of radio play. Fury had said they were a good group to work for. Well behaved (these days), stable (these days), and kind (apparently that never changed). She knew what the files said, hell, she'd seen most of it live on television: addictions, arrests, bar fights...plus that whole debacle with Obie Stane, the mogul who created the group.
"It's going to get cold." Steve pointed to the plates, but his eyes took on an impish gleam in the clear blue.
"Maybe not," Howard continued, "but I had an inkling. I knew there was no sure way back. I just-" He faltered, lifting one shoulder helplessly and looking down, "I kept thinking it would all work out because it always did. No matter what I've done, I've always managed to salvage it. I always landed on my feet. I wasn't prepared to
The honesty. It was hard to comprehend. That he could open up so wholly to one person. That for the first time in his life, he didn't feel the anxiety of having someone know what went on in his head.
Jarvis, his butler, his friend. The man who had warned him more than once to be careful where he stepped, dead and gone but immortalized in an artificial intelligence. Tony had a knack for bringing the past back to life. Howard lifted his head and found Tony's eyes locked on his. They would find a way.
During breakfast, Howard starts to put some pieces together. Tony is still a piping hot mess. But who can blame him?
Above him, the quinjet with Natasha and Clint hovered, and through his com, Clint cackled, "He looks like my eighth grade science teacher. Probably smells like him too."
was a boy's hero. He was a role model. He was something to look up to. Safety. Love. Protection. People in those days didn't interfere with how others reared their children. It wasn't lost on Tony that had he been a child now, he most likely would have ended up in the system.
Much thanks to Musicalla and Lady Lanera for catching my typos and mistakes, WilmaKins for being the best Alpha Reader and sounding board in the world, and BleakLoft for the encouragement and love, and for the surprise that's in store for the readers of this story!
"Sure you want me to stop?" he teased, tucking his palm flat under Tony's hand and on his stomach. He inched up under his t-shirt. In answer, Tony just smirked and scooted his legs further apart, no longer bothered by the tickling.
to be back in September. Besides," she offered up, "it's more important that you give the younger crowd something to talk about that
"But do you? I mean, I went through all this trouble. I wanted to see you again," Howard's eyes weren't nearly as captivating as Tony's, but their pleading wasn't lost on Steve. He softened.
In the kitchen an hour later, he stood with the refrigerator door open for far longer than his usual frugal mindset would allow. It was a battle within him. Something nutritious that he knew Tony sorely needed versed something Tony might actually eat. His hand hovered over a bag of spring greens to make a salad before grabbing a carton of strawberries and a container of Greek yogurt. A smoothie. It was healthy, and Tony would absolutely drink it.
"He's in the living room. I gave him a book and a bottle of scotch and told him to keep his nose clean." Tony snorted at that, and Steve was hard pressed to smother his own grin. "I also called the others and filled them in. They're on their way. Nat should be here within the hour. They'll keep him busy. I think I have someone more important to be with, don't you think?" He moved his hand to cup Tony's face and kissed him lightly.
"Because of some giant green thing?" Leaving the doorway, Howard moved right into his space. "You don't seem dangerous."
Steve heard Tony moving around in the bedroom not twenty-five minutes after he started to cook, and when the sleepy, warm arms slipped around his waist from behind and he felt Tony's face pushed into his shoulder, he smiled. "Hey there, sleepy head." He had gathered his thoughts as best he could, knowing Tony like he did and knowing he'd be unable to wait the full hour.
"We shall!" Tony laughed, hooking his arm through Steve's and they left the cafe, taking long, ridiculous strides and laughing like two twelve-years-old boys. There was a camera flash just outside, and Tony laughed harder, just imagining what the headline would be. "Never mind us," he said in the direction of the flash, "just two imbeciles, out for a stroll!"
Laughing, Tony started towards the direction of one of the exits, "Gee whiz, what a fucking surprise!"
is in that tower right now?" he said, jabbing his finger toward the door, "At this moment?" He turned back towards the door and froze, his eyes landing on the vague outline of Howard, still at the window. "Is that him?"
Tony grinned, "Oh, so now you're violent? But when Natasha cheated at Mario Kart and I threw the controller you said," he dipped his voice and spoke in his best -- worst -- Steve impersonation. "’Tony, violence is never the answer!’"
"This is Na-Na," he says in lieu of answering the unspoken question. He holds the blankie up. "I can't sleep without it."
"Tones," Steve deflated, swirling his beer around in his glass and looking defeated. "I'm not saying you need to be saved. And I don't mean to speak for you, but
"You should get scoped to see how bad the damage is; it's also used to confirm diagnosis. But I've had some patients refuse, though I don't reccomemnd not getting it. Changing your diet helps to fix what happened, but we can only be sure if we can see first hand." Pausing, Avery checked the chart again, "My other concern is that you are very anemic, but that's about on par. Your hemoglobin is at a 9.8, which is very low, but about right for how long your CD was undiagnosed for. On top of your diet, I'm prescribing some iron supplements. I'd like to see you back in two months to check the levels again, if they're still low it might be another underlying problem, but other than a B12/folate and Vit D deficiency, which again is common, your regular bloodwork looks fine. All these numbers should be up by the time I see you next."
Within five minutes of introductions, Natasha has fiddled with her gun, cleaned her nails with her knife, and
"Your job is simple," Tony added, "all you need to do is concentrate on promo, making sure it fits what the fans want, and help set up our tour and appearances. You hire the video directors,
"At the risk of sounding like an echo, I agree with Thor. You are worthy, sir. And if he can't see that, then he is not worthy of you."
Howard, so obsessed with finding Captain Rogers that he forcefully used his own child's intelligence to try to accomplish that.
"Nice double entendre. On-wards, faithful steed!" Tony called out, earning a snort from Happy as he pulled into the traffic.
Tony shifted on the couch, tucking himself under Steve's arm further and blatantly using Steve's chest as his own personal pillow. On the television, Tom Hanks’s son fretted about getting into Stanford, while Jack Black vomited. It was one of Tony's favorites,
The weather was turning, but it was still somewhat bright for the mid-afternoon. A light rain came from the clouds and washed the streets, sending the dirt from the prior dry days cascading down into the sewers. He could see the sidewalks fill as the elementary school up the block let out and children and parents began their walk home. He never had that. He had boarding schools and the occasional phone call from his mother. Propriety and rules instead of a parent waiting diligently by the doors to see her child. Decorum and manners, starched uniforms with crisp white shirts and ties. Blazers and pressed pants instead of recess and playgrounds and trading lunches.
Tony was laughing, which was what Steve had intended to happen. "Steven! You're the only space heater I want!"
"Come on, Cap, or all the good snow will be gone!" Feeling bold, Tony steps up beside Steve and links arms with him. "Let's see what an artist and an engineer can create!"
"Well, yeah," she said, her lips curving into a quick and small grin at the sounds Tony was making. "But he's creating panic, and that's a problem." Her face returned to its normal passive visage.
Tony patted his shoulder, "I know." He scraped the rest of the cake from his plate and stood. "I'm gonna go to workshop for a few, clear my mind for a bit. Jarvis will let me know when Steve gets home." He sent Thor a cheeky grin, "You can go text the others now that I got my head outta my ass." He placed the dishes in the sink.
"What about Steve? He still prefers pad and pencil. Oh, yeah," his voice took on his signature sarcasm, "He's also straight."
The muted sounds of the television drifted down the hallway, peppered with sparks of Howard's laughter and Clint’s light snoring. Steve moved slowly, not at all interested in facing Howard again. He had thought he was at peace with the man. Had thought his reconciliation between the Howard he knew and the Howard that hurt Tony was complete. But the sounds of his voice: his exclamations over the new technology, coming clearer with each step Steve took; the drunken chuckles he could discern between the flips of the channels… They ripped the scars back open. He had
"And you're a super genius! So what's your point?" He stepped back, taking Tony's hands, and smiling. "You're so much smarter than I could ever hope to be. Do you think I'm too dumb to be with you?"
- to finally get the restful sleep his body is deprived of, but the solid form of Steve under him is everything he's longed for. He cannot possibly be allowed to have both.
has been keeping me informed?" With that, she left, calling out to Tony to follow her down to the business floors. Clint was left to force his memories back down his throat, back into the locked box he kept them in. Pepper Potts knew what she was doing. There was no way he'd let Tony feel even a modicum of what he had with Loki.
