Tony looked up. “Oh, no. Sorry, I’ve got a lot on Pete, I’ll have to catch up with you later on if that’s alright?”
Tony trailed behind him once again and only then noticed that the blonde had picked up his keys from somewhere, sticking them in the ignition. Steve was about to start up the engine when Tony stopped him.
All of a sudden there were resounding gunshots echoing around the woods, hitting their target, some bouncing off tree trunks, some splitting the leaves. The Foniassaurus gave out a thunderous roar, dropping Matt’s lifeless body onto the sloppy ground, before she took giant steps straight towards the soldiers.
Steve gave another eye roll, which seemed to happen a lot around the other man. “Shut up, Tony. Let’s go.”
Steve didn’t want to look behind him as he got up from the floor faster than lighting. The dinosaur was still behind those walls, but he had a funny feeling not even those were going to hold after seeing the thing up close. The researcher sprinted across the path as fast as he could, an idea springing to mind as he got closer to three of the ground’s SUVs parked in a line. As soon as he came to rest beside one of the vehicles, a resounding explosion erupted from the walls of the Foniassaurus’s home, rubble and dust flying into the air.
“What do you think I’m doing?” Peter yelled, ducking under a thick branch that almost whacked him in the face.
Tony wasn’t listening, his mind was tuned into one thing, and that was getting the hell out there to find his nephew. As soon as he’d heard Peter’s cries for help over the phone, he knew he had to do something. Peter and Wade had no idea what was happening, they were out there, God knows how, on their own, with the most dangerous dinosaur in the park on their tail. He couldn’t stand around and wait for the Foniassaurus to kill again.
“Bruce, that’s a good and very believable idea.” Tony said with a snap of his fingers. “You heard him Thor, tell them to let the guests know there’s an electrical fault with one of the rides and it’s causing interruptions with the rest of the park, and make up some big lie about Main Street being the only safe place to stay whilst we fix it up.”
Tony sighed softly, running a shaky hand through his tousled hair. “I know.” He admitted. “It’s always been that way I… I don’t know anything else, I’ve been working since I was eleven… it’s just the way I was raised.”
Steve shook his head in disbelief as Luke came to stand beside him, accompanied by Tony. “This is insane, I thought this glass was made to stand an explosion?”
“So, Danny?” Tony began, as the curly haired blonde turned and greeted him with a big grin. “Not driving this thing today?” he asked nervously.
“Where are we supposed to go?!” Wade yelped as they were shook back and forth again. “There’s nowhere to run!”
Luke finished up with the industrialist as Tony stepped in front of the glass, giving it a small knock. “What do you think?” Luke asked, looking out through the glass.
“Tony,” Steve sighed, hating the way Tony seemed so nervous and miserable. “You weren’t a terrible boyfriend!”
“Okay, honey.” She smiled, patting them both on the arm. “Now don’t forget to tell Tony to ring me when you’re there.”
He was soon snapped out of his trance as a woman knocked right into him, sending him tumbling to the floor hard, scratching his hands on the hard rubble and hitting his head quite painfully on the ground. Loki whimpered at the sharp pain he felt, wiping his fingers over his forehead and realising he had a slight gash there. He slowly got up, pushing himself onto his knees with his grazed hands, and practically crawling to the bin he’d kicked earlier.
“Have you seen these cool goggle thingies?” Wade shrieked in excitement from the other side of the room, next to a stack of shelves covered in old devices Peter was pretty sure he shouldn’t be touching. He then noticed Wade was wearing one on his head. “Everything’s green!”
“Come on!” Wade grinned excitedly, grabbing a hold of Peter’s hand and yanking him off the ground. “Let’s go!”
“Steve?” Tony kneeled next to the younger man, who was stroking a hand gently along the Brachiosaur’s head. “What the hell happened?”
“That’ll take more time,” Luke answered, irritated by the mere thought of having to do more work on the same arena. “We haven’t even finished the outer walls yet!”
“He’s out in the park, Tony,” Steve answered him, trying his best to keep his tone of voice composed. “He’s probably enjoying himself with his boyfriend, just keep trying.”
Peter glared, crossing his arms over his chest. “If you don’t let me come I’ll tell Aunt May you said her hair looks like a birds nest!”
“That doesn’t matter!” Steve said in all seriousness, becoming irritated that nobody was even thinking about the dangers they were about to face. “She’s smart, you saw that. She
“I thought we were supposed to see dinosaurs on this tour, Petey.” Wade deadpanned, flattening his face against the window of the vehicle. “I see grass, trees, trunks, fences, even bugs, hell is that a rabbit?”
The three men looked over at the person approaching them. A tall woman with dark hair and a stern expression, her builder’s hat mismatched with her leather boots and jacket.
“Sure,” Tony hummed, checking his phone for any new emails from his company. “And you think kids don’t like the good ole t-rex anymore?”
“You’re not wrong,” Tony sighed. “Think we should look for your phone too, warn them about the Pterodactyls.”
Loki could feel his heart beat rapidly in his chest as he sprinted up Main Street, bumping past a small crowd of people that were ducking for cover, trying to stay on his feet as he felt his entire body shake and go weak in fright. He eyed the information centre yards down the road, breath catching as he realised it was further than it looked. And as he took another step, he heard a noise that made his blood go cold.
“NO!” Jessica yelled back, pushing Steve away towards the gate. “Get out of here! Just go!” she said, face contorted in anger.
“Oh, great.” Tony wanted to laugh, thinking of the look on Loki’s face when he’d asked him to show his nephew and Wade around. “Really enjoying himself, can’t stop smiling.”
Thor didn’t hear him, moving on to searching through the cameras to try and find the creature. Tony had heard him though and he watched with a heavy heart as Steve walked away, resting against the wall at the back of the dimly lit room, looking like he had been through hell and back.
Tony thought about it for a second, scanning his surroundings in front of him, not letting his foot off the gas pedal in the slightest. To his right he noticed the greenery was just a tad thicker, tall trees and plenty of shrubberies around to take cover, and as Steve let off another shot with his rifle, Tony swerved the jeep in a different direction.
“What’s the matter?” Steve asked beside him, leaning over to see what the other man was so worried about. “Is that…”
Clint snorted. “Like Shield will allow that, they’d have to be pretty desperate to test out the raptor’s abilities outside of that cage.”
Before Peter could utter another word, the jeeps window was open and his boyfriend was leaping out of the moving vehicle like he was starring in the great escape.
“Yeah,” Steve could imagine Natasha now, yelling at them to get their asses into gear and get a move on. “I don’t… I don’t want her and Matt’s death to be for nothing, Tony. Nor Luke and Jessicas. We need to get that dinosaur, and we need to keep those visitors safe, for them.”
Tony almost jumped at the booming voice of one of the workers at the back row, he gazed over at him as the man stretched his arms into the air and grinned from ear to ear. Tony snorted, standing beside the long haired guy.
Steve could tell by the way he greeted Luke with a punch to the shoulder, which he was usually way too petrified to do. Luke wasn’t impressed, but continued to stab at the computer screen in the corner as Tony spoke animatedly to him. Steve took the opportunity to look around, the room was big enough to fit at least a hundred people and it had plenty of information splattered across the wall that would undoubtedly take hours to read.
“Nothing’s going to jump out and eat us, right?” Wade whispered, as if someone were listening in on them. “What if this is the big, creepy dinosaur’s layout and he’s here waiting for us?” he said, looking around frantically.
Before he could summon up the courage to go that little bit further, the two were interrupted by the doors loudly slamming shut. The entire room stopped what they were doing at the lurid bang, all eyes turning to Bruce who stood there with cheeks as red as tomatoes, looking like he’d just done the most embarrassing thing in his entire life. He held up his hands and started apologising, avoiding all eye contact as he made his way over to Steve and Tony, more than relieved once the workers went back to doing their jobs.
As Steve said this he reached out a hand, guardedly placing his hand on the other man’s hand that was anxiously tapping away on his thigh. Tony jumped a little at the sudden touch, taking a quick glance at Steve who smiled softly back, before he turned his hand around to entwine their fingers. Steve didn’t pull his hand away, and Tony was glad for it, because having his hand in his again just felt right and made him feel at ease within seconds.
Steve looked like he’d been kicked in the gut, and Tony wanted to take him in his arms and hug him and tell him he was sorry. “Okay,” Steve’s dejected look changed so quick you could have missed it. “What enclosure?”
Back in the control room, Thor typed away frantically on his keyboard. His eyes scanned the screen in front of him, as he shut down each ride around the park, rechecked the electric fences and did anything else he could to try and keep the main street safe from any intruders, or gigantic, man-eating dinosaurs.
“If this is supposed to be one of the thickest pieces of glass in the world,” Steve went on. “Then how come the Foniassaurus can break it with one hit?”
And lo and behold, his phone began to ring. Loki picked it out of his pocket and read his brother’s name on the screen, rolling his eyes at the thought of him.
Wade glimpsed over, just as the dinosaur went out of their sight. He immediately knew what Peter was talking about, because with a second glance the older man could see that on the other side of the fence it didn’t exactly look alluring. It was dark for one thing, like all the trees had closed in on each other and created a spooky tunnel, and not to mention the fog floating across the ground and the creepy sounds of birds or whatever it was reaching their ears.
But before he could do anything else, the trees meters before them parted, and out stepped the Foniassaurus, its gigantic heat peeking through. The four passengers started at it in horror, as it let out an ear-piercing roar that blew the trees and branches from side to side.
Matt kept the tracker at eye level, taking slow, tentative steps through the wet, mucky woodland, feeling his heart beat rising the closer he got to the spot where the dinosaur was lurking. The device began beeping lightly, the red dot flashing faster and faster as Matt lead the team down a slight ditch, stepping into a shallow stream underneath tall, dark trees.
Realising he still had him in a tight hug, Tony quickly let go and took a tentative step back. He now too had a discrete smell of petrol over his shirt, but he couldn’t care less as long as Steve was safe.
Wade nodded speedily, rolling to the side off of the smaller man, as they both lay on their stomachs before lifting themselves onto their knees. The two looked behind them as the dinosaur stomped its foot, getting ready to dive in for another round of tree chomping.
“We’re going to die, we’re going to die, holy fuck my gravestone is going to say eaten by a dinosaur!” Wade shrieked.
“I know what I said!” Tony snapped impatiently, clutching his phone a little too tight. “Peter’s on a damn ride! Now get every single ride back in and contact every single employee at the park, tell them to make announcements to the guests to make their way to the information centre as quickly and calmly as possible.”
Steve shook his head, eyes staring at the ground, feeling like his words were going in one ear and coming out the other. They we’re preparing to walk to their deaths.
Peter chuckled as they made their way to the middle of the room, stopping to look at the touch screen information board. “Look, they’ve got a lab tour every four hours!”
Steve’s eyes widened, his phone dropping onto the dirt as he came face to face with the Foniassaurus, Jessica and Luke standing even closer to it. Steve could feel his heart begin to race, his palms were sweaty, and his legs began to shake as fear started to take over at the size of the thing standing before them, forty feet tall with jaws bigger than a T-rex. But he didn’t have time to be scared, he knew that if he didn’t act now they’d all be done for. Measuring the distance in his mind from where they were to the gate, Steve knew they’d have a chance, they just needed to run as fast as their legs could take them.
Steve smiled amusedly at Tony who was looking not so pleased at his nephew’s boyfriend’s comment, which, he hoped, was a lie. Peter ignored his comment, and instead grabbed Wade’s shirt and pulled him into a hug, needing it after what they’d just been through.
“Language, Peter.” Aunt May said as she drove off. “And yes you would, Wade. I may be old but I’m not blind.”
Tony felt himself instinctively reaching out to touch the dinosaur, just as Steve was doing, and run a hand along its smooth skin. He rubbed his fingers down its neck as carefully as he could, wishing he could do something, anything to make the pain go away for the poor creature.
“Tony,” Steve began, just as the dinosaur took one last deep breath, and closed its eyes. “It’s not your fault.”
“Steven!” Thor grinned, happy to hear his other friend’s voice. “Is Peter and his love safe and sound?”
“This isn’t exactly how I pictured my day.” Tony mumbled, as he trotted along the forest grounds, sopping shoes squelching with each step he took. “Remind me never to take you camping.”
“No.” he breathed out, his hands balling into fists in anger at what they saw. Metres ahead was a pitch of green grass with not just one other Brachiosaurus, but at least five or six of them lying there dead, big, red lacerations on parts of their bodies. “She did this.” Steve snarled. “She just killed them all, killed them for nothing.”
Peter stuck his tongue out, turning to Loki who’d gotten his nose stuck in his phone again. “Loki?” the man looked up unamused. “Any chance we could come back later for the lab tour?”
“WHERE?” Wade yelled, standing straight in a split second to look around with wide eyes. He was not taking on another damn dinosaur.
“No, you don’t understand.” Steve said, starting to sound panicked. “Tony, you need to turn up here, the next right.”
With that said Luke sauntered off into the enclosure’s viewing area, leaving the two once again alone. Before Tony could even think about what he wanted to say next, Steve had opened his door and was stepping out, carefully shutting it behind him as the engineer sat and stared at the spot he’d been occupying.
Thor was swept away to the dance floor by a horde of glittering debutantes. Tony was now chatting with a woman of his own age, who seemed to have problems keeping herself upright. Or was there any other reason for that proprietorial grip from Tony arm? Steve’s instincts were screaming it should be him. He should be the only one touching Tony that way, but…
“I sensed the situation was well in your control, Director. And I am afraid that in this case I can’t be much of assistance. I didn’t hurry, because I can’t offer any magical means to solve your problem. I don’t sense any dark magic in work here, nor I feel a magical presence of any kind.”
Steve hadn’t looked at his new phone. Now he checked the time. Was it really fourteen hours ago when he had bullied Tony to leave his workshop?
A little stinger, perhaps. It had been Steve’s initiative. He had started the kiss and ripping off his clothes like a horny tart. There was no reason for them to badmouth Tony all the time. That was Steve’s plan, but it backfired spectacularly.
Perhaps Steve should have been pleased people thought he was some rose-cheeked virgin who still had virtue to ravish. He entered the room after Banner. They were all there. The negro officer who had emptied his gun into Steve’s chest. The red-headed spy. The blond brawler. And now the doctor who claimed he had a monster inside him.
“I still don’t understand why they are fussing like old women”, Thor huffed. “I am from Asgard myself, and these Midgard habits escape me sometimes. But come, Warrior Monster! Come, eat and drink with Thor the God of Thunder, son of great Odin All-Father and grandson of Borr, son of Buri! Come and we share the tales of our victories.”
The funding and search were still going strong, as this turn of events suggested. They were ready, but unlike the general public, who still wished to see their heroes alive, Doctor Heller had poured cold water on those hopes so repeatedly they had been soaking wet and cold for months now.
“You will be late, Tony.” Steve popped a new slice and Tony’s breath hitched. “You look hungry though. Missed your breakfast. Want some?”
Fury knew what was coming, so he concentrated on looking at Stark’s face as Doctor took something from the medical trolley and lifted it over his head. It was a large, round object which looked like an over-sized salad bowl, if somebody was tacky enough to paint bottom of the bowl with red and white circles with a star in the middle.
, Fury thought bitterly. Now they had a supersoldier whose main reason for being was to watch nobody talked back to his sweetheart.
“Hello, birdy bird. How much of that did you hear?” Clint said after it was sure their guest was out of the hearing distance. Sam jerked, and finally seemed to remember what he was doing. He finished pouring the juice and dropped the empty bottle into the recycle pin.
“I don’t think so. Steve doesn’t feel anything like a dame, and… Maybe when we get Antonio stabilized we need a little chat with him.”
“Maybe you are not totally objective in this”, Nat said. “I got an impression you were getting along quite well before he showed you his interrogation techniques. Just think for a moment that Fury has something here. It could be that our visitors lied. Maybe they coming here wasn’t an accident at all and SteveToo’s worried act was just like that, an act. What better way to make them seem harmless than to play a part of the helpless victim.”
It took some time that Captain Punisher understood what Antonio was saying. He was hyped from the battle, ready to pull them apart with his bare hands, and when he realized who the real perpetrator in this mess was, it was only the combined might of the Avengers which kept him from crawling toward Hawkeye. Clint was still lying on the ground, unable to move and defend himself, screaming in fright like a drama queen he was.
That made his thoughts halt. That always made his thoughts halt, made him feel tired and small and confused. Unworthy and stained.
“During those weeks of capture, I fell for it. My friends were more cautious, but I have always been too readily to believe in the goodness of people. I fell for his act, took him in to plot our escape, not realizing that earnest young man was a mole. Nazis threatened his sister, forced him to spy on us. They used our plan as an excuse to annihilate a village nearby. Then they killed all their prisoners except me. That boy and his sister were among the executed.”
, Steve wondered. He didn’t catch the sound the second time, but the smell of sweat with its familiar mingle of booze and chemicals lingered in the air for a long time. Was the joke on him, the team, or Tony himself, he couldn’t decide.
In reality he was thinking about Paul. Paul who drew and painted like a real artist. Who Steve had been too much a coward to defend when his friends had mashed up Paul’s colors and papers. Too scared of those words his friends had shouted at Paul while leaving him lying on the ground, his usually soft eyes bleeding tears of anger and betrayal when he looked at his direction.
Nat’s blinis, Thor’s bellowing laughter, even Clint’s stupid jokes. The easy camaraderie was gone and instead they had their usual doses of nasty sarcasm, brooding, and sly glimpses from the eyes of the people they had to again learn to think as their teammates.
“You don’t have to apologize. And you don’t have to call me ma’am, Janet will do nicely. You have to excuse our Steve, he was still hyped up from the fight with those zoo escapees. He get sometimes a little rambunctious. Steve has this sensitive artistic side but the rest… Do you paint by the way?”
Steve’s fingers halted on the buttons. “I have seen your battle scars, Tony. I don’t resent them. But if leaving the shirt on makes you comfortable so be it.”
They rode the elevator to the basement floor. Tony’s workshop was there. Steve expected to hear some noise, like machines, and noise he heard. He wasn’t sure if Natalia was joking with him when she called it music.
“Hear, hear! No truer words, Warrior Monster! You are indeed a man of my very own heart. They say you are a vampire. That species is unfamiliar to me so I consulted my godly cousin, Hercules, who has roamed this realm longer than I am. He told me about a demoness, Lamia, who has the head and torso of a woman and the lower body of a snake. He told me also about empusai, the malicious daughters of Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, who walk the earth night times, seducing and devouring shepherds in the fields.”
Steve-on-the-floor, like he too suddenly thought himself, went still as all those questioning and curious and amused faces turned to evaluate him. “He is…” Steve-on-the-floor started, his voice raspy because of his dry mouth. “Antonio, he is younger than you. He got blue eyes, not brown, and olive skin, and he…”
“I am terrible sorry for misunderstanding, ma’am. Maybe the next one? This one I asked to play for Mr. Stark here.”
Then there were the most precious. The uniforms had their own track like helmets and boots and gloves had selves of their own, but he didn’t touch them. He chose dark blue jeans and a white T and a gray button down over his fancy, because he was sure that the other Steve hadn’t mean those when he said he could choose anything he wanted. The uniform was so much like his, but it wasn’t his for real, and he knew what he would have thought about any guy who dared to borrow one of his own without his permission.
“I guess nothing so dramatic, Sam. Last time this happened, it was a bird. It is hard to miss a bird sitting in the air... Never mind. Nat, talk to me. Any damage?”
That made him calm down. A bit. Maybe now was the time to explore why the medical team couldn’t locate Stark’s brain tumor anymore?
“Oh hey, Nat”, Tony’s voice answered. “I am just coding… now is not a good moment… if you could call back later and… hey, did you get me that strawberry chocolate I asked?”
Maybe he did, now that Steve thought about it. He had never seen Antonio home or in the meeting without a glass in his hand. But that was the way the men of his breeding behaved. Aperitifs before dinner. Fancy wines with food. Some cognac afterwards. Whiskey or brandy and a good cigar...
Another calculating look from those eyes as daring Steve to say something more. Then the other Steve huffed and shrugged his shoulders.
He muttered something about being sticky and wanting a shower. Then he really had one, after he had put his dirty clothes into the hamper. He knew that those stains would tell anybody what he had been doing, but he felt too drained to care. His enhanced hearing had been picking up signs there would be a guest waiting when he opened the bathroom door. He put on new underwear and sweats and then it was time to face the music. The other Steve was sitting in the armchair like he owned the place (which was actually true), but he didn’t mind that now, only continued dabbing his hair and neck and chest with the towel.
“Yuck! A total turn off. I have never liked when Wolverine does his thing. Super bones and healing factor, check! But… the gas, Fury. It is designed for Hulk, for fuck’s sake! It may kill Captain.”
No bootlaces, but some ingenious strap system. Banner’s question was strange. He had to see Steve was managing.
Doing it… He had been such a good guy! Why was it so cold? And why did his chest hurt when he tried to get more air into his lungs?
Their tussle had devastated the room but the rubble was removed like Thor had asked and Steve got a new bed, a table, and two chair. Steve was lying on his bed. Maybe he had a hangover, maybe not, but he was not prone to imagine things, so it had to be real. The wall across from his bed had became alive, and he didn’t mean like it had made itself a human form like Pinocchio. No, it was more like in a movie theater.
Then there was a workshop Steve gave more consideration. Some tools were still in place, like waiting for Stark to come and start tinkering with his toys. Why did he know it was this other Tony’s place? Well, there was a vintage pinup calendar on the wall, which presented Captain America in twelve different battle scenes. It looked like that kind of inside joke the group could appreciate, it was no way the other Steve would display things like that in his own place. He tried to imagine his Antonio grease smudges all over his hands and face, but that was s silly idea. Antonio was so clean and shiny. Not like that other Tony, who seemed not to be afraid to get his hands dirty.
Too close, and it hadn’t been a question. Steve felt how the heat started climbing from his chest to his neck and face. “That is not...”
She reached with her hands and the man gave her the piglet. It wriggled, didn’t like the way they moved it through the air. When it was safe in her lap, it calmed down again.
“Send in the cleaning wenches! And more food and drink! The night is still young and there are many tales which are not yet told!”
It had been three days. Director Fury of SHIELD had the team’s reports on his tablet. That included the on-going parallel universe incident as the set was called. Doctor Richards hadn’t still been successful in his ways to sent their surprise guest back to their own universe. And then there had come the team’s re-mach with Count Nefaria to consider. The Avengers had gotten their asses kicked, and Fury and Steve had been cooped up in Fury’s office to evaluate the situation. Now Director had finally time to re-read the medicals of Antonio Stark he had gotten in the morning, and take some action according to the results.
“Look at me”, Gail said. “I am weeping like an old fool I am. Please, Steve. Something more happy sappy. Did you and Antonio have a cake in your bachelor party? Those big ones. A stripper inside?”
Steve tried anyway. His scream of rage and pain made Tony halt his explanations. Tony was... maybe he was drugged or under some spell. He sounded different, like he was not totally coherent, not knowing what to say, and that wasn’t normal; Antonio Stark was the most eloquent man on God’s green earth.
Steve hadn’t waited Natasha to attack right after he let go of his shield. When he noticed the shield wasn’t going to hit its target, he pulled out his gun, another reflex, and shot toward the place his adversary had stood a second before. The wail of the wounded woman distracted Steve so that Natasha got in a mule kick, disrupting his movement lightly that the shield didn’t ricocheted back to his hand, but landed uselessly some five yards to his right, in the middle of the traffic. Steve hopped backwards, but another kick from Natasha’s fashionable but sensible shoe made him overbalance. He lurched a step back and straight among the honking cars.
Tony seemed to halt in the middle of his sentence, then he shook his head a little and continued talking, but halted again when he saw Steve was coming towards him.
“That is right”, Banner mumbled. “I have tried to talk with Tony, but it is what it is. The scandal media is sniffing his every step, always finding the worse.”
Again this. No Tony, he would not consider surrendering to a bunch of complete a-holes, who were just waiting Tony to get better that he wouldn’t raise pity in judges or public watching his trial. There was no hiding. No matter where Steve would go, they could track him with those nanoparticles. And what good would that do for him when Tony was gone.
Barton tapped his knuckles on the metal man to emphasize his words. “This fellow has saved our bacon in the field more times I can count. What good has its creator ever done, but to make an ass of himself in public.”
Steve’s muscles screamed with agony after pummeling for hours unyielding metal bodies. The buildings around him should be in ruins, the smoke from the burning cars filling the air… But there was no signs of their on-going battle with that alien menace, he was in the busy street somewhere which looked like Manhattan (how had he moved there from Long Island?). Tony was gone, and people walking past him in the sidewalk were looking at him curiously. Some of them had taken out their phones, taking videos or pictures, as Steve turned desperately this way and that, trying to decipher what had happened. This could not be real, but Tony was nowhere to be seen. His teammate was badly hurt and Steve had lost him. How?
“No”, Steve snorted. “And could you stop that huffing and puffing? Sir. This was baby-sitting job for your rookies, and it turned out to be very educational, but as you stated yourself they are not our prisoners but guests. Ambassadors as you put it, able to come and go as they please... Hopefully, just not mangling our colleagues in process. Clint is alright?”
“Now… later. You were there, Steve. You saw he was sweaty and convulsing. I just want to know if Antonio is an alcoholic, and if he is, what the big fellow over here had done about it. I mean, it was partly your credit that I sobered up… It was such a huge support to me, and I don’t want...”
A bad one, Banner meant. In spite of that, no armed guards were following the weedy doctor and Steve. Nor there was any other person in sight. They had emptied the route to avoid any problems.
He forgot the glass walls and the phone call which could watch his every move. The talking wall had told him men married other men now. It was like in the stories Elders told them about the old times. Steve could be openly with any man whose smell and taste made his blood run hot, and it had been too long. Their clothes dropped on the floor like autumn leaves. Steve licked and sucked and finally he bit, pushed himself deep into the man, and if he tasted booze and cocaine and other harmful things, it was not his place to say. It was not for him to judge, because he had been there too, scared of dying many times over, and if the man’s fear was not exactly about that final battle, but about what will happen before that, if he was scared of living and wasting his life and getting older, who he was to judge and say the man’s fear was stupid. Steve didn’t know him.
There must have been hundreds of Pterodactyls flying towards the street, screeching and squawking as they came closer and closer, obviously aiming right for the large mass of people running around frantically. Loki felt fear take over as he dropped his phone without thinking, and his entire body froze as one of the dinosaurs swooped down, right on top of a man who screamed in agony as the creature began tearing his skin apart.
And as the Foniassaurus got to him, Steve froze. Out in the corner of his eye he could see the dinosaur’s large feet, before all of a sudden it was bending down and it’s sharp, bared teeth came into view. Steve closed his eyes tight, not wanting to see what the animal’s next move would be, he just prayed inside his head that his plan had worked and he’d get out of this one alive.
Tony was so surprised at first he didn’t know what to do, but the feeling of having Steve’s lips on his again had him shut his eyes and take it all in. He pulled the younger man closer in his arms, and poured as much love as he could into the kiss, showing him just how much he meant what he said.
Luke held up his hand and pointed to the other end of the room. Tony hadn’t noticed it before, but right in the top corner of the glass was a crack, a large slash that looked like something had hit it pretty hard. Tony’s eyes widened. Bruce definitely hadn’t mentioned that.
He knew he’d messed up, God did he know it. Everyone had told him so, his sister, Bruce, Pepper, even Thor who loved Steve like a brother and wanted the two to work it out so bad. He suddenly had the urge to turn the car around, when all of a sudden his phone buzzed and he picked it up to find a text message from May. He smiled at what she’d written.
Wade was literally praying on the floor, which had Tony rolling his eyes. But he guessed it kind of worked, as once they’d driven under the dense shelter of the trees, the Pterodactyls flew higher into the sky, and further away from them, screeching irritably as they went. Tony stuck his foot on the break, bringing the jeep to a halt in the middle of the bushes.
If seeing the cabin was sentimental enough, he wasn’t prepared for the longing he felt when he laid eyes on Steve himself. As he drove slowly down the path and parked a fair way from the house, Tony saw him and he hadn’t changed one bit in the half a year he hadn’t seen him. The trainer was working on his motorbike as he did whenever he was feeling stressed, down on his knees in the dirt as he used a spanner to tighten up some loose nuts.
“I see you, Monty.” Steve turned to his left, following the raptor as he took a step forward. “Stay right where you are.”
Wade laughed loudly, gaining Loki’s attention. The two grinned at him innocently, which must have worked as he went back to typing away on his device.
Steve sighed as he jammed his inhaler back into his pocket, observing the raptors as their gaze tore from him, their forms retreating into the trees and out of sight. Incidents like that always made him realise just how hard he’d have to work to get his raptors to trust him.
Peter punched the air in victory, dancing around like an idiot as the engine of the jeep juddered and rumbled to life. It took him longer than expected to figure out exactly what was wrong with the vehicle, but eventually he’d stuck some wires in the right places, filled it up with oil, gave it a little kick and it had woken up with a jump.
“Thank fuck!” Peter yelped, eyes wide in terror as he watched the dinosaur lose stamina behind them.
Steve sighed, his heart breaking for the older man. He knew Tony never showed how much he cared for his family, but he knew he loved them more than anything in the world. “He’s alive, Tony. He’s a smart kid, he’ll get them out of trouble.” Steve said confidently, resting a hand on his cheek gently. “Tony, we need to go get weapons, find out where exactly Peter is and go from there. I’ll come with you, I’m not letting you do this alone.”
As she came to a clearing she stopped abruptly, her stomach turning at the sight of one of her soldiers on the ground, his body torn in half. She scanned the area as hurriedly as she could, not wasting time in rushing over to the body on the ground and picking up the vast gun that was dropped beside him. With slippery fingers she clicked the lock off, wiping the splatters of blood off the gun’s side with the end of her sleeve.
Without hesitation Steve shoved Clint aside and slammed his hand down on the red button that opened the thick, metal gate, and in a second he was rolling into the enclosure and running to Bobby’s side. He could hear the others yelling behind him to take cover, Clint shouting in utter shock at the man’s actions as he stood to the side, waiting to shut the gate if necessary.
Tony gulped, watching as Luke flicked some switches and turned some dials. He wanted to jump out and shout mercy but thought better of it as he’d rather not get beaten up by the seven foot, virtually bulletproof constructor. It’s not that he didn’t trust Luke to drive the thing, but from past experiences he wasn’t exactly thrilled about bringing up that afternoons dinner.
They’d been strolling through the woodland now for what felt like hours, and they had no idea where they were going. It just felt like they were going in one straight line which led to nowhere, and there wasn’t any sign of civilization, not even any dinosaurs were roaming around the area. Which, really, Wade was more than happy about. But being absolutely stinking from their roll around in the mud earlier, and freezing cold after their dip in the pond, they felt miserable and tired, wanting to get back to their comfy beds in the hotel as soon as possible.
“URGH!” Tony growled, rubbing a hand down his face. Kids. He was never having them. “That doesn’t matter now anyway, listen Peter…” a loud crackling suddenly shot through the phone. “Peter?”
“Okay.” Tony piped up, fidgeting in his seat for a while before he sat still. This was it, he had to do it now or his chance would be blown. “I uh… I just… you we’re right… about um… about me avoiding you…”
, it stared me down like she was studying me, not to mention I’ve heard of her attempt to break out through the glass at this new place. They haven’t done enough research or testing on her, not even Bruce and Hank knew her traits when I asked them.”
“Well,” Wade breathed out, coming to lay beside his boyfriend, and tangling his fingers through his hair. “That’ll teach us to jump out of a moving vehicle, huh?”
“Uh… Bruce, I um… I think we’d better go out into the hall.” Tony said to his friend, who didn’t like the tone of Tony’s voice one little bit.
“Of course.” Steve grunted. He watched as Tony’s expression turned from stern, to sad, to nervous, knowing he hated being in these situations. “Tony.” Steve said softly, the engineer looking up at him. “You need to stop this, you need to start putting your work to the back of your mind, or it’s not just me you’re going to lose.”
Tony was nervous. Extremely nervous. Heck he hadn’t felt butterflies in his stomach like this since, well, a long time. He felt so tense that he had the radio on full blast in the car, and sped down the dirt track a little bit faster than was legal, which made him feel just a tad better but not by much.
“Tony.” Steve called him softly and put a hand in his, before lifting a finger to point at the large screen.
Tony stood there mouth agape, wishing he had a good comeback but nothing seemed to be coming to mind. Meanwhile Wade was desperately trying not to laugh in Tony’s face.
“I’m not that crazy.” Steve said with a shake of his head. “Maybe I should send you in, Logan. I’m sure you could take on four small dinosaurs.”
“Just what you do.” He said, as Jessica nodded along. “This dinosaur should never have been made, if it can break this glass then it’s not safe.”
“She already has, Tony.” Steve said. “Remember when Matt found her tracker? She came out of nowhere, just walked out from amongst the trees like she were…”
Tony sighed heavily, wishing he was back in New York sleeping in his bed. “Yeah,” he said to Steve. “Yeah, we’ll be fine. I’m glad you’re here Steve.”
“Come on!” Peter sighed, grabbing a hold of Wade’s shirt and pulling him through the door. “We’re going to be late!”
(Just a quick reminder that my Tony is based off comic Tony, and he and Steve are the same height! Loki is young Loki also based off the comics. And my Spidey is Andrew Garfield because, well, he and Ryan Reynolds would have kicked ass together :P)
sorry again for the late update guys! I won't be posting regularly due to commitments but I'll do my very best! :) Enjoy!
Peter grinned. “Good to see you too! This is Wade by the way.” He said, pointing to his boyfriend who was currently trying to hide from Tony’s glare. “Wade, this is Steve.”
“Huh.” Wade hummed, standing beside the T-Rex and looking up in astonishment. “Do you think he skinned this bad boy just for its bones to be displayed in here?”
Tony gulped as the dinosaur retreated back into the trees, footsteps echoing as they hit the ground. “She scares
“That was one time.” Wade grinned at the memory. “That fence was practically yelling to be crashed into.”
“Now now, boys.” One of the other men spoke up. A younger looking boy around Steve’s age. “You two are like an old married couple, jeez.”
He felt chills run down his spine as a Pterodactyl flew right above him, crying out as it circled around and took a dive. Loki gasped in horror as the creature went for a woman right next to him, who was trying to run for her life, but it was too late as the Pterodactyl bowled her over and clawed at her back. Loki was so close he could feel the breeze from the animal’s wings, and hear its grunts and growling so clearly. He didn’t even think as he speedily rose off the ground, and began to run for it, not caring where he went as long as it was undercover and away from those dangerous monsters.
“WADE!” Peter growled, leaning out of the open door as Wade did some stretches on the grass. “Get back in here now!”
Tony and Peter spent what seemed like hours just standing there having a stare-down, before Tony finally caved and let out a defeated growl.
But he looked away, took a well needed breath, and thought about Aunt May cutting his tongue out if he didn’t get his butt out of the car. With one swift movement Tony opened his door and practically dived out, straightening his tie and rubbing down his suit encase there were creases. Steve still hadn’t noticed his presence since the radio was on, but as soon as Tony accidentally slammed the car door shut with a loud thud the blonde looked up and caught his eye.
That must have done it, as the next thing they knew the sound of the vehicle didn’t sound like it was getting further away, but closer. Within seconds Tony and Steve came to an abrupt halt as a jeep sped down the path right in front of them, coming to a standstill beside them, Peter and Wade looking over at them in surprise.
“Why?” Tony looked out to see if he could see what Steve was staring at as he slowed the vehicle, apparently it was something straight up ahead and out in the fields. “What’s wrong?”
“Anyway, gentlemen,” Steve began, grabbing his motorbike keys out of his pocket. “I’d best be off home, I’ve been hanging out with my lizards for a little too lo-,”
“Steve,” Natasha spoke up, giving him a one armed hug. “I’m glad you’re alright, I’m so sorry for what happened to Jess and Luke.” She said, keeping a hand on his arm. “But I promise you, we’re going to take that thing down.”
Schmidt grinned maliciously, staring Steve down. “Well then, let’s hope she’s not around for much longer.”
“Hey,” She said softly, making the younger man look up. “Don’t worry, if anything goes wrong out there we’ll abort, okay?”
“Tony,” Steve cut in, bringing Tony in closer by the neck, and smiling. “It’s okay,” he said softly, wiping away the single tear that had fallen down the engineer’s cheek. “I love you too, you idiot.”
Steve shouted sternly. He was stood on a metal bridge above an enclosure, holding out a dead rat in his hand as he looked down at his four Raptors who stood waiting, eyes wide and teeth showing.
Tony groaned, leaning back against the glass elevator and slapping a hand to his forehead. “But I hate it, all of it, can’t we just sponsor ourselves?”
Tony bit his lip in agitation. “Steve?” the man finally turned his attention to him. “I’m sorry for not backing you up, I just… I knew Nat wouldn’t listen to me if I told them not to go, so, I had to let Shield do what they needed to.”
“Tony,” Steve said from behind him suddenly, hand on his shoulder. “Tony, don’t drop your speed, she’s slowing down!”
“GO TO HELL, YOU SON OF A BITCH!” Natasha screamed, as she dug her knife into the monster’s skin, stabbing holes right along its top jaw.
Steve almost went flying out of his seat, including Peter and Wade who screeched, as the jeep they were in came to a sudden stop. Tony, behind the wheel, looked like he’d seen a ghost. Steve followed his line of sight, and realised he’d stopped the vehicle at least a hundred meters from an enclosure. The cage was like a gigantic sphere, made from thick glass, and from the outside it looked like a globe that contained a jungle, but what was really inside was much more dangerous. What made it worse, was the Foniassaurus sprinting right toward it.
Peter gave a roll of his eyes. Wade was right as usual, but he wasn’t going to admit that out loud or he’ll never hear the end of it. The teen gazed to his left, then to his right, no dinosaurs in sight but the one that hadn’t spotted them just a few meters away, and before Peter could change his mind and tell himself that this was the stupidest decision he’d ever made, he was yanking his backpack onto his shoulders and hopping to the ground.
So he gave it all he got, digging his nails into the dinosaur’s skin, jolting frantically in its grasp. Loki let out a sob as they neared the pool, feeling like it was almost over. But, suddenly, there was shouting and gun shots going off down below, and the sound of something zipping past Loki. The Pterodactyl was hit by a bullet as it let out a piercing shriek, and its claws opened up, releasing Loki from its hold as it fell to the ground with a big thump.
“Oh, last name, I’m in trouble.” Wade chuckled to himself before sticking a key into the ignition, and twisting.
“Sometimes.” Steve said as he approached the gap, Tony catching up with him. “What’s the fun in not taking a little risk?” he said sending a smirk Tony’s way.
“I’m fine, Tony.” Steve hummed, cringing as he touched his cheek. He looked up at the older man, who seemed more worried than he’d ever seen him. “I’m okay.” He whispered, placing a hand on Tony’s neck.
“Loki!” Thor breathed in relief, holding him close. “It’s alright little brother, you’re safe now. You’re safe.”
“It is,” Luke said, folding his arms across his chest. “It’s one of the thickest pieces of glass in the world.”
“I’m okay, Tony.” Steve said with a small smile, knowing exactly what the other man was thinking, standing there like a deer caught in headlights. He would have been thinking the same if their roles were reversed.
“Dinosaurs are like zoo animals these days,” Bruce said, snatching Tony’s phone out of his hand and putting it in his pocket. Tony glared. “We need something new, something bigger that will bring in the crowds.”
Aged twenty two and fresh out of university, Steve had his dream job and loved every second of it. Two years into it and he was still running around with the dinosaurs.
Tony sent him a small smile. “Yeah, I know.” He turned to Thor whose typing had come to a halt. “Turn them up to their highest level, Thor.”
They came together once more, kissing like nothing had happened before. But this kiss didn’t last long, as they were interrupted by an amused Peter Parker, Wade Wilson and Clint Barton who had appeared out of nowhere in front of them.
Tony really hadn’t liked the idea of jumping over an extremely tall cliff into the not so enticing looking pond, but after a bit of coaching from Steve, and knowing it would be a heck of a lot quicker that way, Tony had taken the plunge. Literally. Steve had leapt off the cliff first, throwing his riffle and phone over the side and onto the ground below just before his feet hit the water. He’d come up for air seconds later, floating around and yelling up at Tony to come down. Safe to say, the engineer would not be flying off any cliffs anytime soon, or ever again for that matter.
Peter didn’t say it out loud, but damn, he was impressed. “Well done.” Was all he could say, as Wade chirpily swung the map around in his hand as he got into the driver’s side of the jeep.
“You know I’ll always be here for you, Tony.” Steve said quietly, eyes turning back to the road, hand giving Tony’s a quick squeeze. “You’re not in this alone.”
Like a mole popping out of its hole, Wade appeared out of nowhere behind the jeep, a big, cheerful grin on his face. “Look what I found!” he crooned, holding up what appeared to be an aged, yellowing map.
So that’s where Tony drove them. Steve and he sped through an open gate into one of the main fields of the park, sporting one of the island’s best rides, where guests could drive around amongst the dinosaurs and watch them through the safety of the vehicles. Thankfully all the jeeps were back at the starting point, none of them out in the open, which meant the employees had done their job and gotten all the guests out of there. But all wasn’t in one-piece, as Tony drove down the grassy field and noticed something off.
Steve heard Thor take a deep breath on the other side of the phone, barely audible through the loud, aggressive sound of the engine of the jeep, the snapping of branches and tyres on stony ground. He couldn’t imagine what Thor was trying to sort out as it was, so he felt a tad guilty bringing him some more bad news.
Tony frowned. “Touché.” he mumbled, slinging his rifle over his shoulder. “So, if they jumped, where the hell would they go to down there? That’s the old part of the island. It’s literally split in half by this damn river.”
Bruce shook his head back and forth wildly. “No, no, it’s my fault! Mine! I should… god I should never have agreed to make that damn thing!” he let out a quiet sob, before a single tear trailed down his cheek. “Nat… god she’s dead because of me… and her husband… God, Jess and Luke were planning on having kids!”
Clint looked over at Steve who came bolting to his side. “He fell in the fucking enclosure!” the other man said angrily. “Pig got loose.”
What he didn’t see coming was the engineer screaming down the phone, his words making Steve wish he’d been wrong about the scratch marks.
Peter shrugged. “I told you what he was like, he’s married to his work, probably had business stuff to do.”
“Johann Schmidt.” Clint said, essentially spitting out the words. “Shouldn’t you be down in Shield’s office?”
“Not the time!” Peter yelled as he took a glimpse behind them, wishing he hadn’t as the dinosaur was so close he could smell the stench of its breath.
In a split second Natasha was on her feet, yanking the gun up and pointing it straight at the Foniassaurus who stood right behind her. Before the dinosaur could even get its jaws open, Natasha had pulled the trigger. She cried out in anger, Matt’s face fixed in her mind as she set off bullet after bullet, hitting the dinosaur square in its chest as it gave out an exasperated growl. The shots didn’t even seem to be making a scratch on the creature’s skin, the being roaring in anger not pain.
.” Steve answered in a rush, and Thor soon noticed that something was wrong by the sound of the younger man’s voice. “
As the engineer pressed down on the handle to the control room’s door, he took a deep breath and pushed. Tony slowly made his way inside, prepared to see a room full of workers frantically running around, giving orders and preparing for what was to come next. What he wasn’t expecting was for everyone to be sitting at their posts, silent, all eyes turning to him as he wandered in. Tony could feel the blood drain from his face at their sombre expressions, even Thor had the face of someone who’d been crushed.
“Here!” Thor ran over, handing her an electronic device. “Carol’s at the front row, she’s getting the cameras up, connecting your team to our computers.”
Dugan stood still, his claws clicking together in anticipation, waiting for his food to drop. Steve gave a loud whistle and the four dinosaurs looked up with their jaws wide open, the blonde threw the rat right into Dugan’s mouth and the creature bit down hard with an unsettling crunch.
There was a loud crash of something that sounded like wood breaking, followed by more screams that sounded like Peter and Wade, before the familiar echo of a dinosaur’s resounding roar echoed through the room. And then the line went dead.
Tony was out of the building before anyone could stop him, heading straight for his jeep. Steve had followed him the whole way, Bruce right behind him.
“Wade, come on.” Peter said as he started sprinting, dodging the branches and plants that were scattered in his way. “It’s a building!”
“Hey,” Peter stopped all of a sudden, Wade almost walking right into him. “Wade, do you see that?” he asked, pointing down the road, through the tall trees.
Steve and Tony shared a look, reality hitting them once again. In their moment amongst the madness, they’d completely forgotten that they were being attacked by flying dinosaurs, and a manmade monster they hadn’t even caught yet.
As Steve settled back in his seat, Tony pulled away his hand and stared at the blonde like a deer caught in headlights. He’d come this far to want to talk to Steve, and now he didn’t know how to start.
But it was too late. The stomping quickened and the ground practically split beneath their feet, before the trees metres from them were ripped from the dirt as a ginormous dinosaur sprung through them, it’s black, beady eyes immediately landing on the two men. It froze. The forest suddenly felt like a graveyard as the creature stood silently still, eyeing them up as if deciding which one to take down first. Peter and Wade shook in pure fear, wishing they’d stayed in the damn jeep.
“How am I supposed to pretend to drive now?” Wade screeched as the jeep took off slowly through the field. “Being the fake driver is not as fun as I thought it would be.” He sulked, prodding the wheel. “Doesn’t even have a horn.”
The other two stayed silent for a short while, letting Bruce silently cry into his hands to get it out of his system. But Tony knew that now wasn’t the time to mourn, not for any of them, because as they stood in that hallway the Foniassaurus was still on the move.
Peter rolled his eyes for the umpteenth time that day. “It’s not the trees I’m worried about, Wade!” he whined, wanting to hit Wade’s head against one of them to get some sense into him. “We don’t know what dinosaurs are through there!”
Tony frowned. “It’s Mr. Stark to you.” He said, noticing how Peter looked way too amused for his own good at the conversation. “And uh, how old are you exactly Wade?”
Taking long strides Tony followed the builder into the entrance of the dinosaur’s exhibit, being careful not to touch anything besides the doors as it wasn’t even finished yet. Walking through a small hallway filled with information on the walls about the Jurassic creature, Tony turned a corner and found Luke talking to a builder in a hard hat, right next to a thick, secure screen of glass that stretched from one side of the room to the other.
“Okay, fine!” he said, as Peter punched the air in victory and Steve didn’t look too certain about it. Wade, well, he was looking like he was about to throw up. “You can tag along, but you
Every time the engineer wanted to open his mouth to start explaining himself, or even apologise, he’d pull himself back and go downright blank. It wasn’t that he was being scared this time, but each time he’d pluck up the courage he’d gaze over at Steve who was obviously trying to avoid any conversation by the way he was sticking to his side of the car and turned away from the other man. His vibe was pretty clear that he didn’t want to talk.
Natasha froze. The sudden eerie silence around her making the hairs on the back of her neck stand up, goose bumps crawling over her skin. Then she heard it again,
“I know,” Peter said. “And don’t forget to tell Uncle Tony that he needs to ring you at least twice a day to let you know how we’re doing.”
Steve heaved a sigh. “Did you really have to avoid me for so long though?” he said, pulling his keys out of the bikes start-up. “I was worried about you.”
“Hey! He’s moving!” Peter perked up, shaking his boyfriend’s arm to get his attention. “Look! He’s going through that gap in the fence.”
Peter snorted, crossing his arms over his chest. “One, you’re starting to sound like Aunt May,” Tony cringed. “And two, didn’t you date that dinosaur guy called Steve like not so long ago who was, what did Aunt May say again? Oh yeah, twenty years younger than you? Wasn’t he a bit young for you?”
If Natasha said that she wasn’t nervous getting out of the company’s van, she’d be downright lying. She’d done plenty of missions like this, retrieving humongous dinosaurs, having to kill some wild ones, running through a herd that could have easily crushed her underneath their ginormous feet. But this, this felt a whole lot different. Not only was she clueless as to what was to come with this newly created dinosaur, but she also had Steve’s words replaying in her head. She knew he was right, of course she did, he was a professional when it came to dinosaurs. But she also knew the creature had to be stopped.
Rogers’s eyes moved toward Stark. It was only a tiny action, but told Fury almost too much and his innards filled with ice water when a list of possible consequences rushed into his mind. It took all of his considerable self-control not to bury his fist into Stark’s smug face.
Steve didn’t get to know what else Tony wanted to be. Antonio was out again and missed wholly those pompous stairs, Steve carrying his precious load to the second floor feeling like Clark Gable. Now he just had to find a room which had some furniture left. That proved to be an easy task. Like downstairs, the rooms were lightly dusty but otherwise they had most of the furniture intact. He chose one with a huge four poster bed because it still had its mattress under the dust cover, and because it looked like Tony, the room seemed girlish in a same way as Tony’s silken dressing gowns. (He couldn’t imagine to wear one himself, but they looked so good on Tony.)
“No coffee for him”, Nat said firmly. “He is still dehydrated and caffeine would make it only worse. He is going to drink more sport drinks and water, and after he has told us everything, he can eat. Not before, the food will make him pass out faster.”
“You condescending bastard!” A pillow was thrown on his head and then Tony was in his lap. His lips landed on his face and a firm grip locked around his neck and head. He kissed Steve’s cheek and mouth, dragged his lips over his jaw. His tongue stabbed the faint gap between his lips, demanding the entrance. Steve’s breathing accelerated. He wanted nothing more than open up for Tony, but he concentrated on exhaling and inhaling through his nose.
While the teammates quipped, he looked at Tony Stark again. It made sense that Antonio was one of the kind. You could always breed more super soldiers, they were only drugs and gym, so it was no wonder he and his own counterpart were so much alike. Yes, those cold blue eyes were familiar, but the man’s smile was strange, not exactly unfriendly, but not happy either, like his mind was in a state of permanent melancholy. His own lips were more often than not twisted in honestly angry grimace.
“Banner, keep off from the firing range. I don’t want to stress our jolly green by shooting you. What is wrong with the eyes? That must be the worst hangover face ever.”
Blood escaped from his face. Fortunately his complexion was so fair Barton probably didn’t notice. “You... execute people for being homosexuals?”
They hadn’t told the team about their marriage yet. That would be a dead giveaway of the yawning credibility gap between them.
“Alright, I am now a bit confused… Or… is this a virgin talk? Oh god, this is a virgin talk, isn’t it? You don’t have that much experience, and… Yes, I see. You want somebody to show you the ropes, and what is under and over them? Some tips to make it more exiting for your lady-love? God, what did Janet do to you, tried to ram a vibrating dildo into your ass? That could be nice, but maybe not for your first time… Alright, you contacted just the right man-whore, we aim to please.”
They all turned to stare at the being. Its helmet had been removed so there was plenty of that wheat-golden hair to see, but otherwise it showed fair skin, no even stubble on its face. No extra hair anywhere.
Steve took a few hesitant steps forward. He had a cup which he tried to handle to Tony, but because he was still too far away, he stopped his gesture and came forward again. “I was going to bring you chocolate, but Jarvis said it had alcohol in it. He apologized, said he will start trying his recipe without.”
How could he forget, Steve thought. He had sat on his bed for hours, bawling his eyes out, staring at the covers of the LPs his team had bought for him. Andrews Sisters, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington... But those things in Tony’s safe room were not signed copies of all Steve’s favorite books, were they?
Fury was taking a stand to orientate himself, but Stark was of course minding nothing about it. “Director, I hope you realize talking like that to two gay men is a crappy way to present yourself.”
“Yeah, overcompensating kind. Nor he is as techno savvy as our Steve. He looked at his phone like it would bite him. That guy doesn’t use Internet to know otherwise. We just keep him away from the movies or series there are guys smooching, not to blow our tale. This is going to be fun.”
After he had waken up from the ice he had seen many strange things and fought many hard battles. This wasn’t in top ten.
“Hugs and kisses, and I awarded her with a rate A gossip”, Steve promised, waving his full ring finger in front of his friend’s face. “Please, don’t sell me to paparazzi.”
“Tony no!” Steve had seated himself, but those careful queries made him jump up as if Tony’s bed had turned into a nest of big and angry wasps.
“There is this other dead giveaway about vampires”, Anderson continued. “If he were a vampire trapped in the ice for seven decades, his magic storage would be very low. He should be starving, if using human concepts is allowed in this case. His first and only priority would be to gorge himself with his victim’s Qi energy, and that didn’t happen.”
Lift me, he wanted to say. Lift me like I would be your little princess, I don’t care, I am beyond any dignity, my chest hurts, my stomach, my head, everything, lift me, carry me away from here, carry my away from this agony.
Keeping secrets from the people close to you would be tiring after a while. But that was another thing Steve couldn’t hurry. Tony would reveal himself only when he was ready.
“No Tony! You don’t understand... God, forget Janet, would you! I want… with you, yes I really do, but I haven’t been with anybody. Not really. I have no idea what to do. And I want it to be good for you. Not like…”
“That’s better”, the other Steve commented when he let his body settle in the parade rest. “I am no liberal, at least not in a way you meant it, so curb your fucking tongue! So… I would want that too, that world you were talking about, yes, I liked it when little girls wore blue, the color of Virgin Mary, and little boys were dressed in pink, that training version of manly red. But there is that thing, you know… Well, little or big, but it makes your arguments sound like some preacher man his hand inside underage hooker’s panties.”
There was a kitchen and its cool cabinets, always full of good food. Without his metabolism and that damn gorgeous gym Steve would have been putting on more than a few pounds.
“Yes, Steve. It is not like Clint’s, and you trying to push through it… not a good idea. You know it will hurt badly.”
“Alright”, Steve sighed. “Director is still insisting we do not engage. I would like to say it is because of the hostage, but...”
They seemed to be as they were, at least Stark was, unfortunately. But Fury had not been able to keep his position or his life all these years, if he had been careless.
“Jake, now is certainly not a good time to shut up”, Janet advised. “If you have some information about the missing member of the Stark family, you better tell us now.”
“Stark, open your fucking eyes! A big fucking disappointment, that is the only way to describe this situation! A PR catastrophe in making! My most horrid headache of the month! Took your pick. Captain America puked out a human damn finger! Dear Lord, I had his poster on my wall until I joined Army. I don’t care if he won the war for us by his two bare fists. He is not coming out of that room any way but pieces… Yes, finally! Agent Sanders, alarm Jonathan Anderson.” Anderson was the chief mage of the SHIELD magic division. “Tell him to get his ass to the labs asap and bring the garlic. We have a situation.”
He had no idea how long he had been lying there. Maybe it was already time for hallucinations, which were this time the nicest part of his withdrawal symptoms, they made him imagine Steve calling his name.
Fury sighed and took a better hold of the railing. After the thought had come into his mind, keeping himself upward had felt like an effort. These were the moments he really felt his age.
“Alright… You don’t look like you are going to give your condolences. I guess there just isn’t any progress.”
“If the super soldier serum has altered his DNA, it is possible that his offspring would have the same abilities. An interesting but ethically complex question what Mr. Stark is raising here. But I was not thinking about that. Curtis, could you help me, please? Touch his artery, like you would search a pulse. What do you feel?”
“We know.” The armor was now talking, and as gods would have wanted, there was no getting rid off Antonio Stark. “Steve was talking about the raid we were doing in the base of neo-Nazi organization. Steve, darling, let me out of this can, will you.”
Fury wondered those teeth. How they were so white, when the lower portion of its face was smudged with blood. Bruce’s blood.
Steve didn’t understand. It was mostly a sleepless night, and when he finally fell asleep he dreamed about drowning. He was sinking inside the airplane to the bottom of the Arctic Sea, with a bomb load which was meant to the east coast of the USA, a useless sacrifice in a chain of his other useless deeds. It would all disappear in a vast blast of light and mushroom clouds.
“Don’t think I don’t know anything just because I have been acting nancy longer time than you have. I still remember what it was like to strut around like your dick is two size too big for your trousers. You remind me how easily my life could have continued to be plagued by meaningless, nasty fears and that is scary. You can’t paint because it is sissy. Reading is for limp-wristed scholars and singing for church ladies, no matter how nice voice you have. No dancing, that nobody would notice you are actually good at it like some poof.”
There was another round of slow hugs and hand holding which made Fury feel like a damn peeping Tom. Just when he was about to tell Captain Danvers he would be in his office, Anthony took out his phone and the atmosphere in the lab changed. Maybe it was some fantastic invention Fury’s scientists would kill to study? Silly snapshots from that infamous birthday party? But of course not. When had Fury been that lucky.
...and there he went again. Couldn’t he keep his stupid mouth in check even five minutes? For his astonishment Steve didn’t show him an angry glow but seemed to give the thought some serious consideration.
Tony shot up, his pretty face turning into an ugly grimace. His whole body was shaking with hardly contained anger. “What the hell you know! You haven’t even been there yet. You haven’t… You don’t know...”
Then had come the Senate hearing, and Fury had to admit that yes, he had lost two of the national heroes. They were missing, suspected dead. The people mourned, no, the whole country mourned for weeks, which was funny, when usually Captain Rogers’s pig-headed opinions or his way to solve any problem with extreme violence were not respected by the more liberal-minded members of their nation. But that was not the first time when a man turned into a saint after dying. Maybe their carefully crafted PR-work was now paying off too. The New York City Council was already planning a hero park with an enormous memorial, and a constant stream of flowers and candles was still coming to the place where Captain America and Iron Man was last seen to defend the humanity against the hordes of alien Mechanoids (which had only a few hours later stopped functioning on their own because of some mysterious malfunction in their biomechanical structure). The missing heroes were all that people talked about for months, so when Fury told to Senate about Doctor Heller and his theories and suggested a research project, the funding was not a problem.
Steve sat up. The screen was not as big as in theaters, but it didn’t have to be. It was right there, a few yards from him showing him moving pictures and talk and text in a giddy whirlwind which settled down into a title of the film he was soon going to see.
“Sure, if you like those surfer types. Blond, muscular, tall… much like me actually. I would have to be narcissist to be in his fan club. And overall, I have always found his brother Loki more eye-pleasing.”
Tony snorted. “Nope, not in the slightest. But Peter can be a little shit sometimes, and I really can’t be bothered to argue.”
“Tony, I’ve seen that thing a couple of times, hiding behind the trees in its old enclosure.” Steve said in all seriousness. “It’s not
“Look after your wife, Matt.” Tony said playfully, trying to brighten their moods but only earned an eye roll from Natasha.
Aunt May rolled her eyes, leaning in for a quick hug with Wade. “You’d better look after him, or I’ll slice your balls off.”
That’s precisely what the engineer did. Slamming his foot down on the gas, Tony swung the wheel to the right and had the jeep skidding through the mud, bits of dirt and dust flying into the air. Peter and Wade screamed as the car almost fell to its side from the sheer force.
“It doesn’t have to keep going on like that, you know.” Steve said, catching the other man’s gaze. “You even told me yourself that you hardly see your sister anymore, Tony. Not to mention Peter.”
“Shouldn’t you be minding your own business?” Schmidt retaliated, giving Clint a once over before taking a few steps back. “Well then Steven, I guess we’ll have to cut this short. I will see you soon.”
“The employees are doing their best, sir, they’ve all been told it’s an emergency.” Thor answered. “It’ll take minutes.”
Once again the engineer was startled, but this time by his nephew. He looked over at him thinking something bad was going on over there, but instead, found Peter and Wade gesturing behind him.
“Thor told us what happened, we got the team ready as fast as we could.” Matt said, eyes on the floor. Luke and Jessica had been a close friend of his since school, hearing the news of their sudden death was like a punch to the gut. “I can’t believe they’re gone.”
Peter gave him the best ‘are you kidding me?’ look he could muster up. “Take a good look, idiot.” he said, pointing in the direction of the dinosaur’s trail.
Turning around, ready to get the hell out of the dinosaur’s space, Steve answered his phone. “Tony?”
“Peter!” Tony wanted to yell, hit something, collapse and sleep for a few days, but instead he chose to run over to the driver’s side of the car, and swing open the door. “Don’t you ever do this to me again!”
“Steve,” Tony went on, feeling more and more ready to let the truth spill out as he went. “I realised when I left that you were right… God you were so right! I was never there for you as much as I should have been! All those work calls, meetings, events that I’d spend hours at until early hours, flying off to New York all the time… I should… I should have treated you as my first priority, not my work, and I’m so fucking sorry.”
“You can’t help unless you have a bloody gun in your pocket!” Tony said impatiently, pushing Peter away. “Now go!”
“Well, you two are.” Tony said, pointing between the two. “You can get on the boats before they leave, go, now.”
Tony laughed, eyes widening as Steve stepped through to the other side of the wall, into the not so inviting dark woods. He didn’t really have a choice but to follow. “You’re starting to sound like me.”
“Please don’t.” Bruce slipped his glasses back up his nose. “You should be focusing on these sponsors that we’re about to meet.”
Schmidt laughed loudly. “Ever the joker, Mr Rogers.” He gave a salute to them both before retreating with a big grin on his face. “Say hello to your raptors for me won’t you?” he called back as he got into his truck and sped off onto the road.
Inside was another disappointment, and Wade pouted. The room had a large, round table sitting in the middle, surrounded by rotting chairs, and stacks of more wooden seats down one side of the wall.
Steve and Peter moved their gaze to the sky, and felt as scared as Wade looked. Apparently Pterodactyls were fast, as the giant, flying dinosaurs were right above them, and some were making a dive straight down towards the jeep.
“Exactly.” Steve sighed. “There’s no way I’m letting Schmidt get his hands on my raptors, he’s obviously up to something bigger than just seeing how powerful these dinosaurs are.”
It was seconds before he was dragged out of his sleepy state by Wade’s loud gasp. Peter sighed and opened his eyes once again expecting to see a couple of rabbits hoping along the grass, but as he followed Wade’s gaze his eyes landed on something that was a whole lot bigger than a bunny. Peter jumped up in his seat, leaning across the seat and practically sitting in Wade’s lap to get a glance at the dinosaur moving close to the fence.
Bruce turned to him with a frown. “He would be proud of you, you know? He’d be happy with everything you’ve done for this place.”
The engineer took a quick glimpse in the side mirror, seeing the dinosaur take big steps behind them, opening its mouth to cry out. It was so close he could feel the creature’s breath breeze past him like a gust of wind, except it smelt like garbage and death, and Tony would hurl if he wasn’t focused on getting them the hell out of there. So, he pressed the pedal to the floor, pushing the vehicle as fast as it could go through the muddy forest. The jeep picked up speed, blasting off like a rocket, hitting low branches and crushing logs under its tyres.
It didn’t take long for them to arrive. Wade jumped up and down like a hyperactive child beside Peter, as the younger of the two stared in wonderment at the gigantic island in front of them. A wide spread of trees covered the mountains that almost touched the sky, mist streaming like a waterfall at their peaks, a long stretch of beach laid out at their end. It was like looking at something off of a postcard, another world where only nature existed.
“Tony,” Steve stepped in, as Tony thought of how he was going to find Peter in all this mess. “You know a lot of guests will be difficult, they’d want to take their things with them, maybe they split up with their friends and want to find them, it’s not going to be easy persuading them to evacuate the island.”
Peter smiled to himself, stepping over the thick vines sprawled across the marble floor, making his way over to one of the doors on the right. It was different to the other doors, made from metal and a bit smaller, with a square sign stuck in the middle. Peter couldn’t read it from the thick layer of dirt plastered across it, so with his sleeve he began to wipe the filth away, revealing blocked letters.
“We have to get those people off this island.” Steve added, regarding Tony in all seriousness. The engineer looking like he was about to rip his hair out in annoyance.
“What do you want, Schmidt?” Steve didn’t even turn to look at the German as he came to stand beside him, instead he kept his gaze on the trees.
Natasha’s grip on the gun tightened. She thought of her husband, dead on the ground not far away from her, of her soldiers who’d lost their lives mercilessly, of the thousands upon thousands of innocent lives on that island that were oblivious to the danger that was unfolding that very minute. She wasn’t going to run, she was going to do her job and fight for those people, no matter the consequences.
“Very funny guys,” Bruce chuckled, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. “You got me there… very creative… a little over the top though… I mean…”
“I’m sure they will,” Bruce said confidently. “Creating a new dinosaur will get them to listen and be interested in the park enough to sponsor us, they’ll be begging to be a part of this.”
Peter was more interested in the view from the balcony when he opened the double doors. Right in front of them stood the entire park itself, they could literally see every inch of it. From the museum centre, to the laboratories at the back, and the main street where all the cafes, shops and restaurants mounted amongst the thousands of guests and staff. Peter watched in wonder, taking it all in, goose bumps adorning his skin as the sound of a dinosaur’s roar echoed across the island.
Tony could see the clogs turning in Steve’s head as he tried to work out how exactly the genes of a tree frog fit into the Foniassaurus’s DNA. The blonde wasn’t too familiar with the cold-blooded animal, but he had an inkling of some of its traits. He put the puzzle pieces together within seconds once he’d listed the tree frog’s abilities in his head, dread washing over him like a cascade of freezing cold water.
As the jeep sped off down the clear pathway, at an alarming speed, Peter and Steve took a look behind them. The Foniassaurus was following, practically running after its prey, its enormous feet stomping aggressively on the ground, as it snapped its hungry jaws at them.
The room was deadly silent. Every employee now sitting at their stations awaiting orders, Thor and Carol already done with connecting Shields cameras to the main screen, every soldier’s individual body cam brought up for the entire control room to watch their every move. All eyes were on Tony as he gazed around the room, heart pumping probably as fast as those soldiers as they got closer to the danger.
The scientist looked up, guilt etched across his face. “Was there any other reptile genes in her?” Steve asked, already dreading the answer.
Peter couldn’t argue with that. And before he knew it they were mere inches away from jumping off of the rock face. They had seconds before they could decide whether to chicken out and stop, but when the Foniassaurus let another roar tear out of its throat they didn’t have to decide anything. Peter and Wade squeezed each other’s hands tight, and with a giant leap they fell from the cliff top, the Foniassaurus skidding to a halt as it tried in a last attempt to reach out with its jaws to catch them.
The engineer hung up on Thor, not caring what he had to say next, because he needed to hear Steve’s voice for himself, he needed to get them the hell out of there before that thing got anywhere near them. Hands continuing to shake out of control, Tony hurriedly dialled Steve’s number, knowing he’d get a hold of the group a whole lot quicker that way.
Steve gazed at his bike then up at Tony like it was apparent. “I’m going to the Foniassaurus like you asked me.”
“Maybe he was talking about the Foniassaurus?” Clint suggested. “Maybe she’s gotten into somewhere? Through the fences?”
The Pterodactyl had him in his claws, and was flying him in the direction of the information centre, all the while Loki was kicking his legs out, scratching at the creature’s talons, anything to get it to drop him. But the dinosaur wouldn’t let up, and without warning it turned around and flew back the other way, heading right for the gigantic pool. Loki panicked even more, knowing if the Pterodactyl did drop him when they were across the large pond, he wouldn’t have a chance in there either, knowing what lurked beneath the deep waters.
The engineer just about saw the Pterodactyl that flew at them with an ear-splitting squawk, and he didn’t have time to do anything before the deafening sound of a gun shot went off behind him and sent the dinosaur tumbling to the ground. He took a glimpse in the side mirror, seeing Steve in the backseat, rifle pointed up into the sky. Tony couldn’t help the smirk that grew on his lips, knowing there’s nobody they could rely on more than Steve Rogers to keep them safe.
Peter smiled, secretly relieved as hell that there were no buttons and leavers his boyfriend could mess around with. God only knew the trouble he’d get them in if there were. But within minutes Wade was practically bouncing up and down in his seat, steering wheel be damned. The jeep had taken off slowly into the open field just in front of the small building, and was soon entering the dinosaur’s territory through the massive, brown gate.
“God, Steve.” Tony chocked, naturally putting an arm around the other’s back, and gently pushing a strand of hair away from his face with his free hand. “I… I thought… shit, I… I love you, Steve.” Tony blurted out, not giving a damn this time, because he had to tell him the truth. “I love you so, so much, Steve, I’m so sorry, I-,”
“Thor, your energy is sky high every time I see you.” Tony said, eyes scanning the security feeds. “What do you take, and where can I find some?”
Tony heard the despair in his voice, it didn’t go unnoticed. “What?” Tony questioned. He didn’t know what could have been worse than a gigantic dinosaur escaping, and almost killing people. But then it struck him. He’d been so concerned about Steve that he’d blocked out everything else.
