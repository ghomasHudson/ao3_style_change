“Congratulations, Janet Van Dyne. You are officially the co-captain of the new West Coast Avengers. “ Was all he said, even extending a hand out to shake. Jan smiled at him and jumped out of her seat, pulling on Fury’s extended hand and pulled him forward. She forced him into an over the desk hug. She let him go and smiled at him. Fury just swiveled his seat to sit at an angle, a hologram screen and keyboard coming alight.
Tony turned around in a rage, raising a finger and pointed it at Steve. “It’s what I deserve and will do with or without you.” Tony hissed between his teeth. Steve stopped in front of the elevator, looking at only Tony with wet eyes. “Isn’t that you want, Steve? Don’t you want Barnes as your omega?” Tony spat, driving in a metaphorical knife into Steve’s heart.
“How dare the Captain! To be unloyal to our omega!” Thor boomed as Bruce seethed silently in his own seat. “Let me have words wi-” Thor growled out, his eyes turning an electric blue. His eyes looked so heated they were almost white. Tony stood fast and placed his hands on the god’s chest.
” The first woman absolutely shrieked through the coms. “Oh, you must have some
They sat there in the dark, in silence. The only sound in the room was the occasional sip from Tony. The room was strained and awkward, neither man knowing where to take the conversation. This whole situation displayed actions of a certain intimacy that neither party should be privy to. Tony shouldn’t be in Stephen’s room, in his bed with his cloak on him like they were mates. Tony was
, I think it’s solid.”
Literally.
Steve stood right in front of Tony as the elevator started to make it’s way down to the lowest levels of the car park. Pepper, Jan and Rhodey stood behind Tony, against the elevator wall.
Tony must have passed out at some point because it was dark, he was in a bed and being huddled by two alphas. It was warm and safe and familiar.
good at what she did.
She was shaking him and shouting something. Every time she spoke the ringing in his ears kept getting louder. Now Bucky was by his side, shaking him more gently but trying to get his attention as well.
Tony ran a hand through his hair and sighed. “I don’t know, Carol. She’s beyond qualified and Stephen trusts her. Which is something every other doctor out there won’t have. Plus, me being jealous isn’t rational-”
Steve’s therapist would say he might self sabotage himself because he feels guilt about a
Tony thought hard as to why he knew that name. He knew it-
“We’ve missed you, you big lug! Where have you been?” Jan asked breathlessly as Thor put her down on the ground. Jan looked over at Bruce and opened her arms. Bruce smiled at her and took up her offer of a hug.
“So, Stephen doesn’t know you're in love with him and you're
“There’s nothing there Jan, even if there was-” Jan clapped her hands and squealed at the statement. “-

“Steve, it feels
.” Carol laughed.
Tony would give them one million to relocate but after that they are not allowed to contact Tony, and are not to pursue him legally in any way for anything, no matter how long it’s been. Tony puts his hands on his stomach again.
“Only
Luckily, Strange was enough to keep Tony safe until they reached Tony’s dorm. Tony had silently led the way to his dorm. Tony unlocked the door and opened it, he went to walk in but turned to look at the alpha.
“So.” Stephen started. “I should start this conversation with' I've already looked into the future.” He said casually, Jan and Tony looked at each other waiting for the punchline.
“I’m pregnant, Jan Banan.” Tony whispered his friend's childhood nickname. Rhodey put his hand on Tony’s shoulder and squeezed. Jan’s eyes widened, her mouth falling open.
“Tony?”
Tony kept the alpha’s offer in mind.
Thor looked at the omega, studying his face for any signs of lying. After a few minutes Thor nodded at the omega and sat back down, still grumpy written on his face. The air was still thick with spark and the sky outside was still dark but the wind had stopped.
Jan braced herself and crossed her arms in front of her as her feet hit the pavement, she stumbled forward and into the ground. Jan groaned at the impact, trying to get herself together. She stood up, her legs shaking a bit but she turned and looked up.
“How’s space?” Nick asked as he took his own glass back and raised it towards her. She raised her own glass back with a nod before she took a sip.
It made Bucky want to vomit.
I hope you guys liked Carol and Stephan!!! I'm not sure if I should refer to him as Stephan or Strange in text not dialogue ya know, let me know what seems better to read!
Tomorrow they would hunt down Strange and get answers out of him. Then they would address the aliens and Tony could finally go back to California and start
Natasha’s eyes softened a bit. She could relate, as an alpha. Losing an omega was something alpha’s rarely survive. Natasha remembered losing her omega, and she wouldn’t hesitate following them if they came back from the dead. But she had another omega, Tony. Their light. Their omega. She had been searching for this her whole life, this pack, an omega to serve. She couldn’t lose this now. Not because Steve is an idiot who can’t keep it in his pants. Natasha looked at Bucky who wouldn’t meet her eyes. A different man than the one that shaped her in the Red Room.
Who could have guessed
, Jan. And I’m pregnant. It’s just not-” Tony signed and dropped into the couch in his workshop. Tony didn’t bother to finish his thought. He threw an arm over his eyes and let out another sign. “Just not right now.”
“AH! Did you see that!” Jan yelled as she pointed at nothing in front of her. “I got like, half a circle! Strange?” Jan asked, looking at him for validation on her performance of the mystic arts. Stephen looked at Tony. The omega gave the alpha a look that said
Hope everyone is staying inside and stay safe, we're in this together!! Thank you all again <3 <3 <3 <3
Bucky stayed standing in the middle of the gym, he didn’t know how long. Steve had eventually come to get him. Concern in his eyes.
Carol wanted to let the Wasp finish, she was enjoying this conversation. It felt nice, almost like having friends. Carol missed having friends, the deep vastness of space left little to do but survive. That was a deeper and more depressing thought that was fit more for a lonely night.
Before Tony knew it, he was walking down a brownstone neighborhood. The kind that had cement squares with trees in the middle in front of every building. It was nice, quiet. It was a rare sunny day in New York. Tony could hear birds chirping. Tony slowed down his walking pace to a stroll. Tony didn’t know what was pulling him down this street, but Tony just felt it in his bones that something he needed was near.
Stay safe!
I loved him! I loved all of them! So much,
. An alpha that he hadn’t even really talked to outside of class. Scared, and going into what Strange suspected to be the young boys first heat. Tony
, Jan thought as she left Fury’s office.
. I need to know what the hell is going on, this is bigger than just you and me. I need to know if anyone is compromised before I send them into a war zone.”
” Natasha said with such harshness Bucky actually flinched.
“You destroyed the Chitauri fleet, single handedly.” Carol explained as she cocked her head. “That’s no easy feat, word traveled fast of Earth’s greatest defender. The great Merchant of Death.”
scared him a little. It wasn’t hostile, Strange was sure enough of that. So he let it go, wanting to be civil with a potential ally. Strange walked with his hands in his pant pockets, planning his day out in his head.
’ for an entire space army.
He first went to the bedroom’s restroom and peed. Once he was out he saw Jan out of bed. She wasn’t wearing the yellow dress she came in but some sweats and a shirt that looked like Pepper’s. Tony know’s it’s Pepper’s because he had gotten her the shirt as the world’s worst joke. It was a gray shirt with a large realistic pepper shaker on it. That was it, Pepper groaned for an hour when she opened the gift.
. They wanted answers but even they didn’t
It smelt of Jan, sweet cinnamon and honey. The omega's scent was comforting to Tony, he’s known it since he was a babe. Jan jumped into bed with him, still talking everyone’s ear off. There was only one person who could keep up with Tony fast paced brain and mouth; and sometimes out talk Tony. Jan and Tony weren’t sure who picked up the trait from who.
, Maria, you are allowed to wear other shoes.” Howard would grumble almost angry, but more concerned as he put on new band aids for her. Maria giggled and reached over and pinched Tony’s little cheek.
.” Jan heard Carol say softly, probably unaware she even spoke.
Steve barely had time to push Bucky off him before Natasha came running over, jumping and coming down on Steve, knife in hand. One of the many she keeps on her body at all times, Steve is sure. Steve rolled and dodged Natasha’s blade. Natasha was a Black Widow and wasted no time jumping on Steve and wrapping her hands around his throat. Steve watched her eyes turn red with Alpha Rage. Steve didn’t move to get Natasha off him.
Natasha’s wet eyes looked at Steve who just slumped forward, and Bucky was silent. Natasha took a deep breath in and held it. What was there to say? What were they thinking? Tony let out a sign, he was exhausted. He sat back down in his seat, welcoming Pepper’s hands over his and squeezing it.
Natasha didn’t finish, tears escaped the corner of her eyes. Bucky’s own anger died quickly. Natasha never cried. She hadn’t cried since she was a small child. The only time Bucky had ever seen her cry, and it was when Natasha had lost her omega many years ago. When he had only been the Winter Soldier.
“I had lost everything when I woke up.” He murmured into her, hugging her as tightly as he could without hurting her. “I just didn’t want to lose anymore.”
Jan side eyed Tony who did the same, both not knowing how to broach the subject of how the pack had now split up.
“It’s called and Infinity Stone and-”
It was the bonding mark on Steve’s neck. It was
“I need to fix this, Tony’s-”
The group of superheros watched as the ships started to turn into rust, and crumbled to pieces as the portal started to close and mend itself quickly, the void of black space being replaced with a sunny blue sky. Even the ships that had fallen to the ground were rotting and disappearing into dust. Soon enough, what was once an alien invasion was now dust in the New York sky. Like it never happened.
Carol would hear what she assumed was Iron Man, Strange flying along with him not too far behind. She turned to greet them. Strange was dressed more casually than Carol thought would ever be allowed on the Avengers. She shrugged it off, he was flying with a red cape on. There was a lot more here going on and Carol knew that. Iron Man was exactly what Carol expected. His suit was smooth and sleek, it impressed Carol. She had seen many types and stages of technology, it was hard to impress her anymore.
Steve would ask Tony about Bucky becoming their second omega and
Steve, “Please,
“Thank you, Thor, really.” Tony said, trying to calm Thor’s hot head down. “But Steve’s not worth your wrath. I’m moving on, even moved to the other side of the country-I’ve got it handled, Big Guy.” Tony said with a genuine smile.
Because he
What Tony was surprised to see was Bucky, sitting as far as possible from Steve and the door as possible. Tony raised an eyebrow at his ex pack.
.” Rhodey pleaded, knowing it was almost useless. Tony and Jan never listened to him. It’s why they get into half the trouble they do.
It was Bucky’s small, wet “
Jan sighed, emotionally preparing to argue with Natasha about Tony. “Look, Romanoff I’ve told Rogers plenty of times to f-” Jan stopped when Natasha held out her hand, in it was a red envelope.
“They can’t know about the stone, or anything else about me other than I am not a threat.” Stephen said quickly and shortly, leaving no room for argument. Jan stayed quiet, throwing a look at Tony even if he couldn’t see her.
The kid had fight.
“I’m gonna clean us up, babe. I’ll be right back.” Steve whispered against Tony’s lips. Tony only gave Steve another kiss in acknowledgement. Steve made his way to the bathroom to wet a cloth and came back out to clean up Tony, who was still buzzing with pleasure.
getting your dick wet with Barnes, Rogers. You have 10 seconds to get out of my sight.” Jan said with even more snarl than before. Jan could see Steve faltering but Steve Rogers was a stubborn bastard.
“I know that. I’m just hoping it states in here why Tony is
.” Steve said in a broken voice, eyes closed as he kept taking in Tony’s scent. Something about it made Steve’s nose twitch. There was something new. It was
It was also convenient as they were under contract to leave the Tower in less than a year. And Natasha has her eye on a pretty property in upstate New York. She left the pitch for the property in Steve’s room. She hoped Steve would follow her advice but at this point he was unpredictable. Only time will tell.
” Tony growled out.
” Steve started, his voice cracking, Natasha flinched at that.
“That was fucking hot, Rogers.” Tony said, settling in against Steve. Steve pulled the blue covers up and kissed Tony’s temple.
The omega had basically ran up to Stephan with wet eyes.

detailed, Nick, I gotta say.”
“What’s your problem?” Bucky asked Clint, Bucky putting his arm on the desk top and resting his chin on his hand. Clint didn’t bother raising his head.
He stood and set his own glass on the porch ledge and went back into his kitchen, taking another glass out and pouring whiskey in. He made his way out to the porch again, holding the glass out as Carol Danvers stood on his porch. She gave him a grin and took the glass.
thought-”
“And no one has stopped him?” Tony asked, a little anger in his voice. Carol raised an eyebrow at the omega.
“He and Carol get along great. Even Thor has taken a shining to him.” Jan said over the sound of the sink running.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony hummed at that. Stephen had been integrating himself well. The alpha was usually stand off and arrogant on the best of days, even back in their youth. But Tony had seen Stephen slowly soften up to the new pa-. To the new
“I’m not saying go make up but you’re going to have to face him again eventually, as team leaders. Just, be careful. They might have signed the divorce papers but your old pack is...stubborn. Just keep your eyes peeled-” Jan hesitated for a second before she quickly threw her eyes to his left hand. They both knew that the gold band was still sitting on Tony’s finger. “And be careful.”
“Heellooo?” Carol sang, hoping to activate whatever Fury had given her. It was a real
He gave Tony a smile and Tony returned it.
Ah, Steve. The subject that had been on Tony’s mind more as his due date became closer and closer. There was no denying that Peter was Steve’s child too, as much as it pain’s the omega to admit it. It also pained Tony to have intimate knowledge of how badly Steve wanted children. When Tony had brought up the possibility of trying for a kid he had never seen Steve’s face lightening up so fast and bright. Not even when they had found Bucky.
How would
“Tony!” The Wasp jerked forward, almost as if to jump in front of Iron Man but War Machine held her back. Carol felt dread fill her not knowing if she managed to save
Tony could hear the muffled voices of someone but it didn’t matter. He was alone and there was an alien tyrant after him. Like death itself was coming after Tony, like it was coming after his pup.
.” Tony breathed out rapidly, saying over and over. Steve only moved fasted, one hand gripping Tony’s hip bone. Steve’s fingers alignment perfectly with the bruises Bucky had left.
“Of course, Dr. Strange!” The girl chirped, running his card through the machine and starting on his coffee order without him telling her what he wanted. He must be a regular.
Steve was suppose to be in bed, and Tony didn’t come all this way to
Tony let what Jan said sync in. “Yeah, we can.” Was all he said.
“You’ve got balls showing up here, I’ll say that much.” The CEO growled as soon as Steve had entered her office. “I’ll give you one warning,
Pepper’s warm hand on his was
Then suddenly, his nose was pressed against a solid mass. It was familiar, comforting. The scent that filled his nostrils was one he knew, long ago. It had helped him through one of the few times he had panicked. Something he hadn’t forgotten. Arms wrapped around him and Tony melted like ice cream in the Arizona desert. This was all too much too fast. Steve, aliens, Thanos, losing a pack, being
, but Bucky wasn’t under his charge, so Tony easily dismissed the other omega’s feelings.
.” Stephen stated. Jan took her hands out of her pockets and rested them on her hips.
I just need to know he’s safe.” Steve pleaded with every ounce of sincerity he had. Jan’s hand lowered slightly but not fully, they were friends. Jan always liked Steve. Jan raised her hand again, her face scrunching up in anger.
And finding Bucky didn’t take that away. Steve’s love for Tony didn’t change the day they found Bucky, no.
The elevator dinged at their floor, Tony took a deep breath. Pepper squeezed his hand and smiled.
“Janet, please.” Steve said, voice shaking slightly. If Jan could bring herself to care she might have noticed his red eyes, pale skin and hard panting. But she didn’t. “I just want to know he’s safe. He-”
with Bucky. They never separated, the alpha and omega didn’t consent to being separated. It had just been a sick fucked up series of events. Steve spending years in the bottom of some ocean, and Bucky being constantly brainwashed against his will only to be stored away like some sort of seasonal jacket by a
“How could I be mad at you? You were
, let’s just talk.” Steve pleaded, knowing he was losing this fight. Steve was letting his beard come in, that was new, Tony noted.
It was a beautiful day in New York, a few thin clouds moved along the sky. The world was a lull, for once. Last night he detected a strong energy force entering Earth’s orbit, so strong it
Tony’s shoulders tensed up. The omega tried to throw a nonchalant look to his friend. “Strange?” He asked as if he didn’t know what Jan was alluding to. They had both known the other for too long to think it was anything else.
JARVIS let her into the house as she dragged her suitcase behind her. She closed the door behind her and stepped further into the house. Footsteps came out of a room and down the hall, Jan stared up the stairs still she saw Tony first, Pepper and Rhodey close behind him.
“I have no doubt you’d be exceptional at it, as you are in everything you do.” Stephen said with a hint of humor in his voice. Jan let out a laugh.
since the omega disappeared off the face of the Earth. Nobody ever brought it up, not even Natasha. Who Bucky would find starting at Steve’s neck sometimes. Her eyes were always so distant when she would finally look away, looking at nothing.
Clint slowly rose up from his position and slumped against his black chair. “But Steve is crazy hot, and Tony is crazy sexy. This is so not fair! I haven’t got laid in, like, a month.” Clint grumbled. Both Natasha and Bucky laughed.
A tall, strong, handsome alpha coming to the omega prince’s tower and rescuing him from his awful prison. Storming the castle on a white horse. It was a concept that kept a child Tony daydreaming. Finding a handsome prince to love and cherish him. Tony thought he found that in Steve, and for a while, he did.
“Missing me already, handsome?” Tony said smugly after the third ring, Bucky huffed out a laugh.
“Strange?” Tony asked, getting more and more tired. He wasn’t super how long they could keep this up.
. Tony put a hand on his stomach.
“You have a coat on, you know where he is.
. To cheat on an omega was a
But now with the progress of defeating Thanos’s, Stephen simply didn’t have the time for regular routine check ups. So he had been vetting potential doctors to help in the meantime and possible with Tony’s birth itself. Both Tony and Stephen had already meticulously planned Tony’s home birth. Tony had set aside a room just for anything medical related. The billionaire had spared no expense and Stephen had not been afraid to lead Tony in the best direction.
“Ooh, what kind of favor?” Tony lightly teased. “Need topless photos? I knew you would, sooner or later.”
and an
Natasha made it all the way to the elevator before Steve had caught up with her.
“Oh, finally!” Tony cheered as he saw his suit flying toward him. The suit’s momentum didn’t even slow down, it attacked itself to the omega smoothly, quickly and efficiently. Once the omega was in the suit, he put out his hand to the alpha. In it was a small metal device. “It’s a com, we might as well be on the same page.”
Maria would be rolling in her grave, indeed.
The debrief with Fury and the media had been a
Steve, stubborn as an ox. He wanted to talk, not only about the attack but about them. Tony just couldn’t do that. They signed the papers, they were over. All Tony needed was to get through his pregnancy and a heat then he’d be free forever. Tony couldn’t do more arguing and crying, it was too much. There were aliens and something called an infinity stone, Stephen Strange showing up and being a
“Then we start shooting back.” Stephen said in that deep voice that Tony remembered from their school days. The same deep voice he found comfort in when his very first heat started.
Natasha didn’t wait for a response. She simply walked past him and out of the gym.
“Perhaps this conversation is better inside, with some refreshments.” Rhodey said from behind them. Knowing it’ll be a long night.
“Wasp!” Rhodey said, now turning his attention to the ships chasing after Tony. The swarm divided in half, one half chasing after the omega and the other headed straight for Stephen.
Rhodey was dressed in an expensive dark red, almost black suit and Pepper was dressed in a black dress with a matching black blazer. It was fitting, it felt as if they were going off to see an execution. In a way, they almost were.
Tony looked at Jan with raised eyebrows and pink on his cheeks. “And what? I forgot my wallet, he happened to be there and he paid for me. Wormhole opened and here we are.” Tony said, keeping it short.
? Jan had never been so offended.
But Tony just looked at her with his teeth clenched.
Thank you for reading and stay safe!!
“Recon for what?” The Wasp asked, looking between War Machine and Carol. Floating around like a fairy.
“God, Bucky, he’s
Steve and Bucky had been sharing kisses in dark corners, Steve whispering in Bucky’s ear at night. Promising of asking Tony about a second omega. It was a rush for both of them, it was fun. Natasha was the first of the pack to catch them.
Natasha didn’t know what she was talking about, Steve was a
.” Tony said with frightening control. “I was yours, that’s how it worked.
“We really should be discussing Thanos.” Carol said from the back of the group. Strange nodded in agreement.
“I’ve got it!” The alpha yelled, his gloved hands shaking at the amount of power needed to close this blasted portal. The ships seemed to have sensed this and turned their attention to Stephen. Even the ships that had surrounded Tony left him alone to head straight for the alpha. This seemed to simply agitate the alpha, Jan would dare the alpha snapped. “
Tony looked at the alpha with bright eyes and smiled.
But then he noticed the bond mark on Steve. If Bucky was honest with himself he didn’t know how he felt about Stark being pregnant. He wasn’t surprised, Steve and Tony had no reason
“Flattery will get you absolutely everywhere, Stephen! See, I like him!” Jan said to Tony. “Steve never truly understood the extent of

. “Guys?”
my talents.”
“Hello? This is a private line? Please identify yourself.” Jan said, sounding just as perplexed as Tony felt. “Jarv? Are we compromised?” Jan asked the AI quickly.
, a proper Alpha. It practically rolled off of Stephen in waves. The kind of alpha that was in all the fairy tale books Maria had read to Tony as a child.
Natasha slammed her heel down on Bucky’s toes and tossed her head back, a loud cracking sound formed as Natasha’s head made contact with Bucky’s nose. The omega dropped the alpha and clutched a hand over his bleeding nose.

No more sitting in Tony’s workshop as what it seemed to Steve blue glittering stars fluttering around as Tony worked, his holograms seemed like

“Sure, Stephen.” She said and gave him a wink. Stephen rolled his eyes at her and fought the small smile he felt creep up on him. “You feeling okay?” Jan asked softly to Tony, rubbing his shoulders.
Rhodey nodded and started tapping on his phone. Pepper squeezed Tony’s arm through the blanket and gave him a smile.
on the alphas face.
“Heellooo?” Someone new said. Tony raised an eyebrow.
Strange never saw Tony like this, always confined to the rules of silence that bind a classroom. Strange liked it, he liked it a lot. Tony was so bright, everything coming out of his mouth sounded like soft bells. Signaling something inside Strange. Strange tried to contribute to the conversation, but every time Tony fluttered his lashes at him Strange found it hard to breathe.
They found Jan in the kitchen with Wong. There were empty mugs of tea and an empty plate of what used to be snacks in front of them. Jan’s face was red as she laughed, tears forming in her eyes. She looked up at Stephen and Tony in the doorway, trying to contain her laughter.
Jan knew this Tony, this fast talking omega. Hitting all of a person's buttons to make them hurt. It was rare when this Tony came out. It was when Tony was backed into a corner, wounded and scared. Not knowing what else to do, so he would create as much chaos as he could hoping to disappear into it to make an escape. Steve looked taken aback, not answering the question.
“Does Stephen know?” Tony asked quietly, afraid of the answer.
“Code Names!” A third voice came through, this one sounded like a guy and older. “Code names on the radio,
” He heard Bucky plea over Natasha’s scream and Natasha
“Tony!” Steve yelled from behind them. Both omegas hurried toward Tony’s workshop. JARVIS closing doors behind them to slow down the alpha that was chasing them.
Steve didn’t stop for a while, just wanting to taste Tony now that he could. He tasted like salt and caramel, and Steve could not get enough of it. Tony let him, loving the tingles he felt every time Steve’s tongue made contact with his skin. After a while Tony pulled at Steve’s hair. Steve opened his eyes and lifted his head up. Tony pulled him into a soft kiss, a hand gently cupping Steve’s jaw. When they broke away, both Tony and Steve smiled. “I’m going to
“Sorry, Iron Man.” Wasp said without sounding all that apologetic.
. He had the pack organized and united, he had their ritual with all of them. Natasha would make him dinner on Fridays, Thor always took Tony out on Mondays, everyone sought Tony out for everything.
“We’re a couple minutes from reaching the wormhole.” Jan said after Rhodey. “What about you?”
“You okay, Buck?” The alpha asked gently, as if he was afraid the omega would break.
“Sometimes. I was just as stubborn.” Tony said with a sip of his tea. It was a blend Thor’s mother had sent along with her son. It had eliminated his morning sickness and helped with sleeping.
is the reaction Tony had hoped for when he saw his first positive pregnancy test. It was supposed to be exciting,
“This doesn’t mean you’re getting out of explaining things to
“I admit I don’t know what you're going through, but I can understand the fear of the unknown. Janet told me your pack was...less than adequate. It is difficult for us to be without a pack, especially a pregnant omega. It’s biology, we are pack animals.” Stephen said, spouting the information he learned as his time as a doctor. He hugged the omega tighter.
.” Was all he said, then all chaos erupted from his pack mates, worry and sadness in their voices and eyes. They fled to him as if afraid he would disappear, as if they could touch the sun. As if to throw themselves down to the omegas feet and beg their savior for forgiveness. Tony held up his hands and no one dared to move closer, to say a word. Tony could tell by the sounds of upstairs that Steve was clueless as ever.
on himself only about an hour ago. There was no rule book on how to handle that specific situation.
“Anything new about the attack or the Strange guy?” Steve asked. Natasha shook her head.
She was a very relaxed alpha, so relaxed that Tony forgot she was an alpha. She screamed more beta than anything. She was just as quick witted as Tony and Tony was elated with finding someone he could verbally spar with. He and Jan just knew each other too well to spar like he spars with Carol.
“Yes. Thanos at the moment has no infinity stones and he won’t for a while. If we want to stop him from coming back and stop him forever- we should go after him while he remains empty handed.” Stephen said so casually.
“Yes, I would like to meet with your group and we can discuss further on how to proceed.” Stephen said, stepping around the omegas and into the kitchen area. Both omegas nodded at him. Jan took her suit jacket from Tony and slipped it on. “I’ll find you.” Stephen said.
“Fuck off.” Natasha growled and picked herself up. Bucky looked at her, then looked her over. Her body was tense, angry. And she was letting it fester. Uncharacteristic of her. Bucky knew why, but given how much of a hard time Natasha had been giving Steve; Bucky had assumed Natasha had dealt with the majority of her feelings about Tony.
Tony shook that thought of his head. It had been a long day.
was funny.
AND I finally went through and fixed all those weird spaces, I hope I got them all. I didn't notice them oof they drove me crazy when I did, tho.
. Tony, his team, his family.
“What the hell is that?” Tony yelled as they ran, pointing at his cape. Strange spared him a look, amusement dancing in his eyes.
Tony was settling well in his Italian home. It was his second trimester and it was frightening how quick 5 months had passed since his return trip from Paris. When Tony looked at his positive pregnancy test he never imagined it would lead to his current situation. He never thought he would ever be without Steve or his pack, it all seemed so cemented into fate.
“It’s Doctor Strange.” Stephen corrected her. Jan slid off the stool she had sat on and shrugged her shoulder.
Luckily, Fury had ultimately agreed with them. The spy didn’t want to spook Stephen and it would be a good trial run for the team. If they failed, the team would be terminated. Jan and Tony knew they wouldn’t fail, of course, so they had agreed to the arrangement much to Tony’s old pack dismay. Probably because they knew there was little chance of the West Coast team failing. Not with Tony and Jan at the helm, they were a dream team together.
Steve wasted no time, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist as he swiftly put Tony on his back. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck as Steve started to
. If Tony let himself get whisked away in those thoughts he would think about how much easier it is to form this pack than his last one. It all seemed to be stitching itself together so seamlessly. On the battlefield they worked together so well for people who were just meeting. He remembered the fight during the New York attack, Steve basically calling him nothing and Natasha agreeing.

is why. Jan ran into her room and dug a designer suitcase from her closet and threw it open. She packed quickly but nearly. She also packed things she would think would comfort Tony, like an MIT sweatshirt she stole from Tony and a couple bottles of wine. She zipped her suitcase up and threw on a long black peacoat jacket and some boots. As she finished gathering her keys and wallet there was a frantic knock on her door.

“I got him back from the dead, Nat. He was dead now he's back and I don’t know what to do.” Steve whispered. “I can’t pick. They’re my omegas.”
“Loads.” Steve said casually, following Bucky. Bucky stopped at the doorway. Tony was asleep on their bed, in one of Bucky’s shirts that barely covered his ass. Bucky turned to Steve and smirked.
Strange
Steve chuckled and peppered Tony with kisses on his face. “Sweet omega, thank you. Jan likes me fine, we’re friends. She’s a good Avenger and a better friend to you, Tony. I think Jan could give me a run for my money when it comes to loving you.”
Natasha told Clint and Sam, the only other pack members currently in the house. All having the same reaction Natasha did but also caving into the same selfishness of wanting to be loved by Tony Stark. They could keep him happy, they would go above and beyond for their omega. He would never be lonely when his alpha went to fuck another omega. He would never want for anything as his alpha gave to another. The pack would devote themselves to Tony.
“Wong was telling me all about the infinity stones, even offered us a book or two to take back to the gang with us.” Jan informed him, her hands never leaving the other omega.

Tony inhaled the scents around him. His eyes did not want to open just yet. It was a deep smokey smell, almost like old books but more pleasant. It brought comfort he hadn’t felt since that day at boarding school. It was so different from Steve’s scent. This scent was smokey, and so deeply ingrained in the omega’s memory. He also caught another scent, one of honey. Tony buried his face deeper into whatever plush thing he was laying on. He hadn’t felt this relaxed in a long time.
Under the Personal Notes section of her file, in Stephen’s own handwriting, was written:
me.” Tony let himself say, falling deeper into his daydreams he tried so desperately not to have.
He, Jan and Pepper had finished the nursery this past week and the West Coast Avengers was running smoothly under Jan’s command. Iron Man had slowly faded out of the spotlight but when needed, Tony would send an empty suit for support and to keep up public appearances. Pepper had advised him it would be best to come out publicly about his divorce once the bond mark was gone. That was if Steve didn’t come out and say anything first. Which seemed unlikely.
The plan was to keep the ships from reaching the level of the city, to shoot them down before they could do anything. Carol was taking the bulk of it, vaporizing the hoards of ships that were coming through the rip. Tony, Jan and Rhodey were taking down the other 20% that were slipping by Carol. The three mostly worked to keep the ships from reaching Stephen, so the sorcerer could have the space and time to close the damn thing.
“And if they start shooting?” Iron Man asked, almost amused.
Bucky had jumped Steve in the gym, feeling bold. Probably because Tony was out of town again. Natasha had walked in looking for Steve but snarled at the sight of Bucky on top of Steve.
Tony’s face grew pink as he simply nodded and followed the alpha without protest. The walk was painfully long, Tony was smelling sweeter and sweeter, meaning more and more alphas were looking their way. Strange glared at every single one of them, Tony was
“I’m not proud I helped you cheat on Tony-” Steve flinched at her words. It was the first time anyone had said it outload to him. “I regret it. Tony obviously doesn’t want us to find him, even with the pregnancy.”

leeway with Fury, even though he did babysit them when they were younger the man had no problem saying no to the omegas. Still, it was more sway over Fury than anyone else had.
“I have to-” Before the genius could finish he knelt over and vomited on the old, red, expensive looking rug. Jan was by his side, whispering comforting things into his ears but the words barely registered. His vision blurred, his ears were filled with a ringing nose. This was too easy, nothing in Tony Stark's life was this easy, nothing. Tony refused to get comfortable with the idea that it would be as easy as the alpha was saying. Tony’s stomach curled violently in itself again and he threw up the rest of his breakfast.
this face, how does he know this guy? This alpha?
This is what Tony was
“1 minute out.” The AI replied.
Carol sat on the couch adjacent to Rhodey, she was currently tackling her mountain of noodles. “I don’t know much, like specifically. There are stories, mostly rumors.” She said as she twisted more noodles around her fork. “They’re powerful energy sources, stones that can’t be destroyed. One of them is the reason I can do this.” Carol said as she raised her hand, a cosmic flame engulfing her hand, and with a flick of her wrist it was gone.
“JARVIS, deploy Iron Wasp!” Jan yelled as she spiraled down faster. “Shit! Tony!” Jan yelled as she watched her friend being chased off by the ships. Jan managed to flipped her body so she was looking down at the city. Her one wing would be able to give her enough control and cushion to not be killed by the fall but it was going to be rough.
“We’re gonna get you in a bath and some food, okay Tony?” Pepper said gently, slowly pulling off Tony’s dress shirt that he had been wearing for the past two days. Tony’s head started to feel light, the smell of Pepper’s skin calming him, pulling him into a lull as he was gently led to the bathroom. Rhodey kissed the top of Tony’s head as he helped him into the tub, the water was hot and Tony felt himself melt.
The small figure grew 10x the small size and into a full fledged person. She was wearing an all black catsuit with yellow accents. Carol would hear the whispering of wings fluttering together rapidly but could barely see the Wasp’s wings. She also had on a sleek helmet that looked a lot like War Machine’s but smaller and less bulky.

Jan looked at her best friend with a smile but sad eyes. She walked around the island and wrapped her arms around Tony.

“Christine?” Stephen asked as if he was caught off guard. “I gave you her file, she’s the best and very trustworthy.” And has a lot to lose if she breaks an NDR but Stephen was confident in his choice.
. Not the type of person to go head on against Thanos’s army. Not because he was omega but because despite his genius he seemed just like anybody else. Carol furrowed her eyebrows. This was just some kid, barely into his early twenties.
There's going to be more pack suffering I promise!! I really hope you guys are liking this fic! Thank you for all the comments!! I read them all, I never reply because I'm so shy and don't want to bother anyone :^)
Which didn’t bother Tony at first, in fact he was actually happy to have such an accomplished omega as his doctor. Stephen was amazing and never belittled Tony in anyway but Tony would simply prefer to have an omega doctor. It was one little line in the file Stephen had given him that made Tony’s hair stand like a cautious cat.
Tony turned around to see Steve in nothing but low hanging grey sweat pants, showing off Steve’s V. His hair and skin werevwet and steam rolled out from the door behind him. God, his pecs looked so much better than Tony imagined. Tony could feel blood rush all over his body, mostly to his cheeks. Steve was looking at him with the biggest, stupid smile that made Tony’s knees weak.
“He’s in distress, he needs to be with his pack.” The doctor said in a more firm voice. Stephen would tell Jan was holding something back. The omega sighed and crossed her arms across her chest.
“Bucky couldn’t make lunch.” Tony said, hoping he was making sense while his brain rebooted. Tony pointed at the bag by the nightstand. “Lunch, because- you know! You’re sick!” Tony supplied, feeling his face growing a deeper shade of red. But Steve still looked at him with that stupid smile. Tony didn’t know if he should leave, he
” Steve growled, sitting up on instinct. Rhodey made a move to get up but Tony stopped him and shot out of his seat.
“‘Tasha-” Steve started, his voice cracking even as he desperately tried to stay calm.
“Eat something, and then we can go to bed. At least till Jan gets here.” She said, offering Tony a fork. Tony wiggled his way out of his warm cocoon and took the fork. Maybe Tony’s world is crumbling down around him, but for now he’s content with takeout in bed.
Jan looked behind Steve and could see her suit coming in fast. “Get people out of here and tell Widow and anyone else we can get in the air, now!” The omega yelled at Steve before taking off on a run, extending her arms out and waiting for her suit to latch onto her.
to try. The thought of a little Steve did warm something deep in Bucky, something that he felt belonged more to the old Bucky than his current self. Bucky never let himself think about it, that part of his life was long over. Dwelling on it would only make for more nightmares.
“It takes time to weave fabrics of space and time but don’t doubt me, Wasp.” The alpha said, he was hovering in front of the portal, a good distance away. His hands were out and embroidered with orange wisps of light. The same wisps that started to hug the edges of the tear. This seemed to have agitated the spaceships because as soon as Stephen’s magic touched the tear the ships began to shoot.
to you, Rogers. Don’t make the mistake of thinking we’re friends.” Pepper said coldly, never once bothering to look at Bucky and Natasha. Steve signed and ran a hand through his hair.
“I’m not leaving without him.”
But she couldn’t deny he was also slowing her down. If Bucky wanted to stay with a man who was in love with another, that was his decision. Natasha thought it was a stupid one, but happy for Bucky to be choosing. A concept that HYDRA had robbed both of them for a very long time.
Tony’s vision went white, as if everything in existence had disappeared for just a few seconds. Tony’s whole body tensed, before becoming completely relaxed. Tony vaguely heard Steve groan as he came but he felt Steve’s hot cum fill him. The feeling of Steve made Tony shiver in pleasure as a smile crept on his face. Once Steve rode out his orgaism he slowly pulled of Tony.
something. Maria Stark was the highest social elite there ever was, adored by all and who’s glamour and poise was so desperately copied. Maria taught Tony all he needed to know to survive in this world as an omega.
Tony turned at her shock and tried to rebuttal any of what Carol had just said but instead he ended up gaping his mouth open and closed like a fish out of water. The omega felt his face warm, he could picture the red appearing on his cheeks.
“Strange!” Jan said in surprise. “Hey! Um-”
He just started showing up. The omega would turn around the alpha would be there with a blanket, silently asking to at least take a nap after a “Eureka Moment” as Jan called them. Stephen had insisted it was because he was a doctor and that all of his actions were sound medical practices to help and benefit expecting omegas.
Tony’s gut dropped at the name of his ex-husband. The omega never thought he would ever call Steve that, but he never thought Steve would cheat on him either. Tony knew Steve wanted to talk, he was the most stubborn man alive. A part of Tony wanted to hear him out, on lonely nights he wished he still had his alpha to cuddle with. Tony didn’t realize how cold it could get, so used to Steve being his personal heater. He missed the morning kisses, having breakfast after Steve’s runs. Tony missed domestic life, he missed his marriage.
Carol rolled her eyes up and stared at the ceiling before she squeezed her eyes shut. Her forward wrinkled in deep thought. After a minute of silence she let out a sigh and leaned forward again.
This wasn’t her ‘
“I just need 10 minutes, Pepper-”
“Who?” Jan asked, sitting on Tony’s side. A hand found the other omega’s and squeezed. Mostly to comfort herself.
“Family drama.” Bruce said with a shrug when he and Jan were done hugging.
“I came back because I peed on a stupid stick it was positive. And I came back to find my stupid alpha fucking his long lost stupid love and my stupid pack completely complicit in it as well.” Tony said evenly but he looked down at his hands, Pepper was right, he was shaking. Pepper looked at him, with an almost blank look on her face, as if waiting for a
Tony felt tears form in his eyes and spill over. His hands shook as they found Jan’s own hands. “Steve?” The omega whimpered out. This was too much, too much danger for his pup. Where was his alpha, his husband? Where was his pack? Why was he alone?
“And go against my alpha? I am loyal to
his friendship with Tony, he liked his jokes and secret smirks. He liked being the one Tony looked at when one of their classmates said something useful. Tony was snarky. Now, the omega wouldn’t so much as
“He needs rest, and alpha pheromones help distress. I’ll put him in my room.” Where his scent would be strongest. Jan opened her mouth to object. “Trust me, Van Dyne. I won’t-” What? Fall in love with the omega? “-hurt him in anyway.” The man promised.
By the time Steve came back from throwing the rag in the hamper, Tony was a little more coherent. Tony made grabby hands, Steve smiled as he slide in next to Tony who buried his head against Steve’s bare chest.

good. Tony could see Steve smiling as he bobbed his head, his arms keeping Tony’s hips flat on the bed. No matter how hard Tony tried to move them. Even as Tony could felt the back of Steve’s throat, Steve kept him grounded.
“You caught us and said nothing to Stark.” The omega growled back, only succeeding and angering the Black Widow more. “You had the option-”
“You have my congratulations, Ms. Van Dyne.” The A.I responded as they passed the 15th floor. Jan let out sigh as she flipped her hair back, fixing the strap of her matching purse. It had slid down on her walk in the elevator.
Jan knew it was a dismissal

Steve took in a deep breath and slowly let it out like this therapist had shown him.
“You and James are fucking.” Natasha spat out between clenched teeth. “That means I kill you and get Tony the hell out of here.”
“Natalia,
Steve stood there as he heard the car leave. The elevator doors closed and were left with nothing but the binder. Steve saw wet drops fall on the front binder. Not registering that they were his.
to Tony. Tony would never admit it to anyone, not even himself; but the omega needed an alpha’s support as he tried to recover from Steve. Tony could feel himself develop feelings for the alpha. Tony was also doing everything he could to smother those feelings. It wasn’t the time, and fair to neither alpha nor omega.
“This is about Stark, isn’t it?” Bucky called her out. Natasha threw him a sharp look and he knew this would be his one and only warning from her. To stay off this topic, ‘
He took it from her hands and read the title. His eyes shot up and looked at Jan who tried to give him a genuine smile but was sure it came across cold.
“Steve cheated on Tony with Barnes. Natasha, Clint and Sam knew. We are unsure about Thor and Banner seeing as they’ve been off planet for months now.” She said as if it was a debriefing. In a sense it was.
what the alpha was nervous to ask about.
After the training session, Tony kissed Bucky’s cheek and left the building with a pep in his step. Bucky watched from the counter as Tony left, a smile on his face. Clint groaned and rested his head on the desk, Natasha next to him, laughing.
Tony breathed in the Italian countryside. Miles and miles of tall grass with the cost barely in view in the horizon. The house was everything Tony wanted. It was more of a manor. The manor was two stories and was in the shape of a U. The courtyard was made of sun bleached bricks which eventually faded into the grass and the grounds that led into the gardens. It was old, and needed some work but Tony knew exactly what he wanted to do with his new sanctuary.
It started like most mornings with Bucky. Bucky would also initiate the intimacy.
“Someone who’s attention you caught.” Carol said, sitting back in her seat.
in Russian. The blood rushing back into Steve's ear, everything sounded muffled.
“-is trying to move on after catching his alpha fucked him over.” Pepper came close to yelling, Bucky wondered if the desk wasn’t between the two, if Pepper would have her hands wrapped around Steve’s throat already. “Steve, you have no right or business contacting Tony. And if I so much as suspect you of trying to, I will take you and every single one of your maggots to court and drag you through the pits of American bureaucracy hell until there is nothing left.”
“Anthony.” Stephen’s deep voice pierced through the omegas foggy thoughts. Tony looked at the general direction where Stephen was in the dark. “Are you alight?” He asked.
Jan looked at her phone in disbelief. Natasha called her and now
it’s too soon. I signed my
.” Tony word vomited everything to the older boy, shaking in fear. “I feel like I have a fever and-” Tony looked at Stephen in the eyes before looking away again. “I don’t know who else to ask.”
Tony held up his mug of tea against his lips. He was currently at the kitchen island with a tablet in hand. He looked down at it and mused. On the glass screen was a world map of statistics of every country, population numbers mostly. The omega was picking a remote location to disappear to. A hand had his way down to his small bump. Tony gently rubbed the skin through his worn band t-shirt.
Tony willed his thoughts away, now wasn’t the time for introspection. The two men turned a street corner and could see a trail of light heading toward the cluster of ships. Stephen stopped and continued to look up. Tony stopped to give the alpha a questioning look.
Heat spiked up the omega’s spine at the alpha’s words. Stephen was worried about him, his safety.
Fury seemed satisfied with Jan’s answer. He leaned forward and gathered the files and pulled them closer to him. He opened the first one. Jan rolled her eyes again and this time harder, it was a clear dismissal. The omega had no idea why the alpha insists on playing cool all the time, especially when he
Carol looked up from the file and out the window to see what Fury was mad about now. Carol barely felt any surprise as she saw a wormhole open up to see aliens coming through. This was a regular Tuesday for her. Carol looked over at Fury who sighed and leaned back in his seat. Carol smirked and held out an empty hand. Fury looked at the hand, offended that someone could read him so well.
have a wonderful week ya'll and stay safe!! xoxo
. No, there was no irrational huffing under the omega’s skin. And there certainly weren’t pregnancy hormones running rampage bringing Tony to tears when he did read that line in his office. And there was absolutely no urging from his omega brain to keep Stephen far far away from her as she was a threat to his pack. Just like Bucky had been.
, we can blackmail later.” He said to his fellow omega, not wanting their attention to stray too far from the immediate threat. Because Tony had
The rough draft of a contract Pepper had drawn up basically saying Steve and his pack failed Tony and had a year to move out of the house and off the property. Tony imagined as soon as they left, he'd have the house burned and turned into something else, something useful.
. Tony bit his lip and silently thanked God for his blessed life.
Steve’s head whipped around at the sound of the door opening, eyes watering at the sight of Tony. Steve looked rough. More rough that Tony had ever seen him. His whole pack did. Pale, Natasha and Clint had both lost weight, Tony could tell.
Tony let his head fall back against the tub and closed his eyes, his mind slowing down. He could hear a muffled version of Pepper and Rhodey’s conversation, discussing what they should eat and how Pepper was going to get the place furnished in the next couple of days. Tony didn’t know how long they had been in the tub, the next thing he knew he was in new clothes and in a bed sandwich between Pepper and Rhodey.
Stephen looked at Tony who was smiling wide seeing his old friend.
“But my happiness was never a factor.” Tony said, sliding a pen toward Steve. “Or you would have never-” Tony let out a wet croak, he couldn’t say it. He looked at the people on the other side of the table.
Tony’s heart began to race. A flutter formed in the omega, it was like there was a swarm of butterflies in his chest. Tony could feel the blood rush to his cheeks in anticipation for what, what did Tony anticipate? Or was he hoping for something from the alpha?
. He had been plaguing Tony’s dreams since New York. Thanos was what Tony looked over his shoulder for, the reason he built suit after suit after suit. Until he had his own personal army of suits just in case and here Stephen was talking about just taking the alien out as if it was nothing more than a pest problem. So confident and arrogant.
Love reading your guys comments :)
Eventually Steve took pity on Tony and withdrew his fingers. Tony moaned in protest and lifted his head to turn to glare at Steve. Steve huffed a laugh, Tony looked like an angry kitten. Steve stretched to reach the nightstand and grabbed a bottle of lube. It wasn’t butterscotch, but it was watermelon. Steve’s second favorite. Tony moved faster than Steve would have expected him to. Tony grabbed Steve by his arms and pulled him onto the bed. Tony straddled him with a determined look on his face, shoving Steve’s sweatpants off as if they had personally offended him. When Steve’s dick popped up, Tony’s eyes filled with hunger. Tony grabbed the lube out of Steve’s hands and opened it, pouring a small amount in his hands.
ringed throughout the whole office. “We have some good leads and the name of Thanos’s daughters. Thor is already out looking and Danvers is setting up for another scouting mission. She should be off planet soon.”
. Stephen smiled.
“Iron Man is the priority!” Jan yelled into her com,
“Me?” Bucky dared asked.
“It’s ginger tea.” Was all the alpha said. Tony took it without saying a word, blowing on the tea before taking a sip. It was good, which was unusual because Tony usually hated tea.
” Tony’s words turned to mush as Steve added a second finger. Steve lifted his head so he could watch his fingers work in and out of Tony. Steve’s pointer finger and pinky moved Tony’s cheeks up and down, making his ass bounce as the two fingers between them dug out pleasure from Tony. Steve made a hungry
“Tony Stark is horny for Stephen Strange.” Jan said with too much pride in her smile. “You see him as a potential mate.”
“And you know, between you and me-” Jan said as she brought her hoard back to the cutting board. “The West Avengers seem to be headed toward pack direction.”
and wrapped around his shoulders. It morphed into a long red cape. Tony didn’t know how to react, what to say. The omega had seen a lot in his lifetime, but this was different.
.” Tony asked with venom in his voice, causing his ex pack to flinch. The metaphorical other shoe had just dropped. “What’s your reasoning? Was Barnes going to lose his mind again and go on a murder rampage until Steve fucked him? Was sticking your cock in Bucky gonna bring his memories back,
Jan looked down at the unsealed envelope. She carefully opened it and took out the white piece of parchment. It was thick paper, expensive.
from his mind.
Stephen looked at Jan and gave her a half smile. “It’s...definitely progress.” Was all he said. Jan jumped and fist pumped the air.
This, of course, infuriated Steve Rogers. The alpha had always hated being kept in the dark. Steve was being more tolerable about it now then in the beginning but the look on Jan’s face said he was still at it. Asking about
he’s fond of us.” Jan said with a laugh.
Jan walked behind Tony and looked down at what was on display. Jan hummed in acknowledgement. There was a red circle on the coast of Italy. Tony looked at Jan, the two omegas having a silent conversation.

“I retired from surgery.” Strange said, Tony perking up at the words. He had questions. “Now I’m just…” Strange trailed off, what was he doing? Fighting off magical forces, so ancient that not even the rocks believe them to be real.
Strange respected that.
Steve felt himself harder, faster. Bucky was tightening around his cock and
of things. Things he did in the war, how he let Bucky fall, what he was doing to Tony now. So now Steve has taken to punishing himself. Maybe it was the Catholic in him. Steve’s therapist would also say he has control issues, having gone through great trauma that was out of his control that now when Steve has control he’d rather die than lose it.
But he was in bed with Bucky, it still didn’t feel real. When Steve really lost himself with Bucky he forgot he was anywhere but the filthy, tiny Brooklyn apartment Steve and Bucky had managed to rent.
goodbye,
“Captain Marvel is correct.” Strange’s voice came through, he sounded the oldest of all of them. Carol held off her own offensive plans and waited. “I do not sense sentient life. These ships are empty.”
Bucky let out what sounded like a sorrowful whine.
“Strange, can you get this portal shut?” Jan asked as she whizzed around in the sky. Her stingers were on the highest power level, leaving holes in the spaceships she shot at.
Jan nodded, wrapping an arm around Tony's shoulder and led him downstairs. Rhodey and Pepper were at the kitchen island, where most of the sunlight seeped through in the house. Pepper was on the phone with his computer in front of her while Rhodey was looking through paperwork.
Steve grabbed at Bucky’s hips and pulled Bucky back to get even deeper in the omega. Bucky let out a moan and started moving his hips instinctively. They fell into a rhythm, Steve thrusting in and out while Bucky moved his hips to meet Steve’s. Steve fell back to that tiny bed, feeling what warmth he could get through the tiny window in their bedroom; the sun heating up his right shoulder.
The omega turned to see Steve, in his full gear. Behind him followed Bucky and Sam. His most loyal.
“But to where? Steve knows about all the properties.” Pepper said, angry at that notion.
He deserved this. He deserved to die.
Nick thought.
“Well, futures, versions of what could be. Nothing is guaranteed, but I have a general idea of what is going to happen.”
“What the hell was that?” Tony was the first to ask, his voice small and soft. He was still in the air, struggling a little to balance but it was enough to bring him closer to Jan and Stephen.
.” Tony whimpered, his breath leaving him and ecstasy filling in it’s place. “Fuck me, Steve, please.” Tony begged. Desperate
“S-sure!” Tony said in surprise.
“Pepper-” Natasha tried but Pepper didn’t bother to acknowledge it.
Jan yelled with a smirk. Tony felt his face heat up as the blood rushed to his cheeks. Damn it, Jan always knew how to lull him into a false sense of security.
something.
“I’m part of a Space wide known alliance. I’ve dealt with a lot of alien diplomacy, let me see if I can talk with these guys.” Carol said, slowing her approach as she got closer to the cluster of flying spacecrafts.
Bucky had started with kissing Steve’s neck and chin before going for the lips. Steve would also kiss back, feeling something warm in him. It was never as warm or intense as when Tony was on top of him, but Steve pushed that feeling aside.
Out one million and a pack.
“It’s
“Why?”
“Clint thinks it’s unfair that you get both Steve
“We mustn't let the wolves see us bleed.” Was all she said, booping the end of Tony’s nose. It wasn’t until Steve came back with Bucky did Tony finally understand what his mother meant, what all her nuggets of wisdom meant.
.” Tony let out a whine and just started crying again, as if he hadn’t been crying for hours already.
, not sad. Not something to be pitied. Jan threw herself on Tony again and hugged him so tightly Tony wouldn’t breathe.
“So,” Jan said as she lowered her arm full onto the counter top. “
-” Jan stopped as Tony stormed his way in with Rhodey and Pepper at his heels. Tony’s face was red and shaking with anger. Jan looked behind the three to see Steve striding his way to the elevator.
“What the hell is going on?” Steve asked, looking up at the fight above them.
He was no longer the young 15 year old he had been when Strange first met him. Tony Stark had created a buzz before he even got to the school. Strange had heard chatter
He liked Tony, the omega was kinder to him then he had any right to be. He had helped Bucky break from HYDRA’s mind control and given him a home. Gave him a pack and Bucky had pissed all over it because he couldn’t let go of Steve. The sad part, the Steve he couldn’t let go of wasn’t the Steve that had greeted him in the hospital after they had saved him from HYDRA. Of course it had been a different Steve.
“Carol.” Stephen said, not yet activating his com. Mostly to himself. He didn’t think what he detected would have a name let alone be a person. This was interesting. The alpha looked at Tony in his suit. “Want to see me fly?” Stephen asked, even in the middle of an alien invasion, he wanted to show off to the omega.
do. Only what he wanted. He never wanted to see Steve or his pack again, he wanted to have his baby around a family he trusts. People that love him. Tony thought his friend's suggestions over. It worked, it really worked. All he needed was divorce papers and he could start a new life. He could start again. Tony rubbed his stomach.
“God, I’m sorry, Stephe-Strange.” Tony said in the most normal voice he could muster, even if some words wobbled in his throat. “It’s just, Thanos has been in my nightmares for years, and now we’re talking about taking him out like it’s nothing. And with the bab-” Tony held back his words but Stephen was a smart enough alpha to know how that sentence was going to finish. A hand touched Tony’s shoulder and brought him into the alpha’s chest. The cloak wrapped itself tighter against Tony.
Peppers face slowly changed as the silence continued, no joke from Tony, her eyes dark with

“Thor?” Jan asked, surprised as she sipped on a cold glass of ice tea. “We haven’t seen him in  years. We have no idea where he is or how to contact him.” She stated, worried and perplexed. Stephen looked at her with a smile.
“If Fury knows anything, he didn’t tell me.” She reported, Steve’s shoulders sagged even more. Natasha wanted to scream, she didn’t like this. She needed momentum, but Steve was simply dead in his tracks without Tony. Steve’s world had come to a complete stop and nothing else mattered but getting the chance to see Tony again. Those odds were slim to none so why did Steve insist on being so damn
circumstances.”
She shook her head. “It’s not forever, Steve. I need time to answer questions I have for myself. To find a sense of peace with what I did.” She said softly. She opened her arms and Steve almost collapsed in her grasp.
Tony’s back began to curve, the pleasure becoming too much. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve, urging him to go faster.
“Yeah, maybe I should sleep more.” Tony joked. He looked at Wong then at Stephen. “Sorry I vomited on your rug. I can pay for it to be cleaned.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Every word was breaking Steve all over again, she could see it. But it felt good to say, to face reality. Even if it gutted Steve, she needed to say it. Steve needed to hear it. It was the first step to everything.
This was it. No more Christmas where Tony and Jan get horribly drunk on eggnog. Where they’d make Steve let them sit on his biceps, where they’d sing Christmas carols horribly off key. Making Steve pose like those cheesy 40’s muscle show posters, where an alpha had two girls sitting on his arms as he posed with his arms up to show off his strength. Steve’s super soldier strength was always fun, being able to carry the omegas around with it feeling like he was holding a couple of grapes.
“Tony, please listen to me. Breaking a bond is-”
“Tony’s coming along fine, he’s past the halfway mark. I think Strange is bringing a doctor he trusts to Tony. Check on Peanut’s progress, and all. Strange’s been busy as of late.”
-” Tony choked at that. Rhodey and Pepper looked at each other, Tony didn’t talk about his parents much. “She gave me something, as a
“All I hear is talk, Steve. Are you sure-” Tony let out a low moan as Steve’s lips wrapped around the top of Tony’s cock. Tony’s body felt on fire, Steve’s mouth felt so fucking good, it made Tony’s brain melt. Steve worked his tongue around the tip before taking Tony in deeper. Tony twitched and moaned, grabbing Steve’s hair and pulling for no reason other than the pleasure was just
“You’re a selfish man, Steve Rogers.” Natasha snarled. “Both of you, under his roof. He welcomed you, James.” Natasha spoke to Bucky directly.

from Jan as she cracked open two eggs and put them on the sizzling butter.
As soon as Carol slowed her flying to a full stop a couple feet in front of the ship on the outside point of the cluster. The ships looked like a stereotypical flying saucer, which made Carol laugh inside. In all her years of space adventures, not one real alien race had ships that looked like Frisbee. Carol opened her mouth to introduce herself and this world, but the ship she was in front of dropped a blaster from their ship and fired a shot directly at Carol. No hesitation.
legal team.
Whatever the sorcerer was doing, it seemed to scare the ships. They’re once homogeneous movement became erratic, almost like panic. Stephen continued to move his hands as whatever he was manipulating seemed to attach itself to the ships and the tear in the sky, highlighting them in green. Jan could hear what sounded like gibberish Stephen was speaking in the coms, but Jan could recognize a dead language when she heard one.
“Wasp!” Tony scolded. “Aliens
“That’s your grand ‘Get Your Man’ plan?” Carol asked, crossing her arms against her chest. Before Tony could explain Stephen wasn’t his Carol rustled his hair and brought him closer with one arm. “A terrible plan, but given your PH.D In
“Moving Stark Industries main office to or near Silicon Valley would make sense, technology capital of the world.” Pepper added as she hung up her phone.
“I think technically it would be supper.” Tony deflected as he accepted the invitation for food. Peter was always a hungry little bastard. Luckily for Tony neither Stephen or Jan pushed him for more. Jan simply held out both her hands to help Tony up from his chair. There was no longer mistaking that Tony wasn’t pregnant. Peter was growing bigger and bigger every month.

.” Tony agreed as he listened to the consistent chopping of Jan, it was almost hypnotizing. Thinking about Stephen and forming a pack with him always entranced Tony in his feelings. It was hard not to go full omega. He felt safe and loved, added with his pregnancy his hormones were going wild. Wild for stability, love and a very handsome alpha.
’?” Tony asked his friend. He could just see Jan roll her eyes at him.
Tony felt like he was going to jump out of his skin. He felt hot, suffocated, like everything was too much. Everything sounded muffled, it sounded like someone was talking to someone else but Tony couldn’t make out what they were saying. The New York streets were busy, everyone on the street just going on with their day. Just weaving their way through the crowd. Tony looked at the crowd longingly. He felt like it was too small in here, he just wanted to be free. He wanted to be lost in a crowd of millions and forget what was happening. To just slow down, even for a minute.
is just want Tony needed, new stimuli, a
“I don’t want Steve as my alpha.” Jan explained quietly. She wouldn’t tell him how she didn’t trust his pack mate much either, Natasha’s report to Fury had started a burning anger inside Jan. Even when Natasha apologized and retracted the statement, Jan never forgot.
“Oh, I can hold my own fine.” Carol said, not taking her eyes off the ships. “Just, be careful. Something about this seem,

“I also took the liberty of securing the lab as soon as we left, Sir.” JARVIS said as calm as ever. Tony smiled up at the ceiling.

Surely that will wash away their sins. Surely it’s enough. Everyone gets what they want, right?
As she made her way to California she thought back to Maria Stark. Jan laughed and shook her head. She looked out the window to see a starry clear night.

The alpha nodded and moved his hands to form a circle. An orange spark appeared before a portal opened, the other side of it looked like a bedroom.
It was over. It was just
“I’ll even race you.” Tony replied, his repulser's coming to life and lifting him off the ground.
“Jan, before you make any assumptions-” Tony tried to backtrack but Jan had already cemented her victory.
“Act as normal as possible while putting out feelers for the daughters.” Stephen said with conviction. The former doctor’s eyes looked down at Tony, a soft light in them. “Relax until we find a suitable lead.” The group looked around, eyes scanning the others for any better ideas against an overpowered mad space titan.
on him to call him Nick. What are you, a super secret experiment the government finally let free?”
“I’m - I - Jan-” Tony mumbled out of the words. His head was beginning to spin.
Stephen wrapped his arms around the omega. A panic attack, exhaustion and probably dehydration. Classic signs of a distressed omega. His cloak wrapped itself around the omega, bringing him tighter against Stephen’s chest. Tony went slump against him, his eyes closed and his hands holding on tight to Stephen’s blue robes.
type of method with Fury. Most people found it annoying but Carol found it fun.

Being back in New York after the California countryside made Tony want to scrub his skin clean, the air here was terrible. But he was here to get his divorce and immediately return to his small paradise. It had only been three weeks since Tony left and he hadn’t spoken a single word to his ex pack, what was there to say? Pepper, Rhodey and Tony entered the elevator of Stark Tower and headed up to the conference floor.
“Okay so when did Strange become a wizard.” Jan said, her voice calm but Carol could pick out a confused and relief in her tone.

“I was your

If Steve wasn’t throwing himself in SHIELD work he was hounding  whoever he could to get some sort of line of connection with Tony. Bucky could see how wild it drove Steve that he couldn’t get any answers about Tony from anyone. Especially after the alien invasion. The short debrief the West Coasters had given him and SHIELD was not good enough.
“Do they even know about this?” Nick asked, leaning back in his seat. His hands referring to the binder, his one eye almost had amusement in it.
Maria would be rolling in her grave right now
“We need the divorce papers first.” Tony said, looking all three of them in the eye. Jan jumped in victory as she assembled the bagel sandwiches, putting a slice of cheese on the egg before putting on the top bagel slice. She plated them and filled a glass up with milk. She slid the plate and milk in front of Tony before turning to clean up her mess in the kitchen.
Tony raised his hand in signal to stop Steve, who surprisingly enough did stop. Tony slid the thick contract Pepper had drawn up to Steve, looking Steve directly in the eyes.
Tony pushed his sadness aside as he worked on an upgrade for Jan’s stingers. He was sitting outside on the back porch of the cottage. The warm air felt nice on his skin, it was nice to get outside and feel. Feel like a person again. Tony swiped his current project to the side for another to slide in its place. It was a new house design for his Malibu home. He had been particularly motivated to draw up schematics for a nursery room, taking lots of Jan’s advice.
The alpha’s heart broke. Strange knew Tony was describing the onset of a preheat. But instead of being in a familiar place with people he trusted to take care of him. Tony was at some boarding school filled with leeches and
“What’s she doing now?” Fury asked, not bothering to touch the files.
Jan turned to Stephen who was still smiling. She glared at him.
omg I hope you guys enjoy the chapter! This has been super fun to write thank you all for being so supportive <3 <3 <3
“And the one Strange had?” Rhodey asked, gathering more rice on his fork. Carol looked at him and shrugged.
“You look so good on my cock, sweetheart. You feel so fucking good.” Steve moaned, his hands urging Tony’s hips to move faster. Tony could feel the sweat on his own skin and Steve’s as he kept working his hips. Watching Steve’s lips move with pleasure, let out deep moans and talking so sweet that Steve’s mere whispers caused Tony to tremble.
The property his mother had picked out for his Get Away House was spectacular, Tony was not surprised. It was out in the middle of nowhere California, nestled in the mountains with beautiful fields surrounding the gated house. It was modest for Maria, which wasn’t modest at all. It was an old stone building that seemed to be a cottage, it was two stories and well maintained over the years. Rhodey pulled the car up to the driveway as the gate opened up for them. Tony had JARVIS installed long ago simply to monitor the house for things like fires, or flooding.
“If someone compromised JARVIS do you really think they’d just say ‘
“Anthony.” A deep voice gently coaxed his way into his ear. Tony barely opened his eyes. It was dark, he could barely see the outline of anything. Tony felt whatever he was laying on dip, the source of the scent was coming closer. “Anthony?” The voice asked again.

“Not any less valid.” Carol interrupted. Tony rolled his eyes.
“Me?” The omega asked, his eyes a little more wide. His friends became more tense at her words.
“I know you’re studying to be a doctor and everything
“How do you feel about joining the Avengers Initiative?” He asked, it was only fitting. She was the beginning spark of this wild forest fire that was the Avengers Initiative. Carol looked at him, her eyes wide and eyebrows touching her hairline in shock and amazement. She let out a loud laugh and spilled her drink a little.

“JARVIS how long till the suits here.” Jan asked.
“He’s safe.” Was all she said about Tony. Steve let out a breath neither he or Jan knew he was holding. “Now go away and never come near me or Tony again or next time-” Jan said, lowering her hand, turning toward her house.
“Are you okay?” Iron Man asked. “War Machine and Wasp are a minute from your location. Strange and I are only a couple minutes behind. Think you can hold up till then?” Iron Man asked, not in a playful tone like it had been earlier.
“Nat, please, please let me explain.” Steve pleaded as Natasha slid to the floor, the wind knocked out of her.
“Stark.” Strange said gently with a nod. Tony looked at the slice and coffee and took it.
Haunted with memories of what was and questions of what could have been. She needed to get out, she needed to reevaluate herself. And she needed space for that, space that she couldn’t get here. Steve and his stubbornness to move on was becoming suffocating and she was starting to hate him for it.
“Carol, can you see anything on the other side? Is there anything, I don’t know, sending these things though?” Jan asked as she shot down another two ships. “Something we can stop?”
” Tony asked, the words fumbled out of his mouth. Stephen was talking about time travel or visions like they were real? Time travel was still a theory in science and here was this alpha casually saying he saw into the future.
“I don’t have one.” Fury deadpanned. Carol put the communication device in her ear and then her body suddenly lit up like the Fourth of July. Bright, cosmic colors. She looked at Nick and gave him a wink before shooting up into the sky, flying straight toward the wormhole.
Strange didn’t know how to feel about how his heart jumped at seeing Tony Stark standing in the coffee shop.
” Wasp shrieked again.
And of course Tony was everything Maria taught him to be. A wonderful host and an even better wife. Tony did everything
He could do this, for his kid. For himself.
“A second omega is not uncommon for packs our size.” Steve said, not thinking at all.
Steve felt tears form in his eyes. He had known Nat since he got out of the ice, she was the first friend he ever made out of the ice. She introduced him to Tony. She was always calm, collected, never snapped. Now, she was wild in the eyes. Tears on her cheeks as she kicked her legs in the air to get out of the omega’s hold. And this was his fault. Natasha broke because of him, the pack Alpha.
Natasha was excited. She had a safe house in the countryside of France. It reminded her of the farm she had grown up in Russia when she was a little girl. One of the few memories she had before the Red Room. Though before she left for her hide out, she had a letter to deliver. She could only hope it would reach its intended destination.
It bothered Steve, Bucky could tell. Always so rigid around the other alpha despite the two never exchanging a single word. The most they got out of the other group were “everything is under control.” from Carol and “Fury is in the loop, trust him if not us.” from Jan. It was enough for Bucky but not for the rest of the pack.
“He’s powerful, and his minions are just as powerful. We’ve been gathering intel, he has two rogue daughters. We were trying to find them to see if they could help us find a weak spot. But they disappeared. Not surprised, people who defect from Thanos usually don’t live too long after.”
“How ya feeling, hon?” Jan asked. Tony shrugged.
, yell, yell until his voice became nothing. To scream and yell and cry, but
” Tony laughed, remembering being
“Can you believe, Jarv? West Coast Avengers!” Jan sang to the A.I. “I already have new Avengers gear planned out. Functional and chic!”
“And just about the hottest thing ever.” Bucky said. Steve nodded in agreement. “And he’s
? Why were they sad? They had no right, they did this. Tony was the bystander. Shot in cold blood by his own pack.
Jan smiled and kissed Tony’s forehead. The hand Jan had on Tony’s arm squeezed Tony’s arm. The two omegas having a silent telepathic conversation, Pepper and Rhodey were sure of. Jan’s smile turned into a grin as she let go of Tony and danced her way to her suitcase. She opened it and dug through it, throwing silk scarves behind her as she dug. Tony laughed at his friend's antics.
“I do not trust Steve Rogers and refuse to serve under someone I don’t trust.” Rhodey said, getting an
“Cool. Should be fun, right Stephen?” Carol asked the wizard who looked a little startled. The wizard narrowed his eyes at Carol, who only smiled more at him. “It’s world’s colliding! That has to be exciting.”
Stay safe ya'll! xoxox
. If only Howard could see how Steve was treating his son. Steve forced himself not to think about it, not needing to crumble under his already enormous weight of guilt. Not here.
“I’m going to make you feel
“I just don’t know what to do next. Do I tell Steve about Peanut? Do I get him on the weekdays and Steve gets weekends? I don’t want to even look at Steve but-” Tony could feel his voice shake and tears in the corner of his eyes.
“Maybe later, sweetheart. I was actually wondering if you could take some lunch to Steve.” Bucky said. “Some stuff came up to at work and I can’t get out of it.”
. Sweet, sweet, coffee that could warm Tony's soul.
Carol let out a laugh, a sparkle in her eyes that had not been there before. She nodded in their direction. “You guys are the captains.” She said, picking her plate back up. “Let me know how it goes.”
“I thought this whole thing was done by our own hands?” Bucky challenged, remembering the sharp words she had thrown at Steve. Natasha’s mask cracked and rage flickered in her eyes.
“So, what about you?” Tony asked, halfway done with his slice. “What’ve you been up to?” Tony asked.
He was suppose to take lunch to Steve and see if he was doing okay. That wasn’t going to happen. Bucky put his hand to his temples, thinking this all through. All of their friends worked at SHIELD, so they couldn’t run a meal to Steve. Bucky took out his phone from his gym bag.
See the thing is, Steve never stopped loving Bucky. Yes, he had accepted his omega was gone but he never stopped loving Bucky. And here he was, in front of Steve. Steve came back to his body when he realized he was on top of Bucky, kissing the absolute life out of him. The kind of kiss you give someone when they come back from the dead.
Sam came out from the basket ball court, a look of resentment on his face. “Some group of dudes got into a fight, drew some blood and someone broke a nose.” He said, pointing his thumb behind him, indicating where the incident took place. Bucky took in a deep breath and exhaled in annoyance. Blood drawn and broken bones meant they had to legally file a report, and since Bucky was the highest ranking employee, it meant he had to be there for the whole process. He had to file his own paperwork, give a statement. It was going to take hours.
“It’s
Tony sat right next to Strange in the very back. And that’s how their small friendship started. Strange would insult his classmates under his breath whenever one of them asked a stupid question. And Tony would shoot him a look of amusement, trying not to get caught laughing by their professor.
They all had their sins and there wasn’t much to do but try to amend them to repent until cleansed. That wouldn’t happen until they took responsibility. Natasha had little hope for Steve and little hope of the pack staying together. It was a thought that made her cry in the privacy of her room at night but now was not the time for tears.
couldn’t hide her surprise. On any other day Tony would have taken that as a victory, but today it's just
After that, Jan glared at everybody but Strange when their class was over. She gave him a small smile of acknowledgement before whisking Tony away. Strange acknowledged the deep purr he felt as he had gotten Tony’s protective friend approval before brushing it off. Now wasn’t the right time, for both of them. It was Strange’s last year and Tony was still so young. So Strange left it at that, he would be that
. Her energy brought life into Tony’s dark, still world. It was warm, familiar. It reminded Tony that this wasn’t the end, he had a life before Steve and he’ll have one after. Jan was a testament to that.
Strange furrowed his brows but a feelings of dread ran through him like he had been dumped in an ice bath. Strange jerked to lean over to look out the window they sat next to. Tony looked at him like he was crazy before leaning over to look at whatever the alpha was staring at.
Tony looked up at Steve, who looked back with nothing but adoration. Tony couldn’t help himself. Tony lifted himself on his toes, throwing his arms around Steve’s shoulders and bringing him down for a kiss. Steve responded by grabbing Tony’s hips and harshly bringing them forward so they met his own. The kiss was intense, Steve shoving his way into Tony’s mouth. Moaning at the taste of Tony. Tony softly bit Steve’s lower lip, causing Steve to groan. Tony smirked, pleased with himself. Steve brought on hand up to Tony’s face, running his thumb over Tony’s lower lip.
?” Tony snarled.
“Two years from now. It’ll be me, Carol and Thor. Along with the help of Thano’s daughters.” Stephen said, calm as ever.
anything. She killed it with her own hands.
“If you leak any of this information, I swear to God, Strange, I don’t care how powerful you are.
Somehow Tony ended up on Pepper’s chest with her arms wrapped around him as he cried himself horse. Pepper wasn’t a wolf, she had asked what
Tony was working on Jan’s tablet, mostly doodling ideas and equations. Working always helped Tony wind down. Tony mourned for his lab in New York. Tony had intended to tear it down and move most of it to California. It’s a shame though, it was by far Tony’s best lab.
The halls were decorated with small, tasteful paintings. Tony knocked lightly on the last door in the hallway. There was no reply. The door wasn’t completely shut, so Tony gently pushed it open. Just enough for Tony to pop his head through. The room was a good size. There were clothes thrown on the floor, making the dark colored wood stand out. There was a nightstand on either sides of the bed, a dresser directly across from the bed. A TV stood on the dresser, along with some gaming systems. Steve was nowhere to be found. Tony fully entered the room, a hand on his hip.
“Just try not to show off too much, you technically don’t exist.” Fury said, taking back the file from Carol as she undid her seat belt and scrambled out of the car. Fury rolled down the passenger seat window and gave her a hard look. “Nothing fancy, Carol. For the love of God.” He said again, even though he knew it was fruitless.
“Yes?” The omega asked, prompting the alpha to elaborate.
“Yeah, Strange used his voodoo space rock to look into the future.” Jan said, pointing her thumb to the wizard.
have access to this line, T-”
“This will be beneficial for us. I know the location of another. I can retrieve it if-”
The West Coast Avengers weren’t his pack, but his omega brain was crying to take care of them like they were. He had missed being able to care for people so blatantly, he missed being cared for in return. He was also scared of opening himself up to that kind of vulnerability again. Tony never had any doubts of his old pack until the moment he had caught Steve.
Tony slammed his hands on the glass table, now absolutely furious.Everybody jumped and Steve snapped his mouth shut. Tony was vibrating with anger, he wanted to kick, scream and yell but that wouldn’t make it hurt. He needed to hurt them, like they did him.
Stephen waved his hand and cup of tea materialized out of nowhere. It was steaming hot and on a saucer. The alpha held it out for Tony to take.
Maria was still out in the office, she had wanted to do a little more work. Nick took a sip of his drink as he started to gently rock back and forth. Nick almost fell into a relaxed state before his ears twitched at a noise in the sky. It was a very familiar noise. He cracked his eyes open to see a colorful show of lights
Tony welcomed Carol’s presence with Stephen’s ex,
. A problem that needs to be dealt with. What for? Because the dominant society sees alphaless pregnant omegas as things to be pitied? Who constructed these norms? Who are they benefiting?
Carol and Tony hadn’t spent too much time alone together. Carol had been the one mostly doing deep space searches. She would come back once a month for Fury’s report. Exploring deep space left little time to get to know one’s teammates. In the time that they did spend together, Tony had liked Carol very much.
“I say we get Strange into the fold. If we have an infinity stone, even  with just one we can probably go after Thanos. He’s hunting them, and now that he knows one is here on Earth he’ll probably come. He doesn’t have any infinity stones so we should play offense.” Carol said. “I just don’t know how we can get Strange on board, he seems like a wild card.”
“I will not only legally ruin you but I will hunt you down and blast your face off myself.” The threat jumped out of Pepper’s throat, soaked in venom. After that she simply sat in her chair and returned to her paperwork. It was a clear dismissal. One that surprisingly, Steve didn’t fight.
“I thought you were in Paris, is everything okay?” Pepper asked, putting her hands on Tony’s arms and rubbing them. “Tony you’re shaking.”
“Initiate Protocol Doomsday.” Tony said instinctively, forgetting to protect his lab. Never in his life of being bonded did he think he would ever activate Protocol
It started one night when the pack had gone to sleep and Tony was out of town for a conference. Steve and Bucky were on the couch watching an old black and white movie. The movie played softly as they talked about old times, what Bucky could remember.
“Go West Coast Avengers!” Jan declared sticking her hand out in front of her. Tony quickly followed his friend. The group followed to humor the two before throwing their hands up. Leaping forward into their new found mission.
“Stephen fucking Strange is a wizard?” Jan asked Tony as they both hurried down the halls of the Avengers compound. Tony back in his Armani suit and Jan still in her Wasp uniform.
Tony showered in record time. He had Happy run to the soup place and then pick Tony up so they wouldn’t have to make any stops. It had only been an hour since Bucky called. Tony told Happy not to wait up, and made his way into the apartment complex. It was nice, the buildings looked clean and up to date. It wasn’t anything like Tony’s penthouse building, he had a doorman. But only because Maria insisted on a doorman. Tony had the paper brown bag clutched in his left hand and his phone in the other.
“Why?” Steve gritted out. Natasha walked closer to her alpha. Sad blue meets hoping green.
“I don’t have my wallet.” Tony explained to the teen girl working the cash register. She gave him a sympathetic smile. Tony turned with his head hanging low in defeat before an arm pushed by Tony’s head with a card in it’s hand.

“You gave up that right up when
“Tony.” Natasha said softly, her eyes also wet when Tony’s own met hers. Tony looked at her and the sadness in her eyes made Tony
did Steve see a burst of stars behind his eyes.
“Thanks.” Steve said, not sure how to respond, his cheeks becoming pink. Steve settled into the bed, a hand over Tony’s waist. Sleep washed over them like warm waves.
Maria Stark was a woman who spent 12 hours a day in heels and never once took them off until she entered the bedroom for bed. Tony remembered all the band aids, blisters and blood on his mother's feet as he sat on her bed, looking in awe of her.
“It’s a flawless plan, Nick.” Jan said with urgency, tapping her foot. Fury’s office wasn’t decorated, at all. Just a glass desk, a conference table and some book shelves with SHIELD manuals.
The streets were in a panic, people running inside or pointing up at the obvious alien invasion. Tony was cursing himself for not bringing his suit or his under suit with his nano armor. Tony growls at himself for leaving it home because he didn’t want to shoot Steve or Bucky in the face on sight at his
“Guys!” Tony barked, slowing them down. The three looked at Tony with caution but also amusement. Tony looked down at the kitchen island’s marble pattern.
. Tony could see all their questions on their stunned lips.
Steve had taught him that.
“This is a trap.” Strange’s voice said, and he sounded nervous. Very different from the indifference he carried in his voice. He was looking straight at the spaceships and the wormhole.
“Is that like a super secret band you have?” Carol joked. Nick sighed and rolled his eyes.
The three were making circles around the warlock, shooting down the space crafts, keeping him in a protective bubble.
“I think the question is do you think we can convince him.” Tony countered, putting his hands in his pockets.
She pulled out four bottles of the most expensive wine she owned and held them up. She wiggled them in her hands.
”Nick, all I need is a yes or a no. Stop wasting my time.” Jan pushed, tired of this spy culture.
. Steve dismissed it, Steve had only seconds before the elevator made its way to its destination. “I’m not saying let’s go back, I’m saying let’s fix it. I’m devoted to you. Tony Stark. I’ll get down on my knees right here for you. Anything to keep you.”
“Morning.” Carol groaned while her face was still in her food. Tony gave her a warm smile.
“So how long until we attack?” Rhodey asked as they all sat outside on the back porch. Basking in the California sun at dusk.
“‘M come, Steve. ‘M
Tony was looking straight into Steve’s blue eyes when Steve opened his eyes back up. The elevator dinged and Steve heard the doors slide open. Tony yanked his hands back and gave Steve a once over before slipping on his sunglasses.
“Tony, I’ll consent to the bond break if you talk to me. Please, Tony.” Steve practically begged, not caring about the other 6 eyes watching him.
. Nothing about this day was going okay, nothing at all.
But he had his Bucky back, Bucky who was with him even before he was Captain America, when he was just some scrawny guy from Brooklyn. When they first defrosted Bucky and examined by SHIELD doctors he was terrified. Bucky looked so scared and clung to Steve the first week of being out from the ice.
Tony shook his head at those thoughts. They had chosen where their loyalty lies. There wasn’t much use giving it deeper thought.
, his eyes rolling to the back of his head. Steve grunted in his ear and kissed Tony’s temple as he hammered away; hitting that spot over and over and over. Fucking Tony like it was his fucking job. Steve grabbed Tony’s hands and pinned them above his head by his wrists. Tony looked at him, his mouth swollen and red, moaning.

“Janet?” Fury called from his office. Jan turned to look at him, stuffing the letter into her inside suit jacket. Janet made her way into his office, closing the door behind her before setting herself in the chair in front of Fury’s desk. Fury eyed the door and then at Janet, raising an eyebrow in question. Janet knew Fury was asking about her brief interaction with Natasha but Janet brushed the spy off.
Bucky wasn’t surprised, it made sense. Natasha and Steve had entered a screaming match of who’s fault it was and what to do. It wasn’t helpful, it was just how the alpha’s were dealing with their own internal feelings of causing Tony to flee from them. Bucky had stayed quiet, he knew he had no right to have an opinion. He was there for Steve and Natasha to lean on. He had quietly slipped into the role of pack omega.
Strange didn’t see Tony for a week. Which was not surprising at all, Strange knew how heats worked. He was in premed, damn it. Still, Strange worried from time to time. Strange

“Wasp!” One of the people on the coms yelled. “Aliens
“We should call his husband or pack.” Stephen said, knowing what the omega needed was to rest in a place he felt secure. A dark look snapped onto Jan’s face, her hands curled into fists. She opened her mouth before closing it again.
The trio was dressed to the nines, mostly to be intimidating. Jan had agreed, she had even fueled and hyped him up, having a hand in picking everything out with Tony. Tony wore very fitting, flared out slacks with a fitting black satin blouse that made a sharp v in the middle of his chest, a black suit, and a big black hat that one would see omega’s wear to funerals.
.” Natasha told him before standing up to leave. She studied Steve before looking back at Bucky.
Entering Bucky was like coming home to that Brooklyn apartment. A more simple time of Steve’s long, cold life. Bucky was always warm and wet, Steve couldn’t help but slip his cock in and out slowly, gently. Bucky’s moans were always

keep up with current events and Iron Man being mated to Captain America was no secret. They were American royalty. But still, something reckless in Strange had urged him to pursue. To see how far he can go with this.
He also noticed that Tony’s scent lingered pretty heavily on the wizard on the very rare occasion that he showed up with Jan to talk to Fury. Like today.
“They’re all bastards.” Jan said, anger in her body language. Stephen nodded and picked up Tony in his arms. The omega was in a distressed haze and wrapped his legs around Stephen’s waste and clung on tight.

“Goodbye.” She all but whispered as she slipped past him and into the black car.
silently ask about Tony’s wellbeing every meeting. Jan stood and left, not wanting to indulge Fury anymore.
“Make sure the civilians are out of the area, these things are dropping like flies.” Jan said to the alpha, wasting no time. She took off her helmet and shook her head, still trying to recover from her fall.
, a leader of the
Tony still kept radio silence with his old pack, not telling them where he was or about Little Peanut. Who was making his presence known. It had been only four months and Tony was starting to show if he lifted his shirt. The morning sickness came but it wasn’t terrible. The omega usually just ate some crackers before attempting to get out of bed and that seemed to do the trick so far.
The curtains were closed, the bed made and cold, the only heat source coming from was the fireplace.
Steve released his hand from Sharon and stood up; he walked to the hall calling him in a harsh voice, "Tony. Follow me."
Security entered the room and his instincts kicked in.
He sat on the bed, slowly, and looked around.
"Don't," Steve gritted his teeth. "Take another step in my direction, I can't be trusted around you."
"Oh, so that means never hanging out with your best friend? Oh ok, I get it no need to explain any further, I get it." he averted his eyes in frustration, staring at the floor, can't look Steve in the eyes.
At night he would dream of Steve lying beside him, caressing and kissing him with the same love… he wouldn’t deny it, he felt a surging pain every time he woke up to see it was only a false dream.
It was as if time went slower as he saw the ring fall onto the coals and devoured by the flames. He felt out of breath as he saw what he has done in the flicker of a moment, and he fell on his knees.
“Peggy, I-”
And death has lurked for Steve so many years but he hid in the ice for a century.
He held the letters closer to his heart, remembering the time when everything was happy and right.
"I was just trying to clear things up!" Tony raised his voice but he stared at the floor, his eyes full of sorrow and regret.
"Wha-" Tony was protesting.
Tony's eyes widened, he opened his mouth and closed again, not knowing what to answer. He closed his eyes, sighed and opened them again, giving her a vicious, straight smile, staring at her venomously, "I see Steve likes his girls bitchy and boring and if I may say tasteless in every category there is, honestly I don't see what he finds in you, probably because your aunt was his first love interest."
"Good morning," she smiled, looking at her watch, "or should I say afternoon."
I've been waiting for so long to write this chapter gosh! I've been working a lot on this one to be just as perfect and amazing as I dreamt it would.
"I had a date.."
Above him the ceiling swam to his vision, he blinked and looked around.
"Tony..." he took a step closer trying to catch his eyes, his face turning back to its normal color, his eyes softening.
Tony jerked from the accusation of his relationship with Bucky. "I- That is not true! Just listen to yourself!" He gripped Steve's arm, forcing him to look at him. Steve looked him in the eyes with a fake smile on his lips, "Don't try to deny it, I'm not naive. I have seen women and men around you, so don't think I don't see how they fall for your charms!" His smile turning into a boiling wrath. "ALL YOUR DAMN CHARMS!" He shouted, shoving Tony away. Tony flinched, Steve never raised his voice to a point of shouting or swearing. Steve went back to the fireplace, picking up the box of letters. "I'm going to quit the team," he said quietly, throwing more letters into the fire after giving them one look.
It was all a dream. Just a dream. It’s not real.
He was done.
The pile vanishing into the fire as Tony burnt it all, “I’m burning the memories, burning the letters that might have redeemed you.”
He gave up fighting and closed his eyes, letting death, who waited patiently,  finally take him.
He pushed them to the wall, which made a big enough hole for him to escape.
"Tony... I- I don't know." Steve stared at his feet, not knowing what more to say.
Something was wrong? - indeed.
He- he was crying?
“I - I have to go," he whispered, enough for Steve to hear. He walked quickly past him, not looking back.
“Her name is Sharon Carter.” Steve was red from embarrassment.
What! You can’t blame him! He heard it was a healing food for broken hearts.
“Break what?” He felt icy spikes climbing his arms and legs, moving slowly to his lungs.
Since that night Tony drifted away.
“You’ll be alright?”
"You know, I was hoping you'd come back to being my best friend, heck I was hoping you'd see she's not the one for you and notice-" he huffed a, bitter full of sadness and desperation, laugh. "Notice that I have feelings for you and you'd want to be with me." Tony finally looked him in the eyes, they were full of sorrow with a tinge of hope.
In front of him stood Bucky, his best friend, dressed in the clothes of the mission where he fell to his death.
A piercing and burning pain shot his heart and Tony felt his eyes prickling, he looked down at the letters, reading and searching,
From him…
“At ease, soldier.” He heard a manly voice call and he turned around to see a dark-colored man with an eyepatch approach him, “Look I’m sorry about that little show back there, but we thought to break it to you slowly.”
“I can’t join you because you’re not alive, the real people you are pretending to be are gone and I’m all alone.” They stared at him, astonished, “They’re not coming back.” He finished with a whisper.
He put the pictures aside and took the small box, rubbed the matte cover with his thumb. The box’s hinge was a bit broken from a well-deserved outburst, after a few attempts he succeeded in opening it, inside was a simple yet beautiful ring. He picked it up and tried it on, the familiar touch of it sent waves of longing yet an aching pain, but he kept it on.
“Burn.”
A shuddered sigh escaping from him.
With Steve holding her hand, feeding her strawberries, watching a romantic movie as they cuddled and caressing her back or arm gazing at her with this sweet lovingly look in his eyes, a look Tony longed for…
“We’ll be a family again, everything will be resumed as we left it, from getting our old apartment to painting together.” His mother said, laying her hand on his heart, he felt as if his heart suddenly started freezing, his breath hitched.
"Why do you suddenly care what I say?! Huh?! You anyway forget me whenever she's around!" Tony realized too late what he said.
He felt beaten all over again, exhausted and heartbroken, he took from the pile a picture of the time they went to a carnival together, Steve was laughing joyfully from the number of dolls he won for Tony in a game and Tony remembered the laughter that came from his own mouth as he took the picture.
(See the end of the chapter for
He threw the blankest off him and headed to the bathroom to wash his face.
“Home.” Sarah, Peggy, and Bucky answered in unison.
Steve sorted the letters by the fireplace with trembling hands and a face streaked with tears.
Tony hurried to follow him to the hall, Steve stood there with his arms crossed, his face was almost red, his eyes flaring with anger and his eyebrows contracted in exasperation.
Tony kept his eyes on the floor, winching from the hit of the crinkle letter. Steve walked past him as he derisively said, "Heaven forbid, a journalist whisper; 'He's part of some scheme'." He turned swiftly to face Tony, fire in his eyes. "Your enemy whispers, so you have to scream!" He yelled the last part.
"In clearing your name you have ruined our lives!" Steve crumbled one of the letters he was holding and threw it at him.
There was a lot of noise, people shouting and alarms blaring, everything was a blur to him.
“Steve?” A deep voice asked, surprised.
He jerked his head and stared at the mirror, water dripped from his face.
Sorry, this takes so long, I first write my stories on Google Docs and then I move it here and life is also in the way so hope you like it!
"Wasn't she like, Capsicle's first girlfriend?" he couldn't stop himself from saying that.
Tony became worried,
He can't remember entering his floor in the tower, he just remembers everything being blurry and every breath painful. He closed his bedroom door, leaning on it and slowly sliding to the floor, his knees close to his chest, only then he realized his face was wet.
“Wait, Cap has a girlfriend?” Clint overheard, surprised and the popcorn he threw fell into his eye.
and threw it to the flame.
He got out of the building, he didn’t know how-
Every newspaper that told the story of betrayal, anything that mentioned what happened and Steve, “The world had no right to my heart!” the flames grew more and more and so was the fire inside of him, “The world has no place in our bed, they don’t get to get to know what I said.”
He crumpled the newspaper in his hand, with a long time rage,
Tony asked one day, leaning on the counter and eating some ice cream. He’s been eating a lot of ice cream lately.
Steve never looked this angry, especially not with him.
“Ma-”
"I- I can explain..." Tony reached his hand to hold Steve's, but decided it was a bad idea. "Just please, listen."
"I don't know who you are." Steve said weakly, "I have so much to learn."
He took more letters and pictures from the pile and threw them to the fire, “I’m watching it burn!”
“Steve, how did you get here?” Bucky took a step forward, reaching his hand out, Steve backed away.
"No -  I- Since you started dating her you've been ignoring me and even if we were in the middle of something you ran to her whenever she came or asked!" Tony pointed at him guiltily.
“I- I can’t join you.”
Suddenly Steve’s expression turned hesitant and shy yet serious, “I have something to tell you.”
He turned around.
He got up from the bed he was laying on, apparently, he was wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and cream-colored trousers.
And… And Steve… Steve that wasn’t there when he said they’ll fight together and if needed lose together.
He didn't want to talk to him, he didn't even want to look at him, his heart wretching in pain.
“Steve,” a gentle yet firm voice asked from behind, he twisted around to see another familiar face, Peggy, dressed in the military outfit she wore before he said his last goodbyes and went into the ice, “why are you here?”
He dressed casually to work, he took his key for his flat and motorcycle and his old phone, as he was about to head out of the door he stopped and stared at his brown leather jacket,
Tony winched in agony, the team was Steve's family, it was his everything... "No, Steve, don't quit the team because of me. The team needs you... I- I need you..."
"Please just please don't leave! I tried to be the best for you two, to build the Stark industry to perfection, to be the superhero you saw me as and I messed up! And I know it! Just please let me prove myself again to you!" Tony begged for forgiveness, but it was too late.
He remembers that Monday, that was like any other Monday movie night as ‘Tasa and Clint “made” popcorn – more like trying to catch them in their mouth and practically eating half of the bowl. Thor, sitting by the counter, joined their game. Sam sat on one of the couches reading a book with a bemused smile, peaking at times to watch the little game. Bruce looked for a movie everyone will enjoy and Steve and he sat on the couch, Tony talked about his latest project and Steve listening and at time commenting.
He fed the fire with the letters, that once showed great affection and commitment and now only showed pain and broken trust.
"Steve-" Tony started.
A thought that he has been turning in his mind over and over again has returned once more and he knew that this time his answer will be yes.
Steve huffed angrily, "Tony, you can't expect me to always hang out only with you, I have a girlfriend now."
He managed to run a block until he understood that what he was seeing wasn’t another set up like the facility those people kept him in, suddenly black cars blocked his way. Guards, men, and women in suits went out of the cars, surrounding him and directing civilians away.
"It wasn't like that, it was on the news and he came bursting into a journalist conference," Tony barked a sour laugh. "So it wasn't quite a whisper."
“Steve?” That voice… he didn’t want to turn, he missed her voice, her hugs, her kisses, and the smiles she had on for him even in her darkest days, he missed her too much.
He listened closely and noticed that the noises he heard were from an old radio broadcasting a baseball game, normal, isn't it? But… it's a broadcast of a game that was at May 1941… he was at that game…
It hurt.
It hurt… He couldn’t deny how every time he looked at them he felt a twist in his heart and wished he was instead of her…
“So, you’re Peggy Carter’s niece?”
“Stay with us here, Steve, the war is over.” Peggy held his hand, “Come back home.”
He brought the phone closer to his heart, “I hope that you…” his hands tightening around it as he whispered.
"Tony." Steve glowered. "That's enough."
None of them could be alive right now…
No, it was damn Strange who gave the infinity stone.
The first few weeks he tried to avoid Steve as much as possible and then they started to hang again but it wasn’t the same. There was this awkward tension of many silences. Steve was on his, little crappy, phone a lot, smiling this love-struck smile.  Tony knew that he was talking to Sharon… His girlfriend… She even started coming by The Tower and when that happened Steve forgot his existence… Even if he and Steve were in the middle of something, whether in Tony’s workshop or watching a movie, when she arrived he would almost jump on his feet and go on a walk with her or something, not even sparing a glance back to Tony.
Tony made a joke making Steve burst into laughter, god he loved making Steve laugh.
"Steve, I just want to talk." Tony clasped his arm but Steve pushed him away.
Tony groaned and covered his face in his hands, feeling like lying down and not moving-
"The game. It's from May 1941, I know because I was there." she stared at him quietly and he knew that she was caught. He got up slowly from the bed, "I'm gonna ask you again, where am I?"
As he was seeking his way out of the tunnels, he found himself standing on an unending ocean, the color is of a mix of bluish turquoise under the midday sun. It’s very calming, the water seems to be solid under his feet so he decided to wander, examining his surroundings; it appeared as if the sky was melting with the water and the sun standing still between both of them.
When they were happy and right.
He was drowning, and the three of them were staring at him with sorrow and emptiness in their eyes.
“Who’s the girl?” Sam asked.
and he threw a letter to the hungry fire,
The sound of the tap running took him out of his thoughts, he closed it and went back to the bedroom.
I changed the timeline pretty much to fit my story so here Steve meets Natasha and Clint before the Avengers team was formed.
At that moment Tony felt as if time went slower as if every brick and stone that held his life collapsed, smashing his heart on its way down.
They are all gone, all that is left is a simple memory of them.
Idiot Space Boy, who liked footloose way too much, that decided to punch Thanos was more important than getting the gauntlet.
“My son, oh you changed so much, but what are you doing here?” Sarah Rogers asked tenderly. She reached over, he didn’t move, she cupped his cheeks. Her hands felt warm, “Shh, there’s no need to cry, you’re here now and that’s all that matters.” She wiped tears from his face that he didn’t know were there.
Tony thought to himself.
" I don't feel anything. "
Suddenly he felt the ice under his feet breaking and he fell into the freezing water, he tried swimming but felt as if he was being dragged down and his body getting heavier.
Death has taken his mother so many years ago, in October 1963 from tuberculosis, he was 18 at the time.
Tony took a step, closing the gap.  He cupped Steve's cheeks, leaning in, pressing his lips softly to his.
Freezing and dark, Steve felt, the ice taking a strong grip on his lungs and crawling to his heart, it was as if he was freezing all over again.
He was laying in his bed, under a pile of blankets, On his bed was a pool of light that has entered the room from the window.
The weather became very chilly, the ocean beneath his feet was cloaking with a layer of ice like spreading vines.
Unfortunatly life gets in the way and I hate him.
He huffed, Steve was just being...him.
“You’ve been asleep, Cap, for almost seventy years.”
“Congratulations Steven! May you live a lifetime full of love and happiness.” Thor wished.
“I’m erasing myself from the narrative,” finally expressing his thoughts out loud, even if no one was around to hear him,  “Let future historians and newshounds wonder how Tony reacted when you broke his heart,” In a swift motion he tore the picture, “You have torn it all apart.” and threw it to the blazing fire, “I’m watching it burn.”
He twirled around, instantly everything felt so heavily; from his movements to his reactions, his breath hitched.
"I'm burning the letters you wrote me," Steve said with indignation. "You can stand over there if you want."
Death has taken Bucky in a mission where he fell to his death, he couldn’t save him.
Suddenly the door opened and a women, who seemed to look like Peggy, came in.
“Sure, tell me.” Tony answered calmly.
"I don't know, it seems kinda weird going out with the same guy my aunt went with." Tony now giving her a cold, challenging stare, not caring what he's saying. "Kissing the same guy..."
Steve shook his head once more, releasing gently his grip. "Don't, Tony... I'll be back for Peter..." Giving him one last look and exited the door.
He felt warmth fill him, his heart flutter with lust and felt so much adrenaline that no coffee could ever give. After what seemed like a few hours (actually a few seconds) they parted. Tony full of hope but Steve didn't even look at him, he pushed Tony away, slowly and gently, he searched for words but none seemed right.  "I'm sorry," Steve admitted hoarsely. "I don't feel anything."
“Alright then, call if you need anything,” Rhodey answered and closed the door.
The fire consuming the letter in seconds.
" We'll stay friends. "
He then took the letters and started going through them.
Death has taken Peggy during the years as she has waited for a dance that never happened.
"I don't wanna hear it." said Tony.
"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say." Tony apologized.
September 5th, 1945
Joker:I'm just saying. He's a trickster.
She merely smiled brightly. "Hi, daddy."
"You should invite them to the Dawn Bringer's wedding."
"I will." Tony replied, and kissed Pepper.
? "Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you." said Tony.
I have crushed planets. I have abolished whole populations. I have breathed life into unborn beings and watched as their lives grew pitiable until only I could save them—I have wielded such mastery over the limited agency of my inferiors. But none of these displays satisfy me, not even the adrenaline that comes with the eradication of half a peoples' existence.
"Looks like we're not getting paid." Rocket told her.
Joker: I'm just saying. The majority get away a lot.
"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation." said Wanda.
"This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries..." murmured Thor.
"It works."
"No, I'm not."
." said Bruce.
"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?" asked Thanos. Meanwhile, Drax was ready to strike, eager to avenge his family. However, Star-Lord stopped him, saying "He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
"God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship." Pepper wailed.
LONDON - Everyone's favorite inventor and businessman was seen last night partying it up in London. Stark, spotted near the ME London, clearly had something to celebrate. SI is making him one of the richest people in the world. Although his net worth is undisclosed, it's estimated to be in the billions at this point. He was in London to receive the prize Clifford Patterson Medal and Prize, which he won because of his work in energy physics. However, it seems like Stark swapped out one prize for another! We're not sure who these lovely ladies are, but we bet that Stark would want to study their energy all right - enthusiastically, from the way Stark is pretty much undressed. Obadiah Stane, who runs SI for Stark, reportedly doesn't much care that his wunderkind likes drinking better than inventing - which he likes a whole lot. Stark was never arrested for possession of illegal substances, but the playboy is known for liking his fun. When our reporters asked him the morning after about the events the night before, Stark stated that he liked his social time the way he likes his science: "involving hazardous substances and preferably naked."
Leyenar replied.
The Fates nearly gleamed with the progress of their work:a work to revive the lives of the heroes' past bodies and the lives their souls had once endured.
"You know them?" asked Tony, and Leyenar had to explain everything to him, Strange, and Peter. It had indeed been one helluva explanation, with Leyenar unable to keep her hands off Star-Lord all the time.
The omega huffed up in defense of himself. “
Thor and Carol had offered to host him off the planet as well. Thor had been very excited by the idea of showing his omega and friends his home planet. The ancient and golden halls of Asgard. A place of
. Tony slammed the breaks on his omega brain.
How fucking
The newly formed team all sat in the common room in the west wing of the Avenger’s compound. It was the opposite wing of the East Coast Avengers. They had all changed out of their uniforms and into more comfortable clothes. Pepper had arrived with bags of food from Tony’s favorite place that had the best dumplings. They all sat in the living room, around the center coffee table with the food laid out like a buffet. Trying to unwind as much as they could after today’s events.
Tony, the
“If we live through this we can exchange stories,
Which brings Tony to his current project.
“Code names!” Rhodey yelled into the coms. Tony giggled, his best friend was forever a Fly Boy. “Code names on the radio,
He was older now, he seemed more filled out than his school boy days. He was in a gray suit, with a soft looking red tie that out of the corner of Tony’s eyes it almost seemed to...
.” Natasha growled.
As class went on, Tony didn’t make one single comment. It made Strange fume. Did Tony think Strange was just like everyone else here? Did Tony think Strange so predictable? How insulting. So the next time one of their classmates said something stupid Strange whispered something to Tony.
“Bet you thought about us every night, makin’ yourself come from thinking about me ‘n Buck fucking you. And you loving every second.”
Tony thought as he stood in the doorway of his and Steve’s bedroom. This is what his mother meant, keep your breath, keep your poise,
“So what do we do?” Pepper asked.
stay safe! xoxox
Tony shook the thoughts out of his head as he and Jan made their way out with books in their hands. Jan hailed them a cab and looked at him when they were seated in.
.” Tony whined, his breathing heavy and unsteady “I’m gonna come, Steve. Steve, please.” Tony moaned. Steve slowly took his mouth off Tony. It felt painfully good. Steve ran his hands gently over Tony’s skin. Tony’s nerve were in overload and the softest touch made him moan like a whore. Steve smiled something wicked as he appreciated his handiwork. Tony’s body was shaking in pleasure. Tony had one finger in his mouth, biting down so he wouldn’t moan as loud. His cheeks flushed with a lovely shade of peach, his chest rising up and down rapidly. Steve didn’t say anything as he manhandled Tony, turning him around. Tony looked over his shoulder, looking at Steve as he played with Tony’s cheeks. Tony smirked and wiggled his hips slightly.
Rough day, indeed.
“Jan’s not so easily discouraged, Strange.” Tony called out playfully from his place in his lawn chair.
“Thank you, I can’t believe I forgot my wallet. I’ll get you back!” Tony insisted, giving Strange a smile. “You know I’m good for it.” Tony teased. Strange let out a huff of amusement.
Hello! Let me know what ya'll think of the chapter!! I feel like I'm going to slow but also I like the pace I'm going at :) I just like to have fun!
. I know what I’m asking, please Natasha.” Steve sobbed. Steve honestly didn’t know if he was referring to Tony or Bucky.  Natasha’s face remained neutral but she made no motion to move.
prior about it, the Stark's had finally picked a school to send their omega son to. Strange found it disgusting, really. People plotting to take advantage of a kid, wanting to squeeze out money and clout. Strange knew he himself would eventually end up networking and forcing friendships to climb up the medical world later, he had no illusions about that, but Strange did have limits. Strange was above swindling the trust of an omega kid. Stephan was a good alpha, with a backbone. So Strange didn’t pay much attention to any talk of Tony Stark, not even when Stark did finally arrive and the whole school would not shut up about it. Strange just never looked up from his books.
, Steve. It’s so good, feels
Steve took Tony’s hands into his and raised them to his lips to kiss Tony’s fingers. It was like a shot of euphoria for Steve. Feeling Tony’s skin under his lips again, his scent in his nose. It had been so long, Steve didn’t know how long he could go without it.
Tony felt in his suit pockets to find his wallet missing.
“A what?” Rhodey asked.

“I have the cutest ideas for a nursery and the
Tony looked at Rhodey. “Tell her she was right and where we are. She’ll know what it means.” Tony said with a small smile. Even in a moment like this thinking of his friend’s personality made him smile.
you, Tony.” Steve said in a hush voice, but it sounded deep and threatening. Tony’s spine tingled in excitement and Tony licked his lips in anticipation.
“I’ll pay for it along with my coffees.” The deep voice said, Tony looked up in surprise at the person. They were taller than Tony, with black curls and facial hair that looked
“So, you’re in what? Downtime?” Nick asked, not familiar with the concept of downtime. Carol shrugged and threw her head left and right in thought.
Carol let out another laugh before bringing the omega in for a one armed hug. “Jan didn’t tell me. But she didn’t have to! It’s written all over your puppy love face.” Carol said, she pinched the omega’s cheeks to tease him. Tony deflated even more.
“Soooo, this
Thank you for all the love in the comments when I just DIPPED. <3 <3 <3
Tony and Jan have been terrorizing Fury since he started at SHIELD. When he was just a grunt agent, he’d sometimes get stuck with babysitting Tony and Jan while Howard and Hank were busy elsewhere. It wasn’t
“Supper, dinner, whatever. I’m in the mood for some seriously good Italian.” Jan said excitedly.
“Motherfucker!” Carol yelled, annoyed, as she barreled back, mostly in surprise of what happened, completely unaffected by the blast.
say hi to me on tumblr! @sailroslowbro
“I guess.” She said with a hand in the air, signaling with the hand her drink was in that it was vague but close enough of what she was doing back on Earth. Nick looked at her, a glint of amusement in his eye. Carol picked up on it right away and raised an eyebrow at him.
Tony was happy about it, he knows everything else is falling apart but this. The little peanut growing inside of Tony was the best thing to ever happen to Tony. Tony will be damned if anyone looks at him with pity-
“So you know of Thanos?” Jan asked, remembering what Carol said.
Jan’s eyes snapped to her front door and she instinctively wrapped one of her hands around the simple yellow bracelet around her wrist. She had one on each wrist, they were a gift from Tony. They were nanobots that transformed from bracelets to Wasp Widgets. When she activated them they wrapped around her hands like black yellow gloves that went to her elbows, with her Wasp Stings armed in the palm of her hands. They completed her Wasp armor when she had it on.
“For who?” The Wasp asked, turning fully toward Strange. Her face unreadable under the sleek black helmet. “Maybe Captain Marvel? The timeline matches up. Plus you’re the only one with a galactic reputation. Carol’s eyes flicked toward Iron Man. That statement was not entirely true.
rare occurrence. He had told her he liked being an OBGYN more than a brain surgeon. He hadn’t realized it during his medical practice years and during his practicing years he had loathed every OBGYN case. But now, he realized how much more joy and life there was in the practice. Jan could see the guilt on the alpha’s face for not appreciating seeing
Tony could hear Rhodey groan. Tony smiled, maybe they could have a 3rd member of ‘
“If I may,” JARVIS started from where in the room or someone’s phone “Sir thought it a good idea to throw his phone out the window when leaving the city and I’ve taken the liberty of turning off the car’s tracking feature.”
Tony who was blissed out, his hands still above his head. His cheeks red and eyes half closed. His own cum glistening like pears on his stomach. Steve smiled and bent down to kiss Tony, who responded with soft kisses. Steve ran his hands down Tony’s side, softly.
Tony just shook his head and walked out the door and got into the car he came back in. Tony simply entered the driver seat, the car’s dashboard and inner lights turned on, JARVIS was saying something but all Tony could hear was a loud ringing in his ears, loud white noise. Almost as if someone was screaming.
But for right now, Bucky coming on his knot was all he could think about.

“Let me out.” Tony managed to choke up, suddenly coming back from the inside of his head. The talking stopped and they all looked at Tony. “I just need to walk, get out. Clear my head.” Tony whispered quickly. Jan and Pepper started to raise their concerns but Rhodey raised his hand to stop them. He looked at Tony, his eyes meeting the omegas.
. Like his eyes never left her alone. Fury had always put himself between her and the CFO whenever he was around. Jan had always been grateful, it was a subtle gesture from Fury. They never talked or acknowledged Fury's gesture.
“And Strange just has one of these almighty stones?” Pepper asked, sitting on her feet as she was curled up on the couch with a plate of rice and egg rolls. “Seems a little careless.”
Tony nodded in agreement. The alpha did take charge like it was as easy as breathing. He slipped in and out of the roll with such ease, and he knew when to pull back his control. Steve had a hard time letting go of control, it was one of the major roadblocks between Steve and Jan. It warmed Tony inside to see Jan and Stephen work so well together, it warmed him to see their friendship bloom. It was just like how he and Jan fantasize about when they were younger. To be in a pack together. It had been such a fight with Steve and Jan. But with Stephen, everything was so simple.
When all of this had first started Tony had been so unsure and and frankly, terrified at what the future would hold for him. Thanos and a cheating husband. He had been worried at what he was bringing a child into, what type of world had Tony created for Peter. And while Thanos was technically still an issue, his domestic life has stabilized a lot more than he anticipated. His home was coming along nicely and would be done within the month.
By Natasha’s signed name was a kiss mark in a deep red. Jan looked the paper over again and then the back. A set of coordinates with a request to burn the letter once Tony has read it. Jan quickly folded the letter back up and stuffed it into the envelope.
So here Tony was, fighting alien spaceships with an ex-classmate who is now a wizard and a lady from space who lights up like the sun. The fight was going pretty okay, other than the targeted attack on him. But Stephen had stepped in, the alpha had protected
Carol was still fighting the majority of the ships closest to the portal, Tony was trying his hardest to fly fast and avoid the swarm of ships chasing him. Rhodey was helping keep Stephen safe, but it wasn’t enough and the other alpha had to divide his attention to closing the portal and playing defense.
The news gave Stephen a shock, something that was hard to do ever since he discovered the mystic arts. The look on Jan’s face told him that she wasn’t kidding. The most selfish part of Stephen wanted to celebrate the new information. This means there was an opening for an alpha in Tony’s life. Stephen reached for those feelings and reeled them back as far as he could. Knowing the time was not right and not fair to the omega.
