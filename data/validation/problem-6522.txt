“If it makes you feel any better,” Natasha adds quietly, “we’re doing another search of the area. Just to... to find something. Anything.”
“Let’s get you some clothes, first. I won’t be able to concentrate otherwise,” Tony says tiredly. Steven isn’t quite sure if he’s joking.
Tony spots Steven, smiling along to some meaningless flirts from a few pretty, young ladies. Tony approaches with determination, only to be stopped by a knight standing nearby. Tony rolls his eyes.
Not wanting to startle the beast, Tony quietly sneaks around to where the dragon’s snout it, but keeps a safe distance in case of, well. Fire.
Finally, his father’s message comes to a close. The people are dismissed. Steven clenches his jaw as he watches them file out, off to continue their work and trade.
Tony couldn’t care less that Pepper was concerned for his social life, but the fact she insisted he needed new friends was irritating. It wasn’t like he
“The royal family still consists of dragon shifters,” Tony concludes in a whisper. Pepper is just as shocked as he is, despite having worked so close with the family for so long.
What he can’t help getting frustrated about though is the fact that it’s been nearly two months since Rumlow, and he hasn’t heard from Steve once. It grates at him and he tries not to pick at it, but on the days when he’s alone working on the Iron Man suit, his mind strays to the Captain and his anger then gets the better of him. Why hasn’t Steve come to see him? Sure, Tony could get his number from Pepper, but why should he be the one to reach out first? Does he see Tony as tainted now, after seeing him at his most vulnerable? Is he disgusted by him because he’d been violated? But... Steve had been the one who had cradled him to his chest and not let go until they got to the ER. Maybe he was staying away because he felt overly protective about a sub that wasn’t his, Tony thought. Whatever the reason, the thoughts and fears continued to fester in Tony’s mind like a disease.
he is, but is surprised that his feet are already one step (ha!) ahead of him, taking him towards the Captain before he’s even finished his thought. He zones in on Rogers and walks straight towards him, head up, eyes on target. It’s not the proper way to approach a Dominant, let alone an Alpha, but Tony has never been one for self preservation or protocol.  What he should be doing is waiting for a Dominant to introduce him, and then keep his eyes down, head bowed and no touching. What Tony actually does is walk straight into the space currently occupied by three military Dominants plus the Captain, looks straight at Rogers’ face and extends his hand to shake.
“We did it Jarvis, we really fucking did it!” Tony breaths in wonder, eyes wide and hair wild.  “A mini arc reactor. It’s perfect, you’re perfect.”
I can confirm is wholly true,”Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows at Rogers because fuck it, why not?  Flirting dangerously? Yeah, Tony knows how to do that, it’s second nature. “You should swing by my office at SI, let me show you just how much fun I can be.”
“But that project is just for show,” Tony knows that he sounds bitter, but it’s to be expected. The arc reactor is one of the ideas that he’s most proud of: self-sustaining, renewable energy with zero impact to the environment. One hundred percent clean energy, and it already powers one of the SI labs outside the city, but Howard had decided that he liked money more than saving the planet, so it was sidelined and labelled a vanity project.  “And anyway, it’s the size of several trucks, and i’m not hauling that around behind the suit.”
OK, so it’s a teeny, tiny lie, but it’s the best he’s been able to come up with without having to say that he’s been a coward because he’s trying to figure out his feelings. He’s Captain America, it’s a likely story, and he hopes that Tony doesn’t see straight through him.
“Quite the mouth you’ve got on you,” The man sneers and stops a few steps away, eyeing Tony hungrily.  “I've got something much more fun you can use it for.”
Steve has to stifle a snort of laughter at that because this man has never put duty before anything before, none of them have. God he wants to get out of here. Just a few more hours...
“Oh, that much is obvious,” Steve shoots back, but his smile is still genuine which is, huh? Tony didn’t expect that. Usually when he’s compared to Howard he only sees disdain on other’s faces. And then Steve adds:  “You’re much more fun.”
Also, if you're reading this Romilly, you thieving piece of shit, I hope you step on lego and become deathly allergic to your favorite food. Fuck you.
Tony is relieved that he bit the bullet and texted Steve, because now they seem to have this nice, comfortable thing going on. They text back and forth and Steve calls him sometimes just to chat and to see how he’s doing. It’s sweet. Tony sends Steve random pictures of stuff wherever he happens to be, and Steve will often send something sarcastic and witty back that makes Tony snort with laughter. He loves it.  Behind the constant back and forth, there is definitely an underlying current of sexual tension and Tony loves that even more. Being a flirt is what he does, be it in person, or by text, doesn’t matter. And Tony is laying it on nice and thick because he wants to make sure he can cut the atmosphere with a knife when they finally get to dinner. Steve had called him a brat and that is exactly what he is, so he’s working that to his advantage.  It’s also the sub in him that just loves to wind up a Dominant to the point of snapping and punishing him. He’s been trying to think about which methods would prefer in that department and the possibilities that his brain supplies him with are endless and get him hard within seconds.
The moment stretches on and Tony can’t seem to look away from the blue of Steve’s eyes, glued to his seat under his gaze. Then he thinks: what the hell, in for a penny, in for a pound and does something that Steve will most definitely
Steve tilts his head to one side as he considers Tony, the twitch of his lips slowly becoming a smirk as he takes in the fire on Tony’s eyes, the jut of his defiant chin.  He’s young, very early twenties he thinks, and very, very pretty.
He threw Rumlow across the room then tried to use him as a wrecking ball. I’ve never seen an Alpha in action before, dude didn’t stand a fucking chance. “
After nearly three days, Pepper arranged for Tony to be moved to the mansion as she knew he’d be more comfortable there, efficiently organising round-the-clock medical care  and transport. She’d asked Steve if he’d wanted to come with them, but he’d declined. The mansion was Tony’s home, and he didn’t have the sub’s express permission to be there, to be in his personal space. Pepper said she understood, and that her asking was essentially as good as Tony asking, but she couldn’t change his mind. He didn’t want Tony to wake up and discover that an unbonded Dominant, and an Alpha at that, had been in the space of an unbonded submissive without that sub’s direct permission.  Pepper had hugged him and thanked him again, and then made him promise to visit the mansion when Tony was awake and able to proffer the invitation himself.
His father has given up despairing about what might happen to his son and moved straight to quiet, seething resignation. Howard used to try to make Tony see that his behaviour was wrong and obscene, but as frustration grew at his son’s increasingly outlandish actions, he got nasty. Drunken beatings became the norm, but still Tony wouldn’t listen. His mother, Maria, tried a different approach, and Tony seemed to listen for a while, always keen to make his mother’s life a little easier, but it hadn’t lasted of course.  Even Howard threatening Tony with being forcibly bonded to Obie, the Stark Industries ‘Right Hand’ didn’t seem to put a dent in Tony’s lifestyle. So now, Howard just ignores his son, only interacting when absolutely necessary. And it was pretty easy to ignore someone when you lived in the Stark mansion: four floors of rooms plus a basement to get lost in.
“Pepper said you needed a trainer,” Natasha says succinctly as she approaches Tony to give him a hug.
“Captain Rogers, leader of the Avengers but please, just call me Steve.” There’s a tiny twitch at the side of Rogers’ lips, and a twinkle in his eyes that Tony thinks might be the start of a smile.  He knows he’s got balls of fucking steel walking up to an Alpha Dom like he just did, but Rogers...
Yes, i know, it's been about 2 months since i posted to this fic. I just felt HELLA burnt out after NaNo, then writers block set and, and then shit happened in rl and i had to put the boys on the back burner for a while. I would say i'm sorry, but i ain't apologising for shit i have no control over so... whatevs.
So thank you for your patience and your truly lovely comments, it means the world it really does. I'm so very nearly almost done with the next chapter, so stay with my lads, it's comin'.
Now that he knows the thrusters and stabilisers work, Tony sets about putting together the whole Iron Man suit. As the parts each slot into their places, the suit starts to take shape and Tony’s excitement builds. It takes him almost 36 hours and a fuck ton of coffee to finish, but when he’s done, the suit is standing in the middle of the workshop looking sleek and gorgeous and Tony thinks he’ll never love anything like he loves what’s standing in front of him. It takes his breath away.  He doesn’t know how long he stands there, DUM-E and U either side of him, but he eventually gives himself a shake and decides that now is as good a time as any to see not only if the suit fits, but if it works. He steps forward and starts the complicated task of actually getting into it. It takes a little time, and he’s pretty sure he’ll have even more bruises than normal after he’s pinched his skin a few times closing and locking various parts together, but he gets there with the help of J.A.R.V.I.S and the ‘bots.
Tony eventually claws his way up through the darkness to the light and when he blinks awake he finds himself in his bed at the mansion. The curtains are drawn, the bedside lamps throwing a soft light across his bedroom. He can’t tell what time of day it is, but he doesn’t think he cares right now. He’s home, safe.  He’s propped up, angled to one side against a wedge of pillows behind him and he lies still as he takes stock of his body. His toes, feet and legs seem fine, but there’s a dull, stabbing ache in his ass and his breath stutters when his brain supplies fragments of why. Moving up, his stomach and chest feel a little sore, the sheets a little lumpy from bandages he thinks, but nothing too bad. His shoulders are aching and sore, but his face feels the worst. He brings a hand up to feel and notices a cannula in the back of it and follows the tube up to a drip hanging by his bed.  He skims his fingers as gently as he can over his face and winces when he feels stitches and swelling. He flops his hand back down and blinks at the ceiling. How long has be been out? What happened? Who found him?
“He’s surprisingly good at it when he has to be,” Nat smirks, and Tony feels the tension he was holding in his shoulders start to ease.
“I think you might have a deal Cap,” Tony says eventually and leans forward.  “Now indulge my curiosity a little. Is that the only reason you’re here?”
Steve has been to Stark Industries many times before, but this is the first time he’s actually been looking forward to it.  The tower dwarfs the buildings around it, a gleaming shard of glass and chrome soaring upwards to the sky. Steve used to think of it as grotesque, a sharp reminder of a New York that he no longer felt part of. But he has an artists eye and he’s come to appreciate the different architecture of the city, how the history of New York can been seen from building to building, old nestled against new, somewhat like himself. Stark Tower is a shimmering behemoth, a monolith of the Stark empire.
So he goes about his business of leading the world’s only team of superheroes, but at the same time, he also speaks to government officials, sits in on legislation committees and speaks at activist rallies. And on top of that, he advises the military and lectures on weapon safety. It's a pretty full schedule, but then Steve has never been one to sit idle, not even when he was skinny and under doctor’s orders to stay in bed.  He’s always been a stubborn asshole and that’s never going to change.
Tony pushes off lightly from the ground, careful not to have a repeat performance of the last couple of times he’s tried the thrusters: he’s still bruised from head to toe. The thrusters kick in and he starts to hover a few inches off the ground.  OK, this is good, he thinks, this is working. He tries for a little more but using the gauntlet stabilisers to try and give him some control is a fuck of a lot harder than the theory, and he ends up shooting off in a couple of wrong directions. But then he gets the hang of it, using the stabilisers to balance out the thrust from the boots and he’s finally doing it. He lets out a whoop and then  brings himself back down to land.
to be paired off with a stranger. She would absolutely not see her precious Anthony go through what she had with Howard. Tony would be free to find his own bondmate, or for his bondmate to find him, but he would not be forced into something that he had no choice in, she would not allow it.
Steve presses his thumb to the glass pad on the device and it scans his thumb print.  A small rectangle of card comes out of the back, and Todd takes it to slip it into a plastic card holder that has a clip at the top and hands it to Steve.
, thanks to you,” Tony’s grin is a little lopsided as he jabs  Steve on the chest, which he tries not to find adorable because the sub is pretty drunk.
There’s a commotion over by the bar and Rhodey’s head snaps around to seek out the source of the noise.
“Time to go Tones,” Rhodey says in his ear and tries to stop Tony from climbing him like a tree.  His best friend has always been tactile, but when he’s drunk he will try and fuck literally anyone.  He's used to it.
Alpha, which is just making Tony’s Fuck Propriety reflex go into overdrive. What he’s doing is asserting his own form of dominance and sending Steve a message that says Tony Stark is his own person, no matter how star spangled your ass is, Alpha or not.
It’s why he’s stuck here at another in a long line of military dinners where big deals are done, and fat, old men who have never served in the field get together to talk about things they know nothing about. Most of them have been handed their positions, a perk often afforded to sons of high ranking military men. The practice, equivalent to having heirs, but for military ranks, always makes Steve’s blood boil. None of these people know what it’s like to be on the front line, to be shot at, blown up, to sit in a foxhole in a freezing winter whilst the world goes to shit around you. They don’t know how it feels when one of your own dies in your arms, bleeding out into the snow. They don’t know how it feels when...No, he’s not doing this now, not here. These pompous fucks don’t deserve it. He just has to make nice for another couple of hours before he can politely leave and head back to Brooklyn and the sanctity of his apartment.  Just a few more hours...Maybe he could text Clint and Nat so they can come and rescue him under the pretence of an Avengers matter. He snorts a little at how ridiculous that sounds, even in his own head. He’s Captain America for fuck’s sake, he can handle another shitty military dinner.
“Steve, and no thank you, I'm good,” Pepper gives him a nod and goes back to her desk, leaving Steve with the view while he waits.  She sneaks little looks at him as she gets back to work, but he pays it no mind. It’s not the usual staring he gets, this is much more calculating, like she’s assessing a threat. Which he thinks is fair considering that she seems to essentially run Tony’s life.  He’s torn from the view when he hears a door swing open with a bang to his left and Tony comes striding out, apparently still on his call.
“I told her I needed a personal trainer, not assassination lessons,” Tony’s lips curve into a smirk.
Tony is nursing a sore shoulder and an even sorer ass after crashing through the roof of the garage when he got back from the suit’s maiden voyage (Howard is going to go fucking
“OK, let's do this right,” Tony says to the workshop at large. “Start mark, half a metre and to the right. DUM-E, you’re on standby for fire safety. U, roll it.” Tony takes a deep breath and gets into a stance he feels will be best.  “Activate hand controls. OK, we’re gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. In three...two...one…”
“Your visitor’s pass will give you access to most of the building, including the top floor where Mr Stark’s office is. Please make sure it’s visible at all times,” He hands Steve the pass, which he quickly clips to the pocket lip of his suit jacket.  “The elevator to the left behind me will take you directly to the penthouse level.”
And that’s how Tony starts to learn about yoga and meditation, something that he would never have tried before but which he is extremely glad to have discovered now. Gradually, he learns how to push his frustration when he’s sparring with Natasha into a box so that it doesn’t cloud his judgement. He even manages to land a few kicks on occasion, which surprises all three of them.  He feels his body getting stronger as the weeks go on and it feels good. He’s even sleeping better and eating properly rather than just surviving on coffee and cat naps.
“So you’re the famous Tony Stark,” Steve says,  eventually letting Tony’s hand go. The brunette notices the loss of heat.
Another finger is shoved in and Tony screams again as he feels something tear. The pain is blinding and there’s nothing he can do about it. He thinks he might be sick as he feels his asshole get wet not with lube, but with blood. His head swims as he fights down the bile and the panic, trying to get the hand that’s trapped between his hip and the wall out so that he can flail behind him, but the man sees it coming and stops shoving his finger inside Tony to grab his wrist before he can try and claw his face. That arm joins the first in being twisted behind him, and how fucking big are this guy’s hands that he can hold both of Tony’s arms behind him with just one hand?
“Don’t wait up for me honey,” Tony sing-songs as he leaves J.A.R.V.I.S in charge and heads upstairs to start getting ready.
This was my NaNo project for this year, and CH9 got me past my 50k goal, but it's being such a fucking bitch to write. I took a couple of days off writing when NaNo finished to see if that helped, but alas....
“No,” Tony sighs and gives up trying to solder the wires in front of him to finally meet his best friend’s eyes.  “Although, I'd pay good money to see that.”
The whole look has been finished off with a matching pale lilac pocket square and a pair of light tan dress shoes.  The colours are all surprisingly soft considering who happens to be wearing them, but Tony likes the way it makes him stand out like a beacon in a sea of harsh military greens and blues.  Rogers is sporting a full beard, which makes his gorgeous jaw look even more chiselled, and his dark blond hair is longer than usual and swept back off his face to fall in waves. Tony doesn’t want to use the word “Daddy” to describe the sight Rogers is projecting, but it’s difficult not to when he’s stood there looking like exactly that. Its...
“You heard me,” Tony never backs down from a fight, and he’s not about to start now with this douchebag. He sticks his chin out in defiance and turns away from the mirror to face his approaching potential attacker and squares his shoulders.  “I said fuck off.”
Right now he’s stuck at yet another dreadfully dull industry function that his father had told him (by fucking email) that he had to make an appearance at because there are lots of military bigwigs here and he had to to the schmoozing on behalf of SI. Urgh, all these assholes are the same: bloated, preening Doms in dress uniforms with too much meaningless metalwork gleaming on their chests, all butting heads for Tony’s attention with wandering hands and scotch on their breath. Tony hates it.
Tony watches the Captain, feels the warmth spreading through him further as those blue eyes drink him in, cataloging and gauging.  He thinks that he should feel unsettled, a little scared, but what he feels is pleased. It’s an unusual feeling for Tony, to feel as pleased as he does in the company of such an obviously powerful Dominant. It’s actually a little disconcerting, and Tony thinks it’s time he left.
, but somehow manages to not be imposing. He doesn’t loom like the other Dominants in the room, doesn’t need to. He exudes an aura that just screams Dominant without actually having to prove it. He just...
I'm getting frustrated,” Tony grunts as he gets his feet under him. And he is, it’s fucking irritating. He’s a fucking genius, why can’t he get this?  “You keep putting me on my ass and it’s pissing me the fuck off.”
The evening goes on much in the same way: Tony making jibes at Steve and the blond batting them right back him. He knows that Tony is testing the water, seeing how far he can push before Steve’s had enough. He isn’t counting on Steve’s endless patience, though, which means the Avenger is just thoroughly enjoying watching Tony try to push all his buttons. They’ve moved from the bar to one of the VIP booths, which is a lot more comfortable and a little quieter. As it’s on a raised platform at the side of the club, it affords them a view of the entire cavernous room, which settles Steve and his teammates more than standing by the bar does. This way, they can see all the exits and pretty much the whole club. There’s an intricate chrome railing that runs the length of the booth and Steve is leaning back against it, both elbows propped up behind him and a bottle of beer hanging between his fingers as he watches his team have fun with Tony and Rhodey. It makes a nice change and it calms something deep in his chest as he watches Clint, Nat and Sam relax and let loose. Feeling soft and affectionate, clambers over Sam to make his way over to Steve.
more fun that he says.”  Steve snorts at that and Tony turns to look at him.  “What’s so funny, Spangles?”
Tony feels something unclench in his stomach because yeah, that actually makes sense.  Steve may have been out of the ice for nearly a decade, but it’s pretty logical that he would hold on to some of the values he had from his past.
It also affected how i indentified within the BDSM world, having always been a switch up until that point. Since then, i've only ever been the Dominant one. So Steve in this fic is, more than likely, a bit of wish fulfillment on my part that one day i'll find someone similar. So please , all blond Adonis supersoliders, form an orderly queue.
“Well, well, what do we have here?” A drawl comes from the entrance to the bathroom and Tony’s eyes flick up in the mirror to see a wiry looking Dominant with short cropped dark hair and predatory eyes raking Tony up and down. He’s well built but not overly so, definitely bigger than Tony (who isn’t?) and the tight shirt isn’t doing anything to hide well muscled arms that Tony eyes warily.
“Thank you Katherine, i’d love one,” Steve smiles as Katherine comes around her desk and gestures to the enormous couch.  “A Doppio please, no sugar or cream.”
Except he wasn’t, not any more. Just frozen in time and ice until he’d been found and thawed, thrown 70 plus years into a future he didn’t know surrounded by strangers. About eight years ago, the Captain’s breakdown had been public knowledge the world over, it wasn’t a secret. He’d been public and raw about it, spoke about how he’d been broken because everything he knew was gone. His friends, his family, his submissive. He’d been bereft, alone, unanchored.  Tony had remembered being stunned as a young teen that a Dominant, an
“I’m always OK,” Tony pastes a smile on his face, but knows that Rhodey can see the dark circles under his eyes, the sag of his shoulders, and knows that he’s lying.
Steve just keeps leaning on the bar, his gaze on Tony never wavering. It’s not quite appraising, but it’s not entirely innocent either, and it’s making Tony’s skin itch, like his whole body is suddenly too tight. His brain supplies that maybe this is what it’s like to be in the space of an Alpha, to feel that sort of power, and Tony feels the fight just drain right out of him. Huh? How about that?
There had been talk when Tony was little about promising him to a Dom when he turned 21, but Maria had put her foot down over that. Her only son, only child in fact, was
Urgh..... I rewrote this chapter like, a bajillion times because i just wasn't happy with it. I'm still not, but it's about as good as it's going to get. Our boys are meeting again and i wanted so much for it to better than it turned out.
Tony could only hear Steve’s reply as he leaned his head forward taking more of Bucky into his mouth, sucking as he motioned back to repeat. “Yeah I got it Buck, doesn’t look too complicated.”
Bucky picked up the phone and Tony to lay them both over the arm of the sofa. How he did all and still managed to keep speaking with Steve, Tony didn’t know. Once he was settled, Bucky began moving in and out of Tony completely now, tempo picking up as much as the need to remain undiscovered would allow. Sparks lighting faster throughout his skin, Tony bit into the chair trying to keep his moans from spilling out.
Bucky trembled above Tony as he gripped his hips and leaned down to kiss him as a long low moan erupted from his mouth, it was the first time Bucky had ever kissed him. Tony couldn’t help but compare Bucky’s kiss to Steve’s as the soldiers tongue delved into his mouth. Where Steve was soft and sweet, Bucky was possessive and demanding. He kissed Tony as if it was his last chance to kiss anyone and he never wanted to stop, not even to breath. When Tony sucked on the tongue invading his mouth he pulled another moan from Bucky, as well as a more insistent thrust forward causing Tony to echo with a moan of his own.
Only after a few minutes of caveman-thoughts does Tony finally register, “Wait. Wait! You’re a—are you a
Tony giggles. “’Course I do. You were the cutest darn thing I’ve ever seen. Why’d you have to grow up to become such an ugly brute?”
“Okay, but if you broke your arm, what would that translate to in your dragon form? Like, would your arm be broken or would a wing be broken?”
. Peter is quietly sobbing into his shirt, a patch of wetness growing larger. Tony gestures for Natasha to join the hug, which she does without hesitance.
“How does—“ Sam is nearly doubled over in laughter. “You know what, I want to meet this guy. Anyone who doesn’t know who the prince is and still sticks around? A miracle!”
“Now, maybe. But do you remember those photos my Ma showed you when I brought you over for the first time?”
Their son had declared from now on, no more dragon shifters shall rule. This was a lie, of course. That son went on to marry another dragon shifter in private.
After a brief pause, they both burst out laughing. Tony leans down to kiss Steve before turning back around to return to his previous position. Steve “oof”s softly as Tony flops back over.
“Then he has to still be alive, right? Steve couldn’t—he wouldn’t just—“ Tony was grasping at straws. To the second stage he went.
He meets her in the kitchen, where she’s nursing a tea. Tony slumps into the bar stool next to her, letting out a deep sigh. Now, he didn’t really feel sad. He felt...
“Careful, Tony, you keep making excuses and I might think you’re a bit jealous,” Grant teases. He pushes DUM-E out of his lap before standing to full height.
Steve winces, and Tony isn’t sure if it’s from his reaction or from physical pain only being worsened by Tony’s vicelike grip. Steve presses a kiss to Tony’s hair.
The thought may seem cruel and selfish, but Prince Steven was anything but a ruthless man. Those who knew him knew he was a kind-hearted soul, and that he carried a warmth akin to the hearth of a fire—not only due to his friendly and welcoming nature, but also literally in sense of his draconic heritage.
Tony nods in acknowledgement, but says nothing else. He doesn’t let their shared silence settle for too long before he’s sliding out of his seat and slinking back to his room to lose himself in Steve’s scent. He wears an old, beat-up sweater of his to bed, and sleeps on his husband’s side, hugging the pillow close before finally letting out loud, pained sobs.
Tony scoffs. “Yeah, right. Those three are the dumbest little bastards I’ve had the opportunity to ever take care of. You sure you didn’t sneak them some food or anything? There’s no way they’d become so attached without food.”
It was nice, and Steve was thankful to have talked to Tony. As the time for the prince to become king grew nearer and nearer, he became less and less unrecognizable over time. To find someone with no clue who he was had been a breath of fresh air. He had recognized the woman at Tony’s home, however—she was Virginia “Pepper” Potts, a royal advisor. Steven had not realized that that was where she would be staying on her time off. It was one of the reasons he was off so quickly.
“Ah,” his father acknowledges with a well-intentioned nod. “Well, you see, son, it is nothing a little patience and a good ear cannot accomplish. I have no doubt you will get here one day, too.”
“’Want Pops,” he whimpers, and Tony’s heart breaks. He had hoped Peter would never have to go through something like this. Something so painful. Something that would kill Peter’s constantly upbeat and positive mood. His endless supply of care and love to those near to him. Something that would
Tony snorts. “I’m rarely anywhere else. Might have to get off my property soon, though. I wouldn’t want to have to take this to the king.”
Rhodey tells him the same thing about getting out and making friends, to which Tony rolls his eyes. He didn’t see why needed more friends—he was functioning just fine. Tony doesn’t mention Grant to Rhodey.
His eyes are closed tight when he comes within touching distance of the dragon, afraid he’d have to witness his own hand being chomped clean off. Normally, when interacting with bigger dragons, Tony had no issue since he had essentially parented those dragons since they were still in eggs. This wild encounter, however, had him undoubtedly nervous.
“You have to come to the kingdom for this, Tony. It’s important,” Pepper insists. She’s delivering him her patented
“See you,” Tony smiles, before tilting Steve’s chin down to plant another kiss on his lips. “Love you.”
Steve smiles, opening his mouth to say something when they hear glass crashing as it hits the floor. They both snap their heads in the direction of the noise to see Clint standing dumbfounded in the kitchen, gaping at Steve.
Tony hums. He knew what that was like—it was the reason he started working with the creatures he did. The family business was too much to handle, and there was far too much pressure he didn’t need resting on his shoulders. So, he had up and left, and moved out to the forest where he built himself a nice cottage, and started caring for creatures of all kinds he managed to stumble upon in his walk of life.
His father, King Joseph, was making an announcement of sorts. About what, Steven couldn’t tell. While he did have the kingdom’s best interests at heart, his father had a tendency to be repetitive. The kingdom didn’t seem to mind, though. As long as they were safe, happy, and treated equally—which Steven’s parents ensured.
Tony snorts. “No shit. I thought the royal family were all supposed to be human as of several hundred years ago.”
Tony leads Grant to the house, the latter looking around in awe. Tony finds it somewhat odd, as his homey little cottage wasn’t really much to look at, but to each their own, he supposed.
an override access code for when Tony was stowed away was Steve. And since Steve was... Tony wouldn’t have anyone to interfere with his work binge. It was likely he’d work himself to a point of exhaustion, and JARVIS would have to let up locking everyone out for his own good. Something Steve had introduced to JARVIS as a means of looking after Tony.
offer. But who would he be to turn it down? To soar above the treetops, and feel wind rushing past as graceful wings glide along? No
Tony blushes and tries to hide his growing smile by stuffing his face with bread. Grant shakes his head, clearly amused.
That was how Steven ended up in the knights’ quarters, hoping his friend Sam wasn’t quite asleep yet.
Steve reaches across his desk to put a comforting hand over Tony’s. He knew how much Tony would rather keep this under wraps, at least for now. “No, she doesn’t. And she won’t. Not until we’re ready. Until
“That’s—wow,” Tony was embarrassingly speechless in front of this beautiful man. He holds out a hand in offer of a handshake this time. “I’m Tony.”
Tony. Besides, I need a date for the ball afterwards, and James is on guard duty all night, so he’s unavailable. Please, Tony. Just this once.”
“Would you, um,” Tony’s cheeks heated, “would you mind if I asked some questions? I just—I’ve never met a dragon shifter before, and I—I’m curious.”
Tony doesn’t actively seek Grant out per se, but he does, on occasion, venture back into the forest to
Tony itched to write down his observations, but alas, he had left his notebook at the house. Whether or not he’d have thought to take it, Pepper would have snatched it from his grasp and tell him about not needing to cart around a journal when visiting with people.
Tony walks out his front door to see Grant laying in the grass getting “attacked” by the hatchlings. He’s laughing, obviously unbothered by their nips and fire breathing as they climb over him. Tony watches on fondly—the sight was quite adorable.
The door creaks open, and Steven hears, “Man, I swear, there better not be—oh. Hey, Steve. What’s up?”
Natasha sits him and Peter down on the couch, and almost immediately Tony is brought back to the day Obie sat him down to inform him his parents were dead. A sense of dread sets in his stomach. Regardless of whether or not Obie betrayed him, Tony
Tony couldn’t care less that the prince—Steven, or something like that—was finally being crowned king. Tony was just upset that he wouldn’t be seeing Grant for the next while because he was, well. Busy. Grant hadn’t elaborated, but the dragon shifter was rather elusive when it came to what he did for a living. Tony couldn’t blame him, though, as Tony had his own things he wouldn’t talk about.
Steven stumbles across the grass in front of the house as he shifts midair to keep his momentum as he ran towards the house—never mind that he was nude as the day he was born.
Grant shakes his head. “I would have to walk on it, which would make it worse. Flying would get too tiring after a while.”
Steven is afraid Tony isn’t going to answer after he waits for what felt like an eternity, but then the door swings open to reveal Tony, who looked plain awful. There were dark bags under his eyes, and it appeared as if his hair hadn’t been brushed for days.
They had gone to the kitchen but unfortunately had forgo the snacks as they had stopped making a habit out of stealing food a night long ago when they had been caught by the king, and the chefs were no longer leaving out food they knew would be “stolen.” Thankfully Sam had been joking about it.
JARVIS informs Tony when he has reached twenty-four, then thirty-six, then forty-eight hours of no sleep. Tony tunes it out from there, finally passing out on his workshop couch around the ninety-six hour mark.
“”Grant” is a dragon that you named. I don’t know if you forgot, but dragons can’t talk. Grant doesn’t count,” Pepper sighs. “Tomorrow. Noon. Be ready.”
“Nothing much. The usual.” The corners of his lips quirk upwards, but he bites back his ‘portrait smile,’ as his mother would call it. “Just wondering how you pull it off so well.”
He surveys the room for Steven. As much as he wanted to march up to the man and slap him, Tony knew that would be the worst thing to do in a room full of knights guarding the room and king himself. Slapping Steven would probably end up in decapitation. Unless, of course, Steven intervened. However, Tony was not chancing this.
Tony exaggerates a huff. “Fine. You win. I came to tell you about a new project, as well as get an update on the current one. We need to update a few of our designs. Alter them to best suit the interests of international markets. Cultural differences and whatnot. You know the drill.”
Tony had never met a dragon shifter before. They seemed rare, nowadays, since the war of kingdoms once upon a time.
Peter waves a hand, standing and heading for the door. He pauses a second, to look back at Tony. “I’m going to call Ned.”
There’s a tear trailing down Natasha’s cheek, but she schools her expression well. She’s currently holding Peter’s hand, rubbing a careful thumb over in comfort. She smiles sadly at the two of them. “I—“
“Of what house?” Tony asks. He himself had been a noble once, but alas. Tony Stark just had to be a disappointment.
So later, when Peter finally cries himself to sleep as Tony comforts him, Tony slips out of the room for a moment to get more information from Natasha.
Tony sighs, tucking his head under Steve’s chin, curling himself further into his fiancé’s chest. He draws abstract patterns on Steve’s pec whilst listening to the calming, steady beat of his heart as Steve gently cards his fingers through dark brown hair.
They remain quiet for several minutes following, swaying gently as Tony continues to hold onto Steve with all his might.
The sun had set minutes before, the stars beginning to dot the night sky. Pepper might start getting worried about his whereabouts, but he himself was in no hurry. Talking to Grant all afternoon had been enjoyable and interesting. The man was pretty open to answering Tony’s questions about dragon shifters, and in turn Tony would tell him stories about the creatures in his care. Grant listened to him with awe as he described the animals—both magical and non-magical. Tony felt pleased and a little bit prideful, but an unfamiliar, unidentifiable feeling had also been nagging at him.
“So what’s the matter?” Sam asks him once they’re far from the castle and engulfed in darkness, the only light being the moon shining down from a clear sky.
He sets a steaming cup of tea in front of Grant, the plate of food in the centre of the table, and sits with his own cup and saucer. Grant thanks him, lifting the cup to his lips with the elegance and manners of someone who had most definitely been trained to drink tea that way. Tony watches—stares, more like it—and Grant smiles shyly at him when he catches Tony’s eye.
“Nothing. I was... nothing,” Tony huffs. He begins trudging towards the house, but not before asking, “How are the hatchlings doing?”
“Sleeping with the...” Pepper is puzzled, brows drawn as she tries to think of a logical reason for this answer. “What are you talking about, Tony?”
“’S not your fault,” Peter consoles dejectedly. He then moves to sit up, and swing his legs over the side of the bed. Tony notices he’s wearing a shirt way too large for him, a shirt that obviously belonged to Steve. If Tony could recall correctly, Steve had given this one specifically to their son as a sort of hand-me-down since Peter had had an obsession with too-big shirts, and Peter had ended up converting it into a sleepshirt.
Tony wasn’t quite overwhelmed walking into the ballroom, as it most certainly wasn’t his first time, but he still felt out of place. Though it wasn’t his first time, it had still been awhile.
Tony shrugs noncommittally. “Good question. Maybe if you, I dunno, send a few more of those lovely comments my way...”
Tony is ready to play the defensive when he discovered that, no, the elevator was not in fact broken, but there was shuffling echoing out into the empty room. Like a limp, it sounded. The sound of a duffle dropping to the ground follows, before more rustling and movement. Really, it kind of sounded like someone coming home drunk—and Tony had his fair share of that experience.
He feels a tug at his shirt, and sees that one of the hatchlings has latched its jaw onto the material. He swats at the small dragon, shaking his head exasperatedly.
Tony decides to change the topic instead. “So I see the hatchlings have taken quite the liking to you.”
How could he had just left Peter alone right now? God, he was such an awful father. What would Steve say?
The knight eyes him skeptically, but steps aside without another word. Tony could sense the question that was likely on the man’s mind, but Tony doesn’t wait to hear it aloud. He stomps up to Steven, shoving aside the maidens. The king looks surprised to see him.
Sam wipes nonexistent tears from his eyes as his laughing calms, and Steven frowns. The only reason he was consulting with Sam was because, not only did he know Steven was a dragon shifter, but he was also one of his closest friends and trustees—Sam wouldn’t tell anyone about the family secret nor his encounter that day.
Pepper doesn’t ask any more questions about Grant for the rest of her stay, and he doesn’t mention anything further. Rhodey visits a few days after Pepper leaves for the kingdom, what with being royal advisor to the king and all. She always insists she could get him a job and place at the castle, but he always tells her he’s more than content to be where he is.  Even if that was in the middle of the forest, away from everyone.
“Tony, wake up. You need to eat,” a soft voice followed by gentle pokes come. Tony groans and curls away from the touch.
a bad parent. Not even close. You’re the best father anyone could ask for. I’m sure Peter would say the same.”
Steven does get clothing—stuff he had left at the house on previous visits—and sits at the dining table with Tony.
With that, Pepper turns and leaves, and Tony slumps into a dining chair. Why her expectations for him were so high, he wasn’t sure. All he could do was listen, attend a crowning of some high-and-mighty prince, then attend the ball following. One day, then he would not have to travel back into the kingdom against his wishes for the next while. Not to mention, he doubted he would reach the crowning of the king after Prince Steven, so
He wanted to know as well. At first, sure, he kept his identity secret because he wanted a relationship without preconception, but after gaining trust over so long—why
“I’m very well, thank you,” Steve responds warmly. “What brings you down here, my amazing, spectacular, wonderful boss and boyfriend?”
Tony wished he had her strength and ability to reach acceptance. It was already hard enough Steve Rogers, Captain America, Tony’s
The tea and food is immediately abandoned as the two men push away from the table and gravitate towards each other. Lips crash together and desperate hands run through hair and under clothing. Tony directs them towards his bedroom in messy, misguided steps, the two laughing when they accidentally bump into the wall next to the door. Clothes are discarded and strung along their path, and their breaths are hot and heavy and intermingled.
“Mission went south,” Natasha starts, staring intently at her drink. Tony is kind of glad she decides not to meet his gaze—that might make it feel more real, and that was the last thing Tony wanted. It was certainly what he needed, however.
Pepper stays silent. She gets up off the couch, a sad expression on her face as she watches over Tony, who is still shrunk in on himself. At the door of the workshop, she tells him, “They found his shield, by the way. It’s in the common room. Everyone thought to leave that to you. Though, there’s an equal chance Peter has it with him in his room. Now, get something in you to eat for me, alright?”
Steven’s mouth bobs open and shut like a fish out of water, obviously uncomfortable and unsure of what to say. Seeing as Steven didn’t know the answer himself yet, Tony walks away, out of the castle, off to his horse, and he goes home.
“No! Well, yes and no,” Steven worries his bottom lip—he seems rather anxious to be discussing this so out in the open. “You’re not royalty, and on top of that, you can’t produce an heir.”
Steven returns a quick smile before stalking off to his chambers. He requests a bath be drawn for him, simply to busy the servants. Sometimes they could be rather nosy, and Steven would rather not word of his mini-adventure get out.
Tony jumps, and suddenly being on this end of the dragon seemed ten times scarier. He offers out a hand as a sign of peace, stepping closer to (hopefully) pet the dragon. The creature eyes his hand, almost
Tony brings Grant to the kitchen and sits him at the table. Tony busies himself around the kitchen, making tea and gathering an assortment of other snacks—other snacks being cheese and bread. Grant sits quietly, a polite guest. He attempts to offer help, but Tony refuses to let him.
“You can’t keep eating my shirts, you know. It’s not good for you,” Tony tuts the hatchling. The dragon blinks up at him before finding interest in a butterfly floating about just a few feet away. Tony snorts. Hatchlings and their short attention spans. It never failed to both amuse and intrigue Tony.
“Why would I want to spend time with someone who doesn’t like these cuties?” Tony coos at the hatchling trying to climb into his lap. He scratches the underside of the dragon’s chin, the animal in turn emitting a low growling noise similar to a cat’s purr.
After he left, Tony put on another movie but couldn’t stay focused. His mind kept trying to find solutions to his current issues causing his attention to stray. It was only a few moments before he began to feel just mentally exhausted. Needing to settle his thoughts, Tony rose to go to bed not shortly after Bucky. AS he stood, Tony noticed Bucky’s journal had slipped out of his pocket on the sofa. During his Shield mandated therapy sessions, Bucky was told to keep track of his flashbacks and try piecing together the memories. Knowing how closely Bucky guarded the small book, Tony retrieved it before making his way to Bucky’s room.
Shaking his head Bucky said, “That will take too long, the book said to start these exercises within 5 minutes of that first one. We’d have to start all over by the time you came back.”
Steve lasted another 5 minutes under Tony’s assault. The sensations Tony and Bucky were giving him finally drove the man over the edge and he groaned before collapsing on top of Tony. Bucky had stopped thrusting not long after as he came as well for the first time. He peppered the back of Steve’s neck with kisses giving words of praise at how good Steve was and how much Bucky loved him. Tony lay underneath him kissing his shoulders and rubbing Steve’s side as he came down from his orgasm. After a moment he slid off Tony, arms wrapping around his torso to embrace him tightly. Bucky gave Steve a wet towel after wiping the traces of his cum, obviously knowing Tony would rather be cleaned up by him, before lying on Steve’s other side.
Less than a month later everything changed, and Tony can say with complete certainty that for once it was
He closed his eyes as Bucky began rolling his hips, barely slipping out of Tony but merely shifting his cock around. As the movements sparked small tendrils of pleasure inside him, Tony did his best to think of Steve and picture the blonde doing this to him. He lost track of time in his fantasy, had no idea how long Bucky teased him with the short deliberately slow thrusts. Not wanting to give him the pleasure of knowing just how good he was making Tony feel, even though the slow ember had raged early to an inferno through his body, Tony did his best to keep silent. Only the occasionally gasp and whimper escaped his lips but unfortunately he was unable to control the near constant shivers traveling through his limbs.
Nat chuckled minutely, to which one of their responses Tony wasn’t for sure but it was probably both. She was polishing her knives in the lounge chair next to them while Clint lay across the back of it tossing a ball in the air. “Gonna have to agree with Stark on that one,” she said looking up to smirk at Steve while she worked, “No one answers the question ‘What do you like to do for fun?’ with ‘Work out’.”
“You’re right. I know it’s unacceptable and Tony does to.” Though he didn’t take his eyes from furious woman in front of him, Tony saw Steve lean forward from the corner of his eye. “It’s also unacceptable for me to let an angry, unstable Domme anywhere near my sub.” Steve then slowly turned away from Nat to face him. “Tony these are your friends, your family, and you’ve hurt them. Stop fighting just because you can and tell them what you’ve been dying to say since yesterday.”
Bucky broke Tony’s concentration when he stopped moving and his hands began traveling down Tony’s chest then up to rest against his thighs. Bucky’s voice was low with arousal as he stared with lust filled eyes down at Tony. “God Tony, Stevie told me your ass was addictive, pure fucking sin is more like it.” Tony grew even more heated at his words as Bucky pushed down at the inside of Tony’s knees bringing his ass up slightly off the bed. “Gonna break you open for me, split you wide. Maybe you’ll be the one that can finally take every inch.”
Bucky smirked as his eyes grew hooded, fucking himself into Tony grasp when he saw Steve’s cock jump slightly as his lips parted in arousal. ‘Yep’, Bucky thought, ‘Theory proved’ as he answered, “That’s 12 inches you’re wrapped around sugar. Why, is Stevie not this big?” When Tony gave a second chuckle saying no, he saw Steve’s cock pulse again as his breathing became more labored. “Sorry sweetheart, where does he stop at compared to me?” Tony stroked his dick once more before coming up and stopping an inch above halfway. Bucky’s grin was wide as he looked at Steve laughing softly, “Well we can’t all have the huge packaging I come with.”
Once Bucky had finished his cataloging he began focusing on brushing against Tony’s hot spots. The shivers that were wracking across his body began to be accompanied by the whimpers Tony couldn’t contain anymore. Reaching down Tony gripped both cheeks of Bucky’s ass trying to get him to actually fuck him instead just giving Tony the torturously slow grinds the he had been. The super soldier wouldn’t be budged though, and continued the slow paced circular grinds in Tony, only barely slipping out of the man beneath him. Frustrated Tony let out a throaty groan and looked up pleadingly at Bucky. “Please, God Bucky just fuck me already. Give me more, I need more, damn you…
The last few months were heaven for Bucky. He’d finally gotten everything he wanted, but there was never really a question in his mind that he wouldn’t. He loved being able to go out with Tony, showing everyone how much he owned his little engineer. Even when they went out with Steve, Bucky always kept Tony close so there’d be no doubt in anyone’s mind. He knew inherently, in the back of his mind, that he owned Tony like no one else. Tony would never have done half of the things Bucky had drew him into doing if he didn’t. Bucky had set this morning’s scene up with Stevie before he woke the smaller man that had lain between them. He’d told Steve some of the things he would say to Tony, and had even told Steve how much he’d get off on it. Bucky didn’t think the humiliation would make Stevie hot enough to cum without anyone touching him but it shouldn’t have surprised Bucky.
Steve looked remorseful as he face fell, “I’m sorry Buck, maybe you can just get in with the clothes you have on?”
Steve took Tony’s hands in his saying, “If you’re ok with it, I wanted to tell him to come to our room when he can’t sleep. I’m hoping having someone nearby will help him, but I’ll only do that if it’s something you’re comfortable with it.”
It had not even been 12 hours yet but Tony already missed Bucky. He knew it was going to be hell going from Bucky taking Tony at least twice a day to whenever they could find the alone time. With his mind on that thought, Tony was overjoyed when Steve came down to his lab and gave him the best news. “Tony, I need to ask you a favor. You don’t have to say yes, but I need you to promise you’ll at least think about it.”
Tony’s days begin to quickly fill with him as well. Seeing as Bucky was now his sparring partner and massage therapists, Bucky began pushing Tony for more and more interactions regardless of Steve being there.
“Yeah sugar, fuck if I don’t love the way you moan taking my dick.” Steve heard Bucky say, at this point he’s pretty sure he was the only one that heard it. Tony looked lost and completely wrecked. Steve had never seen his body quake like it was doing now or heard him moan so much and so loud before. The smaller man had always been so quiet when he was with Steve, only whimpering occasionally before moaning Steve’s name before he came. But now, Steve wasn’t aware those sounds could be drawn from Tony or the guttural cry Tony made as he finally came.
Tony looked at Bucky as he reached the door and said, “I think I hate you a little for what you’ve done to me.”
Tony stood up giving Steve a questioning look as he did the same. “What do you mean? If anything people are better. We’re a lot more open and way less judgmental, I’d think things were simpler now to do than back then.”
Vision immediately drawn to Bucky’s arm Steve reached out to draw the Bicep into his hand. “That’s not good, can’t have you disabled in a fight. I’ll call Tony to see if he can take a look at it.”
Tony sat in Bucky’s lap at the kitchen table under their massage pretense listening to Steve make pasta in the kitchen. He spoke over the bar giving the latest update of what was going on at the Avenger’s compound. Tony’s sweats were pulled down just under his ass as he gave Bucky the ‘dance’ he asked for. Tony had his arms taking his weight leaning over the table while Bucky leaned back in his chair hands at Tony’s shoulder. Glancing over, Tony saw Bucky’s eyes entranced in his lap, watching Tony roll ass up arching his back before coming around to arch the opposite way.
“Fuck, Ah, sorry I have to ram him like this Stevie, but he really needs it. Steve hasn’t been getting in there deep as I am has he, Tony?” Tony’s yells ricocheted off the walls, unable to form coherent sentences and acknowledge any of Bucky’s questions. “Yeah, think I’ll take care of this for Tony when he needs it from now on Steve. He’s probably in pain from so much time not getting worked here right. I’ll make sure to work into him every day, keep pushing in over and over till he can’t take anymore. We can’t have Tony hurting, he definitely needs to be hammered this deep by me all the time, since I’m the only one that can get all the way in him.”  Bucky slammed Tony down to meet each thrust. Tony’s face was to the ceiling with his eyes closed, back arching his ass towards Bucky moaning with each thrust, “Don’t think you’re fitted out to touch down half as far in Tony as I am right now. Your body won’t let you get this far Stevie, you’re just not made to bang away at him like I plan to every day. Am I right Tony, do you need me to nail into you everyday instead of Steve?”
Apologize… Beg for forgiveness? He wasn’t sure what he was going to do but knew he needed to find his boyfriend as quickly as possible.
The movie lasted less than 20 more minutes before finally ending. As the credits began to roll, Bucky stood and stretched his arms high before looking back to Tony. “Gonna call it a night, see you in the morning sweetheart.”
The look on the Dom’s face drew Tony out of his thoughts. Though Steve looked both angry and remorseful, his words were calm, only slightly marked by what he was feelings. “I… I’m so sorry Tony, I had no idea baby. If I had… I would never have let you feel this way, not for one more moment.”
When Bucky and Tony walked into the training room to see Steve already there, fists hitting the punching bag Tony made for him, Bucky turned to Tony giving a devilish grin. Tony knew exactly what that look meant and was ashamed to say he began to get turned on. It seemed as if for the past few days Bucky only wanted to fuck him if Steve was present. Though Tony didn’t want his boyfriend finding out about them, Bucky stoked fires through him with each performance until Tony began looking forward to these moments.
Thanks for the comments and kudos, I really appreciate it!!! Everyone literally like gives me life! ☺️
Bucky tilted his head to Steve laughing lightly as well. “Yeah, I probably owe you another 4 years of Tony gushing before we’re even.” Tony had a hard time swallowing as Bucky’s eyes came back to him while he shrugged saying, “As for the other, can’t help it if I was good at giving them everything they never knew they wanted. It’s a blessing and a curse.”
Tony murmured, “No problem,” from where he stood, still reeling from the decisions being made around him. He turned a glare a Bucky as soon as Steve closed the door to the bathroom to which the other man just laughed at. He asked Tony what was wrong as he continued to laugh in Tony’s direction. “Oh I don’t know, maybe the fact that I don’t want to stop fucking you for any period of time let alone a month. Why the fuck did you agree to that?”
Steve face gave Bucky an image of complete confusion. “What do you mean? It can’t be that different person to person right?”
“Of course, attention junky here, needing attention,” Tony deadpanned as he looked up tiredly at Steve giving him puppy dog eyes. Pointing at his shoulders he told Steve, “I specifically need attention here.”
After Bucky’s “threesome” with them, he never really left their bed. It became common place to find him fucking Tony against the wall or sucking Steve off at the kitchen table. After about a month he became the dominant part in their relationship not even allowing Steve to touch Tony in any capacity without his permission. They went on dates together and separately. It was mostly just Tony and Bucky as Steve was still apart of SHIELD. Bucky had opted out choosing a ‘consultant’ status alongside Tony, only taking missions when they had no one else. Tony reveled in their alone time, loving having Bucky’s full attention on him. The team had even welcomed the change seeing how happy it made all three men.
The next 3 days passed for Tony in a chaotic blur. Waking in Bucky’s bed hours later, Tony couldn’t believe what he had done. Guilt at cheating on Steve weighed heavily on him, but heat settled low in his groin as well feeling Bucky’s body clutching his. Tony’s endeavor to sneak out of the room proved unsuccessful when Bucky woke as well laying Tony on his back. He wished he could say he put up a fight, that he did anything at all to stop the man, but Tony didn’t. He stayed there and let Bucky do whatever he wanted as long as he was filling Tony again. Bucky drove into him, taking Tony to the ecstasy he sent him to the night prior.
NaTasha was the Dom older sister Tony never knew he wanted. Being a level 7 Dom, she had traits of both Service and Authoritative Dom levels. She liked to massage Tony’s neck when he was tired on movie nights, lulling him to sleep, but also wouldn’t hesitate to lightly slap the man’s arm in annoyance when he was being difficult.
Tony lifted his head reaching back to grab Bucky’s hips and stop the movement so he could speak. He should have known Bucky wouldn’t comply completely, but the movements did slow giving Tony time between fire lighting over his body. “I … Sorry Steve, um… I didn’t catch that.”
Steve smiled bringing both of Tony’s hands up in his own, placing a kiss on each one. “Thank you baby, I know you don’t care but… Well I’m not being unselfish either,” Steve started blushing as he continued on, “I love the feeling of being with you Tony, I figure if it’s something I can fix to help you enjoy making love to me more then I’ll do whatever it takes.”
Bucky gave Tony a heated once over as he made the few steps bringing him back to Bucky’s side. “Thought we’d go through a few stretches first, then try to loosen him up a little more some exercises in the hot tub. There are a few positions I’ve been dying to try on Tony, see if he’s flexible enough to apply to our daily workout routines.” He answered nodding at the large circular pool in the corner a few feet away. Bucky gave Steve an arrogant smile saying, “There were some wall stretches in the book you gave me that I want to try out on him first though, Should help me work my way through Tony’s tightest muscles before we really start going at it in the water. The outline said it’d worked best with a partner, I’ll talk you through the motions to see if you can handle a few in case I’m ever gone.”
Steve gave a light chuckle as he said, “Hmph,” eyes gazing through Tony’s own. “Pretty sure I made that plain last night, but I’ll repeat it since you were… Out of sorts.” Turning sideways, Steve curled one leg and arm around Tony’s waist and slid him closer. Tony’s legs were pulled over to rest on top of the one Steve had on the ground, an arm curling around them as well to hold them there. When Tony gave a startled cry at the movement Steve just smiled lightheartedly back at him, leaning his head towards Tony’s. “There that’s better, have to say I like you in my lap a lot more though.” Tony just rolled his eyes at the statement. Steve’s fingers caressed his hair as he asked softly. “Why were you angry and jealous last night Tony?”
His cock hardened thinking about how his “ass cramps” had flared up yesterday. Bucky and Tony had been naked from the waist down as Bucky had called Steve into the living room. He’d had Tony’s back over the back of the couch holding Tony’s legs open as he leaned over him kneeling on the cushions. Bucky had Steve hold Tony’s legs saying he couldn’t ram him as hard as he needed trying to hold them himself. Tony was given the okay to cum once Bucky had maneuvered him into Steve’s arms to be held up. He’d wrapped his arms Bucky’s neck, moaning loudly into his ear as Bucky whispered how much better he fucked Tony than Steve did. Bucky had groaned loudly and Tony screeched as Bucky pinched his balls semi painfully. His thrust slowed to a crawl as he began spewing false apologies to Steve saying he’d accidently slipped inside Tony.
Bucky had been tormenting Tony for the past 2 hours since they went to bed. They’d all stripped bare, except for Steve who was still wearing his boxers and crawled into bed. Bucky maneuvered them to their current positions saying he’d work Tony slowly to see if that helped lessen repeats of Tony’s ‘cramping’ muscles. Since then he’d been slowly driving Tony into madness, causing an inferno of sensations first sparkling, before increasing to a massive blaze across Tony’s skin.
Steve chuckled out a groan saying, “uh, I’ll never be able to see that movie again without getting a hard on. Thanks for that.” He leaned down again as he kissed Tony before his expression grew more serious. “I know you love me and want to make me happy, but I don’t want you to say yes unless it’s something that will make
Tony watched as he fled with both shock and amusement. Chuckling softly he turned to Steve asking, “Do I even wanna know the murder look you gave that guy to make him high tail it like that. It would be sad if it wasn’t so hilarious.” He wanted to be angry at the other man, but Tony was past Tipsy on his way to drunk so laughter won out.
While Tony was too far gone to really take in Bucky’s words, he knew Steve understood exactly what he was saying when a stilted whimper reached Bucky’s ears from his direction. It took everything in him not to react and turn his eyes toward the sound. As Tony’s nose pressed against his abdomen, Bucky’s hand clasped the back of his neck. A shiver rolled its way through him when Bucky’s thumb grazed Tony’s throat and could feel himself protruding out with each glide down Tony made.
Steve reached out a hand to him with a smile. “Your ears must be burning, we were just talking about you.”
Rising Bucky lent a hand to help Steve over to sit where he had on the bed beside Tony.  Standing in front of both men Bucky looked to Steve saying, “Alright, I think I may know what’s needed here but let me try a couple things first if that’s ok?” At Steve’s nod Bucky continued looking to Tony as he kneeled down and spread his legs further, smirking as he saw Tony’s breathing become rapid from just that touch, body growing more aroused even though there was a look of resentment on his face. “For this to work Tony, I’m gonna need you to talk to me doll, okay? Let me and Stevie know how everything I’m doing feels.”
Bucky took Tony’s hand to pull him across the short distance toward the training room wall in front of Steve. “Yeah you’re fine right there to see everything I’m doing to Tony.” Tony’s face flushed brightly at Bucky’s words as his dick sprang to full attention in record breaking time. He was maneuvered with his back to the wall in front of Bucky, unable to view behind the man to Steve just a few feet away. “I may need you to help me put him in the positions I want him in.” Tony shook his head no, eyes widening up at Bucky who just smirked down at him. “I’ll let you know if we need the help Stevie, I know I can handle this first one ok. For now you can just watch and learn.”
Tony had grown numb to the pain in his chest from Steve and Bucky, had managed to talk to Bucky more casually without feeling to jealous. He’d even been able to fall asleep after Steve would sneak out their room on the nights he’d designated to spend with Tony only to spend them with Bucky instead. He knew if he told Steve how he felt the man would make himself unhappy just to make Tony happy, so Tony kept quiet. He was used to hiding his feelings so it wasn’t a hard thing to do, and when they were alone together Tony honestly was happy, even if those times weren’t often. Bucky still took up the majority of Steve’s time, but Tony couldn’t complain when Steve was getting everything he got from Tony from him as well as great sex whenever he wanted it.
Giving Bucky a hundred watt grin of appreciation Steve cupped Tony’s cheek in his palm as he leaned down to give him a kiss on the forehead. “I’ll be right in the next room sweetheart. Just yell if you need me.”
Voice sounding thick and rasping Steve asked, “What’s wrong, why’d you stop? You’re not done are you?”
Tony was on edge. He rushed through finishing what he was doing trying his hardest to keep from looking down. The sweat pants Bucky was wearing although loose fitting had pulled tight as he sat, molding them around his legs to outline his cock where it rested. Try as he might, Tony could help but notice the length and thickness, mind stuttering around the fact it wasn’t even hard and still that large. Bucky was right about one thing, Tony had an active imagination that was running full speed with all the things that cock could do to him.
The reasoning that brought Tony to this moment, lying under Steve as he fucked Tony while Bucky held Steve’s hips driving into him above them both, Tony realized at that moment was complete insanity on his part. Tony stared into Steve’s face, seeing the man absolutely wrecked from the dual sensations. He squeezed around Steve’s dick, causing the man to groan loudly saying Tony and Bucky’s names. Knowing that he was a part of driving Steve to this point was the only thing keeping him hard. Tony was nowhere near coming but was trying his hardest to focus on Steve and enjoy the man being in him.
Tony was lying on his back between Steve’s legs, his eyes fluttering every few seconds as he looked up at Bucky making sobbed whimpers and moans. Bucky was holding Tony up by his knees, bringing their body’s together at an agonizingly slow pace. Steve was lying flat mirroring Tony at the top of the bed, while Bucky sat in his lap. Tony guessed Steve’s view was of Bucky’s completely naked body rolling his hips forward, with Tony’s legs outstretched on each side as Bucky’s hands held them up.
Tony mind began to grow fuzzy at the words, slight buzzing coming to his ears as he felt as if he was falling into a cloud. His words were slurred as he said, “Yes… God, yes Steve. Whatever you want.”
Steve looked down at Tony, eyes still hazy with desire when both of them were surprised by Bucky’s voice. “Come here Stevie.”
Bucky grabbed Steve’s hand, dragging it along Tony’s abdomen until he stopped and pressed down. Steve felt his breath catch and his dick twitch trying to show interest from what he felt. “He feels so good Stevie; don’t know why you’re not inside him every minute of every day.” As Bucky pulled his own hand back to grip Tony’s hips to drive in harder, Steve moaned along with Tony. He felt his cock begin to harden as felt Bucky’s cock pushing against the skin below his hand.  “I’m so deep inside him, God I wish you could feel how tight he is when you’re this deep inside him. Can tell no one’s fucked him down this far, feels like a fucking virgin around the last few inches of my cock. Uhhh, fuck if he were mine I’d have him sitting on my cock all day every day, just keeping it warm until I’m ready to fuck him again. Ahh yeah, you’d like that wouldn’t you baby? You want to sit with me inside you, filling you up like this every day.”
Turning his head and groaning ashamed into the pillow Steve said, “So because it’s my birthday both my boyfriends have to go to bed with a hard on?”
Tony had taken him all the way down before using a hand to add Bucky’s balls to his mouth as well. “Bucky, are you okay?” Steve exclaimed and Tony saw Bucky raise a hand quickly to stop the other man’s movement toward him.
Steve realized these past few weeks he had been neglecting Tony. He loved him so much it hurt, but he loved Bucky to. Coupled with the fact that he had just got Bucky back after so long and the fact Tony wasn’t as into sex and Steve was, he’d been with Bucky far more since they all got together than he had with Tony. Even Bucky had brought it to his attention, that Tony had been spending way more time in his lab than he was in the penthouse most days. He had been pushing Steve to fix things once they noticed the man had become an acquaintance passing through instead of a resident. Even though he tried to hide it, both soldiers saw the slight uneasiness he had around them every once in a while.
It had been four days, four long excruciatingly sex deprived lonely nights, since Tony had said yes to Steve. Why was Tony sex deprived when he had the epitome of everything a sub could want in a Dom? Well, that was because Steve my middle name is chivalry Rogers refused to take Tony to bed. The only thing that had changed in their relationship was that Steve had grown slightly… Ok, a better word would probably be enormously, possessive of Tony. Other than that, nothing had really changed. Steve had pretty much already been treating Tony like his sub for months without the actual titles.
Steve snorted from behind Tony. “It’s not to know I’m so appreciated. I knew you only loved me for my hands.”
Chuckling Steve gave Tony a kiss thank you before leaving to tell Bucky. He didn’t know what Bucky was up to, but Tony couldn’t wait to find out.
Tony grew even more turned on as he was moved to lay beneath Bucky with his legs spread. He saw Bucky sit back on his feet, knees spreading to cradle around Tony’s body. Leaning forward Bucky supported his body on his left arm as the right lined his cock at Tony’s entrance and pushed in a millimeter so as not to be dislodged when he settled his arm around Tony’s waist. “Alright doll, now is the time to say no if you don’t want this. Once I get inside you, I’m not going to be able to stop for anything.”
Tony gave a crude smile to Bucky over his shoulder at Steve’s words. He felt the sensations rippling through his giving signal to his climax approaching. Wanting to give Bucky the same thrill Tony had received at his thinly cloaked words, he was unable to keep from replying. Knowing the breathy huskiness in his voice would come as a whine of disgruntlement to Steve he said, “Uhhh, but he’s so bossy Steve. Bucky’s been riding my ass since you left and he won’t let up.”
Bucky opened his mouth to speak but closed it abruptly going slightly red. The list of things he was embarrassed to talk about was extremely short, but Steve had just hit item number one on the head. “I uh, I’ve never said it, but I… Sometimes I hate how big I am… Down there.”
Tony’s eyes grew wide at Steve’s words as he fumbled for any words that might keep Steve from saying what he thought he was about to. “Oh, uh, I thought you were cool with this. I mean, you were just with him yesterday, I just, don’t understand where this coming from? Do you want us to break up with him?”
Bucky’s hands gripping his toes while fingers ghosted over the sensitive skin between, and kneading the insteps of his feet had Tony nearly panting within a few minutes. He bit his lip hard enough to draw blood trying not to moan or squirm as Bucky’s hand traveled up his leg to knead his calves. He couldn’t stop the shiver rippling over his body when Bucky fingers grazed the back of his knee. The soft caress caused Tony’s gaze to grow hooded blurring his eyesight. His cock had become so hard it hurt. If either man looked closely, they’d see the small wet patch of fabric where Tony’s erection was leaking through.
Steve looked concerned over to them having stopped his movements at Bucky’s first exclamation. “What’s wrong Bucky… What did you forget? Do you need me to run upstairs for you?”
Once finished, Bucky took both lists before saying they’d be going over a little at a time starting with foreplay. This is how Tony wound up sitting on the edge of his bed naked, Steve down between his legs naked as well, while Bucky sat on the bed beside him fully dressed. “Alright Stevie, you can go ahead and start. Just do what you normally would while I watch and I’ll stop you if I need to.” Looking down to see Steve take the head of Tony’s cock in his mouth, Bucky placed a hand on the small of Tony’s back and leaned forward as if getting a closer look. “Good Stevie, that’s it keep going.” He felt the hand on his back slide down the crease between both his cheeks. It pulled away as Tony shivered giving Bucky an annoyed expression, getting a slightly apologetic one in response.
As Tony walked to the opposite side of the bar from Steve, he began to feel the effects of his consumption. He leaned over the bar, half to get the bartenders attention, the other half to steady himself from tipping over. Okay so
the last of that control from you. If you want to be mine sweetheart, the only thing I need is your permission to do just that.” Steve smirked in confidence. “Like I said before, there’s no part of you I’m not dominant enough for. All I need you to do is trust me.”
Bucky nodded, thinking of the ways he’d make squirm for the next few days. He’d already planned to not fuck Tony for a day or two; so that when he’d finally gave it to the smaller man he’d be dying for it. Now, well Bucky was going to have to drive Tony out of his mind for thinking he could walk away from him. It seemed Tony was under the impression he loved Steve more, and Bucky couldn’t in good conscious let him believe that.
Likely from being in a good mood after their talk, Steve had let Tony hide out on his floor for the rest of the day. The next morning however did not come with the same luck. No matter what Tony said, no matter how much he begged sweetly or yelled angrily at Steve, the super soldier still dragged Tony down to have breakfast with the team the following morning.
Steve chuckled lightly, “It wasn’t so bad. Although, yeah… You’re right, Doc’s and Med’s then were terrible. But I made due, always got by. We may not have had all the fancy things you have to play with around here but things were pretty good. I miss the way people were, how simple things used to be.”
Steve shuddered and looked pained as he opened his mouth to speak but closed it, most likely remembering Bucky asking him to say anything. When Bucky gave him the go ahead to answer the question, his voice sounded completely wrecked. “No I haven’t… Fuck Bucky, let me touch my…”
Looking up at Bucky, his body teetered closer to the edge in anticipation. Bucky was a lot bigger than anyone Tony had ever been with. Thinking of how deep Bucky would be driving into him caused a pleasurable ripple to travel through Tony. With his body aching at the vision presented in front of him, Tony’s voice began to plead with him, “Please Bucky, I’ve been on the brink for days. I can’t think or work, make it stop. Give it to me. I need... I want... God, I don’t know... just... just do something...”
Looking down Bucky said, “Oh,” as if noticing just noticing it, “Gosh, sorry Stevie, but you know how it is.” Shrugging his shoulders, “All the constant rubbing and pushing into Tony over and over, well the friction I guess made me hard.” Giving Steve an innocent smile he said, “But don’t worry, it’s not like I’m going to orgasm because I’m rubbing on him or something.”
. These were your level 10’s and were so unique only 0.5% of the world fell into that category. The odds of actually meeting one in person were 1:900,000 chances. When the books he read didn’t give much detail about them, Tony waved it off thinking it didn’t matter.
Tony’s mind came back to the present just as Steve came moaning in his ear. Rolling onto his side, Steve gathered Tony cuddling into his back. Tony may have a ‘free ride’ coming from Bucky, but he was sure that would be the only one given out. He’d have to figure out something soon if he didn’t want to go to long without Bucky.
He slumped down on Bucky’s chest closing his eyes, breath coming in harsh quick pants as Steve spoke. “Oh my god Tony, why didn’t you tell me you were so tense.” Tony opened his eyes to view Steve looking back at him in concern. “You were in so much pain when Bucky was working that out of you.”
Steve groaned leaning his head back before he raised it back up to kiss Tony. Steve broke the kiss and held Tony’s hips, keeping them still as he looked to him, eyes growing serious. “I… Yeah, I did enjoy it, but… I kind of miss this Tony. Miss when it was just you and me.”
Tony threw the towel around his waist in the general direction of his hamper before lying down on top of Steve and nuzzling the other man’s neck. Tony knew he needed to know how Steve felt about last night and decided to ask him about it as casually as possible. “So, was your birthday wish everything you thought it would be?”
Avoiding Bucky, Tony soon realized was like avoiding air. It’s a damn near impossible task but Tony tried every day hoping to be successful. No matter how he tried to evade the man, Tony seemed to run into him everywhere. Bucky would either already be in the room Tony needed or show up in the one he was occupying. Tony’s plan for space from him was failing on all attempts. He was still suffering from getting hot and bothered at awkward times even after putting Bucky’s arm updates on hiatus.
Tony lay awake in the room he shared with Steve, listening to his boyfriends moans echoing down the hall. Why had he been listening to Steve’s yelling Bucky’s name for the past hour you ask? Well, because Tony made a dumb ass decision to keep him around just to lose him anyway.
Tony didn’t even hesitate as he leaned in to wrap his lips around the head, tongue flickering across the tip. Bucky’s eyes darkened as he moaned saying, “God baby, you’re so good to me. Knowing you’d risk this, do anything for me… Gonna fuck you so good sweetheart, take you apart till you’re screaming for me.” Tony’s eyes closed as he moaned around Bucky’s cock, wanting everything the man said and more. “But, that’s only if…” Tony’s eyes snapped open as Bucky drove his cock all into Tony’s mouth. Tony immediately forced himself to relax his throat allowing the entry, then swallowed massaging the head with the muscles there just how Bucky liked it. Tony shuddered from where he sat looking up to Bucky, watching the man’s eyes go hooded as he groaned lit fire through Tony just knowing he was the reason for it. Bucky finished the statement to Tony as he heard footsteps approaching, “That’s only if you can make me come before he leaves.”
With that, Tony felt Steve’s fingers entering him as his body grew pliant. He let go of… Everything, until Steve was the only thing anchoring him to the world. He knew he’d dropped fully into subspace for the first time when Steve finally entered him, cock stretching Tony open as he slid in completely in one stroke. He felt his mind reaching toward the dominant’s and the other’s man’s consciousness wrapping around his as Steve’s mind did the same.
Tony was losing his mind, and the reason for it all was currently giving him a foot massage as Tony rested against Steve.  It started the day after Tony had to get off in his lab as soon as Bucky left. Since nothing had happened during dinner, Tony relaxed back into his comfortableness with Bucky thinking it was a one off freak occurrence. Their conversation started as usual and soon Tony was laughing at Bucky’s stories adding his own anecdotes when he could. When the conversation strayed to past loves things immediately went downhill.
. It took me almost 2 years, but I did it. I tracked down every last one of them, all 6 participants. Most were in their 40’s and 50’s by then, bitter and angry at the world. Now I… I can fully understand why they were. To want something so bad, and never be able to have it… That would be enough to make anyone hate everything.”
Tony wasn’t sure how long Bucky kept at him since his thoughts and sense of time always became scattered whenever they were together. By the time Bucky stopped the slow paced tease, Tony was rock hard again. Bucky then washed him, taking special care and consideration of Tony in ways only Steve had ever done before. It made Tony feel cherished, important to Bucky in a new way. Once he finished he pushed Tony out the shower, telling him to untie Steve so he could come shower as well.
Giving an indifferent shrug, Tony ran a hand through his hair before he blew out a frustrated sigh. “I know I have like, zero rights to be jealous in this situation, but I liked being the only one you did that to.” Sitting down in his stool, Tony stared dejectedly at the floor before he finished saying, “That had been just ours you know, and now it’s not anymore.”
Bucky huffed out a chuckle as his weight settled onto the hands hold Tony legs open as his hips rose and fell back down. “I’ll go slow Stevie, promise to give you your boyfriend back in one piece.”
They all settled in together holding each other after laughing at Tony saying, “Sounds like the Star Spangled Man has a plan.”
He couldn’t stop the way he fired back angrily as he usually would, “I don’t have to tell you…” But he silenced himself quickly when Steve raised his eyebrows in challenge. He tamped down his typical emotions, stumbling around answer he didn’t want to admit to. “I… My mind is… I can’t stop thinking long enough to sleep.”
“Ah ok, I’ll talk to him when he comes back then. Don’t want to interrupt him if he’s in the middle of something.”
Bucky wanted laugh at how easy Steve was to manipulate as he gave the man a smile nodding. Giving a quick stroke over his already slick cock and lined Tony up, head coming against the wrinkled skin around his opening. Bucky looked down to watch himself glide into Tony’s hole, stretching it wide as it engulfed every inch of Bucky’s long hard rod. Tony’s quiet gasps and moans were music to Bucky’s ears as pushed into him slowly until all the way inside. “Mmm… Yeah, Tony and I fit much better this way.”
The water barely rippled on top in contrast to the bodies rapidly moving below the surface. Tony leaned his head back to meet Steve’s gaze as Bucky continued his powerful thrusts into him. Pushing Tony’s legs all the way to the edge of the pool, feet hanging in the air just outside it, Bucky smiled up at Steve. “Hey Stevie, Tony was complaining about his legs being sore after sparring today. Since I felt responsible pushing into so hard the whole time, I’m helping him stretch. Heard the pool is a good place to cool down and brought him here.”
