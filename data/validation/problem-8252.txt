But I’m not, and somehow, I am told that this second chance at life is supposed to be mercy.
Selfishly, he was glad that he pestered Tony all those years ago. Chased after him despite all of Natasha's subtle warnings about jumping into bed with Tony Stark.
“You always liked it when I did that.”
“But it isn’t possible — Peter assured me you didn’t have a heartbeat.”
It’s the first Christmas. It was bound to be hard. Steve could survive this. There were more holidays to come, he’d have to get used to sitting under the tree and distributing presents alone.
Steve licks his lips and raises the mug. “I made coffee,” then, he points to the plate of food, organized in those floral plates Tony doesn’t use. “And, I thought you might want something to eat? You mentioned something about spaghetti yesterday and...and you had the ingredients for a carbonara.” Steve looks away for a beat, then stares at Tony, determined. God, he’ll be weak for this man. “I was going to bring it to you.”
Steve,
It’s wrong to say it. But —
“Me? Never. J always keeps me updated on anything important.” Tony gave his ice cream cone little cat licks, eyes steady on Steve.
His fingers itch for the familiar weight of a cigarette, just as Steve decides to place an order for Tony, the doors open, bringing a gush of wind inside.
“Sometimes we don’t get a choice about our lives being up for chance, Steve.”
Natasha reasoned that Steve needed to relax. She raised an eyebrow after one mission, when Steve beat someone’s face bloody and dislocated his jaw. She wondered out loud that Captain America needed a vacation. Natasha made passing comments about jumping out of helicarriers without a parachute and into positions he didn’t really understand.
Like the whore I am, Tony thinks.
Tony. It was Tony’s message. Steve needed it.
Steve smiles at the offer and follows him. Steve’s never been close to Bruce. He tries not to feel awkward at the silence as they walk. But Bruce is kind. He doesn’t push Steve to talk. When they reach the gates, Bruce pulls the latch up and gestures for Steve to go in first.
He still wakes too early in the morning, right as the sun rises. With the serum, he really doesn’t need much sleep. Sometimes, he’d rather be up, driving borrowed cars, drifting from one village to another, bearing witness to life after the Snap.
Tony doesn’t know if Steve is lying to Tony or himself. But Tony gathers up all the broken syllables and keeps it close to his chest, because even in a murmur, Steve’s words are still captivating. He cannot fault Steve for it. Tony shakes his head, frantic, and doubles his efforts into fucking himself on Steve’s dick.
Steve is happy for the teams, delighted, really, that the Compound isn’t in ruins, that it’s never seen a battle, that their home hasn’t become a warzone. But all he hears is that he isn’t needed.
Tony wants to bite it off. Put it in his mouth and be done with it.
Tony has lived in the quiet spaces of Steve’s sharp knuckles inside him. Then, striking his face. Just earlier, too.
They just brought Morgan home twelve weeks ago, and for the third time in their life—Steve and Tony were in love with another small human being.
It’s different now. He knows this, but he can’t stop finding all the places where his life and the world are upside down. It’s like walking down a fun house mirror. Is the world distorted, or is it just his own perspective?
Just once, Rumiko had told him, so he might as well be greedy if the only repercussion is Steve’s heart breaking once he walks out the penthouse.
He wished he had scars on his back and abdomen to prove that Tony used to run his hands all over Steve, clawing at his back when they fucked.
“Is that your question?” Tony’s lips quirk up.
Steve felt the rage bubbling over, he leaned forward, trying to restrain himself from lashing out. Pepper’s heard the worst of his comebacks. She didn’t deserve his scathing remarks.
“I wish we could come back from this.”
The first lick was madness. Tony knew how Steve liked to have his ass eaten out. But Tony was being infuriatingly slow. “Come on, Tony, faster.”
A beat later, Miss Barnes comes to sight, a blade and colt casually placed by her hips.
The man who wears Steve’s face stops in front of Tony, squeezes his shoulders. “Farewell, Stark,” he says, as if this would give Tony closure.
“It’s alright.” Steve scrubbed at his thick, dirty blond locks. He tried to smile at his friends. They all nodded understanding, eyes in sympathy. Steve wanted to crawl to the ground. Six feet under and stay there.
He’d have a duty. Be respectable. Maybe he could still have that. He still had work to do.
“Still a kid, kid,” Tony says then claps his head. “Ok, ok enough chatter, my dear husband over here made all of this for you lot, so let’s eat!”
“Hush.” It kisses Tony’s forehead and leads him to the settee. “Maybe you’ll never realize you were too good for him.”
“There are things I need to say,” Tony whispered, anguished. His cheeks felt hot and there was pain on the edges of his eyes. “I know I don’t deserve your friendship.”
“How about I fuck you instead?” Steve pressed Tony to the tile wall and pulled his head to the side. Steve licked the water running down the column of his throat, trailing messy, spit-soaked kisses down his chest until he reached a nipple.
But fuck it.
He was always closer to Tony. They all were. Fucking hell, kids were a struggle.
said that one should voice their concerns to family members, close friends, or even better, a therapist.
But no, Tony is more of a mistress. Steve’s always belonged to the townsfolk, and his nights with Tony were always stolen moments in the dark. A lost weekend they’d refuse to acknowledge in daylight. And if Steve ever looked at him too long, or smiled when he sang like a drunk fool on the station’s steps, then that didn’t matter.
Steve understood the challenge. He removed the hand from his cock, pushed his chest and arms down, and fucked himself on Tony’s dick. He moved quickly, using Tony’s dick for his pleasure.
Steve fiddles with the stereo, glancing back and forth between the road and Tony.
Each person was just biding their time. The lives Steve took as a soldier and Captain America were never personal. There was detachment to each time the trigger was pulled or the shield was thrown. He was doing that for the sake of his country, for the better of mankind and the safety of people.
Tony waits for him to continue.
Steve wondered whether she wore sunglasses to the meetings so they wouldn’t see her eyes. If they watered. If they were red-rimmed by the end of the session like the most of the attendees.
Tony had said when Steve expressed his worry that they’re missing their family time together. He wanted to invite Pepper for dinner, but he wasn’t sure if it was appropriate of him to ask. Thus, Steve awkwardly hung between wanting Pepper over so he could selfishly have both Morgan and Tony with him during the holidays, and not entirely knowing how to feel if Pepper joined them.
Steve’s world spun around and around Tony. He’d have that for eternity.
That they couldn’t replace their dead father. No one would.
“Sorcerer Supreme, Mr. Stark,” Tommy says.
It all came head to head in this facility. Natasha threw a dagger on Pierce's forehead, while Rumlow was replusored in the ass. Sitwell and other minions were being taken into Fury's custody. Steve didn't trust them one bit—and he'd rather go independent with Tony, knowing that Fury's moral compass was sort of skewed.
“I didn’t come to talk at all.” Steve tilts his head, he’s looking around the Tower, this place they once shared and tried to build into a home, even for just a few weeks.
“Steve—”
Steve shoved the gardening supplies in a corner then entered their new home. Tony was asleep on the leather sofa, hand hanging loose on his stomach. The StarkPad was propped up his thigh. Steve's heart stuttered. Steve couldn’t believe this man chose to be with him—out of all the people Tony could have, he's with Steve.
“I feel so…”
Steve swallowed the sound of protest rising from his chest. If Tony wanted to hit something, it might as well be Steve. He could take it. He didn’t try to approach Tony. He wasn’t sure what he could do. “Yes. Of course. Everyone is worth saving.”
“Steve, I told you about making us a happy ending. Promise me you’ll do that. Everyone wants that, me included. But baby, life doesn’t always roll that way. I hope you’ll never have to play this. I hope like hell that I’ll get better and be in remission. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and our kids. I was thinking we might get a cabin in Pennsylvania or move to Monterey. Get a house by the beach. You’ll paint the sea and I’ll be there right next to you. Shit. Steve. You’re the best thing. The part of me I’m proud of. Steve, if you do play this, it means I’m gone. And that’s alright, darling. We’ll all get there. It’s just sooner for me. I wish it wasn’t. But I hope— what a world. It’s been a dream, Steve.
Steve raises his eyebrows.
“I’m sorry, pops. It’s just. It’s hard.”
He’s put on more muscles, and for a moment, Steve’s mind drifts back to Tony in a wheelchair, IV by his side because Steve insisted that he join the debrief to get as much information on Thanos as possible. Because Steve had other priorities, and no matter how much he wanted to make Tony rest, such desires were outweighed by the need of desperate victory.
He’s not wrong, but my sins can’t be forgotten. It’s not easy, isn’t it, Steve.
Once you see through the veil, it’s hard to let shut the curtains once more.
“I’ll just be…going then.”
Ru, on the verge of falling asleep, had said, “Tell me a secret no one knows.”
He’s supposed to be inching towards acceptance. Bereavement was a marathon. But he’s never left the starting point, stagnant and nauseous with the reality he’d have to run for the rest of his life.
Dating didn’t interest him. He yearned for the familiar, so he moved back to his neighborhood in Brooklyn, but when he walked around the borough, the buildings appeared unfamiliar. The world moved on without him. Steve was still playing catch up.
Just two lanes, separated by a barrier and then another two lanes going the opposite directions.
“They need to focus,” Natasha says, observing the way Steve steps back. “Don’t take offense.”
“Fine, let’s get this over with then I’ll take a cat nap.” Tony removed his feet from the coffee table and turned to fully face Steve. His calves were strong, muscular, and hairy.
Steve palmed Tony’s ass, squeezing it before pulling the cheeks apart to slam home.
Hope is a terrible thing because it makes men like Tony dream.
“It seems like you all moved on and I’m the only one—God, Pops is pretending that dad is still here. He wrote
Earlier, they got called for back-up by the active Avengers and the Fantastic Four for some alien drama in Midtown. Tony had a seizure while in the suit, vomited inside the armor, and fell off a building. Fortunately, Sam was able to swoop in before too much internal damage was done.
Steve sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. He was still in his office at the SHIELD facility. Natasha was across the hall, pouring over files on the Winter Soldier with Clint. Steve needed to be alone. He replayed the video again.
Peter put on the sunglasses, pushing it up against his face with an index finger.
His cell is as cold as an ice box and the blanket he wraps around himself doesn’t ease his shivers. He follows the warmth for a brief moment, only to remember that he’ll be burned soon enough.
Tony walks back with his hands in his pockets, still wearing the same clothes from earlier. Steve smiles when he sits back, and they’re careful not to touch, even their feet don’t meet under the table.
I can’t help but think of you. I don’t know, Steve. It doesn’t have to be love. Replace the word with something vile or another metaphor, but that’s what it is. Being human. Being us, superheroes, viginilate, whatever it is. We’ll see death soon enough.
Danvers catches his eye for a beat, looking at him up and down, disappointment evident in the twist of her mouth.
An act of God.
With a bottle of whiskey, he's had the courage to sing the song at the top of his lungs, hoping like hell Steve would pay attention. The dames have told him, and damn, doesn't feel like a century ago, that he had a nice baritone voice. Yeah, yeah, Starks are genius and excel at most of the arts, be it mathematics or literature. His mother, a governess before her marriage to the late Howard Stark, taught him well.
Steve promised to do better.
It’s easy to imagine Tony in the passenger seat, humming to the tune.
“The world keeps turning. It never stops for them. It’s always the next story.” Natasha replied.
It’s fine. He won’t push it. He’s supposed to be getting better. He can wait.
“Then, what’s wrong,” Steve presses closer, crading Tony’s jaw with his free hand. “Do you not want me anymore?”
He grabs more lube, smearing it over Tony’s crack, and adds another finger.
please let me know if you catch any grammatical errors so i can fix them! i hope you're excellent. *puppy dog eyes* please lemme know what you think. thank you for reading <3
Steve,
He doesn't really know if he likes it that way, or if he's just scared to return home — if such a place still exists for him.
Steve heard her erratic pulse from across the room. It was like he was seeing a reflection of himself.
Steve could be happy.
Steve sat on the patch of grass and breathed in the smell of New York mixed with the carnation and the acidic taste of loss. He picked up the flower hoping more would grow as he continued to tend the garden. Once the carnations and jasmines were in bloom, he’d make another crown, drop it on the wicker chair.
Even with a bruise forming under his eyes, Tony looked handsome and untouchable. Steve ached with something stupid.
What the fuck was he thinking, stupid Stark. He’s never been meant for happiness.
“You don’t love me,” Tony whispered in the dark. It was true. People were braver in the shadows, when they could hide.
“Well, you’re too humble. You should have taken your mantle back.” Tony’s fingers tweedle on the last couple of keys, finishing  Liebestraum No. 3.
Images flickered in his mind. As he read the reports, pulled up Extremis, his mind tried to corroborate the information with unclear images, fragmented scenes, puzzling conversations he didn't understand the context for. It kept coming and coming, and Tony tried to piece them together.
He swallowed, blinked, once, twice, trying to shake the intense feeling of emptiness away. No, he wasn’t going to do that now. He’d break down in their room later once all their friends left for their respective homes. Once the kids were asleep.
“Miss Barnes, please, sit down.” Tony urges her but she pulls away and walks further into the ruins. So far, Tony runs after her to catch up at the edges of the Silver Mines.
In a way, it does.
He’s tried drawing them over and over, but he couldn’t capture its brightness on paper.
He nodded, watching how Steve’s fingers twisted the button and pulled the zipper down. The sound echoed in the quiet of the room.
He wanted it. He was selfish. Steve was here again, trying to save him.
Tony pulls off. “I don’t care! It’s our house.”
” She asked with an arched eyebrow. Her hands went to her hips. Steve wondered if this was the same irritation and fear Tony felt around Pepper.
Somehow.
Well, of course, after some heavy petting with the shower raining down on them and Tony threatening Steve to increase the water pressure because
At the door, Red Wolf and Miss Barnes wave him out.
He gazes through the glass panels and sees the sun drifting towards the river.
It’s easy. It’s like he’s tiny again, back in Brooklyn, picking fights in alleys and getting his ass kicked. This, he could handle.
There were only three inches separating the ledge from the track. It only took one blink for her to hop down, throwing herself onto the tracks and into the path of the speeding train.
Still, since Steve’s return, he’s strong, healthier. His mouth no longer smells like tobacco and there’s a brightness to him that wasn’t there before. As a man upholding the law, Steve’s always been fit, and Tony prides himself in learning all things about Steve Rogers. He catalogued the width of his shoulders, the shape of his back, the slope of his thighs. Tony is intimately familiar with it. But he can’t help look at Steve, gaze at this unharmed body that doesn’t have a scar from where the bullet shot his back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shellhead,” Steve whispered, in admonishment.
I told you, I’m deleting my brain, piece by piece, but I find myself saving memories of us.
But if that’s the price, so be it.
"This quiets the screams, dulls the pain...hurries along the slow dying..." —
“It’s because you’re smaller, dad,” Morgan says with a mouthful. She reaches for Tony’s own glass of juice and makes a satisfied sound. Like father, like daughter, Steve thinks.
Steve prepared dinner meticulously. He was still used to cooking for a family of five, not four. Somedays, he still set an extra plate on the table. The kids would glance at it and say nothing.
The air in the bar is too thin. He can smell the beer being poured by the barkeeper. The day old rag dragging along the tables. The sharp tang of the grease and sizzling pans in the kitchen and stale bread. The cleaners from the bathroom in the ajar door of the corner broom closet
“Yes?”
I think the rest of the Avengers wanted to keep you in our time. I was attempted, too. But it wouldn’t be right.
“How does it look?”
Tony’s shaking his head now, he’s got a hand over a woman’s shoulders. He snaps her tank top’s strap while she starts kissing his neck.
Steve,
He used to smile a lot, growing up, his mother always told him so. Between asthma attacks and bloody noses, he grinned and asked a million and three questions about why the world was the way it was.
“Huh.” Tony blinks, and his mouth opens then closes only to open again, like he’s on the edge of realization. “Somehow, I think I am. Yeah. I am.”
u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u u .
Steve stops his ministrations and exhales a shaky breath.  A minute passes before he’s groaning, and there’s the sound of his zipper being pulled further down. “Fuck, Tony, what you do to me. Fuck.”
“Can you repeat that, please?” Steve swallowed down the anxiety and laced his fingers with Tony’s. Tony squeezed them hard.
They’ve had a good run as Avengers, an independent group of superheroes governed by their own mission and checked by the United Nations. Tony and Pepper handled all the bureaucracy, Steve didn’t really know the details. Tony handled it and Steve trusted his decisions. Together, the Avengers team drafted a set of guidelines which was then finalized as the Accords.
Steve kisses him, drops some spit onto his awaiting mouth, and it’s all fine, even just for a few moments, because Steve is thrusting wild and keeps staring at him the entire time.
Only, I am without a gauntlet and a golden coffin to submerge my body in.
She usually finishes her school work before the afternoon, so she gets free reign riding with Steve around their property or picking strawberries with Steve if it’s in season.
“Always carnations,” Tony nodded, pressing his head to Steve’s shoulder. “But later. Just hold me, Steve.”
Tony would be responsive. He’s always been reactionary, yes—a planner, a futurist, seeing what the rest of them can’t predict. Steve wonders if Tony ever saw this happening—ever saw Steve, in his depraved want, abiding to these conditions because the yearning consumes him until this is all that’s left. A choice. A decision. Almost a betrayal. To himself? To Tony? Steve doesn’t know.
Steve backs out of the parking lot, gets on the freeway, and drives further and further north.
Steve sipped it, setting it on the coffee table. He opened his arms, a quiet request for a hug. Peter and Morgan came willingly, resting their hands on his shoulders. They stay quiet for a long while. Steve didn’t bother wiping at his face. He felt for Morgan’s hair, patting it twice, before arranging her on his lap. She looked up at him with tears running down her face.
On and on and on.
“Good,” Samuel says, and they all earn a cheer from their bystanders. One starts rattling about how his mother makes the best iced-tea, and won’t Tony Stark please come visit to have a taste, and perhaps, fix up a broken TV set they have lying in the garage. More requests follow, and rather than being overwhelmed, Tony agrees to them all, as long as there’s tea and snacks involved.
“I don’t think we have to do anything but live. Try to be happy, even though it seems improbable,” Another attendee said.
Tony feels wrong footed in his own home. He’s standing naked in his kitchen with a blanket covering his bits. Then, there’s this handsome man,
Steve might be wrong, but Tony didn't disagree.
I don’t know who I am without the suit. Connection to Extremis. I like to think there’s a man in there. Maybe there was once a time we could all go home, back to 890 Fifth. Share a pizza and call it easy. Call it home. Call it friendship. That’s probably the issue. Nostalgia is a horrible sentiment because it eats you inside out until you’re just hollow bones. Can’t touch me though. I’ve got Extremis stored there so I’m invincible. I got that going on for me.
Tony can’t comprehend him. He hears the yelling of the guards. The pressure of Steve’s hand on his weak biceps. But he can’t fully register what’s happening. It’s like he’s falling out of the helicarrier without the armor.
“Does the Captain have a name?”
“Wait, stt—”
He comes twice before Steve fucks him.
She followed him after Siberia, and then after Wakanda, he decided being alone was his penance.
Wide, brown eyes. Too much like Tony’s.
Bucky and Sam are prepared. They are soldiers after all. They pass Steve a backpack full of water and several dehydrated meals once they reach the peak of the mountains. They’re quiet. Not much to talk about, not much these two don’t already know.
He pulled Tony’s waist and kissed him stupid. Tony ran both hands over Steve’s shoulder, scratching the fabric before inching his hands to Steve’s back, then lower, to cup Steve’s ass. They made out for a while, with languid tongues, exchanging spit.
Steve will never tire of hearing that word come out of Tony’s mouth.
They wait a beat, and it’s like standing on the edge of a cliff. Steve doesn’t know what to do. Fall forward or run back. The choice is stifling.
Steve licked the head, making his way down the shaft. He sucked with ease, hot as hell that they were doing this in a semi-public place, even though they couldn’t be seen since Tony raised the invisible fortress. The rest of the city would just see this afternoon’s image of the garden. They’d have no idea that Steve was sucking Tony’s dick and looking forward to fucking his ass on it.
Steve,
“He was the one good part of me.”
The water felt like a kiss.
Tony deserves something greater than life—something beyond anything that Steve or even Rumiko could possibly give him.
He walks out of  his new workshop and sits on the porch, and imagines Steve patrolling the streets, feeding his skinny horse, making talk with a merchant about their crops. If Tony squints, he can see Steve lingering beside him, smelling musky under the sun.
Kicks the ladder.
Stripped out of his armor, naked, not even the exo-skeleton from Extremis covering him, Tony felt human in the most elementary sense. This might be all Steve wanted. For him to remain the same, untouched, untroubled by the responsibilities that came with being more than what he was born to do.
He would never have that again. He sat with the memory, then shut the water, dried himself with awareness, making sure to towel his hair so the water wouldn’t get on the tiles. Tony had hated when Steve walked off, still dripping with water.
He’d gambled and lost.
Was it after he resurfaced from the ice, or has it been long before then, ever since he fought in war and took the Captain America mantle?
Some people just wanted peace and in the yearning, they would take crumbs. Steve’s lucky, he thought to himself, he had friends who loved his children. Who would care for them if anything happened to him. That made things easier.
Tony fell in and out of sleep. He’d wake then mutter something about schematics, the kids, or being Iron Man, then cuddle closer to Steve. The sun was way up high, marking the time as past noon.
The kids were getting restless.
He stares at the badge, hating the way he sees himself reflected in the star of it. Recalling the way Steve would set it down primly on his desk before unlocking the cell to fuck Tony’s face.
“Haven’t you seen enough of the world? Captain America is going on another road trip. I recall you taking your motorcycle and driving off after the Chitauri.”
He placed it on the second shelf, right beside Tony’s razor.
“It’s something I never want to let go of, Steve.” Tony pressed their foreheads together and closed his eyes. Steve blinked the sting in his eyes away. He didn’t know what he’d do if this lovely little life of theirs was taken from him.
The coffee is thin; too much water was used in the preparation. The cream is from those small containers often found in diners all across America. Tony pulls a face, scrunches his nose, but finishes his cup and signals for another one.
and well, isn’t funny that Tony measures his worth in the same way. They were under the moonlight and they had a good conversation, one that was genuine and for once, it wasn’t about the brand name
Maybe people go on and on with their lives never thinking that they could lose the love of their life until they reached old age when it was inevitable. But Tony was young and there were promises of another few decades of love, hope, and dreams.
Steve groans, his movements growing frantic and he’s whispering about how much he loves this, loves us. “Tony, Tony,” he repeats again and again.
“Are you still Captain America?” Kate leans forward, curiosity in her eyes.
It’s awful to stay in that line of thought. Regrets turn to misanthropy. He had to believe in the will of the people because he had nothing else.
Steve set the bowl down and touched his jaw. He missed the beard, only because Tony liked to run his fingers on the fine hair and teased him relentlessly about being Captain Handsome.
Tony had asked. He received a punch in the jaw for his question.
Sometimes, Tony thinks he doesn’t deserve it.
Steve.
There’s no handshake, not like the time they parted in Central Park years and years ago.
At least he had a semi-alive interaction based on his own memories.
He moved all the way to Los Angeles for Tony. He upended his post-Army life to see him. Maybe, Tony will join him in New York. If not, Steve will learn to like Los Angeles.
He lost the one good thing in his life.
“I really was going to kill you,” Steve says. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart.”
Tony nips Steve’s lower lip, hard enough to break skin, and then he’s interspersing the sting with small licks and drawn out hums. The scratch of the silk blindfold is irritating on Steve’s skin. He itches to pull it off and let Tony see that this is
Steve nods.
He’s petting Tony’s hair. His hands, still damp with come, have a putrid smell.
“You never said.”
“It seems like you both are doing well,” he says, face heating. He knows what she means. She didn’t expect him to be the one to leave. “I’m happy for you both.”
The world moved forward, but the note captured a singular moment that changed Steve’s world.
The following morning, Bucky and Sam appear in their kitchen. Morgan hangs on Bucky’s arm and swings herself while he looks down on her, utterly amused. Sam claps his back with a grin.
Pepper stood up, hands balled into a fist. Her heels clang against the floorboards. She looked vicious; she only reserved that when Tony pissed her off. “I’ve reached my limit. I can’t have my godchildren calling me every night telling me they can hear their father crying. Or the fact that you’re not sleeping and you’re breaking punching bags every night. I know you’re grieving. I know it hurts. I know—”
No matter how many wars they waged against other human beings, no one wanted to spend their days alone.
Steve waits for FRIDAY to announce his arrival, but Tony remains focused on the specs in front of him, two suits by his side. He presses a hand to the glass door and it opens without a sound.
Steve is here now. He won’t be here for long.
He laughs, the feeling nearly unfamiliar. “Foot off the dash.”
Tony runs forward, but it’s too late, Tommy ties the Skrulls by the rope but with short lived success, they break out quickly, and the one that wears Jessica Drew’s face kicks Tommy, hard. The kid falls and screams.
Sometimes I just want to put my heart in a blender and think I should do that exact thing to Steve Rogers.
He stands tall, firm, posture relaxed as he chats idly with Barnes.
Steve would never touch him like this one does.
“Morning, Stark.”
“Well, why’d you come here if you didn’t want help?”
Steve’s done nothing these last three years but bounce from one country to another, each stay never lasting more than several weeks long.
Tony glances at him briefly, then he’s turning back to Compound’s remaining residents.
Not so long ago
“West. To see the Great Americana,” he says with a deceptive smile. He’s looking forward to the drive, the backcountry roads, pausing at small towns and offering help where he can.
“Another Sam Cooke song,” Tony observes, looking up at the ceiling and pressing his hands against the table.
“Nevermind them,” Miss Barnes says, hurriedly, pulling Tony towards her horse. “We’re riding to the dam.”
He stands there, still as a corpse, reminded of how fragile he hangs with Steve’s short thread of mercy.
“Can you help me?” Steve shifts forward, face grim. “Make it better.”
“Here, like this.” She folds his thumb and two of his fingers back, then presses the index and middle against Tony’s rim. “Tease him a little bit. He  likes that.” And together, they rub circles, clockwise, until Steve finally dips in and feels the heat of Tony, stretching open against Steve.
The crux of it is that Steve
He looked at his left hand, bare, without its vibranium ring for the first time in sixteen years.
Steve raised one hand, beckoning his children over. They stood beside him as Steve set the bouquet to the lake. The jasmines and peace lilies shone vividly against the waters. It pulled away, sliding away until it was just a dot in the distance.
Maybe that’s the price of freedom.
“I’m furious, and you’re drinking again.” He must have seen something in Tony’s face because his expression softened. He plucked the gauze from the drawer and rubbed ointment on Tony’s hands, up his arms. He bandaged them, a frown on his face. “And you’re right, there are things we should talk about. It's hard to bury what happened between us. I never thought we'd get to this point. We’re a mess.”
, and that’s something true, tangible in this world full of the unknown.”
The movement is gentle, an abject reminder that Steve could break his skull if he chooses to.
The last man who had saved him is the same man who kicked his ribs and forced him to see their friends execution.
“So, I just wear his face and you fuck me and apologize and when you’re upset, you hurt me the way you would never have hurt him right? Because now, what does it matter, he’s gone. Dead. By your hands. Your shield. That’s on you.”
“They’re all adults, they can take care of themselves.” Tony pauses, glancing back towards their friends all by the lake. Some of them are seated in benches, others are loitering by the docks. There’s Angel and Augusto chatting up with Carol, and Steve’s heart swells with the love all around him.
Steve,
I don’t compare myself to him anymore.
Steve turned him over with a grin and kissed his neck. The warm water washed over them, soaking their heads. Steve ducked down so Tony could wash his hair with those expert fingers.
“You’re familiar.” Samuel’s eyes narrow, and for a moment, Steve’s wondering if Samuel will yell out Captain America, what have you done!
“How is Mr. Barnes?” Tony finally interrupts the silence as they reach the outskirts of town.
The pain on his hips fester to his lower back, and he sobs as he turns over the thin mattress, biting his lips to stop from screaming.
“I am,” he says because it’s true.
He felt his lips tug into a smile. “I’ll have to get one with Iron Man. I think there’s a matching set at the bodega down my street.”
There’s nothing left to lose, anyway.
They’ll need it if the Skrulls ever return. They’ll need to find their spaceship too. There’s so much work to do, but Tony remains paralyzed.
Pitt'o Nili wears Steve’s skin with pride. He's always worn his shirt open at the collar without the red tie. Tony could give it to him. It belonged to Steve.
“She’s swimming!” Tony laughs, full bellied. He clutches Steve’s forearms and kisses his cheek. “What a handful.”
whispering to Steve between kisses, hands brushing up and down Steve’s torso. “Bed, let’s go to bed.”
Silence enveloped them. Tony twitched and the stabs on his arms itched, but he didn’t dare move. Steve was measuring his breaths.
“Then —“
I got the shield to Bucky.
an agent told him in a monotone voice. Life was slowed down without termination. A living creature may appear to be dead but it's just their body fighting for survival by dropping to a dormant state.
I am Tony Stark.
“Well, you almost made me into a widower, I think Pepper’s giving me a pass for life.” Steve stared at him, swallowing hard. His eyes stung, and he shut them, letting a single tear fall.
He must be looking at me in revulsion. My fingers are green. My body is turning green. He fucked this evergreen warrior, and he’ll take more of us until the last.
“Message deleted.” The helmet announced.
let me savor your memory. i dont deserve it. I know. i dont deserve to remember you. us. but let me have this
Maybe he already accounted for Steve’s perfect recollection due to the serum. He didn’t know. Steve was learning that it’s unsustainable to live in
“To town, Stevie.”
“Even after everything?”
He said he's going back to find
Tony understands the way brains are affected by ethanol. Neurons demand nutrition from the brain. He’s just a body now. Six feet and one inch, he can’t even stand up with the damage to his knees, so used to being on all fours with his ass up.
Tony inhales, savoring the tobacco’s sharp flavor. It grounds him for a brief moment. Something tangible, felt. Unlike the shadows that linger in the night.
There’s not much to miss when the only fond memories they shared were barbed comments exchanged in the saloon or when Rogers would arrest him for public disturbance. They said more when Tony was being a nuisance, yelling and yapping outside the station, drunkenly trying to get Rogers’ attention.
“No, no, it’s just.” He shuts his eyes for a moment and wills his face to stop heating. “It’s just an adjustment, that’s all. I saw you die, Steve. Fisk threw you. There was nothing to recover. I can’t…” Eyes open, Tony tracks the understanding dawning into Steve’s face. It’s still uncanny to see him without blood on his face. “I can’t wrap my mind around how you’re here. I’m a man of science. Mechanics. This is magic. Supernatural. I don’t know, I can’t help but think it’s a dream.”
When we talk about the war, I apologize a hundred times and beg Steve for his forgiveness. Steve kisses me, tells me everything will be alright. He takes us both down dwindling paths until we’re back to cul-de-sacs. It’s where his thoughts orbit around the same dead-end.
His hair is mused, likely from wearing goggles, but his goatee is still pristine. He’s softer, and Steve can’t pinpoint exactly what edges have been sanded down, but it’s there.
But Steve doesn’t care.
“We didn’t leave on good terms.”
“Look, dad,” Morgan says, pointing excitedly at their hummingbird feeder. Even with all the feeders Tony’s gifted him, the one that hangs on the tree by the docks is still Steve’s favorite. It’s something special.  “Pops.” She grabs Steve’s shoulder and tries to turn him. “The red-winged blackbirds are there.”
Steve watched it another three times before writing his notes on a legal pad. It’s just a jumbled mess of thoughts and read more like reflections on life in the new century. What the fuck was he doing here? What the fuck was going on with SHIELD? HYDRA? Bucky was alive and was HYDRA’s pawn? What was the difference between HYDRA and SHIELD? Did Nick Fury know about this?
“You still have your life, pops. I have mine. We’ll make do.” Peter said.
“I’m not.” But Steve feels raw, ready to bolt and take his bags to the truck.
And he does. “It is.”
Tony stared at him with a frown. “Relax, Rogers, I’m not gonna hunt your buddy. Not if he could be saved. But you’re not stopping me from hunting HYDRA.”
He opens for Tony, hums at the slight sour taste in both of their tongues, but Steve doesn’t care much. Steve deepens the kiss and rolls their hips until they get a rhythm.
You’re not around to see it. Maybe I won’t be either. I failed.
“Well, I never did things that were easy.” Tony grimaced, jutting his chin.
Steve returned with a damp washcloth, knelt in front of him, and pressed the towel on his face. Steve ran it over his cheekbones, above his eyelids, and Tony bit his lips to stop a sob from escaping.
“We can’t spend the rest of our lives chasing after ghosts.”
“Fuck if I know, Stark.”
The cat glanced up from the bowl, then jumped off the ledge. It disappeared and Steve was once again alone in the garden.
He doesn’t know where he’s going, but that’s what he enjoys about running. He can go in a straight line, as much as the streets allow. Turn left, turn right. He’s in control of his body.
The smile is all wrong. It’s saccharine to the point of aggressive, as if this version of Steve wants to rewrite all the memories Tony has of them together.
He enlisted their kids to pout and whine with worry anytime Tony watched the news and said, “The Avengers could use Iron Man.”
Tony sings, choking on the words. Not so cocky now.
Losing you and having to keep on living with you might be the hardest thing I have to do. Somedays, I think it gets easier. That’s what us mortal livings have to tell ourselves. Day by day, the world keeps spinning. But you know, the scientist in me understands that there’s a life out there, away from this blue marble. There’s life out there, greater than me and you. We’ve both seen that in other planets. Other galaxies. I don’t know what you did to me, but somehow, the vastness of existence doesn’t seem to matter as much. I grieve you, Steve. I hope you know that. It’s hard to live knowing I’ve had a hand in losing you. Some nights, I think, maybe if we talked more, if I tried harder. If we didn’t settle on punches on the Mansion, maybe you’d be here. But it’s hard to change your mind. I know you, Steve. I’m the same way. I wish we weren’t so stubborn and that we were better men.
“Do you ever feel like you can’t sleep in the middle of the bed? The left side was his. The right was mine. And I still keep to my side after all this time. I don’t know if that makes sense. My body doesn’t want to move to the middle.” Steve shrugged. “I guess, all I’m saying is that...I don’t think endings are ever happy. You wake up one day and the love of your life is dead. You don’t know what to do with yourself. You can’t eat because making food takes too much energy. You’re not even hungry. You just cry until there’s nothing left. Then you realize you gave that love your all. There’s nothing more. No more love to give.”
“I will. I know you will too.” Steve lathered up Tony’s back and kissed his neck. “I can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives raising children.”
“Fuck,” Carol said, and he paused, waiting for the impact of a punch, but instead, she grabbed him by the neck and cried. “Tony, no. Don’t
“You weren’t sleeping?” Steve sat on the other end of the couch, setting the briefcase on his lap. “I think you should be getting rest, Tony. From my understanding, you just had the arc reactor removed, right?”
“It will work. I’ve tried it.”
Perhaps, people don’t have a choice.
What—” Harley scrubbed his eyes, kicked his feet petulant. “He wasn’t even here to pick this for me!”
“Because
No, no, no, that wasn’t true. All he wanted was for Steve to be back. But not like this. Not with Steve’s mouth drawn into a frown.
Steve was on the rooftop, squatting tending to the wild arugula. Their vegetable patch was a hodgepodge of Tony's favorite vegetables and Steve's plants. On the west side of the roof stood a carnation garden, while the south side was reserved for their baby greens and tomato tree.
Steve leaves it at that. He wants to say more, but he can’t find the words. He’s always been awful at communicating. It’s either bark orders at the team or scream at bullies or talk back to men who think they have authority. That’s on the fly. Those are things that are nearly insignificant to when he actually needs to talk, to fix something.
Steve,
“You sure you could keep away from the field?”
Tony looks like he’s his, and evidence of it is written all over his face. From the way he smells like Steve, because they use the same shampoo and soap. From the way his clothes smell like Steve’s because they shove all their clothes into the same laundry bag, use the same lavender mint detergent. From the way Tony’s lips taste a bit like the coffee they chose together.
Tony shakes his head, then there’s that self-deprecating smile. “Can’t say I have. Not as of late,” his eyes are heavy and he’s looking up at Steve with these thick eyelashes. “Could count the number of people who gave a shit in one hand. That’s not counting those who passed. Will you show them how it’s done? You know, since you seem to give a shit about me.”
He should have listened to Tony. He shouldn’t have made too much noise. Shouldn't have called the people to get their rifles and claim this town.
“Steve, I know. Hush now, I’ll be okay, you heard them. There’s a high survival rate if they all do their jobs right, which I’m sure they will because I hired them for the Avengers and they are the best.”
He's so broken down by grief, it's pathetic. I nearly laugh.
Rhodes caught his eye from the dining table, hesitating for a moment, before he set the cutlery down on the table.
Steve grabbed onto Tony’s body, shaking it with the force of his cries. “No, no, no.”
“Shit, sorry, I can take that back.” He reaches for the plate but Steve gently bats his hand away.
The only reason Steve is here today is because Tony mentioned Café Hafa back then, in the quiet space of time Steve has come to think of as the Before.
“Well, let’s introduce you.” He turns and points at both women sitting with their feet up on the sofa. They looked delighted as Steve squirms under their scrutiny. “Riri Williams and Kate Bishop.”
People noticed them, then moved on. They’re just two men who’ve drifted through life and somehow found each other. Steve pulled Tony to his chest. He won’t let go. This was the first of many kisses.
“Promise me something.” Tony opened his hand and laced their fingers. Steve brought it up to his lips and kissed the wedding band.
Morgan patted Steve’s hand. “Ready?”
Steve unwraps the paper, seeing the blue tint to the bread, and hopes he doesn’t look disappointed. “They didn’t have —“
She’s nursing a large mug, and from the short distance between them, Steve can smell its contents. It isn’t coffee.
His eyes stuck with the tears streaming down his face. He didn’t bother it away. “I wish you didn’t have to leave me.”
“And so.” She turns away, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts once more.
“I don’t hate you. I’ve said — I
“And he looks good doing it.” Steve laughs and slips his free hand under the table to grip Tony’s thigh. He’s met with a grin.
There wasn’t.
“I think they can,” is all Tony says. He presses the shield an inch closer to Steve, patient.
“At ease, soldier,” the man shakes his hand and tips his hat when Steve gives him a questioning looking. He’s not a solider anymore, hasn’t been in a long time. He wonders if he’ll ever stop standing too straight or in parade’s rest. If he’ll ever strip those habits that categorized him as one.
Warm all over, Steve wiped the sweat from his temple and grabbed a couple of tomatoes and cucumbers. He threw them into the basket hoping to make a mediterranean salad with dinner. Ever since Tony went into remission, they’ve changed their eating habits and Tony’s retired from using the suits unless absolutely necessary. Steve didn’t even let Natasha call Tony for backup and she never tried to persuade Steve otherwise.
“Can we keep him? Please? Please?” Morgan interrupts, trying to get their attention once more. She pleads thrice more, pouting and clutching the puppy closer to her chest. She’s a short kid, and she’s got her father’s eyes. “Please?”
Tony takes a sip and eyes Steve through the brim of his mug. “Isn’t it a bit presumptuous of you to assume what I can handle?”
Steve rocked Tony on his lap, arranging them so that Tony could rest his head on Steve’s chest. He settled the blanket over Tony’s body.
He takes the red scarf from under the pillow and cries himself to sleep.
The office is strategically placed to see the Atlantic. He can hear the waves roar, and it’s so unlike the quiet hum of Tangiers. The waves here crash against the cliff, and as night continues to fall, the sounds become ominous.
But first, I need a parting gift for Steve. I place the blade under my eyelid and follow the curve. It’s just an organ.
“Alright.” He nodded, taking the other glass of tequila. He threw it back in two gulps.
He stays put, shifting his feet until the floors creak. “Well, who am I to deny you anything you want?” Tony makes a show of flexing his wrists in circles, then resumes his performance.
They'd only meet again in death.
“Shut up.”
More than human. Less than human. They couldn’t figure each other out.
Steve jutted out his jaw, defiant. Steve wore every sentiment on his face, but sometimes Tony still couldn’t figure out thow to read him.
For Steve and Tony, it was carving out a space for each other, willing for it to work even if they both understood the possibility of failure.
He leans over for a kiss, shifting to pass Morgan who sits in the middle seat. She rolls her eyes and Kit wiggles around them, getting an eye roll from Morgan. Steve meets him halfway, pausing his work with the paddle to suck Tony’s bottom lip.
“Yeah?” There’s a ghost of a smile in Tony’s lips, barely there at all, like he’s amused but refuses to show it. “See how the rest of the world keeps moving?”
Pull the trigger, Stark, no one will miss you.
His son looked at him questioningly, tilting his head down with an encouraging smile. As if his father needed it. No, it shouldn’t be like that. Steve forced his lips into a smile. A mimicry of the real thing.
“You have no idea. He spoils them rotten, and in turn, they’re completely overbearing.”
“I don’t doubt it,” Tony replies, closes his eyes, and for the first time, he wishes this to be a dream. “Walter died. Reed has the body. They’ll hunt for the rest of you. You should leave. Don’t come back. You can’t.”
The last time he’d been this close to Steve, they’d been at each other's throats. Tony remembered that now.
He swallows the blame as easy as a patient in pain devours Fentanyl.
The levees can’t break.
He’d always wonder if Tony stood in that very spot. Did he have his arms crossed? Was that before he met Steve? But he’s reached an impasse. Their home—no, the world was like a culs-de-sac, everything returning to Tony.
“Could you tell me about it?” He asks, throat too dry, wishing he had that glass of beer after all. “The wedding?”
But for now, he floated.
Is it selfish.
“God, Steve, retirement has made you a romantic.”
It cannot be true. There should be scar tissue. Even if Strange is a self-proclaimed medical genius, there has to be evidence of the blunt force of a navy pistol. It’s Colt made, not Stark’s.
“Alright, Riri, Kate,” Tony taps both their shoulders and pulls them into a one sided hug. When Tony pulls away, they both pull him back to squeeze him harder. “Both of you are in charge.”
Steve should stop looking. He swallowed, feeling the heat rise from his belly. He focused his gaze on the space between Tony’s eyebrows.
Tony blinks his eyes open, turning on the bed to find a glass of water. He’s been called a futurist, but Tony doesn’t have that much foresight to prepare a glass of water for himself after a night of partying. The water is cool, the glass has condensation. He doesn’t remember bringing anyone home. He doesn’t remember much. His head still feels like it's filled with cotton and his body is heavy. Sitting up, he drinks the water in slow, measured gulps. Tony presses the cool glass to his forehead, hoping it would alleviate his headache.
, he is.
Things are different now.
He didn’t know how long he stayed there. JARVIS sounded distressed, asking Steve to respond to simple questions and cues. But Steve was hardly breathing as he cradled Tony’s body to his chest. He kept feeling the pulse on Tony’s neck with his lips. He tasted bitterness in his tongue as he pressed a thumb to Tony’s wrist. Steve kissed his face, over and over again, cold and wet with tears.
Tony. God. Tony used to hold Steve’s belly, teasing him about his defined abs and kissing his nipples. Steve would flick him on the ear, then haul him up and place his bare ass on the counter. Then, they’d kiss for what felt like hours before they both hopped to the showers and fuck rough and tender and good, and so full of love.
Steve’s hand was so warm, and Tony leaned into it, miserable.
“JARVIS, can you call the kids to the workshop once they all wake up?”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, we are under strict orders not to provide alcohol for the rest of your stay.”
He thinks that he might have put an end to that after Siberia. After he took half the team and Tony remained here.
“It’s okay, it’s alright, son. I understand.” Steve ruffled his hair, willing his face to stay still, to not crumble. He didn’t succeed. He bit the inside of his cheeks, drawing blood. “You’re welcome, kid. From both of us.”
I have lines that are seared into my brain.
Everything seemed stagnant. Steve had a mediocre job that no longer granted him satisfaction. He was an Avenger when there was a world catastrophe, but mostly, SHIELD had him running around the country putting out fires with Natasha and Clint. He learned that agents were constrained by protocols and always had the possibility of being subdued and dismissed if they didn’t follow the ironclad rules.
There was the sound of alcohol being washed down the drain. It was fine. He'd call the front desk and ask them to bring champagne this time.
There are only six returnees, as the paper’s taken to calling them. Parker. Drew. Lawson. Barnes. Rhodes. Rogers.
Bile rises from his throat, a sour taste in the back of his teeth.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I don’t deserve it, I know,” Tony repeated, crying. “I’m so tired.”
“Nothing.” Steve grinned, ducking his head. He was glad for their off days from Avengers assignments. Tony just returned the previous evening from a trip to Singapore with Pepper. They had SI business regarding new tech and green energy.
and listen to my kids’ educational progress. Where Tony can’t be. Homecoming for Peter. Prom. All that shit, Nat. He’ll miss it. And—” Steve hiccuped, fists closed. He blinked, trying to center himself. He wasn’t going to break down today. He wasn’t. He couldn’t. It’s Christmas. No crying during the holidays. “And I miss him.”
The bed still smelled like Tony: spicy, a hint of something masculine, but also a tang of medicine, an acidic touch. He stopped smelling like grease and motor oil since the recurrence. It didn’t feel real.
Steve pushed his plate away, not hungry. He’s taken to shoving food down his throat because he needed the energy. He needed to sustain his health for his kids. He was alive goddamn it, so why was it so hard to live?
Fully dressed, Steve turned off the lights and padded over to the bed. He tugged at the duvet and slipped in.
“Can you stop trying to die?” Steve whispered, harshly, turning and shifting to the middle of the bed until they were just inches apart. “I am broken up about this, Tony. It was always me and you. You remember that? How they used to joke that we’re Mom and Dad? I think of that, us in the Mansion, us in the Tower, leading the team, doing good in this world, and I think, I can do
“You can. Do it.” Steve eagerly thrusts deeper and deeper, only pulling out to add another finger inside.
“Then what did you mean?” Steve asks. Tony refuses to glance at him, no matter how many times Steve drops his head to catch his eyes. But he doesn’t give up, when the side walk blinks to a stop, he tries to reach for Tony, then shortly stops. “Tony?”
“Excuse me,” the man points at himself and Tony. “We’re having a conversation and you’re interrupting. See yourself out.”
“Would you rather I didn’t know? Would you rather live a lie?”
Tony held his gaze. The fire in him seemed to evaporate. A surprised expression passed across his face and he seemed to decide something. “Steve.” He raised a hand, then set it back down.
“Taking the mantle, huh?” Steve smiles encouragingly.
Steve walked down the basement and entered his code for the workshop. The double doors opened with a soft click. The scene in front of him ripped his heart out, inch by inch, until he was flayed and threadbare. Steve swallowed, hard.
Tony comprehended their words and still talked science with Peter and Harley, even though it was hard for him to invent. His bones ached. His back hurt. It was a struggle to stand. But even through all the pain, Tony guided the boys’ science projects and watched DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers work on small-scale gadgets in the workshop with Tony’s and JARVIS’ instructions.
Maybe he should say it, maybe he should utter these words, see if they mean something to Steve. He wants to, he wants to, but he doesn’t. Tony loses himself in the rhythm of Steve rubbing his warm, lubed fingers over his hole.
“I learned something. From the group.”
Tony passes Riri and pushes her back to reach for another pan, then a plate. They all have their stations. They’re used to the movement of each other’s bodies and gauge how much space to take on the counter. It’s eerily similar to being in the battlefield with the smooth ways they work around each other, tossing fruit into each other’s awaiting mouth.
Pitt'o Nili walks to Reed Richards, puts his hands up in surrender.
All the while, the town moves on, Steve Rogers smiles at him from across the town hall.
It was just for the night. Steve should really learn to stop asking for so much. Just for the night, he repeats to himself, again and again until he can’t hear the subway announcing the next stop.
Belatedly, Tony remembers that his man served in the Army, so he announces himself. “Hey, Steve right?”
Steve stands there, hands rubbing at the front of his denim, wishing for a different response. Maybe he wasn’t the only one who didn’t get any sleep last night.
“Fuck, yes. Can’t wait to ride you, big guy. Ugh. I bet you're big.”
“Would you believe me if I said it’s because I want you?” Steve murmurs, touches Tony’s nape and plays with the short, fine hair there. Tony stays very still and holds his breath. “I’m him. It’s really me. Everything he felt, thought, it was always about you. We’re still the same in that regard. But unlike him, I’ll take what I want.”
Tony snorts. “In fact, I did. Is this what you did, what you’ve done, all these years? Help the little guy when their truck stops?”
He shook his head, then realized Tony wasn’t even looking at him. Instead, Tony sat on the sleek leather couch, cross-legged, and waved him over.
“Just because you’re not Captain America anymore, doesn’t mean you can’t have anymore fun with your old toys. Well, it would be a new toy in this case.” Tony grins and wiggles his brows. “Hmmm. How about I paint it hot rod red and gold this time?”
He said he didn’t want to lose their freedom. But here they are.
Harley quirked his lip, a fleeting smile that’s barely there at all. “Yeah. Sure.”
“This is the song they danced to.
Pitt'o Nili has Steve’s belt and leather gloves. Steve is incredibly handsome. Blond hair, a golden hole framed by a thick rope.
On the sofa was Tony’s blue velvet blanket, purchased from a thrift store in the Lower East Side.
“Tony, please.” Steve turned around to see Tony petting for something in his discarded pants with a huff. He grinned, holding up the small bottle of lube. “So you just really wanted to fuck me in the roof top, didn’t you?”
On their way back to the hotel, a woman asks for help in grabbing her fallen groceries, a young child falls off his bike, and a man’s car stops working in the middle of the road. The woman’s apples are easily picked up, and Steve runs into the nearest mart to acquire a paper bag.
“Tell me about him,” Steve adds, pocketing the keys and taking a seat.
“Oh. Will I?”
“You can come, Tony,” Steve whispers, kissing his back. “Let me hear you. Don’t deny me.”
People lived their lives knowing that death was inevitable. But Captain America and Iron Man saw the end of the world many times over and survived it each time.
“I do everything I can for them—the same old things.” He laughed, the ugly sound echoing in the room. This house used to be filled with jokes and laughter. Now his kids barely smile. “I don’t know how to live without him. It’s pretty pathetic, isn’t it? My entire life, since waking up from the ice was being Captain America. Being with Tony. Being a father, being Tony Stark’s husband. I don’t know what to do without him.”
“In a bit. I like watching you with him. You, together.” Steve sat down on the rocking chair in the corner, listening to Tony hum a song.
He offers Tony the spare key, and they walk back out to fetch their bags from the truck. Steve has his portfolio bag for the shield and the battered duffel. He hands Tony his own luggage, then they make their way back to the hotel in silence.
“Alright. Do you want to bring your blanket?” The sun was out, but Tony was perpetually cold these days. He was wrapped up in a sweater, hair peeking out from his cap. Steve kissed his nose.
“Tell me, then, tell me, what it is,” Tony urged, catching the taste of his tears as they stream down his face. “Can we still fix this?”
He dropped his face on Steve’s chest, too afraid to see what Steve looked like, too afraid to show Steve what a mess he was.
But sometimes I can’t think that I’m supposed to do more. Be out there in the field.”
Steve read articles and interviews on Tony Stark’s vision for rebranding his father’s company into Stark Resilient. He’s the future of the world, no doubt. Tony needed someone who could make sure he could accomplish everything he ever dreamed about. Steve’s taken the liberty of tracking and conducting background checks on Stark Industries’ board members and his circle of friends. Stane was gunning for Tony’s CEO position. Steve would ensure that Stane would never get his dirty, bloody hands on Tony’s seat. He wanted to meet Tony and thank him for being Steve’s rock while deployed.
In answer, Steve thinks he’s got everything he needs now, everything he’s ever wanted. Family, stability, a home full of love. He’s never stopped being the man who desired all those things. Only now, he knows he can have it — he has it — and he’s deserving of it.
Steve doesn't stop until dawn comes. He falls to his knees, the shield to his side, then he watches the sun rise and color the pine trees in flashes of light.
“Hello, Avengers!” Morgan rushed out her room with Peter and Harley in tow.
The screeching on the tracks announced the train’s near arrival.
Steve opened the fridge and fried up a carton of eggs and bacon. Morgan padded over, kissing her papa on the cheek before marching to her little kiddie stool. She assisted with adding the English muffins into the toaster. As they finished setting the dishes, his three boys padded over and began scarfing down breakfast.
He stayed with one knee planted on the concrete. “You told me that the team thought we were secretly married.”
Tony Stark was a man who knew he was handsome and brilliant, but he seemed to doubt that he was wanted. Maybe that’s Steve’s fault. They didn’t have a good start with at the helicarrier. Their camaraderie seemed better after a few missions, but those have been far in between. SHIELD tried to keep Tony Stark out of their business, only using him as a consultant when it benefited them.
The bathroom door creaks open, and Tony sidesteps Steve’s position by the window and lifts his blanket up, sliding in without another word. He looks incredibly young. Younger like this: hair wet and soaking the sheets, eyes tired with sleep.
Tony fights his orgasm, grabs Steve by the neck and thrusts up. “No, I want to come inside your mouth after you’re done.”
he would pass them their packed lunch and see them out the door as they headed off to school. We love you so much. Have a good day.
“Play the damned song, Stark.” Steve’s hands go to rest on his belt buckle, the ridges reading US for United States, Steve, so patriotic and rightetous. It's fitting. Tony wishes to mend the belt and change the letters to TS instead. Maybe he can convince Steve to wear it, one of these days, but only in their quarters, of course.
He slicks himself up with the lube Rumiko gave him and lines up his cock. Rumiko told him in advance that he doesn’t need the rubber. Tony and Rumiko are both clean, and as long as Captain America’s comfortable with that, there’s no issue.
“Well?” Tony prods, setting his work down to turn and raise an eyebrow at Steve.
With a heavy sigh, Steve ushered the children to their bedrooms to get ready for the memorial service.
In the last forty-one months, he asked himself whether any action would have made a difference and whether Tony’s death was inevitable.
winghead
Steve takes the out. “Yeah, sorry.”
His quick drop is expected, even with the lower dose.
Peter nodded, offering a quiet comfort, and it hurt to see something that belonged to Tony be used by their son. Tony was supposed to be here, dammit, wearing that damned posh sunglasses. Then, Tony’s supposed to make a joke about being the most handsome Stark. Then, he was supposed to kiss Steve and then he was supposed to—
He settles closer to Steve, lining their bodies together, then he’s whispering up to Steve, and takes what’s his. “Goodnight, sweetheart.”
Tony laughed, the sound deep and open. “Then you’ll have to say that for the rest of our lives.”
“I swear, I’ll go bankrupt if you keep ripping my clothes off me.”
He swallows Tony down, movements unhurried, dragging the time out so he doesn't have to leave so soon. He reaches down, pressing two fingers back into Tony, fucking his come back inside.
The world fucking ended.
“When?”
“Yeah, some futurist I am.”
“Sam Wilson, you’ve been remiss on fucking your boyfriend outdoors. We’ll have a talk about that later. But now, go away because Steve needs to keep sucking me off.”
Tony rolled his eyes with a half, twisting over to watch Steve.
“No, no, no, he’s still working,” Rumiko says, unbuckling her harness. “Let me give you something to do in the meantime.” She sets the strap-on by the edge of the side table, then crawls over to the head of the bed frame, rearranges some pillows, and opens her legs for Tony’s face. She pulls Tony by the hair, dragging him to her cunt.
said that it was acceptable to cry.
Steve,
“Well,” Tony pauses, and it feels like an eternity where Steve holds his breath. “You didn’t come.”
“Yeah,” Riri follows up. “And why come back now?”
How nice it must be for two parents to watch their kid grow up.
“We cannot say for sure until after the surgery, Captain Rogers. Mr. Stark will need radiation afterwards, most likely for a few months.  It's best if we prepare now," Mr. Lee answered with a nod. "We'll give you a few minutes and return for prep."
He stops, stands there on the sidewalk, and watches the pedestrians of New York honk and holler like nothing has changed. People still walk quickly, side stepping each other to get from one street to the other. People run down the steps and disappear into the dim lights of the subway station. There are vendors in the corner fiddling with their phones and bagging up kebabs. Others scoop roasted almonds into little brown paper bags and exchange them for a few loose bills.
“Right.” Tony leaned back against Nat’s ministrations. He relaxed into her care. “Well, I’m fine now, so no worries, Cap.”
He doesn’t want it that way. No, never did. But sometimes Steve can’t keep his mouth shut. Nor does he want to. He needs to say what he wants or a sinking feeling will take over, a volcano of emotions and resentment builds and builds, tethering with coarse and sharp words until it erupts into fists thrown against the wall.
He had his family, this little Christmas celebration, that should be enough.
He came closer, so near Steve.
“That’s why he doesn’t want to play it.” Harley glared at him, arms crossed.
Steve shrugs. “Grew up there. But it’s been a while since I went back. I was in the Army the last couple of years.”
Whatever it may be, looks back, smiles, nods.
Never will be.
When he got out of ice, the SHIELD medical team showed him his x-rays. His lungs are pristine. He’s in good health. Everything is fine, perfect, even. But he wonders if he is nothing but his abilities these days. His utility to the world. If that’s what Captain America is — hero, teammate, friend, patriot — he doesn’t know who Steve Rogers is otherwise.
Steve lips twitched. The feeling of his mouth dragging up seemed like a foreign concept. He savored the feeling, even if he felt guilty. It’s okay to smile, even without—
“Captain America?” Steve raised the cup, inspecting the red, white, and blue shield painted on the side.
The sun was high up. Their bodies were slightly shaded by the veranda and the overgrown vines climbing up on the wooden structure.
There’s a figure walking towards them. Four, to be exact. One is walking backwards, gesturing wildly with their hands. The other is skipping and laughing, long hair blowing against the wind. He registers that Bruce is at the edge, hands in his jacket’s pocket, a sheepish, distracted smile on his face.
Their time at the Mansion just earlier is still fresh in his mind.
“So what do I call you? Rogers? I feel like I ought to be proper in the face of you.”
All of town, even the kids, are in the square. Kate, Tommy, and Cassandra stand on the sidelines, flanked by the Richard’s. Parker is the back, an arm around his aunt.
His hands shake, haunted by flesh turning green and the smell of rotting bodies. The pigs snorting in their hogs. “In a moment, Miss Barnes.”
Tony grabs a couple of serving spoons and a loaf of bread. Finally, he turns, and tells Steve, “You should talk to her. She drinks too much.”
“Ah.” She nods in understanding, and its rather awkward even though Steve has been asked the same question nearly every other day. Maybe he never learned to school his features as unaffected. Maybe grief and the last decade is still etched on his face. “Disappeared,” she adds, voice trailing down as if it’s a question.
Steve listens and counts the low tides creeping against the shore. From their vantage point, cars speed past the lanes. A new song plays from the stereos perched on the staccato textured walls. The woman beside him erupts in a coo, and they clap as the song begins, shaking their shoulders up and down, smiles gracing their features.
Steve stilled, letting his climax wash over him. He opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Tony’s soft, satisfied smile. They kissed, slow because they had time.
When you’re hurting, you hurt people who want you to be better. Shove them away so they don’t see that there’s nowhere else to go but downhill.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees, thinking of losing Bucky again, not being able to get to know the man he’s become, and would have become after the triggers were removed. His mind drifts to Sam, too caring, a man with too much heart and an easy going smile. Wanda and Vision. Then, T’Challa’s kindness which Steve will never be able to repay.
“Everything is good here.” Tony pushes off, and walks towards him only to turn to the dining room. He straightens the chairs, still not facing Steve.
Steve sighed. “Why are you so insistent on punishing yourself?”
Steve took my left hand and had it stitched back by medical. I don’t know what’s worse. The false generosity of his mercy, or the searing pain of the cut from his shield.
“Sorry, what was that?”
steve, steve, steve,
“You know, if I could, I would hold you in my arms forever.”
“I would have blinded him, but he’s Hawkeye for a reason, so I settled on taking his arms,” Steve explains, voice unaffected, like seeing their friends’ cruel death is normal. “I started with a finger as a warning, but you know him, he doesn’t listen.”
The body turns green.
The bed rocks forward and back with the force of their bodies. Tony's pulling him close, and Steve's grinding his teeth so a sob doesn't escape.
“You’ve been drinking,” Steve said, mouth in a grim line.
“God, Tony, stop trying to be strong for me.” Steve kissed his temple, not caring for the slob he’s wiping between their faces. “Are you okay?”
He nods, flicks his cigarette and watches the ash dance towards the concrete floor. “You’ll be the first to know.”
He put the yellow shirt back to the drawer then wiped his eyes. His vision was blurry, but that’s alright. He moved forward, grabbing a handful of Tony's jeans and placing them into the box, topping it with a set of Tony’s running shoes and taped it shut.
He stayed plastered on the chair a beat longer, then straightened his back. He waved Bucky’s concern away and gathered the dishes. He placed all the leftover food in containers and  stacked the dirty plates on their deep porcelain sink.
I close my eyes for a moment, gathering my thoughts, pulling myself together, thrusting this awful suit around me.
Steve gently presses at his shoulder. “I’ll take care of you. You need someone to care for you.” He lowers Tony’s wrists back to the hand, then rubs at his arms, up and down. “You have nothing to worry about now, darling.” Steve kisses him again, taking his time to skate his fingers on Tony’s ribs then down his torso.
Forgive me.
Steve reaches for the glass of water, points the paper straw between Tony’s lips. “Suck, go on.”
Tony fiddles with the jukebox, makes a frustrated sound before handing the barkeep a fifty dollar bill then getting a set of coins in exchange. Steve shakes his head at the show of wealth. Tony’s never really flaunted it.
There's a statue of you in Arlington. Big and looming. If you were alive, you'd probably blush all the way down to your neck. I never told you, but I liked that sight. Of you, red and embarrassed because you can't take a damn compliment, Steve. Just take it, alright. We commissioned a kid, an artist from Brooklyn to complete the sculpture. Found her profile on the local paper. The President wanted to have this French-Swiss artist do an interpretive sculpture of you, with all these broadlines and dull colors. But Jan, Carol, and I vetoed it. The sculpture the kid made  is how the people see you, Steve. Wish you were here to see it too.
Tony is sunkissed. Steve can tell even if he doesn’t have his shirt off, even under the moonlight. His arms are tanned in an olive tone, and they’re toned, showing his hard work in the lab. Steve would know, he’s read all the articles on Tony Stark, even the ones from the gossip rag magazines. He even had his local library order articles Tony published.
“No, no.” Tony shakes his head, pointing at Red Wolf, looking anywhere but the shining badge on his chest. “If you’re suggesting — no, you’ve got it all wrong, Red Wolf. Rogers and I — he’s not. You’re wrong, he’d never. Not ever.”
Steve pulses, coming hard at the sound of Tony’s breathy voice. He lets himself ride the wave. Gravity pulls him down. He kisses the side of Tony’s face, his jaw, his temple, his eyelids. Tony soothes his back, rubbing circles from his traps to his delts. He’s humming, purring even, telling Steve that he’s all filled and it feels so good to have come inside him.
“No, I’m seeing this through.” Steve’s voice is dark, excited. The sounds are very far away, like Tony’s hearing the world unfold underwater.
Tony could do it too, heal his broken body, upgrade his brain. Be better, faster, stronger. Playing god, that’s what Steve always feared.
Steve guessed that’s what happened when Agent Romanoff retired from the field—she needed to oversee active missions. Fury passed on the torch to her and Maria Hill five years ago. Rumor had it that Fury went to work for another underground organization or was running ops in outer space. Steve didn’t bother asking anymore. Maria and Natasha just smirked and ignored any snide comments about that.
(See the end of the chapter for
you. you. i dont know what im trying to say, but i only think of one word
“Welcome home,” Tony says, empty.
“Stark, you have a bodyguard at a party, really?” The man, Victor, sneers, then eyes Steve. “Fuck off.”
The woman and Stone put a hand on Tony, trying to pull him onto the dance floor. But Tony waves them away, instead, spinning on his seat and drinking from a red plastic cup. Just as Steve is about to approach, another man in a suit walks to Tony and starts a conversation. Tony is seemingly annoyed, rolling his eyes and pulling away from the man. While everyone is prancing half-naked and still wet from the beach, this man looks out of place with his suit jacket and slicked-back hair.
His family all stood by the lake and they parted with nods and pats on the back for Steve. Morgan stood between Harley and Peter, holding onto the latter’s hand.
Steve grinned as Morgan went for the middle of the bed and grabbed the bowl of fresh blueberries. Peter, more somber than his siblings, sat beside Steve on the end of the bed. They all squeezed together as Steve began plating the breakfast. Morgan grabbed the carnation and twisted its ends off.
“Don’t be an asshole, baby. You’re always on my mind.” Tony rocked his ass up and down and grabbed Steve’s head. “Look at me. You hear me, Steve? Some days, you’re all I think about.”
Tony shook with laughter. “Did you tell her that it was Steve who said that?”
A flame appears out of nowhere, flying towards the Skrulls, and Sue yells for Johnny, and suddenly disappears.
It’s already set for six.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t write as often, or call, or text, I — I’m not good at words,” Steve tries, grimacing at the sound of his voice.
He lets it fester. Build a nest inside his chest and turn over memories of Steve Rogers.
There are more frames down the hall, but Tony cannot look past the macabre way Tigra’s photograph is shot up close, as if the detail of her death is enjoyable.
Riri laughs and briefly settles her head on Tony’s shoulder. “You’re funny if you think I’m ever leaving you.”
I won’t remember you.
“Oh, shut up. I married you. I decide what I want, and I want you.”
“Hm?”
The only bruises he has on his body are self-inflicted. A gauntlet falling over his arms. A hammer falling from the table and onto his foot.
“Sir.” The man on the phone coughed.
Soon, Samuel’s truck disappears down the block and makes a left turn at the second stop.
“You sure?” Steve raises an eyebrow, feeling his nerves melt away. He's suddenly feeling euphoric, and it's not because of the pill. “You’ve been drinking. And you just did lines.”
Erasing your brain is pretty shitty. Wouldn’t recommend. Losing sight of the future. Some futurist who forgets.
“I can’t believe you garden now,” Rhodes says with a laugh. “Retirement suits you.”
He needs to find Tony. This place doesn’t look too safe, especially with drug-addled beach goers taking off their tops and bottoms, exchanging spit.
God, they cried about everything.
We buried Janet today.
They loved science and looked nothing alike. Whereas Peter took after Tony’s earnestness, he was also so naive. Steve didn’t have the heart to tell him that it’s a cold-blooded world full of disappointments.
“Do you want to come?”
She dropped the pliers, not bothering to pull off the nails on the inside of his elbows. “He doesn’t hate you.”
Steve woke up on another Tuesday with a clear goal in mind.
He looked at the cabinet. Tony’s gin and bourbon remained untouched. Steve stared at it some evenings and if the light was just right, he could see Tony’s fingerprints. He wasn’t going to cry, not when there’s company.
It’s a bit of a sore spot for Steve. No contact between them until the end of the world.
Steve doesn’t know what to do, but that’s the great thing about running, whether you’re on your feet, in a plane soaring higher than the clouds, or in a car, you don’t always have to think too hard. In the car, it’s simple. It’s break, go, break, go, turn left, turn right. Break and go. There’s no right side, no wrong side, just the road where you want to go.
Steve,
“No.”
“You smoke?”
“Alright.” He breathes out and suddenly, they’re meeting halfway. Tony kisses him first because Steve’s blush is red. Red like the blood Tony spat out in the Mansion. “Alright, my love,” he’s choking on the words now, but it’s true. It isn’t a lie. There’s no masks here. No deception, not like the EMP. No, bullshit. It's Tony bare, naked with Steve and there's something that's almost close to still being in love here.
“I know.”  Steve hid himself on Tony’s shoulder. His body was cold even under the sun. “I’m — Tony, I. I love you. Please.”
“Everyone will be there. Just our family, it’ll be okay, they’ll wanna see you.”
Shellhead
“I want to talk.” Tony forced the words out, inspecting the bubbles popping in the water.
“It’s me, Stark,” Steve says, tucking his head.
“I’m way over 18!” Peter says with a mouthful of chips. “I’m an adult.”
The cafe is set on high terrain overlooking the cool waves. The sea is a funny thing. No matter how many times it’s pushed away from shore, it returns, again and again, endless in its perseverance. He thinks he used to be a bit like that, a man who doesn’t know when to stop. A man too stubborn to stay away from the chase, a man running towards the cold waters, no care that he’s got no spare clothes.
Except, well, maybe that might not be true. The happiness comes in waves, and now, as he looks over to see Rumiko's scrunched up face on the verge of coming, it registers that Tony and Rumiko will have this for the rest of their lives. Steve is just here for a moment. He’s a wild animal passing in the juncture of an intersection. He'll cross the road and go on his way after this. It's just for tonight.
“Alright, Captain Handsome. I’ll be more careful. Just so you know, I am careful, Steve. That was a calculated risk. JARVIS informed me that the chances for survival were high. You don’t have to carry the world’s burden on your shoulder. If I fuck up in the field, that isn’t on you.”
Tony offers his palm, waiting, like he knew Steve had another pill.
Tony grins and lets himself be picked up. He wipes his hands on his jeans and ruffles the kid’s hair. “No problem, kid.”
Tony should be used to this violation by now. But he’s not.
“It’s not a dream. It’s me. I’m alive.”
“Still is.” Tony steps forward, holds the shield with both hands, and keeps his eyes trained on Steve.
“Yeah, um,” there he goes again, scratching at his temple and being out of his depth. So, instead, Steve just goes for honesty. “I’ll head out. You’ll be alright?”
to be Steve. Whole, alive, well.
A laugh escapes Steve. “I have no idea what I’m doing.”
But none of that mattered when Steve dropped to hide his face in the juncture of Tony's throat.
He cuts off the wonders. Is he what?
“Ok, ok, you’re doing so good,” Steve says, thrusting harder. The praise makes Tony’s toes curl, and his stomach is filled with deep hatred for how he could want this.
Like tomorrow won’t come.
She shoves a stick to Steve’s open face and laughs. “You look stupid.”
His brain worked at an incredible speed, yet it only led him to these maudlin thoughts. It should be better. He should be able to compartmentalize, determine the next course of action in this pedestrian life of his. Tony laid there, paralyzed by his inability to digest the influx of information Extremis was sending him. Memories, thoughts, all ugly and jagged, like a shadowed past he was unable to hide.
It has been too long. Steve ducks his head and pulls up the chair across from her. She lumps further into the rolling chair. “Trouble sleeping?”
Steve pauses, watching her. She’s a tiny thing compared to him, ramming her huge strap-on into Tony’s ass. Her manicured fingers are tight on Tony’s hips, thrusting in and out, in a slow, languid pace. Like they have all the time in the world.
Steve frowned. He asked the kids not to go there. Steve wasn’t ready to clean up the suits. He had no idea what to do with them and he hadn't read Tony’s will yet, so he didn’t know the protocol. Tony planned his death: he made Pepper CEO with the stipulation of one of the kids taking over if they wished. JARVIS announced that the armor had upgrades. Tony gave him a list of Christmas present ideas, anticipating all their children’s taste and needs. Tony was a futurist. But did he foresee Steve’s demise after his death?
Steve
“You’re not ready,” Tony hummed.
have purpose? Do you know what that is?”
“If the axe breaks and you replace the head, is it still the same axe?” Then he added as an afterthought, “The original saying was the Ship of Theseus. I’m not replacing memories, though.”
He smiles, shifting on the seat, but keeping his fingers steady on the piano keys. “What’s next, Sheriff?”
Everything will be fine. I’m still committed. Wipe myself clean, even though I’ll never forgive myself. For everything I’ve done. I won’t remember it. That’s death, it must be that. We’re only alive as long as we’re remembered, aren’t we? Personality, memories, feelings. Is that what makes us human, Steve? It might not be enough. Not without empathy. Not without guilt.
Stars are just balls of gas that stay stagnant until they die. When they've reached the expiry date, they blow up and take everything with them.
”All endings happen. That’s life. But the scientist in me wants to argue that’s all relative. Time, death, existence. You don’t go be a genius and know all these things about life and not have an existential crisis. But fearing and waiting for death was just that. I had to accept it even if I didn’t want to. I wish I wasn’t a better man, maybe I’d find a way to fix this. I woke up every morning wondering if it would be my last. Would my organs finally fail? Would I go into cardiac arrest in the middle of the night where you, Steve—where your father, God, would find me with my last breath. I hope that when I die, it’s in your arms, Steve. You know our song. I hope it’s just like that, Steve, with your arms around me. Everything will be fine. This is the hardest thing I’ll ever do—leaving you. It’s the last thing I’ll do.”
And now, Steve had to do the work of living the rest of his life without him. Just a memory, a specter that haunted him in the quiet of the nights, a shadow that followed him like a carres. He saw Tony in their kids—in Harley’s crooked smirk, in Morgan’s eyes, in Peter’s earnestness.
It’s love. Because he loves you. He loves them. It’s all about that.
He wanted to shout and punch his jaw and forget that Steve had saved him from a burning building years ago, and yet they were here, in this moment, the wheel kept spinning.
“Hi,” Steve says after a beat.
, Steve doesn’t say. He kisses Tony’s cheek, memorizing the rasp of his beard.
“Your dad said that we have the rest of our lives.” Steve inhaled deeply, trying to center himself. “And I think, in that moment it was true. He spent the rest of his life with me. With us. It was true for him.”
Time goes by.
It’s just this once.
“You can keep drinking if you want.”
They get two blocks down, when the find a man cursing his van and gesturing wildly at the engine.
The water was too hot but Tony didn’t complain. It smelled like lavender. Tony sighed, dropping further into the waters.
“It’s cute.” Morgan smiled, reaching for Tony’s hand. She squeezed it tight, three times, laughing as their fingers collapsed on each other.
And you. You, again. Even now,
back in Aghfan.
That’s the thing about perfect recall. Steve remembers it all.
Then, there’s Tony spinning on a barstool doing lines. He’s wearing a grin, but Steve knows better. Someone’s making him smile. Why else would Tony be here if he wasn’t under some sort of pressure? No, it’s better to eliminate the drug use, clean up his act. Someone needs to take care of Tony.
“You remember the first time we kissed?”
It began as nothing. Just stress relief. Tony was his lifeline to the outside world. Steve appreciated that. Then, he read about Stark’s family history, the death of his parents, and how he was turning his father’s weapons company into something better—green energy, sustainability, medical instruments, affordable tech for the public.
Tony holds Steve’s face with both palms, outlining the shape of his cheekbones. His movements pause for a moment, too short to really notice. There’s a question there, but Steve kisses him quiet.
Steve wants to lie, tell her no, not really, he’s been alone his whole life.
He would sit on the unoccupied stool beside Tony, breathe down his neck and watch, mesmerized, by those nimble fingers and that smart mouth explaining how circuits worked and what sort of improvements he’d be making to everyone’s gear.
Delete, delete, delete.
Tony slid in, biting down the argument at the tip of his tongue.
“Hmm.”
He could feel his t-shirt getting damp. Steve scrubbed Peter’s head. He let his own tears fall.
He twists the key and turns off the engine.
“Sorry. But look.” The woman snaps his attention with a slight push to his shoulder. She directs both their gazes to the child staring at them. “New life.”
“Honeybear, you flew the suit just to get me these. I’m gonna eat them. God, I hope I don’t vomit.” Tony opened his mouth for another piece. Steve delivered it, breaking off a sliver and pressing it to Tony’s mouth. “Thank you, baby.” Tony kissed his thumb, chewed, then swallowed with a grimace.
“Wait, don’t you—are you sure you’re alright? Can we—” Steve looks around the area. There’s the night life from the parties down the block, and the streets are filled with drunken and drug-addled people, laughing and cursing. Some kid falls off a skateboard and lights a cigarette. Out in the distance, the beach is nearly empty, save for a couple of bonfires and couples. The area by the shoreline is empty, possibly because the waters are too cold at this time of night. Steve points to the distance. “Could we just sit for a second?”
Once he makes it out of his room, he finds Natasha lounging in the sitting room. She has both feet up on the conference table, still in her pajamas, looking like she hasn’t slept at all.
“Same shit, different day. My husband’s dead and I’m raising our kids alone.” Steve crossed his arms and leaned against the cushions. He remembered the day they picked the sofa. Harley spilled engine oil on it and Morgan threw up on the back pillow when she had the flu. So much history on this simple furniture. Steve couldn’t throw it away.
Tony has to go on and keep living.
“Those kids were too boisterous for this town. What I tell you, Stark. This town is full of crazies.”
It pisses him off when the townsfolk give him shaky smiles. For what reason, Tony doesn’t understand.
“Eat, kiddos,” Tony commands, pointing at their still-full plates. “Got to get your nutrients after sparring.”
On and on, two years on the run, and three years more — Steve is running and running, unable to remember when the marathon began.
“I know, baby.”
“Yes, Tony?” He steps away from the kitchen and passes Tony a glass of iced tea.
You asked me a question that day.
.” Tony's head hangs inches from the pillows and he's groaning, hands gripping the sheets. His hair is slick with sweat. They must have been going at this for a while and Steve wonders if Tony fucked Rumiko first, if he fingered her open, if he sucked on her clit before she put on the harness. Tony reaches back with one hand, but it’s shoved away with a firm no.
He’s been a widower for almost two years now. He hated that word: w-i-d-o-w-e-r. It was ugly and it didn’t roll off the tongue with ease. It was like swallowing shards of glass.
“FRIDAY, tell them dinner’s ready.”
“You know what I want, don’t  you?” He can’t help the wet laugh that erupts from him.
Steve raises his hand, braces it on Tony’s shoulder. With his other hand, he tilts Tony’s head.
“Rogers,” he greets, wiping the grease on his overalls. His hair is a mess and he smothers the desire to push it back. It doesn’t matter. Steve isn’t here for what they’ve referred to as a check-in.
Tony settles down on the chair.
“You bastard. You killed him — how could you. You’re sick. Don’t blame my people for that.”
Steve turns the door knob, pulls it open, and looks behind his shoulder one last time. Tony’s face is guarded, but his gaze doesn’t drift. With effort, Steve tries to smile and leaves.
“Alright, alright, point taken.” Steve makes a big show of finishing his plate and grabbing seconds just to see Tony’s tentative smile. “Hmmm, good.”
“Disproving a genius, good luck.” Tony smiled, plump red lips a contrast to his dark mustache.
“Hey now.” Steve can’t help but trace the lines crinkling beside his eyes even if irritation springs upon him. “Language.”
Steve moaned at the thought, slicking Tony’s cock with more spit. He spread it on the shaft and head, twisting his hand just right so Tony was moaning and thrusting up.
This wasn’t healthy.
He runs a hand over Tony’s hair, caresses his face, smoothing the lines on the corner of his eyes. “Ssst—”
“Take care of yourself, alright? I know you. You’ll take care of the kids, you will and you’ll be amazing at it. I just wish I was doing this—life, parenting, all of it with you. I’m sorry I can’t, baby. That I won’t be there. I’m so— ”
I’m fucked up. I drank, I’m drinking now.
I saw us at war, Steve. I've told you this. I was scared. I needed a solution. This was the best I could do with the hands we were dealt.
He turns to blow the smoke away from Tommy, not sure how to react. His eyes linger on the Sheriff’s station, then drift to the pigsty. “Kid, you don’t gotta believe everything you hear.”
Tony licks his lips. "In all your travels, I’m sure you’ve had a bunch of different dishes. Is Menudo still your favorite food?”
“I’m glad she has you,” Steve says.
Steve rubs his chin. “I knew you never liked the beard.”
Miss Barnes nods, eyes far away. She stands beside Barnes, their fingers intertwined.
“Oh, and leave me to work out here in the sun, huh?” Tony finally looks up, and his lips twist in an exaggerated frown.
“Wait, are you fucking serious right now?”
That’s all it was. Just a pause.
“I assure you, sir,” Steve interrupts with what he hopes is a placating smile, “he’s the best mechanic I’ve ever met.”
There’s a song Steve hasn’t listened to in a long, long time.
“I know he doesn’t hate me. I wouldn’t be here if he did.” She holds his gaze for a second longer then pulls away, leading them to the side of the track. “Still. Sometimes our brain tells us things we don’t want to hear.”
“Fuck you.” I spit on his face.
“What’s the problem?” Tony stands by the car as the man lifts up the hood to reveal the engine.
The hands cupping him squeeze, hard, no remorse for the beating Tony just endured. Then, there’s a slick finger pressing to his entrance. There’s no pleasure in it. Just a quiet sort of detachment, like Steve’s checking that he’s still warm in there.
“Jess, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage.”
“Course. Mayor Danvers made the announcement last night and it’s on the paper.”
The former is Steve and Bucky’s favorite, and growing up, it was always a treat, a burst of robust flavors. But affording it was far and between, so now they’ve taken to planting a tree in the yard. It won’t bloom until next year, or even the year after that, but it’s a start.
With a heart heavy and full of hope, he walks forward, knowing that all of this, this life and its future exists because of her sacrifice. Thank you, Steve raises his head to the sky and thanks her in silence, wherever she is now, he hopes like hell she’s watching in bliss.
“How do you want me?”
Steve returned to the room, ignoring the empty bed frame. He’d get a new bed delivered later today and recycle the old one. It won’t smell like Tony. The mattress in the hall no longer carried Tony’s scent, but Steve liked to imagine that there were still remnants of Tony, on there, somewhere. But he will have to move on, for his own sake and as a way to honor his promise.
Surprisingly, Harley was the quiet kid. He never cried in the middle of night. But now, as a four year old, he was nothing but a tiny little thing with a list of demands.
“Huh?” Tony tilts his head.
He imagines it might not be easy for a child to spend half a week in a city, then be dropped off to another home. Still, he and Tony do their best to accommodate her needs and that means establishing a routine for all of them.
“Steve?”
Harley ran over and smacked a kiss on her cheek, “Aunt Nat, my favorite Aunt!”
He walked her all the way down to the door, where Harley and Peter waited by the steps. Overcome with the pain of grief and gratefulness that he still had his kids, Steve pulled all three of them into a hug.
Steve drops his fingers in the cup, then tilts Tony’s jaw back up, pries his mouth open again, and swirls his fingers onto Tony’s tongue like he’d do if it was his cock. Steve coats his lips with the paste and breathes heavily. Tony doesn’t have to look down to see the erection Steve is sporting. “Now, swallow.”
Steve swallowed, taking his free hand to rub at his damp eyes.
Steve’s shirt clung onto his torso, but instead of doing something about it, he led Tony to the bed. He lifted the sheets up, raising an eyebrow.
I’m looking at a bottle right now. Amber in color and I
“Like I could be… happy. That I don’t have to feel guilty for loving her back. I just
“I’m amenable to that.” Tony groaned as Steve bit his nipple.
Steve scrubbed his eyes, annoyed at the hot tears. How many more years was he going to cry? He was just waiting for his turn, waiting for death to come. He couldn’t think like that. He had his children to care for, but sometimes, there was the fleeting thought: it would be easier if he gave up and followed Tony.
Except, Steve is now interested in Tony’s inventions, particularly the suit. He may have shown interest before, if Tony didn’t spend all his free time getting drunk and rigging the fortune telling machine outside his workshop.
“No. Stop. Don’t say it,” Tony mumbled, turning when Steve tried to tilt his jaw. “Fuck.”
Tony settles on the left. Steve on the right. They meet in the middle and exchange lazy kisses.
There would be more experiences without Tony. There would be endless moments of pure happiness when one of their kids does something incredible—maybe Peter would follow Tony and revolutionize a scientific field. Maybe Harley would do the same. There would be so many more moments of misery until Steve found his way back to Tony.
“Do you always have to be doing something, Steve?”
Steve continues his shallow thrusts, bringing his forehead to Tony’s. The gesture is intimate, and Steve makes it worse by taking a lock of Tony’s hair and pushing it behind his ear. “A dream made real,” he says, fingers finding the wetness on Tony’s eyes and wiping it away.
“There’s something I wanted to say,” Steve explains, hands dropping to his sides. “What I couldn’t say earlier.”
“Yes, well, you know it’s common knowledge to not trust the dealer,” the salesman sighs and taps the side of the door. His gaze measures Steve up and down. “Could never sell that damn thing. Fine, take it off my hands.”
Natasha studies him. He turns away. If she looks too closely, there’s no doubt she’ll read him as easy as a practice target.
“We did. We are warriors.”
Its bright silver star stripped out. He couldn't part with it. It's tactical, the best armor he can get his hands on. Nevermind that it's been years since he last wore it. Sometimes, he thinks it still smells like gunpowder.
But Steve wants this face in perfect condition. No matter how many times he places his fist on it or how he punches me until the ring leaves a dent, Steve always patches me up.
I fucked Maya. Or. We’re fucking. Alright. This isn’t a confession, ok. I don’t know. I think you deserve to know. It’s not serious. We can’t have anything resembling normalcy. I’m me. She’s her. Brilliant and still beautiful. A bioterrorist I’ve employed because I need to watch her and make sure she doesn’t do anything stupid. She still wants Extremis. I’m not signing off. We fuck. She thinks she can get me to give her more permission. She’s always disappointed when I say no. She leaves the bed, goes to the kitchen, makes coffee and leaves for the lab. I stay there, boneless and weary of what’s to come.
Steve rest a hand on Tony’s hips, pulling their fronts to grind together. Tony grabbed Steve’s arms and pulled him down. Steve went to his knees with ease, running a hand over Tony’s trousers, staring at Tony’s half-filled cock.
They stay there in the quiet. Steve can’t look away. He doesn’t even try.
Steve pushes Tony’s sweat-soaked hair back and kisses his temple. He’d rather suffer a cruel death than leave.
Steve’s too good, and all good things eventually leave him.
The waters in the Hudson were clear. Again and again, he heard of all these “positive” outcomes of the Decimation. Fresh water and ecological impacts. Optimists broadcasted these facts every morning alongside pictures of the new world.
Steve shifts up, licking Tony’s mouth open, kissing with a fierceness he doesn’t possess. He musters courage, kisses the corner of Tony’s mouth. There’s a pleased smile there. Steve knows just by the feel—he’s seen it on Tony many times before. This is for him. This smile belongs to him, even if it’s fleeting.
Steve made an irritated sound and stood in one graceful motion. “No, don’t talk. We’re not talking. What I’m doing is getting you clean.” He grabbed Tony’s wrist, and as opposed to his strangled tone, his touch was soft. He helped Tony into the tub, and murmured, “I need you clean.”
One kiss, two kisses. Then, three slow kisses that turned deeper and heated as Tony licks Steve’s mouth open. Their tongues slid together in leisure, not a care in the world that they’re making out on a bench in Central Park.
“Hey, Tony.”
No, no, not now.
“That’s good.” Steve picked up one of the tails and tugs on it. He was not allowed to watch any recordings of him and Tony in the house. Even Tony programmed the AI to make sure Steve didn’t spiral in memories.
Steve wondered why it was so hard to deal with grief. Why couldn’t it have been Steve with the IV attached to his veins and throwing up in the middle of the night?
“Tony, you cry for me in the middle of the night.” Steve laughed, wrapping both hands on Tony’s shoulders. He pressed their foreheads together, breathing in the smell of sweat, blood, and metal.
He tied his entire life—his universe—to Tony.
Steve reaches for his glass of water, sets it down, grabs it again.
“No,” he said, staring at Steve Rogers. He was in civilian clothes and he looked as handsome as ever.
Steve dropped down to an empty chair by the door. It was arranged in a circle but he preferred a seat with a view of all the exits.
No one is listening.
Steve tilts his face, hand hard under his jaw, no doubt adding a spot in Tony’s line of mottled bruises. Steve must enjoy making them appear all over Tony’s skin. “Alcohol would make you hungrier,” Steve says, his tone almost sing-song. “You don’t want that, right? I know how much your sobriety means to you.”
The kids grumbled.
“I want my dad, I want dad, papa, please. Why? I want dad.”
She scoffs. “Sending a couple of text messages every few months isn’t writing.”
He walks towards Tony at the end of the dock, eyes flicking on their friends and family. Peter and Johnny are in matching suits, ties skewed, face flushed.
When Steve’s tears are finally dry, he lets Tony turn him to his side. They face each other, barely an inch between them.
“Why can’t I say that?” Steve fists himself, head tilting. That used to be cute, too.
There's you, raising your shield and the American flag. Red, white, and blue. And dead, dead, dead.
The pillows didn’t prop right on the headboard and it got too cold at night. The feeling of the coolness on his back reminded him that he was alone. The empty space on the left side of the bed stared at him in accusation.
when she had asked years ago,
They stepped into the station. It was dark. The lights flickered. There were only a few people milling about in the corners. A few sat on the benches, looking bored or reading a newspaper.
Morgan pauses for a beat, chews her lip, then looks at Tony. Something passes through her face, the sort of question she has when she’s unsure, but it’s soon replaced with determination. She walks closer to Steve. “That’s why I’m asking you, Pops.”
Tonight, Steve is off early and there’s a dark shadow on his face.
The rooftop garden needed work. Steve should clean it up, tend the garden back into something comforting, rather than letting it fester as a grave.
Steve feels warmth at Tony attempting to call out his name.
He urged Steve’s head up so their eyes could meet. Steve was truly gorgeous in all senses, even when he was awful and hurting. Steve was a paradox of emotions: grief and anger, all at once, and Tony could commiserate with the downward tilt of his lips, the shadows on his face. Even in the darkness, Steve's eyes were bright, filled with tears.
“I’m fine.”
Steve pushed up, bringing Morgan and Harley to his lap. Harley might be too big for it, ten and a half years old and he’s got all of Tony’s snark. He didn't resist Steve; he slumped over Steve’s chest and hid his face.
When will Steve stop spending evenings in their bedroom waiting for Tony to come up from the workshop?
Steve used to watch Tony all the time. He was like a moving target, shifting constantly running around the brownstone, skipping to the living room with Morgan in his arms.
The world spun around him.
The living quarters are interspersed with these moments of life that Steve has missed.
He kept his eyes shut and drifted.
It’s like he was deep asleep in the Arctic. Body reserving his life. Steve’s awake and confined to his own penitentiary. Memory was a shark that circled him in the deep waters. It wasn't the shark’s murderous intent that drove up his anxiety, but it was the very fact that the shark existed at all.
He wished the faceplate would lift up so Tony could kiss him.
Tony turned to peck him on the lips. “Sap. Jezz, whatever happened to the other pair of that?”
“Please, hurts,” Tony begs, sobbing because he’s so close. “Leave.”
Peter and Harley preferred late evenings in the lab with Tony, exchanging notes and ideas. Steve’s taken to sitting on the workshop sofa with Morgan on his lap—the two of them sketching the lab’s robots and their boys.
Steve felt a little warm under the sun.
The leaves will change soon, and it’s gonna be another year gone by. Another year alive. Sometimes he can’t believe it — can’t fathom the fact that he’s survived a war that happened in another milenium, lived decades fighting aliens and villains, and now, somehow, has patched himself up and is growing older and older by the day.
“OK. I, uh —“
Steve swallowed, nervous that every day—every time Tony looked at him with soft eyes felt like a goodbye. “Tony. We’ll have more breakfasts like this. We will, okay?” He inched back, feeling the heat on Tony’s forehead. His temperature seemed normal, if not a little cold, but with being immuno-compromised, Steve worried. “I’m almost done, sweetheart. You alright to wait here for a few minutes?”
Without thought, he stepped out of the shower, scrubbed his wet hair, and wrapped the towel around his waist.
Steve’s stomach rolls as he waits for a response. He might never learn to keep his mouth shut, but he’s finally realizing that he’s stupid and reckless, can’t keep his emotions constrained in a lock box.
So I hold on. What else can I do. What else.
“Not like Nat,” Steve says, not unkind. It’s just an observation.
He stares at Tony’s hole, adding a third finger, and suppresses a moan when Tony starts rocking back. How is Steve supposed to go on pretending this never happened, that he doesn’t know the sounds Tony makes when he’s begging for cock?
“What a dream,” Tony pats his back pocket, fetching a pack of cigarettes. “You have a light?”
“Go.” Natasha pushes him out of the room, fingering the pistol on her hip, eyes never leaving Jessica Drew and Rhodes. “Carol, come here for a moment.”
I used to hear your laughter.
“Dad said that normal is boring. I don’t want to be boring.” Morgan deadpanned and skipped out of the room, following her siblings. Then, she rushed back, pigtails bouncing. Morgan pulled at his hand, laced their fingers together, and squeezed three times.
There's nothing here but savagery. A man who wears Steve' face, who has the same arch of his back, the exact copy of the mole on Steve's forearms.
He flexed his legs apart, shifting to carry Tony's weight between the hall and himself to secure leverage on Tony’s ass. He kissed the smile from Tony’s lips and reached for the bottle of lube in the caddy. Tony nipped at Steve’s bicep and leaned against the wall.
Tony held his breath, waiting.
Steve licks along his crack, warm breath ghosting over the creases of Tony's thighs. "God, Steve," Tony says as Steve makes circles with his tongue.
“You shouldn’t be like this,” Steve says, firmly. He twists to turn to face Tony. “You shouldn’t allow strangers to take you places. You need to be more careful.”
The water, too much water. It’s going down his system, and he’s too full. Ballooning, flying higher and higher as Steve caresses his insides.
“Is it really appalling to do the right thing? I just saw someone try to hurt you and stepped in.”
“It’s just for show, right dad? Not to use?” She turned to Steve, eyebrows raised.
“No,” Tony counters. “Not really.”
The circle of people thin, until it’s just Mayor Danvers and Peter Parker mourning decomposing bodies.
Tony called it BARF because he didn’t want to talk about feelings. Tony said talking about emotions and trauma made him want to throw up. Yet here he was, the man who opened his mansion to the team, funded them, and built their tech. Maybe Tony preferred self-deprecation when talking about his time in Afghanistan, but Steve saw through the facade.
Tony takes his glasses off and rubs his temples. “It’s fine. Everything is fine. Just drive.”
“Sure.” Tony snorts, reaching for his burger again. He takes another two bites before saying, “Ex-fugitive though.” He softens the statement with a raised eyebrow, as if challenging Steve to disagree.
Running, always running, towards the fire, away from it. It doesn’t matter at this point. One front after the other, and next thing he knows, he’s spring towards something else, too stubborn to look back.
“We all are. You know, for a man who spent two years talking about home and moping around, you sure do spend a lot of time away.”
Always,
his mechanical view quiet against the wind. He held Steve up with ease, and they flew and flew with Tony directing him towards different mountain ranges and rattling out information relayed by FRIDAY.
No, Steve didn’t really know her to believe it, or to know why Tony’s reacting this way. He’s only spent a few weeks with Carole Danvers. It was just weeks after the Snap, when they were all hanging by the thread waiting to see if the loss could be reversed.
He thumbed his wedding band.
He runs and runs, throws the shield out by the edges of the forest, then jumps after it. He runs until his quads burn enough that he could ignore the ache on his chest.
He hates Los Angeles.
It isn’t until the following week that FRIDAY confirms that the lake is safe for skating, so they go into town, purchasing skates for all three of them. They spend the entire afternoon circling a frozen body of water, wondering where the birds have migrated to and wishing for their return. But for now, Steve enjoys the cold because he has Tony to keep him warm.
Steve’s portrait, large and immaculate, still hangs in the conference room and when Tony has meetings with the other Avengers—well, the ones that are still there and backing him—he can’t help but stare at the painting, wondering whether Steve hates him. “Let’s not fight tonight. Not here.”
Tony Stark is like that. Steve Rogers, too.
“But I can’t hold onto that.” His voice wavered. The sun was too bright and it irritated him. It was supposed to be somber. His husband just died. But instead, the gardens were beautiful and irrationally, it made him angry that pretty things could still exist when the most stunning person in the world just passed away. “I can’t pull that into my arms. Kiss it. Sleep next to it.”
Tony’s favorite work table was untouched, still a mess of mugs, notes, and tools. On the middle of it was the helmet of the last Iron Man suit he worked on. Steve bit his lip and dragged his gaze back to the kids.
What if they were still a team. What if he told Tony the truth, what if he listened and compromised, what if they worked together to revise a stupid document that doesn’t even matter anymore, what if he was honest. What if he was a better man? What if he wasn’t a coward. What if he was perfect? What if he was good?
They were in the same team. They weren’t fighting.
“Well, if I wanted a lecture, I’d go to my parents’ grave.”
The table roars in laughter, and then Thor asks something about humans and their mating rituals, then Carol replies with stories about marriages in other planets, to which Johnny chimes to, and the conversation goes on, and on, and on.
He had become so apathetic about his job that he no longer volunteered for missions, choosing instead to leave the facility the minute his shift was over. In his free time, he worked odd PR jobs—whatever Maria Hill penciled into his calendar, like PSA’s or photo-ops at the children’s hospital. He volunteered at an orphanage in Flatbush, shopped at the bodega in his corner, and shoved all his change into the plastic container, tipping the teenage kid who greeted him with a salute.
“It’s everything else. I was betrayed by you, my best friend. You were the first face I saw in this new world. Do you know what that meant to me?” Steve reached out and put his hands on the side of Tony's face, rubbing his thumb to the corner of Tony’s eyes. Steve’s words were hurried and fierce when he said, "I’m angry, and I haven’t forgiven you, and it hurt, Tony. To be in the cell and have you on the other side. You didn’t even show me your face.”
Tony is pinned to the floor with the rest of the debris, Steve’s arm right over his chest. The contrast of the golden undersheath with Steve’s red gloves reminds him of the Iron Man suit and how Steve used to strip the plates off him.
Pepper stood by the doorway, a hand cupping her mouth in shock.
They head back home as it nears three, and because Sam slows through the curves as if buying time, they get home an hour later. Just an hour or so more, the sun will soon set. She always wants to leave early when autumn comes.
making me better.”
“I don’t know how the hell you convinced me to live in a place where it snows.” Tony shakes his head as he wiggles out of his boots. He removes his too-large sherpa coat and hangs it on the coat rack. Slowly, he pads to the kitchen and deposits a woven basket full of fresh eggs on the counter.  “Now, make me breakfast.”
If Tony’s hands were free, he'd wipe his eyes.
Again and again, they rejected the request. “This is the Plaza! Champagne, please!” He shouted at the receiver a final time, unplugged the stupid phone from the port, and threw it across the room.
That’s how Tony loved: loud, violent, and desperate. He loved Steve, and Tony was filled with shame because even now, he couldn’t reason with himself to stop.
It’s easy to trap himself in memories of the dead.
Steve can’t help the smile that bursts from his face, and it’s too much all at once, revealing and shameless. But he doesn’t care. He doesn’t attempt to school his features. He’s all too aware of his heart picking up speed.
He’s just a hole to be used.
Rumiko shifts to her haunches, takes Steve’s hand, and sets it to Tony’s lower back. “Do I have to do everything?” she laughs, light and airy, and it’s a surreal moment when her strap-on bounces on Steve’s thigh.
The memorial service was on Friday.
Too soon, he moves away. The come on his dick is dry now.
“What are you offering?” Steve started at the red tint on Tony’s cheeks. Tony was blushing because of him.
Tony scoots closer to Steve. Their feet touch in the sand. He takes the other bottle, drinks it, then drops it to the space beside them. “I’ll recycle it later,” he says, when Steve tries to grab liquor bottles and take it to the bin. Tony pulls him down. “So, Captain Rogers is normal and flawed like the rest of us mortals.”
Steve,
“Oh, I, uh, don’t have that phone anymore.” He had to dispose of it when they were on the run.
Steve licked his lips, and Tony followed the movement of his tongue. “Not everything, but mostly, you. Us. The EMP, the Mansion, what came after…”
And Steve? He’ll be fine. He’ll adapt to it, school his expression to something that’s less revealing every time they enter the room together. There’ll still be afternoon bagels after debriefs and late evenings spent in the Mansion’s conference room strategizing. Tony’s not leaving Steve. He’s not.
“He always fancied carnations. I think it would be good to do something you like, pops. Even if they remind you of him.” Peter scratched the back of his neck with eyes downcast. “I talk to him sometimes, even though he can’t answer. Sometimes I’m just in the lab, needing to work through an equation or project, and yeah, talking it out, with him, even though he’s not there, it helps. I figure things out.” Peter smiled, heart warm and conflicted. “Even in death he’s still the hero.”
“Understatement of the century.” Natasha said, wryly, pushing Tony’s head back to disinfect the cut on his face.
The room on the top floor was painted in a mix of stars (Steve’s suggestion) and equations (Tony’s insistence) and adorned in too many toys for a newborn baby.
I think of our galaxy and the hubris of empire and  the promise of salvation. I used to be a warrior once.
“Love you.” Tony whispered.
There’s no manual for how to live, yet here they all are — trying.
“But I reckon, you’ve had nothing but time these last couple years.”
“Yes,” he mumbled, thinking about Peggy’s funeral, losing soldiers in France, Bucky falling off the train. “But this is Tony. I thought we’d have forever.”
“Yeah, of course. Understood,” he finally says.
“I was just told I have a brain tumor, Steve. I’m not okay. Fuck, my head is killing me, literally.” Tony grimaced and scooted further down the hospital-issued pillows. “Fucking fuck. They better get this shit out of my head.”
“A flower crown?” Tony raised an eyebrow.
And now he’s here, knees bend and between Tony’s legs, looking up at him in admiration, almost like a shy whisper. Steve cups his jaw, scratches the lines of his goatee with a thick thumb. “I’m here, Tony.”
Rumiko plants a hand on Tony’s back, easing his face down to bed, and then she’s lifting his hips higher, picking up the pace. “Fine, honey. If that’s what you want… but remember you’re not allowed to come yet.”
“You’re the perfect boyfriend, man.” Tony petted his hair. “I mean, Captain America is the perfect specimen, peak human perfection and all, but you, you, you, Steve. You’re my perfect person. My person.”
Steve pats his back pocket only to find it empty.
“Tony, I wanted to check on you.”
“Home,” Steve says, tone dull.
“No.”
“Sometimes I’m afraid,” Tony confesses with a sigh. “The world is still broken, you know that. I know that. Sometimes I think you and I can be doing more.” Tony gestures at their little home, both of them are lying on the sofa with the television humming in the background. The kitchen lights are set in a low dim, but other than that, they’re cocooned around each other in the darkness.
He sighs. “Alright.” He looks down at his boots and jeans. They’re not dressed for a trail, but they’ve trekked through worse in missions. “Up for a hike?”
Tony grinned. “I’ll make sure there’s a row of cherry trees by your balcony window.”
Some days Steve was lost in the harvesting, focusing on tenting the garden, watering the plants. He didn’t think of the cat—
Steve takes his face in both of his hands, forcing their heads together. They breathe each other's scent. Tony smells like Steve’s come. He doesn’t know how it happens, but they’re kissing again, tongues delving in deep, sucking and prodding into each other’s mouth. When Steve pulls away, he pauses, then determined, says, “Open.”
“Rick Jones was my friend, too. I did what I had to do to make a better world. If friendship is the cost of that, I’m willing to pay that price.”
“I hurt for the kids, I hurt for Tony.” Her eyes flashed. Pain. She was in pain too. It’s a familiar ache. Grief was filled with longing. Yearning for the dead. “Don’t ever raise your voice at me, Steve. You can grieve forever and it’ll hurt every single day. No doubt about that. But shit, get it together for the kids.”
He focuses on that, stays quiet, still against his pillows. He traces the indent of Tony’s body on his own bed, then closes his eyes again.
Tony struggles against his chains, as he’s finger-fucked in deep, hard strokes.
Tony arches and their chests rub, and then he's wrapping his free hand around Steve, and Steve can imagine this going a million ways. He can remove the blindfold, reveal himself, peer into those eyes. Trouble, that's all that would be. But Steve's always running headfirst into danger. He won't survive this, he knows. He kisses Tony, putting everything he has into thrusting in and out.
