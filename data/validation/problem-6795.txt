Steve didn’t protest, simply flipped them around so his back was against the bed, and Tony was up on his lap. His hands immediately braced the brunet’s hips, but Tony pulled them away, intertwined their fingers and pinned Steve’s hands to the bed. He didn’t waste any time adjusting his position, and lifting himself a little, sinking down hard and fast, in a way that had both of them moaning.
“Fuck…” Tony sighed, still shuddering a little. His voice was a little rough, but he was clearly pleased. He lifted a hand, wiped the tears from his eyes.
For now, he had to gather his strength, sort out his mind, so he could start planning. Eventually, with that goal in mind, he drifted off, cradled in Steve’s arms, and thankfully didn’t wake up again until morning.
Steve smiled, brushed a gentle hand through his hair, and stepped back. He moved to the bedroom door and locked it. The click of the locking mechanism made Tony’s heart jump, filled him with anticipation and relief, and his eyes followed Steve across the room, his confident gait, his broad shoulders, the veins running down his arms, visible thanks to his rolled up sleeves. He looked strong, beautiful, safe, and Tony couldn’t believe he had won him over, that Steve was his and his alone.
A sob bubbled up in his throat, and he cut it off with a choked gasp, but Steve heard and felt it anyway.
“No one deserves better than you, Tony,” the blond repeated, voice barely above a whisper. “You deserve the world, deserve everything. It was my job to give it to you. I was supposed to give it to you, and I didn’t.”
Steve lowered Tony to a more comfortable height as he dropped the last one in the basket, but didn’t set him down. Instead he kissed him again, deeper than was probably appropriate for being outside, but Tony didn’t seem to mind. Steve’s hands tightened where they grasped his cardigan, as if he didn’t want to let go. He kissed with quiet desperation, with purpose, whether he admitted it or not. Tony slung an arm around his shoulder, cradled the back of his head with the other. He kissed him back sweetly, expertly, let him take his time, drink his fill.
He also could feel a fluffy pillow beneath him though, soft sheets around him. It was warm, and quiet, and felt kind of nice. The haze of sleep was slow to withdraw, but even so, he was aware this wasn’t his bed. It felt different. It
now. He’d lost it, lost this one small, simple item of immeasurable importance, and Tony would hate him for it, if he ever got to speak to him again. God, he hoped he’d be able to speak to him again. Tony would curse his name when he did, probably hate him all over again for all the pain and suffering he’d caused.
The soldier caught his foot, dragged Tony down the bed a little. Tony couldn’t help but let out a laugh, and Steve rolled his eyes, though had to hide a smile of his own. “What’s if I tie your little hands up?” Steve asked. “What’s if I lock that pretty cock of yours up so you can’t touch yourself?”
“Still! If they find one of you, it’ll only be a matter of time before they find all of you, or before they make
“You’re doing your best. I expected too much, man. Just because you’re Captain America doesn’t mean you’re not just a regular guy like the rest of us. I…got too caught up in it all to realize that, and I’m sorry.”
He didn’t have to say anymore, because Steve understood, and braced his hands on Tony’s hips, careful of the angry bruise on one side, and slowly drew out, until just the tip was in, and pushed forward again. He did it a few times, savoring the slow drag, the way Tony couldn’t help but clench around him a little, and how hot and silky smooth he was, wet with lube.
“I-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right. You were right, about all of it. I’m so fucking sorry,” he replied, his words rushed, insistent.
He leaned forward a little further, nuzzled Tony’s neck, let out a pleased little whine as he kept cumming, coasting on the pleasure of having Tony below him, being inside him, being together. He’d never get enough of it, was so lucky to have it.
He hit the call button with bated breath. The line rang, and rang, and rang, and rang. Steve didn’t pick up. The answering machine called for a message to be recorded and Tony took a deep breath, shut his eyes. He didn’t leave a message after the first call, figured giving Steve a little more time was more prudent, but he was going to leave one this time.
“When I’m with you though, every day is different, and new, and I just… I don’t know. I’m just really glad I met you,” Steve admitted, voice soft.
He tried not to worry. After all, sometimes fights ran a little longer than anticipated, and things got a little more complicated. Sometimes other things got in the way after a fight, and something like a phone call had to be left for later.
“So polite,” Tony teased. He leaned down, let his breath ghost over the thick head. “But only when you want to be.”
His head tipped back against Steve’s shoulder, and he didn’t bother trying to stop the high whines from spilling out each time he was pushed up a little with Steve’s thrusts.
“You’re right,” Steve said finally, dropping more apples in their basket. “I guess it can be kind of hard.”
People wanted a follow up to it and I was planning on writing one anyway so here we are! Hope you enjoy!
. There wasn’t anything more humbling than that, for any of them. They would certainly have to work on their apologies during the flight home. Steve had been working on his for months, though he doubted it would convey the depths of his regret, of his gratitude enough. He would simply have to hope for the best.
The windows were dimmed, not entirely darkened because the rainy weather made it darker than usual already, and Tony’s face was turned away from them, tucked instead against the blessed shadow of Steve’s chest.
God it hurt. It hurt so much, but Rhodey’s hands around his were firm and strong, and everyone was cheering him on all at once, and the pain peaked, truly peaked, and the midwife shouted something, and then the head was out.
Howard shoved him away then, and Tony stumbled, his hip hitting the corner of his father’s massive desk. He let out a little groan, but didn’t get any sympathy for it.
The blood was rushing in his ears a little still, and it was kind of hard to think, everything smooth and easy and fuzzy. She always got him off just right, knew exactly how to relieve him of his tension, of the stress and burdens their daily lives came with. She knew just how to wipe away everything but the sensation of being together, of feeling good.
?” Tony asked, screwing his eyes shut. He loved it, loved how huge Steve was, but it was unbelievable sometimes, how he could always fit him
As the meal went on, he managed to relax again, at least a little. Steve complimented the food four separate times, meant it every time, and ate three platefuls to prove it. He apologized for his tardiness too, leaned forward to hold Tony’s hand between dinner and dessert. He told the brunet the details of the mission, and they both had some choice words for Fury at the moment, took the rare opportunity to talk shit about him without anyone else hearing(they didn’t really mind Fury, or had reason to make fun often, but on occasion, his requests could be inconvenient, like today.)
Sam managed a huff of laughter. It was barely a laugh, but something about it soothed Natasha, and would have soothed Steve under a different circumstance.
safe, really. Either way, we’re on our guard. If Ross tries to do something, if he dares to come at you, you know I’ll be there in a heartbeat.”
Something about being out in public really brought out the worst(best?) in him, as Steve had learned time and time again. Maybe it was because they had to be more careful outside of the safety of their estate, lest the paparazzi catch sight of them, or some local homophobes, or maybe it was because there were more people around for the brunet to intellectually terrorize. Maybe Tony just wanted Steve more when they were outside, because he couldn’t have him just then, and he counted the moments until he could. Maybe it was a combination of all of that which led his mind to dark and devious places, which gave him the confidence to give voice to his ideas, knowing that Steve wouldn’t be able to resist them. The blond wasn’t sure.
Rhodey had never felt more proud. If he shed a tear or two, he couldn’t be blamed. “He’s amazing,” he said, brushing back Tony’s sweaty bangs. His gaze drifted between his best friend, his brother, and his brand new godson. The Alpha laughed softly. “He looks like you, Tones.”
The blond seemed to pause, maybe waiting for Tony to tell him to stop, but he did no such thing. The brunet squirmed under him a little, sunk further into the bed submissively.
He also got the sense that boredom must run rampant here, but he kept that thought to himself, tried to focus on the pretty scene this late September day had provided.
Tony could remember the words he’d whispered, the way it felt being in Steve’s arms, properly, for the first time. He remembered the look in Steve’s eyes, the way it felt to be kissed by him, to be held, to be
“Mhm,” Tony said. He’d picked another four, the last one requiring him stretch up pretty far. Looking around the tree it was a little hard to see any more at his level.
He didn’t want to do that now though, wanted to lean forward instead, in to Steve’s space, so he could watch those blue eyes grow darker, hazier, and see the red spread on his cheeks, take in the volume of the blond’s moans as Tony rode him with surprising vigor, given how Steve had already exhausted him earlier. But hey, it wasn’t hard to catch his second wind with such a view.
He didn’t know who else to call, really. Rhodey was deployed overseas and wouldn’t be back for months, and if he called Jarvis then his parents would find out, and he’d be collected from the street corner he was on, and it would turn into a huge mess, and a lecture was the
His legs, the legs of a super soldier, of a man with the strength of ten, with the power of a hero, shook beneath him, and then Steve was on his knees near the side of the bed, too ashamed to even look Tony in the eyes anymore. His body was slumped, bent towards the floor, his palms bracing the cold tile beneath him for stability.
Tony barely had time to raise an inquisitive brow before his feet weren’t touching the ground anymore, Steve’s hands dipping under him before he could protest and sweeping him into his arms. Tony’s heart jumped a little at having his center of gravity shifted like that, and he almost dropped his sunglasses in his haste to get his arms around Steve’s shoulders, his legs around the soldier’s waist.
Rhodey didn’t have to wonder if this whole thing was stressing him out or not. He swallowed hard. “You can either keep waiting or look for yourself, Tones. It’s up to you.”
Tony had been so distraught, so consumed by misery, that he hadn’t heard him approach, had somehow missed the familiar, clean-cut and heavy scent, which filled his lungs like fresh air, which made something bloom in his chest which had lain dormant for far too long.
Tony eyed the contents of Steve’s hands, couldn’t focus on his beautiful face anymore. It was like staring into the sun. “Did you—“
He was in a really good mood today, which was a relief, because he’d been extremely cranky the day before, and they ended up staying inside with him and watching reruns of his favorite show over and over again to keep him placated.
Steve was glad Tony felt comfortable like that here. He was relaxed, and a little quieter because of it, happier than he’d been in a while. He’d let out more than one growl in the days leading up to their vacation, either into the phone, at a stray toy laying on the floor, and even at Steve at some point, so it was a relief to see him in a good mood, to be surrounded by a smooth and sweet vanilla-whiskey scent, without a sharp edge to it.
Nurse Celene had warned him time and time again over the last few weeks that stress was the enemy, that just because some of the risk in his sickness had abated didn’t mean he was out of the clear, and what fell directly into his lap now? An incredible amount of stress, which he highly doubted would be mitigated within the next twenty-four hours, which did what exactly? That’s right, make him
Tony laughed a little, rolled his eyes. “I’ll let you in on a little secret: No one likes washing dishes. I mean, I’ve never really had to, but I’m sure I’d hate it.” He took another sip of coffee, let out a quiet sigh.
He wanted to talk to him so bad. He wanted to hear Tony’s voice, to know that he was okay. He hoped and prayed that this sudden misfortune wouldn’t wreak too much havoc, on Tony or the baby, but judging by the sinking feeling in his chest, and the feverish haze that settled in him, stronger than he anticipated, his prayers were ignored once more.
He couldn’t do it though, wouldn’t let himself, but if Tony was going to purposefully try to work him up now, Steve could do the same.
“I’ll take what I can get,” Steve replied, certainty in his tone. “I’ll take every second, every moment I can. I love you, Tony, and I know it’s not ideal this way, but if it’s enough for you, it’s enough for me.”
Still, he couldn’t fall to it so early, needed a lot more coaxing before he was willing to agree with the compliments.
He could sense the change in Tony’s voice now though, and had secretly hoped he would reach out this week, now that it was just the two of them and Vision in the Compound. Tony had never been good at dealing with his emotions, especially not candidly or publically, so Rhodey hoped the Compound being empty would encourage him to confront his emotions, even if it was just to yell at Rhodey again. Tony’s tone now didn’t sound like he wanted to yell, and it was a relief. The airman tried to play it off, didn’t want to let on just how happy it made him.
Tony had another quip lined up, but then Steve was feeding him his cock, and his mouth got kind of busy. It slid in, inch by inch, taking him, filling him,
“Are you kidding me?” Tony replied, sitting up straighter. He didn’t really have the energy for posturing lately, and already he was feeling a little worse for wear, since hearing the news. He wasn’t going to let Ross talk to him like that though (even if he was right to be accusatory.)
That was all the answer Tony needed, all the confirmation. He knew he hadn’t been imagining it all, hadn’t imagined Steve’s interest. There was an undeniable connection between them, something strong and intense and unspoken, but most importantly
Tony grinned when Steve pulled him into his bedroom, and shut the door behind him, a little louder than necessary. Steve was too mad to care.
Well, that much was true, but it didn’t make Tony feel any better. He took a deep breath, tried to calm down, to think rationally. He couldn’t stop the sinking feeling from settling in his chest though, or the wave of nausea that was threatening to surge up. He really didn’t need this. He was due to go into labor in two weeks, and had just started to properly speak to Steve again. He relied on that contact now, for health reasons, and also, he…he was starting to
Steve snorted, but pressed a kiss to his cheek. “Well, I’m nothing if not a model citizen,” he muttered, easily won over.
Before he had time to adjust on the bed, he could feel the soldier’s big hands on his backside, and Steve tugged his hips up. “On your knees,” he growled, and for once, Tony obliged.
. It had happened before, and he nearly blacked out from how hard it turned him on. If asked, he would admit to having a size kink. There was no way he could pretend otherwise.
Tony was blinking like a deer in headlights, and suddenly he felt warm, and shocked, and kind of embarrassed. “Wait—I—do you…do you like
It didn’t feel like it. Tony felt like he was at a standstill, as if he’d be stuck like this forever. He felt like crying. He felt like dying.
good, but the small, serene smile on Steve’s lips, the way his hands wrapped around Tony, stroked his side lovingly was even better. Tony scooped up a little piece of pie from his plate, fed it to his partner before giving himself another mouthful.
floor. It took a little work to get Tony up the stairs, and Steve considered just carrying him instead, but he didn’t want to impose, didn’t want to wound the brunet’s pride any further than tonight’s events already had. He kept a hand on his back, and one of Tony’s hands was gripping his designer jacket like a lifeline, the other pinched around Steve’s jacket on his shoulders, his fingers placed a little awkwardly, his palm open, because he didn’t want to further irritate his scratches. On another day, it would have been endearing.
“You don’t have to stay anymore if you don’t want to,” Tony offered, though he secretly hoped Steve would stay. “I’ll be okay now I think…”
. The only time Steve got like that though was during a rut, and unfortunately for Tony, it would be another few weeks before one of those rolled around.
After a few seconds, Tony sighed, rubbed his temple. “Are you gonna tell us why you’re here, or are you gonna keep leaving your fingerprints all over my furniture?”
It was only 6am, and he was exhausted, but he doubted Ross and Co. would wait until noon to make their appearance. He wanted to be prepared, get everything sorted out ahead of time. “I can’t let you go until we get things under control though. We’ve got to make sure they believe our story, believe that we had nothing to do with it. Hell, they might send you themselves. If that happens…”
kind of mood, quick to quip, and brazenly confident. Steve loved him like this. He loved that infectious energy that always made him want to step up to the plate, made him want to
hurt, that Steve could have potentially never seen or heard from him again or something like that, was more than terrifying. He prayed none of his dark visions, his fears, would ever come to fruition.
Tony jolted at that. He was sure no one would come in, at least not without knocking and waiting, but the thought that they could be caught, that someone could walk in and find them, tangled together on the bed and covered in cum, the evidence of what they’d just been up to crystal clear, was equal parts terrifying and enticing.
God, they were just so perfect. Peter had grown, naturally, over the last few months, but he still looked so small in Steve’s arms, and horribly adorable, with big rosy cheeks and dark curls not unlike Tony’s. Steve was as handsome as ever of course, even with sleep circles under his eyes, and made a particularly handsome father, Tony thought. Despite all the pain and anger of the past, that sometimes came surging back up, Tony was proud to be Steve’s mate, and was proud to have a child with him. He was proud of what they had together.
Tony moaned a little, a shudder running through his body, and he relaxed that much more, opened up like he was born to it, and suddenly Steve sank in to the hilt, wonderfully, achingly big, and hot, filling him completely, like he craved.
“His name is Peter,” Tony said softly, glimpsing Steve’s awestruck expression from the corner of his eye. He was familiar with that feeling, had felt it himself a mere day ago, and continued to feel it in small doses as the hours passed. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to how it felt, seeing Peter, being able to hold him.
The soldier leaned forward, pulled Tony into his arms completely and turned them around so it was the brunet laying against the bed once more, his dark curls disheveled and standing in stark contrast to the white blankets. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead, another to his lips.
This meeting was going well, all things considered, but Tony didn’t feel any better about any of it. He only felt more nervous, more sure that the jaws were going to close around them, that none of this would end well. He’d been given an ultimatum now too, which he would have to deal with. He wasn’t looking forward to that.
Sometimes he wondered if they shouldn’t just start over, just try to live normal lives. He wondered if the team should split off from him, leave it all behind, and if he should turn himself in. If he didn’t know where the others were, they couldn’t be punished alongside him, right? Then Steve could serve his sentence and maybe, just maybe, see Tony with his own eyes again, be allowed to be in his life again, and in their baby’s life. He wanted that, so bad. He wanted to be the father he should be.
Steve’s heart jolted, like he’d been struck by lightning. “W-what?” he replied, voice strained, somewhat shrill. The room felt a thousand degrees hotter.
. Only he knew Tony like this, and only he could get him to speak out, to admit things about himself he didn’t want to believe were true.
Tony sighed, a real, heavy sigh, and looked around his lab. He walked to his desk, tried to decide between which products to work on next, or if he wanted to make something brand new. He did have a pile of paperwork in his office that needed taking care of, but that would just ruin his day that much more. It had been all but three minutes, and he already missed Steve.
. Sure, he’d been lost in the wilderness before, or cut off from the team, but this was something entirely different. They were in a foreign country in the middle of the woods with the UN on their tail, and Tony was halfway across the world probably already worried sick, a few weeks from delivering their baby, and now Steve couldn’t reach him.
For now, he leaned forward, closed the last few inches of distance between them, and kissed Tony. It was just a slight brush of their lips, really, something unspeakably tender, but even so he could feel the brunet relax against him just a little bit. Tony kissed him back, a proper kiss this time, and Steve’s eyes slipped closed. He was still tired, and eager to sleep again, but kissing Tony was always a welcome substitute.
Tony smiled, honest and bright and beautiful, a smile like Steve had been trying to coax out of him the whole time, and the brunet nodded, curled into his side contentedly. “I’d like that.”
Well, the rejections had been worse so far. Steve wasn’t deterred. [I’m sorry, couldn’t resist. What do you want to do?]
The point was, it was better to keep it all to themselves, lest his father managed to take a closer look at them and realize what had been going on under his nose all this time.
Steve’s gaze turned soft for a moment, and warmth spread in his chest. He pushed it down, remembered why he was here. He unzipped his pants, freed his erection from its confines. “Open that big mouth of yours,” he said. “The only thing it’s good for is warming my cock.”
Steve had warned him a few times already, but every time, those gorgeous, dark eyes would simply fill with defiance, with an invitation, and Steve had to shut his mouth and swallow hard to keep from taking it. He knew Tony was doing this on purpose. He knew the brat was going to get what he wanted, as he always did.
“It was totally unnecessary. You had me from the moment I saw you, really. God, you were such a brat that day.”
where Steve was concerned, because Tony wanted him, needed him, and the brat in him wasn’t going to take no for an answer.
He’d spend the last few months recovering, being tested, attending therapy, and soaking in the peace that was offered to him, the respite from the haunting of the past and a life devoted to violence. He wasn’t whole, and there were times when everything felt wrong, or he relapsed, and it all came crashing down on him, but he was okay. He was okay, thanks to Steve.
. Some nights he got off easy, or tired himself out so much that his body didn’t have another choice but to shut down. Sometimes he had good runs where he didn’t have a nightmare for weeks, and fell asleep in under an hour, but Steve doubted Tony would have that luck now.
That wasn’t entirely out of the ordinary, but right now it was detrimental to his performance and his sanity. He couldn’t stop thinking about it all. So many of his past mistakes already haunted him, and this week he’d given himself more ghosts. God, couldn’t he do anything
Steve stood too though, crossed the short distance between them before Tony could lift his plate from the table. He took one of Tony’s hands into his own.
, and hot, almost too hot really, instantly leaving Tony feeling overheated, overwhelmed in the best way. He could feel him so damn deep it was ridiculous, but he loved it. The brunet loved the feeling of being stretched wide, of being
, for putting him in this situation in the first place. He cursed anything and everything, had to place the blame somewhere when the baby crowned and he felt like he was being split apart. He let out an agonized shout that drifted into a strained whimper; he couldn’t manage much more.
He tried not to let on how worried he actually was. The thing was, the erratic path the jet took before its final spot wasn’t
Tony scoured social media, checked old correspondence servers, tried to collect footage from whatever uncorrupted files remained from the Quinjet. He wasn’t rewarded with anything recent, or useful. He spent the night in Rhodey’s bed, reminiscing about their college days to feel better. It didn’t help much.
Steve’s heart clenched. He knew that look, he’d seen it before, too many times to count over the few years he’d known Tony. Howard had obviously done or said something again, and poor Tony had paid the price.
“I don’t mind, really,” Steve said. “I’d rather have you here with me, like this, than somewhere out there alone.”
For the first time in a long while, Steve considered succumbing, letting the world swallow him up like the icy water of the Atlantic had so many years ago.
A small, dark part of him wanted his fantasy to be real though, to actually do all of that. He wanted to belong to Steve in any way possible, which really spoke to just how high in regard Tony held him, because he knew who he was, and he knew his self worth, and he would only offer himself entirely to someone truly amazing: someone like Steve.
“I do, as a matter of fact,” Steve replied. “Men, and women.” It felt kind of good to admit it actually, to say it out loud. He couldn’t remember the last time he had. He thought it was with the Howlies, one night at a bar in France.
“I’m so fucking stupid,” he gasped, and sat on the wet pavement, gripping his stinging hand. A few droplets of blood started pooling on his scrapes. “Fucking idiot!”
This is so, so self-indulgent. If you've known me longer than 2 weeks, chances are you know I LOVE werewolves. Tasty.
“You’re not sick of me, are you?” He tried to frame it as a joke, didn’t want the blond to know just how deeply it had affected him, but wasn’t sure how effective it was. Steve had a habit of seeing right through him.
Tony looked up at him, his eyes kind of far away in spirit, but Steve could see the focus growing in their dark tone, the affection. He took a second to respond, took in the sight of the man he loved, the man who’d been his for a whole
fool Tony. Maybe Steve didn’t want to hurt him, even though he didn’t want him anymore. Maybe he felt trapped in their relationship, didn’t want to end it because it would put their friendship in jeopardy, would interfere with their work as Avengers if Tony reacted badly, if he had his heart broken. Maybe he, and the others, just tolerated Tony because he had to, because there weren’t any other options. Maybe it was propriety, desperation, that made them keep treating him nicely, that made them pat him on the back after a good mission or give him a smile whenever he made something new to make their jobs easier. Maybe they were thinking horrible things about him,
Tony hadn’t really expected anything else. Steve was always understanding, always kind, even in the event of an argument, so he didn’t foresee any of this being a problem. He brought Steve’s hand to his lips, kissed his palm in thanks.
They both, more or less, collapsed in the chair, with Tony plastered against Steve’s chest, trying to catch his breath. His eyes were a little watery, and it was kind of hard to hear—that’s how damn good it had been. Steve was in similar shape, and it took him a long time to move or say anything, and that filled Tony with a prideful sort of glee, because Steve was a damn super soldier, and if Tony could get this kind of response out of him, he was doing something right.
“Why don’t we play a little game?” Tony had suggested, sliding his hand up Steve’s broad back, settling on his shoulder. The plaza was kind of crowded, given it was already noon, so the motion drew no attention, and Tony was well aware of the anonymity they were granted at the moment.
punishing him, if this whole thing had turned malicious, and suddenly he regretted acting out tonight. The seconds crawled by, and it felt like an eternity. Tony thought he was going to pass out.
It was hard, seeing Tony like this, knowing how long he’d been in pain. It’d been at least fourteen hours—he kind of lost track at some point, and he wasn’t sure how much longer this would go on. Tony had called him Jim just now, not Rhodey, and not Honeybear, a testament to just how bad he was feeling.
The brunet took a second to take in the view, and another second to snap a picture on his phone, before moving into action. Tony approached the couch, bent down a little and brushed a hand through Steve’s hair, and pressed a kiss to his forehead. It didn’t take long for Steve to start stirring, always attuned to the brunet’s touch, his presence.
I may eventually add the morning after in another chapter, but for right now, I'm leaving it like this.
He’d fallen for Steve at first sight, really. What were the odds that the guy he’d been following for almost half an hour in the rain was
, even if it cost him his life. He thought it’d be a fair trade, after all the misery he’d caused. If it would end with Steve safe and happy, it’d be well worth it.
“I think this’ll be a good one!” he called to Steve, who had scooped their toddler up in his arms and was dangling his feet in the water now.
Calling the police would have been more trouble than it was worth, and that in itself made him feel shitty. He hated how pathetic he sounded too. It only frustrated him more, on top of how sick he was feeling, and a few fresh tears gathered in his eyes.
, but that was simply because the informational gaps had been filled in for him, and he didn’t have to wonder as much about what Tony was doing. He still felt achy, and off-kilter, and struggled to re-sharpen his senses. His heart still felt far too heavy, filled with regret and a deep sense of yearning, of desperation. He was always too hot or too cold, and although some of the paranoia, the aggression, had disappeared, he was far from feeling like himself again.
Tony smiled at Steve’s declaration and found his lips again in the dark, gave him a slow kiss. “I love you too,” he replied. “You and your pretty voice.”
Tony growled once more, tried to push himself down further on the bed, to get the tip of his mate’s dick to slide inside him. He was wet enough, loose enough for it, after so much teasing. Steve wasn’t making it easy though, refused to slide home, even tipped his hips back a little to make it harder for Tony to get what he wanted.
Tony tried not to move. He didn’t want to disturb Steve, wanted the soldier to get his rest, because at least one of them needed to be alert for making plans tomorrow, but Tony couldn’t help but wish he was feeling better.
that you can’t, that it isn’t even an option. I’m so sorry for everything I’ve ever done to you, and if you let me, I’m going to spend the
He had been halfway to the elevator when he realized that he didn’t want to miss another opportunity, that he wanted to be honest about what he felt, and what he thought Tony felt. He couldn’t imagine going through the next few months without at least talking to Tony, even if it was just on the phone. He wasn’t going to let another chance slip through his fingers, and so he was here now, being horribly candid about the whole thing.
The brunet swallowed him down further than he had been now, let the soldier’s cock hit the back of his throat. His lips were shiny with spit, and it was practically dripping down Steve’s shaft, warm and messy, but Tony wanted it that way, shut his eyes and lost himself in it a little too.
He’d end up leaving a bruise, he knew, but Tony didn’t mind, could hardly feel it at the moment. He was too busy groaning, open-mouthed into the blankets below them, his hips pitched up, his back curved in a delicious slope that let Steve watch the shift of his shoulder blades, how they were glistening with sweat, and damn did it feel good.
Some small part of him felt vindicated at the fact the brunet was having a hard time sleeping; he’d gotten them into this mess. His pride, his stupidity was the reason they were in a goddamn tiny guest bed instead of their massive, familiar king. Some tiny part of him thought it was appropriate that Tony’s body was punishing him. But he knew that wasn’t fair. He knew Tony hadn’t meant for any of this to happen, that he would never want to do anything to hurt the team, or the entire world. He’d just made a mistake, that they all, unfortunately, were forced to contend with now.
“Ahh—ahh—ahh!” the brunet keened on each thrust, couldn’t help but whine as Steve’s cock pushed in, filled him to the brim.
when Steve got like that. Tony couldn’t let on how horny it was making him though, so he huffed in irritation instead, and slowly got to his feet. He quirked a brow, waited for Steve to give him another direction.
Steve swallowed hard. There was a lump forming in his throat, and his eyes stung. He knew exactly what Sam was saying. If Tony was stressed, worried about him, and they weren’t in contact, his sickness, both of theirs, could take a turn for the worst. This really couldn’t have been worse timing.
sick. Steve had gotten up a little while ago to resupply him on medicine, brought along a water bottle and a bucket just in case. It wouldn’t be the first time Tony had vomited from the pain. He couldn’t keep his eyes open at this point. Every time he did, even for a few seconds, swirling white stars danced across his vision, and he felt dizzy.
Steve sat up slowly, rubbed his eyes and brushed back his hair. He regarded them fondly before standing up, leaning over to capture Tony’s lips in a kiss. It was just a short kiss, a greeting really, but was enough to leave them both smiling.
“Ouch. Blame Fury, not me,” the blond replied, though he couldn’t deny it. He came away a lot cleaner than most missions, and his suit wasn’t even scratched up, but hard work would always be hard work. He cursed himself for
One day he’d tell Peter about it all, when he was older. He’d tell his son about his greatest shame, the hard choices he’d made and the consequences he’d paid for them. He’d make sure Peter would never make the same mistakes as him, that he knew the importance of family.
The blond was asleep. He was spread out along the length of the couch, a hand dropped over the side. His hair was a little disheveled, and from the look on his face, he was pretty deep in sleep. That was endearing in itself, but that wasn’t all Tony was greeted with. Steve’s other hand was resting firmly on Peter’s back, the baby sprawled out on his chest, looking equally exhausted, his little pacifier sticking out of his mouth and his breathing deep and calm.
“Depends. The information was absorbed pretty quick, but my actual behavior? Atrocious, of course,” Tony explained. He set the flowers on the credenza momentarily, crossed the room and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, leaned up to give him a kiss.
Tony let out a little sigh at the touch. His eyes searched Steve’s face, for signs of irritation or disappointment or anger like he’d seen at the start of this mess, but they were absent for the moment. He looked tired, but his eyes were watching Tony intently, as if he could will away Tony’s anxiety with just a look. Tony was thankful for it, for the attempt.
Four days later, the Braxton Hicks contractions started. His belly dropped a little too, but the doctor said that was common up to a week before birth, so he tried not to worry.
Steve let out an amused scoff at Tony’s words. He leaned forward, pressed their lips together in a slow, gentle kiss. Tony met it with the same easy enthusiasm, brought his hands up to cradle the blond’s head, ran his fingers through his hair. Steve couldn’t help but hum a little at his touch, at how good it felt.
He caught sight of the elaborately set table, the covered entrées and the baskets of fresh bread and salad, the bottle of champagne, and the
Steve groaned at the tone of his voice, his own cock throbbing in his pants. He’d unbuttoned his jeans a while ago, to relieve some of the pressure, but it was getting hard not to touch himself now too. His boxers were practically soaked and sticky with pre-cum already, and as much as he wanted to draw it out, to keep Tony like this, soft and desperate, he didn’t think he could take much more of it himself.
But Steve had opened a can of worms with that question, because the handful of kids on the other side of the building wanted to get in on the action too, so it was only fair that everyone got a picture. If the crowd was any bigger, it might have been annoying, but it was just a small group of people, and besides, they were never in this part of the state, so it was only natural it’d cause some excitement. Tony made them all promise not to put their photos on social media until the next day, when they were already home again. He didn’t want this quiet little field trip turning into a big event with people showing up just for a photo op. That being said, he didn’t mind interacting with fans out of the blue. They always seemed so happy, seeing him and Steve. He was glad to bring people a little happiness.
Tony still worried that it was too good to be true, honestly. He was still scared of fucking it up, or something
Ross bristled. “It’s nothing personal, Stark. It’s a matter of international security! For every bit I’ve been on your team’s case about this, someone’s been on mine double the amount!” he replied, and it was perhaps the first time he’d ever spoken candidly to any of them.
to tell? Did Tony want anyone at all to know about their Bond Sickness, or the baby? He’d already said he didn’t want the media getting a hold of the news, and Steve doubted T’challa would spread information like that, or Shuri for that matter, but what about anyone else? Was it even Steve’s news to tell? Instinct told him it wasn’t.
“Are you happy with yourself?” Steve asked, shifting his hips a little. He couldn’t help but thrust up a little into the tight channel spread open around his dick, which had been for over an hour now.
Steve’s eyes drifted around the beautiful, quiet office room he was standing in. Bucky and the rest of his team were waiting outside the door, he knew, but they felt miles, light-years away.
Tony’s hand snaked around to Steve’s front, and he slipped a hand between them, palmed the obvious bulge in his pants. Steve let out a little moan at that, bucked up into the touch, and it really didn’t take much more than that.
Fuck, he wanted to see him. He needed to talk to him, to know that they’d truly taken the leap, that they were going to be together now. He needed to know that Steve hadn’t just humored him last night with that kiss. Tony had practically begged for it, if he remembered correctly. He hoped Steve wasn’t just taking pity on him. That’d be worse than never getting to kiss the man at all. No, he needed to lay it all out clearly. He needed to know.
The drive was surprisingly short, or maybe Tony’s sense of time had just been lost. He felt a little nauseous again on the ride over, and there was definitely a headache brewing in his skull, and he could feel himself getting kind of tired, watching houses fly past the car window, tracing the droplets of rain sliding down the glass with his index finger. For once, he didn’t have anything to say. Neither did Steve.
had he screwed up so bad? How had he taken everything he’d been given for granted, had been so willing to throw it all away in a few moments of cloudy judgment? It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair to him, and it wasn’t fair to his team, and most of all, it wasn’t fair to
He looked over at the object in question, his eyes dark, but warm, a little melancholy. Tony had obviously polished it a little; it was in good condition, but obviously original, looked different than the reproductions they sold in stores nowadays. There were a stack of records neatly placed next to the player too.
The brunet sighed, pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling a little shame creep through his veins. “I know. I know you were just…looking out for me,” he said. “But Rhodey… you didn’t give me a choice, in the end. You pushed me into it. Maybe…maybe I just—I just needed a little more time. I…” he paused.
He also liked being a handful: a handful which fit perfectly in the breadth of Steve’s huge and warm grasp.
It was big, about the same size he was, and already wet with lube, ready to be put into use, and damn did Steve want it. His hole clenched reflexively at the mere thought, at the knowledge that his gorgeous wife was about to give him what he wanted, was about to fuck him like he deserved.
They all exchanged glances. Steve thought his heart had stopped. What could it be now? Was it some horrible news? Was Tony okay? Was Steve too late? His mouth went dry, and he could feel his pulse all the way down to his fingertips.
“Don’t apologize,” Steve replied, pulling him closer. “Don’t ever apologize. God, Tony, I’m just glad you called me.”
, fuck—close, I-I’m close,” the soldier gasped, and couldn’t help but shift his hips, trying to get more of either pleasure, the one above him or within him.
Steve didn’t panic usually. He wasn’t the panicking type, really. He’d always had the ability to stay some sense of coherent under pressure, to find a way through the tough situations. He’d learned to make quick decisions, to stay in control, and he was good at it, most of the time. He had to learn to handle the unexpected, to think on his feet, because that’s what a leader did. Normally, he did a decent job at it. Now wasn’t one of those times where he did a decent job.
Steve was in the middle of pulling their supplies off of the Quinjet when the message came in. He was expecting another brief, cursory, message, little more than a status report, like he’d been getting the last few weeks. Every time he pushed for a more serious conversation topic besides maybe the weather or the general state of things, Tony withdrew, dropped off the conversation or ended it entirely. Steve’s pleas for more went unheard, his wishes ungranted, for a long time. He’d learned to deal with it by now, but that didn’t make it the least bit pleasurable. He wanted to make more progress, for all of their sakes. The quicker they could get back to some type of normal, the better things would be for everyone, he was sure. It seemed Tony didn’t feel the way, with how things had been going.
He tried to stifle a sob, but it slipped out anyway, wracked his body with it. He opened his tear-filled eyes, and Peter was looking up at him, all sleepy innocence, and Tony couldn’t take it anymore. “I’m so sorry, baby. You deserve so much better than me. So much better.”
“You gonna knot me any time today?” Tony asked. He wanted it to come out mean, but really it sounded more like a plea. “Or do you plan on milking me dry?”
. I’m glad you called me. The thought of you out there all alone, scared and hurt…I never want to see you that way. Anything I can do to keep you safe and happy is worth a little discomfort.”
Tony shot him a mean glance over his shoulder, and for a second his confidence faltered, but no. He didn’t want to go back on it now. “I can take it.”
“If the thing is on, I can. I can modify mine, transmit a signal from my end and see where it pings, target the companion’s location. If it’s off or damaged though, no go.”
was. Were the rogues in custody? Was Ross playing the long game, waiting for them to notice or slip up? Was Ross on the move even now, preparing to strike? Or did Steve and his team slip away from their hunters, and where were they now? When would they be heard from again? Rhodey didn’t have the answers, and he couldn’t give them to his friend, though he wished he could.
sent heat pooling in his groin, only heightened with the first drag of pressure against his prostate. He couldn’t help but let out a yelp at that, at the chills that rippled up his body, made even his nipples hard.
Pepper hesitated a little, sat back in the guest chair. “What do you remember?” she asked, crossing her legs.
daddy was, but he pushed those thoughts away, focused on his beautiful boyfriend, moaning and eager in his grasp, seconds away from falling apart.
, but sometimes he just needed that little extra push, and the blond, being so loving and kind and understanding, never denied him it.
“Be quiet and dig in,” he ordered, and scooped himself a forkful of pasta before he could become too self critical.
Steve’s fingers tightened a fraction, not enough to truly cut off his breathing or to hurt, but enough that the pressure was undeniable, tight, and oh so good. He kept up the pressure, fucked in and out with slick, wet slides. The room was filled with lewd noises, and Tony’s body was trembling under Steve’s, his hole clenching desperately every time Steve pushed forward, every time the twin dicks in his hole filled him to his limit, each time they passed over his sweet spot.
They didn’t want to push their luck though, with the door unlocked. Tony knew he had to get up, that he couldn’t stay like this, even if he was loathe to move. His limbs felt like jelly, and he was plenty sleepy, but sleeping like this, all sticky and disgusting, wasn’t ideal.
Tony hummed a little, closed his eyes. “Only if you love me back,” he replied, words drawn out. He let out a yawn, and his hand slid to his lap, fingers curling around the edge of his blanket. His exhaustion was clearly catching up with him.
Steve pulled back a little so he could get a look at Tony’s face. His expression made the blond’s heart clench. He’d only really seen Tony like this a handful of times (because Tony was too good at hiding his pain), and it always left him feeling unsettled, twisted and angry. It made him feel helpless, like a failure, because he couldn’t take away Tony’s pain, couldn’t prevent it. He felt that way for a lot of people really, but the urge to protect, to comfort, was strongest where Tony was concerned.
Tony tried to pull it back, to stop his crying. “I-I’m…Corner of Bedford and—and uh—Avenue J,” he sniffled, brushed his sweater sleeve over his wet face, leaning around the phone console to glimpse the street sign a few feet away from the booth.
Sleeping by himself again made him miserable, and made rest hard to get. It just left Tony feeling down. Just because his Bond Sickness technically wasn’t worsening anymore, didn’t mean he felt any better, or things were any easier, especially when he was (albeit purposefully) holding himself back from the close contact he’d come to rely on the last few months. He’d been kind of in pain lately too, always woke up with one of his legs asleep, with pins and needles running down his limbs, no doubt from his baby finding odd ways to lay, and it was enough to make him grouchier than he already was.
at one point, to truly laugh. For those few seconds, the pain in his neck seemed infinitesimal. But apparently, it wasn’t enough.
“I will do my best to ensure Ross doesn’t discover the truth,” Vision replied. “Once I analyze the crash site, I can attempt to identify their path, figure out where they might be going. Perhaps I can intercept them.”
Tony shuddered a little in his grasp, his hand snaking up Steve’s back, underneath his shirt, caressing his warm skin. Steve didn’t do the hickey thing often; he always got shy about it, about marking Tony up where their friends could see it, but they were alone now, and Tony had tomorrow off too, so there wouldn’t be anyone around to tease him about it.
Steve followed his direction without hesitation, spread his legs so Tony could fit between them. Tony crawled forward a little, and got to work, kissing and teasing his way down from the blond’s chest, tweaking his nipples, laving his tongue over the planes of muscle, slow and steady. He knew what he was doing, knew which spots to touch, how to touch. It hardly took any time for Steve to lose himself to it.
Tony kind of hated it. He always got embarrassed about it at first, complained about the mess, until he really got into it, and didn’t care anymore, didn’t care about anything but the feeling of Steve’s body against him,
Three days later, Tony spent half an hour over the toilet, vomiting until his throat was raw, feeling lightheaded. His neck was burning and body flushed with a feverish ache.
Even in the low light, Tony could see the blue of his eyes, his bangs sweeping over his brows, his handsome visage. He looked strong and safe and familiar, and the brunet thanked his lucky stars.
This just wasn’t the time for it though. Maybe it could be arranged later, way after all of this, because he was sure he’d be sore by the end of the day. He was already getting sore, actually, and that encouraged him to play dirty, because he wanted Steve to lose, to give in to it all and fuck him, so he could take a shower and pass out on the blond’s big bed until dinnertime.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said with a chuckle. “I’ll make it up to you when we get home with these. I’ll even buy you something from the gift shop.”
He was in a supremely good mood today. Well, who wouldn’t be? The weather was nice, there wasn’t any work to be done, and he could spend plenty of time with his incredible mate and child. Steve never thought he’d be so lucky. He still thought he didn’t deserve it sometimes, after what he’d done, but Tony had forgiven him for it, had let him back in. He never took that second chance for granted.
“I told you before—if I wanted Steve here, he’d be here already. Why the fuck would I go through the extra work to sabotage my own programming? I want them found more than anyone. If they’re in custody, that means you’ll get off my fucking back,” he snapped, let a little irritation seep out.
“He wasn’t the only one disappointed by our decision,” T’challa added. “But we did not share our secrets with the world to fill it with more oppression. Oversight is necessary, yes, but all things must have their limitations.”
Jesus. Steve’s face was warm, and he was sure his skin had gone red by now. Tony was good at reaching for the upper hand, knew just what to say and do, but Steve, every inch as stubborn as the brunet, wouldn’t give it to him. “I told you to shut your mouth, or I’d find something to fill it,” he said, pulling Tony away from him.
It didn’t take all that long to push Tony to the edge. Steve played his body like a fiddle, speeding up, slowing down, letting his spit make the way smooth and wet, pulling off of his cock to lick at his balls, let his teeth graze over the sensitive flesh of his thigh before swallowing him down again.
Tony jumped, his heart rate shooting up. “Oh,” he whispered, heat blooming across his skin, even through the fabric of his slacks. It didn’t hurt, per se, but it stung a little, in the best way.
The blond took it gladly, rubbed the back of Tony’s hand with his thumb, muttered encouragements as he sank in deeper. “That’s it, you’ve got it,” he gasped out, pushing in that much further, inch by inch. “Taking it so good, opening right up for me like a good boy.”
To his full-bodied relief, Tony’s eyes shut, and he allowed the touch, didn’t pull back or growl or push Steve away. He hadn’t growled at Steve at all thus far, and maybe there was a little guardedness in his actions, in his scent, for the most part he simply felt relieved. That relief went both ways. It had only been a few minutes, but Steve was sure he already felt better, and that he would continue to feel better with time.
Tony took in his surroundings, made sure no one was looking, and leaned up, let his tongue peek out of his plush lips just far enough to swipe over the strong pulse of Steve’s neck, in the way he knew Steve loved.
Steve anticipated it all, of course, pulled back with seconds to spare so Tony’s load spurted all over his tongue. He swallowed the warm, thick liquid, sucked his husband’s softening cock clean, and took a few seconds to regain his breath.
[You really love throwing that word around. You said ‘together’ a few years ago too, when Ultron came around, but guess who fucking left??? You did]
, belonged to him, not his shitty father, the man Steve once considered a friend and now considered an unfortunate acquaintance. He thought about ignoring Tony’s wishes, giving Howard a taste of his mean right hook, telling him
Tony was getting a little antsy, honestly, and his cock had risen and fallen in interest about a dozen times over the last few hours, and he did anything and everything to think of something else, something unpleasant, the fingers tightening around his book, because he really didn’t want to touch himself. Strictly speaking, Steve had never said he couldn’t, but Tony knew getting off would be the end of the game, and he was a sore loser.
“He’s here, he’s right here, see?” Pepper replied, and gestured to the other side of the bed. Directly next to it was a bassinet, hospital standard, and sleeping peacefully, swaddled in a blanket with a little hat on his head, was Tony’s baby.
Steve asked again on the line, prompted by Tony’s crying, and his words. His voice was insistent, a little panicked, though he tried not to let it show in his tone.
, despite their differences, despite their circumstances, and now it was being put into words, at least the suggestion of it, and that was a lot to handle.
There was a beat of silence, and Tony looked down at the ground, scuffed his shoe against the floor. “So you’re leaving in a few hours, right?” he asked.
“You really think Tony would do something like that?” Rhodey interjected, looking annoyed. He let out the smallest inclination of a growl, protective of his friend.
When Steve put a gentle hand on his shoulder, rubbed it comfortingly and said, “You can stay in the car, wait right here for me,” Tony couldn’t disagree.
Could it be helped? Could he be blamed? They’d lubed up well, because neither knew just how long they could keep this going, because they were both so damn stubborn, and they didn’t want Tony getting hurt or anything. As a result, the brunet was silky and hot around him, and although the pleasure ebbed and flowed enough for Steve to pay attention to his work, it wasn’t without difficulty, especially now, when Tony had apparently had enough of waiting for Steve to lose, and was going to try and
to forgive Steve yet. He didn’t want to let him in again, let down his defenses. What could come of it anyway? Unless Ross and his associates had a sudden change of heart, Steve couldn’t come home. They couldn’t be a proper family. That just made Tony even angrier.
Sometimes he thought Tony loved him too. Tony was always so warm with him, touched him, gave him his best smiles. He listened to Steve when he talked, truly
He really did? And Tony…Tony had been flirting with him all this time, but never really anticipated anything could come from it, didn’t think he was that lucky, but now Steve had stormed into his lab and
Tony let out an amused exhale, brushed a hand through his hair. “Sorry, I was on a budget. My apology will have to do.”
This conversation was giving him a headache. Why had he agreed to talking to Steve again? He was so goddamn
“Not yet,” Steve snarled in reply, and a few seconds later Tony could feel the flat of his tongue lap against his hole, light, a little teasing, but then more insistently, adamantly.
Their lips met a little more insistently than last night, with more confidence, less hesitance, now that the words had been spoken and they’d given substance to this, to the feelings they’d shared for so long. Tony’s hand slid up Steve’s chest, around his shoulder, and Steve’s fingers tightened in the fabric of the brunet’s sweater, and he pulled them backwards so that his back was against the arm rest, and Tony fit himself between Steve’s legs.
“That’s why I’m here,” Ross replied, a hand placed on his belt. “We scoured the crash site, and searched in a twenty mile radius, but there was no sight of them. No bodies in the wreckage either. They just disappeared.”
Tony’s head fell back against the bed, and he let out a sharp little gasp. Normally he didn’t get worked up this easily, could take a fair bit of teasing and dish out a lot more, but today he couldn’t. Today Steve was disarming him, in every way, and Tony was going to let him. “God, please touch me, I’m so fucking horny.”
He pushed away the vision of dark walls, of blood-soaked snow, and his own chest, littered with bruises. He pushed away the words which had replayed so many times in his sleep, in his nightmares, and would surely haunt him even now, even moving forward. He had to push them all away, learn to silence them once and for all, for Peter, and for himself. He had to. There was no way around it anymore. It was time. Tony licked his lips, summoned his courage and…
Steve pulled off of his cock with a soft pop, licked his spit-slick lips. “What was that about a stick?” he teased.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Tony said, and he leaned into the touch, relished the tenderness of it. He really loved when people played with his hair. Steve seemed to sense that. Steve seemed to sense a hell of a lot about him, about what he loved, what he needed, and that in itself was amazing.
suffered enough. Sam didn’t want to suffer anymore. He didn’t want Steve to suffer anymore either, especially now knowing that the man had a kid on the way, a kid which he most likely wouldn’t get to meet. That was punishment enough for everything, Sam decided.
“Don’t you dare,” the brunet said, and his eyes snapped down to follow the movement of Steve’s hands, settled on his massive cock, standing at attention between his legs.
Steve had a lot of patience though, knew how to handle Tony most of the time. A firm hand on his waist or a warning spoken lowly into his ear was usually enough to get Tony to behave, at least for a little while. Tony was perfectly sweet when they were alone, always listened and even conceded often, let Steve have his way. He could compromise when he wanted to. He rarely lied, and was always eager to spend time with Steve, regardless of how that time was spent. He was kind, and curious, and helpful, and was always coming up with grand ideas, with little projects or inventions that he wanted to chase, and Steve loved it. He loved that calm, happy, and wonderful side of Tony, which he didn’t think everyone got to see. Tony was intelligent and most often meant well, but sometimes (quite often actually) he was restless, and irritable, and that turned him more than a tad whiny and vindictive, and hard to placate.
Tony understood. It was exciting! Of course they’d been together a long time, and really nothing had changed (except their last names. They
The breath rushed out of his lungs on a quiet sob, and Steve moved forward, climbed onto the bed like Tony wanted him to. It wasn’t very big, but there was room enough, and although it was a little awkward with his suit on, he managed, settled at Tony’s side. The feeling of being at Tony’s side, the sensation of their hands touching, was indescribable, intensely overwhelming now. It was more overwhelming than the first time they had ever touched, back on the Helicarrier. Neither would forget it for the rest of their days.
“Calm down, man. We’ll figure something out,” Sam replied, wiping the sweat and grime from his brow, though he was feeling just as frazzled. He needed to convince himself just as much as Steve that things would be okay. “We’ll…We’ll wait, and go back to the jet, see if anything can be salvaged.”
Steve’s fingers threaded in Tony’s hair, tugged at his scalp in the way he knew he loved, and the brunet let out a little moan against his skin. Tony’s hands tugged at the waistband of Steve’s swim shorts then, started to pull them down.
That was fair enough. Tony nodded, and shifted a little, and Steve took over from there. He took a breath, snapped his hips up,
He wasn’t sleeping as much as he should, at least not during the night. It was easier taking naps during the day, in the living room.  Despite his anger, he was starting to really miss Steve again, like he had at the beginning of all of this. That was supremely annoying, because there was nothing to be done about it. Even if he could bring himself to forgive Steve eventually, it wouldn’t change anything. How did he know that something like this wouldn’t happen again? How did he know that he wasn’t being foolish, if he opened his heart again? Tony
He wrinkled his nose though, catching the smell of rubble, gunpowder and sweat, now that his brain was a little less preoccupied. “Besides, you kind of smell.”
Tony laughed a little. “That makes two of us. Thank you for the present. I really, really love them. I got you something too, but it’s a lot less beautiful,” he said, drawing back a little. Tony closed up the jewelry box, set it down on the table.
Steve scoffed a little. “I hope that’s a compliment,” he replied, offered the brunet a smile. He gestured for the jacket in Tony’s arms.
Tony grimaced, tried to pull his arm free from his father’s grasp. “You’re hurting me,” he hissed, his eyes welling up with tears at the sudden pain.
Tony nodded, didn’t even think about it really. He was laid bare, couldn’t bring himself to lie, or hide his thoughts. “Yeah, wanna be good, good for you Steve, daddy, oh
“Blame the serum,” Steve replied, running a gentle hand up and down Tony’s thigh. “It—It made me bigger.”
“You’re just about burning a hole in me there with your eyes,” Tony said after a while, lowering his book. “You gonna put out the fire you start too?” he joked.
Steve hummed a little. He did know that. “Well then how about you go find the candles along the way? What do you say to a nice, romantic bath while we wait for the power to come back on?”
“Well then,” Tony sighed. He brushed a hand over his face, gathered his thoughts. This was kind of amazing, actually. He had an opportunity here, a
It had only been a few minutes of the scientist’s attention, but Steve was already hard, erection tenting the fabric. He lifted his hips so his husband could pull the garment down. It took a little finagling, but after a few moments they were back in the same position, with Steve’s shorts on the floor, and Tony finally wrapped a hand around his length.
“’M a good boy? Really?” Tony moaned, with just a breath of laughter, like he couldn’t quite believe it, like he thought Steve was joking. His fingers scratched into Steve’s shoulders, but then his hands fell back on the bed, like it took too much effort to keep them up anymore. He was close, he could feel himself rising up that peak, Steve’s voice, his words leading him there, making him feel good all around.
for more. His hand slid back down Tony’s back, hesitated just a moment before settling on the curve of his ass.
“You shouldn’t have done it, Tony! You shouldn’t have made a deal with them for me, for us. It’s not fair to you. It goes against everything you’ve worked for! You shouldn’t have done it. We’re not worth it. I’m not worth it,” Steve protested, because he thought it was true. He didn’t deserve to come home, didn’t deserve to be at Tony’s side after everything.
. His suit was torn in a few spots. The bright star on his chest was gone; maybe he’d pulled it off himself, stripped it away like his identity.
Steve could hardly get his voice to work. Every bit of him felt swallowed up, distant, gone, like he wasn’t a person anymore. He didn’t deserve to be a person, didn’t deserve anything he’d ever had, anything Tony had ever given him. All that remained were Tony’s words now, his voice, squeezing his heart, and if it weren’t for their keen sting, the Alpha would float away entirely. Steve would never turn from them, from his mate, ever again.
Steve didn’t understand it, hated it really, that Howard brushed his son off so often, and that Maria was too focused on her own humanitarian efforts to pay consistent attention to him, but at the same time, it was okay. It just meant Tony could belong to Steve more completely.
The jeans didn’t get quite the loving treatment his shirt had, ended up in the unruly pile Tony’s clothes had already formed on the floor, and the same went for his underwear. His cock was almost painfully hard, and warm, standing tall and wet against his belly, and with the way Tony was spread out on the bed, his skin flushed and chest heaving, his hole already so loose and inviting, Steve didn’t think he’d last long. But he was a super soldier, and one of the blessings that came with it was his low refractory period. Depending on how Tony felt, he would be more than willing to fuck him again and again and
He felt a bit like an intruder, leaving the bedroom and entering the hall. He couldn’t hear anything really, and suspected Steve wasn’t even home at the moment, so he went to the bathroom, tried to make himself look a fraction more presentable, and relieved himself. The bags under his eyes were darker than usual, and he looked a little dazed, kind of miserable when he regarded his reflection in the mirror, but he kind of expected that, after the night he’d had.
Tony treated him differently than everyone else, like he was special. Tony drew him in like a magnet while he repelled others, kept them at distance. Steve melted beneath his smiles, his big brown eyes every time. They set a fire in his veins that wasn’t easily quenched, no matter how many times he tried to forget, to think of something else, but what could he do? Things were different here in the future, but not different enough. Steve would have to save his pining for the pillow.
The Alpha didn’t know how to reply to that. He hadn’t anticipated such a response, especially this late at night. “Sam…”
Tony licked his lips, tried to raise his arms. They felt like they were filled with lead, but he managed. “Give—give me—“
This was Tony at his most earnest, his most vulnerable, and Steve certainly felt it when the brunet whined high and tight, a hand coming up to grasp at Steve’s arm, and begged, “Choke me.”
Steve relinquished his hold on the brunet’s pretty neck then, and pulled out the dildo, let it fall to the side somewhere, stroked Tony’s thighs where they were spread around his waist.
opportunity, to try and build something with Steve, to give voice to his emotions, and apparently, without fear of rejection. Could he have received a better gift? He didn’t think so. He sure as hell wasn’t going to waste it.
,  gave Steve the courage to slowly open the door and step inside. Now Steve was on his hands and knees, trying to stop the world from spinning, trying to plead his case.
It was habit, in the summer months, when it was just the three of them together. Tony didn’t have to feel self-conscious about his scars, any of them, and about how he looked. He’d become more confident about them over the years, especially the biggest one, earned about a year ago, but they still bothered him sometimes when he was out, especially on the rare occasions someone stared or asked him about them.
He did it so tenderly that Tony’s heart skipped a beat. Fine. He could play dirty too. “If I’m a brat, then what does that say about you? What would everyone say if they knew that goody-two-shoes Captain America likes to fuck bratty little rich boys? What’s if they knew that he liked sticking his cock down his friend’s son’s throat?”
Steve leaned down a little further, crowded him and let out a moan of his own, spurred on by his reactions, by his voice. He loved it. He loved it when Tony lost himself, when he was just open and raw, living in the moment. Tony put up a front so often, hid himself, from the world, and on occasion, from Steve, but there was nothing to hide here.
“On my back, like this,” he said after a moment, and gripped her ass, spread his palms across the smooth fabric of her panties.
“I’ve got you, sweetheart,” Steve replied. He leaned forward a little, placed a slow kiss to Tony’s neck. His lips were warm, and his hands slid down the brunet’s sides, settled on his hips. Tony let out a little moan, adjusted Steve’s hand to sit above the sore spot on his hip. The blond gave him a questioning look.
The brunet couldn’t even get the words out, but Steve knew what he meant, what he was asking for, like he always did.  He lowered one of Tony’s legs in favor of wrapping a hand around his cock, and it not only changed the angle of his thrusts, but elicited another beautiful moan from Tony’s lips.
“I can’t, I can’t,” Tony insisted, tossed his head back against Steve’s shoulder. His hands flailed a moment, unsure of what to do, how to subdue the rush of pleasure, and he almost toppled forward, but Steve braced a hand across his stomach, held him steady.
? What would Tony do? How would he feel, if Steve were gone for good? He was still so angry, a lot of the time, but he couldn’t deny he still loved the man, still loved his
The blond had to watch what he said, lest their progress fly out the window yet again. He could admit the picture Tony was painting delighted him though, made him yearn for home once more. It took him a second to think of a response.
Tony huffed a little, got more comfortable. His heart rate was starting to reach a normal level again, and he was thankful for it. “It’s too quiet here. I miss people screaming down on the streets.”
At this point it was probably more than a little uncomfortable for both of them, and Tony’s thighs burned a little from being slung wide around Steve’s legs, and his skin was burning hot. It was a hot day to begin with, and the breeze coming in from the balcony didn’t seem to do anything for them anymore.
He was here. He was really here, standing in the doorway, the light from Tony’s lamp illuminating half of his figure, and the low lights from the hallway bathing his back, casting a shadow on the tiled floor.
“Wait and see,” Steve repeated, as if the concept was foreign to him. It was anything but, at this point. Maybe there really was nothing else to do at the moment though, but to wait for things to fall into place. He desperately hoped they would.
Tony presents Steve with an interesting challenge that has plenty of reward. He's never been good at playing games fair, though.
It was at that point that Tony really committed to the idea of making Steve a new suit. He started a draft file the instant they got back to the Tower. It took longer than he expected to design it. He wanted it to be perfect. He wanted it to fit Steve in all the right ways, but he also wanted it to be useful, for it to offer him protection. He also found out SHIELD was taking Steve and Nat down to Washington for the next couple of months, and that Steve was going to be an official SHIELD agent, which was really fucking disappointing honestly, because Tony wouldn’t be able to see him anymore, but at least he could leave him with this parting gift. At least Steve would be out there on every mission wearing something Tony made just for him, something sleek and sexy and
They pretended to let the information soak in, exchanged glances. “Did you catch them? Where are they?” Tony asked, a little hesitation in his tone, which he cursed himself for. He had to get it under control. He couldn’t afford to let Ross know what he knew.
to get off, needed to relieve that ache in his core, the desperate heat in his body. There was something about taking Steve’s dick that drove him wild, and if he waited any longer to get off, he thought he’d die.
When Steve drew back, Tony let out a shaky little breath. “I fucking love you, Steve,” he said, resting his head on the blond’s shoulder. He pulled their joined hands up to his face, smiled a little as the soldier’s fingertips brushed against his cheek. Steve followed the motion, cradled the brunet’s face in his hand. “Love you so much. I always have.”
Tony’s heart melted at that, and some of the tension left his shoulders. “I’m glad you stopped me,” the brunet replied. “I don’t know if I would’ve had the courage to say something if you didn’t.”
He was working on the background of his still life now, set up across the room. It was a bowl of fruit, and a handful of flowers spread around the draped cloth. It wasn’t all that interesting, but he couldn’t handle anything more complex at the moment.
When he got to the kitchen and living room, Steve was nowhere to be found, which was more than a little disappointing, but Tony suspected he had a routine to follow, and just because Tony was knocked out in his bed didn’t mean he couldn’t follow it. Tony thought about snooping around to find some pain killers for his headache, but settled for downing half of the water bottle he’d left on the coffee table the night before, cringing just a little because it was warm now. It’d be rude to make himself at home though, to go looking through Steve’s things, even if he was left alone here. He of all people understood the subject of crossing boundaries.
Tony could hear his heatbeat in his ears, fought the urge to pull back, to slide off of Steve’s cock. He wanted to be good, wanted to hold out until Steve told him he could stop, until Steve
Steve hummed at that, smiled a little. “I love it too,” he replied, and pulled back a bit, set his hands on Tony’s waist. He looked his mate up and down, took in his disheveled hair, those beautiful dark eyes, the dusting of color on his cheeks. He looked mouthwatering.
with him so much, could hardly ever keep his hands off of him. He took any opportunity to touch Tony, in any fashion, and the bedroom was no exception. They didn’t always have time for something like today, but damn did he love when they did.
Rhodey of course didn’t laugh at him, or think his concerns were stupid. He took a moment to absorb them, and chastised himself at not picking up on any of this sooner. Then again, Tony had always been good at wearing a mask.
, he wanted, pretty badly. Thankfully Tony took the leap, one night after calling Steve to save him from a house party that had gone too far. Tony had cried into his chest, shaken, ashamed, and the bastard and his friends who’d tried to hurt him, to take
Tony had kissed plenty of people. He’d had his fun, and plenty of it, had never been particularly shy in that arena. He’d had his first kiss at 14, done way more than he probably should when he was 16, and plenty since, but kissing Steve? That had quickly outranked any fond memory he’d collected, any sensation he’d experienced, and he knew immediately that he’d always want more.
The brunet kind of drowned in it, and under better circumstances Steve would have thought it was cute.
because it’d been dropped, and crushed or burned alongside the wreckage of their only means of reliable transportation.
Five days later, there was still no sign of Steve and the others, and Tony spent the day alternating between his bed and the luxurious tub in his bathroom, trying to relieve the aching in his back and pelvis.
Tony let out a long, content sigh, and reached down for the hands still bracing his thighs. He tugged on them, and the soldier followed, and laid at Tony’s side, took in his flushed face, the dreamy, relaxed look in his eyes that he always got after sex.
, so turned on by this whole challenge, he would try to take a nap right here and now, with his partner filling him up.
Mere seconds later, his baby was being pressed into his arms, and the rest of the world, all of his problems and worries and regrets finally drifted away. He wasn’t clean yet, still covered in some fluids, and his tiny face was pinched in displeasure, and he was crying, but his voice was strong and clear.
“You’d love that, wouldn’t you?” Steve asked, bracing his hands on Tony’s thighs. They were so warm, hot, really. He let his hands slide up slowly, grasp Tony’s waist. “You’re hungry for it. You always want me to mark you up inside and out, want the whole world to know that I’m the one you spread your legs for.”
“It’s my damn right to hurt you if I want,” Howard replied, irritated that Tony had even brought it up. He wouldn’t
you. I understand that things have gotten out of hand lately, and that it’s not entirely your fault.”
Tony would do everything in his power to save them all, from whatever was out there. He would do what he had to in order to save
Tony felt so good in his arms, like he belonged there, and he was warm, soft, and it felt familiar, like they’d touched this way thousands of times instead of for the very first time. It was beautiful, grounding, humbling, and he wondered why the hell he’d waited so long to let himself have it, why the hell
It was a relief, really. He much rather preferred Tony like this, still looking a little sleepy, his curls all disheveled, but safe, and without tears marring his cheeks. Steve could stare at him forever, had stared his fair share last night if he was honest with himself, sitting on the couch with Tony in his arms, waiting until he was completely asleep to move him to the bed. He’d never get enough of the view though, didn’t think it was possible too. Tony was stunning, in every sense of the word.
“And so are you,” Steve replied, gently brushing his fingers against Tony’s elbow. “And so is the table. You did all of this?” he asked, looking around the room.
Steve smiled down at him, shook his head a little, though it made his heart soar to hear it. “Tell me that in the morning,” he replied softly.
be broken, because they were determined never to repeat the mistakes of the past) but there was still a sense of excitement, of unadulterated joy that resulted in a spring in their steps and more than one case of heart eyes throughout their trip.
Tony raised a brow, looked up at the tree in question. He didn’t see anything extraordinary about it, but if Steve liked it, that was good enough for him. It was kind of tall though; he wasn’t sure how many he’d be able to pick. The scientist glanced around. Didn’t these types of places usually have ladders standing around? People brought their kids apple picking, and kids were a lot shorter than Tony. He couldn’t see one though.
“Yours,” Tony agreed either way, because he was. The mark on his neck was testament to that, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. “All y-yours—
“I’m serious,” Steve replied, undeterred, and his expression supported his words. “What’s the address?”
at the praise, and at the fact that Steve seemed to hold him in so high regard. It felt damn nice to hear Steve compliment him, candidly, without propriety or other things getting in the way. He loved it, loved that they could finally talk this way, that the last barrier had been broken between them.
Steve turned his head, pressed a kiss into Tony’s palm. “And what do you plan on doing with me?” he prodded, a suggestive grin slowly growing on his face.
“Def-definitely good,” Tony said, nodding. A little chill ran up his spine at Steve’s touch. “I-I just…I can’t turn it off. My brain. This whole thing makes me feel like a screw is jammed between my gears. The pressure is mounting and eventually it’s going to snap.”
So much had changed since then, and the boy grew every day, learned more, and discovered more. Tony cherished every moment with him, every new milestone, but sometimes thought it was all moving so
to improve, wanted to be able to trust Steve, to get closer to him, like they were before all of this.
Tony had always thought a good bed was high on the list of priorities in life, especially after 2008, even if he didn’t always make it to his bed, crashed on the futon in his workshop or lab instead. His bed at home was massive, with a good mattress, and soft sheets, and you could sink into it so easily, let it soothe your aching body. It had plenty of room for him and Steve, and was one of his best purchases. His sleep was hardly ever truly restful, but having a good foundation definitely helped him clock out for at least a few hours every night.
“You’ll knock his teeth out. You’ve said that a million times,” Tony laughed. “I’d love to see it happen, but I’d rather not use my savings money to bail you out of jail.”
He walked in a few steps, looked around at the furniture, and the fixtures, and the decorations, the little indicators that it was definitely Steve’s place. There was a record player in the corner, and the TV was smaller than one Tony would buy for himself, and the bookshelf was practically filled to bursting. There was a big, circular case propped up against the wall, which instinct told Tony was nothing other than his famous shield (he’d definitely ask to see it later).
Tony hummed a little, and his eyes fluttered. If anyone else said the words, he’d be offended, but when Steve said them, he loved it. “Well you love this fucking
Tony talked about his kitchen adventures, mentioned the special ingredients he’d added. He talked about the project he was working on, the adjustments he wanted to make to his latest suit. He started to tell a story from his childhood too, but remembered that particular one always left him in a sour mood, so he cut it off, changed the subject. Steve made up for it with one of his own.
But Tony never tormented him about it. He hadn’t from the start, really, beyond what Steve deserved, and that in itself continued to humble him, and probably would the rest of his life.
They sat in silence for a moment, some kind of horrible tension lingering in the air between them. Tony was sure Steve could hear his heart beating with how fast it was, and Steve was sure his face was turning red, that his desperation, the struggle to say more, was incredibly apparent.
Steve looked tired—it was the middle of the night after all—but didn’t seem upset, or angry, at least not at him. There was a clench in his jaw, a little furrow to his brow that told Tony he was thinking something unpleasant, and he had been ever since they left the party. Steve’s hand around his was warm though, his touch firm but gentle, and the warm washcloth stung a little, but Tony managed not to pull away, merely pursed his lips as Steve patted his hand dry and applied a band-aid.
This…there were no words for this. Steve couldn’t even open his mouth to speak, felt his heart clench and eyes burn, with confusion, and relief, and most of all, guilt.
Tony let that sink in. He wasn’t particularly surprised. “Just my luck,” he sighed, shifted a little.
Tony’s voice was full of complaint, but a little kinder, more amicable than it had been in the past. Some of the familiarity had gone back into his tone, but even so, Steve worried. It was all too easy for that to be pulled back, for Tony to get angry all over again.
“Of course I’m not sick of you. God, I could never be sick of you,” Steve replied immediately, sensing his trepidation. “Today is so important to me.
“How about you watch me paint today?” Steve asked when he finally pulled back. His eyes were warm and content, and Tony wanted to drown in them. “We’ll just take it nice and slow. Maybe go down to the beach later?”
The brunet’s voice alternated between pinched whines and dragged out moans, only intensified alongside Steve’s pace. God, he was close. He was so damn close. It never took long like this, with Steve fucking him into the bed, the exhilaration of it all. Steve’s touch set Tony’s skin ablaze, in any form, every moment they touched, but when he was being spread wide, fucked full? There weren’t any words for it.
Tony really should have put away the groceries immediately, but needed a pick-me-up so to speak, in the form of the presence his mate and child. The work could be left for later.
Tony leaned on the doorframe to the kitchen, rubbed his belly. “Smells good,” he announced, hoping to ease into a conversation.
“I do,” Steve replied with a nod, smiling a little. He leaned over the bed, grazed his teeth against the brunet’s neck. “And so do you. That’s why you’re such a brat, isn’t it? Can’t survive without me punishing you, pinning you down and fucking you into the sheets.”
Some of the abrasion between them the last few days melted away, and for a second, things felt normal again. The blond was thankful for it. When they dropped their hands he let out a little sigh, didn’t even try to hide his relief.
“That’s good,” Steve sighed, took a second to collect himself. “So good.” He rolled his hips forward experimentally, and when Tony relaxed around him, he started fucking his mouth. His pace wasn’t slow, but wasn’t all that fast either. He took his time, savored the wet heat around his cock, the way Tony made room for it.
“You’re so impatient, always trying to get what you want,” Steve chided, but pulled away. He shuffled over on the bed, and reached into the nightstand for the bottle of lube. “You want to take me without prep? I better not hear you complaining when you do.”
was crying. He could feel the hot tears running down his cheeks, but didn’t move to wipe them. He didn’t have a hand to spare at the moment.
Pepper came back with Rhodey seconds later, with the doctor on their heels. Rhodey gave Tony a reassuring smile as he entered, came to stand at his side. Pepper started wringing her hands though, and Tony didn’t feel very reassured.
“God, l-listen to you,” he gasped, slipping the hand on Tony’s chest down to his other thigh, spreading his legs wide. “Such a slut. Quick to talk back, until you’re on my cock. Can’t talk back now, c-can you?” he grit out against Tony’s ear.
short,” Tony insisted. Hell, thanks to the shoes he wore outside of the house, he was even taller, standing at 5’11” when appearing publicly.
, for money, like he used to believe, like he was told, when he was young and stupid? What’s if that’s all anyone saw him as? What’s if he made this big fancy dinner, got all dressed up just to be disappointed by his life
Of course it bothered him though. Who wouldn’t be bothered? It was uncomfortable, and demeaning, and scary, and it wasn’t the first time something like that had happened, but he hoped it would be the last. At the moment, he didn’t think he’d be going to another party any time soon. It obviously hadn’t been worth the pain, the fear and humiliation. God, he could remember it a little more vividly now that he’d properly woken up.
The scientist let out a content little sigh as the song drew to a close, though it was a little sad. He didn’t want to lose the magic of this moment, didn’t want to let it end.
Steve leaned down, pressed a kiss on his forehead. “You are,” he replied. “I think I should show you how good you are, thank you for being so good. Will you let me?”
He heaved a few breaths, his lungs feeling far too shallow, and tried again. He was afraid if he stopped entirely that it would never end, that he’d never survive this, that he’d never greet his baby.
Neither could say anything for at least a minute. They laid there, breathing heavily, heads reeling from the intensity of it all. It’d been a while since they went that hard, and it had clearly affected them both. Steve couldn’t believe what Tony had done to him, how he’d driven him wild once again, and Tony, as every time, was simply astounded at the way Steve could make him feel. It was a lot to process.
. If it were anyone else, the thought was less than appealing, but Tony knew that no matter what Steve said or did in the bedroom, he did love him, did care for him, and that he was truly indulging Tony, and the dark, kinky side that had awoken in him pretty much as soon as he was old enough to think about it, and he loved that.
Anyway this fic is dedicated to @Imperialstark because I came up with the idea speaking to her and she deserve the world for putting up with my constant whining. Also go check out the fics on her AO3 by the same username!!
Tony’s head tipped back, and his brows knit at the sensation of it all. He could feel every inch sliding in, filling him, and couldn’t help but let out a strained moan when Steve bottomed out. God, it felt good, so hot and huge inside him, filling him up like nothing else could. He was already a little sensitive he found, after how thoroughly Steve ate him out, and the two orgasms it got out of him, but sensitive in a good way, in a way that left him eager for more. He knew this was about to be
He wasn’t doing such a good job forgetting now, since he’d  called the blond—who was now on his way,
find all of you. I can’t emphasize enough how scary this is, Steve! I’ve been changing my security protocols almost daily at this point. I’m terrified to even
He’d gotten much better about letting Steve take the reins the last few months, leaving Peter in his care more often, letting Steve participate, and trying to be less possessive. It had worked out well so far, and Steve hadn’t disappointed yet, in any aspect. He adored his son, was attentive and careful, and horribly affectionate with him, like Tony had hoped he would be when they first thought about having kids, so long ago.
Tony made sure to imprint the sight to memory when he invited Steve in his lab, had him try on the finished suit for the first time. Steve seemed thoroughly impressed, and a little happy actually, and he stretched side to side, mimicked the motion of throwing his shield, tested the range of the fabric. Tony went through the specifics of the suit, the materials he used, the washability, and breathability, the extra padding, the mic built into the wristwrap of the left glove, the earpiece attached to the helmet.
? He hoped not. He hoped that just this once, this very once, things would turn out for the better, that every price he’d paid will have been worth the cost.
the protrusion under his strong fingers. It filled him with possessive heat, and suddenly, this lesson was taking too long to teach.
Tony’s heart beat a little faster, and the pause made him remember exactly what they were up to. “Can you—will you—?”
“Come on,” he said, and got his hands under Tony’s arms, lifted him from the cold, wet ground before the water could seep into his clothes. “Come on inside. We’ll get your hand all cleaned up, and then you can sleep. You’ll feel better in the morning, I promise.”
“You like that, Steve?” she asked, taking in the pinch of his brows, the way he couldn’t help but shift his hips a little, his legs spread wide to either side. There was something so hot about seeing him like this, open, at her mercy, two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle trembling just for her, open and desperate for her artificial cock.
It really had been interrupted almost that many times. They’d been met with every interruption under the sun during the last three weeks: emergency consulting calls, interview requests, fans spotting them, and even the weather had been an issue at one point. They’d started their tour of Europe up in Scotland, and arrived in Italy yesterday. They would be finishing the Honeymoon here.
to the party, and then you were intent on ruining it, acted like a little kid just to get back at me, or at your dad, or something else. I don’t know. I never know with you. All I know is you better
His smile was earnest, and his eyes were fond, and Tony felt his heart jump in his chest. He tried to play it off. “Just doing God’s work,” he replied with a shrug. “Can’t have Captain America running into battle ill-suited. Can’t stand to see his ass pressed into that blue onesie anymore either.”
Tony struggled to recall his list of names—the pain was coming back, much more subtle than before, a deep ache, but still disruptive. He still had the afterbirth to push out, and apparently it was getting tired of waiting. He let out a grunt, tried to get his brain to work.
He made a face. Tony had hoped there’d be a lot more apples available before his height would become a problem. The basket was only half full and he didn’t want to stand around awkwardly while Steve did all the work, and claiming another tree felt kind of stupid.
“FRIDAY?” The AI didn’t need much more direction than that, having dutifully processed the conversation.
“There you are. I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” Steve said pleasantly. The blond set his bags down by the balcony door. He’d gone into town, to this little art studio to buy some fresh paints and more Linseed Oil. He’d run out of Ultramarine Blue pretty quickly, painting oceanscapes, and needed to get more for his current work in progress. He got up early for it, took a leisurely walk. He liked walking to town, even if it took a long time. The landscape was nice, and he liked taking the time to soak in the details, to let the architecture and environment inspire him.
“Later,” Steve told himself in the mirror, nodded for good measure. He put the box in the pocket of his suit.
in charge here. Good. The soldier still hadn’t forgiven him for his behavior, and wasn’t going to reward Tony with an orgasm for quite a while. His own cock was begging for attention though, tenting the fabric of his pants, and Steve knew just what to do about it.
“FRIDAY, is there any footage to play back? Audio, if not visual?” Rhodey asked, rubbing circles into Tony’s back. The brunet had his face hidden in his hands, trying to settle down.
They walked around the gift shop a little. There wasn’t anything too interesting; Tony supposed all gift shops were the same, filled with postcards, little books, stuffed animals, and mugs. It was cute enough though, and he could tell the owners put in time with a few custom pieces like signs or paintings. They even had custom-made Adirondack chairs available. Tony ended up picking a little fridge magnet; they had plenty of room on theirs, and already had too many coffee mugs to count in the house. They also bought a jug of apple cider to take home, and of course, left a massive tip for the young woman working at the front desk.
Steve’s low, heavy growl reverberated around the room, and especially in Tony’s ears, pleased, aroused, and horribly attractive. His growls were always sexy, deeper, darker whenever they were in bed. They sent a chill down Tony’s spine every time, made him smirk with satisfaction.
Tony rolled his eyes, shook his head. “You’re so annoying,” he complained, though it wasn’t serious.
It was no problem being here, comforting Tony. Hell, Steve had been through a lot of ups and downs the last few months himself, and without Tony’s support, he would still be in a bad place mentally. He was stressed of course, as was the usual for all of them, but he could be doing a lot worse. If he could repay Tony for his love by simply laying with him today, he would.
Steve let out a little huff of laughter. It shook his chest, and Tony with it. “I said ‘Are you okay’?”
Tony didn’t know what made him text it. He hadn’t said it since their very first phone call, and he didn’t plan on saying it today. Maybe it was something to do with the dream he had. He’d been having lots of vivid dreams lately, and though most of them were still unpleasant, bordering on nightmares, he’d been given a nice one or two, like the one last night. He dreamt of being with Steve, out in central park on a picnic, the sun shining, the park peaceful, and their son in his arms. He dreamt Steve’s scent was soft and happy, and his eyes familiar and adoring, like late at night when they were laying in bed together. He dreamt he was
The blond crawled forward a little, braced a warm hand on Tony’s neck and brought their lips together. He kissed Tony slowly, softly, and the brunet melted against him, closed his fingers around the lapels of Steve’s jacket, arched into his hold.
The blond let out a little groan at the intrusion, big, a little intimidating but he knew he could handle it. Natasha didn’t grant him any mercy though once the head was inside, pushed forward and forward and forward until her hips hit his ass, and he was spread open, his hole fluttering around the dildo.
Tony looked at his husband and child fondly, lining up the camera properly to get a good shot. His sunglasses were resting on his head, and he had to make sure they didn’t slip, but managed just fine, kept his attention on the task at hand.
Steve didn’t waste another second on the ground. He got to his feet, his heart beating fast, and the blood rushing in his ears. There were tears on Tony’s cheeks too, he could see now, and his brow was furrowed, expression a mixture of angry and pained, and Steve’s throat felt impossibly tight. He waited for more. He expected more shouting, more insults, like he’d received over the phone so many times, like Tony should be giving him, but they didn’t seem to be coming.
There was no way in hell Rhodey was leaving Tony’s side now. He could already smell the sharp edge in his friend’s scent, the stress, the uncertainty, even, dare he say it, the
He looked handsome, as always, commanded the room so to speak, even though they were outside. The sun was still shining, illuminating his face between the leaves, especially when he took his sunglasses off specifically to pinch the bridge of his nose in annoyance. He looked
Tony can't get enough of his big, sexy werewolf boyfriend, and will gladly let him knot him over and over again.
“I love you, Tony,” the blond replied without hesitation. “I love you so much. You’re so perfect, so amazing, and you’re all mine,” he said, brushing his hand through Tony’s dark hair. He let his fingers glance Tony’s neck, with feather light touches that gave him goosebumps. “Can I touch you, sweetheart? Can I show you how good you are, how much you mean to me?”
“That’s it, yeah, yeah—“ Tony gasped, and he let go of Steve’s hands, braced them on his chest instead to give himself more leverage. He slowed his pace a little, but made up for it by clenching and unclenching his hole, shifting in the way he knew drove Steve
Steve couldn’t help but let out a puff of laughter at that. He shook his head, smiled to himself. “He’ll be here before you know it. Just a few more weeks.”
,” Steve replied. “I’m not the kind to run all over town and talk about what I like in bed,” he said. “A-and out of bed, if that wasn’t clear,” he added on, feeling a little embarrassed now.
Steve’s lips brushed against his neck, a series of kisses placed down his throat and ending at his collarbone. His bangs were hanging forward, loose and sweeping instead of slicked back like he kept them these days. They tickled on Tony’s bare skin, and he let out a quiet laugh.
Steve shut his eyes tight, shook his head and let the words fall out of his mouth. “I’m so sorry, Tony, for everything I’ve done. I know I’ve said it again and again, b-but I can never express how much I mean it. I don’t deserve you, I never did, and you were right. You were right about
“I know,” Tony replied, pressing a grateful kiss to his shoulder. “I don’t know how to thank you enough. I don’t deserve you,” he sighed.
“Then I guess I’ll be the only one eating pie tonight,” Steve replied without missing a beat. He was just teasing, but his tone was serious enough.
Steve understood that feeling all too well. They had a major responsibility to the world in general, and now that they’d thrown it into peril, it was their job to fix it. That was a lot of pressure, especially for people like them, with the eyes of every nation on them. They couldn’t afford to lose. They couldn’t afford to fuck up.
Steve managed though, after a few seconds, and slowly rocked his hips. It sent a flash of pleasure through Tony’s whole body, and he knew he’d cum as soon as Steve truly started thrusting into him.
The brunet sighed, shut his eyes. “Don’t remind me,” he replied, tucked his face further in the crook of Steve’s neck. “I’m gonna be getting an earful for the meeting I missed today.”
“Ooh, what are you gonna do, daddy? Punish me?” the brunet taunted, swaying his hips a little. Steve let out a sharp exhale, and it made Tony smirk. That nickname always did something to Steve, and it did something to Tony too, felt so wrong, but so
Steve shifted on the couch a little, got between Tony’s legs properly, a hand swung over the back of the couch for stability and the other by the brunet’s waist, and he kissed back fervently.
Rhodey had always been better at this kind of thing, and it certainly showed now. “I’m sorry,” he said almost immediately. “I’m sorry about the phone thing, and I’m sorry for what I did. I know how much it hurt you. You know I never wanna hurt you, Tony, and I’m really, really sorry I did, but you didn’t really leave me a choice. I tried to reason with you so many times, tried to get you to understand, and you always refused. I didn’t know what else to do,” he said, and Tony knew he meant it.
quiet at the moment. Tony couldn’t hear the TV playing, or any baby giggles or Steve’s voice, and when he followed Steve’s faint scent to their living room, he understood why.
being idle if it meant he had Steve all to himself.  “If I didn’t hate the rain so much, we never would have met,” Tony pointed out, tugging on Steve’s hair a little.
Today had gone uninterrupted, thankfully. They’d spent the morning at their stretch of private beach after a lovely breakfast; it was a little after one in the afternoon now. They had a dinner reservation at one of the best restaurants here in Almafi, but that wasn’t until tonight. They had plenty of time to just relax, to just
The pain seemed to radiate from his core in waves this time, only getting stronger and stronger as time passed.
Today, it left the brunet feeling drained. Peter hadn’t slept well last night either, which didn’t help the situation. The Alpha already couldn’t wait until bed time, or at least nap time this afternoon.
He missed the city. He hadn’t been living there anymore when he left, and he was comfortable in the Compound upstate, but he couldn’t help but reflect on those early days, when he and Tony first built something together, when they truly fell in love. He thought about standing on the penthouse balcony of Stark Tower at night, his arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulder, taking in the view.
It had taken so long to get him open like this, to the point where his hole was gaping wide, able to take so much, and he
sure when he would hear from Steve again though, and it was making him more than a little anxious, making his stomach turn. It didn’t help that he was alone at the moment. Rhodey had been away since this morning, taking a personal day, because Tony insisted he deserved it, and Vision was out on another tryst with Wanda and wouldn’t return for another three or so days. Tony insisted he’d be okay by himself for a little bit. He’d felt somewhat decent the last two days, a tiny bit less achy, less irritated. He was hoping that meant things were changing for the better, but now he doubted. Now, fear was seeping into his veins, and he had to find a way to stifle it.
Steve turned instantly to look at him at the touch. His blue eyes were so full of reverence that Tony’s heart skipped a beat. The blond bent down a little at his new partner’s words, brought Tony’s hand to his lips and kissed it.
Steve groaned at the sound of his voice, the way his walls clenched around him, squeezed him tight. He mumbled something Tony couldn’t quite understand, and then he surged forward, gripped Tony’s hips a little tighter, his cock throbbing as he came, and painted the brunet’s insides with hot cum. Tony shuddered at the sensation, and Steve rode out his orgasm with little thrusts, moaning soft and breathlessly, and he couldn’t seem to stop moving his hips, reluctant to give up the vice around his cock, wet now with his cum, a little looser thanks to Tony’s orgasm. “Fuck…
“You’d let me do it, if I wanted to,” Steve retorted. “You’d let me show them all how sweet you look, how beautiful you sound moaning on my dick…” He rocked forward just a fraction then, let his length press against the brunet’s prostate.
The brunet thought he was going to lose his mind. He was truly regretting his behavior now, didn’t think he could take much more of this, this perfect torture, this taste of his own medicine, which he so clearly deserved. “Come on!” he complained. “If you fucking move I’m gonna cum, seriously—“
“You’ve got it,” Steve assured him, and he dove in for another kiss, shifting his hips up against Tony’s, caressing his skin, every inch he could find, and Tony’s hands settled in his hair, fingers curled around the golden strands, tugged a little in a way that had Steve grunting into his mouth, and they kissed and kissed and kissed until Tony’s lips were pink and swollen, until even Steve’s face was red with it, and his cock was hard and leaking in his jeans.
tight. Steve was a little more sensitive like this, though he never understood quite why(perhaps it had to do with instinct, with his senses. Everything was dialed higher, more visceral, more primal), and each time the head of his cock pressed against Tony’s walls, pleasure rolled through him so good he had to keep himself from shredding the sheets apart.
He tried not to think on it too long, especially when his eyes started burning with unshed tears. He held Steve’s pillow tight, stared at a blank spot on the wall for an hour or two, until hunger drove him to action.
Neither had known that day that they would end up finding a companion for life. They’d been together three years now, had moved in together only 9 months after meeting, and things were going insanely well. They argued on occasion, and Tony had spent more than one night on the couch, and Steve too, but they always apologized at the end of the day, always worked things out.
He grimaced, but nodded. “I do. I do, but…if they got a hold of the flip phone, the line might not be secure anymore. Hell, they might be on the doorstep of the Compound now.”
him, as it did every time, big enough to stretch his jaw, to make breathing difficult, and Tony loved it. Steve drew back before the tip hit Tony’s throat, and he let him adjust his breathing. The way the brunet’s eyes fluttered, and how his fingers tightened on the bed sheets made it really difficult to restrain himself, but he managed.
He regarded the blond fondly, took in every detail for the millionth time, as if he didn’t have the lines of Steve’s face memorized. He’d changed just a bit since they met, still looked young and healthy and unbelievably handsome, but there were one or two wrinkles starting to form, just visible when he frowned or smiled really wide. Time changed everyone, even a super soldier. Tony just felt lucky he would be at Steve’s side for it.
“You’re the taller one. You should be picking all the apples,” Tony pointed out, though it was just a joke.
“It’s not fine,” the blond insisted, pulling Tony close by the elbow. The brunet resisted at first, but then melted against him. Steve held him tightly, pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I’m so, so sorry. I never would’ve said yes if I knew how late I’d be.”
“You asked for it,” Steve replied, and Tony could feel the way he shrugged his shoulders with it. “I wanted to take it slow, but you said you could handle it.”
Peter slept a lot. His tiny body needed plenty of rest to begin with, but with the addition of the sickness, of the fever, he wasn’t as active as he should be. When he was awake, he would sometimes cry in discomfort, cough occasionally between sobs, and Tony would hold him closer, try to convey his love, try to pray away the problem. There was no praying it away, though. There was only one thing that would take this away, that would take all of it away, from both of them.
Tony turned a little, met Steve’s eyes. There were a few tears still leaving tracks down his cheeks, but he couldn’t bring himself to brush them away. His eyes were dark, kind of distant, withdrawn.
The way he said it had a wave of pleasure, a sweet, honey-like pleasure wrapping around Tony, making him a little more empty-headed, drowning him a little like he needed. His fingers curled around Steve’s shoulders, and he shut his eyes tight. “Shit, yeah? Good? Good for you?” he gasped, moving to meet each sharp thrust, tightening the circle of his ankles that much more to really give Steve leverage.
he going to say? How was he going to explain it all to the press? His absence from the public eye the last few months hadn’t gone unnoticed. There were tons of wild theories, ranging from kidnapping to rehab to institutionalization, but none them had hit the nail on the head so far. Tony would have to explain it all eventually, because the world would want to know, was surely watching with bated breath. He wasn’t sure yet, how he was going to break the news.
His fingers glanced the harness on her hips, and a shudder of anticipation went through him, had his cock leaking a little. Fuck, did he want it. He wanted the strap so bad.
“I’m sorry for running into you—I shouldn’t have been so close, but I really hate the rain and I’m cold as hell and you were going the same way, so I’ve sort of been using your umbrella for cover? I know that’s really weird, but I mean, if you hadn’t stopped, you would’ve never have known, so it’s kind of your fault that we’re having this awkward moment. Shit, okay, it’s not
want to disappoint Steve, not really. He hoped he’d never disappoint Steve, ever. He knew Steve didn’t particularly like Tony’s way of having fun, the way he behaved at his father’s parties, but he obviously tolerated it, or else this whole thing would be going differently. Steve was in charge here, but he knew Tony was enjoying it, despite how frustrating it was. He knew they both needed it this way, that negotiations made in bed were more reliable than those while clothed(at least in their case.) It was always when Tony was coming undone like this that he could be persuaded easier, that his confidence took a step back and left him more malleable.
He could feel himself rising up that peak, felt it in the way his muscles tensed, the way he couldn’t help but push back against Steve’s hips, desperate for that extra little bit, that last thrust that would send him tumbling over the edge,  but the fun wasn’t over anytime soon. Steve would fuck him more than once, always did, would fuck him until he was open and shaking and
Suddenly, the distance between them felt a little too large, like a great divide, and he wanted nothing more than to fill it.
Steve felt his shoulders drop a little in relief. He nodded a little. “I’m trying,” he replied. “I really am. I know it hasn’t been good enough—“
Ross didn’t seem happy exactly, but he didn’t seem quite as angry. Their performance was doing its job; it seemed his fears were placated at least a little, if the way his shoulders dropped a little were any indication.
He’d been having an okay time, before it all happened. Well, maybe not that great of a time. He’d gone to the party because he was lonely, because an old MIT alum he still talked to on occasion invited him, and he had nothing else to do. He’d gone because he missed Rhodey, so much, because he couldn’t talk to him, and he didn’t have anyone else. He’d gone because he wanted to drown in his sorrows a little, maybe have some laughs, flirt a little bit, because he knew that he couldn’t have who he really wanted.
“We need to find a way to communicate with them,” Rhodey said. “If we could figure out how to do that, all of this would be way easier.”
? He didn’t think so, and neither did everyone else. They placed the blame all on him (but it wasn’t just him who did it! Bruce did it too! Ultron was the combination of both of their intellects. He belonged to both of them!) which wasn’t all too surprising, but didn’t make anything easier.
Steve’s arms wrapped around his back, held him close, and he let out a grunt, pumped his hips a little as he came, even though he was as deep as he could be. It took a long time to finish, as it always did when he knotted, and by the time he was spent, it was hard to think for a few seconds.
Tony was already looking pretty miserable. He’d been in such better spirits the last few days, but it seemed that was over. Rhodey couldn’t blame him. No one wanted to deal with this. No one knew exactly what
he approve of? But Tony didn’t want to make him angry, didn’t want to end up with another nasty bruise like he’d gotten a few weeks ago. Anything but that.
The blond withdrew his hand now, looked down at Peter once more. His eyes had drifted closed again, and though he wasn’t asleep yet, he was calm, content.
He thought about what it’d be like to have a big group of friends, not just one friend who was halfway across the world right now, pursuing his own dream, and having to rely on letters and one phone call every month to catch up. He thought about what it’d be like to sit in a little local hot spot, relaxing, talking, laughing for hours and feeling okay, and asking “Same time next week?” and doing it all over again for the rest of his life, making it a tradition, a habit, that wasn’t destructive or ended up with somebody or other getting hurt. He thought about what it’d be like to have a connection like that, a life like that.
“I will search the crash site,” Vision said when there was a moment of silence. “I will report all of my findings, whether they seem irrelevant or not. Further analysis might provide us with a clue as to their whereabouts.”
Tony thought his heart was breaking. He’d felt that way so many times throughout his life, too many times to count, as long as he could remember, but this time, he well and truly meant it. The phone call, the drafting of the Treatise had been exhausting, had left him with a headache and a raw throat from talking, debating. It left him feeling shame, his pride all but depleted due to the begging, the pleading he had to endure to get any of this to work.
She let out a pleased little noise at the memory of it all, at how fervently Steve had kissed her, his hands wandering, insistent, trying to grasp as much of her in his arms as possible, as if he would die without her touch.
Tony let out a little whimper at the heat, and Steve’s face was tucked against his shoulder, letting out little grunts as they slid against each other, fucked into the channel of their combined hands. There’d have to be clean-up later, which he wasn’t looking forward to, but he couldn’t bring himself to care when Tony started talking again.
“It’s not your fault, Tony,” Steve reminded him softly, pressed a kiss to his shoulder. “And I sure as hell don’t blame you. I never could.”
The brunet took it without question, and they headed down the dark hall to the kitchen to find their candles.
of July. Naturally, this suit fit well, suited him entirely, and yes, that included his ass. Tony made
Rhodey didn’t want to push him into it, not after everything. He thought of course it’d be better if he and Steve communicated openly, comfortably, but he supposed he understood Tony’s hesitance, after all the brunet had admitted.
Rhodey’s irritation was palpable, his scent strong and aggressive, flooding the room. His fists were clenched, and Tony locked a hand around his wrist now, tugged on it a little to remind the Alpha to behave. Tony would’ve preferred letting Rhodey go, letting him have his way with Ross, but that wouldn’t end well for anyone. They couldn’t afford to fuck up.
“You’re delusional,” Tony replied, and the hand near Steve’s ass slid immediately back up towards his shoulders. “I’m talking to
,” Tony joked, stared down at his cup. If he looked at Steve right now he thought he’d be blinded by the light, could feel the heat creeping up on his cheeks. “Seriously, it’s good. You really didn’t have to get me anything though. You didn’t have to let me sleep in your bed either. I would have been fine on the couch.”
“Roger that. We’re on our way to the next target. Ironically, we’ve been led in a huge circle. Remember that facility in Italy that caught on fire?”
He was spread wide open, stretched to his limit. His hole was hot and sloppy and wet with so much lube he felt it could’ve filled a bottle. He felt laid bare, put on display, open and slutty and like a plaything, though there was no one here but him and Steve, Steve inside him, big and hard and pushing up against his prostate, but there was something else too. Stuffed in his hole beside the soldier’s cock was a dildo, almost the same size, spreading him wide. They were
The brunet hesitated just a second, and did as instructed, flipped over on the bed so he was facing Steve.
“You have wonderful ideas,” Steve agreed. “Your brain, the things you come up with, they blow me away, Tony.” The fact that Tony had asked something like this at all was indicative of his mental state. In a good mood, Tony never second-guessed himself, never doubted his own abilities. Now though, he’d fallen victim to Howard’s poisonous words, and not for the first time. This was a softer Tony, one who needed to be reassured, who needed Steve to reassure him.  It’d take a long time to build him back up again, and Steve knew just how.
Tony averted his gaze, tried to smile. “It’s fine,” he said instinctively, even though it felt like his lungs were being squeezed by invisible hands. “I know, I get it, I—“
“I’m…I’m not alright. Not with what happened. B-but I’m alright with being here. With you,” Tony said, scooted over on the couch closer, their legs pressed together now, and he hoped his expression suggested the sincerity of his words.
Steve pitched forward a few inches without warning, slid against his prostate and Tony took in a sharp breath. “W-wait!
The brunet’s fingers tightened around the sheets, and he let out a harsh breath, squeezed his eyes shut. His legs were trembling from the exertion already, and he was just about ready to shoot off, to cum all over the bed again. He’d already cum twice since they started.
He looked around again, took in the slowly yellowing leaves on the trees, the slight, crisp breeze in the air, the nearby rushing of water. There must have been a waterfall nearby, or a river at least, but he couldn’t see it past the old building ahead of them, and the foliage surrounding it. The orchard was surely on the other side, hidden from view, as well as the source of rushing water. It seemed interesting enough of a place, small and cute, and long-standing.
“Sweetheart, I never thought I’d be lucky enough to have one kid, especially not one as amazing as ours. But you did that.
It was a little like lifting a sack of flower. He was practically deadweight. Tony got like that too when he slept, all loose-limbed like a rag doll. It was kind of funny. Apparently he’d passed that trait along, like Steve had passed on his loud sneezes and his hatred of ginger.
Steve didn’t really have a praise kink(or so he told himself), but he couldn’t deny it felt good, hearing Tony’s voice go all smooth and dreamy, hearing him say nice things, how well Steve was satisfying him.
A few raindrops splattered against the window of their apartment, carried by a gust of wind. It was dark and grey outside, despite it only being around 4pm, but inside it was bright and cozy, so Tony could ignore it. Steve was heavy and warm against him, but never overwhelming despite his size.
Either way, Tony kept brushing his fingers against Steve’s as they passed market stalls, gave him those eyes that said he was up to trouble, and Steve, as always, walked willingly into his trap by asking what he wanted.
Steve got kind of lost, washing up their mugs in the sink. There was a window above the sink which let him peer onto the deserted street below, and he found himself unable to tear his eyes away from it. Nobody was out walking, but the streetlights cut interesting shapes into the pattern of the flagstones, still wet from a rain shower earlier. They made him think of the reflection of the city lights in Manhattan on car windows and shop faces. They made him think of home.
“But if you did that, then I wouldn’t have a reason to do this,” Steve replied, and let his lips wrap around the head once more, swirled his tongue for emphasis. It always drove Tony nuts when he did that, and it did it this time too.
with him. He knew Tony loved him, knew he was happy with him, despite their bad days. He knew none of this should have been scary.
Steve’s face only fell more, his expression full of guilt and desperation.  “I need to talk to him,” he said again. “Please.” Every second that passed without a phone in his hands made him feel more panicked, more helpless.
“Shh, shh,” Steve replied, lifted a hand to brush through his hair comfortingly. “I’ve got you. You’re okay, Tony,” he said, and Tony tried to believe it. He wanted to believe it.
“Shh,” Steve replied, tone soft. He gripped Tony’s hip with one hand, and used his other to line up the tip of his cock. “You just worry about staying relaxed and open. If I can’t get in, then we’re not doing it at all tonight.”
“These are yours,” Steve said against his ear, his free hand coming up to curl around Tony’s, holding the box. His touch was so soft, a gentle caress, his long fingers brushing against Tony’s in a way that made the scientist’s otherwise deft hands
Steve exhaled softly. Tony didn’t toss out apologies lightly. He was prideful, they both were, so whenever the words were spoken, Steve knew they were earnest. “I know.”
“Yours,” Tony agreed. “All yours. I’m all open, ready just for you, for my big, good boy,” he purred, partly breathless, and it was worth it for way Steve’s cock pulsed inside him, pleased with the praise.
“…You know you can’t,” he said softly, even though it pained him to say it. “It’d be too hard. We don’t know if it would even take.”
Steve looked at him, the depth in his blue eyes expressing a lifetime’s worth of relief. “I am,” he said. “I really am.”
Steve didn’t hesitate then. Tony knew his limits, had never put himself in danger when they lain together. If Tony wanted it harder, Steve would give it to him harder. He snapped his hips a little more insistently, fucked in tandem with the dildo. Each thrust had Tony keening, his hands twisting in the bed sheets, his body tensing with the pleasure. Every inch of him felt like a live wire, the electricity running through his limbs. He was sensitive, on edge, felt pulled apart and malleable, stretched like putty in Steve’s arms. He was babbling, he knew, couldn’t keep his mouth shut, said whatever came to mind.
By the time the words were all out he was feeling breathless and embarrassed. He always rambled when he was taken off guard, or when he felt a certain kind of way, and he hated it. More than one person had told him it was a bad habit, that they couldn’t stand it, and so he couldn’t stand it in himself. It was one of his worst qualities he was sure.  The fact that his mouth started running away from him now made him feel even worse, and he started to take swift steps to get around Steve and down the street, his bags clenched in his fists.
“Apparently, what we just did,” the soldier replied. “Nice to do once in a while, but I wouldn’t want to rely on it. The city can get crazy, and I’m glad we don’t live
to without his permission? Who had tried to hurt him, force him into something he didn’t want? Who had taken advantage of him, made him feel this way?
