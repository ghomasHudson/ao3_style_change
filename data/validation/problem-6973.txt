“Oh good. I’ll let Ana know to set another place.” He headed up towards the front steps and was through the door before Steve could decline the invitation again. Guess he was staying for dinner.
He was thinking about it as he walked towards the kitchens early one evening. There had been an announcement of a large games in the summer, to celebrate the emperor’s birthday. It would mean rich rewards if he fought well, which was good, though the most enticing offer had been boon from the emperor himself to any man willing to fight to take on a great challenge. It was a risk. The prize might be offered in earnest, but men in power did not like to lose. It’s possible the tasks were made to be unwinnable. Stíofán had considered it, but it was too dangerous he’d decided. For now, there was no reason they couldn’t wait, play it safe until another option made itself known.
“Mom always said the first step was to go to the town square and announce yourself as the new town witch. So I guess we do that, and I’m sure we’ll know exactly what we need to do. Perhaps when we meet the mayor I can make his car better, show off what I can do.”
“I’d never think of asking,” Steve said, looking like butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth. “But if we just so happen to have the ingredients to hand…”
“I don’t care if he has a mortgage, seven charming yet rambunctious plant children and saves kittens from trees on his day off, you do
When he peeked back out from behind the shield, he stared into its eyes expecting the killer instinct of a predator, but instead, he saw...sadness.
“Pot. Kettle,” Tony shot back and knew he was right about how much time she’d been spending in the workroom when she flushed.
He waited for the signal, gun at the ready as Phillips rode into the camp and started shouting orders. As the leader of the gang raised his pistol, Steve pulled the trigger, knocking it from his hand.
He was being presented as the Sheriff’s new omega, in his new home, and he would look his best damnit.
“Very kind, but no. I have other appointments I must make. But I’ll see you for cards at Wilson’s next week?”
Readjust. Like he was just an ordinary soldier returned home from a tour. There was a big difference though, between a few years away from home and seventy.
Artist Rogers must’ve caught Jan’s gesture, because he turned to look at them, deep blue eyes wide and curious. Tony wasn’t ashamed to admit he felt a swoop in his belly, the guy was cute.
So Stíofán told them the tale of Mac Da Thó’s pig, so big it could only be carried by forty oxen and how it had been cooked for a great feast where the heroes fought over who would get the lion’s share.
“I’m Kamala Khan, I’m majoring in biological engineering and I’m from New Jersey.” She looked pointedly at Maria.
Before Tony could answer, the first omega scowled. “It seems my cousin has forgotten her manners. I’m Miss Foster, and this is Miss Lewis.”
He shifted a little, trying to ease the feeling, and he let the damp cloth swipe across Steve's torso, carefully gliding around the bandaged wound.
He heard a shocked gasp, and he had no doubt it was one of the gossipy trio he’d seen join the onlookers, but he just rolled his eyes. Lying on his belly, he smiled reassuringly at Vision – who gave him a pained grimace in reply – and ran his eyes over the problem. When he came back up, he was covered in mud but feeling sure. He looked up as Mr Barton reappeared and waved him over.
Steve sighed, “I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused, he’ll succeed,” He glanced back at Bruce, “We have orders. We should follow them,”
When someone knocked on his door, Tony frowned; he figured Fury or one of the agents would just radio in if they desperately required his presence. He doubted they were being old-fashioned for Captain America’s sake.
“It’s like calisthenics,” Tony shrugged, “You might have missed a couple things, you know, while you were doing time as a Capsicle,” Tony briefly looked Steve up and down. He felt a strong desire to cover up somehow. He never had felt completely comfortable in his new body.
Steve watched as the monitor faded to black. Thor, the Asgardian, stood with his back to the screen, staring into a corner of the briefing room, apparently too troubled to speak.
struggled to get over jet lag when he flew internally; Cap was dealing with 70 years’ worth. He considered getting Pepper to buy a couple of original ‘40s tech. Tony could fix them up and slowly upgrade Cap over time. Like a fast track of the last century’s innovation.
Steve looked him in the eye, “Then prove it,” He took a deep breath; his heart was in his mouth, “Put the hammer down,”
Natasha Romanoff still bothered him from the time she posed as his secretary. Thor was stubborn but he seemed protective of Earth and its inhabitants. Fury seemed antsy: there was something he wasn’t telling them.
He couldn’t keep up the pace forever though. Eventually, his body made the decision for him one afternoon as he was helping out at the bakery.
“Pleasure to meet you,” Tony replied in turn. “And I’m happy to be here. Everyone in this town seems so nice.”
He sounded so sure that Tony couldn’t find it in him to disagree. He’d never been told he was special for something that wasn’t his magic or his family’s business.
“Oh, my alpha is sooo busy looking after this town that he didn’t have time to come home. So I’m just making sure he doesn’t waste away, poor thing,” Tony tittered sweetly. God, he was laying it on thick.
Steve nodded, nuzzling the back of his neck. “You haven’t caught the fever, it seems Lady Luck is on our side.”
Although things had improved at home, it wasn’t until a trip to the General Store that Tony realised perhaps their initial difficulties had been far too obvious about town.
He was just so sweet and so funny, and Peter adored him and he had a cute dog and-- honestly, there was just so much there and Tony really had no idea what to do with it.
Tony hesitated, looking uncomfortable, and Stíofán stood, taking his hand and leading him around to his side of the table. He sat back down, widening his legs and tugging the doe to sit on his lap. “I’m glad you could join us.”
Tony was shaking his head before he even finished, his hand squeezing S’Teve’s shoulder tightly. “You are one whole person, S’Teve. Best of both worlds. And proof the Federation wasn’t wrong when they said we could co-exist together. I’m sorry if what I said seemed like I was making fun of you. I wasn’t, I promise.” Tony took a deep breath and looked up at him, those dark brown eyes meeting his, filled with something S’Teve didn’t immediately recognise, even with his empathic abilities.
Stíofán stretched, his back popping as he took a break from stirring the straw and mud needed for the walls.
“And that’s why I have Jarvis. So I don’t see what the problem is.” He sat down, digging into his own breakfast.
“A new broom,” Steve repeated, accidentally smudging icing on his face in his enthusiasm. “You said you’d made one that works better than plain old wood, why not make one again?”
“Oh,” Steve answered, unsure what to say. It was difficult not to simply speak freely, ask about the old days or the war. “I’m happy you were able to get away.”
He was beautiful: flushed, and gorgeous, and so obviously exhausted, but all the more striking for it. Steve encouraged him, using his hands to increase the sensations, brushing over hot sensitive skin, until Tony was almost feral with it, chasing his release with wild abandon as Steve focused on keeping him safely cradled against him.
Now he’d been told that in this time you could take a guy on dates. Marry him. Adopt children and live together, and the only people who would bat an eye were assholes to begin with.
He must want Tony to ready himself. Tony nodded, getting up and heading to the bedroom to rifle through his trunk. He had prepared for this.
“If you’re sure. God, what a mess. I really am sorry. I’m late for a meeting, and I got a bit of tunnel-vision.”
Sam was right. He and Tony had gotten better over the years at talking about things, the more they got to know each other and fell in love, but there were still times when it was hard to talk about the tough stuff - especially when they didn’t want to hurt the other. And it was becoming clear that this was one of the big things they were going to have to discuss if they wanted to move forward and be happy. Because it was getting harder and harder to see the disappointment on Tony's face when he started getting the pre-heat symptoms that let him know the last attempt was unsuccessful. Steve would do anything in the world to get him to stop making that particular face, the expression cutting into his chest every time he saw it. It was tough having a problem that he knew he couldn't fix just by being stubborn enough.
“A guy should treat his fella right. In my opinion.” Steve put Tony in the car, and closed the door behind him, leaning over the window. “I’ll meet you back at the tower after we’ve debriefed.”
“Yeah! It’s a Harley-Davidson WLA Liberator! I bought it from some guy who just had it sitting in his garage gathering dust. When I fix it up, it really is going to soar!”
The hand moved up and then down. “Surely you’re not sleeping so soon?” A sultry voice whispered in his ear.
“Oh my god!” Sam’s voice came from behind them, and they twisted to see Sam shoving through the crowd. As he got closer, Tony realised that there was something new about him.
“Okay, okay.” Steve opened the bottle with a pop, letting the foam drip all over him before he upended the bottle and -
Tony put a spoonful to his mouth. “Mmmmm, sweet,” he hummed around the spoon and Stíofán found his gaze drawn to the doe’s lips.
As they drove away, Tony saw the Falcon make kissy faces at Steve, who gave him a punch in the arm and snorted.
“Uh-huh, so that’s why you’ve come over. And here I thought it was to see little old me,” Tony complained, not dropping the act until Steve gave him a kiss.
“Alpine’s doc, of course,” Sam shook Tony’s hand. “It’s like she’s got nine new lives, it’s amazing.”
Tony didn’t even think. It was as if he and the broom were one, swan diving down, faster and faster, his hand reaching out and his heart pounding in his ears. He could hear Steve’s scream, and he closed his eyes, letting his magic focus until it found the watch on Steve’s wrist. His hand snapped out, curling around the thin arm and holding tight, as he pulled up, trying to save them both from the ground rushing up to meet them and--
, until the material unwrapped. Stíofán groaned as two sure hands wrapped around his straining cock.
“Then we are in agreement,” Tony said, with a cheeky grin and Mr Rogers laughed, still sounding a little overwhelmed. “If I may be so bold, since we are to be engaged, might I be permitted to call you by your Christian name?”
His mind flashed to the carefully written-out apple pie recipe tucked safely in the kitchen drawer. He’d show them.
It wasn’t only the kids who looked at him with pleading eyes. Stíofán chuckled. It wouldn’t be long before he was telling stories to a bigger audience and he couldn’t wait.
He’d been carrying a tray of cookies to add to the baking case when his vision got a bit spotty. He blinked, trying to clear it, but as he did, the world seemed to tilt sideways somehow. It felt like his feet weren’t touching the ground like they should, but before he could finish that thought, his shoulder hit the wall of the hallway, and he saw the ground rushing up to meet him.
He felt like he could breathe again now. As he approached his side of the bed, he heard the slight rustle of Steve stirring. He looked at the duvet, looked at Steve who was blinking slowly, a smile spreading over his face and made a decision. He surged forward, pressing their lips together. Steve squeaked in surprise, but gamely wrapped his arms around Tony in return. Tony did his best to keep his focus, while he kicked frantically at the covers until they slid almost entirely off the bed. Mission accomplished.
He let Steve lead him through the crowd and to the road that would leave to Steve’s house, breathing in the now-familiar sea breeze.
He was struck on the other side, nearly spinning around as the weight of his bag was caught in the pull of gravity. He was jostled as people moved past, seemingly uncaring that they were almost knocking him over. He flung himself to the side to escape the crowd and pressed himself up against the wall of an alley.
“I demand retribution,” Hodge snapped, looking at Steve. “If you won’t take a hand to your omega, I will. He needs to learn some damn respect.”
Tony rolled his eyes as he came up on the tank where more and more robots were stomping out onto the streets. There were so many that he was kind of wondering how exactly the villain of the week had stored them all in one single tank. It would probably be interesting to take it apart.
When Tony slipped into bed that evening, he thought about Steve and how good he’d been with Peter. Tony hadn’t really dated since he’d become a parent, too caught up in learning the tricks of the trade, and not wanting to make the mistakes his own Dad had made. They were ok now, but it had taken a lot of time and talking to get their relationship to a good place, and he never wanted that with Peter. So yeah, maybe his libido was having a bit of a
“I’m not sure I could fit another slice,” he told Tony conspiratorially. “But I happen to know two fellas that could.”
“If you’re heading on to Los Angeles, I would highly recommend both the Yosemite National Park - very scenic and peaceful - and since you’re in the area, there’s a lovely town nearby called Cedar Grove. Very picturesque.” He raised an eyebrow. “And a nice place to take a break.”
Stíofán followed the order, shepherding Tony through the door. He glared at Hammer’s inspection of his mate, moving to block his view. They went to the kitchen, where Stíofán introduced Tony to the does who made the food. They seemed wary, no doubt having heard where he’d come from, but put him to work. Stíofán took a seat at one of the long tables they ate at, waiting for his morning meal.
The omega looked like he’d swallowed a lemon but nodded and walked off to join his friends who looked equally unimpressed.
“It’s not just legs anymore, I have plans for a bionic eye, to replace the eye ol’ Fluffy lost in an alley fight, right?”
“That would be nice,” Tony admitted. “But it doesn't really help me now. I haven’t got anywhere to live.” He blinked back the tears, trying not to show he was crying. He was an adult now, dammit.
Dad looked smug and Pops rolled his eyes, swatting at him gently. “Alright, how about we go grab some lunch, and grab the last few things on your list from the store?”
“I don’t see how that has anything to do with you,” Stíofán offered, his eyes already drawn over Tiberius’ shoulder, where Tony was carrying a tray of steaming bowls. He swallowed a growl as he watched some of the other gladiators give the doe heated glances, but everyone kept their hands to themselves, and did nothing more than say a polite ‘thanks’.
“Yeah it does,” Tony agreed, a grin stretching across his face. He blinked back relieved tears as ran his fingers absentmindedly through Steve’s hair, unconsciously checking for bumps. “I think it would’ve hurt even more without the broom.”
He took a deep breath, grunting when the corset bit into his skin. God, he was growing to hate this thing. But it made him look shapely, and the last thing he wanted was to make Steve even
When he could bear to look away from her he stepped back towards the donkey and smiled at Tony. “Ma, this is my family.” He took Tony’s hand placing a kiss to his knuckles. “This is Tony.” Then he gently placed their joined hands on Tony’s rounded stomach. “And this is our little one.”
Tony snorted. “Yours is short enough, you little monster. And you hated when Papa gave you a haircut.”
When it came to changing the bandages, however, it was Tony who was more affected. He peeled back the linens carefully and found his breath catching in his throat as he looked at the wound. It was ugly and painful-looking, and Tony had no doubt it would scar, though Natasha had given him a salve to help reduce that too.
“What he means is, we’re glad you two have worked things out, but perhaps keep it restricted to the homestead,” Sam offered, grabbing Bucky by the arm and pulling him out the door. “We’ll give you a minute.”
Tony had to blink at his words, the threat of tears almost taking over. He smacked Steve’s arm. “How is it you always know what to say?”
As they reached the steps of the townhouse, Steve swung Peter down and let him hug Dodger goodbye. Steve looked at Tony. “So I guess I’ll see you guys at the park?”
He stepped inside, the shop smelling pleasantly of paper and the faintest trace of coffee, and to his joy, it was quiet. The right kind of quiet, the sort that meant the noise in his head went away and all that mattered was the moment he was in. He felt all his tenseness ease.
“Fine,” Tony said, trying to reassure, but the blood seemed to drain from the Sheriff’s face the longer he waited.
“Ask before I pat one, so they don’t get scared,” Peter recited, nearly bouncing in his seat. “I want to see a big one and a little one, and a big one…”
, when Mr Stark had come in, fresh from a meeting with his banker - which Steve only knew about because the man had spent breakfast whining about the inconvenience - and perched himself on the bench beside them.
“Don’t you fucking dare,” Steve said, but Bucky could see an unwilling smile tugging at his lips as he started to wipe ineffectually at the mess on his pecs. Well, on his everywhere, really. “It’s good to hear you laugh like that again.”
As he walked along, broom over his shoulder, he could see people eating their lunch and hanging out on the grass. Clearly it was enough of a crowd pleaser that people were flocking to it.
His stomach grumbled. He was pretty hungry. But oh, that meant his alpha had prepared the morning meal and done the chores Tony was meant to do. It was his first day as omega of the house, and he hadn’t done a thing. Shame burned in his cheeks, but he took the food with thanks and took a seat when it was pulled out for him.
“It’s landing in the street!” Darcy yelled from the bookshop and Steve felt his eyes fall shut. He wasn’t ready for it to be over, wasn’t ready to say goodbye. He felt like crying but his eyes were dry as he turned to face the street, watching as the helicopter landed on the main street, and Director Fury stepped onto the asphalt.
Stíofán pulled a log free to reveal the kids underneath and breathed a sigh of relief as he realised the way the wood had fallen had boxed them in and stopped them being crushed. “Thank fuck.”
They sat down at the back, at a table tucked in the corner, Tony waving to the waitress. She took their orders, her disposition pleasant and bubbly, and eventually brought them coffee and sandwiches. Steve’s stomach grumbled. He hadn’t realised how long it had been since he’d eaten. He tucked into the food gratefully, watching Tony as he explained the cafe, pointing to a few of the cats that were apparently regulars. The way his eyes lit up, the tilt of his head, he reminded Steve of someone, he just couldn’t place it.
When they walked home, Steve carried the mail home in one arm, his other around Tony until Tony gave him a nudge.
“I don’t-- is he?” Rhodey sounded just as shocked, his hand twisting in the fabric of Tony’s sweater.
As he turned, something shiny caught his eye. He squinted to see something metallic in the depths of the shed. He wandered over, the thought that it might be rude to snoop overtaken by his surprise when he looked inside.
“So, what I’m saying is, we should take responsibility, right? And really, we don’t want him to grow up confused so maybe you should stay over sometimes and -”
which echoed across the stadium. He could hear the crowd now, a mix of cheers and jeers from all around and he kicked out a hoof to catch another gladiator in an unarmoured part of his leg. He pulled his sword from the scabbard and swung it bringing it down as the man lifted a gauntleted arm to block it. It came crunching down and the man yowled at his no-doubt broken arm. He saw the others approaching and on some wild instinct tossed the shield bouncing it off one into the other and knocking them to the ground. Three down and three to go. He ran forward throwing himself at and crashing them to the ground. The fight wasn’t to the death, and Stíofán made sure to draw visible blood without too much damage, and pushed himself up for the last of his opponents. He was getting tired, so he was glad of the extra training.
“I understand. And I want to start making it up to you. So, tomorrow, how about I start teaching you how to ride?” The alpha hummed. “Maybe we should go over to the Barton farm and get you a horse of your own.”
Tony opened his eyes to the sound of voices above him and saw two stressed-looking bakers standing over him.
Deputy Wilson snorted. “Most of them are fine enough, but we do get our share of trouble. Oh, I almost forgot -” Then he ducked under his desk for a moment before pulling out a package wrapped in brown paper. “Mr Rogers, a housewarming gift for you, from myself and Mrs Wilson.”
“Yes we can,” Tony told him snippily. He felt Jarvis’ paw on his ankle, a gentle reminder to mind his manners.
“Yes, well, you wouldn’t have much cause to. And it only happens sometimes, when I’m stressed or surprised. But forget it, it’s not a big deal, I’m used to it. Now, where were we?”
He took out his wallet, flashing the green as Pepper saw the last woman through the door and returned to their spot on the floor.
Steve stared for a long moment and then burst out laughing. “Oh my god. You’re one of the groupies they warned me about.”
“Yeah I know,” she said, and she did. Her family wasn’t much for sitting around when someone needed them.
“Take that grin off your face,” Tony said with a glare. “You can be happy when this passes. Until then, you can rub my back and bring me some of that spicy root the other does chew on for the sickness.”
The emperor stared for a moment. Then a wide grin spread over his face, a booming laugh echoing across the arena. “So you have, and it was an entertaining match. So,
It was starting to get late, the sounds of revelry starting in the courtyard as the others celebrated the end of the games with wine and song. Tired, and not wanting to take Tony out for the first time while everyone was in such high spirits, Stíofán suggested they sleep.
“We could use my workshop! I have loads of spare parts, a bench for you to work at, and I know someone who can order you anything you need for cheap.”
“He just can’t help himself. If there’s an asshole running his mouth, there’s Steve telling him to shut it.”
He felt Tony relax against him, his breath evening out, before he realised the omega had fallen asleep on him. He smiled a little, glad he could be of some help.
Deputy Wilson’s voice came muffled from outside. “Marshall’s in town. There’s a gang he’s chasing, and they’ve fled into the hills. He needs our help.”
“Stay out of trouble,” Stíofán said, rubbing his thumb over Tony’s hand. “The does in the kitchen should take care of you but if there’s any trouble come find me.”
“Perfect,” Tony breathed, his grin wide. “And I mean, since I’m already ahead, why quit now?” And he leaned up and pressed his lips to Steve’s.
“No sir. Just some friendly chitchat. Nothing more. Right?” Hodge, the alpha looked at him expectantly. Tony felt a flush of anger at this man’s audacity to lie about him. But at the same time, he just wanted this to be over, and he didn’t want to make a fuss if it wasn’t needed.
He handed the ginger to Hugh who knee walked back up the bed to present it to Tony who smiled gratefully. Stíofán removed the clay pot and cleaned it out, before coming back to lie at the head of the bed, pulling Tony up to lie against him.
“I wasn’t quite sure what was best to get, as my omega’s out of town at the moment, and she usually handles gifts. But I know she always said the thing she found hardest moving out here was the climate and the work making her hands so dry,” Deputy Wilson said, gesturing to the pots. “She ended up making her own salves to fix the problem, so I thought you might benefit.”
He slipped away, still bare, to the other room and came back a moment later with a basin and cloth. “Uh, you can, I’ll…” He grabbed his shirt and breeches, closing the door behind him.
Tony opened his mouth to ask what the hell the guy was talking about, but then the cowl was pushed back to reveal…
Ah. Yes. Those had been Ana’s contributions – the older omega loving but practical. She’d done as he had after all: left home to marry someone far away. If anyone knew what to do, it was her.
“I got it!” Luis crowed, jogging back inside for a moment before returning triumphantly. “On the house.”
Tony was reading a news report on his tablet - the Avengers had apparently stopped an alien invasion, though Captain America had taken a tumble from the craft by the looks of the video - when he heard the sound of the penthouse elevator pinging open. Tony looked up and his jaw dropped.
Steve felt the acid in his stomach before he processed what Tony was saying, “You think Fury’s hiding something?”
Bruce nodded, “So, why didn’t S.H.I.E.L.D bring him in on the tesseract project? What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?”
he'd done. He hadn’t expected to fall asleep, but he supposed it had been a long day. Blinking rapidly, he noticed the coolness of the sheets. Steve wiped his eyes and looked around the room a little frantically. He stood quickly and peered into the bathroom. Tony was gone.
Everything in him on fire. Tony moaned softly as Steve grazed his teeth over his throat. Steve felt a jolt of desire rush to his groin. He exhaled over the bruise he’d marked on Tony’s throat and Tony breathed in sharply. Steve glanced at Tony’s face. He looked thoroughly wrecked, his lips kiss-bitten, his throat slowly reddening, his pupils blown wide with desire.
Tony walked back around the table behind Bruce so that he didn’t have to brush up against Steve as he pulled out a small tablet, “I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D’s secure files.”
Tony stared at the basin, a feeling of dread settling in the pit of his stomach. He hadn’t been knotted. He’d made a mess of his
Tony nestled into his arms for a moment, and then pulled back. “Let’s find some water for clean up, then I need to sleep. It was hot in the kitchens all day, made me tired.”
to walk in the park, though that wasn’t something Steve specifically had to worry about. Not with his superstrength.
He became rapidly undistracted, however, as he was suddenly struck from the side and thrown to the floor, coffee and pastries flying everywhere. Tony grunted, a twinge in his elbow from the fall. The bitter scent of the coffee and the sugary sweet of the pastries rising up from around him, almost like a taunt.
“Can I?” Peter asked, his eyes even wider now he knew he could press his advantage. Anyone who thought kids were innocent had another thing coming, Tony thought. “Please?”
“I have a Starkphone,” Steve said, frowning when Bucky’s expression slid into his patented disappointed glare. “What?”
. The words echoed in his head, the dozens of voices who had told him he’d be fine once he just learned to move on...
Tony appeared at his shoulder, though Steve had no idea how he’d noticed he was struggling. “Hey, you ok?”
Just as it was getting to be too much, Steve got free of his Ma’s ministrations and came over, wrapping a hand around Tony’s wrist. “Want to get out of here?”
“Bleat for me,” Stíofán growled. “Come on, bleat. Let everyone hear you, tell them you’re mine. Bleat!”
“Groupy?!” Tony shrieked, tossing a pillow at Steve. “I’m just a fan! But you know what? Right now I’m thinking that maybe I’m over it. Cap sucks.”
“Baaaaaaaaa!” Tony cried, loud and desperate and Stíofán fucked him harder wanting that sweet bleat again.
“I can fix this,” he told the alpha next to him, and she looked at him eyes wide. “I need a few things, but I can get it off him.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, and Steve seemed to remember he was talking to the owner of the company and flushed. “Sorry, I mean—“
He’d learned that attention paid to the doe’s own cock made him cry out with the most gorgeous sounds, bleats and whimpers, and with enough effort was sure to make him spill and go limp. Stíofán loved how he looked after, as though Stíofán had worn him out.
“He seems to know a lot about her given they never met,” Mr Rogers said, looking over to where Rhodes was swinging the boy around, making him laugh. “He mentions her fondly often.”
They made sense to him. The way they moved and every piece working together: it was like a language he knew inherently to speak. And his magic could make it even better. He could make things work on their own, he could repair appliances with a flick of his wrist and he could even make them fly. There was so much potential for his magic, but the people in his hometown weren’t used to this sort of thing. They liked the traditional practices, but he was sure that once he found his new town he could convince them it was useful.
. Warm like caramel, and twinkling behind the frames of a pair of glasses that just seemed to highlight his quick wit.
“It’s too much for them. Omegas need a nice clear path. Giving them options just confuses the poor things.”
“We’re not buying her a mattress, this one’s fine,” Pops said, interjecting smoothly. Then he paused, frowning. “But if you do get bitten, let us know, I’ll get one delivered.”
He opened his mouth to call out for Steve before remembering. Steve wasn’t here. He was on patrol. And Tony had no idea when he’d be back.
He carried on, holding Peter close. Steve would come back, Peter would be fine, and they’d be a family just like always.
The doe nodded, and Stíofán gave a strong thrust just to hear him moan. Stíofán reached down to push at Antonius’ knees to widen his stance and let him deeper. It was a stretch - Antonius was smaller than him, making it a strain to spread around Stíofán’s hips, and Stíofán liked it, the feeling of power that came with it.
Steve nodded, feeling a little numb as a hundred and one thoughts filled his head. “Right, ok, Peter’s- Fuck,” he burst out, feeling the guilt building. He’d taken off chasing bandits while his pup was sick, and his omega had had to deal with it all on his lonesome “I need to-”
“For someone unfamiliar with it, you give the air of someone so practiced, it is as natural as breathing,” Mr Rogers said, his voice a low rumble, and Tony stepped closer to better hear it, the sound pleasing to his ear.
He flicked through the notes, eyes scanning over the damage being done. He’d have to wait till he was on the ground to really come up with a strategy.
Steve grinned as he flopped down onto Tony’s chest. “Yeah well, won’t hear any complaints from me. I got a lot of time to make up for.”
“Great, we really appreciate what you did for Alpine. She’s adapting well to the new leg, I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly given the fitting was only last week.”
The Sheriff flushed. “No. No of course not.” He leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees. “I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you I swear. And I certainly wasn’t taking part in the...upstairs business of the saloon.” He looked at the floor, incredibly embarrassed, and Tony could feel the anger starting to temper a little. “We always have a drink after a manhunt, and I just didn’t think. I’m not, well, I’m not used to being married yet I guess. I forgot that it’s not just me anymore and that there’d be someone waiting at home worrying about me.” He looked up with a shy smile. “I like it. I like that I’m not on my own anymore.”
He noted down all the information he would need and let Mr Barnes know he’d have a Stark Pet Prosthetic™️ for Alpine in a week for fitting, and arranged a time.
Tony looked at the little girl, her dark hair in two loose braids and a chubby fist in her mouth. Her eyes were wide, but she didn’t look scared despite the bustling crowd around them. She took everything in curiously, her dark eyes drawn swiftly to the broom in Tony’s hand.
As he got closer he could see a young red-haired alpha clinging to the man’s hand, ashen white. “Viz!”
He heard the whistle telling him they were pulling into the station and hurriedly washed his face and applied a little of his makeup. Only a little: he just wanted to highlight his features, not seem vain. He repacked all his possessions and stepped back out into the carriage just as the train came to a halt.
Tiberius looked as though he might be ill, and grabbed Rumlow’s sleeve to drag him away. Once they were gone, Stíofán got to work, stroking and tugging the doe’s cock.
Tony fired three missiles in rapid succession, watching as they homed in on their target from different sides. The explosion wasn’t big enough to damage the surrounding buildings, but the shockwave still flattened some of the surrounding cars and shrubbery. Tony winced when he saw Pepper’s brand new Porsche flip over in a smattering of debris. He owed her at least two shoe baskets.
Tony had to work to keep his face blank. He hadn’t told anyone about that. It was still just a prototype, an idle idea of showing up his dad by making it smaller and more useful. But it had worked. He had dreams of presenting it as the new future of green energy, but it wasn’t there yet. And so he hadn’t shared it with anyone, yet Pierce knew about it. That suggested a leak Tony hadn’t seen, but he’d be plugging it as soon as they got out of here.
When he finally let him go, he ran his hands over the omega, checking for any wounds or scrapes. “Are you ok?”
Tony, he concluded, would make a good mate, if one were inclined. Unlike S’Teve. S’Teve knew too well he did not conform enough to either half of his heritage. His light blond colouring and bulky form were strange for a Vulcan, while his ears and severe eyebrows were too daunting for a human. And though aesthetics were, of course, the least important trait for a Vulcan to consider, he knew they held great weight for humans.
This was bad. Or it could be fine. People got fevers, children especially. So it might be nothing. Or it might be very bad and Peter was very sick.
“Yeah, but you know what? It’s not so bad. When I was getting better, I got lots of stories, and I got to eat pie and custard for dinner for being so brave.”
He opened it a few inches, leaning out to talk in a low murmur to who was there, but keeping Tony from view. Tony watched the tense line of his back, trying to get any clue of what was being said. When the door closed, Steve’s shoulders slumped, and for a moment, Tony couldn’t breathe.
“Thanks Bruce,” he told the Alpha, who didn’t look like he’d had much sleep if the bags under his eyes were anything to go by. “Really, I don’t know how to repay you.”
.” Steve’s face was decidedly more red now even though he still stubbornly avoided looking at Tony. “So you can stop blaming Nat, okay? It was my own fault that I -”
Pushing open the door to the Sheriff’s office, he stopped at the sight of Carol sitting at the chair across from Steve at his desk. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.”
Well shit. Alright, plan B. He lifted his broom like a club and ran at them giving them no time to react. He swung it, hitting Hodges in the face, making him drop Rogers to the ground. Before he could retaliate, Tony thrust the other end of the broom at one of the others, the handle striking hard against his stomach and making him grunt. Then Tony took off running.
Tony only had a second to see the spire on the town hall and pulled up sharply as it passed between them, Steve sliding over the roof as he was dragged over it. Tony gave a thought to his poor skin but could do nothing until he was free of the building.
when we’re at dinners or at the dances in town. They make me feel...dirty.” Tony sighed.  “I don’t know. I don’t think they’ve decided on anyone yet, but my Dame’s been dropping hints. And every time she does I feel the noose tighten a little more around my neck.”  Tony stopped packing his carpet bag, fingers stilling on the waistcoat he was folding. “I really need your support on this.”
“Yes, he--oh! That’s right! Didn’t I hear you do a little science yourself? Old Mr Lee was singing your praises, said you used a magic potion to burn through the cart and saved Mr Maximoff’s life. Magic potion I found a bit far fetched – an acid I assume?”
He almost wasn’t, but an unexpected detour sent him down a side street of well kept houses and tidy lawns, just in time to catch someone cursing loudly, his head swinging around to see it.
“You're the worst kind of bully, and I gotta tell you, Hodge, there is nothing in the world I hate more than an alpha who uses his strength to hurt others. This is my final warning.”
So when he had finished going through their maths lesson this morning, he’d slipped away for a moment of peace and reflection, walking along the wilds on the estate. He did love it here.
There was shifting beneath the covers, and the Sheriff tossed his linen undergarments over his shoulder and onto the floor.
“I see.” Tony walked over, perching on the desk in front of Steve’s chair. “How much did you like it?”
“Tell you what,” Tony offered, and he pointed to the pile. “You let me give you a ride home so you don’t have to carry all that junk on the subway, and in return I’ll eat dinner with you.”
He took off down the street, looking for somewhere to eat, before he spotted a bakery. It was cute, fresh bread in the window and an array of fancy pastries and cakes that had Tony’s mouth-watering. “Let’s try in there.”
Antonius tried to shake his head, whining, but Stíofán held his head in place. “Let me hear it. Bleat!”
Tony replayed what he said and flushed so hard he felt dizzy. “That wasn’t innuendo!!! He just has a workshop I can use to build a new one.”
The man was across the room in a flash, and Tony found himself thrown free. He watched in awe as the man in blue lift the henchman off his feet and into the air. The guy was so strong for being so slight. He couldn’t be any taller than Steve, but he was lifting nearly two hundred pounds without breaking a sweat.
“This century has done you dirty.” Bucky shook his head, patting Steve on the back as he passed him on his way out the door. “Come on. I’m sure Tony has some high-end equipment around here somewhere.”
He’d been making his way through some design specs when Pepper had come in, looking annoyed. “Tony.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t stop himself from smiling. “You think one of your deputies might be able to watch the office for the rest of the afternoon, so we might--” he cleared his throat pointedly, “--celebrate?”
They rounded up the partygoers, piling them all into one part of the room, and several guards were put in place. The rumble of fear from his employees was quickly shut down by a barked order, and they stood quietly waiting for what would happen next.
Suddenly Stíofán wanted the interlopers gone. Seeing him stake a claim was one thing, but seeing Tony fall apart was just for him.
The Sheriff was stiff beneath him, but Tony didn’t falter. Instead, he peeled back the fabric so he could gently rub the cloth over the skin, cooling it and cleaning away the dried sweat.
Steve snorted and leaned up to give him a peck. “I’ll do my best. But in the meantime, I hope you’re ready for hotdogs at Nathan’s and a romantic walk along the boardwalk.”
“Okay, how does a guy who can do a perfect backflip off a bus without breaking a sweat manage to look like he’s never even heard of the word ‘graceful’?”
“Yeah, he’s always talking about what’ll happen when he meets them. Doesn’t take well to people making fun of it.”
He dressed in his plainest things, pulling on his heeled boots and using a rag to hold his curls from his face as he’d seen in a magazine advertisement once.
Then the man was kissing him, and Tony nearly pinwheeled back to get clear. He may not have been in a relationship at the moment, but he was not ready for
She gave him a curious look, but ever the professional, a smile spread over her face as she shook Steve’s hand, promised to send over the paperwork, and disappeared down the hall.
A horrible, salty flavour rolled across his tongue, so strong he couldn’t taste anything else. He picked another piece, hoping it was bad luck, but when the same awful flavour flooded his tongue, he couldn’t deny it any longer.
He stepped back. “We need to celebrate.” He grabbed his keys off the counter. “How about you guys take the truck and go grab us a pizza, or something from Sam’s? Go and tell Nana on your way home and bring her over, she won’t want to miss it.”
“No.” Carol’s face dropped. “Oh my god, why don’t you just call her? Seriously, your pining is driving us all crazy.”
Tony felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. He was no stranger to being gossiped about, or his looks being targeted – that was New York society’s bread and butter after all – but the shots at how he wasn’t caring for Steve hurt. He was doing his best, but it was awful to realise other people had noticed.
“Since we can definitely blame the life or death experience I just had if this goes wrong, I’m just going to say it.” He looked up at Steve, his face so close from where Tony was cradled against his chest. “Do you want to go get dinner with me? Like romantically?”
Tony pursed his lips, “Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow,” Steve frowned as Tony finally turned to look at him, “What’s your thing, pilates?”
Director Fury nodded, “I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the cube, and I’d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys,”
Loki also seemed to have tensed somewhat at the sudden storm. Steve directed his irritation at their captive, “What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightning?”
The dense clouds grew steadily darker as Agent Romanoff flew them back to a S.H.I.E.L.D base. Director Fury sounded impatient as he ordered Agent Romanoff to get Loki to him fast.
Tony leaned into the kiss with a groan, dropping the marker on the floor in favor of pushing his hands into Steve’s thick blond hair.
There was moment of silence between them before Steve sighed and shook his head, “They never should have taken the damn thing out of the ocean,”
Steve sighed, “Loki’s going to drag this out,” He glanced up at the Asgardian who was still staring into nothing, “So, Thor, what’s his play?”
Tony strode back to his room to take a shower and wash the flight off him. Dr. Banner would make this trip bearable, at least. Despite his self-imposed loneliness, the man was itching for
“Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny,” Steve all but snarled, before remembering Bruce, “No offence, Doc,”
Loki flung him sideways for another bone-shattering collision with the hard paving stones of the square when music suddenly blared out of the plane hovering, somewhat unbalanced, in the sky behind them. Steve turned to stare at the plane that was currently lurching to one side when he caught sight of a glowing object zooming towards them.
Steve remembered the blast from Loki’s sceptre, “I would start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon,”
Tony wobbled the screwdriver in his hand incessantly before pointing with it, “You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut,”
Steve’s gut lurched and he crouched down with his shield over his head without a second to spare. Thor brought the hammer down on his shield and Steve sent his eternal thanks to Howard for wasting all the world’s vibranium on one piece of armoury. Where the hammer and shield connected, an implosion of light flew out in a shockwave, felling every tree within a mile radius.
Agent Romanoff added, “Loki had him under some kind of spell,” She pursed her lips, “Along with one of ours,”
Steve interrupted the fight as best he could. He threw his shield between the Asgardian and Tony, forcing their attention to where he stood on top of a fallen tree.
Loki huddled on the steps to the gala, holding his side. Steve walked over, picking up his shield on the way. Loki rippled with golden light as his clothes morphed and he raised his hands in defeat. Steve had the distinct feeling S.H.I.E.L.D  was in over his head.
Bruce laughed lightly, “It’s alright, I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things,”
Bruce stepped in, “He would have to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier,”
Steve pressed his lips together. He tried to memorise the list before asking hesitantly, “Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?”
Tony folded his arms and gave Steve an appraising look, “There’s something you think S.H.I.E.L.D’s not getting quite right, isn’t there?”
“Hey! That’s enough.” Steve could hear the slight tremor in his own voice as he gazed at the bulk of the unfamiliar figure. Steve jumped down to where they stood, attempting diplomacy, “Now, I don’t know what you plan on doing here-“
and Tony intended to offer him a job as soon as possible. Tony huffed at Banner’s unexercised genius as he unlocked his door and took in his assigned room. It held a bed and table, and some lucky SHIELD agent had lugged a whiteboard in, presumably on Coulson’s recommendation. They wanted him working so he wasn’t turning his attention to their many well-kept secrets.
Tony let go of his shoulder, and S’Teve missed the clarity it provided him, of what Tony was feeling. Then Tony reached out, curling in his thumb and the back two fingers, leaving the index and middle extended.
“If you change your mind, I’d pay a fair price,” he heard yelled to him as he turned the corner. “Think about it, we all know you’ve been saving.”
“No, you came here so you could say you met Captain America, and you have. Turns out I just don’t like your opinions much.”
“Sounds good.” He could Rhodey in the background, confirming an officer would be with them soon, and felt the tension in his muscles relax.
“Uhhhh,” Steve said, suddenly looking like he was facing a firing squad. Tony hid a smile behind his hand. “They uhhh…”
Tony shook his head, the shock still fading. “No! I just meant to give it a little boost, it’s just meant to-“ he stopped, the realisation sweeping over him. And then he began to laugh. “Oh my god.”
Jarvis hopped up onto his shoulder, and Tony straddled the broom begging it to behave. “Thank you, everyone. See you in a year!”
“Yeah, I'm fine, just got a little excited there for a second,” the doe said, looking embarrassed. Stíofán grabbed the small pitcher of wine and offered it to him, watching with interest the way his throat moved as he drank.
It all happened in slow motion, Steve smiled back at him, and then the table jolted as the man knocked against it and the coffee slipped from his hand and splashed onto the table in a wave as it spanned the small table and dripped into Tony’s lap.
Eventually the Sheriff pushed him onto his back and settled over him. He still looked a little unsure, but he dipped down, brushing his lips over Tony’s bonding gland and making him shiver at the sensation.
“Please,” Tony said, letting a little of his earlier worry seep in. “I was sure something worse had befallen you, and I admit it left me quite shaken.”
Rhodey laughed as they closed the door. “Holy shit. I think we sold double the day’s usual takings. Trust me when I say you don’t have to worry about paying any kind of board.”
“Ba-ah-ah-ahhhhhhhh!” Tony howled, each thrust seeming to knock the air out of him. Stíofán forced him onto the tip of his hooves, liking the way it held him in place.
“Now that that’s taken care of,” the alpha said, nodding at the dancers who were just finishing up. “Maybe I could take you for a spin?”
Stíofán stared up at him. He was so beautiful. Those eyes, his well-kept beard far more fetching than Stíofán’s, the cute horns that poked out from the unruly curls on his head. And, as Stíofán’s hands held his hips, the just noticeable bump that held their future inside it.
Tony flushed behind his mug, looking around the room. His eyes caught on the clock and snapped wide. “Is that the time?”
Agreeing to sign up to this blind date service was meant to be a chance at something new, not an opportunity for the universe to dig up his past and tear his heart out in the middle of a moderately priced Manhattan restaurant.
Tony blinked a few times before taking a breath to speak, but Steve beat him to it, “It’s just, I got a little lost back there, and I don’t know if half the stuff I got told, you know, before-“ He peered down the hall, “I don’t even know if any of the stuff I was told about that thing before is anywhere near the truth,” Steve still hadn’t moved his hands off of his hips; Tony catalogued that as a nervous tick, “But it’s not a problem, don’t worry about-“
Slowly, Tony reached down and brought Steve back. He kissed him deeply, running his hands over Steve’s torso. Steve shivered and Tony smirked slightly before leaning in to kiss Steve’s throat. Steve gasped harshly as Tony bit down before wetly kissing the bruise he’d made. Steve shuddered, only encouraging Tony to do it again and again.
“Yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!” Tony chipped in, and that seemed to tip the balance out of their favour in Thor’s mind.
Bruce shook his head, “I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him,”
Steve was breathing harder than he would have liked but he refused to let Loki turn his power on the civilians still crowding the area. He grabbed the sceptre, and snarled,
Tony rubbed a towel over his hair and got dressed. He had to hand it to Howard, good ol’ Cap was a pretty perfect soldier; he looked the part and acted accordingly, following orders and not asking too many questions. Entirely focused on the mission. No wonder Fury wanted him around; finally, a force who would counteract Tony’s difficult personality.
Steve growled almost involuntarily. He made to stand and make his presence known, but an elderly gentleman rose before he had lifted his bent knee even an inch off of the hard ground. He spoke haltingly in a thick German accent,
“I put in requests with every agent we could and apparently she somehow heard about it, and she loves cats, and since she’s doing shows here this week she agreed to swing by!”
“Yeah well,” Steve took the shot she passed his way. “Hodge was getting trigger happy. I could see it, and he’d already had a few drinks. Easier just to let him have his way. I didn’t want him shooting off and hitting someone by mistake, especially not with Tony so close to him.” He looked at Tony. “Sorry, sweetheart. I hate that you went through that, whether it was an act or not. It wasn’t about you really, he’s had it in for me since I was made Sheriff over him. But don’t worry, I‘ll have Buck teach him what real humiliation is.”
Tony cursed that they hadn’t  just held the event at the tower. They never would’ve gotten past JARVIS.
“Not like you,” Steve answered, almost reverent, and he reached out tracing a gentle touch over the scars on Tony’s chest, and Tony’s breath caught. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him, pushing him backwards until he was resting on Steve’s chest. He tilted his head, pressing their foreheads together and smiling down at Steve.
“But I can’t stop now,” Tony protested, almost dropping his glass. “I’m finally starting to build up clients!”
She pointed and Tony saw a tall, blond hottie, who definitely looked like he knew his way around a gym just as well as a paintbrush. He was wearing a nice suit - cheap though, Tony could tell - and clinging to a napkin of hors d'oeuvres like his life depended on it. Seemed like he enjoyed networking just as much as Tony did.
“Come on,” Bruce said gently, tugging his blanket tighter around himself. “Let’s meet him at the hospital.”
“It’s fine, he’s a cute kid.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck looking a little awkward. “Uhh, if you’re still wanting to get him used to dogs, Dodger and I come here the same time most days, I’d be happy to let them hang out again no problem.”
Steve bit his lip, and Tony already knew what he was going to say. “I’m really sorry Tony. I’m going to be-”
This was common for games, a last meal in case of a fatality the next day. There was plenty of food and wine, and there were instruments provided for music.
Tony blinked. He really hadn’t. He’d sort of stopped thinking about it since he and Steve had had their talk, and he’d been pouring all his attention onto Peter. “No, I admit, I’d sort of lost hope of another pup.”
Rhodey came by the next morning to check on him, dismayed at his broom and checking him over for more serious injuries. Tony accepted the attention, refusing to acknowledge that it felt nice to have someone fussing over him.
“I have to go!”He didn’t wait for a response before he was out the door, sprinting towards Steve’s house. He had to be in pain, he was sure of it, because he wasn’t fit, but he didn’t even notice, slamming into the workshop and grabbing the still unfinished broom off the workbench.
“Gods you are incorrigible,” Tony said, slapping his pec with a laugh. “But joking aside, yes I would like my next carrying to be easier. Less fear, less stress. More lying here like this with you while you rub my back. We’ve earned it, my love.”
Tony flew closer, only to pull up short when a laser burst struck the front of the suit. “Hey! Watch it, you radioshack rejects! Planty is in there!”
“Oh fuck!” Stíofán slammed the door behind him, rushing over to check the faun’s pulse. “Fuck, fuck, he’s dead, he’s--”
Stíofán nodded. “Yes. I know we can’t be married, not by Rome’s law, but I think of us that way. I’d like for us to be like that.” He felt a little embarrassed now. “I know I said some things when we were coupling, but that’s just talk in the moment. I’d like to get to know you too.”
“Hey!” Tony complained. “He is right here, and doesn’t like being spoken about like he’s not.” Steve looked down at him, the adrenalin starting to wane and leaving just relief and affection in its wake.
A tentative grin spread over the Sheriff’s face, and Tony smiled in return. They finished their breakfast in comfortable silence, and Tony thought that maybe not all was lost after all.
“Right,” Tony agreed. “And you performed first aid, and once I was stable, I told you to go and get help. They were closing in, and no one on
“Steve!” he called, and Steve turned to see him, a big cut across his cheek.Tony hurried over to him, running his fingers gently over the heated skin. “Holy shit, what happened?”
Stíofán put his hands on his hips. “I’m not sure you should start messing with hot melted metal when you’re carrying.”
As he snuck a glance back, he could see Rogers getting smaller and smaller as he rose, his face lit with awe.
“Sorry J.” Tony leaned down, grabbing the small black cat in his arms. “I think we’re all set. Let’s head downstairs: everyone’s waiting.”
“I’ve sent a letter, so he should know before I arrive. But any reply will come after I’m gone. Jarvis will intercept it so my parents don’t see, but I have to hope he’s happy to see me.”
“Anthony,” The Sheriff said with a kind smile. “It really is fine. Seems like you’ve been busy all day. No reason I can’t help out.”
She dipped a fry into her ketchup. “I feel sort of bad for springing it on them. But, I’m not sure I could’ve dealt with this longer than we had to.”
“Where did it come from?” Tony asked, taking the carrier and looking inside. A familiar pair of blue eyes peeked out from amongst white fur, and underneath a fuzzy tail, he could see the glint of a red Stark prosthetic. “Alpine!”
When Steve tried to pay, Tony had caught the barista’s eye, winking so she’d know to charge it to the corporate account -a trick they used when Tony was flying under the radar -and they’d made their way back down to the 58th floor. Steve looked around. “So, I better get back to my meeting. Sorry again.”
He’d discovered it by accident too. He’d been in the workshop alone, Steve having stepped out to deliver lunch to his Ma while she was working at the hospital. Tony had been working on a particularly tricky part of the broom, and he’d needed a tool he didn’t have. Assuming Steve might have one stored away, he’d gone through the drawers. When he opened the bottom one, he was surprised to see his own face looking up at him.
. “I’m sure we can keep you entertained. Perhaps...perhaps I could send for your soldier. I’m sure he’ll be worried when he hears the object of his affection took a tumble.” There, that was not so difficult. It almost felt like a relief to say it. Even if relief felt oddly similar to a knife across his skin.
