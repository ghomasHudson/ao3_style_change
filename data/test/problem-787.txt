"I don't really know how to communicate Draco, how to share those kinds of feelings. I wish I did, I wish I could take this all back, turn back time and never have this happen. I wish we could go back to the days when we'd sneak out and curl up in the Astronomy Tower to watch the stars. I miss everything we had Draco; I miss it so much it hurts." Tears began to stream down his cheeks as he finally gave in to the emotions that had been swarming him for days. He didn't know how to cope with everything, and he his family hadn't exactly taught him ho to discuss his thoughts and feelings before. Instead, he suffered in silence and lashed out, it was all he knew. The guilt and the pain at losing the most important person in his life had been overwhelming, he'd never faced a pain like it before and didn't know what to do. He wished that he had a time turner and could take him back to the evening where he ruined everything and stop himself.
At times it felt dirty, as if they were doing something risky and wrong. It took a while to realise that they weren't doing anything wrong, it was the burdens they both were forced to shoulder that were wrong. Society and its views were what was wrong and immoral, there was nothing wrong with them loving one another. It was the constant knowledge that they were hiding their love for one another behind the backs of those they loved and trusted that hurt the most. Knowing that they could never confide in even those who they trusted so deeply, because who knew what was lurking in the shadows, laying in weight to hunt down their secrets and devour them.
"Somebody bloody did, so can you either get me out or get someone else who can!" Harry reached the end of his tether, as helpful as he knew Draco was trying to be, clearly nothing was working, and they needed some additional help (preferably from a very capable adult).
~Saturday~
"I will not curse my husband, I will not curse my husband!" He muttered under his breath, moving towards the trunks that had been discarded at the bottom of the staircase. Quickly casting a feather-light charm, Regulus directed the trunks towards the fireplace, intending on them flooing to London as quickly as possible.
Harry couldn't help it as his eyes widened with pure shock, unable to comprehend the sight he was seeing. Multiple little white mice had burst out from within the freshly pulled crackers at the dinner table. Scuttling across the table and down onto the floor, the small rodents were quick to attempt their escape from the Great Hall. It was all so overwhelming, Harry had never expected the animals to be hidden within the inconspicuous cracker, nor had he expected the full size Wizarding chess board and the elaborate pirates hat (complete with an extravagant peacock feather tucked within the brim).
"I know Draco. I know I fucked up, okay, I was fucking scared and I took it out on you. All of the pressure of everyone's expectations just pushed me down and I didn't know what to do anymore," the frustration was clear in Harry's voice, he didn't want to take anything out on Draco, knowing that he had caused this, but at the same time he needed him to listen and understand what had caused this. He had listened to everyone's expectations of what the Chosen One should be, the kind of life he should live, and Harry felt like he couldn't breathe, he couldn't even be Harry anymore. Nothing he did was good enough when it came to the Wizarding World, and he was sick of it. He felt like a puppet that everyone but him could control, and in his revolt, he took the one thing he had that he controlled, that he was able to create the rules for, and threw it away along with everything else that controlled him. It had been a mistake, but at the time all Harry wanted was to be free of all constraints.
Draco had a more refined, yet varied palette, having travelled extensively as a child to a remarkable number of tropical destinations. He had experienced cuisines from across the globe, and wanted to share the flavours and tastes of different cultures. Harry however was scared of trying new things, fearful that he wouldn't like any spices or produce that wasn't native to England, something that irritated Draco beyond belief. What was life without experiencing new things, you couldn't stay contained within the small box of what you were comfortable with, there was no excitement.
Inside was a box, with a raise of a pale eyebrow, Draco lifted it and tucked it underneath, pushing away at the sheets of gold tissue paper to reveal the gift itself. It was clear that Draco didn't expect such a gift, the soft and woolen cashmere jumper, in a vibrant shade of olive that Harry was sure would compliment his bright eyes and pale skin.
"This is disgusting Draco!" He moaned quietly under his breath, dreading Snape's reaction if he heard him complaining about the tasks set. Ever since they had been paired together at the start of the year, they had grown close to one another. Finally reaching the point where out of frustration, Draco kissed the oblivious Harry and they had been quietly dating ever since.
"Just stir the potion three times, in a clockwise direction this time while I finish prepping and you'll be fine," Draco reassured him, wiping some kind of gunk from his knife as he began to slice into a liver he produced from nowhere. Harry couldn't help but to gag, as much as he loved Hogwarts and all aspects of Magical schooling, there were some things that he struggled to adjust to, and the variety of disgusting and gruesome ingredients was definitely one of them.
Drabble Prompt - Day 9) Throw
~Friday~
"I know, I know, I just wish you would take care of yourself a little better. I need to go now, I just wanted to pop in and check on you and your fancy ball before I headed off for the weekend," they shared a gentle kiss before Harry reached for his suitcase by his feet. He hated having to leave Draco alone for the weekend, but he knew that it wasn't possible for him to cancel such an important work meeting, sometimes being the Head Auror at the Ministry was not all it was cracked up to be.
"Mhmm, you never gave me your name by the way," it came out of nowhere, the swift change in conversation that Draco had not been anticipating. "After saving you twice already, you'd have thought I'd have got your name by now.."
It had taken little research to realise that by refusing to shake Malfoy's hand, Harry had somehow managed to confirm (or instigate, that section of understanding was rather vague) a feud between the two families. It had definitely put Malfoy's behaviour into perspective, not that it absolved him of the way he treated others, but it definitely explained it (at least a little bit). Harry didn't have the time, or the energy, to keep up a running feud, and so had decided to send a gift as a way of attempting to bridge the growing gap between them. Nobody could say that he wasn't a trier.
"No, the crystal tumblers are the only glassware that will be used, I refuse to place subpar crockery on these tables. Do you know how long I spent decorating? Do you?" Draco's voice reached Harry as he glided across the ballroom floor towards him, speaking to the assistant at his side who was hurriedly scribbling away at a piece of parchment in her hands, clearly filled with numerous notations on everything that needed to be changed before the guests arrived that evening.
"Alright, but this better not be a joke," the warning was clear in his voice, and yet the undertone of excitement was still vividly clear and Harry knew that Draco was intrigued by the gift. He supposed it was completely abstract and unexpected of him, especially seeing as they hated each other the majority of the time. Harry stayed silent, watching as Draco unravelled the rather messy bow and peeled back the wrapping paper.
"I didn't know about the whole feud thing when I refused to shake your hand, I just thought you were being a snob. I apologise for those actions, and really would like to end that feud and try to work towards being civil with one another," Harry was earnest in his explanation, hoping that Draco would take it well and understand that Harry had not meant for things to turn out the way they did.
Draco strolled out of the bar door, phone in hand as he prepared for the ten minute wait on his taxi. The biting cold was unexpected, yet not completely unwelcome after the sweltering heat of the bar he'd been stuck inside for hours. He had finished a little earlier than usual, so the wait time was longer than he had anticipated, and with no coat or jacket, he found himself huddled against the wall to stay as warm as possible.
"This is going to be a good year Harry, I can feel it," Draco clutched his hand tighter as the pair shared a grin, knowing that this would be the best year at Hogwarts possible, and they would be doing it together.
"I've missed you too sweetheart, how have you been, you look very busy and rushed off your feet," it had not escaped Harry that his husband seemed to be exhausted, a sign that he had once again barely slept while prepping and fussing over every last detail.
"They were different types of chicken Draco! You said you wanted a roast too, so I don't see why you're complaining," Harry had reached the point of whining, he wasn't ashamed to admit that he just couldn't be bothered to deal with the argument anymore, even if they did need to desperately go food shopping. He tried to put the image of barren cupboards to the back of mind, unwilling to give in because it was hard.
"Yes it does have to be fish. You agreed to eat something I chose and I'm choosing salmon," with a final furrow of the brows and squint of the eyes, Draco made his way out of the house, leaving Harry to follow behind him. He couldn't help but to let out one final sigh of frustration, realising that compromising, even just once, was going to be painful.
~oOo~
"Oh really?" He questioned, a wry smirk upon his face as he gazed at the man leaning against the wall next to him.
Drabble Prompt - Day 7) fancy
"Well, I don't want to disrupt your mystery then, but I would love to know who you are one day," his attempt at flirty clearly went amiss, as the stranger frowned slightly, closing up at the thought of Draco knowing just who he was in real life. It startled Draco to see such a swift change in emotions, and he couldn't help but to wonder if he was missing something important. Opening his mouth to probe further, he was interrupted by the loud beeping of a horn, his taxi had arrived.
Draco clung to the vials of memories, the wisps of happiness that were ever fading in reality. He spent more time within the pensieve then he did in real life, struggling to cope with the loss that had sent him spiraling out of control. It had been so long, and yet the pain never seemed to fade. The memories were all he could rely upon until he finally joined Harry once again, and this time, for the last time.
"Textbooks? You study?" He asked Draco, intrigued.
They had decided to go for a calming fly around the Quidditch pitch, lazily playing catch and release with the snitch Draco had been given the previous Christmas by his parents. Mainly, they just wanted to spend some time together away from the constantly watching eyes of their fellow students.
"Hello darling, I've missed you so much," placing a smacking kiss upon Harry's cheek Draco felt himself relax for the first time that day, allowing Harry to gently massage his tense shoulders in an attempt to alleviate some pain.
"I'm honestly exhausted Harry, I'm so hungry and I haven't eaten since yesterday evening. Plus, everything seems to be going wrong! The caterers sent the wrong crockery and glassware, the entertainment was double booked so we still have to find someone and-" before he could rattle off a whole slew of things that he needed to fix, Harry reached over and stuffed one of the little appetizers into his husband's mouth.
"Reg hun, calm down, we're not going to be late I promise you! It's only 9:30 now, the train doesn't leave until 11, there's plenty of time," James gently massaged his shoulders, attempting to relieve the stress Regulus was feeling. Realising how distracted the pair were, Harry slipped out of the foyer and headed off to find his boyfriend, intent on making the most of their last few moments together before they returned to Hogwarts.
He could no longer tell who his real friends were, and who was just there for the money and the lavish parties. His family did not condone the excessive drinking and the new attitude he had taken on, pushing him away and separating themselves from the new Draco. They said that he wasn't the son they had once known, that he wasn't the Draco they had raised and loved. Harry was slowly pulling away, that was the one that hurt the most. Watching as the one person who had never faulted in his belief that Draco was meant for amazing things, never stopped believing in him as a person, seemed to be slipping through his fingers.
“Harry,” is Draco’s breathy reply.
Draco stopped walking. “Merlin,” he said, peering down his nose at the dog. Its tail was perked high and mighty, its paws covered with spongy dirt from the wet, mulchy ground. “You can go on home, now. I have some business to attend to that, unfortunately, doesn’t involve any stick-throwing.”
“This round’s on me,” he announced loudly, chest puffed out, and there was a small chorus of ‘thank you’s as he resituated himself in the booth next to Pansy, squishing Draco even more against the wall. In compensation, Theo slid him a tall glass of... something. “They told me it was the house favorite. Not exactly sure what it is, but the cherries reminded me of you.”
“Thank you for having me,” Draco said, because he was better at this. “It was certainly… an experience.”
dungarees, thank you very much.”
“What’s going on here?” Harry asked innocently, flicking off the faucet.
“I see her,” Draco said, feeling wild and terrified for what was about to transpire. He’d been joking earlier about hexes being flung, but now it didn’t seem so funny. Then, from behind Draco, the dog darted through his legs and began streaking towards Lovegood, ears flapping and tail swishing impossibly fast. He watched Lovegood’s face light up at the sight of the dog, bending her knees as it came barreling into her arms. She was distracted for a long moment, smiling and cooing something unintelligible to the excited animal, but then—as if it was inevitable—she raised her head and looked directly at Draco, gaze piercing and blue.
“She’ll come back before lunch like she’s been doing every single day, or have you not noticed?”
“What sort of dignity?” he prodded, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. Malfoy looked at him sourly, shifting in his seat, and Harry felt a strange tingle of triumph in knowing that he was uncomfortable sitting in Harry’s favorite chair.
And, well, he couldn’t argue with that.
Something sparked in Draco’s gaze, like maybe he’d been waiting to hear those words for a long time but never expected them to come. “Anytime,” he replied, nearly a murmur, and Harry didn’t register how close they were until he felt Draco’s breath on his nose and eyelashes. They were unusually close, actually, half separated by the door, faces mere inches apart.
So, in short, things were going great.
“Hey,” Draco said, his surprise showing. “Have you been dancing, too?”
“See, those are the kinds of questions you could ask if we invited them for dinner.”
A minute passed, and Harry set his mug down. He was going next door.
Luna considered for a moment, setting her magazine face down on her lap, then said firmly, “Yes.”
“No, it’s not?”
“Which really means having us figure it out for you,” Hermione finished for him, her smile stretching.
The corners of Hermione’s lips quirked, and she pulled her hand off his shoulder to display it in full, spreading her fingers out. Sure enough, a silver-studded band on her ring finger glinted gold under the orange street lights. Harry’s breath hitched.
Without much else left to do, he turned in his place and sat roughly against the second-to-last step of the stairs, heels digging into the mud and rain spattering his ankles. The wood porch covering stuck out just far enough to prevent the rest of him from getting wet, but the cold was harsh enough as it was. “Fucking Malfoy,” Harry muttered under his breath as he pulled his jacket tighter around himself, curving his shoulders and battening down his hatches like a ship in the midst of a raging storm.
“I just want to give them a chance,” she’d insisted, her round, lovely eyes pleading and blue, and Harry couldn’t say no to her. He wasn’t heartless.
Hermione’s eyebrows cinched disbelievingly. “That doesn’t seem right at all. How would you even find him if it’s only one guy?”
Theo was shamelessly close now, but this time it was obviously on purpose. His hand fell to the jut of Draco’s hip. “Here, bathroom, outside. I don’t care.” His head tilted, mouth suddenly brushing the shell of Draco’s ear. “Whatever you want. Only if you want.”
Draco continued to stare, the tips of his ears turning red, and Harry wondered bitterly if the rest of the evening was going to be like this. If it was, he didn’t think he’d survive the whole thing; Luna and Neville would have to come and scrape his exploded remains off the walls.
“Everything alright?” Neville asked from somewhere across the sanded plywood, voice light with amusement.
“Oh, right,” Neville replied through a yawn. There was a plate of partially-eaten apple tart sitting in front of him. “I think I saw her pass through here a few minutes ago. She went through the flappy thing.” He waved his hand at the rubber dog-flap built into the back door.
Luna met his flaming gaze with her signature calmness, hands clasped in front of her like some sort of school teacher. “Yes,” she said, “I did. I wanted to thank them for bringing Phoebe back.”
Malfoy didn’t look away.
“More or less, yeah.” A plastic straw stuck out of the side of Potter’s mouth as he spoke, half slurping at something bright pink that looked more like an energy drink than it did alcohol.
“You’ll eat some later to make him feel better?”
Draco looked down at his cards, but couldn’t quite process what was on them given that Potter’s eyes were now pinned to him, burning invisible holes into the fabric of his jumper. “Um,” he said, blinking hard. “Pass?”
“Yeah,” Theo said grimly, spinning in place and scanning the perimeter of the yard like Draco had done two seconds ago. “That’s what that weird icy feeling was. Greg felt it, too.”
“What for?” Pansy asked disbelievingly, face lit up with a mix of delight and enmity, like she couldn’t decide which one was more fitting.
A lot to digest there right?!
So I know it's been ages since my last update and to all those who have been waiting patiently thank you, but also I'm sorry!
He lifted his eyes and found Draco staring straight into his own eyes for some reason and he didn’t even blink as he drank. Then a soft satisfied smile danced through those silverly eyes and settled on his lips as he pulled the glass away.
Draco, Narcissa and Lucius get taken to a safe house to await their trials as the Ministry have an awful lot to sort out and they're not quite sure what to do with them yet.
“That’s great Harry.” Fred said with a smile.
Harry’s face was beautifully flushed and his hair was indescribably messy. Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
“Yes, I rather think I shall.” he said tucking into the pastry.
Everyone turned to look at him but he kept his focus on Harry. “These must be really powerful locks right? It’s pretty complicated magic to ward the whole room like that and for us not to be able to get in?”
Will Harry take in him do you think?!
“I’ve never thought of it like that before.” Draco said slowly. “Lucius can’t ever know that you’re helping me though or the twins. You’re the last person he would ever think I would turn to for help. He knows that I’m friends with Blaise and is probably aware now that Daphne works for me if mothers has informed him but having people in my corner who he wouldn’t expect is definitely a good thing. He might be watching me, I’m not sure, but we can’t ever be seen together just in case. I don’t want you to think that I don’t want to be here, I have no problem with living with you but I have to confess that the added security you have on your house helped persuade me.”
“Erm, you can call me Harry.” Harry said slightly awkwardly as Draco ended the brief handshake.
“Oh? Marriage doesn’t interest you then Blaise?” Harry said he was genuinely interested.
“Mr. Malfoy had the opportunity then to hand us all, myself included, over to Voldemort. He could have brought back honour to his family name in the eyes of their master, he could have taken the direction of the war in a very different way so easily but he didn’t. He lied to his father and to Bellatrix, the real Death Eaters and said he couldn’t be sure it was me, that it was us. This allowed me and my friends time to escape. In that moment, he made a decision about what side he was on. He stopped me from being handed to Voldemort. That there is your proof of where Draco Malfoy really stood in this war.”
Enjoy.
Then it struck him. Of course, that bastard had an invisibility cloak. So it was possible… but if ‘The Saviour’ had been there the whole time then why didn’t he intervene? Say something, do something! The idiot was a man of action who reacted on instinct, this Draco knew. That foolish Gryffindor ‘bravery’ would have kicked in so maybe Potter was making it up, but then why would he do that? Draco was more confused than ever now but his thoughts were once again interrupted by the man leading this trial.
“Oh hey! Erm, two secs, I’m just peeing.” Harry called back from the bathroom area over the sounds of Charlie and the Chocolate factory still playing on the TV.
Nothing seemed amiss at all as they ate their toasted bagels and drank their coffee and having Harry kiss him goodbye as he left for work was nice. It was when he got into the back of the shop at precisely 8:50 that things got slightly more dramatic as he was immediately accosted by Daphne who arrived at the same time… with Blaise.
He made Teddy his favourite snack of cheese cubes and grapes then they talked about why Teddy was sad.
“Hear hear!” Robards agreed enthusiastically as the three of them took their seats.
“Yeah this house was the headquarters for the Order during the war so we had meetings here and then all ate together afterwards. Obviously I wasn’t at all the meetings but yeah we were here a few times and we spent Christmas here that year too.”
“It was actually really good.” I haven’t had a day with just her in… well years to be honest.” Harry said relaxing back into the corner of the sofa. “I had lots of cuddles with Rose of course but she sleeps a lot more than I thought! But that gave us time to chat. Hermione of course wanted to know what I was going to do with my time now.”
felt like fate.
Harry opened his mouth to say “thank you,” then decided that Malfoy didn’t deserve thanks, given that he’d quite literally kidnapped Harry’s dog and then forced him into a basement. So, instead, he just stowed his wand into his back pocket and pushed past Malfoy, barely resisting the urge to roughly shoulder him into the wall and maybe spit on his shoes.
The first month had been the hardest; Draco felt empty and exhausted during the day, but couldn’t fall asleep at night no matter how hard he tried. He could feel his magic running like liquid fire through his veins, begging to be used, burning up his insides—but he refused. They’d ended up spending the whole summer in Cornwall, roaming the oddly constructed neighbourhoods and taking walks down long, tourist-infested strips of beach, trying to ignore the humming of their bones. It was the first summer Draco had ever got sunburned.
“Do you?” Luna’s eyebrows arched curiously. “That’s very kind. Most people from your year don’t remember me all that much.”
“Places,” Draco confirms. “Quiet places. Places with no loud cars or taxis. Places where you can sleep.”
“No,” Harry said, his voice misty. “Not at all. But it also makes the most sense in the world.”
mug—on the table with a small clink. “It’s been in their family for years. They’re just letting us use it, for the time being.”
It was nice, he thought.
“You’ve said before,” Draco says, voice muffled with bleary sleep. “Is that why you’re up?”
“Yes,” Malfoy said quietly, not breaking eye contact. “I know.”
“Harry?” The voice was at the top of the landing now, coming closer.
Draco had never felt more sick in his life. “Can’t we just report the threats? Make them stop?”
“Hermione sent us,” Neville had explained sheepishly. “She thinks you’ve been spending too much time alone, but she didn’t want to pressure you.” He’d then proceeded to hand Harry the largest potted house plant in the history of potted house plants. “Housewarming gift.”
“Yes,” he said to the ceiling.
“Will the couch be open?” she asked after swallowing, swaying slightly as she leaned back against her seat.
Potter looked over as if noticing him for the first time. “Malfoy,” he replied, tilting his chin up.
That’s what these were. Twenty-two years old and Harry was having boy problems. But putting it that way sounded so much cheaper, so much flimsier than he felt they should be. These feelings felt solid and blazing and rooted so deep in his chest it was almost like they’d been there all his life.
“I know what to name our cat.”
But then his wand tugged sharply in his hand, jerking his arm, and he whipped his head up to see Phoebe bounding through the clearing, ears flapping.
“Yes.” He dug his palms into the sockets of his eyes, seeing firecrackers bloom on the back of his eyelids. “It’s really Saturday? Already?”
He’d been out of Azkaban for a year; his parole had just expired, he’d just been given a wand by the Ministry, the Manor had just been seized. His mother had just been admitted to the Janus Thickey Ward at St. Mungo’s for suffering frequent, intense panic attacks. His father had been on his second year out of fifteen in Azkaban.
“Sorry,” Harry apologised monotonously, not meaning it even a little bit. He was burning up in the places where Draco had bumped into him.
She smiled at him good-naturedly. “It only takes a moment to decide you love something, Harry.”
Draco laughs, mild. “No, I’m allergic. We can have a cat, though.”
Draco’s throat tightened. He didn’t want to answer that, feeling suddenly and uncomfortably transparent.
Harry didn’t even know why he was still looking at Malfoy, watching the breeze whip his stupid platinum hair around his stupid pointy face, almost like Luna’s hair had whipped around her face in the car that other day. Except Luna was a better person than Malfoy. Luna was probably the best person Harry knew, and Malfoy wasn’t like her at all. Not even a tiny bit. They were both blonde, but that was it. That was the extent of their alikeness. Everything else came to a screeching halt there.
“No, no we are not,” Parkinson cut in swiftly. “In fact, let’s never do it again. I’d much prefer it that way, thank you.”
“It is.” A pause. “Harry, are you feeling okay? You’re acting funny.”
Except, several hours later when the clock struck 7, his doorbell rang—and Draco Malfoy was standing on his front porch.
But the voice in Draco’s head disagreed.
“Oh,” Ron echoed, jaw unhinging.
“Fine with me,” Pansy approved.
“You just what?”
“It’s just a question,” Ron said stormily, and Harry patted his arm.
Harry reached up and scrubbed his hands down his face, still trying to process what time it was. He tried focusing on her question, but he felt a few steps behind; like he was a computer, lagging and buffering. His brain felt like it was nothing but a little spinning rainbow circle, going round and round, stuck in a loop.  “I—Luna, they weren’t open last time because they were sleeping.”
“Your version is quite literally impossible, but fine. We can grow a wand tree.”
At the mention of Harry’s slumbering sheepdog, he snorted and shifted to look at the lump of blankets on the end of the bed. “If you can get her to wake up, I’m sure she’d love that.”
“Right,” Goyle said, nodding. Then, strangely, he added, “Thank you.”
The porcelain light of the moon is obscured by a wispy onslaught of clouds, half-hearted and lethargic in their crawl across the leaden sky. Taillights of fatigued taxis reflect shifting red and white shapes on the window panes.
“What’s wrong with corduroy?!”
But it didn’t, and Harry knew that, and Malfoy knew that, so they let the subject drop and the Slytherins came over for dinner again the following week. (Because Harry was a spineless bastard.)
“I haven’t said anything—”
“I’m not changing.”
He was sitting at the bottom of the slope on the little curved bridge, his elbows crossed over the middle beam, chin resting atop his arms. Someone had wound a miniature string of lanterns around the wooden posts, and they were twinkling faintly in the dusky lavender light, reflecting off the glassy surface of the stream and making Draco look like some sort of glowing forest nymph, gilded with flecks of bronze around the crown of his head. Phoebe was perched silently next to him, and his gaze was unfocused as he absently stroked her pelt. Harry wished he had a camera so he could freeze this moment in time forever, wanting it stamped on his mind for years to come.
“Since last month.”
“Oh!” Lovegood exclaimed happily. “How lovely. I haven’t seen her or Ron in ages. What’s the letter say?”
Malfoy’s brow screwed up in frustration, then almost automatically smoothed back down. “Fine,” he said, taking a breath in. “Don’t leave. But you’re not coming inside.”
Questioningly, Harry held up a spare mug so she could see it. “You want?”
“Nah, not ‘Mione.” Harry shakes his head even though Draco’s decided that looking at him is too exhausting a task to carry on. “She thinks wedding traditions are too heteronormative and commercialized.”
“I like cherries,” announced Potter suddenly, shifting in his seat so he could reach across the table and pluck one off the rim of Draco’s glass.
“I thought—this was over.”
It was that time of the evening where the sun was just present enough to slant through gaps between the mossy boughs and dapple the ground, lighting up the entire path with little pools of gold. Harry kept walking, unsure how far Phoebe or Draco had gone, until the slow cadence of music was replaced with the soft sounds of leaves rustling and birds tittering in the canopy above. He followed the path all the way to the dilapidated wooden staircase that sloped down towards the stream, stopping at the top to take stock of the landscape.
It wasn’t until he was halfway across the yard that Draco heard uneven, heavy breathing that wasn’t coming from him, and he looked back over his shoulder to find the grey and brown dog trotting at his heels, the branch still in its mouth.
Harry rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, pushing his glasses awkwardly up to the bridge of his nose. “That is exactly what I’m saying.”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” he breathed, relief crashing over him, but she was running in the opposite direction. Running towards the house, in fact, with a large, heavy branch hanging out of her mouth and dragging on the grass. Running towards a man that Harry had only just noticed standing at the foot of the porch, sort of blending into the slanted shadows of the morning. A man with white-blonde hair, and long legs, and a black windbreaker, and—and…
Harry was confused. “I’m confused.”
“Since the day we met,” Harry continued, taking another step up so there was barely a foot between them. “Do you remember the day we met?”
“Then shut it,” she instructed sweetly, reaching up to pluck the piece of broccoli off his fork and pop it into her mouth. He cried out in protest.
“No, we were talking about me
“Harry Potter,” was the first thing Malfoy said when the Slytherins reached the bottom, his voice dripping with horror. “Please, for the love of Salazar, tell me you’re not wearing dungarees to a bar.”
“Three.”
He was trying very hard not to explode. “They—a week ago?” he asked, strangled.
“No,” he agreed shakily, “I don’t think so either. Come on.”
“Do you not remember why we moved out here in the first place?” Draco asked, whirling around and leveling them both with disbelieving looks. They didn’t answer. “To get away from wizards! Not to live right bloody next to them and become best friends who lend cups of sugar to each other!”
“Yes, not a bad idea,” Harry told her faintly, feeling as if he’d left his entire head back in the alley.
Malfoy shrugged, unfazed. “Fine. She can stay here. Pansy’s been feeding her bits of scrambled egg all morning, so I’m sure she won’t mind staying.”
every other day and he needed to keep the stream of reporters at bay. Those had been much more complicated runes, but there had also been plenty of damage Harry hadn’t risked touching.
“Oh my god, fine,” Hermione replied, still laughing. “Nice to know you don’t want to be my girlfriend. Your loss, honestly.”
A slight nod. “Part of it.”
“Yeah, well,” Harry said, and his heart sped up, drumming a soft, familiar melody against his ribs. “She’s not the only one.”
“No one’s cleaned down here in over a decade,” Malfoy said from behind him, nose scrunched as he swatted away plumes of agitated dust and headed towards a rectangular brick niche across from the rickety stairwell. “Wards are this way.”
to be straight, you know?”
Draco stared, pulse quickening in his ears. “I don’t understand.”
“Told you,” Draco said smugly, and all around them the evening buzzed with whispered promises of darkness, water turning amber as the sky sank slowly into its velvet cradle of night.
“And Hecate is sorcery, right?”
Theo stared at the note for a long, unblinking moment, then squinted. “That can’t be right. D’you think Potter drew the frog?”
And then Hermione had come up from behind Harry, freezing in the hallway, breath catching. Something had changed in Ron’s expression, like the grey, blustery sky had cleared instantaneously at the sight of her. “Can we talk?” he’d asked, quiet.
“Not this farmer,” Harry said flatly.
Luna shrugged. “Dicks can be attractive.”
someone. And we’re not doing that shit anymore, there are too many strings.”
He dropped his bag on the table next to Pansy’s with a thud and joined Greg by the window, trying to ignore the itch under his skin and the heavy feeling of melancholia suspended over his shoulders, threatening to collapse like an anvil on a thread.
Draco wasn’t looking at him anymore. Instead his eyes were fixed on the worn couch cushion, his fingers picking absently at a loose thread. “Do you... like us?” he asked, voice dropping low, threaded with insecurity.
“Not today, much as I’d enjoy freezing my appendages off,” Draco replied wryly, squinting down at her. The grey-ish sunlight was streaking sporadically through the trees and reflecting off the surface of the water, flashing in Draco’s vision. “Just checking to see whether or not you’ve been kidnapped.”
“True,” Theo agreed, bobbing his head. “We’d probably be tried for the murder of a national treasure.”
Draco shrugged. “Until he gets his dog back.”
“No, no, thanks.” Harry shook his head. “I’ll be fine.”
Harry folded his arms. “I’m not changing.”
Harry blinked, still not making eye contact. He didn’t have a good answer for any of these questions, but Draco wasn’t asking them like an interrogator—he was asking them like he was curious. Genuinely curious. Like he actually wanted to know what was going on inside Harry’s brain. “I guess,” Harry started with a substantial, bracing inhale, “Saying I was sick was just an easier excuse. I didn’t want to worry anyone. Luna or Nev, I mean, not—not you all.”
“No,” Harry answered truthfully, trying to avoid staring at Draco by fixing his gaze into his jar, swirling the bitter gold liquid around the bottom. “You caught me.”
“Of course,” Luna echoed, soft and bemused. “I’m just saying—hypothetically, if you were attracted to him—it would be fine. Normal, even.”
Luna, who was reclined against Harry’s headboard with her legs crossed, peered over the edge of her magazine and met Harry’s gaze in his wardrobe mirror. “Is this a serious question, or am I missing something?”
“Thank you,” he said quietly to Lovegood, trying not to feel awkward as he slipped his coat off and sunk down into one of the armchairs. It sprang under him and molded to his lower back, like it was made exactly for him.
“It’s really not,” Draco argued, feeling defensive of the poor thing. It shouldn’t have to be subject to Pansy’s bitchiness if it couldn’t verbally defend itself. “It’s two bloody syllables.”
“Yeah, well you make me crazy, too,” Harry conceded dryly. “There’s something we can agree on.” He didn’t bother specifying what
Draco smiles at him, all warm and rumpled like the blankets. “Me too.” He rolls onto his side so one calf is hooked over Harry’s and their heads are on the same pillow. Noses an inch apart. Moonlight pooling over them.
“Nice of them, isn’t it?” Luna said peaceably as Harry steadied himself on the door frame and caught Phoebe half in his arms. “Draco was just telling me how they moved in next door about a week ago. Phoebe’s been wandering off to their backyard every morning since they got here.”
Overwhelmed, Harry stumbled backwards and out of the alleyway, grasping onto the wall of the bar to steady himself. There was another flash of blonde ahead of him, but it wasn’t platinum this time. It was just Luna.
Draco looked up and around, the glazed look in his eyes sharpening at the sight of Harry. “Hey,” he replied, equally as soft. He’d taken off his outer robes and folded them into a small, neat pile, his socks and shoes sitting on top so he could dip his toes into the water.
Harry’s smile stretched, the little corner parts of his eyes creasing delicately, like silk, and his other hand came up to cradle the side of Draco’s head. “I think so, too.”
god, yes,” Harry said immediately, unfolding his legs and starting to pull himself up into a standing position. “Erwin, right?”
“Four years,” Pansy answered for him, tentatively wrapping one manicured hand around Luna’s outstretched forearm. “Give or take.”
“She came to
“Pretty sure he was at one point,” Draco answered, sinking low onto the sofa to have a better view of the window. Sure enough, Potter was still there, a dark silhouette against the stark greens and yellows of the meadow, all pigmented and rich with rain. He looked miserable, hunched in on himself and hunkered against the wind. Draco frowned, then felt a strange, hot wiggle in the middle of his chest, but decided to ignore it in favor of adding, “He might not be one anymore, though. Is living alone on a farm in the middle of nowhere an award-worthy achievement?” If it was, Draco wanted a medal.
Then, before he could stop and change his mind, he wound his arm back and threw it.
“I’ll take that as a yes, then.”
Neville scrunched his nose. “Eugh, I don’t blame him. Badgers are terrifying.”
“You are now,” Harry shrugged, and she rolled her eyes. “What? We can’t Side-Along you back, Ron’s the only sober one. He can’t take all of us.”
Draco folded his arms, eyes slanting. “It is your fault for having a stove that only works with magic, though. What’s with that?”
Draco was at the very back of the group—they had to walk single-file because the trail was so skinny—and for reasons unbeknownst to him, the speckled dog stuck by his heels almost the entire time. She panted heavily and happily, sometimes stepping on the rubbery bits of his boots near his heels, as if she was herding him along the trail. She obviously knew where she was going, although she didn’t seem to be in a rush to get back.
Potter tussled with the owl for a moment, nudging its spindly leg up so he could untie the thin parcel twined to its foot. He stroked its head to calm it back down while he tore the envelope open with his teeth, a movement that Draco absolutely did not stare at, thank you very much.
“Oh—Harry, that’s not Phoebe.”
But, then—
Sure enough, Ron and Hermione were sitting together on high bar stools at the very end of the bar, heads bent close and tinted red under the ambient lighting. Ron was the first one to lift his head and spot them, and a wide, goofy smile broke out on his face as he lifted his arm to wave them over. “Harry!”
“Er—yes.”
It had taken weeks for him to find a job, given that no one would hire him on Diagon because of his name. He’d been forced to turn his efforts into the Muggle world, a task that felt like tripping headfirst into a pool of freezing water. The Muggle world was a shock to his system. There had been so many forms to fill out, so many dotted lines to sign, so many numbers and instructions that Draco had nearly drowned in them. But he got a job, nevertheless, at a fast food joint ten minutes from Diagon and the neglected lodging house that he’d been shoved into.
“What—?”
Draco flipped her off as he pushed past, rucking his collar up against the cold. “Wretched woman. Don’t get kidnapped while we’re gone.”
Neville winced. “Fair enough. Are you going to go back over there?”
Pansy snapped her fingers and sat up abruptly. “That would explain Emerson!”
That was the whole reason he was letting this happen in the first place: to make Luna happy. To give her something to look forward to, because apparently she needed something like that and Harry hadn’t even noticed until she told him.
“The look on his
“Come on,” Potter persisted. “It’s not like the Ministry will be able to trace it or anything—you haven’t won it from me, so it’s technically still mine.”
It was protective in nature: a sturdy building with a solid foundation and walls that curved inward as if they were trying to shelter its innards from the outside world. On hot days in the summer, it would trap the sunlight inside and let it soak into the wood and stone, heating the floors and swelling the furniture. On cold days in the winter, it would fight the cold out like a ship battling a storm, hunkering into itself and battening down the hatches. It was comfortable and familiar, its cherry wood floors and exposed ceilings warm; safe. Harry felt protected here.
There was a short stretch of park right across the street where a few stragglers huddled together under a streetlight, smoke clouding their heads, and Luna pointed to them. “I’ll check the park, you check the alley? They can’t have gone far.”
Harry glanced over, watching as her straw-blonde hair whipped up around her face. “How do you know you love a song if you’ve never heard it before?” he asked, half-curious, half-skeptical.
Greg stood from his seat. “Me too.”
“I thought you might’ve, but it's always good to ask.” She came over to plop on Harry’s bedspread and folded her legs, mattress bouncing beneath her. She looked up at him, face open and bright. She wasn’t wearing any shoes. “Good morning.”
She shrugged lightly. “We want to do it as soon as possible.”
“I know a Malfoy when I see one.”
Except, during month ten of staying in Dublin, a wizard that Draco vaguely recognized had walked into the cafe he was waiting tables at, taken one look at him, and walked right back out. That same night, a thick, cream-coloured envelope slipped under the crack of their front door.
At one point, he’d accidentally gone three weeks without talking to anybody; he wasn’t depressed, he didn’t think, just caught up in other things. Caught up in himself. At the end of those three weeks, a knock much louder than Hermione’s or Ron’s sounded at the door, and he’d opened it to find Luna and Neville standing on the welcome mat.
“Smart lad,” Theo said through a mouthful of his breakfast, gesturing approvingly across the kitchen counter with his spoon.
“Shit.” Harry blinked as Malfoy took his elbow.“Are you going to be okay? Please try not to throw up on me.”
Greg had looked dangerously nauseous, his gaze unfocused and skin tinged green. “We stop using magic.”
When he reached the top of the stairs, he almost ran headfirst into someone—Gregory Goyle, in fact. Gregory Goyle wearing plaid pyjamas and holding a tin watering can that looked miniature in his huge hands. He froze when he saw Harry, eyes widening astronomically. “Uh,” he stalled, throat working, then held up his watering can. “Sorry, I’m—watering the plants.”
“Hi,” Draco said, stopping at the top step of the porch.
“Alright.”
“Sounds good,” Harry agreed, and then they wobbled off in their separate ways. Somehow, the bar was still ridiculously crowded despite the late hour. He had to grab onto Luna’s wrist as they squeezed towards the exit so he wasn’t engulfed by the pumping music and humid bodies clogging up the main floor, creating a sort of human chain as they weaved together through the hazy, neon-tinged mass.
Harry was nearly at the bottom of the steps when he heard a soft cough from behind him. “What’s she the goddess of?”
“I... think that would just be a normal tree. Given that wands are made out of trees, and everything.”
Luna sighed, then poked at Harry to move his elbows aside so she could recline back into his lap. “You’re all so intent on being mysterious. Why is that?”
A knot of panic tightened in Draco’s chest. “Shit. Do you think—?”
“It’s our home Draco, remember?” Harry interrupted him. “I told you I want you to have everything you could ever want here, everything you need. The garden is just a waste of space, we should get it done so that we can enjoy it. The muggle neighbours can’t see it anyway so it can just be our private outdoor space in the middle of London, our sanctuary.”
“So I guess we understand each other a lot more now then.” Harry said simply.
“So the book then. Can we rewrite those chapters a bit? Put my name in but maybe also do the interaction from my point of view too? There were still loads of things in those chapters that I wanted to ask but we got into things a bit deeper than I thought today…” Draco sighed.
Walking back into the Great Hall the first thing that struck Draco was the light. The sun had risen and was beaming in through the broken windows. There was no sign of the hooded figures or their fearsome leader. The darkness was gone. People were rushing into the middle of the room, cheering and desperately trying to reach someone in the middle.
To him it looked like some sort of playsuit that babies wear but that didn’t mean that Draco didn’t look good in the all-in-one pale pink shorts and top combination. Harry had yet to see something that Draco didn’t look good in. He had no doubt that if he tried on that outfit he would look absolutely ridiculous in it, but Draco just made everything work and had decided out loud that it was
Please let me know what you think though!
“I thought Harry was meeting us all at yours at midday?” Draco said to Daphne, frowning. “Please do not tell me he’s coming here and I’m not even ready yet!”
Draco and Teddy <3
Harry looked mildly surprised at George now. “I know.” He said casually.
“I could definitely see that all working and you’ve obviously thought it all through.” Blaise said looking around and nodding in approval. “Daphne will be great with the customers too. She can sell anything with her cunning Slytherin charm and it doesn’t hurt that she’s nice to look at.”
Suddenly Draco stiffened up. This is exactly what he’d been afraid of, this is why he had wanted to take it slow and had been avoiding talking about sex with Harry. Damn it, he sighed inwardly as he distanced himself from Harry swinging his legs over the side and sitting up.
Before Harry could answer Draco had turned them both and backed Harry up against the nearest wall pressing himself into Harry so that Harry could feel exactly how much Draco wanted him.
Harry felt like he needed to elaborate but he didn’t want to go into the whole book  thing here. He was eager to get home now really, he was emotionally exhausted and had a lot to think about.
“Oh, er, right, well, erm thanks.” Harry said slightly surprised but also… pleased. “So what, I have to call you Drake now?” He said with a smile, feeling more at ease.
Before he left he wrote to Daphne and sent it with one of the Weasley’s business owls as he wondered for the millionth time whether it was finally time to replace Hedwig and get his own owl. He hoped at the very least that Daphne would come but then it would be mildly awkward if it was just him, Daphne and George in the box. He hoped they could hang out as a group to take the pressure of George and Daphne’s first meeting in case he was totally wrong about them hitting it off (which he very well might be!). He didn’t want to end up as some sort of third wheel.
and I-”
Smiling to himself Draco went over to give Harry a supportive kiss on the cheek as he carried on preparing breakfast. Then he got two glasses of orange juice from the fridge all by hand as he always did but noticed his mother was still watching him with a curious expression. He tried to ignore her look but deliberately carried on doing everything without magic just to subtly prove a point. He put the glasses on the table trying to ignore the fact that his mother was sitting where Harry always sat. After that he set the table and helped Harry dish up.
Potter flashed him one last smile and walked out the door, then he was gone with a twist and a faint popping sound.
“Sorry, I’ve just always wanted to say that” Harry said chuckling to himself. “And I’m hardly late, it’s ten past nine and I said I’d be home around nine.”
Turned out it wasn’t nearly as bad as Draco expected. He was worried that his pre-bed meditation would be affected with Harry in the same room, and it had been really, but then it hadn’t seemed to matter as he slept well anyway. Maybe the meditation wasn’t really needed now that he was actually happy... that would be something.
Harry thought he didn’t like admitting that he didn’t know something.
It was true that he was used to being alone but he hadn’t exactly been happy about it, even if he’d told himself at the time that he was. Now though, he couldn’t imagine being without Harry. He still had his concerns but so far everytime he over-thought something and his insecurities had crept up on him Harry had surprised him in the best possible way handling them all beautifully. Like the fact that Draco could be completely naked around him now even with his mark on show without feeling exposed, vulnerable or judged. Instead he felt comfortable in his own skin and cherished.
Harry smiled a kind of knowing smile that Draco didn’t quite understand. He shifted again and bought his right arm down from the top of the sofa and placed it gently on Draco’s thigh. “It will be alright.” Was all he said.
“Thanks Kreacher, but I would like to try and be more independent too but perhaps you could just show me around the kitchen a bit and tell me where things are and what the breakfast options are. Would that be OK?” Draco asked kindly, trying to copy the way Harry spoke to his house elf.
“We’ve got you Harry, it’s OK, you’re OK.”
Dean and the other contractors were still around when they got home mid afternoon. Dean had finished Teddy’s room as it wasn;t a big job but he’d stuck around as he wasn’t sure if Harry wanted the others to be in his home without him there. Harry, on Draco’s insistence, didn;t even get up off the sofa to speak to him or check on the progress of the garden. Draco handled it all simply asking the garden team if they could come back and finish the rest of the work tomorrow. Apparently he’d thanked Dean for the bedroom without even seeing it saying that they would look at it later and be in touch if they needed anything else.
“I have more evidence on Professor Snape’s actions and intentions that aren’t relevant to this trial but the Minister and I shall be clarifying his involvement in the war at a later date even if he... is no longer with us. But I will confirm that Professor Snape killed Dumbledore, not Mr Malfoy and I do not see why Mr. Malfoy should be punished for failing to fulfil Lord Voldemort’s orders.”
“Yes well I’ve done it now so you better just accept it.” She said firmly.
“This is your home- no, our home, remember Harry? You’ve told me often enough.” Draco said with a smile and then it faded slightly as he turned to Narcissa. “Mother didn’t mean anything by it, did you?”
“Maybe.” Was Draco’s quiet response.
Draco gently put his hand over Harry’s to stop him and then took the towel from him. “Don’t rub it, you'll make it sore, just pat it like this.” He said softly.
Instead he asked. “What about you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“She won’t thank you for saying that.” Draco added thinking he should probably make an effort to join in the conversation too.
“I won’t.” Harry shrugged slightly arrogantly, all though Draco didn’t really think he had an arrogant bone in his body. He used to, but that was before he knew him better.
Fred, who was now completely dressed again, walked over to Harry and cupped the sides of his face. “Harry, you know I’ll always put you first.” He said as he bent to give Harry a soft kiss on the lips. He withdrew and gave him a cheeky smile. “Plus, I’ve had a lot more sex than I usually do on a Monday afternoon.” He said dropping his hands and giving Harry’s arse a quick slap.
Harry got back into the bedroom where Fred was still half sitting up but dozing lazily. He accepted the tea gratefully though and started to sip it as Harry climbed back into bed and drank his coffee alongside him.
“Race you to the shower Gred!”
“What were the details of this… arrangement exactly?” He asked, still slightly holding Harry’s hand but not looking at him. “And did anyone else know about it? Apart from George of course who I’m assuming did.”
Advice from those in the know would be appreciated. Thanks guys! Much love x
“Right, anyway we won’t take up any more of your time. Thanks so much for this guys.” Harry said standing up.
Dinner seemed to last an awfully long time though as they had dessert as well and then for some bizarre reason Narcissa asked Kreacher for a cheese course. Even by the end of all that it was still only half eight but Harry just couldn’t take it anymore. He made his excuses saying that he had a bit of headache and he said it would be nice for Narcissa, or Ms Black as he kept having to call her, to catch up with Draco. He pointed out politely that Draco could show her around and she had two house elves now seemingly who would attend to her needs. He told her through slightly gritted teeth to make herself at home and then took himself to bed much earlier than he usually did and for once, without Draco.
Draco really wasn’t sure why he cared but for some reason he asked anyway. “Oh? I thought you were with that Weasley girl?”
Draco thought that he would tackle this again tomorrow when he’d had time to test his products.
Draco smiled too. Tibault was from a sailing village in the South of France and always called him Captain.
He smiled at Harry as those bottle green eyes opened and waited until Harry realised where he was.
“What’s going on here then?” George said, wandering over to them still carrying Rose in his arms. He’d been oddly attached to her today.
Through the windows the golden light was shining out from the ornate gold chandelier inside. There were some beautiful gift baskets on display in the large window. Harry couldn’t quite see the rest of what was inside the shop from here but he had seen enough to make him want to go inside, it was unlike any other shop on Diagon Alley. He couldn’t see anyone around it though, couldn’t glimpse the potions master who obviously had style and a good sense for business. It seemed a bit keen to go now as soon as it opened but Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to do any preparations for his book until his curiosity was satisfied. Also Diagon Alley seemed really quiet at the moment and he really wasn’t keen on going out in public still whatever he said to Fred.
“Oh, er, well I can catch you up quickly. It should be a good game today to be fair, these are two of the best teams now.” Harry started feeling like he was on much safer ground now. “Puddlemere had a bad start to the season and even though they are on top form at the moment the best result they can hope for is to finish 4th in the league. The Ballycastle bats were the favourite to finish top but they had a big loss against the Montrose Magpies so now the Harpies have a chance to take it from them today if they win by 250 points.”
“No… No I’m not mad, I’m- I’m speechless…” He started speaking in a quiet voice looking down at the kitchen table. He tried to gather the confidence to express himself honestly but it was still a new thing for him. When he spoke again his voice was louder but still shaky.
“Er, yes maybe given that you have to look at his bright shop opposite you every day.” Harry laughed nervously.
“Of course Mr. Potter, my apologies I didn’t know.” She said quickly and practically ran out of the corridor in the direction of the healers office.
Draco nodded firmly and the look in his eyes told Harry that it was ok. Harry brought Draco’s left arm up again to near their faces and Draco held it there for him so that Harry could have both hands free to undone the straps. He undid them slowly looking at Draco’s face the whole time wanting to be sure he was OK. Once the straps were both undone Harry took the leather holster away and placed it carefully on the bedside table with Draco’s wand still inside.
As he came into the kitchen he saw Harry sitting at the table with what looked like the latte thing he’d made for Draco last week, a coffee for himself and a box of chocolate eclairs. Draco smiled, if this is what it was going to be like every day living with Harry then he really might never leave. Draco didn’t always like it when people bought stuff for him but somehow knowing that Harry had gone out to buy his favourite felt much less like charity and more like just being treated. He found that he very much wouldn’t mind being spoilt by this man who he just happened to have a massive crush on.
“No Draco.” Harry said softly. “Don’t do that. I want you to have a relationship with your Mother. I’m fine, like you said I can handle her, it's just an adjustment that’s all.”
“Yes having the Saviour cook for us, how lucky are we.” Blaise said affectionately but Draco didn’t miss how Harry tensed up besides him.
Just as Draco was hesitating slightly for no known reason, a large group of Ministry officials alongside the Minister of Magic himself started walking towards him on the narrow corridor of the stands. He had to quickly take a step into the weird black mass to avoid them walking directly into him.
He stretched out his hand and took it from slowly passing it over in his hands a few times. “It’s the first time I’ve showered without it.” He said quietly. “It’s not just the fact that it covered the mark, it’s the security of having my wand on me at all times.”
Draco was waiting for Harry in the kitchen. The minute Harry walked in Draco was all over him. He vanished the bread bowls wandlessly and accepted Draco’s advances.
They keep me going, thank you! <3
“Me too.” Harry said confidently, feeling that so far this was going well. “You’ve trusted me and it means a lot as I know you don’t trust people easily but I hope I’ve shown you that I can be trusted.”
“I have a… friend, who is, well, he’s amazing really, he’s always… there for me but he’s not my boyfriend or anything.” Harry spoke not looking at Daphne but concentrating on spreading his own pâté.
“So erm, any tips on how to break the news to Ron? I mean you saw his reaction when he thought I was dating Blaise. He might kill me.” Harry said, only half joking.
“I’ve already told you that I’m not going Daphne!” Draco insisted as they sat in Blaise’s sitting room and waited for him to get back with dinner.
And he was bloody happy about it.
“Of course you don’t.” Blaise and Daphne both said at the same time with a knowing smirk.
“You used to tell me that I liked the attention but you’re wrong, I’ve never liked it. I never asked for any of this and I’ve never really had a choice in it. Everyone’s always had these expectations of me and it’s just… well it’s a lot. Like when I joined the aurors I’d already killed Voldemort, where do you go from there?! Everyone was acting like everything else in my life was going to be easy compared to that but it wasn’t always! Some of the cases were damn hard and you know who solved most of them? Ron did! But you know who got the credit for them? I did! You tell me how that’s fair? Ron deserves that job a lot more than I do.”
“Oh right.” Draco said quickly standing up straighter and focusing himself as if a big task was expected of him.
“Draco, what’s going on?!” The voice said louder. It was steady and commanding.
Harry flushed slightly but he looked… pleased possibly.
“George we’re not doing anything you prat.” Fred called back whilst giving Harry a bit of glance in silent questioning.
Fred raised a suspicious eyebrow at him. “You never go to the shops.”
“Oh no I don’t think so Potter!” He said stepping forward. “Let’s really give them something to talk about shall we?!” Then Blaise took Potters arm and looped it in his own.
“Harry Potter.” Draco said suggestively. “Are you asking me to be your boyfriend?”
Less than twenty-four hours later Draco was back in Blaise’s apartment after another successful day of brewing with Daphne running the shop. She had pre-wedding bridesmaid duties to fulfil back at the Greengrass estate tonight, much to her annoyance, but apparently George was planning to go out to keep an eye on his slightly more reckless twin tonight so she couldn’t use a date with him as an excuse. Draco and Blaise had plans with Harry.
Draco turned around once more and raised an eyebrow at her waiting for her to explain.
Harry couldn’t believe that after years of barely having anyone over, here he was in his front room talking to Draco as if they were old friends, or maybe it was more like a therapy session to be honest. He wasn’t sure, and he’d been rambling on for ages. Merlin, that was embarrassing, what had possessed him to say all that stuff? Draco had asked him a simple question “Here?” and Harry had opened his house and blurted all the stuff out about the house after the war and where he’d been staying. Did Draco really want to know all that crap?!
“OK.” Harry said slowly. “Good, that’s good. So, like before, last Wednesday, I mean… that was a lot, we shared so much that day and it was good right? You felt better after?”
“Yeah... I guess so.” Draco said, sounding completely exhausted this time.
Harry made sure to speak of the heroics of Ginny, Neville and Luna that day as well as the others of course as well as how lucky they were to have the order arrive. He also made sure to note that it was Snape who alerted the order but as ever he didn’t name the specific Death Eater actions with one exception, he had to say exactly who killed Sirius.
“Er, yes, sorry. I did try but, erm, well he technically had a life sentence before so it probably was a bit too much to hope for.” Leo said awkwardly.
“Like Auntie Ginny and Ollie?” Teddy asked. “She told me that Ollie was her boyfriend but I didn’t know what that meant but then I saw them kissing! Victoire saw it too, it was funny!”
“You actually volunteered for this?” Draco said with a raised eyebrow.
“Oh.” Was Harry’s only response. That was strange, did he feel… disappointed by the fact that it was only a short term thing? A little… but it would make sense that Draco would rather live with his friends of course. Harry shrugged it off. “Sure, however long you need.”
“I don’t eat a lot to be honest. Always preferred quality over quantity, and you know I have to watch my figure!” He said jokingly.
“That sounds lovely, thank you.” Draco shifted slightly on the spot, still being awkward with his body language. “Is there anything I can do?”
Just then the Chef wandered back over to the table with their main course which was beef something or other than Harry didn’t understand. He waffled on for a moment with the usual wine pairing but Harry was just thinking and not really paying attention. He smiled politely at the chef though as he left.
The confession had been liberating and for the first time in his life he wanted to tell someone everything and just completely let it all out. He ever thought that person would be Harry Potter but life had a way of surprising you sometimes. Harry had reacted perfectly to everything, he wasn’t as dramatic about things as Blaise could be and he didn’t mother him like Daphne tended to. He had just been there patiently listening, ready to jump in when needed. Draco knew that Harry wasn’t as eloquent with his words as he was so it actually made sense to him that the man’s gut reaction was to offer physical comfort.
“Oh, er, you didn’t know? Hmm, well perhaps I shouldn’t be the one… well, maybe you should ask her…” Leo stumbled.
“I heard from the kitchen, what about the Greengrass girl?” George asked.
“The truth about what?” Draco found himself saying with a raspy voice that sounded very unlike his own.
“OK.” Harry replied feeling a little out of his depth but determined to be there for Draco. “Well like you said, repressed memories are normal with trauma.”
Draco took a sharp intake of breath. No one had ever said anything about love… but now his annoyingly astute best friend had challenged him and he was damn right, Draco never backed down from a challenge.
Draco picked up his plate but Harry told him to leave it. He rushed into the lounge to pick up what he’d left in there yesterday and met Draco again by the front door.
“Daph” He said informally, he wanted her to know that he was talking to his friend not his employee.
Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco seemed slightly disappointed. He was becoming much easier to read so he was so open and relaxed.
Harry smiled widely looking very pleased and Draco felt happy that he made Harry happy. He thought again that he’d agree to anything Harry said if it made him that happy.
“Really? A matching silk dressing gown? The pyjamas were bad enough!”
“Yeah, that would be good.” Harry said flatly. Draco could tell that he was worried but he was trying to be calm. “I’ll just shower and get dressed then I can come over if you want. You got a flat above the shop yeah?”
“I’m not going to ask again.” Blaise warned.
“But my Mummy and Daddy aren’t in the tree.” Teddy said sadly.
“I want to interject with why I said and did those things. Again it’s not about me making excuses for my behaviour, I want to own what I did and I want to apologise for it but I also want people to understand me and maybe it will help me understand myself. I also want to warn people about the dangers of raising a child with a set of rigid pure-blood rules. Don’t get me wrong, there are actually some old wizarding traditions that I really like and I think there are aspects of the pure-blood culture which should be past down and learnt about in all wizarding families. I am proud to come from a long line of magical ancestry but not because I think we’re better than non-magical people but just because I love magic and I love the history of it. Those were some of the lessons from my childhood that I did actually enjoy.”
The Chef looked over from the middle of the kitchen and vanished their empty plates and glasses. A minute later he appeared with two floating plates and two more glasses of wine, white again this time. He talked to them about the fish course and how this wine paired with it. Harry thought honestly that he couldn’t really taste the difference between this wine and the last one but he trusted the chef’s word for it that it complemented the small seafood dish.
“Oh, yeah, sorry.” Draco said a bit sheepishly. “I told Blaise but I forgot I never told you. I’ve been working with them for months and they told me about this place. How did you think I knew about it?”
That was how Draco got his first official boyfriend.
it’s ok you can be nice to him again now.” Potter said in amusement. Draco had noticed him stutter over the word and it was mildly awkward, did Potter think they were friends? Had he just corrected himself because Draco was here? They were friendly but friends was a whole other matter. Friends call each other by their first name and Draco was definitely not ready to do that yet. He took his time in reaching to get his drink and bringing it to his lips so he had an excuse to look busy for a short time. Once Kreacher was gone Potter turned back to him.
“No.” Daphne said simply. “I wanted to ask you what I should do. I can either just ignore it or I can write back to say I have no interest in reforming the engagement and I shall never see you or them again.”
“Then get him back.” Was Blaise’s simple response.
Fred opened his eyes quickly and looked a bit more awake now. “Erm yeah we have actually, it’s er- it’s Monsieur Defoi” Fred said slightly awkwardly.
So little side note for you, I actually have my own home business where I make pillow sprays, bath salts, soap, shampoo etc and I write in my office/craft room where I'm surround by essential oils!
“No, not upstairs… please.” Draco pleaded still talking incoherently into Blaise’s embrace. “Everything gone, Blaise, everything destroyed, I can’t… I can’t go up…”
When he got back Harry didn’t seem to be home and Kreacher confirmed that he had gone out. Obviously he knew Harry had his own life and could go as he pleased but so far he’d always told Draco when he was going out so it was a bit strange and Draco couldn’t help but worry and wonder. He put it to the back of his mind though and went down to make some products. There was one new thing in particular that he wanted to try.
Draco felt a strong squeeze on his shoulder at his second suggestion and suddenly he couldn’t take it anymore, he needed Harry. Harry would know what to do now, Harry could take over. Lucius be damned. He couldn’t do a thing about it at the moment anyway and Drcao was sick of hiding. If his mother was serious about being part of his life then she would have to get on board with it at some point anyway.
wouldn’t know would he?” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I like to know as much as possible about the person I’m creating my products for and to be fair that is a question I ask my other customers but they don’t always know. I genuinely did want to impress you with the order but I couldn't very well make things in her favourite scents without you telling me what they were. That would have been far too suspicious.”
The following week, Draco had appeared on the front step of a duplex building in Cornwall, and Pansy had answered the door. The first thing she’d done was hug him; the second thing was, “Salazar, Draco, what are you wearing?”
“Yes,” Harry confirmed starchly, even though that felt like an eternity from now. “Yeah. Next Saturday.” Then, because Draco was still swaying in place, “Are you sure you don’t need a Side-Along? I’m perfectly willing—”
Harry sighed, hating that his dog held so much power over him, and let Draco in.
“You don’t find Erwin,” Harry told her gravely, “Erwin finds you.”
“Hey!” Harry exclaimed mildly, laughing. “That’s uncalled for.”
Draco looked around. Sure enough, the grey and brown dog was right behind him, tail still wagging, but no more stick hanging from its teeth. Now its tongue was lolling out of its mouth rather daftly, and the sight made Draco’s mouth twitch up. “Yeah. This is the fifth day, I think.”
"Positive."
Pansy rubbed his knee sympathetically. “I know it does. But Potter doesn’t.”
The tent and folding tables were also shoved into the boot of Harry’s car, able to fit all squashed together with the subtle help of an expansion spell. The car was old and beat-up, and there were always new dents on the hubcaps that Harry didn’t remember getting, but he loved it regardless. On the back, there was a whole army of bumper stickers that Ginny had given him for his birthday one year, saying things like
“You look like shit,” was the first thing Draco said when the door opened, his brows peaked high on his forehead. He didn’t look much different than he had a week ago, dressed casually in a black jumper and trousers that were creased sharply down the front. His skin was still pale and his hair was still neat and parted down the middle, crisscrossing in front of his eyes.
He disappeared into the hallway, leaving Draco to sip at his soup in relative silence. Except he wasn’t completely alone—Phoebe was lying on her side under the table, her tail lazily flicking Draco’s ankle every so often. She’d stuck to his side nearly the entire time he’d been here, following him around the kitchen and whining at him when he didn’t let her taste any of Luna’s homemade soup, and Draco could tell it was getting on Potter’s nerves.
“Fair point, but we did foster a litter of crups one time when I was younger.” Weasley flicked the balled-up napkin back in Potter’s direction. “Clingy little buggers. They all liked Charlie the best.”
“Because she has more organization skills and taste in one fingernail than you have in your entire body,” Draco says matter-of-factly, brushing a hand through the curls at the back of Harry’s neck.
“He’s not a child, Draco. What are you expecting him to do? Set the yard on fire?”
Draco returned the grin, lifting his arm to poke Theo lightly in the forehead, right between his eyebrows. “You’re sweating like a broken faucet.”
“A break from what?”
Harry said nothing, digging his mouth into the corduroy fabric stretched over his drawn-up knees.
“I haven’t the faintest idea.”
Phoebe just sat back on her haunches and stretched, languid and unbothered. There was dirt on her paws again.
Draco scrunched his nose. “You’re vulgar. Genitals and gender are completely different things.”
Harry dug the heels of his palms into his eye sockets, watching fireworks of color burst on the backs of his eyelids. He needed to talk to Hermione. If anyone had the ability to answer those questions, it was her.
Harry’s gaze slid back to Malfoy on its own accord. He was still standing, one hand white-knuckled over the back of his chair—no,
he thought with silent triumph.
Malfoy flung his arm out towards the staircase. “Be my guest.”
“On the run,” Harry echoed, the sentence grating his tongue.
“It—can be.”
Neville nodded thoughtfully and tore a piece of naan bread off the platter on the coffee table. “You should try following her,” he said to Harry before taking a bite and gesturing with his half-eaten bread. “Even if it’s not a nest of badgers or dogs, it’s possible there could be something dangerous in the woods since you haven’t checked them out.”
“That’s her name,” Lovegood clarified.
getting kidnapped.” She pulled herself fully out of the pool, coils of water making shiny trails down her bare shoulders and legs. “Pass me that towel?”
“Weird,” Neville said.
“Yes, I can see that.”
Heart thudding at the speed of light, Draco did a once-over of the clearing, pivoting slightly but feeling frozen and rooted to the dirt beneath his soles. Everything seemed to be in place, for the most part; the sky was still a faded shade of blue, the house was still standing—lopsided as it may be—and the birds were still chirping from their pedestals among the jagged branches. Everything was exactly how it was when Draco had first stepped outside with a cup of tea in his hands and saw the dog coming towards him, tail wagging, fur coated with light frost.
“Harry—oh.”
, clearly not planning to go home anytime soon. Harry remembered mumbling something about how they could find extra blankets in the hallway closet if they needed, but he hadn’t stuck around to see if they actually stayed or not.
It was worth the smile on Draco’s face. “Take your shoes off,” he instructed, knocking their ankles together. “The water’s warm.”
“What? It’s true.”
“Clawed feet?”
“Would that work for you?”
“How considerate,” Draco said dully. Then, before Potter could snap something back, he added, “I guess—I don’t miss it because I still have it. Technically speaking, I mean. I can still feel it in my veins, so it’s not really
and I have come up with nothing. That never happens.”
Draco sighed again, softer. “Sorry. Weddings have strange effects on me. It’s quite inconvenient, really.”
“Right, yes. But how did she convince him to invite us over? He was about ready to chop your head off the other day.”
“I think you should leave, now,” Draco spoke up then, breaking eye contact and setting the copper saucepan in his hand over the flickering stove.
“That doesn’t explain why she’s been coming over here, though,” Draco retorted, pushing his chair out and coming to stand beside her. The brown and grey dog—Emerson, as Pansy insisted on calling her—was still prancing around outside, sticking her wet nose into the beds of untamed wildflowers and sniffing the dilapidated, weed-covered patio furniture. He went on, “It’s not like we’ve been leaving food out or anything. She just showed up out of nowhere.”
It had been hard. Excruciatingly hard, and Draco had never felt less like himself than he did during that endless period of drudgery. He had begun to forget what magic felt like; how it sent static through his fingertips and tasted sweet on his tongue. How it made him feel powerful and untouchable. How it tied him down to a family that ruined his life, other peoples’ lives. How it isolated him from the rest of the world.
. There was also one that Luna gave him that just said
“Okay,” Potter replied. “But I have one more.”
“Glad we could help.”
“It’s for your own good,” Hermione assured, smiling apologetically as Harry rolled his head back into place and gave her a deflated look. “Are you sure you’re alright with us staying over tonight? If you don’t have room—”
“Hello there,” she said, raising her voice, since she was all the way across the clearing, all the while remaining completely, eerily calm. “I assume you’re the neighbours?”
It was—for lack of a better word—completely, indescribably bizarre.
“Merlin,” Greg said, eyes fixed on the window, television program forgotten entirely. “Is Potter making a political move, too? He looks miserable.”
“No,” Harry said automatically, turning away from the mirror. “No, of course not. He’s a dick and a half.”
Still, it was hard. Harry forgot things easily. Got caught up in his head easily.
Beside him, Draco’s lips tug up. He presses them to the crown of Harry's head. “Okay, Harry."
Harry thumped him in the arm. “I’m trying to tell you something important, tosser. Be nice.”
“You’re not really ill, are you?” Draco asked when they were halfway through the bottle, his head pillowed against the back cushion, his eyes strangely sincere.
“Precisely.”
It had taken him quite a long time to figure out the best way to harvest the apples when he first bought the property, back when he was all wide-eyed and reckless, aching to get out of the city. He hadn’t even been sure he would use the orchard when he bought it, since it used to be all sad and bent out of shape, the trees sagging and the fruit lacking. But now—after nearly two years of living here—Harry could say that he had more or less got the hang of it. He knew, now, what trees were the best to pick from, how to check if an apple was truly ripe, how not to bruise it after picking it. He knew how to turn those apples into apple juice, and apple fritter, and fruit salad, and apple pie. He was creating a small living for himself just based on the orchard, selling a few crates of fresh apples every month or so at a farmers’ market and donating the rest to London-based food banks that needed them.
The most annoying part about the whole dinner-with-Slytherins debacle was that he was, for the most part, enjoying himself—like, actually, genuinely enjoying himself. He even caught himself looking forward to them at the end of the week at times, which was an epiphany that made him want to tear his hair out.
enough to make him forget about the headache pounding at his temples, but not quite. He’d woken up feeling like a balloon full of hot air had inflated at the base of his cranium, uncomfortably pressing everything against the front of his skull and making his head throb. It had been a long time since he’d woken up with a hangover, but the moment he’d opened his eyes he could tell this one was going to be the worst.
“Deal. We’re not shaking on it, though.”
Harry didn’t know a lot about Pandora—Luna didn’t mention her often, only when she was a bit tipsy, or having a bad nightmare. She used to have them more often, back when she didn’t have an apprenticeship and hung around Harry’s house for days on end—but she hadn’t had one around him in months. Harry used to sit up with her at the foot of the guest bed and stroke her spine gently until the bad images stopped flashing on the back of her eyelids and she could fall back asleep. She’d do the same for him whenever he had twisted, grotesque visions of the Forbidden Forest late at night, or when he woke up in a cold sweat, a raging Fiendfyre dying around him as his eyes slid open. Those were the nights they’d grown close, like twin flames drawn to each other for support.
Feeling as if they only had one possible option going forward, he looked to Draco and asked hopefully, “Would you like to get drunk, now?”
“Right,” Draco said, looking amused. “Because we Slytherins are so incapable of human emotion?”
her there?”
The dog blinked wide, uncomprehending, puppy-ish eyes at him.
Before cutting the cake, Harry stood up on one of the rickety tables and announced that he was giving a toast, because that’s what he’d seen best men do at weddings in Muggle films. His speech was all over the place, but people laughed, and there were tears in Ron’s eyes by the end, so Harry figured he’d done pretty good; Draco also held onto one of his ankles the whole time so he didn’t slip off the table and break his neck, and that was pretty good, too.
“Harry?” came Hermione’s hushed, gravelly voice, followed by a lamp flicking on and the appearance of her bare feet in front of the fireplace. Her legs bent, and she came into full view, wild hair and oversized Chudley Cannons t-shirt and everything. “Harry, what’s going on? Is there an emergency? Why are you—”
Draco was bent over the stove when Harry finally ventured into the kitchen, setting the bowls down on the counter and trying not to snicker as Draco unsuccessfully tried to twist the burner knobs on. His mouth was set into a frustrated scowl, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and exposing a faint bruise of color on his forearm. Harry averted his eyes and pulled his wand from his waistband, pointing it at the stove.
Later, after the dancing had slowed and the piano had been replaced with an enchanted gramophone that played real music, Harry excused himself to the bathroom and returned to find Draco missing. Hermione and Ron were both sitting on the steps of the back porch, clearly exhausted, Hermione’s heels discarded to the side and Ron’s tie undone around his neck.
“Yes, that’s what’s happening.”
Harry grinned wide and fond, despite knowing next to nothing about Greek mythology. “Hello, Circe,” he whispered to the smallest of the lot, bending over to stroke his pointer finger down its delicate back. It fluttered its wings and shook its head, chirping pleasantly. Harry’s heart nearly melted out of his chest right there. “What’s she the goddess of?” he asked.
“Mm,” Draco hummed, playing along. “I think I’ve gotten quite used to it, but thank you for the concern.”
“Places?”
“Thank you. For telling me.”
“No, I do, they’re just not the kind you install into the house. I put them up manually.”
Harry paused, then repeated, “What are you doing here?” He looked around, meeting all of their gazes. “In Bedford, I mean. All the way out here in the middle of nowhere.”
Harry was floored. Had he somehow wandered into his neighbour’s backyard? He knew there were other properties in the area—of course he knew that—but he’d never gone as far as to try and meet his neighbours. He’d been rather enjoying the whole “lonely hermit who only sees two people a week” shtick he had going on. But this was obviously someone else’s house on someone else’s property, and Harry knew he needed to get out of here before he got arrested for trespassing, or worse.
“Um, yes, it is.”
“You know what I mean. And stop answering everything I say with a question.”
“You guys see her too, right?” Greg asked, sounding pained. “I’m not hallucinating?”
“You mean the big apple orchard?” Pansy asked, looking up from where she was leaning back in her chair, picking at her fingernails. Her hair was still tied up in a short ponytail, and the loose strands around the nape of her neck and around her face were still damp and curling from her swim. Her bare feet were propped up on the kitchen table about an inch away from where Theo was trying to show Draco the breach site.
he thought to himself as he stared out the kitchen window, hands clenched stubbornly around his piping hot mug of coffee.
Phoebe, of course, didn’t answer his question, choosing instead to wag her tail and sniff his feet like a weirdo.
Now, from the other tree, Harry heard Luna humming a familiar song under her breath as she picked, her blonde hair flashing through the clumps of branches. Harry thought it might be “Golden Slumbers” by The Beatles, but he wasn’t sure. All their songs tended to melt together.
I figured out. I’m not that imbecilic. But why did she invite us in the first place? And why did you go along with it?”
“I—fine.” Malfoy then did the unthinkable, tugging off his thick, sage-green jumper and shoving it at Harry. “Put that on. I’m not leaving until you do.”
“What?” He looked back. There was fear on Malfoy’s face again; tired, timeworn fear. “How do you have wards, then?”
Harry wasn’t sure what exactly constituted “progress”, but he trusted her, and part of him soared when he heard her say the word “proud”. It made him feel whole, and human. It made him feel real. When Harry told Eva this, her smile had wavered.
“Up to you.”
“Oh, that’s what that was.” She squinted and tilted her head back, presumably so she could frown at Draco better. “You’re saying that the wards breaking led you to believe I got kidnapped? That’s a bit sexist, isn’t it?”
A gentle hand touched Harry’s shoulder, and he swiveled to look at Luna. “They don’t have magic, Harry,” she said softly.
“I think so,” Harry nodded, patting down his pockets and looking around as if he might find something in the gravel driveway.
“Oh, my god.” Pansy rolled her eyes and pulled herself further out of the water, half-sitting on the slab of rock. “I keep forgetting you’re all politically correct now. She’s a dog, Draco. Dogs don’t have a gender spectrum.”
His stomach lurched, and without stopping to think, he gripped his wand and Apparated before he could throw up right there in Draco Malfoy’s backyard. The clammy, organ-twisting darkness that overtook him was more than welcome, enfolding him, pulling him away.
“Waking me up to talk about Malfoy, of all people?”
Neville blew a frustrated raspberry. “Fine,” he stated, pushing his chair back from the table. “Don’t go back.”
“Have everything?” he asked when he emerged into the foyer, keeping one hand wrapped around the doorframe for support. Draco was sitting on the bottom step of the stairwell with his coat on, putting on his shoes while Phoebe sniffed insistently at his knees.
“I haven’t been
“He has not.”
Malfoy stared at him, then at the runes, then back at him. “You—have got to be kidding me.”
Her smile deepened with amusement and she stepped across the threshold into the room, blonde hair catching the filtered light from the windows. It framed her face like a golden halo, her baby hairs almost translucent as they curled up around her temples. “Have you just woken up?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Going to bed?” Draco asked quietly, voice raspy as he flicked his gaze up to hers. He’d barely spoken since that morning, having been locked away in his bedroom since they returned from their jaunt through the woods, spending the rest of his day brooding, then crying a little, then brooding some more.
it won’t. Wands don’t work that way, Potter.”
At this point, Harry didn’t know what he wanted. To go home, maybe. To sleep for a year.
He tried to keep up with them—he really did—but it was hard. Harder than most things he’d had to do. Harder than uprooting the rows of dead trees from the back ends of the orchard, harder than rewiring the electricity box, harder than slipping backward off the sloped edge of the roof and spraining his ankle. He tended to forget himself, sometimes, accidentally not talking to anyone while spending days pulling weeds from the vegetable garden or cutting back the overgrowth that crept in from the surrounding woodland. It was so easy to get lost for days in the depths of his orchard, and he’d forget to speak to people. Forget to respond to an owl, or Firecall someone back, or even shoot someone a text.
“Well, it’s not like I changed for his sake,” Draco said stormily.
Harry’s brain supplied automatically. “Everything,” he said instead.
Harry blinked. “I’d like you to leave, now.”
Harry smiles. “And the house? Big or small?”
“Luna—you’re a lesbian.”
drunk, though—he wasn’t seeing double or anything, and he could probably still tell someone the name of the prime minister if they asked. Not that they would, because that would be an odd question to ask a drunk man. But it could happen.
Lovegood looked at him and tilted her head thoughtfully. “Thank you. Gregory Goyle, right?”
?” Neville asked, astonished.
Harry tried not to shiver at the word ‘darling’ coming out of Draco’s mouth, his accent still crystal-cut despite the alcohol soaking into his system.
Luna tilted her head pensively. “Phoebe was named after a Greek goddess, wasn’t she?”
Not wanting to think about a colony of badgers for longer than strictly necessary, Harry tried to steer the conversation back to the issue at hand. “Either way, I don’t think Phoebe’s found a colony of anything. The North corner isn’t
Out of his peripheral vision, he saw her forehead crinkle. “If you say so.” She didn’t sound convinced.
“Should we return her to her owners?” Greg piped up from the table, sounding anxious. “Maybe they were looking for her and they crossed the wards by accident.”
know who we are?”
Ron and Hermione came over a lot when he first moved in, helping him pick out paint colors at the hardware shop ten minutes away, taking boxes of clothing and knick-knacks through the Floo from Grimmauld Place, bringing bags of takeout from Harry’s favorite Indian place in London and eating it on the bare wood floor in the living room. But then, after Hermione decided to go to grad school and Ron got a desk job at the Department of Magical Games and Sports, they started showing up less. They tried to make it once a week, at least, but then that dwindled down to once a month, and then once every two months, and eventually they only came when Harry invited them, which wasn’t very often. Not because he didn’t want to, just because he forgot to.
“Yes?”
“Oh my god,” Potter groaned, dropping his handful of pebbles into the grass and scrubbing a hand down his face. “Malfoy, I’ve been out here for over an hour.”
“She certainly is not,” Harry argued, wrinkling his nose as he pulled at a particularly stubborn sprig of foliage that was in his way. “She’s just—she’s confused.”
Magic was a double-edged sword, and he was learning that more and more everyday.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Harry groaned when he woke up and found the clump of blankets at the end of his bed empty. The whole house was empty, in fact, and for the first time in days, there were no stray Lunas or Nevilles straggling about in their pyjamas, making tea, or feeding the chickens. The kitchen was quiet, the hearth in the living room unlit, the backyard sheathed in feeble grey light. Harry didn’t mind being alone—he found it quite peaceful most of the time—but without Phoebe there, he felt suddenly and uncomfortably abandoned.
“If we walked her back we could meet the owners,” Theo pointed out.
“I panicked!” Harry exclaimed, even though he felt the exact same way. He shouldn’t have left her there. He should have bucked up and done something, not Disapparate at the first sign of trouble. Still, feeling prickly and defensive of his dignity, he argued, “It’s Draco fucking Malfoy! I was a bit caught off guard, if you can’t tell.”
He stared at her socks. They were black and crew-cut, with little blue stripes near the hem. “Not particularly, no.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “We can’t talk from here?”
“Obviously we’re not in school anymore,” Malfoy replied flatly. “Though I’m surprised you noticed, given how your observational skills have been somewhat lacking over the years.” He flicked his gaze up. “Also given the fact that you still look like you’ve been dragged by your ankles through a field of cacti. Is that how your hair naturally looks, or do you have a special routine that helps it defy gravity?”
It wasn’t the over-the-top kind of drunk, though, like how they’d been at the bar the other night; it was the warm kind of drunk. The kind of drunk where they sat on opposite sides of Harry’s sofa with their legs crossed and drank elf-made wine out of Mason jars, because Harry told Draco it was “the classy way” to drink wine and Draco didn’t believe him, but did it anyway. It was the kind of drunk where they didn’t speak for long stretches of time, staring off into some transient vanishing point fixed in the centre of the room, and when they did speak up, their words were diluted and nonsensical, their questions quietly careless.
“A bit,” he admitted, abashed. It was hard for him to get through dense novels, but the ones Luna had gifted him were written for teenagers and easy on his dyslexia because the font was so large. “I’ve only finished the first book, though.”
“You,” he said to his traitorous dog as he climbed up the porch steps, balancing an empty crate against his hip, “are a very strange animal.”
“Miss what?”
Of course it was. “Granger being an advocate of prison reform isn’t too surprising,” Draco said honestly, leaning back in his chair and feeling a grey sort of emotion wash over him. “I don’t think it’s too preposterous, though, if we’re talking about hardened criminals. But the fact that the rule extends to every convict ever has been a bit—inconvenient for me.”
Smiling around his straw, Potter flicked a wadded-up napkin at Weasley’s forehead. “Call my dog loopy again, you wanker.”
Draco took a breath in.
“Us,” Malfoy said, then scrunched his nose at his own words and backtracked. “No, not us.
Potter rolled his eyes. “We can’t—” He paused. Took a moment. “Actually, that might work.”
“I know so.” Theo had nodded. “It’s the only explanation—this is the third place I’ve moved, and they’ve managed to find me every time. Magical Law Enforcement are the only people who know my whereabouts, so it’s got to be them.”
Harry grit his teeth. “Why bloody not?”
She gasped. “No. Were they really?”
“Yes, I know the bloody enchantment.”
Pansy gave him a long-suffering look. “Perhaps the fact that she doesn’t have a dick.”
But then another letter had arrived; one that was different from the others, scrawled on thick parchment and sealed with a purple wax stamp.
“You defeated Voldemort with it,” Draco pointed out, running his pointer finger over the tip.
Draco closed his eyes. “Merlin above. What?”
“I… yes.”
“Do we have another option?” Draco asked, pained.
“Do you feel the switch?” Malfoy asked when they reached the apparent bottom, and Harry groped around the brick wall until his fingers passed over something hard and plastic. He flicked it on, and the basement flooded with light, yellow and flickering. Harry took one look around the room and sneezed.
Malfoy stared, inscrutable and twisted, then sucked in an audible breath. “Fine. No need to ask twice.” He turned and stalked off towards the back door, nodding at Goyle and Nott to follow him, both of whom looked like they’d swallowed a pair of sour lemons.
And part of him did know it. He did understand that what he and Draco had ran deeper than anything he could have imagined. That they had roots in places that were impossible to see from the surface. Roots that somehow found their way into Harry’s chest, weaving through his ribs and around his heart.
There was an awkward pause, broken by the caw of what sounded like a hen, and then Theo piped up again. “Well,” he said, clearing his throat. “We’re glad we could help. With the dog.”
Harry nearly fainted. “You’re
Pansy giggled, swiping her feet out of the way of his attack, then nudged at him to budge over. “Come here, you big oaf.” She scooted around on the bench so she was next to him instead of across, lifting her arm. “Come here.”
“I thought so,” Luna hummed. “I believe a distant aunt of yours taught my mother how to speak French, too. She was quite good at it, I remember.”
Like the house, Harry had accidentally fallen in love with Eva, too. But when he’d asked her out for a drink after their final session together, him standing in the doorway of her clean office, she’d just smiled sadly and shook her head. “It was a pleasure working with you, Harry. I truly wish you the best.”
“Not quite,” Potter disagreed, looking the slightest bit surprised at Draco’s flippant use of Voldemort's name. “He defeated himself. Your wand had very little to do with it.”
“What.”
For emotional compensation, he decided to bunker down in his living room and rewatch an array of his favorite films, only moving from the sofa for intermittent meals that weren’t really meals, just scraps of whatever he could find in his pantry. He watched
“Potter,” Draco said, sliding the panel up and peering down into the hazy darkness at the dark, windblown figure he would recognise anywhere. “What on Earth do you want?”
Luna took a step sideways, and from behind her Harry’s dog came rushing forward, tail wagging excitedly as she launched herself at Harry’s legs and nearly knocked him over.
“Brilliant.” If these were standard wards, the breakage wouldn’t be too hard to find. Harry had adjusted the wards at Grimmauld Place once upon a time, back when his face was on the cover of
, when he came to a full stop.
But then Longbottom handed Draco a chock-full glass of wine, and Pansy leaned forward to ask, “So, what are you all doing nowadays?” and Draco knew he was stuck.
“I don’t think it is. Theo’s on patrol trying to find where they broke.”
“You should go to bed now,” Harry told them. “Sorry, again. I really didn’t plan on calling you this late.”
“Bottom drawer next to the fridge. And what makes you say that?”
“Ah,” Malfoy said, mouth wavering, like he was debating whether or not he should smile. “Well, they were quite lovely. At least, my five-year-old mind thought so.”
“No, you’re not.”
Lovegood’s smile deepened graciously. “Thank you.” She turned her gaze on the rest of the group. “You all look very nice. We’re not quite finished cooking dinner, but there’s a cheese board and a bottle of daisy wine in the living room down the hall. Do make yourselves comfortable.”
“Good,” Ron grumbled.
Harry kept staring at the chunk of asphalt. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Actually, I do,” Draco replied, not feeling happy about it. He strode across the kitchen and grabbed the black windbreaker that he’d discarded over the back of his chair, still damp with morning dew. “Obviously, you’ll need my oodles of strength to protect you if these new neighbours start flinging hexes.”
“So, what is it then?”
All at once, his knees felt wobbly and made of rubber and wood, like he was a puppet being held up by a set of thin plastic strings, ready to break at the slightest wrong move. His heart beat in his ears as glimpses of orange, angry fire flashed before his eyes; he saw pictures of crumbling stairways, of flooded bathrooms, of blood-stained fabric, of scorched rubble, of overturned tables, of green curses. Of King’s Cross Station, white and nebulous.
“No,” Harry said flatly, even though he should. He really fucking should.
“Of course they did. Everyone likes Charlie the best.”
“Your dungarees are quite ugly,” she informed Harry apologetically. “Perhaps if you put a jumper over them?”
Neville rounded the table, and Harry noticed for the first time that morning that he was still in pyjamas, wearing one of Harry’s pairs of heather grey joggers. Harry didn’t know when exactly he’d lent those over, or
“What do you mean, you weren’t
Harry glanced up, chest tightening. “What about me?”
Malfoy blinked, seeming startled by the sound of his first name. “I do, on occasion. Why?”
“Hm.” Potter’s brow was now furrowed thoughtfully, pinched in the middle and creasing the tan, soft-looking skin between his eyes. Draco wanted to smooth it down with his thumb. “I still don’t understand that. It’s not like you have the Trace on you or anything, right?”
Draco’s brow creased disbelievingly, juxtaposed by the cherry-red blush blotching across his cheeks. “Oh? Based on whose merit?”
Draco stared at her hard, then sighed and re-collapsed onto the bed. “Yes, probably.”
Startled, he whipped around and grabbed at his neck, looking in the direction of the noise that had sounded somewhere from beyond the fluttering clothesline. It had sounded almost like a firecracker, booming and sharp, over in less than a second. It sounded like something had been shot into the air, or cracked open, or torn.
“Thank you. For checking up on me.”
“Brilliant,” Pansy sighed.
“I’ll have you know that they can be
“You’ve had a dog before?” Draco asked, twisting to arch a disbelieving eyebrow in Theo’s direction.
“He didn’t force me,” Draco said to his knees, breaking his gaze away and staring at his own socks. White and plain, with little moth holes. “And he didn’t know we would end up seeing Potter. He’s got nothing to feel bad about.”
However, the last thing he wanted to do was go searching for her and cross the property line again. He didn’t want to see Malfoy, or Nott, or Goyle, or Parkinson, or anyone. He just wanted his dog.
Unable to refuse him one more time, Harry acquiesces quietly and lets Draco pull him back towards the rumpled mattress in the center of the room. The navy-colored duvet looks black in the shadow of the night, spilling onto the creaky oak floors dramatically.
out of his element—his element was something more along the lines of a quiet night at home, fire crackling and wireless turned up—and yet he was having fun. Real fun.
Theo nodded. “Yes. And I know damn well it wasn’t any of us.”
"Everyone needs a hero love," he winked at the presenter before delving into the topic of his new film. Draco could hardly believe that this was the very man who had saved him from slipping over on Monday, the man he'd been thinking about all week. He had struggled with the mystery of the man's identity, he never shared his name, but always seemed to know when Draco would finish his shift, and he had grown used to the green eyed stranger waiting for him outside the bar doors. He supposed that wouldn't be happening for much longer as they discussed the promoting tour that was due to start on Tuesday.
"I'll make sure to bring you back a present in the most vibrant shade of coral I can find then my love," with a loud laugh as Draco spluttered his arguments against such a gift profusely, Harry apparated from the room with a barely audible crack.
It hadn't occurred to either of them that a simple Alohomora might have done the trick and freed him.
It was wearing Draco down, he could see how guilty Harry felt, how much he regretted his actions and how desperate he was to have Draco back in his life. Draco felt similarly, he craved Harry, craved his presence, his touch, and his whole person. he wasn't sure if he could do it though, would it hurt too much, would his heart be crushed once again? Would he come to regret the decision he made no matter what he did? In years to come would he regret never taking the opportunity, the leap of faith that was Harry. Or would it all go downhill and would he end up wallowing in pools of his own tears once again. Draco could never know, not unless he decided to take that leap into the unknown, take his fate into his own hands and make the decision himself.
"It all depends on you." There he was, taking his fate into his own hands. Deciding that the only way he would know if it was a good decision was by throwing himself in headfirst. There was no way that he could know if he would end up heartbroken once again, and there was no way he could know if everything would work out perfectly and they'd spend the rest of their life together. No one could know without him deciding to just go for it.
Draco sashayed down the stairs, trying not to allow the hangover to take over his body, his head throbbing and beginning to quake as music billowed out of the radio. It had been a long night of singing and partying, along with an overabundance of alcohol, leaving him with an outrageous headache and a throat as dry as the desert. Burying his head further into his dressing gown, he creeped his way into the kitchen, intent on following the distinctive scent of bacon wafting its way through the house.
"I see I've become predictable in my actions then," he mused to himself, although he didn't sound upset, if anything he seemed rather happy that Draco expected him to be outside when he finished his shift in the evenings.
Turning to face him, Draco stuffed his hands into his pockets as they gazed at one another. Draco felt as if they were locked within their own world, eyes latched upon one another as the rest of the world faded from around them. Slowly they lent towards one another, Draco's heart pounding as he knew what was going to happen next. Readying himself for the incoming kiss, Draco's heart almost leapt out of his throat as they were blinded by headlights. Jumping apart, they both flushed a bright pink, stuttering as they fumbled as to what to say in such a situation.
“To be fair, we didn’t know who she belonged to,” he said, pretentious and sandy-haired as ever. He was looking at Harry with a flat, unreadable expression, but his tone sounded practiced and unnervingly polite. “Someone breached our wards this morning, and we figured that was a good enough reason to meet our neighbours. Your dog had little to do with it.”
Draco looked back. “What makes you think it’s a ‘her’?”
“That’s what you get for having a swim in October, lunatic,” Draco replied, but squeezed her arm fondly as if his touch just might help her warm up a bit. “Should we head back?”
Potter seemed surprised by this answer, posture straightening as he perked up. “Why not?
“See, I knew she’d be fine without us,” Luna said proudly from somewhere behind Harry, putting down her own stack of crates to pet Phoebe’s head lovingly.
But then the death threats had started coming in. Envelopes had been stuffed into his mailbox, slipped under the crack in his door, dropped into his hands by owls as he walked through Diagon, head down and hood up. Everywhere he went they’d managed to find him, in every restaurant or grocer, on every street he turned down.
“Draco?” came Pansy’s voice, soft and heedful. “Can I come in?”
On Monday, he woke up to a world coated in white. The earliness of it was surprising; normally it didn’t start snowing until late December or early January, but Harry wasn’t complaining. The snow virtually immobilized the entire orchard, giving him yet another excuse to stay indoors and rattle around his house like a retired man in his seventies might. It was also the first day that Phoebe hadn’t left in the morning—instead she was snuggled up in the mound of blankets at the foot of Harry’s bed, exactly how she was supposed to be. Part of Harry felt inclined to send a quick note next door and tell the Slytherins not to worry about her absence, but then he remembered that making contact with them was the absolute last thing he wanted to do, so he didn’t.
“Are you going to let me in?” Draco asked tiredly, letting his head roll forward, hair falling into his eyes and making Harry’s heart skip.
“I highly doubt that,” Harry replied, but took his shoes off anyway and placed them next to Draco’s pile, tucking his balled-up socks into the openings. Draco squeezed his fingers as he scooted forward onto the edge and dipped his toes into the stream, expecting ice. But the water was warm.
“Your five-year-old mind has great taste,” Luna said, and then Malfoy couldn’t seem to hold back a smile any longer. It was tentative and small, but nothing like the smiles Harry was used to seeing on him. It softened his features, almost, making him blend in with the gold satin of the evening rather than stand out against it like some sort of dark stain.
Harry thought that he might need a little help, now.
The clearing that surrounded the Slytherins’ house was quiet when Harry finally made it there, picking twigs off his sleeves and feeling the soft, damp soil spring beneath his soles. It was almost completely dark—only one light was on in the old, crooked house, the one on the top floor that Harry instinctively knew belonged to Draco.
Something cracked inside Harry’s chest like soft clay and warmth spilled into his abdomen, pooling around his ribs. “I think you’re growing on me, Malfoy,” he admitted as that warmth began to spread up his neck and to his face, curling around the backs of his ears.
“Yes. Do you know the enchantment?”
Could you not think of anything better, Draco?”
After a while, though, he figured out that seclusion was a good thing for him. The best thing, even. By being alone out here on this wide, expansive stretch of nature, Harry began learning how to be happy on his own; how to live with himself and not criticise his every move, not beat himself up for things that were out of his control. His old Mind Healer, Eva, had applauded his choice to move out to the countryside when he told her about it.
“My thoughts exactly.”
Draco jerked his head, eyes wide. “Harry,” he said, hitched.
Draco stared at her, then acquiesced. “Fine.”
There was a squeak of door hinges, and someone came onto the porch. Someone with obnoxiously white hair and a black windbreaker.
“Brilliant. Who’s winning?”
Harry stared at him. “You like it on me.”
Harry gritted his teeth. “I know.”
“You’re going to have to tell me all about them.” Parkinson dropped Hermione’s hand, then looked around at the group questioningly. “Now, are we going to get a table, or what?”
“Clearly.” He smiled. When she finished, he took both mugs and deposited them back in the kitchen sink, ceramic rattling against metal, then grabbed his brown waxed jacket from the hook next to the door. “Are you going to put shoes on?” he asked through the screen, watching as Luna carefully transfigured her maxi skirt into flowy-looking trousers, cinched at the bottom so she could move around easier.
“And plants? The hanging kind?”
“Correct.”
Greg was standing by a large bay window positioned over the sink, backlit by grey sunlight and casting a long, stretched shadow across the eggshell-coloured tiles. Tiles that probably used to be white, once upon a time. “Backyard’s nice,” he observed, leaning forward, hands clasped behind his back.
Theo shrugged. “They do. Now drink up or you owe me six quid.”
“Good man.” She shivered and brought the towel tighter around herself. “Merlin, what I’d give for a Warming Charm right about now.”
“Not my point.” Harry grinned, then clasped her hand with both of his. “Jesus, ‘Mione, I’m happy for you. I’m so happy for you.”
“No,” Draco said, shaking his head and shutting that idea down immediately. “She’ll get back just fine on her own. She always leaves right before lunch.”
And even if he was, Draco was occupied. He was off the market and in the hands of a boy named Theodore Nott. And that was
“Not today,” Draco echoed quietly, gaze fixed on the water below their dangling feet. It was moving slowly, quietly, like it had all the time in the world to get where it needed to go. Around it the trees quivered, wayward branches swaying to the steady rhythm of the stream.
“Which drawer?” came the response, shouted from the kitchen.
They walked a few more paces, having to step over a mossy, frail-looking log that had probably fallen across the trail centuries ago, and then the house came into view again—as did the figure.
“You—” Harry cut himself off, strangled. “What?”
Harry had been reluctant at first, thinking of Hermione’s shaking hands, but he couldn’t lie to Ron. Not like that. “Yes.”
He nodded. “I just… can’t get over the fact that I’m here right now. With you.” He glanced up, looking almost shy. “Draco from Hogwarts didn’t exactly picture himself ending up as Harry Potter’s date to Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley’s wedding.”
“Thanks.” She wrapped herself in it, holding it around her shoulders like a cape as she made her way back up the jagged slope of the ravine. When she finally reached the top, she asked, “Did the wards really tear?”
“Christ,” Harry said. “You haven’t changed a smidge, have you?”
“Oh, I’ll take those for you,” Lovegood said, snapping her fingers so all of their coats lifted out of their hands and floated out of the room, presumably to a coat rack or hall closet somewhere nearby. Draco watched his go with a sharp pang in his chest, wishing he could be the one snapping his fingers.
“Still,” Draco insisted. Every nerve in his body was buzzing. It felt like he was holding a bone in his hands, one that was plucked from his own skeleton.
Harry snorted lightly. “Don’t flatter yourself. I may have been your mortal enemy, but you weren’t mine.”
Harry’s heart dropped to his knees.
“Small. Definitely small,” Draco answers. He turns his hands so he can lace his fingers through Harry’s. “But there are two floors. The first one has a kitchen with green cupboards, and a living room with a couch and a few armchairs for when the Weasleys visit. The second floor has a bedroom with tall windows and an en suite. With a bath.”
“No.” She smiled all catlike and sly, then tilted her head to peer through Draco’s legs. “That bloody dog’s back again?”
“It’s odd, isn’t it?” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand tighter. “To think that we were mortal enemies less than a decade ago.”
“Yes. Can you come down?”
“Whatever,” Pansy sighed, brushing him off. “A cab is fine, but Draco won’t be happy. He hasn’t gotten used to cars yet.”
Pansy frowned. “After all these years.”
Harry saw flashes of him when his eyes slid closed at night. He saw writhing bodies pressed against brick and sharp eyes cutting through shadows. He heard staggered breathing and shoes scuffling against pavement.
“And I really don’t want to come in, yet here I am asking your permission,” Draco countered witheringly.
“What about your lot,” Ron spoke up then, jerking his head towards Parkinson, who was sitting at the end of the booth in a chair she’d pulled out of nowhere. “How are you getting home?”
“Hm,” Theo hummed blearily, turning the note over in his hands. “Well, it’s a nice addition. I need coffee to process this.”
“As do you.”
“Jesus.” Harry rolled his eyes towards the unusually cloudless night, open and peppered with little silver pinpricks of stars. When he dropped his chin back down he asked, “Luna, you know where we’re going?”
“Not that I’m aware of, no.” Draco stepped up so both of his feet were on the boulder, toes curling around the edge. “Did you not feel the wards tear?” he asked after regaining his balance.
“I just said she’s with Malfoy. Playing fetch,” Harry spat, dropping his hands.
Draco sighed gently, the sound stirring the air in front of them. “I’m thinking about how bizarre this all is.”
“What—?”
Draco paused. “Do you actually have sheep?”
“Nicer than the last place we had.”
“Luna Lovegood,” Pansy greeted back, equally as calm.
Suddenly wide awake, he scrambled to untangle himself from his patterned bedsheets, adrenaline searing through him like a hot knife. It had been years since he’d felt that kind of panic—really, genuinely felt it—and now it came back to him so suddenly it was almost like it’d never left. “Phoebe!” he hissed at the lump of blankets at the foot of the bed, the usual nesting spot of his brown Sheltie. “Phoebe, intruder!”
His foot came down, and a sharp
A shiver spilled over Draco’s shoulders and down his spine. Harry’s face looking up at him was earnest and pleading, the orange light from Draco’s window casting soft lines over his skin.
“Hermione?” he asked through flames when his best friends’ living room came into view fuzzily. It was dark, just barely lit by the grey wash of moonlight through the windows; there were shoes piled in front of the door, blankets thrown carelessly across their familiar Chesterfield sofa, books stacked atop their thick Persian rug. Evidence of what had probably been a warm, quiet evening, not unlike Harry’s.
Lovegood’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, immediately taking the tin from him and cracking the lid open. “Oh, goodness! How kind of you. We’ve been eating apple tart for weeks, so this will definitely be a nice change of pace. And I bet they’ll go perfectly with the wine. Neville?” she called suddenly, turning towards the short hallway. “Neville, everyone’s arrived. Can you grab the bottle opener?”
“No,” Draco conceded. “It wasn’t.” He shifted in his seat again and unfolded his legs, his back arching as he stretched his arms above his head. “What time is it?” he asked through a yawn, and Harry glanced waywardly at the clock above the mantelpiece.
Theo shrugged. “Beats me. I figured that we were the only wizarding house in the area.”
“No, unfortunately,” Neville answered from his place on the carpet in front of the fireplace, half-finished bowl of linguine balanced precariously on his knee. “That would certainly be helpful, but we just have to go off our watches. Although, all the different seminars and lectures start at staggered times during the day, so a bell schedule would be a bit confusing.”
Part of Harry wanted to argue with Malfoy and maybe shove him down said set of stairs, but the other part of him was aching to get this over with and go home after being stuck outside in the cold for so long. He shouldered past Malfoy and stepped into the darkness, feeling around the wall for a railing he could grab onto, but finding nothing but slightly damp brick. Sighing, he kept one hand on the wall and began to slowly make his way down the stairs, making sure to walk in as straight a line as possible to avoid falling flat on his face. Behind him, he could feel Malfoy’s strangely noticeable body heat at the back of his neck like a furnace, bleeding into the darkness. Something smelled strongly of burnt sage.
“Fuck, I am?” Theo copied Draco, touching his own forehead absently. “That ruins things. Here I was thinking I could swagger over to you all smooth and good-looking to seduce you with my rugged charm, but I suppose not. Shit.”
Draco didn’t know what to do with that, so he decided to focus on the least potentially explosive topic in that sentence. “Phoebe?” he asked, cursing himself for sounding so meek.
A lump of dread the size of a bludger lodged itself in the back of Harry’s throat. Mind reeling, heart thumping, he fumbled for his wand on the nightstand and tried not to trip over the too-long legs of his flannel pyjamas. He was nearly a second too late, fingers closing around the rugged holly handle at the exact moment the door to his bedroom clicked and swung all the way open.
His head jerked. “What?”
“Do you need anything? I brought some travel-sized potions with me.” She held up her small leather purse with a sympathetic smile.
“Yes,” Harry agreed emphatically, thankful for the switch of subject. “Yes, we should go. Who’s taking who?”
“Brilliant. Thanks ever so for the invitation.” A Cheshire-esque grin quickly overtook her face. Then, completely changing the subject, she turned back to the game and said forcefully, “Draco, hurry up, it’s your turn.”
“I can tell,” Neville assured him. “You’re sure it was him and not some random blonde bloke who looks like him?”
Potter’s mouth twisted nastily, as if he was bracing himself for another argument, but he stopped halfway through. With what looked like some difficulty, he let his rigid shoulders drop and his head tilt back. “Okay,” he said.
“Just him.”
“Goodnight, Harry,” Draco said as he stepped back from the door, even though they’d already done that part. The hard part.
Harry grinned, feeling warmth unfurl in his stomach. “I thought you might. We should get back.”
I can’t believe I’m just remembering this now. Is that why, then?”
As Theo stumbled away towards the unlit stove, Pansy looked back at Draco sharply. “So, we’re going?”
“Luna will be there, too,” she pointed out.
“Right,” Pansy said slowly, dimples creasing in amusement. “Hello, Harry Potter. You have a lovely home.”
“Yeah?”
and get away from this place. This old, rickety, overgrown place with a young, shiny Malfoy standing in the middle of it all, his arms folded against the brisk chill.
She stood fully, deep blonde hair catching in the light and shining, then began to cross the clearing. Her long cardigan fluttered daintily around her (bare?) feet and made her look all graceful and floaty, like a life-sized fairy or a woodland nymph. The dog followed closely behind her, stepping on her heels like it’d just been doing to Draco.
Hermione touched the crown of her head absently. “I—um, use Charms.”
“Thank you,” Harry told them genuinely as he hung on the doorknob. “I will.”
I’m not leaving without her.”
They both looked lovely, if Draco was being honest; Pansy had worn her favorite pair of black high-waisted flares and a silken blouse under her coat that exposed her neckline, sleek and deliberate. She was dressed like Lovegood’s polar opposite, but in such a way that made them almost complimentary. Like Draco was looking at two sides of the same coin.
She smiled gently and reached out to pat his thigh. “Well, don’t let me stop you.”
He peeked through his fingers. “It’s six in the morning.”
“Jesus,” Harry said, reaching out to take her hand and run his thumb over the raised jewel. It was a deep amber color, not too flashy, but certainly not small. “How did I miss this? Have you been wearing it all evening?”
“Yes.”
“Just curious. Your mother speaks French, too, doesn’t she?”
“Maybe I should go over there more,” he said to no one in particular. Luna hummed a benign agreement and Phoebe wagged her tail, brushing Harry’s dirt-smudged knees and making him smile.
So they got drunk.
Cool hands slide around Harry’s sides; a sharp chin rests on his shoulder.
“And now I’m stopping it. Never bring up Malfoy and bestiality in the same breath ever again.”
Draco went even pinker. “Brilliant,” he said lightly, clearly trying to act casual. “Harry.”
Draco pinches his ear lightly, lovingly. Harry wonders how he got here. “We have to get up tomorrow at six for the Portkey, and while I don’t fancy dragging you there by your feet, I will if I must.”
Harry scowled. “I’ve noticed.”
As the evening fermented and soberness slowly began leaking out of the room, Phoebe lumbered down from upstairs and collapsed at the foot of Harry’s favorite armchair, her chin resting on Malfoy’s feet. Malfoy barely spared her a glance, reaching down to scratch her head almost automatically as if he’d been doing it every day of his life. The sight of that was what prompted Harry to disrupt the ebbing conversation and ask quite carelessly, “What the hell are you all doing here, anyway?”
Malfoy looked at him sharply. “You don’t have wards?”
Harry can’t believe he’s here.
“You think I look good.”
Malfoy was locking the door to the basement when Harry passed back through, herding Phoebe along at his side. Malfoy looked up, gaze haggard, hair hanging limply in front of his forehead, then pressed his mouth tight and looked away. It seemed like he wanted to say something extremely badly, but Harry didn’t want to hear it, whatever it was.
It was odd that Phoebe would wander off over there, but it wasn’t unfathomable; there was a lot for her to sniff around and discover, what with the wild bushes of blackberries and the spindly ferns that overtook the area. She’d probably spent the morning tracking down the squirrels and field mice that liked to hide amid the greenery. Harry told Luna this, and she frowned and said “Poor squirrels.”
“Necromancy,” Luna said. “Paean is healing and Tyche is good fortune.”
For everything.
“No,” Harry agreed as he folded a napkin and set it neatly next to Draco’s place setting, “you don’t.”
“Clearly you’re unaware of our house motto,” Malfoy sniffed. “
“No, not yet.” Malfoy straightened up, shoulders rolling under his dark plum-colored jumper. “We need to see if it worked or not. Try Apparating.”
“Then these ones deserve to be goddesses, too.” Luna smiled, reaching out to stroke one of the tiny chicks on its tiny head. “This one seems like a Hecate, don’t you think?”
“Doable.” Erwin nodded approvingly, then jerked his chin over Harry’s shoulder. “They with you?”
“I don’t! Although it might raise some eyebrows if he died from pneumonia in our backyard.”
a voice chirped in the back of his brain.
Harry’s back straightened, fingers pulling the hems of his sleeves taut. “No, I do have something to say. I just—” He stopped, frustrated.
“A dinner party! It could be fun. I’d love to catch up with them. Neville might be a bit hesitant, but I’m sure I could convince him.”
“Should I leave?”
Harry nodded fervently. “Capiche.”
“Not even a little bit,” he told her, and she grinned.
Whether this marked the end of an era or the beginning of one, he wasn’t sure—all he knew was that, whichever it may be, he and Potter were standing side by side for the first time in his life.
“Luna,” he sighed.
“I think once people become national treasures, they stay that way,” Theo responded, but he sounded thoughtful. “Unless they go and murder someone, or something. They’d have to get their privileges revoked then.”
“Yes. I remember them being silk, with little animals embroidered all over the cape. They were tigers, I think? Or maybe leopards.”
“I remember meeting your mother,” Malfoy said suddenly, softly, and Luna’s eyes flickered open, round and blue in the soft firelight.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Evasion, well done.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile to himself as he flicked the faucet on, rinsing out the jars and letting the cool bite of the tap water on his skin stir him from his half-blurred state. He felt bleary and lightheaded, like he had one foot stuck inside a dream—a dream where Draco Malfoy made him soup and babbled to his dog and refused to use magic. There was no way that was real life.
“Have you had breakfast?” he called to her through the window, leaning over the sink while the dented copper tea kettle began heating up next to him.
Draco thunked his head again, deciding resolutely that this was going to be the longest night of his life.
“It’s Saturday,” Draco interrupted. When Harry continued to stare at him, he rephrased: “Saturday dinner. The thing we’ve been doing for over a month.”
He set off towards the North corner with hazy determination, trying not to let the bleariness from waking up so early deter him. Birds chirped around him jovially, and there was a thin layer of fog ghosting the treetops and obscuring the not-so-distant hillside. The tangled North grove loomed high and mighty over the clearing, the branches of ferns curling outward like skeletal hands that grasped at Harry as he stepped by, clawing at his feet.
“We should talk about him someday. About all of it.”
Malfoy’s pinkish mouth thinned. “In the words of a famous man, I’d like you to leave now.”
“I have three glasses of wine in me, Theo, you cannot hold me accountable for speaking like a plebeian.”
“Hey,” he said instead when he reached the bridge, boards creaking under his shoes as he stepped up.
Hermione’s smile stretched. “Yes, but I didn’t expect you to notice it. You’re not exactly the most observant person.”
Draco rolled his eyes and jutted his pointy chin forward. “We took a vote on who was going to come tonight, and unfortunately I was the victor. We’re checking up on you, Potter.”
“I’ll go grab our coats,” Potter said, and five minutes later he and Draco were standing on the bottom step of the back porch, hands in their pockets, Draco’s foot hovering over his wand.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “That wasn’t so hard.”
He was hallucinating. He had to be. There was no other possible reason that would explain why he was watching Draco fucking Malfoy take the large stick out of Phoebe’s mouth and wield it back like he was about to throw it, then actually threw it. Like he was playing fetch with her. And then she ran after it. Like she was playing fetch with him.
“Luna—” he started, too afraid to move. Too afraid to do anything, really. “What—?”
“He’s bound to catch a nasty cold,” Pansy added, scrunching her nose.
Harry scowled and shoved his hands into his pockets, unwilling to seem even the slightest bit pleased at the sight of another living thing. “You know exactly what I’ve come for. Give me my dog back.”
Draco’s fingers unfurl and he places two under the crook of Harry’s jaw, guiding his head sideways so their gazes can meet. Equally glassy, equally dilated. “I mean homes,” he says, so quiet that Harry wonders if he’s imagined it.
Harry stared at the door. Phoebe panted beside him, her tail swiping his ankles.
“What theory?”
Standing on the threshold between his bedroom and the darkened hallway, her long, floral-patterned maxi skirt brushing the floor, was Luna.
“Lovegood?” Theo gawked from in front of him, coming to a full stop on the edge of the clearing.
thank you so much for reading!! <3 feel free to come hang w/ me on
The muscle above Malfoy’s mouth twitched. “Right, how could I have possibly forgotten.”
“So, she must have known there was something important over there that was linked to you. Some
Draco returned his stare. “Because you’re sick.”
“I’m lost,” Harry said weakly, heart slamming against his ribcage, their words spinning a hurricane in his head. They couldn’t possibly mean—
“Definitely not,” Neville replied, shaking his head. “Even if it was, why would that explain anything?”
He was silent for a long moment, gaze unfocused. Then, unexpectedly, “Is it because of your wand?”
“You’re positive?” Malfoy asked, blinking.
“Yes, there is!” Malfoy leaned over the counter, hair falling in front of his eyes melodramatically. “Why have you been inviting us over? I’ve been trying to figure it out for myself
But, of course, with more alcohol came less sobriety, and after an hour or so, the bar itself became much livelier, enhanced and saturated by the warm liquid running like sweet electricity through Draco’s veins. At one point, a whole obnoxious group of barely-adults had spilled into the venue and cranked up the music, and now there was some sort of dance floor situation happening that he’d somehow been swept into, even though he wasn’t a dancer in any shape or form. Luna was out here with him, as well as Pansy, but she’d been sucked into the crowd a while ago and Draco hadn’t seen her since. Dancing with Luna was fun, though—she clearly didn’t give a rat’s ass about what anyone thought of her, so she danced like someone free. Someone in her element. Draco was certainly far,
Draco Malfoy.
Draco felt everything inside him soften. “I can’t either,” he said quietly, leaning into Harry’s touch. “You’re right, you know. That was the stupidest thing you’ve ever done.”
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asked after a while, running his thumb down Draco’s palm and over his pale wrist.
There was a gruff bark from behind Harry, and he twisted to see his dog standing at the bottom of the stairs, her tail wagging brightly at the appearance of Draco. When he looked back, Draco’s eyebrows had risen even higher, this time with amusement. “Well?”
“How horrible,” she’d cooed, frowning and straightening his collar. “Theo might have something to lend you. Come inside, please.”
He dropped his hands and stared at her pointedly.
He started on the first tree with loose focus, using his bare hands to pluck the ripe, plump apples from their branches and drop them gently into the basket, so they wouldn’t bruise.
“That’s my point!” Malfoy argued. “I’m not going out with you dressed like that. I understand you’re a farmer and everything, but need you let everyone on Earth know that?”
That revelation made it all easier, somehow.
Luna just giggled, and from there, the night pressed onward with a little less tension and a little more ease. Harry realised later on that the self-refilling bottle of daisy wine was also to blame for the significant shift in mood; nearly everyone was tipsy, except for maybe Goyle—Harry couldn’t tell what was going on with him, but he wasn’t causing any fights, and that was good enough.
He laughed a little. “You know there was actually a reason why I invited you here tonight, I did want to talk to you about something but this wasn’t it. I didn’t see this coming but now we’re here maybe it would be nice to talk about this…” He trailed off and then frowned. “Did that even make sense?”
“Sorry for talking your ear off but I appreciate the help. You always make me feel better.” Harry said kindly. “I’ll go back a start on breakfast and see you down there.”
He was still lying on his right side. He rolled over carefully and sat himself up in bed. George helped pulling up the pillows behind him to prop himself up. Harry pulled the covers up to look underneath and assess the damage. He noticed he was just wearing his boxers, he couldn’t remember when they’d undressed him or bandaged him up. His knees were both covered in dressing but other than that his legs looked OK, just a few shallow cuts and scrapes down his left thigh that had been cleaned but left undressed. It was the left side of his chest and stomach that felt sore and had the murtlap soaked bandages stuck to him. He has a few patches on his left arm that were covered up too.
Draco turned around to face Harry and wrapped his arms around him too. “My little Prince?” He questioned.
“You have time for a bath though if you want, it will take about an hour, or later of course, whatever you want but the film is quite long if you still want to watch it after dinner.”  Harry said, returning to his chopping.
Most of the room was white but it had touches of silver and gold everywhere that gave it an opulent feel and reflected the light more. Harry wouldn’t have thought silver and gold would go together like this really and if he’d done it it would have probably looked more like Christmas gone wrong but Draco had achieved an effortless and timeless glamour to the room. It was classy without looking extravagant and it was neither masculine nor feminine in decor really.
going to come back here again you complete and utter reckless moron.” Draco said a bit louder detaching himself slightly from Harry’s neck but still holding him around the waist.
Harry seemed shocked at his surroundings and stood there frozen for a moment. Then he clocked Draco staring at his wand. “It helps me focus my magic in emotional situations… I think.” He mumbled, still frowning at the mess in the lab.
“Hermione not here yet?” Harry asked.
“You sure?” Harry said, wanting to be sure.
When they were all in the front room Draco closed the door behind him and addressed his friends. “Sorry, about that, I’ve never seen him like this before.”
In a much better frame of mind he made good progress on the experimental potion that afternoon even though it would take a couple of days to truly see the fruits of his labour. The afternoon went so quickly that when the green light flashed through the cellar at five o’clock to indicate that it was safe for him to come up it took him by surprise. When he came up the stairs and into the small hallway at the back of the shop he could hear Daphne just finishing warding the front of the shop securely so that people could still window shop but no one would be able to break in. A moment later and Draco felt the magic settle and she came through the door carrying the diary.
Tuesday evening after the news was finished Harry was still a little more quiet than usual.
“You say you were jealous of me with everyone treating me like royalty but that’s how I thought of you, I was jealous of you… The Slytherin prince who lived in a mansion. You were always boasting about everything you had… I thought you were spoilt, I thought you could get everything you wanted. I always had broken toys and hand-me-down clothes, I never had anything of my own… You were always going on about your mum and dad too, I thought they must love you so much to give you everything, I was jealous of the Weasleys too for their big loving family but I knew from Ron that having lots of siblings meant he didn’t always get the attention he wanted. You had two parents all to yourself who could give you all the attention and the affection you wanted and I was jealous of that… But as we got older and I learnt more about your life and your family I realised that it might not be what I thought… and now with what little I do know of you… well I’m guessing things with your parents aren’t great huh?”
After that getting to the box wasn’t too bad. Draco did indeed stay very close behind Harry. So close that he could smell the familiar sandalwood scent that he now associated with the man every time he used it in the cellar. He was also glad to have the excuse to stare right at his arse as Harry climbed the stairs without anyone being able to see him. He used to hate jeans but he decided now that he very much liked them.
He did notice one thing though and that was a sketchbook and some pencils on Draco’s little writing desk. Did Draco draw? The book was closed so he couldn’t see but he really badly wanted to. Then he remembered the beautifully drawn plans for the shop that were framed in Draco’s Diagon Alley office. He had previously assumed they’d been professionally drawn up but what if Draco himself had drawn them?
“Of course not, that would be absurd.” Draco said in his mock scornful voice but Harry could still see his soft smile trying to break through.
“No.” Harry spoke gently and honestly. “I wanted you to be the first.”
“Better put some actual clothes on then I guess, if we’re going to the market.” He said quickly, standing up and walking back into the bedroom area.
“Oh.” Blaise said simply.
Lunch was lovely and Draco knew Blaise was doing it because he cared about Draco and wanted to treat him today but towards the end Draco was getting restless thinking of the difficult task he had ahead of him. How would his father react when Draco told him he had his own plans and he wasn’t going to blindly follow the ‘Malfoy’ way anymore. He wasn’t scared of his father, the worst that would happen was that they would duel and Draco thought he could take the man, even if he was a bit out of practice. He knew that his father wouldn’t kill or seriously harm him as his only heir was too precious to him for that but he might try and keep him in the Manor by force somehow.
Harry flushed faintly with embarrassment as he picked up the backpack and stood up, speaking as he got his bearings. “Yeah sorry I’ve never quite got used to-”
“I, er, fell asleep for a bit.” Harry mumbled completely avoiding Draco’s eye as he sipped the beer.
“Wait, don’t you have plans tonight? It’s Monday... we never spend Monday evenings together.” He pointed out slightly awkwardly.
Surely wizards still need to buy things otherwise why would the Weasleys have a home like the Burrow and the Malfoys have a home like the Manor... They can't just conjure nice furniture or magically build their homes.
“Call him Draco?” Harry suggested, slightly amused.
I didn't want Fred or Harry to come across as 'the bad guy' hopefully you can understand both of their perspectives and what this 'relationship' has been for both of them.
“Not at all.” Harry said stubbornly. It was the least he could do if he was the cause of Fred’s drunken state.
“Yeah I know which is why I don’t know why you got involved with him in the first place!” Ron muttered to himself although not really that quietly.
“I’ve never heard you tell Daphne you love her before.” Draco said after a minute.
“I really like you Draco.” Harry said in the end.
“Noted! Thanks.” Potter said with a little chuckle again. “Erm, do we need to settle the bill now then?”
Potter looked confused but too tired to argue so he did as he was told. Draco opened the door, using the key fob that he always had on his key chain, even on his day off, and went behind the bar.
Surprisingly Draco obeyed and stilled himself still having body contact with Harry but drawing his face back. Harry looked at him lovingly and drew his hand up to trace the side of his face softly.
Turning to his Mother he saw she was tight lipped as always. “Mother, be nice.” He warned just before he walked out the room.
George looked at them and grinned. “Right well I guess that’s my cue to leave. I’ll go give Verity her lunch break seeing as it looks like you’re slacking off this afternoon brother!”
“Harry,” Draco prompted “just say it.” He said with an amused smile.
“Nothing better to do.” Draco shrugged and he became aware that his tone was slightly bitter. Merlin, why had he just admitted to Potter that part of him would rather be working than sit at home alone. That was just great.
The twins did have a small table against their kitchen wall with three chairs where they usually eat dinner but sometimes they liked to cosy up and eat on the sofa too.
“I dunno… Harry?”
Once they’d finished, Harry asked Kreacher if he would clear up and he gestured to Draco to go through into the sitting room.
“Hey!” George said. “I didn’t go out, don't blame me for what he’s done! Also Charlie’s not married, why don’t you badger him about it!”
His wand was visible down the centre pocket and could be drawn with his right hand at a moment's notice. Hopefully the fact that he had his sleeve rolled up slightly would put any suspicions of the dark mark he wore out of someone’s mind as they would probably expect someone hiding it to have their sleeves firmly held right down to the start of their hand. It was a bit of a risky double bluff but the wand holster was charmed securely on and would not budge. It was 100% waterproof too so he wore it all the time even in the shower so he never had to look at the mark either. He’d had it commissioned in Paris a couple of months after he’d arrived and worn it ever since so now it was just part of his arm.
“I know” Blaise sighed, “I’m still sorry though.” He said looking out of the dirty shop front window. “I’ll buy you a whole new wardrobe, I’ll replace it all. What else? Your broom, your books…” He trailed off uncertain.
would want to go and get drunk with his old rival but why would Malfoy want to spend any time with him?
Suddenly the air felt heavy again as it often did when Harry got swept away in these little moments with Draco. It had happened yesterday too before he’d gone to see Teddy. Harry wondered for the millionth time if inviting a man he fancied to live with him was a good idea but he wasn’t going to tell Draco to leave now when he’d confessed how safe and happy he felt here. In fact, Harry was rather hoping that Draco might never leave.
Draco recovers from his attack and gets back into the school routine.
Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d cried but suddenly he was crying about everything. He was crying about the fact that he was lost and lonely and so fucking tired. He was crying about the fact that he just wanted a normal happy life but he didn’t know how to get it. But most of all he was crying about the fact that he’d just allowed himself to believe that he could be happy, he’d just allowed someone in who he thought could be the one and he’d fucked it up already.
Harry dragged himself out of bed for breakfast with the twins and then they went downstairs to the shop but they said they’d check up on him regularly. Verity was in today as well as Graham so they would definitely have the time. They still haven’t quite decided what to do about Graham. George had confessed that they were thinking about letting him go as they didn’t quite have enough work for him every day as they had initially thought but then sometimes it was useful to have him around. Then they said that maybe part time would be better than full time but Fred got the impression that Graham really needed this job so he didn’t have the heart to let him go or reduce his hours.
“So, erm, did you really live in France or is that just part of the secret identity?” Potter asked nervously.
Harry chuckled. “Yes it’s such a shame for me that a devishly handsome single gay man was forced to move into my home for his own safety.”
“Hello darling.” She said happily as she wandered in. “All ready to go?”
Perhaps though he could have one last hook up or maybe something casual. The idea of being Harry’s lover intrigued him, there was no doubt that he wanted to see what was beneath those clothes. He’d been fantasising about the man a lot and definitely would love to have the real thing. Then again, Harry was someone that he actually liked spending time with too and he very much wanted him to be his friend and stay in his life, would sex complicate that?
Fortunately they managed to laugh at the fact that sixth year started with Draco breaking Harry’s nose and leaving Harry on the train and Draco admitted that afterwards he kicked himself for not stealing Harry’s cloak, it could have been useful for him that year. Harry apologised for stalking him but they laughed about that too knowing how obsessed they’d been with each other then and what it had led to now.
“Morning.” Harry replied, turning round to smile at him as he walked through the door.
“The bath was heavenly, I never really saw the appeal but I understand now why you like them.” Harry said smiling “I… appreciated the meditation tips but I still think it’s something I’m not naturally gifted at, I’ll keep trying though. The sprays definitely helped. The chamomile one does help me feel more relaxed and the lavender one makes me sleepy like part of my brain is shutting off, in a good way. When I woke I felt pretty normal again and resprayed them to help me get back off.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at her. “Weren’t we talking about you getting kidnapped?”
s and a million
Draco dropped the card, frowning. “I don’t know. We have to, don’t we? It would be a crime against humanity to turn down an invitation from the Chosen One.”
“Half past six, last I checked. And I used the key under your doormat,” she answered easily, as if the key under the doormat was something she used every day.
“Just like there are too many strings with Potter?” Pansy crooked her eyebrow.
“Inconvenient,” Potter repeated, the corners of his mouth twitching. “I think that might be an understatement given that you’ve been on the run from the Ministry for the past four years.”
“I don’t think we do.”
“I’m not talking about genitalia, Harry,” she said gently, like she was speaking to a very young child. “And, to be fair, he’s been a lot less dickish lately. Don’t you think?”
Harry scrunched his nose, disgusted. “Did you really just make a joke about bestiality?”
es with, now nothing more than a splintered twig in the dirt. One among hundreds.
Harry’s stream of thought was cut off by Draco reaching for the door handle and gently pulling it open, sparing Harry from having to open it himself. A cool, wintery breeze spilled in from outside, sharpening the air and making Draco’s platinum hair whip around his face. “I’ll see you next Saturday?” he asked, turning slightly while keeping his hand firmly on the knob.
“We–” Draco had to swallow the lump in his throat, but it felt permanently stuck there. “We just came to—return the dog.”
But then Draco was gone as quickly as he’d arrived, long coat swishing around his heels as he stepped off the porch and was engulfed by the night. Harry stood at the door, watching in a daze until the other man was nothing but a speck of blonde under the grey, sodium moonlight. Nothing but a stir against the churning shadows of the trees.
