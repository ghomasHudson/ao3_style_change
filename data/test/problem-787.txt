Your tapestry can seem dark when you look at it through the dark lens of the war you survived. It is difficult to start adding bits of colour at first, difficult to see what kind of colour you are adding at all, when your view on life is so dark.
Teddy let out a sigh of relief and immediately felt guilty. Draco was fighting for his life and he wasn’t even man enough to get on a broom and fly to him? These days Draco was the first person to defend Hufflepuff, but Teddy felt like that was quite misplaced now. Not that he wasn’t proud of his house, but his house shouldn’t be proud of him. Not when he took the coward’s way out and trodded to the gates of the Hogwarts grounds to catch the bloody
“I’ve given you a minute!” Victoire hissed back. “Seven minutes to be precise, and I honestly don’t fancy you wetting yourself and becoming a broomcicle before we’re five miles out. Now put those brooms back you wuss, we’re taking the bus.”
“Well then, we’re about to find that out.” Pansy clapped him on the back, and Draco was too busy being confused to notice that Adonis, or Harry, actually, was coming their way. “Good luck, darling. Try not to drool too much.”
“You have a nice singing voice,” Harry whispered as he went to sit behind Draco and wrapped his arms around his chest. Draco put a gentle hand through the messy curls now resting on his shoulder. He loved this about them. That they could banter and bicker and argue all day but when they were both exhausted they just
’d her until the day after. She’d tended to Draco’s wounds as soon as she got out of her haze, though neither of them knew exactly how he’d gotten them. Draco’s occlumency shields had been strong enough to not be mentally present for any of it.
“I did.” Draco nodded. Instinct told him to act aloof around his old rival, but he threw that idea out the window and gave Harry a warm smile. “More than one, actually. I’m a part time nurse now, on the children’s oncology ward. We see all kinds of people there, and they inspire me to write. You can’t say a proper goodbye if you don’t understand what’s going on.”
So, with the jitters of the caffeine still in her system and both kids sound asleep, she took to wandering through the hospital hallways. There was life everywhere, mostly in the shape of anxious parents, restless patients and hurried nurses. Nowhere else she saw the desperation that permanently hung in the air around Draco’s room. It was a relief. A reminder that some people did come out of the hospital alive, and that if they just hoped for that hard enough, maybe Draco would leave that way too.
. And of course he would. What else was he supposed to ask about? Neville honestly didn’t understand why Draco and Ron weren’t better friends. They were the only two people he knew whose solution to so many problems was
.” Draco hissed, the pain of her words and fear that they were true burning in his chest. It was time to leave. He would leave the Burrow at the very least, and the life of this woman if it came to it. He would never allow his son to be among people who treated him like he was his father. They could spit on him for his many mistakes, but Scorpius deserved better than that.
Harry has suspected as much, but it still wasn’t fun to hear. Luna could read people better than anyone he knew, even if she was a bit odd about it and didn’t always realise it herself. Ginny had once told him that it was like Luna thought of herself as though she was a single nice lily drifting in a pond, while really she was as complex and beautiful as the entire garden, pond included. Harry had called Ginny a sap, and in turn he’d been shoved off his chair. It had been a good afternoon.
life. You said yourself, you want to be the teacher you never had as a child, you want to start a dialogue with anyone who still holds those ancient beliefs. Instead of giving them dangerous detentions, you
Harry nodded. “I talked to Molly about what happened. Explained a bit of your situation and all that. And maybe I cornered her, maybe she was still angry, I don’t know, but she said it was no excuse. Children had to listen to their parents and that’s that. Even if the parent isn’t actually their parent but just a grown up. It’s what kids are supposed to do.”
“He’s twitching,” Parkinson answered. It was the first civil word exchanged between them in a very long time. Ginny did not usually like journalists, and Parkinson was no exception. “Which is not exactly a good sign.”
“And I just spent nearly an hour and a half putting your kids to bed.” Draco pointed out as he climbed under the covers. “I have earned every right to complain there is. Now come over here, Potter. I’m cold.”
I have been prone to accidental magical flares in the past. I could feel my magic bubbling up that night - I suppose that was another reason that I didn’t feel like I could get involved. Which seems selfish of me, now that I think about it. I expect you’re going to say that I shouldn’t think like that because it’s beating myself up about it, but I can’t help it. I shouldn’t have cared about protecting the wizarding world when people were being hurt. I should have been able to step in somehow. I don’t think I’ll be able to get away from that thought. If I’d stepped in at the time, I wouldn’t have had the meltdown that I did and the Ministry wouldn’t have felt the need to get involved. I’m sorry, now I sound like I’m not grateful for your help - I am, I truly am. I’m just writing as I think again.
“It’s my pleasure,” Neville commented while his brain was a million miles away. When a friend broke his leg, it was easy to think of what to do. Scold Harry for being a reckless flier and then take him to the hospital wing. But this…
Harry walked backwards into the room, two giant IKEA bags in each hand. Half of the furniture of each Weasley came from the Swedish store ever since Hermione had brought Mr Weasley there as a birthday gift. They still weren’t sure if that had been an awful or a brilliant idea. “Ha bloody ha, Draco. It’s not all food.” Harry lifted one of the bags, the one that looked the heaviest, and put it on the bedside table with a loud thud. “This is the food. The rest is blankets and clothing and books and all that. And Ron said your mother is gathering things for Scorpius as we speak, so he’ll have everything he needs when he wakes up.”
But Draco was in no state to rant now, Teddy saw as they quietly went to stand besides aunt Hermione and Pansy. The women noticed them, but stayed quiet. All four were too absorbed by the sight behind the glass. Seeing Draco lie there, between Harry and Narcissa, suddenly reminded Teddy of how young he was. Only thirty one. A lot compared to fourteen, but nothing in the grand scheme of things. Despite the ashy grey look of his skin Draco looked so very young. The sight reminded him of the few pictures he still had of his mother. Of what he imagined she’d looked like after her death.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Harry watch the exchange with fascination. The man had never understood Draco’s relationship with his mother, but he liked to look at it anyway.
“Anything for you.” Harry kissed him again, properly this time. “Anything to make this the best Halloween I can give you.”
When Harry caught sight of Draco, the noise he made perfectly reflected the inexpressible need Neville felt to comfort the blond man. Seconds later, Harry carefully wrapped Draco in his arms, but his eyes went back to Neville.
But she did break the silence and got me help. Discreet help, help my father did not know about, help no one but her and my therapist knew about, but help nonetheless. That is what people who care for you should have done. And I am sure that some of them simply did not know how to see the signs, but I do not believe no one noticed it. Dumbledore knew it at the very least.
“Domestic violence is illegal, Harry.” Draco snorted. He knew he was deflecting, using his self deprecating humour to avoid giving a serious response, but it was late, he was tired, and all this bettering himself crap sucked the life out of him. He knew that if he didn’t fight it, he’d end up in a bad place, but fighting every day without a permanent victory in sight was depressing. “And self-harm isn’t healthy.”
I admire your ability to do the work you do without being affected by everything you hear. I don’t think I’d be able to do it - I tend to pin my heart to my sleeve and that sometimes backfires on me. It certainly did in fifth year, when I lost my godfather. I still feel like it was because of me that he died and that’s… tough to take.
Draco hadn’t had many panic attacks when Harry was there. Usually the other man calmed him down before things got that far. Still, it had happened a few times and Harry hadn’t forgotten about how to deal with them. He removed the suffocating blankets and pulled Draco up, letting him rest sideways on his chest while Harry began to rub his back. No doubt a tip he’d gotten from his mother.
“I’m sure that’s not true, Draco.” Neville put an arm around Draco and held him close. Then he added, just to get a rise out of Draco, “Last time I checked our potions professor was pretty nice too.”
“I love Harry, you know? But he’s about as delicate as a brick wall. And I don’t-, I mean, you know this side of me. He doesn’t. I don’t want him to-”
To his own surprise, he could see his hands were shaking when he put the kettle on. In all the hectics, his body hadn’t been allowed to respond to the shock of his best friend showing up at his doorstep with a recording of his dark, close to suicidal thoughts. That didn’t exactly happen on a daily basis.
, the responsible Healer in training, working twice as hard to earn his spot due to his past, always polite and professional. The last time someone had made him a cup of tea outside of work, or made him dinner, had been…
“You’re right, Scorp. I’m sorry.” Draco shot his son an apologetic look. It was true. If he was going to teach his son consent, the least he could do was live by his own rules. Harry just chuckled. When Scorpius nodded, content with his response, and moved out of the way, Draco turned back to Harry. “Harry James Potter, will you please kiss me?”
Harry kissed him, from his neck all the way to his nose. He chuckled when it wrinkled. “We can stay home today. You can meet my family later, in small doses. I’ll tell them to behave.”
Scorpius nodded, more because Draco’s tone of voice didn’t really allow for an argument. Draco knew that was the case and he hated it when his voice got like that. It was necessary now though. Who knew how angry and close on their tail Harry would be. So Draco stepped in the floo once more, and left Harry’s place.
“No I won’t have to come into work if they fucking sack me!” Draco yelled at Harry before the man was done talking. His adrenaline was at an all-time high and it wouldn’t surprise him if he’d get a panic attack soon, which he really couldn’t use right now because that would make him even
I am welcome with you, not because of pain or guilt or anything, but because you want me to meet your family. Because you want me in your life. I can literally feel that in my bones, okay? So don’t be an idiot and stop panicking.”
His mother was more than a little surprised to see him, but she asked no questions when she saw the look on Draco’s face. It was one of her many great qualities, to know when to act instead of talk. Together they quickly managed to temporarily distract Scorpius with cake and a couple of nifty house elf magic tricks so Draco could have a moment for himself before talking to his son about the incident.
“Your mother told me where you were.” Draco was so far gone in his panic attack he didn’t even hear Harry’s words, nor did he notice that he had climbed onto the bed. “Oh Draco, don’t do this to yourself.”
“But you have to wake up first, darling.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. New tears had found their way onto his cheeks. He didn’t bother wiping them away. “Wake up, Draco. Please.”
Somehow though, along the way, Harry had lost sight of that dream. His job demanded more, Draco started making an issue about Harry’s many hospital visits, a couple of big undercover cases forced them apart for a few weeks and somehow the dream had faded from Harry’s mind.
. It became a reflex after being a parent for a few years. “And by saying ‘half’ I’m being generous.”
Draco couldn’t find it in himself to say anything, so he just nodded and kissed his wife’s hand. He tried to make her comfortable and warm while she was dying, though it was a losing battle. Her death was not of the peaceful kind. Nor was the grieving process that followed, or the endless nights when Scorpius couldn’t stop asking for his mum.
There are some less-than-happy thoughts in this one, but i kinda feel like revealing that now would take out the punch? so I put it in the notes at the bottom, if you wanna know you can scroll down before reading
And after those last words, Ginny turned around and continued on her way, leaving a quite baffled Draco in her wake.
Dumbledore knew what Voldemort was making you do and that he didn’t lift a finger to help. Things can get complicated during a war, but you don’t let children take the brunt of that if you can in any way prevent it. And I know how shitty it is when it happens anyway, but at least I got help when you didn’t. And I don’t think that’s fair.”
“You’re right, I’m sorry. I-,” the words got stuck in his throat as he was overwhelmed with a feeling of
“Malfoy! I thought I saw something pointy walking around outside,” Potter’s greeting was warm, though his words did not reflect that. Draco declared himself mad once again for ever stepping into this coffee shop in the first place. It had been pure luck when he’d walked past it and saw none other than Potter behind the counter, but he only had himself to blame for still going in after that.
“Albus, I want you to go get Dad. Floo Auntie Hermione and Uncle Ron, they’ll know what to do.” The voice of James sounded so far away, even though the kid was speaking right next to his ear. Draco was at a loss with his mental state now. Everything seemed covered in fog, yet his emotions were sharp as knives, the panic clawing at him, drowning him because
, Draco, for following me into that place. You of all people should know what a bad idea that is.” Harry reached for Draco’s free hand and squeezed his fingers. “I know why you did it, though. I know you still feel like you need to prove yourself to be worthy of me. But that’s bullshit, Draco. If there has ever been an undeserving person in this relationship it’s me. I’m the messy one with the fucked up childhood and the terrible habits and bad manners. That’s me, all of that is me. Without you I would be so much worse off, and you so much better. But sod all that, I still want to be with you. I want to annoy you by getting up too early on sundays, drinking too much firewhiskey, bringing my work home, stealing your jumpers, nicking your hair ties. I want to wake up next to you every morning and see your messy bedhead. I want to fall asleep together again. I want to wait two hours before you’re finally ready to go out. I want all of it, Draco.” He took a deep shaky breath before adding his last words. “Please wake up.”
Draco fell silent then, but something told Harry his story wasn’t over. “The things they did… I was captivated by it. Terrified and fascinated. I wanted to belong so badly back then. But when I didn’t fit in, my father…. He cast me out. Some ancient warding demons rite, in our seventh year. He knew I was…
and beckoned her to come in. He put a fresh silencing charm around Scorp’s head and sat up. Despite having been asleep moments before, he was wide awake now. Especially now, when his son was once again in the middle of the situation that had made him touch shy in the first place, Draco wasn’t backing down from his principles.
His vision started going in and out of focus. A nurse stopped by and tried to calm him down, first with words and then with calming draught but the first didn’t work and the second he refused. Calming draught felt like a straight jacket, forcing his panic down in a way that somehow only made it feel worse. James had left his lap at some point, and to his shame Draco had to say he wasn’t sure where he’d gone off to.
“Harry is in the kitchen making a fry up.” Draco lifted his head to see his son in the doorway, a steaming plate in his tiny hands. “He asked me to bring you breakfast,” Scorpius said as he walked into the bedroom. He didn’t climb on the bed like usual, though. Instead he put the plate on the nightstand and stayed right where he was. “Can I join you, Daddy?”
“I know.” Draco scooted closer and guided Harry’s head towards the crook of his neck. “But that doesn’t mean I can meet your family today. I thought I could, but the pain gets worse when I’m insecure and they’ll be with many and especially today… I don’t think I can bear it.”
“I fear that.” Draco looked at his knees, just like his son did when he was saying difficult things. “I don't want him to adore or follow me. I'm not exactly a good example to live up to.”
“No, no, Daddy, you have to ask!” Scorpius hopped between them before anything could happen, shooting a firm look at both his dad and Harry. “When you do something with or to other people, you always have to ask.”
, somehow, even though he didn’t actually feel anything. He was just afloat. Heavy and afloat, and nothing and something, and dark and light at the same time and it was driving him around a bend that wasn’t there because there was
Giving them a few minutes, she picked up her order pad and made her way back to the booth to take their order. By the time she reached them, she couldn’t sense any awkwardness, just an air of hopefulness.
“Then we’ll get you some toast,” Harry promised as they entered one of the patient’s rooms. It looked exactly like the room he’d lost Astoria in, and the room where he’d almost lost his son in the months after that. Suddenly it hit him again that this was all
“Because Uncle Harry wants Draco to wake up sweetie.” Her dad smiled a very sad smile at her as he bend down to pick her up. Rose wanted to squeal, she loved being just as high as her dad, but she didn’t. Sad people wouldn’t like squealing, she thought. “Draco was hurt so his body went into a very deep sleep, but now he won’t wake up anymore.”
I'm not sure if I can manage an update next week, I have a fest deadline coming up and the next part isn't finished yet. and afetr that I'm going to paris so I can promise an update within 1-2.5 weeks, but it will probably only be 1 update. After that I am free for a week though, so hopefully I'll be back on track then!
He was too tired to keep clawing at something that wasn’t there. He wanted something to be there. But if nothing came any time soon, he would cease the fight. There was only so much energy one could gather from fleeting thoughts and an empty
Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. He didn’t know how Mrs Weasley meant it. Would she cling to her old ways because they made her feel useful, and did she expect Draco to grant her that pleasure? Or had she only just acknowledged this was the reason behind her actions, and did that mean she was willing to change?
I knew you would say that. I can’t help it though, it’s how I’ve always been. I try not to, but it doesn’t always work.
I’m also glad that I haven’t confused things too much by jumping back and forth in my letters. I find it much easier to write as I’m thinking and then worry later about whether I’m making sense. I’d like to think I’m not this chaotic in an actual conversation, but you’d have to ask my friends about that. I like your handwriting, by the way. It’s much nicer to look at than mine.
“Draco, you’re awake!” Harry wiped his hands on his apron, which really shouldn’t look sexy on him, yet still did, and walked towards him. “Please ditch those robes. You don’t have to come into work today. I-”
He could tell Harry was grinning in the crook of his neck when he felt his beard hairs move across his skin. It was an amazing feeling. And though it didn’t fix everything, knowing that he still had Harry made everything that much less difficult to bear.
And revealing magic to muggles is never a good idea. Some take it well, but a lot of them are terrified of the unknown and can get violent, plus the harm of a botched obliviation job is quite severe and more common than you might think. Not stepping in in this case prevented hurt rather than caused it.
“I won’t deny that.” Kingsley sighed and watched Hermione walk away. She was special, that one. Relentlessly hard working, like only the really good politicians were. He turned back to the window, looking at the sick man in bed. Draco Malfoy was hard working too. The special kind of hard working. It had taken him a while to see it, see past his teenage mistakes, see his true remorse.
Your situation does sound very like my own. During an argument with my rival once, I used an unfamiliar spell - I had no idea what it did - and did a lot of damage. I was horrified at myself, and I had no idea how to help him. I regret that moment every day. It’s one of the things I desperately want to apologise to him for. I never got the chance at school - not that I think he would have accepted it and I wouldn’t have blamed him at all. I don’t think he’d have even believed me that I didn’t use the spell with the intention of harming him.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He’d slept at Harry’s place for nearly two months now, but today he didn’t quite feel like going there. Luckily, his mother answered for him.
“I sold myself so I could eat. It’s the only thing I knew I could do. My father spoke about it each time I disappointed him, like some kind of threat. But there was a lot that I didn’t know and it took me years to stop being used like that and find a proper job.” Harry had frozen in his arms, and now pulled back with a look of horror on his face. Draco swallowed, and forced himself to keep talking. “At twenty six, this was my first proper job. Before that I was a prostitute, but for the work I did that sounds like too nice a term.”
he wakes up, I promise I will never be this careless again. I will keep him safe, warm, loved. I promise. I’m so so sorry.”
I am glad you told me about your Dreamless sleep habit. My mother has a history of addiction with those so I never took them, but I do have experiences with people close to me taking them because of that. She says it helps her if she does something active before bed like jogging, and then reads a peaceful book until she falls asleep. Another tip would be a white noise machine, they make it easier to fall asleep and calm your mind for some, though others absolutely hate them. You have to find out and see what works for you.
“I said he looked famished and exhausted, I never said alive and well,” he snapped, pissed that his friends didn’t have his back. “Look, all I want is for you two to ask around to see if anyone knows how to contact him. He left a book in my shop, and I’d like to know that he didn’t faint somewhere or fall in front of a tube in the underground, alright?”
. “Fuck me sideways, Pans. I just can’t, that guy is going to kill me and he doesn’t even know I exist.”
“And not your responsibility, Harry.” Hermione’s eyes softened, though she still didn’t seem happy about the current topic of conversation.
I would really like to stop taking the Dreamless Sleep. I don’t remember the last time I had a nice dream (I imagine it was some time before fifth year). I think there’s some truth to activity before bed helping with sleep. I never had trouble sleeping after Quidditch practice at school. Perhaps I’ll try going for a little jog around the park near my house some time. I quite like the sound of a white noise machine - silence allows my thoughts to take over, which I suppose is why I take the Dreamless Sleep. My street is surprisingly quiet at night.
Might have written the ending a tad drunk. Hope t doesnt affect the spelling too badly. Please let me know if you enjoyed it<3
Draco chuckled. “The wording gave you away. The fierceness of that little speech was all you, though.” Draco searched for Harry’s hand under the duvet, only found his hip, and decided to just squeeze that. “And I still know you mean those words, so it doesn’t matter that they weren’t your own. We all have our-,”
Remembering and honouring the dead had a little something, a place to lighten the mood, relive the inside jokes you used to share, trying to make a funeral a celebration of the life lived, not the mourning of a death. Forgetting for a moment that the one you’re trying to amuse is a flicker of a spirit above at best, just a memory at worst.
Scorpius didn’t respond for a very long time, but Draco waited patiently until he was willing to look up.
My mother, however, never left my side. She is the one who got me that therapist at fourteen. It had never been spoken about until then, my father just said my mother was often tired and did not enjoy the outdoors, but when I was fourteen I found out that she was ill. To be precise, she was depressed, had been for years, and she had wanted to shield me from it by keeping it silent. Once she started to see the signs in me though, she pulled me aside and told me everything. Well, most things. I was only fourteen at the time, and she did not want to give me any ideas.
Draco’s smile had something nostalgic as he thought of that, before he shook his head and turned back to the present. “You did good by telling her to let you go.”
“No,” Draco said resolutely as he turned his back on Harry and crawled deeper into the impossibly comfortable bed. “Now fuck off. I hate you.”
The stern look that went with the last of her words had Draco mute for several seconds as Molly walked off with his son. This was only their second meal at the Burrow. The first had been a while back on, New Year’s eve, but Scorpius had fallen asleep by ten, providing an excellent excuse to leave early. They had no such luck now, as Ron’s birthday party had started in the early afternoon.
to earn his place in the world, even though he’d been hurt and abused more than almost any of the people on the light side. He got spat on by people who had no idea about what he’d been through. People who didn’t even deserve to be in the same
“He’s twitching.” Pansy replied, her voice hoarse and soft. “He’s been doing that for two hours now.”
Today had been one of those days, which meant she wouldn’t be able to sleep for another few hours even though she was done with work. However much she would have wanted to drop everything and stay at St. Mungo’s as soon as she heard of Draco’s accident, she simply couldn’t. She had two small kids to look after who didn’t fully understand what was going on, though little Rosie came close. She had a ministry department to run, legal affairs would be a mess without her.
“I actually quite fancy going to sleep now,” Harry announced after falling backwards onto the bed. “This is comfy.”
. That this wasn’t some sort of nightmare, but that he was actually back at St Mungo's while Scorpius had to fight for his life yet
He wouldn’t say he was close with the man, but Malfoy’s boyfriend was by far his best Auror he had, and the things Malfoy had done for queer rights in the magical world had left him in awe. It had been Malfoy who’d dug out and dusted off the many accounts of same-sex relationships in the old, really old, days. Relationships between ancient pureblood families still in the Wizengamot today. A brilliant move. No proper pure-blood would ever speak evil of their ancestors, and with the powerful voice of the old pureblood families behind their cause, same-sex marriage had been approved as a new right within a year.
He didn’t think he’d ever go back to any parts of his old life. Ten years after his exile, his sentence ended and he was allowed back into magical Britain. Immediately he was scouted by the newfound Muggle Integration Department from the ministry of magic, founded by none other than Arthur Weasley and now run by Dennis Creevey. Life had really started looking up after that.
Neville didn’t really know how to respond to that, so he stumbled back inside and mumbled something about ‘making more tea’. Maybe he too, was more like Ron than he thought.
“You just think that because I’m being nice to you.” Draco muttered. He hid his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. These weren’t the types of conversations he liked to have face to face. In fact these weren’t the kind of conversations he liked to have, period. “All I’m saying is, even if it wasn’t my fault, I’m still sorry about what happened at the Burrow. Wherever I go friction and conflict follows and that might not always be my fault but I’m definitely not innocent in this game.”
“Night, Draco,” Harry whispered, putting an exhausted smile on Draco’s face. “And just so you know, you are a brilliant dad, to more kids than just Scorpius, and don’t you forget it.”
If I had not had my therapist when I was fourteen, I would not have accepted one when I was eighteen. I would have blamed my mental problems on myself, would have shut everything out, let things rot and ended up dead within a year. Shutting up and ignoring your problems will not restore the chemical imbalance in your brain. Being surrounded by good things and love and friends and a fuckton of puppies will not stop your trauma from being traumatising. Walking around on a broken leg while screaming that you are fine will not heal your bones.
He should have cared, should not have treated you like a bloody string puppet in this weird play that he made of the war. He knew I had been tasked to murder him under the threat of losing my life and Voldemort killing my parents, and he never did a single thing except offer an empty promise on top of the astronomy tower. I already did not like him because of that, though I understood because I had not exactly been a model student, but the lack of help to you is the icing on a very crap cake.
I hoped you guys liked this! It's short again, but i feel like the draco POV just doesn't lend itself to anything longer. Next instalment will be more than this.
Draco had stepped around the table before Harry broke down because he had already seen the inevitable in his eyes. It wasn’t all that rare in his line of work. But what did surprise him was how Harry melted into his hug like he’d been starved for that kind of touch.
did choose to have you one way or another. When you sign up for a kid, you sign up for giving them love.
“If I may be so free to offer, I’ve finished remodeling the south wing and I would like to know exactly how comfortable the beds are.” His mother smiled at him as Draco rolled his eyes. Sometimes she was blatantly obvious in her ways, which Draco suspected was a way to save mental energy as she knew no one would ever say no to her anyway. “They’re big enough for three, I think.”
“Yes, Mother.” Draco sighed, happy that in all the turmoil at least he could always count on having his mother at his side. “I’ll eat my cake.”
Narcissa stayed silent, her breathing slow and steady. Harry took a deep breath, tore his gaze away from her, and winced. However much it hurt to look at Draco’s mother, looking at her son was way worse. His pale cheeks, firmly closed eyes, greyish skin tone, expressionless face…
him. But with friends like Draco and Harry, it was hard to forget. “I mean it, you know? This never would have happened without you.”
, that his fever is through the roof and that he came into work despite being sick. The only reason he’s going home now is because
“If your grandmother says so, then I guess we are.” Draco said carefully as he watched Harry. He could have dropped the care, because the most brilliant smile appeared on Harry’s face. So far they’d only slept with three in one bed after Scorpius had a nightmare, they’d never started out like that. But Harry was clearly just as excited about the idea as Scorpius was. “Alright, Scorp. Let’s get you into bed then.”
. You cannot change your whole life overnight, and you cannot change your past at all, but what you can do, baby step by baby step, is change the way you see your life and the things that happened to you. Change your lens.
“It’s…” Draco was at a loss for words. “It’s-, it’s wonderful,” he stuttered eventually, as he pulled Harry into a giant bear hug. “I love you.”
This time around though, he didn’t mind that caring nature. He hadn’t been looking forward to a nightshift filled with coffee, pepper-up and clogged sinuses. Being back in bed sounded like heaven, though the desk was a wonderful substitute. Already he couldn’t fight hard enough to get his eyes back open. Not even when he heard quick, angry footsteps approach.
“He’s really quite sad when he thinks no one is looking,” Luna continued, her eyes studying the grain of the wood she sat on. “Tries to run from it, sometimes. But he’s never fast enough.”
Despite the events from the previous day, Draco felt quite happy once he stepped into the floo to the leaky. Harry followed right behind him but due to the crowd and the many things they needed to get before apparating to a Muggle shop for the rest of their purchasing, they decided to split up and meet again in an hour. Draco was just about to enter the apothecary when someone grabbed his arm.
“He’s not going to leave you over this.” Neville interrupted before Draco could go there. He truly didn’t understand how either Harry or Draco could ever think the other would leave them. Neville had never seen two people with more chemistry together. They weren’t like orchids, needing the exact right circumstances in order to grow. They were more like grass, everywhere, inevitable to turn up on every patch of land no matter how barren or battered.
But despite the comfort, he still jolted out of bed when he woke up and realised he was an hour late for his next shift already. He ran downstairs, stuffing his arms in his Healer robes while hoping that he still had a banana left to serve as quick breakfast.
“He loves you, you know? Never shut up about it. Keeps inserting you into the conversation every ten minutes and I can’t even hate him for shoving his happiness in my face because he doesn’t even notice he’s doing it.” George let out a dry chuckle and patted Harry on the back. “That’s just how he is, Harry. No matter what happens, he will always love you. Not a single thing in the world can change that.”
“Don’t mention it, son,” his mother replied, a tiny cheeky smile on her lips. “Now let’s go and eat some cake. You look-,”
Now, sitting at Draco’s bedside, clutching his lover’s hand, he couldn’t believe how he’d ever let that happen. How he’d managed to lose sight of everything. He’d been so focussed on… on… well, on what, actually? His job, saving the world, ticking things off on his ever growing to-do list. He wasn’t even sure. He just knew he was never going to let it happen again.
“No,” a conspiratory smile crept onto Potter’s face. “Join me for Christmas dinner and try it out. It’s a small affair, just me, Ron, ‘Mione, Luna, Ginny, and Nev. I promise no one will bite your head off.”
Draco pushed past a gaping Harry and the stunned Weasley clan in the hallway and was swallowed by the floo before anyone could utter a single word.
“What?” Pansy undoubtedly raised an eyebrow behind her huge sunglasses. Draco had already put his on his head, giving a new, improved look to his already very nice hair. They were inside now, after all, in some pub with a live band.
“I’m sure Harry would outclass me in a heartbeat if he were here.” Neville replied without doubt. The love Harry felt for Draco was almost too pure to watch. Of course, most of the time they bickered and dared each other to stupid competitions that gave a very entertained Head Student Teddy Lupin an excuse to give their professors detention. But when it really mattered, when push came to shove, there wasn’t a purer love in the world that the one between those two. They just
“Don’t worry, Rudolph,” he chuckled, softly booping Draco’s nose. It was sad, really, that Draco didn’t have anyone but him to drag him back to bed when he was sick. The once so popular Malfoy heir was quite alone now, and Harry couldn’t stand it. Too many Christmases he’d been left in his cupboard begging for scraps. No one deserved that, whether they had someone terrorising them or if they terrorised themselves. “I’ll make you part of my pack if the other reindeer won’t have you.”
“It wasn’t really an argument.” Harry said as he reluctantly sat up again, looking grumpy about needing to adult. “But Molly watches my kids a lot, and lately I’ve been getting the impression that she thinks they, or mostly James and Albus, act out because I don’t discipline them. Or not enough, at any rate.”
“Don’t apologise for having panic attacks, you idiot.” Harry lightly punched him in the ribs, before kissing the top of his head. “Just be glad Ginny made me drop off the kids at Andromeda’s place, because she knew Andy would keep me hostage with tea until I calmed down. I might have still been mad at you if that hadn’t happened.”
Draco bit his tongue and cursed himself. Why was talking so difficult? And why couldn’t he leave his bloody arrogance at the door? He thought he’d lost it when his father kicked him out for ‘disagreeing with the family traditions’, but apparently not.
me! It’s true and you know it. Malfoy was a dick alright, but that’s not a crime, and no reason for Hogwarts or the Ministry to fail him like they did.”
Parkinson wasn’t even offended by the mild insult to her friend. She just leaned into her touch and sobbed on her shoulder. It would leave makeup stains, but Ginny didn’t care. She just hugged the other woman back and prayed to every god she knew that Malfoy would wake up.
,” he uttered softly, for what was probably the first time in years. The floo had brought him back to Harry’s house. The house he basically lived in now, but he thoroughly doubted he’d still be welcome there after the scene at the Burrow. Not that he regretted his words. Not yet, anyway.
, when his head shot up and he saw the huge grin on Pansy’s face, combined with a scribbled on beermat. “You
“When you were a child. When I was fourteen I believed a million stupid things, and I was surrounded by brilliant people. You’re still a good person if you have to work a little harder to achieve it than others. Maybe that makes you even better,
Casting a glance over her shoulder, she could see Harry and Draco deep in conversation. If she wasn’t mistaken, they were sitting closer than they had been previously. Aurora was still perched on the table in front of them. Her paws were tucked under her and she was purring contentedly, with both Harry and Draco stroking her fur.
I testified for my rival and his family after the war. It helped them avoid Azkaban and there’s not a day goes by that I regret my decision to testify. Some people thought I was mad to do it, told me that I should let them rot in prison but if I’d let that happen, I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself. We might not have seen eye to eye, but he didn’t deserve Azkaban. He wasn’t evil. I’d like to think if we met now, we’d be able to shake hands and maybe even become friends.
That had stopped after the funeral. Draco knew Scorpius didn’t fully understand what had happened to his mother, but by then he’d realised that asking for her wouldn’t bring her back. After that, they both grieved more silently, spending hours together in the sun on Astoria’s favourite garden bench, with Scorpius never leaving Draco’s lap. Those had been the saddest, yet somehow also the most blissfully happy days of Draco’s life. And Merlin knew he’d needed them, given what came after.
, but he was cute. He had a buzzcut on the left side of his face, and the rest of his long, messy black hair was swept to the right. It looked too soft to be legal, especially when he smiled again and Draco saw he had
Maybe he was a decent public hero, but to the people close to him, the ones that really mattered, he just brought pain. Every time he watched Molly’s silent tears, the cries of Mrs Malfoy or Ron trying to keep it together with all his might while Luna seemed completely lost in dark thoughts, he knew it was all his fault.
into each other, being nothing if not soft and sappy together. “And you're an amazing father to him.”
Maybe this would be the last straw for him. Which would mean that Scorpius couldn’t play with Harry’s kids anymore, which would leave the kid heartbroken, probably angry with his dad for making his life even more shit.
Draco sighed as he opened a second tub of ice cream. Harry had known how busy he would be; Draco had even told him to bugger off and find someone who actually had time for him, but Harry wouldn’t hear it. And when Draco had told him he lacked the energy for dating a few weeks after that last evening, he’d been so bloody
I’m going to confess that I cried while reading your comparison of life to a tapestry. It makes so much sense in my head that I couldn’t stop myself (I didn’t sob - just some silent tears falling). My life, well, it hasn’t been easy. I’ve never wanted people to feel sorry for me, or anything like that, but - this is something that will probably let you guess my name - I didn’t grow up in the wizarding world. I was kept away from everything I know (and take for granted) now. If I think of my life as a tapestry… it started out as dark as it could possibly be. When I received my letter, I can pinpoint that moment as an explosion of colour - bright, bright colours that I associate with one of the happiest moments of my life.
“You protected your son. I might have done worse in your position.” Harry pushed a stray strand of hair out of his face, before quietly rubbing circles on his back again. They sat like that in the quiet of the guest bedroom for a few minutes before Harry spoke again.
“Probably, yes.” Draco stepped back and tugged on his arm. “Now come on, big man. I’d like to sleep for a bit and we can’t start without you.”
tea, and he was probably going to make him some love as well later that night if the emergency floo call hadn’t put an end to things.
“I’m a herbologist, Draco. My knowledge only goes so far. But it sounds to me like maybe you need a therapist.” It was a touchy subject. Really, it was the only thing Neville remembered ever having an argument about with Draco. It had been back when he’d first started teaching, when they’d shared a bed because the nightmares turned Draco into a full-blown insomniac. The memories clinging to the castle walls were too much for him in the first months.
“Did Molly scare you?” Suddenly two strong arms wrapped around him from behind and he had a head leaning on his shoulder. Harry, current boyfriend and forever pain in the arse, was the reason he was there at all, making awkward small talk with people he either barely knew or had hated as a child. Thankfully that was well behind him now, but it didn’t mean he was having a great time.
I’ve watched my best friend suffer under his stupidity and impulsiveness. He’s nice to the world, but he’s terrible to his lover, and I am left to pick up the goddamn pieces every time. And if there are no pieces left to pick up this time, I swear to Circe’s pierced clit that you’ll find your precious saviour flayed alive and pickled on your doorstep,
“Of course,” Draco replied. Harry squeezed his hand one more time before exiting the room, leaving Draco alone with his son. Draco turned his face towards him, studying his skin, his bluish lips, his slowly moving chest. He thought of last time this had happened, the unexpected symptoms of the curse, the many healers constantly prodding and poking his son as if he was some sort of doll….
Draco finally sat up when he heard that. He looked down at the man in his bed with wonder. Looked at his badly trimmed beard, his lively green eyes, the serious expression on his face,
My name is definitely not Pansy Parkinson, as I’m sure you know by now. (I, too, am replying while reading so don’t know your name yet.) My friends know me quite well, but even they don’t know everything about me. I don’t know why, but there are some things that I’ve kept quite private over the years. They might feel disappointed that I haven’t been able to confide in them, but they’re thoughts that I’m still getting used to myself. I will tell them when I’m ready, I can promise that.
I know I waited until the last moment of my letter, but signing with my name lifted another weight off my shoulders. Knowing that I can speak freely helps a lot - as I think you’ve probably seen in the paragraphs above. I hope I’m not rambling too much. I don’t think you’ll break the rules even though you know my name now. You’re good at your job, and I think that must mean you don’t break the rules so I trust you.
“What do I do, Neville?” The question made Neville look back at Harry, who looked quite lost. “It’s not that I blame him for coming to you but…. How do I help him when I don’t know what’s wrong?”
Albus had joined him back there though, and coaxed him out as Lily pounced on James to distract him. All in all, the Potter kids had been nothing short of a blessing, teaching Scorpius how to be a kid again while Harry taught Draco how to relax and smile for more than two seconds. At first by putting his fingers on the corners of Draco’s mouth and pushing them up, and later with dumb inside jokes and soft kisses.
I have no intention of throwing any of your letters out. I want to implore you not to ask your superiors to assign me someone else - but I know that’s your choice, just as you reminded me I was free to ask for someone else. I… I would really like to continue writing to you. I would like it even better if we could, perhaps, meet? For a drink - not wine - or lunch?
Still, he held his focus firmly on Draco’s face as he approached the bed, getting ready for another kiss. He wanted it to work so desperately, every fiber of his being thrummed with it. But still he halted just before their lips would brush. Something about this felt too final to do it without saying anything.
he was forced to choose between murdering him or having him and his family killed and never seriously tried to help him. So whose responsibility is it then? His dead father maybe? Or his mother who’s still exiled to France? Because I don’t see anyone else giving a damn.”
Draco’s face grew even harder, and his eyes and voice were now icy cold. “Body language is also a thing.”
Harry got a thoughtful look on his face, and for a moment Draco feared he would suggest something stupid like a holiday or a sauna visit or a massage. As if he could ever relax during those things when he still had Scorpius to worry about. But instead Harry changed the subject, and said, “We still have to pop by the supermarket, unless we want our kids to starve.”
You are right to think I do not agree with beating yourself up about things that happened in the past. I know how tempting that can be, but it will not change what happened and you can use that energy for something more useful. Not that emotions listen to that kind of reasoning, but it is always worth a try.
“Where are we sleeping then, Daddy?” Scorpius asked between two yawns. “Here, or in the other house?”
“I love you too.” Harry squeezed him one more time before pulling back with red rimmed eyes and a watery smile on his face. Then he walked him towards the only chair in the room next to the clean white bed and sat him down after transfiguring it into something more comfortable. “You’re going to be alright here?”
You have always been something of a challenge, and I am more than up for it. I’ll see you at Luna’s cafe on Wednesday. Is two pm okay? That’s what time I’ll be there.
He didn’t know how he felt about not coming back to his job, but he knew he didn’t want to think about it now. There were more pressing matters at hand, like getting Draco Malfoy up the stairs. It proved to be quite the challenge, as Draco was taller than him and completely uncooperative. Harry was half tempted to join the blond in bed by the time they actually reached it.
The stupid excuses of the school board, who oversaw his case ever since McGonagall had been called out by the Magical United Nations for something important, were driving him up the wall.
“Oh surely I can’t be the only one thinking Puddlemere will win this year.” Ginny Weasley had retired from quidditch a few years ago, but that didn’t stop her from loudly discussing it with her brother. Draco hadn’t paid much attention to them, until suddenly his name was used. “Anyone with half a brain can see that, right Malfoy? You’re about the only person at this table with more than two brain cells and a quidditch interest.”
little fighter, saying he wouldn’t be alone this time, it was too much. “I love you.” They didn’t really feel like the right words to say, but Draco didn’t know how to tell Harry about this all consuming feeling of safety he got in the man’s arms. How much he needed an anchor and how
Her son. The man fighting for his life who was still just a boy inside her head. A boy who had lived through way too much. The harsh upbringing of his father, which she should have stopped while she could. The war and the fear and trauma that came with it. Narcissa knew those things had hurt and broken him until there was barely any Draco left.
he had to do, yet he couldn’t remember what it was. It was like cupping water with his bare hands. Try all you like, but in the end, it’s still going down the drain.
“I would appreciate it if you kept me updated, Hermione,” Kingsley said after fighting an unexpected wave of emotions. Hermione looked surprised by the use of her given name. “As friends, I mean. Not as Minister or colleague. Without him we… Kevin and I would not be married. After everything Mr Malfoy has done for our world, he does not deserve this fate.”
“Doesn’t mean I’ll stop teasing you at every opportunity I get mind you,” Ginny added sharply, a joyful twinkle in her eyes. “And I don’t agree with everything you do. But for the big stuff, for being a parent, you’re doing alright.”
“Says the man who eats more than I do yet still doesn’t have an ounce of body fat.” Harry jokingly poked him in his side. It was true, Draco was and probably always would be skinny. It had its perks, but he would prefer to look a bit more like Harry, with his soft stomach and great,
“If you want me to apologise, I won’t,” Draco snapped, a bit more sharply than intended. People could make jokes about how he’d been a shit Death Eater who was all bark and no bite, but he
“Yes, please.” Draco was too eager getting up and nearly fell in Harry’s arms. Lucky for him, his years worth of etiquette classes and love for dance saved him now. Dancing was something he could do. Now he just had to learn how to do Harry. How to talk to him, kiss him, date him, make sweet, sweet love to him. But first, they would dance.
Just like talking to a pet seems silly. My rule over the years has become, if it doesn’t harm, but it does help, there is no reason not to do it. And if you still feel silly after that, just remember muggles talk to a rubber duck when they have issues.
“Until you got fed up with me and threw that curse at my head.” Draco chuckled even if Harry was horrified by the memory. “You got angry like my father, then cared for me like my mum. Something clicked. You started feeling like home.”
Seconds later the door opened again, and Harry came out. He looked broken. A blood vessel in his eye had burst, probably from crying. He held it together though as he nodded at Kinsley and greeted his godson and the other child. Then the Weasley matriarch materialised out of nowhere and ushered the three of them away, hopefully towards something resembling a bed.
“Draco?” A familiar voice called down the hallway, and Draco was sure he’d fallen asleep and was dreaming now, because Harry couldn’t be in his flat. That would be ridiculous. “Draco! There you are. You know you’re not supposed to fall asleep on the couch, you dumb bastard, it’ll totally fuck with your back.”
“I have to hold it back.” Harry said way too soon for Draco’s liking. He was clearly fighting his tears with all he had. “I can’t break down every time Lily asks me where her granddad is, or when James can’t find anyone to play that stupid hungry hungry hippo game with.”
I’m not afraid of anything you’ve said so far, and I don’t think I will be in the future. Your words, even though they’re just written on parchment, seem to calm me as much as a walk does - I
“You’re a blessing, son, and don’t you forget it.” Andromeda sighed as she went to sit in the living room. Draco left the mayhem of the kitchen and joined her as soon as the tea was done. “Speaking of sons, Draco, where is Scorpius?”
And suddenly there were tears running down her cheeks as she watched the babies behind the glass. Hugo would grow up without a godfather if Draco died. Hermione would have to go through life with inferior debate partners. Ron would have to start playing chess with his brothers again. And Harry…
“No.” Harry sat up and shook his head. He didn’t meet Draco’s eye anymore now, and his voice was suddenly quite a lot softer. “I know it’s still common practice in the magical community to cuff a kid’s ear and stuff like that, but I just won’t do that. It was hardly physical abuse, but my aunt and uncle weren’t exactly gentle with me as a kid and I never
“It was the start of things getting better.” A tear rolled down his cheeks and he caught it with a beer mat. He stared at the stain it left for a few minutes before breaking the silence. “This place gave me my hope back.”
A new update will take a while, both my old shitty and my new laptop have died beyond repair and I have no money to replace them
I decided to name the chapters after the POV I'm using, I hope that's handy? If not or if you have a better idea for chapter titles I'm open for suggestions!
There was a knock on Neville’s door, which was odd. But what was even stranger, was that Neville was out of bed and heard it. Standing sleep deprived in front of a class full of teenagers was the opposite of a good idea, so normally Neville would be asleep for hours by now. One of his succulents was struggling though, after a couple of students had sneaked into his personal greenhouse and had disturbed its growth. Sleeping was out of the question until he knew for sure that the little guy would pull through.
“Draco.” The floo had flared up. Judging by his surprised tone, Harry had only dropped by to dump his stuff, not because he knew about the scene Draco had caused in the stationery store. The man was quick to recover from his shock though, and soon kneeled down at his side. “Oh Draco, what happened to you?”
. I’m lonely, not barbaric,” Draco huffed, struggling to keep a straight face. Oh, if only eleven year old Draco could see him now. It might have saved him a world of hurt, although it would have ripped his family apart much sooner. “And before you ask, no, I do not want to build a snowman with you.”
“Being held down by a stranger reminded you of the hospital,” Draco filled in, and his heart hurt when his son nodded. Astoria had gone in and out of hospital the last year of her life as her blood curse began to manifest itself. Draco and Scorpius had followed her every step of the way. Draco hadn’t been sure about letting a child spend so much time in hospital, but Scorpius simply refused to be anywhere but with his mum. From birth, he’d always clung more to Astoria than him, as if sensing that they wouldn’t have long together. The first few nights after Astoria passed away Draco had been forced to medicate his son into sleep, because he wouldn’t stop crying or asking for his mum.
“Yes sir!” Harry saluted him and hopped off the bed. Then his kids spent the next ten minutes saying their faked teary goodbyes to their father, before Harry waved at him one last time and went out the door. Draco smiled. Despite everything, he was quite a happy man now.
But now that she was faced with Teddy, Hermione and Parkinson, looking at her like the sun would shine again and life would be full and good once more at the mere possibility of Draco waking up, she couldn’t help but regret never getting to know Luna’s best friend and Harry’s lover. And now she might never get the chance again.
“Yes!” he yelled, beaming at his grandmother before gesturing for Draco to pick him up. “We’re having pancakes!”
“Everyone says goodbye in their own way.” Draco gave Harry another warm smile along with a stack of books. When he explained each book his voice went slightly into professional mode to his own surprise. Though he had never really talked to Arthur Weasley much, he had seen what a caring, loving father he’d been. He didn’t doubt he would be greatly missed.
“What do you mean not a good sign?” Ginny frowned and finally tore her gaze away from Malfoy in favour of looking at Parkinson. “It’s a bad sign when someone is dying because the control over their body is slipping. It’s a bad sign when someone is epileptic because they might get an attack. But it’s not a bad sign in magical comas. It means nerve signals are travelling through the body again, that’s not bad at all. A teammate of mine once got a Bludger to the head, and she started twitching too a few hours before waking up. Though granted, she was only out for two days.”
Harry told himself no lies, Draco was amazing with kids, much more than he was. Especially when they were young. After just one night of babysitting, Ron and Hermione only flooed Harry to ask if he knew where Draco was.
“Mother! What are you doing here?” He was sure the last time his mother had visited him in bed when he wasn’t ill had been over two decades ago. It wasn’t done in pureblood circles. A single knock on the door, a request to be in a certain place at a certain time, and that was it. Gently waking someone up was for toddlers and lovers. Which reminded him, unexpected or not, he hadn’t exactly responded politely to his mother’s visit. “I mean, I appreciate it, and I hope you slept well, I just-”
So, I want you to examine your own behaviour a bit this week, only gently, one thing at a time, baby steps, not because I think you cannot handle more, but because doing more is incredibly dangerous and risky. Just take one thing at a time, think about what you do, why you do it, put it in the context of our current peace and see if it still makes sense there. If it does not, then maybe it is time to change them. Not radical changes, but gradual ones.
deserve him, and definitely didn’t deserve this breakfast. His voice was smaller when he spoke again. “I don’t understand why you care.”
“You think he’d get like that for me?” Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Ron’s cooking frenzies were famous. The youngest Weasley son was worse than his mother when it came to his work in the kitchen, making more extravagant meals each time Draco visited. Normally he only turned to stress baking when there was something amiss in his family or when his friends were sick though.
“Brussel sprouts? What a delicious treat,” Draco said just to tease James a bit. It worked, the kid pulled a face and made a vomiting noise. “Oh come come, James. I’m sure they weren’t that bad.”
“No, Pansy, don’t-” But it was already too late. She’s disappeared in the crowd, and soon after he saw her talk to Adonis.
I very much doubt I know more about you than you do yourself, though. We sometimes need the insight of an outsider to see certain things, the way we are talking with each other now, but in the end,
Harry laughed at that, and Draco sighed with relief. This bit of banter felt like the fresh breath of air he’d been craving for ever since his son had taken ill. It was one thing he had learned from all those weeks in the hospital; Being sick was a serious business, but if that meant being serious all the time you’d go insane. Relieving tension by laughing was always a nicer option than crying your eyes out.
“Of course. Thank you for the invitation, Harry. I might take you up on that.” He definitely would, he decided as he saw a spark of excitement in Harry’s eyes. Plus, Scorpius had always wanted to have a large family, but all Draco could ever him was a grandmother who lived in France and a family of his late mother who pretended he didn’t exist. Their terrible way of dealing with grief had been one of his inspirations to start writing. “And Happy New Year.”
Draco nodded ever so slightly and reached into his pyjama pocket to retrieve something that looked like it was muggle. Neville figured out it was a recording device when Draco pushed a button and the sound began to play.
“Does this have to do with this place? Did something happen here?” Harry was a lot more perceptive than people gave him credit for sometimes. And he clearly had a lot of self restraint, given that he looked like his only desire in life was hugging Draco, yet he still stayed where he was. “We can leave if that’s the case, or if it isn’t. Whatever you want. I can call someone if you like? I promise I won’t be mad. And you don’t have to tell me what’s going on, but if you do I promise I won’t judge. Please, just say something.”
“It’s Narcissa, Harry.” Draco’s mother replied sternly, even though everyone knew it was of no use. Draco suspected Harry refused to call his mum by her first name because it was something reserved for official family-in-law. He knew from Hermione that Harry had only started calling Mrs Weasley Molly after his marriage to Ginny, and that he’d stopped calling her that for a little while after the divorce until Mrs Weasley had gotten mad at him for it. Maybe one day Harry would address her as his mother wished, but they both knew their relationship was too young for that.
Harry threw his head back and laughed. “Oh Merlin, don’t remind me. Or don’t remind Ron and Hermione, actually.
“It doesn’t feel like that sometimes.” Now it was Draco who refused to meet Harry’s eye. His voice was so much more vulnerable than he wanted it to be. “It’s like I’m holding my breath, pretending to be okay, pretending to be a better person until Scorpius can stand on his own and I can fall apart again.”
“Draco it’s alright, I’m here, it’s okay. There’s no need to apologise, the kids are safe. Scorpius is going to be fine, I promise.”
“Because I love you.” Harry replied, as if it were the most simple, natural thing in the world. “Definitely as one of my best friends, maybe at some point as a lover. But whatever happens, Draco, I’ll always care, okay?”
But even with the Spark gone, he felt less Heavy. The fight in him that had almost died out was back again, not really full force but definitely more present.
She watched carefully as Harry and Draco greeted each other somewhat awkwardly, though they were soon smiling fondly at Aurora.
“I’m so sorry for not keeping him safe.” He muttered into the dark, his thoughts somehow coming out as words. His cheeks were wet again. He hadn’t even noticed he’d been crying. “If-, no,
“I simply came to collect my grandchild,” his mother replied as she reached out to brush a lock of hair from Scorpius’ face. She then smiled, a light blush appearing on her cheeks. “I presumed you and Harry might want some alone time in bed.”
Draco groaned, squeezing his eyes shut before opening them. “Wha-, what? Harry? What are you-, am I-, where am I?”
“I had a quite a good chat with your mother just now.” Mrs Weasley started after she’d sat down and they’d shared a few minutes of awkward silence. “It seems I owe you an apology. Your parenting methods might not be the same as mine, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t respect them.”
“I know, Malfoy. Merlin, relax.” Ginny let go of his arm and rolled her eyes. “You seem to forget I was raised by her. The little girl she’d always wanted after six sons. She loved us all to bits, I won’t deny it, but all my clothing was pink until I started putting up daily fights about it. She wouldn’t let me fly with my brothers because Quidditch wasn’t meant for women. I love my mother, but that doesn’t mean I deny her having any flaws. I just wanted to let you know I’m on your side.”
hard not to melt. His son was already thinking more about his actions at the age of five than Draco had done at the age of fifteen. He could not be more proud. “Can I give you a hug?”
I haven’t had anybody to share a bed with in a long time. I know what you mean about having someone there when you wake up. It’s one of the things I miss about school - not that I was sharing beds with anyone there, but being in a dormitory meant there was always someone there the next morning. Are you still not allowed to sleep alone? (sorry, that might have been too personal a question - feel free to ignore it!)
“Yeah, exactly that.” Ginny nodded when she saw his response. “I didn’t tell him because my mother wouldn’t even dare to think of doing that again after the argument we had about it. I didn’t speak with her for three whole weeks but she calmed down eventually and admitted she’d been in the wrong. Or rather, that she should have respected our wishes, but I don’t think she understands what’s wrong with punishing a child like that. I don’t think she wants to understand, because it would mean she has to admit to having made mistakes while raising us. My mum is too proud for that. Your son doesn’t deserve to fall victim of that pride.”
He hopped off the bed and went downstairs to make some soup. He wouldn’t bother Mrs Weasley on Christmas Eve and soup always helped, he thought. Taking care of sick people wasn’t his forte, but he could hardly do worse than Draco himself. He had no idea if the man was allergic to anything, so he tried to make a basic broth with toast. That’s what sick people ate, right?
I'm so sorry that this is so short! But I will try my best to make the next chapter extra long as compensation. It's already written for the most part, so hopefully the wait won't be too long. Anyhow, thank you so much for supporting this fic so far! I love you guys
“Don’t you think that these aren’t sad tears then?” Draco was pulled out of his thoughts when Ellis spoke again. “Maybe you’re relieved, because remembering your past life reminds you that you don’t live like that anymore. You moved on to better things.”
Draco knew why Potter was reassuring him already. Indeed, his first instinct was to say no. He didn’t want his pity invitation. Plus, he only occasionally saw Luna, and the rest had no reason to like him. Well, they might have one annoying, green-eyed, messy haired reason, but Draco didn’t even know why Potter was being nice to him. It felt odd given that Draco struggled to even be nice to himself sometimes.
“Did your mother just tell us to have kinky sex?” Harry, the traitor, sounded far too awake and amused for someone who’d only just woken up. The fucker had probably listened in on everything, and spent a great deal of time before that looking through his eyelashes at Draco’s content expression.
And with that, she hopped off the counter and found herself a place to sit. Ginny came in soon after, and in fear of her legendary teasing Harry didn’t bring Malfoy up again. But the note burned in his pocket all day, sometimes feeling like a promise, sometimes like a curse. But there was only one way to find out which one it would be.
“Oh, please don’t tell me I look skinny.” Draco rolled his eyes as he and his mother began to exit the bathroom. “It’s all people say about me these days.”
“Draco, I know what you’re doing, and you need to stop. You always feel so guilty about everything. Yes, you made mistakes as a kid, but not that many and mostly under great pressure. That’s behind you now. It’s in the past. You changed and you’re doing things
For a moment, Draco hugged him close. “It’s already a million times better than it’s ever been before.”
“I’m hardly perfect, Harry.” Draco forced out a chuckle that sounded fake even to his own ears. “But saying the words is a good first step, I hope.”
Or at least she thought she wouldn’t, until that horrifying moment when Narcissa’s swan Patronus had flown into her office. Apparently, Potter had let her down. Though that wasn’t actually fair of her. Pansy was the one who knew Draco better than anyone. If she hadn’t left him with Potter, she could have stopped him from going in, maybe. Could have stopped this stupid, reckless action.
. Maybe that was true. But at the very least he now knew this was a proper apology, which meant he could forgive Mrs Weasley.
His face hit the hardwood surface with a dull thud, his eyes closing soon after. Somewhere far away he heard an agitated discussion, but his mind was too slugging to process that information. Merlin, but he hated Christmas.
Added to that, I suppose it brought back memories of innocent people being targeted during the war just because of their blood status. I’m not pureblood, but I’m not Muggleborn either, so I was never a target in that sense. But seeing others who I considered friends persecuted was hard. Not being able to speak up for them without being afraid of retribution was harder. Not that I was really afraid, but I had to be careful. My head of house warned me multiple times. I sometimes had trouble listening.
“Yeah, well, it was just, I was a bit worried, you see, because Draco didn’t really seem alright today, and then I was awake anyway, so I thought I’d stop by his quarters, just to check, but then he wasn’t there, and then I got more worried because I didn’t know where he was and then I dug up my map and it showed you two were here and I just didn’t know why and I don’t have to know why! You don’t have to tell me, and I can leave right now, I just wanted to know how Draco was doing?” Harry was slightly out of breath after his ramblings, and Neville couldn’t help but smile at that. The man would never judge Draco for being a mess, being a mess himself.
Percy’s voice became white noise somewhere in the back of his mind as his words began to sink in. Scorpius would never wish for Mrs Weasley to be his mother. He would wish for Astoria, for his actual mother. Draco did the same. Not a day went by when he didn’t wish that blood curse had never been cast. But wishes didn’t come true. Draco had seen enough shit in life to know that.
i hope you guys liked that! also yes i named kingsley's husband after Kevin, the husband of Captain Holt from brooklyn 99. i hope some of you could appreciate that lol. Thank you for reading so far<3
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, I would love to.” Harry planted his knees on either side of Draco’s hips and gently cupped his face, angling his head just right before planting one of the softest, nicest kisses on Draco’s lips that he’d ever had. “I love you.”
He half expected Mrs Weasley to get mad at him again, but instead she just smiled. “Your mother said exactly the same thing to me moments ago. She said a great deal of other things too. Things I’ve been too proud to admit for a while.” Her smile got a sad touch to it, before it melted away entirely. Her gaze was fixed on a piece of bedframe when she spoke next, her eyes somewhat watery. “It’s not easy, growing old, you know? You feel so proud every time your kids learn something new at first, but later on each new thing just makes you feel a little bit more redundant. Getting parenting advice from your own children is the last stage of that process, because then you truly have nothing left to teach them. People don’t need you anymore.”
I know it’s a bad idea to use uncontrolled magic. I found myself using accidental magic as a child - though I didn’t know it seeing as I didn’t know I was a wizard - and it wasn’t received well. My aunt and uncle… well, they used to hide me away because they were terrified that people would think I wasn’t “normal”. They used to tell people I attended St Brutus’ school for the criminally insane. To be honest, I’m surprised I never developed some kind of complex.
“Will do, Minis-, eh, Kingsley.” She smiled at him, looking somewhat too tired to be embarrassed about her jumbled words. “Make sure you do the same, sir. You look like you could use a good night’s sleep.”
“Oh, you mean, after she invited me over twice and gifted me with a cup of tea? You think that’s reason enough to just let her walk all over my son’s personal boundaries without any repercussions?” He was quite shocked by the cold edge in his voice. Usually he left the old pureblood Malfoy far away in the past were it belonged, but something about the demanding tone of Percy’s voice brought it back. “My son was uncomfortable, she didn’t listen, and then when he got upset she got angry at him, as if being a child means you have no say in how you are treated. I very much disagree with that rhetoric and I will not compromise my views on that, so no, I will not apologise, and if she doesn’t want to either then that’s her fault for causing a rift in the family and not mine.”
Draco let out a low groan as response. It was probably too much to ask for a coherent reply, with the nightmare and the crying and Harry not being able to keep his trap shut and all. So he let Draco rest on him, bribed him with soft words and back rubs to take his potions and soup and lay him down again when he refused to eat any more.
“And I love that about you.” Now it was Draco pulling Harry close, impossibly close as if Draco was trying to merge them together. However stupid it sounded he wanted to squeeze all of Harry’s insecurity out of him. He knew it was hard on the ex-auror that he’d gained a stone or two, especially because of the horrible media coverage. Draco sighed deeply and inhaled Harry’s scent like a drug addict in need of a fix. “Perfect teddy bear.”
!” Draco bellowed with more force than intended, though he paid no heed to that. He was next to Scorpius in an instant, helping him stand up and lifting him off the floor when his son indicated that’s what he wanted. Draco put him on his hip and stepped away from Molly. “You stay away from my son if you’re too dumb to listen to him. No means no.”
. Somehow he managed to work the job unnoticed by his landlord slash boss. After that, things began to look up. He found cheaper lodgings, more pubs who needed staff, and this time when he quit, he didn’t have to look back ever again.
The first night he met Harry after many years, the week after Scorpius had finally been let out of the hospital, they’d just talked. Laughed and cried and drank and talked until the landlord came to kick them out. During the many playdates with their kids, they’d drifted closer together until they couldn’t possibly call each other
Harry, more so now that he heard his voice. He was pretty sure more tears wrestled their way out of his eyes as he curled in on himself.
Parents, or guardians, ought to love their children unconditionally. There is nothing that a child has to do to earn the love from their parents because
“I’m sorry about going all therapist mode on you. I have a lot of feelings on the subject, apparently.” Potter joined him in blushing and stared at the table between them, biting his bottom lip. “If it’s any consolation, I surprised myself too with that tirade. I don’t usually…
I also promise to stop suppressing memories. Well, I’ll try to stop. I’ll try to write things down. Maybe I’ll scream into a pillow… that used to help me during school holidays. Anyway.
“That’s odd.” She muttered as she continued to watch her best friend. His right hand, to be precise. “It almost looks like Draco is hugging Harry back.”
George snorted despite his tears. That would have been such a Draco thing to say. He respected and loved Hufflepuff as a House, but saying that out loud wasn’t usually how Draco worked. His affection would always be expressed through insults. He wouldn’t be Draco Malfoy otherwise.
“Dad, can you put me down?” She asked as she eyed her crying godfather. Ron obliged. Rose didn’t want him or her mom or Uncle Harry to be sad, but as Uncle Harry was the most sad Uncle Harry needed the most help.
“You could celebrate Christmas with us? I mean, if you’re not too busy with your exams. Because if you’re swamped with work then it must be harder to find someone to spend the holidays with. That’s the sad part, how can anyone invite you over if you’re busy all the time?”
Rose beamed and turned around to share the moment with her dad, but the rest of the room was empty. It was just her, Uncle Harry and the Princess. So, she fiddled with her sleeve as she waited for her godfather to make a move. Harry gently brushed the hair out of the Princess’ face, just like a fairytale prince would do.
“You have?” Harry sounded even more surprised than Draco felt, and before Draco could think too much about it he pulled Harry into a hug. And then Harry whispered into his neck, “I can’t believe I have you in my life.”
“What do you mean?” An icy hand gripped Neville’s heart. The words made it sound like Draco wouldn’t be hearing
Luna looked up as the bell over the door chimed. Her eyes lit up when she spotted who had just entered.
“But you said it’s important to ask before you do something with other people.” Scorpius frowned. “What if I don’t ask, and you don’t feel like it? Then you can’t say no.”
But in between those peaks, going outside is a great way to relax. Feeling bad about yourself and the world is a lot harder when you are enjoying a cup of tea in the sun. My father became a recluse in the last years of his life, and making someone see the light in their life is a lot harder when they never see the sun. But I will not bother you with those details, as his case is not even remotely close to yours.
I know that my friends will be upset that I don’t think I can talk to them, but the truth is, I’ve not felt able to talk to them for a long time. They’re happy. Starting a family. I can’t be the one to drag all the bad memories up again, they’d never forgive me.
Draco did not like the way she phrased that. As if a parenting method decided whether or not it was okay to disrespect the boundaries of a child. “My parenting methods are based on principles I believe everyone should adhere to. And my boyfriend and your daughter agree with me on that, as do many others,” he said a tad coldly. “It’s the boundaries of children that you should respect.”
“No, having to question every day if you’re good enough yet. If you’ve atoned enough, if you’re a bad person, if you work hard enough. The stress, it
“I’m sure it is, Draco.” Neville pushed his insecurities aside and focussed fully on his friend again. More specifically, on making him some tea. “Earl Grey or Darjeeling?”
. Because what my father did, the scar, it will always hurt as long as I’m not sure I’m welcome. Demons aren’t welcome you see? The pain is supposed to keep them away.”
Neville shook his head and got up from the couch. Again, he wasn’t really sure what to do with himself, but he knew what to do with Harry and Draco. “If you guys feel up to it, I’ll dig up some pyjamas and ready my bed. Seems best not to go back all the way to your own quarters now, right?”
Draco shuddered alongside Harry at that idea. Though Draco couldn’t help but note that he’d much rather have Hermione living in his house compared to Lord Voldemort. He didn’t say that though. There were quite a lot of details about his sixth and seventh year which Harry didn’t know about, and he would like to keep it that way.
He’d brought this fate onto himself, and he’d made peace with it. And now Potter had to show up in his life and muck it all up.
As for the attack you described, I had to take a step back when I read that. I am myself a gay man, and I have been attacked like that, albeit sans partner. I have some very specific and personal tips because of that, namely, if you ever find yourself as a witness again, call the police, stay close to the attack without putting yourself in danger, do not try to stop the attack if you know you will never win that fight, and (especially if things get really out of hand and police are far away) try to persuade the people around you to step in together. More often than not, people want to do something, they just do not want to take that first step.
“She was in the room when Albus floo’ed Ron.” Harry explained. “There was no stopping her when she heard what had happened.”
Harry threw his head back and laughed. Draco soon joined him. Scorpius had been quite the sight when he’d come back from the Granger-Weasleys. According to Hermione, Ron was still removing glitter from behind his ears two weeks later.
I feel like I’m taking up a lot of your time (I know you told me not to feel that but I can’t help it). I’ll end my letter here for now and go and write myself a list of things I enjoy doing, as you’ve asked. I may even write some angry letters, though it’ll be hard to pick a recipient at the minute - not because I’m angry at a lot of people, but because I’m
Draco was right, it didn’t have an easy fix. He wished it had. That there was some magical potion or pill or plant out there that could cure depression in an instant, but there wasn’t. Neville tried to think of what he would do if one of his students came to him with a problem like this.
I’ve had… trouble reaching out for help in the past and I don’t want to go there again. I know my friends are there for me but… they’ve also moved on and are… in a much better place than me.
“Do you know that you’re an amazing friend, Nev?” Neville blushed at the question. He’d never really gotten used to the idea that people both noticed and
“I know.” Draco nestled himself besides Harry and pulled him into a hug. The man was clearly upset, as he always was when talking about his childhood, and Draco wanted nothing more than to comfort him. It had been a strange feeling at first, because Astoria had rarely needed comfort and when she did it had been for entirely different reasons. But it wasn’t a bad feeling. He quite liked making Harry feel safe and loved when life got him down. “Hey, you don’t have to explain or defend yourself to me. I’m the one who asks before even holding Scorp’s hand, I would
“Aurora, I have a job for you,” she said softly, nuzzling her nose into the cat’s soft fur. “My friend Harry is nervous. I think that he’s worried about the Wrackspurts keeping his friend away, but if it’s who I think it is, I am positive he will find a way to get past them. You need to keep Harry company for a while to keep the Wrackspurts away, ok?”
That experience made it clear to me that however much the tradition and history of a house is important, its occupant always comes first. You live in that house, you have to be there nearly every day and you deserve to come home to a place that actually feels like that, like
In case you are worried about my cat, she’s been rolling around on my best coat ever since I started writing this letter. I think she is offended that I think writing you is more important than petting her. Judging by the amount of hairs she has left on my coat you would say she will go bald very soon, but so far no luck. Maybe I should have gotten a sphynx instead of a ragdoll, but I would rather die than get rid of her now, even if she ruins all my clothes.
“You’re a bastard, that’s what you are,” Harry mumbled even as he rolled over again and put his head on Draco’s bare chest. “But I love you anyway.”
Draco felt his face turn a deep red. He preferred not to think about his little tantrum. In his  head he was all grown up, aged by war, society, trauma, the death of his father. The entitled tantrum-throwing child he had once been was long dead and buried.
“Oh, come here.” Draco wasn’t usually one to initiate hugs, but then again, his sort of romantic best friend didn’t come barging in with breakfast and a day off either. So, as soon as the tray was savely on his nightstand, Draco pulled Harry on the bed and rolled them over, trapping the specky git beneath him before burying his face in the crook of his neck. “I love you too, you stupid baffoon.”
me into a vampire, so your son still has no excuse for biting me. And no one ever asks for anything by looking a certain way, that’s not consensual.”
What I am trying to say with all this, is that while growing up, help has not been offered to you, but that was not because you did not need it, or because you did not deserve it. Quite the opposite, in fact.
“But what if I keep growing away from people?” Harry lifted his head and looked Draco straight in the eye. The insecurity behind those green eyes was painful to watch, but Draco refused to look away. He didn’t want to send the wrong message. “What if I grow away from you?”
dramatic, he didn’t play pretend. But she was trying to calm him, and that alone was help enough. Plus, he shouldn’t be thinking about himself at all now. He had a son to worry about. “Thank you, Mother.”
As for talking to your owl, I wish I had been that wise in my early years, I think my friends would have appreciated that over me always complaining about everything to them. Now that I think about it, maybe that was why I got a rubber duck in my second year as a Christmas present. That always puzzled me until now.
“You are?” Draco’s eyes grew wide and when he turned his head to properly look at his man, it was all he could do not to melt. It wasn’t fair how Harry could turn him into a puddle with one single bloody glance, it just wasn’t. Though he wasn’t really glancing, he was looking with glee as he watched Draco realise what his words meant.
“No Potter, I read those just for fun.” That sarcastic reply earned him a confused look, which in turn made him roll his eyes. “Yes Potter, that’s why I was reading a neurology book. I have exams just after Christmas.”
knock on his door. The two men looked at each other in surprise, or in Draco’s case, mild horror. It wasn’t exactly the kind of position he’d want a student to find him in. But a voice from behind the door spoke before Draco could get to his feet and hide somewhere.
“A million blankets doesn’t really sound like a fix.” Draco let out a stray sob before reaching out and putting a trembling hand around his cup of tea. “Thanks for the tea, Nev.”
The focus is, or at least should be, on the part of your tapestry where threads are getting added, where your present lies. And the way you see your tapestry, see your history, your present, the lines of future promise, is coloured by the lens of your current emotional state.
That seemed to comfort Scorpius because he finally looked away from his knees. There was a bit of cake stuck to the corner of his mouth, and Draco almost reached out to brush it off until thinking the better of it. “There’s some cake stuck there,” he said instead, indicating the spot on his own face.
He thought that if he tried, he could get over Draco. He’d gotten over Sirius, even though that still hurt every time he thought about it. But he didn’t want to get over Draco. He didn’t want to put on a brave face for Ron and Hermione, for their kids, for Teddy. Poor Teddy, who might lose his favourite fake uncle now.
I regret so many of my decisions in the past, but saving you is not one of them and neither is testifying for you. I would really, really like to at least try to be friends with you. You have helped me more than you know during the exchanging of our letters and I will forever be grateful for them, even if you decide you don’t want anything more to do with me (I really hope you don’t decide that).
If my mother had not taught me that I deserve help for my illness, I would be dead. I do not want that to happen to you, just because no one has told you the way my mother has for me, that you deserve that help. That you should not wait for a breakdown and a mandatory ministry letter exchange. That you should not, when you feel uncomfortable saying certain things to your friends, bottle everything up.
“No, Scorpius. I am never mad at you.” Draco actively had to stop himself from pulling his son close and kissing his forehead, because he knew that especially in situations like this, he should let Scorpius come to him or just leave him alone. The little guy felt shit enough already, he shouldn’t add to that. “I just hope you’ll get better soon because I want you to feel healthy and happy, okay? But I’m never mad.”
Draco had been the one to organise his best birthday parties and take him on the most absurd holidays. Getting spoiled and manicured in Paris, climbing in the Andes mountains, visiting the north pole to see the northern light, or
“No. I think they are sad. I think they clean so much here because they’re trying to wash the sadness away, but it never really works.” She sighed at the weird habits of adults. “Maybe they could hang up some pictures, see if that helps. Or they could buy a puppy, that would cheer people up.”
!” All background noise washed away when the distressed call of his son reached Draco’s ears. Without uttering a single word to Harry, Draco turned around and made his way to the Burrow’s kitchen as fast as he could. There was crying coming from it too when he finally reached it.
Scorpius gave one more small nod before he fell back asleep. It took a while before Draco could tear his eyes away from his sleeping son, but once he did he reached out to Harry and briefly squeezed his hands. “Tell your kids I’m sorry I let myself panic like that when we got here. And that I’m proud of them for behaving the way they did, especially James.”
Harry chuckled at the mention of his youngest daughter. If Lily wasn’t following James around, she was sleeping someplace that wasn’t her own bed. Any place that was warm really, like Harry’s bed just after he left it, the door mat next to the Muggle radiator, that one spot behind the couch with a warm water pipe running under it, or of course the cabinet under the kitchen sink where they’d put the boiler. She was so often referred to as a cat that they sometimes called her kitty instead of Lily.
“I’m sorry.” The words were spoken in such a soft whisper Draco almost didn’t catch them. Scorpius was looking at his knees again. “I shouldn’t have yelled at her. I know I should act normal, but sometimes I can’t help it.”
Test results and a detailed analysis from the operation came in the next day, just after Harry was done massaging the knots out of Draco’s back. Scorpius had looked a bit better in the morning, but Draco didn’t dare get his hopes up. He knew the horrible relapses from the blood curse like no other.
“Oh.” Draco had never really consciously thought about that. He and his mother had both worked very hard after the war to erase the blood purism from their thoughts, but normal, private etiquette had always stayed the same for them. “I suppose we can.”
For once this time though, the difficult words weren’t just a shield to hide behind while presenting bad results. Scorpius had a long road to recovery to go because his natural magic had basically been knocked over the head with a hammer, but only because that cut off the magic supply to the curse, meaning that it would be weak enough to remove fully in a few weeks. Scorpius would have to stay in hospital for that time, getting thrice weekly check ups to ensure the curse wasn’t up to any funny business. If all went according to plan, Scorpius would be fully healthy again in just two months.
get any help, Draco, and yet you’re still here. I’ve been lonely for a very long time in my life, but at least I knew that what I was doing was right. At least I began to gain friends when things went to shit. You didn’t. You were on your own and you still got through it and not a day goes by that I’m not stunned by that. And after all that fighting you’ve done on your own, it’s no shame to ask for help now. You’ve already done more than anyone should have ever asked of you, alright?”
things, and Draco just couldn’t. So he declined all invitations and spend all his nights, mornings or evenings, depending on his hours, on his own in front of some mindless television. The muggle contraption was good to relax his mind after a hard day’s work, though he wouldn’t deny the lack of company made him a bit sad.
“Oh shit, what if I’m making you pee your pants! Or put rain in your nightmare! It can’t rain in your nightmare, that would just make it worse.” Draco began to stir, cutting off any more insane ramblings Harry might utter, which was probably for the best. “Draco? Draco can you hear me?”
Malfoy looked Muggle, unsurprising since Harry’s shop was in a muggle area, but baffling because it was
“Neville, I’m sorry, I-,” Draco’s breath hitched, cutting off his words. Neville knew right away something was terribly wrong. First of all, Draco
“Oh Draco.” Suddenly warm, strong arms were around him, hugging him close, fingers massaging his back while their owner whispered sweet nothings in his ear. “I knew from your colleagues you were bad but I didn’t know it had gotten this far. I would have come so much sooner if I had.”
damage from the war meant Draco was often cold, but that was never an issue when Harry was there. “But you're doing a brilliant job, love. And I know for sure Scorpius couldn't wish for a better dad. He wouldn't want to. He adores you.”
Draco’s head was too heavy for his neck. He tried leaning back but the backrest of Potter’s chair wasn’t high enough, so his only option was laying his head down on the desk. He didn’t want to, it was undignified, but now that his body knew it would be shoved back into bed by Potter soon, it no longer listened to him.
He didn’t trust himself to talk, so Draco just pulled Harry closer for a second before letting go. Harry placed a chaste kiss on his cheeks before Draco left. Once back in bed, blessedly without his healer robes on, he cried some more because not only did
My boggart in fourth year was my bed. My own bed, where behind closed curtains, my mind was doing a damned good job at preparing me for the fear of war we were about to experience. It was not triggered by trauma, but by my bloodline. The Black family has always had a history of mental illness. I still take medication now, because even though my PTSD is as well managed as it can be, a lack of what the muggles call ‘your happy hormone’ will never get fixed with therapy. I will have to take medication for the rest of my life in order to stay alive. It is a chronic illness, and one that I cannot possibly deal with on my own.
“Molly did no such thing.” Draco huffed, offended by the notion even though it was a tiny bit true. “She’s just getting Scorpius some tea.”
, not just a magazine but also the headquarters where all the other national magazines reported back to, meant a busy career, but that didn’t make it any less unacceptable that it had taken her nearly two weeks to get to her best friend who might just be dying.
Draco wasn’t awake enough to really register what Harry was saying, just awake enough to hug back, latch on to the kindness in the words, try to bury himself in the warmth and comfort that was Harry.
But now he had, and it was with great difficulty that he tore himself away from the hospital ward and found his way to bed. He’d much rather stick around and
had never been useful advice in the entire history of planet Earth. “I promise you they won’t bite.”
He hadn’t even made it to the sofa when he began to cry, so he just sat down on the floor and let it all wash over him. People talking about Astoria without respect, or as if she didn’t matter or had never even existed, always set him off. It was such a painful reminder of the gaping black hole inside of him, the void left in his life and the life of his son that could never be filled no matter how much everyone else loved them. There would just always be something missing inside of him, and he and Scorpius would just have to learn how to live with that but
“Doesn’t mean you weren’t a class A prick though, or that you’re completely blameless.” Potter chuckled at the thought. “It just means that you deserve a fair second chance. But you never got one, and now you’re alone during Christmas, coming into my coffee shop looking like absolute death and that’s not your fault. That’s all I’m saying. I wouldn’t want you to think that you’re alone because of
“It’s going to be alright, Draco,” she said in that soft, calming voice only mothers seemed to have. Astoria’d had it too for the few short years she got to enjoy Scorpius before she passed away. “It’s not as bad as you think it is. The war is over. We still have problems, but we won’t get hurt like that again. We won’t die.”
It was such a fucking treacherous curse, but the Healers had told him it was so weak now it couldn’t do any damage anymore. He wondered if they’d lied to him just because of his name. If they wanted to see him squirm and hope and break just like the many grieving families of war victims had done. He should have made sure Scorpius had more check ups, should have given custody to Astoria’s parents. He clearly wasn’t fit to raise a child, let alone a child that needed special care.
“May I have some tea, Dad?” Scorpius asked, pulling on the leg of his trousers. Draco smiled and knelt down. His young son was doing his best to be as articulate as possible.
“Because you got today off!” Harry replied. “Your colleagues aren’t blind, or arseholes, they see how you’re running yourself into the ground, never missing a shift, always staying late, never saying no when someone asks you to cover for them. You
I can’t explain it, but… your letter does make me feel that I can trust you. You have a way with words, and I believe you could be the right person. It’s comforting to know that you’re an expert in this kind of stuff, because like I said in my last letter, I’ve never done this before.
“Ha bloody ha, Malfoy,” Harry replied. He still hadn’t mastered the craft of creative non-swear word use. “Just because you-”
I do look forward to your letters, as odd as it may sound since we have only exchanged a few but I enjoy your words… that may sound even more odd. But it’s true. I’ve always looked forward to simple things - as a child, I looked forward to being alone in my cupboard because it meant I wasn’t getting beaten up by my cousin or shouted at by my aunt and uncle. After I started at Hogwarts, I looked forward to going back to school at the end of the holidays. Some people would think that’s pathetic, I suppose, but my school days at Hogwarts are definitely some of the brightest threads in my tapestry. Even the fights and arguments I had with my rival are bright threads because they weren’t the same as being beaten up by my cousin. We were more equal than that.
“Fuck school,” Victoire muttered, sounding both fierce and tired. She was holding Teddy’s hand, Ginny noticed when she looked down. And when Teddy let out another sob, she patiently pulled him into her arms. “Family is more important.”
Once he landed in Harry’s house, the only place he knew no one would bother him, he immediately had to redirect his energy to not breaking down. Sadly, there was not enough energy in the whole world to hold him together.
“Malfoy isn’t sick, Potter.” Harry’s boss replied, the words almost sounding like an order. As if that was how being sick worked. “It’s Christmas Eve, he must have been telling porkies. I’m not tearing another Auror away from their family during the holiday for that.”
Just after the war ended, that house was a safe haven for me, a good, quiet place to go to. Somewhere to be alone with my thoughts, where I could fight the demons inside my head without having to fight the demons of the house as well.
But Draco was wrong to think that he had melted just from that, because then cute buzzcut guy turned his head towards him, looked him straight in the eye and
“Bullshit, you wouldn’t survive two days without a hug whether it’s mine or not. And have you seen the last time I tried to teach James how to cook pancakes? I’m sorry Draco but that disaster father title is mine and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
“I miss you too.” And damn it all to hell if Draco wasn’t tearing up again. “And I’d like that. Sharing a bed again.”
Well… after reading that I’d rendered you speechless, I read ahead to see your name. And now, well, I’m crying again. Everything in my head is screaming at me not to tell you that, but I don’t want to hide anything from you. I had an inkling that I knew you when you mentioned Pansy earlier. I didn’t imagine it would be you that I’ve been talking to. But… I’m actually quite glad it is.
, a something which occasionally had thoughts in the shape of single words, and emotions in the shape of panic and exhaustion. But there was something more there. Something bigger that kept escaping him each time he tried to reach for it. The something was the reason why he feared the Heaviness. Feared Death.
Neville couldn’t imagine how this must feel like to Draco. Sure, Neville felt sad and overwhelmed sometimes, but he had his coping mechanism. He had his plants, his friends, his students. It never really lasted long and a bad mood almost never came out of the blue. But to have your own mind put you through so much hurt, without any rhyme or reason, it had to be terrifying. Especially for someone like Draco, who always had to be in control.
“I can’t do this, George,” Harry gripped the back of his shirt so hard it almost ripped. “I can’t keep watching him, hoping in vain that he’ll open his eyes, praying to all the gods I don’t believe in anymore. I can’t, I can’t, I
You certainly will not be the last person to cry after the tapestry story. I certainly did, and for me it were more than just a few tears. Crying is never a bad thing, and I have learned to stop fighting those emotions over the years. It is just a detail, but I feel like it has to be said that there is no shame in crying whatsoever.
The look he got in reply to his question was so exhausted, Harry was almost tempted to yawn himself. Malfoy could barely keep his eyes open, and didn’t seem surprised at all to see Harry there. He made no move to say anything though, which gave Harry some time for a quick once over.
As soon as he found out, he knew he had to visit the place on his own before he could face it with his friends. His boyfriend. Their relationship was new, but he wouldn’t call it fragile. Harry had been back in his life for years, flirting with Draco for the most of it, though he hadn’t caught on to that fact until very recently.
“He would probably like it even more if you came to him on a giant pink elephant or a candy cotton dragon, but that’s not realistic now, is it?” Victoire rolled her eyes and held out a hand. The sarcasm dripped from her words. It reminded Teddy of the fact that though she had only just turned twelve, she was nothing short of terrified of Draco dying, just like him. She was just better at hiding it. “Come on, Teddy, we haven’t got all day.”
“Potter!” Robart’s fury looked like it could match Harry’s. “You better come back with a better attitude tomorrow or don’t come back at all!”
But Harry just kept on sobbing into his shoulder, so George kept holding him. He looked at Draco’s still form as he rubbed Harry’s back. Wished the man would wake up and smirk at him, or wake up and go off in a jealous rage. Wake up and cry because he thought he’d lost Harry. If only he would wake up. Just wake up. Simply
“Fine.” Teddy sighed. Victoire was right. “I just… Draco loves flying. I thought he would like it if I flew to him.”
“I wouldn’t put it past her to weave some sort of evil curse into that bitch slap so you’re not actually imagining things.” Harry snorted. “I’m glad I had to fight Voldemort, if I’d had to fight Hermione we wouldn’t stand a chance.”
you!” Percy spat. Draco was strangely reminded of his late father when he got offended as he watched Percy’s expression grow harsh. “Your child was misbehaving and instead of apologising, you say it was my mother’s fault? And you’re insulting her hospitality by saying she just offered a cup of tea? I can list hundreds of people who would never let the likes of you into their house but she
“I got you a beer.” Pansy’s tone was completely neutral when she finally got back to him. His stomach sank. Of course he hadn’t been interested. He didn’t know why he’d gotten his hopes up, life didn’t treat him that way. “And a phone number.”
“Ma’am? We’re about to-, oh.” It wasn’t a ma’am. It wasn’t even a stranger. “Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
“I am not!” Harry countered even as he moved aside. “And besides, why does it matter? You always pull me over to your side anyway,
“That’s your battle to fight, love.” Draco smiled when Harry pulled a face to match his son’s. He hated playing bad cop, but as a single parent he still had to. It wouldn’t surprise Draco if they ended up eating pancakes that night though. “Andy! I’ll fetch you a cup of tea.” He greeted his aunt with a jovial smile and added in a low whisper as he walked past her, “And I’ll add something stronger to it.”
She thought inside her head, because she didn’t want to disturb them now. And then Uncle Harry leaned down, and kissed his Princess just like her mum kissed her dad only better. More magical. She almost squealed, it was so much like a fairy tale.
Draco wanted to freeze this moment in time and never stop sleeping. The bed was warm and soft and he had a Harry on one side and a Scorpius on the other. There wasn’t a single thing he could change to make his morning more perfect. Well, except for taking away the horrible prospect of needing to get out of bed and face the world later. He could do without that.
“Of course.” Kingsley nodded at her, still a bit shaken. “Make sure you look after yourself too, Hermione.”
Draco just nodded, and let himself be guided to the hospital cafeteria for a cup of tea. As always it tasted like absolute crap, but at least it was warm. He felt just a tiny bit more human again once he was finished with it. Still, the mist around his senses did return, stopping him from focussing on anything other than his son, how he was doing, what had happened, if he would recover. He didn’t think he’d been able to find his way back to the right ward if Harry hadn’t guided him.
Scream into your pillow, walk, write, talk to an owl, but do not hold on to your anger just because it is justified. Anger leaves no place for lightness. If we are giving advice anyway, I would also like to suggest not to doubt my loyalty when it comes to being your friend. I was not put in Slytherin for nothing, I am loyal to a fault.
But Draco didn’t even respond. He just slumped against him, seemingly too tired to even sit up. Neville’s heart ached with worry as he watched the pain of his friend.
“Minister!” Kingsley looked up to find Hermione Granger walking briskly towards him, looking unnaturally awake for someone with her workload on this hour. “What are you doing here? Is there something amiss at the ministry?”
Healer training had its good days, but right now it just wasn’t funny anymore. His feet were sore, his ankles were swollen and aching, and his back had been permanently cramped up for weeks now.
“Shall I lie with you and warm you up?” Scorpius nodded and Draco was under the duvet before his son could even blink.
As for what you said about not feeling like you can talk to your friends, I find myself very understanding of that feeling. I have been there. Your friends move on, start new things, and when you feel stuck in the past they are growing out of, it may seem like they are leaving you alone, like they are moving on, not just from their old pain, but from
Potter was taken aback by his honesty, and looked even sadder than Draco felt. It was rather strange, given that they’d only just seen each other again after nearly seven years. There was no reason for Potter to be so invested in his well being. Draco himself didn’t care that much, not even on good days.
He brushed passed the baffled Weasley without granting him a single glance and apparated away in the middle of the store despite the fact that he’d get a fine for that. It took everything he had not to plant his fist or a nasty hex in Percy’s face and doing that would get him far worse than a fine.
“Hey there, stranger.” Draco looked up. It was Ellis, his first muggle friend and old bar tending colleague. She looked a lot older than last time they had met, despite her pink hair. “You okay?”
He sometimes sang Harry to sleep, when his nightmares were rough. He got the hang of nappies after just two tries, and somehow babies always fell asleep around him. Just after Draco had moved in with Harry, they’d discussed having kids. They both wanted nothing more, especially Harry when he saw how brilliant Draco would be as a dad, but Draco wanted to wait.
I found myself taking pain killing potions just before dinner each evening, under the disguise of a headache, but in reality I was still numbing myself to what used to happen during dinner in the war. It took me two years to finally realise I was doing that, and even longer to fully stop. Habits like that keep our body and mind in fight or flight mode, which comes with a free bucket of stress and fear and anger that you do not need in your life.
Draco guessed that the man in his arms had tried to be strong for everybody else, and in turn people forgot he was hurting too. It was a role older siblings often played. Hide your pain to keep the family together.
The house I live in is definitely the complete opposite of yours. It was used heavily during the war as a headquarters. I have cleaned it up a lot, but I admit I haven’t changed much about it. It was my godfather’s house, and I still sort of feel that I’d be betraying his memory if I completely gutted the place and redecorated. There’s also an old house elf who is very… attached to certain things in the house and he would NOT be happy if I got rid of everything. I spend most of my time in the bedroom I sleep in, so I have changed that. I think that’s why I spend so much time in there, it feels like a much happier room than the rest of the house. It’s full of photos of the people I love most and the people who have been most important to me over the years. It will be no surprise that I have no photos of my aunt, uncle and cousin in there (but it may surprise you that there are some of my school rival and his friends).
