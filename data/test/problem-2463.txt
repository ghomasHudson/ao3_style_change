‘And it’s breaking free, right? Your dragon?’ Draco seemed to like it that Harry called it “his dragon”.
‘I won’t be allowed to be there as back-up?’ Harry could feel the uncertainty and the icy cold fingers of dread crawl up his spine.
‘Yes.’
‘Harry.’ There he went again, saying his name like that while looking at him like that. Why was this making Harry feel so unsettled?
‘I don’t like seeing you get hurt either. I think that’s kind of a given at this point.’ Harry said and Draco sighed before turning back around.
a Black, maybe? Harry really wasn’t sure how pureblood stuff like that worked). Harry had given the landlord his notice on his apartment a while ago and he’d continued to clean and revamp the old Black house. When he’d first graduated, being in the house had been too painful, everything had been too fresh, but he felt calmer now and the house made him feel closer to people that had been important to him.
Harry didn’t allow himself to feel frustrated. There was a child missing and she needed their help.
‘Well that’s good, because Robards was just here and we have a new case.’ Draco nodded at the file on Harry’s desk. ‘Hit Wizards found a warehouse full of illegally acquired potions ingredients.’
The tingling of his new tattoos combined with the warm, soft feeling of Draco’s hand in his was… maybe the best he’d felt in a while. Now that the feeling of just being
‘I’ll get one first,’ Harry offered. ‘she can get used to the idea on me and so when you get one she won’t flip out entirely.’ Ginny grinned sharply at him.
‘Oh, so the great, powerful Harry Potter will use his
‘Of course. Who else is going to make sure you don’t starve or get dehydrated? Most certainly not you.’
‘Fine?’ Harry said, more like a question than an answer. ‘She’s very capable and she hates Gaulding with a passion, so we have that in common.’
‘Like…’ Harry let his sentence trail off again. He felt a little off balance, not knowing exactly what was going on here.
‘Look at you boys, all grown up.’ She said and handed Harry his empty glass back.
‘Thank you.’ She got up from the chair, all elegance. ‘I need to speak to my son for a second, would you mind waiting here?’
‘Thank you.’ He said, smiling at her. ‘Could you tell Dawlish and Proudfoot I’ll see them tomorrow? I would really like to get some rest.’
‘We know you do Harry, but just think of how he’d react if he saw you like this.’ Hermione said. ‘He’d be so upset.’
‘This way would lead her into a residential area.’ Draco mused. ‘But someone is more likely to find her there.’
‘I know you do.’ Harry sighed.
‘Hello there.’ George said with a lopsided grin. Harry hadn’t seen that grin much since- since Fred. It was good to see. ‘So you’ve been dragging our little brother through his training, huh?’ He asked.
‘It’s tea, Potter. You look like death, drink it.’ Malfoy sat down in the seat next to Harry, smiling sharply at Ron as he made an annoyed noise before worming his way between two other seats to get to the one on Harry’s other side.
. Draco’s eyes widened to a comical size and Harry motioned for him to put the girl down. He quickly did and she sprinted towards her mum as fast as her little legs could carry her. They followed her at a more subdued pace.
‘Sorry.’ Malfoy’s voice was low and a little scratchy but he looked miles better than Harry felt, which was unfair. He held out a bottle to Harry, it looked like a potion. Harry made a face. ‘Hangover cure.’ Malfoy clarified. Harry was reaching for the bottle before he’d even properly got the words out of his mouth. Malfoy grinned at him.
‘Thank you so much.’ She said, her voice still a little shaky.
‘It’s the best option-‘ Harry pushed himself up off his chair and rounded his desk.
‘What was that all about? You were gone for ages.’
They had been through so much together and somehow they’d survived and come out relatively okay in the end. Sure, Harry woke up with nightmares almost nightly and he’d taken to taking a small dose of Dreamless Sleep every night before he went to bed so that he’d at least catch a few hours and sure Ron flinched at every loud sound and sure Hermione would sometimes still get that haunted look in her eyes and she only ever wore long sleeves and Neville would clench his fists sometimes without a clear reason, but they were alive and they’d be okay.
Comments make me squeal with delight!
‘What we
They were having a moment.
Personally, Harry wasn’t the least bit interested in being anything of Gaulding other than a colleague, but he didn’t really seem to take the hint and Harry didn’t want to be rude. So he was polite and that was about it. Ron and Draco however, had taken it upon themselves to drive Gaulding away whenever they were around to do so (which fortunately was a lot).
to comment on
They spend a few minutes disguising each other. They used Glamours, so they weren’t technically changing their appearances, just putting a layer of magic over their faces that made them look different. The temptation to layer ginger over Malfoy’s blonde hair was pretty great, but he resisted, he was trying to make friends, not enemies. Instead he went with a shorter bob, about Hermione’s colour and texture. It usually helped to Glamour with things that you were actually familiar with, it helped picture it in your mind. He went for Neville’s nose and widened Malfoy’s chin in a way that reminded him of Charlie. He also cast a quick Glamour over the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm. The sight of it made him want to squirm uncomfortably, but he didn’t.
‘I know you are, you’re good at what you do, I just don’t like the idea that I won’t be there.’
As thirty minutes stretched into an hour, Harry got worried. An hour was too long, where was he? What was happening? Harry had to grip his desk until his knuckled went white to stop himself from getting up and marching into Robards office. Draco was
and it was wonderful. Harry flexed his hands and rolled his shoulders. He turned so he could properly see Draco. He looked very blank, which meant he was probably upset. ‘Was it bad?’ Draco rolled his eyes.
‘Would you relax, you look fine.’
Harry cast a wandless, wordless Tempus and was shocked to realize they’d been here for nearly two hours. When did that happen?
Harry realized quickly that a lot of their Auror training would consist of their instructors basically throwing them into the deep end and letting them figure it out themselves. Their first course was Concealment and Disguise.
Harry moved into the small conference room so that he could spread the map out on the big table in there. The office was fairly quiet, Ron and Amelia were out of the office today searching through the ingredients that were found in an illegal potions lab. He didn’t know where Gaulding and Blueroot were, probably off somewhere doing paperwork. Baez was out with her Senior Auror partner. She’d been immediately moved up to them on the account of her prior experience.
‘Well done.’ Robards repeated before heading off.
.’ Draco snorted out a laugh, something Harry had never once heard him do when he was sober. He kind of liked drunk Draco. He liked sober Draco, of course, but drunk Draco was loose in a way his sober counterpart never was.
‘Oh Millie!’ She called out and the girl let out a sob and then started
‘Wait, shouldn’t we let the others know first before he head there?’ Draco was stood turned towards the door, but with his hand still on the map, like he’d taken a few steps and then stopped himself.
he was attempting to have a conversation with him, but he’d already asked, so he could hardly back out now. Sure enough, Malfoy looked at him like he had grown a second head. ‘Hogwarts is offering everyone who was supposed to be a seventh year last year the opportunity to take their NEWTs in about a month. They’re offering tutoring to whoever needs it and if you don’t get the results you want, you get to redo them, but that does mean you have to redo the whole seventh year, which obviously won’t start until September, but it is a pretty good deal. Sure a month to prepare isn’t like an entire year but you were always pretty good at school, right? So it might not be a problem for you.’ Malfoy blinked at him as Harry snapped his mouth shut.
‘You told me back then “you could come to Auror training with me and Weasley, it would be good for your reputation”, and I remember thinking: yes, it would be, wouldn’t it? And that’s why I started Auror training. I stuck around for a lot more reasons than just that, but that’s why I started.’
Ron dragged him along to the couch at the back of the lounge. He flopped down on it and pulled Harry onto the cushion next to him.
‘Why did
‘Are you okay?’ Draco asked and Harry turned to face him. He looked slightly better, still tired and weary, but less nauseous.
‘Yes way.’
They’d had another bad case that week and it most certainly didn’t help with the tension already between them.
Malfoy gave a far more interesting lecture on History of the Dark Arts than the instructor had given. Harry nailed his test.
‘Of course not, let’s go.’ Harry grinned at him. He didn’t mention that he would have gone right to the Manor with him if Draco wanted to go there. He was
They got promoted a month after they solved the case of the missing little girl. Robards grumbled about it, but Harry didn’t listen. They were the first of the Junior Aurors (apart from Baez) to be promoted to fully fledged Aurors and Harry was proud of it.
Gaulding had decided he was going to be Harry’s friend, if Harry liked it or not. Also, he had decided he would like to trade his current partner, Blueroot, for Harry.
‘If you make me a ginger I will hex you.’ Malfoy decided on and when Harry laughed he swore he saw the corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirk up.
‘Oh please. The guy didn’t even so much as
‘What is that even supposed to mean?’

There we go! I'll post chapter 3 on Friday!
‘How did it go?’ She asked, wringing her hands together. Her hair was in a messy bun on her head and judging by the dried ink on her fingers, Harry would guess she’d spend her day researching.
‘Like, just the two of us maybe.’ She wasn’t looking him in the eye now and Harry could feel the heat crawl up the back of his neck.
‘I still don’t like it.’ Ron crossed his arms and pouted. ‘I hate the idea of you being in that apartment all on your own.’ Harry sighed.
‘Yeah.’ He nodded. ‘From my hip to about my belly button.’ She pulled on some very Muggle looking rubber gloves and clapped her hands together.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was nearly noon by the time Harry gave up.
‘Yes and how did that end up going for him?’
‘No, I am making a completely separate point.’
a thing that happened. Draco was, just like Harry, quite recognizable. There really was no mistaking that hair. So from time to time, people would… refuse Draco things that they would gladly do for or let Harry do. Sometimes Harry used this in their favour, but it always made the discomfort crawl under his skin.
going on. Ron and Hermione had just sort of fallen together, so they weren’t really any help either.
Draco gets hurt in this one, it's somewhat graphic.
‘About what?’
‘I make potions for my friends at a much lower fee than the general supplier would ask.’
Then he straightened up, pushed himself off the chair and fixed his clothes. Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from grinning. What a prideful idiot. All about image.
‘Slytherins are adaptable.’ Draco said, leaning back in his chair.
‘Of course, we were happy to help.’ Harry said and it seemed like that was the moment where the mother really
‘Sure.’
‘Excuse me?’
what you meant?’ Harry narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. When Draco didn’t cave, Harry switched tactics.
‘So you’ll speak for me and my mother, but not my father?’ His voice was soft, like he was making sure not to be overheard. Harry looked at him over his shoulder. He’d looked older before, but now he just looked really young and a little nauseous.
‘-filled with trophies and articles about yourself.’ Harry let out a snort.
‘And I never asked you to do anything, all I’m asking is to let me handle this how I want to handle it and not drag me off into a corner like you want to knock my teeth out.’ Harry said, still softly as the guy closest to them (he may have been a year above them at Hogwarts) was eyeing them suspiciously.
He should probably take a full dose so that he’d sleep through the night, but the drowsy feeling of the potion also made him anxious because he felt like he wouldn’t be ready if he was attacked. He wasn’t sure who he’d even be attacked by. No one except Ron and Hermione even knew he didn’t live at Grimmauld place and his wards wouldn’t allow anyone but them and Harry himself in, unless invited. It was just a giant pain all around.
‘Crouch Junior did it for nearly an entire year while pretending to be Moody.’ Harry argued.
Comments make me squeal with delight!
‘Yes. These safehouses often have curses all over them.’ Malfoy was using his long legs to gain a speed advantage over Harry so he had to jog several paces to keep up with him. Harry didn’t complain like he usually would.
As Junior Aurors, they were mostly kept either at their cubicles doing investigative work, or they were send out to do the tasks the actual Aurors didn’t want to do. It was both nice and frustrating. Nice because Harry was being treated like all the other Junior Aurors and frustrating because he really wanted to actually get his own proper case.
At their graduating ceremony, they were given the traditional scarlet Auror robes. Harry smirked and leaned over to Malfoy.
he was arguing the point.
‘So did you get this for professor Malfoy?’ Harry could feel the heat rise in his cheeks.
‘Are you agreeing with Malfoy?’ Harry asked, because he knew that was a sure-fire way to get Ron to do a 180. Ron narrowed his eyes, like he knew exactly what Harry was doing.
‘Sure thing, Neville.’ Hermione said with a smile as she got to her feet as well. ‘Ron and I should head off too, we are helping Molly with dinner.’ Ron groaned as he pushed himself to his feet.
For the first time, Harry had actually felt like a proper Auror.
‘We could go get some drinks after work, unwind a little?’ Young offered. Her tone made Harry stop pacing and look at her. She looked uncharacteristically… nervous.
‘Yes it is. I held onto it and now that I’ve got the chance, I wanted to give it back.’ Harry said, he held the wand at the tip and pushed the handle towards Malfoy. Months ago he would not have dared to put a wand in Malfoy’s hands, but now? He had kind of kept Malfoy from Azkaban, didn’t purebloods take their debts seriously? He really hoped so, it would fucking suck to die here, right now, after everything.
‘I’m better, still not great, but better.’ Harry admitted.
He was beyond happy that Ron and Amelia knew about the plan. Proudfoot, Dawlish, Robards, Ron, Amelia and Harry were the only ones who knew within the department. Proudfoot and Dawlish because it was their case, Robards because he was the Head Auror, Harry because he was Draco’s partner and Ron and Amelia because she’d come up with the idea initially.
‘No, I’ll be fine. If not, I’ll scream.’ He added with a grin, but Harry could read the discomfort under it. Despite the fact that they’d been doing this for over two years now, Draco was still convinced they would one day just, fire him. Harry knew he would riot if that happened.
‘Harry?’ The voice was very familiar, but he wasn’t wearing his glasses and so everything was hazy. ‘You’re alright, just stay still, I’ll get your glasses.’ He still couldn’t quite identify the voice, but he just automatically trusted it. ‘I’m going to put them on you now.’
Not everyone from their year was there, probably only about half. Harry had known some wouldn’t come back at all (after all, not all jobs required NEWTs) and some would choose redoing the whole year come September. Harry
To be completely honest, Harry felt entirely out of his depth during the examinations. And uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. That was mostly because the assessors had all either fought with him or looked at him like he was… well, the saviour of the wizarding world. No matter how many times he told them it had not
‘Are you trying to Slytherin me?’
‘That’s nice.’ Harry said, far too late. Draco raised a singular, sharp eyebrow at him. ‘I’m supposed to head over to the Weasley’s for dinner.’ He added, he could feel the urge to babble come on, so he bit his lip to stop himself.
Ron was still looking at him like his universe had just been tilted slightly to the left and he hadn’t quite adjusted yet. Hermione had sat back down and looked… well, like she wanted to shake Ron a little. Ginny looked bored, but then again, she’d had her revelation months ago, no wait, years at this point. Shite he’d been really damn blind hadn’t he? Had it really taken seeing Draco shirtless and tattooed and
‘No, but it was the consequence of his actions.’ Harry made sure to let his eyes drift over the different wizards. ‘I won’t deny that Mister Malfoy and I haven’t always seen eye to eye, in fact, for most of our time at Hogwarts we were at each other’s throats, but I have actually learned from that, I learned that there’s this vicious circle going on at Hogwarts that makes it a breeding ground for division and hatred.’ Thank you Hermione. There was an immediate outburst of whispers all around the room. Minister Shacklebolt silenced them all with a look.
‘Hello.’ Harry said, pretty drily.
‘Need a breather, Potter?’ There was no judgement in the question, which he appreciated. Dawlish had been doing this a lot longer than Harry. ‘You should take Malfoy with you, if he gets any paler I’m gonna confuse him for a ghost.’ He motioned at the stairs behind him where Harry could just see the shiny dark shoes of his partner appear. As his hands appeared Harry could see they were clenched in fists. He did look pale and like he was trying his hardest not to show how disturbed he was.
Harry really didn’t know what to expect, but he didn’t feel particularly nervous. He had been thinking about becoming an Auror for so long and people had always just assumed that’s what he would go on to do (if he survived the whole Voldemort business obviously) he just kind of expected this to go well. He felt like this had to go well, because, what else was he supposed to do? Fighting against the dark was what he had been expected to do since he was a baby, it’s what his parents had done. It’s what he would do.
‘We need to talk about you and how you’re doing.’ Hermione said firmly, even though her voice wobbled. ‘Harry you look awful. Like a shadow of yourself. You’re always tired, you’re so skinny. All you do is work, work and work more. We barely see you anymore. Ron says you’ve been so much quicker to anger at work, you’re constantly getting in arguments with that Gaulding. You’re just not acting like yourself and we’re worried.’
‘What happened? Why can’t I move my arms?’ Harry managed to ask, although the words were a little garbled.
‘Well, I know this might surprise you, but he was a good father. He didn’t treat me badly and I never felt pressured, not until the Dark Lord came back.’ Draco said. ‘He was never the warmest, but I know he loved me. He loved me and he loved my mother and I think he didn’t ever feel like he had much of a choice either.’
years old and forced into the service of a madman. I believe that when it came down to it, Draco Malfoy did his best not to choose any side. Now while some might argue that is just as bad, there’s also such a thing as self-preservation. I personally don’t know much about it, I’ve been told that is my Gryffindor idiocy,’ there were a few soft laughs in the room. ‘but I can’t blame someone for trying to save themselves and their family. I have lost people that I cared about and I would have done some extreme things to save them if I could have.’
‘How can they not accept him?’ Harry asked, handing both of them a plate. ‘He’s Ronald Weasley.’ Harry added with a grin.
‘Yes, miss Haywood?’ She straightened the sleeves of her robes, which usually meant she wanted to ask something she wasn’t sure he was going to answer or something she thought he would say no to. Like that time she asked if he’d take them on a night-time trip into to Forbidden Forest.
‘You’ve really adapted well to this whole thing.’ Harry motioned around their new office. They’d been moved from their little cubicles to their own office, with a
He’d gone to buy himself some new sneakers late that Saturday morning, his old ones had practically been falling apart at the seams to the point where not even magic could save them. So he’d caved and went to exchange some of his Wizarding money for pounds, and he’d headed into Muggle London. It took way longer than Harry would have liked it too, but shopping was a hassle in general. It was the late afternoon by the time he made it back to Grimmauld place.
Malfoy.’
laughed when he’d been prancing around the Auror offices with blue hair wondering why everyone was snickering behind his back. He hadn’t gently pointed one particular Junior Auror in the direction of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. He hadn’t, because he was an
‘I mean, I guess I’m not blonde enough. I just thought you know, I needed to prove myself, but you’ve been really nice and respectful and you’re a
‘So, I’ve been thinking, right? About getting another tattoo.’ Harry said as Draco came back from where he’d been getting both of them a refill from the kitchen. Draco pretty much acted like he was at home now in Grimmauld place (technically he

“encouraged” to “dress respectably”, at which Malfoy had thrown a pointed look in Harry’s direction.
‘Swedish Short-Snout.’ He pulled at the bottom of the shirt, it was a little short on him. ‘They’re from, surprise, Sweden. The real life ones grow to about 22ft.’ Harry nodded.
‘I’m glad to hear that.’ He said honestly. He had not even considered how his words would effect Hogwarts, but with McGonagall as Headmistress he wasn’t surprised things would have changed.
Also, Harry thought he’d seen a lot during his years at Hogwarts, which he had, but there was so much more darkness out there in the world that he’d had no idea of. He’d seen so many more ways of wizarding folk hurting each other than he ever thought possible and some days he was just so tired.
‘Amelia Frost,’ She said with great emphasis. ‘how do we feel about her?’
had a week off and the first thing you do when you get back is get hurt. I don’t know what to do with you Potter.’ Draco turned his back to Harry, his voice stayed perfectly level, but that usually meant he was trying to hide something.
No one really spoke to each other as they waited for their turn. It seemed that nerves didn’t make people chatty.
‘Excuse me?’
‘Supper can wait.’ He said with a grin.
‘There’s something I wanted to ask, but I didn’t want to ask in front of Missy.’ Harry said and Draco glanced at him. ‘Do you miss your parents?’ Draco’s steps faltered for a second before he managed to find his rhythm again. He didn’t immediately snap at Harry.
‘First of all, I will Transfigure my own bed. How you ever got an O on that OWL is beyond me. Second of all, I have never shared a room before or since Hogwarts and I don’t plan on starting today. I will sleep downstairs.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
‘I love you, you love me, what else is there to discuss?’
Their first ever outing on their own was to an elderly lady who had contacted the DMLE convinced that her gardening supplies had been stolen by “those hoodwinks dressed in dark clothes”. They were met at the door by Marguerite. She had to have been pushing ninety and the home was like a furnace. They’d both been wearing their proper daily Auror robes, long grey pants, dark grey boots and a red coat with a triangular flap that could be fastened at their left shoulder with dark panels running along the top of their sleeves. They looked like they meant business. Too bad those outfits were
‘It’s Draco. It’s the sign I was named after.’
‘Whatever you say, Potter. Now, if you don’t mind, I am going to go home.’ Malfoy took a few steps towards the elevators and then stopped. He took a deep breath before looking back at Harry over his shoulder. ‘I don’t like owing a debt to anyone, especially not you. Figure out what you want, Potter.’ Before Harry could protest that he really didn’t
Right now my plan is to post a chapter every other day until it's finished.
He pushed himself to his feet. As he stood and watched Draco meticulously clean the blood off his own hands, Harry could feel how tense he was. He had his jaw clenched tight and his fingers were digging uncomfortably in his biceps where he had his arms crossed over each other.
‘Would you have?’ Ginny was a lot of things: a bloody good Quidditch player, a stellar dueller and a terrible chess player, but she was not sensitive.
He stood there for an embarrassingly long minute.
Harry hated it.
‘Hello, sorry. I was awake when I got Dawlish’s message. I figured I’d drop by.’ He made that sound far more casual than the whole affair had been. He also barely looked at Proudfoot, his eyes had already zeroed in on Draco, who was walking over to them, next to Dawlish. They’d been talking like old friends, comfortable.
There were about fifteen people in the room. The split between witches and wizards was pretty equal, but ages seemed to range from just-out-of-Hogwarts to mid-thirties and there was also once wizard who seemed to speak French and about three sentences of English. Harry wondered if he’d gotten lost. They went by last name so Malfoy went before either Harry or Ron. He looked stoic and calm. Harry crossed his fingers and hid them in the sleeves of his robes.
Malfoy to pay him back for anything, that’s not why he had done it, Malfoy was already off. His shoulders were back again and he looked poised, ignoring all of the distrustful looks and the whispers that followed him as he headed to the elevators as a free man.
Draco Malfoy liked him.
‘Nope.’
Harry let silence fall. He waited a few seconds before clearing his throat. Draco look at him over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow.
They hadn’t accounted for his kitchen basically being one big potions lab.
Their first day had them matched up in pairs of two. The immediate problem was, of course, that there was an uneven number of them. Now Harry, with his big mouth, had said that he’d work with Malfoy if no one else wanted to and
‘Well, let’s go!’ Harry slipped his wand in the holster along his forearm and started heading to the door.
‘I am.’ Harry swallowed. ‘I had a hard time, for a while.’ He admitted, but he refused to look at Draco. They headed into the hallway and Harry steered them up the stairs. ‘But I’m much better now.’ Draco hummed behind him.
, like Wizarding pictures did. It was
‘Hey ‘moine.’ He caught her as she flung herself into his arms.
what my problem is?’ Draco whirled around, coat clenched in his fist. ‘That’s rich coming from Harry “I’m fine” Potter.’ Before Harry even had time to process what he was saying he was already out of the room and he heard the front door slam.
‘What about you? Haven’t
‘It is the worst I’ve seen, and I’ve seen a lot.’ Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest, pulling the red coat taut over his shoulders.
‘Oh shite, I didn’t even think about it.’ Draco hurried back towards Harry. ‘I’m so sorry, Harry. The inside is completely redone, I promise.’ Harry swallowed thickly.
there. That seemed counterproductive.
And they lived happily ever after. Thank you again for reading and commenting and leaving kudos!
‘Maybe half?’ Draco shook his head, but from the curve of his cheek, Harry could tell he was smiling. Draco tried to distract him by starting a long (and boring) explanation about the wards and how they worked and how he was going to dismantle them. Still, he smiled.
to do. Hermione would become Minister of Magic, Ginny would become a professional Quidditch player and I’d be an Auror. It seemed as logical as Neville going to do something with Herbology.’
‘I- Okay, thank you.’ Harry smiled sloppily at Draco.
‘Are you nervous?’ Missy asked. They had just arrived at her little studio tucked away in a tiny building in Holyhead in Wales. Harry had no idea how Draco had found her. He’d been in Holyhead before to watch Ginny play, but he’d never actually properly visited the town. He’d been around when Ginny went to look for her own apartment (Molly was tearful but understanding), but then he’d just been dragged around to look at several different places that all seemed equally nice to him.
‘You absolute hypocrite.’ Harry snapped. ‘I “obviously wasn’t okay”? What about you, huh? I know you haven’t been as okay as you want everyone to believe you are but you don’t see me go running to, I don’t know, Pansy or Blaise.’ Draco’s eyes seemed flare as his temper sparked.
‘I think Pansy and Daphne would have something to say about that.’ Draco motioned at him with his glass, the liquid in it sloshed around dangerously, but Harry couldn’t find it within himself to care much. ‘They would also have something to say about your glasses.’ Draco frowned a little. ‘
‘I’m pretty sure it’s supposed to be.’ Draco said with a sigh.
Malfoy snapped his eyes away from Harry after only a beat and fixed his eyes on the floor somewhere. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen Malfoy look more… lost. Harry stuck his hand in his pocket just to make sure the wand was still there.
and Harry could feel the emotions roll through his system. This is how he wanted to remember them, like the two smiling people in the photograph he had. Alive and warm and free. He blinked back his tears as he looked back up at Missy, whose grin had softened into a warm smile.
‘Professor?’ Harry looked up to find one of the fifth years standing at his desk.
‘Alright, now, here’s the final design.’ She handed him a sheet of thick parchment paper. ‘Take a good look at it, tell me if there’s anything you want to change, even if it is just a detail.’
‘How do you do that? How are you just okay again?’ Harry flinched at the desperation in his own voice.
‘Excuse me?’ Harry found himself saying. ‘You went to Ron and Hermione?’
‘Draco,’ She turned her cold eyes towards Harry. ‘Mister Potter.’
He liked Young, she was capable and smart and feisty and she had humour and she’d be great as

‘No it’s not. This is the
‘That sounds good.’ Harry looked down at his clothes. ‘Are you going to make me change?’ He grinned as Draco flinched. Since Draco had taken Harry to get “proper, adult clothes” he had really toned it down on the constant complaints about Harry’s fashion sense. He would still comment when Harry made what was, according to him, bad combinations, but his tone was more gentle. Like he was actually trying to
‘What would you want to get, Harry? I hope you will put some thought into it, these are very permanent yes?’ Hermione pressed gently and Harry was once again reminded how much more restraint she’d learned over the years. Back in the day Hermione would have already been half way towards panic and convinced Harry was about to ruin his life.
‘Yes Potter, it was bad.’ Draco moved so that Harry could look at him a little easier. He had his arms crossed tightly. ‘Whatever it was, your temperature
‘Lovely, we can discuss getting you some new glasses.’ Harry made a disbelieving sound.
‘This is not about pride.’ Malfoy growled out, clearly still annoyed. ‘You just don’t
to get a good night’s rest,
Maybe he should have just been a Gryffindor and asked him out, but every time he opened his mouth to try, nothing came out. There was still a tiny sliver of doubt in his mind. This tiny voice at the back of his mind that said “but what if he doesn’t like you like that, do you really want to risk losing him entirely? He will ask for a different partner” and that filled him with so much dread he choked up every time.
‘What?’
‘Excuse me sir, you cannot go in there.’ The first person to try and stop Harry was an Auror placed at the door to the courtroom.
‘Hm.’ Draco sounded a little weird as he hummed. ‘How was it? Working with her?’
Oh. Yeah, kind of.
‘Harry, mate, you look awful.’ Ron said as he leaned in.
‘Yes, it is most certainly stupid, among other things.’ Malfoy said. ‘It’s okay though, I’m going to see her at dinner. I think she has prepared something special.’ He titled his head, this hair was falling out of its carefully constructed style. Normally he would already have redone it with a spell by now, but maybe the beer had actually loosened him up a little. ‘She was very specific in what time I needed to be home.’ Harry should tell him about his hair, he couldn’t go back to his mother like this. Harry could just push the rebelling strands back into place… well, the beer was surely making
‘You know, Potter, I never really saw the “could have been a Slytherin” thing before, but I see it now.’ Harry was pretty sure that was supposed to be some kind of insult, but he meant what he said, so he held his ground. ‘No one will want to work with him, have you thought about that?’ Harry didn’t like how they were talking about Malfoy like he wasn’t there.
Finally! I know it's taken ages, but they finally figured their shit out! Only one more chapter to go, it probably won't be super long, but I do really want to wrap the story up nicely and show you where the boys end up and how they're doing!
‘Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter,
‘It’s the wards, sir. They’re hiding the building.’ God Harry
‘I hate it, but I understand.’ Harry had to force the words out of his mouth, even if he did mean them. The relief in Draco’s face was nearly painful. ‘I’ll miss you.’ The words slipped out before Harry had a chance to stop them. Draco had been moving to push himself off his desk, but he froze at Harry’s words. He let himself rest against the desk again with careful movements, like he was afraid to startle Harry.
‘No you wanker. Your tattoo.’ Draco smirked.
‘Yes I can call a House Elf, they can pass the message on.’
are you here?’
‘Well that’s great and everything, but I need the glasses
‘Oh no it’s fine, he already told us he was going to miss that week.’ Ah, so as usual, Draco had planned ahead.
‘Oh fuck off Draco. That’s bullshit.’ Harry snapped. ‘I told you I’d had a rough time for a while, but I wasn’t lying when I told you I was doing much better-‘
. You can… pay me back for keeping you out of Azkaban by never using the M-word to describe Muggleborns again. You can pay me back for your mother and friends by never making fun of Ron’s family for being poor again. And you can pay me back for the Auror stuff by- fuck it I don’t know- by paying me one Galleon.’ Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. ‘Would that satisfy your hurt pride?’
‘Bloody hell, Malfoy.’ He tried not to sound angry but his heartbeat was up and his head was pounding along to the rhythm of it. ‘Don’t scare me like that.’
Now, the booth was pretty small and with the addition of George the booth
‘Auror Potter.’ Parkinson changed into her put together, blank-faced self, right before his eyes. It really was quite impressive how they were able to do that.
‘Well now you do know so

‘Did I?’
we find the girl.’
Harry didn’t allow his nerves to spread any further than his fluttering stomach. He’d faced down Voldemort, he could do this too. The Minister went through what seemed to be the standard witness spiel and reminded Harry that lying in the court of law could be punished with imprisonment. Harry was tempted to roll his eyes but he didn’t because that seemed rude and the last thing he needed was a headline tomorrow questioning if The Boy Who Lived (Twice) had lost his manners in the war or if he’d always been this rude. There was also a flash in the back of his mind of a little lady dressed in pink and a searing pain in his hand.
invited. Harry tried to argue, but Draco quickly shut him up and shoved him into the briefing. It happened like that twice more before Harry put his foot down. Nine months after they’d started officially working as Junior Aurors.
‘I am very happy. Let’s go get some lunch.’ Draco tilted his head but shrugged.
‘Then I will stay here with you until Ron goes home. You want
‘It’s- no, I mean, I just didn’t realize-‘ Ron stuttered. ‘But- but, he’s

that I said something in there?’ Harry asked. ‘They were being unfair. I would have done that for anyone.’
to Draco. Oh Merlin, had he really asked if Draco’s hair was soft? He flinched at his past self.
‘Fine, but I do not want to go to a pub. The floors are always sticky and these shoes were expensive.’
‘It’s here?’ Harry asked, taking a few steps back towards Draco. Suddenly he felt it, the thrum of magic. ‘Oh yeah, it’s here.’
He wasn’t alone for very long and it wasn’t Draco who came bursting through the door.
Harry was out of his bed before he even realized what he was doing. There were no coordinates, no nothing, just a message. A curtesy call, if nothing else. But he was awake now and there was no way he was going back to sleep. Where would they take him? Would he be allowed straight home? Or would they take him to the Ministry?
‘I know, me too. Although I don’t mind it as much.’ Draco said with a wry smile. ‘I’ve always been angry at the world. Mostly for the wrong reasons, but, it’s not good for a person. It eats you up inside.’ Draco was still staring ahead. His profile looked as aristocratic as Harry remembered it.
‘Was that all, miss Haywood?’
‘Oh, is
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Uhm ouch? That hurts my feelings.’ Draco pulled up his nose.
‘Hey!’ Harry protested. ‘I do not pout.’
‘Yeah, it’s partially why Mione is so emotional right now.’ Ron said, a grin overtook his face. ‘Moine’s pregnant. We’re having a baby.’ Harry wasn’t even sure what his face did in that moment, just that whatever it was it made Hermione smile (even if it was a little watery).
‘Side-Along?’ Harry held out his arm for Draco. Draco put his hand on Harry’s arm. His fingers were still stupidly long and elegant. Harry forced himself to focus on Grimmauld place. The squeeze was over soon enough.
‘Yes, exactly. You’re the one that convinced me, actually.’ Harry tilted his head in confusion.
‘Are you here on Auror- oh sorry,
‘Why am I not surprised you are involved in this. Why is it always you, Potter?’
He knew Draco was a little different now. He almost seemed to have gone back to how he was at Hogwarts. Sharper, more defensive. Unwilling to show any weakness and he would deflect anything you said back at you. He’d lash out if he deemed you to come too close.
. He saw Draco fall into the Fiendfyre, he saw him fall off the Astronomy tower, he saw a green curse fly at him, so many of their cases where the scales tipped just the other way, he saw him bleeding out on the floor of a Hogwarts bathroom. Over and over and over again.
‘No thanks.’ Warmth bloomed behind Harry’s breastbone when Draco quickly smiled back at him and then disappeared from the room.
‘Yes, that’s all. Have a good day professor.’ She turned around in a whirl of black robes and blonde hair.
‘What?’ Malfoy rolled his eyes.
hoped they were right about this. He did not want to do nothing but paperwork until he was thirty. That would suck.
‘Clean?’
‘It was good to see you, you should join us on another lunch soon.’ She said with a clearly perfected friendly smile.
His latest addition to his collection of tattoos was a pretty special one. Well, all of them were special, but this one certainly was as well. When he’d told Missy of his newest idea, she grinned like she knew something he didn’t. Which was true.
They worked in silence for a while and it was comfortable. Harry was just about to finish the last part of his paperwork (the last file in his to do pile!), when suddenly there was the blaring of an alarm. Both him and Draco were out of their seats in a heartbeat. Harry barely managed to grab his coat off the back off his chair before he was out of the door.
She said something that might have been “give me a minute” as she headed to the kitchen. Harry looked at Ron.
is the part of the sentence you would focus on.’ He huffed. ‘Fine, yes. I suppose we are friends.’ Harry let his grin morph into a more genuine smile.
‘Good afternoon all. Potter,’ She nodded at him. ‘will you be joining us for lunch?’
Whenever he’d dated before (and oh boy had that been a
‘Why the hell didn’t you take Weasley with your Portkey?’ Draco snapped, sending a Bombarda over their cover. Harry glared at him.
‘The only one?’ Draco asked, disbelieve clear in his voice. Harry looked up with a grin.
‘I suppose that’s to be expected seeing as he didn’t come home last night.’ She tilted her head to the side. ‘Are you wearing Draco’s clothes?’ Harry frowned and looked down at himself.
‘Here.’ He pointed at the base of his spine with his bottle. ‘I want to get a lion, a serpent, a raven and a badger.’ When Draco didn’t say anything Harry twirled back around, still pretty steady on his feet. Draco had his eyes narrowed, almost like he was confused, but not quite that. Maybe he didn’t understand why. ‘For the four Hogwarts Houses. I want to remind myself that no one is entirely one house and that you shouldn’t want to be. I want to be brave and smart and loyal and cunning.’
‘Draco might think your complete lack of care about your appearance is endearing, but unless you’re planning on spending the rest of your life with Draco, you might want to make an effort. How else are you going to convince a girl to go on a date with you?’
‘Let’s make sure it’s there first.’ Harry said and Malfoy sighed but he started leading Harry down a street.
Draco tilted his head and looked at Harry.
‘Oh thank Merlin.’ Draco breathed out. Harry laughed. ‘You should wear that emerald green shirt with the charcoal grey pants.’ Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco.
They started heading down the street, Robards marching ahead of them with a slightly less murderous expression on his face. Harry knew exactly when the mother spotted her daughter.
‘I don’t think Robards would agree.’ Malfoy said, his voice was smooth as always, but there might have been something uncomfortable under it. Or maybe Harry was imagining it.
‘How do you mean?’
‘What’s wrong with my glasses?’ Harry asked, unsure if he should be insulted or not here.
‘Uh, no, no, there is not going to be a next time.’ Harry said with a stern point. He dipped one of the towels in the lukewarm water. ‘Here, get the blood off.’ Draco took the towel and actually started on his hands. His hands were covered in his own blood. Harry hated it. He meant what he said, if he had anything to do with it, he would never see Draco’s blood again.
‘I think so.’
‘What a surprise.’ Draco drawled, pushing the Butterbeer into Harry’s hand and flopping down on the couch. Harry didn’t let his snarky attitude deter him. He hopped off the couch and pulled his shirt up, twisting so that Draco could see his lower back.
She seemed to be in her late thirties. Her hair was a dark purple and cut in a messy bob. She had tattoos all over her arms (which she was showing off by wearing a sleeveless shirt). She had an easy grin and she seemed so comfortable in her space and her art that Harry wasn’t even lying. He wasn’t nervous.
Draco pushed himself off his desk and stood up straight. He was taller than Harry, when they were this close those few inches really mattered. Draco reached out and Harry let himself be pulled into a hug. He rose on his tiptoes so that he could hook his chin over Draco’s shoulder. A few strands of his silky hair brushed past the side of Harry’s face. Draco had been right, it was very soft. His arms were a little hesitant, but as Harry held on a little tighter, so did Draco. Harry fought with himself to make sure he didn’t burrow his face in Draco’s neck.
‘I don’t know, I’m having a great time.’ They were saying he was right and everything. Malfoy rolled his eyes, then crossed his arms and shifted away from Harry.
‘After Harry had to convince the Minister to actually let him do the test.’ Ron added, scooping a small mountain of rice onto his plate. Hermione raised her eyebrows at Harry.
‘No, Robards even pulled his wand on him.’ He said with a small laugh. ‘It’s like the start of a bad joke: A Death Eater walks into the Auror offices-‘
‘Good.’ Her smile turned a little calculating. ‘I heard you had lunch with Draco the other day, on a weekend?’ Ah, right.
Not that they didn’t talk. Harry send a note their first official day off and they wrote back and forth about menial things for the rest of their week off. Draco told him about the books he was reading and how the garden was doing. There was an invitation between the lines there somewhere, but the effort to make himself look presentable (Meaning: Putting on something that wasn’t pjs) seemed like a task he just couldn’t put himself to. Instead he told Draco about all the things he was cooking and then eating.
‘Goodnight, Draco.’
‘Don’t you agree that now is the time to actually choose for yourself?’
‘Huh.’ Draco looked like he was trying to process that information. Harry just poured him a drink.
When their door opened an hour and a half after Draco had left Harry really couldn’t be faulted for his first words being:
‘I know that, you more than any of us.’ Harry didn’t really agree on that, per se. ‘I’m just- I’m worried about you mate. You spend all of your time with Malfoy and you turn your back on him now without even thinking and at least once a week you come in looking like you didn’t sleep a wink and I just want you to be okay.’ Harry chose to focus on the first part.
‘I’m not here to speak for the prosecution.’ While the Auror was busy blinking stupidly at him, he slipped inside, closing the door as the affronted yelp sounded. It wasn’t packed in the room, but it was fairly busy. It seemed like they’d only just started. In the middle of the room, on the chair, waiting to be interrogated was a familiar head of white blonde hair. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn’t too late.
‘Is it better than the drab they call coffee at the office?’ Harry rolled his eyes.
‘Yeah, I’ve seen one.’ He swallowed. ‘Cedric faced it in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.’ Draco flinched.
. After my House Elf healed a giant fucking hole in your side.’ Draco pushed himself up off the couch. He still moved a little gingerly and Harry hated it. He also hated how
‘It’s just- here you are: the fearsome Draco Malfoy, stuttering and blushing because you can’t seem to say the word sex.’
Theo Gaulding.
Not only did he have feelings for Draco (Merlin now that he knew it was so
‘In losing.’ Malfoy sneered.
This had been an argument that, at its core, sparked because neither of them wanted to leave the other behind. Harry had won, but the fact that Draco even put up a fight (and not because he didn’t want to be the first one to leave, but because he didn’t want to leave Harry) felt like a big deal. Draco preached self-preservation, but he’d put that aside-
‘Oh right, you haven’t been around. I’ve been living here for the last two months.’ Harry said, he knew Draco was going to ask why. ‘I kind of lost inspiration of what to do food-wise so Hermione suggested it might be good for me to go live with Kreacher, he could make sure I ate.’ Draco watched him attentively as they headed inside.
‘Are you telling me I look tired?’
‘Right, I remember that.’ Draco said. ‘That’s not why I chose it though.’
‘You’ve called me Draco for years at this point.’
‘Yes to the dinner, no thank you to the sleepover.’
de-curse this mysterious Death Eater safe house. I want your reports done by Monday and I’m sending someone by here tomorrow morning to check if you finished the house.’ Before they could respond he marched off.
‘Is that so.’
‘You too miss Haywood.’ Harry stood as she left the classroom and twisted his torso a few times to get the cricks out of his back. The professor’s chairs weren’t necessarily more comfortable than the students chairs had been.
‘Good afternoon.’ Harry called out, they hadn’t been planning on meeting up, but maybe there was something about their latest case that wasn’t quite finished?
‘Well, what about yours?’ Harry pointed lazily in the direction of Draco’s head. ‘It’s all shiny and sleek and it looks so soft. Is it soft?’ Draco bopped his head up and down.
It had been a strange day when he realized that, but they’d worked together so much and spend so many hours in each other’s company that it was only natural, right? Plus, he still called him Malfoy out loud, so it wasn’t like he needed to know.
Harry looked back to check if Malfoy was okay and to his surprise Amelia had come to stand next to Malfoy and she was smiling her serene smile at him. He looked a little uncomfortable, which meant she couldn’t be acting mean towards him. Whenever someone did that he’d look bored.
, good merciful Merlin, he had a boyfriend now. Draco Malfoy was his boyfriend. If anyone had told them back at Hogwarts things would turn out this way he would have told them to go get their head checked at St. Mungo’s.
‘Wizarding tattoos can.’ Draco said, he looked a little uncomfortable, but not angry, which was his general go to when Harry saw/ did/ asked him something he didn’t want (him) to see/ do/ answer.
‘And they want you on it because you’re our resident potions expert.’ Harry sighed but flopped down in his chair and flipped the file open. Harry hated the potions cases. ‘This is the one downside of working with you.’
‘Your hair confuses me, Potter.’ Draco said, struggling sincerely with Harry’s last name. ‘How does it work? It defies’ Harry was pretty sure that’s the word he was trying to say. ‘gravity.’
‘Yeah, I was awake anyways, figured I’d come see if there was anything I could do.’ Amelia smiled knowingly.
‘That’s ridiculous, why would someone go through all this trouble to-‘
All that hatred and war were good for was destroying lives and Harry had seen enough of that for a lifetime. He just wanted to put it behind him.
‘Fine.’ Malfoy stuck his hand in his pocket and his hand emerged with a single Galleon pinched between his stupidly slim fingers. ‘There.’ He tossed the coin Harry’s way. He didn’t even fumble the catch, Seeker reflexes. Malfoy turned on his heel and headed down the street after tossing a final: ‘I will see you when the courses start.’
‘How was your day?’
Draco seemed to have accepted early on that this was what their lives would be for the foreseeable future. He was also better at research than Harry was. At least, he had more
, this is stupid.’ Ron stepped to the left as Harry tried to dodge around him. Shit, his friend knew him too well.
, who’d have thought?’ She leaned back in her chair and grinned. Harry just didn’t quite
‘Excuse me what? My type is what now?’
After thirty minutes, George and Ginny came along. Ginny had been allowed to leave Hogwarts for the weekend in order to come see her brother’s graduation. Ginny grinned at him and stole what was left of his beer. Harry didn’t protest, it would be futile.
Harry’s stomach growled. Draco rolled his eyes, so he’d definitely heard that. Harry smiled sheepishly and started breaking pieces off the cookie and eating it slowly, savouring the taste. These cookies were easily the best thing they had in the Ministry cafeteria and usually it was an outright battle to get one. Draco knew Harry loved them and somehow, he always managed to get one, no matter the time of day. Harry was convinced he was bribing the lunch lady, he just hadn’t found proof yet.
‘Mind if I crash at yours? I don’t really want to turn up at the Manor at 4am.’
‘No it’s not, it’s James.’
‘Yes, you obviously weren’t telling me the truth with your whole “it wasn’t that bad” and “I’m fine” routine, so I went to your friends-‘
‘Probably not. We couldn’t risk being seen together.’ Draco said softly. ‘It would only put me in danger.’
When he saw Draco the next day, it was like he just
‘Wait, what do you-‘
‘That was only after a year.’

‘What can I say, I have terrible impulse control.’ Draco rolled his eyes and murmured something that sounded suspiciously like “bloody tell me about it”. Missy laughed and turned to Harry.
‘- like the ones still out there and I think I can help catch them. I was raised with these people, I know how they think, how they act when they’re under pressure, I know their tactics. I could be useful, Minister.’ Malfoy sounded so… earnest. When did he learn to do that?
‘Huh.’ Harry said before going back to his work.
‘No, I think it
Footsteps behind him had him snap out of it. His hand went for his wand without even thinking about it. He caught himself just before he threw a hex over his shoulder. He forced himself to breathe. The person behind him cleared their throat.

figured that out?”? What are you on about Ginny?’ Ron asked, his horrified tone settled a pit in the bottom of Harry’s stomach. Ginny rolled her eyes at her brother.
‘No, but, seeing yours, I might want one.’ Harry’s hand automatically reached up to try and flatten his fringe. ‘I kind of like the idea of
‘We don’t know how long this will take, Harry and I’ll be under more scrutiny than he was.’ Harry could feel his heart squeeze at the thought of Draco going undercover for a
‘I was worried-‘
‘What?’ Draco asked after a few more beats of silence.
‘You are
Harry did absolutely nothing for six days out of his week. He didn’t do much except sleep, eat and sleep some more. He missed Draco like something fierce, but he wanted to test how long he could go without him before he drove himself mad. Apparently, he could handle a week.
‘Hey, that was not garbled. I made perfect sense.’
‘Soon.’ Draco said. ‘They have a patient currently in St Mungo’s that doesn’t look like they’ll make it. It would be the first death from these potions, but it won’t be the last. They need to be stopped.’ Harry nodded, not knowing what to say to that. If this had been the other way around, he knew he would have taken the assignment too, he just hated the idea of Draco going off without him, without any back-up.
‘I was thinking about Potions.’
‘Yes, sorry for keeping him from your weekly lunch. I didn’t realize until later.’ Harry said with a small flinch.
‘Harry, sit down.’
So he got paw prints walking up his right side for Sirius and the Whomping Willow that would actually change seasons on his right shoulder blade for Remus. He got them both in one sitting and on the last day of his break. It just felt right to have them with him as well. They’d been so important to him growing up, both in their own ways.
The two assessors called the first Auror-hopeful inside and Ron immediately grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him to a corner slightly away from everyone else.
‘An old Death Eater safehouse. They’re warded to all high heavens, hidden.’ Draco said on a heavy exhale. ‘I think my father took me there once when I was a kid. I remember him telling me that children could often go through the wards without problems because they hadn’t grown into their magic yet. Therefor the wards don’t recognize them as wizards, but more like…  magical animals.’
‘That’s amazing.’ He managed. ‘Congratulations.’ He hurried forward and nearly tripped over the coffee table in his haste to get to them. He hugged Hermione first and then Ron.
‘Come with you to where?’
‘Nice.’ Harry shifted a little to get comfortable.
‘I think you should stop being an Auror.’ Harry felt like his stomach dropped down to his feet. Draco didn’t love him back, he didn’t even want to be Harry’s partner anymore- ‘Because I love you too and I can’t watch you destroy yourself.’ Harry was pretty sure that blinking stupidly wasn’t really the most normal response to hearing that the person you were in love with loved you back, but here he was doing exactly that. ‘I don’t know if you even realize it, but you hate this job.’
‘We should also take our robes off, blend in with the muggles.’ Harry proposed. Malfoy made a face, but he did take his robes off and handed them to Harry to put in his Bottomless Bag. He looked, yet again, more like a royalty than was really good for blending in. They weren’t supposed to stand out. Malfoy stood out. ‘Okay, you can’t wear that.’ Harry shook his head. ‘Take the waistcoat and the tie off and roll up your sleeves.’
‘You’re acting like a dismissive arsehole again. I thought we were done with this?’ Harry said with as much bite as he could muster. It wasn’t a lot. The look on Draco’s face seemed blank at first, but Harry could see the tightness around his eyes and the downwards pull of his mouth. He was angry. Harry just didn’t understand why.
‘Lighting?’ Harry managed to ask. Draco cleared his throat.
‘Is it a secret?’ He asked, because it seemed weird. If Harry had a masterpiece like that on his back, he’d want to tell everyone about it.
Draco?’
‘I swear to Merlin Potter, if you get hurt, I am going to kill you.’
‘I am Head Auror Robards, I would like to know how my people are. Aurors Frost and Weasley?’ Robards stepped up to the Mediwitch behind the counter, doing a great job at sounding important and firm. Kind of like the tone Draco could do very well too. The Mediwitch seemed to want to let Robards in but she glared at Harry and Draco so sharply, he didn’t think his name was going to get him past her. So he let Draco guide him away a little as Robards was let through the door. Draco’s hand on his upper arm was soft and Harry just let himself be led away as he kept his eyes on the door.
‘So, uh, I didn’t see your mother at the graduating ceremony.’ Harry said, shifting in his seat a little. Now that there was so much space in the booth it felt a little weird to be sitting so close to Malfoy, but putting space between them now also felt weird. So Harry just stuck to wiggling his leg and turning his beer glass between his hands.
‘Find Weasley and Frost and get them the hell out of there.’ Robards said sharply, stopping at the small door. Draco and Harry nodded in unison. Harry could feel the adrenaline rush through his system as Robards blasted the door open. Harry was in the door first and he immediately had to cast a Protego. A stunning spell ricochet off it and exploded a crate sitting near the wall. Harry found cover behind a pallet filled with heavy concrete blocks and he surveyed the scene.
.’ Harry looked down at his hands and yes, they were shaking.
‘Malfoy, Potter you’re coming with me. Juniors you are staying here,
‘And?’ Hermione asked. She was grinning widely so Harry assumed she’d gotten straight O’s.
‘If she went this way she could have ended up in the forest.’ Harry said, tracing his finger along a small alleyway between two buildings that would lead to the woods that the village backed into. Harry took out his wand and circled the alleyway. It would give the Aurors on the scene a little notification.
‘Yes, as long as you walk like you know where you’re going and like you’re supposed to be there, people generally don’t bother you.’ Malfoy said, as he automatically straightened his spine and tipped his chin up.
‘Guess.’ Draco rolled his eyes.
‘You did good calling for back-up.’ Harry said quickly, sending three Stunners over their cover in the direction of the bad guys. ‘Portkey?’
‘Yes, ma’am and this is my partner, Draco Malfoy. He’s the one who found Millie.’ He smiled at the girl as he said it and she nodded her head vigorously. The mother blinked a few times, she clearly also recognized Draco’s name, but then she smiled carefully.
will know.’ Harry said before bringing out the puppy-dog eyes. ‘Please?’ Draco did that thing where he made his face look blank, but it really meant that Harry was getting to him. When he rolled his eyes it meant he caved.
‘What makes you ask that?’
‘Yes, Minister.’ Malfoy said, making a good effort not to sound as snooty as he normally did when people didn’t treat him like he felt like he should be treated.
They went back to the Manor for lunch with Draco’s friends and Harry was glad he was there to see the look on their faces as Draco casually said: “thanks love” when he handed him the sandwiches.
‘What?’ Harry asked immediately.

Harry woke up feeling like Death and like something had died in his mouth. He felt around on his bedside table for his glasses.
‘I don’t intend to, Minister.’ Malfoy said, his voice still a little rough, but unwavering. Minister Shacklebolt dipped his chin in acknowledgement and then waved a hand at the doors, which opened.
‘What are you on about?’ Malfoy asked, his voice rough.
Amelia Frost smiled sheepishly at them as she found a seat. Harry liked her. She was a few years older than them, smart as a whip and a great dueller. She was also Ron’s trainee partner and had a talent for being
‘Good. I enjoy being entertained.’ She sauntered over to the table and headed to the other side to sit down. It seemed like a very deliberate choice of chair. Maybe they all had their own spot? ‘Where

‘They might not hire us.’

asleep.’ Understanding dawned on his face.
‘Yes, I liked that too.’
‘Harry!’ Hermione’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts. She looked frazzled and scared. Harry hated it when Hermione looked scared. It had been so long since he’d seen that expression on her face and he hadn’t missed it.

‘That actually sounds very nice, Harry.’ He smiled back at her. Yeah, this was good. He was going to do this.
‘Oh, sorry.’ He said. The young woman turned and looked at him with dark eyes.
And that was that. The first proper case they’d solved together. Harry wanted to grin and poke at Draco until he laughed and then go have a Firewhisky to celebrate, but Robards was still there, so Harry held his tongue.
‘Can we just stop?’ Harry asked as he stopped in a shadowy part of the alley. ‘We’re both nervous, we need to get going, we only have an hour to get back to the offices.’
He knew, intellectually, that he had to eat and Ron and Hermione tried, but they weren’t with him all day every day like Malfoy had been. They didn’t see the things Harry saw. He ran out of the stash of Dreamless Sleep that Malfoy had left him and he just… didn’t get new ones. So he started sleeping even less.
‘Thanks for staying with me and everything, but you could go home and get some rest. Technically our day is over and since Robards was there, he can do the paperwork for this one himself, right?’ Harry offered with a grin. Draco looked at him.
Draco looked like he was debating if he was going to try and hug another pillow. He’d collected about five of the small pillows that had been on Harry’s couch and was now cuddling them. His long, slim arms were wrapped around them, he had lost his fancy silky shirt at some point, claiming Harry’s apartment was like a furnace and he’d been left in his white undershirt. Harry was occasionally distracted by the dusting of almost silvery hairs on his arms.
‘Yeah, well, too bad. The hair and the glasses aren’t going to change.’
Still, he smiled to himself. Mondays were usually quite rough, the students were still with their heads in the weekend, and to be fair, so was Harry. Especially since he’d been away from Hogwarts and hadn’t had much chance to see Draco.
After they’d graduated Draco had dragged him to Gladrags Wizardwear where he’d gotten Harry to spend more on clothes in one day than he had spent in the last nineteen years of his life. His closet now consisted of more than just plain black robes, old jeans and hoodies. He had button ups and a few
‘Yes, I was wondering when you were going to come and ask for one. You need to take better care of yourself, Potter. I’m not going to do it for you.’ No, but Draco would.
‘Are you actually out of your mind?’ Malfoy asked. His eyes wide. They really were grey, weren’t they? ‘You actually believe they’d let me be an Auror?
‘Well, have you decided?’ A posh voice interrupted his search. He looked up and found- well, what had to pass for Malfoy’s muggle version. He had taken off his robes, just like Harry and he was wearing a crisp white shirt with an actual tie and matching waistcoat, both in a dark, rich green. He was wearing slacks and shiny shoes and he looked expensive and… well, good. He
‘Well, go on then Malfoy.’ He said impatiently when Malfoy kept staring at the floor. Those cool, grey eyes turned to him, disbelieve written all over his face.
‘Draco, it was good to see you. Cut your hair.’ She smiled sweetly at both of them. ‘Bye now.’
‘Yes, of course.’ Harry took a step to the side to let them pass, but she paused before walking past him.
of all kinds of creatures everywhere and the
Comments make me squeal with delight!
That was their first case together.
The feeling was like needles stabbing him everywhere the stuff had hit bare skin. He could feel his temperature soar and he remembered feeling like he couldn’t breathe.
‘Yes, it would definitely have been interesting.’ She smiled at him and patted Malfoy on the shoulder.
‘Okay, now I already explained most of this to you in our correspondence, but basically as I apply the ink I will also be infusing the magic that will make it move. Now I can’t use your magic for that obviously, I have to use my own. That means that it can hurt from time to time as I apply it and it might be itchy for a day or two after, if it lasts any longer, you might have to come back so I can see what’s up.’ Harry nodded. He’d read all of the information she’d send him more than once.
‘Sure thing.’ He was pretty sure her mother was the only one in her family to go to Azkaban. She’d schooled her features into a bland, pleasant mask when he’d gotten close enough to have a normal conversation.
‘Yes mum.’ Draco glared at him, but his glares had stopped intimidating Harry a long time ago.
‘I could see you ribs!’ Draco threw out, pushing himself off his chair and pointing an accusing finger at Harry.
‘Okay, I can give you her information.’ Judging by the look on Draco’s face he could tell that wasn’t quite all Harry wanted.
‘So, um, what species is it?’ He handed Draco the shirt and to his credit he didn’t comment on it, but just pulled it over his head.
‘Why?’ Draco asked, but his tone said he had already pretty much agreed.
‘What’s this?’ Harry asked, taking another deep breath, trying to identify the tea.
‘What do you mean “have you only
Something squeezed in Harry’s chest. He cleared his throat and Draco whirled around. A lock of his hair fell into his face, he pushed it away with an annoyed gesture.
‘This morning?’ Harry answered, a little confused.
‘I am better than you at many things.’
The young wizard’s name had been Rory and he’d only been seventeen. They were too late. Harry had taken one look at the body and left the room. He couldn’t. He wanted to force himself to go back in there and do what needed to be done to find the crazy bastard who had done this, but he couldn’t make his feet move. He just
‘Who do you think I am, of course it is.’
‘Dray, stop arguing and go. Ron needs a hospital. I’m trusting you with him,
‘Harry,’ Ginny said in a soft tone she didn’t generally use. ‘did you really
‘Well- I mean- kinda?’ Draco rolled his eyes, but he smiled Harry’s favourite smile. The quiet, exasperated, fond little smile he’d only ever seen him smile for Harry.
with Voldemort. I do not believe he ever had a choice or a chance.’
‘Yes, about you and how you almost killed yourself just because I left on an assignment for a while.’ Draco’s voice cracked in a way Harry had never heard it do before. ‘I went to talk to Weasley and Granger yesterday, she’s doing good by the way, really getting round now, and they told me how bad you’d really been. I can’t believe you, Harry, I leave you alone for a year and you just stop eating and sleeping? What-‘
‘You most certainly do.’ Draco said pulling his nose up. ‘Now before you argue, let’s go start on this house.’
I'll be back on Sunday!
‘I truly don’t understand why you’re so upset about this. I am just concerned!’
‘Humility has never gotten anyone anywhere.’ Harry rolled his eyes. Damn Slytherins.
‘- you have actual experience with Dark Wizards, you know how they work, how they think. I say it’s an advantage.’ He was dealing with a Slytherin, he should play him like a Slytherin. ‘Also, it’s a very respectable job. It’d be good for your reputation.’
.’ Draco growled out. He was sweating now and he looked even paler than usual, practically translucent. A wave of worry crashed over him.
It was a message from Dawlish.

Unlike what Draco and Hermione seemed to believe, he
‘I would answer your questions, but I don’t really remember them.’
‘Frame him? Because they want him out of the way.’ Harry threw his hands up in frustration. He was going to
‘I will see you in seven days.’ Harry nodded sharply before hurrying out of the house, away from the smell and the blood and the death. Draco was waiting for him at the door.
‘Mister Potter?’ Minister Shacklebolt asked. Harry smiled at the Minister.
?’ Draco snapped, drawing Harry’s eyes away from the gash on his side.
‘Good.’ She turned in a flurry of dark hair and a sharp smile and then she was gone. Harry breathed out, releasing tension he wasn’t even aware he’d been holding. He was almost a little annoyed with himself that he couldn’t talk to her like he could talk to Ron or Hermione or Neville or Ginny. Their history was exactly that: history. He vowed that he’d ask Draco if he could join them for another Saturday lunch soon.
‘What? Yes, I’m fine. All good. Do you know if Amelia has family?’ The words came out painfully sharp and actually a little panicked. Why the hell was he panicking
‘Oh okay. That’s good. Thank you.’
‘You chose this one.’ Harry said, maybe not with the right infliction, but Draco seemed to get what Harry was trying to say because he actually smiled.
Thank you so much for reading! I'll be back on Wednesday. If you want to see the art that I am basing the Auror uniforms off it's this: https://boaillustration.tumblr.com/post/158822344785/i-read-a-lot-of-auror-case-fic-recently-and-wanted
Harry knew his silence was a big red flag. He just couldn’t let himself bite out the first thing in his head which was a resounding “
That Sunday, Harry went and got the three new tattoos he’d been talking about. Missy had been delighted to welcome him back and she didn’t have any other appointments that day. Draco came with him, just like old times. It was something familiar and the way Draco smiled at him made Harry’s stomach flutter.
‘I invited him. Saturday’s are when I have lunch with my friends, I consider him a friend now.’ Parkinson nodded slowly, pressing her lips together in an amused sort of look.
‘I have never signed a forehead in my life.’
‘What did you want to know?’ He always tried to encourage curiosity in his students. Especially because he knew that if they didn’t come to him for answers, they’d go look for them elsewhere and that was probably more dangerous.
‘I will.’ Harry agreed and Amelia headed off.
‘I don’t know or care, but he doesn’t look happy.’ Ron observed.
That was probably why he didn’t see the whole thing coming.
. ‘Thank you for inviting me.’ Technically Harry had invited everyone, but he had the idea that might be what Draco meant.
His mind felt slow and sluggish, but soft and floaty. It wasn’t unpleasant per se.
‘Oh.’ Harry said. ‘Can you undo the restraints please? I won’t try to punch you, I promise.’ Draco hit whatever was binding Harry with a
Thank you for reading! I'll be back on Wednesday.
‘Right.’ Harry remembered the sensation of feeling like he was burning up. That had apparently not been an exaggeration. ‘I’m better now though?’
soft.’ He said, probably going for his usual haughty tone, but he missed the mark a little. ‘Don’t try to distract me, back to yours, have you ever tried to tame it?’
‘It’s too risky, if I got stuck with them for longer than planned it could start to ware off or I could run out.’
‘Ask me to speak for you.’ Harry pressed. Malfoy’s eyes stayed fixed on him for a good ten seconds, but then he sighed. He looked far older than he actually was, as exhausted as he looked. His skin was even paler than Harry remembered it and there were dark shadows under his eyes.
Auror and I don’t know, I’m sorry. You clearly don’t think of me that way and that’s
‘I like working with you.’ Harry replied, he could feel himself smile. Draco rolled his eyes.
‘Hey,’ Harry bumped his shoulder into Draco’s (well, more like his upper arm, those few stupid inches he had on Harry were really annoying). ‘we found the girl.’
‘And he wouldn’t do that.’ Harry added, drawing a laugh out of Ginny. He realized with a start that he’d missed her. He’d missed her no-nonsense approach to him. He missed her sharp eyes and her brutal honesty. Even though it had become clear very quickly that they weren’t going to work out as a couple, Harry was so glad they were still friends. ‘How has Hogwarts been?’
Harry lead them down the side street and made sure to pay close attention so that he wouldn’t miss the hum of the wards this time. He stopped when he felt them.
‘It’s perfect.’ He automatically passed the parchment to Draco next. He almost didn’t even register the surprise on his face. Harry made sure to smile as Draco accepted the parchment.
Malfoy disappeared from view and just like that, it was done. His mother was next and Harry applied the same tactic. He waited until the end and then told Narcissa Malfoy to ask him to speak on her behalf. She did as he asked with much less hesitation than her son had. Maybe she’d somehow already heard what he’d done, maybe she realized that whatever he’d say couldn’t hurt her chances of getting cleared too much.
Draco was… not quite the same. The differences were subtle and those who didn’t know him like Harry did and didn’t spend as much time with him as Harry did, probably wouldn’t even notice, but Harry
loosen up.
‘Mrs. Malfoy.’ Harry greeted. ‘I like what you’ve done with the place.’ He motioned to the sitting room. She smiled coolly.
pretty in a very soft kind of way. She was a few years older than them, Harry was pretty sure she was twenty two, but that wasn’t a big deal. Her hair was a warm brown, always waving gently over her shoulders. She had big, round eyes in an equally soft brown colour. She was always smiling. She was sweet and capable and she was never nasty towards Draco. ‘-so I’m not sure how I feel. Harry?
Things were not as simple as Harry hoped they would be once they became Junior Aurors. They kept most of the pairings they’d had before, keeping Harry paired with Draco. Robards may have suggested that was so that Harry could “keep an eye on” Draco. It was stupid. How many more times would the guy have to prove himself before they believed he was not a danger to anyone except the bad guys?
‘I know, step by step.’ Ginny said, she put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed. ‘You’ll be fine, young wizard.’ She said with a strange accent, making Harry laugh.
‘Alright, that’s good. So you’re getting the stag and the doe today, right?’ She asked, patting a chair for Harry to sit in.
It started with the suddenly borderline nervous expression on Draco’s face, which made Harry pause. Draco normally didn’t really do nervous. He had to look twice as Draco slipped his shirt off entirely. At first he wasn’t sure if he was even seeing it right.
‘Bloody fucking hell that hurt.’
”.’ Malfoy said with an eyeroll. Harry sighed.
and he wasn’t leaving anytime soon. At least, Harry really fucking hoped not.
‘I aim to entertain.’
‘Ah, nightmares.’ It wasn’t really a question, but Harry nodded anyways. ‘What do you take?’ He asked.
‘You called me Dray.’ Harry tilted his head in confusion. ‘In the warehouse, you called me Dray, no one has ever called me that before.’
‘Let’s go.’
Hermione ignored him and turned to Harry.
nearby, sometimes fellow trainee’s or even fully-fledged Aurors would take the opportunity to make snide comments at him. Now Malfoy acted like it didn’t bother him, but Harry preferred to prevent it anyways.
‘Oh come on Harry, it was a prime opportunity to get a Slytherin to swallow their pride, I can’t pass up on that.’ Ron grinned, unbothered.
‘Passed all of them. Four O’s and two E’s.’ He said holding the parchment out to her. She handed hers back to him in a trade. Sure enough, Hermione got O’s in Charms, DADA, Herbology, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes
And then he kissed him. Draco kissed him. On the mouth. Harry was pretty proud of himself for not freezing. It wasn’t like he’d kissed a guy before, or had even kissed that many people in general, but it just felt easy with Draco. He wasn’t scared or even nervous.
He was a little more paranoid. Draco had never been one to look over his shoulder. His shoulders had always been back, chin up, almost
The only reason he didn’t miss the flicker of Draco’s eyes down to his mouth was because he was staring at him so hard. If he would have blinked, he’d have missed it. He didn’t miss it.
The course was actually pretty interesting but Harry’s brain refused to focus for longer than a few minutes at a time. Luckily, Malfoy paid enough attention for the both of them. He seemed to know when to do that, sometimes he’d keep actual notes. Which Harry had told him reminded him of Hermione, which in turn made Malfoy look positively horrified. Harry just sat there in his seat in the back with his cosy sweater and his tea and tried not to fall asleep on the spot.
‘Especially once you become a professional Quidditch player and get me free tickets to all of your games.’ Harry grinned. She laughed.
‘Oh, sorry. I think she’s nice. A good Auror.’
‘Ah, yes. I will try.’
‘You have to be a Slytherin here Malfoy, you want to be there, so be there.’ Harry said as he shrugged his coat on.
‘When?’
and Weasley.’ Malfoy sounded bitter. Harry wanted to say he was overreacting, but to be fair, Robards still barely looked at Malfoy. Any praise for their pair was usually aimed at Harry, no matter how many times he redirected the praise to Malfoy, it wasn’t the same.
‘I’m not okay, but I put my feelings aside and focus on what I have to do right now and deal with the feelings later… or not at all.’ He added with a wry smile.
‘I don’t quite understand what just happened, but I will take my NEWTs. I assume I can contact McGonagall for any further information that I wasn’t able to understand from the garbled nonsense you just spewed?’ Harry narrowed his eyes.
It was on his back, and Draco generally wore layers, many layers. They’d been working together for actual years at this point and Harry had never seen him without a shirt, he’d rarely even seen him in short sleeves. That might have something to do with the ugly black mark on his forearm.
clothes. You look good, I’d dare say attractive if it weren’t for the glasses and the hair.’ Well, Draco did warn him she would have
‘I have thought about it, quite a lot since I got the idea.’ Sure that wasn’t that long ago, but whatever. When had he ever thought something through? ‘I was thinking a stag and a doe running along my side, maybe.’ Hermione seemed to consider that for a few seconds and then she smiled softly.
‘Yes, I was thinking I’d work on my report a little first and then I’d go meet them for lunch.’ Draco seemed at ease at first, but as his brain woke up, Harry realized there was a tension in Draco’s spine that wasn’t usually there anymore. Not when it was just the two of them. It was almost a little unsettling how different Draco looked, how much he looked like the old Draco, like
Until Harry realized something.
‘Oh please, you’re not getting rid of me that easily Potter.’ It seemed like he wasn’t the only one in need of some distance. Harry rolled his eyes, just because that was expected of him. He didn’t allow himself to swallow until he turned away to get back behind his desk.
‘Yay, cooking.’ He said in the least enthusiastic way possible. ‘Are you coming with us, Harry?’ Harry found his eyes drawn to the lonely figure against the wall.
It was probably because the nightmares with his old friends were familiar by now. He knew what to expect, but with Draco, his dreams were new and his mind was
They ordered the whole shebang and Harry paid for it because, as usual Ron forgot his Muggle money. Harry had taken to always carrying enough to at least buy them lunch/dinner because Ron
‘Well, you look like you haven’t slept in a year.’ Harry didn’t tell him that he already looked
Minister Shacklebolt looked at him like he wasn’t entirely sure how to feel about what Harry had said, but he also didn’t seem angry, so that was a win as far as he was concerned.
‘I- Yes. I do. I have thought about it a lot since Potter suggested it and, well, I would like to help. I know how much damage has been done by people-‘
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I understand.’ Harry said instead.
There was a strange sort of comfort in working with Malfoy. He assumed that he would have felt the same if he was working with Ron. It was comfortable because he knew how Malfoy would respond. He knew what would get him to roll his eyes, how he could goad him into snapping. He learned Malfoy’s strengths (for example, he was a damn good tracker) and his tells. They complimented each other in a strange, antagonistic sort of way.
solved this one and they can’t take that from us. We need to celebrate this.’
‘Uh.’ Harry cleared his throat. ‘Sorry, sir. I suggested Malfoy could try and see if he could become an Auror.’ Harry fidgeted with the sleeve of his robe. Robards’ eyes flickered to Harry.
Apparating was as nauseating and inside-twisting as always.
‘Uh, “hi there Millie, my name is Draco and I’m here to get you back to your mum”?’ Harry offered, tugging lightly to get his arm loose from Draco’s death grip.
When they all headed back to their own places, Harry found himself happy he went. It was always good to make more contacts, especially in places where he otherwise wouldn’t have contacts. Daphne and Pansy were hellbent on trying to convince him to get new glasses but, he found he didn’t mind all that much. They weren’t being nasty about it, in fact, they were almost funny.
‘No, we’re talking about
Eventually Draco had gotten fed up and he’d just moved all of Harry’s stuff into his room. It meant a longer walk for Harry from his classroom to their room, but he was willing to deal with that. He scratched absentmindedly at his chest as he headed for the peace and quiet of their rooms near the dungeons.
Draco, who had already been heading towards the door, stopped and looked back at him, a confused little frown between his eyebrows. Harry must have looked pretty horrified because the realization dawned on his face pretty quickly.
Hermione disagreed purely because she felt like the judicial system would handle it. She believed in it, until Harry explained that they didn’t have such a thing as lawyers in wizarding court. The accused would be expected to arrange their own defence, and who would speak for a known Death Eater but other Death Eaters and how much would their testimony matter? A month or so after the war ended and after the trails of the worst of the Death Eaters were already over, Hermione had actually been the one to initiate the conversation about “what the hell are you thinking?”. Their argument that night was actually the basis for most of his speech. She’d already thrown the arguments the Wizengamot had at him, so he’d already had a chance to think them through.
‘My aunt Bellatrix probably would have, but I never saw any of it.’ The name alone sent a hot flare of hatred up Harry’s spine. ‘She was insane.’
.’ He took a deep breath before continuing. ‘We’re even on that and if those are the things you want, I will do it.’
‘You were poisoned.’ He could hear that Draco’s jaw was clenched, even if he couldn’t really see him. ‘The stuff the suspect threw at you was a poison, it got in your system. You can’t move your arms because they had to restrain you. You were fighting the Healers, screaming bloody murder and throwing punches. They’re investigating what exactly was in the poison now.’
‘Yes, I’m fine.’
you want this, mister Malfoy?’ He seemed surprised that he was actually being addressed.
‘Well, how about this: Am I allowed to kiss you? Or is there some weird pureblood custom for this? Should I be buying you gifts? Do some weird dance? Bring an offering to the peacocks?’ Draco cast his eyes to the heavens, but stepped into Harry’s space.
And it was a good lunch. Draco insisted on paying and Harry only argued a little. He’d visited his vault the other day (the goblins still didn’t like him much after the whole “destroying their building while escaping on a dragon” thing) and he pretty much had more money than he really knew what to do with. Especially because anything that the Ministry had taken from Sirius had been returned and given to Harry, since he’d been falsely convicted.
‘Sure.’ Harry agreed. ‘Now, are we doing pizza tonight?’
and his closet wasn’t even close to what Draco’s probably looked like, but it sure as hell made Harry feel more like an adult.
. Maybe they just needed his expertise on a case. If this was about some complicated potion, Harry would be useless, it would be logical to leave him in the office to do something productive while Draco did his thing.
‘Yes sir.’ Harry didn’t ask what he’d do if she
‘Hm.’ Draco made that same strange humming noise as he disappeared into Harry’s room.
‘Malfoy is not that bad.’ Defending Draco was like second nature to him by now. ‘He’s really changed.’ Ginny hummed.
‘Thank you Kreacher.’ He made it as clear of a dismissal as he could. Kreacher disappeared with a nod.
‘I want to get a tattoo.’ Draco looked up at him from where he was sitting at his own desk. He raised a single eyebrow.
‘Thanks.’ Harry just said instead. That was vague enough, right? Harry forced himself to sit down after he’d poured himself a cuppa. He had no idea how long this might take, hell he didn’t even technically know if they were even bringing him back here.
‘Yes, I suppose I’m done for the morning. I should head off soon.’ He sounded like he almost regretted that. That look turned into something calculating. ‘You could always come with me.’ Harry blinked at him stupidly.
‘Your tongue has been in my mouth, we’re officially on first name basis.’
.’ Ron rolled his eyes but made a vague agreeing gesture.
‘Well, have fun with that.’ Malfoy said with a smirk. ‘I should be heading home.’ His smirk softened just a little and Harry was tempted to call it an actual
‘I makes sense.’ Harry defended. ‘You’ve got the NEWTs, you’re clearly smart.’ He waved the parchment at Malfoy. ‘You have practical experience,-‘
‘What
They didn’t see Draco’s mother and that was okay. Harry was actually kind of happy about that. He felt pretty certain that Draco had thought this through to the point where his mother wouldn’t be a problem, but it was still intimidating to think about Narcissa Malfoy being his boyfriend’s mother.
‘You have to prove that they can trust you and you have to be there to do it, but they won’t let you be there because they don’t trust you. You have to break the cycle. Now
There we go! First chapter done.
‘You sound like Hermione.’ Harry replied, maybe a beat too late. Draco made a face. ‘
He opened the envelope and pulled out the parchment. He skipped the whole mumbo jumbo at the beginning and went straight for the little box with his results.
‘It is not funny Ronald.’ Hemione said sharply. ‘He was cleared, he should be treated like any other.’ Harry threw a smug look in Ron’s direction.
‘And by friends you mean…?’
‘Here.’ He handed the one glass to Draco while he took the other for himself. Harry wasn’t much of a drinker, he’d have the occasional beer, but the Firewhisky had been standing around in his kitchen for a while. It had been a gift from George for completing his Auror training, so it had been there for like, nine months. ‘Cheers.’
‘Holy shite Malfoy.’ Harry checked the list again just to make sure he’d read that right. ‘You’ve only got one less than Hermione and all Os too.’
on time.
The Hit Wizards were out searching for the murderous lunatic and Harry couldn’t even make his feet move. Just- all of this destruction and why? What for? He must have looked upset because Blueroot stopped next to him from where he’d been heading into the house and looked at Harry with an uncomfortable expression.
‘That’s a star sign.’
‘Thanks Harry.’
‘Oh, you’re Harry Potter.’ Harry forced himself to smile.
When he was alone it was especially bad because he couldn’t drown himself in a conversation with someone and pretend not to notice.
‘Also, my collarbones.’ Harry said, aiming his bottle at Draco. ‘On one side, a Snitch and on the other side, lilies.’
Harry started pacing. It had always been easy to spark an argument between him and Draco. They were both stubborn and Draco knew exactly which buttons to push and the other way around, but this mini-argument had been different. This wasn’t bickering for the sake of bickering or a genuine disagreement on a theory or the approach to a case.
they wanted to stay in the same rooms. That was just too awkward. So they spend their first few years teaching alternating between their rooms during the night.
This was a moment.
‘So, you seem happy.’ Draco said as they stepped out into the sunshine. It was a ridiculously nice day, the weather seemed to reflect his mood.
to finally drive home that maybe his feelings towards Draco weren’t entirely just friendly? Apparently.
of tea?’ Harry asked.
‘This idea that the two of you seem to have that you suddenly have to feel bad for Malfoy.’ He shook his head. ‘I don’t get it. Are you forgetting everything he did to us, to
‘I hate that I let you talk me into this.’ Malfoy said in a low voice.
‘I don’t know.’ Harry shrugged. ‘I bet Hermione has a theory. Wanna grab some takeaway and ask her?’
‘No.’
make sure you don’t leave the office again for the next ten years.’ Robards smiled. That was usually worse than when he glared. ‘As a reward for your actions today, you two get to stay behind and take down the wards
‘You do look skinnier.’ Draco sighed.
‘Guys-
‘Well, you can pull anything off, of course but-‘ Harry made himself stop listening to them, but he could feel that his face was frowning a little. He made eye-contact with Ginny across from him. She raised her eyebrow at him and threw a pointed look in Amelia’s direction. He shrugged at her but she didn’t seem to be convinced.
‘I am looking forward to it.’ She didn’t count the galleons he handed over and that somehow felt nice. He did put his shirt back on, but he kept wanting to look at his side to make sure it was still there.
‘Congratulations.’ Harry grinned at Malfoy as he shimmied onto the bench to sit next to him. It had become a habit of his to form a little barrier between Malfoy and the others. Amelia usually sat on his other side.
‘-he is just the most frustratingly amazing person ever, how does he even do that? How does he manage to make me want to strangle him and just, fucking, be around him all the time?’
made plenty of stupid decisions when I was sixteen, I didn’t know what I was doing, I still sometimes don’t. Should he really be punished for mistakes he made while he was barely legal?’
‘Well, that seemed like it went well.’ Neville remarked before holding his hand out to Harry. He helped pull Neville to his feet. He brushed off his pants. ‘I am going to head home. Let’s get together at some point because I’m still not quite sure what I’m going to do with these.’ He waved his parchment with his NEWTs around.
So yes, Gaulding gave Draco and Ron something to bond over, their shared hatred for the guy trying to steal their best friend/partner. Also, Ron was starting to grin more as he bickered back and forth with Draco. They were polar opposites in so many ways, but they seemed to share a love for snarking at each other and to be honest, Harry was just really glad neither of them had tried to hex the other at any point.
realize you have a crush on Malfoy?’
Malfoy had always looked pointy. Pointy nose, sharp chin, sharp jaw, sharp cheekbones, thin lips. Pale complexion. Sharp, pointy words in that stupidly sharp and posh voice. Harry had spent enough time staring at him (trying to figure out what he was up to, obviously) to know this, but when he’d showed up to the same hall as Harry for his Charms NEWT, Harry had noticed immediately that he looked worse than the last time Harry had seen him. Which was almost impressive considering the last time Harry had seen him he’d just been in a holding cell in the Ministry for over a month awaiting his trail.
‘I would.’
‘What Lucius Malfoy did is on him, not on his wife or his son. I do not believe it is right to punish someone for the sins of their father, do you?’ Harry fired back. The wizard in question stayed silent. ‘I do actually have a reason to say the things I am saying. When Hermione, Ron and I were caught by Death Eaters and brought to Malfoy Manor, Hermione used a spell on my face to try and make me unrecognizable. So, the Death Eaters brought in Malfoy to confirm whether it was me, or not. I
partner. Harry just wanted Draco. He wanted his pointed silences and his annoyed sighs. He wanted his neat handwriting and his perfect manners. His stupidly smart clothes and his haughty tone. He just wanted his partner back.
‘I thought you already had a tattoo for your parents?’ Draco took a long drag from his bottle, his arm resting on the back of the couch. Harry wanted to launch himself at him. He didn’t. He just sighed.
‘I’m here because we need to talk.’ Oh great, all the best conversations started like that.
‘Are you- are you
‘Um, Hermione?’ He asked carefully, lowering his fork back to his plate. ‘Are you alright?’
‘Wait, you got through?’ Harry called after Malfoy. No one had immediately told Harry if he’d been selected or not.
‘I told you to think about what you wanted from me, so that I would not owe you anymore. But instead of letting me pay off my debt, you keep doing things for me and just adding to it.’ Harry blinked at his annoyed tone.
. He didn’t understand why Draco seemed to get more angry every single morning.
‘We got ambushed.’ Amelia snarled. She was bleeding from a cut along her hairline and she had her free hand resting against her ribs. ‘I don’t know what they hit Ron with, but I put him under a stasis spell. I couldn’t Apparate us out of here and we’re pinned down.’
‘Well than it must be true.’ Harry rolled his eyes.
Since then they’d been to Mister Robins whose fence had been broken by a murderous creature trying to steal his pumpkins (a fat, golden retriever that had bashed into the fence while trying to fetch a ball). Ms Hartley who was convinced her cherry pie had been poisoned by Pixies (it was not, she’d just used milk three months past it due by date). The Shawling family, whose pet toad had been kidnapped (it was found by the pond in their backyard) and little Helena who was six and had her child sized broomstick stolen by Goblins (the twin boys of her neighbour). Now they were admittedly little shits, but not exactly what Harry had in mind when he’d decided to become an Auror.
‘All done.’ She said with a bright grin. Harry let his eyes travel down his own torso.
‘What?’
‘It’s five o’clock on a Monday, let’s not get into technicalities.’ Harry walked over to him, he seemed to be correcting essays. There were rolls of parchment neatly divided into two piles. When Harry checked his students’ essays it usually ended in organized chaos, but not Draco. He ran his hand through Draco’s hair. He made a faux-frustrated noise, but he didn’t attempt to get away from Harry.
‘Oh um, that bad?’ Harry just gave him a curt nod and he flinched a little, but he did move further into the house. Dawlish came down the stairs, looking stoic.
As Hermione marched over to the desk, Draco came back through the doors. Now that Harry was actually capable of standing still, he could feel himself sway a little. Draco looked even more pale than he usually did. When had the circles under his eyes become so dark? His eyes drifted from Hermione to Harry, who was still standing. Harry could see him sigh. He seemed to drag himself over to the little table where there was the necessary equipment to make tea and coffee.
‘I thought her house arrest should have been over by now?’ Harry asked, trying to do the math in his head.
self-control, he went back to Missy and got two more tattoos.
‘You were not gone that long.’ Harry protested without much vigour, inhaling the warm, comforting scent of the tea. ‘Thanks.’
‘Sorry what?’ Ginny rolled her eyes at him.
‘I’s will do that.’ Kreacher disappeared. Draco was struggling to get his shirt off while trying not to pull on the apparent wound in his side. It looked like some kind of slash, it was bleeding quite a lot. Harry got tired of watching him struggle pretty quickly.
Slytherins, or maybe it was just these Slytherins. Parkinson seemed to find all of this immensely amusing and Harry just didn’t quite get
There was something calming about the process of getting them. The thought that he put in it, the focus it asked of him. The making of a serious decision that
, well I can also pay for a ticket myself.’ She rolled her eyes.
. Sure, they didn’t really hang out after training or anything, but they could have conversations now without getting to a point where they wanted to hex each other. He knew that Malfoy had a potions lab in his basement and that he had considered selling the Manor, but that his mother wouldn’t let him. Malfoy knew about Harry’s ongoing rivalry with the fat orange cat that belonged to his neighbour and liked to sneak into his kitchen and that Harry needed a steady supply of Dreamless Sleep. None of the more personal information was shared with intent, at least, not for Harry. It was just surprisingly easy to tell Malfoy things sometimes.
Harry wanted to ask if he missed his parents, but he managed to stop the words before they tumbled out. Draco would not appreciate a question like that in front of someone he didn’t trust. Harry filed it away for later. Draco swallowed, pulled his face back into his blank mask and nodded.
‘You could
The Minister appeared from the fireplace in the office looking tall and imposing and annoyed.
‘Of course I have.’ Harry rolled his whole head and groaned. ‘It can’t be tamed.’
‘Potter.’ She said in surprise.
there was that day they’d gotten drunk together. At first, Harry had been really good at pretending he didn’t remember because he’d been Embarrassed about it, but now, he remembered the way Draco had looked at him when he didn’t have his normal reservations.
Harry was released the same day and the guy who threw the poison at him was caught by Hit Wizards the next. All in all, a pretty chaotic return to work, not his greatest week ever.
‘Glamours.’ Harry said. ‘We used them on our face and then just made sure we blended in. Walked right in the front door.’ He handed Malfoy his waistcoat and tie.
But if he didn’t go out there and try to stop it and catch the bad ones, who would?
Their job really went from zero to one hundred and back in the blink of an eye and there was really very little in between. The strange thing was, Harry didn’t necessarily enjoy the action packed moments more than he enjoyed the slow ones. When there was action, it usually meant that someone’s life was at risk. Sometimes it was theirs, other times it was a random person, but there was always the sense of dread.
‘Yes, there’s been a string of witches and wizards ending up in St Mungo’s after taking bad potions. They figured out that these potions all came from the same supplier. An unidentified group that sells these potions for almost half the price their competition does. The potions are obviously made with bad ingredients or just bad intent, but wizardfolk still buy them because they’re cheap. They can’t seem to get anything on these people so they want me to infiltrate, get the intel we need to take them down and get out.’ Draco explained. He looked
‘Malfoy- Draco, seriously. She’s a child, she is not going to care what you’ve done before or what your last name is, she’s probably in there and she just wants to go home. Now go get her.’ Harry said firmly. Draco let go of Harry’s arm with a start.
‘Obviously, Minister Shacklebolt better hold onto his job tightly.’ Despite Ron just not quite getting Harry and Hermione’s outlook, he did send his girlfriend a proud look. Neville opened his mouth to say something when they were interrupted by a loud voice.
Their excuse for firing Draco had been that he’d supposedly used and Unforgivable on a suspect to make him talk. It was all lies, but the ease with which those not in the know accepted it made Harry feel physically sick. So many people came up to him that day saying things like “it’s not your fault Potter, some people are just bad” and “I knew he hadn’t really changed, snakes never really change”, Harry bit the inside of his cheek until it was bleeding. The coppery taste in his mouth felt fitting.
‘I am thanking him for keeping me and my friends out of Azkaban.’ She flexed her hands at her sides. ‘Now I’m leaving before your

‘No you don’t.’ Harry was surprised at the amount of confidence he felt saying that.
Gaulding. It had only been a month since Drac-
‘Coffee?’ He asked instead of diving into that.
He drank his tea, but he didn’t taste any of it. He started jiggling his leg somewhere around his second sip. Amelia, to her credit, didn’t say anything about it. Harry cast his fourth wordless, wandless Tempus. He was really restraining himself. He’d been there for an hour. It was fine, everything was fine.
‘Well yes of course it’s tea. What
is the old Black house?’ Draco looked around with a little furrow between his brows.
‘I don’t think I can do that.’ Harry said and he had to swallow down the near overwhelming wave of emotions. Draco nodded slowly.
‘Is it?’ Harry asked.
‘Obviously.’ Draco turned his head towards the clock and groaned. ‘I can’t go home to my mother like this at this hour, she’ll be horrified.’
‘You’re
‘Really? That’s the second thing you’re going to say to me after a

he supposed to use it for? The Auror, to his credit, didn’t do much more than blink quickly a few times. ‘I need to give a testimony.’ Harry tried.
‘I believed what my father taught me, but then I got to Hogwarts and I did start to have doubts. However when the Dark Lord returned it was like… like my choice got taken away as much as my father’s. I was a Malfoy, therefor I was on the dark side. I was a Slytherin, so I was on the dark side. Everyone expected me to go dark, so I did.’ He shrugged, far too casual for the topic of conversation. ‘By the time I realized what a mistake I’d made, I was in too deep.’ Draco bumped his shoulder against Harry’s in a casual gesture, but the look on his face told Harry that he was fighting his emotions. ‘And then you gave me a second chance and you forced everyone else to do the same.’
He reached out, his hands were so pale Harry could see the blue hues of his veins running under his skin. He took the wand back and slipped it into his pocket without looking at it further.
‘I wanted to thank you for what you did for my friends, since some of them are too proud to say it themselves.’ Behind her Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘I hope you know that we appreciate you trying to… help out Slytherin’s reputation out a little. It’s truly a shame you never ended up with us,’ she grinned. ‘it could have been very interesting.’ Harry wasn’t sure what to say to that, so he just went with:
‘Hey there Millie.’ Harry said with a grin as he approached her. There were tear tracks on her little round cheeks, but she wasn’t actively crying. Draco was holding her a little awkwardly, but securely. ‘Are you hurt anywhere, sweetheart?’ She shook her head as her bottom lip wobbled. ‘Okay, that’s good to hear. Should we go find your mommy?’ She nodded so hard one of her braids slapped Draco in the face. He blinked twice but didn’t say anything.
They found her gardening tools in the shed behind her home.
His eyes were drawn away from Neville’s slightly embarrassed smile, to the blonde dressed in black trying to melt into the shadows. Malfoy wasn’t too far away from them so Harry could see how tightly he was gripping the parchment with his scores. Harry hoped he got what he wanted. He was surprised to find that he wanted to go over to him and find out.
Aurors would take her to the Ministry’s Apparating point and take her to the Manor where she’d be escorted inside. Harry left the courtroom as soon as she had disappeared through the doors. He really hoped Malfoy had stayed behind to wait for the results of his mother’s trail.
.’ Robards snarled before any of the Junior Aurors trailing after him could even try. If the Junior Aurors were not allowed to come that meant it was serious. Robards turned the alarm off just before they excited the Auror offices.
‘Why don’t
‘They were taken by Healers, they told me I couldn’t go any further.’ The annoyed tone in Draco’s voice was pretty clear. ‘I’m interested to see if you two get the same treatment.’ Right, that
The familiar sickening feeling of being squeezed and then expanding again wasn’t enough to take away the pure dread in the pit of his stomach. They popped back into existence outside of a warehouse. Harry drew his wand as they approached slowly at first, when they started hearing the sounds of spells smacking into the inside of the warehouse, they picked up the pace.
‘Is there a functioning bathroom here?’
‘It’s the old Black house. Come on.’ Harry pulled on Draco’s arm. His legs didn’t seem to be hurt so he could probably walk himself inside. Draco stumbled a little on the steps up to the door, but he made it inside without falling over. Harry was counting that as a victory. He steered Draco into the sitting room and onto a small couch.
