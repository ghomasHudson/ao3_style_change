Daphne was busy tidying up her equipment behind Draco as she continued mumbling. "But you are special. You should be grateful. Mr. Potter never asked me to dress up his other lovers," Daphne's muttering had answered Draco's previous question. “And the most sensational thing is this dress is Mr. Potter told me to order it directly from the designer in Paris. Special order because it was completed in just 1 week, this dress is specially made for you, second to none in this world." Daphne gave a small exclamation, looking dazzled by something in her hand. "You should be grateful that Mr. Potter treats you special."
"We are husband and wife. Sometimes we have to look harmonious so that there is no bad talk," Ares replied, still in his cold tone.
"What are you saying?" Harry asked in disbelief.
His full lips were polished with red lipstick, which didn't make things any better. His long blonde hair, which he pushed to one side of his shoulder, showing Harry the exposed skin of his neck and seemed to tempt Harry to immediately plant a kiss and make a sign of ownership there.
"Touch me, honey," Harry whispered hoarsely.
"Draco. Draco Malfoy."
"We're about to leave right away, but there's a change of plans. We'll continue our journey by horse. We're leaving this ungrateful human kingdom right now." one of them spoke.
Harry smiled. The blonde obviously wanted to challenge him. And Draco's presence in the room caught his attention. He wasn't even interested in his papers anymore. Harry folded his hands on the desk, and he watched Draco, who was acting as if he is reading.
"Of course!" said Cedric excitedly.
Draco.
When Harry was already in the small house, the noise made by the people there greeted him. For some reason, worry began to fill the king.
"I'm just feeling confused, Your Majesty. The night will soon come. Arabelle definitely needs you," Draco replied with a sincere smile, as he did to everyone when he was talking.
Draco sat on the sofa in the television room, hugging his knees. He pulled the blanket half of his body while looking at the empty room. His thoughts began to return to Abaddon, the demon after him. The creature knows where Draco works, and it could also know where Draco lives.
Harry clenched his fists tightly that turquoise veins protruded so majestic over the backs of his hands.
"If I really want to put your idea into action, when and how do I get a temporary mate'?" Harry folded his arms across his chest, one eyebrow raised.
"Who is he?" Draco was amazed to see the painting of a man who was so handsome. The man reminded him of someone he felt had been very close to him. But Draco couldn't remember it.
The sound of hard metal being thrown was so loud. All the guards watching the battle held their breath when they saw Cedric managed to attack his sword right into his opponent's neck.
Ares took a deep breath. He knew his sister. She's good at twisting facts and getting people to take her side. Whatever Ares said, she would definitely crush them.
"Dude, my life is cursed enough right now. What could be worse than this?" The prince said a little sarcastically.
"I can't," Draco denied as he rose from his seat. He was just about to take vast strides out of the library, which was currently only filled by him and Cedric, but the grip on his hand made the young man stop his steps.
Draco sat on the edge of the crystalline lake, busy watching the trail of water beetles pass by. He didn't have much entertainment in Sparta. He was tired of playing dice or listening to musicians strumming the lyre. He even fell drowsy and almost fell asleep because of it.
"Agile movement," Cedric said as he saw Draco had restrained the sword he had aimed at his neck.
"I'll find someone to replace me," Draco spoke loudly.
Draco's doctors and nurses turned their heads in unison and were a little stunned when they realized that at the door to the emergency room stood the figure of an extremely handsome man, wearing a white shirt covered in blood and looking so angry.
Draco was thoughtful in his room, all of Alden's words ringing in his ears over and over again. The story of the beautiful and perfect Seraphina Potter and how much Harry loves her.
"Oh, but if you're serious and want to make him a Titan, I might support him. As long as it is not Aphrodite." Hera talked about the Goddess of Beauty with a disapproving intonation.
"That—" Draco looked away nervously and blushed.
"No need to speak formally to me, just call me Ares. And your name is Troya, right?"
Harry gave Draco a quick glance. Then he stood up from his place and just disappeared without saying a word.
"It's up to you if you want to believe me or not. I don't want anything from you. What I've seen and heard today has made me realize which side will work with me if your husband intervenes to finish this kingdom's coup."
Harry clenched his jaw hard when he saw Draco currently walking towards him with Cedric right beside him. Draco's hand gripping Cedric's hand for some reason made his heart feel like it was being burned by an unquenchable ember.
Cedric rubbed his ear, which burning because of the disgusting sobs that came out of the mouth of his brother's mistress.
"Haven't you ever believed in me, Your Grace?" Draco asked sarcastically but with a gentle face.
Draco lifted his head, his eyes colliding with the night sky filled with stars competing with each other to show off their rays to all the inhabitants of the earth. Until Draco felt his back suddenly warm, a cloak of wolf fur landed on Draco's narrow back.
Draco's heart skipped a beat, afraid of Harry's threat. Will Harry carry out his threat? But seeing those eyes lit with anger, Draco suddenly realized that Harry was not playing games. This man has a demon inside of him, and when it comes out, Harry won't hesitate to be cruel.
With his thoughts running wild, Harry wrapped Draco's scarf, which he had just pulled from the boy's wardrobe, around the boy's slender neck, which was now looking a little pathetic.
Draco approached him. Instantly his body stiffened. The man is Vlad, and the one lying weak in his lap is... Draco.
“You are free to go in and out of this house, but I beg you, don't try to run away from this house. I am evil, but I will take care of you, not so with my enemies."
"Me too. I already marked him so that he can come back to my house after ten days," Harry also refuted, not wanting to lose.
"Do you really want to go to Olympus?" Hector asked.
"I'm sorry..." Cedric whispered, looking down at Draco sadly.
The club owner welcomed him. Of course, considering how much he owes Harry. Hurriedly, the fat man led him to the best VIP seat. "You can choose anyone to accompany you," muttered the owner of the club in a livid tone.
Draco didn't notice. He was walking alone around the palace of Sparta. He walked past several girls who were swarming and gossiping. One of them was his not-so-beautiful half-sister. Now she was giggling and whispering an insult to him. Even though it was faint, Draco still had memories of Troya.
," Draco said while mocking his name. "I have other business, and you should better find another mortal." Draco walked toward the door and down the stairs.
"Did… did Harry order you to tell all this to me?"
In the past, they loved each other. In the past, the world seemed to only belong to Draco and Harry. Harry will always be beside him wherever he was, and vice versa.
"Tell me if I'm prettier," Arabelle pouted, dissatisfied with just a nod and Harry's faint smile.
If Draco asked him for help, would Doctor Jason understand? From what he said earlier, it was clear that Doctor Jason thought Draco was Harry's boyfriend.
With a laugh still escaping from his mouth, Cedric rose from his position. It seemed that the other man wanted to leave Draco's room.
Athena smiled at him and chuckled as if disdainfully. "Later, Ares, later. We will meet again in battle soon. This time I will confirm who was worthy of the title of God of War among us," She disappeared after saying that.
Draco's heart skipped a beat when he heard that very sexy voice. Draco suddenly turned his head and stared in horror at the source of the voice. "Your Majesty?!" Draco half-screamed and tucked the vulgar book in a hasty motion under his pillow.
"What are we going to see here?" Draco asked, confused because Cedric stopped right in front of the entrance to the garden of the royal labyrinth, which was nothing special.
"Your Majesty!" called Draco in a slightly high voice so Harry could hear it, even though it sounded impolite, especially since the man was a king.
Harry's just joking, right? What did he mean by throwing Draco at his bodyguards? Did Harry want to give Draco to get raped by his bodyguards? After all, Draco was a man, and Harry's bodyguards were male too. So it can't be possible...
Draco blinked a few times when he heard Harry's grunt. "So... Your Majesty came here to avoid duty?"
"Yes, I can..." Arabelle replied softly and took Harry's outstretched hand.
Draco took a deep breath as he sat on the toilet, then calmed himself down before entering the classroom. After finishing, he immediately walked out of the bathroom. When Draco came out, Harry was leaning beside the door with his arms crossed over his chest.
Draco never interacted with Alden again after yesterday's cases, and it doesn't seem like the man intends to talk to him either. Besides, Draco's guilt was too big. Because of him, Harry beat Alden. The beating marks are still there from the bruises on Alden's face and a broken nose.
Moreover, the young man's face was beautiful, and his mind and heart were also very beautiful. Perhaps, this was what prompted Draco's parents to charge Harry such a high dowry so that he could marry Draco.
Honestly, Draco was used to being someone Harry loved.
from the gods for this event." Hector reassured his King back.
Draco looked at Harry in confusion. "Why?"
Damn. Doesn't Draco realize that a pair of brothers were currently fighting over him?
"Because Harry Potter, the coldest tycoon here, invites you to stay with him in his house. Despite having many lovers, Potter is known to have a principle of sterilizing his house from the presence of women." Hermione twitched her chin. "And well, who knows if the woman he's carrying isn't a woman," Hermione said teasingly, making Draco blush awkwardly.
"If I wear it, I'll catch a fever. I can't be sick." Draco muttered with his brain already moving to find a solution to the problem he was currently facing. His eyes moved restlessly across the river.
"Okay," Draco said, trying to calm his already pounding heart.
These were arousing thoughts, and he just let out a frustrated whimper.
"You are mine, Draco. Always remember that."
Draco didn't know why, but deep down inside, he just couldn't completely let go of Harry.
Harry began moving in and out at an agonizingly slow pace, so slow that Draco wouldn’t be able to reach orgasm, but the pressure was potent enough to keep him painfully close to the edge.
The boy was nervous. For the first time in his life, he felt his chastity was threatened. One thing Troya had in common with Draco was a man had never touched them. Troya was probably purer than Draco because of his protective father. Draco had kissed or let some of the guys he dated touched him a bit, but it never ends in bed.
Good grief! Even Draco had never seen Harry making out with Arabelle like that.
Harry desperately wanted to explode…inside Draco's body.
»»———————————————««
"You're looking for a human, aren't you? A boy. I saw him earlier," He said with difficulty. The Cyclops was now snoring. Ares and the Satyr's conversation didn't affect him at all.
"Believe me, you have no reason to be afraid of me," Ares smiled.
When Doctor Jason reached the door, Draco called him. "Doctor..."
Draco did it out of curiosity most of the time, with no real interest in doing it. He had high self-esteem and felt righteous to judge if the men weren't worthy enough to touch him. Besides, even though he wasn't a devout person, Draco had sworn to his grandmother to kept his virginity until he married.
Draco never felt jealous or angry when he saw Harry, his legal husband, alone with his mistress, and it made Draco's image as a queen with a heart as big as the ocean be praised constantly.
"You seem to like reading," Harry's voice startled Draco. He turned his head and just realized that Harry was sitting in the corner of the room, at his large desk and studying his company papers. The man was looking at him with his green eyes gleaming sharp.
Draco bit his lip, which he did out of nervousness. That behavior made Ares triggered and turned his face away. The Prince of Sparta before him, dressed in perfume and a gown of limp silk. The curves of his body were not too pronounced but caused curiosity. His white but not pale skin looks glowing.
"What the hell are you doing here?!" Draco shrieked at the man who was staring at him silently.
"Of course, Your Royal Highness." Draco reached out with a slow but steady motion to take the crown prince's hand, but before Draco actually managed to land his hand on the palm, a firm hand suddenly grabbed his hand.
Satisfied with his appearance, Harry turned and shrugged at Alden. "Is he ready?"
"Slow down," Harry whispered softly, pulling the glass away from Draco. "Stubborn brat," He grumbled, then took a sip of the drink in the glass.
"It doesn't matter. What's important now is to return me to London." Draco demanded.
"That's more or less." Ron gave a faint grin.
The man chuckled. "I'm not Potter's friend," he said. "I am your guardian angel," he added.
"His leg was slightly injured, but not badly. He tried to run away from us, but we managed to thwart him."
Ares didn't answer right away. His hand touched his young wife's chin and looked at him intently as if he was observing him. Draco felt uncomfortable staring that close. His mind immediately reminisced a while ago where they kissed for the first time. Draco's cheeks now were turning red without him being able to stop it.
"Are you kidding?" Draco whispered, holding back his laughter. "A person like him will never fall in love,"
"From now on, you have to rethink if you want to challenge me. I'm not a good person, and I don't hesitate to be cruel,” Harry's lips felt close to Draco's, and he was a little out of breath.
"What are you doing?" Harry huffed in annoyance.
"Be careful!" said Harry, surprised.
"Huh? I told you I wanted to stay,"
Compared to discussing with the royal council members who only cared about themselves, obviously, discussing with Draco was more fun.
"It would be more beautiful if we spend it the right way," said Cedric, which managed to make Draco turn his gaze to the man who was currently beaming at him. "Will, Your Majesty, spend his last dance with me?" asked Cedric formally as he held out his hand in front of Draco.
Cedric smiled brightly when he saw Draco walking towards him. Not wanting to waste any more time, Cedric immediately reached out his strong hand to Draco and helped the blonde sit right in front of him.
Draco started not to bother Cedric's impudent behavior. He then frowned faintly. "You mean Arabelle?" he asked without any more rigidity of language.
"What?"
"We don't believe that all of you are the messengers of God Ares," The king responded stubbornly.
"Draco," It was Harry's voice.
Draco snorted sarcastically. Did Harry also order this makeup artist to dress up his lovers?
"What? No. They saved my life earlier when in the palace of Sparta I was almost kidnapped, and they helped me escape," Draco explained.
Purposely, Harry caressed Draco's back where the guests in the ballroom could see. Of course, Draco got little goosebumps from his husband's touch. After all, he had never felt that man stroke his back.
The prince furrowed his brow in confusion. He was sure that the jewelry was deliberately given to him. The tame vulture was indeed someone's pet.
The music from the orchestra playing made Charless and Draco immediately dance in the middle of the dance floor.
"He's awake! That potion sure seems effective!"
Draco nodded his head. He really enjoyed all of this, not only the food, although the food at Harry's house was no less delicious, but being able to eat with a free landscape — not inside the room, and the room that was always locked — was very nice.
Alden interrupted again. "We caught Tom,"
"Why did you change, Cedric?" Draco asked in frustration when he found an unyielding determination on Cedric's features.
Troya befriends Hadreda—the Centaur. Something that surprised him again. Because his lovers who had lived in his palace usually always focused on him alone. They never cared about other residents.
Well, he meant - look how seductive the blond was when those red lips parted and so gently sipped wine from his tall glass.
The sun was very bright, but the thick trees act as a light filter to keep it shaded. Draco could also see some of the large fields where sword practice or duels were held. There were currently dozens of Ares' trained soldiers using it. The sound of swords and spears colliding sounded loud but blended harmoniously with the gurgling of the river water there.
Ginseng, damiana, vanilla, rose petals, and cinnamon. The spice was an Aphrodisiac plant. Eros, the God of Love famous for his arrows, can make anyone fall in love if exposed to it, apparently making his love potion. What he called a love potion was some kind of aphrodisiac. Maybe Eros should add it again with some secret chemical to make it stronger. Draco accidentally learned the truth about God Eros'
Harry was as surprised as Arabelle, but the man managed to control his emotions so well that his face didn't show the slightest look of surprise.
Why did Harry reject Draco's suggestion? Did Harry not want to be with her? Was Harry tired of her? Is she no longer attractive in the eyes of the king?
"You're not mad at me anymore?" Draco whispered.
"Okay, calm down. What's your name? " asked the operator.
Harry turned and looked at Draco. Finally, the man was persuaded to pay attention. At least he was annoyed by Draco's uneasy attitude and decided to send Draco home.
"He's the prince of Sparta," Ares answered dryly.
"If later I get punished, then I hope you get punished too. You don't forget that punishment in this kingdom binds anyone? Be it commoners or nobles." Cedric opposed in an unfriendly tone of voice.
"This is a dream. This is a dream! Hurry up and wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake—" Draco's mouth was clamped by a hand. Draco opened his eyes and saw the man he had seen before or after. He doesn't know. He's so confused.
Draco grimaced inwardly. He had never seen his husband dance with anyone, except with himself and, of course... with Arabelle. Obviously, his husband didn't want to make his very naive mistress feel jealous.
"Yeah, I hope so too." Greyson checked his watch. “Looks like I have to go now. I have an appointment with my parents to have lunch together." He got up from his chair, then straightened the suit he was wearing.
"You were asleep," Ares stroked his head as if he were a child who had just done something stupid. But Draco was confused. How could he fall asleep waiting for Ares to finish talking to Goddess Hera? Was it because there was nothing she could do, and it was pretty late?
Draco sat down. Harry has saved him once again. Why did that man save him? Is it true that he is considered Harry's exceptional whore because Draco served Harry with his body? With a pale face, Draco looked away, feeling disgusted by himself.
Harry gently unbuckled his belt and lowered his pants. "Feel my body that desires you so much,"
Harry smirked. "Oh, don't worry about that."
Draco was still wondering, what exactly is behind the door? But never mind, he will try to open it tomorrow, because now he wants to rest his body.
"Prometheus! Icarus Prometheus!" the man shouted, but Draco didn't turn his head and continued walking down the stairs.
Harry was struck by lightning on the spot. He turned his head very quickly at Ron. "You're out of your mind."
With slow, calculated movements, Alden mixed the plain, white powder into Draco's drink. This medicine will make the long-haired man torment and asking for satisfaction. If nothing satisfied him, the blonde would feel his whole body burning in pain, and Alden was sure Draco would plead or even beg for his master tonight.
Harry looked away. A moment later, he put his hands on Draco's head, right and left. And suddenly, it was as if Draco felt a great pull. His memories come back. Starting from his twentieth birthday, which is today. Then it went much longer, his seventeenth birthday, next his eleventh, fifth birthday, and until the first day, Draco was born.
"Huh?"
There was an amused glow in Harry's eyes. "Yes, take a shower. What do you think I want to do?"
One of Harry's hands reached out carefully to remove the white cloth, slowly but surely turning red because of the wound.
Draco cast a frustrated look at him. He had just opened his mouth and was about to rebuke Cedric's words, but the man had already taken vast strides to leave Draco.
"Why?"
"Today is your birthday?" asked Harry, placing his hands on the table and resting his chin on his palms.
Arabelle seemed so docile to Draco, at the mere mention of her name, the girl pulled her face away from Harry's broad chest. Of course, it made Harry frown, he had been calling the name of his mistress, but his mistress didn't want to answer.
"That's obvious, other than that?"
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
"Oh," Draco lowered his head, disappointed that Ares was cold to him.
Hermione looked at Draco again and smiled. "You are the only 'woman' he has been invited to stay in his house and didn't even go out until now. They all feel jealous because what you are going through is their dream, living with the most wanted bachelor here."
"I don't feel justice from you, Zeus. Are you going to continue to defend him without actually educating him? Do you realize what the Titans and the citizens of Olympus think about your attitude towards Ares?"
"I want to feel you, Elle." He said hoarsely. "Open yourself up to me."
"All the Satyrs who serve Ares are castrated because only then can they work properly." Alastair was always willing to explain if Draco asked.
Draco briefly heard Greyson take a sharp breath before the man speaking again. "So... You two are a thing?"
Draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously. He temporarily concluded that someone was strongly suspected of deliberately harming Troya. Because the temple of Athena was located in a crowded residential area. There were barely any trees and shrubs there. Snakes are cowardly animals. How could a snake roam the temple and bite Troya? Moreover, he said there were six bites.
"I told you I would make you scream my name." Harry panted, laying his head on Draco's shoulder. He began planting light kisses and nips at the skin that had flushed red from their activities, enjoying the afterglow and taking immense pride in what he'd just done.
Can you achieve satisfaction when you are raped? Draco held his burning cheeks with his fingers, feeling embarrassed and disgusted with himself. Maybe it was true that there was hidden inside him a whore who finally came out and took control of his body.
As Draco had already guessed, his husband, who was currently walking beside him, still looked indifferent to Draco's answer. The man was still looking straight ahead expressionlessly. He didn't know what Harry was presently paying attention to.
Harry was not a man who mingled so easily, he was a loner, and his famous disposition made people hesitant to approach him. Ron wasn't close to Harry. They were only talking about business. And when it comes to business, Harry is quite cooperative. Their partnership has resulted in many benefits for their respective companies.
The maid gulped nervously. She hesitated to answer Draco's question. She didn't want to lie to her queen, but on the other hand, she didn't want to make her queen feel sad.
"I'll show you around," Ares shrugged.
Ah... it's Cedric's voice. Draco turned his face so he could see Cedric. The prince was standing not far from him. "Is that wrong, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked, raising his eyebrows.
Draco snorted. "Huh? Are you kidding? How could I love a man half-angel and half-demon like you," Draco said suddenly. And he only realized he was telling Harry his secret that he already knew what kind of creature Harry was.
Don't mind me lmao I just felt like that I need to write this. The main story will be updated soon~
"I'm not the right person to love you." Draco was still trying to convince him.
"Isn't it all right then? I'm not going to touch you any more than this. But I'm not going back to my room tonight. They'll think you're rejecting me. At least act if we sleep together tomorrow."
"Hey Harry, what do you think?" Ron followed Harry from behind. "You want to consider it?"
Draco still stared at the scene before him. Harry lay down proudly, evidently stark naked under his covers, and stared at him with a look of possessiveness. He frantically pulled the blanket over to cover his entire body, but his movement made Harry's blanket sag and almost revealed his manhood.
"Then?"
Was Potter really serious with his words? Draco's body tensed.
“Huh, I wish it was
The Queen's face now turned pale with horror. No human can challenge a god. No matter how immoral they were. "Think again, my King! We both love Troya, but we know Sparta's security is not comparable with our son's. Don't create unnecessary wars. We've had enough of Thebes and their allies."
"Am I banned here?" Harry asked back, raising one eyebrow.
"Oh," Draco answered shortly, which made the wide grin on the crown prince's face disappear.
"You know why," Harry was obviously irritated.
"What's that on your hand? Did something scratch you?" Ares asked to break the silence between them. He still had Draco in his arms.
"What? No. We are the Titan race," Argus replied.
Thousands of years ago, there was a great war between Troy and Sparta. The story was immortalized in
"Looking for a love affair,"
I hope you enjoy this chapter xD
"Why?" Draco looked at Hermione curiously.
"Is that good news?"
"Because I'm embarrassed!" He huffed.
Was it enough?
"Now go," ordered Harry in an unfriendly tone. The four bodyguards bowed as a sign of respect before they left the place.
Narcissa is still busy with the ingredients in front of her. "You don't remember?"
"Toy, you say?" Harry took a step forward, and Draco automatically stepped back. “You wear that dress, or I'll rape you right now on the floor, so you know how I treat my toy!"
Draco turned his blushing face away. The entire palace knew that he and Ares had spent the night together. Alastair even offered him a warm bath, thinking he had a backache. How rude was the God of War when he has sex with his lovers that Alastair kept a stockpile of herbs like that?
"No, Hector! Stop!"
Attica said they weren't always in the same place. They often go on adventures and work for the gods of Olympus. So, it's not strange if they meet a man and get pregnant and give birth. What Lasonas said was just an issue often made fun of by people who didn't know their culture. Attica herself was a follower of Ares and one of his flagship soldiers.
"You speak as if I've never tasted such a rude action in my life."
Once a lowly woman, even though she was allowed to live in the palace, she's still a lowly woman.
When Draco looked at Doctor Jason in confusion, Doctor Jason sighed, "Hmm… He didn't tell you, did he? Don't tell him you found out from me."
Harry's steps stopped. "Before that," he said, "I'd like to ask a question. If I feel I've found the right Omega, how can I ask them out without sounding like a freak—regardless of my position?"
The queen of Sparta hurriedly tugged at her son's shirt. "Watch your words, my son. This is the messenger of Ares that we have met. Ares is the God of Olympus who could not possibly lower his status and set his great feet on human land." His mother whispered angrily.
"That kind of guy you like?" he asked. "He's just an actor," Harry snorted.
Did Draco have to spend more time teaching Arabelle? But, if he had spent more time teaching Arabelle, maybe he wouldn't have any more friends to relax with, and his husband might criticize Draco's policies.
"HARRY!"
All eyes stared at the pair with admiration, all ladies looked at the King's handsomeness, and all gentleman looked at Draco's incredible beauty.
"Hopefully so," Draco said while pulling a gentle smile.
"You can't control me. Supposedly, you can't control me anymore since I left this house," Draco gritted his teeth.
Harry propped his chin on his hands. A frown adorned the man's forehead. He seemed to be thinking carefully about the words that just came out of his wife's mouth.
However, since the crazy words Cedric said to Harry the other night and the defensive lines that came out of Draco's mouth, Harry had started to feel restless.
Draco had been trained to be an agile man by his own father. He easily caught the sword.
"So what if we are both males? Is that a sin? Immortal beings can make anyone their partner, regardless of gender. What became sin is the forbidden relationship between angels and demons. That rule has been expanded extensively between heaven and hell."
For a moment, Draco forgot his frustration at Harry's coercion and lost himself in fascination with the beauty of the dress on his body. Harry watched Draco for a moment in a beautiful dress. Draco looked like a forest goddess descended from heaven, extraordinarily beautiful.
Draco smiled slightly as he watched Arabelle walk in a hurry. It seemed that the young woman couldn't absorb the etiquette lessons from the teacher Draco had handpicked for her.
RAPE at the end of the chapter
Pansy took a deep breath before speaking. "You know how annoyed we are with him, but if that's what you want, Dray..." Pansy trailed and patted Draco lightly on the shoulder.
Draco felt like crying when he heard Harry's warning. This man has absolutely no sense of empathy for his fellow human beings. Silence surrounded the room again. Draco could only bite his inner cheek, so he doesn't cry because he was unwilling to cry and showed his weakness in front of this demon.
"Wait a minute, Hera! I'm not done talking yet. What I mean is, we're going to give Ares a series of tests. All this time, he had been too negligent in his duties as a god. He had to prove himself that he was still functioning well as a war god. If he fails, then we have to revoke his title," Athena explained.
"At that time, we were all desperate. No medicine or antidote could cure you. The Oracle took you unconsciously to the palace, and a week later, he came back with medicine. Only he made me promise." The King of Sparta, despite having a large and stout body looked helpless with grief.
"I want to save you! Do you think I can let you be taken to Mount Olympus to indulge in all the nonsense of marriage to the god Ares? They are all swindlers! The king has been deceived!" Hector argued.
Draco's cheeks flushed red as he read one sentence after another that was so splendidly and beautifully arranged in the book he had just gotten from his maid, Glenice. Draco felt his face heat up, and suddenly, his normally cold room was replaced with stifling heat.
"Don't you want to be with me, Draco? We fit so well in bed, you and me. We can have a mutually beneficial relationship.”
"Don't do this, Prince Cedric," Draco said calmly as he looked straight at Cedric's grey eyes.
Draco slammed the door to find Harry and Icarus wrestling on the floor, locking each other up. Draco approached them and tried to intervene, but it was tough to separate them.
It's been a while since I update this story. I hope you guys still remember the story though XD
A tear rolled down the corner of Draco's eye. He was desperate in his attempt to escape. "Don't do this, please..."
Suddenly a man's loud voice in front of Draco ordered the group to stop. The voice was none other than Harry's.
"We even know that you're planning to avenge your parents' deaths," Alden's face softened as he saw Draco's cheeks turn red, then looked at him with regret. "Your parents' deaths shocked us too, Draco. Believe me, master Harry was surprised by that. He is known to be cruel, but he certainly never intended to hurt a weak person. He's been trying to help your father, for your sake,” Alden emphasized his words. "Everything that happened wasn't my master's fault,"
Draco stood in front of the large mirror watching his reflection look different. He was wearing a maroon suit and brown cravat that matched his skin perfectly. His hands are wearing thin gloves. And his hair, Draco held his blonde hair gently, took a look at his blonde hair which was let down and styled so beautifully. He didn't even notice that his hair had reached his hips.
seeing what his cock does to the boy. He loves the fact that it makes him so pliant, submissive, and absolutely sweet for more.
"Zeus, do you want to leave your throne?"
He bit his lower lip, watched the king remove his wolf fur cloak from his body. From his bed, Draco could easily see how incredibly awesome Harry's back was.
"Good," Harry nodded. "What about Draco? Has he had breakfast?" he asked.
"He was intentionally against you, Zeus. This time we have to punish him," Athena was determined.
And then, the perfect couple drifted away and sank into the hustle and bustle of the party, leaving Draco still standing there, clutching the business card as if it was his ticket to the rescue.
Draco returned Hermione's hand and smiled broadly as well. "Draco," he whispered, introducing himself. "Thank you for greeting me, and I'm not a woman." Draco felt cringe by his last words.
Slowly and cautiously, Draco stepped down the stairs. He had managed to cross the room and hold the large door handle when the cold voice he began to recognize was heard right behind him.
But just like Draco said before, things keep happening like an endless loop of repetition.
The clock showed six in the afternoon. Draco was able to watch one of his favorite movie that came out yesterday before his mother came home. He brought a bowl full of cereal and milk into the tv room when someone's sudden presence startled him. Spontaneously Draco threw his cereal bowl at the man, and all the contents spilled onto the floor.
"They won't suspect you. Abaddon must have killed them too or erase their memories. You're safe here." Harry walked toward his kitchen. "By the way, where is your guardian angel? He doesn't appear when you are in danger. Ah, maybe he is scared of Abaddon."
Draco took a deep breath. If he wasn't a queen of a large kingdom, maybe by now, Draco was living happily with his little family. But unfortunately, fate said otherwise. Ever since Draco was born into this world, the young man had been destined to be the wife of Harry, the most eminent king for the past few decades.
"I know, but it might also be time to test my children. Including Ares and Athena,"
"My... My legs," replied Arabelle in between her sobs.
Oh god! Harry's dirty talk was always successful in sending Draco over the edge.
"Don't put on a face like that. You're an Empress. It's not good if your authority is lost in front of your own people," Cedric was powerful enough to make Draco return the shape of his lips to their original shape.
Stupid Draco! Draco wanted to throw himself into the royal pond full of koi fish. Draco's heart was beating wildly when he saw Harry stride his feet firmly towards the long sofa, which was located not far from where Draco was currently resting.
Harry sighs pleasantly. He could not be angry with his baby for too long. He was eyeing Draco predatorily as the boy arches his back, throwing his head back and lifting his chest to show off those pretty tits.
Draco was very thirsty, and his greatest desire was to drink straight from the glass in one gulp. Draco took a sip of it greedily when he received the glass but stopped at the first gulp due to the choking and sore throat.
Draco blinked his eyes. "I'm looking for Harry," He showed Alden the envelope, "Here... I want to return these files."
"And you, Draco," Harry took off his jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeves. "This is a warning for you. If you fool one of my bodyguards again to escape, you will waste one life because I will kill them right away."
And Draco wanted to open his heart again to Harry. Because he realized, even after three years had passed, he still had many feelings for him.
"No, be careful talking like that, prince of Sparta. On Olympus, that title is very serious. We have twelve major gods and dozens of minor gods. They are our leaders. We are only Titans living in the land of the earthlings in peace." Argus explained.
"I couldn't track you after you left campus today. Where have you been?" asked Icarus.
Draco widened his eyes. Was Harry still taking the agreement of years ago seriously? But the deal involved a lot of money, which Harry gave to his father and then squandered. Even if Draco rejected Harry, then he owed him a considerable debt.
House letter? Saving account? His eyes glanced briefly at the letters. All in his name!
Unbeknownst to him, a pair of emerald eyes were watching him behind a group of shady trees in the corner of the garden, little by little stepping toward the small figure without making a sound, not wanting to surprise the pretty man.
"Honestly, I enjoyed it," Draco said, breaking the silence. Harry turned to him with a confused face. Draco spoke again, "You're annoying, but it's not so bad when you're just sitting around like this,"
Hello, new readers. Welcome to my fic. I'm just an amateur writer, and english is not my native language so there will be so many grammatical mistakes, hope you understand.

All Cedric had to do was wait for that moment to come. And he will be waiting for him because he sincerely loves Draco, who has become the mother of his children.
In a swift movement, Harry was standing. He twirled Draco around and pressed him against the wall. “Ready, darling? I'm gonna fill you one more time.” Harry declared, his hands already spreading apart Draco’s arsecheeks in preparation.
Draco was now able to sit up, and his eyes were busy scanning the room. He was in a sizeable stone-walled room. There were no lights installed, but candles were scattered in several places. Draco recognized the smell. It was beeswax, and the girl used to burn beeswax for aromatherapy. However, it seems that the candles were made manually without being printed, and they were irregular in shape and size.
"Why did you have to do it?"
Pansy and Blaise were busy watching Draco. And this made Draco far from comfortable. Draco finally gave in and stopped ignoring his two best friends. "Okay, what?" he asked, turning to Pansy.
"There are many kinds of mythological beings, and not all of them are immortal. Why do you always call them immortal, huh?" Luna took the seat opposite Draco.
"Same," Harry replied calmly. "I never imagined it either, because I only imagined you with your bewildered expression when I said I like you,"
Draco gasped when he felt his waist being grabbed tightly by a pair of sturdy hands. This was not dancing etiquette. He lifted his head to look at the owner of the impolite burly hand. He was just about to say his disapproving sentence, but when he saw the owner's face of the hand, Draco stopped his intention.
"Finally, we meet. I am Ares, son of Zeus, a god of war," He said after removing his helmet.
love you." Draco said bluntly.
"Yours tastes good." He stared into Draco's still foggy eyes. His tongue moistened his lips. "I wonder if your blood will be this delicious too."
“This is the certificate of ownership of this house. Harry has bought it in your name. And this is the account number Harry opened in your name. All the accessories are in the envelope. You just have to use it.” Seamus placed the files in an open folder on the table and smiled again. "I was only ordered to hand over these files to you. When everything is complete, I will take my leave." The man got up from his seat, leaving Draco, still staring at the papers on the table in shock.
Today was Sunday, supposed to be a nice day of rest for everyone. But Harry's moods were awful that morning and spread all over the house. The atmosphere at home was tense. All the servants were talking in terrified whispers, talking about their master, who had been angry all day.
Draco closed his eyes in frustration. Harry's house was prominent in an elite suburban area from the information he got. The house was fenced with a high fence around it, and Harry's bodyguards guarded every entry. No one could enter this area of the house without the man's knowledge. Likewise, no one can get out of this house without Harry's permission.
Suddenly a voice interrupted. Draco and Harry spontaneously broke their kiss and stared at the person who had caught them. Or rather, the ghost who managed to catch them.
was well known at that time. Perhaps your father thinks he can use you to win over master Harry."
Over there, on one side of the wall was full of pasted photos. And those are not ordinary photos. They are pictures of Harry doing his activities, some of which are Harry, who is with Draco. And seeing Harry's expression over there, it seems that the photos were taken with a hidden camera, without the person's permission in the photo.
Alden glanced at the painting on the wall. Draco thought he saw a glimmer of sadness there, although he wasn't sure because when he looked at Alden again, the man had a straight expression back.
Instead of glaring at Harry's mistress with eyes full of anger, Draco laughed lightly. How cute was Harry's mistress. Anyone would fall in love easily when dealing with such a cute girl.
"Why are you whispering?" asked Harry.
Draco took a shaky breath as he moved to collect the embroidery threads that lay on the ivory-white stone table.
Most aliens are described as evil and want to rule the earth, but many are told to be friends and become heroes. Like Superman and Thor.
Draco was stunned and blinked when he realized that his eyes were fixated on the beauty of Harry's muscular and tough body. Slender but manly, and all so in proportion to its place as if God created this man with a smile.
"So I came alone?"
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
The blond himself was completely spent and couldn't have gotten up if he'd tried. His muscles were sore and tired, his abdomen tense after all the time Harry had forced orgasm from him. He felt disgustingly dirty, having been unable to get up and shower after their…activities. He was covered with sweat and semen, both his and Harry's.
"As Your Majesty can see, I'm alone here,"
"I just put a spell on it like the gates of hell," the man said, overly relaxed.
Ah, thinking about Arabelle made Harry want to leave this room and quickly go straight to his mistress. But before that, Harry had to confirm one thing.
"Beautiful," Harry muttered with full awareness.
Draco whines as Harry's lips close around his left nipple, sucking it hard and teasing it with his teeth.
With a sudden gesture, Harry pulled his body away from Draco and stared at him tensely. “Tomorrow, Daphne will help pack your clothes, and Alden will drive you home.”
Icarus nodded while biting his lower lip. Draco's ear began to hiss again, and now he knew where the sound had come from. It must be the demon Icarus was referring to, but Draco would make sure the demons couldn't touch him. Maybe Draco should find out about how to get rid of demons.
"Maybe you want to know about me, and maybe I should ask you a few questions too?" Draco said it while looking the other way. He hated himself and his own thoughts right now. Why did the clothes of the ancient Greeks have to be so revealing?
"Your Majesty, there is one thing that has been bothering me since Your Majesty's entourage came to this kingdom." The series of sentences that Natalie had just said to Draco managed to gain his attention. "This may sound a little personal, but honestly... I'm curious."
"Where do you think you are going?"
Draco brought his nose closer to the pillow next to him asleep a while ago and smelled the unique aroma of men's hair gel. Draco jumped and ran toward the door. He opened it a little and peeked. A shirtless man drinking a can of soda. His eyes then settled on Draco, and Draco quickly slammed the door shut.
Draco put on a dazzling smile when he saw one of his guests greeting him while bowing respectfully in front of him. "Thank you, Duke Richmond. Hope you can enjoy this party until the end," Draco said, which made Duke Richmond, Charles Richmond, straighten up.
But for some reason, seeing Cedric moving leisurely while displaying a crooked smile, annoyance filled Draco.
Draco clenched his jaw and sharpened his gaze when he finally got up the courage to look at Cedric's face. He didn't want to appear weak in front of anyone.
He kissed and sucked them with a masterful touch. Draco groaned loudly. His back arched feeling the sensation of the tongue and lips and the warm breath of the man down there. Likewise with the fingers that helped tease him out of his hole.
"Thank you, Lady, you look beautiful today. His Majesty must admire your beauty." Draco said, which managed to make the concubine's cheeks previously painted with fiery red, blush even redder because of Draco's words.
Draco shook his head and turned his face away from Harry.
"I'm getting out of here,"
Draco didn't want that to happen.
"If Your Royal Highness is planning a rebellion, then the blood that will spill on this land shouldn't be a problem for Your Royal Highness, but if Your Royal Highness doesn't want to let those blood pollute this land, then stop your plan."
Cedric's heart was thumping crazy. He felt like a teenager who just got his monkey love. This time, the happiness that filled Cedric was many times more pleasant than the satisfaction he got when he beheaded his enemies on the battlefield.
"Oh, I see now!" Ares slightly exclaimed.
Harry's lips still had a smile on them, but not his eyes. Those eyes glowed with cold, sharp glint. “You can't go home. Now, this is your home. Together with me."
He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Harry and Arabelle seem to be having fun with their backs to Draco. This way, Draco could leave without having to be afraid that Harry would catch him again.
"Shall we begin, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked earnestly.
Frantically Draco began to struggle and kick, moving as best he could to escape. But it's useless, Harry's ties to his hands are very strong, and in such a bound state, Draco is entirely helpless.
A flash of memories of hot sex flashed through Draco's memory, vague and unclear. But he can't remember everything. Why can't he remember everything? Draco remembered the juice Alden had given him last night, and he grew disgusted when he realized something was mixed in his drink.
"Tell, Glenice. Did you know you've made me curious?" demanded Draco.
Ron looked straight at Harry. "He asked for help from my wife to be saved so that he can get out of your house."
"Yes, accident, the police said that your car was sabotaged and the brakes failed. Your car rolled over and hit your head. Luckily we were able to save you."
"Not even a little bit."
All the men on Olympus who passed her couldn't blink or avert their eyes. Ares was one of the lucky gods to be her main lover. Aphrodite was willing to bear his child and, together with Ares, had committed dozens of offenses. They do not want to stop having an affair even though they were often blasphemed and punished for it.
"It's useless. Why are we trying to look good in front of people who don't like us? I never thought about it," Ares seemed confused.
"Do you think he's ready for me?" Harry put on his black silk robe and sat on the sofa in his room. A full meal was available to him at the table. Calmly, the man took a sip of his wine, then looked at Alden, his personal bodyguard and assistant standing in front of him with his trademark expressionless face.
Thank you so much for the kudos and comments <3
Draco flinched when he heard Harry's words. Did his husband worry about him? Yes, Harry might have been worried. After all, Draco was a queen of a big kingdom. If a queen was sick, of course, the kingdom can't function properly.
"B-But I'm a man…" Draco stuttered in panic.
"The king insists on making sure you bring armed guards if you wish to leave the palace, Your Majesty." The servant girl told.
"Where have you been?! Why didn't anyone tell me that Draco had a fever?!" He shouted angrily. "And you, Alden! I warned you to monitor him. Why did you let him walk around the garden when he was sick?!” Harry growled.
"As I said, Mr. Potter, Draco's condition is still unstable, sometimes he looks fine, but sometimes the slightest shaking can make him hurt. I recommend that you do not take him home yet, or his recovery will be hampered."
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
Ares took the initiative to embrace and then carry him. Draco struggled for a moment and felt awkward, but Ares didn't care. His high curiosity had made him neglect to be polite. The Prince of Sparta asks about him, so Ares introduced himself.
"Punish him?" Zeus sounded doubtful. "What punishment should I give him?" He asked.
"N-No, Your Majesty."
"What happened to you? I won't scold you..." Draco said softly.
When Harry let go of his lips, Draco's breath coming erratically, this kiss was the most intense kiss Draco had ever felt.
He hadn't had time to collect all the threads yet, but a call from his personal maid stopped Draco's actions for a split second. Draco smiled sweetly, but he didn't stop his actions. He collected the various colored embroidery threads and put them in the basket one of the maids had prepared.
Strengthening himself, Harry finally came out of the room and went over to Ron's. The Alpha nodded briefly at the handful of soldiers and omegas, who paid little respects to him as he passed. His footsteps were constant and filled the silence in the corridor leading to the main door.
In fact, Harry had decided to laugh at Draco in secret, pretending to drink the poisoned drink. But those lush lips and Draco's incredibly sexy appearance brought out a demonic side in him, a thirsty devil side. Maybe it's time this pretty boy received a lesson for his recklessness.
"You can laugh all you want." Harry took another deep breath. "I'm not going to force it because it's hard to say it. Do you want, uh, to date me? Not just a date, but a date as, you know, a lover," Harry could feel his neck turning red now.
"M-My clothes?!" Draco demanded, starting to panic.
"The bird is dead. Why do you keep it?" Harry asked, raising one of his eyebrows high.
Cedric smiled faintly as his thumb moved to Draco's forehead and gently stroked it so that the traces of the wrinkles disappeared. "My offer will continue to apply. Until whenever I am ready to be your love affair."
"I don't know. We've tried to buy a horse and have someone put it at the foot of Mount Olympus. We've also asked if any mercenaries would help me escape, but no one is willing." The prince complained.
"Hades? Ares also discussed it, but I don't understand,"
"Then why did you save him?"
Harry only cleared his throat and nodded faintly in response. After that, Harry stared right at the ballroom door. He was waiting for the girl who had promised to come and show herself to Harry, even if only from a distance.
The strategy might work. Draco felt at ease from their first meeting. He who was afraid and worried now even began to underestimate the ability of the God of War. They were husband and wife, and sleeping together was almost always the main focus of the bride and groom.
It took Draco a moment to understand the words. Until then, he realized the meaning of Harry's words, his slight awareness screaming a warning of danger. His body immediately moved, desperately trying to get away from the danger.
It felt like she wanted to cry right now. In fact, she had hoped that the man would meet her and take her out of this room filled with nobles. Unintentionally, her glazed dark brown eyes collided with the Empress' silver eyes.
At that time, the King agreed and did not think long. He and the rest of the palace were sure that Troya would not survive. Even though everyone said a poisonous snake bit him—no antidote could cure him. The King took the risk and gave the medicine to his son.
Draco laughed and snorted in response.
The voice sounded hoarse and sorrowful in Draco's ears. And it came from a man who was holding a body covered in blood.
Draco gasped, his mouth wide open. "Four days?!" he asked in surprise. "H-How?!" he squawked, then looking at his changed clothes. "What did you do to me?!"
Draco never asked his mother to make anything. Because whatever Narcissa cooks, Draco will definitely eat it. "Whatever mom cooks, I'll finish it."
Now Draco understands. They are the children of the devil. If one day their creator wakes up, then they will take side with him. "You look like an angel to me," Draco teased.
The man is wearing medieval clothes. His eyes are dark and sharp, shaded by thick eyebrows and curly lashes. Pointed nose. His jaw is firm with thin lips that seem cynical but curvy sensuously.
"Now, close your eyes and open your mouth," Ares ordered.
»»-———— ♡♡♡ ————-««
"Geez, how much work did you do that you forgot your own birthday?" Narcissa shook her head in disbelief.
"No, I don't want to keep my new wife waiting too long," Ares said half-jokingly, but Aphrodite didn't smile at all. She approached and cupped the jaw of the handsome god seriously.
He continued to gently stroke the top of the horse's head until his two senses of hearing caught the footsteps of someone who seemed to be approaching him. As best he could, Draco kept himself calm and acted as if he didn't know the sound of the footsteps.
"Yes, if we repel the pest, we can indeed keep it from disturbing our property for a while. But does Lady know? There is a possibility that the pest will be stronger and can predict what we will do. That sounds very dangerous. So, rather than let it get stronger, we'd better let it keep having fun with its current position." Draco explained with a gentle smile on his face.
"What?" she asked.
He understood that Draco had felt immense pain because of someone. And even now, he's trying to heal himself.
naive.
Harry shook his head. "Of course not,"
Without realizing it, tears had poured out and flooded Draco's lids. He sobbed, and his mother turned her head, staring at him in confusion. "Are you crying?" she asked.
The woman chuckled.
"I think you'd better go with someone from the packhouse instead."
"Move faster, Troya!" Hector shouted angrily.
"You need to adapt to living here. Otherwise, it would be a bit of a hassle if we were in the same room. Aphrodite could visit at any time and—" Ares stopped talking. "About Aphrodite, she is—" Ares wanted to explain.
The smile on Doctor Jason's face never faded until Draco realized the two men in front of him were so contrasting, one was so cold with the dark and gloomy tones that surrounded him, and the other looked so bright, full of smiles as if he were carrying the sun on his head.
The man came down the stairs and walked over to Draco. "Harry Potter," he whispered suddenly in Draco's ear.
When Draco reached the point of losing consciousness, there was another, no less violent splash in the pool. Within seconds, a strong arm grabbed him, lifted his body, and then brought him to the surface. Draco's limp body was lying on the floor at the edge of the pool, and then he felt his stomach squeezed expertly until the swallowed water flowed out.
"Doctor!" Harry called out half screaming. And Doctor Jason, who happened to be nearby, walked in worriedly.
"It's none of your business to whom I will be attracted to!" Draco's voice rose.
"All right," Draco took a deep breath and let Alden open the door for him. Draco immediately faced Harry, who stood so handsome in the middle of the room.
"He is the most beautiful man in Greece!" Aphrodite exclaimed in annoyance.
"Your Majesty, papyrus was limited than gold in Sparta. It's not easy to get. I don't know if the librarians would still give it to you," the servant shook his head.
"I've decided on your future," Harry's eyes were dark like a green lake in the dark of the night.
"If it's just out of curiosity, don't the gods usually kidnap humans they want?" Draco regretted it after saying that. He used to argue and forgot that the man he was currently with was a god.
Without realizing it, Draco rolled his eyes. Maybe the people were too dazzled by Harry's good looks, so they're all blind with all his real nature.
Doctor Jason, who was on duty, was quite aware of Harry's reputation for being so cruel and hot-tempered. After all, Harry was the owner of this hospital.
When he reached the gate, Draco took a deep breath to grab the iron and climb over it. The burning scent started to be emitted when he had just raised one leg. Though, Draco was still able to hold on to it and continued climbing. When his two feet had climbed onto the gate, his body seemed to resist, and his body was thrown back away.
The man grinned. A grin that made Draco feel uncomfortable. "You're still in London, Seraphim."
When he had enough, Draco pulled his legs back over the edge. The young man took the time to turn around and make sure that Harry was no longer there. After making sure Harry left this place, Draco immediately took off the dress attached to his body.
A row of numbers, with lipstick kiss marks on it.
"Because they are all afraid of dealing with God Ares."
Greyson walked out of the room and was greeted directly by Alden, who had just arrived. Alden bowed slightly to greet Greyson and responded with a nod from the other man. He watched Greyson's departure before entering his master's study room.
Their lovemaking is a very passionate and exquisite pleasure. Draco gripped Harry's muscular shoulders, forgetting the pain in his head, too immersed in the pleasure that was wracking his body. Harry tried to move as smoothly as possible, but his desire overpowered his senses. He moved furiously, taking Draco with him. And finally, when the peak came, their bodies were so tightly joined, in the rolling waves of satisfaction that smashed against their bodies.
"This bird isn't dead, Your Majesty. It's still breathing," said Draco disapprovingly, then gently stroked the little bird's head with his thumb.
"Mr. Draco, your breakfast..."
"Okay," Draco replied nervously.
Draco closed his eyes and tried to enter the dream world. Harry remained in the room and saw Draco seemed fast asleep on the big bed. The young man’s breath seemed to be regular, made Harry dare to get up from his seat.
They had tried every position imaginable, and even some Draco had never dreamed of attempting. Throughout the night, Harry had forced him to plead, to shout his name over and over again until his voice had gone hoarse. He'd made Draco say and do things he never imagined doing, things that would surely leave him sore and ashamed of himself for days to come. In the end, Draco had to beg Harry to stop and give him a break.
The scream took Draco by surprise and woke him from his sleepiness. When he realized, he felt himself in Harry's arms, held him so tight till he felt hurt. Harry's whole body was wrapped around him as if to protect him.
For heaven's sake! Bless his soul! Draco was still fully dressed, and what makes everything worse, Draco's outfit was a thin white t-shirt and shorts that showed off his smooth thighs. And when the clothes get soaked, it makes Draco's body so sexy, reflected illegally behind the white clothes that make him look mysterious.
Draco wants people to respect his privacy. Therefore, Draco limits the number of people he interacts with as much as possible.
"Mr. Draco?" Alden walked in and raised an eyebrow to see Draco pacing anxiously around his room.
"Wait a minute," Hermione took out a little gold card from her bag, "This is my card." She held it in Draco's finger. "Call me whenever you want. I thought we could be friends."
"I told you, you can only come out if you love me." The man went back into the room.
From the information Draco had received, Harry's father and mother were of French descent. Perhaps this is why Harry speaks fluent French, even though that is none of his business. Draco quickly took his mind off Harry.
"N-No... It's not like that... His majesty didn't hurt me... In fact, it feels amazing," Arabelle stuttered because she felt so embarrassed.
Why did that man save him? It was a question he couldn't answer. Over the years, Draco cultivates hatred in his heart, cultivating a deep sense of revenge, with the knowledge that the evil Potter has destroyed his family. Yes, Harry is evil. But apart from locking Draco up, he treats Draco well.
Daphne was there, flaunting Draco's newly ordered clothes, while the blonde just sat over there, staring bored at the expensive clothes. Daphne immediately stopped her activities and asked permission to leave as soon as Harry entered with a grumpy face.
Until then, Harry Potter came into their life. Harry Potter was attracted by Lucius's rapid development and was thinking of starting a partnership. At first, Lucius was not interested. He was pretty satisfied with the business he was running himself. But Harry did not give up. In various ways, he tried to approach Draco's father. And somehow, Lucius finally surrendered to the power of Harry Potter into the power of darkness, which, when gripped, would not be rereleased.
"You took so long," he said and followed Draco from behind.
"How about it, Draco? Me or you're dismissed to my bodyguards?"
"Too bad... I shouldn't have gone to war at that time, and if I didn't, I might have called off your wedding and taken Harry's place. If that happened, maybe by now, we'd have cute, beautiful children. And handsome." said Cedric with a smile as a vision of the beautiful future between him and Draco flashed through his head.
"Wow, unfortunately, I've forgotten my idea just now."
"Morning, everyone." Professor Trelawney placed her sketchbook on the table. She then stood in the middle. "A few days ago, I read a book. In that book, it tells about an angel who loves a demon. The question is, can the demon’s tricks attract angels?"
"What? Why should you be ashamed of being the wife of a War God?"
"I didn't receive the message," Ron muttered sharply, causing the receptionist to look down nervously, which made Draco feel sorry for her, but then Ron shrugged his shoulders, "Okay then, I'll go back to the office and make up for my wasted time here," Ron turned to Draco. "If I'm wasting my time, I'll be late for home."
Harry quickly laid Draco on the bed, stepped out of the white room, slammed the door, and shouted, "Alden!"
"Why? Don't you know that rumors about you have also been heard as far as Olympus? Even we gods want to know what the prince of Sparta looks like. Unfortunately, the king of Sparta didn't let you out of Sparta and kept you only around the palace area."
Draco shook his head. "I'm here." His voice sounded flat, and then he began to sob. "Mr. Flitwick is dead, and Abaddon is looking for me now." Draco begins explaining today's events to Icarus.
"You... Aren't you from Prince Cedric's palace?" asked Harry, slightly surprised when he saw the four guards with yellow stripes on their chests.
Unknowingly, Cedric's strong hand moved to grip Draco's freed hand tightly. Draco was surprised, but he let Cedric take his hand. That guy might have been afraid Draco would stumble again.
The image of his mother and father's cheerful faces, then replaced by depressing faces, flashed through Draco's mind. It made Draco even sadder. If only he weren't helpless like this, he would have avenged his parents on Harry by making him feel the pain his mother and father used to feel in the past.
Harry Potter, his arch-enemy. The man had destroyed his business with his expansion. And not only that, Tom was wracked with feelings of jealousy and intense hatred for Harry. Somehow Harry was created so perfect, from a physical point of view. Everyone scrambled to kneel at his feet, worshiping Harry like a god.
All of this is because Draco is a descendant of Demigod. His mother, Narcissa, is a human, while his father is a god. Yet, Draco did not know who his birth father was. What kind of god would leave his wife when she was pregnant? At first, Draco didn't believe his mother because Narcissa didn't want to say who his father was. But all of that explained how Draco could see these immortal creatures.
"You guys are slow. I could get hurt right now." Draco didn't mean it. He could have screamed for help from the start. But somehow, he was also interested in what the vulture would do. It didn't look like it meant to hurt him.
Enemy to lover, huh? Interesting.
"That really describes you," Harry stated, making the blond next to him chuckle.
"You changed your mind?" Harry was a little flabbergasted, but he quickly controlled himself. Inevitably, Harry was relieved to learn of the fact that Draco had changed his mind and was willing to be his Mate for a while.
"His name is Harry Potter. I kissed him, and it made me saw that scene." Draco's trying to explain.
"What did you just say, Dray?" asked Narcissa.
Demigods were not common in Greece. No one can really confirm it. They could not go to Olympus and force the gods to confess that they had impregnated their daughter. Draco could see that the rest of the palace was now chattering between fear and amazement at the confession. Not one but five people. One of them claimed to be a demigod, then what about the others?
"Prince Troya could have recovered by coincidence!"
Harry's fingers touched Draco's tight hole and fondled it with incredible skill until Draco's thighs were open, hot, wet, and ready for him. Harry was already on top of him and squashed him. Draco can feel how passionate Harry's cock touching him.
"Yeah, we can relax a bit because there's still a few more hours before we get to Olympus. So Attica, is that story true? Said some Amazonian warriors are going to visit the Titan community to find a mate?" Lasonas smirked.
Whore?
Draco heard a noise from the kitchen. He knows that his mother must be making breakfast because his mother always gets up first.
Draco understood the man was speaking informally to him because, actually, Cedric and Draco had known each other for a long time, even long before Draco was betrothed to Harry. He and Cedric got to know each other at their debutante party. They were the same age, and their similar interests made the two children quickly close and formed friendships.
"Wow, thank you very much, Your Majesty. Now I'm even more excited to embroider." Arabelle smiled widely and showed a row of her white teeth.
Alden gulped roughly. "I want to release him. I'm afraid he will bring us trouble."
"I’m sorr—"
"Damn ants! What a terrifying forest! The gods living here must be insane! Why don't they just live on a tropical island anyway? Why the mountains? It's barren and cold here. Good grief! I need my mosquito repellent! I could catch malaria here!"
Bound and helpless, Draco watched as Harry took off his shirt and half crushed him. His mouth was so close to Draco's that their breaths collided. Harry lowered his head, kissed the side of the blonde's neck, made Draco arching his back, and try to struggle again.
The car is still driving fast from a distance. Draco then roared. "Hey, are you crazy?!" he shouted from across the street.
Draco just kept silent; again, their conversation led to that. He wasn't stupid. He knew that Cedric had liked him for a long time, but he closed his eyes to that fact. After all, Draco wouldn't let his family down just for his love. His family wanted him to be
"He's named Cyllenius. The man isn't old enough to be an Oracle. Why are you interested in the Oracle?" The female Oracle asked further.
Harry nodded. "Glad to hear that,"
"Looks like you turned into a quiet person. You don't want to know why you got dressed?" Daphne asked after she finished putting the golden eyeshadow on Draco's lids.
"My son, are you awake? How's your head?" The man in the armor he'd last seen asked worriedly. Draco didn't answer right away. It might be better if he just followed their scenario. Draco guessed that the dashing man was playing his father. Beside him was a beautiful woman who seemed to play his mother.
The Satyrs seemed busy joking around. The Nymphs didn't make a sound, though, but they helped brighten up the room with their beautiful look. The Titans, Demigods, and Centaurs chattered loudly while drinking wine. But there were some special tables, which the most important people on Olympus occupied. Like Aphrodite accompanied by her son Eros. As well as several other gods who were also sons of Ares, they are Phobos and Deimos. There was also Dionysius who came alone. Draco saw him place a jar of wine by the pile of fresh fruit laid out on the plate.
When Draco realized what Harry meant, it was too late. The man gripped both of his arms with one hand. Draco's strength was nothing compared to the strength of Harry's hefty body above him. Quickly the man tied his wrists with a dead tie, which was very neat, then tied them to the bed's head.
It was a doll similar to the one Harry had given him the first time they were together.
Draco is standing in front of one of the musical instrument shops. Then he entered and was greeted by the shop owner.
Some of Harry's bodyguards ran towards him with panicked faces and short of breath. "Mr. Potter, Draco is running away from the hospital!!"
"Later, it's about your 23rd birthday."
Draco has found the exit. He was right in front of the gate even now. But just as he tried to get out, the scent of burning iron transmitted from the gate. Draco saw the iron gate emitting smoke as he tried to grab hold of it. Draco was surprised and immediately pulled his hand away from the iron.
This was where Draco and Harry were. In a small waterfall that looks very clear. Draco was amazed at the beauty of nature that didn't seem to have been damaged by humans, but the admiration disappeared as soon as Draco remembered his purpose here.
Cedric raised an eyebrow for a moment to confirm Draco's answer before the man finally sighed and smiled. "Love is like that. Love will drive you a little crazy, so you have to go through a journey that you have never gone through in your life. But, that journey will lead you to believe that love is the need of all human beings."
Draco jumped in shock, listening to the hissing sound, he turned his back and faced Doctor Jason, who was standing still in the shadows. The man smiled, as usual, but his current smile was not a smile as bright as the sun, but a grin of terrifying evil.
The sound of the blade scraping against the rough cement was as different as the sound of a beautiful melody in Draco's ears. The sound seemed to be about to awaken another side of Draco, the side he had been overcoming for so long as he was made queen of this kingdom.
"What? Me?" Draco confirmed.
Harry was quick to stop him, his grip strong on Draco's little cock. "Hold on, baby, go slow. I want you to go slow."
Harry stood up and paced the room back and forth, then stopped, and poured himself a glass of pure vodka. He took a sip, and the white liquid felt burning in his throat. His body was so tense, considering it's been a long time since he had been holding back, he could take away his craving for women who worshiped him and would have been obedient to do anything for him.
Draco gasped, feeling Harry's warm breath against his cock. Instantly he straightened up to sit but was caught by the bonds on his wrists. "Don't!!" he shouted frantically, trying to squeeze his legs together, preventing Harry's lips from moving further.
"Lawyer? What for? I'm not involved in any legal matters," Draco was still peeking through the door, not wanting to open it. He looked at Seamus suspiciously.
Draco placed his hands on Harry's back, feeling the other's muscles tense under his fingers with every one of his thrusts. He sensed the tension in Harry's body as he approached climax, his breathing becoming irregular and his limbs starting to tremble as the first wave of pleasure washed over him.
Draco took a step back, aware of the intensity of the anger in Harry's voice. This one-man probably suffers from post power syndrome and can easily get angry with him if he doesn't follow his will, Draco thought to himself.
"Your Majesty..." Draco called carefully.
"Yes, I'm choosing a horse. I plan to ride a horse for this trip," Draco replied kindly.
Arabelle's spoiled seduction that sounded so cute in Harry's ears made him couldn't help but laugh out loud.
However, the other side of Harry, who was filled with prestige, argued disagreed. He is the Alpha of the big pack that everyone knows. Where would he put his face if someone noticed his absence and questioned the reason behind it? Seriously.
"I don't want to accept it. I don't want to be indebted to him."
"You, I choose you."
But, if he thought about Draco... Ah, his wife’s really beautiful.
Draco tilted his head and then took a sip of water. He shook his head. "What?"
He listened intently to all the events that put Troya in this situation.
"How are you feeling? Is it warm?" Harry asked. He rose from his crouched position.
Ares restrained himself from overreacting other than smiling.
"Thank you for raising my mood again, Your Majesty." Cedric teased with his trademark grinning smile.
"That Draco?" there was a question in Ron's voice.
The King was even prepared to keep his son from marriage and let him devote his entire life to serving the temple of Athena. Faced with a fate like this, the King regretted the proposal after proposal for Troya by princesses around Greece—including princes and kings, which he had always refused. Now his son will be married to the God of Olympus with the worst reputation. Troya will be brought to a different realm, and his father may not see him again.
The girl with red hair glanced at her friends. "The man you were with, was he your friend?" the girl asked.
Harry hummed. "Hopefully, he will be found soon,"
Draco suddenly didn't know what to do. He should have left immediately, but finding Harry just standing still, made him want to stay quiet too.
Sighing for the millionth time, Harry walked in first. The decision was unanimous. "Let's just go back to the packhouse."
Draco lay down with Harry lying on his side facing him, the man kissing his forehead, temples, the tip of his nose, cheeks with soft little kisses, then Harry's lips stopped on Draco's lips, tasting them a little at each end, blowing off the wet warmth. Makes Draco open his lips with longing.
Without saying anything, Harry stepped toward Draco. Again, the man swallowed hard when he saw Draco's smooth back. Dirty thoughts began to fill Harry's head.
"Oh, baby…" Harry tucked Draco's blonde strands behind his ear, staring at the beautiful boy completely. "Should I remind you like this next time, hm? Do I need to fuck you in front of Greyson to show him that you are mine?"
Draco left Harry and Icarus, letting them continue their bickering because he was not interested in their conversation while his stomach was starving. Draco brought his own lunch that his mother had prepared and looked for a seat with a table near the front garden.
He sat on a long bench covered with goose-down cushions in a patterned cloth. It was night. He lit a candle in his room. Other than that, the sky was clear enough that Draco could clearly see his beautiful physique. Ares was too perfect. He must have used thousands of years of his age to take care of his appearance.
Harry's eyes are still reluctant to look at Draco. Why?
And... perhaps, only Glenice was the only outsider who knew that her queen was still a virgin until now.
Draco's silly actions could not escape Harry's eyes.
Draco thought to himself.
"Yes, Ares will spoil you. He's always been like that with his human lovers," Argus recounted.
Humans since prehistoric times have made stars as directions and even worshiped them. The sailors saw the stars to return to the mainland. Slowly they saw patterns and formulated constellations and created astrology. The stars became very important in human civilization.
"Your Majesty!" His little maid rushed over to him.
"Found out about what?"
Harry snickered. “Yeah. I'm in a good mood today. You too, Rouvas. You look happy.”
"You better get some rest. We've prepared a room for you," Ares told him.
Draco's face turned pale and looked at Harry sharply. "What the hell. Why are you take a shower here? Y-You have your own bathroom in your room. T-This is.."
A movement in the corner of the room made him turn his head. Alden stood there, the marks of Harry's beatings still bruising here and there, but the man seemed to have been treated.
For the first time in his life, Draco was jealous of Arabelle.
"Goddess Hera," Ares mumbled when he saw his mother.
, he thought to himself. All the people in this world were cheap and sycophants.
Ares didn't answer right away. He got up from his bed and immediately walked away while fixing his clothes. "You know, I don't think you like sleeping in the same bed as me. I won't do it again then." He said curtly as he walked out of the room.
breathe.
Hector was silent. He didn't dare to refute all of that clearly because there was a speck of faith in him who was also a worshiper of Ares—if that could be true. However, Troya who should be dead, can now live and walk again because of taking medicine given by the God Ares. The entire palace believed that it was a divine miracle.
"What about them?"
The blond smiled, and just as his lips were about to open to say a word, a woman in a caramel dress came up to them and whispered something in the blond's ear.
Draco thought furiously.
"God, this is heaven." Harry breathes out, panting harshly. "After this, I will teach you how to satisfy me," The words echoed through the room, like a promise from the darkness. Draco had utterly lost consciousness, his body writhing with a tingling pleasure as the pain finally disappeared. It was replaced by the hot pleasure that gave severe tingling throughout his body.
"Wait a minute!"
As time goes by?
"This can go on as long as you wish to have fun, my lord."
"Did I make you wait?" He asked Ares, able to see that he was carrying a bundle of cloth in his hand.
"See! It's all just rumors! Prince Troya isn't dead! Goddess Athena is protecting him!" Such exclamations were boisterous as soon as Draco started stepping on the shrine grounds.
Drinking tea with the royal consort of Delion was Draco's schedule on this cloudy morning. After making sure he was dressed modestly, appropriately, and elegantly, Draco, accompanied by his maid, Glenice, then stepped into the central royal garden.
Draco was really mad at Harry. Harry was a complete mix of everything Draco hated, insolent, disrespectful, and obnoxious. Maybe that's why God created him with extraordinary physical perfection, to compensate for his vices.
"You really dare to challenge Mr. Potter like that," Daphne muttered half grumpily. From earlier, this delicate woman had been busy grumbling because she had to start over to dress Draco.
Draco blinked a few times, and he quickly released his wrist from Harry's grasp.
"Why are you so selfish? You only think of me as a substitute for Elle!" Draco also didn't understand why he was so unstable today.
Quickly, without daring to look in the direction of Harry's house, Draco entered the black car. Alden closed the passenger door and sat in the driver's seat with another bodyguard. Leisurely, the car slid through the large garden in Harry's yard and through the gate.
"Icarus? An angel who died from flying too close to the sun?" Draco tried to bring it up with the mythological history he knew.
"You're right, and I envy you. You're lucky that you were born so ugly that even a Satyr wouldn't want to marry you," Draco said as though concerned.
Alden nodded his head and pondered. Harry also seemed busy with his own thoughts. "Why don't you just tell him?" muttered Alden.
"Again, you're taking this all too seriously. I'm free to do whatever I want, Hera." Ares confirmed.
Draco looked at Harry again and felt a little uncomfortable because seeing Harry was so calm. Harry was even scary without the slightest bit of emotion. Draco didn't like that. He preferred an explosive and angry Harry over this kind of Harry. With Harry's rage blasting, Draco could fight back with his emotions, but with Harry being so cold, all Draco could do was shrink back in fear.
"I know you don't believe it, but we have proof of the offer, which I will show you later. Now I'll continue my story." Alden cleared his throat, seeming very understanding of the various emotions swirling one after another on Draco's face. “Things would have been different if what was offered wasn't you. Given that Mr. Lucius's only child is a boy, I'm sure master Harry will vehemently reject your father. But master changed his mind immediately when he saw your picture."
"He's just a human. He will not return to Sparta and live forever on Olympus. After all, many Titans live to mingle with humans and even marry them. Why can't I?"
He glanced at his watch, and it was ten o'clock. In an hour, his class would start, and he was still far from campus. If Draco didn't make it to class in time, he would be hooked by Professor Trelawney's tantrum.
"No, no. I mean, acts of harassment don't just apply in the event of touch but also from words that are vulgar and make the other party uncomfortable," Draco explained.
Harry cleared his throat in a low affirmative, answering the man's question completely, and it made Draco sink his face into Harry's shoulders even further, embarrassed.
They were all handsome because the world market more favors handsome actors and models. Draco was used to it and wasn't a teenager who would easily sway if he was close to a model or member of an angelic boy band. But this time, Draco was awkwardly mixed with anxiety when he met the War God. He shouldn't be this handsome. The God of War, he thought, was ideally more beefy with a thick beard on his face as well as some ghastly scars.
“Beautiful flowers,” a voice suddenly heard.
Before running away, Cedric took the time to caress the top of Draco's head gently and said
"Two years," Draco said simply because he believed it would never happen.
"Of course! In your opinion, who else is this ignorant girl in the kingdom besides Arabelle?!" Cedric huffed.
"By Athena! Prince Troya! Aren't you afraid of being cursed by the gods?" The servant also presumptuously tried to stop Draco from speaking.
Draco took a deep breath. Until now, Draco didn't know why Cedric hated his brother's mistress so much. In fact, Arabelle never disturbed Cedric's composure. "She has a name. You shouldn't just call her that," Draco chided and shook his head in a very slow motion.
Draco heard the uproar around him. As he slowly opened his eyes, he began to notice that he wasn't in his room. His nose also smelled a strong spice aroma that he had never encountered before. He tried to wake up from sleep, but his whole body felt stiff as if his arms and waist wouldn't obey him. Was this how paralyzed feels like? Panic began to overtake him, but no sound escaped his throat other than a hoarse groan.
Blaise snorted. "I don't really mind if you bring up that stupid analysis of yours, but at least acknowledge me being here,"
The maid looked like she was begging, but at the same time, an aura of disgust and anger enveloped the young woman in a black-white lacy apron on her chest, typical of a royal maid. Draco’s still confused when his personal maid shook her head and gave Draco a code to tell Arabelle to leave them.
Harry took a step back, then stretched out his hand in a half bow, "Let me help you out, princess." He said mockingly.
Draco’s stared in surprise at Cedric's words. Uncontrollably, the blonde took a step back with his eyes already staring at Cedric with horror.
"I don't know," Draco answered simply, shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly.
"No, I'm just trying to understand you. I don't know you that well so I don't know if I'll like you enough. Don't worry. If we don't get along, I will still be responsible for your life."
It sounded childish, indeed, but Draco had no other choice. That's when Draco dared to look at Harry's house. This might be the last time.
"Who are you?! What do you want?!" he asked with a fear that he could not deny.
Harry turned and looked at Alden with burning eyes. "Because I decided, it's not the time for him to die yet." Harry's green eyes sparkled in the dark. "And you... Why did you let him escape on purpose?"
When Draco tried to resist once more, Harry gripped both of his hands tightly against the wall and pressed his body together, gluing the evidence of his desire to the center of Draco's body, making Draco's face flush red.
"How are you feeling?"
"Yes, Your Majesty."
Draco was stunned. Miscarriage. So, their baby was never born? Draco suddenly felt sad remembering Seraphina's smile in the painting, the smile of a very happy mother, with her arms wrapped around her stomach as if protecting her baby who was sleeping there.
✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ✧ :･ﾟ✧･ﾟ✧
"You're prettier than anyone." Harry kissed the top of Arabelle's head.
Harry was thoughtful. Seven days and Draco is in a pretty dangerous public area. His brain was spinning over what kind of security he should implement to protect Draco. Tom was still on the chase, and Hyde was somewhere, still eyeing them. Harry needed to be extra careful with Draco.
"Thank you. I am also lucky to have people like you."
"Truce?" realizing the meaning of Harry's words, Draco became fully alert.
A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door, and without warning, it opened. Alden walked in and raised his eyebrows when he saw Draco lying helplessly on the bed with a blanket covering his entire body, leaving his blonde hair sticking out.
"Prince Troya is the favorite of Spartan people. How can you let ordinary guards escort him?" Hector stated firmly. Draco felt a pain in the upper part of his stomach. His heart suddenly mourned when he saw Hector.
Harry's face turned into a worried look. The man stepped quickly towards the source of the crying sound as if he didn't care about other people's opinions of his impolite behavior.
That morning, the first thing Draco did was check his fridge and frowned when he found it full of groceries. This must be that man's job, Draco thought. He refused to mention Harry's name in an attempt to forget him, but Draco didn't want to let this distraction ruin his first day of freedom.
"What is it?" Draco finally turned around and asked coldly.
"Forgive me, Draco. I beg you, please get well soon..."
"I could have imagined it before I even tried," Harry replied, irritated.
"Harry, we're going to ride together, right?"
"Why do you keep staring at me? Do I look ugly for not wearing makeup?" Draco asked, pursing his lips in annoyance.
Cedric snorted grimly and turned his face nonchalantly to the other side of the garden when he saw his brother kneeling to help his attention-seeking mistress.
It wasn't Draco Malfoy who looked at him, the man who had only dressed up once in his life. Well, he was forced to do that for his benefit of carrying out a mission undercover as a waitress in a nightclub. In front of him is someone so lovely. It's amazingly beautiful with makeup that's not too heavy but fits perfectly on all sides.
"My name is Draco, not Seraphim, you weirdo," Draco grumbled.
"I told you my idea was ridiculous. However, without offending you, it's the first and last option you can make if you refuse to go alone. After all, this is just a companion and nothing more," explained Ron.
"Shit," Harry cursed softly with his breath already racing.
Draco sighed as the pulse increased with Harry's touch. His brain struggled over what the man was doing with his hand, but his body couldn't resist it. Draco needed Harry's hand. He needed them the most.
"Did we tell you that you were the first human lover brought to Olympus?"
"I was sent to hand you the documents," Seamus cleared his throat at the thought of something, "You may not know me, but I'm a friend of Ron and Hermione."
"Humans can't drink it; exceptions can happen if a God loves humans. Ordinary Titans don't have that privilege. Like me, Eros can give Ambrosia to Psyche. You have to ask another god to make you immortal. Only, that god has to commit to loyal to you forever." Eros explained.
"Shut your mouth, Alden!" Harry growled. "Let me take care of my own business!"
Cedric didn't feel the slightest bit daunted. Cedric was used to arguing, fighting to the point of fighting his life with his eldest cousin, two years older than him.
"The followers of Ares visited the palace of Sparta and brought their prince to Olympus," Athena confirmed once again. The Goddess of Wisdom stood before her father and looked at him confidently. At that time, she wore an ivory white dress that gave a graceful impression, but a formidable aura still radiated from her beautiful self.
Edted: 20/10/2021
~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco struggled to remember. He was sure that he was asleep as usual on the set last night. But now, he wakes up in a strange room that smells of herbs. There was no light other than sunlight pouring in from the wide cracks in the walls. His back ached from the hard bedding. Obviously, he was not sleeping on his comfortable bed.
He wanted to grab Draco's soft hand and place it on his cock, then satisfy himself in Draco's body. But he couldn't. Harry wanted to get Draco to surrender willingly. Their last two sex was not voluntary. Although in the end, Harry was able to make Draco feel good. Harry Potter never forces a woman to fall into his arms. It is the women who are scrambling to be hugged by him.
"Are you afraid of me after that incident?" even a dark tone faded in Harry's voice.
"Are you hurt?"
"Shut up!!" Draco growled, unable to stand Harry's words, which seemed to have been used to hurt him. His head felt throbbing as if it had been stabbed with an iron rod. He grimaced and held his head.
After making sure the doctor was out of the room, Harry looked back at Draco, his eyes sharp as a razor. "What was that?"
He leaned his back that wrapped in an elegant dress on the headboard of the magnificent bed that he had been sleeping on for the past five years. His heart skipped a beat as he read the vulgar lines in the book. Actually, Draco's conscience asked him to stop this disgraceful act, but Draco's brain seemed to force Draco to continue the book to its last page.
Narcissa was busy with the frypan and her ingredients when someone suddenly pulled up a chair beside Draco and sat down. Draco really couldn't believe it. Harry sat beside him without saying anything. His mother naturally didn't notice that immortal man.
"No!" Draco answered quickly and a little loudly while widening his eyes.
"Your Majesty, did you hear something?" Natalie asked in a slightly more serious tone.
Somehow the feeling of shame and humiliation creeps up Draco's mind. What a shame! Could it be that there was hidden inside him a whore ready to explode? Or could it be that Harry is just so skilled at flirting that it almost makes Draco bend his knees?
"Forgive me, Your Majesty." Draco looked at Harry sadly.
7/9/2021
By now, Draco had replaced his dress with plain clothes that was considered lighter on his body. No glittering knick-knacks decorated the shirt, only a small flower embroidered on the neck.
Draco looked doubtful for a moment. Then he sat down under a thick leaf olive tree. Eros sat next to him while Alastair just stood guard near them.
Ron glanced at Harry many times. He really wasn't used to Harry's silence—the Alpha's silence always brought a tingling feeling in Ron's stomach.
"Don't worry, Harry," Ginny put her hand on the collar of Harry's shirt, "That ugly woman won't be able to satisfy you, better let me accompany — ouch!!" Ginny shrieked in pain because Harry grabbed her hand that was in his collar. Harry's fingers gripped her hand with less than half force, hurting her until it felt like they were stabbing into the bone.
"My king! I beg you!" The queen looks pitiful.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed and stared at Draco, who was still sleeping because of the drug. Blood transfusions had been carried out, and Draco's condition gradually improved.
"How naive," Lucius said sarcastically, then rose from his seat.
"I will do it," Draco nodded. This was his attempt to survive. He will do anything as long as he doesn't die in the forest of Olympus. Draco has to endure at least until he knows why his soul got stranded here.
Only when a Demigod became a king or a war hero was their descendant status was widely announced. Not all Demigods known to man were Demigods. Many of them were lies. The Gods of Olympus didn't want to bother thinking about the Demigods because they were too busy with their own business.
Draco smiled sadly. Harry certainly didn't want his reputation to be ruined because of Draco, who looked weird in his clothes.
"No, but I'm obsessed with having an Empress," said Cedric with a meaningful smile.
Harry's blush and nervous look disappeared in an instant, replaced by a big goofy smile. Maybe he was too happy that he just kissed Draco on the lips, making Draco's eyes widen.
"I'll beat you up before I kill you," Harry lunged Doctor Jason to the floor, and they wrestled, hitting each other. But Doctor Jason, the Hyde was not used to fighting with his bare hands, so he was overwhelmed. Harry went on and on beating him mercilessly when then Draco's whimpering stopped him.
Again Cedric ignored the queen’s words. In his training clothes, the brunette stepped out to meet the guards waiting for him with light steps.
"Alpha Harry," Draco called, hoping he hadn't made the wrong move. "I am pleased to attend the event with you." Draco could feel his cheeks heat up as several soldiers and comrades watched from a distance.
"How is Draco?" asked Harry.
The Goddess of Beauty didn't care, even though she knew Ares was in another relationship. Ares was her, her property, and her allies. There was a kind of unwritten contract that made Ares almost always powerless to refuse her. That's why he always told his lovers that they should be ready to see him spend the night with Aphrodite and share him.
"In that case, will Your Majesty spend such precious time together with a lowly noble like me?" Cedric asked as he stared intently at Draco.
"Prince of Sparta, there's no need to think so complicatedly. Be happy with the life I gave you. You should be proud because you will be the first human I marry."
“You are in my house, and you need to know, my bodyguards are very unfriendly. I advise you to come down obedient and calm, for your own sake, because my bodyguards might injure you if you act stupid." Harry warned.
"I'm just feeling a little bored, and it looks like I need to see the night sky before I sleep." Draco lifted his head again to look up at the sky.
Harry felt his head grow dizzy. Ron's voice parroted in his head. As a companion and nothing more.
And it didn't take long; Harry immediately stepped firmly into the royal garden, which was certainly far from the crowd. Harry knew that his mistress had been peeking at him. His naive mistress would surely follow Harry right away.
Draco got out of bed and walked toward the door. As he remembered, last night he was looking around, then his body felt weak and may be passed out? Draco didn't remember. He grabbed the doorknob and opened it.
He’s getting more and more confused. Draco had spent the night in many forests when he went hunting with his husband, but he had never seen such a bluish spot. In fact, Draco was sure that he was also bitten by insects there.
"My sweet boy," Harry hummed, nuzzling Draco's sweat-damp hair.
Ares stopped and turned his head for a moment. He didn't feel sympathetic at all. He was just amazed to know that a Satyr dared to call his name like that.
Especially when her eyes fell upon Draco's green dress, which now sat like trash on the floor, Daphne would sigh dramatically, then grumble again in vague words. Luckily Daphne had a spare dress with her. Although not quite as fancy and beautiful as the green one Harry had torn up, it was a pretty good dress. It is maroon color and simple cut, perfectly wrapping Draco's body.
Aphrodite's anger made her reluctant to be loyal. She was the goddess of Love and Beauty, and she has the right to share her love and body with whomever she wants. No man in this world has the right to claim ownership of her beautiful self.
Every time he saw Alden, Draco was punched by a terrible feeling of fright and guilt. Harry threatens to kill anyone off guard and let Draco escape. Is it worth sacrificing one life to escape? He doesn't know Alden, but if he gets freedom at the expense of other people's lives, it still doesn't feel right to him.
Harry glanced at Alden with sharp eyes, then grabbed a towel to rub his wet hair. "I was about to kill him."
Harry cursed in his heart bitterly as he remembered the main cause of the tragedy that befell him at that time.
Draco took the god's hand, which was warm and slightly rough. He could see the fresh scars from the grip of the sword. Ares regularly trains and was never satisfied with his current skills. Considering he was nearly three thousand years old, he was probably the best swordsman in Greece.
"What is your relationship with the God of War? I thought he would come for me himself." Draco, in his Troya form, asked innocently.
"Prince Ced—"
The door opened, and Daphne hurried inside. The woman gasped to find Draco's tear-streaked state in that dress — an exclusive dress designed by a famous designer, the only one in the world, which was very expensive and must have made all the women envy — now dangling rips across Draco's chest in a pitiful and disheveled state. The expensive make-up on Draco's face also went awry because of the tear marks on Draco's face.
"Thank you, Glenice. Don't forget to take my clothes back to my room without anyone knowing. I don't want the nobles to look down on me." Draco glanced down at his luxurious clothes piled up like a pile of junk on the hay.
"Mr. Potter's most current lover," said Daphne dryly. “Ah, you don't know, right, everyone's talking about you. In fact, your name has appeared on several gossip tabloids and gossip shows, which discuss Harry Potter's mysterious newest lover. They are guessing and looking for evidence that you two have sex. They are curious about how two men are having sex. That's why the assistants were giggling while checking your sheets."
"Your Majesty! Just let me,"
Harry's head was lowered, and Draco felt certain Harry would kiss him for a moment. But somehow, the man's neck stiffened and stopped his intention. Harry pushed Draco away. Then turned his body toward the door.
"Okay," Ron said goodbye to Dean and walked to the car, followed by Harry.
"What do you mean?"
Ares smiled at him. "You're right. We gods should just live on a tropical island. There aren't too many mosquitoes there," Ares said half-jokingly.
"I don't know," Draco blurted and wiped his tears.
"Yes, humans love heroic stories," Lasonas laughed.
Harry's frowned slightly when he could faintly inhale the scent of blood. Although the scent was faint, Harry was sure there was blood in the room. Harry's sense of smell was very sensitive to the scent that always accompanies him on the battlefield.
Harry jerked his head and looked at the man of Greek descent who was sitting in front of him. They are discussing a partnership that their two companies have recently entered into. Greyson Rouvas, a man of British-Greek blood, is one of Harry's business partners. He is tall and has a pair of amber eyes that are often the dream of women. His very successful career made Harry interested in collaborating.
"What?"
Harry's jaw immediately tightened when he heard the words of the girl on his lap. In fact, that man's hands are already tightly clenched. "Just watch. I'm going to shoo those maids away and exile them into conflict territory," Harry hissed.
Hyde? Who would want to bear such a horrible name? Draco furrowed his brows, confused.
Draco was still trying to analyze the current situation. Slowly, he was able to overcome the awkwardness and began to think logically. He couldn't carelessly open his mouth. He couldn't joke and laugh as he had with Alastair and Ares' envoy before. He was just a human who had lost his freedom. A prince who was called the most beautiful in Greece but was not immortal. A human who knew nothing about Olympus and its gods and was not yet twenty years old.
Humans are creatures who are never satisfied and expect a lot of things from Olympus. They want a miracle to make their life easier. That was the reason why Zeus locked the mountains of Olympus from the humans. Humans should not hear the words of the gods other than through the Oracles. Zeus gave Hermes an assignment for it. The messenger god occasionally visited the Oracles who resided in the temple and delivered the messages of the gods.
Draco took the first bite and moaned, feeling the crème melt in his mouth and creating flavors that mingled with sweetness and delicacy. Little did he realize that Harry was staring at his expression with hungry eyes. Harry was in a horrible mood. His indescribable desire frustrated him immensely.
While Cedric was forcing his brain to figure out a way, he accidentally looked at Draco's servant, Glenice, standing right beside the white horse Draco was riding with her head bowed respectfully.
"I can't. I'm scared," Draco said in a voice that was already shaking violently.
"Yes,"
"Where is he?" Ares asked. The transmitter was starting to weaken, and he had only a vague idea of the prince's location.
Draco laughed loudly when he heard Cedric's words. "You don't have to say words like that to me again. I'm your brother's wife. You'll never get me," Draco said when he had stopped laughing.
Draco was ready with this question, his pseudonym. "Darcy," He replied stiffly.
"I should have sentenced you all to death, wasn't my message clear? Protect the prince of Sparta with your life. Luckily, my mood was good today so let the prince of Sparta punish you," Ares said coldly.
"Cedric. Just call me Cedric." Cedric stared intently into Draco's eyes.
Draco walked without direction. All the guards and servants that Draco accidentally passed looked at Draco with prizing eyes. Even in a simple dress, Draco's beauty radiated so extraordinarily. It was as if he had just descended from heaven.
Draco jumped up, grabbed the liquid soap, and then rubbed it over Harry's tough, muscular back. The touch made both of them gasp. Harry couldn't even stop his groan; his manhood was already so hard like a rock down there until it hurts, protesting to be satisfied.
Draco's fingers explored Harry's body, and the man left him to do what he wants. Finally, as Draco's lips curiously want to taste Harry's cock so bad, Harry raised Draco's head with a sharp, misty gaze full of lust.
"Room for me?" Draco made sure.
"Prince Troya, are you all right?" said one of them.
"God Ares! Have mercy on us!" The Queen of Sparta, whom Draco thought was overly dramatic and exaggerated, was, in fact, probably the only sane human in the palace.
Draco started to panic as he slowly walked back without making a sound. Where's his guardian angel? Draco thought. He felt like he wanted to scream for help, but screaming means telling him where he is, and Draco doesn't want to get killed.
"For the time being, you will inevitably have to wear my clothes. You can't wear my robes alone until we return to the palace," said Harry.
His whole life changed in just a short time, his whole plan was shattered, and he was now collapsed here. Back in the devil's clutch, and now even owes his life to that man.
"Maybe he's just waiting until dinner is made. He's probably worried about what people will say if he divorces me too soon,"
An incandescent light finally flashed above Blaise's head. "Ah! Wait, you mean..."
Draco nodded. "It's okay,"
"Good, bring him to me."
Harry gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his excitement. "Nothing," his voice was a deep groan, trying to hold himself back when Draco's soft, soapy hands touched his waist.
The three of them walked back through the halls. Tonight is so cold, but suddenly, Pansy paused. Draco and Blaise looked at her, confused.
"Your face is red. Do you want me to touch you, eh?" Cedric asked in the midst of his laughter.
"Then what do you want to talk about?" Draco felt stupid.
"He claims to be the messenger of Ares and has medicine to heal you," The Spartan King spoke with a sad expression on his face.
Draco looked back at the passenger and saw Harry sitting as if waiting for him to get into the car. "Ah yes," Draco muttered, and since he didn't have time to find another taxi, he forced his way into the car.
"Dead," Harry interrupted, finishing Draco's sentence. "Abaddon smells you. He wants you." Harry touched his face, which Draco just elbowed.
This time Draco closed his eyes while slapping himself on the cheek. When he opened his eyes, he is still in the same place. Again Draco closed his eyes and slapped his cheeks for the umpteenth time.
"No, of course not. Don't the priests at your temple tell the truth? When a god comes to their lover mostly, it's because they like each other. We don't kidnap or rape. There may have been some before, but believe me, we're all more mature and wiser."
"Hmm, how should I explain this… Let's just say we have a long history. You can study it later. Ares Palace also has a library. However, the books may be dusty because the occupants hardly ever go there. Our history here begins with Kronos, who arrived with thousands of Titans about four thousand years ago," Argus said.
The touch of Draco's soft hands on his back made the situation even worse. It turns Harry on to the levels he couldn't bear it. Draco frowned at Harry's moaning sound. He couldn't see Harry's expression, could only see Harry's back hair, which was black and now wet, attached to the nape of his neck.
Like what Troya usually does, Draco smiled. This time he improvised by waving his hand the same way members of the British royal family do. But he soon realized that his way of greeting was too foreign and lowered his hand because he imitated the behavior of the nobility in the twentieth century.
"Unfortunately not, although Hermione sends her regards and hopes to see you at another time," Seamus shrugged. "Harry sent me."
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco beckoned Glenice for her to follow. Because Glenice was following him on foot, he couldn't bear to rush his horse. Not far in front of him, he saw Cedric stop his horse. It seemed the man was deliberately waiting for Draco.
"This is Daphne," said Harry calmly. "She will prepare you for tonight." After that, Harry stepped back, turned, and left the room.
Harry glanced at Draco's bound wrist and realized that it was hurting Draco. "Don't move around, or you'll get bruises when this is over."
Harry was surprised by Draco's behavior because of the blonde's position at this time. Harry could freely stare at Draco's chapped red lips, which for some reason, invited his desire to taste those lips.
"I want to take a shower first," Draco said, and immediately got up from the chair and headed for the bathroom.
Due to the limited access in the mountains of Olympus, no human dared to roam there. In supplying food and raw materials, Ares asked several Demigods to make transactions with the humans at the border.
Instead of leaving, though, the taller man pushed back the shower curtain, revealing his own nude body. Draco’s eyes were drawn to the massive erection that the man was sprouting. He felt his own dick twitch in interest.
"Oh? Do you need me to warm you up?"
After that brief conversation, Cedric and Draco's journey was decorated with joking laughter until the sound of galloping horses made Draco's laughter instantly disappear.
"Oh, did any Spartan philosopher have such an opinion? Interesting, we don't really follow your progress," Argus commented.
Draco never remembered reading Ares' story where he had a legal spouse. It seems like this was a new chapter in the story about Troya—Prince of Sparta, who was unfortunate to be forced to become the bride of the violent God—Ares.
"Yes. Mr. Draco has finished his breakfast and is resting in his room.”
Harry seemed to be thinking. He was considering whether to send Draco home or not. Draco knew very well that Harry was going to kill him. But why Draco? Does Harry know that Draco is a demigod? Is this fate? Were they really mean for each other?
Harry crushed Draco's open lips and slipped his tongue inside. Their tongues are tangled, hot, and wet. Harry's lips smashed Draco's lips mercilessly, smacking each side, with enthusiasm.
Draco smiled softly when he finally managed to read the last sentence in the book. Reading romantic novels like this tended to make his young souls feel resurrected. He somehow wanted to feel the strange feeling people called love. He wants to fall in love with the right man, and Draco wants to spend a lot of time with him.
"I changed them," Harry answered casually.
Draco felt a hot tingle all over his body, and he stretched. There was a sensation creeping from his lips that felt good when someone grounded him. Draco weakly blinked half asleep and opened his eyes.
"Sssh... Don't worry, everything will be fine," Harry gently stroked the top of Arabelle's head.
"I'm sorry, Ares," Draco looked down. He hoped Ares hadn't gotten too fed up with him.
Draco flushed angrily. “Are you an animal or what?! Get out now. You better not expect me to help you with that!”
The man looked startled by Draco's words, and then he chuckled softly. "Ah, you're right."
It was useless asking for help because Draco was sure that no one would dare to help him. All those cowardly clubgoers just stared at the scene in front of them with their stupid faces. The club owner still stared in amazement at Harry as he walked casually, leaving the room with Draco struggling and screaming in his bodyguard arms.
"Yeah... So beautiful..." Cedric muttered incoherently. His eyes still faithfully enjoying Draco's face from the side.
"At the restaurant?" said Ron. "You know, that place is a lot quieter than a park, and it sure is..." Ron swallowed hard at Harry's somber expression. "We don't have to bother hiding and observing from a distance."
"Good morning," The masculine voice sounded very close, and Draco turned his head in astonishment. The sight before him made his heart flutter. Harry was there, in his bed, they were in the same blanket, and then he looked at Harry's blanket, which had almost slipped over his hips.
Hermione smiled again. "Don't worry, I already know." Then she looked at the group of women who were now scattered and busy gossiping with each other. "Don't mind them. They just envy you."
In Draco's time, stories about aliens were very popular. From the story of the first meeting between aliens and humans in the old film titled ET, Men In Black, who keeps the secrets of alien activities on Earth, to the alien superhero named Thor, who was a member of the Avengers in the Marvel universe.
A wet and warm sensation fills Draco, and the boy whimpers out weakly, tightening his pussy around the sensations. Harry keeps filling him with thick semen and holds on to his baby tighter, thrusting weakly before stilling and sinking his weight on top of Draco's softer, much more pliant body.
Hearing Draco's reply, Harry turned his head and stopped in his tracks. Obviously, the Alpha was shocked.
"So how about it, Your Majesty? You won't let them down, will you?" Cedric pointed to several guards. They seemed to be placing their high hopes on Cedric.
When a big wolf confronted the Prince—that's when Draco gave up all his remaining courage and ran as fast as he could. He screamed desperately. Even though he realized there wasn't much he could do—he didn't want to give up so easily. Ares came just in time and killed the wolf. The other herd fled because they knew that Ares was one of the rulers of Olympus. The God of War still wore his metal helmet and brushed the blood off his weapon with a broadleaf. He then stretched out his hand.
But Harry wasn't there when Draco was in pain and crying. He wasn't there when Draco was struggling to maintain their relationship with all his might.
Arabelle seemed confused by Harry's attitude. It was unusual for Harry to leave her immediately after the man had reached his peak. Usually, the man would hug Arabelle, kiss her forehead lovingly, and throw compliments that always made her happy and proud.
"I can't expect anything from you?"
It was at this moment that a figure emerged from the shadows, stepping closer to Draco's body lying on the cold floor. He lifted the body easily as if there was no significant weight.
The answer was crystal clear, and Harry managed to make Draco fell silent. Along the way, they did not say another word.
"Sshhh... You're going to hurt your arm if you keep struggling like that," Harry's lips crept up and landed on Draco's.
Draco turned on the light switch and scanned the room. Nothing unusual. But the last voice he heard, like someone whispering in his ear, was so close and real. Even Draco could still remember how the man's breath had hit his neck.
have a meaning that can be used for more than two people. Basically, that
"An easy job like this won't hurt me," Draco said with a satisfied smile as he saw the helplessness of his maid.
Harry chuckled at Draco's scowl. "You hate me?" The man casually stood up, unashamed by his muscular naked body. “Look at me, Draco, you left marks on my body. You were very excited last night, like a cat in heat clawing here and there to be satisfied. And for your passion last night, I'm not sure if you hate me."
"Yes, you have your own room. Why? Do you want to share a room with me right away?" Ares laughed. The prince's face turned red again.
"It's a marriage, Ares! You haven't done that in the thousands of years you've lived. The bond never mattered to you. Don't you agree with me not believing in marriage? Why now?" Aphrodite did not immediately believe her lover. She pushed Ares away from her.
Cedric looked at the blonde with tenderness before his lips moved to answer the question. "If you want to thank me, don't give me words that I might forget when I wake up from my sleep, but give me words that allow me to tell the world that you are mine."
"If possible, don't fall in love with him," said the Goddess.
"Why don't you meet me in my study room?" the voice in the darkness startled Draco.
"I should be afraid. You are the God of War," Draco replied quietly.
"Then I'll ask Harry to ride beside Your Majesty so that we can get some fresh ai—"
Draco glanced at Harry again and looked back at Professor Trelawney. But Draco's thoughts were wandering, and Professor Trelawney's voice was nowhere to be heard in his ears. His ears rang so intensely till it makes him dizzy.
Draco quickly closed Luna's sketch, then glanced at Harry, who had just arrived and sat next to him.
"Really? I don't know about that," Prince Cedric shrugged his shoulders casually.
Blaise was silent and didn't reply.
"A man?" Luna raised her eyebrows.
"I'm fine," Draco hid the bracelet under his shawl.
Draco frowned. Since his last attempt to escape, the guard over him had been tight. There were two men in black suits and brawny bodies guarding the door. Tonight is the first time Draco has been given the freedom to come down and out of this room. If Draco was alert enough, maybe he could escape this house.
Draco never thought that his 'survival' effort that he did—can be sweet, dangerous, and exciting at the same time.
"I'm fine, Prince Cedric." Draco held both of Cedric's hands that were cupping his face, and with a gentle motion, Draco tried to remove them from his face, but unfortunately, Cedric tightened them instead, as if he didn't want Draco to pull his hands away.
Harry growled fiercely, his eyes burning. "Try it if you dare ask Hermione to release you, and if that woman dared to do something, I would take her life away." Harry hissed furiously. "And I never messed with what I said, Draco, your freedom will be replaced by the lives of those who let their guard down or those who try to save you."
After making sure everything was done, Draco immediately moved to meet Harry, standing right beside the dark brown horse that had brought them here.
"Get more papyrus. I'm out of paper," the Prince of Sparta ordered his servant.
"I'll run away from here as soon as possible. Don't mind me. I'll be home a few hours after your return to the palace,"
Draco was just about to open his mouth and answer the question, but his husband had already cast a disapproving look on the King of the Delion. With just that gaze, the older man managed to lose the wide smile.
After Draco was dry, Harry tucked him in. He then laid down himself and drifted off into a satiated sleep.
Both Harry and Draco immediately frowned in confusion when they heard Arabelle's words until her hand moved to lift her flower dress in a trembling motion.
"Armageddon is a war between demons versus angels. Between them, it means that the creature comes from both fortresses, but they will be one of them." The tattoo on Luna's neck seems to move around following the sound of her voice.
Aphrodite looked emotional, her beautiful face filled with rage. Aphrodite did not love Ares, but all this time, the Goddess was sure—even though Ares had many other lovers—he loved Aphrodite. Having Ares disobey her had made the Goddess feel hurt. Seeing the annoyed Aphrodite, Ares immediately grabbed the woman's slender arm and then kissed the back of her hand lovingly.
"Take care of him," Harry didn't look at Draco anymore. The man immediately walked out and slammed the door behind him, angrily.
Clean up.
"Since I was little, the door didn't want to be opened." The man who had a large body chuckled as if there was something funny.
Draco stiffened all over his body at such arrogant orders. Unconsciously his eyes radiated hatred. Who would this man dare to order him like this? As Draco was pensive, another waitress nervously pushed him into a seat, obeying Harry's request, so Draco was forced to sit next to Harry.
Harry snorted and glared at Draco. "What do you think? I waited for you in my study room and then realized that you, with your stubborn head, decided to challenge me,"
Alden was silent, staring at Harry with a flat face, completely ignoring Draco's presence. Draco frowned. Did this guy really have no expression?
"What's wrong with him?" Blaise asked.
"Yeah, you should remember your position," Ares reluctant to admit his guilt.
"Sorry... Sorry..." Arabelle’s voice shaking vigorously. It seemed that the girl was about to cry again.
Was this how Narcissus feels when he sees his own reflection? His reflection was so perfect that he fell in love with himself. But Draco wasn't that naive. He was a modern young man who wasn't easily swayed by someone's beautiful face.
is currently peeking at us behind the curtains. She's so cute," Draco shook his head and smiled.
"Yes, Your Majesty. I'm sorry," said Arabelle. She got up in a hurry and stepped out of the gazebo rotundas, located above a small river.
Ah... that man was after something important—his
Luna scans the room and finds Draco. "Hey, Dray!" she called cheerfully. "How's your day?"
"We can't talk about things like that here," Draco glanced at a guard standing not far from them. Although the guard was standing with a straight face, he had no interest in Cedric and Draco's business. They knew if the guard was eavesdropping on something that might stir up the gossip world of the members of the nobility.
Draco finally started to give up and surrender — placing his little cute head on one of the man's shoulders, while Harry was still busy reading thick fantasy books and acted as if he hadn't had Draco on his lap all this time.
"Stay out of my business, Icarus." As usual, Harry shows his straight face.
She knelt, trying to make her eyes meet one of the messengers. She hoped that the envoys would feel her sincerity and refrain from reporting Sparta to Ares. If the king was a little wiser, he should have chosen to be safe. No matter how dear he was to Troya—still nothing compared to the curse from Olympus.
"Of course, Duke Richmond," Draco smiled as he rose from his seat. He took Charles's outstretched cold hand. Is that man sick?
"I would like to meet Mr. Harry Potter," Draco muttered nervously to the receptionist in the luxurious office lobby.
The water slid smoothly down Draco's throat, drenching his thirst. For a moment, when the water had completely moved, Harry was still playing on Draco's lips, toying with him.
"Why?" The Goddess was surprised.
Draco immediately knew what Luna meant, so he nodded in response. And Luna put the book in her bag.
He admired Cedric's courage. Cedric still dared to approach him even though the man had received blatant threats from Harry; it seemed that the prince had never been afraid of his sibling, even though his sibling was a king who might be able to put him to death even though they had the same blood.
Harry puffed with anger. "That window!" he pointed furiously, then strode across the room and closed the window harshly. He turned to face Draco in a fighting position. "Next time, close the windows tightly at night!!" he shouted in anger.
Pansy rolled her eyes lazily. "Oh, don't be jealous, Blaise. And Draco," Pansy turned to stare at Draco. "Potter likes me? Harry freaking Potter
"I'm sorry, as far as I know, it's not good to talk when eating," Draco responded in a small voice.
"What are you doing here?" asked Alastair. Draco frowned slightly because he was confused by the stiff interaction between the two people called family.
that's much more interesting than me?"
The receptionist looked at Ron and recognized him. "Oh, Mr. Weasley, welcome," Her demeanor turned friendly, and Draco sneered at the difference in treatment he received, especially since the receptionist was looking at Ron with adoration. “My apologies, this afternoon we sent a message to your secretary that today's meeting has been canceled. Mr. Potter suddenly had to go overseas."
In the morning, as usual, two young maids were tidying up Draco's room as if they were new. Draco still sat on the couch after taking a shower and let the maids make up his bed.
Without realizing it, Natalie immediately breathed a sigh of relief.
Before Draco married him, he knew the blonde was already friends with Cedric. As long as they were married in the past five years, Harry never suspected Draco and Cedric's closeness because he knew that they were only friends.
"Ares, you are indeed my best lover." Aphrodite threw her beautiful body against Ares' sturdy chest. The Goddess fiddled with her slender fingers around Ares's neck and acted seductively.
"Of course, I have many witnesses who are willing to testify to that, Zeus," Athena nodded.
"Right now, you can say you don't love me. But I'll keep trying. I'll keep trying until the time comes when you say you love me."
Harry thinned his lips and watched the old King's face turn paler. He gave the other man a piercing, intimidating stare he always gave. "Since you've prepared an amazing party for us, this time I forgive you," said Harry as he averted his gaze away.
"I have a bad feeling about the prince, Ares. Can you just call it off?"
Well, that might take a long time. Harry frowned at Draco's expression. This boy must always be forced and still tied up, and Harry actually doesn't like hurting anyone he will sleep with. The proof of his desire was clear, and Draco refused to see him. Harry pushed Draco's body into the shower, letting the warm water soak them both.
"What? How can it be like that? You can't just replace Doctor Jason with another doctor!” Draco's heart skipped a beat. If Harry is to replace Doctor Jason with a female doctor, then his plan to escape from this hospital and escape from Harry's clutches was just a fairy tale.
"Draco," Harry's voice startled Draco, who was pensive on the balcony. The same balcony where Harry threw Draco horrifically into the pool underneath him a few days ago.
"At night, you can see the sky. There is one star among the star clusters that we can always recognize and yearn,"
For the umpteenth time, Draco took a deep breath. He must have looked weird in these baggy clothes.
He is not required to come; who would dare to protest if he was absent from attending the event?
The room was dark because the windows of the room were tightly closed by curtains. It smelled musty as if it had not been entered in a long time. Draco fumbled on the wall and found a switch in the room, he pushed the switch, and a soft yellow light instantly shone through the room.
"We love playing games, but that's only in certain environments," Draco responded. He anticipated that Dionysius would one day try to check the truth with Sparta and find out about that, in reality, the Spartans were too severe and rarely partied.
"I don't want you as my lover, and I'm not ready for anything to do with you." Draco vigorously argued.
Harry's jaw hardened. He won't let that happen.
I know it's too soon, but I just want to wish a happy new year to all of us, have an amazing holiday. Tbh, I hope I could update a new chapter in the new year, with new dramas between Draco and Harry. They still have a long journey *sigh dramatically*
"Didn't I say that I would help you escape?" Hector forced Draco to carry him again. They fled into the thick of the trees.
repeated the voice.
"What happened to His Majesty?!"
“It’s — wait!” Draco gasped, feeling too overwhelmed from his multiple recent orgasms. His cock stayed hard as Harry continued to press harshly against his prostate. Draco let out another cry. “It’s too much. I’m going to fall.” He cried, barely able to keep standing even with Harry’s help.
"What if His Majesty finds out?" asked Glenice worriedly. She looked at Draco from the mirror's reflection.
"Do you like it?" said Cedric as he stopped his horse when they were finally exactly where Cedric wanted to show Draco.
When he bathed today, he once again made sure. No camera.
"What do you mean you're fine? Your guardian angel doesn't know how to dispel the devil's whisper. That's why you feel pain in the brain." Harry then returned to focus on looking at Professor Trelawney again in front of the class.
But now Draco was a little doubtful of their happiness. Because there must be times when they were not familiar, or there was boredom. The proof was that Alastair was born a Demigod. His mother must have been a human who had contact with Eros.
Draco took a deep breath as if he'd just drowned. The sun's rays made him dazzle. Draco’s eyes are too sensitive. Not only his eyes, but all his senses were very sensitive. Draco was sure he even heard the ants' footsteps in the side garden. It all made him dizzy.
At this time, Dionysius, the Wine God who had been busy chatting with Phobos and Deimos, walked over to the table of the Titans and Demigods. Draco was joined in and dined with them.
"What do you mean?"
Draco let out a sigh of relief as his buttocks touched the very soft feel of the glorious chair. He relaxed his back to the throne. His two slender hands had moved to hold the elbows of the throne that looked very majestic.
"Isn't the night sky very beautiful?" asked Draco with eyes still fixed on the sky.
A werewolf man looked at Draco from the side of the road. His eyes that glowed even during the daytime scared Draco a little. Only a little, because not all werewolves are evil and dangerous. The man smirked as he looked at Draco, and now Draco was really scared. He seemed to know that Draco could see his wolf eyes and wondering what to do with Draco.
"I've never changed. I've always had a crush on you. In the past, I thought that friendship might be enough, but not anymore. I can't keep my feelings hidden in our friendship."
Draco straightened his face and looked back. He ventured to examine Ares's face. It seemed like what he said was sincere. At least in the near future, his life is not in danger. "Why do you want to marry me?" Draco couldn't help but ask.
"I'm not shy, Alastair! Normally one wouldn't discuss this with other people. God! How old are you anyway?"
The bodyguards stared at each other, trying to make a sound, but couldn't. They are blameworthy. Alden, as their superior, has instructed them to check anyone before entering and exiting Draco's room.
“You are no substitute for anyone!” Harry interrupted, looking menacing. They stood facing each other, measuring each other's strength.
Ron paused, then shrugged his shoulders. "I don't think we should get involved in Harry Potter's business. He's a wonderful business partner, and I'm glad my company is working with his company, but from a personal perspective..." Ron ran his fingers across Hermione's back. "I don't really like him."
"If this Lady is curious, she can tell me. I will answer." Draco said as he placed the small white cup decorated with gold flowers on the table.
Again, Cedric was made to chuckle at Draco's antics. "Of course you can," said Cedric, which made Draco smile happily.
Draco took a deep breath. He had to make up the story!
Angry, Draco tilted his chin up at Harry. "I'd rather die than sell myself to you," He muttered harshly. The sound throughout the club was immediately filled with anxious buzzing awaiting Harry's reaction.
Hermione's husband seemed to love his wife very much. The man looked at Hermione like she was the most beautiful woman in the world.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Yayaya... Then what?"
Narcissa turned and looked at Draco. "Hi, sweety. What do you want me to make for your breakfast?" she asked.
A crisp laugh escaped Arabelle's lips when she heard the words Harry had just said. Without asking Harry's permission, Arabelle willingly leaned her narrow back against Harry's firm chest.
Harry wasn't the type of king to shut his ears to the news that spread around his kingdom. Harry knew for sure about the public secret that his wife was the perfect among all the people in this kingdom.
"How should I address you, Lord Ares?" Draco ventured to ask.
"Honestly, there are some, but that's due to the human's wrongdoing,"
Without thinking, Draco took wide strides towards Cedric. The blonde raised the sword in his hand and pointed it hastily at Cedric's neck. And as expected, Cedric was able to dodge so easily.
"Why did you bring me here?" Draco asked boldly.
"I know it was all accidental, but do local earthquakes happen here often?"
Ron sighed. "Since you don't seem to like coming alone—and yes, I find it very sad if you leave without a partner, I suggest you take one of the Omegas to go with you? You know, be your temporary Mate."
The toilet is quite crowded. Draco walked into the cubicle and locked the door. What a challenging and unexpected day. Who would have thought he would meet his guardian angel? Maybe Icarus really was Draco's guardian angel because Harry had said the same thing.
"That is the sacred temple of Athena. How could the Goddess of Wisdom curse me?" Draco insisted.
Oh, my poor poor baby Draco :((
"What did you mix in Draco's drink?"
Whatever it was, Ares wanted to get to know his new wife better.
The sound of Draco's shoe tapping echoed so real amidst the boisterous sound of the orchestra, which was still passionately performing various musical instruments. Draco strode steadily and elegantly toward his seat where he was destined.
Harry just nodded his head faintly and gave Arabelle a faint smile.
"What's the matter, Draco? Does your stomach hurt?" asked the doctor, looking panicked.
"Master, you've been injured in this accident too," Alden interrupted anxiously.
Harry turned his head, looked at Alden, and frowned. "Ah, yes. He's fine, just had an attack on his head, he's in pain."
"Ah yes," Draco said casually as he took a few steps back, creating some distance between them.
The order made Draco straighten his chin arrogantly, "I have introduced myself, and I have brought a drink to the honorable Mr. Potter, so I am leaving," Draco replied curtly as he got up from his seat after all his mission was accomplished.
"Look over there. Don't they look good together?" Aphrodite laughed.
"My turn," Harry growled hoarsely.
"That—you asked me to wait outside the room. It turns out I could hear a little of your conversation," Draco tried to hide the fact that he was trying to eavesdrop.
"Ares' area of power is filled with the toughest warriors belonging to Olympus. Including the women who are average Amazon warriors like me. For those of us who respect Ares, women are a weak side to him. Argus and Lasonas don't talk about it, but actually, we might as well create a situation that forces some of his lovers left," Attica confessed.
Draco enjoyed the freedom in and out of this room to the fullest. Oh, he still wants to leave this house, but not now. He's still traumatized by yesterday's incident. At least in this house, he's safe. Alden still watches him quietly as Draco paces out of the room, especially when he took a walk in the garden. But Draco learned to ignore him.
"I think it's my own problem. You don't need to think about it. You're already perfect," Ares rubbed the back of the prince as he hugged him.
Draco thought triumphantly.
Draco had tried to be loyal, to keep the only love he already had.
Who will punish the Gods of Olympus? Only Zeus can do it, but Draco doubted that Zeus would punish his son for the death of a mere human like him. Letting him in and sat on the chair was the sanest decision at the moment.
"Draco, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call me. I will ride beside your carriage," said Cedric, which made Draco managed to avert his eyes from Harry.
He didn't know since when the sight that many people might think of as a gruesome sight had become such a fantastic sight to Draco. Maybe... since his father forced him to abandon love for the throne.
So, who's knocking on his door right now?
“W-Would,” Draco cleared his throat because his voice was so hoarse. “Would you like to be brought a drink?”
Hearing Draco's call, Harry stopped and turned around. He raised his eyebrows slightly.
"I disagree, Zeus! Ares is our son. It would be too pathetic for him to be eliminated from the twelve gods of Olympus!" Hera didn't want to accept it.
"It seems that you are quite intelligent and wise, prince of Sparta. You will indeed be my wife, and I will try to make you comfortable living here. But there are boundaries that you must not cross. I will discuss it another time. Alastair! Accompany him around or direct him to his room. Or maybe you want to continue your sleep, prince of Sparta?" Ares smirked at him.
They had not slept in the same room for three days. But Ares decided not to talk about it and was sweet as usual. He was smiling and asking how he was. They were also still eating at the same table, and Ares learned a lot of new things from his wife.
"Seems like you're obsessed with all my stuff, Draco. My sword and now my horse."
Greyson stared at Harry's departure. It couldn't be helped that he was worried about Draco's condition. Greyson has already fallen into Draco's beauty. Maybe next time, they would meet again if fate allowed.
The king of Sparta had made a foolish decision. Defying the messengers of the gods was enough to make Sparta cursed. What's more, that god was Ares. The God of War was notorious for being merciless on the battlefield.
"Call the doctor." It was Harry's voice. Was it Harry who saved him? Besides…why did that man save him?
Draco wasn't angry with Cedric's words which could be categorized as an insult to the royalty. The young man laughed along with him.
With dignified steps, he walked on the velvet carpet that adorned the entire palace floor. His pace quickened as he suddenly felt his heart quiver a little as he recalled his wife's face.
"Yes! I'm here! Get me out of here!" Then the carriage stopped. Draco’s head collided with the wall because the carriage was a little unstable. He complained while rubbing his forehead.
Oh God, he hoped it was that easy. The trunk opened slightly, and a glimmer of light entered through an opening that was only narrowly opened.
Draco was ushered into a lower ballroom, and Harry stood there. The man briefly cast a complimenting glance but said nothing. Even in the car, they drove along in silence. Harry apparently intended to maintain the silence until it reached its destination. But Draco couldn't stand it. The only weapon to keep him from falling for Harry's charms was to challenge him constantly.
"What do you mean, Prince Cedric?" Draco was confused.
"You're crazy," Draco shook his head in disbelief.
"Thank you, Your Royal Highness. You also look very handsome tonight. I'm sure you make many people swoon with your good looks."
"WHAT?!" An ear-piercing shout filled the small house as Draco's servant finished her sentence. The shout came from Arabelle. She stood right beside Harry.
The clothes Draco had bought him were so numerous that it required three large suitcases to pack them, not to mention one large suitcase containing a collection of shoes that Draco didn't even get to wear.
"Do you know why he is doing this, Athena? I did repeatedly force him to marry but not to humans!" Zeus said again, disappointed.
Draco moved with anticipation. After all, he hadn't fought swords in a long time. Known as a perfect queen, he would not want to disgrace his reputation with his defeat in front of the royal guards.
“I'll help you, Draco, but you have to help me too. I also need my own release. Look at me, sweetheart, look at my body…” Harry opened his black, silk robe, and his body was naked underneath it. Draco's breath caught when he saw the evidence of Harry's desire; it was so hard and firm. "Use me, Draco, let me inside you and heal you." Those words were the only request Harry never used to anyone, and he only did this to Draco.
Draco muttered, cursing to himself.
However, he decided to keep his mouth shut and not voice his opinion. Seeing the many guards and maids who were already sitting under a shady tree while joking made his heart warm a little. He didn't want to make the people feel irritated.
"Does it hurt?" Draco asked as the boy gently stroked Arabelle's skin.
Alden nodded. "Alive,"
Alastair was one of Ares' knights of high rank, and Ares assigned him to guard the Prince of Sparta. He was a Demigod, which meant he had god's blood running through him, but Draco never asked Alastair's father or mother.
"You mean you want to bring someone to make you love me?" Harry asked.
Harry shifted his gaze from the dark brown horse in front of him to the figure of the blonde who had just said his name.
Harry left Draco on the dance floor alone. Luckily Draco smiled happily, so Harry's departure didn't invite many questions from the gossipy-loving royal guests.
Draco immediately made a painful face. "Help me..." he groaned as naturally as possible.
Ron scowled, displeased that his attempt had been dismissed before he had even tried. "No." He shook his head firmly. "I'm sure my idea this time—will come to success. But above all, you must be willing to give it a try. As the last opportunity."
"I've been thinking about this for a long time. Look, he's always aware that Potter is watching us. And Draco also talks about Potter a lot, I know they're just hated speech, but it's proof that he always cares about Potter. Too bad he doesn't want to admit it." Pansy sighed.
Harry didn't say anything, even put on an expressionless face. If there is a face competition with no expression for the longest, that guy will definitely win. Harry often showed his dull face almost every time Draco talked to him. Like an expressionless human, but he wasn't human.
Harry wasn't in the least bit interested in looking at Ron as he said, "Do what you want to do, Ron."
"We'll be there in a minute. I want to see the scenery around, so don't forbid me to ride a horse." Draco threatened with his funny voice, which made Glenice sigh harshly.
Without preventing it, Draco quickly cast his sharp gaze on the man who was currently walking his feet towards Draco with a slight smile on his handsome face.
The man chuckled. The young man in front of him was charming. Greyson thought he was a woman, but when he straightened up, Greyson realized that he was a man. Perhaps this young man was the most beautiful man he had ever met. Yes, he was extraordinarily beautiful. His long blonde hair and crystal clear eyes kept Greyson stunned.
"This doesn't make sense," Ares shook his head.
For months Draco had been held by Vlad. The man did not allow him to come out of the room.
Harry returned his stare with a sweet, evil smile. "If you promise to be good, maybe I'll offer you a comfortable place, next to me in the car."
Draco suddenly felt breathless, so he immediately followed Alden's footsteps out of the room.
"My bird..." Draco squeaked, stepping closer to Harry.
Draco does love books. Moreover, the peculiar odor of the book made it look like someone was using drugs. The difference is, the smell of books does not harm anybody.
Ares wasn't a god with a character who cared about culture, let alone the constellations of stars. The Titans built a stargazing tower because of its high enough location and perfect for observing the sky.
Arabelle's words were only answered with a smile by Draco. He didn't want to give false hope to the innocent, naive young woman.
"It wasn't this bright earlier..." Draco grumbled as he used his hand to block the sunlight from hitting his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You think I'm stupid?" Harry's voice sharpened, as sharp as his stare. "You are my most experienced bodyguard. There is no way that boy can trick you unless you really let yourself be tricked."
When he got to the front of the campus building, Draco paid for his taxi and brought his guitar. In ten minutes, the class was about to start, but Draco ran to the toilet before heading to class. Harry really pissed him off. He seemed to want to share his sadness with Draco, and Draco could feel the sadness. Draco also didn't know why.
Draco bit his pale lower lip. He couldn't possibly be drying his clothes when the sun was no longer showing itself. Frustrated, he decided to sit by the river.
»»———————————————««
Long time no see, guys. I mean, long time no see, especially for this fic. It's been three months, huh? Sorry for making you wait for so long.
"You won't be able to run away," threatened Alden, shouting from inside. "Master Harry will definitely find you, and I swear, if you upset master Harry, you will regret it." Alden's shouts grew louder, accompanied by his banging on the door.
"Maybe he does look at all the women like that."
Harry bit his lower lip as he looked back at the blond next to him.
"I am a woman!" Attica growled.
Harry smiled for a moment and shifted his seat, getting closer to the blond.
Draco was stunned by what Doctor Jason said. "What?"
"You want to go out, huh?" Harry gripped Draco's arm again, in the same place that Draco felt his arm would bruise later. "Let me take you out!"
Draco made his signature rosemary roast chicken. The prince was assisted by several Satyrs who had been busy catching dozens of wild chickens and slaughtering them since this morning. Draco seasoned the chickens with spices and sea salt, then roast them in a traditional stone oven with lemon, onion, and a handful of Mediterranean herbs. Draco served it with spiced mashed potatoes. The residents of Ares' palace were not used to chicken dishes. They usually eat red meat such as deer, wild boar, or beef.
Draco looked at Harry as the Alpha walking away. The Omega bit his lower lip a little hard, suddenly overcome with guilt. Draco was lucky that Harry wasn't interested in punishing him—Draco's refusing to ask Harry was against Alpha's orders.
Draco narrowed his eyes again. What was Potter doing in the emergency room yesterday?
When the door to his room was opened from the outside, Draco had no idea that Harry was the one who entered. That man had utterly ignored him lately. Draco hardly even saw the man, except the scene when Harry entered his car on the lower terrace visible from the second-floor window where Draco was locked up.
Draco groaned. He could hear Harry’s breath above him, could feel Harry’s fingers digging into the flesh of his thighs, could feel the movement of the man’s cock inside of him. As Darco slowly came back to earth, his hand unconsciously moved to his cock, not surprised that he was hard again even though he had come so many times. He moaned as he felt Harry hitting his sweet spots; the feeling felt fresh again after he took some rest.
Silence returned.
The girl looked very annoyed but did not immediately reply. She had never been slapped back like that before. She was unprepared. Draco was pleased to see the lost expression of his nosy sister. He continued on his way. This time he had a goal. He no longer wanted to wander around the palace, wasting time. In less than a week, he would be sacrificed to the god Ares. Draco felt the need to understand his current situation better.
Harry immediately cast a disapproving glare at the young man in front of him, who was openly praising Draco in front of his husband himself.
"Stop! Don't come near me!" Draco unconsciously gripped his chest in a protective motion. Harry had forced his volition on him before, the bruise on his hands still aching, the scar of the harsh tie on his wrists.
"Finally, we can be together."
"Sorry, we forgot you're not a woman," Argus raised his hand and shook his head.
"Not master Harry's mother," Alden seemed to be able to read Draco's mind. "Mrs. Seraphina Potter is master Harry's late wife."
Hagrid, who was opening the cloth covering Draco's furniture, turned his head. "I also don't know why. I tried to open it before, but it still can't. Only two rooms can't be opened. The other is upstairs."
"M-Master..." A maid spoke.
Draco's mind was spinning…it seemed impossible. But if he doesn't try it, he won't know. As expected, the room's door opened, and Draco sat straight up in alert, waiting for whoever would enter. Alden appeared carrying a tray of food, his face as flat as ever.
Logic forced her to let Draco go. She didn't want the prince to be the victim of a misdirection. His legs were a little weak when he was about to run. After all, Troya was a prince who has never exercised strenuously. Draco was reluctant to return to Sparta. Though he also hesitated to follow the envoy. From the start, he had decided to accept whatever his destiny was.
"For the great Zeus! Thank goodness, Troya!" Not yet finished bursting out with nausea, suddenly several people appeared in the room. One of them approached him, then hugged and stroked his head.
He raised Draco's hand high and gently twirled the blonde so he could switch partners. Everything was fine at first until Harry's eyes caught the Delion Kingdom's crown prince, who seemed to be waiting for Draco's slender waist to fall into his hands.
"I sent him to hell," said Harry.
"Why do you look happy? You also want to kill me?" Draco asked irritably, but his voice sounded a little hoarse.
"Shut up! Your presence beside Draco will only keep him from enjoying the fresh air." cut Cedric quickly.
The royal concubine sitting and waiting for Draco rose when she saw Draco walking towards her. A smile graced the concubine's lips.
Was it because he had been secluded by his father all his life? Was that why his behavior was a little unique and often confused him?
"Aren't you thinking of doing the same?" Cedric asked, stepping forward.
The War God smiled faintly. "Unfortunately, I can't do that. If the humans disobey, my job is to punish them," He said.
"What happened to you, Arabelle?" Harry frowned in confusion when he saw Arabelle now hiding her face in Harry's chest while wailing in tears.
But meeting this certain blond was not what Harry expected at all.
His father's words managed to make Draco's confidence began to waver. He began to worry about himself having to follow his principles or himself having to defend his ambitions.
Draco had always loved the planetarium during his school days. It was one of those places where he could lay down, looking up at the ceiling and watch the stars move and the fantastic and lifelike animations of the sky. He didn't feel sleepy even though the narrator explained it in a flat tone. To be honest, he wasn't listening either, and he was just interested in the projection. He was busy from a young age and felt he found peace there even though he was there for his science assignment.
The Titans glanced at each other and looked a little uncomfortable. At that time, their horses stepped slowly because they passed through a rocky shallow river to discuss various things. But when the prince of Sparta began to ask questions about their god, the atmosphere turned silent.
With one sentence, Draco made Pansy and Blaise freeze suddenly. Even the silence of the night was surprised to hear that. "WHAT?!" they shouted at the same time.
Water dripped drop by drop and then spilled in great numbers from above the very gloomy sky. In an instant, the drizzle had turned into a small storm.
Ron's expression brightened slightly. "You must have received an invitation from Hufflepuff, haven't you? I'm here to confirm whether or not you want to come to the event tomorrow night."
"Take care of him," Harry ordered quickly, then his attention was completely focused on Draco. As if he didn't care about his palm cut deeply, Harry untied Draco's hands, and the young man immediately fell into his embrace.
Harry frowned at him carefully, then his long fingers suddenly stretched out and pulled Draco's chin closer so that he could observe Draco's face closely. "I've never seen your face here before."
"Ron," Hermione muttered softly, her cheeks flushed red, looking timid at Ron's blatant affection.
Doctor Jason's face flushed with embarrassment. He looked sorry he had said those words. "Ah, I'm sorry Draco, forget it that I said something like that."
"Hold on to me, and don't move. I'll drop you off to a quieter place," said the man.
Draco glanced at Harry, who was still wearing a flat expression. Then Draco raised his hand. "I'm sure they have charming faces like angels, and maybe with a little trickery that the devil has," he said.
"Do you live here, Draco?" Greyson asked.
"You're not safe here, Draco." Harry ruffled his hair in frustration. "No one has ever seen Hyde, and no one knows whether he's men or women. He can be anyone. Even now, I can't trust my own bodyguards, except Alden. Your situation here is very risky. In my house, you will be safe." Harry watched Draco pensively. "I think you're healthy enough to go home. Tonight I'll take care of your return from this hospital."
Draco's heart was beating twice as fast as he realized the meaning of his string of words a few seconds ago. It wasn't that he was blushing. Instead, there was a feeling of irritability in his mind—sourced from his common sense. Let's say this man in front of Draco is the ruler of all things, but apparently, he's not very good at controlling his own thoughts.
"Why do you say that, Prince?"
"I'll take care of myself," he told Icarus.
As someone who had never been in love, of course, Draco was curious about that feeling. The feeling that his father had suppressed from him for so long. A feeling that his father considered useless trash.
Hadreda did ensure that he would be fine on Olympus as long as he pleases Ares and tries to make friends with the residents. Hadreda invites him to join in watching the soldiers sparring or touring Ares palace. Hadreda introduced him to a lot of people, and that helped Draco adapt.
Harry put on his coat and turned to Alden, who was waiting for him by the door. "What about that last case? Have you taken care of them?"
"Would you like to rest first, Prince Troya? The horse can be tiring for an inexperienced person like you," Alastair offered kindly.
Draco, who had studied pharmacy in one of his roles as an actor and was interested in the herbal lifestyle, could recognize some of the spices that Eros had just harvested.
"They... The maids... They didn't say that the dandelion garden at the end of the palace contained many caterpillars. They... They also laughed at me when I showed my legs..." Arabelle explained in the middle her cry.
"Woah, this is so beautiful, Your Majesty!" the sound of Arabelle's shriek that was now beside him suddenly startled Draco. Despite his surprise, Draco didn't give Arabelle an annoyed expression.
No, Arabelle wouldn't do that. She didn't want to destroy the people she currently cares about because of herself.
"Why don't you let me go? I'm sick of being your prisoner."
Ron crossed his arms over his chest. "That's because you turned down all the candidates I tried to suggest to you, and if you keep refusing, you won't get a partner to go with."
"Watch what you say! Do you want to lose your head tonight?!" Harry shouted resoundingly.
Draco sighed bitterly. For Draco, their family was happy, even though his mother was a sickly weak woman, but other than that, she was the perfect mother.
"You really are an immoral devil, taking advantage of someone who hates you so much!" Draco hissed in anger, still not wanting to look at Harry. He was sick of seeing the face of that monster.
Harry looked at Draco sharply. "What do you mean?"
Harry wasn't following him, but Draco was sure that soon Harry would follow him. And sure enough, Harry was suddenly behind Draco.
"Better to wait two years than two thousand years." Harry then walked to the couch in the middle of the room and sat down casually.
The man let go of Draco's hand. "I'm Icarus Prometheus, son of Daedalus." He bowed slightly to introduce himself.
"I just want to get away from you, why don't you let me go?!" this time Draco screamed in frustration. "I beg you. I'm sick of being here. I..."
"How was your visit to Delion?" asked Lucius, looking at Draco, who managed to show his relaxed face.
Did the producers put something in his drink? Maybe some kind of drug or psychiatric drug that creates delusions and messes up his speech? That's what Draco thought.
"I'll see you later, Luna. I have to work." Draco took his bag and left Luna in the cafe. Harry followed behind him, walking out of the building.
"No need," Before they left the dining hall, several Satyrs looked anxious, trying to talk to Ares. It seems like a guest had arrived late. "What now?" Ares asked impatiently.
His eyes suddenly stopped on a doll lying helplessly under the bed, an old doll in Doraemon form, the blue cat robot. With trembling hands, Draco grabbed the tiny doll, looking closely.
"Cheers!" answered the guests in the ballroom.
Draco immediately withdrew his hand in panic. Will Harry, in his dream, turn into wicked Harry again in the real world? Apparently not, Harry, in this dream, is very gentle and full of kindness. The man took Draco's finger and put it back on his cheek.
Revised:
He shoved the tip of his sword at the bull, trying to get him to move first. The monster rubbed its hind legs as if taking a stance. Then it shot towards Ares with three pointed horns aimed at his heart. Ares quickly dodged. His alert and trained eyes immediately plunged the tip of his sword into the bull's neck deeply.
The red stain on the bed bothered him so much that Draco violently grabbed the sheets and slammed them on the floor. His breath was heaving, and then his body collapsed to the floor, crying with emotion. Draco's memories drifted to his father and mother, to his unanswered hatred, and his fate to be trapped here in the clutches of his great enemy. Now he was slumped here, in Harry's grasps, and what the worst is, he was helpless against that man.
Harry opened the door of the room where Draco was slowly locked. It was late at night, and Harry did not expect Draco to wake up. The room was dark and dim, but Harry's eyes caught the tray of food that was still intact, only his drink was gone.
Draco let out a choked gasp, his head hitting the tiled wall harshly. His pants and cries filled up the room as Harry continued probing his prostate sadistically. Without warning, Draco came again, his legs trembling. If it weren’t for Harry supporting him, he would have fallen. Not discouraged, Harry continued to plunder Draco’s prostate with his finger and tongue.
were you and me?”
Ah, even in that dream, Draco could clearly feel Harry's gentle kiss on his forehead before that man left.
"So what? That dress is specially ordered for you,” this time, Harry growled a little, holding back his patience.
"I know… I once read it in a book. A creature like him wouldn't fall in love, but what if it were different?" asked Luna.
Rumors have been saying that he was secluded and timid. But now Troya knows and laughs with his soldiers at dinner. He was telling jokes that caused laughter without diminishing his princely grace. Ares could see that the palace dwellers liked him. The Prince of Sparta was probably his only lover to receive that treatment. They often hated lovers of the War God, including Aphrodite.
Draco silently prayed. Sadly, it seemed that God still wanted Harry alive because the man seemed uninterested in touching his drink. Instead, his eyes fell on Draco and glared at him.
"God Eros, you mentioned Ambrosia earlier?" Draco asked. Eros seemed friendly enough that Draco didn't hesitate to ask.
A second later, both Draco and Arabelle returned to focus on their respective embroidery activities. Arabelle looked so sloppy when embroidered because Draco could hear a small whimper that escaped the girl's lips as the needle pricked her finger.
Charles wanted to curse his nervousness. This was the first time Charles had felt nervous while dancing with someone. Take notes, dance! Oh, God! They don't even hug!
"I can't see him," whispered Luna carefully.
The problem was that the Gods of Olympus didn't seem to know what self-respect and decency were. Especially for matters relating to love and marriage. It was useless if Draco made a fuss because they wouldn't care. Draco decides to accept the unfair relationship between Aphrodite and Ares and act casually so that the God of War would not easily throw him away.
"Are you all right?" Draco asked Icarus.
The King considered. He was reluctant to let his son marry. The King imagined Troya as Goddess Artemis, who was always divine and calmed his heart. He couldn't think of having his son, who behaved gently and beautifully touched by another man. Therefore the King rejected all the envoys who came to propose to Troya. He intends to keep Troya forever in his palace as an antidote to his sadness and calm when upset because of country problems.
For some reason, Draco felt that resting at times like this was inappropriate. Had they continued their journey, they would have been able to reach the royal capital of Delion in just 3 hours. Draco was sure their group would be able to endure hunger for 3 hours.
"Why should you feel inferior, Aphrodite? You will forever be the most beautiful on earth." He seduces again.
"You haven't answered my question, Seraphim." Harry turned and looked at Draco, who was thinking. "What are you?" he asked.
Ares didn't want to wait for Troya to answer. He took his hand gently and started it with a kiss on the forehead, which continued to the cheek near his right eye. Draco closed his eyes, and Ares gave his virgin lips a soft kiss.
Unexpectedly, Draco doesn't have a morning class tomorrow. So he can do other work besides maintaining a bookstore. His mother worked in a restaurant as a chef, her cooking was always delicious, and Draco never doubted it. But, he didn't want his mother to work too hard to pay for his college tuition. So Draco worked in three places at once so he could pay for it himself.
"Save me," The Satyr groaned.
"He is in pain, and you know that," growled Harry furiously.
Inside the carriage, it was very quiet. Draco was busy staring blankly at the view behind the window, while Arabelle was busy staring at perfect-looking Draco. Even when the blonde did nothing, an aura of elegance and intelligence always radiated from him.
Even though this time, Draco was wearing a crown that was smaller in size than the royal crown that remained on their kingdom, it didn't prevent Draco's powerful and elegant aura.
wife has the principle of not wanting to conceive from a man he doesn't love." mocked Lucius as he slowly walked around Draco's stiffened body.
Quickly, Draco rose from his seat. He immediately bowed for a longer time than usual, a sign that he was expressing his apology.
"Since you said that I made you uncomfortable, I just—"
A rule required all commoners not to make eye contact with the Emperor and his family when they were not on a special occasion.
"Isn't Cho Chang very lucky to be that close to Potter?" said Pansy in a whisper. She was only joking, but her serious tone forced Draco to take it seriously too.
"It's okay, I'm here now," said Harry, gently pulled the girl into his arms.
Harry raised his wounded hand to caress Draco's long hair, and Draco immediately remembered the incident when Harry quickly grabbed the knife, preventing Draco from getting hurt. Draco trembling unconsciously with terror.
Draco nodded confidently.
"Ah, I know! I have a brilliant idea," said Ron excitedly for three seconds, but then he fell silent again and shook his head as he reconsidered the idea he was about to convey.
"How do you know about that?" Luna asked curiously.
"Don't cry,"
"I thought the cab was empty," he said to the driver.
He's still scared. This was all too strange for him. He's definitely not Troya, yet everyone calls him
Like Luna, she is a fairy. Her sweet face and fair skin showed how suitable she was to be a fairy. She is one of the royal fairies. Both her parents held the southern fairy kingdom. But Luna said, to be able to live among humans, they also have to mingle with humans. That's why Luna was going to college.
Draco looked at several royal guards in silence. They were busy practicing their swords. He looked at the sight with admiration. Perhaps this was one of Draco's many advantages because he was the queen of this kingdom. Draco didn't need to ask anyone's permission to enter the training ground.
"I... I didn't mean it like that, Your Majesty... I was just joking," The old man stammered.
"Do you agree with my idea?" asked Ron.
Currently, Harry and his mistress, Arabelle, were traveling. They wanted to spend their last day in the Delion Kingdom looking at the jewelry in the market. Like a couple, Cedric also decided to spend their last day in the Delion Kingdom traveling with Draco.
"What? Don't gods and goddesses always work miracles with their magic? Why do they resist the magic?" Draco was confused. How about a vulture turning giant? Wasn't that magic?
"I haven't tried it yet, but I know how it will turn out. I don't want the feeling to drive me crazy. I'm afraid that feeling will make me forget who I am."
"What did you see?" asked Harry curiously.
The man looked confused now. "What are you? How can you see me when I'm wearing my glamour?"
"All you have to think about now is, you will also meet Aphrodite later. My advice, try to dress more modestly. She won't like it when someone is younger and prettier than her," Eros said half-jokingly.
"Oh, Dray, if you're jealous, just tell us," Pansy whispered, chuckling slightly as she watched Draco, who had only been twirling his spoon until he didn't realize half of the soup had been scattered on the table.
Draco watched Harry, who still had a flat face, approached him. Draco gasped for breath. "What did you do to him?" he asked haltingly, trying to calm his beating heart because of running.
"Uh... Harry... everyone can see us!" whispered Arabelle frantically with her eyes moving around to make sure that there really wasn't anyone else in the garden.
"This is my first marriage, Goddess Hera. At least I want to do it in a civilized way." Ares confirmed his stance. Goddess Hera arrived late, dinner had just finished, but the guests knowingly dispersed. They noticed Goddess Hera that came with angry faces. Ares' followers had returned to their residences.
Several people then laughed as someone refuted Draco's answer. "Have you seen them?" he asked with a laugh.
Harry, my son, just admit *cough* that you have feelings for my baby Draco xD
"That's right, Troya. I hope you won't think of me too badly. I married you for fun. From what I hear, it seems I have freed you from your father's restraints. Isn't this a good thing?" Ares was still holding the prince's hand and walked around his palace.
“That's because you threatened me!!” Draco's hissed in anger. "Now I'm back in my right mind."
"Draco," called someone from behind when Draco just got up from his chair.
Meanwhile, hundreds of the best Spartan soldiers now surrounded the envoys. They didn't allow Alastair to take the prince away.
Draco turned his head to find Harry, who was folding his arms across his chest. "I thought this is for me, and you don't eat the food of mortals anyway," he said sarcastically. Considering that the man once taunted Draco as 'mortal', now Draco is taking his revenge.
Draco Malfoy must feel to his knees!
"Mr. Draco has a high fever and low blood pressure. It seems that it is the result of fatigue. But don't worry, he will be fine. I suggest not allowing him to do strenuous activities and rest for a few days." The senior doctor sighed softly. "If his condition worsens, Mr. Draco must be rushed to the hospital." He added.
"I have to go." Ares got up from the bed and adjusted his clothes.
Ginny's screams followed by a groan of pain loomed over his head. Even though it's been a year since the tragedy, but the sensation is as if it happened yesterday. In Harry's memory, it was clearly etched how Ginny's bloodied face with her head leaned against the windshield that shattered pieces had disfigured. Ginny's brown nettle stared at Harry blankly as her life force was slowly being pulled out of her body. And Harry couldn't do anything to save her.
Draco shook his head. "I'm talking to myself. I mean with my imaginary friends, nowadays my imaginary friends often appear suddenly," he replied.
Draco stared at the scene before him in panic. "You... What are you doing?!"
Both of Draco's eyes were still wide open, while tears were already streaming down his rosy cheeks. He should have realized that he could do nothing to break free from the War God's obsession and also from their destiny. No, he won't be able to break free from Ares, who wants him.
When Troya recovered, instead of being happy, he was sad because the King had already promised.
Slowly, Draco opens his eyes, waking up to the sound of birds chirping. He gathered his consciousness, then wake up and sat on a large white bed. Draco's mind wandered. He tried to remember the reason why he could be in this room. Instantly a flash of memory crossed his mind.
Harry immediately shook his head firmly upon hearing the place slide out of Ron's lips. "No. Somewhere else sounds better." After all, Harry also did not want to get a temporary replacement partner who was careless and haphazard.
, Draco muttered to himself. Feeling annoyed because he couldn't help but admit the truth that was plastered in front of him.
Draco saw how one by one, the guards left the battle area. Draco was hopeful when he saw Cedric stride so valiantly into the middle of the area while carrying his sword that sparkling.
Draco's cheeks flushed even more, mostly when his eyes were swept across Harry's hardened cock. It was clear that the man was very, very aroused.
Draco was still stunned in bed, then a flash of pain in his buttocks brought him to life. The bloodstain was striking on the white sheet, seeming to laugh at him. How ironic, his virginity was snatched away by the devil-hearted bastard he wanted to kill. Draco's body trembled, filled with a choking mix of feelings as he tried to stand up.
"Why do you say that? You haven't even tried it yet," said Cedric with a delicate frown that had graced his forehead.
"Zeus is thinking of stepping down from his position and choosing one of his children to replace him for leading the Titans," Hera said again a little quietly. It was indeed not information that could be easily shared with anyone. Hera shouldn't even talk about it.
Abaddon comes from Hebrew and in Greek is Apollyon, which means the Angel of the Abyss as recorded in the Book of Revelation to John chapter 9; The king who rules them is the angel of the abyss; its name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon.
Harry's eyes scanned the entirety of his wife's room. Draco's room was the complete opposite of Arabelle's. Draco's room was white and gold to highlight the elegance, while Arabelle's room was decorated with teenage pink.

Draco closed his eyes for a moment, his hand still moving on top of his stomach.
Draco's heart was beating fast, his back stiffened. He didn't want to lose his position.
The Gods went to the women they liked and made them lovers. Women who gave birth to divine offspring were usually not despised. Although born from illegitimate relationships, many demigods could become kings, queens, or war heroes.
"Mr. Draco?" This time, a familiar voice greeted him. Draco turned and saw Alden standing staring at him. The man just got out of the elevator. "What are you doing here?"
Alastair raised his right hand, and a vulture was seen flying from behind Ares' group. The bird then landed right in front of Draco. Alastair feeds it a purple strawberry-like fruit. The vulture chewed it in one swallow.
Draco tried to pull down his short, black skirt, which was starting to feel uncomfortable. This waitress's uniform was extremely painful; with his cleavage so low and the dress so short, it was as if Draco was forced to disguise himself as someone he didn't know. But wasn't that the point? He didn't want that man to know him, even though that seemed nothing to be afraid of.
"I'm not sure if you're alone here. This forest is too far from the royal palace. Are you with Prince Ced—"
Draco closed his lips tightly. He didn't want to answer the question Cedric had just said in a frustrated tone. He couldn't possibly tell the man that Draco's father had carefully planned the direction of Draco's life all this time.
Blaise fell silent for a long time, digesting Pansy's simple explanation, which he had difficulty understanding. Pansy even went so far as to explain some other evidence so that Blaise quickly got to the point.
"My lover, Aphrodite... Why should you be angry? You know that I always come back to you." Ares seduced the goddess, showing his servitude.
Harry's eyes darkened as if a storm was about to hit. "Why don't you wear your dress?" Harry hissed softly.
"Also, I heard Aphrodite will also be staying for the night."
In modern times, people call it a planetarium. Often people don't actually observe the stars there. It was just a building that usually had a futuristic design with a large dome on the roof. On the dome, there was a projector that would display a near-real picture of a view of the Milky Way galaxy or its constellations of stars and planets.
"Hmm, not from there. At night you can see it,"
"We're about to enter Olympus!" Alastair exclaimed and immediately forced all of them to return to focus on their goal.
Draco thought sadly.
Before Harry actually burst out laughing and woke Draco up, he put the book back where it belonged. Then, Harry stepped out of Draco's room with a faint smile.
"I'm not waiting for you. I'm just relaxing," Ares replied coldly.
Draco sneered. "Why should I be nervous?" he retorted in annoyance and walked forward, standing right next to Harry. Just to prove that he wasn't nervous.
"So... What?"
Charles's heart raced as he felt a tinge of concern linger in every word that came out of the Empress' lips. Was this what it feels like to be worried by someone you really admire?
"Daddy..." Draco whined.
Draco couldn't help but smile. Ron looked more annoyed at being forced to come home late than at not seeing Harry.
A hug woke Draco from his reverie. The beautiful blonde turned his head and found his husband behind him.
"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm used to dealing with lovers with a slightly different character than you. I must remember that you are shy," Alastair nodded.
