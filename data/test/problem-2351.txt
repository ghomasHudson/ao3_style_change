“Won't be a second, Zach,” Harry called as he left the room. “I'll wait for Draco's call and then we'll head to the pub.”
Seamus had come over from Ireland for a visit, and after being assured that a thirty-something divorced father of three wasn't going to look out of place, Harry allowed himself to be dragged to a club.
“Okay,” Draco said, slowly closing his book, “what? Do I have something on my face or something? Oi, Harry!”
“Which, correct me if I'm wrong,” Crookshanks said, towering over Mrs Norris, who skittered back a few inches, “is their
“Ooh!” Ginny was practically rubbing her hands together in glee. “Do tell. I'd love to know what poor Harry has to put up with.”
“This one is much better,” Harry said, removing it from the box and putting it in Bartholomew's place. “I bought it for Arthur, but I'll get him a new one.”
“Thank you,” the bloodied man muttered before the newly-arrived ambulance men pushed Harry and Draco aside.
. I was going to my presentation and I was going to wow the wizarding world with that new Floo powder and that was the end of it.
Harry nodded and, for the first time in months, he felt like crying. His supposed friend—someone he'd trusted—had set out, and managed, to destroy the best thing in Harry's life.
“Whatever it is,” Harry said, cuddling up to me as gently as possible. “People think we're invincible now.”
Ron didn't know exactly how it had happened, but he found himself, without meaning to, emigrating to Australia.
“Don't 'Kings' me, Harry. You're still calling each other by your surnames, for Merlin's sake. I don't care how many crimes you solve together, you're doing this or you're off the force. Both of you. You
But, as Ron told her about his evening spent with Harry, his posture and his voice getting harder by the second, her 'um's and 'ah's turned into actual words of support and agreement. She had had more than enough of seeing—and hearing about—Draco bloody Malfoy.
If Harry had had to guess who it could have been crashing about, Malfoy would have been right at the bottom of the list. But there he was, sitting at Harry's kitchen table, drinking Harry's tea and, worse of all, eating Harry's Rich Tea biscuits. He'd been bloody saving them!
Harry left the hospital and walked home in a daze. So many feelings battled inside him: embarrassment, confusion, hurt,
“I'm so glad you wrote. I've been so worried about you. And me, I suppose. I am so so sorry. So sorry.”
One thing Dog knew that Draco took a lot of pride in was the ribbon he artfully draped around the tree. Dog's favourite—the sparkly tinsel—was always left to adorn the banister in the hallway while Draco's (bland, if you asked Dog) ribbon had pride of place on the tree.
As he finished speaking, he flipped them so that Draco lay sprawled under him, and reached into the bedside drawer for his favourite oil. He knocked off the lid with his thumb and Draco sniffed the air.
The news that Harry Potter had opened a café had spread like wildfire throughout the wizarding world. Witches and wizards had come from miles around to be served tea by him. Harry had never expected so many customers; he had assumed it would have been just as it was when he was a customer—some shoppers needing a rest and maybe a few regulars. He was very very wrong. As a consequence, he now counted Pansy Parkinson as his most treasured employee, and a very close friend.
In an attempt to stem the flow of hate, Harry sent a letter to the editor of the Prophet. Surprisingly, it actually worked. That might have had something to do with Granger's addition of an opening paragraph stating that the letter would be the only correspondence they would ever receive from Harry if they didn't comply with its contents, and Pansy's ending of, what amounted to, 'Fuck off and leave us alone'.
Harry had been eighteen when he had last seen Draco, and back then he hadn't given a second thought as to
Ron balled his fists and growled. “HULK SMASH! Awesome. Right, love?” he added, looking at Hermione.
“But,” Draco said, patting Harry's arm, “if it wasn't for Howard Stark, your beloved Captain America would still be at the bottom of the ocean.”
Deciding that he'd rather be early than sit about in his house waiting, Harry threw on his best cloak and left the house. The pub they were meeting in wasn't far from his house, so Harry walked instead of Apparating. As he predicted, he was very early. To his surprise, as he walked into the pub, he spotted Draco already sitting at the bar, sipping a glass of whisky. Steeling his nerves, Harry walked towards him.
For the first time since he'd started work at the hospital, Harry was nervous about going into work on Monday morning. The rest of his weekend had passed without incident. He'd had a lovely day at Molly and Arthur's on Sunday with the rest of the family, having one of Molly's huge Sunday dinners. She'd quizzed him, as she did every week, on when he was going to find himself a 'young man and settle down'. Molly assured him, as she did every week, that if Ginny could do it, so could he.
“I did go and find Hermione and led her to them,” Crookshanks added. “She broke it up pretty quickly.”
“Today, I'd like to continue our discussion of why the two of you can't get along. I think you'll both agree that since you've been here at Holding Hands, you haven't seemed to have argued much.”
Harry nearly choked on his drink and Malfoy shot him a worried look. Harry wiped his mouth and bit down the laugh that was bubbling inside him.
At one time, Harry couldn't have imagined turning twenty, never mind thirty, and he was understandably shocked one morning to realise that he was indeed nearing the big three-oh. Ron, Hermione and the rest of his friends—bar Ginny and Luna, of course—had already celebrated their birthdays—and in some style, Harry thought. But Harry didn't want any of it. A small dinner with pre-arranged presents, Harry had insisted, but deep down he knew. He knew what they were bloody planning something.
“My house,” Harry said, quickly holding his hand up and fighting down a blush as Draco raised an eyebrow at his words. “No. I’ll cook.”
I caught sight of Harry, a white-faced, distraught looking Harry, running towards me, also with his wand out. I didn't have time to feel relief at the sight of him, as I heard the cloaked man shouting “AVADA KEDAVRA!” and I flew backwards before the world went black.
Harry laughed in relief that Draco had remembered, before the realisation of what Draco actually said sunk in.
Draco started with his jacket, slipping it off his shoulders and letting it drop to the floor. At the first sight of Draco's arms, covered only by the thin material of his shirt, Harry's cock gave a twitch. If there was one thing Harry found attractive on a man, it was his arms. Well built, but not too muscular, arms were definitely his downfall.
see you; I couldn't talk about you. It physically hurt when I thought about it. I don't know what made me believe it. It was just there, in my mind, replaying over and over.”
Harry was cold. He and Draco were huddled behind some bushes, outside the front of the hotel under Disillusionment Charms and Harry's Warming Charm had worn off some time ago. The Muggle policemen milling around made it impossible for him to renew the charm, so Harry simply sidled ever so closer to Draco to steal his warmth.
It had all started months earlier—not long after the end of the war—when Hermione decided that it was time for her parents to come home. He and Hermione had travelled—taking no less than seven floos—to the other side of the world; Hermione eager to see her parents' memories restored, and Ron thinking of a nice holiday.
Draco was relieved to see Glinda in the small room they were sent to for their session. Not that he particularly relished the idea of therapy, but he was even less enthused by the idea of talking to someone he didn't know.
“I always found you attractive; I'm not blind. It's just this afternoon, I realised that I wanted to be with you. And not just in a sexual way. But you're supposed to be talking. What was with all the animosity?”
“You know what? Forget I said anything. I didn't say anything. Oh crap...” Potter buried his face in his hands.
“Harry, relax!” Malfoy reached over and took Harry's hand in his own. “No one is hurt or anything. This is definitely not going the way I thought it would. Although, I don't know how I thought it would go like, to be honest.”
Harry hummed a tune while he unlocked the shop and got ready for the day. Harry loved Monday mornings. He was well aware that he was probably on his own, but Harry loved his job and couldn't wait to get back to it after the weekend. Having quit Auror training before it had even started, Harry had started his business by accident.
Draco definitely detected a hint of an insult in that, but he ignored it. “I found it on one of my trips to Toys R Us; it's a lot of fun.” Draco tugged on his hand again. “Come on; we're blocking the door.”
On arriving at the dining room, Draco realised that he and Harry weren't the only ones with the same plan. Ten and One were already waiting at the doors, and the rest of the guests weren't far behind. When the dinner chime sounded, the doors opened and ten hungry people ran straight for the chips.
The trouble really started a few weeks later at breakfast, with the arrival of the morning post. In retrospect, we should have expected something to happen much sooner, but we were too busy enjoying ourselves.
Draco smiled and moved closer. Their lips touched and before Harry could think, Draco's tongue slid silkily against his own. Harry had never felt anything like it. His nervousness from earlier disappeared as his hands slid into Draco's hair, pulling him even closer. Harry was lost. He clung desperately to Draco as they kissed, small moans coming from both of them as they almost climbed into one another's laps.
Harry. And, Merlin, was he shocked when he realised it. Even with their little outburst in therapy, Draco missed him dreadfully. He wanted to laugh with Harry at his teammates' expense. He wanted to do the stupid treasure hunt—and win the bloody thing—with Harry. For fuck's sake, he wanted to hold Harry's hand.
“Hi, everyone!” Hermione greeted as she and Ron joined their group. “I'm guessing Harry has seen the
Harry laughed and resisted the urge to drag Draco back into the dressing room. He'd certainly found the passion he'd been looking for with Draco. Instead, Harry took Draco's hand and tugged him gently towards the aisle.
“It’s barely quarter past eight,” Harry explained, confused. “I’ve never seen you before nine. The shop isn’t even open!”
But Kingsley's eyes weren't dropping and his mouth was still moving. Draco would usually be having a nice cup of tea by now, bemoaning his lack of a decent partner with Cheryl at the front desk, but Kingsley was still wittering on. Stranger still, Potter had started talking as well—a rare occurrence after his initial pleas for a change would be dismissed. It wasn't his usual ranting, either; it was his panicked trying-to-talk-himself-out-of-something spiel.
Harry laughed and accepted the kiss from his daughter. She was very much a miniature version of her mother.
“No, no,” Potter said, obviously noticing my distress. “It's just...” He stood back, gesturing to his now-bare legs. “Could you please cancel the jinx?”
“He was weak!” Harry said, jumping from his seat, and only calming once Draco placed his hand on Harry's arm.
I'd only just realised that I might like him and then he springs that on me. I needed a minute. It was all happening much too quickly. “Oh.”
“Yes,” Harry finally said, fiddling with his bow tie again. Seriously, puce? How is that even a colour? “Can you talk about something not wedding related, please?”
“Of course,” Draco said, picking another drink up from the tray. “I have a thing for dark-haired, green-eyed, tea shop owners.”
“You have ninety minutes to figure out your best chance of winning. The only rule is that your egg has to be safely transported for as long as your vehicle is in motion. The pair that has the vehicle that goes the furthest—” Barry gestured to the measurements marked out on the floor. “—wins a little prize. Have fun, and remember: work together!”
Bob tenderly placed a tentacle around Arnold's body to protect him as the rest of BAHAHAHAH ran, hopped or flew at full pelt towards the castle.
. He knew Draco. He knew that he wasn't a bad person. He knew that he sometimes acted without thinking.
The letters started not long after we moved in together. At first, I assumed they were a prank and ignored them; I didn't even bother mention them to Harry until the third one arrived. First, it was one, every six weeks, like clockwork. Then it was monthly, every first of the month, all saying basically the same thing (put in simple terms): I didn't deserve my life and should be ready to lose it.
It took a few weeks of me finding you at your table in the corner after Ron had gone home to Hermione and the kids. It took countless pints and me unceremoniously plopping myself down at your table before you would actually talk to me.
“Harry,” Hermione said, poking her head around the door. “Are you all right? Ron said you were panicking a bit.”
“We'll do the decorating stuff again,” Harry said. “Apparently, I haven't spent enough time with my boyfriend recently.” Harry winked at Draco. “And Zach? Don't forget to owl the
“What?” I couldn't believe what Weasley was telling me. I couldn't believe someone I knew, someone I spoke to daily could try to kill me. I'd bought her flowers on her birthday for Merlin's sake.
Harry didn’t pause. He released Draco’s cock, slid his fingers out and coated his own cock with the slippery oil. Giving Draco’s arse one last kiss, he lined his hard cock up with Draco’s ready hole.
They had, of course, tried to walk separately to the dining hall, but their hands would invariably reach out to take the other's. Alas, Draco found himself walking to lunch, hand-in-hand with Harry bloody P-Gitface.
Life returned to some semblance of normality for Harry. He opened the café in the morning, served the Hufflepufferish masses, closed up and went home. He sometimes had dinner with Ginny or Ron, Pansy had issued a standing invitation to her flat, and even Blaise had turned up with a takeaway and a bottle of wine more than once.
Plucking up courage I didn't know I possessed, I grabbed hold of Potter's arm before he could leave. “I think...”
“Oh, shut up, Darius. I think you two,” Hedwig said, pointing with her wing at Pig and Arnold, “should continue the observation while me and Darius—”
“I think I've had enough wine,” Draco said, standing up on shaky legs. “As a matter of fact, I think I need some
It was on one of their evenings together—after a few too many glasses of wine—that their simple friendship turned into something else altogether. And, as was usually the case, it was Harry's runaway mouth that started it.
“For how long?” Draco's colour was returning to normal, but he still looked ready to run away at a moment's notice.
shag you,” Harry clarified. “That would be, erm, nice. Really, really, really nice. But I've really enjoyed spending time with you and want it to continue.”
It was seeing the look or pure relief on my mother's face when she saw that I was all right. It was, despite all the deaths, despite the sheer exhaustion, seeing the small smiles on people's faces at it finally being over.
Harry looked at Draco and shrugged. Draco rolled his eyes and took hold of Harry's arm. “I'll do the Apparating, if you don't mind. We don't want a repeat of the warehouse fiasco.”
Neither Dog or Harry moved for a good couple of seconds after the box fell to the floor, the shiny glass shattering on impact.
Harry laughed as the grumpy waiter who had been serving them all week came towards them as soon as the words were out of his mouth, bottle in hand. The grumpy waiter—Harry thought he really should learn their names—carefully placed the bottle on the table and Draco snatched it up.
A round of murmurs and whispered words rose up in the room. Draco guessed that the afternoon had done more harm than good for some people. He and Harry stayed silent, both still on a high from their win.
But Harry couldn't get away from him. He was used to seeing Malfoy when they opened or closed their shops, he ran into him at lunch time in the local café, and he was never surprised to find himself sitting at the table next to Malfoy in the pub if he popped in for a pint on the way home.
Sure enough, before they'd finished pouring their juice—not a bottle of wine in sight, unfortunately—Ten and One had arrived and served themselves and Glinda was on her feet and talking to them again.
I was just leaving Gringotts when I spotted you at the other end of the alley, flanked, as always, by your friends and followed by a pack of journalists.
Yeah, right. Pity that horrid cat had even been invited to be a member. Darius could've quite gladly thrown her into the lake. She always looked like she could do with a good bath anyway.
His hungover brain was not providing any help so Harry carefully slipped out of the encircled arms and turned around. He had a moment of sheer horror when he realised just
After they'd ordered their food, Harry plucked a beer off of the tray and held it into the air. “What should we toast?”
Kingsley swished his wand, and the curtain disappeared. Harry was shocked. He apologised to Draco in his mind as he looked at the painting. If Harry was completely honest, he was expecting a painting of himself, and by the looks on many of the Ministry officials' faces, they were expecting to see the same.
Draco contemplated speaking up, but thought better of it. He simply wanted to get through this; he didn't want these people to know his business and, most of all, the small glimmer of hope was still bubbling under the surface. Maybe this
Harry looked about ready to hide in the wardrobe, so Draco quickly spoke up. “No, no, I just wondered
A loud cough brought their attention back to their friends. Harry was used to the fond looks he usually received from Hermione and Ginny after he and Draco showed affection in public, or the teasing winks he usually got from Pansy. Ron, Blaise and the other men of the group just didn't seem to care; they simply carried on their conversation. Harry was shocked to see the sheer look of disdain on Zach's face.
Harry gratefully accepted the glass offered to him and sat back to listen to Malfoy talk. If nothing else, it was a bloody good wine.
Draco poured them both fresh glasses and sat back in his chair. Harry could tell that he was actually interested in hearing what he had to say. Harry wasn't used to it.
“I want to keep this between us. It's quite hot, thinking of the world getting turned on by our escapades, but a small part of me wants to see Ron's face when he realises his mother has been doing the same.”
Harry nodded and Draco shrugged again, although he had absolutely no idea what she wanted him to say. Glinda smiled and Draco relaxed slightly.
Glinda looked at them and her smile had faltered. “Yes, and—” She brightened, nodded to the tiny elf and her grin returned. “—new rule. Only first names allowed. No surnames; we're all friends now. Please, everyone try to get what you need from this course; you're paying enough for it!”
So much fun, he didn't notice Harry smiling and grabbing his wand until the last second. Dropping the lamb in shock, Dog bounced back as Harry transfigured the entire scene into a Quidditch pitch, complete with flying players and balls.
You see, Harry had a secret. He was an author; he wasn't lying about that. And he will crank out the next instalment of what Draco affectionately called his 'children's sleep aids' that was his 'official' job. It's just not what made him happy. Or much money.
Christmas had been a bad time for Harry. He knew, from his friends, that Draco had returned to Britain for the week of Christmas, but he had stayed with his parents, and hadn't even visited London once.
Harry nodded, confused. He had been sure that the book-shaped bulge in Zach's jacket pocket was the shrunken copies he'd seen before. “No problem. I'll see you out.”
The nativity scene was the bane of Dog's—and Cat's—life. Every time anybody slammed the door, the shepherd would fall over and baby Jesus would roll onto the floor. Dog—or Cat—would then inevitably get told off by Draco for trying to eat the wooden doll. Dog had heard more than one argument between Harry and Draco about the bloody thing, but Draco always seemed to win out with 'it's tradition, Harry. Mother says so'.
Dog loved to watch while Draco put the sparkles up. He loved how passionate Draco was about the tree; how he was such a perfectionist about the placement of the sparkles. He loved the way Draco—hang on.
He was slightly out of breath by the time he reached the steps of Gringotts and Harry silently cursed his lack of exercise over the last few months. Harry took his time having his money converted. He didn't usually like to spend a lot of time with the goblins—they still hadn't forgiven him fully for the dragon—but as his only other option was facing the hoards he assumed were waiting for him outside, Harry made small talk with the goblin serving him and asked the dreaded question. There really was no other way; he couldn't go back out into that crowd.
“Although not many of them know that you once spent it handcuffed to a bed in a dingy flat in London after a date with a Muggle went awry. I had weeks of jokes out of that one.”
“Me too.” Draco had a sudden thought, and not knowing when he would get the chance again, rolled with it. “New question: when did you come out? And why wasn't it plastered all over the Prophet?”
Harry could barely lift his hand for a wave. Luck? Bloody hell, the way the Frenchman had been looking at Malfoy during Narcissa's party, he definitely didn't need any luck.
Ginny cut him off once more. “Now, we've seen you looking, and we've seen him looking. We've taken it upon ourselves to talk to him for you and we've here to do something about it.”
“Enough about that,” Ron said, his face colouring to match Harry's. “Can you please talk some sense into him? It was bad enough just hearing about her love life, now he has us spying on her.”
It was a magnificent morning, with the sun shining high and bright. There was barely a whisper of wind and all around people talked of nothing but the heat while fanning themselves with the neat little leaflets I'd had printed to accompany the presentation.
“That's not really necessary.” Harry tried, knowing it was probably futile as most of the table turned their attention to Pansy.
“It's brilliant!” Draco said, smiling wider than Dog had seen him in a while. “Teddy will love it.” He walked over to Harry and kissed him quickly. “It's perfect for his first Christmas with us.”
“Yeah, um, yes. They're very nice. What are you doing here? How did you get in here? I thought we were meeting at the pub? And leave me some biscuits, please.”
.” Harry was well aware he was rambling, but he couldn't seem to stop. “But how can we have a relationship without any trust?”
Draco wouldn't divulge anything from the future—consequences, he kept saying—but he did answer Harry's question of where he went when he wasn't with him. It was simple, Draco said. He had to go back home to go to work. Draco definitely wouldn't tell Harry anything about the Harry from the future, but he had had a sad look on his face when Harry had asked him, and Harry was too scared of the answer to push Draco on it.
“Thank you. Bob, fellow members, yes, we have the most marvellous news,” Darius said, pausing for dramatic effect. “Due to some rather great work and fantastic skills, I—”
Harry paled. He knew that cover. He'd chosen it himself. The crossed wands had made him laugh when he was presented with the options for his latest cover, so he'd picked it. And now it was there, out in the open, in his friend's hand.
one framed and pinned to the wall above the till. Pansy denied all knowledge, and Harry hadn't been able to remove the Sticking Charm.
“One in thirteen million, three hundred and sixty-five thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five,” Malfoy said with a straight face. “I looked it up: the chances of Harry Potter choosing the same Muggle holiday as me, in the same resort and the same week. And choosing the same lounger.”
“You're saying that all of our friends, the wizarding population and Molly bloody Weasley have read what is essentially our sex life, and no one knows you wrote it?”
Potter moved closer, and as soon as he uttered, “Sorry,” my wand was out and the little cranes were fluttering around his head. I blushed harder. It was automatic; it was instinctive.
Harry didn't know what he was doing as he and Draco moved forwards. He knew he couldn't draw his wand on the attackers, but he also knew that he couldn't just leave Grumpy Waiter to the thugs. Harry was well aware of the fact that he wasn't going to win a Muggle fistfight. Well, unless he was fighting Draco, of course.
Draco was hopeful that Harry would continue the talk from their morning session, but every time Draco tried to introduce the topic, Harry would switch it to something inconsequential, like Quidditch.
Draco didn't know what to say. His first thought was to jump to his feet and defend himself, but he was struck dumb. He'd never heard Harry talk so openly before. And to hear that Harry wanted things to change between them—it was great. Maybe the room had some sort of truthful spell on it.
After a few hopeless days, it was time Hedwig and Darius to talk to Bob about their assignment. They definitely weren't giving up (Darius wouldn't hear of it; they'd be the laughing stock of BAHAHAHAH), they simply needed some input from their most esteemed colleague. Maybe some fresh ideas. And maybe a couple of extra agents to help them. Maybe even a miracle. That's what they really needed.
“You like men, I am a man, ergo, I'm quite flattered that you like me. But, I have one question, and don't get mad: you have been an absolute twat to me since the day we started training.”
, Harry knew it could indeed get better. Harry had never seen himself as being obsessed with sex, but, with Draco, he couldn't get enough. Harry wasn't at all surprised at how easy they had fallen into being boyfriends, and he didn't think anything could drag him down from his happy high.
“I don't know. Yes, no, maybe. Fuck, it's a yes. Of course it's a yes. You know how miserable I am without him. I need him back.”
Harry desperately needed a holiday. He knew this for many reasons. One: He was getting pretty fed up of hiding out from the press and his adoring fans in Grimmauld Place all day. Two: He wanted some sun, sea and definitely some sex. Three: Everyone from his friends to the bloke behind the counter at the local shop told him so on a daily basis.
When Harry finally awoke, it was to the bright sun streaming through the open curtains, and a back that felt as if it had been trampled by a Hippogriff. Sitting on the hard courtyard floor all night had not been the best idea. Hindsight was a bitch.
Dog watched happily as Harry struggled to pick the tree up and put it back in place. Dog didn't even wait for Harry to turn around before pulling it back over. This earned a quiet moan of frustration and another sigh from Harry.
I'd barely got through my opening spiel on how the new Floo powder worked and how it was going to save money and energy, when it happened. A black cloaked figure—a weird sight on such a warm day—emerged from the alley, shouting and ranting, wand held aloft.
Draco to realise he'd broadcast their sex life to the world while sitting in a pub surrounded by their friends. But still. He needed more booze.
Ron's family weren't any help at all. Their confused looks followed by outright laughter as Ron explained what they thought they knew only made Hermione feel worse. Ginny's incredulous look prompted another unwelcome thought for Hermione—her letters stating how sickeningly cute Harry and Draco were together, and how Draco needed to learn to keep his tongue to himself took on a whole new meaning.
The words themselves were innocuous enough—How do you fancy the Cannons match tomorrow? I can score us some tickets; I can meet you for a nice meal afterwards. We haven't done that in a while—but Draco didn't miss the singular 'you' being directed at Harry.
Once the five cars—Ten and One had obviously decided on which car to use—were lined up, Draco didn't think much of his and Harry's chances. Their little car looked positively simple in comparison to the others. Grumpy and Frumpy had even fashioned a flag of sorts to put on top of theirs.
At Ron's urging, Harry had joined them all in the pub for a couple of beers in the sunshine. It was the last thing he'd needed. Three beers in, and Harry had had to stumble home, cuddle up to Brewin on the sofa and go to sleep.
“I know you're tired, but can we talk for a minute?” Harry asked, sitting down on Draco's bed and patting the space beside him.
“Bollocks,” Ron said around a mouthful of peanuts. “Did you see the way the Hulk dealt with Loki. Pure fucking brilliance.”
“It's just not working,” Ginny had said when it seemed they'd exhausted all talk. “I think—no, I know—we need a divorce.”
They both stopped talking as they realised what they had said and Harry found himself inexplicably bursting into laughter. Malfoy soon followed.
A clock chimed in the distance, but Draco ignored it as he caught up to Glinda, his partner by his side in a flash.
“You can't do that, Draco! You're playing with people's feelings. And what the fuck are you smiling at?”
Draco nodded. “When I got my first set, I built this big wheel thing. Of course, I had magic to stop it from falling over and to make it go around...”
“To Harry's new house!” the entire table chorused as Harry blushed and tried to hide behind his pint.
“But, I do need your help,” Harry said, sitting back down. “Can you explain to me how to use an airport?”
“Why don't you take a turn then? I bet I know as much about you.” Draco pushed the parchment towards Harry.
Hedwig and Darius tried everything they could think of. Their attempt at putting Harry and Draco in the same room was the worst idea they'd ever had. Glares and mutters between their groups of friends was the best of it. Darius had had the bizarre idea of sending them both chocolate as Draco always seemed happier after eating it. That was when they discovered that teenagers hyped up on sugar and then set loose on one another was never a good plan.
“I know this is different for the two of you,” Glinda said after they'd taken their seats. “But I'm going to treat this as if you were here the same as any married couple. Is that okay?”
Their talking and laughing continued as they ate their meals and finished off the drinks on the tray. Draco had gallantly downed the first of the smoking shots. Harry had sniffed it, coughed and refused. Draco had grabbed the shot out of his hand and gulped it down in one. Not to be outdone, Harry took another off the tray and did the same.
This was supposed to be a short 1-2k PWP from a comment that Wendy made concerning nudist!Harry and Draco. Alas, it was not to be. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Malfoy had acted normally all day. They'd worked side-by-side, doing what they did best and it was perfectly
“If we're going to drink all of this, we might need some food.” Draco grabbed a menu off of the table next to them. “What do you want?”
Harry smiled at the receptionist as he walked in, ignoring her look of confusion and the over-dramatic looking at her watch, and made his way to the lab. He needed quiet—and definitely didn't want anybody disturbing him—and the lab was the best place to be for that. Malfoy wouldn't be in for another hour, and the assistants knew never to enter the lab without his or Malfoy's express admittance.
Was he trying to get close to me to embarrass me in the future? Was he trying—and the idea horrified me more than I'd thought—to score points to steal Granger from Weasley? Was he, as far fetched as it might be, actually trying to be my friend?
Picking up all the boxes, Harry took them out of the room, returning only moments later with a much more colourful box with a picture of a more friendly looking penguin on the front.
Ron laughed. “That was a good one; she does have a way with words. And ew. If she said it to me, I'd be calling the mediwitches. Seeing how she's my sister and all.”
The years had obviously done Draco Malfoy the world of good. He was still a snarky bastard, but Malfoy had an edge to him now that told Harry just how
“Morning,” Draco said, stifling a yawn and well aware that he hadn't brushed his teeth yet. “Have we missed breakfast?”
Harry was rather pleasantly surprised at Ron and Hermione's easy acceptance of his and Draco's relationship. Harry had finally blurted it out during a rare phone call to Ron. Harry thought that over the phone was the second best thing to telling them in person, and Harry couldn't stomach the thought—or the cost—of travelling all the way to Australia just to tell his friends that he had a boyfriend.
“And this one,” Harry said, gesturing towards Draco with his glass, “thinks Iron Man is the best Avenger.”
“No,” Glinda answered kindly when Draco asked her about it. “This is tailored to ma-couple's counselling. It's quite different. I'm sure it will still be of help.”
Harry very briefly cursed all of his friends for having actual jobs and therefore unable to make this momentous decision for him. There were simply far too many choices to even consider
“Yes, yes; I'll close up. You go have rampant sex on the steps of the Ministry.” She waved her hands in a dismissive gesture, whipping out her wand and clearing up the now-cold puddle of tea behind the counter. “Prove you're both still devouring each other every spare moment. I'll stay here and do all the work.”
“No,” Harry finally said. “You're....different. But that's not the point. Even if I did believe you, why? Why are you here?”
I was just walking through the lobby of the Ministry with Ron and Hermione, just on our way to lunch when I heard my name being called. Spinning around I saw you coming towards me. You were so excited, I don't think you even realised where we were and who I was with.
Moving on, Draco couldn't help but notice the next couple. They were the exact opposite of Ten and One. Beauty and The Bear, Draco thought immediately. She was stunning—gay, straight or alien could see that—and he was as hirsute as he'd seen a man. And that included Old Mr Goyle. Draco's first instinct was that The Bear was Beauty's bodyguard.
“I know you don't like your friends talking to the press,” Zach said, looking slightly alarmed. “I was trying to do what you wanted.”
Harry was still apprehensive as he and Ginny made their way through the crowds. Hermione had refused to tell him what the ball was actually
When he met Ron for lunch, he asked what was making him so happy, and Harry was quite annoyed that he couldn't tell his best friend. Malfoy, of course, picked up on it, teasing Harry about 'finally getting some'. Harry wanted to scream. He wanted to pick Malfoy up, kiss him and scream from the rooftops that, yes, he was 'getting some'.
Harry was expecting at least a small grumble at that, but Draco surprised him by simply taking his hand and following him down the path. The walk took longer than Harry thought it would, and he was feeling the cold. It might not have taken so long had they been slightly less drunk and not stopping every couple of steps for chaste snogs. It was only when they were in sight of his house that Harry thought to do a Warming Charm.
“Not now,” Harry said before Draco could get a word in. “I just want to relax for a bit; can we talk later?”
Harry needed a distraction. He also needed to stop lounging in the sun, drinking beer all day; he didn't want to go home two stone heavier.
“Why not?” It wasn't the first time that Draco had attempted to be not-enemies with Potter, but it was the first time he'd pursued it. Usually, he'd have sneered and turned away by now.
Divorce. It was a weird thing to be thinking about on his wedding day, but Harry couldn't help it. He'd grown up thinking it was one of the worst things that could happen in the world. Aunt Petunia always seemed to think so, anyway. She thought it a friendship-ending crime and would take glee in talking nastily about it to anyone who would listen. When Mr and Mrs Perkins from number sixty-three announced their separation, she forbade Dudley from playing with David and encouraged her gossiping cronies to shun the poor woman.
Professor Flitwick must have read my mind, as the very next class after I'd concocted my plan gave me the very opportunity I'd been looking for to put the plan into action.
Harry couldn't believe it. He ruined everything with his big, fat gob. He found Draco immensely funny and loved spending time with him and now he'd blown it. Bollocks.
I had to talk to you. I couldn't go back to school and see you every day without speaking with you first. I needed to start afresh. Start anew. And that started with you.
Harry had finally come to a decision: he was going to ask Draco to move in with him. He had thought long and hard about it, but had decided that it was time; he couldn't think of an argument against it. Draco already spent most of his free time with Harry, and slept in Harry's bed more often than not. Harry just hoped that Draco agreed that it was the right next step for them.
Which made my plan that much easier to put into action. From that lesson on, any time Potter tried to talk to me, he found himself fighting off little paper cranes. As the weeks went on, I got inventive and even managed to get little patterns on their wings. It was instinct after a while, Potter started talking and I'd have cranes flying at his head without a second thought. It was quite fun, to watch Potter batting the bits of paper away from his head.
He pushed the paper into Draco's hands. Draco couldn't help but notice the worried look on Harry's face, and unfolded it slowly.
Harry used his time at the bar to calm himself down and berate himself for acting like an idiot schoolboy. Surely he should be past the babbling stage at his age. Harry couldn't count the number of dates he'd been on; surely he should know how to do it by now. Harry needed a strong Hover Charm to carry the tray of drinks back. After all, he only had two hands, and he'd bought four whiskies, two beers, four shots—that were smoking—and two bottles of wine.
“He came to see me last night, after your talk in the pub. He asked if there was any reason for him to stay, work-wise, and when I told him no, he said he would leave first thing in the morning.”
Zach looked flustered for a second before he plastered a grin on his face and handed Harry a piece of paper. “The address. I'll Apparate myself, then,” he said before turning and walking straight back out of the door.
“Well, of course he's seen it. How can you miss it?” Pansy winked at Harry before wrapping her arms around Draco's bicep.
“Now I'm sure you'd like to settle into your rooms and start your holiday properly,” Tony said with his seemingly never-ending smile on his face. “Please follow me and I'll show you where you're staying.”
It was a short walk from Grimmauld Place to get into town and Harry found the travel agency without too much trouble. After all, asking four random fellow shoppers and a policeman for directions was a perfectly normal thing to do if you were unfamiliar with an area.
And then they waited. With Pig and Arnold keeping an eye on Harry and Draco, Hedwig and Darius decided to take a little break and went for a fly until it was time for the meeting. They'd worked their tails off; they bloody well deserved it. Having Harry and Draco as owners was bad enough, having them as a case was, quite frankly, exhausting.
It was Neville that had had given him an idea on how to fix it. Well, an idea to get Harry and Draco to spend more time together; it would take more than Harry to fix Croatia's problems. Harry had decided to ask Pansy to look after the café for a week, and he was hoping that Draco would take a week off fixing the world's problems.
Hedwig pushed him with her wing. She had been right. Pompous git. “I've been here waiting. I have news.”
“Fuck off,” Pansy said, downing her wine and fanning her face with the beer mat. “Ginny had me interested, so I popped into Flourish at lunchtime and picked one of the felching books up.”
Harry was simply enjoying his holiday. If part of that was due to his surprising and blossoming friendship with Draco, Harry couldn't bring himself to care. He'd think about it some other time. He had swimming to do.
“What's wrong?” Draco asked before calmly taking a sip of water. “You didn't like Iron Man? But you loved the Iron Man film.”
Harry looked up to see Draco barely restraining laughter. “I don't want to shag you!” Harry said quickly.
Two days before Draco and Hermione were due to take their Portkey to Croatia, Harry had arranged a get together with all of their friends in their usual pub. Hermione had insisted that she had too much work on to party, but Harry had put his foot down. He cited Ron's sadness at losing his girlfriend, and his own need for one last night of drunken fun before she and Draco went off to fix wizardkind.
“There's this new writer who has burst on the scene in the states. I picked up a book one afternoon and got hooked. Mum saw one of the books in my bag and wouldn't stop talking about it. I didn't know they were so popular over here and I definitely didn't think my bloody mother would be reading them.”
“No, I'm just early.” Zach smiled, but Harry could tell it wasn't a real one. “I wasn't expecting anybody else; I only bought enough takeaway for two.”
“How could keeping your child from you be the best for anyone?” Harry questioned, sounding rather frustrated while doing so.
“Of course, buddy.” And Harry snuggled the boy tightly and told him the story of The Wolf and The Morph, and within minutes, the boy was sound asleep in his arms.
Draco sighed and looked at Harry, his eyes were kind and sincere. He could tell that there was no malicious intent in the invitation and decided that it wouldn’t hurt to finally meet the Weasley’s outside of the horror from their past. “Fine. Let’s go to dinner at the Weasley’s.”
Draco stood in the mirror, staring at his appearance. Potter was right, he needed to shave, Malfoy’s were not the type to have facial hair without looking like they were trying to overthrow the government. He looked down at his watched and noticed that it was only 4:30, but he knew he had to make sure that he looked somewhat presentable, he didn’t want Teddy to think he was always so unkempt. He hopped in the shower and made sure to take time cleaning his hair and face. He stood in the hot shower and let the hot water run down his back, releasing all the tension in his shoulders, something he noticed that was going on for quite some time now.
“Don’t worry about it Teddy, just fascinated me is all. You can change what you look like in front of me all you want okay?” Teddy smiled at the words. He hugged Draco and when he pulled away, Draco watched as the boy changed his hair from the deep navy to a light sky blue. Draco was incredibly impressed with the talents that Teddy showed and couldn’t help but grin from ear to ear.
He looked back at his watch and noticed that only 45 minutes had passed and didn’t know what to do with the time remaining. He knew he shouldn’t have a glass of whiskey because that wouldn’t be right to meet an eight-year-old somewhat sloshed and decided that he would go down to Diagon Alley and find something for the boy as a peace offering of some sort.
“Professor McGonagall?” Draco stopped directly in the center of the room, unable to understand what was going on.
“Hey Ted?” Harry said as he pulled himself up off the floor. “How about we get you cleaned up and ready for bed?”
He walked down the cobble stone road and ended up at a small toy shop a few blocks past Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. He looked around the shelves and nothing had stood out to him that seemed proper to give the boy, the toys were either to simple for a child of his age or just seemed downright boring. He walked around for a few more minutes when out of the corner of his eye he spotted the perfect toy. He took it straight to the counter and smiled proudly at his decision as the woman behind the counter accepted his money and he walked out of the store.
“So, how’s your mum?” Harry asked, realizing it was probably a stupid question but didn’t really know what else to say to break the silence.
He pulled a hangover potion from the shelf beside the sink, drank it reluctantly as he looked at himself in the mirror, something he hadn’t done in what seemed like months. His face had thinned significantly, making his features more predominant than they naturally were. His eyes seemed sunken in and his hair was no longer slicked back and shiny as it was throughout his whole life. He hadn’t realized how long it had gotten, it almost resembled his fathers, aside from the severe unkemptness it showed. He hadn’t noticed that he hadn’t shaven in weeks either, his blonde hair growing scruffy and unruly from his jaw and around his mouth. He scoffed at his appearance and walked out of the room and headed straight for the fireplace and made his way to Potter’s home. Hoping that what he had said the day prior, was true and he would be allowed to come by again.
Malfoy seemed to be thinking this over, and then he looked up at Harry and finally said, “It was a time that I figured you would be in.” He looked over Harry’s face, which showed more curiosity before, “That first night, it was 10, so when I came by the second night at the same time, and you were home yet again, I figured that would be an appropriate time to come by. Knowing you were home and just sitting in here, and all.”
“Of all of the people in the world that could get the sorting hat to change it’s sorting, of course it would be you.” Draco laughed and turned back to the sorting hat. “Thank you so much for answering our questions. I thought he’d been lying about it all.” The sorting hat nodded and went back to sleep as the two men walked back to McGonagall and Teddy.
Draco sighed and stepped out of the floo, cleaning himself off as he did so. He followed Harry into the same direction Teddy had ran towards the kitchen and almost stopped in his tracks to take in the chaos that was Mrs. Weasley’s kitchen. It was a chaos that Draco had never seen, but something about it made Draco feel as if he was… home. A smile formed across Draco’s face before he even knew what was happening. He looked around the room and was amazed at everything around him. There were dishes washing themselves in the sink, knitting in the corner, food placing itself on the table, where there were 15 seats around it. Draco knew that the Weasley’s had a large family, but had never fully seen the whole family together at once, and he knew that this was either going to go horribly, or very well, thanks to Harry and Teddy.
After a couple of drinks, Harry headed to go pick up Teddy and deal with Andromeda’s incessant badgering. He went through his usual nighttime routine with Teddy, minus the story this time, and finally sat down on the couch in the sitting room. At 10 O’clock on the dot again, his fireplace roared a bright emerald green again and Malfoy’s face was looking back at him again.
“YOU USED A SPELL ON ME THAT YOU DIDN’T EVEN KNOW? ARE YOU DAFT POTTER? HOW FUCKING STUPID WERE YOU?” Draco was fuming at this point. He looked at Harry closely and noticed the hurt on his face from this one moment. He stared at him for a moment and finally took a deep breath and tried to calm himself.
“I did. I never told anyone that I had started it because, to be honest, I don’t think anyone would have believed that I, of all people, said something nice about you, but I honestly did. I had said it behind a bookshelf in the library where I saw a group of Hufflepuffs sitting and they went from there.” Draco smiled proudly at the memory.
Harry simply nodded, smiling at the man laughing across from him. “Well Ron was at a loss for words at that point because the troll had grabbed me by the leg and had tried to beat me with the club that he was holding. Thankfully Hermione reminded him of the levitation charm that Flitwick had shown that same day and he was able to perform the spell and lift his club in the air. When he dropped the spell, the club hit the troll on the head and knocked him out. And now here we are.”
Harry smiled and looked back at Teddy’s door, remembering the day that he was brought home and he couldn’t have imagined a better moment in his life. The dreams had subsided significantly, and the bad days didn’t seem so bad since Teddy arrived. Harry was so grateful for his godson. He looked down at his tumbler and noticed it was empty. He leaned to grab the bottle of scotch and refill it when the fire turned green and he saw Malfoy. He looked at the clock, it said 10 O’clock. Harry nodded and Malfoy walked in, sat down, and poured a glass of whiskey.
“There has only been one person on this earth that deserved to die, and we both know who that is.” Harry had a sense of ferocity in his voice now that made Draco look up now, and he didn’t see pity in Harry’s eyes, he saw rage. “And you know what’s insane Draco, I tried to
When Harry finished Ron just looked at him with the same curiosity he had started with, finally, he gave a big sigh and put his hands on his knees. “Well mate, I don’t know what to tell you about that one.” He shook his head at Harry and looked as if he was giving it a bit more thought. “Ya’ know, you mind if I run this past ‘Mione and see what she has to say about it?”
Draco looked up at him and shrugged. “Figured I’d get a glass or two of whiskey from you before I did.” He smiled at Harry, who nodded and made his way to the kitchen to grab their respective bottles and two tumblers. He set the bottles and tumblers down on the table in front of Draco, who leaned forward and poured himself a glass.
He tried to shake the memory from his mind and then his thought trickled to the day Father died. It was hard on Mother, she didn’t leave her room for days after they had received word via owl that he had died while in prison, but that didn’t mean that it still didn’t hurt her. Draco was sad, yes, but in the back of his mind he was happy the world was rid of the man. He was always so callous, and his words were always filled with venom when he spoke to anyone but Mother. But that day, that dreadful day, it broke his heart to see Mother so distraught. He was always a look of composure, pristine and proper, but that day, that week really, she was nothing more than a shell of the woman that Draco had remembered looking up at every day with admiration. A woman who loved her son with such heart that she had lied to the Dark Lord to make sure he was alive.
McGonagall nodded and had sandwiches and sweets sent up to her office where the four of them enjoyed lunch before Harry, Teddy, and Draco set off back to Harry’s home.
Draco looked back at Harry and his eyes softened slightly when they met Harry’s, a feeling of comfort swept over him that he had only felt once in his life, when his mother had reached out her hand towards him in the courtyard the day of the battle.
When they finally ran out of their ammunitions, the three of them were on the floor, out of breath, and laughing intensely. Draco looked around at the now food covered kitchen and leaned back against one of the cupboards. He looked over at Harry, who was wiping off his glasses, and smiled so big his cheeks hurt.
Harry finally finished the cases and looked at his watch, it was only fifteen past but he just didn’t have the drive to go to the Leaky Cauldron. Every time he went with Ron, he either had someone staring at him, or people coming up to him at the most inconvenient times, and he just didn’t want to deal with that today. He decided that a walk through London would be the best thing for him, let him clear his head for the day before going to pick up Teddy from his grandmother, who always gave him an earful about what new things she’s read about in the Muggle magazines, and how Harry needed to find a better job that didn’t risk Teddy being without his Godfather.
you. And besides, I’ll be there, don’t worry, if anything happens, I’ll be there to make sure you’re okay. You’re safe with us Draco.” He looked down at Teddy who was smiling up at Draco with such bright and vivid eyes, he thought he could cry in that moment.
Draco shrugged it off and just assumed it was Potter’s tactic to making someone feel comfortable with how they are feeling in that moment so that they don’t feel embarrassed to talk to him about things. He ignored his thoughts and finally ordered some takeaway and sat in his armchair, finally able to relax for once in his life. His thoughts were drifting to some of his fonder memories of his life when he was disturbed by the sound of scratching at his window. He looked up and saw a familiar barn owl perched just outside,
Harry woke the next morning to Teddy jumping on his bed, his hair now a vibrant lime green, begging for pancakes. “Please daddy,” The small boy begged. “can we please have pancake’s this morning?”
, so he hadn’t really needed to wear them anymore. After deciding that most of the wardrobe in his closet was far too fancy to wear to meet a child, he decided on a simple white button-down shirt, with a pair of navy-blue trousers and loafers. He looked himself over in the full-length mirror and scoffed, thinking that his younger self would be appalled at the man standing in the mirror. He didn’t have a proper waistcoat, or cufflinks, or a tie, he just looked, simple. But he didn’t have the energy or effort to put into any of that and figured Potter would take the piss out of him if he met Teddy that way.
“It hasn’t ended for me either, Potter.” Draco was looking at the man across from him with tired eyes. He didn’t know that Potter had felt this way. He had seen Potter in the Prophet, he knew everyone reveled him as their Savior, he knew they all told him that this was the best things had been in a long time thanks to him.
“You don’t have to say anything Draco.” Harry smiled softly and nodded. “I already know.” His smile faltered somewhat, but Draco couldn’t place why. “I go through the same thing quite often. I know it’s been a while since the war, but even eight years later, depression hits me like a ton of bricks.” Harry leaned back on the couch, his hand still on top of Draco’s, the other running through his hair, his sleeve falling slightly to show a colorful assortment of tattoo’s on his arm.
“And I’m still not going to Draco.” Draco looked over to see a playful grin across Harry’s face that made his chest tighten, but he didn’t know why. He heard Harry whisper a location but he still couldn’t make out what he had said, so he crossed his arms and huffed again.
“Malfoy.” The realization finally hit Harry like a ton of bricks. “But why would he come to me for help?”
After he had finished his food, downed two glasses of whiskey, and reveled in his shit life, he looked at his side table and noticed the card. He stared at the card for a minute and finally admitted defeat.
Harry arrived at his London flat shortly after his encounter with Malfoy. He unlocked the door and slowly walked in and stood and looked down the dark hallway. It was quiet in the home without the sounds of his godson running around. He had reached out to Andromeda to let her know that he was going to be late coming to get Teddy. He walked down the hallway and into the dimly lit kitchen and began to prepare dinner for the two of them before he went to go get him.
I'm apologize for how long it has taken me for getting another chapter up! Thank you to anyone who reads this fic, I've just been incredibly busy with the holidays and trying to take advantage of every spare minute to myself. Thanks for the patience!
“Can I ask you a question though?” Harry said with a bite of concern in his voice that made Malfoy’s brow furrow. He nodded anyway and Harry continued. “Why 10 O’clock at night?”
He'd never been able to cast a patronus, not even a whisp. But standing before him is a fully grown stag that Harry conjured as if it was nothing. He is almost tempted to say something complimentary but when he opens his mouth Harry snatches his arm and begins dragging him back to school.
"I won't, you just seem..I don't know.." He sighs scrambling to climb out of the fountain after her. "I am intrigued by you, but I don't wish to marry you as terrible as that sounds" He says and it feels like he's digging himself into a hole
As he grew older he came to admire Potter for this resilience in the face of disaster, secretly of course. Draco knew his role, and that meant that they were enemies. It was easy to turn his jealousy into hatred for all those years. Potter was so perfect that if you don't admire him you inevitably hate him. Being enemies suited Draco well. He has always been good with a wand and insults are a second language to him. When you have such a cold demeanor you learn to hurl insults quite easily.
"I was hoping that you changed." Harry says "That you're different now." And for some reason this seems to strike Draco in the gut. The idea that he hasn't changed through the years hurts. And to think Harry and the entire wizarding world see him as a bloodthirsty deatheater when he couldn't even bring himself to kill seems a cruel joke. He loves his parents but the things they did in the name of the dark lord were horrific, that is something he can admit to. But to have anyone think they were the same when he couldn't live up to their expectations fills him with a torrent of emotions. He wanted so desperately to be like them and yet Potter is sitting in front of him telling him they are the same.
Surprised by the outburst Draco stuttered looking shocked "I- well- you know I can't-" Draco said haltingly, but Crabbe cut him off.
"That would be quite the miracle" Blaise says laughing. "Do you two know what you're doing when you leave?" He asks looking to Crabbe and Goyle.
He is dragged back to reality by Blaise's voice "You alright there, Draco?" He asks and he realize Blaise must have been trying to get his attention for a while. "Yeah I-" he starts but the weight of the lie feels immense. "No..no I'm not." He says and it feels like the world has suddenly been lifted off his shoulders.
They're both quiet for another moment before he speaks again"Just one more year?" He says quietly, more of a question than anything and she nods. They sit down on the edge of her bed and Draco sighs softly "Why him? Out of everyone, why did it have to be him?" And at this Pansy cracks a smile. "You've always wanted what you can't have."
This is when headmaster mcgonagall steps up to the front of the room. Holding up her wand to her throat she begins to speak, her voice amplified across the room. Completely skipping a greeting he says "As some of you are already aware, there has been an injury on Hogwarts grounds." There is a ripple of whispers across the room but she continues. "Rest assured that this issue will be dealt with. We will not tolerate this sort of violence within Hogwarts walls. If anybody has information on the attack come see me in my office after class." With this she takes her seat and there is immediate chatter among the students.
and he starts to pull out small plants. The room is smaller than he was used to and even in the slytherin dorms he would often take up more than his fair share of space. On each side there is a window, a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. Draco sets to organizing his things. Placing books about potions, alchemy, and herbology, across the bookshelf. Then along every other available surface on his side of the room he starts to cover it with plants. He has used them to practice potions for years. Ever since he was a child he wanted to be an alchemist and potioneer. Several of his plants are nearly ten years old at this point.
Crabbe sighed and when he finally looked at Draco his expression was steely. "We talked about it on the way over and he may be a drunkard, but he's right." This pushed Goyle to speak up too.
"I remember, my mother had read me the princess and the frog the night before and I was convinced that every frog must be someone cursed into a frog" Draco says with a little laugh as Blaise nods. "And I watched you chase around that frog and when you caught it you kissed it right on its slimy little head." Blaise says grinning. "That's when I decided I wanted to be your friend. Not because of your family or your money but because you crawled around in the dirt to kiss a frog." He says laying his hand on Draco's shoulder. "You're still that person that's gentle, kind and adventurous. You aren't who your parents forced you be, and you don't always have to be perfect." He says softly and Draco turns silently to give him a hug. "Th-" Draco starts but Blaise cuts him off "You don't have to thank me." He says squeezing Draco in a tight hug for a moment before he lets go. "Now come on, we've fallen behind." He says pulling away from the hug and Draco looks up to see the others nearly to the edge of the town.
"You've always been the hero-" Draco yells feeling his pent up anger and frustration brimming inside him.
"Lavender" he says shortly wishing this conversation would just end. And thankfully in reply Harry just makes a small noise then moves away. It fills him with relief and as Harry walks back to his side of the room he feels as though he can breathe again. He forces himself to block out everything and to focus solely on his potions. Forcing away any thought of Harry and the all consuming urge to do something awful to rectify the only neutral conversation they have ever had. That is, if you could even call that a conversation.
"Shut up, you're not forgiven." Harry hisses. "Just because I don't want anyone else to die doesn't mean you can get away with whatever you want." Harry says pulling Draco roughly as they weave through the trees. As he's pulled this way and that he stays silent, aside from the occasional grunt as his shoulder as he is dragged into hitting a tree. He has a sneaking suspicion that most of these are intentional.
Harry watched the mans face and his smile had followed. “Whenever you do feel like you want to talk about it, I’m here. You know that right?”
“It’s nothing Harry, it just means that I get to spend a little extra time with this fireball here.” She laughed as Teddy turned his hair a vibrant flame red/orange at the sound of ‘fireball’.
“These are amazing Teds. I had no idea you were such a good cook.” Harry said, mouth half-full of another bite of pancake, because they really were, amazing.
“I know, she was typically the reason Ron and I had survived every year. I don’t think either of us would be alive today without her being our friend throughout school. But when we had entered the lavatory, the troll was making a right mess of it, smashing everything it could to try and get Hermione, it was terrible. We had tried to distract it to keep it away from her and knowing Ron and I, we didn’t think that through all the way because it had come for us at that point.” He shot a glance at Draco who was back to laughing, holding his stomach and face turning red. “So, I had jumped on the back of this thing, which was, of course, a stupid idea, and somehow my wand got stuck up his nose.” Draco almost fell over at this point in the story, he was laughing so hard.
Draco sighed and set his glass down and straightened himself out in the chair. “I used to read it to my son every night.” He was looking down at his hands as he spoke, and then he glanced up at Harry. The man across from him had a questioning look on his face. Draco decided that telling Harry about Scorpius wasn’t a bad thing and continued into an explanation of what he meant. “I have a son, Scorpius, he’s 4.”
“Yeah. But something else weird happened last night thought.” The words had blurted out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop himself. He didn’t realize he had needed to talk about it until he was in mid-conversation. Ron raised an eyebrow in curiosity at Harry and sat down in the chair opposite him. Harry just decided to go ahead and delve into last nights oddities with Malfoy showing up out of nowhere. Ron listened intently and didn’t interrupt like he normally would in a situation like this.
The man had his back facing Draco, but from what he could see, he had lightly tanned olive skin, a rather big smile, from which Draco could see his cheeks rise every time he laughed. His shoulders were toned and muscular from what he could tell in his T-shirt. Draco pulled out of his thoughts towards a random stranger when he saw the bartender finally walking towards him. He was just about to order a glass of whiskey when out of the corner of his eye, the man next to him had turned. Draco could just make out the silhouette of his neighbor at the bar, noticed that what he thought was a chopstick in the man’s hair, was really a wand, and his stomach dropped.
“Exactly,” Draco confirmed. “If I were to simply pour them both into the same vial, they would end up mixing together and reacting to each other and create all sorts of strange effects. Best case scenario, they’ll start neutralizing each other and you’re left with a weak partial antidote.”
Draco handed him the letter and went to close the window, but stopped almost immediately. “Oh Merlin,” he said, “there’s another one.”
Draco spent most of the next day dealing with his hangover, taking several potions to cure his pounding head, his nausea, his dehydration. He wondered why he always forgot this part when he decided drinking was a good idea, and he grumbled about Blaise enabling him. He very carefully did not think about what had happened on the astronomy tower the night before. His headache had only just gone, and he had a feeling that too much thinking would bring it right back.
Three Ravenclaws, one Hufflepuff, two Slytherins trying to distance themselves from the wrong side of the war. Their faces were burned into Draco's memory.
agree to the charm once I know more, but I won’t allow you to cast anything on me if I have no idea at all why you’re even casting it.
“Hurry,” Susan Bones said, frowning steeply as she scanned the hall they were standing in. “If we don’t manage to intercept that –”
She laughed. “I won’t argue with that. Some of their products are downright ridiculous, but the atmospheric illusions are lovely. Ron looked quite pleased when I told him that. I think he’s planning on giving me a huge pile of them for Christmas.”
Draco felt a bit lost and like he’d missed something, but that didn’t stop the guilt from trying to drown him anyway. He tried to find something to say, a peace offering, a placating gesture, but in the end, he remained silent and confused and felt like a knob.
“Absolutely not,” Granger said emphatically in a way that made Draco think she had already considered and dismissed the possibility. “Not even by accident. No one goes near the Veil these days apart from the readings we take, and those are only for observation, to make sure it isn’t doing anything bloody weird. Not that it didn’t do something bloody weird anyway, but.” She flailed out a hand as though insinuating that the Veil’s apparent recalcitrant qualities didn’t concern her overmuch at the moment.
“Right, yes, Leroy.” Harry had nearly forgotten. “His name isn’t actually the problem, it’s…everything else.”
Draco’s respect for the former Hufflepuff shot through the roof as he watched the girl he’d always thought of as meek and timid begin to fire off spells. Bones was
“You know what that means, don’t you?” Theo asks. “Pansy and Hermione will be absolutely impossible about this.”
Although Harry was very much counting on the fact that his chosen style made the identities of the men impossible to determine with certainty.
“Well, yes, but keeping you in good spirits is too,” she said. “I do want you to do your best work.”
, even if it was only in some strange way Harry couldn’t quite define. And he also knew that Malfoy had seen the essence of Harry’s secret fantasy about the two of them, and now all Harry saw in his mind’s eye was the scene he had imagined – in detail – as he’d been painting. And what a scene it had been.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing, Potter, making all this noise?” Draco had appeared in the doorway to the kitchen. His face was splotchy, his eyes red-rimmed. The sight made Harry’s heart hurt and he wondered how he could ever have been this blind. “Have you come back to yell at me more? Patronize me? Micromanage my life?” He crossed his arms and gave Harry a cold stare.
Much as Harry might not have meant to make it one, it was an order to Draco. He followed it, feeling Harry’s breath on his face as Harry started tracing slow circles with his fingertips. It felt good, soothing. But then Harry’s lips pressed slowly against his, and Draco froze, remembering that there wasn’t a locked door between them and the rest of the world, as there usually was when Harry kissed him. This was out in the open. Someone could have walked in at any time. Someone could have witnessed what was between them, and then where would they be?
“Obviously, Granger is only concerned for the integrity of the department and not at all bitter,” said Blaise.
“Your mother should just be glad that Lucius isn’t in Azkaban.” Harry laid the notebook aside with care and came over to Draco, standing behind his chair and laying his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Breathe.”
Draco’s mouth twitched. “Granger said that, did she? That’s good to know, I’ll have to give her a hard time about it.”
Draco stared with his mouth open. He cleared his throat after a good fifteen seconds of silent staring and asked, “The…the stuff that’s inside time turners?”
“It wasn't what they did,” said Draco, because it was true. He could handle a few curses and hexes. “It's what they said.”
“The thing is,” Hermione talked right over him, “you’ve already worked out the dual antidote for Hank – it needs a skilled brewer, yes, but all that brewer has to do is follow instructions. You do trust Victoria to do that, don’t you?”
It was wonderful. He closed his eyes and he embraced the pain, and bit by bit, he managed to calm himself. His body relaxed. His breathing evened out. When Potter finally released him, he only sighed and let his head fall forward.
“They found two human skeletons down there,” Blaise said gently. “Couldn’t identify them with complete accuracy – they were charred and fused and half-melted – but it stands to reason that those were the only two people who were down there. And even if there is some strange way Potter managed to save himself…I can’t see any reason he would have put his loved ones through that, letting them think he was dead for over two years. No, Draco, he died in that place. He truly did. I don’t know how to explain him being here, but we don’t know enough about death to understand it, perhaps ever.”
The angle had been right, making him see stars and his blood sing, but he had to get the words out, he had to, else he’d never say them at all.
“Suppose not,” said Draco. “Alright, back to work. I’m trying to find some way to get the poison particles to reveal how many and which magical triggers were placed on it. I’ve been thinking some kind of magi-chemical indicator might work, but I’m having trouble coming up with a substance that is reactive enough. Any ideas?”
Granger frowned down at her cutting board. Her chopping motions were precise and consistent. “It’s because antidote A and antidote B might have ingredients or elements that interact badly with each other if there is no buffering or binding agent.”
“It would be counterproductive to figuring out who did it,” Draco said. “I’d lose the ability to ask questions to the witnesses, for one, and I’ve gotten some helpful information that way.”
“Isn’t that also a form of misconduct?” Draco pointed out. “Right, that’s it. Four days and two hundred and twelve ingredients, just for the record, but I’ve done as much as I can. Once the stasis is gone, everything should happen quite quickly.”
“Yes, but this doesn’t exactly…I…I have some debts, you see. Not a lot, but more than my allowance can cover, and I decided to ask her to cover them, just this once, and she said she wouldn’t. We argued, June came to my aid. My mother insulted June, and then we were all shouting at each other. At some point, she collapsed. It must have been the stress that got to her.”
suddenly, to hurt Draco – and maybe it should have alarmed him, but he felt flattered instead. Silk brushed against his skin as his sleeves slid down his arms, and his nipples hardened in the cool air. Harry had taken out his wand and crawled behind Draco. He had one hand once again on Draco's shoulder.
And here Draco was supposed to be a successful, knowledgeable healer and a worldly and confident man. This was getting ridiculous.
“I figured.” Potter scratched the side of his face. “When I was talking to Hermione I realized... at least I have people to talk to, those who know what I went through. It makes it easier. I don't think you have anyone.”
“Yes, fine.” Parvati rolled her eyes at him. “As long as you make sure I don’t have another complaint in my inbox afterward.”
Draco carefully closed the book he’d been reading and laid it aside. Harry had gone to visit the Granger-Weasley residence and left him not quite knowing what to do with himself, so he’d started on a book Pansy had lent him ages ago.
He had to get him to the hospital wing, everything else could wait. Harry quickly wrapped his cloak around Malfoy and lifted him from the floor. With numb shock, he realized that Malfoy was far too cold and only taking shallow breaths. He had to hurry; time was slipping away
“This one’s addressed to you.” Draco handed him the second letter and allowed the owl to find a perch.
"We're supposed to ignore you," Weasley said. "Which honestly is not too difficult, especially if it annoys you."
“I will be helping you. I’m going to mention one facet of your mother’s life at a time, and you say whatever names or descriptions you can think of. Hank over there will write them down.”
“I have, though,” Potter announces proudly. “Earlier today, I saw Parkinson and Hermione whispering together. There is no other explanation than them masterminding a plan.”
“No, you prat, that we can finally stop stressing out about the bloody time loop repeating and turning us back into two people who don’t want to make out with each other any chance they get.”
what’s urgent? How could that possibly be urgent? I just came off a thirty hour shift, Granger. Unless Potter has miraculously managed to resurrect himself, this is going to need to wait until the morning.”
Being pressed against the Saviour from shoulder to thigh, arms around each other as they try to melt into a wall to avoid being discovered by a passing group of first-years, means feeling each other’s heartbeats, panting into each other’s ear, sharing body warmth and inhaling each other’s scent. Surprisingly, Potter smells rather good, Draco has to admit, and so he really doesn’t mind when it happens several more times, even though they’ve lost track of Pansy somewhere along the way. Potter doesn’t seem to mind either, which can only mean that Draco smells like roses and has good taste in French aftershave, obviously.
"The thing is," she continued, "I've spent quite some time thinking about the best way to approach this, and I've come to the conclusion that whatever we try to change for the next iteration needs to be as subtle as possible. One wrong message can set everything back so far."
There is a collective intake of sharp breaths when Pansy pulls out her wand, and then a mass exhalation when she simply casts the stasis charm, puts down the tray, and wishes Granger a successful study session before making her way over to where Draco is sitting.
Thank you for being so kind and understanding about why this story was on hiatus for so long. It's a big relief not to have upset people as much as I feared.
Draco felt a bit betrayed, although it wasn’t like Granger had ever promised him full disclosure. She worked in a place that forced her to keep secrets as a matter of course, he told himself, it would have been her natural instinct to do so in this case as well.
“Sure,” Draco said and whispered his passphrase under his breath as he performed the correct wand movement for the spell. It took both of those and his own magical signature to make up the correct key, but they combined easily and flowed through the inked numbers on the parchment.
They finished dinner and moved what remained of their drinks over to the coffee table, above which the fairy lights were still twinkling. Draco awkwardly sat next to Potter while the other two fetched snacks, trying and failing to find a clever topic of conversation.
Granger was indeed in the Space Room, which Draco had never actually seen the inside of. She seemed to be observing Saturn, standing in a corner and directing the spin of the rings with her wand. Draco was not at all surprised by the floating planets in the vast, dark room – it was sort of in the name, really – but he certainly hadn’t expected to be lifted off the floor after he’d taken three steps.
Clearwater hadn’t shown up by the time he was well and truly finished, so he figured he could think just as well in the empty room as he could at home. So he sat cross-legged on the floor and started the task of regulating his breathing. He hadn’t managed to meditate all week, and it did him good to go through the familiar steps. But after he had emptied his mind as thoroughly as he could, instead of remaining in that state, he allowed his magic to gently draw thoughts of wands from his mind.
“Right,” Harry said and sat next to Parvati. “Er…let me know if you have any questions.” Draco thought it wasn’t possible for Parvati to
Draco tried not to smile when Harry stopped and tugged him closer. “That’s cheating,” he said, though it wasn’t a complaint. Harry, clearly not overly concerned with whether kissing was cheating or not, proceeded to do a whole lot of just that, and just like that, Draco forgot all about his head being cold.
“Indeed. I tried everything I could think of to figure out how the poison enters the body, but I found nothing. The poison is distributed completely evenly. With the speed I’ve seen it work, that shouldn’t be possible.”
Potter sought him out again six days later. Draco had made himself a little sanctuary in the library, a spot in a far corner behind stacks of books, where he could get his work done without getting looks and having to deal with anyone. At least, so he had thought. He needed to study, needed to do more than well if he was to have any chance at all at finding employment after leaving Hogwarts.
“Yes,” said Potter. He lifted his head to look at Draco, who felt warm breath brush his jaw and realized suddenly just how close Potter was.
Time passes shockingly quickly. One moment, Harry carefully tests his gingerbread for doneness, the next he’s got his wand in hand and is putting the finishing touches on his winter wonderland cake. One station over, Draco wipes the sweat from his forehead and casts the same spell Harry is currently using, the one they’d found and practiced together. It creates a miniature breeze just above the cake, small eddies that will lift very light particles and make them dance above the surface of the cake.
“What’d you reckon?” Potter asked him when they’d left Clara Goldhorn’s flat and were walking along the road. By unspoken agreement, they passed the closest apparition point, even though it was starting to snow. Draco could use the walk to clear his head, and Potter had been cooped up in the Department of Mysteries for days on end, and in Draco’s home after that, and he was obviously enjoying being outside. When Draco glanced at him, he was busy looking up to the sky and sticking out his tongue to try and catch a snowflake.
“What was the name of the Auror who did that, ma’am?” Draco asked. It wasn’t why he was here, but he was not above a bit of petty revenge on other people’s behalf, and he knew without even looking that Potter was outraged over the treatment as well. Besides, Clara had kindly served them tea and scones with clotted cream - that was not the sort of woman anyone should be able to get away with shouting at for no good reason.
By mutual agreement, Draco and Harry set out late that afternoon to visit the Christmas market once more – which was a relief because he was cutting it rather close with Christmas presents this year. As they walked, he filled Harry in about the conversation he’d had with Blaise.
Potter chuckled. “Not now. I meant years ago, at the battle. Voldemort, he…” He sighed wearily. “It’s complicated. There were a lot of factors at play, but essentially, he used my blood to resurrect himself, and by doing that, he accidentally tethered me to him. When he killed me but remained alive himself, that tether brought me back. It didn’t take very long – I came back a few seconds later, if that, but I
“Shortly after nine,” said Smith, sounding annoyed. As far as Draco remembered from Hogwarts, that was just his default. “I can’t tell you how long ago that was, I’m currently unable to cast a
“That’s because, if it is what I think it is, it’s pretty much unsolvable unless you’re who the message was meant for.”
“Unfortunately, he spent several years after Hogwarts developing an interest in Runic Divination.” Draco couldn’t see Granger rolling her eyes, but he was certain that’s what she was doing. “It’s a ridiculously obscure field of study that he apparently managed to learn from some witch in Iceland, but our former department head – Adolphius bloody Widdleway, you may have heard of him, he had that scandalous whirlwind romance with Celestina Warbeck shortly after he quit the Ministry because of some ridiculous midlife crisis – well, anyway, he had the grand idea of hiring Zacharias to study the oldest prophecies we have stored here. They go back shockingly far, and some of the earliest ones feature runes in a way that nobody quite understands anymore. Widdleway thought we could decipher and study them and eventually develop revolutionary new divination techniques in some unspecified way that he never really bothered to think about for more than two minutes.”
year common room. Draco rubbed his temples to chase away the beginnings of a headache, and he was contemplating turning in when he saw movement from the corner of his eye. A moment later, Harry crouched in front of him.
“I can’t wait to see everyone again,” Harry told them as he helped himself to another slice of roast beef. “You were right though, I think, to have it wait until after the Christmas chaos. It would have been utter madness if I’d simply shown up at dinner.”
Draco moved to lay it aside, then frowned and took another look because he’d realized that the man looked very, very vaguely familiar. It was the frizzy grey hair that rang a bell, because Draco could remember thinking once upon a time that it took ‘bird’s nest’ to a whole new level – one that looked almost literal, like upon closer inspection, one was likely to find a number of speckled grey eggs, neatly cushioned. It had prompted Draco to, for his own amusement, take a seat higher up in the auditorium where the…oh, right, the man had been a special guest lecturer, talking about –
“I do, yes. You should talk about it with him as well though – I might not have time to talk him through the logic of it whenever it ends up being relevant.”
Anyway, a very-similar-to-a-romantic-gesture non-romantic gesture seemed like something that might fix Harry’s huge screw-up.
“Oh, no, not at all. But I am worried that the unicorn hair core is going to react badly with the flavorings. The basil, especially. Unicorns aren’t very fond of it, after all, and if my spellwork is off, I won’t get the balance just right.”
Draco sat up straight when something occurred to him. Could he do it differently this time around? Was that possible? Could he try to kiss Potter and, depending on how it went, persuade him to add to Draco’s coded message, so at least he wouldn’t try it again if Potter hadn’t reacted well? The thought was utterly terrifying. He didn’t want to put himself out there, not one bit, but at least time would reset eventually, and he wouldn’t have to live with the humiliating memory until the end of his days.
“As long as you answer our questions and tell the truth, we will not share anything outside of the department. You have my word.”
They had been talking for a quarter of an hour and gotten through about half of the material they needed to cover when something occurred to Harry.
Draco knew all of that, but he couldn’t deny it helped a bit to hear it from someone else as well. “Thanks. It’s just…she was so young. It’s hitting me harder than usual.”
“Schrödinger’s…it has to do with a cat, and physics, and…never mind. What I mean is, Ron is right, the spell must think there’s two of you, in a way. It can’t decide which age actually belongs to you – the one before time started looping, or the one that includes all of the loops you’ve gone through. They can’t both be true, but for some reason, the spell thinks they are.”
“There has got to be some sort of explanation,” said Victoria, safely on the other side of the room and facing the wall, so she wouldn’t have to look at what Draco was doing. He couldn’t really blame her – she did not have Draco’s training, so he wouldn’t have expected her to have developed the clinical detachment that allowed him to cut open a corpse and take samples. He still didn’t like the experience, but it wouldn’t give him nightmares.
“Do you really think that’ll turn the memory of me rambling on about pureblood nonsense into something I’ll look back on fondly?
but most of them had happened back at Hogwarts, when he hadn’t been more than a self-absorbed child who thought the world owed him everything. He had never had reason to examine their rivalry any closer. Then there had been a war on, and Potter had been his only hope of escaping the nightmare Draco had found himself in, so it had made sense to think about him so much.
She did look stressed. There were bags under her eyes, and her hair was surprisingly messy. But Draco hadn’t seen her since Hogwarts, so he wasn’t sure if she just always wore it like that these days, in a hasty, utilitarian ponytail.
“If you like,” he said, trying to sound unconcerned, but his feelings were betrayed by the scratchiness in his voice.
“Hank is right,” Draco agreed. He was using every opportunity to say the name he’d chosen for Potter’s disguise, mostly because it annoyed Potter to such a delightful degree. “This sort of behaviour is outrageous.”
The Weaselette seems to realize after a moment that she’s holding up traffic, so she takes a step forward, but all her healthy instincts seem to scream at her to stop.
Draco couldn’t suppress a small flinch, and Potter cleared his throat and went to the door. “Yes, Hermione?” he asked.
He invited Draco to walk ahead of him with a ridiculous flourish. They made their way to the lifts, and Draco wasn’t afraid to admit he was looking forward to daylight and fresh air. He had no idea how the Unspeakables managed to work in these oppressive surroundings day in and day out.
"Oh, this'll be good." Hermione tuned the letter over a few times as though to check everything was in order, then slipped it into the mail slot.
They constructed implausible theories almost the entire way to the market, but once they had reached it, Harry changed topics.
with which to measure the rate of recovery. “We’ll have a few days of potions and healing spells ahead of us before that’s likely to happen.”
“I didn't tell her it was you! I just... well, I described to her what happened, and she said that it was possible for pain to release endorphins, and-”
“Oh. Well, can you wait until next Wednesday?” Theo asks eagerly. “Because then I’d win the betting pool.”
Draco’s lungs burned as he sucked in air trying to calm himself. His head spun. He couldn’t think, couldn’t grasp on to any solid thought, because if Potter wasn’t dead then which truths were even still safe?
“Yes, it is,” Clara confirmed. “She’d just finished a work meeting, three gentlemen from Games and Sports. She talked to me for a moment, and then she went back into her office. I checked on her…maybe fifteen minutes later? And that’s when I found her lying on the floor.”
She looked honestly thrilled about ‘Muggle Methods for Magical Maternity’, which was a relief. “A friend of mine at St Mungo’s wrote it,” he explained. “It’s an advance copy, actually – she was kind enough to owl it.”
“We need a good cover.” Draco runs his fingers through his hair. They aren’t entirely steady. “Maybe…maybe we should pretend we’ve caught the insanity bug too.”
Draco carefully read the words over one more time and then Vanished the parchment with a flick of his wand. He had no idea what the message was talking about, and he didn’t think anyone else would either, but it was better to be safe than sorry.
“Since when are you a stickler for rules?” Draco asked absently while he counted out money for the owl service. “You basically ignored them all through Hogwarts.”
When he came home, Potter was there, but he wasn’t the only one. Susan Bones was sitting in the kitchen with him, tear tracks drying on her face as they talked.
“We didn’t even know who it was at first,” said Smith. “Obviously it wouldn’t have occurred to us that it could possibly be him.”
“I take time for a visual inspection through the wards every morning, but Anton and I always do maintenance together, and he’s been in Lithuania. He and I are the only ones who can access the cubes.”
“Not hungry,” Draco responded succinctly, and dipped his quill in the ink. But Potter didn't let it go.
“No,” Kingsley Shacklebolt said, kneeling in front of him. He studied Harry for a long moment and then slowly said, “Explain.”
“Me too,” Draco admits. Then he scowls, because agreeing with Potter isn’t exactly normal either, and does a good job of ramming his bony shoulder into Potter’s as he walks past him.
her? She never managed to decode the other message you wrote on your arm for her even though she tried every word she could think of.”
Draco stared at his hands and tried to figure out why he wasn’t just walking away from her. Hearing news about Harry was what did it – he was like an addiction, and simply hearing the name flooded Draco with a warmth he hadn’t felt in days. Merlin, he
“How exactly does Granger claim to know this?” Draco asked once they were seated, both clutching mugs that contained more Firewhisky than tea.
“Accio card!” Pansy called, poking her wand in a direction that seemed altogether random. Nothing happened, and she shrugged at the incredulous look Draco gave her. “Well, it was worth a try.”
“No.” Draco admitted. “I haven’t talked to him at all since it happened. I left for work earlier than normal so I could avoid him.”
“You gave my friend Pansy and me a lecture once when we had a shouting match in the corridor,” he said, though an explanation probably wasn’t needed. He was too tired to care.
“Oh, well, that makes it all better,” Draco said blandly. He opened his eyes and stared out into the darkness. The lights in the room weren’t on, so he was able to make out the broad shapes of the houses across the street.
"Breathe, yeah?" Harry touched his hand, pulled out his wand and started on his way down one of the corridors. Draco stood frozen in the entrance chamber for a five-count, then took several deep breaths.
Harry couldn’t help but agree. The rain had mostly stopped by now, but it was still wet and cold and thoroughly unfriendly outside. He reached for his wand and cast several drying, cleaning and warming charms on himself and Draco, and on the bed as well because he was hopeful that there would be a good long bout of snuggling.
Theo whistles lewdly, causing Draco to give him a dirty look. “To plot revenge on all of these idiots?”
Draco hates how much sense it all makes, now that he really thinks about it. “Wait,” he says when something occurs to him. “So what were you and Weasley talking about in the hallway then, Theo?”
“I think so.” There was movement, and Potter dropped to the tiles, sitting comfortably. “Does it matter?”
“It was horrible,” she said, sitting slumped in her kitchen chair. “He shouted it, right in the atrium. Everyone heard. It’s not even true!”
“It’s time, dear audience,” says Ron. “This is the contestants’ final chance at improving their overall score. As a reminder, the bottom two from this weekend will be eliminated, and the top six will bake once again for us two weeks from now.”
Harry, whose spell had also been stopped, slowly lowered his wand and said with dread in his voice, “That’s from a barrier cube, isn’t it?”
Draco had, in fact, been thinking that exact thing. “Makes the room feel quite cosy. Should be popular during the holiday season.”
“What’s the story with these, anyway?” Harry asked into the ensuing silence. He was holding a ‘W’-shaped candy cane and regarding it from every angle.
“That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard, Draco,” Potter says, obviously so shocked that he’s accidentally calling Draco by the wrong part of his name. “They’re house-elves, they don’t
“Sounds promising,” Blaise said. “Luckily, I’m wearing this very official uniform and am not afraid to use it. Let’s go fetch our cloaks, no sense in wasting time.”
Draco shook his head and glanced at Hermione, who was thoughtfully staring down at a red and white striped ring and chewing her lip.
They hurried to get to the closest side street so they could apparate, then from the St Mungo’s lobby up to the ward where Draco worked. He knew that things hadn’t gone as well as he’d hoped as soon as they entered Bones’ room and saw the faces of everyone in it – the two Aurors, Victoria, a glamoured Harry and Susan Bones herself, who was sitting up in her bed and regarding them with a dazed, lost look on her face
“This was supposed to be my last day, Draco,” she said. “Has something else come up? Are you going to need me here for longer? I want to return to my life of leisure, damn it.”
As the delicious stinging sensation made Draco's eyes water, Potter stood there, watching him silently. Eventually, he opened his mouth, sighed, and then asked, “Would it help if I pulled your hair again?”
Draco looked up at him. Potter was standing there, wringing his hands, looking as anxious as Draco had ever seen him – and considering they’d faced each other during a war, that was saying something.
Both Harry and Draco knew the policemen were simply waiting for the guests to go to their rooms before buggering off. Useless bastards. It may be a few acts of 'mindless vandalism' to them, but to Harry, Draco and most of the guests, it was an attack. Pure and simple.
“I'm going to take a break. I'm sorry; I'm not telling you where. If nobody knows, nobody can know.” Harry thought his reasoning was brilliant and nodded happily to himself. “I'll see you in two weeks,” he said, standing up to leave.
to go, but another feeling crept up as he caught sight of the tag line under the truly horrid picture of a witch and a wizard happily skipping hand-in-hand through a field of lilacs: hope.
When Draco called and cancelled plans with friends during training, they had all asked his the same question. Draco would always have the same answer. He had worked bloody hard, and of course it was bloody worth it. When he had earned his stripes and was out helping people, it would all be worth it.
Harry didn't quite know what to make of the man standing awkwardly in his kitchen. He was wearing the casual clothes he'd come to expect from Draco, but he was spectacle-less and he had the same worried look on his face that he'd seen on Malfoy's face in the cafeteria hours earlier.
“Now, I want each of you to go off with your partner—out of earshot if you'd prefer—and write something about yourself that the other person doesn't know. It doesn't have to be a secret, but it has to be something important to you. You will then share it with your partner. Remember, nothing you share here can be repeated outside of these grounds. After we've finished, your partner will burn your secret in the bin and, therefore, promise to keep it forever.”
“What the fuck, Bob?” Hedwig knew how she looked to the human population, all white feathers and pure beauty, but she had spent the last seven years living with Harry Potter. She wasn't innocent by any stretch of the imagination.
After you'd stood up in court for me and my mother, I'd tried to talk to you, to thank you, but I couldn't get near you. I hoped my nod would be enough until I saw you next, but I hadn't given a thought to it being so soon.
“No! Of course not,” Zach replied quickly, shaking his head. “I'm just feeling unwell. I think I'll call it a night. Harry, I'll owl you tomorrow. Goodnight.”
Harry hated surprises. He always had done. Hermione told him once that it was probably due to him never having any nice surprises as a child, and then even nastier ones as a teenager. So, now, as an adult, Harry hated them with a passion.
The days after he and Draco had first had sex were some of the hardest days of Harry's working life. It had been an amazing night—Draco turned out to be, as Harry imagined, an amazing lover—and Harry couldn't stop smiling.
“Um...” Pig hid behind Crookshanks. Poking his head around her bushy tail, he squeaked out, “I lost him.”
Harry thought he'd only been asleep for five minutes, when he was awoken by the unmistakeable sound of his kettle boiling and his bloody biscuit tin being raided. A quick glance at the clock showed that he'd actually been asleep for close to two hours, and Brewin was no longer snuggled on his lap.
Harry simply didn't like not knowing what was going to happen. He didn't like blind dates for the same reason. Harry had been set up on blind date after blind date in the recent weeks. No one would—or could—understand why Harry wasn't in a relationship. Harry had tried to tell them that he'd found the perfect man, and that he just needed to pluck up the courage to ask him out. Harry was scared of his man's response. All in all, Harry hated surprises.
Draco laughed as relief ran through him. Regardless of his and Harry's actions and words of the past three days, he really was worried that Harry was going to change back as soon as they left.
Maybe Draco had been staring for too long. “Sorry, just admiring your t shirt. I, um, like the colour.”
In private though, it was perfect. Harry became quite close with my friends, as evidenced by his use of the pet name 'Panto' for Pansy. It was apparently an inside joke between the two of them, stemming from a Muggle thing with horses. I have no idea, but it made Pansy and Harry smile, so I left them to it.
“I'm not looking for, nor will I accept, a holiday fling just for you to toss me aside when we arrive back in Britain.”
Draco dropped Harry's hand and ran towards Grumpy Waiter, Harry following closely behind. Harry could hear the police ordering the attackers to the ground and smiled at Grumpy Waiter.
“For fuck's sake.” Harry dropped his head into his hands before sighing and lifting his head to look at Zach. “I meant normally—for day to day stuff. If they come up to you and want you to talk about how we're
Harry shrugged and clinked his glass to Draco's. Champagne for a ball in the groin. He could cope with that.
Harry ran straight through the opulent—thankfully open—doors of the Ministry and tried to run straight though the lobby.
“Who's up for some party dances to break the ice?” Glinda called as music started playing, from where, Draco didn't know.
The moment Draco woke up, he wished he hadn't. Yes, he'd slept all night, and well, but he felt as if he'd been kicked in the head by a hippogriff. His mouth tasted like something had crawled in during the night and died, and his right arm was numb. As he finally managed to open his eyes, Draco realised why.
“Ah, good. I wasn't sure, and I didn't want to offend. Now, follow me, please. We need to begin.” Turning on the spot, she raised her voice. “Everyone, please. We'll have plenty of time for chit-chat later. Let's get this party started!”
The kiss deepened and Harry felt Draco's hands moving further downwards. The feel of skin-on-skin was getting too much for him to bear and Harry gasped against Draco's mouth. The need to do
. Harry wasn't crazy; he was sure of that. He surreptitiously had himself tested not long after his first meeting with Draco.
It had been, surprisingly, his own sister that had finally dragged his head out of his arse when it came to Harry and Draco. Ginny had sat both him and Hermione down the night before they were due to return home, and told them how utterly disgusted she was in the pair of them.
I'd spoken up at her trial and told the world that I wouldn't have succeeded in killing that noseless bastard without her. Despite this, people ignored her and shunned her in the streets and I didn't like it, but I didn't know how to fix it.
Draco took a sip of wine. “Okay. Because I talked about, um, you so much in school, they thought I fancied you.”
Harry did laugh at that. He mimed zipping his lips and Pansy looked confused. “Get your thrills elsewhere. You’re not getting anything out of me.”
Ron finished by smiling brightly at Hermione. She smiled sweetly in return, but Harry could tell she hadn't missed Ron's slip.
Draco's plans never worked. Harry was once again under a Disillusionment Charm—with the addition of a last minute
where I used to have my breakfast. But it was expected—demanded—of us to follow in the footsteps of our parents. And tough shit if you didn't like it. They were bad guys first and our parents second, as they weren't adverse to a little torturing to get what they wanted. My mother—and Pansy's—did try to protect us, but the bastards didn't mind hurting children, so they didn't think for a second before hurting anyone else.
be needing to look his best. Draco would more than likely want to go somewhere upmarket and Harry didn't want to be feeling out of place. And his own delivery of green goo hadn't arrived yet.
They quietly walked past the night porter, who was talking frantically into the phone, and made their way to the stairs.
If Draco wasn't too busy staring in disbelief at Ron, he might have found the look on Harry's face hilarious.
“If you've finished,” Glinda voice startled them, and they both turned to face her, “bring your parchment to the front so we can get to the fun part!”
“I'm getting there; calm down. We arrived at the Ministry—with full back up; the Saviour insisted—just as Smith emerged from an alley, wand drawn. He did manage to shoot off the spell, but Watts managed to tackle him to the ground at the same moment, causing the spell to veer off course.”
As Harry closed the door on the final customer of the day, he looked around and smiled. Harry didn't think his life could get any better. He had his café, his friends, a brilliant boyfriend and now his new house. What more could he want?
Draco walked back to his desk in silence, unable to take his eyes off the leaflet in his hands. He slumped into his chair and threw the offending article across his desk in disgust.
With a loud crack, Draco Disapparated. Harry sat down heavily at the top of the stairs. The unmistakable sound of sex coming from Ron's room gave him no comfort at all. Fuck. Harry didn't know what to do, or where Draco could've gone. He ran through possibilities in his head: Pansy, Blaise, the Manor. Where should he start?
I honestly had no idea. One thing I did know, and what confused me the most, was what his attention made me feel. I tried my hardest to ignore what was happening, but as I tossed and turned at night, unable to sleep—nightmares, you know—my mind invariably turned to Potter and how things had changed in the space of one school term.
All that was left to do was to find the bastard behind the attacks, and then Harry and Draco could relax for the remainder of their break. They had discussed leaving it to the police, but as they had already left '
Harry turned to find his supposed friend. Draco looked slightly apologetic. “You'll see,” Draco mouthed to Harry.
They lay like that for seconds-minutes-hours—Draco couldn't tell exactly how long—kissing and touching and caressing.
It was a fact, tested and proved beyond a doubt. Harry had fallen in love with one of his best friends, only he was the only one that knew about it. You see, Malfoy wasn't Draco, at least not yet.
I'll never forget that petrified look on your face, though. It was hilarious. You looked as if you didn't know whether Pansy was going to hex you or kiss you!
I'd missed my chance in Diagon Alley, so I psyched  myself up to talk to you on the train. I spent hours in front of my mirror—to the utter delight of my prying mother—perfecting exactly what I was going to say.
Harry rolled his eyes, smiled at Draco and turned to listen. From the last story Ginny had told them, Harry hadn't thought that the demure professor could get any worse. Harry wondered what Neville would think if he knew exactly what secrets his girlfriend spilled when she'd had more than a few glasses of wine.
“Draco,” Harry said, looking straight into his eyes, “I don't know what this is, but I do know that I like you. This—whatever it is—won't stop when we go home. I hope. I promise.”
After a week of torturing himself, Harry realised he did need to talk to someone, so he called Hermione.
“Harry?” Draco didn't know why he was saying it, and he couldn't stop himself from saying it. “Do you remember kissing me before we fell asleep last night?”
The entire table—apart from Zach, who was looking decidedly confused—burst into laughter. Harry choked on his beer and Draco slapped him on the back.
“Of course,” Harry said gesturing to the pictures of the kids on the mantelpiece. “I had them, didn't I?”
“What?” Draco rushed towards him, but Harry moved out of his reach. “Aren't you happy? What have I done? What can I do?”
The two walked in silence to breakfast. Harry couldn't think of where to start and Draco was obviously—if the small smirk on his face was anything to go by—quite amused by the whole situation.
“Thank you, Dean,” Harry said after the applause had died down once more. “It's beautiful, and the title is very fitting. The price we paid for a safe and happy world might have been high, but it
It was when I saw you immediately after you'd rid us of the Dark Lord once and for all that I realised that I needed to say something, anything—
Harry woke to a fuzzy head and an empty bed. He never liked waking up on his own, and had been hoping for a round of morning sex. As he felt Draco's side of the bed and realised it was cold, Harry remembered what had transpired the previous night.
“You're supposed to be watching Harry!” Darius was about ready to make good his earlier threat and throw him from a window with his wings tied behind his back.
Some of my friends—people I'd known forever—relished following their lead. Especially Vincent and Greg. I'm pretty sure they simply loved the feeling of power. They were weak, and obviously thought that torturing twelve year old kids made them powerful. Idiots.
“So,” Draco drawled, propping his head onto his hands in an obvious attempt to stay awake, “we'll do one of those stake thingies.”
Dinner was, once again, fantastic. Good food and good wine; he really was going to go home two stone heavier. Food finished, Harry sat back in his chair and relaxed. “More wine?” he asked his companion.
Malfoy smiled. “I wanted a holiday, but couldn't decide on where to go; Pansy had been pestering me so I had to make a snap decision. I got hold of as many brochures as I could find, threw them in the air and grabbed one at random,” Malfoy explained. “What about you? How did you decide on this place?”
The afternoon was earmarked for 'Team Exercises' and Draco didn't want to get his hopes up. He really hoped it was couple versus couple, as he weirdly wanted to show everybody exactly how well he and Harry worked together.
—Ginny had become Draco Malfoy's biggest fan, but after listening to her passionately defending him and telling them how he alone had made Harry truly happy again, he thought he might have made a mistake.
didn’t want to be coming just yet. When he thought that he could continue without immediately coming, Harry released Draco’s hips and wrapped his still-slick hand around Draco’s cock, fisting it in time to Draco’s rhythm.
—he and Draco had worked together pretty well. They had quickly despatched Elderly Couple and were well on their way to beating Giggly Girls three sets to nothing. Apparently, Malfoys
Harry's hand tightened their grip on Draco's thighs, but he stayed silent. Draco couldn't breathe; he wanted to take it back, worried that he'd messed everything up.
Draco stopped himself before he said any more. It was too early to be falling back into their old bickering routine. A knock on the door helpfully stopped Potter as he opened his mouth, probably to insult Draco, he thought.
“We can't accept that if we're not going over there,” Harry said. “Tell me we're not going over there?” he added quickly.
“I really think you need to leave me alone. And, please, don't just let yourself in again.” Harry walked out of the kitchen, not looking back, confidant that Draco would do as he asked.
It's late at night when Draco is awoken with a crash. As he opens his eyes he sees a hex slam into the wall. He sits up grasping for his wand. But when he casts a lumos there is only Harry with his wand raised breathing heavily as if he's been in the heat of battle. He turns to point his wand at Draco for a moment before he drops his arm. "It's nothing" Harry says falling on his bed and quickly turning himself away from Draco.
He tries to focus on the book but his mind won't stop racing. No matter how hard he tries he feels fidgety and anxious. He bounces his leg trying to force himself to read but it's no use. Even under normal circumstances he disliked studying in the library. It feels far too open, as if someone might sneak up on him from anywhere. He much preferred reading on his bed surrounded by his plants, though that was far more relaxing when he was with other slytherins.
They don't speak through three more dances but Draco's feet are starting to ache and surely hers do as well. He smiles politely and holds out his hand once the song is finished. "Would you care to join me for a stroll in the garden?" He asks with a falsely chipper tone.
By the time he finishes all of his classes and is trudging back to his dorm he can only hope that Harry and his gang are gone. In his corridor he feels a tap on his shoulder and he startles spinning around. Pansy is looking at him haughtily, her arms crossed over her chest and her nose in the air. "Not that you deserve to know after abandoning us but Crabbe and Goyle are leaving school." She says and it takes a moment to register with him.
"And what if she isn't better by tomorrow? Do you think we'll be blamed?" She asks and he shrugs, her head jostled as he does. "They'll blame me, and if that happens then I've never heard your name in my life." He says seriously and she grins. "I can talk to that little reporter if you want, I'm very convincing with a wand in my hand." She says and he reaches a hand over to pat her head "Thanks Pans, you don't have to do that though."
He folds the letter and tucks it away into the pocket of his robes. He doesn't have to think about where he's going, he just calmly stands as not to attract the attention of the group across the room and heads for the door. He needs advice even if the only people he can trust are those he is forbidden to speak to.
He sighs and pens a letter telling her about his new classes and the irony of being roommates with Harry Potter. She'll likely tell him to try to befriend Potter at all costs, but if he were to omit that fact then it would feel like he was lying. And after thanking her for the potions and sending his love he rolled up the letter and tied it to the owl's leg.
It is squat and the door is painted a ghastly shade of orange. With trepidation the group of them follow behind Pansy. Lining the walls are clothes of different colors and sizes. In a cloak shop you get the choice of three silhouettes, several muted colors, and perhaps a few accessories. Other than cufflinks and a nice tie cloaks were meant to show craftsmanship. The soft materials, the perfectly stitched lines, it was the tiny details that mattered. Even with girls cloaks they were nearly the exact same, though they at times got to skip the cloak and opt for a gown for special occasions. But it seems these muggle clothes are full of color and every single thing is different.
