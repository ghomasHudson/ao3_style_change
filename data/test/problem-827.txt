"To be honest, I don't really remember them," Harry admitted. "They're usually clear for a minute or two after they wake me up, then they just sort of fade away."
"I wasn't actually sure if I wanted to see it through, to be honest," he confessed as Malfoy leaned forwards, a look of interest on his face. "But when I saw the proficiency with which Camilla handled everything, I decided it was worth the shot."
have to come along?" James whined as he walked backwards a little ahead of his siblings and Harry, hands folded behind his head.
Draco rose to his feet, walking away from the chattering witches, his heart racing from what he had heard.
He chuckled to himself as he walked back into the office, grinning at everybody and throwing around compliments as he made it back to his desk. Looks like downing all of that Firewhiskey hadn't been such a bad decision after all.
His patience drawing thin, Draco decided that he would save the man the trouble of firing him—and salvage what little pride he had left—and pulled off his overalls. Throwing it on the floor, more for show than as an act of defiance, he said, “Seeing as how we’ve reached the point of no-return, I may as well remind you that your decrepit old shop only survived this long thanks to me.” Satisfied when the man’s face went red and he spluttered in anger, Draco looked down his nose and shot him a contemptuous smile. “I shall see myself out, then. Good day, Mr Palmer.”
He watched Albus make a flag with leaves and hand it over to Lily, who promptly broke it. "Did they eat their breakfast yet?" Harry asked.
for the other to say something. Ginny finally sighed before disconnecting the call. Harry stared at the screen for a long moment before pocketing the phone. He hated it when things were like this.
"Why can't you fall asleep here?" Draco asked despite himself. He had divulged a little too much of his best kept secrets to the other man over the past two days and thought it right that he get a few juicy tidbits in return.
"It's just," she finally began, after fiddling around with random things kept on the counter. "Angie said something a few weeks ago… and I thought it would be a good idea…"
He crouched behind a tree and peered around it to gauge the extent of his husband’s transformation. What he saw made his blood run cold.
I sigh again as I reach down to clean off my shoes and decide to wait until the next stop to have a chat with the driver.
Ginny and he had been having problems with regards to the kids attending pre-school ever since an incident a month prior. James had gotten upset that his teachers wouldn't let him play in the Little Quidditch League because he'd nearly broken his arm from losing control over his broom and crashing into the hoops, and in the process of throwing a tantrum, he'd unknowingly used accidental magic, shattered all the windows in the school, and injured a lot of the teachers and children in the process.
A sudden thought occurred to Harry, and before he could stop himself, he blurted out, "I'm sure all your clients use aliases when they first correspond with you, right?"
"I've heard from Camilla that you would like to be assigned to a different Healer," Malfoy said without looking up from rearranging the sheets.
"I see." Malfoy placed a finger to his chin and looked towards the quill and parchment. The quill paused mid-stroke, hovered in the air for a moment, and commenced writing at an even faster pace. Malfoy continued to stare at it as though he was mentally dictating whatever it wrote. After a moment, he turned back to Harry, eyes like liquid silver, and asked in a soft voice, "Do you remember what the first nightmare was about?"
Harry bit back a sigh and tried to relax his features as he asked, "So what can I do for you then, Minister?"
Harry was about to reply when he noticed Mason waving to him. He was holding up a paper bag and mouthed the word
"While I respect the fact that you sleep better on sofas, it would make me uncomfortable to kick the owner of the house out of his own bed," Draco said relaxedly, although the true reason for his insistence was that Macnair's face at the side of the bed was still fresh in memory. He didn't trust himself to be able to shut his eyes if he were alone in the room.
"Please, tell her to take another day off. No, actually, tell her to take the rest of the week off, if she pleases. The longer she's gone, the better for the rest of us."
Harry nodded, his forgotten nervousness coming back with full force. "Well, where do you want me to start?"
"As long as you put him in his place," the girl muttered, throwing a disdainful look in Buxley's direction.
She handed him the file and stood up, eyeing him expectantly. Harry shook his head. "You know I can't do that. Especially not after you just confirmed all of my suspicions."
He scanned the rest of the letter idly, stifling a yawn as he settled back in the armchair, sleep tugging at his exhausted mind.
Malfoy nodded, the usual thoughtful expression on his face. "Isn't one your brother-in-law's wife also on the team?"
Harry sighed as he looked over all the information he had once more. Pacing up and down his office, he flipped to the final page of the file, staring down at the one name that was causing him more distress than anything or anyone had in a very long time.
Draco took the teacup from him and placed it on a side table, reaching out to caress Harry's chin gently. "Ah, you humans," he mused in the same singsong voice, "you never fail to amuse me with your fragile minds and bodies, always so weak in asserting your will and quick to succumb to a stronger one." Harry sat up straighter, his ears ringing, his mind whirring in confusion as he tried to sort through the information overflowing from his memory of the past several hours. "Do not worry," Draco continued, as though reading his mind, "you won't remember a single thing when you return to your world."
Harry laughs, and I find myself looking away, still too tentative about reciprocating his unbridled happiness. I catch myself even as that thought slips through my mind, and I have the startling realisation that it was never how happy Harry was that I disliked, but rather it was my constant choice to remain unhappy that I loathed. And Harry's happiness was a continuous reminder of my own, self-inflicted unhappiness.
"Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!" the lad yelled, getting to his feet and running towards where the rest were trying to steady the anchor, slipping and almost falling over in the process.
When his mother hesitated, he finally looked up at her. “What, did they refuse to reveal their identity until we meet in person?”
"It's not every day that you get to sit down and relax and have some Firewhiskey with your tea," she answered as she brought out a glass for herself.
The 'Realm of Monsters', as Draco liked to call it, was indeed a world separate from Harry's own, but the so-called
She tutted softly, and Draco scoffed. “Considering they’re willing to take in someone like me, I suppose we have no choice but to acquiesce to their demands,” he said in a mocking tone.
A moment later, Astoria and Blaise appeared, and, with a strangled cry, the witch threw herself at her son, besides herself with joy. "Oh, my love!" she cried. "Oh, my precious boy!"
Draco frowned and pushed away from the other man. "I know! I know, OK? You don't have to rub it in."
Harry shared a look with Hermione and then jerked his chin towards his office. She nodded and bustled off, muttering to herself.
The bespectacled man apologises again, but I've long since stopped paying attention to him, and once I'm back from confirming that I am, indeed, on the right route, he informs me that his stop has arrived. I return his sheepish smile with a forced one of my own, glad to have rid myself of his irksome presence, and return to my brooding. I remain that way until the bus pulls up at my stop, and I hurry to disembark, more than unhappy that the first day of my so-called new life had gotten off to such a great start.
The moment Harry moved forwards, however, he instantly knew what she meant. He shivered slightly as the warm, tingling sensation of the rather subtle Muggle-Repelling Charm swept over him, leaving his extremities feeling sensitive.
Despite all his resistance, he had closed the shop at exactly quarter to eight and walked next door. Pushing open the door to the dimly lit bakery, he walked to the back and peeked in.
He woke up screaming for mercy, legs flailing and hands clutching his throat. Spluttering and sobbing, he jumped out of bed and crawled to the corner of the room. He pressed his back against the cool wall and heaved, throwing up all over himself. Sobbing and gagging, his eyes frantically searched the room, tears streaming down his face, and he swore he could hear the cackling of a madman.
They fell into an easy friendship revolving around their love for baked goods—or, in Draco's case, his love for Harry's baking. The months turned into years, and their relationship turned into something neither of them had really anticipated or wanted. They didn't dare define it, but it was there—tangible, but rough around the edges; subtle, but leaving behind a sense of longing.
Placing the suitcase in the boot, Harry slammed it shut and turned around to face Hermione—who now had a worried frown on her face.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. "He had to live his entire life in hiding because of his father's decision to join the Death Eaters. He almost died, once, when someone that had seen Macnair Sr saw the son and realised that if they looked that similar, they may be related. After that, he's been laying low, plotting his vengeance on you, who got away, and the three others who he apparently hated for various reasons."
Draco tried to see what expression she had on her face but it was too dark to tell. "Who are you looking for?"
The flames shot up again, and Hermione stepped out this time with Albus and Lily clinging onto her on either side. They dashed out of the fireplace and jumped towards Harry, and he caught them with a laugh as they wrapped their arms around him and hugged him tight.
She then sat back and hummed, a sort of disinterested look on her face, as though she was disappointed that the meeting wouldn't go on for very long.
Draco was about to argue, but he could hear some commotion in the background. "Sorry, some kid seems to have spilt his drink. I'll see you soon, OK? Bye!"
Both children started talking at once, and he nodded, barely listening to whatever great crime Lily had committed that James couldn't forgive.
Hermione nodded as she straightened her skirt. The enchanted voice announced their destination, and she turned to him. "Right, then."
She immediately withdrew and regained her nervous, hesitant demeanour from the previous day. "Why would you think I knew where he was?" she asked, her voice shrill.
Harry laughed at the exasperation in her voice before standing up and walking to the door. "Looks like it's working." He placed his hands on the doorframe and leaned out to yell, "Jamie!"
Harry sighed tiredly, rubbing his face with his hands. His hour-long nap hadn't helped in any way. In fact, he was even more exhausted after it than he had been that morning.
He raised his eyebrows at the snarky reply, and she sighed, massaging her temples. "Sorry, I just… I guess it's the stress of the tournament getting to me."
Harry walked down the footpath, humming to himself. He had ended up arriving an hour earlier than he was supposed to, and he didn't know what to do to while away the time. The place where he was supposed to meet Camilla was on the other side of town, nowhere close to the previous one, and he was glad. He was sure that girl from last time would recognise him instantly, considering he was in the same disguise, and he didn't want to have to endure
With a startling realisation, he turned, jumping back in shock at the form lying in bed next to him. There was some rustling as the man turned, the sunlight making his pale skin and tousled hair glow like a statue sculpted out of the purest marble.
James nodded, and Harry patted him on the head. As he turned around and made his way back to the entrance he heard James say, "No, they won't eat you if you don't go near them."
He sighed. There was something going on that he didn't know about and he had a feeling that both Angelina
the place! Wait 'til you see my article. I found out the most gossip-worthy news about the Bats' Seeker. It would make even Skeeter burn with envy."
She was reaching for the glass of water, and he helped her with it, placing it to her mouth and tilting it as she gulped down every last drop. She sighed, her eyes fluttering shut, and he Transfigured the cushion into a blanket, draping it over her and tucking her in.
Harry chuckles. "You know, now that we've properly spoken, I realise that first impressions really are deceiving."
Heart beginning to race, Harry immediately crossed off Silver Sprigs from the list in his head, before calming down and deciding that it was ridiculous to reject a pre-school simply because Malfoy's son went there.
Harry knocked on the door to Buxley's hospital room, a small bouquet of flowers in his hand. As he waited, he rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet, nervous and anxious at the prospect of having to face Buxley's wife. He'd never met the woman before, but from the Howler he'd received, and Buxley's constant complaining, he was under the assumption that she wasn't a very pleasant person. And of all the ways to meet her, it had to be the one situation that he dreaded the most.
Harry grimaced as he understood the implication behind what Ron had just said. "I know she knows, I just—" he broke off with a shrug, and Ron nodded.
"Where'd that runt run off to, eh? Who's seen him, then?" the man bellowed, waving the rolling pin around rather violently. People moved away from the shop, looking wary, and Harry was about to join them when the Muggle caught his arm.
Harry pursed his lips, shook his head, leaned in to peck Draco on his fish mouth, and then went back to polishing his Head Auror badge. Draco fitted his chin on Harry’s shoulder and hummed contentedly.
He expected that to placate her some, at least, but she only shook her head again. Frustrated by his inability to understand his own daughter, Harry wracked his brains, thinking of some way to resolve this issue whose cause he had no idea of.
Harry nodded and thanked Ron before pulling his head out. He remained on his knees for a long moment, lost in thought as he stared into the burning coals, and finally reached up to grab a handful of Floo powder. He tossed it onto the firewood, stuck his head in, and muttered, "Silver Sprigs Montessori."
"I wasn't asleep," he muttered, wiping drool from the side of his mouth and rising to his feet shakily.
Harry's shoulders slumped slightly, and Malfoy must have noticed because he said, "But, I'm sure it would be alright if you were to attend as my plus one."
shut the window. In a moment of panic, he opened his eyes, only to come face to face with a man who looked so much like his father that it felt like Draco was reliving his nightmares all over again.
The goblin took the keys, eyed them for a moment to make sure they were real, and handed them back to Harry. He then picked up his quill and wrote down something before jumping down from his stool and looking up at Harry.
"James, we don't name-call," Harry warned, reaching over to grab the seven-year-old by the arm and swivel him around so he faced forwards as they reached Gringotts. "Don't you have something else to say to your sister?"
They nodded hurriedly as they started to change out of their pyjamas. Harry helped Lily into her frock and sweater before they zoomed out of the room and down the stairs.
In-between the bookshelves and the desk were the coffee table and the sofas, where he was currently seated, and opposite him was the door, on either side of which were large paintings of scenic views, and tall, elegant tables holding vases stood below them. Behind him, the room was cordoned off using those delicate-looking foldable, wooden partitions that were usually found in the bedrooms of rich noblewomen. He couldn't really see through the intricate carvings in the wooden dividers, but he could vaguely tell that it was a rest area of some sort.
Heart racing, he swallowed and wondered if it really was such a bad idea to tell her right then and get over with it. Maybe she wouldn't have much time to think about it, and he'd be able to convince her that it wasn't that big of a deal and that he had it under control.
They nodded fervently, and Harry smiled as James reached for his siblings' hands and squeezed them. "Good. Jamie, I trust that you'll keep an eye on your brother and sister?"
Draco's jaw dropped, and he glanced between the outstretched hand and the man behind it for a long moment, unsure of how to react. Potter grimaced and retracted his arm. "Sorry. That must've surprised you. I just—never mind."
The one day I want to close up shop early is the day I'm swamped with customers. People drop into the shop every few minutes, and even if they don't buy anything, they simply walk around to admire the flower arrangements around the shop that I'd spent the past several weeks perfecting. Although I'm disappointed that my promise to drop by the bakery will have to wait, I'm thrilled to have my hard work acknowledged.
She shook her head. "No, the party went fine, it's just—I don't know, I guess I should've just come clean about what I planned on doing from the beginning."
Harry shook his head slowly, feeling a sense of numbness spread through him with the warmth of the wine. The corners of his vision were blurring, and he felt nauseous. His heartbeats were painful, and as he watched Camilla dry her eyes and force a smile onto her face, he felt like a part of him was slowly dying.
"The reason we keep getting a fictional location when we try to track the traces in these Floo disappearances is because someone has manipulated the destination of the trace to show us the non-existent town of Camberwick Green," Lee continued, unfazed by the effect he was having on the blond. "But now that we know your son's disappearance is linked to the others, we can use previously compiled evidence to help find him."
"That's why you need to personally lead the investigation, Sir," his deputy said. "We've already been getting flak for not having found the other three missing people yet. Besides," he dropped his gaze, looking guilty, "unlike the others, this one's only a child."
"Oh, no, please. You really don't have to bother," Harry replied, rather embarrassed, but Malfoy waved away his refusal.
"Didn't have a choice." He crinkled his nose. "Apparently finishing my education is all my mother cares about."
Crying out in frustration, he ripped the parchment to shreds and threw it aside, kicking the corpse angrily.
Harry finds himself face-to-face with Mind Healer Draco Malfoy and is unable to understand why he's so irritated despite the fact that Malfoy was being nothing but polite and patient with him.
He smiled and took a half-bow. "I'll make it the best bouquet your girlfriend has ever received." As she giggled, he picked up a small card from the holder on the counter and pushed it towards her. "If you leave your details here, I'll contact you and let you know when you can come pick them up. It shouldn't be longer than an hour."
"Yeah, I guess…" he trailed off, his heart pounding in his chest. His mind was pushing him to tell her about the nightmares and Antares, but he was forcing himself not to.
She paused again, and Harry felt a lump form in his throat. He could hear the sounds of people screaming and begging for their lives, and he quickly dispersed those thoughts. This wasn't about him. This was about her.
Once the Muggle walked away, Camilla turned back to him, and Harry instantly noticed that she seemed rather nervous. His heart beginning to race, he tried to seem as nonchalant as possible as he waited for her to breach the subject of why she had asked to meet with him.
Neville snorted as he handed Harry his clothes—now warm and slightly crumpled—and shook his head. "Remind me again why I left the force," he said softly as Robards continued barking orders to everyone.
"Don't start, mate." He nodded towards the entrance as a set of chains clanked loudly. "Here he comes."
to have my sons ride these ridiculous things," she said, tossing the brightly coloured tricycles to the ground.
It took Harry a whole, awkward minute to process that Draco Malfoy, who he couldn't stop picturing in green Quidditch robes, with a sneer on his face, on the Quidditch Pitch, yelling out insults at him, was asking him
Harry sighed. "You're right. I'm sorry. It's just that having to rely on Ron and Hermione and your parents all the time sort of got to me, I suppose."
He broke off abruptly when he felt Harry behind him. The bespectacled man reached over Draco's shoulder to pull his shirt off the hook, and Draco stood frozen, every cell in his body focused on the feeling of the other man pressed up against his back. "Pass me my hairbrush, will you? It's right there," Harry said, his voice low and rumbling right next to Draco's ear.
As mother and son reunited in a teary embrace, Draco came up to Harry and, to his astonishment, pulled him into a rough hug.
Albus yelled right in Harry's ear, and he groaned, rolling off Albus and pulling the blankets over his head.
"He was here before we got here, Sir, and seems to be an acquaintance of Mr Zabini's," the Auror said, nodding to the wizard standing behind Malfoy, looking grim.
Catching his breath, Harry stared unseeingly at the cover of her book and said, "Ginny asked you to go with me?"
He nodded and followed after her, breathing in deeply and feeling a sense of calmness settle over him.
His stomach lurched at that, and he inhaled, leaning back against the wall as he tried to suppress a headache that began to throb through his temples. Ginny was telling Angelina she hadn't found a missed call on the phone's call log, and Angelina was saying maybe she had called the landline connection by accident. Harry still hadn't thought the previous night's events through, and right now, with his hangover, he wasn't about to.
She handed him a letter, and Harry unfurled it quickly, scanning the contents. He raised his eyebrows when he saw who the addressee was, rereading the short letter to see if there was anything specific he should have noticed.
James hesitated for a moment and started to nod before shaking his head. "Gran'pa got it for me, but I painted it!"
Harry shook his head, trying to look as nonchalant as possible, although his heart had started to race. "No, they haven't. In fact, I haven't got one in a while, now. Maybe they're gone."
"We're almost there." Harry cleared his throat, and they continued on their slow trek through the moors, shivering from the November wind that nipped at their exposed necks.
"Well, then, let's move on. I'm sure you want to know who we are, and what Antares is all about." When he nodded, she continued. "Antares is a private organisation that was established five years ago by a certain wizard who was very keen on helping magical folk in need. He trained as a Healer shortly after leaving Hogwarts and chose to branch out as a Mind Healer who specifically dealt with war trauma. Since his patients didn't want their identities to be revealed due to the nature of the help they were seeking and their recognisability in society, he'd meet with them in private and provided consultation whenever requested.
"Please, call me Camilla—or Cam, whichever you prefer. If we're going to do this, we need to break away the formality as much as possible."
Draco shrugged but didn't answer. He looked around, as though trying to find some sort of distraction, and his eyes landed on the kettle on the kitchen counter. "Would you like some tea?" he asked.
She seemed embarrassed, and Harry chuckled. "Not at all. I don't really have half as much to talk about, anyway. Oh, and I heard you work somewhere else, now?"
As though responding to my mounting frustration, the bus slowly turns the corner and eases to a stop in front of me, hissing like a deflating balloon as it lowers itself closer to the ground and the doors swing open.
"Why? Fleur'll be staying till next weekend, right? Why not just let the kids spend time with little Lou and Nicki? They'll have nothing to do at home, anyway, and you'll have more peace of mind that way."
She seemed to realise her mistake as soon as the words left her mouth, but the damage had already been done. She blustered and went red in the face, but he pursed his lips and stood, nodding curtly.
Exchanging a glance with Draco, they all trooped out of the room and to the fireplace, where the forensics team was doing their job. The head of the team nodded to Harry. "It's as we suspected, Sir."
"This." She slapped the piece of paper down on the desk and jabbed it with a finger, her brown eyes dancing. "I figured out why the name Barkridge sounded so familiar."
Harry nodded. He was thinking the same thing. First of all, the alleged thieves stole the vase. Harry wasn't sure yet whether or not the perpetrators knew that the vase was a monumental artefact from the war or that it had belonged to the Blacks. And, if they did know, and that was the reason for why they had stolen it in the first place, why'd they come back for a seemingly useless blueprint? Was it because, as Lisa had claimed, they were sending her a warning for going to the authorities?
"No. I was in the office working all night, so they shooed me out at around lunchtime today and told me not to show my face again for a day or two."
Lisa paused, her lower lip quivering, and then said, "Although I tried my hardest, a naïve fifteen-year-old girl will never be taken seriously by anyone. And so, things got very bad...but suddenly, one day, everything started to fall into place." She shook her head, her eyes wide. "I couldn't understand what had happened, but
holding her wand out and illuminating the path ahead. Draco waited a moment, until she was one step ahead of him, before joining her, and that was when a startling realisation hit him: it wasn't Hermione who had been walking ahead of him; it was Draco who had been walking behind her.
Harry saw that Lily was close to tears and Albus was white as a sheet, so he changed directions and made a beeline to the waiting area, where he deposited his kids. Holding up a finger, he looked at each wide-eyed child and said, "You know what's going to happen if you wander off, don't you?"
Everything was blurry, dark vignettes clouding the edges of his vision, and for a moment, he thought he saw something beside him shine. He blinked, and the light was gone, replaced by an odd symbol on the ground his bleeding palm had smudged, leaving him distraught and confused.
Ron nodded as he stepped around the sofa. "Yeah, it was sort of sudden. I thought Bill and Dad could use the extra pair of hands. Plus, my kids wanted to see yours, and I had some time, so I thought why not." He smiled and clapped Harry on the shoulder. "Well, see you later, then. And maybe next time nobody'll be wasted."
Harry stared at him, waiting for an explanation, and when he gave Neville a pointed look, the latter only shrugged.
Ron swore and grumbled something about it being the middle of a working day, and the line went dead. Harry let his arm fall to the side as he leant back against the cool glass front of the restaurant and unfocused his gaze, concentrating on not throwing up. The wine and the food left him feeling dazed and light-headed, which was a welcome relief because he wasn't quite ready to deal with everything Camilla had told him earlier.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Wanker," he muttered, and Ron laughed. Harry nodded his thanks. "See you, mate. Thanks again."
"I don't know, but I can feel her protection dying," Draco said as he caressed a rose, watching as it withered away. He looked up at Harry. "You need to leave. I don't know what will befall me, but I refuse to allow you to share the same tragic fate."
He fingered his wand inside the sleeve of his coat and brought down the glamour on his face as he pretended to peel off a mask. The boy's eyes widened and he took several steps backwards, looking frightened.
He preferred the former of the two because arguing with his wife over the phone when she was half a country away from him made him feel much better. Like they were still just as close as if she had been standing in front of him.
be here for you. So will Ron. So will Ginny." She pulled back to look at him with flushed cheeks and a small smile. "We all love and worry about you very much."
Harry nodded his thanks and made his way to the back of the luxury suite. Pausing at the bedroom doorway, he watched the two Aurors as they went about searching for clues, and motioned to the closest one.
Malfoy bowed his head in apology. When he looked back up, his smile was the same formal, professional one Harry was used to seeing, but his eyes were still glittering with mirth. "I'm sorry. I was only having a bit of fun. I would be delighted to have your company for the evening."
“I’m just saying.” He shrugged, knowing not to continue such a sensitive subject. “Who is it, anyway?”
"Oh, we'll pick them up on the way," Angelina said offhandedly as she waved at them and revved the engine. "Well, see you in a week!"
Harry finished for him and suppressed his sigh with a smile. Their professions seemed to overlap in the strangest of ways, and just as it seemed like Malfoy could read his thoughts, it seemed that he could read Malfoy's thoughts, too.
Draco was stunned. He didn't reply, trying to process everything she had told him. He couldn't begin to imagine the kind of pain she must have gone through to make her own parents forget about her, only to find out that they were missing. He could not have done what she had.
The hallway opened out to a large room with shelves and cupboards in one corner, a bunch of tables and chairs of different sizes in another corner, and lining the walls were shelves that held all sorts of magical toys and the like. The room was brightly lit, the walls were covered with coloured wallpaper, and there were amusing-looking portraits and paintings made by children tacked on the wall. The ceiling had a skylight, so the entire room was well-lit by natural light, and the left side had wall-length glass sliding doors that led to a wide play area in the back, complete with swing-sets and the like.
The air behind Macnair warped, and for a second, Draco was unsure what was happening, but in the next moment, Harry was throwing off his Invisibility Cloak, the tip of his wand pressed to the back of Macnair's neck.
Buxley frowned. "Didn't you call me in here to tell me to take a break and lay off the vandalism case for a while?"
"Boys!" Ginny scolded, hurrying towards them and pushing them back out the way they had come in. "What have I said about cleaning up before coming into the living room?"
"Oh, yes, let's!" Hermione clapped her hands together. "I heard about this little place that I think you'd really like, Harry," she continued, dragging the two of them along.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose in an attempt to quell his annoyance. He watched Malfoy shift, face red, looking angry at whatever question Ramsey was asking them, and Professor Greengrass seemed to recoil, fale pale and tears streaming down her face. Gritting his teeth, Harry strode into the room.
Harry was about to respond when Malfoy's words registered in his mind. "You've been to Grimmauld Place before?" he asked, surprised.
They sat watching the kids run around the garden till Ginny stormed into the kitchen, a tricycle in each hand.
"Lisa. Lisa, hey, look at me." Harry had to bend to the side and block her view of Buxley for her to finally look at him.
"Yes, I'm sure, Buxley. Now, why don't you get your arse home to your wife and kids before I get another owl from her yelling at me for taking away all your precious family time?"
"This is ridiculous," Ginny snapped, and he heard the sound of a door banging. "You complain about me not trusting you enough when you constantly accuse me of—"
The smell of burnt rubber assaulted his nostrils as he skidded his motorbike to a stop. He was jumping off it and reaching for his gun even before he heard the shouts coming from a dingy alleyway. Pressing his back to the grime-coated wall, he focused on steadying his breathing, ears pricked up as he listened.
She only stopped talking when they were in her office, and she handed him a form that had bold lettering across the top that read
"Well, my name is Draconius, and I am the crown prince of this realm," the blond explained, moving away and making another sweeping gesture with his arm. "But please," he held out a hand and Harry took it without a second thought, "call me Draco."
Ron had apparently left to drop Rosie off at her pre-school at around half past eight, after which he'd gotten a Floo call from an excited George saying he'd just made a breakthrough in some new experiment or the other, and had rushed off to the shop. Hermione had taken Hugo home around ten when his fever, that he'd developed the previous night, hadn't settled down, leaving Arthur and Molly to go about their morning chores as they let Harry and his kids sleep in well past eleven. They probably would've slept longer, if not for a bored, and very healthy, Albus, who had pestered them awake.
"Oh, no," Dyers sighed. "It's the exact opposite, in fact. She's doing such a marvellous job that she's making the rest of us look bad! You think I
"Christmas?" the boy whispered, a look of awe on his face. "I've never got a Christmas present before."
"Jamie's been wanting a cycle without training wheels, and Al refuses to get one with them because Jamie doesn't want them." Harry sighed, shaking his head.
Harry pursed his lips at what she was implying but held his tongue, respectful of her wishes. As he rose to his feet, he held his hand out. Padma took one look at it and scoffed. "Please, Harry. We've known each other long enough to not let business get in the way of our friendship."
"I…was just—" she blustered, motioning to the pile of party decorations and the rolled banner under her arm.
"Yeah, we did," Harry admitted, although he didn't really feel like letting it go. He still didn't know why exactly she'd lied about it. "But I want to make sure that there isn't something you're keeping from me, Ginny."
"Thanks for that." He nods and wipes his presumably sweaty palms on the dusty apron I just notice he's wearing. He seems to have only just realised the same because he laughs awkwardly and says, "Forgot to take that off. Well, see you later, then."
"Not really," he began, and Neville leant back, his jaw set, but Harry continued before the other man could interrupt. "I mean, not in the same way as yours, I'm sure. Mine have been steadily getting worse since day one, and this… turn of events… just added to it, is all."
"Yeah, yeah, I am threatened by you in all your half-foot-high glory. Here." He held out the envelope, and Pig eyed it disdainfully.
Hermione laughed, shaking her head. "Harry told me all the time when the two of you were together how much you've changed. I've always regretted never having the chance to spend time with you because I was always abroad."
"I have to admit, I didn't expect it to be this… normal-looking," Harry confessed, making Audrey laugh.
Draco folded the piece of parchment he’d jotted down some notes on that morning and placed it in the pocket of his Potions Master overalls. Pushing back the flaps of plastic hanging over the potions room, he made his way to the front of the small store.
He shifted, and she noticed the rather large box in his hands. With an exclamation of delight, she spun around and strode up to him. She reached for the box but left her hands hovering inches away from it, eyes wide and shining. "Is this it? The unattainable vase of purity?"
"My grandfather told Erhard about the vase and that he suspected that whoever had killed my parents were after it. He said that it was cursed and that it had brought his family nothing but distress, in order to get rid of it. But instead of selling it,
"Wouldn't it be faster if we simply make an announcement?" Draco asked, directing his question at Astoria, noting that the wizard looked chagrined at having been dismissed rather rudely but not having the patience to feel apologetic over it.
"Oh, no, please," Astoria said, waving her hand and looking graciously embarrassed. "I must apologise for making you wait." She turned to her husband and offered him a small smile as she placed a hand on his arm. "Can we expect you for dinner?"
A disembodied voice announced the arrival of the lift, and Harry stepped aside as the door opened and the occupants poured out, some smiling or greeting Camilla as they passed by her. Once they were inside the lift, Camilla gave him a brief run-down of everything he had seen and of where they were headed. He listened attentively, nodding every now and then when she glanced his way.
and I read about a German family that migrated to Britain and played quite an important role in the maintenance of the infrastructure of the school in its early years."
It may have been the lighting, but Draco's eyes were so perfectly silver just then that Harry found himself mesmerised.
"It's alright." Harry shook her hand, and she motioned towards the corridor that led into the building.
"Definitely." Harry clapped Ron on the shoulder. "So, he's really letting you take over this shop once he's done renovating that one?"
me!" she snapped, cutting him off. "I am away for fifteen bloody days out of the entire year," she repeated, "and you're acting as though I make it a habit to stay away from home as much as possible without giving you a valid reason! I'm working, goddamnit, so stop pestering me and
"I suppose I can let you in on a little secret," she said as they stopped in front of the lifts. She turned to face the hallways they'd come from and pointed to the bottom of the wall. "See that?"
"Ah, I don't know anymore," Harry said, and Draco only had a moment to look back at him before soft lips were pressing against his.
"Have a little faith, Potter," the blond said with a determined expression. "Christopher Macnair messed with the wrong Malfoy."
"I will." He smiled at her and jogged towards where the kids were, allowing his minds to sort through yet another fragment of information that added on to the list of unanswered questions he already had.
He munched on his fifth Muggle energy bar, that he'd picked up in London before Apparating to Whitby, as he sent off his final half-hourly report to Robards. The boats would reach Azkaban any minute, now, and he needed to be at the top of his game. He'd barely slept a wink for days, he'd even been hallucinating and was nervous as hell, and he couldn't afford to be hungry on top of all that.
She watched him for a moment longer and then offered him a small smile. "Why don't I make you a cup of tea?" she asked, pecking him on the cheek.
Harry took most of them from Ron and dropped them on the table and chairs, peeking into one out of curiosity. "Ron…is this what I think it is…"
“As you always have in the past,” Draco said, his voice cold. “What is it that you intend to accomplish with this?”
Draco watched them disappear around the corner before shrugging and making his way outside. He jogged over to his usual spot, peering around the tree and smiling at the sight of crossed legs before catching and composing himself. It wouldn't do to seem too happy at the prospect of rendezvousing with Harry.
Macnair was neither struggling nor speaking. He simply glared at Draco, his hatred evident in his sneer.
"Have you tried the blueberry crumpets here? They're simply marvellous," she was saying. "I highly recommend them."
He almost told her for a second there, about everything, but something stopped him and he shook his head, forcing a smile onto his face. "No, there isn't. I'm just being my usual paranoid self. Anyway, I'm going to go make sure the kids haven't caught a starfish and made it their pet or something…"
The boy stared at the paper with a dazed expression, and Harry tutted impatiently. He reached over and placed the paper in the pocket of the boy's shirt and patted it.
"Draco, you're not too swamped with cases, are you? And you haven't taken any new clients in a while."
"Wouldn't have killed Voldemort if I thought before every single thing I did," Harry said with a shrug. "Besides, dying once made me realise there's no point holding back anymore."
Lisa nodded regally before coming up to him and holding out a trembling hand. Realising that she was doing her best to remain strong, he took her hand and shook it gently. She stepped back and looked up at him with watery eyes and a grateful smile. "Thank you so much for everything you've done for us, sir."
Harry smiled and suppressed his urge to pat her on the head. "He'll appreciate it." She offered him a small smile, and he stepped back, motioning to the door. "After you."
With the last remnants of her breath, she rasped, "The double-crosser becomes the double-crossed." Her breath caught, and as he stepped into the light, she focused on the burns that mutilated the right half of his face, his steely eyes hard and cold, as she muttered her final words, "Run while you can because you don't have much longer... Erhard Hertzfeld."
Harry's smile widened, glad that she was still the same, bubbly, talkative person he knew her to be, as he replied. "Al is fine, but Lily and Jamie are down with colds. They were prancing around this morning before I left, though, so hopefully, they should be better soon."
"Don't be silly, Harry, of course I wanted to come. There's no way I would refuse when Ginny asked me, now, would I?"
He turned to see Hannah bustle over. She wiped her hands on her brightly-coloured apron as she stopped before him, a wide smile on her face.
Buxley walked in and turned on the light, making him squint. "It's not good for you to fall asleep at your desk, you know."
He stilled as she snuggled into the blanket, her breathing slowing as she went back to sleep. Leaning down, he made to kiss her hair, but paused at the last minute and pulled away.
"Sorry," he said as he dodged the mop. "I usually sleep on the sofa in my office. It's been a while since I slept here."
"So," he started as she downed her drink in one shot. "I was thinking we really should spend this week away from home like we'd planned. Take the kids out. Have some fun."
Neville stared at him for an uncomfortably long moment before nodding. "Have you contacted them yet?"
"I found you," Draco gasped, the both of them sinking to the floor in a tight embrace. "Oh, my son. I finally found you."
Harry frowned at the man. "Why d'you say that? I can't think of any reason why she's not doing a good enough job—a fantastic one, actually."
"Well, I did all I could in this department, I would think. Now it's time I took it up a notch and do other things that would help in the betterment of the wizarding world."
"Where's the fun in that?" he asked with a wry smile. "Well, I've stayed far too long. I'll have Robards contact you directly regarding the transfer."
Buxley simply nodded, his brows furrowed in confusion as he led the girl out without complaint. Harry watched them go and, with the shake of his head, turned back to his paperwork.
"No, not about that." Harry sighed, placing his spectacles on his nose. "You remember how you hated it when I tried to help you when you were recuperating?"
"Our eldest son, Ryan, he's currently training to be an Auror, just like his father." She turned to look at Harry, her eyes shining with pride. "I didn't want him to join, and I still try to talk him out of it, but he's adamant. His goal is to replace his father as Deputy Auror so Jon here can retire."
Draco shivered as a cool breeze blew past again, and Harry shed his overcoat and draped it over the former's shoulders. "I knew it," he said, his voice low. "I couldn't tell because of the layers you were wearing, but you're really skinny."
"Sweetheart, please," he begged, his voice breaking. He hated to see his little girl cry. It broke his heart. "Baby, please, come on, don't cry. You know Mummy has to go to work. You've always been OK with it, right?"
Kingsley's eye twitched, his mouth downturned in the slightest, and Harry knew it was because of his tone of voice, but he continued to hold steady eye contact. If there was one thing he'd learnt from working with Kingsley for all these years, it was that the wizard greatly trusted those who stood up to him to a certain level and held their own ground. As intimidating as Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt was, Harry still knew that the wizard depended on a lot of people to help him hold the fort.
"Why not?" he asked, fisting the shimmering powder. It was rough against his skin, but cool to the touch, giving him a distorted sense of comfort.
you're interviewing them about," Harry retorted angrily. "I'm just asking you what's keeping you away for three extra days."
"Well, then," Malfoy said, looking as composed as ever. "I hope you don't mind me beginning before the tea and snacks arrive. I'm a little pressed for time."
"Thank you, sir," Harry called as Robards began to walk away, but the constantly unhappy-looking wizard only looked over his shoulder and scoffed.
"I highly doubt that," she grumbled into his chest and pulled away. He laughed as he stepped back and waved.
He disconnected the call and pocketed his warm phone, rubbing his palms together, and promised himself that he would use the new cell phone models Ron hadn't returned like Hermione'd asked him to. He'd ended up experimenting on them, instead, and George and him had come up with a way of making them function in the same way the cross-tech phone worked, except they weren't as durable, yet.
"But, Scorpius, I don't appreciate you talking to me like your mother does. I tolerate a lot of things that you say and do that your grandfather never would've with me, but there's a line that you crossed today, and I don't expect it to happen again," Draco said seriously, knowing he had to re-establish the dynamic of their relationship right then lest his son take him for a pushover.
Harry had to admit that he was slightly weirded out by Malfoy's strange, over-friendly demeanour, so instead, he decided to change the subject back to something else. "When did you say the auction was, again?"
"I didn't mean it like that," she cut in, waving a hand. "All I meant was that I'm surprised that you came to me first."
"Harry, here, drink this," she said, pressing something cool to his lips. He swallowed the bittersweet liquid that filled his mouth and sighed, relaxing. "Here, let's go to the sofa."
rejection?” Harry exclaimed, looking genuinely stumped. “I don’t get it. Most people would die to have someone with your skills in their company! How could not one place employ you?”
Ginny came bustling in just then, her arms laden with colourful party decorations. She took one look at the floating banner, and then at Harry's wand, and with a satisfied nod, went about her business. He sighed as he eased into the nearest armchair, leaning back and resting his elbow on the armrest as he kept the banner hovering in mid-air.
replaced Gumboil as Head of the Undercover Hit-Wizard Unit? And when exactly was I going to be notified about this?"
he thought and said, "Yes," before realising he'd spoken what he was thinking out loud and thought what he was supposed to say. "Ah, I'm too sloshed. Love is such a silly thing, anyway. Flimsy, really. Stupid, useless emotion
As though sensing his discomfort, she began speaking again. "Oh, did you have trouble finding this place? It's rather out-of-the-way, isn't it? I like it because it has this cozy, homely sort of atmosphere. Don't you agree?"
Harry smiled and nodded, and when she shifted uncomfortably, he let go of her and stepped back. "I'm sorry for everything you've had to go through, Lisa. So I think it would be in your best interest to come back to the Ministry with us once you've calmed down. That way we can keep you safe."
"Oh, no, I was one of the few that was initially opposed to telling him," Kingsley admitted. "And for good reason, too; he couldn't even keep it confidential, as it was supposed to be, long enough for me to tell you about the release." He shook his head and returned to his seat, but chose to stand beside it instead of sit.
He bowed his head, light-headed from drinking so much wine so quickly and from the rush of emotions he felt. "I reckon that's because I don't quite understand myself too well either."
He was startled back into the present when Hermione bolted upright, her eyes wide, as though she had just had a profound realisation. She turned to him and said, "
She nodded after a long moment and got under the covers. He forced a smile onto his face as he kissed her forehead and turned away, staring at his arm. It itched, and he wanted to pick at it, but he knew that would only make things worse, so he continued to stare at it till the first rays of sunrise spilt through the gap in the drapes.
the way Fleur, and everyone else, did, so she switched between Auntie Flu and Auntie Floor. It was a running gag in the family.
Harry nodded. "You're right. I suppose after what happened, they've realised that people treat them differently than others. James even came up to me and asked me why the other kids had said he was different from them and that they couldn't be friends. He didn't seem to understand it, and that makes sense because we raised them that way and all of us treat all the kids alike. I think it'll do them good to come to terms with the way people view them. The earlier, the better."
"What do you mean?" Draco demanded, a crazed look in his eyes. "How can my son have gone to an imaginary place?!"
He watched as her breathing slowed, and once he was sure she was back under the lull of sleep, he flicked his wand and muttered a few spells. When all the protective enchantments were in place, he set his wand down on the bedside table, cracked open one of the drawers, and, after some rummaging, pulled out a small vial. He squinted at the label, found it was the wrong one, and after searching for a moment longer, found the right one: a vial of Potion for Dreamless Sleep.
"Sounds fantastic." She smiled. "So, tell me more about what you lot've been up to. Percy and I are rather out of the loop, I must say, what with him nearly living in the Ministry and me having to handle more than enough kids on a daily basis, although I try to keep in touch as regularly as possible..."
Macnair let go of Draco and held his hands up in surrender, slowly rising to his feet. One of the Aurors came up behind him and secured his hands behind his back, confiscating his wand in the process. The other Auror flicked on the light switch, and everybody was blinded for a moment.
Harry cleared his throat and nodded, trying not to look as mortified as he felt, and Malfoy was kind enough to allow him the chance to spare himself of any more embarrassment by changing the topic. "Alright, now that we've settled that—I would like to give you a simple task for you to complete before our next session."
"I'm not complaining," he grumbled, suddenly realising that Kingsley hadn't pressed any of the buttons.
Harry's meeting with Camilla stems another horrifying nightmare; Hermione has uncovered some interesting information about Lisa Barkridge's identity; Draco and Harry's meeting regarding a new healer for Harry goes sideways when Camilla makes a startling suggestion.
If anybody spots errors in the French please let me know because I used Google Translate and Merlin knows it's as good at its job as Binns is at teaching History.
Dyers didn't even bother holding back his groan as he ran a hand through his perfectly combed hair and fixed Harry with a tired gaze. "Look, I know it's irksome to keep hearing this over and over again, but trust me, it's just as tiresome to keep having to come down here and tell you over and over again."
Lily screamed and slapped Albus's hand away, and Harry had to stand in between them to make sure a fight didn't break out.
With a resigned sigh, he trudged into the lounge, not bothering to set aside the bottle of Firewhiskey before he stood before his parents. His mother studiously avoided fixing her gaze on anything but his face—his parents had learnt better than to try and talk him into dressing better, but that didn’t mean they liked it—and attempted a comforting smile.
Someone asked him what to do with the body bag, and he instructed the Aurors to carry it back to the truck. "We'll take him back and cremate him."
He walked away, but not fast enough, because he heard her say, "Running away isn't going to solve anything!"
convinced Erhard to work to protect us from the shadows, instead, and help with the business and other affairs."
Kingsley nodded and then smiled, his gold-capped molars glittering. "Yes, yes, and how did that turn out?"
"About you." The smirk re-appeared on the blond's face, and Harry swallowed thickly, focusing all his energy on not letting himself be distracted by Draco's perfectly pink lips. "I think it has something to do with why I came back."
Buxley strode to the door, but before he left, he looked over his shoulder and asked, "Who was the fellow who reminded you of Hertzfeld?"
Harry nodded. "Sounds like it's going to be an interesting experience. I've never really sold anything in an auction before. So I'll see you there at, say, three o'clock?"
he read silently as he sat down in one of the armchairs and made himself comfortable. He'd used an alias just as Neville had instructed but hadn't expected a response this fast.
. You still haven't gotten to the reason why you wanted to meet with me, let alone the reason why you went to Azkaban to see Lestrange."
"So why exactly do I need to keep this thing hanging in the air when you're clearly not doing anything with it?" he asked as Ginny began to string together some of the decorations.
is hardly the word I'd use… it was mostly me trying to make polite conversation while he sat and stared at the wall." Neville sighed. "It was pointless, me going there. All that came out of it was me visiting my healer every day for the past week and trying not to break things."
"Oh, yes, darling. I met them as they were traveling around Australia looking for their daughter. What wonderful people." Her face fell. "But they seemed so troubled. Always looked like they'd seen a ghost. I took down their phone number just in case because I was worried about how forgetful they seemed."
He walked towards it, curious, and it stuck its left talon out to reveal an envelope. Summoning a box of owl treats, he handed some to the owl and took the letter, eyeing the familiar insignia of Antares on the seal. He ripped it open and pulled the letter out, heart beginning to race, and stared at the unfamiliar, yet somehow familiar handwriting.
They stepped into the crowded space, and Harry backed up against the wall of the lift, revelling at the feel of the cool metal against his burning skin. He could sense Hermione's gaze on him, but he focused on calming himself down.
George shrugged and grinned. "Why not? It's not like we have anything planned or something. Right, Angie?"
Buxley's frown had gradually grown more pronounced with every sentence Harry spoke, and by the end, his eyebrows were so furrowed together that it looked like they would remain that way permanently. Harry shook his head, amazed at his own speech. He looked at his deputy with a serious expression.
"Don't make me choose between Robards and teaching children between eleven to seventeen all year round," Neville grumbled, and Harry laughed.
I watch him leave, and for a long moment I feel a sense of emptiness overcome me. It takes me the rest of the afternoon to figure out why.
"Yeah. Yeah. We get it, Harry, we really do. And honestly, if I was in your situation, I'm pretty sure I'd be doing the same things you're doing, but just… just know that you don't have to deal with everything on your own. You're no hero. You're just Harry. Despite what the majority of the wizarding world thinks," Ron added, as though to bring a little humour into the conversation.
He had just turned back to his large mug of coffee when James and Albus burst into the room, covered in dirt.
Ron nodded slowly. "OK. That makes sense. If it really is as important as she claims it to be, then it needs to be found and the perpetrators need to be caught." Harry started to agree when Ron fixed clear, blue eyes on him and asked, "But, mate, you didn't answer my question. Is your aim to find this vase or to dig up the past?"
He only looked up when Harry and Draco entered the living room. With a frown, he asked the blond, "Are you alright?"
"I never meant to stay for a whole week, anyway," Ginny began before he could say anything. "I was only going to go with her until George and the kids arrived for the surprise and leave the day after. But I thought it'd be fun to surprise you and the kids too, so I thought why not, and asked Hermione to help."
Harry snorted, taking off his glasses and placing them on the nightstand as Draco climbed in beside him, now feeling the embarrassment take over. He cleared his throat as Harry flicked the lights off.
Ginny started humming after a minute—a song that he recognised from their wedding day. It was the one that they had shared their first dance to. He smiled as he let the melody lull his tired mind into the much-needed realm of sleep.
