„It will happen“, Sharif said but did nothing for now.
„And what for?“, he whispered back to himself „To brood and die of sadness?“
„I didn’t think you’d have friends this nice. I wouldn’t have sat down with Parkinson, Crabbe and Goyle.“
“Harry, I am not leaving you. You know what Voldemort said.”
“Are you ok? What’s wrong?” Draco got worried.
“Top or bottom?”
It had been a few weeks and Aries was settling into Hogwarts better than he did the first time. He wrote to his father everyday and spoke to his mother outside of class at least twice a day.
SLYTHERIN!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think it might just be my favorite.” Aries leaned down and licked Draco’s earlobe. Draco’s head shot up and just as he was about to question it, the bell sounded for their next class.
“Well, I woke up and left to go shower because let’s face it cleaning charms are not for long term use. After my shower, I realized I hadn’t brought clothes with me and started to walk back into the dorm.” Harry paused. Draco reached out to hold Harry’s hand. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand as a thank you. “As I was walking back I saw the mirror and my tadpole bump.” Snape’s eyebrow raised. “I don’t really think it had clicked in my head yet that I am pregnant until then. That’s when Draco came in and calmed me down for a few moments. He went to shower and went back to the dorm to get dressed. I sat on my bed and that’s when reality came crashing down on me, I guess. Draco came back and just held me while I cried. I kept thinking in my head that I didn’t know what to do when I just said it out loud.” Harry had his free hand on his stomach, keeping his eyes down the whole time. Draco squeezed his hand letting Harry know he was still there. Harry glanced up and gave Draco a small smile, which Draco returned.
“So that was the truth. Do you have your eye on anyone?”
Harry could tell whoever it was, was crying. He recognized the voice. He knew it because the last time he heard it, it was insulting him. Now it was crying over him. He believed everything the voice was saying because the voice he had never known to show anything but cold was crying. Harry slid to the edge of the bed and tried to stand. It was very wobbly as he was still healing from the broken bones in his legs. After a few shaky steps, he gained his balance and made his way to the large entryway. He could still hear Snape trying to talk the voice into coming to see him. Using a lot of his waning strength he pulled open the door.
Liquet-Defecate

“I’ll talk to him, Harry. Maybe he just needs-”
“The bloody hell I can't. That is my son’s boyfriend. I have to make sure he is ok!”
“I have my own room because of Lily, but I can hangout for a little while. Only if Draco can come though.” He replied.
Chapter 16
“Ok, so it is bad. Ron told everyone who would listen. Not everyone would believe him, but some did.” Hermione said in a quick tone.
What if It was Draco’s baby? He knew it was very unlikely, but that hope is what kept him alive. After they found out Harry was pregnant, they made the plan to escape. The day before the plan was set into action, Harry had told Draco he loved him in words that Harry would soon repeat. Made him obliviate him with the promise to not tell him anything. He also couldn’t allow Harry to get rid of Lily. Draco hated that plan too, but said yes anyway.
Everyone was Happy and they hoped to stay that way. As of right now, all was well.
“You first.” Draco said. Aries picked up the dropper and put one drop on his tongue.
“Hermione, calm down. It is ok. I knew he might do this when I told you. We just have to get through it.” Harry smiled at her. He stood up from the table to look at the group that had gathered around him. Several gasps were heard as they took in his appearance.
Neville looked Draco up and down. He nodded. “Yeah, ok. I would like to get to know this new Draco. He managed to sit at the Gryffindor table all through dinner without picking on or  making fun of anyone. I think it might be a record. You trust him, Harry, so that is good enough for me. We are going to miss you in the dorm. Come on.”
“If you must.”
“Good night, Harry.”
Draco nodded slowly and led Harry to Tom’s throne room.
“Could you dim the lights? Okay, Harry the lights are lower. Can you open your eyes? I need to check you over.”
“We don’t know actually. That’s why we are here. He got upset and started crying, next thing I knew he was talking.” Draco concluded.
“Hey, Aries. You are with Blaise, Greg, Vincent, and myself. Come on.” Draco said as he saw him enter. He followed Draco and was introduced to Greg and Vincent. They all got ready for bed and Aries fell asleep thinking about what tomorrow would hold.
****************
“Harry, we only have about another half an hour before her staying in will be fatal.”
He was immediately called to Ron and Greg’s station. Theirs hadn’t turned out colourless or odourless. Just gray and smelling like a toilet.
“Sev, look.” The voice in his ear was a whisper of disbelief.
(See the end of the chapter for
While Hermione was gone Draco and Harry just sat in the Gryffindor common room in silence. Both knowing that their bubble of happiness was about to pop.
“Narcissa, I adopted Harry three years ago. This girl here is Dani. His cousin, now sister. My new daughter.”
Even Draco didn’t believe it. He had been there every time after the Dark Lord was done with Harry for the day. The first time made him vomit. The next few after that just made him pissed. How could anyone want to hurt Harry? He never understood why it was necessary to visit everyday, until the day the Dark Lord announced his heir was to be born. Then everything made sense.
“Take it to Severus Snape. Don’t leave until he reads it. Do everything you can to get him here. He may be the only hope I have left.”
“Ok, that works. Hermione, go. I’ll be ok. Come on. I may have to lean on you when another contraction comes.”
„Seriously, Potter. First, I served my duty and got cleared of any charges. I would be a free man if I had decided to stay in Britain. No need to go to Muggle Paris and strut around like one of the peacocks my father loved so much. Second, there would be better disguises that come with less discrimination. Third, no one cares anymore. You might still be a celebrity. I am not. I chose to start anew - not my problem you haven’t changed a bit.“
He pointed to his feathery monster of a jacket and Harry couldn’t stop himself from laughing at that.
„Cheers to that“, Sharif said „We all work too much.“
Paris is said to be the town of love. In a twisted way Harry appreciated the irony since he came here to think about divorce. Back in London he wasn’t able to clear his head up to a point were an informed decision was possible. Having Ginny and the kids around triggered his duty-mind all the time. He’d look at their faces, listen to their laughter and all he could see was the picture-perfect image that they portrayed. An image that gave a lot of people hope after the war. They weren’t just a family. They were The Golden Family. The Family embodying that everyone could overcome war and trauma and thrive.
YEAR 6: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS, CHEST, HANDS), FOUR BROKEN RIBS (LEFT), TWO BRUISED RIBS(LEFT), CONCUSSION, MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“Well, get rid of them.” A man answered.
Just as he finished those words the doors bang open.
“Who?”
Harry started yawning and Draco declared it was bedtime. Harry started up the stairs to his dorm, but paused and turned around to face Draco who was about to go to the Slytherin dorms for the night.
He looked up and Harry held out his spoon with a smile.
“Weasley happened. Harry left the tower to go to bed and Weasley took the opportunity to show how stupid and juvinile he truly is. Harry broke two ribs and a fractured cheekbone. Poppy wants to keep him for a few days to watch Lily. Weasley body bound him and Harry landed directly on his stomach when he fell. She was in distress for a while but Harry's magic protected her enough that she was not injured. If Miss Granger and Mr. Longbottom hadn't heard them, I am not sure what would have happened. I just got back from Gringotts when I saw them bringing him down.”
“That actually is a good idea. I’ll talk to Mother about it sometime soon.”
“I am going to speak to your parents and see if they will sign your guardianship over to me. Even if it isn’t permanent. I won’t allow you to stay in a house where you could be hurt. I made that mistake with Harry. I won’t with you. Will you be ok with that?” He asked the little girl.
“What in the name of Merlin is going on?”
“No, I am three months along. I also know the genders, if you are interested?”
After that night the subject was never brought up again. Everyone accepted Snape and Harry as father and son, no questions asked. After that night Harry only called Snape father, except in public where they still had to pretend.
Harry screamed and fell to the floor with another contraction. He needed to get Lily out soon.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll go.” Blaise said. He spun the bottle and the others watched it spinning. When it finally landed, it was pointing at Vincent.
Snape stood up and walked to Harry, finally letting the tears fall. He stood in front of the boy he had grown to care about, hugged him close to his chest and whispered, “And you are the best son I could ask for. I hate how you came to me, but will never hate that you did. I am happy I was able to help you when you needed it. You are the only thing in my life that matters anymore.”
“Yes?” He replied still lots in his thoughts.
“We are planning it together.” They answered simultaneously.
“That is a good point. I don’t know that he hates you exactly, but he doesn’t know Aries. He is here actually. Just a few doors down. He was at Blaise Zabini’s the night I brought you here but returned the next day. He doesn’t know about you yet. We warded your room so he nor Cissy would come here. The house elves were told to not mention you or that this room was in use at all. Let me go ask Tom what he thinks.”
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes wandered down to his bulging stomach. Poppy told him he could give birth at varying times. Wizard pregnancy was different to normal ones. With wizards there was no set time. It all depended on the amount of magic the parents had. He caressed the bump.
Draco kissed him hard and demanding, forgetting about his mother in the room until a loud bang pulled them apart.
His contraction hit him like a brick wall. He collapsed looking at Tom. His face was confused at first, but then he smiled looking at Harry.
“Dear young Draco. I have heard an interesting rumour. I would like you to clear the matter up.” Tom hissed.
“Severus, please tell Albus he cannot send Harry back to the Dursleys.” She replied with a broken tone. She walked over to Harry who had panic all over his face. “Don’t worry Harry, you aren’t going anywhere.”
He uncrumpled the page and read.
The next couple of weeks passed about the same. Harry’s nightmares were constant, so Draco ended up in Harry’s bed every night. Draco had tried to get Harry to talk to him or Snape to no avail. Harry just tried to shut them out. They were always the same thing. Tom used him and Draco helped him after.
Several loud cracks echoed around the room. Harry blocked it out. Several more followed. He felt another contraction coming. It was now or never. “Avada Kedavra!” Harry screamed.
Harry’s eyes crack open, but immediately snap closed. The lights cause his head to flair in pain. He grimaced in pain.
Harry said nothing as always and went to work. He worked on dinner for an hour and a half before he was done.
“Well, well, well. What do we have here? A freak wondering around?” Harry is suddenly flipped to his back. His view was filled with red hair and freckles. “You are not welcome here. No one wants you around.” Ron kicked him hard in the ribs. He heard a crack.
Harry nodded. “Can we go get ice cream? I just really want chocolate ice cream.”
It had been two days since Aries had been brought to the Manor. His mother never left his side and his father visited him regularly. Lucius had been sworn to secrecy from even his own wife and son. Aries was finally able to move on his own accord without the help from someone else. He was still sore, but definitely better. It was just after dinner when he got an idea.
“I think he has made his opinion very clear, Albus. I am his father. Not you. You will be sending him nowhere without my permission. We will be staying at the castle until school starts again. We live in a muggle part of London. You pointed this out. You won’t be going back on your word of allowing us to stay here. If you do, I will take Harry out of the country to ensure his safety. There are plenty of wizarding schools across the world. I’m sure one would allow us to transfer The-Boy-Who-Lived to theirs. End of discussion.” Snape’s voice clearly showed he would not argue or hesitate to go through on his threat.
“You will. Bye, Ginny.”
Harry entered the tower and immediately knew Hermione and Draco should not have been left alone.
“You're so hard, Dray! Such a big fucking dick! I wanna taste it, I wanna feel it in my mouth!  Can I suck it, Dragon? Can I suck your dick, Dragon? Would you like that, Dray?” He panted then leaned forward and kissed the tip, running his tongue around the head and along the slit.
YEAR 7: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS, HANDS, FACE), LEG FRACTURE (RIGHT), HEAT EXHAUSTION, MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
Aries started kissing his way down to Draco’s chest. He licked one of the nipples in front of him and pinched the other.  A soft moan escaped his lips as Aries ran his tongue down his torso until he was on his knees in front of him, his thickening cock inches from his face.  Aries took his dick into his hand and began to massage it as his other hand fondled Draco’s sack.
Instead of just sitting there waiting, he went and took a quick shower. By the time Snape returned Aries was out of the shower getting dressed. They had sent an elf to Diagon
Hermione raised her hand but Snape ignored her.
“Dragon, please tell Poppy to let me see Harry. I need to make sure he is ok.”
“Draco, you need to remember who we are talking about. He is the same person who was laughing at his godfather’s funeral because he knew how much Sirius would have hated it. He has always taken bad things in stride and laughed about it after. I do appreciate everything you have done for him and continue to do. I like that you are waiting for him, but maybe this time, take what you want. You used to pretend to be a spoiled git, but you never were. Anything you got came from Snape. Don’t tell me I’m wrong because I’m not. Be selfish just this once.”
“Not a lot.”
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted by arms winding around him and a kiss on the cheek.
Couple of warnings. Death of a child. SIDS reference. Non-canon material. Like majorly.
Harry kissed the finally sleeping three year old on the forehead, whispered, “Goodnight, Lily pad.” and quietly left the room . He walked to the kitchen and fixed some tea. Draco was in the shower washing off the long wedding day. Who would have thought Severus Snape would be a bridezilla?
“I told you I am believing you until you show I can’t.” He walked over to Aries and pressed his lips against his boyfriend’s. They kissed for a minute before deciding to continue looking through the books and ingredients.
“Severus! I demand to know who you have brought into my house!”
With that thought he slipped into a peaceful, restful sleep, not knowing what tomorrow could bring.
********
Snape’s breath caught slightly. “Oh, Harry. Your mother would have loved that. If you want Lily, then I will gladly accept the role of her grandfather.” Harry released Draco’s hand and stood. He went to the only father he had ever known and hugged him.
“Oh, ok. I’m ready. I thought it wasn’t for another hour.” Harry replied.
Harry grabbed Draco, cuddling in close. He sobbed into Draco’s shirt and Draco just held him, knowing nothing would help make him feel better. Soon Harry cried himself to sleep. Draco just looked at his fiance watching him sleep. Promising silently to never let anything happen to Harry or Lily Marie Malfoy-Potter again.
Harry just nodded.
They made it to the last door and Aries opened it. Snape’s eyes widened when they landed on the massive snake carcass.
Harry and Hermione laughed to the point of being out of breath again.
***********
“Well, it was odd at first. I didn’t have parents and then suddenly I had two. One of which is the Dark Lord. It was a lot to swallow. When they proved I really was their son, they embraced me like I had never been gone. That made it easier. Plus, I had Draco if I needed him.” He glanced at Draco and saw he was blushing again.
“Oh, I was so hoping at least one of you would fight this.
“Then I hope you won’t be mad when I do this.” Draco said. He walked around the bed to stand next to Harry. He dug in his pocket and pulled out a little black box. He knelt down to the ground and opened the box. Narcissa, Snape, Dani, and Harry all gasped. The silver ring was beautiful. It had one emerald and one diamond sitting next to one another on two entwined silver bands. I wasn’t too girly or too manly. I was the perfect ring.
As soon as everyone finished Snape stood.
“Ohh, Aries! Yes, baby, suck me!” He growled, running his fingers through his hair.
“What’s wrong Dray? Are you Hurt” Dani asked. She had taken to calling him that since she decided Draco was too weird.
“Yes, and you talk way too much, my Dragon.” Aries said, taking his mouth again.
“That is true. I can’t wait to see Remus. I haven’t seen him in person since I got back. We write letters, but it isn’t the same.”
“Wow.” Pansy said.
“What is your name?” Draco started.
“How are you, Harry? And the little one?”
“We have all the same classes. Good. Now I can show you around.”
“Harry, I just wanted to apologize for Ron. We don’t all agree with his opinion. You are like a brother to me. You didn’t choose this and are making the best of a bad situation. I really would like to still be part of your life. No matter how small a role.”
Love the reviews guys!
“What happened here?” He demanded.
“Merlin, yes!” Draco responded.
“I hate this, but I have to take that chance.“
“After you left, mommy said to pretend you never existed. I didn’t like it. Everything was ok until I got my letter. She called me a freak. She put me in your cupboard. Mr. Hagrid came and got me soon after that. Mommy told me if I left I couldn’t come back. I knew if I stayed they would hurt me. I can’t go home Harry! What am I going to do?” Fresh tears rolled down the angel’s face.
Draco looked to the floor. His heart stopped. This was it. This was the moment where it ended, everything they had built between them. He felt the tears fall. He couldn’t look into those beautiful green eyes and lie. He kept his gaze locked on the floor and said, “It was a memory.”
She looked at him, hooted as if to say she would get help, and flew into the dark right as the door to his room flew open.
Aries smiled and pounced. Draco chuckled as his face was attacked with Aries lips. It was cute until Aries grabbed a handful of Darco’s arse.
Harry told her to continue.
“Please tell me you aren’t dying! Whatever it is we can handle it.”
Before had been of course some of the chores, cupboard, and occasional smack upside the head. Now it was all of the chores, his stuff from Hogwarts in the cupboard, and actual beatings. Not a punch to the stomach and he’s done. It was worse than that. It was being made to lay on his bed and hit repeatedly with either Vernon’s belt, a wooden bat, or his own broom. The broom was the worst, as it was made to fly through the air with no resistance and take hits from bludgers.
“Oh, that’s new. Cat got your tongue?” the man laughed. “Well, Potter, no issue, I’ll just send in the healer to check tadpole for you.”
With that Aries left and went straight to his mother’s room to explain the situation. His mother laughed when Aries said Dumbbells believed Snape wouldn’t check about his son being alive and just immediately believed it. When he was done, he bid his mother a goodnight and went back to his dorm set on a nice hot bath.
The man nodded and led him inside.
Draco smiled. “So, a new daughter and granddaughter. You never do anything by the halves, do you?”
“Thank you and call me Harry.”
“Potter,huh? I don’t know, but will you lay with me?”
“I don’t know what you mean.” He says innocently.
It was a year almost to the day that they decided to tell the order he was no longer at the Dursley’s and why. At first there was silence. Then there was rage. Rage at the Dursleys. Rage at Dumbledore. Rage at Snape.
“You arsehole! You could have warned me!” Draco smacked him in the chest then buried his face in Aries chest. Aries wrapped his arms around his Dragon and waited for his mother. When Snape came out of the tunnel his arms were crossed and he landed gracefully on his feet with a little bounce.
“What’s wrong, Harry?”
“Young Draco, since you have done well, You will not suffer for the doubt you just displayed. Only this once. My spy will come to you when the time is right. I cannot risk him being found out quite yet. You are dismissed.”
Harry and Draco stood. They followed Neville to the common room.
“Really? Who?”
Sir, I am very sorry to bother you, but I need help. I think I am going to die. If not by the time you get this letter I will have been incredibly injured. Please help me. I know you don’t like me, but do it for my mom. Please sir, I will never ask anything from you again.
“Dani, you know I wasn’t being treated right by your parents. I had to leave. I had hoped you would be ok. I never knew you were a witch. You never showed signs. What happened?” He set the girl in his lap as much as his size could allow.
“Draco, I’m-”
“Who are you? We aren’t going to leave her with a strange boy. You could hurt her.”
“Minor? He almost killed my granddaughter! He injured Harry enough to stay here for another day. All you are telling me, is that he will get a minor punishment? Mr. Longbottom and Miss Granger pulled him off of my son. If they hadn't been there, who knows what would have occurred!” Snape yelled.
“Dragon, I-”
He was really getting into the book when the compartment door slid open. He looked up and saw who it was.
“Now, my boy, I don’t know where you came up with that, but it certainly is not true. However, I will get to the point of your visit. I want to ask how you are settling in. So, how is everything?”
“Sorry. Your turn.”
Draco released an almost inaudible moan which caused Aries to smirk in his direction. The sinks moved to reveal the entrance.
man that was unable to come, along with ones for his parents and Sirius. He felt Neville was standing next to him the entire time anyway.
Why? Why is it that for almost sixteen years they had thought their son had died? Why is their son Harry Potter? Why does he look like James Potter? Why was his son taken from him? Why had he missed the chance to raise his son? Why had he treated his son like scum since he had reentered his life?

“Are you kidding? I peed thirty minutes ago. I just got comfortable again. I love you, but can’t wait until you are out of me.”
Later that night Snape, Aries, and Draco all sat down and Snape confirmed everything. They even fire called Tom for his opinion.
“Yes, father. Tadpole is a she.”
“In that case, I am with you. You can count on me.” Neville said in a proud voice.
“I call you a ferret, because in fourth year not Moody transfigured you into one. Also it just fits.” Ron snarked back, making Harry giggle.
“NO! She is safe in here. She won't be if she isn’t. Help me up.”
“Sure, Weasley.” Draco chuckled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco, I take back every bad thing I have said to you. No one has ever pulled him out that quickly before. Usually he throws a few punches as well.” Hermione said.
“While you were asleep just now we removed your clothes to make it easier to work. That was when we saw your knee. Sev went and got a potion. You add the hair of the parents and it shows if their children are near. He added our hair and it showed us you. As for how you got to Lily and James, I have no Idea. We buried our son, but here you are. All of us broke that day.” Tom finished.
Aries just chuckled. “No. I just had a question.”
“Draco, you are about to have me to yourself for the next three months until we go home for Christmas. Come on or we are going to miss the train.” Aries said.
“Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.” Draco gave Harry a worried look.
Aries raised an eyebrow and stood to follow the rest to the dungeons. “What do you mean?”
The last of whom remained calm and quiet through the whole argument. When Dumbledore decided to berate Snape from removing Harry from a safe home with a loving family, Harry who had been eavesdropping had snapped. He quietly walked up to Dumbledore, looked the old man in the eyes and calmly said, “He helped me when no one else did. At that place I was alone, scared, scarred, beaten, starved, locked in a cupboard for eleven years, and raped. I will never physically recover from them. With him I am fed, clean, allowed necessities that I called luxuries, I am happy and loved. You know, before Hogwarts I was never once given presents for birthdays or holidays? I never expected to get them from Snape of all people, but this past year for those things he has more than made up for the lack of them. He bought me the first pair of newly bought clothes that I had ever owned. So, you can yell and scream about him not telling you. You can yell and scream about what they did to me. However you are not allowed to say one bad word about the man who saved my life. About MY father.”
Slytherin stood in applause for their new member. Aries sat next to Draco and Pansy when he got to the table. He paused briefly to look at his mother. Snape looked at him with his trademark scowl. However, Aries noticed the corners turned up slightly as Snape raised his glass in a mock toast. Aries returned the gesture and went back to his meal.
Draco’s lips crushed on his, unrestrained, he cupped his face with both hands as Aries’ fingers slid along the sculpted forearms to meet his for a brief moment until he nudged
“Mother has been hoarding her. I’ll go get them.” Harry nodded and Draco left only to return with his smiling mother a minute later. She handed Lily to Harry and sat down next to them in a chair. Draco sat propped up on the bed next to Harry looking at their gorgeous daughter waiting for Harry’s reaction.
“I- m- am Draco. I mean I am Draco. The pleasure is all mine, Aries.” Aries smiled at the stuttering it made Draco’s heart flutter.
She nodded her head and hugged the man. “Thank you.” She whispered in his ear.
********
I’M NOT VERY GOOD. RON BEATS ME ALL THE TIME, BUT SURE.
“No, I don’t really feel like having mind altering potions in my system. What do you want?” He asked, not really giving a shit.
“I need to be inside you. I don’t want you to cum until I am.” Draco nodded his head furiously.
“I know you don’t remember, but we did grow close. I consider you my best friend. You are not, and I repeat not alone in this. You can ignore the Dark Lord’s involvement, because as far as I am concerned, I am Uncle Draco. I agree with you. No matter what you want to do, I am not letting you do it alone. Understand?” Draco demanded.
They walk in silence for a few minutes. As they get to the stairs a sudden pain almost knocks the wind out of Harry.
YEAR 10: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS,HANDS, BACK), CONCUSSION, DISLOCATED SHOULDER(LEFT), SEVERE SKIN LACERATIONS( CHEST AND BACK), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
Snape looked at the little girl in surprise. “I would love for you to call me Daddy.”
Draco’s eyes grew as he saw the son of his godfather walk into his room. He was by far the most handsome boy Draco had ever laid eyes on. His jaw dropped open.
Snape had him learn Occlumency correctly this time. They had found out the glamour covering Harry from Aries had also hidden different abilities. He was actually very good at potions and wandless magic. He and his father did have a running joke to speak only in parseltongue around Snape. It irritated the man to no end, but the other had found it hilarious.
Draco’s heart soared. “Sure, Harry.”
“Mother?” He asked.
Aries chuckled, but scooted over. Draco jumped into his bed. They laid side by side, facing each other.
“I don’t know what to do.”
Snape never thought Harry would actually call him his father even after a year of acting like nothing changed in public, but actually being very close in private. He always still called him Snape or Severus. That all changed when Snape told the Order what had happened.
“I’m going to go get some wine. Do you want a glass?”
“Excuse me girls. Could I have a minute alone with Dani?” He asked softly. The girls looked him up and down. One girl with blonde hair and green eyes stepped forward.
“Wait, what?”
Aries nodded and followed his mother to his room. As soon as the door shut Aries was wrapped in his mother’s arms.
“Your wand is here. You must have dropped it when you were grabbed.” He reached over to the side table and picked it up. Handing it to Harry he said, “Good thing we made you master nonverbal magic.”
Tom looked at his love and sighed. He walked over to the boy who had only ever really looked at once. He saw the pain on the unconscious child's face. He looked at the scar he had given him. He studied the child for a few more seconds before a feeling came over him. A feeling he had only ever had twice before. Once when he had met Severus Snape and when he first saw their son.
“Miss Parkinson, even if I wasn’t married. You do not do it for me. Now go.” He glowered.
“You know about that? She isn’t biologically mine, but I am her dad. I have been there through every part of her life so far. I love Harry and Lily is part of him. Look, why don’t you go to bed? I will stay with him and you can come back in the morning. You need the rest.”
“Just in case you ever want to visit, the password is Devil’s Snare.” Neville said. Harry nodded his thanks as they made their way inside. Silence spread over those in the room. Neville led them over to a table occupied by only one.
“Of course he didn’t. Dumbledore probably took him straight to the castle to keep you from trying to hex him.”
“Harry? Poppy!” Draco yelled then cringed. “Sorry.”
“Draco, I can’t spend my life scared. I am thinking of Lily. I want her to know two of the most important people in my life. I have kept too much from them already. They don’t know Snape is my father. I plan to tell them today, but that on top of Lily is going to be overwhelming. I couldn’t tell them about Father because if they were captured it could have blown his cover. Now there is no cover. I can be completely honest with them. I won’t tell them about you being a spy, but at least it’s something. We already have a cover story for you. The least I can do is be honest about everything else. Plus, I have been stuck in the castle for weeks. I am not even allowed to go outside without four escorts. Let me just have today. If anything happens we have emergency portkeys for the hospital wing.” Harry needed this and Draco knew it.
A shrill cry echoed in the large room. Draco grabbed a nearby Daily Prophet and wrapped the small baby in. Snape grabbed her to give to Harry. “Draco, you need to clean Harry up. Heal him. We can talk about this later. Harry, Lily is just fine. She is perfect.” Draco got to work.
“Only if you rest.” Harry nodded and scooted over. He fell asleep in Draco’s arms listening to the breaths from his love.
“Who the bloody hell are you to tell me to leave?” Ron yelled.
“I’m sorry, Harry.
Snape asked the girl questions for a little over an hour. When he was finally satisfied, he asked Harry to take her back to the common room.
After a few minutes after Draco collected himself, both he and Snape helped Harry back to his bed. Snape then left letting Harry know he would return later. Draco grabbed a chair and sat next to Harry.
Now since Snape is no longer a spy Harry can go to his last year at Hogwarts as Harry Prince. Potter is dead. He died the moment Snape saved him and they wouldn’t have it any other way.
Everything was going well, until a couple of weeks later when Aries received a note.
“Tell Snape. Ginny is the spy. She has Harry. I have to go!” Draco said and took off running again. He ran as fast as he could to the outside of the wards and apperated.

„You look different. Ploy to deceive the press? In England rumors are you are either dead by suicide or murder or went off to some foreign country to live off your family’s blood money. So I guess the latter is true.“
He researched some of the recent history of the quarter he was about to visit and wanted to look at least a little bit like he belonged. He had seen pictures of a lot of well-dressed, colorful people sitting in modern or classic cafes and bars. Of course those pictures were meant as advertising and probably didn’t depict the truth. But there was some kind of want arising in Harry. The want to break his mold. Maybe he could try something new.
He handed her another drink.
„Don’t you think that is a tat bit dramatic?“ He registered himself how unsure he sounded.
Malfoy shrugged.
„I think finally living his true self has helped him a lot“, Simone chimed in „We didn’t know him when he got to France. He lived in Lyon before and figured out a lot about himself before he got here. He doesn’t talk much about that time. It must have been hard. Especially as a man caught between worlds, like he is. I get that. Before I started my transition I lashed out a lot, too. That is great about this place. No one judges you for your past, if you show interest in owning up to it. Izzy still wants him to apologize to that mysterious women, who - Oh wait! He said he want to school with her! You must know her!“
„A beer for starters, I guess.“
„How did you all get to know each other?“, Harry asked Sharif.
He introduced Harry in English:
„With the two of us I figure it would become serious quite easily, don’t you think?“
He was so used to dress in wizard fashion by now that the variety of the muggle fashion was quite overwhelming. The Dursley’s never had taken him shopping, which added to him feeling a little anxious. Yet there was nobody to judge him - except maybe for the fact that he was shopping alone while most people took at least one friend. He took a deep breath and managed to fight down the impeding threat of his lungs constricting. This was a mission. He could do it.
Draco plucked a pen out of his jacked and rolled up the sleeve of his right arm. There was one tattoo Harry know had to be there. The dark mark, still harsh against the pale skin. Beneath it was another one. It said: Never Again. Remember. In bright, gold ink that had to be of magic origin.
„Why muggle Paris?“
Harry was sure that his nonchalance had to be fake. He just didn’t want to own up to things like Harry did. He chose to flee. But there was one thing that didn’t make sense to Harry.
The smell of Draco’s sweet fragrance and the feel of his surprisingly soft lips stayed with much longer after they parted. His whole body had felt tingly. Possibly because all of it was so surreal. And this whole experience was his. He didn’t have to share it for now. He could keep it without anyone commenting and that felt wonderful. Still a part of him wanted to rush to Hermione and tell her. But there were too many strings attached. And, boom, full circle, he was back to Ginny, the kids, the ministry and everything. He shouldn’t delude himself. He could enjoy this break but in the end Malfoy’s way wasn’t his. He could use a little inspiration but he’d never life the life of a Boheme. But maybe, maybe he’d feel a little more at ease knowing that other people had managed to find their way despite everything. Draco had managed to be a different person. Maybe he had had to cut off many ties for that, but Harry’s position was different.
„We could become Zombie hunters“, Charles offered.
„It would have been foolish. They would’ve thought all of this to be quite funny and ridiculous and made fun of what has become of traditional families. This has nothing to do with making amends. It has to do with me and who I want to be. You can berate me as much as you want, Potter, but I am done with others telling me how to live my life. And if they aren’t willing to let me be then I walk away. It is my right.“
He would get to know Draco and his life and then see what he could adapt for himself. A little bit of Brunch wouldn’t take away too much time from the thinking he still had to do. Right.
He felt a queasy sensation in his stomach but not in a bad way and sorted through the clothes he brought with him. It was depressing. When had he resorted to wearing only plain black clothing? After the war when he had started to earn his own money he had brought a few more daring pieces - which the prophet had found rather unbefitting for the Golden Boy. He hadn’t felt like arguing against them because of clothes and had gone for plain. Apparently at some point he had also decided that black was best for him.
. At first he thought he had been mistaken. Yes, there was a striking resemblance but it couldn’t be him for several reasons.
It was even later in into the night that Sharif and Simone went for the last round of drinks and Draco plopped down next to Harry.
And thus, the Boy Who Lived hit the Parisian Fashion Scene.
He felt utterly clumsy but the woman was a true professional and flashed him a big smile. She asked about colors he liked, showed him different fabrics and patterns and after an hour, that didn’t feel like one at all, he went back to his hotel packed with a few new items, that made him feel proud and that he hoped he wouldn’t regret buying later. What would Ginny say, if she found out he spend his holiday alone splurging on clothes? He could’ve done that in London, too. Or together with her as a date, as a try to light the fire again. He had never thought about something like that back in England. Was this a sign that his horizon was already broadening or was it a bad sign that he felt creative curiosity arise the minute he had left home? Harry started to feel a headache coming on and stopped for coffee in a nice little café and started on one of Hermiones less threatening books on relationships and mental health. At least that made him feel like was actually trying.
„Really? I obviously look enough like myself for you to recognize me… and I guess the Prophet would rejoice to have a picture of me looking like this. So go ahead. Tell them,  dear hero. Shall I pose for you? And no, I don’t live off my family’s money. I very much earn it myself. They aren’t exactly keen on people like me.“
„Well… if the two of you can sit together and have a drink, maybe he’ll be brave enough to do it. You could provide the contact, right?“
„So you’re one of those people, who knew our Draco when he was one of the closeted bad guys?“, Morenna asked, slowly stirring her drink.
„I’d rather not have them see us like that because they would decide to rise from their graves to haunt us forever.“
Should he let the use of the first name slide?
„I’d like that…and I don’t need emotional support for that, even though I really like the two.“
On more than one occasion he had to remind himself how to breathe properly. His chest felt tight all the time up to the point when he had to see a healer about it and she told him to take some time off - from everything. She didn’t say it to his face, but he understood what she meant: psychosomatic disorder.
Harry should do something. But his gaze was fixed on the approaching figure. Just a few more strides. Harry still couldn’t move. Eventually he was hit with a wave of a sensual perfume and found himself face to face with -
He made a show of examining his slender hands and well manicured nails until the last part of his little speech, when he chose to give Harry a once-over look that he couldn’t place at all. Everything about it irked Harry. Especially his claim, that he, Draco bloody Malfoy, had grown as a person, while he, Harry, still was a boy basking in glory, which, by the way, he never had enjoyed, thank you very much.
„Aww, you are cute. Likewise. But. You’re right. This is not what it should be. Would you like to get to know this version of Draco?“
Harry had to stop himself from openly gaping. Much of what Draco said mirrored his own thoughts and fears. Especially this very point: Sacrifice. He was willing to die to get rid of Voldemort. It was the right thing to do. Not easy, but something that he himself felt was right. But then he came back - doomed to live a life that he had never thought he would have and that he didn’t have plans for. And then other people started to plan for him and he never had had an opportunity to be sure if their values were also his. In a way he had also always been caged by something.
Sharif was a calm man, who Harry could easily see in his job as a teacher with his easy smile and deep but non-threatening voice.
Izzy trough herself in Sharif’s Arm dramatically. He patted her head and sushed her like a baby.
The hotel Harry had chosen was clean and modern. First he had thought of renting a room in one of those pompous places in the style of the old French days of monarchy and splendor. Just to try it out. But it had felt too opulent, too oppressing. He had wanted something that would allow him to focus and not to distract him further.  This room was perfect. It was spacious enough with a bedroom and a little sitting area and a separated bathroom. The white walls didn’t have much decor, except for an abstract painting placed directly above the bed. He  quite liked the swirl of blue and green tones flecked with a little gold. The bed itself was a double with a slate grey comforter and otherwise white sheets and cushions. It felt incredibly soft to the touch. The furniture was made of wood in a light brown shade, matte instead of shiny. There was a TV positioned next to a couch that matched the comforter. He also spotted a discreetly placed fridge that most likely was the mini bar. He’d made a good choice. After he had sorted all his clothes in the cupboard he decided to have a look at the brochures about Paris in general and the quarter he was currently staying in. He’d like something to eat and browsed the food-related ones first.
„So, what do you do, Harry?“, Simone asked.
„Malfoy.“
It wasn’t that he didn’t love Ginny or his children. But. But he wasn’t happy. And he didn’t know why. So he took the healer’s advice and requested some time off. At the agency they actually approved. So did Ginny, Ron and Hermione - up to the point where he confessed that he wanted to go alone for at least two weeks. He could still see the hurt in Ginny’s face clear as day when he had told her.
The man currently ordering something at one of the bars had bright blond hair, almost silvery. Just, that it wasn’t slicked back but artfully tousled, shorter in the back and sides and longer on top - one of the fashionable cuts Harry had seen quite a lot in the last few weeks whenever he passed by a stall with fashion magazines.
„I didn’t think you’d spend that much time with us.“
„Are you happy, Harry? Why are
„Can’t say I’m full of pity. Honestly I wouldn’t put it past you to use this as a temporary way of hiding from your responsibilities.“
ancestors turning in agony.“
When he lay down, he reviewed the evening again and fell asleep to the sound of laughter and the smell of vanilla and whiskey.
„We’ll see about that. How long are you staying?“
Malfoy raised a meticulously plucked eyebrow and scoffed.
Maybe he had had too much.
„That doesn’t sound like his old self to be honest…“
It wasn’t that he hadn’t suspected it before. All his mandatory physical check-ups had been fine. He was fine whenever he focused on an actual task. It was at social gatherings, interviews and - he had to force himself to acknowledge that - when he was with his family, that his chest started to feel tight.
Maybe it was the fact that
Harry shrugged.
„I browsed some of the brochures in the hotel and wanted to take a look.“
„I don’t think it is dramatic, at least not in a bad way. I mean, I quite like drama.“
After walking past a few more expensive looking stores and some cheaper ones but with outrageous clothes he found one that seemed to be his category of both price and style. The shirts and trousers had some patterns and colors but were far from being over the top.
was a well recommended restaurant in Paris. The name reminded him of Slytherin which was why he was rather surprised that he found himself drawn to it immediately. Maybe it was about him wondering what would have happened, had he been sorted into Slytherin. Maybe it was the description, which was so vastly different from what he knew about House Slytherin.
And that was, when he saw
He gestured to the Bartender and handed Harry his beer.
„About two weeks, I think. But him and I haven’t talked that much that evening. I’ve mostly hung out with you two - which was great by the way.“
Harry was surprised that Malfoy had apparently told them a half-truth about his past. Interesting.
was surrounded by numerous other bars in a similar style and all of them seemed somehow connected but offered different menus and drinks. The patrons though seemed to be free to choose any of the many seats or comfortable sitting areas scattered around the whole complex. To him it seemed more like a mega-bar-restaurant-thingy than anything else. Were there places like this in London? The atmosphere was busy with a myriad of colors and lights. There was art placed everywhere. Hell, there even was a bar where you could sip on your drink in an empty bathtub filled with cushions. He didn’t know what to focus on.
Later in the evening they had settled for a small booth settled in a bar with lots of wood, plants, cushions and fairy lights. Charles and Entienne had opted for one of the bath tubs. Seldom had Harry seen couples looking so happy and at ease with each other as these two - even though they seemed so different at the first glance. Morenna and Malfoy - Draco - somehow managed to look very regal while trying to outdo each other in terms of whiskey consumption. Harry didn’t feel safe enough yet for anything else than beer. He already had a comfortable buzz going on and wanted to enjoy the evening safely without the risk of getting too drunk. Sharif and Simone seemed to sense that he needed a little bit of comfort and stuck to him whenever the others went a little loud and crazy - which happened surprisingly often - especially Draco and Izzy seemed to enjoy setting each other off and to drink to sisterhood after that.
Back in the hotel he spend quite some time sorting through his new clothes and trying on different combinations. Reading and some coffee had calmed him down a little. The book even said that taking some alone-time and searching for new experiences and impressions could be helpful. He was fine. Harry settled for the blue shirt with the watercolor-print and a set of darker jeans and the new shoes he had invested in. Truth be told, he felt rather smashing. Still, there was a voice of guilt constantly whispering in his mind. Shouldn’t he work on getting his act together? Wasn’t this just distraction? Wasn’t he leaving his family alone to fix things instead of avoiding thinking? He should have gone to Scotland, shouldn’t he?
Harry took a deep breath and now it was him who looked Draco up. He was the same and yet so utterly changed and seemingly unashamed of it. He had found a new ecosystem in which he could thrive, shedded his past like old skin. Harry was curious, he couldn’t deny it.
There was Izzy, who worked as a musician and had parts of her afro died in vibrant colors and several golden piercings. Harry liked her immediately because she reminded him of Tonks.
on their flags. Thus they all were located in the same quarter, where the LGBTQ+ and art scene was very prevalent. Harry never had much to do with the LGBTQ+ movement, despite knowing quite a few gay people, nor did he know much about art. It was the perfect place to get to know himself better by being somewhere he had never been before and certainly wasn’t known.
It was hard to school his features into something resembling neutrality. There were lots of things going on in Harry’s mind. For one: processing this version of Malfoy and wanting to ask a thousand questions. The other: remembering who he was and thus being angry with him. And there was also a third conflicting feeling similar to exhilaration: He felt alive.
„May I help you, Sir?“
„Very closeted and very bad and not in the fun way“, Draco answered.
He didn’t want to go too deep into the mess of his mind. Malfoy scrutinized him for a while. Harry felt twitchy.
„Tame. Boring. But whatever.“
„I feel like I’m not being taken seriously here.“
place for artists of every couleur. The brochure described it as a place bustling with creative energy. Apparently it was part of an association of different bars and restaurants who had written
His next problem occurred when one of the staff members approached him in French. She seemed to realize quickly though, that he didn’t speak any French and proceeded in barley accented English:
„Yeah… they say friends reflect who you are… I’m still in contact with Pansy. She changed, too. She gets me and visits quite often actually. But that is beside the point. Point is, we’re both a little surprised here. And I’d like to talk with you sober. So, what about Brunch tomorrow? O would you feel better, if Sharif or Simone would tag along? Do you want to go at all?“
“Other than those fighting on the other side, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Dumbledore, a few whose names I don’t know,” Draco took a deep
Aries covered both of them up and they drifted off, unaware of what was to come.
She wrapped her arms around his neck and he hugged her waist. “Merlin, I missed you. I know you like Draco, Harry. You should go for it. He likes you too.” She whispered really low. He just shook his head. He knew Draco could never feel that way about him. Definitely not care for a child that wasn’t his.
Happy Halloween Guys! To Celebrate I am giving you an extra long chapter.
Well I got my Covid test results back and I have it so I’m stuck in the house for the next two weeks at least. So I’ll be updating this as often as I can.
“You- I mean-You’re gay? How did your parents take that?”
“Alright, if you don’t mind Harry is now eating for two and I would like my son and granddaughter fed.” Snape went and sat down at his usual spot. Harry and Draco moved to go sit at the Gryffindor table when Minerva stopped them.
“Severus? It is nearly midnight. What is the meaning of this?” The man said.
“I’m in.” And another.
“Harry! Are you ok?” Dani asked.
“I am holding you to that. That means you can’t talk to anyone else. No one. I mean it.” They both climbed onto the train and found an empty compartment. Aries pulled out a book and started to read. He found this summer he actually enjoyed reading. Mostly Greek mythology. Right now he was reading a book written by a wizard about a summer camp for demigods. He was only halfway through the first book in the series, but he really liked the Luke character for some reason.
Groaning, Harry got up and walked quietly downstairs.
Harry looked up to see Ginny Weasley..
“Mother?” Draco asked bewildered.
Several things flashed in front of him and it took several seconds to realise they were all of his memories he had lost. He could remember everything. Small talks with Draco.
Finally A Luna explanation!!!
They all seemed to accept that answer and moved on. Aries spun the bottle again, this time stopping on Draco.
Draco stands abruptly. He grabs Harry’s hand and starts walking.
“Where is he? I want to see him. I have to make sure he is okay.” A woman yelled.
They just talked for most of the time until their door was thrown open.
She shrugged and got up. She walked to the door in their common room that connects to Snape's room. He answered shortly after she had knocked.
The next day not much happened for a while. Draco refused to go to classes and Snape visited Harry during his free periods. Currently the headmaster was there to discuss Ron’s punishment.
Alley to get some new clothes. He loved getting clothes that actually fit him and weren’t in tatters.
Harry grinned. “Well, hurry up. If you don’t I might just pop them both out waiting.”
“Do you know what you have done? Our Lord wants him dead! Any way he can get him. He’ll-”
“Aries Tom Riddle.”
Harry froze.“Dani? Dani is here? I didn’t hear her name when they were sorting. She isn’t magical. She was four when I left for Hogwarts and eight when Father took me in. She had never shown any accidental magic. Oh Merlin! Where is she? I need to talk to her!”  Harry jumped up.
She released the man and looked at Harry. “So, does this mean I get to be Aunt Dani? I mean you are my brother now.” Everyone laughed, but nodded their heads.
“Potter. Potter, you need to wake up. Potter. Harry?”
“Hi, Mrs.Malfoy.” Dani said in a small voice.
Chapter 14
“Oh, ok. I’m sorry. You shouldn’t regret it. We can just put it behind us and move-”
“You are going to come with me.” He set her to her feet. “Help me up. Can’t really do it myself anymore.” She grabbed his hand and helped him to his feet.
“Ok. Would you help me get his shirt and trousers off? They are covered in blood and I can’t work around them.”
“Are you sure about this? All of this? The baby, Lily and Malfoy?” He asked timidly.
“No he didn’t, love. I’m fine. Hermione and I are planning Lily’s shower, remember?” Harry nodded.
I made myself bawl my eyes out writing this!!
“Harry you are eighteen weeks pregnant. With the Dark Lord's baby.”
Harry tried to speak yet again, but no sound emerged from his mouth, so he shook his head. He couldn’t remember anything from after he was taken. He could remember talking about a study schedule for next years N.E.W.T.S. with Ron and Hermione while walking back to his dorm. Then could only remember the one conversation with that man.
It had been a long day.
Thank you so much for the Kudos and comments!! I am so glad you are liking this story so far!!
“Severus, he won’t want to see me. He’ll find out it was me and be horrified. He won’t believe me when I say I have changed from when he first met me. He won’t remember how much I care about him. How I was the one who helped him heal every time the Dark Lord was done using him. How close we became. I can’t, no, I won’t have my heart broken again.” The voice said.
“Look again, at the shape.”
This is it guys. the final chapter. Warning there is smut.
Sorry about all the mistakes in the last chapter. I went back and fixed them all...hopefully. I did write it at 3 am. Maybe this chapter will be better. Feel free to call out any mistakes you see as I am unbeta-ed.
Draco just stood there, mouth open, staring. Snape came to his side while smirking. He used one finger to close Draco’s mouth.
Aries got a scary look in his eye. “I dare you to kiss the person in the entire common room you want more than anything. I don’t mean a cute little peck, I mean a full on, tongue in mouth, moaning kis-”
“Alright the normal dose is three drops. You are to only take one. Why?”
“Harry? Could I talk to you?” I voice asked.
Soon it was time for both Harry and Draco to go to Diagon Alley to get their supplies for the coming school year. They put it off until they couldn’t wait any longer. Harry had owled Ron and Hermione to have them meet so they could talk and they had agreed to wait until then to see Harry. To say Harry was nervous would be a massive understatement.
During Harry’s imprisonment, the Dark Lord, made sure Draco got some alone time with Harry to do whatever he wanted as long as he didn’t rape him. He wanted to make sure the child Harry carried was his. Draco had listened. What the Dark Lord didn't know was how much he had always secretly thought Harry wasn’t so bad. During Draco’s “torture sessions” all they did was talk. The more they talked, the closer they got. The closer they got, the more Draco fell in love.
“Lily. I like that. You can stick to the frog theme and call her Lily pad.” Harry laughed at that. “Come on, let’s go talk to your father.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and led them out of Gryffindor Tower towards the dungeons.
Draco forward. They looked deep into each other's eyes for just a second and came to a silent agreement. Draco turned slightly and planted his butt right on Aries’ lap.
“I assure you he is fine. However, he is not your child. You cannot demand to see him.” Poppy said.
After Harry fell asleep, Draco and Hermione continued to plan. Turns out they had very similar tastes and agreed on most things. The things they didn’t, they easily came to a compromise. A little after midnight Hermione sat down her quill and looked at Draco expectantly.
“Um-” Harry started.
I know it is a short chapter, but I will update again very soon. Sorry!!
He looked at Hedwig with fear in his eyes. He got an idea. It was so stupid and it had a terriblely low chance of working. He grabbed the pen and notebook he kept in his room for when Ron and Hermione sent letters. He quickly wrote a short letter and gave it to Hedwig.
“You- you were dead. I saw- I saw him kill you.” Harry cried.
“Where are we going?” Hermione asked.
How can we possibly figure out anything to do with Tom Riddle. Tears started flowing down his face.
“Good.” Aries replied with a wink.
“You weren’t kidding about that birthmark.” Draco chuckled.
They didn’t know who moved first, but the next thing they knew, they were kissing. Lips caressing lips. Teeth clicking together. Tongues massaging tongues. It was sloppy. It was awkward. It was perfect.
Surprisingly Harry very much would, so he nodded.
„Erm… Yes. Probably. As you can see my wardrobe is rather dark and I’d like to change that.“
„What’s it for you, Harry?“
„Because“, Draco said „This evening is not supposed to be serious. Drink up, bitch“
„I needed some time off. It was a bit much. I believe in living up to your responsibilities… but everybody needs some time off.“
„Potter“, Malfoy drawled.
Harry gaped. That was a lot of information to process. Especially the Izzy punching him in the nose thing. The charity thing.  And also that he seemed to be the core of this little tight-knight group of people. But then again… even as his old, prickly self he had been a leader in House Slytherin. Maybe that was something he did.
