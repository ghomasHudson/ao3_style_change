After all, he wasn't really his boyfriend.
"No, thanks," Malfoy replied, accepting the glass he handed him and then raising it in a toast. "To Lucius"
He exhaled deeply, running a hand through his hair.
"If you spend a lot of time together and when you're not together you write notes ... and have sex ... then ..." she pointed out with enviable serenity.
“He's blackmailing me! Please don't hurt me! I did nothing!" he cried, trembling violently. Harry gave him a shake, causing him to whimper.
Draco scrambled to his feet, his legs and fingers trembling slightly as he took off his robe. He was wearing only the green silk pajama pants.
"Nothing," she hastened to reply, trying to put on a mask of innocence and honesty.
“A group of robbers tried to rob Gringotts this afternoon. They took eleven people hostage. Harry led the Auror assault, drawing all the spells upon himself to save the hostages ... too bad he was hit by three spells "
Harry let out a snort of laughter and sat down on the sofa opposite Malfoy. He took off his scarf, absently recording that all the Christmas decorations were strictly green and silver.
His hair perpetually disheveled, his cheeks slightly red from the cold, the sweater wrapped around his large shoulders. He was with Granger and a couple of other losers, who I didn't bother to notice.
"So ... how long ... Christ, I can't even tell," Weasley muttered with his mouth full. "You know what ... I don't want to know," he said.
He held them suspended between his index fingers and thumbs. "There is no turning back" he said.
I looked at them and envied them. My only chance to be happy is to be with Harry.
Harry's fingers ran down Draco's jaw in a sweet and creepy caress "... to touch you" luin sighed before bending down to kiss him.
He opened his lips in search of air, while Draco began to suck him as if he wanted to suck his soul away too.
Draco looked at the green irises, every little bit of his face and really wondered if he could give it up. He backed away from his touch. His heart had started beating madly. He walked over to Harry's study and saw the documents on the desk. He took them and went back to the kitchen.
After the curious glances that had greeted them in the stands and the chorus of giggles and chatter behind them, the evening had miraculously gone on well.
Draco had eaten, drank… sitting protectively between Harry and his mother. He was far from having fun or being able to admit it openly, but at least no curses had flown.
But Draco didn't laugh, he just plunged his long fingers into his hair and kissed him deeply.
Dear Mr. Malfoy,
"Sure," he retorted before leaving. I watched it until it disappeared into the crowd.
Eyes flooded with anger. The warm breath against his mouth. The solid and warm body. Harry could feel it even with all his clothes on. And then Harry thought he was glad to see him… that he wanted to kiss him and that he was stupid not to write to him.
“Indeed yes, Potter. That's my goal, "replied the former Slytherin, turning away from him and starting to climb the slope. Harry took the first steps not quite sure, but the teeth of the crampon gripped the frozen snow, not letting it slip. They began to climb the mountain, their breath condensing into white clouds in front of their mouths.
"But maybe I'm the one who worries too much" finally sighed the young witch, opening a history book of magical law "After all, what can happen in a week?"
Harry felt his stomach freeze as he opened the copy of the Daily Prophet.
He was messing everything up. It had to be just a game… something that would allow him to bother Potter for a reasonable amount of time and then he would have to go back to his old life. But everything was becoming confused ... Draco felt he was on the edge of a slope, just a little push and he would have slipped under.
He reverently watched Draco move over him. A tender moan fluttered out of his parted lips as he writhed following the touches of his fingers.
Harry realized that the article could have detrimental effects on his life when Mrs. Weasley felt compelled to give him
"Thanks for…"
Weasley smiled, the alcohol evaporating in sour whiffs from his body. "Harry? Nah. He is fine alone "
"He's making us breakfast"
He had survived a war. Certainly, he could face any new lie that Rita Skeeter had invented on him.
"What if ... if I wanted to date you?"
He found her sitting at her desk, her hair more curly than usual. Several empty cups scattered all over the place. Crookshanks slept curled up in a chair. The fur all ruffled. "Hey, am I bothering you?" Harry greeted her, scratching the cat's head with his fingertips. He rewarded him with a hoarse verse. He stretched and then went back to sleep.
I'll never see him in my bed naked with his hard cock.
"I killed a ten-year-old boy," he whispered.
at regular intervals.
"I'm sorry I gave you pain, but ... it's a decision that belongs only to me"
He threw the bottle at Malfoy, ordering him to get ready, then shook off the bathing suit soaked in salt water and pre-orgasmic liquid.
Harry just nodded, finishing his second glass of scotch. "Good," Draco whispered. “We leave on Friday evening and come back on Sunday. Do you have warm clothes and mountaineering equipment? "
“You made me think you threw it into the lake at Hogwarts. I did ... things ... because I was afraid that you would kill me too "
Draco
"Mh mh" he replied, his voice a little muddy.
I became a Death Eater, made fun of my former schoolmates, stood still watching a teacher being swallowed by Voldemort's snake, told a lot of lies and done many other things that I'm not proud of.
Where was he? Well, probably to save the magical world since he hadn't done anything else in the last eight years of his life!
“So what? They are not together” He pointed out and Theodore looked up at him “It’s not like he declared that he likes her, they’re friends”
“Really?” Pansy smiled silently “Guess I’m lucky” She said and paused when there was a knock on the door. He watched her took a deep breath and opened the door just so slightly, even Ron couldn’t see “Hey” He heard her spoke, but didn’t try to pry because if Pansy was careful about something, or someone, it was for the best, and he would never want to cross her “Are you sure you can do it?” Ron tried to hear the answer but the place was too loud with music and people talking already. Ron turned away for a second and when he turned back, Pansy was already handing the mask out to the guy out the door
Draco sipped on his champagne, watching Hermione and Pansy dancing in the dance floor, celebrating Hermione becoming Minster for Magic as someone startled him from behind with a familiar warmth. He looked up and saw Harry grinning at him “Hi”
She exclaimed “
“Come on” Draco smiled and quickly followed the girls. They walked to the water’s edge on the beach and watched Hermione and Pansy a few steps in front of them, it was peaceful and quiet this way, the water hitting Draco’s feet softly, the sand in his feet, Potter by his side.
Draco stared at the guy, he challenged Draco, and though he was always a cautious guy, he could not back out of this one. Draco dragged Potter up by his arm and pulled at his shirt, standing on his heels with their faces close to each other
“Okay, all you have to do is, you know, persuade customers that walk by to buy the cologne” Pansy held up the small bottle in her hand and demonstrated to Draco “Just say, ‘
“Bloody hell, are you mad at Harry?” Finnigan asked but was quickly nudged by his boyfriend
She gasped, elbowing him hard “I am
Alright, alright” Harry groaned, standing up and turned around to glare at the sly married couple who were smirking at him now while holding hands “I know what you’re doing. Just know that I’m
by the way I’m alright with it now so don’t apologise. And you hated Ron, for his family I guess. But…did you
“There is
“It hurts”
“Because I’m charming?” Harry teased, making Draco smack his chest playfully, he looked around the room and back at Draco “Draco, this day, August 22
“Oh…er” Harry scratched the nape of his neck, he was suddenly uncomfortable, Rose always saw him and Draco together so it was strange for her to see him alone “He’ll probably be here later”
“A little lower” He told Potter and heard a soft murmur from him
“Kitty?”
do it,
” Hermione said softly “Is that…for Draco?”
“Just a normal kiss is alright” Draco said, his eyes finally focused on Potter’s outfit, he was wearing a sweater with the letter H in the middle, he suspected Weasley’s mom had made it for Potter, then he was wearing a pair of black ripped jeans with the normal shoes he always wear everywhere, Potter didn’t like to wear anything fancy, Draco remembered that.
“I disagree with your accusation” Blaise merely said, a small smirk appeared at the corner of his lips.
It was the Great Hall, they were back at Hogwarts again, it’s been so long since they came back here. But the thing that amazed him more was the fact that it looked incredibly familiar
“What’s the drama today?” Ron heard her say but he didn’t focus on them, he walked to Blaise’s spot
“I‘m 40 now”
“I know, I know but…I, I like spending time with you” Harry mumbled, there were students around them, but Draco only cared about the boy before him “It’s nice to be with you”
“You dozed off after thirty minutes through the opera, Potter” Draco said and rubbed his sore shoulder “Not to mention, you slept on my shoulder for more than two hours”
“He is, big, you know” Pansy said and elbowed her wife “Right?”
“That’s basically everything we need to learn for the exam—Potter, what are you doing?” He asked and pointed at the book when Harry kept staring at him “This is where you need to look, not me”
“I thought you’d be able to be patient with him, after all, you’re the best at it” He chuckled, placing his hands on the table, his head turned when he saw Hermione walking in with Pansy again, behind them was Ron.
“Bring him back to the precinct” Draco watched as the police officer that saved him tapped on the police car with the creep inside and the car drove away. He was surprised to see it, he never really witnessed anything like this before, he was almost a victim to a horrible crime.
“What’s wrong?” Potter asked worriedly. How could he act so innocent like this? Draco felt the blush rising up to his cheeks and neck, he folded his arms across his chest and stepped back
Draco looked in his green emerald eyes, and tightening his grips without thinking “Yes” He said, earning a smile from Harry. Draco could hear his inner voice in his mind.
“Never,
!” He heard Pansy shrieked, her voice broke and he suspected she was crying too, but he didn’t care, he didn’t even want to let Draco go. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and leaned his forehead against Draco’s, their noses almost touched, Harry stared into Draco’s grey eyes and felt the biggest urge to kiss the blond.
batch of chocolates. He had sneaked back up and wrapped it in a box and kept it in his trunk until this morning. He intended to give it to Potter before first period, but the moment Potter stepped out of the dorm, his
” He squealed “Yours is huge and it’s my first time”
“Is everyone done with their potions?” Professor Slughorn asked as some of the students exclaimed that they weren’t done. It was three minutes until the final exam was over.
” She stopped them when Ron was about to sit next to Draco “You go here, Harry go there”
“I said that?” He wondered,
“Fancy a shag?” Draco hummed quietly when McLaggen asked him. The git was a fairly good shag anyway,
“Right…” Ron mumbled, Harry and Draco had a huge fight about the fact that Draco won’t tell his parents about his relationship with Harry even when they have been together for two years now. It all started when Pansy and Hermione knowingly put them both up for a blind date, after a year of pining over each other, everyone was tired of it, so the girls teamed up like the married couple they were so Harry and Draco both could stop being in denial. That worked magically as they became a couple just a month after that blind date. But things began to hit the bumpy road when Draco couldn’t tell his parents he was dating Harry, which made Harry sad because he thought he wasn’t important enough to Draco, and it created that big fight.
He cried out, his cock jerking and spurting all over his stomach. He could hear Harry murmuring that he was coming too, his hot fluid flowing inside Draco. The blond was breathing heavily when Harry thrusted in “
pub nights because we won’t go if the other is going, and we can’t even see each other’s face, and probably I will have to transfer to another department or maybe quit being an Auror, and then because we still live in the same country, I will have to move to my Manor in France because I can’t bare to see his face. And because I live in France, I can’t see you guys and because you guys obviously love Potter more, I will be the one who’s cast out of the group, and I will live alone in my empty Manor with no one by my side and one day the neighbour will call the Aurors and found out that I’ve died of old age in my kitchen and because I live alone, no one knows and I-…”
Ron yelled, suddenly locking Harry’s arms and shoulders from behind when the door to their office was barged open with Blaise, Dean, Seamus and Neville running to his chair as quick as a flash
“You…
” Pansy coughed loudly between each words and sipped on her red wine, glancing at them before getting back to her meal, making their friends laughed quietly nearby
“That still doesn’t mean anything” He bit on his lower lip, remembering what happened the night before that made him run “You’re with Ginny”
” Pansy gasped, her hand rested on her chest, she took off her jacket and fanned her face “This is so surprising, why am I suddenly hot?”
“If we are together there, and Blaise and Ron, or even Ginny and Luna, then maybe there’s hope for you and Harry, that’s all I’m saying, if you want to act on it once you get back there”
“Blaise will help you” He said, his lips curled into a smile “He’s good at that”
“I was…packing” He said, as Potter’s eyes shining with shock and joy when he heard Draco “We have to visit your dad tomorrow, right?”
“You must have a bad mouth in bed, oh wait, you do”
“Oh, bloody hell” Ron mumbled “I look…”
he also got a scar, look! Right on his forehead”
“Fine, be stubborn, don’t come crying to me later when your arm is broken”
Luna said, making Draco anxious and he gripped tightly on their hands, pointing at it and stepping closer to Harry
“Great show, honestly” Blaise said while draping his arm over Ron and gave them a slow clap “We rarely ever get to watch live porn”
you weren’t feeling well” Pansy looked at him with a smirk “Suddenly feel better?”
Pansy said, her eyes opened wide, he knew what that meant now, it meant that they were doing everything else except studying “And don’t bother asking about Theodore, he’s at the greenhouse with Neville. Look, he isn’t going to kill you, he just wants to talk. You owe him an explanation, that’s the least you could do” She tilted her head to the side and sat down next to Hermione, leaning her back on the chair behind her “Whenever you’re ready, just come in” Draco stood outside of the Common Room and balled his hands into fists. He could just go back to his dorm, it wasn’t like he has nowhere to go, but what Pansy said really hit him, he did owe Potter an explanation. The blond sighed softly and stepped inside, settling himself on the long red couch, none of the students were here, just some of them passing by every few minutes. It wasn’t like the world he knew, where everyone was just at their House, no one crossing over to the other. When he was here, he realised everyone was friends with everyone, it was peaceful, and it was much better than his world.
She pointed at the two of them before walking out of the door and closed it
” Pansy squealed loudly and stomped her feet repeatedly on the ground “This is so cute, he
“I got…baby ducks?” Anthony Goldstein murmured “I thought this was supposed to be strong and powerful?”
“I think you need it more, with your cold hands and all” Potter shrugged, giving him a lopsided grin, and Draco won’t admit the smile gave him a tingling feeling in his stomach.
helping” Draco saw Hermione nudging her wife through the screen with a sigh “It’s alright, he’s not worth your tears”
“Thank you, you’re really brilliant” Goldstein looked at him with a smile, Draco hummed and continued the preparation
“We all kind of figured it all out eventually” Pansy chuckled “I swear Harry wasn’t really subtle, every week on our pub night, another person asked Hermione and I,
insisted” Draco pointed at Pansy, who was talking to Hermione and Astoria chuckled, her gentle smile, her bright eyes, it reminded him of the time she confessed her feelings for him in Eighth Year, it was the last time he ever saw her “Why are you here?”
“Are you seducing me?” He smiled and Harry gave him a lopsided smile, pulling him closer “Because we just did it like less than five minutes ago”
“I’m just saying.
“That’s
” Draco and Pansy both said in unison, the blond quickly rushed to the man, he couldn’t believe he
“So, how was work?”
neck and kneeled down on his knees, stroking him quicker, and then Blaise was jerking, Ron closed his eyes and felt Blaise’s hot fluid shooting at his face, some got in his opened mouth, and he opened his eyes once Blaise was done. Ron licked his lips, feeling the salty taste and Blaise pulled him up for a kiss
“Because…you know, because…because” Draco stuttered, and he never stutter. The blond sipped from his beer and looked away so they couldn’t see the hesitation in his eyes. Harry of course was still baffled by the news. Draco said
“Crookshanks” Potter said, raising his arm and pointing at the small scratch near his wrist. The blond stared at the Gryffindor and it was this moment he thought Potter could not get anymore dramatic “It’s Hermione’s cat, and he scratched me”
“What?”
“What’s wrong?” When Hermione asked, he knew she noticed it too
“Do you think I look decent for this?” He looked down at his robes and the gifts in his hands. It was actually Ron’s suggestion to invite him over at the Burrow for Christmas with Harry. He has also started calling Harry’s friends by their first names, it took him almost ten months ever since he became friends with Harry to get on good terms with Ron, for Hermione it was three months and six months with Ginny. He was anxious because the Weasley was Harry’s second family, and he wanted them to like him.
in this world to make sure you know I like you. I can even wear a shirt saying ‘
“An Unbreakable Vow if you want”
, I may have experie—…”
“True that” Ginny nodded proudly, sipping from her coffee mug “We are
“This is our promise rings” Harry said, slipping the band on Draco’s ring finger gently “I know we’re still young, but this is a promise from me to you, that I will do everything I can to make you happy. Then, maybe after a while, I can ask for your hand in marriage”
“Alright, Gryffindor Common Room, tomorrow night” Pansy sprawled on Blaise’s bed freely like it was hers “The party starts at eight. You can wear anything”
cheat on you. And infidelity is a horrible, horrible action in my opinion, I would never condone it. So I guess…it’s a yes from me”
“Now tell me why you said you aren’t the Draco I know” She said, and he began telling her the truth, even here, Pansy was still his best friend, who he could always tell everything to. He told her how he found the mirror, how he saw Potter and him kissing and then he tried to destroy it. And lastly, he told her what his world was like.
“Do you think I’ll just let anyone hold my hand?” Draco grinned at him, amused by the way Harry was so oblivious about everything “I’m not that easy, Harry”
“No, seriously” Theo put his hand on Draco’s thigh, squeezing it tightly “I can feel it”
“When you first hugged me when they told me I’m a Healer, I couldn’t sleep that night, I wasn’t sure if I was too happy because I became a Healer or because you hugged me, but now I think it’s the latter” Draco smiled, reading from his notes “When you first called me
“Where’s Neville? He was just there” Theo asked
” Draco moaned when Potter’s fingers breached him, he arched his back a bit, his heels digging on the carpet, with Potter’s mouth making marks all over Draco’s chest, sucking on his hard buds, and his fingers working inside Draco, his other hand squeezing the blond’s arse hard, he felt his skin burning with anticipation and pleasure, he wanted
“I’ll…we’ll just go to the kitchen to see Ron and Blaise” Harry said, earning a discreet nod from Pansy while Draco stood there in silence, his eyes locked with Harry’s, Harry exhaled and turned around, carrying the still squealing kid on his arms to the direction of the kitchen. He pushed the door open and saw his best friend in chef uniform.
“Yeah, Pansy told us to come to the pub tonight” Theo said, if he didn’t come, Pansy would have him killed
“Turn around” Harry growled into his ear “Now”
“I was being polite, I always do that”
“Do you think we looked like a real married couple?” Potter asked unexpectedly
“I was” Pansy added and kissed Hermione’s cheek “I’m sorry”
“You know just what to say to rile me up, don’t you?” Draco huffed out a laugh at him and nodded, his hand never stop stroking “Challenge accepted,
Draco squealed when Potter ambushed him from behind and carried him up in his arms, in reflex his arms went up to wrap around Potter’s neck “
mean Cormac gets to kiss Draco. And we all know how much Cormac wants to do it. Right, Hermione?”
stuff when I see him, so I couldn’t take it anymore and made a pact with Pansy, to confess to our crushes when we’re 20 if we’re still not over it by then”
” He pleaded and Harry finally pulled out, the blond sat up as Harry placed his cock at his entrance. Draco lowered himself down and whimpered. At first, getting used to Harry’s size took some time, but now, his arse felt empty without Harry.
He let out a low chirp as Potter's hand suddenly closed on his buttock, covered only by the thin fabric of his boxers. A mixture of excitement, shame and anger made his lower abdomen twist. He turned to him. His heavy breath of alcohol on his lips. The dark unshaven cheeks. And again that obscene smile of his.
Maybe he spends every night with him.
Is it too late to change the wish expressed in my last letter?
“Do you remember what his surname is? Maybe we can find out where he lives, go there and put a lot of fear on him so that he leaves Draco alone. "
"Did you come here in these conditions because you were afraid I would be pissed if I didn't skip dinner?"
"I would have gone on for hours and hours and hours ..."
“Draky, love… don't do that…” she said, drawing more glances at them. Draco really should have changed friends. He had to find someone less… Slytherin. And for once, Slytherin wasn't used as a compliment.
Instead I went to the desk
he read aloud
"That's enough," he said, moving on the mattress. I stroked his legs with my hands up to his hips, I sat on him. His hair fell over his eyes, his muscular arms outstretched and his fingers hooked to the head of the bed.
"What if Malfoy doesn't want to break up with you?"
Let's be clear: he's a former Gryffindor and he's one of those boring, trustworthy guys who show up on a date at least ten minutes early and hope to have lots of kids in the future. I mean, he makes me throw up. But in my opinion - and therefore it is the absolute truth - he is Pansy's soul mate. She still doesn't understand it but cyclically returns to him.
The XXXXXX law firm
"You have…"
"Me too" I said and then kissed him.
"But now that you are married, you must at least take the coat of arms ... the one above your grandmother's fireplace ..."
Harry smiled. "Really?"
Harry wiped his hands on his jeans, starting to follow her to the Burrow. "Why not?"
Draco Malfoy
Draco Malfoy had been a lot of things in his now thirty-something life, but he was pretty sure he had never been this bad. He pressed the pillow to his face, cursing the entire universe for forgetting to draw the curtains. What did those damned house elves pay for? He would have fired them all… or he would have run for parliament and canceled all their newly acquired rights.
“God, thank you. If you woke up with a naked woman in bed…” she said, shivering with disgust. She smiled, then moving to the edge of the chair, as if she could physically take the words out of his mouth. "Who was…"
"Of course, dear"
Draco recognized a couple of former Gryffindors among them, including the brain-damaged redhead.
He liked Malfoy but not in that sense… he couldn't imagine the two of them as a couple… The whole situation was too surreal.
"Yes," whispered the former Slytherin, leaning on his shoulder to get back on his feet. His face was incredibly pale. "I'm fine, don't worry," he whispered, but his legs gave him away and Harry was forced to hold him fully.
"Hello," he murmured softly, shoulders hunched forward. A shadow of undone beard to obscure his cheeks.
Draco woke quietly, emerging from the tentacles of sleep without jolt. He glanced out the window to understand what time it was. Certainly just before dawn. He would have to get up and go home to get ready and then go to work. He slowly turned over in the sheets. Potter's bed was incredibly comfortable.
I am writing this letter to tell you that if you are doing something ... well it is not enough!
"Malfoy!"
this morning. Nice scarf,” Ginny replied, shrugging slightly.
"Yes, Master Potter?" the elf replied, wiping his wrinkled hands in his apron tied at the waist. Harry quickly put on his jacket, running a hand through his messed-up hair.
“I'm afraid we need a bigger closet. But how many clothes do you have? "
"They suspended me," Potter replied, taking the paper back and slipping it into his pocket. “I'm an Auror, asshole. They could have drugged me to make me confess something, to extort state secrets from me ... there will be an investigation. "
Hermione's voice was farther and farther away, Malfoy's shoulder less real under his cheek. He inhaled the smell of his skin, only absently realizing that the former Slytherin was carrying him into the bedroom.
Harry sat down by the fireplace, eating the meatloaf and trying to make himself invisible. "Harry, dear, I'm counting an extra seat for your date at the Christmas dinner," Molly said, consulting the to-do list she always carried with her now. It wasn't exactly a question.
“After the war, Harry was hospitalized for weeks at Saint Mungo's. Rita Skeeter managed to get some photos ... they have been published everywhere with the most absurd captions "she told him" That's why Harry doesn't want to stay here ... I think if he didn't even tell me about your wedding it means that he doesn't like it news becomes public "
Anyone who thought that a relationship that began on such difficult grounds as theirs - their past, Lucius' tragic death - had already overcome the most difficult rocks, was wrong. Overcoming the small daily misunderstandings was the real test.
Harry smiled lazily, brushing his lips with his. “Why don't you take the rest of the day off and…”. Harry froze when he heard someone clear his throat noisily to get their attention.
"And I'll ask Harry all the details about the ceremony and how you fell in love"
“You're scary,” Harry murmured, “you're great, but you're scary. I really don't know how Voldemort thought he could beat us with you by my side "
I let it drain at least half a pint before I grabbed my lousy beer and walked over.
"Put your clothes on and go away," he said, as soon as he heard the stranger give a yelp of pain. He grabbed a towel with a brusque gesture, then returned to the bedroom. "I told you to..."
Harry grimaced, sniffing the cup unconvinced. He would have preferred coffee by far. Black. He was about to sit down at the table, but something held him back.
Draco looked down. He had always admired that aspect of Potter, his way of dealing with things directly, without half measures, without fear of the consequences.
She raised her eyebrows in a surprised expression. "Isn't that the most important thing?"
She just looked at him with an arched eyebrow. "And your cell phone too"
“Still, your skin is brighter,” she said, placing two fingers under his chin. "Even the eyes ..." She looked at him thoroughly, until he looked away embarrassed.
Hermione let out a long snort, bringing the spoon to her lips.
"Oh yeah, the scratches are right here ..." Hermione said pointing to the side of her neck.
“What about Potter instead? Does he have a fantastic boyfriend like you too? "
"I usually sleep naked"
“Yes, Pansy told me she saw him at a party. He was happily groping his girlfriend "
“I know that, Mr. Weasley, but it's the rules. We have already alerted family members. They are arriving."
Draco snapped his eyelids up. No, everyone except him… except the lousy bastard, his ex par excellence.
However, I hope you want to keep reading until the end.
"Malfoy" hissed threateningly, as a barn owl and a third owl joined the first two.
Harry froze as a short-haired girl ran across the street and threw her arms around Roger's neck. The guy responded enthusiastically to her hug, then kissed her deeply.
I'm his. Totally. He can do anything to me, even the most perverse things he can think of.
Harry just arched his lips, writhing on the mattress. His hand still clinging to Draco's. "You're a bad liar," he said.
"I'm not a traditionalist" he repeated, not quite sure what the word meant "... but it's ... Malfoy" he added as if his last name were a dirty word.
"A very stupid guy," he replied. "I'm waiting for him to notice me, but his stupidity is beyond the limits of human understanding"
," Harry retorted. "It's a…"
Draco shook his head. He'd done a lot of drunken bullshit, but that surpassed them all. That ... wait. He was the king of bullshit, but not Potter ... not the perfect, fair and brave Potter. He tightened his grip on his trousers and yanked him towards him.
I feel awful. What if Harry was in love with that Auror?
"Thankfully, you love me," Harry comments, finishing his beer in two long gulps.
He felt him tremble again, but he was pretty sure it wasn't fear.
Could he adapt to such a story in his heart?
Harry was sure of it.
I do not hide that I was disappointed with your answer. After years and years of correspondence - univocal - I thought I deserved something more than a pre-press response.
Draco
"I hope you liked my gifts," Harry replied, fighting the urge to grab him and start shaking him hard.
He started to shake it off, but Malfoy anticipated it by stepping back and returning to the house. He was smiling so much that he seemed to have just come out of a toothpaste ad.
Potter doesn't want me.
"They think the two of us are together," Harry continued, looking for the evil words with his eyes. Obscenely big. All of London ... no, no, not all of London ... all of England thought he had
Yesterday I saw Harry in Diagon Alley.
"What? W-why? "
"I'm not gay!" he yelled, clenching his fork tightly in his fist.
"LA LA LA LA LA" Hermione screamed, heading head down to her room, still keeping her palms pressed to her ears.
"Would it help you if I sucked your dick first?"
Draco was evaluating the position of the car and then the group of reporters when Pansy passed him. She pulled Weasley's jacket off his shoulders, then adjusted the top. "What do you have…"
"As I told you, her husband will be here shortly ..." the doctor replied, ignoring Auror's statement.
They'd been playing that game for years and Harry knew she'd get to the point eventually. It was up to him whether to drag her out, making her nervous, or to give in to her questions.
He placed the paper on his pillow and then left the room.
"Fuck… fuck…" he cursed, getting to his feet and immediately slipping into his jeans. He made a face, feeling the fabric painfully pull on his erection. “I promised to keep the kids today… I'm an idiot… sorry…” he grumbled, bumping into the cluttered chair before stepping out into the hall.
“Malfoy, it's me. Open it up. ”He growled barely avoiding blowing up the door with a spell just to speed things up. "What the fuck ..." he whispered as Draco's pale face filled his view.
Harry swallowed hard, getting lost in Draco's deep gray irises. He squinted when the former Slytherin erased the distance that separated them and kissed him softly. “I just want you to be with me,” he sighed on his mouth.
Okay, that was interesting. Very gay, but very interesting.
If only Malfoy had remained completely still ... If only he hadn't chosen that moment to look down at his lips and gulp nervously, Harry's mind wouldn't have frozen on the thought of kissing.
The Auror first looked at his friend and then turned to Pansy who was kicking someone. "Make sure she doesn't kill anyone," Hermione told him, opening the car door. Ron hesitated only a moment before running in the opposite direction.
"For today I think I have taken my maximum dose of caffeine," he said and a puff of wind ruffled his hair. Oh man, you have no idea how gorgeous it is.
It was going to be a long night.
"Fine," he hissed, before marching out of the room.
Okay, maybe someone deserved to be given to dementors.
Draco sobbed harshly as Potter leaned over and caught his mouth for a searing kiss. He just pulled away to take off his shirt and throw it somewhere.
Malfoy Manor was teeming with bellboys entering and exiting a back door. Harry raised the collar of his jacket a little and headed for the main entrance. He didn't even have time to knock that Draco appeared in the doorway. A happy smile printed on the face, unbearably perfect hair.
Draco turned to him, but the welcoming smile froze on his lips as he noticed his expression. He erased the distance that separated them and placed his hands on Draco's arms. "Are you OK?" he asked, his eyes filled with concern.
"I thought you must be hungry," he said, reaching for the bed and sitting on the edge
"Harry" repeated the former Slytherin in a whisper, before joining their lips in a light kiss.
Potter took his wand and motioned for him to sit on the sofa. Draco complied, making an effort to appear casual. His heart showed no sign of wanting to stop beating madly and his stomach was reduced to a single aching tangle. He hated himself. He had always been a confident person, only the damn Potter could make him feel indecisive… and the more insecure he felt, the more his bitch side took hold.
"A week," he whispered, avoiding looking at him. He tensed when Malfoy relaxed slightly against him. His hair that touched his cheek in a soft caress.
"He made me pretend to be his jealous ex boyfriend," he replied, forgetting to breathe. “I didn't want to do it. Really. But Malfoy has certain… things… about me. He uses them to blackmail me. I never touched him ... I swear ... he did it all by himself, using spells of illusion. "
Harry grimaced when his cell phone started ringing again. He pulled it out of his back pocket and turned it off without even checking how many missed calls from Hermione there were.
So ... we've come to the end of this story. I hope it has entertained you :-) Thanks to all those who have read, followed, commented on it ... :-)
"Nothing"
"I'm not gay" came out much more acute than he would have liked. Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in a conscious expression, nodding a few times. She didn't believe him. It was clear that she wasn't believing him.
Harry rapidly withdrew his hand, waving on the chair. He looked towards the girls, but nobody seemed to look after him.
"What?"
“It'll hurt if you don't relax,” he muttered, running his hands over his waist and tucking them under his shirt. His palms. Potter knew what to do. His hands were warm, strong… Draco would let him do whatever he wanted.
He wasn't even sure they'd closed the front door, damn it!
Potter's hand landed on his side and Draco felt a shiver run down his spine. He let Potter get close enough to feel his breath on his face. "Sunday. I have tickets to The Cannons vs. the Wasp, ”he whispered.
"Fuck" Harry sobbed, stretching his arms back and lacing his fingers to the keyboard of the bed.
His mind was all messed up.
Harry kicked off his shoes, then fell onto the bed. It was incredibly comfortable and wide… and then Draco was on top of it. Draco's mouth on his.
His secretary tried to stop him, but he ignored her and told her he didn't want to be disturbed. He closed the door behind him when a hand grabbed him by the shoulder. In sequence he realized that Potter was in his office, that he was about to punch him in the face and that he was still incredibly sexy.
Harry fell silent. What could he say to someone who had just taken down their father hanging from the chandelier? Malfoy drew him out of embarrassment, merely climbing upstairs with a slow pace.
"Listen ..." Draco murmured in a suspiciously reasonable tone "Play the part of my fantastic, fake boyfriend for a few more days … just the time needed to make him understand that we are happy together and that he must leave me alone"
Draco watched him bend over again and take two packets of condoms off the floor. They were open and empty. For a second the flash of himself opening one with his teeth crossed his mind.
“After a crucio, he wouldn't ignore me anymore,” she said, taking a sip.
He let out a low moan as Potter pulled away and he realized his condition: sweaty and in shorts wet with semen, his and Potter's. Harry laughed softly, his lips curved in a half smile.
Harry scowled "I'm not something to be won!"
Harry shook his head at the Tom Riddle looking Voldemort. "It's just your appearance came as a shock, you’re not a snake mutant anymore"
Harry gave a weak smile "Drake you’re the best!"
When they woke up they were greeted by an angry Madam Pomfrey.
Draco nodded, "See you later Harry"
Ron nodded "Yeah what is he thinking sending you to the snake's den?"
"It makes you human" Harry smiled "A stupid and reckless human... But human most people would do the same thing you did to save the people they love not everyone but most."
“Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t want I title.”
Harry tried to remember how he got here but the last thing he remembered was running from the Dursley's after Vernon attacked him. Who had saved him? He didn't recognise anything around him so he couldn't be at the headquarters of the order of the Phoenix then Harry soon started to panic what of someone from the order had found him and were going to force him to fight for them. Harry scoffed there would no way he would fight he thought it was ridiculous that they put the fate of the war in a child's hands, he only just finished Hogwarts and they expected him to be able to defeat the freaking dark lord, one of the most powerful wizards since the founders of Hogwarts themselves...yeah right.
As Harry smiled the hat whispered to him "Watch your back Harry, he isn't happy."
"That's because Draco is a huge prat." Harry smiled at the offended look  on Draco's face, he looked like he was about to reply when Voldemort cast a silencing charm on both of the teens.
together with Harry in the middle; none of them said a word as their friends looked at them puzzled.
It was driving Hermione mad.
Draco gave him a bright smile before pulling him into another tight embrace. Harry held onto Draco as he was left to his own thoughts.
“We are utterly and completely yours Harry.” Tom whispered in his ear. “Just shut up and enjoy it.”
"Yeah she won't have to copy me anymore." Theo smiled
Harry chuckled as Hermione grabbed his hand and began leading him to the Gryffindor common room. "I'm glad you finally decided to kick him out of your life, you really do deserve better."
"That's for me to know and for you to find out!"
Pansy slapped him on the butt. "Go get him tiger."
Tom shook his head “I can't let you go unprotected into Dumbledore's clutches, I want to keep you safe"
"What no way! Who are they?” They asked wide eyed.
"No one here will speak of what transpired tonight, Potter, You have my word." Voldemort shoed him once again.
Draco groaned and Harry laughed "Of course he doesn't because it's the best!"
Voldemort chuckled "I don’t think, I know I am and it’s not just compared to Muggleborns its to everyone."
Harry couldn’t help it any longer. “Fuck yes!”
Harry smirked but shook his head. “Don’t plan to."
"Stupid Uncle Vernon and his temper" at least the man would finally get his wish, Harry would soon no longer exist in this world and would be reunited with his family.
Draco quickly sorted out his appearance while Harry put on his mask; they walked down the hall hand in hand, both trying to show they would follow Harry to the end of the earth.
"Not that I am aware of, not without me killing you which is counterproductive." Voldemort answered curtly
"Your studies come first."
Tom kissed Harry again, this time pushing harry back onto the bed as he poured every emotion he felt for the teen into the kiss, and Harry returned the kiss with the same amount of emotion. The kiss lasted a few minutes before they pulled away. Harry later fell asleep lying on Tom’s chest, listening to his heartbeat.
"Oh so I never rushed into things to save people almost killing myself in the process, I have a saving people thing... Even Hermione says so?"
"Potter feet of the table, has no one ever taught you manners." Draco scoffed
"Why the sudden change of heart? What about the prophecy?"
Harry started with the same question as Voldemort. "What is your full name?"
Soon Harry wasn’t the only one naked as the two put on a show of taking each others clothes off.
"I can't believe your trying to blame me for your lack of skills!"
Everyone snickered behind their hands not wanting to anger the dark lord.
"No I'm want you to give them to Draco for me...OF COURSE I'm giving them to you. But I expect to read one day."
Harry smiled "It's something I have to do.”
Harry chuckled “Not any more Molly I blood adopted them".
Arthur pulled his wife and son behind him "We treated you like a son and this is how you repay us...by torturing my son?"
"SIRIUS AND REMUS!" Draco shouted.
Hermione looked back at Harry stopping. "So you don't think he is like the others?"
He reached into a basket and pulled out chocolate fondue, with banana, cherry and strawberries. "I thought since we have already had dinner in the hall desert was the best option."
Tom smiled "He won't much longer."
The only person from their little group who hadn't performed the charm properly yet was surprisingly Hermione all she had been able to conjure was the shield, even with Harry’s help over the summer she still hadn’t succeeded with a corporeal patronus. Harry had to remind her at lunch that others hadn't even gotten that far that all she had to do was find a stronger memory and she would have the charm done. "Seriously Hermione it took me three weeks to get where you’re at, and even longer to produce a stag.”
"Harry you will be fine" Draco smiled at Harry “Honestly I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be brave"
Draco gave Harry a small smile. “You mean he didn’t tell you?”
Dumbledore sighed "Okay but I don't think anything will become of it." Dumbledore did not look happy but he didn’t like the attention this was receiving so he gave in.
“The death eaters would get confused if you and Tom both are the Dark Lord, you have to be something different but Prince wouldn’t be equal to Tom.”
The others who understood what he meant joined in the laughter.
Lucius nodded "I'm certain of it."
Tom winked "try me."
Tom looked at Harry shocked. “You love us?”
Harry gave her a disbelieving look “He could have tampered with it, I know it possible."
**********************************************************************************
Draco Malfoy now owned jeans.
Hermione shook her head "They know you’re not."
"You said are you going to stand there all night or are you going to feed me." Draco chuckled “Now open wide."
"YOU’RE A FUCKING FAGGOT AS WELL AS TRAITOR... I SLEPT IN THE SAME ROOM AS YOU" Ron had a plain look of horror on his face.
Dumbledore nodded. "You are right Harry, forgive me I just worry about your safety, I want whats best for you."
“I’m NOT a GIRL!” Harry protested.
The three laughed before Harry looked at the time.
Boy was everyone in for a shock...
Over the next couple of days Draco came over, the three teenagers were practically inseparable; Draco had decorated Harry's room with black leather couches, a king size bed with silky sliver sheets, a fancy chandler, posters of the England Quidditch team. He charmed the walls a sapphire blue which surprised Harry at first but when he asked Draco he said "My rooms green they can't be identical"
They continued having their deep and meaningful conversation both continuing to tease each other until Harry fell asleep on Draco, instead of waking him he ran his fingers through his black silky hair. Draco smiled down at Harry, to him Harry looked so peaceful while sleeping, with his cheeks slightly flushed and a small relaxed smile. It made Draco wonder how much sleep the teen was getting, he knew with Sirius back another weight would be lifted from Harry's shoulders, but he knew there was something else playing on the boys mind... He just wished he knew what that something was.
"He went to see Sirius and Remus.” Draco replied.
Silence followed for a few minute tears ran down Molly's eyes as she knew it to be true she could hear it in his voice.
“Harry so help me if you don't get in this bed right now-" he never got to finish the sentence as Harry climbed into the blankets and curled up near him. “So what are we reading?"
"You really need to teach me that someday."
“You mean all three of us?” Harry question as the other two smirking at each other as they leaned forward and snogged each other leaning over Harry so they were in clear view. Harry’s eyes widened as he watched the two make out. He shared the same thoughts as Tom earlier, it was hot.
Draco frowned "What are you talking about Harry?"
Harry could tell the other was feeling rather jealous and gave Tom a small smile. “Wouldn’t want to ruin your big bad dark lord reputation, you cannot be seen cuddling the chosen one.”
Harry tilted his head. "So neither you nor your followers will try to kill me anymore."
"Harry how could you got to Dumbledore without telling anyone!" Draco exclaimed
Hermione moved to sit next to Harry, they sat like that for hours just in silence watching after the blonde. Hermione then demanded that they get sleep, she tucked him into one of the hospital beds and then joined him. She kept him in a comfortable embrace, knowing that he was still here if Draco needed him and Hermione was there to help, he fell into a calm sleep.
They all sat there talking for a while before Madam Pomfrey kicked them out for dinner, telling them that visiting time was over.
Remus and Sirius pulled Harry into a bear hug. “Three weeks, we have been stuck in here worried sick about you and you didn’t so much as use the mirror.” Sirius scolded.
Harry's eyes widened, he didn’t want to answer, he tried not to talk but the potion wouldn’t let him stay silent either. "I just don’t care anymore, I don’t want to die but everyone seems hell-bent on putting me in the dangerous positions, my life isn’t spectacular as most people expect, its miserable so if my death happens, it happens, what’s my life compared to everyone else’s?" Harry cursed he really didn’t think Voldemort would have asked him such a personal question.
"Okay let me give you a clue." Harry smiled as the Slytherin's leaned closer excited."Okay well, I'm known as Prongslett."
"Peter Pettigrew, but he was kicked out after betraying my parents" Harry scowled
“What do you say Harry? Want to give it a try?” Draco and Tom asked in harmony.
So pleasing in fact they left Hogsmeade early so that no one would be in the castle when they returned, Harry had made plans to get them back in his bed after all, after a few words spoken it wasn’t very hard, nothing was holding them back
“Oh my god.” Harry felt like he was going to explode. He dug his fingers into Draco’s back as Tom pulled out and inside once again. Draco also began to move, rolling his hips, moaning as Harry hit his prostate with each thrust.
Before Harry could say anything, Hermione had him in a bone crushing hug. "Oh Harry, thank Merlin you’re okay". Before Harry could complain she spoke “Harry what are you doing out of bed, you shouldn’t be walking around, in your condition”
Harry stated that he would join them at breakfast after he had a shower, they all agreed and left without him.
The day passed quickly, classes were cancelled because none of the teachers could calm anyone down long enough to hold their attention, most of the Professors joined in the laughter after that, mainly because Snape and Dumbledore appeared to be the only two of the adults effected. Harry’s friend tried to get out of him what he had done but he kept quiet the only thing he said was "It's for me and the last of the maurders to know." Hermione groaned she knew that meant Remus and Sirius had something to with it, though she didn't mention anything when everyone question Harry about the maurders this would be fun. She smiled.
"I have my secrets, now leave my sight before I change my mind about punishing you"
Harry tried to fight even though he knew it was useless, instead he started ranting. "Fuck!, why do you think, I have had you try to kill me for as long as i have been alive, my only family hate my very existence and wish you killed me when you had the chance and treat me worse the Lucius Malfoy treats his houselves. My godfather died in front of me, he was all I had left.  Everyone expects so much from me and when I don’t live up their expectations, I am hated, I’m famous for something awful or what about the fact that every evil thing you do I’m blamed for because I am supposed to have killed you when i was a baby, so it’s my fault that you roaming about and everyone expects me to something about it even though I am only sixteen and despite all this I’m still expected to go to classes and act like nothing is wrong, oh and no one tells me anything and I constantly feel trapped in a role and just want to run away, I want things to end."
Harry yawned so Hermione left him to sleep, with strict orders not to leave the bed before kissing him on the forehead and promising to visit him tomorrow. Harry let his head rest on the pillow and slowly drift to sleep.
Draco tilted his head "What kept them with Dumbledork?"
Harry was silent as he walked to class with his two best friends, neither of them noticed as they were arguing with each other, but one never knew with Hermione, that girl could multitask like a pro, she might pounce later when she was one hundred percent that something was wrong with Harry, it was only early in the morning and he clearly didn’t get much sleep, so she could just be justifying his silence as him being tired. The three sat in their normal seats at the back of the classroom with Harry in the middle of the two. Harry was supposed to be a mediator between the two but just didn’t feel like it today. He got out his parchment and quill and opened his textbook to the appropriate page before resting his head on the desk, while waiting to make his dramatic entrance he did every lesson. He didn’t see Malfoy spare him a glance as he took his usual spot in the front row. Then Harry's hair began to stand on edge as he sensed danger, he quickly stood whipped out his wand and cast a protego around himself as he scanned the area, to the shock to most of the class, a handful of students had also sensed something off and had acted as Harry had. Before the people sit seated could question the oddity, stunning spells came from all directions, stunning all those who hadn’t acted and the ones who had were ordered to renovate them as Snape walked into the room. Once that was done he barked at everyone to sit.
"You've kissed him haven't you?" When Harry nodded Tom gave him a painful look before releasing him. "Very well Harry I will give you space to think, but do not avoid us, you won't be able to know what you want unless you spend time with us."
“Both Weasley’s have never needed a reason to hex me before so this probably would have still happened eventually.”
Harry laughed "It sure isn't my cup of tea."
With that Harry got up and left the office and made his way back down to the Great Hall with any luck he would make it in time to grab a peice of toast before his first class.
“Oh Raven, this is your last chance to back out, I want you.” Tom whispered hotly
Draco Malfoy now owned jeans.
Fortunately Snape had been in his office when he arrived, he did seem put out to see Harry but it seemed he had expected it all the same.
"I'll deal with him soon"
Harry smiled "Well of course you would, I'm your best pawn in the war."
It took Harry a second until he turned to Hermione glaring, who scaring lay smirked at him. “Next time you won't smudge chocolate on me"
Harry chuckled and went back to eating while reading a book which was about the wizard and goblin war back in 1987 way more interesting than anything that came out of Professor Binn's mouth. "So before the war wizards and goblins got along they weren't just civil."
Voldemort rolled his eyes. “Well as pleasurable as being your lord would be, since you decline, Voldemort or if you must Tom will be fine, but twist my name into some horrible nickname and I will reach down your throat and rip out your lungs.”
"Why share a bed then? I dare say they is enough to be in separate beds?"
When they arrived at the serpents enclosure, Harry smiled. He then read the information bored.
“I didn’t expect Harry to let you out of his sight any time soon.” Neville spoke to Draco.
Harry smiled "Let me know if you find anything will you?"
Harry didn’t want to open his eyes, he was scared that last night had just been a dream, but he could still feel the two bodies pressed against him and the stickiness all over him. Harry began to stretch as he began to wake up. All of a sudden it hit him that he really had sex with Tom and Draco, his mind began to go a mile a minute. His stretching seemed to have woken the other two as the arms around him tightened. “Good morning love.” Draco smiled behind Harry.
Neville smiled "It's clear that Tom and Draco have a thing for you it's entertaining watching them fight for the one who gets you plus Tom gets me to tell him these things."
He handed his plan to Hermione who started reading immediately, a small smile appeared as she read. "I think this could actually work, unlike some of the other plans you've created."
"I should kill you where you sit!"
She then gave Harry an odd glance.
"Have you enjoyed your stay here Harry."
'He wanted to talk to me about me befriending the Slytherins.'
Harry tried to give her the most innocent look he could without laughing "I have no idea what you’re talking about, I was effected to, I had to run down here because my dorm had the most disgusting smell and everything around me was changing into things, I witnessed Ron's underwear turning into spiders, and believe me it wasn't a pretty site!"
Harry gestured to his essay "Draco usually helps me but he is off telling people about the Quidditch practice."
**********************************************************************************
Draco grinned "I know!"
"Um... Harry, Granger is outside waiting for you."
"You know the night you missed dinner at the manor then Sirius came back?"
*****
"Harry you will be fine" Draco smiled at Harry “Honestly I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be brave"
Tom looked at the time. “Harry we are going to be late if we don’t get going.”
**********************************************************************************
"Don't lie to me Harry and I can't help but wonder if it's because of the incident with Draco?"
Draco smirked "Looks like I'll just have to keep trying harder to win your heart only for me."
Harry blushed and looked away while Tom laughed, truth be told Harry had completely forgotten about their kiss since Sirius, he still wasn't sure what to think of it, so he chose to ignore it once more as out of Draco's wand came out a phoenix Harry smiled and pet its beak. “A phoenix huh? that's pretty cool."
Hermione pulled him by his collar "Stop it right now, or I swear to Merlin-"
Harry scowled at Tom "I could wipe the floor with Voldemort if I wanted to Tom, I fought him plenty of times...I'm still alive!"
Draco’s arms tightened around Harry as he spoke. “We had plenty of time to talk when I was unconscious. It started off with us arguing over who was best for you but we soon actually began talking to each other.”
Draco had his mouth open wide as he stared at Harry’s godfather in shock. Harry pushed Draco’s mouth closed and muttered “Flies.” And turned to his godfather. “How did you know?” There was no point denying it if the other already knew.
“Being stabbed by a Muggle or witch or wizard, is the same thing, let me do the same to you and see how you fare?”
“Maybe Pomfrey missed one of the hexes put on you?”
“But Harry this is your family, we are going to have children and get married." Ginny demanded.
Harry opened his eyes “How did you know?" he knew that voice from somewhere but because of there being no light in the room he couldn't see the face of which it belonged to. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Harry grinned "You’re the best Mione"
Tom looked shocked “Harry it isn't safe for you there now."
Harry raised his hand to stop Tom "Don't... I'll guess I will see you at dinner, I made dessert so don't be late." Harry ran from the room before another word could be said. For the first time in his life Tom stood there in shock, he had no idea what had gone wrong, it bothered him greatly.
Sirius was now hugging Hermione "Thanks for looking out for my cub, Mione... I'm glad he has a friend like you!"
Harry gave her an annoyed look "As if I could rest without knowing where I was, I thought the order was trying to make me fight for them again" Hermione started to shove him back into the room
Harry tilted his head to the side “What is it?"
Harry couldn't believe it he had been backed into a corner by none other then Tom Riddle himself, Harry had been running away from Draco when Tom appeared and apparently Tom wasn't letting Harry escape easily... Or at all for that matter.
“Can I please have your attention for five minutes?”
Tom chuckled "Someone's cocky."
“Thanks Hermione.” Draco smiled. “You didn’t have to do that, Tom hasn’t let miss anything while I was asleep.”
Harry glared at her “Hey! I resent that, but this one I added my Slytherin side."
Harry sat up slowly every part of his body ached as if he had been hit by a train and brought back to life. He pulled up his shirt to check his wound, to find he now had a fresh scar. Harry sighed that's just what he needed another freaking scar. He swung his legs around to the side of the bed, slowing standing, and placing one foot in front of the other in a sloth like motion. Finally reaching the door he twisted the handle. In front of him was a long hallway filled with rooms. As he was about to step out from the room he was in the one opposite him opened in a rushed movement. He braced himself to be attacked as much as he could without his wand. However the person who appeared in front of him had long bushy brown hair.
Hermione scowled “Harry as the Tom's adviser I can't be seen like this"
"He properly fancies you" Hermione gave him a shocked look but soon recovered and she gave him a smile.
Tom smiled at Harry who couldn't shake the feeling about how weird it was to see he dark lord smiling Draco seemed to think so too as his mouth was wide open. “Careful drake, you'll catch flies"
Harry placed a hand on Tom’s cheek. “I understand, it’s kind of how I felt when I found out that you have been helping Draco all this time and I couldn’t do anything.”
"Merlin's beard, even though I have tried to deny it in the past, I thought the whole school knew this fact."
Lucius looked shocked for a second but replied "I'm doing research on the veil"
"Harry, will you please go to Hogsmeade with me, this weekend?"
“Mission Complete.” The look of confusion on both Tom and Draco set him off into another fit of laughter.
Harry then hugged his best friend with a laugh “I’m here if you need me Drake" Draco leaned into the hug “I’m fine, just didn't get much sleep.”
Harry grinned "Him and moony are catching up on lost time right now so I would say fine ...didn't want to Interrupt again, so I came to see you guys."
Harry rolled his eyes but chose to ignore her, instead he addressed the room as a whole in his teacher's voice he had found the year before. "Look, we have had our issues in the past, but if you are not going to get over it and take these lessons seriously, What was the point in coming. I have been asked to teach you, if you choose to be petty and not take your lord's orders to heart, you might as well leave now and face his wrath because I will be reporting to him. We are on the same side now like it or not, you can take it up with Voldemort himself if you think you will survive the encounter, I'm not here to waste time. Now form a line, let's see if anyone can best me in a duel."
Harry nodded “I’d like that."
Draco laughed "Okay I'll feed you."
Draco’s mouth soon surrounding Harry as he began to suck. Harry’s hands moved down to tangle in the blonde’s hair as he moaned loudly.
Draco had given him a grateful smile before saying his goodbyes. Once Harry was alone, he let out a sigh of relief. He tried to concentrate on the link between him and the Dark Lord but soon realized he had no idea how to do it. The only times he had activated the link was when he was asleep and it was more him seeing into voldemort's mind then communicating with him, was the technique like occlumency? Harry decided he would have to pay a visit to Snape and ask and let him know the first lesson had gone well. He also wanted to ask the man if there were any more books of instinctual magic, Harry could see the advantages of mastering the technique.
Draco took Harry's mind off Sirius as the grabbed some chocolate slice and ate it. They laughed at Ron's torture. Draco was mid-sentence when Harry pokes his finger in the icing and wiped it off on Draco's nose it was so random they were both in shock... Draco stared at him in horror before placing his whole hand in the icing a smudging it over Harry's face. Soon the two were having an icing war. It only ending when Draco freaked about having it in his hear and not his mouth. They were in a fit of laughter as they looked at each other’s chocolate covered selves. Draco had chocolate streaks in his hair, half his face was covered not to mention his clothes. Harry hair was in spikes thanks to the chocolate, and his face was completely covered, lucky for him none of it made it on his clothes apart from on his collar.
“I think it’s cute.”  Draco placed a small kiss to Harry’s forehead.
“I’m going to be gentle since it’s your first time, but I can’t say I will always control my self” Tom spoke with a smirk.
Harry rolled his eyes while Dumbledore wasn't looking, Tom's blood was boiling at Dumbledore's words, he wanted to kill the man right then and there but contained himself as he knew Harry wanted to be the one to get revenge on the old man.
'Ah yes one would think you would have been able to keep the secret longer.'
Tom then left Harry to his own crazy thoughts. Harry completely missed it when Tom whispered "Help me win".
Soon enough Hermione was jumping for joy "I can't wait to start classes!"
Harry spent the next few hours with his friends, him and Hermione still hadn’t spoken about their argument, with so much going on it had taken a back seat but both knew that they would need to talk eventually.
Harry then kicked them out so he could start.
Draco scoffed "Only the most legendary pranksters to walk these halls, no one knows who they are only that they attended Hogwarts 1971-1978 and that they were Gryffindor’s!”
"Okay so who is Wormtail?" Pansy asked
Harry couldn't help but chuckle acting braver then he felt, his eyes never left the two men, wary of every move they made "Well you did faint but I am afraid that image will forever be stuck in both of you brains, unless these fine gentlemen do us a favour and obliviate the last twenty minutes."
"I swear to god Draco Malfoy if you sigh one more time, I'll curse your hair permanently pink!" Draco's hand immediately went to his hair, covering it protectively, Hermione smirked widely. "Whoops might have done it already."
If Harry had still been drinking his potions he would have spat it out. “I’m not gay, so I don't care about what guys look like, your appearance is just a shock like I said"
Harry gave her an annoyed look "As if I could rest without knowing where I was, I thought the order was trying to make me fight for them again" Hermione started to shove him back into the room
Harry rolled his eyes "Whatever, what about you then? Do you have your eyes set on anyone else besides Victor the asshole?" He growled out the last part.
"You cook but suck at potions, how does that work?" Tom chuckled.
Tom smirked as he caught the invisibility cloak as Harry threw it at him. “Im in!”
"I'm just a concerned friend, Harry's had a rough couple of days" Draco blushed. "He still blames himself for Sirius's death."
Harry walked over to Tom and gave him a hug. "I can never express how thankful I am for you, bringing Sirius back...it means so much to have him back in my life."
Draco looked up at Harry now "What is it then?"
Harry rolled his eyes, scanning the group for any help, Theo shook his head "You could have warned us mate."
"So Harry how did you do on the potions essay Snape assigned?"
Hermione scowled "You know I hate surprises!"
Harry met with an angry Draco, “You left with without me, then you transfer the weasel here and I have to put up with his yelling"
Harry nodded and Draco smiled at him "Don't get me wrong it totally sucks, but I can't control the fact that you are falling for two people, I just have to try harder."
Harry waited for Luna to have her quill and parchment out as well before saying a word. “I’m here to tell the truth, because it’s about time I told it and everyone deserves to hear it.”
“We are willing to try this out if you are.” Draco said as he gestured to the three of them.
Hermione looked thoughtful for a moment. "The idea itself has merit but it seems way too dangerous, they could turn on you any moment it doesn't make sense for Dumbledore to tell you to do this."
"Potters a kitchen bitch, who would have thought?" Draco's sneering voice made Hermione growl.
Tom and Hermione laughed at Harry who shoved his face full of bacon in a Ron like manor to avoid talking. Tom got his attention by throwing a bread roll at him. It hit him right in the shoulder.
Draco groaned "Pansy what must I do to get you to stop calling me that?"
"That was because I hated you and I wanted to be better then you."
It was now Saturday and he was headed down to Hogsmeade, he had promised to meet with Draco and Tom later, he was on his way to meet Luna at the Three Broomsticks, he was going to give her and Rita Skeeter an insight to his life and Dumbledore’s manipulations so by the time the trial came along Dumbledore would hold no power with anyone, Lucius had even told Harry that if all went well, Dumbledore would soon be out of the headmasters position.
“I kept you from going insane.”
Harry raised his eyebrows “It’s true Harry, Voldemort is so intelligent he is such a gentleman... He has been treating me like I'm royalty" Harry laughed at the thought of Voldemort snake like kissing her hand and having dinner having arguments about a book.
**********************************************************************************
"They call me the brightest witch of my age for a reason Harry... So what happened?" She wiggled her eyebrows at him.
Harry looked as his feet "I know I should but the feelings I have for them are so real and different in every way and each day I find myself falling for them a little but more and I don't want to hurt anyone by choosing, and I'm scared the person being hurt will be me."
Draco
I went to the Ministry, as I told you, and I found him in his office. Messy hair, hands moving piles and piles of files. The strong muscles of the arms showing under the sweater.
He opened the door of Hermione's room, forcing himself not to crash into the wall. The girl was wearing a very questionable pink pajamas with teddy bears and was reading a book. Crookshanks stretched on the blankets before going back to sleep.
"Harry" whispered the former Slytherin, throwing himself into his arms. He curled up against his chest, pushing his face into the hollow between his neck and shoulder. He trembled like a leaf shaken by the autumn wind.
He ordered three Aurors to accompany him and then disappeared. He reappeared shortly after in front of the wrought iron gate. The whole neighborhood seemed to be immersed in an unreal tranquility, interspersed only by the incessant roar of the rain.
Harry got up and opened the windows, feeling the chill evening air hitting his bare chest.
Potter took a sip of beer, silently evaluating his words. He rubbed his jaw covered by a shadow of a dark beard. For a moment Draco was overwhelmed by the thought of Potter's scent, the way he used his fingers and mouth… he wanted to savor every second of their fuck. Instead he had only shreds of memories ...
"Why did you attack me?" he asked, giving him back the use of the word.
"There's one thing you don't know ..." he whispered, running his hands along Malfoy's legs, pressing with his palms until he reached his hips. Malfoy wriggled beneath him, his cheeks just blushing as Potter's fingers slid down his buttocks.
"How do you know I went to the stadium?"
"Your jeans are normal" Harry reflected darkly "what are my jeans different than yours?"
"You forgot your scarf," Malfoy chirped, pulling off the one he was wearing. It was deep green, reminiscent of Hogwarts meadows in midsummer and ...
“It wasn't obvious at all! For sure not to me! It is absurd!" he said aloud. "Me and Malfoy ..."
Then he tied it to his owl's paw and opened the window. He slumped to the ground, elbows resting on knees, head bowed forward. He didn't move when he heard footsteps climbing the stairs and then someone stop in front of him. A pair of elegant shoes, long legs. Malfoy grabbed him by the arms and pulled him back to his feet.
"Why did you say yes?" asked the young witch, dipping the spoon into the bowl and starting to martyr the cereals. The table was cluttered with piles of books, which left a few free zones where they could place plates and glasses.
"Really. There's nothing to worry about, "Harry declared as Kreacher opened the window and an owl landed on the table. Harry untied the note, recognizing Draco's handwriting.
"The water is hot," Malfoy replied, his hands on Harry's waist. “Take off your pants too. I'll leave you some privacy "he said as he went out into the corridor.
Draco wanted so much to say yes, but he just turned his head to the side. He felt his cock hard and ready to be sucked, trapped by the fabric of his pants. He moved, trying to ignore his erection as Potter's hands resumed massaging his legs.
The scarf. The one Draco had given him. He hadn't given it back yet.
Weasley made a disgusted face. "I hate romantic things"
"The hospital is surrounded by reporters," Weasley said, entering the back door. "We can't even get out, they would see us"
On his desk he found a note with only a few words.
And Hermione. Harry turned to her. "I'm not gay," he said a second time, reaching out a little towards her.
“Sorry, Malfoy, I came on you,” he said, pulling up his pants. "Go take a shower, I'll leave you some clean clothes in the bathroom"
"... is crazy. I needed a boyfriend who could scare him. "
"Do you also want to go to bed now?" Malfoy replied in a pale attempt to unleash the mocking tone Harry knew well. He just squeezed his shoulder, guiding him onto the mattress and under the covers. Harry tucked up the duvet, pausing beside him for a moment. "Try to sleep"
He was straight. And he had fucked Draco Malfoy.
It was a good thing. Nobody deserved to be at the mercy of the Dementors day after day after...
"And is there this possibility?" Harry asked, hoping to sound more confident than he was.
Who looked at him with wide eyes and pressed against him seeking protection from his ugly and bad ex-boyfriend...
I can do it, Santa Claus. I know I can do it.
"If for once, I did something that no one expects ... if for once ..."
"I tried," Harry interrupted, looking into his eyes "I tried not to write to you ... not to look for you ... But I can't get you out of my head."
"I'm going to take a shower," he announced.
I didn't say anything more and walked away.
He took off his jeans, then placed them on the back of the chair. The room was warm and welcoming, in contrast to the cold that raged in the streets. The weather forecast had announced snow for the following days.
"The least you can do is bring me down," Harry said lightly, hoping to break the tension. Draco snapped his arm around his waist, squeezing it slightly. Harry stiffened, grabbing Malfoy's arms. Their crampons rattled against each other with a metallic clang.
"It's been three minutes past midnight," he whispered.
He still couldn't figure out if he was sorry about it or not.
Hermione had to understand the broken sentences because she stroked his hair softly. “Okay, Harry. We take you home "
Merlin, why was his life so crowded with psychopaths?
"Yes," he replied, shrugging.
"You ... what did you do?" he whispered as Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him roughly against him.
Lips posed in an indecent smile.
Harry would have prevented Mrs. Weasley from continuing to pin his initials on her underwear.
Harry's eyebrow rose "Tom reads magazines?"
Dumbledore was giving Harry a piercing look while he waited for an answer. "It's different, the common room is a bit cooler and they really are obsessed with the colour green but apart from that it's fine better then Gryffindor even, the Slytherin's don't hate me and treat me well, the reason I haven't been showing up for meals is because I have been studying hard...don’t worry sir I grab food from the kitchens when I'm hungry."
Harry walked into Tom's study, he didn't bother to knock, luckily the man was on his own or else Harry would have been punished for since an intrusion, just so they wouldn’t get any ideas.
"Okay so you didn't join the Slytherin team as seeker, always gaining my attention by insulting me or my friends, always getting me in trouble and no one else, join Umbitches club so you could follow me everywhere?"
Harry slapped Draco on the back of the head "I cook for you and this is the thanks I get?"
Harry smiled "Yup Fred and George agreed to help."
The hat shouted out to the hall "Slytherin!"
**********************************************************************************
Harry laughed “Drakey poo?"
"Neville we need to talk!" Harry said as he dragged Neville away from the rest of the group.
Drake nodded "Yup and he knows it." They both smiled brightly up at the professor who grinned at in return "Ah I see" and she then returned to the staff table and engaged in a conversation with Professor Flitwick, no doubt telling him all about her interaction with Harry and Draco.
"Merlin Harry, I want you to cook for me for the rest of my life!" Draco gave Harry a genuine smile, Harry couldn't help but think about the saying a way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. It seemed Harry had won Draco's friendship with one simple meal.
Harry had laughed. Draco had also taken Harry and Hermione shopping and brought them proper wizard attire as he put it. Harry had even managed to convince him to let them buy a few pairs of muggle clothes as well; even Draco had brought some for himself.
He then walked away without another glance at Harry but even without looking at his face he knew Tom was upset.
Harry raised his eyebrow “Aww is the big bad dark lord, scared of a teenagers mood swings."
"That's it, they removed the spell, its fine, I need you to be okay Potter, who else will remove my memories from tonight."
Harry jaw dropped "you wouldn't dare!”
Harry try to hide the blush "What are you talking about?"
Hermione smirked “Never mind."
Harry smirked, "I didn't know there was more than one creature with the same name?"
Tom reached for Harry's hand, pulling it towards him, causing a line to go through the parchment because he was currently in the middle of writing a sentence.
Before he left he turned back to face her " I can't keep watching you get hurt Hermione, I just can't, you’re a strong beautiful independent woman which clearly Victor can’t see, he isn’t the only one out there. I know this, you deserve better and I wish you did too." He then left her with tears strolling down her face, no matter how guilty he felt for it, he didn't turn back...it was something he had to do.
"I don't want your faggot germs anywhere near my son, you have already corrupted two of my babies!" Molly smirked as if she had something on Harry.
Tom then left Harry to his own crazy thoughts. Harry completely missed it when Tom whispered "Help me win".
Tom interrupted before Harry could say anything. "The meal was marvellous I cannot wait until the next meal you create."
Harry nodded. "Can I trust you, when you say you no longer want me dead?"
Draco nodded. “Yeah it seems he was just as worried as you.” Draco shrugged. “Though it might have been his was worried that this might set you back… which it seems it did, Harry this wasn’t your fault.”
"Sorry it was not my intention to ruin your homework." With a quick wave of his hand the line soaked into the parchment and disappeared."
“I’m not cute!” Harry protested.
Tom glared "Teenagers!”
Voldemort chuckled. “They hated Harry Potter the chosen one of the light side, now that you are on the same side you might find that you will make some allies in Slytherin or friends as you like to call them, besides if any should give you trouble they will be defying a direct order from myself and will be punished.”
"You don't remember me? That hurts Harry." He could hear the sarcasm in the man’s voice. “We see each other about once a year, come on your memory can't be that bad, Hermione said she told you where you were."
Hermione had squealed like a fangirl and had immediately asked for details even though Tom was her boss and refused to listen to their denials. Neville however had simply said. “Does that mean you picked Tom?” Harry groaned and head butted the table. “I didn’t have sex with Tom, how many times do I have to tell you guys!?” It took Harry and Tom to convince the others that they had not had sex, this had left everyone disappointed. As it turns out they were betting on who Harry would lose his virginity to Tom or Draco.  They thought that the bet was finally over just to find out that Harry had literally slept together was disappointing.
"I don't completely trust them, I'm not an idiot, Dumbledore has asked me to try and sway them to join our side of things, right now they probably see this as a way to get me to Voldemort but if I can sway them things could be different."
Harry chuckled, "Destined to kill you remember?"
“I’m sorry.” Harry muttered into their chests.
'Indeed.' Was the reply.
Harry rolled his eyes "If you’re so concerned about my safety come with us I don't care but I have to do this."
Sirius beamed "Moony, god I can't wait to see him!"
Neville laughed "because you’re Harry freaking Potter that's why!"
Harry shook his head with a huge grin on his face. “Still believe that do you?"
Dumbledore's face was priceless he had a face mixed with both shock and anger, Tom was laughing behind his hand silently.
Harry’s eyes widened. “Uh…..?”
“I knew you were going to come back so I waited, oh Harry this isn't your fault! Draco won’t blame you, none of us blame you"
Once Harry was dressed, she combed his hair before running her hand through it. He gave her a questioning look she responded. "It gives you the I just got shagged look."
Harry blushed as he realised what Draco was asking but said the words anyway.
Harry smiled despite himself "Yeah I have heard that one before."
Hermione gave him a disapproving look “Harry James Potter, you have to tell him, so help me I'll tell him myself!"
“Madam Pomfrey, its Draco come quick!” Harry shouted with excitement.
When Harry woke up Draco was already gone, he removed the green sheets which had wrapped around him. He slowly opened the door, just enough to peek through, and no one was there... He didn't want anyone to see him sneaking away from Draco's quarters, they would think something of it when there wasn't anything to think about. He ran down the hall to his room where shut the door quickly behind him.
"You godfather was Sirius Black?” Harry nodded again wondering what was with all these questions. "He fell through the veil in the department of mysteries correct?"
Harry chuckled, "I just saw you in a very blackmail worthy position professor, and maybe it should be you showing me some respect."
Harry willed himself to lie to say anything but the truth but instead of any lie the truth came out. "4 Privet Drive, Surrey."
The man rolled his eyes. "You are a horcrux; if I kill you I destroy my soul."
"I don't see much of a difference, really." Tom smirked.
Rita hit Harry’s arm playfully. “Oh Harry you know business is business, why don’t I get us some butterbeer hmmm?”
Harry's jaw dropped “H-How?”
"Okay what the hell is going on, you just spent the entire time in potions laughing with Malfoy?" Hermione asked
"That isn't the point." Tom flicked his wand at the pile of journals and they disappeared before he left he turned to Harry "Be ready in fifteen, we all will floo straight into the old coots office its best not to keep the old fart waiting." Harry nodded he would give Sirius and Remus his cloak so they could sneak in through the honeydukes passage way.
"Got to go see you guys later."
"Funny I think Tom lives by a similar motto." Harry said with a groan.
Harry then ran off with a quick wave to Tom on his way out.
Tom shook his head. “Not what I meant. Look I have been so worried about you, these past few weeks you looked dreadful, and I understand that Draco waking up helped but it seemed with that he was the only one who could pull you out of your funk, even though he said exactly what everyone has been telling you for weeks.”
When Tom believed Harry was ready, he nodded toward Draco who moved closer to the two.
“You make the most wonderful noises, my little raven.” Tom spoke whilst on top of him.
Harry looked at his watch, Snape should still be in his office, it wasn't too long after curfew that the man would have gone to bed, but Harry did not know the man's habits and he hasn't brought the map, so he had to hope the man would still be in his office.
Harry rolled his eyes "You already know everything they are going to teach anyway."
Harry woke and he felt much better, he thought he could run a marathon if he was a faster runner. Hermione came to visit, when she was satisfied that he was well enough she gave Harry the tour of the manor. It was huge! There were over a thousand rooms, there were bedrooms, studies, libraries, some were empty some had random things placed inside them. Harry was mesmerised he had never been in a house this big before. Outside he had a Quidditch pitch, lake and a stables. The land could fit three of manors inside and still have plenty room for everything else. Harry wandered where Tom got all the money to afford this place but then he thought about how Tom was the dark lord and could do anything he wanted.
"Killing you is no longer part of the plan, I have no desire to kill you but that can be changed if you continue to vex me so." Tom snapped at Harry, his brown eyes flashing red and the tension in the air thickened with the anger rising from the Dark Lord. Harry stayed silent as he watched those in the room, they didn’t seem to be shocked by the dark lords statement at all.
Harry hugged Draco, "Thank you so much... It's wonderful."
Harry rolled his eyes. "There is a lot that Snape doesn’t know about me. Is there a way to remove your soul from me, without damaging it."
He was woken by an angry Ron, apparently the red haired teen had waited up for him to get back from detention and had fallen asleep on the armchair by the fire place, while he was annoyed Harry hadn’t noticed and woken him so he could have slept in his bed and not have the pain in his neck he currently had, he wasn’t angry at Harry, he was angry at Snape. His best friend was currently plotting revenge for keep Harry out so late and risking the teen getting another detention. Harry would just nod along with whatever Ron was saying, too tired to really pay attention and to busy thinking of the reason why Snape had kept him back so late. Could he really join Voldemort, become his spy, all for the sake of the people he cares about? This was his parent’s murderer, the reason he was tortured by the Dursley’s all these years, why his friends were in danger the first place. Then again he could take himself out of the fight entirely, leave his friends to make their own choices, he mentally shook his head, he couldn’t do that he wouldn’t be able to stand aside and let his friends get hurt. Or he could ignore the really weird talk and continue to fight against them, instead of joining them, they would hunt him down but that wouldn’t make a difference to the situation he was currently in. Harry sighed he didn’t want to be a part of the war, he was tired of fighting, he wanted a normal life, besides why should he fight for the people who shun him, who expect him to have all the answers and fight against a man who had more knowledge then he could ever dream of and he was only sixteen. Even Dumbledore expected him to be the one to defeat Voldemort because of the prophecy and the so call power he was supposed to know. Despite knowing firsthand the professor Trelawney can predict a true prophecy, who says that all prophecy’s come true or that she didn’t make it up to get the job, and just by pure chance it kind of happened, it was only because Voldemort knew of the first half and acted upon it that the first part was even true. Harry certainly didn’t have any special abilities that Voldemort wasn’t aware of, he could literally see inside his mind, pretty hard to keep anything a secret that way. If he had a special power then not even Harry himself was aware of it. All that aside, even if he could stomach joining the dark side, how would he convince his friends to stop fighting the very thing that threatened their way of life? Harry banged his head on the table at breakfast, it didn’t matter what he did Harry potter felt entirely screwed.
Draco grabbed a tissue from his pocket and wiped the tears away from Harry's face. “For now I know the best thing to cheer you up."
"Harry M'boy please come sit."
But this was not why Harry was alone with his thoughts. No it was because Ron and Ginny had ambushed Draco in a dark corridor while he was alone, just because they knew it would hurt Harry, plus they hated the blonde boy. Because of them Draco was in the hospital wing and hadn't woke up yet, he had long since been forced away from Draco's side by Madam Pomfrey, he was waiting for the matron to fall asleep so he could sneak back in. Despite what everyone told him, he blamed himself and hadn't spoken a word to anyone since he heard about Draco's attack. Harry thanked Merlin that Pansy had headed down that corridor and spotted the two Weasley's mid-torture and was able to overpower them and bring him to the Hospital Wing.
“Ready Harry?” Tom asked.
Harry sat down on an armchair beside a fireplace "Yeah they both fancy me and it's getting bloody annoying, just this morning Tom hired a choir to sing for me at breakfast, in front of everyone it was really embarrassing!"
Harry knew he would have to explain eventually, the deal was his friends would not fight in the war. Maybe if he could get them all to get along first he could sway his friends
“Only that?” Draco smiled at him, clutching on his bag and waiting for some other answer “We can still hang out if you want to, we’re friends, right?”
“It’s not that simple, if I tell you to come to Harry, would you?” He said, and Draco shut his mouth. It was true, if anyone tell him to talk to Harry right now, he will just deny it right away. Of course he has feelings for Harry, but he just wasn’t
a tease, do you know that?” Harry chuckled behind him and stepped forward, he could feel Harry’s hard cock pressing between his arse
“Well…” He stuttered, finding it hard to argue with Pansy, she and Hermione were just always right “I still don’t need this party, a small gathering is fine”
“Yeah you are” Ron scoffed loudly, passing by other Aurors as they greeted them “You’re getting worse each day, Harry”
“Okay, well I gotta find a few more books, wanna come?” She asked but he politely shook his head, he already got enough books on his side now. She left quickly and he moved to the spot next to Weasley
“It took like two days” Theodore added as Draco heard him being smacked by Pansy “
“Thanks, Ron” He picked a few and put it in his mouth. He was thankful to be friends with good people like them, he would be brave…for them, for himself.
wrong, he’s—…”
” He murmured every time Harry shoved in,
Draco struggled to get out of Harry’s grip, but it was too tight. The Auror pulled him in the restroom and finally let him go
“Why are you smiling?” Harry asked, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. The blond sighed happily, intertwining their hands together and met his eyes
Which star are you going to reach for, Harry?”
He gaped at her, he didn’t know that she knew about it. He turned to look at Harry, who was beaming at him and the newfound the secret “It’s not that big of a deal, Harry”
“What’s wrong?”
“But I am
“I’d love to have a dinner date with you tomorrow night, Harry. I’ll wait for you” Draco smiled, his breath hitched when Harry wrapped his arms around the blond’s waist, pulling him close “Really? In front of all of our friends?”
“Harry knocked out Smith at our training the day after the first photoshoot” Ron added behind Draco “And McLaggen too”
“Don’t you dare”
“So, did Harry do all the work or did you contribute to it too?” Ginny asked, wiggling her eyebrows and pursed her lips “It is your first time after all”
” Pansy tilted the phone back to show her face and she glared at him, pointing her finger at the screen “You
“They are celebrating their two year anniversary, Pansy” Blaise added, handing Ron a piece of liquorice to chew on after he was done with his Acid Pop, Draco was still standing there
, why did Ron say you have feelings for me?”
” Pansy smirked, folding her arms and leaning on the wall “
“Sod off, Malfoy!” Potter glared at him and walked away along with Weasley and Granger. Draco smiled in victory that this time he won, another win for him
you two right now!”
“Your relationship with Harry isn’t like you and me, or you and Ron, it’s more complicated than that, to be honest, we did really hate each other at the time. I mean, you hated me and called me…names,
“Dean,
“I didn’t
“I want to see you” Neville mumbled and Theo chuckled before turning around again, his lips met Neville halfway, and when he was pushed back on the floor, Theo opened his eyes in confusion
“Yeah, and well, before I met you and we all became friends, they and I…we used to work together for like a year, I was in charge of the money and they were in charge of entertaining others…er, they used to be a stripper, they’re good at it, we used to get big money from rich, old men because they were so good at it, they even wanted to pay more to fuck them, but we never let it go that far”
?” Hermione squeaked softly and covered her mouth, she lowered her voice and continued “But
“Well what do you want from me?” Blaise finally snapped, stepping forward “I didn’t fuck anyone for months now, I want you, and not just to fuck you, I want to be
“No, I don’t wanna be in one of those blind dates again, it sucks” He complained, not that he has a high standard or anything, it just didn’t feel right with any of them, and especially if Pansy had a hand in matchmaking him “I’m just not in the mood for love right now”
” Hermione stood up and waved at them “
“So, it’s like what? Seven minutes until midnight?” Pansy looked around the room to search for the clock but turned back to look at Draco “You know what happens at midnight right?”
think it’s good, I might buy a few to give Ron” Potter smiled “Almost bought a beachcomber straw hat too”
” Draco turned around and glanced at Harry, who somehow still looked stunned “Good game there, you play really well”
“Why don’t you apologise to me?”
“I know you do” Pansy said
Pansy’s eyes slowly became scary as her eyebrows furrowed and lips twitched
“Hmm” Hermione hummed into the kiss and Theo slammed his hand on the table
don’t be stubborn” She cupped his face and sighed “Do you think Hermione and I never fight? Do you know how hard it was in our first few months together? Even in the first year of our relationship, we still fought, over even the stupidest things ever” Pansy pinched his cheek and smiled “But we worked on it, now we barely raise out voice to each other. Love doesn’t come that easily, you two will fight, but you will work on it, unless in some certain circumstances like infidelity, violence or stuff like that, then I can’t force you” She trailed her hands down his shoulders and held it tightly “But I know, you won’t give up that easy, I know, that a small part of you
Draco whined softly, like a tired cat, but then softened up after a few seconds “Okay, what’s wrong?”
“Blaise’s Manor has a really great view” The redhead said, tapping his hands on their shoulders as he whispered “So great I can actually see what people are doing even if they’re far away”
“What?”
“When did that happen?”
“Come in, Harry, have a seat next to Draco” Pansy pointed at the couch where he was sitting, and every step Potter took closer to him, Draco felt his heartbeat beating faster, he wasn’t sure why “I’ll just sit here with my Witch Weekly” Pansy sighed, grabbing a pile of Witch Weekly magazines from behind the chair and started reading next to Granger.
you love him” Hermione said, sitting down and wrapped her arm around his shoulder, like a sister “We do, but you can’t avoid him forever, he’ll be sad too”
“He has to” Pansy rolled her eyes, hand locking with Hermione “So, can we go in? Is it cutting the line? Where’s Ginny?”
“Boo hoo, anyway” Pansy leaned on Draco’s shoulder and sighed “Tonight, it will be a private candlelit dinner at the beach, then I will give her a silver heart locket necklace, I’ll have one too, it can be opened, and there will be the first initials of our names engraved in each other’s locket, you know, because she’s forever in my heart”
“You were going to propose?”
Ron squealed, putting the computer back on Harry’s lap, pointing his finger at the screen “I’ve made a file full of these types of videos and named it
Draco’s mouth fell open, and not from pleasure, from
his house is like
“What are you getting at, Ron?” He asked, he knew Ron has a point when he mentioned all of this, he has to.
“Oh, sorry” Pansy pulled away and sat up, fixing her jumpsuit “What’s up?”
And my forever? I hope” Potter said, handing the chocolate box for Draco to hold, he stood there, waiting patiently for Draco to answer
He murmured in his ear and Draco smacked him playfully, Harry chuckled and licked the spot under his ear, sucking on the skin there “
“Stop smoking” Pansy scowled at him but Blaise didn’t care, until now, no one could tell Blaise to quit smoking
Draco was startled when Theodore called them from behind, he looked at his friend with a soft smile as Pansy clapped for him
“No, I was…at a place” He said, reassuring her and thinking about how the other Draco knew that he needed to get to the Room of Requirement, he’s just incredibly intelligent “To think”
“I guess” Draco replied nonchalantly, he wasn’t sure they would even accept him, not with the mark on his arm, but he has hopes in Madam Pomfrey’s words “I haven’t thought about it much, I’m sure my parents would even dislike it, but I think I will try to be a good one”
“Okay”
of your
hate Harry?” Hermione asked him, and Draco asked himself too. Did he really
“Good” Narcissa smiled at him and pulled out a small box from behind her “Here’s something I prepared” He handed it to Harry and he opened to see a gold ring with green gemstone on it “It’s my wedding ring, it’s fine if you two want to have your own ring, you can use it as an engagement ring, if you want to”
? Draco looked up to see Potter chuckling with Weasley while Granger gave him a beam
” Ron whispered in his ear before running to his husband’s spot. The music has started and someone dimmed the light down, people started spreading out so there were space around him. This party kept getting crazier each second.
Rose slammed the kitchen door open and brought out two more dishes with her, this time Ron was bringing everyone else their food. As Rose settled the plates down on the table, Harry realised Draco has been blushing again, just a little bit “Let me just clean this”
we say these words” Ginny winked at them “Or else we could have just said what it really is, if you know what I mean”
“I know” Harry sighed, cupping his face and kissing his forehead, he loved when Harry kissed his face, he never seem to stop doing it “As long as you’re with me, I’ll be fine”
” Draco turned his head around at Harry’s question, furrowing his eyebrows at him “We
“There’s no seat left” Ron commented while sucking on an Acid Pop, which Blaise also bought for him “
“Oh no, this is not fighting, I find this extremely hot, might even do her tonight” Pansy explained, and Harry could hear Hermione quietly shushing her wife
He screamed out when he saw her inside the Common Room, just sitting silently on the couch, painting her nails with magic “
“For knowing a lot? Then why are you friends with Blaise and I? We can be know-it-all too” He pointed out, which made Pansy realised it as well. He smiled, he was getting into the right way now “Right? So go easy on her and the Gryffindor”
“Oh no” Draco elbowed him “Do not go with Smith, that’s so low, you have to hit rock bottom to go with him”
Draco whined, opening his legs intentionally for Harry to go deeper. Harry hollowed his cheeks, grazing his teeth teasingly while casting a wordless spell, and Draco seemed to know when his hands moved to open his arse wide apart. Since it was Draco’s first time, Harry didn’t want to hurt him, he pushed the first finger in slowly and stopped as soon as he heard Draco’s hiss
uncle Harry and uncle Draco”
” Draco murmured to himself, but as soon as Potter started walking, he started moving away as well. Draco quickly marched to Theo’s spot and stood next to him, he turned to his right to see Potter was talking to Colin Creevey now. So, he
“Shiny” He repeated “You have got to be kidding me” There was no way he’s going to put lotion on Harry and other eleven male’s bodies
“Okay but come on, Draco was able to jump on Harry like that, he’s pretty good” Ron added and the girls nodded in agreement “One time I tried doing that, Blaise and I almost fell into a fountain”
be” Theo said “Look at how you’re ogling at him, it’s like a kid watching sweets from outside of a shop, or me standing outside of a boutique” He chuckled and nudged Draco “Come on, where’s your dignity?”
“Sleep with me?” Draco smirked as Harry’s eyes twinkled “
“I’m not in a foul mood”
“So what happened? You two didn’t kiss?” Pansy’s face appeared in the green flames, she immediately Flooed him after they got home. Turned out Ginny did have some really bad hot dogs from the Muggle vendors, but the Healer gave her potions and guaranteed she’d be up and strong again by tomorrow
Lucius exclaimed loudly as soon as Harry finished his sentences, but Narcissa quickly silenced him with her hand raised. She looked at Harry, her eyes deep, Draco’s got his mother’s eyes, he felt as if he was being read from inside out
him?” He turned his phone back at his face and asked the girls “How could you not tell me…” He whispered quietly so that Harry couldn’t hear “
“What happened again?”
“Er, so…” She fiddled with her hands and looked down “I Polyjuiced into Harry”
” He finally answered “Don’t blame me because you were too pissed to even remember you did that to me”
“I thought he has his wand”
?” He stood on his tip toe and kissed Harry’s jawline as the man rubbed soap all over his arms, he trailed the kiss slowly from his chin and felt his stubbles, up to the spot behind his ear, the blond put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and licked his earlobe, earning a low groan from the man “Have you ever thought this would happen?”
Pansy said, trying to find ways to get Lucius and Narcissa out of the house, they cannot see Draco right now, for the obvious reason.
“Can you wake him up and lead him to his bed?” Granger asked him while Pansy stood there next to her with her eyes glued to him, she never said a thing but he knew what she was trying to tell him “He said he didn’t get any sleep last night and he has been so moody all day”
, and it wasn’t good. He quickly sipped on his wine and looked at the beach, he must forget about this.
“Do you remember the thing Luna said about multiple universes? Do you think she’s right?”
“I was going to say I’m surprised you’re bossy in bed” Harry grinned, crawling up and resting his arms on either side of Draco’s head “But honestly, I’m not”
“Weasley always forget his, I just don’t want to be waiting for him to transform his own book into a quill again” Blaise said, Draco gave him a little smile, knowing it actually did improve a bit now, he was fine to keep going.
“Who’s Brandon?” Ron looked puzzled when Rose replied to him, her hands swiping the tears off her eyes
He smiled when Draco froze completely, he saw the blond swallowing hard without saying a word
“It’s alright, you know” He said, licking Neville’s cock “I just fingered myself alr-
“Oh, apple juice is alright” Harry said, sitting down and taking off his leather jacket.
Pansy yelled “
“Well now I am” Harry blurted out, putting the napkin on the table, searching for a waiter “I’m a little tired today, can we go now?”
“I am, I mean every word I said to you, to everyone” He said, it felt nice to admit to this. He clutched tightly on his books and looked at her
Draco pushed back until he could feel Harry’s cock poking at his arse “
“Don’t blame yourself” Harry said, still looking down at Draco, making the blond blushed. Luckily it was dark, the officer wouldn’t be able to see it “Do you want a ride home?”
“I’m just looking at these love marks I gave you and I think” He said, whispering to Draco “
“You did that?” Harry opened his eyes wide, Draco liked him? Draco wore short robes to flirt with him? And he didn’t even notice? “To…to seduce me?”
“Fuck, I can’t open my eyes” Potter mumbled
“Look at your gaping hole, still twitching” Harry bent down and curled his fingers inside Draco slowly, making his back arched “I’m just making sure it’s all inside of you” He kissed Draco’s face, from his forehead, to his eyebrows, down to his cheeks and lips “I want it all in you”
“Not too much makeup, they’re Aurors, not models, I know”
” Harry breathed out when Draco hollowed his cheeks, his hand stroking the base “He, he just went to the restroom”
Hermione tapped in code on Pansy’s back again as both of them watched Harry’s thoughts run around in his messy head of his. His eyebrows furrowed just so slightly, his lips pressed into a thin line and his hand was grabbing on the beer bottle a little too tight, he must have imagining Draco kissing Cormac right now, just according to plan.
“Er, this is for you” Potter handed him a small bag “It’s nothing much”
going in”
“Really?”
at your birthday party, but well, make sure you look exactly the same as before. For example, Draco, did you fall on Harry’s lips or you just got bitten by a huge mosquito?” She pointed not so subtly and Draco quickly covered his neck, he didn’t even know Harry made marks on him that fast. He grinned guiltily as the girls continued talking about something else that he couldn’t focus on. This day was better than he ever expected, he’d never think that the day he was sure was the worst day of his life turned out to be the best day of his life, that he’d lost and find love again in one day, that he’d be able to find his true love back then. Looking up at Harry again, Draco thought the last fifteen years with him was the best years he has ever experienced, and he couldn’t wait to spend next fifteen years,
“Well, I cancelled it, I have more meetings with Granger, since we’re also helping with the graduation ceremony” Pansy said, looking at the wall as both him and Theodore smirked at her “What?”
still rough like always?” Draco gasped when Harry ripped the fishnet tights apart. Harry stared at the lace underwear and tried to find ways to breathe properly “If you’re wondering, it’s a black lace thong, except the skirt from Pansy, everything else is mine” Harry exhaled deeply and hooked his finger under the thong, this barely covered anything, Draco’s cock was even threatening to break free from it. Harry pulled Draco down and pushed the string of the thong to the side before squeezing his arse apart, he murmured a few spells and started licking at Draco’s rim
?” Draco asked and then they both turned right at the corner the guy just came from. Draco was shocked to see a normal-looking redhead guy and a blond girl running to them.
Blaise?” Draco rolled his eyes and finally turning to look up at Harry “I know you’re lying. Tell me the truth, Harry. Why was the file full of pornography named after me?
“What?”
He never know what the consequences would be if he got too pissed
“Shush” Draco nudged her and looked back at the stage, he heard Potter’s soft snore and silently hoped he didn’t hear any of that
and of course they had makeup sex after that. Their wedding happened a month after, it wasn’t big, it was just friends and family, but Pansy still managed to make it fancy and beautiful when she had only one month to plan. Molly and Draco’s parents have thought their decision to get married only after ten months of being together was too quick, but they both didn’t agree, because he was certain Draco was the one for him, and he just couldn’t wait any longer, Harry just wanted to put a ring on him and build a family with him. Going to sleep and waking up every day with Draco by his side, fighting and making up with him, kissing him and cuddling him, fucking him in every way possible, all of it didn’t even seem real, like he was still dreaming. Every time he looked in Draco’s eyes, Harry knew he’d never be able to stop loving him, and he knew, for him, Draco was a dream that came true.
“Draco, you need to promise me, promise
Pansy and Hermione shrieked together, Draco gasped, pointing at Ron and Blaise
That’s like the fifth time now”
and we are sorry but we love you and we want you to be with Harry and today the thing Hermione was talking about Harry is that he thought you don’t like him because you kept flinching every time he tried to talk or because you literally ran away when he was giving you a massage, therefore he’s considering of giving this stupid little crush up, so for
” Harry sighed, looking at the small kid standing between her moms “I didn’t even know”
with Draco, the clueless guy, he didn’t know a thing.
“I’ve kept enough every time” Draco said with a smirk and Harry pulled his finger out, waving his hand and cleaning them both up. He helped Draco up in a sitting position and caressing his cheek, he touched Draco’s neck gently and suddenly smiled “Why are you smiling?”
Harry said, kneeling behind him and pushed two fingers in the blond’s loosen hole, his other hand slipping under the sweater to pinch Draco’s nipple, teasing him until it became hard, Draco couldn’t control his own body as he kept pushing back, yearning for more
Draco stopped in his tracks and walked slower to hear Ron rambling to Harry from behind “
“Don’t give up on me” He stood there, cupping Potter’s face and mumbled “Pansy said you were going to give up on me. Don’t”
complaining at the same time, Ron” Pansy rubbed her temples and chuckled “It was exhausting, I can’t even express—er, did someone just knock?”
“I do too” Draco pulled Harry’s face back up so they could see each other again, their noses touched and Draco smiled at him “I love you, Harry” And he would be lying if he said he wasn’t more aroused by Draco saying he loved him, Harry buried his face in the crook of the blond’s neck, smelling his coconut scented hair and slammed in hard, each thrust only made Draco moaned louder
“I don’t care” Harry said as Draco glanced around, some were looking at them, and he could even see his friends standing at the end of the hallway “I just want to kiss you and make you mine”
“I know” Draco said softly and wrapped his hand around the Auror’s neck, their foreheads touching “Just so you know, when that Auror calendar comes out, I want a copy of that on my bedside table”
“Er” Harry stuttered. Was Draco jealous?
knows” Harry chuckled, it was all too easy for them to find out, apparently the way Harry looked at Draco was
“Er, yeah” Harry nodded as he walked around Draco and made his way into the bathroom, heaving like crazy once he closed the door, that was extremely dangerous. Draco looked way too hot even when he just came out of the shower. Harry took off his clothes and got under the shower head, turning the water on, he closed his eyes and it was like Draco was in here with him. The scent of his shampoo and body wash filled the room and Harry’s nostrils, the Auror took a deep breath and opened his eyes, looking down at the thing that was betraying him right now “Really?” He stared at the half hard cock and cursed at himself, this could not be happening. Harry switched the tap to cold water and decided to get a cold shower in December, because that was apparently the
“Sod off, Harry” Ron grumbled as Draco stood up, grabbing his drink with him, he needed to flee
“Does it hurt?”
” Potter grabbed Draco by the chin and stopped the blond from sucking him off, he looked up at Potter and saw his chest heaving, his mouth opened “I really don’t want to come right now” He picked Draco up and pulled him in a kiss, he grabbed the blond’s legs and lifted him up, Draco wrapped his legs around Potter’s waist and hugged him tightly, never breaking off the kiss, Potter started walking for a few steps before sinking down on his knees, he laid Draco down gently on the soft carpet, he really
“He said he wasn’t sure how it happened, or when” Hermione began “Remember when you two were assigned that case and it went on for six months? It’s just a year from now”
“Another time” Ron grabbed his hand and shook it, the blond kept his eyes on Ron and didn’t dare look the other way. Because Harry got in the Common Room during their third match and he’s been sitting there, staring at the both of them since then “Do you know, er, Zabini is into photography?” Ron asked all of a sudden, surprising Draco, since Blaise never shared much, he didn’t know, but he could understand where it came from. Blaise did tell him and Pansy and Theo that he received a camera when he was a kid by his mother, but one of his stepfather destroyed it.
I became the Minister for Magic” Hermione chuckled “To manipulate people”
“Did Pansy bring you here?”
Draco mumbled, standing on his tiptoes to connect their lips. It was just a their lips pressed against each other, but then Potter began moving his lips, sucking on Draco’s bottom lip, earning a satisfying hum from the blond, the Auror definitely know how to kiss. Draco opened his mouth just slightly, giving Potter enough access to slip his tongue in, and the moment he did it, he realised he should have been kissing Potter instead of pining on him, because he felt more than just physical heat, more than just burning skins touching one another. His emotions were high like they were on Muggle rollercoasters, he has never felt this feelings before, and he wasn’t sure whether it was because he was a virgin, or it was because of Potter, maybe both, it just felt right.
this is hard for you, it’s hard for all of us. But it’s been three months, Draco”
“Excuse me?”
” Draco opened his eyes when he felt someone grabbed him by the wrist, it was Harry. Draco intended to push him away but the git was too strong, he just started pulling Draco away from McLaggen “
“Well,
” Theo glared at Pansy when she gave him a wink, Ginny pursed her lips and sighed, rubbing her temples “He can stay there, it even has a television in there”
Harry shook his head "I believe it was your son who bumped me not the other way around."
Harry was impressed. He took notes after each duel, both so he could have a rest and so he could catalogue where the slytherins strengths and weaknesses were. They were very good and offensive magic but their defences were abysmal, it was as if once they learned the shielding charm they thought that was all they would need.
"Always the model student!" Pansy chuckled.
Hermione shook her head "he's right Harry."
He had begun to get along with some of the other sixth year Slytherins. He paired with Draco a couple of times during potions earning points from Slughorn for house unity. He had been seen walking to charms with Blaise and passing notes to Pansy during class.
They were still laughing when Hermione walked in, she stood there shocked before giggling at their appearance. “Is it a thing now, chocolate facials?"
“I can't believe I raised you" Arthur look as if he were going to be sick.
They stayed there for hours if there was something he didn't quite understand, Hermione would explain it. So far he mastered spells he hadn't heard of. He even taught Hermione how to do the patronus considering it was the one spell she had trouble with she could now produce a full shield, it would take time for her to reach a corporal patronus. Harry shared some pastries he had made earlier, Hermione once again told him that he should open his own restaurant. "I'm not that good."
Harry was shocked that it had been that easy to get the information since he has been asking her all week, Harry just gave her a grin. "Mione that's great, Charlie is a great guy."
"Harry what's wrong?" Draco had sensed that the mood in the room had changed.
"Oh I know, right now he is in the process of trying to confund me into making you stay in the house of the lions."
"Look Potter, I know we are not friends, hell we don't like each other but I need you breath with me, just this once I am going to help you okay?"
The next morning before he even made it to breakfast he was summoned to see the headmaster, he sighed before stopping his entrance into the Great Hall and back up to the Headmasters office.
"What about Muggleborns?"
Tom kissed the top of Harry's head.
Harry nodded once again. "Why?"
**********************************************************************************
Harry lent back further in the chair. "However the chances of my survival is always low so maybe I won’t have to live with the memory for much longer.."
Harry ran all the way to his room, locking the door behind him, he started pacing back and forth, he had just kissed the man who murdered his parents it was his fault that he had to live with Dursley's. He had been kissed by Tom and he liked it, Harry was so confused and Draco's face arose in his mind. "Shit maybe I have feelings for the prat after all?" Harry liked both Tom and Draco, one killed his parents and tried to kill him many times and the other was an old school rival who used to thrive on his embarrassment.
Tears were forming in Harry’s eyes as he fought himself, he didn’t want to cry. “But I’m hurting you both by not choosing, how can I claim to love you both when I cause you so much pain.”
The dreaded day came quickly, Today was the day that Harry was to meet Snape and Voldemort his answer, on whether he would continue to fight with Dumbledore, go neutral or switch sides completely. Harry had suffered from a migraine the whole week, Ron and Hermione had noticed something was wrong and had pestered him for answers but it would just cause him to snap at them before storming away with a shout of ‘mind your own business.
"Mione I'm coming with you to Hogwarts"
“Yes” Harry nodded. “That what makes this so hard.”
"I have no idea what to do Hermione." Harry groaned.
Hermione smiled whilst Draco yelled "What do you mean, you didn't want to interrupt again?"
“HARRY JAMES POTTER!” Sirius yelled
Tom put his hand on Harry's shoulder “This young man here is my newest recruit" whispers could be heard but were quickly silenced by Tom's glare. "Reveal yourself" Harry slowly lifted the mask from his face. His hand shaking as he dropped it to give everyone a look at his face. There was gasps and then silence, no one dared to speak... They were in shock." Harry Potter is to be my equal and will not bare my mark as he already wears one". Harry stood in shock he hadn't expected that. “If any harm is laid onto Harry from anyone you will die by my hand... Any objections?" If there was no one dare to move anyway. Harry smirked “I look forward to working with you; I have a feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun here" He gestured to Hermione and Draco to join them. "My lord can I have them as my most trusted". Tom nodded “Come on Mione, Drake.. We have evil plotting to do" Dragging the two surprised teenagers behind him.
“Just the Slytherin’s in your year and the one below.”
Harry went back to his seat while Snape continued his lecture on instinctual magic apparently some people were more in tuned to it than others, while some it would be a feeling of uneasiness, a sense of danger and then they could act on it, some could sense what the danger is and where and then act, for others it can be a mix of both it depends on the level of danger and on how someone is Intune with their own magic and the magic around them.
"I agree, surprisingly, he wasn't what I expected." Pansy spoke. "I was half expecting him to not show up and turn us in, payback for last year and all."
Harry stared at Draco, he had never thought about that, until now. “I can apparate on Hogwarts grounds"
Harry moved his fingers "Oh it’s only me and Dray… and why are you his adviser?"
Harry glared "What happened to whatever makes you happy Harry?"
Everyone was worried about both Harry and Draco, but had no idea what to do. They just hoped that Draco would wake up soon; they had no idea if Harry could take it if he didn’t. Harry was sitting by Draco’s bed since he had finished classes for today, it was where Harry spent most of his time these days. He was reading a book about potions out loud to Draco. Hoping that hearing his voice would soon wake the other up.
Draco chuckled “Of course not I had some fun before silencing" Seeing the annoyed look on Harry's face he adds quickly "I was supposed to come, next time wait until I'm here to leave".
Tom saw the tears that managed to escape run down Harry's cheeks despite the fact Harry tried to hide it.
Draco turned to see Harry smiling brightly at the scene he just witnessed "HARRY" Draco yelled and ran straight to Harry giving him a huge hug. "Make the mean girl go away" Draco pouted playfully.
"Who are the maurders?" Tom asked Harry
"Five points to Gryffindor Potter.” Snape sneered, his face showing a pained look he had never given Harry points before.
Luna giggled. “Kidding, your more like the Dark queen or lady, since Dark lord is already taken.”
Voldemort thought about it, and then let out a wicked grin before speaking "If you choose to join me then I believe we can make an accord, I won’t make you a death eater but you could be a spy."
Hermione and Harry spent the rest of the morning riding the horses and had a picnic outside in a Field filled with different types of flowers that held every colour of the rainbow it was simply breathtaking. Hermione had dragged Harry to one of the library's to Harry's dismay however they had lots of funny learning new spells by three o'clock, Harry had mastered ten new spells. Harry then dragged Hermione to the kitchen where he cooked her favourite chocolate sponge cake. Hermione adored Harry's cooking; whenever she asked how he could cook he simply would say it was something he loved to do. Hermione would have eaten the whole cake if she could if it hadn't been so filling and her not wanting her to get fat. Harry had laughed at her as he took a bite of his own slice of cake, he had complete forgot about who's house he was currently in and was lost in the moment of having fun with Hermione when a teenage blond walked in.
Harry's frowned “He tried to attack Fred and George"
"He properly fancies you" Hermione gave him a shocked look but soon recovered and she gave him a smile.
Harry chuckled before leading Tom to his favourite shop in Hogsmeade; he planned on getting all of his favourites.
The man chuckled "No person sleeps that stiff now take these, it will help you heal faster." He handed Harry three vials, which Harry downed quickly having promised Hermione he would do as he was told earlier. Harry coughed the last one tasted like charcoal; he almost spit it back up... Having had much experience with horrible tasting potions from his time in the hospital wing, he didn't.
Harry grinned "Where do I begin?"
Harry complied without complaint, causing Tom to smirk. It seemed in the bedroom Harry was willing to submit. Harry began to suck on Tom hard, as Draco continued sucking Harry. Harry’s eyes never left Tom’s as he sucked the other mans fingers.
"I will see you in a weeks’ time Potter, hopefully with news that will please me, it goes without saying to not speak of any of this to anyone." Voldemort rose from his chair gracefully sending Harry a dismissive gesture.
Hermione stared at him for a while before deciding it was okay to continue. “Voldemort thought it would be easier for me to be here when you woke up so you wouldn't go crazy."
Once Snape returned he handed the vial to the teen who took a mouthful without hesitation once again causing the others to wonder once again what was wrong with the boy.
Harry giggled, he actually giggled Tom couldn't believe what he just heard.
"Tell me that it isn't delicious."
Tom put his hand on Harry's shoulder “This young man here is my newest recruit" whispers could be heard but were quickly silenced by Tom's glare. "Reveal yourself" Harry slowly lifted the mask from his face. His hand shaking as he dropped it to give everyone a look at his face. There was gasps and then silence, no one dared to speak... They were in shock." Harry Potter is to be my equal and will not bare my mark as he already wears one". Harry stood in shock he hadn't expected that. “If any harm is laid onto Harry from anyone you will die by my hand... Any objections?" If there was no one dare to move anyway. Harry smirked “I look forward to working with you; I have a feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun here" He gestured to Hermione and Draco to join them. "My lord can I have them as my most trusted". Tom nodded “Come on Mione, Drake.. We have evil plotting to do" Dragging the two surprised teenagers behind him.
"He follows me."
"Does your behaviour have anything to do with Tom and Draco?"
They sat there in silence, Harry and Draco could do this without it being awkward. Harry had a stronger bond that Harry and Ron were never close to getting. "Drake I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship back at Hogwarts"
Harry looked at Hermione as if she was Insane” Hermione this is the man who killed my parents!" Hermione shook her head eyes watering
“Why one of my most loyal followers?"
Voldemort frowned at Harry's words not because Harry was in total denial but he thought saving someone life would lead them towards Harry using his real name. “It’s Tom Harry, I want you to call me Tom from now on" Harry thought about it for a few minutes but seemed to come to the conclusion that he owed the man his life. “Okay T-Tom" Harry nodded to himself.
