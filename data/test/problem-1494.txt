"Don't try and avoid this Draco." he sighed, brown eyes crashing into grey. Draco stopped passing, heading to the bars resting his head on there rusty surface.
He hesitated a moment, before reluctantly taking the envelope, slowly opening and reading it. Again he felt his stomach twist.
They soon stopped in a tiled, rather moldy, room. Harry presumed it was what was meant to pass as a bathroom. The floor was slippery where he stepped. The greenish brown slime that covered the floor almost made him land on his ass.
‘I thought I just said not to speak!’ He reprimanded. The sound of Draco filling the bath, white noise in the background.
Harry was simmering with rage. The effects of the draft wearing off. As if she hadn't done enough. This. This. He cant even say it was a new low. Because for her It wasn't.
‘You really don’t Harry. We were in a war. Apart for three years. I thought you were dead I know what your going to say. Ive heard the stories. It’s fine Harry I’m not thrilled about it. But I understand. As long as it didn’t mean anything...’
Draco realised what Harry would later recount as a war cry, before firing the A.K. Farmon body falling into the crashing waves below.
A relived sigh fell from Harry lips, as he bent down beside him. ‘Don’t you dare scare me like that. Your not going to die.’ He implored, getting to work cleaning the wound.
He stood rather awkwardly as he tried, and failed not to listen in on the conversation. So he looked at the busy, muggles catching cabs and dodging lorries, as they crossed roads, and entered shops.
Harry's anger was foreshadowed somewhat, by the pure relief of hearing about his friends. He hadn't seen or heard from them in three years, another of Pansy's brilliant plans, A spell that fooled he friends into believing that pansy was him, personality and all.
The protests became muffled. But that didn't mean they stopped. Then the moans and thrusting started.
"When I was a kid. I wanted to be a dragon tamer. I begged and begged for Mother to take me to the dragon reserve. Father put a stop to that." Malfoy bowed his seemingly lost in the memory. Harry was reluctantly intrigued looking at him, as he lays down arms crossed over the matey blanket. "Nothing I did was ever good enough for Father."
"Oh! Potter! Enough! Already!" Malfoy boomed. Taking his hands of his ears. After a half an hour of Potter loosing it. He had gone a bit spare himself.
Soldiers weren’t afforded the luxury of house elves to do their cooking, so a roaster was made to determine who had the honour of cooking and serving that day for a hoard of hungry soldiers.
He was one of those silent types. That Harry had neglected to catch the name of. Who gives a shit about an aurors name, he thought. When your being sent to Azkaban.
She wouldn’t get away with this. She. Thought she could break him. Keep him quiet. He would show everyone the truth.
The Auror elbowed him, while placing Pansy wand on the counter. The part Hag, Harry guessed. snatched up the wand quickly. Inspecting it, before sniffing it. Drawing the full length of the wand under her nose.
He knew he should get his shit together for their arrival, as new 1st commander of his platoon, Harry surprised a laugh at the thought. A platoon of two, what an army they made.
He was sitting on his bed. Slop on his lap, eating with his hands. They didn't allow cutlery, apparently there are many ingenious things one can do with a spoon.
Harry looked down at his cell floor, as continues pops! Went down the cell block.  A plate full of slop stared back at him. Harry stomach rolled, at the sight of it.
‘Well I’m glad they didn’t.’ Harry shot back looking into his beautiful grey eyes. Without hesitation he reached over to Draco’s left arm, intwining their fingers. ‘To me it shows you made a mistake. You had a past, but your future isn’t that mark Draco. You are not that mark.’
Malfoy took his hand and gave it a light squeeze. ‘I don’t want to either. I can’t bare to see our platoon out there cold, lifeless. Some.. some of them not even, not even whole. I know what your feeling Potter. They were my friends too. But we cant let their death be in vain.’
Harry had never had any family. But this little girl. She was his. He made her. The way she was made, was no way a child should be made. But that wasn't her fault. She didnt ask to be born. And if Harry was aware of her from the beginning he knew he would have grown to resent her, even hate her. But as she looked up at him, clinging to him like he was the most important thing in her world.
"Never!" Harry shot pack with conviction. Staring Malfoy down. He swore he saw the exact moment it clicked.
‘Donaldson’s up the duff.’ Malfoy supplied. Squeezing himself in between Harry and a witch called Gunderson. ‘Scooch over would you Potter.’
“I’d shut that filthy little mouth! If it wasn’t for his testimony, you’d be dead! Molding in the ground, that is if they even dined to give you a proper burial. And I’m not even going to mention what else you owe him! Well if it was me I’d have...”
Harry knew of course. The scavengers or ‘vultures’ as they have come to be called by the soldiers, were in charge of collecting the dead. They were a neutral party in the war, one of the safest regiments in the Godric forsaken, buggering piss stain of a war.
It was a mundane and relentless cycle. Get up, eat his morning slop. His lunch slop would appear and his would listen to the groans and moans in the other cells, then he would eat his dinner slop and go to bed.
Draco suddenly less blissed out than he was a moment ago, his face flashing with alarm for a millisecond. Before a cool act of composure replaced it. With no shame at all he rose from the pillows, starkers as the day he was born and headed to the bath.
Harry stoped listening. He knew all this, and contrary to what Ginny thought, he had been to a healer. He left not two minutes after the session started.
I have no excuses. Though I suggest reading the previous chapter again so you can catch yourself up.
"Then. I will deal with it when it comes. I wont always have you around to save me Malfoy. I have been alone most of my life."
‘I’m sorry Ginny. I know I promised. But I cant.’ He shot up, dashing out the door. Ginny’s cries of ‘Harry!’ Following him.
"Let's get through this party first, shall we?" Draco said. He took out his wand and, with a careful flick, the champagne poured itself generously into two of the flutes, which floated into Draco's outstretched hands. He offered one to Pansy and bowed, which she accepted with a dainty dip of her head.
Harry was nuzzling against his ear and it wasn’t totally disgusting. It was maybe even a little sweet.
“Mr Potter, I wasn’t aware you planned to attend tonight. Shall I alert the kitchens to double up? Tell the bartenders to hide their whisky?”
They lay there for a few long minutes, breathing in silence, until Draco rolls away. Harry’s eyes are still closed but he feels the loss of warmth and turns his head to watch Draco crawl across the floor, extract his wand from the heap of clothes, and with a wince, cast a Scourgify at himself, then at Harry. Harry shivers under his magic, then grins. Draco smiles back, a small, secret thing. He gestures with a tip of his chin and Harry nods. He knows what comes next but takes the time to enjoy the view as Draco snags trousers from the floor. It isn’t until he’s stepping into them and disappearing out the door to the little garden at the back of the house, that Harry realises Draco’s just walked off with his jeans. Bastard.
Potter leaned in, and Draco resisted the urge to fall back a step. "Between you and me? None of us do. We've found it's best to play along with Luna." Thankfully, Potter straightened. "Enjoying yourself?"
Theo’s hand on Draco’s elbow is a bit tighter than he’d like, and as they walk towards the nearest safe Apparition point, Theo leans in.
The doors slid open and as soon as he stepped through, Harry was hit by a blast of cool, dry air - a welcome contrast to the ruddy humidity outside. His boots squeaked against the marble floors and echoed through the cavernous lobby as he approached a prim woman with cat-eye glasses and a severe suit sitting at the front desk. She was plucking away at a keyboard, which struck Harry as odd because if the clock on the wall, the bubble of cooling charms, and the line of austere eagle owls were any indication, the building was magical.
that looks dreadful." A deep voice with a musical accent cut through Draco's fog of frustration, and he peered between his fingers.
“I’m going to level with you, Draco. Potter isn’t going to show up. He isn’t just going to appear in the flat again. He’s ticked and indignant, and he’s convinced you played him. If you want him, then you’re going to have to get off that pretty arse and do something about it.”
Draco hovered there, watching him for what was probably an inappropriate amount of time, trying to decide what to do. He could go lay on the sofa, but while the thing was nice to look at, it was hard and unforgiving, and Draco likely wouldn't sleep a wink. He took a step forward, dropping one knee to the mattress, waiting to see if Harry would wake. But Harry just made a sleepy sound, a soft huff, and rubbed his face against the pillow. His eyes stayed closed.
Pansy’s quirked brow arches higher. “The blind leading the blind, I’d say. It might be an opportunity.”
"I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about," Draco replied with a haughty sniff. It was a blatant lie, of course. It wasn't as if Draco didn't know that he gravitated towards the tall, dark, and handsome. That he found scars rather dangerous and glasses, crooked smiles, and wild hair charming rather than sloppy.
Draco recoiled. “You mean, apart from being trapped in your fuck pad for the past two months? Everything’s tip-top.”
“That’s a good point,” Harry said, then yawned. “Maybe I’ll just tell you in the morning, since you’ll still be here.”
Potter sighed and twisted, turning his back to the skyline and leaning against the railing, his head hanging back over great heights in a way that made Draco want to yank him away from danger, to shield him.
Draco gave his jacket a final tug, flattened a hand down his tie, and lifted his chin. They were at the threshold now, and Draco could hear the murmurs of voices from the ballroom. “Need someone to show you how it’s done?”
Draco watched with blank-faced befuddlement as Potter stripped off his clothes — holey jeans and a t-shirt, which now sported iron-red fingerprints, though Draco didn’t remember clutching at him. His clothing landed in a heap in the corner, and with a hand at Draco’s shoulder, Potter stepped into the tub behind him. He wrapped an arm around Draco’s middle and pulled him back against his warm, bare chest.
"I don't," Draco replied airily, though he kept his eyes on the sky as if looking for the Snitch, when all he really wanted was to look anywhere but Potter.
Potter's responding nod was tight, resolute, accepting the implication in Draco's words that this may be all they got — only tonight.
Harry swung around, looking back at Draco over his shoulder from where he hovered, the wind in his hair and his shirt whipping free, grinning in that lovely, crooked way. He looked like the very embodiment of every one of Draco's dreams come to life.
Draco downed his glass of wine as he scanned the room, but Potter was nowhere to be found. Draco was imagining ways to skin Potter alive if the prat had bunked off and gone home, when there was a light touch to Draco’s elbow. He turned, teeth bared, ready to snap at the first high-collared, self-important twat who dared bother him.
he was going to come waltzing up completely sloshed I would have obliviated the poor bastard. I can count on one hand the number of times this sort of thing has happened to me and truthfully, Harry, it is just
Harry kicked the bike stand with his boot and swung his leg over the seat with practised ease. He grinned at Draco as he carded a hand through his windswept hair, which only made it wilder.
Draco cleared his throat but continued his perusal of the items on the shelf. "Currently available options are… less than adequate."
Draco massaged his temples with his fingertips, hoping to rub away the ache in his skull that even his strongest hangover potion couldn’t quite reach. He shouldn’t have finished that second bottle of champagne with Pansy. And he definitely shouldn’t have followed it with the Dwarven Vodka on ice back at her posh flat.
Draco speaks slowly, his mind trailing uselessly behind his heart, trying to understand if it has any cause to beat so bloody hard. “Those aren’t things that roommates do.”
something about him, a certain magnetism. Perhaps it is because Potter doesn’t suffer fools, doesn’t bend to power or corruption. Instead, he possesses a bullheaded confidence that Draco supposes he’s always admired.
as mid-day rolled around, the desire to brew begins to pull at draco. he had finished cleaning the house, and had absently flicked through the last few chapters of the novel hermione had recommended to him. he stands from the couch, summoning one of harry’s old sweaters and pulling it over his head. he hated brewing in his own clothing - and harry would hardly notice a stain in the already muddy brown fabric of this sweater from at least seven years ago.
“please don’t hate me, draco,” he whispers, shattering draco’s heart one more time, because why not. “i know you did…. do…but, please,”
for a long moment, they’re both silent. draco breathes shallowly, allowing harry’s words to wash over him. emotion swells in his chest - a result of a strange flood of hormones post-orgasm, and his response to harry’s sweet, sweet words. he longed to respond - to be able to pull himself together and make harry feel the same way he did, the way that he always felt in this relationship.
“well,” the healer said, stepping from the elevator. at the end of the hallway, there was a large group of healers surrounding a door. despite the crowd, there was complete silence. “it looks like a suicide attempt,” the healer said quietly, looking over at hermione.
they go again and again and again, making up for lost time and reintroducing themselves to each other, until it’s dark outside, and the idea of moving seems impossible. now, they move together, harry throwing an arm around draco and pulling him close. his eyes are heavy and he feels his body easing into unconsciousness, so he leans up and brushes his lips against harry’s harry, although awake, doesn’t make an effort to deepen the kiss, instead allowing their lips to brush each others delicately - and somehow, this is more intimate than anything they had done all night, even when inside and all around each other.
when draco had originally began seeing harry, his parents had been extremely reluctant to accept their relationship. there had been multiple long talks on preserving the family name, and following pureblood customs, and other rubbish that draco had dutifully ignored. eventually, they had began to accept their relationship - his mother had simply been pleased that draco had seemingly found his soulmate and was happy. lucius had muttered something about optics and rebranding and had stopped actively picking fights with harry - although his mouth was perpetually twisted into a frown whenever the two were forced to interact. family dinners had been infrequent and tense, and draco had almost always had to make up for them with lots of groveling and kisses afterwards.
harry is the one that makes the first move. he sits up, quickly, pulling draco into his lap and connecting their lips. they fall into the rhythm of the kiss easily, with draco’s arms circling harry’s neck and harry’s hands coming to settle on draco’s waist.
hermione was sat in her office, reading diligently through paperwork and dictating to her quick quotes quill. the minister for magic sign on her door gleamed, and carvings of a witch, wizard, house elf, and other magical creatures greeted him with a wave.
“oh, draco,” pansy sighs, at a total loss for words. she doesn’t try to hug him - a testament to how well she knows him after all these years. instead, she flicks her wand and places a privacy charm around them, giving draco the room to be as loud as he needs without the public eye on him. “i’m sorry, love.”
- he glanced down at his ring, simple and elegant and everything he could ever hope for. harry caught him looking and reached over, squeezing his hand for a short moment before pulling away and joining in on the applause for hermione, who was beaming as she moved back towards their table.
“fuck you,” he chokes, his eyes watering more now. inexplicably, tears threaten to escape, and he forces them back. “fuck you.”
“are you ready?” he asked softly, staring up at draco. his eyes were clear and bright as they trained on harry’s. draco didn’t respond, instead reaching behind him and taking harry’s cock in hand and lining it up with his hole.
he doesn’t know this body - this body that is littered in strange marks, this body that does not move, or breathe, or radiate warmth or comfort, or smile crookedly and offer peppermints. he knows harry - harry potter, who does all of these things and more. but he can’t find harry - not in this body, not in their home, in their bed - not anywhere he should be.
harry groaned loudly as his pleasure retreated, opening his eyes and blinking hazily. “turn around then, you prick.” he commands, sitting up on his elbows.
draco reached behind him, plucking a bottle of lube from the vanity without looking. “you could try to sound more excited,” he suggested, shimmying happily towards the bed. “i’m pretty much doing you a favor.”
“yeah.” potter breathes, his eyes flicking down to draco’s lips, and then back up to his eyes. he flicks his pink tongue against his lips, dampening them, and draco’s heart stops. “you’re nothing like i thought.”
“the mint,” he provides, and she nods. “he really liked mint. peppermint, specifically.  was always offering it to me. it was sort of… one of our things.”
goyle grunted in agreement, nodding solemnly. draco blinked in confusion, and resolved to find out exactly which hufflepuff had wronged his friends. already bored, theo stood and wandered away from the table.
“don’t - don’t fucking call me that, stop calling me that,” draco sobs, his chest wracking with each breath. he feels as if he’ll be sick with the force of his anguish, as if he’ll hyperventilate and pass out, or die. “you always call me draco. i’m draco.”
they lapse into a comfortable silence - harry leaning heavily into draco, his arm breath ghosting across draco’s exposed neck. draco stands still for a few long moments, savoring the familiar warmth of harry’s body against his own. however, he realizes, rather belatedly, that harry isn’t simply hugging him, but rather falling asleep in his arms - while still standing up. he rouses him gently, pushing him away and half-holding him up. he flirts with the idea of a shower - showering with harry is always wonderful, a slow, warm, gentle haze that more often than not ends with them wrapped around each other, original intentions long-forgotten. he dismisses the idea fairly quickly, and settles for a cleaning charm that washes over them with a tingle of magic. he undresses harry slowly, in a manner that is distinctly non-sexual - pulling his robes from his shoulders and discarding them into a pile on the floor. when he’s in only his pants, harry blinks blearily, rubbing at his eyes for a second before crawling into bed in a decidedly un-elegant manner. even in his half-asleep state, he rolls to his side of the bed and lifts the cover, holding it open for draco to crawl under. he strips quickly, tossing his remaining clothes into the same pile as harry’s, before crawling into the bed on his own side.
“mmm,” draco murmured when the pain had finally crossed the threshold and turned to pleasure. “‘m okay,”
“you heard me,” draco says, turning to fix seamus with a steady look. he smiles politely, tilting his head a bit. “potter put a ring on she-weasley’s finger, but he was just grabbing his ankles for me the other night… congratulations on your engagement though, really.”
“i thought the getting drunk was to not talk about relationships” blaise groaned from the floor, where he was lying facedown. “god, draco, don’t you have any hobbies?”
“draco,” harry said softly, sitting beside him and wrapping his arms around his trembling body. “draco, baby -”
“it’s the twenty-first century,” she says lowly, pouring herself another glass. “when will people learn to respect others' sexualities and relationships?”
“eleven,” draco mutters. at eleven, he had just received his own wing in malfoy manor, and his own personal house elf. he had slept in a large, fluffy bed with lots of space, and had been doted on. at eleven, he had been happy. “yes - yes,” he refocuses, and makes a conscious effort to calm his rage into a slow, controlled burn, rather than the wildfire that threatens to consume him now. “right. follow me.”
after a long while, harry and hermione made their way to the table - sharing a matching weary glance and soft smiles. most of the guests had already arrived and taken their seats, and refreshments and hors d'oeuvres were being passed around - draco had watched with mingled horror and amusement as ron had inhaled four spinach puffs without pausing to take a breath or a sip of water. neither sat down - instead, hermione leaned over the back of her chair, sipping elegantly but fleetingly from her glass of water before pressing a gentle kiss to ron’s lips and taking a few deep breaths. harry stood behind draco as she prepared herself, one sure hand resting on his shoulder and applying the faintest bit of pressure. hermione smiled expectantly at harry, and then they swept off once more, towards the raised platform to the left of their table.
he thinks about andrew - with his dark skin and crooked smile and gentle voice and large hands, about the way that draco can still hear him pacing the kitchen right now, shaking with anger. he’s always been this way about draco - protective, and willing to go to bat for him. andrew is kind, and loving, and smart, and accepting. he loves draco, wholeheartedly, even on the days when he is impossible to love. andrew looks over at him when he’s at his worst, and smiles and says
well enough to still want to spend their lives together. his hands tremble as he pulls the box open, equal parts dreading what he knows is inside and needing it desperately. as it flips open, a small piece of paper flutters out and floats delicately to the ground. draco places the ring on the counter and bends, grabbing the paper between two fingers and exhaling as he flips it around. there, in harry’s messy and cramped handwriting, are the words -
“do you like it?” he asks gently, reaching out and lightly touching draco’s elbow. draco moves into his touch quickly, throwing his arms around harry’s neck and pulling him close. they stand that way for a long moment, holding each other in silence.
when harry finally tapers off, he takes a sip from his mug and stares expectantly at draco, a delicate smile still playing on his lips.
“die, probably,” harry snorted. draco cocked an eyebrow as he fumbled with his own robes. harry opened his eyes, hazy and unguarded without his glasses. “i don’t know. my social battery is depleted, and i don’t have the energy to flirt with you. i’m sorry.” draco laughs quietly, leaning in close and pressing a fleeting kiss to harry’s lips. harry smiles weakly. “but i love you. you looked amazing tonight.”
after a moment, draco began to sink down onto harry’s cock. despite having had him only a few hours before, it was a bit of a stretch. he hissed under his breath as he felt his body opening to harry, his eyes shut tight. true to his character, harry stroked draco’s sides gently and pressed soft kisses to his shoulder as he waited.
the next morning, hermione appears through the floo, her eyes puffy and bloodshot red, and her hair fastened into a haphazard bun. when she finds draco curled on the floor of his bedroom, still naked, she bursts into tears again. her maternal instincts seem to take over as she sits draco up and dresses him manually, and then hoists him up and leads him to the floo slowly.
“i don’t want anyone else,” draco cried, sounding a bit petulant, although pansy supposed that he was allowed to do so in the moment.  “i love
time seemed to freeze around them as they kissed - draco’s hands going to wrap around harry’s neck as harry’s came down to rest at draco’s waist. the world, which had been so dull and boring over the last few weeks, suddenly seemed to be bursting with color and excitement. it was as if something had shifted - and things were finally okay again. neither party was sure how long they stood there, wrapped in each other and completely oblivious to the world around them. it was a loud cough that finally dragged them back to reality - pushing them apart.
“it’s ours,” harry said softly, pressing his lips to the back of draco’s head. “this can be our place.” he wrapped his arms around draco and pulled him close, pressing draco’s back to his chest.
“what is it you want to know?” draco says softly, indulging her. after all, granger is practically a genius - and there might be some truth behind her claim. and if talking about harry could make draco stop feeling nauseous every time he looked in the mirror, than he was willing to try it.
in the large bed, wrapped up in each other and beneath a thick duvet, draco and harry sleep. in the bathroom, the faucet drips slowly and steadily - a malfunction draco had meant to fix at some point, until the droplets of water became calming and helped to lull him to sleep on the harder nights. in the living room, briseis curls up in a patch of moonlight, whiskers twitching and purring softly as she does. in the kitchen, on draco’s small wooden table, lays a letter written in blue ink and soft cursive -
“draco, don’t you think you’re being a bit dramatic?” harry tried, his hands trembling with the effort of holding in his laughter.
. harry had quickly fallen rather hard for draco - but ron had been steadfast in his disdain for draco, and had only begun to loosen up around the time that he and harry had moved in together. their relationship now was friendly - although they rarely spent time together alone, they got along well enough. it was still strange, however, for draco to randomly dole out compliments.
draco dialed on one of the only numbers he knew by heart, putting the phone to his ear and pulling his knees to his chest.
in his seat, ron’s eyes bulge comically and a red flush rises on his neck. the rest of the table bursts into laughter and hoots, only goading draco more. as draco’s nimble fingers find the top button on harry’s shirt, harry finally pulls him away, bracing his hands on his shoulder.
. he understands that draco struggles with their relationship sometimes  - struggles with showing the love that he feels inside - a remnant of his and harry’s relationship, and a permanent, brutal reminder of what had happened that night that draco had tried to show harry that he loved him. andrew is perfect and draco loves him so very much, more than he ever thought himself capable of after harry.
love came easily to harry, yet he remained patient with draco and his aversion to overt emotional vulnerability.  which, of course, was constant. except for when he had had a few drinks.
their clothes come off slowly, first, harry’s shirt, if only so that draco can feel the warmth of his skin - can reacquaint himself with the ever-burning inferno that seems to exist beneath potter’s skin. and then draco’s shirt, shucked off so that harry can rub gentle patterns into his back as they kiss, a heart, and a star, and spirals, and circles, but mostly hearts, over and over and over again. harry's pants go as draco kisses down his torso, desperate to mark, to touch every part of harry that he can - from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. his own pants go not too long after that, although in a decidedly less sexy way - he stands to kick them off, shaking with nerves and want, and trips over the leg of his own pants. harry laughs - loud and warm, before sliding down the bed and helping draco to peel off his trousers, pressing gentle kisses to draco’s thin calves as he does. and then they’re naked, and draco can hardly breathe.
“draco!” he calls, turning around. when he spots draco already leaning over the rail, he grins, opening his arms wide to him. “come here!” his excitement is palpable, and reminds draco a bit of an excited crup, or a giggling baby. draco rushes down the steps to the beach, his smile stretching impossibly wide. affection swells in his chest, warm and familiar.
finally, draco gives in to his inner impulsive gryffindor, rushing over to his stores and picking out everything he needs.
“draco,” hermione stepped forward, her voice gentle and hand outstretched. he doesn’t have to look up at her to know that her eyebrows are furrowed and her lips are pursed in that familiar motherly expression that she always gets when she looks at rose or draco.
harry hums noncommittally in response, his arms pulling draco even closer. a low moan fell from his lips as draco finally pulled his hands from his hair - smoothing it away from his face and planting a soft kiss on harry’s forehead. rather than returning draco’s gentle ministrations, harry - never one for subtlety, bucked his hips shallowly.
the warmth that had once flown through him every time he held it was long gone. now, he felt a bit silly, brandishing the practically useless piece of wood. he knew that if he tried - if he reached down far enough into himself that he would probably be able to muster the power to cast a small spell - maybe a
“proposed to your girlfriend?” draco looks over at harry, unsure if he looks hurt or angry or sad or a strange mix of the three. “bloody hell, harry, you caught me off guard! i thought i was just your little secret… a stress reliever of sorts… and then you were there, telling me that you loved me, and i didn’t know how to react!”
dudley seems to have realized that he had gone wrong somewhere, and his beady eyes begin to water. “it - it didn’t feel important. it didn’t come up,” he stammers, his lips trembling. he looks around as he talks, as if used to having someone to look at for guidance when answering questions.
“no, harry!” draco says loudly, his voice raw and far more desperate than he had intended. he wants to fall to the ground beside him, to cry and shake and completely fall apart as hurt slices open his insides, spilling out everything he had kept inside for so long. “stop,” he pleads, shaking his head. he doesn’t want to -
r,” he had whispered, placing a gentle hand on draco’s knee. he squeezed it lightly, the same way he did everything, and draco felt himself begin to fall madly in love. “
for an hour, draco busied himself with cleaning the living room and kitchen by hand and sobering up. he fluffed pillows, washed glasses, and folded throw blankets repeatedly, all the while listening carefully up the stairs. harry doesn’t reappear down the steps, or show any signs that he’s actually in the house - and so, after an hour, draco takes a deep breath and climbs the stairs slowly, his hands trembling by his side.
“i know, harry,” draco says quietly, shaking his head. he pauses, staring down at the table with a burning throat, biting at his lip to keep himself from sobbing. his voice trembles as he does, but he continues - “i know… but you don’t understand how much this is hurting me. i stay awake all night watching you to make sure that you don’t aspyhixiate, or overdose  - and this isn’t the first time, harry!” he thinks about that awful night last year, when he had curled on the bathroom floor with harry and pressed cool rags to his forehead, vanishing the puddles if sick harry kept producing and praying to
another shift of sheets, and then harry was pressing into draco from behind. his morning stiffness pressed against the curve of draco’s backside, and harry’s arm ran down the length of his body, coming to rest on his narrow hip. harry breathed hot air on the nape of draco’s neck, planting an open mouth kissed on the small freckle between his shoulder and neck. another smaller kiss, about an inch down, and then a third, directly on the bone of draco’s shoulder.
draco doesn’t answer, can’t answer, because he’s too busy staring straight ahead, into harry’s eyes. he wants to run and scream, to burst into tears and fall to the ground, sobbing. he wants to close the door and pretend this this never happened, wants to find a time turner and go back in time actually make this never happen.
“has healing qualities?” draco finished, leaning forward to press his lips to harry’s. “i did know that, actually.”
“and that’s our cue.” harry says loudly, steering a writhing draco towards the door. “i’m just going to get him to bed. goodnight, all!”
“saturday.” draco provides. they both gasp, and guilt bites at draco. for the last year, they had been his rock - and he had served as an alternate third to their trio. and suddenly, he was jetting off to america. for the second time, they would be unexpectedly abandoned by a close friend. tears welled in draco’s eyes and he blinked them away quickly. “i’m sorry - i know it’s soon. i’m not selling the house or anything yet. i’d like to know that it’s here. that he’s here. if i ever need it. but i just can’t live here anymore.” he exhaled shakily biting his lip to keep his emotions at bay. “it’s killing me.”
he looks up as he hears harry come in, his eyes just as damp as they had been a few moments ago. he still looks the same, not fundamentally altered in any way, as if he hadn’t just been orphaned at the hands of his partner.
potter takes a few more sips, looking around at draco’s home and nodding pleasantly and tapping his foot. he looks at peace, and natural, and (although draco’s loathe to admit it) at home in draco’s small cottage, surrounding by all of his things. and then potter starts talking, and everything goes terribly wrong.
“lucius,” harry murmured, simply because he didn’t know what else to say. “why wouldn’t he say anything - god, draco, i’m sorry, baby. i’m so sorry.”
pansy and draco chat idly as they drink - she complains about the creep she had been forced to sit next to all night. apparently, he had shamelessly hit on her all night, even after she had very plainly told him that she was a lesbian, and showed him the fake engagement ring she tended to wear at events like these.
“is draco here?” hermione pressed. the healer began to inch away from her, and she carefully kept pace. “he should be harry’s emergency contact. does he know what’s going on?”
he comes with only three firm strokes, his head hanging limply as he shouts harry’s name and paints their clean sheets with his release. harry strokes him through his orgasm, one hand on his cock and the other wrapped around his waist, supporting his limp body.
harry was, without question, the best person that draco had ever met. he was selfless and generous and unfailingly kind to everyone he met. harry deserved to be doted on and looked after by everyone he met, to have the ground he walked on worshipped. he didn’t deserve cupboards, and to be called a freak, and to feel unloved and insecure -
“good, then?” draco asked, already knowing the answer. he closed his book and put it aside and shifted his position so that he could lean his head on harry’s shoulder while still sipping at his own drink.
while she tattoo’s draco, luna hums softly to herself - a song completely different from the one playing on the speakers throughout the shop. draco remains quiet as she works, only occasionally humming softly when she asks if he’s feeling okay, or if he’s in any pain, or if he’s spoken with any “humans” with tails recently.
“that is our couch lube,” draco sneered, snatching it from goyle’s hand. “sometimes we can’t wait. now, if we could focus on what’s actually important -“
“he would love it, too,” luna says softly, coming to stand beside him in the mirror. she smiles serenely, her eyes twinkling as if she knows something that draco doesn’t.
“i love you so much. even more than anyone else,” he whispers, his lips curving down into a frown. “well, except for the kids, of course. but everyone else.”
- he says it as if it’ll bring her back, as if he’ll open his eyes and see narcissa malfoy hovering over him, her familiar but uncanny smile stretched across her lips. but he won’t. draco knows this, and the realisation bursts through him, tearing him apart piece by piece.
“going somewhere, draco?” ron shouted, catching a pair of loafers that nearly smacked him in the head.
his robes had been custom-made by his favorite tailor in italy - they were a deep blue, made up of a lightweight fabric that swirled around his legs alluringly when he walked and gave off a faint impression of the midnight sky, alight with stars and constellations. the cut of the robes was flattering - accentuating his broad shoulders and lightly muscled arms and cinching at his waist, before flowing out in a wave of soft fabric. he had ordered them specifically for this event and had been properly pleased when he had gone to pick them up and been greeted with a masterpiece.
in london again. just like their home, the city is littered with memories of the time he and harry had had together. since the idea of relocating had come to him, he had been anxiously counting down the days until he could finally leave all of this behind.
draco was silent for a moment - his sleep-addled brain conjuring memories, feelings, apparitions. he wasn’t sure what was real, or what was fake - he saw himself and harry twirling through the kitchen, kissing lightly in his office, laughing over dinner - a phantasmagoria from his and harry’s relationship, of the last ten years, of their future together. he thinks of the cottage, of the average life-span of wizards, of how long he’ll have to have nights just like this - to go through hell and then still wake up in harry’s arms the next morning, ready to do it all over again if only it meant that he could come home to harry, could have dinner with him and listen to his stupid jokes.
he sees two mugs  - one, fire engine red and the other pale blue, with a single crack running down the side, a scar acquired during the move from draco’s small flat to the home they share. his small saucer with his slice of toast sits beside his mug, gone cold and dry and missing a small bite. the small puddles of draco’s coffee form abstract patterns, almost like the markings of a cow. yesterdays edition of the prophet sits folded near the edge of the table, in the place where nobody sits. these are marks on the table, notches and scratches either irreversible by magic or too insignificant to be fixed, gathered from years of use. there are places where the wood is naturally burnt, or discolored. it is their table. they have argued, and made up, and cried, and kissed, and fucked, and lived at this table. and on top of the table, there are two mugs, one chipped and one whole, both full of coffee. there is an old newspaper, and a small plate with a slice of toast, and nothing else at all.
harry scoffed as he entered the living room, taking in the sight. even without his glasses - he could clearly see what was happening. draco was lying on the couch, with achilles sat on his chest. after only a year, the dog had grown rapidly and was now nearly 40 kgs, in comparison to the 3 kg he had been when harry had first bought him home. however, none of this seemed to matter to draco, who grinned up at the dog as if he was weightless.
“he’s sure!” harry calls, grinning. draco pinches harry’s forearm, which is wrapped around his waist, but burrow deeper into his side nonetheless.
draco went about his routine happily, delighting in the causal domesticity of taking care of his and harry’s home. if someone had told him as a child that he’d genuinely enjoy acting as a housewife - cooking and cleaning and waiting around for his beau to come home, he would’ve laughed in their face. now, he found himself completely content to keep things tidy in their home, while also taking as much time as he needed for himself to brew, or research, or do whatever it is that he wanted to do.
“don’t tell me what to do, potter,” draco spits, taking a slow sip from his glass. he doesn’t have the patience or the proper attitude to deal with potter’s misplaced sense of moral superiority, especially not tonight.
“merlin’s beard, this is ridiculous.” blaise said, “you couldn’t See your way out of fucking cauldron, malfoy. potter loves you. it’s obvious. why do you insist on torturing us if you wont even give us anything in return? for example, the excellent head you claim to give.”
“maybe i should measure how much is inside,” he said, more to himself than anything. “just to be sure.”
, did you ever tell your friends at school about what your parents were doing to harry? any teachers… anyone? about how he was sleeping in a cupboard… barely getting meals… being generally neglected?”
“i fucking hate peppermint,” he gasps, dropping it to the ground as if suddenly realizing that it is hot to the touch. “i hate peppermint so much - it’s not even
at hermione’s suggestion, harry clenches his fist imperceptibly, but draco catches it. he knows the violent side of harry quite intimately, knows that he wants nothing more than to grab hermione by her hair right now, and slam her face into the wall again and again, breaking her nose and knocking her unconscious.
“my new potion was approved by the board yesterday,” he says tersely. he hadn’t meant to say it - hadn’t wanted to share his wonderful news this way. yet, as he sits across from harry, he finds that antibodies and experimental trials are all he can think of right now. he wishes that he could give his potion to harry, could use it to fix whatever imbalance in his brain it was that caused him to crave drugs and other substances that could kill him. he hadn’t understood it, even when hermione had pulled him aside last year and handed him a pamphlet about dealing with drug abuse in loved ones. he had thrown it away in a fit of anger after flipping through it absently - but one particular one-liner had stuck with him.
draco blinked dazedly, seemingly suddenly aware of the fact that he had guests. he dropped his wand to his side with a quiet sigh. the objects still suspended in mid-air fell to the floor with a loud crash, causing the trio to jump.
as they pass over the crest of the hill, a slight gasp of surprise leaves draco’s lips. there, nestled in a private cove, was a small cottage. he ran down the rest of the way - keeping pace with harry up until the front door.
harry, never one to half-commit to anything, pushes his finger completely inside, pressing lightly against draco’s prostate. when he lets out a scream of pleasure, harry quickly pulls out, chuckling lightly. and so it goes, with harry applying exactly the right amount of pressure but for never enough time, while draco bucks wildly, curses dripping from his mouth like saliva.
the first time that potter kissed him, draco had quickly thrown up all over his shoes. he had been three or four sheets to the wind - after stupidly accepting a dare from longbottom to match finnegan shot for shot. he had stumbled to the bathroom and took a piss, and then bumped into potter on the way out. he had only glanced at potter for a second before he had lunged forward, assaulting draco with a deliciously sloppy kiss. it had lasted for a few moments, before draco pulled away and proceeded to empty the contents of his stomach onto the floor in front of potter's feet.
“the sex rule-maker!” goyle burst, looking proud of himself. when silence followed, he grumbled. “it was funny,”
“yes,” draco said simply, swirling his drink in his hand. the ice had long melted, and he had no interest in finishing the low grade alcohol that the ministry had provided. he raised the glass to his lips and took a sip anyways, just to give himself something to do.
“i’m sure he’s fine,” ron said, although the worried expression on his face said differently. “we should go down there. we can bring rosie back later, yea?”
draco sighed contentedly as a breeze passed, carrying the sweet scent of the flowers. he flexed his fingers and toes, smiling as the soft grass scratched at his skin. the moment felt perfect - and reminded him much of his childhood. he had spent many days in the gardens of the manor with his mother - rolling in the grass and helping her tend to the garden as much as his small, clumsy fingers could handle.
on the last day of their vacation, they woke late in the day. sunlight was already streaming through the windows, casting patterns across their white duvet. they chatted idly for a while - lamenting the idea of returning to london and having to go back to work and normalcy. france had been a dream - and neither was ready to wake. when harry pulled the small box from beneath his pillow, draco blinked at it for a few long moments, wondering silently if his eyes were deceiving him.
“i’d say that’s enough small talk,” harry grins, reaching across the bed for a pillow. lucius’ eyes bulge in his skull, as if he hadn’t actually expected harry to carry out his promises. “any last words? no, i didn’t think so. good bye, lucius. see you in hell.”
“oh no, i still want to hear everything you were going to say,” draco grins, pressing his forehead to harry’s. “just wanted to make it clear that my answer is yes.”
with each breath, his lungs rattle, close to giving out but holding on just so that he can spend just a bit more time with the people who care for him. they seem to be staring down at him, waiting for him to say something else, perhaps make a speech about the fleeting nature of life, or the welcoming embrace of death - but he doesn’t have it in him.
“women,” blaise sighed, looking over at neville. neville stared blankly back at him, his eyes lingering on the hulking man that was currently murmuring into his ear and indiscreetly rubbing at his thigh.
“are you talking about the lube?” came theo’s voice from up the stairs, along with the sound of doors opening and closing.
“anyways, on to happier things! where are you now? what’s all that noise? let me guess: morocco? the maldives?”
from the table beside him, the mobile harry had insisted he get began to vibrate loudly, shattering his dreamy hypnagogia. he reached out blindly, feeling around for the phone before quickly accepting the call and putting it to his ear.
he had only needed to brew a few batches of pepper-up potion - a request from one of his most frequent customers in an attempt to combat the upcoming flu season. draco hummed quietly to himself as he crushed the bicorn horn, his mind far away as his hands worked automatically, already very familiar with the process of making this particular potion. his thoughts had wandered, as they tended to do, to harry.
the next morning, he is met by an entourage at the airport. hermione, ron, pansy, goyle, and blaise huddle near his terminal, wearing matching sad smiles. hermione looks marginally more comfortable than the rest of the purebloods - who blink around with large eyes and flinch when muggles walk by, rolling suitcases and talking loudly into bluetooth earpieces.
“hmmm,” harry is quiet for a long while, before sitting up a bit, propping himself up with an elbow. “well… i want to do something with kids. i want to help, as much as possible. maybe become a professor at hogwarts. i could probably teach dada. or even open an orphanage... i’ve got more than enough money.”
even now, years later, the cottage remained a light at the end of the tunnel. they referenced it constantly, always adding details and expanding the dream. they had picked paint swatches and rugs and lamps and all sorts of tiny details, slowly making everything seem more real as time went on. and then, suddenly, it had been real. on christmas, two years ago, draco had gifted harry a key, which he had later discovered unlocked the door to a spacious, homely cottage all the way out in oxford. slowly but surely, they had begun renovating and decorating the home - it would be finished sometime in the next four years. then, it would sit empty, waiting for the way that harry finally stepped down from minister.
draco nodded despite himself, using the back of his dirty hand to wipe at his cheeks - he refused to sit here and blubber like a baby in front of this centaur.
and then the floo roars again, and hermione tumbles out. she doesn’t say anything, just immediately whips out her wand and begins to cast rapidly, sealing the floo and throwing up wards around the house. draco can recognize a few repelling and protection charms, and doesn’t know how he feels about the fact that she’s putting them up against her best friend, in protection of someone who once sneered at her and called her a
“so are you,” harry murmured, reaching over and running a finger across draco’s jawline. “you were always pointy but now you’re like… pointy in a hot way.”
. “i never told you about the bloody potion. i kept it a surprise, because i wanted you to be proud of me. you don’t even know what i’m
at the base of the stairs, pansy, as well as three other aurors from harry’s larger, usual group of bodyguards stood at attention, their arms crossed behind their backs and their faces set into identical, stoic lines.
bizarrely enough, in this terrible, awkward moment, he wants harry. or at least, the harry from the beginning of their relationship. that harry would hold him like ron holds hermione, stroking his hair and kissing the crown of his head and making him tea and speaking gently to him until he can stop shaking. except, this harry, the gentle, doting one, is one and the same with the new harry, the harry who holds him at wandpoint and spews hatred and would have probably killed him eventually. the two seem so far divorced in his mind that he genuinely has difficulty processing the fact that they are the same person - that the harry who had once stroked his cheek and called him beautiful could also posses the capacity to be so cruel.
“of course not, you arsehole! i don’t want him to break up with me! i fucking love him! i want to spend the rest of my bloody life with him!” he spat. at any other time, draco would’ve been embarrassed by his show of vulnerability, but all of his sensible emotions were overridden by his frustration at zabini. more and more, draco found himself wishing that pansy had come alone.
draco immediately sat up, turning to hermione. “what charm was that? i feel so much better already.”
“draco,” pansy said softly, reaching across the table to touch his hand. “is there something else going on? why do you suddenly believe that harry is cheating on you?”
his amortentia had smelled like harry. harry potter, the saviour of the wizarding world and patron saint of orphans and gryffindors, who draco still privately believed to be much too virtuous and good and deserving to pursue draco - shared a scent with draco’s amortentia. the...
“everyone thinks i'm so brave,” harry continues, his voice shaking terribly now. “i’m not. i'm a coward. everyone expected me to settle down after the war… marry ginny, have three kids and a krup, become an auror and spend the rest of my days doing what everyone told me to. and i was ready to do those things, just because it was what was expected of me. but i don’t want to do that - i don’t want any of it. i want you, draco. and i was afraid of it, so i ran away from it, and in the process i… i hurt you, which was the last thing i ever wanted to do.”
after a moment, harry pulls away - straddling draco’s’ body and moving up until he’s nearly sat on his chest. his cock, fully erect and glistening with pre-come bobs between them - and draco eyes it hungrily.
“fuck off,” burst draco, the anger in his voice being cancelled out by the flow of tears. “we like to have sex, it’s not a crime.”
“so was he!” draco roars. dudley flinches away, shrinking in fear. there’s a long silence, during which draco stands and pockets his wand. dudley relaxes once more, although he doesn’t stop trembling. draco begins to stroll again, slowly. “dudley…. you know, you remind me of myself when i was younger. a bully. never having an original thought. doing whatever my parents told me to.”
it had taken a long time for draco to get used to the idea of andrew genuinely wanting him, and not to simply use as a punching bag. he had been heavily urged on by pansy and hermione, who encouraged the idea of draco
he doesn’t see harry. ron and hermione do, at least a handful of times. a week after hermione rescues him, she knocks on his bedroom door, clutching a shrunken box filled with his things. they don’t talk about harry to him, or around him. occasionally, they’ll have an argument about him, with hermione shouting and crying about how
as the floo settled following goyle’s departure, pansy, draco, and harry remained in silence, staring hard at each other.
he had done it to draco before. afterwards, draco hadn’t left the house for three days, because even the glamour charm couldn’t stop him from crying every few minutes.
they don’t talk much for the rest of the evening, but ron and hermione both stay through the night, moving from room to room and helping draco pack his things. they inevitably encounter things of harry’s - first, a old tattered sweater that draco holds to his face, inhaling deeply. harry’s familiar scent is gone, but the warmth lingers and provides draco with a semblance of comfort.
“harry’s here,” she choked, her eyes watering once more. “he’s - they found him at hogwarts and they’re trying to revive him but - i saw him, ron, he looks -” she gulped and blinked rapidly, willing herself not to burst into tears.
he’s already half hard - a result of draco’s lingering touches and vulgar words. however, he had no intentions of acting on his arousal. after all -
gives your case a second glance. you will die irrelevant, and be quickly forgotten, just as you should be. i’ll make sure that people know narcissa’s name, and that you killed her, and then yourself a week later out of guilt. but not before pledging a few million galleons to muggle-born charities. to atone for some of your sins, i think,” harry laughs to himself lightly, reveling in the genuine panic in lucius’ eyes. “maybe
” hurt, more so than anger, colors draco’s words as they leave his mouth. he knows that, to harry, he is acting selfishly and abandoning him, and the very idea makes draco’s stomach turn.
they stop arguing immediately, having the decency to look somewhat embarrassed as pansy glares at them both. from the living room, something shatters loudly - theo’s barking laughter following closely behind it.
“they wouldn’t be able to do it without you, weasley,” draco sighed, blushing a bit as he fully committed. his eyes caught on harry again, he was laughing jovially with a large man, who looked to be part giant. “you know this. just because you’re not drafting legislation doesn’t mean that you’re any less important. you’re the heart of the
“i was worried about you,” draco said into harry’s chest. he twisted his hands in his shirt, breathing slowly as he felt his anger begin to leave his body. more than anything, he had been worried - harry hadn’t answered his phone when draco had tried to call him, and he had apparated quickly from their doorstep. “please, don’t scare me like that anymore.”
“oh, even better! so you’re going to ignore him until he marries you. very realistic. flawless logic, draco. it’s a wonder you weren’t sorted into ravenclaw.” blaise relaxed back into his seat, smiling lazily at draco. he wasn’t even actually upset, the bastard, he just seemed to enjoy baiting draco.
“shit,” pansy swore suddenly, stopping in her tracks. she stepped off to the side, out of the flow of traffic. “i forgot to let blaise know we would be out today. you know how he is.” she pulled her purse out and began rustling through it, searching for her phone. draco follows her, moving out of the general rush and standing before a storefront, watching as she begins to presumably send a text to blaise.
“has there been any evidence aside from your dream?” theo asked, wandering back into the room. he wore one of harry’s robes, and it looked overly large on his small frame.
he had tried - tried to tell her about how harry hadn’t loved him, about the way he ahd strangled draco once that first night and then fell in love with the idea of hurting draco. about how he never fought back because he trusted harry wholeheartedly. about how he would’ve died if harry decided that it was what he needed to do. about how he had resigned himself to life and death at harry’s hands. about how there are still nights when that hugs his own thin body to keep himself from shaking too hard, about how he hates himself now more than he has ever, and about how he still, inexplicably, loves harry.
wrapping his arms around harry’s neck, draco quickly found a rhythm that worked for both him and harry. he rode harry’s cock slowly, picking up his weight before grinding down on harry with a slight circular motion to his hips. beneath him, harry’s eyes were screwed shut in pleasure, his mouth hanging open obscenely.
draco grins widely, obeying and scuttling off of harry’s lap to shake out of his pants. he jumps back onto the bed, before turning around and straddling harry’s chest. harry reaches for his wand, waving it silently and casting a cleaning charm. as the sting travels across his skin, draco hisses and pinches his thigh lightly.
the client had requested fifteen vials of calming draught - a potion draco had learned to brew in his fourth year. he had made dozens of batches throughout his years, what with his anxious tendencies and harry’s somewhat frequent panic attacks. draco added in the fluxweed oil, counting out 6 drops and ignoring the way his hand trembled as he fumbled with the dropper.
“have you thought any about possible wedding dates?” draco asked lightly. it had been on his mind over the last few weeks and now seemed like the best time to ask. he knew that they had agreed to wait, but the idea of planning his dream wedding alongside harry excited him, even if it was almost a year early.
draco bit his lip, staring resolutely out the window and forcing himself to stand still, lest he do something embarrassing, like throw himself into harry’s arms or burst into tears.
harry sighed heavily, blinking at draco but still not moving. for a moment, they engaged in a stare off - both men holding their ground until draco cocked an eyebrow and pursed his lips, tilting his head a bit.
“peppermint,” potter said again, holding it out to draco. draco stood stock still, glancing between potter’s outstretched hand and his face, with that broad grin still spread across his lips. this position so closely mimicked the one they had stood in all those years ago, except this time it was potter extending his hand to draco, the one offering friendship, or at the very least a truce. “do you want it or not?”
’s from the room. as they ate, draco was almost able to forget that he was at a ministry event, and not sitting in his own dining room, eating and listening to ron and harry make idiotic jokes while sharing amused looks with hermione from across the table. it was almost as if they were teenagers again - listening to hermione hiss at ron to not scarf his food down so quickly while harry guffawed behind his hand and ate it only a marginally more civilized manner. across the table, ginny had already polished off three glasses of wine and kept tapping the rim of her glass for a refill - her eyes were bright, her cheeks pink, and her smile mischievous. draco estimated that it would only take a few more drinks before she and luna began to twirl through the tables, effectively creating their own dance floor. with each course that appeared before them, the donation board steadily climbed, with hermione doing an excited dance in her seat each time another milestone was crossed. in between dessert and mignardise, draco penned a check for seven hundred and fifty galleons - when the contribution appeared on the board, she reached over and squeezed his arm, her eyes damp and smile brilliant.
“draco,” pansy says softly from beside him. her sharp nails dig into his thigh beneath the table. she’s the only one at this table who knows everything - who is fully aware of the fact that she is about to watch something terrible happen. draco pushes her hand away and shifts in his seat, angling his body towards potter. he crosses his ankles and sits up straight, knowing that he looks completely and totally punchable right now.
draco hums noncommittally, and pansy continues to blather. it’s obvious that he’s not really listening to her, but she continues to carry the decidedly one-side conversation as if he is. he appreciates this more than he can say. numbness still haunts him - seeping into every crevice of his being and slowing him down drastically. before, draco had been a firecracker. he did everything quickly and all at once - and found people who moved at a snails pace to be frustrating. now, it seemed as if all of the energy had been sapped from his body, simple conversations - an exchanging of pleasantries, or small talk seemed to drag on forever, and were laden with awkward silences. a week ago, his mother had asked him how he was holding up - he had stared at her silently, his lip quivering and his forehead creasing as he searched desperately for the words that always seemed to evade him nowadays.
“i was supposed to go flying with ron today,” harry mutters, dragging his socked foot back and kicking at the floor.
they sit in a comfortable silence, with harry dozing beside draco, drifting between consciousness and sleep. draco lies awake, staring out the window as he does.
he already knows the answer, but needs the confirmation, needs a small reminder of exactly why they’re here. harry nods jerkily and looks away - draco turns back to the cupboard, practically shaking with rage. it’s
“oh, i’ll show you what i think of you,” harry teases, dropping down to lie directly on top of draco. he bursts into loud laughter, his arms wrapping around harry’s neck and holding him close as he is quickly quieted with a kiss.
he finds draco in a nearby room - smaller than the others but just as extravagant. he assumes it had been narcissa’s dressing room, judging from the elegant looking women’s robes and intricate rose quartz wardrobe draco was sat in front of. he had a small mirror in hand and was gently running his finger along a design on the back. harry can see from the doorway that his hands are still shaking.
harry potter. my name carries a significant amount of weight in most social circles - more than yours does nowadays, at any rate. i know a few people over at the prophet and the quibbler… classmates, friends. i have a feeling that it’ll be up to myself and draco to pick the headline announcing your death. i’m thinking ‘
harry doesn’t hesitate to take draco into his arms, holding him close as he sobs wildly - large, gulping cries that rattled his entire body. “
“not bloody likely,” draco spat. “i’m limiting the amount of magic i use everyday so that his stores aren’t tampered with - but i’m a pureblood wizard… i’ve grown up around magic constantly, and both restricting myself and having him draw from my stores is exhausting, to say the least.”
when he can no longer delude himself, draco pulls away and gently lies harry in bed, resting his head on his pillow and throwing a blanket over his body, so that he looks almost as if he is simply asleep.
instead, he smiles weakly and does a slow scan of the room, drinking in the sight of those that he loves. he hopes that they won’t be sad - won’t grieve him the way that he had grieved harry all those years ago.
harry, who had reliably always come home by six pm, suddenly began to stumble through the door near midnight - reeking of alcohol and covered in his own sick.
“yes,” he says to no one - to his perpetually empty home. across the kitchen, the kettle whistles. “my answer is yes.”
all eyes in the room shifted to draco as the door burst open, including harry’s. his expression fluttered rapidly through relief, surprise, and excitement, before landing on simple joy. draco doesn’t remember moving, or seeing harry ever change positions, but suddenly they’re in each others arms - grappling at each other desperately.
“did you -” he starts, before faltering and looking down, as if he can’t bring himself to say the words. he had just told his father how much he hated him, but harry knew that deep down, draco still loved him, and probably always would. he understood it, this complicated relationship with the men they had looked up to all of their lives. true hatred simply wasn’t possible, not with the past being what it was.
harry took a breath and steeled himself, instantly schooling his face into a cool, authoritative mask. he pulled away from draco completely now, his fingers lingering on his waist for a split second before harry returned to the head of the table. he looked exponentially better than he had when draco had first arrived. now, he stood up straight and walked slowly before the aurors, speaking firmly as he finished relaying the details of his mission.
“can you come to st. mungo’s?” she asked breathily. immediately, draco’s heart began to race and his throat grew tight. “it’s harry.”
when, three hours later, his alarm charm alerts him that the potion is finished, he descends into the basement with a slight tremble in his hands. he feels for harry, quite strongly, but just a whiff of amortentia will make things much more serious. he removes the lid slowly and bends of the cauldron, wafting the slow spirals toward himself with his hand, and -
much smaller than he thought it would be, than it had sounded in harry’s descriptions. he reaches down and yanks it open, peering inside.
he wants potter to leave - to fuck off and allow him to feel all of this terrible anguish so that he can move on with his life and try to put himself back together. he wants potter to feel pain - to experience exactly what it is that he’s doing to draco. he wants him to die. because he hates harry potter. he regrets ever meeting him, ever saying a word to him, ever starting to actually like him, ever fucking him, and ever handing over his heart for potter to keep safe.
as harry searched the study - more fragments of draco and achilles decidedly one-sided conversation floated through the walls.
for now, he sets the phone aside and grabs his wine glass, taking a deep swig. his fingers tremble as he brings the joint to his lips again. a loud sob bursts from his lips, and he doesn’t bother trying to stop himself.
“i thought you were afraid of fire,” harry murmurs, leaning heavily into draco. he watches as draco fishes out a cigarette and lights it wordlessly before putting it to his lips and taking a heavy drag. harry hates when draco smokes - but decides against saying anything. he rests his head on his shoulder, inhaling the sickly sweet smoke, trapped inside of their small bubble.
“luna,” draco says softly, exhaling shakily. he wants to say more, wants to tell her that he loves her and appreciates her positivity, steadfast and constant even up until the last moment, but his breath escapes him as talking and breathing become more difficult.
“are you ready to go, harry?” pansy asked politely. this would be the last bit of friendliness between them for the remainder of the night. in front of her subordinates, harry was minister, and there would be no casual conversation between the two.
harry doesn’t move. doesn’t speak. doesn’t even acknowledge the conversation happening around him. he simply sits there, staring at draco, hating everything about him.
when harry doesn’t answer, draco sinks to floor on the steps, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. for a while, although draco isn’t sure if it’s five minutes or five hours, he stares blankly at the park across the street from harry’s house, his mind racing.
he sunk to the floor, still murmuring to himself, clutching the letter close to his chest, shaking and wailing and utterly falling apart, right there on the kitchen floor.
“your bloody scars, even the ones that i made on your skin, they’re all so mesmerizing. i know you hate them, but merlin they're beautiful - they’re magnificent. i still remember the way they feel, remember every single curve and arch. and your eyes, christ draco, your eyes. i’ve missed your eyes. all i wanted, all this time, was for you to look at me. the last time you looked at me you hated me so much, and it killed me because i don’t want you to hate me,”
flustered, hermione reached into her pocket and pulled out her ministry badge, flipping it open and pushing it towards the healer. she absolutely hated having to use her name or position to get what she wanted, but she was willing to put that aside for harry’s sake.
the bond had made their magic stronger, but would take up to a year to reach its fullest potential. until then, their magical stores were somewhat depleted, and it would be difficult for the both of them to attempt to harness large amounts of magic at the same time. so with harry off merlin-knows-where probably fighting for his life every few minutes, draco’s magic - and his emotions, and physical health - were a bit unstable.
at 5:56 pm, the floo roars, spitting out harry. his eyes rake over the scene quickly, before going back over for a second glance at everything. he took in the pile of lube on the floor, goyle’s statue impersonation, and draco and pansy, both with bloodshot eyes and curled together on the couch.
“yea,” he says softly, walking behind dudley. “it’s my biggest regret, ever being like that. i make up for it every single day. you know, i would kill that version of myself if i could. but i can’t, not really. so i suppose you’ll have to do.”
following the impromptu trip to france, they had returned home and quickly gotten wrapped up in the rush of their everyday lives once again. harry began spending hours volunteering with hermione for various organizations - sending out letters and going door to door and doing whatever he could to help, whether the cause be muggleborn integration or occamy preservation. draco continued working towards his potion mastery - spending hours hunched over textbooks and cauldrons - occasionally setting the room (or himself) on fire.
ron didn’t respond, and they settled into another comfortable silence - draco spared a glance at him and was pleased to find a warm grin playing on his lips.
,” draco whispers, pointing his wand at lucius with weak fingers. harry watches him - despite being damp with tears, draco’s eyes sparkle with passion. there’s no doubt that in this moment, he’s completely capable of bringing lucius to an end, forever. “i hate you, father,” he spits. but then, he drops his hand and turns away, hanging his head. “i can’t - i can’t be like him. i won’t be like him. harry, i - i can’t do this.”
“so says you,” draco said to her softly, reaching out and squeezing her hand. they left the bathroom together - moving through the open door and into the bedroom, where harry was still patting himself down, obviously running a mental checklist of the wards of the house and his own personal effects, much like during his days as an auror.
“draco, do you ever plan on fighting your own battles?” he sneers, “or do you always need potter to come to your defense and get you out of sticky situations? you are truly pathetic, nothing like -”
this is perhaps for the best - draco hadn’t realized exactly how traumatized he had been over the entire ordeal until after it was over. his eyes swam with tears each time he looked down at his wedding ring, still on his finger, even through all of this. he flinched when granger touched his shoulder, or when weasley spoke to loudly. he very rarely left the house, except for when hermione forced him into the garden for sunlight and fresh air because she felt he was getting too pale. he had nightmares - terrible ones about harry appearing through the floo and torturing granger and weasley for protecting draco, and then killing draco with his bare hands right in front of them. he dreamed about harry’s face, full of anger and hatred the last time draco had seen him. he always wakes with a start, often having screamed so loud that he accidentally shattered the silencing charm he casts on his room each night before bed. twice, weasley had burst into his room with his wand raised, prepared to fight off whatever had threated to attack draco, with granger hot on his heels. he had stood and fidgeted awkwardly when he was instead greeted with a sobbing and trembling draco, rubbing the back of his neck and blinking owlishly.
“fuck you,” draco shouts, sinking to the floor in front of his doorway. he knows that he looks like a child throwing a tantrum, but finds that he doesn’t care very much. “you’re a liar. you lied.”
harry snorts, and draco smiles faintly. he hadn’t had more than a glass of wine since that night - afraid of what being under the influence might reveal of him.
this made it easy - easy to tumble into bed with potter, to kiss and stroke him, to take him again and again and again. to spend long nights with him, and tell him secrets and fall asleep in his arms and to pretend like they were anything more than reformed arch-enemies, playing house and ignoring the past.
the darkness rushes up the shower walls, filling the entire room with black until there’s only draco - curled on the cold floor of the shower beneath a steaming stream of water. the blackness seems to flirt with the steam, twisting around each other and making familiar shapes.
“thank you,” he whispers again, running another gentle finger over the tattoo - over the permanent representation of harry, right at his side. just as he should be. the tattoo cannot hold him tight, or stroke his hair, or press gentle kisses to his neck in the pale light of an early morning - but draco can still close his eyes and press his hand to his side and pretend as if it does. and for now, until he can finally be reunited with his love - it will simply have to do.
the only thing more embarrassing than being vulnerable in front of granger would be being vulnerable in front of weasley.
when he finished his breakfast, he made easy work of finishing up the household chores. he charmed the dishes to do themselves, and polished the floors and carpets with a swipe of his wand - but decided to fold the laundry by hand. the charms always left terrible wrinkles in his clothes that seemed to be heavily resistant to ironing charms. once he had finished, and magicked the piles of clothing into their respective wardrobes, he set about watering all of their plants.
” comes andrew’s voice from the kitchen, already growing louder as he approaches. he does this everytime - sends draco to open the door and then appears behind him anyways, his curiosity getting the best of him each time. “draco? they must be important, to interrupt movie night!”
“having fun, are you?” draco asked, pulling away from harry’s cock once more. “it’s not there for you to just stare at.”
harry seemed to be attempting to write something, and was dragging his feet through the sand methodolically, staring down at the ground hard. he had already finished what looked like a large “i”, and jumped to another point in the sand before starting a curve. he hadn’t noticed draco yet, and seemed to be muttering to himself. as he finished a haphazard heart, he jumped again, starting on what was presumably a “u”.
“is that really what you think?” he asks, cocking an eyebrow. his throat burns, every part of him aches - but he continues. “your ignorance and your pride will be the death of you, petunia.”
“just you relax,” harry returned, sounding as if he was somewhere in the kitchen. privately, draco hoped that harry had decided to cook something. he tended to do all of the cooking and baking for the both of them, and delighted in trying out as many recipes as he could. draco, on the other hand, had no qualms about trying each of harry’s creations and providing him with constructive criticism, (which usually came in the form of kisses or other sexual favors.)
they had argued up until the very moment that the air around the can began to swirl, at which point harry wrapped an arm around a squirming draco’s waist and promptly vanished them to god-knows-where.
draco stumbled through the floo, his chest constricting painfully. he wanted nothing more than to cry out - but wouldn’t allow himself to until he was sure that what hermione was saying was true. his mind raced as he stood in the lift, his hands shaking.
“long neck on this one,” draco mutters, glancing over at harry. he pantomimes choking her, and for the first time all evening, harry laughs. it dies quickly when he looks over at dudley, who seems to be frozen in shock.
“i want you to pick,” he says steadily, raising his chin into the air and forcing his tears from his voice. “pick me… and yourself, and your family, and your friends.” he finally catches harry’s eye - green and silver meet - and he holds the contact, attempting to pour everything he feels into the glance. he tries to tell harry wordlessly how much he loves him, how much he cares, how badly he wants for him to get better, how desperately he craves the future together that they had once planned upstairs in their bed, pressed nose to nose and still drunk with new love. he tells harry that he wants to support him, and help him, and that he can only do so if harry himself decides to take the first step. he reaches into his pocket and fishes out the small green bag and throws it on the table. he ignores the pang in his chest when harry breaks eye contact with him, immediately fixating on the bag and it’s small white contents. “or pick this,” draco says quietly, gesturing to the bag. “because i’m not sticking around to watch you kill yourself, harry. i love you, so very much… but i can’t love you more than i love myself.”
changed. draco stares into his eyes - they’re clear, clearer than draco had seen them in a very long time. he looks healthy and fit, as if he started working out more, and perhaps doing yoga after draco had left. he’s clean shaven, and his hair is longer, brushing his neck attractively. his shoulders are relaxed - and the stark difference between the harry that stands before him and the harry he had seen last, the hard shoulders and back, is jarring. harry looks good, like the man draco fell in love with, all those years ago, and it pains him like nothing else.
“so not all the way then,” harry rolled his eyes, turning away and carefully folding his discarded clothing.
“and what do you keep me around for?” harry asked, tilting his head as draco continued to press kisses down the line of his jaw. “aside from my facial hair and wandless cleaning charms.”
the idea comes to him sporadically, itching at the back of his mind as he added the mandrake root into his cauldron. he has everything he needs - the rose thorns, the ashwinder eggs, and the bloody peppermint. he could just throw it all in a cauldron together, and no one would ever be any wiser. he scolds himself quietly, worrying over the possibilities of going through with this. he doesn’t know what scares him more: the idea of the results confirming his suspicions, or disproving them. he continues to mull it over as he stirs the pepper-up potion before setting it back on the burner to simmer for a bit.
her tears never stop - each sob a heartbreaking display of her agony. but she works through them consistently, even pausing occasionally to gently wipe at draco’s own tears. she pushes him through the floo, and deposits him on their sofa, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead.
instead, she wraps her hand around his wrist and begins dragging him towards the floo, shaking harder than ever.
as the sun set completely and darkness spread, draco stumbled back into the house, resolving to bring harry outside with him tomorrow - he had always loved watching the sunset almost as much as draco did.
“are you always this eloquent?” draco snorted, kissing harry’s finger as it dragged across his lips.
“no,” draco sits up, pulling his feet from harry’s lap and straitening his spine, signaling that this was a
draco gasps slightly, the same way he always does. nothing can ever prepare him to hear harry’s voice again - rich and full of life. each time, it feels as if he’s been drenched with a bucket of freezing water.
after a few long moments, during which draco fought back tears and reminded himself that it was just a dream, harry’s alarm charm went off, the same way that it did every morning. draco remained awake, his eyes shut tightly.
harry holds him through it all, keeping all of draco’s shattered pieces in one place, if only so that he can put them back together later.
so if he occasionally cried over a bowl of cereal on his couch before puking it up an hour later, he was bloody allowed to.
“what - what happened?” he asked, his voice shaking. he glanced at the closed door which apparently served as the only thing separating him from harry’s body. “hermione said that he was…”
harry sits on the floor beside draco, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him into his chest. draco’s surprised - but too wrapped up in his own grief to consider this much. instead, he continues to cry into harry's chest - loud, terrible noises that rip from his throat violently. as he cries, he pushes and punches at harry, actively fighting him but unwilling to let him go. harry remains strong, holding draco close and rubbing his back, as if draco hasn’t just destroyed nearly everything he holds dear. as if there’s anything else for him to go back to in the real world. no - instead, he holds him closer - as if they’re the only people left in the world.
as they kiss, one of draco’s hands trail down harry’s body - rubbing gentle patters on his hips and torso. as his fingers find harry’s once again erect cock, they wrap delicately around him - immediately beginning to stroke slowly. harry groans softly into draco’s mouth, thrusting shallowly into his fist, his eyes fluttering shut with pleasure.
harry was lying on the bed, with his eyes closed and his wild hair splayed across the pillow. he looked like he could be sleeping, except for the unnatural stillness of his chest.
they stand there for a few long moments, with harry trembling in draco’s arms and draco pressing gentle kisses to his shoulder. when harry pulls away, draco nods, murmuring about finishing his job. he transfigures dudley’s body back to normal, closing the wound in his throat and vanishing all of the blood on his body and on the ground. he seems to be sleeping, aside from his deathly pallor. draco levitates him simply into the backseat of the car, not bothering to play any games with the body. once he slams the door, he moves back across the street, and harry follows closely behind him. for a moment, they simply stand in silence, staring at the car.
“i’m sure you were, baby,” draco cooed, squeezing harry’s thigh gently. he leaned forward, grabbing harry’s mug and pushing it into his hand. the whipped cream had already begun melting into a lump. “drink.”
“i - i don’t know, i’ll check.” with one hand, draco began to fumble with the thong wrapped around the foot of the bird, and absently fed it a strip of bacon with the other.
“malfoy,” harry says softly. he doesn’t sound angry. he sounds sad, exhausted. everything that draco feels. yet, somehow, it isn’t bringing him to his knees. he's still able to hold draco upright while his entire world falls in around him.
“alright, let’s do it then,” harry says, sitting on the bed and folding his arms across his lap patiently.
“only til i was eleven,” harry says softly, as if draco is the one in need of comfort. “i moved upstairs then. after i started at hogwarts.”
from there, the night rapidly picks up speed. after a clearly suggestive head jerk from hermione, harry and draco begin circling the room as well, chatting up random ministry workers and ancient purebloods with vaults in gringotts almost the size of draco’s. the conversations are easy, and all follow the same formula. harry smiles politely and exchanges pleasantries, always making sure to include the person's name and something small he remembers. draco had taught him this trick early on in his career - asking after spouses, or kids, or pets, or initiatives is the easiest way to make someone feel important enough to be remembered by harry, thus making them more likely to open their coin purses and throw money at whatever cause harry was supporting. tonight, it was
once he had finished tending to his plants, draco fed and stroked the cat, also taking time to press gentle kisses to her furry head and asking her politely what she thought about the recent dip in the wizarding stock market. she didn’t respond, as expected, and so he moved on.
draco couldn’t recall having ever felt this happy, this full of euphoria ever in his life. just thinking about potter made his stomach flutter and his lips spread into a manic grin.
harry pulls out after a few long moments, his chest heaving as he attempts to catch his breath. beneath him, draco still pants softly, a thin sheen of sweat visible on his forehead. beneath his legs, draco’s cock was already hardening once more. reaching down, harry cupped draco’s balls in his palm, rolling them gently and savoring the way draco’s eyes rolled back into his head.
“can we stop with the pissing match and focus?” pansy groaned, “so, you had this dream last night. what did you say to harry this morning?”
they enter the lift, and draco pressed the button for hermione’s floor, before leaning against the railing and closing his eyes. his head is pounding, and he could feel his magic thrashing uncomfortably in his stomach. harry liked to compare draco’s magic to a dragon - powerful, fierce, and calm unless trifled with.
this is what he thinks about as ron springs from the couch, pulling a distraught hermione into his arms. “what’s wrong? what’s happened?” he looks rapidly between draco and hermione, looking only a bit more confused than he does on any given day. draco looks away, not trusting himself to not dissolve into tears completely.
“oh, merlin,” harry laughed, cocking an eyebrow and taking a small sip from his own snifter. “go on,”
he realizes that something is amiss as soon as he picks up the tin - almost triple the weight of what it should be even when completely full. he pulls it out slowly, his brow furrowing as he does so. when he gives the box a shake, he hears the loud thud of something inside, something that definitely isn’t a tea bag, and so he pulls the lid off, suddenly overwhelmingly curious.
as draco returned to the living room, he slumped onto the sofa, and fished out the cellphone hermione had made them all buy. he only had four contacts in it, and mostly used it to play muggle games - however he had recently figured out how to sext with harry, and frequently sent explicit paragraphs in the middle of the day, just to keep things interesting.
“yeah?” draco wants to look away, to turn and run screaming in the opposite direction, but he can’t. because here’s harry, mere inches away from draco’s face, with his lips parted and his hair messy and looking absolutely delicious. draco wants him, so badly, but he can’t -
this is what draco struggled with the most. he couldn’t understand why harry would continue doing something that he knew was bad for him, why he would risk ruining everything, his friendships, his relationship, his reputation - for a short high. he couldn’t understand it - and, frankly, didn’t want to.
and then potter had appeared again, with his hair wild and damp and looking practically edible, and he had leaned over draco and pressed their lips together, his hand coming to rest on draco’s cheek.
when he finally finished, he glanced around once more, before turning to catch draco’s eye again. instantaneously, his mask melted and his eyes grew fond, and draco’s heart swelled in his chest. when harry turned back to the table, the look was gone. a few of the aurors raised their hands, while others scribbled furiously in their notebooks and legal pads.
he pushes the thought away. he doesn’t want to confront this idea right now, and judging from the look of pity weasley is giving him, he’s about to have plenty of time to do some deep introspection and discuss the issues in his and harry’s relationship.
“you’ll be missing them by next week,” harry laughed, wrapping his hand around draco’s ankle and squeezing lightly.
draco’s fingers brushed something at the very bottom of his pocket - and he froze. the rest of the world turned to a vacuum - and suddenly, all he could hear and feel was the brush of his fingers against crinkling plastic, deep in his robe pocket. before he could stop himself, he grabbed at the plastic with his thumb and forefinger, slowly dragging out what he knew he would find.
“draco,” hermione said as a greeting, only glancing up slightly. “it’s nice to see you. and you too, jackson.”
finally, harry pulls out completely, prompting a panting draco to look up at him, his eyes wild with arousal.
draco pouts in response for a moment, before turning to harry with a devious grin. “not even if i ask politely?” he blinks at harry, wide eyed and innocent - although his hand trails over his thigh and towards his crotch.
“do you think that i could take these home?” draco asks, his voice still wavering. he gestures to the mirror in his hand, and an equally intricate comb and brush set on the vanity. he can still see a strand of blonde hair in the comb, and his heart squeezes for both draco and narcissa. “i know that i’ll probably be able to claim the property in my own name sometime soon, but these were my mothers and i don’t want to wait, and i -”
draco sat silently as luna and ginny talked quietly on the other side of the table. they seemed to be caught in a heated debate about what draco originally assumed was werewolf rights. however, he heard luna murmur something about the “lack of oxygen on the moon allowing an explosion to occur,” and quickly decided that it was best to not join the conversation. on his other side, ron sat quietly as well, his long fingers drumming against the table. draco followed his eye to the center of the room, where hermione worked another donor, her mouth curved into a genuine smile as she nodded enthusiastically. how she found any of these old bags interesting - draco didn’t know. he’d been raised pureblood and had been molded into the perfect host by the age of six, yet he still found himself bored to tears after any conversation with elder wizards much like the ones in attendance tonight. a few tables over, harry was entertaining a conversation draco could only assume was identical to the one he had already had with half of the attendees. at one point, harry and hermione met in the middle of the room, talking lowly for only a moment before approaching a surprisingly young couple together, both donning matching brilliant smiles. draco watched in silent amazement as the duo effectively charmed the pants off of the couple, and suppressed a smile as harry laid a gentle hand on the shoulder of the husband, who looked up at him with clear want.
draco doesn’t bother with quiet or stealth anymore - he flicks on lights and stomps up the stairs, hoping that they hear him coming, that he’s able to strike fear in their hearts as he approaches. he goes to the end of the hallway at the top of the stairs, recalling what harry had told him about the layout of the home, and kicks the door open, so forcefully that it hangs off of its hinge haphazardly.
they wake him for meals - bringing them to him on the couch until he’s strong enough to hobble over to their kitchen table and force himself to swallow whatever it is they’ve presented him. he wears ron’s old jumpers exclusively - too weak and afraid to suggest going back to his own home to retrieve some of his own clothing.
as draco continued to converse with the dog, harry stomped up the steps, still in pursuit of his glasses. he didn’t slam the door behind him. (well, he did. but only to check if his glasses were behind the door. they weren’t.)
“yes, i am.” draco says, sitting up as well. their stance is familiar - a throwback to their hogwarts days. “he’s wonderful, as a matter of fact. he helps me alot with my anxiety attacks and nightmares.”
“it’s a peppermint,” he chokes, finally looking up at pansy. his face crumbles as he gestures with his cupped palm. “it’s - this is a peppermint,”
bottle green met electric grey - and for a few long moments they did nothing more than stare, drinking in the sight of each other. harry made the first move, cupping draco’s face with his own hands and bringing their lips together in a sweet kiss.
at this, harry laughs and pulls draco’s hands from his face, pressing gentle kisses to his palms and fingers. “that won’t be necessary, i hope,” he says with a smile.
harry winces, but nods. “but not to you. never to you. everything was real, draco. i told you i loved you, and you didn’t say anything back, i panicked and -”
draco fished out the box containing the chamomile leaves, sighing deeply when he shook the box and found it much lighter than it should’ve been. he doesn’t bother opening it - instead slamming it on the counter and shutting his eyes tight. he doesn’t want to have to touch the box - this box that had belonged to harry only. he wants to let it sit, and gather dust for years, a small relic of their life together before the fates had torn them apart. but his head aches, and the possible comfort and familiarity that the peppermint tea may bring him lures him back into the cabinet, reaching for the pale green tin.
“well,” draco thought about how he had fallen asleep in harry’s arms the night before, of how harry sometimes floo’ed home during his lunch to spend it with draco, of how he had taken draco to italy for a weekend last month at the spur of the moment, and proceeded to fuck his brains out over the balcony, all the while showering draco with praise and adoration. “no. but maybe i’m a Seer.”
the knock sounds from the front door just as draco prepares to descend the stairs into his lab. he freezes, furrowing his eyebrows. any wizard would have simply used the floo, and harry didn’t have any muggle neighbors who might’ve come knocking. he strides to the door quickly, not bothering to peek out of the window as he pulls it open. standing there on the porch, looking distinctly out of place, was kingsley shacklebolt and gawain robards, their mouths pressed into identical grim lines.
harry shrugs and leans the rest of the way in, catching draco’s lips in a sweet kiss. it is, as all of their kisses tend to be, earth shattering. for a few long moments, the rest of the world disappears, and it is only them, in this car, pressed together over the console. draco places his palm on harry’s cheek gently, lapping at his bottom lip in an effort to increase the pressure - but their bubble shatters as belligerent spluttering sounds from the backseat. vernon, having seemingly recovered from shock, was practically purple in the face with rage and disgust.
theodore surely isn’t ugly - with his sharp jaw and brown hair and pale green eyes, he even somewhat favors -
“are you sure?” draco says softly, moving forward to stand behind harry. he lays a hand on harry’s shoulder, feeling the tense knot just beneath the skin. “you can stay here if you’d like. i know the address, i can go alone.”
“what is it?” harry asked, sitting up and looking over at draco. “you’re more irritated than usual.”
instead, draco has a scrap of paper and an empty bed and an engagement ring with no fiance. there is no one to propose, to drop to their knees and make grandiose declarations of love.
harry continued to apologize profusely, rubbing draco’s body and pressing gentle kisses to his temple again and again.
draco’s crying now, fast, hot tears that streak down his cheeks with a vengeance. he doesn’t bother reaching up to wipe them away, because harry is crying too, choking on sobs as he fumbles with words, spitting them out rapidly, as if he’ll forget them, or never get another chance to say them if he doesn’t do it right now. and who knows - maybe he won’t.
“you love me,” harry finishes, a stupid grin spreading across his face. draco can’t decide if he wants to collapse with relief or kiss him. “you love me?”
“oh,” she chortled, leaning forward conspiratorially. “i myself was a hufflepuff, but i had a… male friend who was a gryffindor. you can imagine i spent a fair bit of time up in the towers myself. that was ages ago, and long before i met dear old richard, as i’m sure you can tell,”
“don’t you ever worry about this kind of stuff?” pansy asked, sounding just a bit petulant. “harry cheating on you… or finding someone else? what with him being the darling of the wizarding world and all that - i can’t imagine how much attention he must get... how do you handle that?”
he opens his mouth to say a final goodbye, but becomes choked up as he tries. instead, he smiles sadly and nods at both of his parents, taking a deep breath before grabbing a handful of floo powder and throwing it into the fireplace. his voice wavers as he chokes out his address and steps into the flames, turning to drink in the sight of his parents, leaning into each other and supporting each other.
“i think it would make you feel better to talk about it,” she says one morning, folding her hands in front of her on the table. draco had come down from his room for a mug of tea and a slice of toast, but was quickly regretting it. it wasn’t as if he didn’t talk to granger and weasley at all - the topic of conversation just usually revolved around asinine and mundane things, like the weather or a book draco was reading, not about the methods their best friend and draco’s husband had used to beat the shit out of him. “do you think so?”
the fight afterward had been brutal - their first since harry had proposed. they had both screamed until their voices were hoarse: draco, about the importance of healing, and harry about his desire to “just be left the fuck alone.” that night, harry had slept on the couch - partly out of spite and partly because draco had charmed their bedroom door shut behind him after he had slammed it following an hour of bellowing.
“everyone, we have an announcement,'' potter says, catching everyone’s attention, and draco's stomach turns. somehow, he already knows what's coming, and he knows that hearing it will kill him. “ginny and i -”
“i’m glad you’re feeling better, harry,” draco says softly, and harry immediately smiles. that bright, earth-shattering smile, the very same one that has made draco fall so many fucking times. his throat squeezes shut, tight. he has to force himself to open his mouth - to finish his sentence and not run into harry’s arms and kiss him, forgive him of everything and absolve him of his sins, of the abuse. “please don’t come here again.”
“what color were they?” draco asked, reaching across the table and grabbing harry’s long abandoned drink. he took a deep pull, savoring the fruity taste.
draco tuned back into the conversation, and realized belatedly that he had probably missed something important. the man seemed to be still speaking, gesticulating in a manner that reminded draco of an excited ron weasley. after a while, he slowed down, took a deep breath, and relaxed back into his seat.
“no!” harry had insisted, pulling a flattened aluminum can out of his pocket. “we’re going on a trip! this is our portkey!”
he searched for jobs tirelessly, becoming more and more discouraged with each gentle frown and sad nod. he was horribly underqualified, after all, what with not finishing his schooling and having never worked a job to date. harry hadn’t seen a need for him to work, when he could instead spend all day cooking and cleaning and fretting over harry’s next bout of anger.
the worst part of all of this were the pauses in between each sentence, as if achilles was actually responding in a language only draco could hear or understand. a spike of anger rose in harry’s stomach at both his boyfriend and the dog - draco had never written a song for him.
when they had gotten bored of stacking the lube bottles in pyramids, they return to the couch, arranging themselves in a tangle reminiscent of their days in the slytherin common room. when blaise pulls out a small baggie of gillyweed, they cheer happily. after more than a few attempts at rolling a presentable joint - draco lights it with the tip of his wand.
“good morning, baby” he murmured into draco’s shoulder. unwittingly, draco flinched, knocking the sharp line of his joint into harry’s lip.
“no, probably not.” harry murmurs, straightening up and pulling on his robes. every time he was caught in public with crumpled or disorganized robes, an article appeared in a gossip rag, speculating about whether his relationship with draco was disintegrating and if he was or was not sleeping on the couch in his office - which he had only done once before, anyways. behind them, pansy landed gracefully, a low whistle escaping her lips.
as they make the slow trek back to their room, harry becomes increasingly frustrated with draco. while they had danced, draco had clung to harry in a manner that had been sexy and exciting - now, it was glaringly obvious that he simply wasn’t able to stand up on his own.
their marriage is easier than they thought it would be. when they had announced their engagement, they had heard from so many couples that marriage was a struggle, and that they would have to actively fight to stay in love. so far, they had yet to see exactly what everyone was talking about. even on the days that the fought and swore at each other, there was never a question of where they stood with each other. no matter what, they promised to continue coming back to each other. and with a love like their own, coming home was the easiest thing.
he reaches for his wine glass, taking a small sip and savoring the taste. when he goes to place the glass back on the table, his fingers brush the smooth curve. of his wand. he glances at it - hesitating for a moment before wrapping his fingers around it and picking it up.
draco doesn’t feel any specific way about nott - he can see that he’s attractive, but also that the man seems to be hopelessly in love with longbottom. however, draco cannot seem to bring himself to be concerned with the entanglements of other gryffindors and slytherins, seeing as his own is currently crashing and burning before his very eyes. draco laughs softly as theodore makes a snipe about pansy’s smudged makeup, closing his eyes and inhaling his scent deeply.
without much preamble, harry poured a generous helping of lube onto his fingers and reached behind draco, tracing his hole for a few moments before pushing in. they had just fucked last night - so draco was already a little stretched, which made preparing him that much easier. harry spread the remainder of the lubricant over his cock, a soft moan escaping his lips as he did so.
with harry away on his mission, groceries were lasting much longer, and draco found himself eating less and less. he wasn’t depressed, per se, but their marriage bond was only a few months old, and they had never been away from each other for this long. the three weeks they had been separate had been… hard, to say the least. during the first few days he had barely been able to get out of bed, and cast anything stronger than a weak lumos.
“well, that’s besides the point,” draco says, draining his glass. he looks over at harry, blinking slowly. “harry?”
“apparently,” draco grits out, blushing terribly. “of course, i shouldn’t need a potion to tell me this. the feelings are there. have been for quite some time, i suppose. and i can’t deny them, or downplay them any longer, because… i made the potion, and it smelled like peppermints.” he finishes weakly, suddenly needing a nap, and a pepper-up potion for himself. he can’t bring himself to look harry in the eye, so he looks at his shoulder instead. it’s quite broad and nicely defined in harry’s auror robes. he would quite like to kiss the skin beneath it sometime soon.
“what don’t i understand, draco?” harry asks, taking another sip and trying not to smile into his glass.
“is he okay?” draco asked, flicking off the stove. he could feel hysteria rising in his chest, but fought steadily to maintain his composure. “what’s happened?”
“should i order another round?” hermione asked, finishing off her glass of red wine. true to her character, she had been nursing the same glass for nearly the entire time, while everyone else had lapped her at least three times.
“bugger,” he murmured to himself, standing and wiping his hands on his trousers. his stomach grumbled loudly, and draco remembered that he hadn’t eaten since breakfast. as he made his way into the kitchen, he began to muse over what to prepare. perhaps a steak and kidney pie - one of harry’s favorites.
she purred softly in response before returning to her grooming, and draco left the kitchen, humming quietly to himself. he goes to call for harry once more, but decides against it. surprising him would be much more gratifying. at the beginning of their relationship, harry had constantly regarded draco with a soft of open-mouthed awe that never failed to make him blush - his eyes twinkling and his lips curled into a wide grin that showed off the whiteness of his teeth. as time had gone on, harry had evidently grown used to whatever it was about draco that had previously enthralled him.
“i bed to differ.” draco spat, the pitch of his voice rising. he looked an uncomfortable mixture of constipation and fear, and in any other circumstance harry would’ve laughed.
, because he knew that draco wouldn’t do anything about it. this is harry - the reason why he had spent months holed up in ron and hermione’s guest bedroom, trembling with fear and debilitating anxiety. the reason why he had hardly been able to stomach anything of substance without running to the bathroom to be sick, or to break down into tears.
“are you still upset?” draco asked quietly, cringing at how pathetic he sounds as it comes out of his mouth.
harry didn’t feel the same way, as draco was sure he wouldn’t. he had been a fling, something fun for harry to do over the last few months, a body to keep his bed warm on the colder, lonlier nights. would he laugh in draco’s face at this confession? would he tell his auror friends over drinks at the pub tomorrow night - starting the anecdote with a ‘
tonights dinner was mostly silent and prolonged. draco complimented the food politely, despite not being able to taste anything. his mother continuously smiled nervously over at him, her eyes shining with unshed tears. the meals closely resembled the ones they had had when he was younger and living at the manor - unremarkable and seemingly blissfully unaware of what was to come.
“no.” draco said firmly. he downed the remaining wine in his glass before slamming it back on the counter. “i’m not doing this. i told you, potter. no dogs.”
“h.a potter, sir,” thalia said, her cheeks flushed a light pink. “if you’d like to step out, i can finish the debriefing.”
the next night, they pass through the floo to malfoy manor - draco, with his face set in a grim, determined line. harry, supportive and equally determined, followed close behind him.
he had been feeling the customary sadness since the moment he had learned the truth of harry’s demise - an aching feeling in his heart that felt so deeply set, so stubborn that he feared he would never again experience life without the ever-present melancholy streak that he had developed. sadness had taken to following him like a ghost - turning everything he touched cold and blue.
as they gossipped, harry remained quiet at draco’s side, sipping slowly from his glass and occasionally glancing at the staircase with barely concealed longing in his eyes. when they settle into another silence, draco takes the initiative.
a fair few party-goers attempt to connect with harry as they leave, to reach out and touch and speak with him, but the auror detail quickly closes rank around them. draco doesn’t bother with discretion as they leave - he openly grasps harry’s hand and leans into him as they make the trek to the floo, appreciating harry’s warmth beside him and the familiar weight of his husbands body.
with that, he pulls away from draco, standing at the edge of the bed and watching with heavy eyes. draco scrambles onto all fours quickly - the expression in his eyes has captivated draco, and he wants nothing more than to obey every order harry’s gives him.
“yes!” draco shouts, unnecessarily loud. he drapes his arm around leans forward, a sloppy grin on his face. “yes.” he repeats, lower this time.
“hmm, you pretty much named everything,” draco murmured into harry’s neck. he pulled harry’s mug from his hand and placed it on the coffee table next to his own - they could finish their drinks later. “although there is one other thing.”
in the ensuite bathroom, draco puzzled over a significant cologne collection, his finger dragging through the air as he tutted softly under his breath. after a few moments of deliberation, he decided on the same one that he always did - a chypre fragrance that harry had given him as a valentine’s day gift years ago that he had fallen in love with and subsequently requested a replacement of each year. he stared at himself in the mirror for a few long moments, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips. he looked good - it was simply a fact.
he slept in pansy’s bed with her for another month, before she had begun urging him politely to begin looking for other arrangements - ones that included a steady job and his own place to stay.
as the words leave his mouth, draco scans their faces once more, feeling his heart begin to descend as his brain connects the puzzle pieces. there are important ministry men - there’s no reason for them to be standing on the porch of his and harry’s home… unless -
“i’m trying, draco,” harry slurs quietly, his head growing heavy where it rests on draco’s shoulder. his lips brush gently against the crook of draco’s neck, his warm breath ghosting across draco’s skin. even after harry has been rendered fully unconscious, draco continues to hold him, whimpering pathetically into his shoulder, his hands gripping at harry’s shirt and wishing desperately for a time turner, for the ability to return to the start of this all, to stop harry from being approached by that witch in diagon alley, over two years ago. as harry sleeps, draco strokes his hair, closing his eyes and pretending that they are in the before, that things haven’t changed between them drastically. he pretends that they still dance in the kitchen, and sing along to old music on harry’s stereo, and go out for spontaneous dates, and laugh together, and lean into each other and have silent conversations, comprised entirely of gentle touches and long looks. he pretends as if the man he holds, the man he loves, is unchanged, isn’t an apparition of who he had once been. he pretends that he and harry and curled in bed together after a long day, talking about their jobs and their future together and their hopes and dreams and fears. he pretends that harry is not passed out in his arms, his head clouded with drugs that he had been lying to draco about having. he keeps his eyes closed, and he pretends.
“like being snowed in with you,” harry says quietly. he reaches down, grabbing at draco’s fingers and bringing them up to his face. he presses a gentle kiss to the ring - he likes doing this. it serves as a reminder of the promise that he made - the one he can’t wait to keep.
“yes,” harry says, with a jerky nod. he reaches over and takes draco’s hand, gripping it firmly. “i’m ready.”
he and harry had been arguing - or, more appropriately, harry had been roaring at draco and draco had been sobbing pathetically as harry berated him, truly cruel words rolling off of his tongue incessantly.
, a testament to their relationship, and their comfortability. he pulled away from this kiss as well, and then simply rested his head in the curve of draco’s neck, inhaling his scent silently and appreciating the feeling of having him close.
“oh, thank you, harry,” she says quickly, running her hands down her front. she grins at both of them, her eyes scanning over draco’s robes. “and you two - amazing, as per usual. are those new robes, draco?” he nods, but not before she continues, her eyes wide as she spins to gesture to the steadily growing crowd. “isn’t this just amazing? of course, i sent out invitations, but i would’ve never expected so many guests to actually show! and the guest list - oh, merlin and morgana both - some of the most renowned magi-zoologists and magical creature activists are here tonight… imagine the conversation, the opportunity! and not the mention the donations we’re sure to bring in - if everyone gives a bit, we’ll be able to fund the production of wolfsbane for at least five years, and possibly finish the st. mungo’s ward for half-humans!” she pauses to take a breath, grinning wildly.  harry places a hand on her shoulder, smiling genuinely. his eyes are warm and soft - it’s a look reserved only for family and friends.
he ends the call with a click - sending the message flying off to harry’s phone. It’s somewhere in draco’s closet - buried in a bag and purposely tucked away. tomorrow, he’ll call the service provider and shut the line off  - severing one of his last connections to harry.
- luna had played a surprisingly large part in the organization of hermione’s initiative, and was apparently very intelligent when she wasn’t discussing things of questionable existence. ginny was here as her date, as were ron and draco. it had been harry’s heavily broadcasted push for magical creature equality, under hermione’s guidance, that had started his political career and legitimized
“you have to.” she says, throwing the floo powder down. she whispers her address, although the roar of the floo firing up is loud enough to alert harry in the kitchen.
“no,” harry murmurs. reaching across, he takes draco’s chin is his hands, running a clean finger across his lip. not breaking eye contact, draco runs his tongue across the tip of harry’s finger. in his pants, harry feel his cock twitch with interest. draco and his damn mouth always seemed to have that effect on him.
it was in this bakery that draco met andrew, two years later - tall, dark, handsome, and with a thrilling crooked smile. he was a lawyer, although incredibly soft-spoken, and always ordered the same croissant and latte, before sitting at the small corner table with his muggle laptop and typing away for a few hours every week.
when draco came, he buried his face in harry’s neck - loud sobs racking his body. still trapped between them, his cock spilled over both of their fronts, staining their shirts and dracos thighs. harry came soon after - sent over by the sensation of draco’s hole pulsing around him as he came down from his own orgasm. he came deep inside of draco, filing his hole with a mixture of his come and lube.
draco moans under his breath, his eyes fluttering shut as he sighs happily into harry’s shoulder. “oh,” he murmurs, standing upright and looking over at harry with a warm grin. “we must get away to paris, and soon. i miss it dearly.”
hurting you.” draco threatens. harry opens his mouth to retort, but draco silences him with a look. “i know that you think that you’re invincible because that tosser voldemort couldn’t kill you despite his best efforts, but you are still human, and therefore vulnerable to hypothermia and injuries sustained from falling off of your fucking broom because you tried to fly in less than optimal conditions.”
“you’re a gem, pans.” draco says softly, his heart filling with affection for his dearest friend. “no, he didn’t. we’re okay.”
harry stares out the window as they go, resting his chin in the palm of his hand and taking in th endless miles of grass and field that they pass. draco finds himself frequently looking over at harry, admirming the line of his jaw, the stormy look in his eyes. he’s beautiful - the most beautiful man draco has ever seen, and he’d do anything for him.
“i’ve been thinking about getting one of those muggle telephone devices... many of the older families have started using them. i’ve heard great things from celeste zabini.” narcissa sniffed into draco’s shoulder. he marvels silently at the idea of his mother attempting to use a cell phone - but appreciates the sentiment nonetheless.
“So you thought you’d come in here and make sure I suffer along with you?” Draco replies, rubbing the sand from his eyes with his fist.
Draco closes the wards with a twirl of his wand and goes about tidying the mess. He’s pleased with himself, not only because he made proper bank on Potter, but because he feels he‘s accomplished something. Perhaps Draco ought to commit more random acts of charity, if they all go this well. Is that why Potter sinks all his time into some little organisation to help people he doesn’t know? Because if Potter goes home every day feeling as pleased as Draco will this evening, well, maybe he’s onto something.
Pansy’s little black book was a veritable treasure trove of models, pop stars, and socialites, whom she entertained on rotation. Attempting a conversation with any of them left something to be desired, but Draco thought he could endure for one night.
Draco hesitated. He didn’t have a proper answer for that. They weren’t friends, and they weren’t really lovers. They fucked, but that was all. It was a mutual need for release with another willing body. Nothing more.
Potter frowned. "They already failed to get into your supply. So they must have known where to look. What's the other place to carry it?"
"Are you going to tell me where we're going first?" Draco asked as he looked warily at Potter's outstretched hand, his stomach twisting.
Harry huffed, but drank his tequila with barely a shudder and held out his hand. “All right. Let’s get this over with.”
Draco was a wreck when Dominique at the front desk buzzed at a quarter to four, indicating the arrival of a visitor given access to the lift. He frowned. Usually, Harry just waltzed right in – probably flashing his badge, his scar, and that charmingly lopsided smile – but he didn’t have time to dwell on it before the numbers above the lift ticked up and up.
Draco let those motivations drive him through the long hours of surgery that morning. By the time they finished, both Draco and Marcus were balancing on pins and needles, their fingers cramped and their heads aching.
Draco hated shopping for a suit off the rack, but there wasn’t time to go bespoke, and with the help of a proper tailor, it would be more than passable.
"Twenty percent of your revenue. I will cover the costs of rent for the first twelve months and offer a stipend with which to purchase supplies. Any additional costs will require negotiation or outside funding. But it is my firm belief that this venture will make all of us very rich men."
Pansy, to her credit, didn't even flinch, just continued to card fingers through Draco's hair. "And you told him that? He doesn't love you back? That's why you've split?"
Pansy looked unconvinced and Draco could admit that his excuse was rather weak. The way his fingers shook around the cigarette he still clutched wasn’t helping, either. But Pansy nodded, the uncharacteristic worry line between her brows deepening.
Harry was speaking, though Draco could hardly understand his words, lost in the sensation as he was.
Harry turned his head so they were practically nose to nose. He was smiling and it was painfully sweet and yeah, Draco definitely fucking loved him.
"How long will they be out?" Potter asked, still staring at the hole in the wall, where purple smoke pressed against Draco's barrier.
At last, Harry lifts his head and glances down at the stripes across his chest and shirt. He frowns.
The crowd absolutely exploded. Draco could hear the shouting, the pop of a dozen flashbulbs, the scrape of chairs against the floor as everyone got to their feet. But Harry kept speaking, his voice raised so he could be heard, though he did not shout.
Draco was dragged from a very pleasant dream involving soft lips and firm muscles into the even more tantalising vision of Potter’s lips moving down his chest, and a hand on his cock. Draco groaned, rolling his hips into Potter’s fist, already hard and aching.
“I hope we can still be friends,” Theo says, and while Draco still isn’t quite sure he has ever considered Theo a
One of Pansy’s greasy attachés reappeared, a frosty martini glass in each hand. Pansy took them both, sniffed, then glared at him. “You’re joking, right? What is this swill? Try again!”
. He wanted Potter naked, wanted to count the scars on his body and run their jagged lines with his tongue. He intended to take Potter apart, but more than anything, he wanted Potter to
It wasn’t that Potter was unfriendly to those around him. He waved back to anyone that acknowledged him with something more than blatant gawping. He even offered a hearty hello and a friendly handshake to the head of Magical Sports and Games.
Potter shrugged his shoulders, eyes fixed on Draco. "Well, not all of it. Just some of it. I don't know. It might be nice."
Draco scoffed and took another drag, simply for a reason to lean away. "Don't be ridiculous. I haven't any more secrets than anyone else."
“Oh!” Pansy gasps. One hand flies to her mouth, and she looks to Draco, who is trying very hard to continue breathing and blinking normally.
Now Draco doesn’t just want to hex Harry, he wants to hit him. Draco’s hands ball into fists and he’s ready to step back and swing, but Harry’s faster, he’s always fucking faster. Harry has Draco by the wrist again as he lunges forward, sending Draco stumbling back a step. Harry goes with him, sweeping a foot behind Draco’s ankles and for one horrible second, Draco is flailing in mid air, certain he’s about to land on his arse on the floor, but before he can even throw out a hand, he’s sprawling backwards over the bed. Harry clambers atop him and pins both Draco’s wrists over his head, knees on either side of Draco’s ribcage. Draco tries to move, tries to twist and yank away, but Harry just holds him tighter, pressing his wrists harder into the mattress.
Draco has to work around the mobile in Blaise’s hand as he helps him slip into the jacket. He smooths a hand across the seams in the shoulders, which fit perfectly. He casts a couple of minor tailoring charms because Blaise is craning his neck to make himself appear taller and it’s throwing off the hemline. Then, Draco summons the pair of trousers he is still working on.
"More information from your 'source’?" Draco asked, unable to look Potter directly in the eye for another second. Not with that familiar expression on Potter's face, the one that meant he was ready to do something dangerous, something stupid — something typically
Draco's laugh settled into a pleased hum. He removed himself from Harry's lap and collapsed next to him. He curled around Harry's side, one arm thrown over his chest. It felt surprisingly good. Harry didn't usually like to cuddle after sex, but this felt different. Draco's body next to his own was solid and comforting.
Draco kissed him as Potter writhed beneath him, fingers pressing bruises into his scapulae, cutting marks into the planes of his back with blunt nails. Draco braced a hand on either side of Potter’s head, creating a space between their chests and allowing him the leverage to grind down against Potter’s hips. Potter moaned into the kiss, chest vibrating like a purr.
Draco loved Harry’s motorbike because he thought that just maybe, if Harry drove fast enough, and Draco held on tight enough, no one could catch them. Like right now, as they sped down the country lane and the Manor grew smaller and smaller behind them. And maybe Harry felt the same because with a twist of the throttle, they sped up, the air barely catching beneath the tires.
Draco takes the paper from him, then smiles, recognising the address of Pansy’s Kensington flat. “In and out.”
“He is. Has a meeting in ten, but…” She pokes at the keyboard of her computer. “Would you look at that? It just got bumped to two o'clock. He’s all yours.”
Potter waved a hand carelessly and dismissed the fortress of wards he kept up at all times. Draco suppressed a shiver and adjusted himself in his trousers. Potter's cavalier use of wandless, wordless magic always had that effect on Draco.
Draco still didn't quite have the hang of the mobile, but he practised his typing by texting back and forth with Emile and Lilian, until Emile began sending him raunchy photos 'by accident', and Lilian told him that he was no longer allowed to text her orders from the back room.
“What do you think of this?” Pansy calls from behind the curtain, before emerging with a flourish, wrapped in a skin-tight Dior gown.
It was fine, so long as Draco kept his eyes open and his mind preoccupied. Because the nights were still the hardest. During the day, Draco could tuck all the thoughts and insipid daydreams of Harry into a box and shove it into a dusty corner of his mind. But at night, that box, with its rusty hinges, would creak open, and those memories came crawling out on their hands and knees. They weren't always nightmares either. Sometimes, they tortured Draco with their sweetness. Draco was forced to suffer the recollection of the tightness of Harry's arms around his waist, the press of his lips against his neck, the rumble of his laugh.
Draco found the French press still steaming beneath a stasis charm. Beside it was a chipped orange mug with a Chudley Cannons emblem waiting for him on the counter and a note that said Potter was out feeding his monsters and would return shortly.
of bed, but yes. Perhaps. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest.” It wasn’t. At all. Draco remembered the conversation perfectly. But Harry didn’t need to know that.
Draco watches from his chair at an empty table that seats eight as Blaise’s date bores of his drawn-out conversation with some stodgy old men (who Draco is sure are members of the Swedish royal family) and floats way to flirt with the bartender, who is much closer to her age. Pansy, the clever bitch that she is, sees her opportunity and inserts herself at Blaise’s side. Draco smiles with proud satisfaction as she charms the pants off the old bastards while Blaise looks on with pleasure and awe, neither of which have anything to do with how high the slit in her dress runs or the way she fills out her top. Draco is happy for her.
"You are a cruel man, Harry Potter. But yes, for you, I'll beg." Draco's lips twitched, a ghost of a sly smile playing at the corners of his mouth. It made heat pool in Harry's gut and he licked his lips, watching as Draco's eyes darkened and followed the movement of his tongue.
Harry’s hand drops away. The warmth of his body against Draco’s side is suddenly gone, leaving him chilled. The mattress shifts as Harry gets to his feet. There is the sound of footsteps on hardwood as Harry collects his clothes from the floor. “I’ll go, I guess? If you want me to?”
Draco was already pulling out a fresh sheet of parchment when he noticed Lilian was still standing there.
“I’d like to think I’m a little more evasive than that,” Draco said, clutching his chest in mock offense as he followed Blaise to the living room, sipping his martini, which was delightful and exactly what he needed after a night in a cell at the DMLE. Thank Merlin he was crack with a cleaning charm because there was no way he was going to show up at Blaise’s front door with a blood-stained shirt and smelling of sweat and the over-brewed excuse for coffee all the Aurors drank.
Draco was beautifully responsive. Harry could feel the heat rise from his skin as it flushed beneath Harry’s hands. He was never still, twisting the sheets between long fingers and rocking just slightly, seeking purchase or friction or relief, of which Harry would give him none.
Draco hummed, unconvinced, and reached for his wand to dim the lights. Just then, Potter’s hand darted out and wrapped around Draco’s forearm. He tugged it to his face, his nose skimming the sensitive place at the inside of Draco’s wrist. Draco’s fingers twitched involuntarily, and he felt Potter grin against his skin.
By the fifth day, Draco was so bloody exhausted he could hardly stand. He didn't mean to fall asleep in that stupid plastic folding chair that held vigil next to Harry's bed, waiting for whoever turn it was to hold his hand. Draco didn't sit there unless he could be certain there were no Weasleys lurking, but that afternoon, Draco got lucky when Weasley took his wife to get lunch, and the rest of them weren't expected until the evening.
“And thank Merlin for that, or I’d be looking at a photo of you in tatty trainers and a jumper giving a thumbs-up instead of
Theo raises one eyebrow and casts another appreciative glance at Potter, and Draco thinks it really is a pity Potter isn’t gay. The two of them look quite nice together, with their dark hair and bright eyes. Daphne, on the other hand, may be a bit demure for Potter, but she is suitable for a formal party date. If Potter doesn’t muck it up first with his drinking and eye-rolling.
?" Weasley finished, and Draco scowled rather than nodded. "No, you just spent most nights together, shared all your meals, listened to the wireless on the sofa, went out clubbing or whatever. Doesn't sound at all like dating." Weasley pushed back from the railing to lean into his right hip, facing Draco. "Gods, Malfoy. You can't possibly be that thick. 'Mione and Harry seem to think you're clever."
“Your wife?” Draco looked at the man next to him, grimacing when discovered him mere inches from Draco’s face. He was vaguely familiar, and Draco supposed he must have been the groom. He hadn’t bothered to notice anyone at the altar aside from Harry. There was just no competition. “Oh, you’re Mr Weaslette. Congratulations.”
He'd turned the conversation over in his head approximately five hundred times, and each time he shied away from the truth he feared, which was as undesirable as it was absurd. And it was that Hermione
He tightened his grip around Harry’s waist as the fluttering in his gut grew wings. It wasn’t caused by fear, however. In fact, Draco had never been less afraid in his whole life. There was something about existing in Harry’s orbit, the way the magic wove its way around him and enveloped Draco. It made Draco feel like he, too, might be invincible, just like Harry. That death couldn’t reach him here, at Harry’s back.
Harry would have sworn he felt the temperature in the room raise five degrees. Malfoy’s licked his lips, his eyes darkening to a stormy gray.
Draco chuckled to himself as he stirred enough milk and sugar into his tea to turn it white and tossed the single spoon into the sink. What he really wanted was coffee, but he'd used up the last of it and was resigned to very strong black tea. Were he living with another man, he'd probably be scolded for staying up half the night doing nothing at all. Draco didn't like to be told to come to bed, not when his mind was whirring away endlessly, gears turning even in fitful sleep.
You see, Harry Potter rode a Muggle contraption called a motorcycle. It was an insane two-wheeled monstrosity that growled louder than a jungle cat and was all gleaming metal and shiny black paint. Draco had no idea how Potter stayed atop it without magic, but he did, and he looked like a complete twat astride it.
There were nerves fluttering in Harry's stomach, but not because he was going to take Draco to bed — he had absolutely no reservations about that at all. Harry didn't often bring people home. There were his friends, on occasion, but they usually avoided Grimmauld Place whenever possible. Even now, he'd really only shared his new home with those closest to him: Hermione and Ron, of course, Ginny because she'd practically kicked down the door, and Luna because she was endlessly helpful and didn't ask too many questions. But that was it. He'd only owned the place a few weeks and during those weeks, Harry was consumed with work and with the wedding, with Draco. Mostly with Draco.
Potter agreed to tea again and they drank it by the pool, even though Draco thought it was far too hot to drink tea outside, or at all really. But Potter seemed to like the heat and Draco was inclined to indulge him as it made him pliant and sleepy and far less likely to notice that Draco was staring at him again. He even unbuttoned his Auror robes to reveal a white t-shirt and dark jeans, rolled once at the ankles over his boots.
Does Harry know Draco’s naked under the covers? And if he did, would he still willingly lie next to him? Draco thinks probably not. He tightens his grip on the sheets.
on furniture, he draped himself over it. He didn’t put the limbs where they were meant to be but let them spill out over the arms and across the seat. It was too casual, blasé and boneless, and Draco hated the way it looked.
Draco had a bit of a weakness for the sort of casual confidence that Potter appeared to have mastered in the years since school. What Draco might have once written off as arrogance suddenly had an entirely new appeal.
Draco was going to come. His body stilled, and tensed, and he threw back his head, exposing the long, pale expanse of his throat.
"I'll be back tomorrow with a change of clothes for you," she promised. "Try to rest a little, will you, darling?"
Back at his shop, Draco attacked his to-do list with the determination of the heavily caffeinated. He was in the middle of realigning his wards when a sleek owl with charcoal grey feathers and clever yellow eyes landed in front of him and shat on his papers.
"Well, Potter. Fancy meeting you here." Draco dropped his voice to the low purr he used to draw men in, and it worked like a charm, because Potter took another step closer, so he stood in the vee of Draco's thighs, then dropped backwards onto the seat. His eyes narrowed, and he propped one high-topped trainer on the rung of Draco's stool.
“Emile?” Draco mumbled, wiping a hand across his eyes to dispel anything that might be a figment of his sleep-deprived imagination.
“You want me to fuck you, don’t you,” Harry said. It wasn’t a question, and Harry didn’t need an answer.
“I get it if you want to put in for a new partner or a transfer, but I can’t do this anymore. I can’t just sit in that office with you after seeing that, after
The two rows of seats were empty, save for one lanky ginger on his feet, hooting and hollering into cupped hands. And the other sat low in his chair, scuffed boots propped on the seat in front of him, a riot of raven hair tufted around his ears, and his face half-hidden in a hideous hand-knit scarf.
Draco set aside the champagne glasses clutched in his shaky hand, upsetting one and spilling the sparkling golden liquid all over the countertop. But Draco didn't care, didn't even turn when the upended glass rolled off the table and shattered on the floor.
“Well, he’s back,” Blaise says. “Granger brought me on as liaison for some new organisation he’s funding. It’s all very hush-hush as yet, but I will fill you in as soon as I know more. Some sort of Muggle and Wizarding coalition. A legal nightmare, I’m afraid.”
“You slugged Briggs? Oh my god. Oh my god! That’s fantastic. I wish I had been there! What did her face do? Did it go all constipated? Did she bleed? Cry? What did she even say? It must have been something particularly awful. Let me guess, did she call you a name? Make a joke about your scar? Your dead parents? Your hair? Your horrible fashion sense? I have to know.”
Everyone knew Potter wasn’t in London. He’d sold that dreary old Black mansion as soon as the post-war trials ended and then simply disappeared. He would make the occasional appearance at a gala or fundraiser every few months — just enough to keep the rumour mill in business — then he would vanish again. His friends were infamously tight-lipped, though he was occasionally photographed on English soil with Granger, or Lovegood, or an assortment of Weasels.
“So, what has you so distracted that you forgot about my visit?” Emily asked, swishing eggs around in a pan. He looked up at Draco from behind a fan of dark lashes. “Or who?”
The hands on the clock finally reached five twenty. Harry straightened his robes, ran a hand through his hair (not that it made a lick of difference), and apparated to Blaise’s posh building.
Harry kicked a lever with one booted foot, jostling them, and the bike roared to life. He twitched his wrist on the throttle, and the bike growled and spat like an angry cat. And then they shot forward at an alarming speed.
It wasn’t as if Draco was celibate, resigned to kisses from his ex in the dark and nothing more. He dated occasionally. More often than not, he took a willing body to bed and kicked them out by morning, and that was fine. It was all fine. The few times he’d tried for more ended in disaster because, apparently, dating someone required communication and a mutual sharing of dreaded
Draco suffered a few weeks on Pansy’s hard old sofa until Harry found out and came to his rescue. Typical heroic Gryffindor. And after sleeping in this bed for nearly four months, it’s almost starting to feel like home. Draco feels safe here, though the house is dark and dusty and reeks of mildew in certain places. Half of it stays locked up because Harry only exists in a few rooms: the kitchen, the sitting room, and his bedroom. And while those rooms are only a touch less dust-caked than the rest, they
Lovegood gestured to the chair across from hers, and Draco took a careful seat. He cast an involuntary glance at the plate of biscuits, and Lovegood's smile grew.
She chewed her lip — a gesture of contemplation rather than fear, as she seemed to roll the idea around in her head. “What are the risks?”
"It says, best wishes, HP. Who's HP?" Then her lips twitched, and her smile turned sly. "Draco, is this
Draco makes the necessary adjustments to the lapels and the collar, then holding the collar of the jacket between his fingers, slips it from Potter’s shoulders and returns it to the hanger.
“Hannah, pet,” Draco said, interrupting Emile’s monologue, which earned him a sharp glare from his friend. “He’ll carry on forever if you don’t cut him off, and I know you have better things to do than listen to my friend chatter.”
She leveled Harry with a look. “Harry, Sirius didn’t even like this house. He’d probably be thrilled you’re getting rid of it. Good riddance, he’d say.”
“Well,” Draco said, gesturing with the champagne and hearing it fizz as it sloshed against the sides of the bottle. “Once I burn through a place, I move on to the next.”
Even though he is alone, Draco is thrilled for his friends. It is like that Muggle book he read once said: “‘Tis a far, far better thing doing stuff for other people,” or however it went. Because Draco finds, to his great surprise, that it is true.
The internal wards were still set against him, so Draco rode the lift from the lobby to the top floor.  The lift doors opened directly into an expansive foyer that spilled into an open plan living room, complete with luxe leather furniture, a glass-topped coffee table, a rug in an animal print Draco couldn’t identify, and an entire wall stuffed with records, all neatly arranged by the colors of their sleeves. The entire external wall was floor to ceiling windows and the sun hanging low in the sky over London cast the room in a spectacular rose gold glow.
. If Harry already had some hair-brained ideas about dragon rescues, broomstick racing, or some other such nonsense, he'd kill the bastard himself.
"I never actually wanted to be an Auror," Weasley said, sipping his coffee. "I only joined up because of Harry. Because where he goes, I go. He has a way of making everything feel like an adventure, and we'd been fighting for so long, I'm not sure either of us really knew if we could do anything else."
Draco can’t keep still. He rocks in Harry’s lap, liquid circles of his hips as his eyes roll back in his head at the torturous friction. Harry feels like a furnace beneath him, his skin burning hot under Draco’s hands as they scrape over his chest and curl around the back of his neck.
She rolled her lips around her teeth and raised her eyebrows, shaking her head. Draco went back to his work.
Draco swallowed around the pathetic whimper that rose in his throat and gritted his teeth to keep his chin from quivering. His body was at constant war with his mind when Potter touched him, when he said things like that — demanded them, really. Because Harry's touch
“Hey!” she squeaks, then punches him in the shoulder. “You’re a disaster. Come on.” She tugs the empty glass from his white-knuckled grip, peeling his fingers back one by one. “Let’s dance.”
"So, that's what you want, then?" Harry purred the words against Draco's mouth as Draco chased them with kittenish swipes of his tongue.
“Just wondering what the bloody hell is taking you so long. If you want a wank, I’ll just fuck off, shall I?”
Pansy moved so quickly, Draco barely registered the click of her heels on the floor before she was slapping the shirt he was pretending to fold from his hand and wrenching him around.
Draco's mouth worked, but it took effort to make any sounds come out. "I—I didn't bring any of those…"
Consciousness must have slipped away from him, because the next thing Draco knew, there was a firm hand on his shoulder, shaking him gently awake. Draco straightened abruptly from his slump, running a surreptitious hand through his hair in an effort to maintain some semblance of professionalism, as if he hadn’t fallen asleep in the corner of Harry Potter’s room.
Harry wanted to pound into him, hard and relentless, but Draco reached up and grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, dragging Harry against him, kissing him hard. Draco's mouth was hot and wet and if Harry could just go a little harder, a little faster, he could come like this, their mouths fused together, sharing breath. But Draco had him by the jaw. The crumpled desperation had cleared from his face, to be replaced with something ruthless.
"Oh dear, succumbing to rumours, Potter? What would the Ministry think of that? Alas, I fear I've been discovered. We'll just attribute it to your excellent sleuthing skills, shall we? Rather than the fact that we are standing in the toilets of a bloody gay bar. You've caught me. Is that what you wanted? To out me? Well, go ahead. Makes no fucking difference. You ought to be a bit more concerned about what people might say about
"You're a fool, Harry Potter," he said with a sneer, stepping in close enough to stab a finger a mere inch from Potter's furious face. "You think you're convincing anyone? Do you think you've earned their love by being nothing more than some stupid kid who saved the world with dumb luck? Must be why you need all the fans and glory, because without them, you've got nothing else. Because everyone has moved on with their lives but
Harry trailed after Malfoy into the lift, where Malfoy was suspiciously silent. He followed him across the lobby and out onto the kerb, where Malfoy hailed a black cab with nothing more than the wiggle of his long, pale fingers.
“As if a Weasley could ever afford anything I have to offer,” he said, and scoffed. “And last I checked, this isn’t your flat. Is Lovegood here? Or did she just leave her guard dog to bark at guests?”
“How generous,” Emile said, and Draco felt Potter’s foot shift against his, pressing harder into his ankle — an almost comforting gesture. “I hope he’s keeping you safe from harm. It could be dangerous. Isn’t that right, Harry?”
Zabini brushed off Harry’s rudeness with nothing more than a twitch of his brow. “I think there has been a misunderstanding between you and me.”
Draco thought about it for a moment. They needed to give the impression that they actually enjoyed each other’s company, that they could get through an evening without the buffer of two hundred Ministry workers. It would have to be intimate and easy to photograph. “How about dinner?”
Potter steadied him with a hand and a cautious glance, pushing open the door and waving Draco inside.
Harry blinked rapidly as his brain stuttered to a halt and all the blood rushed south. There was something about hearing such filthy words in that posh accent. It did things to Harry's self-control.
"Harry, love, we're going over to Michael's to celebrate our embarrassing defeat. Coming?" His tone sounded cheery, but the glance he shot at Draco was uneasy.
Potter’s eyes widened and Draco stilled, his heart stuttering to a halt in his chest. He shouldn’t have said that. He
"Afraid I'll need my wand for this one. Not sure I can trust myself to cast even a simple cleaning spell without vanishing one of my bollocks off."
It was the loneliness that was the worst part – the deafening silence and solitude that seemed to seep from the walls of Number Twelve and into his skin. It didn’t seem to matter how much noise he filled it with, how many fires he burned in the grate, how the sun sweltered outside, it always felt cold and miserable to Harry.
Potter’s eyes narrowed and his smile went sly. “It’s like,” he chewed his lip. “Bit floral, I guess? Perfumey.”
“Did he go with the Ethan Allen? Blast, I was hoping he’d pick the Bernhardt. Far more suitable. And it matched the curtains much better.”
Draco waved him off, though his cheeks heated anyway. He snagged his fresh drink and Harry’s whisky, and pressed it into his hand. “So, where were you?”
Everything felt so stagnant. His stupid job that had once held all the promise of action and adventure and
Potter just glared at Draco with one dark brow arched. Draco snagged his coat and made a very good attempt at getting an arm into each of the sleeves, with only mild difficulty, to which Potter snickered and shook his shaggy head.
"Fuck, Harry," he said, breathing the name and watching the way Harry's eyes lit at the sound of it.
“Granger,” he says with a polite nod. “And Potter, what are you doing here?” His smile turns lascivious, but he can’t seem to help himself, because Potter almost looks good. He’s wearing the jeans, of course, but paired with one of the classic Prada button-down shirts Draco forced on him, and it fits brilliantly. His hair is not as Draco left it, without product and curling across his forehead wildly, but it is a vast improvement upon its original state.
"Oh Jesus, fuck," Potter cursed against Draco's mouth as Draco ran a hand over the bulge in Potter's jeans, squeezing lightly and feeling it twitch beneath his fingers.
Pansy pulled a face as she extracted a pair of blue pyjamas with white piping from the pile. “I don’t know who this J.Crew is, but we should throw him into Azkaban for crimes against fashion.”
Draco almost smiled at that. “I’m going to have to rescue more than one Weasley spawn to get on their good side, I’m afraid.”
Draco scoffs. “We can’t all be as naturally adorable as you,” he says dryly, punctuating the words with a roll of his eyes.
He looked at her sharply, but Pansy remained unaffected. Draco never should have given her all that wine; it made her immune to his cutting looks.
Malfoy was attractive, and if he were anyone other than Draco fucking Malfoy, Harry might have considered it. But it didn't matter how fit he was, this was Malfoy and Malfoy always had an angle. Harry wouldn’t be fool enough to fall for it.
He didn't wait for Hannah to return with the check. He left at least quadruple the cost of the coffee on the table, hoping she saw it for what it was: a bribe to never bring up old memories again. Hannah's cappuccino was the best Draco had outside of Paris, and he had a feeling he would need her in the coming weeks.
“It is, but people expect it of me. If I were to suddenly start rescuing kneazles from trees or volunteering with underprivileged squibs, people would think I was up to something.”
“Whatever you say, Healer Malfoy.” His differential tone was mocking but sent a shiver down Draco’s spine all the same.
“Dragon fire,” she said, and the Mediwizard, who Draco had completely forgotten was still in the room, dropped his clipboard.
But Draco didn't care. Who needed sleep? Not when everything he'd ever dreamed of was right bloody there.
It was incredibly inconvenient and even a little bit rude for Potter to spend every day butting his messy head into Draco’s office, only to skip out as soon as Draco had finally come to the epiphany that he might potentially…possibly…just maybe not hate Potter. How was he expected to test this theory if Potter kept himself locked away in his gigantic office in the DMLE rather than haunting Draco’s doorway? And anyway, Potter hadn’t even come round to notice the extra effort Draco put into his wards that afternoon. He spent all evening devising a complex web of Potter-specific wards and he wasn’t even there to appreciate them! The bastard.
Draco slants him a glance and smirk. “I didn’t think anyone would be fool enough to invite you to parties.”
Harry and Draco exchanged a couple of rather business-like owls; a simple trading of pre-surgery recommendations and what to expect in terms of healing. Draco gave him reluctant permission to ride the motorbike post-operation (though not immediately following it), but stated that in no uncertain terms was Harry allowed to crawl atop any dragons until his bandages were removed or else Draco would have to tie him to the nearest unmovable object. Harry responded with a note about how he’d prefer to be tied to a bed, which was perhaps less professional, and had Draco choking on his tea and spitting it all over the paperwork spread across Marcus’ desk.
"I better go get changed. Thank you for tea, Mother. Father," Draco said as he placed his linen serviette on the table, pushed back his chair, and nodded at his parents.
“That’s the game, Potter. Drop them.” Draco shoved the cards aside, and with a casual touch to his wand where it lay on the table, they sorted themselves into a neat stack.
"While I appreciate your vote of confidence," Draco said with a scoff, though unease twisted in his gut. "I can handle myself."
from where Blaise had abandoned it, and it came sailing through the French doors of his bedroom. He examined the page, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
Draco glances towards the Tube entrance just twenty meters ahead and sees Potter raise his eyebrows in surprise. But Draco reasons Potter went to all the trouble of stunning a Muggle on his behalf, so he nods. “Oh, I suppose. I live in Soho. Carnaby Street. By the French café, do you know it?”
“I noticed it when you first started wearing it. I thought it was nice.” Harry frowns and shakes his head. “Not like I wanted it. Not really my style, but it looked nice on you. And then I started noticing other things. Like, this part of your neck is always showing.” Harry points to his own throat, that shadowed hollow at the base that Draco had buttoned away and hidden in the toilets at Genie’s. The place currently marked by Harry’s teeth. “And also, your shampoo smells really good, and I like the way your voice sounds, and your trousers are unfairly tight in the arse and while I suppose I’d noticed those things before, I couldn’t be sure. But yeah, I — I think I was into it. Into you.
It was his mother’s and he adored it. Without Lucius darkening their doorways, Narcissa had found a certain peace. She’d moved to Nice as soon as the trials ended, buying her sweet little flat with the view and filling it with fresh flowers and a white linen sofa. She smiled more freely now, laughed openly in a way Draco hadn’t heard since his childhood. When he went to visit her, they would drink Pinot Gris on the terrace and talk for hours. They’d eat fresh fruit with their fingers, watching the boats circling the bay and the tourists exploring the cafes and shops on the promenade.
Draco scoffed into the darkness of the room as he settled on his back on the sofa, staring up at the ceiling. Because look how well that had worked out for him, laying there alone in his beautiful flat stripped bare of furniture. He had no photos on the walls, no flowers in the dining room, no post piling up on the side table. There was nothing more than a single stained espresso cup sitting in his kitchen sink, and his coat hanging alone on the hook.
“Took me about twenty minutes just to figure out how to turn the thing on,” Potter said with a crooked smile. “You know most Muggles don’t even have those in their flats, right?”
“Harry,” he leveled. “Just let me do this. I’ll buy all your drinks. You can order top-shelf scotch all night if you like.”
Draco cleared his throat, desperately seeking something to fill the silence, to keep himself from asking what he really wanted, which was how Potter felt about Weasley seeing someone else. But instead, he said, “I was surprised that your Floo let me through.”
Potter lifted his face from the pillow and it was bright and pink and fucking lovely, and Draco scowled at him. Potter’s hair was absolutely
"It's called a Polaroid. It's a sort of Muggle camera. But Hermione charmed this one, so it takes magic photos. Not fancy ones—pretty simple ones, really. But I think they're quite cool," he said with a shrug.
Draco tried to respond to that note. He penned three different replies: the first flippant, the second far more serious, and the third just said:
Draco grunted, staring at the handwriting on the front of the package, addressed to Draco. No return address, but Draco didn't need to see an address to know who sent it.
Draco didn’t need any further coaxing before following, letting Harry walk him towards the bed. He buried his face in Harry’s neck, nipping at the thin, sensitive skin with his teeth. He shoved his hands down the back of Harry’s pants as he crowded against him, squeezing his arse and pulling his cheeks apart just to hear Harry groan.
Draco grins and steps forward to take her hand in his. He spins her around once so he can get the full view of her sparkling, floor-length gown. It falls to her ankles in a cascade of silk, slipping aside to reveal a slit that creeps halfway up her thigh.
That was reason enough for Draco to avoid entertaining any of Granger’s little theories. The woman was exceedingly clever and opening himself up to Granger’s scrutiny would no doubt result in embarrassment for Draco. If Potter found out about the implications of wand compatibility, Draco was sure it would horrify him—or even disgust him. He would likely request a new partner.  Although Draco found Potter obnoxious, arrogant, and endlessly difficult, he was also an excellent man to have at his back and as much as he hated to admit it, Draco would miss him if he were gone.
“Tell Harry I missed him on Tuesday. The Occamy are going to take wing soon and I hope he gets to see them before they leave.”
Draco doesn’t bother stumbling in the dark for pyjamas, and slips between the sheets naked, sighing. He tries to close his eyes, but sleep eludes him, as it so often does. Draco stares up at the ceiling, bathed in blue moonlight. He traces the crown moulding with his eyes, settling on the places where the wallpaper meets it at the corners. It’s peeling a little in one place. Though his gaze remains on that curling bit of paper, his ears strain in the buzzing silence until he hears the creak of the third stair from the landing. And then the sixteenth as Harry reaches the second floor. He listens to the squeak of the rusted hinge on the door to the loo, and the squeal of the taps as Harry turns on the shower. The pipes whistle and clank in the walls.
Draco lifted one eyebrow. He didn't like the twist of jealousy at the thought of Potter wrapped around some freckled ginger, but plastered on a smirk. "My compliments to Mr Weasley. See you around, Potter."
Potter threw up a shield at the last possible second. The explosive ricocheted off his magic, flinging a shower of debris in every direction. Draco held his hands over his head as the glass in all the surrounding cases blew out of their panes as if pummelled by a hurricane-force wind.
Harry groaned. He remembered when that story came out He couldn’t look Charlie in the face all Christmas dinner that year.
“Care for another?” Pansy asked, shaking the champagne bottle over her glass, peering into it, then shaking it once more.
But Blaise was on him, spinning him around and pinning him against the back of the couch, one arm on either side of him, caging him in.
“I don’t like zucchini,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose at the contents of the saute pan Harry was stirring. He plucked a piece of chicken from the pan and popped it in his mouth.
He twitched his fingers and the whisky set about pouring itself into the hovering glasses, which then floated gracefully into Harry’s outstretched hand. Malfoy lifted his gingerly from the air.
“Yes.” The word was more exhalation than actual speech, and Draco’s gut flooded with desire, liquid and molten hot.
A tortured moan rips itself from Draco’s lips. Why did he have to say it like that? Why did he have to hold Draco with such possessive hands? Kiss him so hungrily? Because Draco was going to come for him, as he always he did. It didn’t matter whether he was alone in his bed, or in the shower, back pressed against cool tile. It didn’t even matter if Draco was wrapped up in someone else, if another man bit kisses into his throat, because it was always for Harry.
“Promises, promises,” Draco replied with a wink. He wouldn’t have to worry about shifting or using the stupid clutch if he didn’t bother slowing down in the first place.
Potter picked at his noodles with his chopsticks, his eyes drifting back to Draco, pinning him. “Was the NH Act really your idea?”
Draco’s body moved without the permission of his brain and he stepped up to where Potter was sprawled and dropped into his lap, one knee on either side of Potter’s hips. Draco felt Potter still beneath him as he took another long drink from the bottle, chasing an errant drop with the tip of his tongue.
It was no use trying to deny it, not now that Potter could see it plainly written across Draco's face. Because it was still there after all those years, that strange magnetism between them. And Potter felt it too, Draco had no doubt. It was clear in the resigned set of Potter's shoulders, the grim line of his mouth, the storms in his eyes. It would be devastating, utterly destructive, because he and Potter were forever crashing into each other, unable to stop it.
Weasley slapped him on the back and leapt from the Jeep without opening the door, jogging over to where Potter stood.
“Mm, I’ll settle for a hearty thanks and an invitation to that lush Christmas party she has every year.”
“Hm? Oh. Yeah, course,” he said with a trademark shrug. “I can tune it out most of the time.” He gave Draco a loaded look. “Most of the time,” he repeated.
“Good,” Draco said. He felt the tingling scrape of Harry’s cleaning spell across his fingers, the flesh of his most intimate places, and he shivered. He always shivered when Harry touched him with his magic.
“That’s what I fucking said, isn’t it?” Draco snapped. “It wasn’t on purpose, so don’t give me that fucking look, Blaise. I thought he was fit, and I was bored, and I just…I wanted to fuck him, all right? It was just a game. But then – then it wasn’t a game anymore.”
so often did. They didn’t speak, but it was far from silent. The calls of the gulls rang out and the waves roared and crashed against the rocks below. The music played, loud enough to make out, though Draco didn’t recognise it.
"Since the beginning. Harry thinks he's clever, but I happen to be married to the smartest person both of us know." He smirked, but the wind whipped that away too. "He reckons you left England because of him."
He still hadn’t seen hide nor hair of Potter by Friday and Draco felt a massive strop coming on. He thought about flooing Pansy, or going to the bar, but instead he poured himself a glass of wine and attempted to focus on some inane Muggle mystery novel Granger had lent him after their last lunch meeting.
“Of course I did, darling. It isn’t any fun to see you smile if I don’t also get to watch you suffer first.”
Draco's heart promptly stuttered to a stop while his brain supplied lurid imagery of his thighs wrapped around Potter's hips, chest against Potter's strong back, and hands at his waist, the growling vibrations of the motorbike beneath them as they soared across the night sky.
“I’ll be very cross that you ruined all my hard work,” Draco said. He took a step toward Harry, then another, crowding him against the front door.
“It’s Blaise’s,” Malfoy threw over his shoulder as Harry trailed after him onto a huge terrace that wrapped around the edge of the building.
It wasn't as if he and Potter had discussed being exclusive. In fact, they never once spoke about what the fuck it was that they were doing, and Draco, until that moment, was quite content with the omission. But the truth was, Draco didn't go to the club anymore. He no longer pulled nameless Muggles and hadn't done so since foolishly following that bartender home to his shitty flat on New Year's Eve.
“That’s what I thought.” She scoffed, taking him by his bound arms. And steering him to the aperation point.
‘I think that’s obvious Weasley. He wants you as our informant.’ Draco stated. Looking over at Harry for signs he was wrong.
"She's as good as the pureblood whores on knockturn. I had one last night. Her mouth on my cock, and another one eating out her pussy." He rubbed at his hard on. "Best night of my life. Then went home and the miss's rode me. Her tits bouncing milk oozing down her pregnant belly." he garbed at himself again. From what Harry could see.
