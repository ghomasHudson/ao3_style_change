Kreacher nodded. Harry stood up, and stepped into the downstairs sitting room.
“Harry, darling,” Mrs Malfoy said, taking his arm to help him out of the fireplace. “I’m so delighted you could join us. Please, Draco, bring our guest to the parlour.”
with wandless magic.” He glanced nervously at Ron. “Ron? Are you okay?”
It really did feel incredibly European, lounging naked in bed eating tiny pieces of meat and cheese and sipping wine (Harry was almost beginning to get an appreciation for the stuff, after a few months back in Hermione’s company).
“Something I learned, in the years I was struggling to find my own way again,” he said, passing her the glass, “is that you can’t do any better than you’ve learned to do. And you can’t work on information you don’t have. All that matters is that when you have a chance to do better, you do it. I think about that every day. A Muggleborn Witch or Wizard comes to me in need of help and there is a part of me that knows that if they knew who I was, they’d be afraid that I would hurt them. I tried to be exactly like my father for so long that I never once questioned whether he was right about — anything, really. I was the dutiful little Death Eater as soon as I knew what the words meant, and then by the time I realised it was a load of bollocks and I needed to find a way to escape, or die trying, he was back. Tom Riddle. Offering me the Dark Mark and making it clear that I would accept, and do what he told me to do, or my parents would be eaten alive by his charming pet snake.”
“That’s… is that Pansy Parkinson’s Firewhiskey?”
“D’you know what else they said?” Ron asked, mischievously. “He has to cut his hair.”
Draco laughed, and shot out ahead of Harry, only to curse as Harry slipped past him, making a face, just barely avoiding a tree on the edge of the lake as he shot high up into the air.
“You’re not,” Draco insisted. You can’t be. There’s one thing left. Please, Harry. Darling. Please. Do you love me?”
“My clothes are in the wardrobe. My books are in the shelves.” He shrugged, beginning to feel annoyed. “If this is the way you express your gratitude for my having prevented you from dying looking like an old raisin —”
“I had no idea,” Harry said. “I’m sorry they weren’t interested in — I mean, of course, everyone needs to follow their own hearts, but…”
“I stopped,” Harry said. “After a few years, I stopped.”
It was surprising that in the end it was Hermione who was the first to crack; Harry had to berate himself for assuming that she was somehow immune to this kind of garbage, just because she was the most determined person he knew. The night she woke screaming for the first time, Harry and Ron wrapped themselves around her afterwards and she cried for hours into Ron’s neck.
“I see.”
“If you’re trying to make me feel better, Draco, it’s not working.”
The mug of coffee was broken, on the floor, as were the shards of the mirror he had thrown it at. He looked like he was trying to appear collected, even disinterested, but he was shaking.
Hermione had been pretending not to notice the two elves who had been creeping closer, listening to her every word. They came closer still, now; one wore a dirty dishtowel and the other, a hat and socks. Young, determined.
Harry snorted, and it hurt, so he elected not to do it again. Hermione returned from the downstairs bathroom with a wet facecloth. “Clean yourself up,” she said, not unkindly. “You’ve got blood all over your face. Now, what happened?”
. He’s taken up so much space in your head, it’s no wonder he made his way to your heart.”
“— you’re not too old for me to put you over my knee,” Harry said severely.
Harry stared at it for a long time, and finally turned it over. Apparently, Mrs Malfoy had used the Black family seal. That seemed significant. “I don’t suppose your mother knows how to conceal a howler,” he said, uneasily. Draco only sniffed, and Harry opened the letter.
Mrs Malfoy’s voice was terribly gentle, when she prodded him along. “What are you trying to say, Harry? Don’t worry about the words — just try to say what you mean.”
about teaching the children. But it really didn’t matter. It was fucking fantastic, and fun; Harry suddenly wavering terribly with a jelly-legs jinx, and then repelling a bat-bogey hex back at Draco, resulting in the students rolling on the floor with laughter.
“I don’t mind at all,” Harry said, wrapping a hand around the back of Draco’s neck to pull him down into a kiss.
Hermione frowned. “And you can’t just cast wandlessly?”
“Is that why you don’t use magic anymore?”
The armchair at Harry’s side was feeling far too much like home, Hermione thought. It had gradually, over the last six weeks, become accustomed to her precise way of sitting, the way she tended to hold a book open on one arm, and as a result it looked very strange when she wasn’t sitting in it. And it wasn’t comfortable for anyone else, either. In fact, it had developed such a high opinion of itself that Hermione had heard more than one person confide that they thought it had kicked them, right in the seat of their pants, when they attempted to requisition it for a short visit.
For a moment Draco stiffened, surprised and probably uncomfortable. And then she felt his arms move, wrapping around her waist; cautious and polite, until they suddenly weren’t, and he was hanging on for dear life.
“Can I make you some breakfast? I mastered the most wonderful dish called — you’ll like this —
“He was asleep in his office, on his day off. He was summoned to be backup on a case that wasn’t his, at which point he was found asleep and unable to be woken.”
“If I throw up, I shall try to do so on the robe, which will be easier to clean than the carpet.”
There had been so much to do, though. Rebuilding Hogwarts took months — it was far quicker to rebuild than a simple Muggle castle would have been, since the castle was determined to help, but the castle couldn’t do everything itself — it was injured. It had been mortally wounded, and for the first few weeks people wondered if it had actually died.
They were greeted by Rubino, who took another opportunity to practice his English with them, but this time didn’t take their coats. Perhaps because they were lighter; the weather was warm, as could be expected in this part of Italy in the late Spring, and anyway, Hermione was glad not to have to feel guilty about the wizened elf working for them.
Molly had been the closest thing Harry had to a mother in his entire sodding life, and he didn’t know how to tell her that he would be spending time at Malfoy Manor the following day.
These lying liars were lying, and Harry knew it.
Worse:
all were.”
Malfoy turned to Neville. Neville was calmly eating, pretending he hadn’t just kicked Malfoy in the shin, but Harry felt his face burn. There were not a lot of people who knew about Harry’s childhood beyond having been raised by an Aunt and an Uncle. Neville could relate, as good a woman as his Grandmother was. But something about his misery at the loss of his parents had led Harry to tell him a little more about it, one night when they were sitting on the windowsill of their dormitory unable to sleep, watching the sleet fall. The cupboard under the stairs. Feeling hungry all the time. His sneaking suspicion that the reason he never got as tall as his father was as simple as never having had enough to eat.
There was a part of him that had known this might happen. Harry’s magical signature had been getting weaker much faster than his physical strength, and it felt like he was giving up. But they were so fucking close, and all that Draco could think was that Harry might never get a chance for a real day off. Or a week, or a month. Or to decide he was done, and spend the rest of his life making decisions that didn’t leave him scarred and in need of escape.
He wrote, this time.
A part of Draco had wanted to lie. He still remembered that. Saying no, he hadn’t known if it was Potter or not. Be sent to Azkaban, and hope to be dead within the year. He wanted to lie because he’d had a fitful of being saved by Harry Sodding Potter and he wanted to make his own stupid decisions, just once.
Draco woke as the run was beginning to pink up the windows; woke up to hair that would have given a bird’s nest a bad name, the most impressive morning wood he could remember for a good long while and his fingers still tangled in Harry’s. He climbed off the bed and staggered to the sitting room, and then beyond, to the bathroom, where he stripped off his clothes into a messy pile he’d surely be annoyed about later.
“Don’t worry. I happen to know an exceptional Potions Master. Have I need for anything, I ask him.” Harry took a glass.
. What a fucking considerate arsehole. Draco smiled at him fondly.
“Oh?”
“Oh, no,” Harry said, shaking his head. “A friend spent the night. In the guest room. I’d forgotten, for — anyway,” he said, when she looked worryingly like she might start asking questions. Mrs Anand still had a lot of friends at the Prophet. “I could repair her, though it would be a very delicate job, and I don’t believe that she would ever be able to focus and channel magic properly again. I could put her in stasis, so you could display her as an heirloom.”
,” she said, and they stepped into the green flames.
nice; Draco had put some real effort in, the first year, nudging walls here and there, expanding bookshelves and carefully selecting wallpaper and carpet. The window, as large as it was, looking out over a starry sky, was entirely artificial but no less beautiful for all of that, and there was always the scent of nutmeg and cinnamon in the fire. Mother had helped, of course; there wasn’t a witch in England with her style, and as complicated as their relationship could be at times, Draco had enjoyed having a project for them to work on together.
“Narcissa,” Mrs Malfoy said gently. “How many times must I ask you to call me Narcissa?”
“Draco.”
Harry laughed quietly. “I’d like to see him try. I’m an Auror, you know, a rather good one, and he has the upper body strength of a Cornish Pixie.”
“Did you see that?” he said out loud. “I like feeding the ducks.”
Draco waited patiently for an explanation.
“Er,” Potter replied, his brow furrowing. “Is this supposed to make me feel better, Malfoy? Because —”
“I’m going abroad for a little while,” he said.
“It could backfire very badly when he wakes up.”
Ron frowned at Hermione and then at Harry. “She’s doing that thing where she’s pretending you’re stupid for a while just to give herself time to come up with something else to say,” Ron said. And then, “Yes please. It’s good pie, ‘Mione.”
“Molly,” he said, when a familiar face came into sight. “Mr Ollivander passed away in the night. I think I need your help.”
Draco’s mouth tightened, but he said nothing.
Draco flushed. “Oh.”
When it was dark and arrangements had been made for his interment, Ollivander’s son, who had to be in his eighties himself, told Harry that the shop now belonged to him. He wouldn’t be drawn into an argument about it, either. None of them would; as Ollivander’s apprentice — though Harry supposed he wasn’t an apprentice anymore — she shop was his. If any of them had shown the inclination, it would have passed to them.
He rested his elbows on the counter, and took a deep breath.
“Malfoy! What happened?” he asked, patting Malfoy down carefully, trying to find any obvious source of pain.
Although if one was to split hairs, the tone of that statement
“Please just tell me you’re making progress.”
“I hope you didn’t have to listen to all of that. He’s not that bad, really. Just persistent. I don’t know when I realised my late twenties had become my… very,
Besides — it meant he could act as a witness, when he needed to. And he’d done that, as honestly and as neutrally as he was able to.
Before that, though?
“Because you’re better than me.” Draco wanted to spit the words, but they were true, so he said them instead, cradling them on the edge of his lip for as long as he could manage.
“I see your paranoia hasn’t been dulled by years of hunting out dark wizards,” he said, at last, and Potter’s eyes snapped up, almost apologetic. “I’m really not intending to poison you, though your distrust is well-earned.”
No one acknowledged the lie. Instead, they chatted about inconsequential things, and when Arthur and Draco returned from the shed, Draco was holding a battered old acoustic guitar.
“What’s odd?” Hermione asked, gripping his hand tightly.
“So that’s all.” Draco rolled his eyes, and elected against tasking Harry if his use of the present tense indicated that he intended to return to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. “Necessity is the mother of mastering the most difficult bloody magic in the world.”
Anticipation came. He acknowledged it; it was a feeling he didn’t often encounter, and he appreciated its child-like excitement. He sent it away.
time,” Neville said, shrewdly, adding honey to his porridge. “No one sends
And then he smiled, and he looked like Harry Potter; and she smiled, and she felt like Hermione Granger.
Harry looked over the map in his hands. “Instructions on how to bring the wards down. But why… this doesn’t make any sense,” Harry said, shaking his head.
Sometimes, her hands shook, and she was afraid of almost
problems. This commitment to the old Pureblood ideals! Completely ridiculous. The Pureblood family trees look more like shrubs. Like spiderwebs. It’s very fortunate we’ve not started seeing generations of children with extra toes or tails. And by the time dear Lucius saw that I was right…”
“They’re yours,” Harry said, closing his hand around their cocks, fucking them both into his hand. “Everything I have. Yours.”
He missed Draco.
“It’s another super-hero movie,” Ron said, his eyes shooting up into his fringe. “X-Men. They’re like Wizards, except they can’t do as much, poor sods. And it’s because of… er… blood things. Merlin, Muggles come up with funny ideas. I’m in it for the popcorn, really. And a bit of a grope.”
to spend the afternoon beating yourself up. If it wouldn’t offend, I’d like to suggest a couple of therapists in London who might be able to help you.”
The last time he had done this, he’d had two other Aurors with him to help. Harry was too much raw power and not enough focus, always had been. Even so, he kept the chant up, fine wandwork that he hadn’t been sure he was still capable of, and by the time Headmaster McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey were crowded around the unconscious form of Draco Malfoy, the dark was beginning to allow itself to be pulled into the bottle.
Draco barely registered Harry’s gesture before the Warming Charm enveloped him. He didn’t want to let out the treacherous, contented little moan, but he’d been caught unaware. He wondered if Harry even realised he’d done it. Perhaps, perhaps not. He was still smiling, but he looked wistful, as well, letting his gaze fall on the castle.
“Alright,” Draco said, drawing him back with soft touches, smoothing his hair. “It’s alright, Harry. But I want you to show me something.”
“I don’t… you know I can’t be your Healer again,” Draco said.
To her credit, Hermione didn’t rush to comfort. Harry supposed that was why he’d asked her, and not Ron. She sat silent for a long time, and then twitched strangely. She grabbed Harry’s hand, and pressed it to her stomach. Harry was alarmed, momentarily, until he felt the kick under his hand, and then his face split into a grin.
“The spikes were never as sharp as he wanted us to believe,” he said, and ignored Draco making a rude face at them both. “Wanker,” Harry said, and Luna and Draco swapped partners.
“No. He doesn’t like it to be disturbed. You’ve seen the sign on the door. He’s on holidays. You can ask him to show you when he gets back.” Harry gave Draco what felt like a very shaky smile and tried to pull away.
Draco snorted. “Not bad. A little more practice and you’ll be flinging barbs like it’s 1995.” He offered Potter what he hoped was a sincere smile, and with a moment’s hesitation Potter seemed to accept it.
Harry shrugged. “Some.” He couldn’t meet Draco’s eyes, though, and that was probably more telling. When he glanced up at last Draco’s expression told him as much. His eyes were soft, and he glanced from Harry’s eyes to his mouth and away again.
“You’ve got a filthy mouth.”
“We are, Pans. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to push him in case he took off again.”
he was planning to say something.
“You did,” Greg said. “You bet us all a million galleons that they’d get married one day. I don’t have a million galleons, though,” he said, sorrowfully, to Blaise. “But you remember, mate?”
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” he replied, stepping forward to shake the offered hand. “Are you enjoying your break so far?”
She nodded, but still looked worried. “And your Mind Healer…”
A minute later, Draco handed him a large vial with a heavy stopper. “I assume you know the dosage. I’ll put the rest of this aside, for now, and give some to Madam Pomfrey. Just let me know when you need more.”
“Scamp?” he called, and the owl descended from the rafters. She was still a funny little thing, not very dignified, but embarrassed by her indignities. She would enjoy a good long scratch around the neck and then bite, hard, reminding Harry that she was the boss. Like a cat, Harry supposed.
Harry clamped a hand over his mouth. Andromeda did the same, and turned away. Draco crouched on the ground in front of Teddy.
She sighed regretfully. “No International Floo Powder,” she said sadly. “It’s a new rule, needs to be approved in advance so that people don’t — well,
Harry passed him a box.
Harry relaxed even further, and shook his head. “I’m surprised I lasted as long as I did.”
As if on cue, Dora leapt up onto the table. She looked very interested in the sauce that Harry was stirring, and her coat changed to match it. Creamy mushroom with cracked pepper. “You’re a delight, do you know that?” he asked her, fondly, and she preened. And then to Hermione, he said “I dream about lovely normal garbage that makes no sense and I usually can’t remember more than a snatch of it in the morning.”
“Behaving? Predictable? Yes. Strong, and… and I’m having fun with it, in a way I don’t think I have since I was about thirteen years old. I love magic. I forgot that, for years — not many people could possibly understand that, but I know you do. Because when we found out we
“Of course not!” Draco’s expression was dark, stormy. Harry knew in that moment that he shouldn’t say another word. He looked away. “Listen,” Draco said. “I’m not an idiot. I’m also not a child. Umbridge — my father told me to get on her side, and I came by my megalomaniacal tendencies honestly. And my eagerness for self-preservation.” He glanced at Harry’s left hand. The old, worn, white scars still read
repeatedly from January first until he brought her there one weekend and showed her that the place was as clean and airy as anything she could have imagined, that no scrap of darkness clung to the corners of the rooms. He’d showed her how Teddy could have a good large playroom and if, as they worried, he began to change on the full moon when he turned eleven, they could set aside a safe room for him.
,” he said, but he didn’t actually sound annoyed. “I think… I think perhaps I’ll do as Draco asked, and just… rest for a while.” He was staring into the fireplace, with his mouth curled into a small smile, looking relaxed and happy for the first time in a long time. Hermione reached across to take his hand. “A week or two.”
, Draco. Not just shelter and food.”
“No. Stop it. No.”
He wrote.
“No.”
Hermione blinked hard.
Because, there was a part of him that knew he hadn’t made a single mistake. He’d seen Potter’s gaze flick to his mouth, felt a hunger in him when they were close; Harry had summoned the music from the ballroom to the porch outside Malfoy Manor, despite resisting Draco’s efforts to get him to dance. And he’d thought it was such a good solution, too! Out there, with no eyes on them, he thought he might have been able to ease Potter from his discomfort.
“It’s alright,” Harry said. “Everything will be fine.” He felt it. He believed it. Maybe he just needed to. He cupped Hermione’s face in his hands, and kissed her forehead.
“Hermione’s a bloody genius, isn’t she,” he said, turning away, because the satchel reminded him of the tiny beaded purse they’d all lived out of for so many months.
“I’m awake, Hermione. Every day that I’m awake and not working, the anxiety about what I’m missing gets worse. Let me have this.”
Harry lay on the couch in front of the fire, his head in Draco’s lap. Draco had a book in his hand, but he was playing with Harry’s hair, too, and he hadn’t complained once that it looked like he had an especially cranky hedgehog curled up on his head.
He saw Draco in his mind’s eye; the short hair that still looked like it would be soft, the kohl-dark eyes, pale grey irises and the unfettered anger on his face. He hated how often he thought of it. Harry’s hair fell over his shoulder and he reached back absently to tie the lot of it into a loose bun at the top of his head.
Late in the evening, Luna looked up as if startled; at what, Harry didn’t know. The stars, the trees, one of her, er, more imaginary creatures, perhaps. “Oh,” she said. “It’s that time.”
“Much better. Though your unconscious mind had its moments.”
“You’re allowed to want things for yourself, you know. You don’t have to stare at grey walls, and stone floors. You have money, I know you do. You’re allowed to be happy and comfortable. Life isn’t only about working, Potter, it’s about living, too. And I’m not sure you quite know how.”
“I dunno. Try a
“That’s not —”
“Tell me again about the one-eyed cat,” she said, with a yawn. “He lives on this block? I can’t believe I’ve never met him. Perhaps I need to slow down as well.”
“And you have an enormous head, Harry. I know people inflate it for you quite a lot, but there’s just no excuse.”
in order to avoid
Draco rolled his eyes, but they were sparkling. “Since you asked so nicely, I suppose I could tolerate your presence for the summer.” He ran his hand down over Harry’s chest. So strong, and broad, and overwhelming. “But I would like to know, Harry. What happens in the autumn?”
“I’ve written that down. Thank you. Goodbye,” he said, and he didn’t look away until the door was slammed closed.
“I invited you to a courting dance,” Draco said, finally meeting Harry’s eyes.
Hermione nodded. “Yes. It took some time. The castle herself helped, of course, but there was a lot of work to do. Harry and Ron and I were there for months, helping, until Ron and I went to Australia, to —”
Draco was really going to need to have a word with his subconscious about that.
Bollocks. “You’re right. I don’t know how to have fun.”
It was hot in the club but Harry felt suddenly cold. Very, very cold. Gooseflesh rose on the back of his neck and his arms, and his mouth went dry. He swallowed the rest of his pint in a couple of mouthfuls and turned to order another one, but somehow, turning away from Draco was damn near impossible to do. So he didn’t bother, just stood leaning against the edge of the bar and watching.
Draco had a light breakfast of tea and toast in his room in the morning, reading over some notes for the N.E.W.T. class that afternoon. Satisfied, he headed out into the castle to find a student or two who was dressed untidily enough to warrant lose a house point or two — always important to keep them on their toes.
Finally, the door opened, and Hermione stood up.
“I’m — supposed to kill Dumbledore.” Draco wanted to tear his eyes from Harry’s, but he couldn’t and he didn’t. “And if I don’t — he’ll kill my parents, and he’ll make me watch. And then he’ll kill me.”
“Nah. That was fun. He was never upset about that.” Hermione felt Ron… sort of spike, emotionally, and then shut himself back off again. It wasn’t the first time she’d felt something like that from him. “We should look for a trap door.”
“Well, this boy. Man.
Grayson and Finn looked up then as well, and agreed in earnest. “We’ll stay here and drink,” they promised Harry and Luna. “But if you fall in, send up red sparks so we know when to have a good laugh.”
As uncomfortable as it was to be back in the Ministry after all of these years, Draco appreciated
Harry did, indeed. As he had not grown one single inch taller since he was fourteen years old, he had his dress robes from the Yule Ball during Fourth Year, although he had broadened a lot in the intervening years and they might be snug across the chest and shoulders. But. Were they alright for a grown man? Were they still fashionable enough? He wished he didn’t owe Narcissa Malfoy anything. He had a suit, though, a Muggle suit, for when he needed to be undercover with the Aurors. Would that count? And who could he ask?
He scratched through Harry’s hair.
“I — yes,” Hermione said. “Anything. Of course. Send a Patronus when you’re ready and I can meet you anywhere you like.”
Harry shrugged. “More or less. I was allowed clothes, of course. Whatever my cousin Dudley had grown out of, as long as it wasn’t nice enough for a consignment store.” Draco was staring at him, now. Harry still didn’t turn his head, but he could feel the gaze, and he didn’t mind it.
“No, I… I apologise. You look pale.”
“It’s really not,” Harry said again to Molly, and then the bottom fell out of his stomach.
“Should we tell Parvati?”
“Sneakers. For sneaking, presumably? How Slytherin of you. I must say, Potter, I know for a fact that you’re at
And there was Potter. Not pushing forty, as they both were. Perhaps thirty. Stretched out on the sofa, asleep, in this beautiful home that was nothing like the reality. Potter opened his eyes, and smiled, and stretched, with an expression on his face that was so fond that Draco felt something inside him break.
Oh, he was going to give all of her fur coats
Just as exhausted, Harry brought the curse-box back, and opened it. “He called it fan mail. Does this happen often?”
Harry was glad to see Angelina Johnson arrive with George.
“Healthy as an ox,” Ron agreed. “Did you worry?”
“Harry,” Neville called, and Harry clenched his teeth, and turned back. Neville looked like he was about to ask question, and then he changed his mind. “I’m sending both of our RSVPs back.”
It was almost a relief when Ron and Gabrielle took the children home. As much as Hermione loved them, she could see the toll that it was taking on Harry to have to be so alert and responsive to the girls; she knew he wasn’t sleeping well, but that wasn’t the same as being worn out while he was awake, and rest at least was necessary. He curled up in the corner of Hermione’s couch when they were gone, cup of herbal tea in his hand and his eyes fixed on the flames in the fireplace (the fire wasn’t really necessary, the summer almost on them; but the house could get cold, and Hermione knew how much Harry loved the flickering of the flames, and the scent of wood smoke).
“No,” Harry said. The fire was gone. He just sounded hollowed out. “I was only ever
If he knew Harry sodding Potter, Boy Who Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World and sole possessor of Draco Malfoy’s miserable, useless heart, he wouldn’t come right away.
“The attic has a labyrinth of some sort in it — human sized wizard’s chess, a three-headed dog…”
Potter looked like he wanted to hide under that old invisibility cloak of his. He shook his head, but he didn’t take a step, which was telling. “You envied me? If you even knew how cracked that is —”
at that hair. And he was such a Gryffindor. And he didn’t know how to have fun, and who could stand that for longer than a long weekend with Blaise?
Professor Saltzman was the first to leave, citing a prior engagement with a sparkle in his eye. “His husband is a vampire,” Neville whispered as he left. “A rich vampire. Isn’t that the thing?”
hard.”
“You don’t know what it was like,” Hermione said.
“As are you, Malfoy,” Harry said cheerfully. It earned him a look with narrowed eyes. “Both pleased with yourself and annoying. Are you busy this evening?”
“Perhaps.” Hermione took the map from Harry, and then the rest of the papers, flicking through them. “But if he really has changed his mind… if he really is sorry, and Harry, I believed him, when he apologised. I did. Would you want to keep anything that reminded you of…”
Draco stood up, and locked the door to his office with a little swish of his wand. “And why would I let you do that, Potter?”
“I was thinking it might be time to sell her. The house. Or give her away, perhaps, though I would clearly need to get rid of that bloody portrait. D’you know someone who could help me with that?”
Harry didn’t respond.
my magic back. I came here — Merlin’s bollocks, why am I doing this? — I came because. Because you were here. Because there hasn’t been a day since I was eleven years old when I haven’t thought about you. Because I wanted you to be my friend even when we hated each other. Because I saw the way you looked at me that night in the club, when I’d said goodbye to magic forever, and I —“
Harry was suddenly so angry that some spiteful thirteen-year-old version of himself rose to the surface and he found himself thinking again of Ginny’s bat-bogey hex. But he didn’t reach for his wand or his magic. He was an adult. An Auror, a Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and he had killed Tom Riddle.
,” Harry said, still looking guilty. A number of items in his office trembled for a moment. “Whoops. I think I’m still having a little trouble focussing.” He looked at his wand, cast aside on his desk, as if it was the reason Harry’s magic was all over the place. It didn’t respond, but if any wand had ever looked haughty, Harry’s wand did at that moment. In fact, it looked downright miffed.
“I have more money than I could spend in five lifetimes,” Harry replied. He felt himself getting lighter. He felt himself imagining the gentle joy of coming to work in Diagon Alley every day, learning wandlore, working with wood. “I don’t care about money. Are you asking me to apprentice to you?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “I just haven’t been paying attention to that, lately.”
“Isn’t it supposed to be purple?”
“Hermione,” Harry said, as if he was planning to ask something — no. Bollocks.
, at last.”
Harry felt tears prickle his eyes. So many years of trying to be someone other than the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the Saviour. Trying to find his place in the world and forget his terrible power and anything resembling destiny. And he’d won, in so many ways. Here, in his shop, creating things instead of destroying, using his magic in gentle and artistic pursuits. But Draco?
“What sort of band is playing?” Harry asked.
Draco had a clinical supervisor. It was only appropriate; he wouldn’t work with anyone who was rash enough not to have one themselves. A clinical supervisor was always an interesting combination of a therapist and a teacher.
“Oh, I didn’t mean you,” Harry said, hand on his heart, eyes wide. And then: “Six inches? I hadn’t taken you for a modest one, Draco.”
around the office. “I wanted to ask you something. I can’t tell you about Harry’s treatment.”
“Harry sodding Potter, the Gryffindor git, married to Draco even-more-sodding Malfoy, Pureblood Prince of Slytherin. I wouldn’t even believe it if I hadn’t just watched them get their hands all tied together like… oh, no, it wasn’t a sex thing, was it? Ribbon’s not that sturdy —”
“Think I’ll go and have a shower,” Draco said, eventually. “Want to join me?”
They were staring at each other. Harry felt a flicker of something warm over his spine. Draco’s mouth was so close to his eyes, and he could look, couldn’t he? When he was smiling, Draco’s mouth looked —
“I forgot to thank your mother,” Harry said, much too formally, and apparently having forgotten he’d thanked her several times. “I shall owl her before I go to bed.”
There was laughter in Blaise’s voice, but his eyes were warm and sincere, when he looked up from Hermione’s hand to her face. “Blaise Granger has a ring to it.”
“No,” Draco answered, frowning. “A prat would have laughed at me. You… you were… I think you were afraid. And there’s more than one reason that could have been. I’m curious as to which it was.”
The mood in the room was shifting. Hermione reached up to brush her fingers over his hand. Everyone was tense. Worse than tense. Harry could feel it; not only the discomfort but the agreement. There were many in the audience who would have killed one person to save others, rather than save one to risk others. They hated themselves for it, a bit, but they still felt that way. And there were others who could not have made that choice. Who would have fought for every life, no matter how many that choice cost them. Hermione sat with tears sparkling in her eyes. Harry reached down to squeeze her shoulder, flashing a smile before he looked up at the rest of the room again.
Harry wanted to laugh. They couldn’t have looked much less like Harry and Malfoy, but they couldn’t have looked much more like them, either.
“I thought you said you didn’t want to talk about it.”
She didn’t have a name, yet. Or rather, the Shopkeeper at the Magical Menagerie said her name was Lenore, and she was much too goofy for a name that sophisticated. She was a lovely tawny thing with enormous eyes which were very, very expressive, even for an owl.
No. Draco was never doing this again. He’d tried, he’d failed, and he was done.
“I’ll show you to your quarters,” she said, as Harry summoned his trunks to follow them into the castle. “I am very glad you agreed to join us, Harry.” That she said nothing more suggested she had talked at length with Delilah Shacklebolt, and Harry found he didn’t mind.
“You know as well as anyone… better than most,” Blaise said, letting her slip from his grip. “There was nothing but evil, the last year that Malfoy Manor existed. Pansy tried to talk him into selling the land. She thought Muggles might not be able to feel it. That ugliness. And he needed the money — he didn’t inherit the Black fortune until years after he’d disappeared,” Blaise said.
“I did. I don’t think Crookshanks knows quite what to make of… her? Him?”
. The Ancient and Most Noble House of Black has a staff again.” He put his arm out to press against the shoulder of the elf wearing the pillowcase. “Hennie,” he said. Hennie stood up very straight, trembling slightly. “And Gertie. Gertie is wanting to be paid, Master Potter.”
“Thank you,” he said, into her shoulder.
In the last week of January, Harry helped Ron and Hermione move into their new house. In the first week of February, Ron and Hermione helped Harry move into the rooms above the shop, which was… a much better size for one person to live in, but which still had a couple of spare rooms for visitors, and a large attic where he could keep all of Sirius’s things.
Draco tried to scream because there was no one to beg for help, and because he was utterly trapped. Until —
Draco shrugged. “Some people don’t like to ask for help. It sounds like he has been keeping a great deal inside for a very long fucking time. I don’t think it’s entirely fair for you to blame yourself, Hermione.”
“I know someone you could talk to about that,” he said, far too quickly. “I’ll get her to Floo you or something. Now, what else do you want to look at? Only I have to get back to the shop.”
“Oh!” Topher said, swinging in his chair and crossing his arms on the table. “I heard a rumour about you, Ronald.”
He made his way downstairs, to find Harry frozen in front of a smoking frying pan. Draco flicked his wand at the flame beneath it, reducing it to a slower cook. Harry looked at it, and blinked helplessly.
“Something you’re looking for, mate?”
The Room of Requirement was never going to be usable again. The FiendFyre was trapped inside, and couldn’t escape, but it would burn for as long as Hogwarts stood. Harry and Draco spent most of the weekend trying to find a suitable location for the Duelling Club meetings. They needed mats. Space. Safety equipment. Eventually, in an almost lost wing of the castle, they found a large room that appeared to have been abandoned. Three very helpful elves promised to get the room clean in time for the first meeting the following Monday night.
By the time they landed again, a short distance from the castle, they were drenched with sweat, freezing cold, and laughing from the sheer fucking joy of it.
Draco knew he had changed, in a lot of ways, and most certainly for the better. But there were things that had not changed, and among them, this:
“This was my fault,” she said, with a sigh. “I worked him too hard. I let others work him too hard. I didn’t see the signs, I… I’ve spent the last several months carefully cataloguing everything that I’ve ever done wrong where Harry is concerned and it is a very long list. I want to tell him to leave the DMLE and, I don’t know, become a baker, or — become nothing, spend his days lazing in the sun or something but the entire Department is a mess without him.”
“Mum and Dad are in Romania, visiting Charlie,” Ron said, with a frown. A moment later, Ginny stepped out of the Floo as well, with a big smile on her face and a dramatic undercut on one side of her head. “Gin! I heard you’re the starting Seeker next week?”
Draco shook his head. “I can do that tomorrow while you work,” he said, looking faintly embarrassed.
Harry and Ron sat in the dark living room after one such night when Ron had been woken while he was trying to climb out a window.
“In this political climate? You have to be joking, Harry.” Andromeda cast a warming charm over her grandson. “I wouldn’t be here myself if you hadn’t convinced me I’d regret it one day. Maybe you were right.”
“How many times must I ask you to call me Delilah?”
Ron and Harry looked at each other, and Harry felt a thrill of genuine excitement for the first time in months. He had a house; it was not in good repair, and he certainly didn’t think he could spend the rest of his life there, but it would be a good and useful thing to do for now.
“Eight, perhaps?”
Draco ran his fingers through his hair, and stifled a yawn; he glanced at the clock and found it was still too early for him to sleep well, creature of habit that he was. But the book in his lap was getting impossible to read, the letters swimming and wriggling in front of his eyes. He took his readings glasses off, folded them neatly and placed them on the side table.
Harry looked up into the bright and now startled eyes of Pansy Parkinson. For a moment, they stared at each other and didn’t say a word.
Tosser or not, Potter had led a pretty sodding miserable life. This didn’t seem like a very fair way for it to end.
It was so painfully self-indulgent, sharing that. But Draco couldn’t find it in him to regret it. He had been pulled back into the world of Harry sodding Potter and he didn’t intend to leave unless he was asked to.
“I hate you.”
Harry swallowed, hard, and shook his head. And then nodded.
But she was up the stairs, and Ron was only a moment behind her, and Hermione shot Harry an apologetic look. “You should have owled," she said. “You know what those two are like, Harry…”
“I did not. Another cup?”
A sheet of parchment slipped elegantly under the door to Harry’s room and neatly into Draco’s grasp.
, and break his fucking heart, and I have to start all over again.” Draco dragged his fingers through his hair repeatedly. He pasted the map to the table with a temporary sticking charm, and lit his wand again.
“I hope so. I think so,” Hermione said, and she indicated a chair at her little meeting table, before casting
“I’d like to cook you something fancy.” Draco climbed to his feet, pulling Harry along to the kitchen.
love potions hidden in chocolate.”
“That’s great, Harry. Really,” Ron said, and Harry suddenly remembered he had papers to mark, and he excused himself, hugging them both before stepping into the Floo.
There was only one person he intended to ask, and he felt very certain the answer would be yes.
(It was still very strange to Harry how readily she had accepted that the reason they hadn’t worked out was that he’d figured out at long last that he was — in Ginny’s words, telling the entire Weasley clan the following evening — as gay as a hat full of butterflies. He’d laughed as hard as the rest of them, and while he’d had a moment of panic, it was good to get it out of the way in one fell swoop.
“Is he alright?”
“Apparently you’ve been paying close attention to what happens in the DMLE,” Harry said, with a smile. “I would think you had a lot more to concern yourself with, Minister.”
Draco led Harry out to the front patio to watch the enchanted snow fall. In Narcissa wanted a white Christmas, she made one herself.
“I haven’t aggravated Minister Shacklebolt nearly enough, this year, Mr Potter. Say no more.” She sat quietly for a moment, after writing herself a note. “Tell me, Mr Potter — have you given any thought to what you might do next? After graduation?”
“Do you promise you don’t hate me?”
It had been a long time since he’d last been laid. Other than… well, he really wasn’t sure if that counted, though the memory of Harry’s eyes on him in the kitchen was enough to make Draco’s cock stir again. Already, like he was a fucking teenager.
“That’s not what I meant.”
“Harry, dear,” Narcissa said, sweeping majestically across the room to take his hand, and offer her cheek to be kissed. “What do you think?”
“I can’t wait to hear,” Emrys replied, in his thick Welsh accent. He was attractive — tall, and heavy-boned, and utterly comfortable in his skin, a trait Draco had always envied. If he hadn’t been married — and straight — Draco might have found himself crossing that line as well. Apparently these days there were no lines he could claim to hold sacred.
“She’s dead,” Harry said, his mouth dry.
“Er,” he said.
Draco and Neville shared a look. Harry could feel them shift, and then back again.
“He’s well fit, for an older guy, you know. Improving with age, my ma says.”
He did not visit Draco’s rooms that night. He went to bed early, so he could wake early and head into Diagon Alley.
been having fun, all those years, out partying every weekend, and he was surprised he had been able to keep a job at St. Mungo’s when he had to have been perpetually hung over.
“Sneaky,” Harry agreed. And then he leaned in, and took Draco’s hands. He was gentle, but firm; he was certain, and the his power thrummed around him again, so strong and warm and beautiful that it made Draco’s chest ache. Harry held his gaze as his large, calloused hands covered both of Draco’s. He closed his eyes for a moment when he lifted Draco’s hands to his lips, and kissed them. Knuckles, and then fingers, and then the backs of his hands, as if he was something incredibly precious.
There were fifteen students staying behind; four Slytherin, seven Ravenclaw (three related), and two students each from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. There were a handful of staff as well, including Harry and Draco. Without discussion they assembled at the Ravenclaw table and feasted heartily. Harry sat by Draco, and Draco didn’t pull away when their thighs touched. He was barbed, and quiet, and affectionate, endured the gentle teasing of the students and laughed when the headmaster made her very festive hat light up with fireflies.
“That would be the one. There was a ball that Christmas. He took me, but he ignored me all night. Still, he’s a good man. I hope you… Well, you know what I hope. We’d all be dead without him.”
“I am sorry about your husband, Mrs Malfoy. I’m sorry about so much.”
Draco grunted.
“Narcissa, please,” she said, though her tone was no less formal than it had been.
Draco felt a sharp, vicious pang.
would have,” she amended meekly. “He’s never turned anyone away who needed his help.”
“Yes.” Harry’s face burned. “And I —”
“I want to kiss every inch of you,” Harry said, climbing up onto the bed, kissing Draco’s hip. “Fuck, d’you know what you look like.”
And then he left.
. He’d been told that his name on that stupid scrap of parchment was a binding contract, and he had no choice.
Zabini winked at him. “Happy Christmas, Potter. See you on the thirty-first,” he replied, as he tossed the powder into the Floo and stumbled in, shouting an approximation of his address.
Moments later she came through and held Harry tight. He didn’t cry. He felt as if he should, but he didn’t. Maybe it would happen later, or maybe he was just done crying when people died; there had been such a lot of it, after all.
for the people I love.”
“I will. As much as you need.”
Harry startled again, and when he looked down the hallway, there was Kreacher, looking utterly starstruck (or at least as starstruck as it was possible to be, for an elf of Kreacher’s disposition).
He closed the door behind him and called out for Scamp, tying his order to her foot and offering her a scrap of dried meat as compensation.
Harry felt as if he’d gone deaf, for a moment. “You don’t —”
Harry seemed to accept that in the spirit in which it was intended. He looked relieved.
“Yes, Harry?”
Ron and Hermione ate greasy hamburgers at the table at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, for the first time in over two decades. Ron looked over the parchments and puzzled over what hidden rooms there might be in the house.
Draco spent the day catching up on other things, and occasionally checking to see if Harry had made any further progress towards waking up. He Owled Hermione Granger to tell her that Harry was awake while politely swearing to break both of her legs if she came to see him before Draco had given his permission. He notified essential hospital staff of Harry’s condition and since he was on a roll with the threats, he promised to break all of
“Oh, yes,” she said, confidently. “I do. Partly because people I love and trust have told me that for my whole life — my mother and father, Morgana bless them. And you, and Ginny and Hermione, and Ron, and Lavender Brown — she is positively thriving as a werewolf, did you know? Has a little school for them and everything, and they go to Hogwarts if they have good control. And Finn and Grayson, who are at least as amazing as I am, and perhaps even a little bit more.”
“Mostly?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “I can assure you he’s no longer my patient, but he’s also no longer within reaching distance, so—”
“Alright. We’re going to start this lesson by talking through some of the work we will be doing this semester,” he said, feeling quite pleased with himself. And when, ninety minutes later, the class was finished, he sat behind his desk, feeling
“Not really. No, I mean it, Harry. He… assumed I knew things that you… why didn’t you ever tell us?”
Neville beamed at Harry. “It really is,” he said. “G’night, Harry. G’night, Draco. Cheers for that.”
Draco turned around, something of the old nervous teenager on his face again, biting his lip, unsure what to do, where to put his hands. He slipped the robe off and hung it on a coat-hook next to the fireplace.
Once inside Draco’s bedroom Harry realised he was idiotically wearing boots with about fifty holes for laces, which was very fucking inconvenient, but an issue rendered moot when the intense desire to be naked, to be able to look at Draco and touch him everywhere meant that his own magic swirled out and the rest of their clothing fell from their bodies. They didn’t have to pause in their kissing; the kisses got hotter, and dirtier, and hungrier, and Harry couldn’t make his hands stay in one place; he set his thumbs against the sharp grooves of Draco’s hips, gripped his arse hard, ran his palms up over Draco’s back, counting every bump.
Harry had nothing to say to that. He took another bottle of beer and chilled it, passing it to Draco once it was open.
“And then, I’ll do this,” Draco said, more seriously, He angled his head just so, and leaned the last couple of inches until he could taste Harry’s mouth. Warm and wet and pliant, willing and needy. Draco felt Harry’s hips roll beneath him. “Do you need a parchment? So you can take notes?”
And it was wonderful, as it always was; the girls climbed over Harry like he was a jungle gym and painted his fingernails, the conversation was fun and easy. And then when Gabrielle took the girls to bed, Harry and Ron set up a chess board.
“We’ll try it again. Perhaps on the weekend, with no one around who might startle you. I have some seventh year students who sometimes do their own work quietly on a Saturday afternoon. I’m sure you’d be welcome.”
. Hmm.” He paused a few long moments. “Doesn’t explain why you’d tell
Draco sat beside him. Not too close, not close enough to touch, perhaps make Harry run away, but he sat close.
It was a fifth-year class, the first one. Harry seemed to remember that fifteen year olds were a particularly cranky bunch.
Harry turned back to Professor McGonagall. “I’ll need to destroy both the bottle and the crystal ball. Not tonight; I’ll need time to prepare. Why isn’t his mail checked? Mine is.”
“Much obliged,” Draco replied drily. “The elf does bitch and moan.”
“As it so happens I know the best Healer in that particular area of medicine. She is about a hundred and twenty years old, and bald as a bat, except for the tufts of grey hair that sprout from her ears. A delight to chat with, though.”
After lunch, Andromeda did her best to squeeze recipes out of Molly for things picky children might be convinced to eat, as Teddy had recently stopped eating everything that was put in front of him. Molly did her best, but as all seven Weasley children had been very easy to feed, she had little advice.
When they stepped out of the Floo at Twelve Grimmauld Place, Hermione’s mouth dropped open in horror.
“Because,” Harry said, “if we did it in Italy, we’d have an entire clan of Weasleys to entertain for a week, in addition to the Minister for Magic and her security entourage, Luna Lovegood and her boyfriends trying to decide what order to do things by the stars, and —”
“It has stopped responding,” she said, wringing her hands.
, must be
Auror Lisbon leaned closer. “So, the week before he left, we were on a stakeout. For days, mind you; we were supposed to be swapping out, but they put up new wards, no one could get in. And me, I couldn’t stay awake. But Potter — I suppose it’s the practice, isn’t it? Still as could be and still awake. Told me he knew a spell. When you’re about to fall asleep, it zaps you awake. Sounds fucking horrible, but he said it helped. Said he’d teach it to me sometime.”
“I’m not,” Draco said, seriously again. “You’re the biggest idiot I’ve ever known, but you’re very brave. Which is the same thing, sometimes. You’re quick with defensive spells and you’re always trying to save everyone else, because you’re a sodding martyr, raised for self-sacrifice by Dumbledore himself.”
Harry blanched.
“Are you
“I don’t know,” Hermione said. “Shh, it’s starting.” Harry had attended many funerals in the previous months, even years, but never a pureblood one like this. There was only silence, when Malfoy shook his head and declined to speak, and after a few moments of awkward waiting, Narcissa’s coffin was entombed in a marble case, which was swallowed up by the earth.
Draco took a breath.
“Er,” Harry said. In all honesty he wasn’t a great reader. “Mostly homework. Some educational theory, for class planning. Or when I need to be bored to sleep.”
He felt the warm brush of Harry’s magic before he opened the door, and closed his eyes, letting it warm him. Harry, apparently, was healthier than he had been in some time; the crackle and glow of that singular signature was unmistakable.
The man had looked at him like he might be terribly dangerous. Perhaps he looked dangerous. His hair was worryingly long and straggly. He hadn’t made any attempt to do anything but keep it clean since he’d fallen asleep months before. Harry had never known that past a certain length his own hair could begin to curl at the ends. He liked it. It wasn’t practical. It was no less messy than it had ever been but he didn’t feel compelled to make it behave, anymore.
Half an hour later, the pain was undeniably beginning to subside.
“Can I? I swear, we’ll go slower, next time — I just need to be inside you, Draco. Can I?”
Ginny dropped onto the couch by Draco. “And I’ll drag all the gossip out of this one while you do it.”
my house angry at the same time.”
Harry wrote a note to Molly, and another to Hermione and Ron, and finally to George. He told them all what he’d done so impulsively and told them that if they thought it was a mistake, they needed only to say the word and he would rescind the invitation.
“Hullo, Henny,” he said. “Can you please see that these are destroyed? Don’t let anyone eat them. Thank you. I’ll bring you another scarf next time I visit Hermione.”
They both froze, and Potter couldn’t help but glance at the Mark again. Draco sighed. “I’m not sure everyone shares that perspective, but I’ll leave it. For now.” He folded himself elegantly into the second armchair and summoned their glasses back, landing one at Potter’s elbow and one in his own hand. “And it’s not about what anyone else thinks, Potter,
Harry carefully folded a polishing cloth into the white box and settled the wand inside. “You’ll need to keep it tucked away until school starts, I’m afraid,” he said, as he passed it to Daisy. “Enjoy school, Miss Parkinson.”
He tossed a pinch of powder into the Floo and kneeled on the hearth, calling out an address.
“I look forward to having input on the design of my statue in the Ministry,” Draco said drily. “Next, the windows.”
The Hogwarts Express was pulling away from the station, and Draco had reached his absolute limit. Harry could feel it. Andromeda, too. Draco’s lip quivered a moment and he dissolved into tears.
“I made such a mess of being a Wizard,” he murmured into Harry’s chest. “Everyone hates me, and they’re right to. But I couldn’t make it out there, either. And I didn’t want to ruin your life. You’ve been through enough. You’ve done enough.” But he didn’t pull away. Harry slipped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and let him keen quietly against his bare chest. “I didn’t mean to take your magic.”
“Yes, but —”
And then she came up with a little plan. A stalling plan, but a plan nonetheless.
“I haven’t said I’ll go,” Harry retorted.
“Right now, I will only say this: Defensive and Offensive actions are not a sum game. This is a chance for you all to figure out what you are good at. And Dra — Professor Malfoy and I will demonstrate first. Professor?”
“I think you meant ‘convalesce’.”
The first night, only students in fifth to seventh year were allowed. Harry and Draco had spent far too much time discussing various aspects of the way they would manage things, and not enough time thinking about how to keep the younger students out, but ultimately decided that there would need to be two clubs, a second for the second to fourth year students.
He didn’t anticipate a visit before lunch, but he couldn’t pretend he didn’t feel a little thrill of something when Malfoy stuck his head in the door.
It was remarkably easy, Harry reflected, as he finally found his seat (mercifully he was next to Hermione, and had Parvati on his other side) to deflect all the thousands of questions that had been aimed at him as he had mingled in the entry, where drinks and canapés were served and the press swarmed like bats. He hated knowing that there would be photographs of him in every Wizarding publication in Europe and possibly the world the following day, but he had a strange sense of ease, as well. No one would really be expecting the events of this night.
He shivered. He’d let the fire die down. He tossed a quick charm at the fireplace to stoke the flames, and made his way to the outer door. It was Neville Longbottom.
“Fancy,” she said, her tone unimpressed, but her expression fond and her eyes soft. “I would say that you have recovered… probably ninety percent of your magical function, at this point. The rest might return slowly, but if not, you’ll have to deal with only being on the top four or five strongest Witches and Wizards in the world instead of being an insufferably definite number one.”
By unspoken agreement, the three of them shared Harry’s bed that night, Hermione in the middle, Ron’s chest pressed to her back, her head on Harry’s shoulder. But it took Harry a long time to get to sleep.
Harry’s eyes closed. The sensation was far too much, after so long, and he truly couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept with someone he actually fancied. And when, he wondered, as he settled his hands on Draco’s hips, had that happened? At what point had he decided ‘
Draco grinned. Harry was much more fun when he was feeling snarky.
Draco, for his part, only looked relieved to have something to do that might stop people from talking to him. He sat delicately on the arm of a couch and began to tune the strings. They were old. Two snapped, and he hissed as he withdrew his hand, which bore a deep scratch across the back.
“No,” Harry said, alarmed. Draco was already halfway up the stairs. “Draco. No! Malfoy, no, don’t,” and he was running up the stairs behind Draco but it was like one of those terrible dreams where you can’t move fast enough, and Draco was already up on the landing. “Draco!”
Narcissa smiled coyly. “I shall have them sent to you tomorrow.” She took a sip of the wine, and closed her eyes a moment, savouring it. An older couple paused by the table to give her a disgusted look, and she smiled aristocratically at them, before turning back to Draco. “Don’t, darling. We will never stoop to their level. Remember who we are.”
He looked at the place where he had been standing when Draco had fallen to his knees, and he felt a burning in his throat. He stepped quickly out of the kitchen lest his posture betray him.
you spill it.”
“When did you start calling him by his first name?”
“I’ve been so fucking blind. How could I have missed that things were this bad?”
Suddenly, Harry looked both younger and much, much older, unsure of himself. Draco felt his heart clench. What did a boy who’d grown up under the stairs know about good design, or how nice it was just for things to look pretty? Harry must have thought he’d ascended to Merlin’s Kingdom when he’d arrived at Hogwarts, with the big, comfortable beds, and overstuffed sofas, cushions everywhere. Draco could see it, suddenly.
He felt a smile curl his features. He didn’t really need to do anything but watch, now, and be ready to steer when steering was needed. If it was needed. And in the moment he made that decision, he felt everything warm a little more. His robes, his skin, the tattooed marks over the backs of his hands and his shoulders, his ribs, all the marks that helped him to ease into the most curious of conundrums, seeking answers to the deepest mysteries, unraveling labyrinths and seeing into the souls of things.
She nodded, slumping in her chair, as he walked gracefully to the door.
Harry stepped closer still. His face was wary, but he had slipped his wand back into his robes seemingly without thought.
Harry thought of
“If this was nothing more than a plan to sneak back into my bed so you could steal a wand, it was a very stupid plan. You could’ve nicked one when you left the first time, saved yourself the trouble of coming back.”
“Mr Potter,” he said. He reached for the wand, found its centre of balance, and gave it a regal little wave. “Exquisite work, my boy. Exquisite.” He brought the end of the wand to his eye, looking down toward the tip. Harry knew it was a wand that needed to be straight and it was. Ollivander’s hand shook a little. He passed the wand reverently back to Harry.
, anything at all. Harry could feel it. He felt the dragon herself. She had been old, strong, fiercely protective over generations before she’d died in a dark, cool valley surrounded by her daughters and granddaughters and great-granddaughters. It had been Charlie Weasley who had sent Harry the heartstrings. There had been tears blurring words on the parchment. Charlie protected and helped the dragons and they in turn let him harvest the parts of themselves that were useful to Wizardkind, before the family burned the remains.
It hadn’t been easy in the beginning but when he had forced himself to stop wondering about the time he’d quickly found it was a lovely way to exist.
Hermione sat straight in her chair. “He said he can’t teach anyone to make a wand if they don’t already know how, didn’t he. Oh, Harry — did he?” Hermione’s eyes were wide with excitement. “What did he say?”
“I wouldn’t bet against you,” Harry agreed. “And you’ll do a splendid job. Auror training.”
“Show me the other parchment, then,” she said.
Sumer, again.
“How about we go and get some lunch, then?” Harry said, panic sharpening his voice. “The Leaky, perhaps.”
“I take it to understand that you disapparated from the front porch.”
“Wait,” she said, hurriedly rushing for her desk. She pulled out a small leather satchel. “I made you this. You said you wanted to take some things from the house. And maybe from his office. I’m rather good with Undetectable Extension Charms. This will make it easier to get everything back.”
“You can take that stick out of your arse,” she said, “and tell me how long you have been working for me.”
“Oh?”
“So is this,” Draco replied, raising the book before his hand lowered again, in stages, like he wasn’t sure what to do with it.
Harry was fit to burst; no one invited anyone into his room without his say-so. And yet, as four people, two witches and two wizards, poured into his classroom and stood blinking in horror and intrigue at his room, he realised there was no point in arguing.
Narcissa waited patiently. Draco saw the slight downturn of the corner of her mouth that suggested she was very disappointed to be back to ‘Mrs Malfoy’ already, but he guessed Harry wouldn’t adjust to something like that very quickly.
Harry sighed. He wished very much that he hadn’t opened this particular can of worms. The last thing he needed was Draco fucking Malfoy to feel sorry for him. And just when they were getting along better, too. He scratched at his forehead.
Part of him thought that the sensible thing to do next was to disapparate home; it wasn’t as if the wards here were especially effective against him. But he didn’t. He sat down, instead, and calmly reached for his glass.
“Harry, where do you want to meet for our lunch date on Tuesday?” Hermione asked brightly as she wrapped her scarf around her neck. Harry was about to ask what she was talking about when he saw that familiar steel in her eyes.
“Alright,” Draco said, with a smile, his entire body thrumming with need. He glanced at the furniture. “I don’t usually consult up here.”
He conjured images of Ginny in his mind, trying to remember what it was like to want soft curves in his hands, and all he could imagine was a hard body, slim and tall and taut, wiry blond hair in tight curls around a prick he could only assume was as gorgeous as —
Their eyes caught. That had not come out the way that Draco had intended it, surely? And yet — he looked calm, and confident, and the way he held his upper body made Harry want to crawl under the fucking table and loosen those stupidly flattering trousers, suck until Malfoy couldn’t speak English anymore.
“Potter, I handed the title over to the Ministry. I hardly expected them to turn it into a museum honouring my illustrious family’s contributions to Wizarding society.”
“Then?”
He wrote.
“I think we’ve been very patient, Ron, don’t you?”
Harry tensed. “We don’t all require large rooms and fancy carpet, Malfoy. We didn’t all grow up in mansions. You and I don’t share tastes, and that’s fine.”
And then, for two years, he had been utterly fucking aimless.
“Not really. I like my life here.”
“The doors don’t open.”
say she can. Not you. You are the patient, Ha— Pot… Auror Potter?” Draco gave him an assessing look.
When she emerged from the room a while later, Draco was sitting at his desk, writing notes in a journal in his beautiful script. He gave her a small smile.
He sat at his drab desk and stared at the broom in the corner and wondered if Draco was right. About some of it, at least.
Luc’s eyes flashed. He did understand. He’d always known their deal. No strings, no sleepovers and no attachments. Partly because Luc worked elsewhere in the hospital but mostly because Draco had never had much interest in strings, sleepovers or attachments. And when they did go out, he preferred not to plan who to go home with until the absolute last minute.
“I’m going to open you up on my fingers, now. I’m going to take my time, make you so open and wet for me… so that I can slide in and out of you fast, hard, make you scream for me.” He slipped his finger into Harry’s mouth. “Suck it like I suck your cock, Harry, get it nice and wet for me.”
“Aesop,” the boy replied, looking cheered to have the conversation. “He’s a good owl. My family lives in Australia. He flies a very long way, but he’s never once complained. And he brings me Tim-tams.”
effort to be tactful. “Pimples, or a hex? I don’t remember you looking quiet this spotty last week.”
“Do you think we should try to talk to him?” Harry murmured.
Draco shrugged. “I heard you were friends, that’s all.” He pulled a drawer open, and flipped through the files. He didn’t really care about any of them. This wasn’t a potion gone wrong or a misfired hex. Harry had decided to get down low and stay there, but Draco needed the time to poke around in his office.
The following day, Harry presented the envelope to Kingsley Shacklebolt. Kingsley read over the contents several times.
And in the meantime, Harry was busy. Training four Seekers (he thought it was only fair to train them all, as he wasn’t the head of any house, and didn’t want to advantage anyone). He had seven grades worth of essays and assorted homework to read, and mark, and discuss with some students. Duelling Club, of course, and preparing for Duelling Club, and thinking about the sparkle in Draco Malfoy’s eyes at Duelling Club —
Amelia Hubbard was her name. In her first year, she had annoyed Draco rather a lot. He wanted to shake her, sometimes, and ask why she wouldn’t pay attention; but being as he was afraid that if he couldn’t curb his temper he would lose this teaching post, he carefully reigned it in. Within a few weeks he had cajoled her into trusting him a little bit, but she remained an appalling student, caught often between moments of such terror the she didn’t seem able to hear Draco, let alone do anything that had been asked of her, and then trying to catch up so quickly that she would miss instructions and misread ingredients.
Back at Hermione’s house he turned on the WWN, humming along tunelessly to songs he didn’t know the lyrics to, and soon the house smelled like onions sautéed in butter. He sang and he chopped a variety of interesting mushrooms, and as he sweated the rice, and it was only when his face began to ache that he realised that he’d been smiling for hours.
“I do.”
Potter looked as if he had something to say to that, but in the end, he shrugged and returned to his breakfast. His arm was curved around the plate again, but he seemed to notice Draco noticing, and pulled it back a little.
Draco stared at his notes for a while. “So, about that drink?”
But that didn’t make it less real.
It had been the first home he’d ever known.
“I try to manage without it,” Harry said, quietly, and sounding very much like he was ashamed to have been caught out. “It’s not good to take too much.”
He sipped his tea, and opened the paper.
Ron’s eyebrows shot up.
should care. Raised by wolves, weren’t you. Not everyone is born with taste, but it’s not a
“How on earth did I convince you that we should do this in England?” Draco growled, fretting over his tie in the full-length mirror and unnecessarily adjusting his formal robes. The latest thing, they’d said, a cross between a Muggle tuxedo and Wizard robes. Draco wasn’t convinced he liked them but he was convinced that he wanted to get married in the latest thing. Kreacher was shining his shoes and muttering under his breath.
“Please,” Harry said. He looked almost desperate.
“I’m simply speechless with shock. You? You’re the very definition of easy-going, Harry. Who would find working alongside the Saviour to be challenging?”
“I think it’s time I sought formal emancipation,” Draco said, though his voice was strangled and his face was pink.
Harry chewed his lip for a moment, hesitant.
Draco lowered his wand, an inch at a time, the Crucio disappearing from his tongue.
“Alright,” he called, hurrying now. He pictured Ron, hurt. Hermione, afraid. Andromeda, suddenly trapped with a four-year-old werewolf. He hurtled down the stairs, shivering, and stopped short at the front door. The blinds were closed from the inside.
Harry nodded, mute.
This perfect, dry, warm brush of lips was meant to test the base of it. Lust, or curiosity. Boredom, or friendship. Or love, perhaps, a true match. Draco ended the kiss, pulling an inch away and feeling rather than seeing Harry chase it for a moment, his eyes opening; the brightest green Draco ever wanted to see.
He looked younger, too, his hair paler, his face thinner.
on many of those faces.
“I suppose they’re all furious with me.”
So he wasn’t exactly impressed when a very insistent owl appeared at his windowsill and wouldn’t fuck off, despite him hollering at it to drop the letter on his doorstep, take it to the hospital or literally drop it in a fucking fireplace. He dragged himself across the room in aubergine sleep pants which hung dangerously from his hips, bare chest luminously white in the early morning gloom.
“Thanks for coming,” Luna said, as if he’d actually been invited and this had been planned. Or at least, as if he’d been expected. Perhaps he had been. “Bye, Harry.”
“I shall get you a thesauri-quill next time I’m in Flourish and Blotts, by the way; you need some new synonyms for prat.”
“You know you’re safe here with me.”
The thought of Ron and Hermione moving away to their new house near the Burrow set off all sorts of contradictory feelings, when he let himself think about it at all. He had loved living with them so long, but he knew that after the wedding in February they would want time to be alone. Meanwhile, the shop was starting to feel more like
“I’m rubbish at gifts,” Harry admitted, with a sigh. “D’you suppose Draco needs a… a new snitch, perhaps? One of those ones that comes ack when you call it?”
“Harry,” Draco said.
“I fancy a sausage, though. Maybe down in the larder.”
“I’m glad you and Draco found each other again,” she said, after a long time, and Harry felt his face flush. “Oh, don’t worry, Harry, no one’s been telling secrets. It’s your aura. I’m quite clever at those. When you thought about him at school your aura picked up a little of his colour, some greenish silver in your roaring golden light. Now, you’re positively glowing with it. It’s marvellous, really. I’m pleased.” She leaned against his arm and shoulder. “Maybe that’s why you’re so warm, too. Not sharp and spiky and cold. You’ve lost a lot of your
Harry chuckled. “You might be on to something, there. But this boy — I don’t really know how to say it, but… well, things got complicated, you know? I think by the time I started thinking we should have been friends, so much had happened that I didn’t know what I could do to change any of it. We were… rivals. Enemies, in a way. Though I don’t think either of us knew what that meant, really. We just… fought. I suppose in retrospect the mutual stalking and appalling behaviour should have told me something important but I missed it at the time. For a long time, actually.”
He sat. He thought. He was quite certain that all of the thinking was connected in one way or another. He let it stir his mind and ripple across his robes. He felt the sun bake it into his skin.
“I admit Harry Potter,” he said resolutely. “I warded this when I was a child. Came in handy that…
Harry felt guilty, for a moment; the last few months he had seen less of his godson than he usually did. But Teddy appeared nothing but delighted to be in his arms, not grumpy or resentful, delightful child that he was, chatting animatedly about the kittens in the backyard at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Draco, unaware of Harry’s guests, threw the door open and began to descend the stairs, babbling about laundry before stopping to gape, his face purpling.
“And you just assumed this patient was a he.”
Harry lost track of the time. He often did. Outside in Diagon Alley the rain fell heavily, and the thunder clapped, and lightning made the street as bright as day for a moment at a time. The dragon who had given her heartstring for this wand was pleased by it.
“I —” Harry said. “Yes.”
“Who was your partner?”
Molly kissed his cheek. “I’ll start asking around.” She pressed a small, brightly wrapped package into Harry’s hand. “Put it aside. In case he ever comes back.”
Harry’s eyes sparkled appealingly, for a moment. “Alright, Draco, next time I receive anonymous chocolates by post I will give them to you and Neville.”
“Hermione would probably have a stroke and die if she saw this.”
“It doesn’t matter what you give Draco for Christmas,” she said. “He’ll love it.”
one was actually focused on his uni studies and genuinely as big a nerd as his glasses advertised, which was quite appealing.
“No, I always let out a good hearty yelp at this time of the morning. I find it to be very cathartic.”
When the sorting was done and the tables began to groan under the weight of the platters which had suddenly appeared, Draco turned to Neville, on his left, to enquire about his summer. He was singularly pleased when he felt a prickle of surprise from his right; but if Potter hadn’t paid enough attention at school to understand the importance of the relationship between the Herbology Master and the Potions Master, he was likely to be decidedly more discomfited by the expected partnership between the Potions Master and the Defence Against the Dark Arts Instructor.
So maybe
“Let me know when there’s news,” Ginny said. She squeezed Hermione’s shoulder. “And stop fucking blaming yourself. That’s all any of us do, isn’t it? Blame ourselves, instead of putting it where it belongs. When Harry gets back he’s going to need you. Just as you are. Not crying on him and blubbering a thousand apologies.”
Hangover cure.
“Ollivander thinks it’s because I mastered so many wands in quick succession. And because I’m so — …
He placed it carefully in a long box, marked the end, and set it aside. The owner of such a wand would be an unusual person indeed; no need for it to be placed with the general stock.
“I am,” Ollivander said. “You can start as soon as you like. I have a great deal to teach you.” He coughed into a handkerchief, and it took him long moments to calm his breathing again. “And I don’t believe I have all that much time to do so.”
“As far as we know, it’s the oldest Malfoy artefact in existence,” Draco said, as if it meant nothing. But his fingers twitched.
Harry stared at the knife in his hand; the handle was a snake, and the blade was carved with runes. As Harry stared at the handle, it flexed its wings. Not a snake; a Wyvern.
Professor Bennett left shortly afterwards; she complained that she had to unbox thirty teapots for practical work the following week, which Harry thought didn’t sound like too much work, until she added that they were in a classroom that had fallen into disuse because of a doxy infestation. Harry promised to help her, if she didn’t mind him keeping the doxies for a class the following week. Professor Bennett accepted cheerfully.
Harry nodded seriously each time, and Draco, for his part, pretended not to notice that Harry’s hands were shaking slightly and that he seemed to be waiting for a chance to say something that was on his mind.
Draco pushed the invitation back into Harry’s hand.
“I think I need some sleep,” he said.
Draco snorted. “You’re as good a liar at 37 as you were at 17. Which is to say not at all.”
“What happened that night?”
“One day I hope you get past the whole idea that everything is about owing someone. Look, they’ll leave, if I ask them to. You’re bound to be asked a thousand difficult questions, and…”
“Because,
He closed his eyes. He could feel Harry hovering. “It’s alright, Draco. It can wait.”
And then suddenly, the Castle was oppressively quiet.
Hermione studied his face, apparently looking for any sign of mockery. She wouldn’t find any.
Harry gave him a tired smile and nodded. “Milk and sugar is fine.”
Weird. Draco raised an eyebrow.
All around him, the house seemed to radiate her approval.
He tried to ignore Harry as he hesitated over the envelope. It felt like being students again. Watching Harry, trying to guess what Harry was thinking or planning to do, trying to interpret his body language. Until someone (usually Pansy) cast
He was itching to wake Draco up and ask what was happening. He didn’t, for the same reason he hadn’t the night before. Harry was reasonably sure Draco would vanish without a trace if he felt harassed, and then he’d never know what this — all of this — had been about.
“Can you show me, Harry?” he asked, and reached across to take Harry’s arm. Perhaps he could heal it. He knew enough wandless healing spells. He’d even created some.
Harry tensed.
’ and a ‘
Harry dragged a folded-up footstool out of his cupboard and pulled it into the kitchen, in front of the sink. And he began to run the water to wash the dishes, favouring his left arm but refusing to make a sound.
Harry closed his eyes. “Not today. I don’t want to talk about things today.”
“That’s what —” Hermione bit her lip, heart racing. Hadn’t Draco used almost those precise words? “No, I know. And when we get him back, things are going to be different, Gin.”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“It’s very good,” Hermione said, reaching for the glass.
,” Draco said, primly. “Stop ogling me, Harry, it’s not sixth year.”
“You had a partner?” Draco didn’t know why he was surprised. He supposed that without Granger or the Weasel there, Harry would have insisted on being a lone wolf. Also, he was jealous, but he didn’t have to admit it out loud, and if he didn’t admit it out loud then it wasn’t ever going to be true.
Blaise held his gaze, waiting for him to continue. Draco was finished, though, mouth set in a firm line until he raised his glass to his lips and almost drained it.
He was debating what else might amuse him for another hour or two when he heard a hesitant knock on the door of his classroom, past his rooms.
“Do you want to talk about that?” Draco asked, redundantly.
“I’ll need to speak to Mr Weasley, as well. Ron, specifically, I know there are a lot of them. Separately. I know the three of you are close, but if there is any chance at all that there are answers that might differ if you are together I need to keep you apart. This isn’t negotiable, I’m afraid. I’m sure you understand. Perhaps it would be easier if Ron took me to the house again.”
“Mmm. I could check.”
Surely if Draco could ask that of Harry, Harry could ask it of him, as well.
He could at times still be rather petty, though.
Harry shook himself out of his stupor.
“You haven’t had another package, have you?” Harry asked, looking up from his marking with a frown. “I thought your packages were coming to me, unless they were from your mum.”
“Arthur Weasley,” Harry said, pointing. “He and Molly already had children — she was at home with them, but she still fought in every way she could. Just like at the Battle of Hogwarts. Neville’s parents. See how he looks like his mother?”
Hermione nodded and leaned forward. Progress?” she asked.
“I’m going to marry you,” Harry said into Draco’s throat, fingers digging into his hips and arse. Draco would be covered in these fingertip bruises the next day. No, for the rest of his life, because Harry would keep putting them back long whenever they started to fade. “D’you know that, Draco? I’m going to make you my husband.”
Harry nodded. “And I was a right prat.”
. You’d never let anyone else treat themselves this way. Why do you deserve less?”
“Harry Potter,” Molly said. “That boy is as thin as a rake — and he has
“If you’re going to paw at me, perhaps we should take this elsewhere,” Draco said.
“In my office?” Harry was too wary of the spot checks to break a rule like that here.
Harry reached for his wand.
“He doesn’t need your apologies. He’ll just be glad to have you back.” Hermione stood as well. “But go ahead and invite him. I’ll have Blaise make arrangements for the food.”
“Okay.”
“If you repeat one single word of this to anyone, I’ll hex you,” Draco growled ineffectually. Neville didn’t look concerned. “No, I’ll poison everything in the greenhouse and set all your Mandrake roots free.”
“I’ve been invited to Malfoy Manor for Christmas Eve,” Harry said, awkwardly. “But I’ll be back the next day. Or, no, I’ll be back that night, of course. By Floo.”
“Goodnight,” Harry said, with a small smile, and Draco watched as he tucked a vial of the potion into his robes and disappeared.
“I don’t think I know quite what to do with you,” Draco said. He hadn’t expected to say it, though he had been thinking it. “You’re different.”
living room. The room where people
Draco served himself small portions of almost everything in front of him, listening to Neville natter on about a trip he’d taken to the Dead Sea to collect samples of dead plants and work out how exactly it was that they all behaved so very much like they were alive. Ordinarily, Draco would have been intrigued; the medicinal applications could be tremendously important. This evening, though, he was struck by the rather distressing observation that Harry Potter had not developed any sort of manners in the twelve years since they’d endured a final year together at Hogwarts. One arm curled possessively around the plate, and he shovelled the food into his mouth at an alarming rate.
“Sold,” Harry said. “The money was more helpful than the properties could have been. You did a good thing, you know.”
“Don’t start,” Blaise murmured quietly.
“Maybe I should try to bring Hermione down with you, but your menagerie of horrors might put the dear Minister’s knickers in something of a twist, d’you think? Maybe one of your actress girlfriends. Or Gisella Warbeck. Would you be trying to talk them out of their clothes? You know Gran- Hermione is the only one of your so-called friends who so much as hinted that the reason these fairy-tale romances of yours don’t end in… a fairy-tale romance is that you might prefer dating Gisella Warbeck’s brother. Though I’ve heard he’s a dreadful flirt who never puts out. Maybe you’ve got that in common. Cheeky bastard,” he added under his breath. He unbuttoned Harry’s shirt.
Harry was the next one to get them. In his nightmares, everyone he had ever loved was complicit. They didn’t come to stay with him as he moved from one world to the next, to comfort him; no, they just came to watch.
Hermione bristled. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
It was one of Harry’s, and a pretty thing. White oak and unicorn hair with a small rose quartz set into the handle. She looked dubious, but Harry smiled reassuringly, and she gave it a wave, making a sound of utter delight when rose-coloured sparks flowed from the end. “How does that feel?”
“Romantic tosh,” Draco said happily. “Don’t think for a second you’re shagging me on the couch, Harry Potter. Stairs. Now.”
“You could sell it. I could sell it for you. Get you an excellent price.”
Up close, Harry could see that Draco was wearing heavy eye makeup, and that he had sweated a lot of it off. Made him look like someone had swung by to corrupt his innocence or something, but Harry wasn’t sure that Draco had ever been allowed to have much of that. His eyes blazed. His skin was paler than ever, unless that was a trick of the light.
No first kiss is perfect. It takes time to find the right rhythm with someone new. But this kiss was very
than me needs to be the one to do it. Ron — I want a gentler life. I hope you can find a way to understand. You know what I’m like. I can see it now; hating my job and still running in ahead of everyone to make sure if anyone gets hurt, it’s me, and not them —”
The party was much, much worse.
Draco let out a shiver. “He sounds mental.”
He needn’t have worried. When Harry was in a good mood he was charming enough, and he was too Gryffindorish to be intimidated by this lot. Narcissa kept the conversation light, appropriate for the holiday, rolling her eyes if things became political, drawing the ladies into speculation about the fashion directions likely to reveal themselves at the New Year’s Eve celebrations the following week. The food was outstanding, and Harry’s hand didn’t curl around his plate once.
“I’ll call you Great-aunt Walburga, if it… scratch that. Don’t slow down, Potter, please…”
“Twice.”
Hermione made her way to the stones that once made a grand path to the door. Even here, tiny purple buds peered curiously into the warming air. They seemed to strain towards her, too, but Hermione had long since come to the conclusion that it was best to assume all plants were at least mildly sentient and be as nice to them as possible.
“Not so fast. I’m missing one piece of information.” Well, that was far from true; there were so many holes in this story that Potter might have actually fallen through one. “How was he found?”
Hermione looked even more tense.
He sat at the small round table and watched as Draco fussed over a pot of tea.
“Just a hair after four-thirty in the morning,” Harry said, exhausted. “How do you feel?”
Hermione shrugged, and poured, and pushed a cup across the table. “As far as I have been able to figure out,” she said. “What happened to that
When they had gone over every door and window in the place, Hermione could see the problem. If each was a riddle then each had been solved.
“Call me Ron. What’s the rumour?”
The receiving line was awful. Draco shook his hand as coldly and formally as he would have shaken McGonagall’s hand, and Harry wanted to disapparate on the spot. But he found his place, sitting opposite Draco for dinner, and did his best to contribute something to the conversation.
“I feel that I’ve given enough,” he said, at last, with a smile. It was a good smile. Not his bright ‘camera in my face, better look presentable’ smile, not his ’Teddy’s hair is the most wonderful shade of teal right now’ smile. It was a sure, adult smile. And it brooked no argument, despite the way that Robards’ face was going slowly purple.
“Well, we’ll find you something,” Ollivander said. He watched as Harry poured the tea. Harry only poured the cup to the half-way point, seeing how badly Ollivander’s hands shook.
“And Potter?”
“Why did you come here?”
Topher nodded, but didn’t say anything. He didn’t look like he was about to dissolve into some sort of Muggle-appropriate fit about it, or anything.
Hermione shook her head. “I didn’t. I… oh, I feel as if I should ask him back, but his little heart will break. What should I do?”
It was a little like using a Portkey. The pressure behind his navel, the sickening pull, and he was just —
“Ah. You need to make sure they have plenty of snacks. I will have one brought from the storeroom for you for next lesson.” One, Harry thought, that he would ensure had no scribbling in the margins.
It was pathetic, really. The number of things Harry remembered actually enjoying. It became an obsession. Trying to remember things he did at Hogwarts that didn’t involve fighting Tom Riddle, or trying not to die. Or when he’d still been an Auror, working insane hours and grateful for a few hours of sleep.
“It feels invasive, though.” Harry pulled his legs up beneath him.
He was expecting Malfoy to look angry. Or to be rolling his eyes, ready with a barb. But he looked… fuck it. He looked sad, and worried, and disappointed, and that was about a thousand times worse.
“Here,” Harry said. His voice sounded tired, and hollow, and disappointed.
“Charlie’s coming for Christmas,” Ron said with enthusiasm, and Harry and Hermione laughed at him. Hermione poured Harry another Firewhiskey, and they sat quietly for a while.
Draco climbed to his feet, and walked around the small mosaic coffee table that one of his patients had made him. She was an artist, a rather talented one. He took the other end of the settee and settled himself on it, leaning in.
“But,” Emrys said. And he paused. Draco poured more drinks. He poured too much. He wondered suddenly about writing himself off and then begging off sick tomorrow. “But. If you are the cream of the crop, and you are asked to treat someone you care for — can you say no? That’s an entirely different question. Tell me, Topher…” Emrys frowned. His eyebrows were like great fat caterpillars, and his face was so expressive even without them that he looked comical, in deep thought. He had the glass of Firewhiskey in his hand, and he was swirling his glass lazily as he thought. “Imagine you fell in love with a Healer yourself. I don’t know, what sort — let’s say a cardiovascular expert. Imagine that they were the absolute best of the best.”
Harry returned to his breakfast. And his reading. No, he tried to. Both had become devoid of interest.
Harry sat at the kitchen counter and watched Hermione mash vegetables for Hugo.
The three of them sat, for a while, waiting for Malfoy to wake. Professor McGonagall glanced around the room, more than once, but her eyes returned to Malfoy every time.
The pain went far beyond the heat of it. Draco couldn’t figure out why, and anyway, he was trying to maintain what was currently passing for poise. Which was hard since he was seeing at least double, and every nerve in his body was tight as a violin string, shrieking for attention. He wanted to shout, yell, scream, perhaps cry.
“Oh, don’t be disingenuous, mother. Blaise’s mother makes up at least one third of the gossip in Witch Weekly, and if you think I don’t know you subscribe, you sorely underestimate me.” His mother had the sense not to argue. “And what’s wrong with Blaise? He’s attractive, well-bred —”
Until he did.
“Because it wasn’t your problem,” Harry said. “I should probably try to get some sleep.”
When Hermione and Blaise stepped out of the fireplace and into Draco’s little house things were definitely amiss. Blaise stepped in front of her almost instantly, wand raised and ready; the glass shook in the window frames, the pictures shook on the walls (upsetting some of the residents briefly) and the light wavered dramatically as the flames were tossed from side to side. And then it stopped.
“Are you okay, Ron?” Hermione asked, a gentle smile on her lips.
“Your finest garb, I see.” Draco gestured at a comfortable armchair by the fireplace. Potter looked momentarily embarrassed by his Muggle clothes, but too tired to care all that much. “What on earth are those? On your feet?”
“Professor Sprout says I’m a natural at it,” Neville said, blushing proudly. “The Herbology part and the teaching part both. You don’t think she’d say that just to make me feel better, do you, Harry?”
When Hermione had cut in and taken Draco for a turn around the dance floor, Luna stepped in to rescue Harry. He twirled her and didn’t step on her feet, which was very nice. They were talking about the new school Harry was help to start, deep in the forest outside of l’Aquila.
“Think I might need something a little more distilled,” Draco drawled. “So. Bed-hopping Auror twits. Is that how you and Granger tumbled into this… whatever it is? To be perfectly honest, I thought you preferred cock, Zabini.”
Draco was struggling to avoid
A House-elf approached Harry with a tray of drinks.
“Blaise Zabini and Hermione Granger,” Draco mused, as he took his seat and reached for his tea. “I wouldn’t have believed it, but you do seem to be remarkably well matched.”
He smoothed Potter’s hair off his forehead, taking a moment to glance at the old lightning-shaped scar. He let his fingers linger over Potter’s smooth cheek. He did look good. That didn’t make any of this more tragic, but Draco had eyes, he couldn’t pretend he couldn’t see it.
Draco straddled Harry’s hips, and leaned down until their faces were close. Close enough to kiss, but he didn’t, not yet, even when Harry licked his lips in anticipation.
“I cannot believe you almost got sorted into Slytherin.”
“Come and see, Potter,” he said. Potter’s hair was sticking up even more in the back but if it was possible, he looked at least two degrees closer to sane with almost an hour of rest under his belt. He climbed clumsily off the comfortable armchair and followed Draco to the work bench to watch him add the final ingredient, passionflower oil.
Eventually, Draco stood, and peered into the cauldron. Satisfied, he gave Harry a thin smile.
. But he hadn’t bet on finding Ron and Hermione watching television and drinking, either. He cursed himself for not having apparated to his own bedroom directly but Hermione was already off the couch and examining his face before he had a chance to say anything so much as ‘How was the movie?’
Harry didn’t see Malfoy until Sunday night. He looked better; still pale, but he was, after all, a Malfoy.
“And you broke up.”
“Er,” Harry replied. “Thanks?” He didn’t look up. He knew what the place looked like, and it was fine. Though suddenly, he didn’t want anyone looking at it. He stood up. “I think you should both leave.” He cast a spell to unfold the chair all the way down flat so that Malfoy could sleep, and summoned a couple of blankets. “Madam Pomfrey, I shall send an elf if I need you, but I think I should just keep an eye on him for tonight. This curse is one I know well, and I can deal with any minor setbacks. Goodnight.”
Hermione was halfway to pulling him across the table in a bear hug before Harry was able to register that she, at least, was proud and happy. “It’s an incredibly rare gift,” she said. “And it’s usually genetic —”
It was almost a relief, when Draco felt the tug of it, somewhere there behind his bellybutton. Just to be away from that overwhelming fear. He didn’t even care if he was going to something worse. He’d have welcomed death like an old friend, but knew he would wake up, instead.
“Whiskers,” Harry said. “From Crookshanks. I know you miss him.”
“Bit beyond her,” Malfoy said, and his eyes fell closed.
Mrs Malfoy waved her wand again, and Harry realised that it wasn’t lazy, just… elegant and economical. A plate of macaroons appeared on the coffee table. She lifted the plate and offered one to Harry, her expression expectant. Harry didn’t need a macaroon.
“It’s far from fine! It’s so fucking
He visited Luna Lovegood and her boyfriends Finn and Grayson the following evening for dinner. He didn’t ask, and he didn’t wait to be invited; he dropped by, as if that was one of those normal things to do, and was welcomed with open arms, only to learn that it was dessert-for-dinner night and all three of them were making absurdly complex sundaes. They sat on a perilous-looking balcony high above the forest below with some sort of Muggle music piping through the house.
Draco pulled him closer.
“Can I collect Dora tomorrow? Only I think I need kitten-proof the place before I bring her home.”
Draco thought for a long time. About long lazy afternoons stretched out on the bed. Harry submitting so sweetly to him. Or holding him down, fucking him until Draco could barely speak. Evenings on the couch in front of the fireplace, talking about nothing of any consequence. Playing stupid Muggle board games (snakes and ladders? Was that supposed to be funny) when Harry suddenly remembered where he’d seen one. Beating Harry at chess, over and over and over again because Harry was all flash and strength and no strategy.
“I didn’t intend to. I’ve been busy. I have more paperwork to catch up on than I could poke my wand at, and —”
He even found himself getting terribly drunk with Professor Saltzman, the History teacher, one night. His misery seemed to amuse the man.
“Can I — can I —”
“It’s enough,” Draco said. “I don’t care, I’m not waiting anymore. I’ve waited more than two decades. It’s enough. Need you to fuck me deep, Harry,” he said, making as if to roll over onto his hands and knees, but the thought of not being able to see his face had Harry feeling mildly panicky.
“I can do better, right? Find a nice Slytherin girl to —”
The worst thing of all: the way Harry had wanted to reach for him, wrap his arms around Draco, kiss that pale, fragile throat. Rescue him from whatever the fuck was going on.
“Thank you. It
“It was stupid.” Julian shook his head, and stared at the window — at, not out, because every man and his Crup knew they were underground and the windows were enchanted to look like real weather. “He just can’t mind his own, you know? I had everything under control, and he steps out in front of me and throws up a Shield Charm, like I couldn’t’ve done it myself. Tosses a few body-binds about the place like there were cameras on him.”
“Oh,” Harry said, and though his tone sounded pleased, his expression was guarded and cautious. “Well.”
On a Friday night, eating Thai food in the kitchen with the WWN on for company, Harry handed Hermione an envelope. “I keep meaning to give you these,” he said.
Blaise had learned very early in his career that there was nothing more important than thinking. Making sure he had the time and space to think. Prioritising time spent in deep thought.
He did sound hopeful.
“When I was alone, and I had a little time, I’d imagine… what would happen, if we were
When Draco stepped back into the house, it was all different.
Harry had, at some point in the last couple of weeks, modified his wards to allow Draco through. Draco had seized upon this as an open invitation to show up at any time, though he was carefully treading the line between charmingly irksome and just plain annoying. Tonight, Harry just smiled at him, and gestured at the teapot on the end table.
Malfoy sighed deeply, and stood. He reached into the pocket of his robes and pulled out two envelopes, and then he walked in the direction of the group.
Ron stalled.
Hermione sighed. “It was a formality, by then. Is this really relevant?”
“Oh, I mean it with the greatest affection. He did save my life repeatedly, Hermione, despite what an utter shit I was to him. If he wasn’t so painfully selfless I wouldn’t be here to bitch about it, but the point remains. He was treated like a tool, and he’s still acting like one.” He glanced sideways. “I could have phrased that differently.”
Hermione knew it would probably be a mistake to open another bottle of wine, but she did it anyway, setting it on the coffee table when she’d filled her own glass, and Harry’s. She had changed into comfortable clothes right before their impromptu guests arrived, but now she tossed her shoes aside and tucked her feet up underneath her.
“I’ll take that as a ‘no’.”
“You’re beautiful, you know,” Draco said, and Harry murmured some sort of objection, the skin around his eyes going tight. “No, don’t argue. You’re beautiful. It makes me — it makes me want to take care of you.” Draco felt his throat tighten. That hadn’t been exactly what he intended to say, but there it was. He tipped Harry’s face away so he could get at his neck, that pale skin, unscarred. Harry as he wanted to be. How had he not thought about that before?
Harry grinned, and shook his head. “You’re a big softie, Draco Malfoy. But how did you get her to accept it? Kreacher gets so cross — I have to keep Hermione away from him, he’s sick of being lectured about servitude. I got him to accept some old blankets, but if I try to pay him or give him clothes he goes into a right snit.”
me, mother. And if he doesn’t, it’s only because he’s learned to tolerate me. We need each other for work things, that’s all. My…”
“If you want me to last longer than ten seconds when you start fucking me, it might be a good idea to take the edge off, yes.”
Harry grinned as she passed it back. “I can’t believe this is my life. D’you know, Ollivander thinks that the reason I have the gift is that I have mastered several wands, and wandless magic.”
“Any time,” Neville said.
“We could do that.”
“It’s not —,” Harry said, and ran out of steam.
“I love you to ask me for the things you want,” he murmured, with his lips brushing over the shell of Harry’s ear. “I love to give you the things you want. I promise I’ll make it so good, Harry, darling.
So what if they could never be friends? Harry hadn’t had high hopes even the night before, when Malfoy shook his hand and welcomed him cordially back to Hogwarts. Still. Getting along a little better than they had when they were children would be a good start. He jotted down some notes about the class and wound his scarf around his neck, before he headed down into the Great Hall for lunch.
“Please,” Harry said. “I just. I want to understand. We feuded for years. I almost killed you in Sixth Year, with that fucking awful curse. I don’t understand. I really don’t. And I hear you, I do, I hear what you’re saying, but you’re wrong. I
She couldn’t say it, though, and apparently, neither could Draco.
“Alright, so —
Annoyed, Draco climbed out of his chair and left Harry’s room, locking it behind him. A gesture at the Floo and a familiar shape toppled out.
Draco nodded and crossed to the tiny kitchenette — just a couple of cupboards, space for a kettle, and running water. He opened the cupboard to retrieve a bottle of Firewhiskey and two beautiful old crystal tumblers.
“Malfoy?”
“Well, he never asked me for an autograph or tried to sneak me a love potion.” Harry glanced up, embarrassed, and then looked down at his clasped hands again. “Maybe it was easier to imagine that if we were together, he’d make me feel special for
Harry waited for Ron to make the first move. And then he lost, as he always lost to Ron.
“It’s nice,” Harry said, emphatically, and almost apologetically. Draco waved his wand at the ceiling, and the bright winter night sky was suddenly visible through the magical equivalent of a skylight.
He could have tossed Harry down on the bed, in that moment, and demanded anything, anything at all, and Harry would have given it to him. He could feel it. But he didn’t want just anything. Harry might have been considerably more discreet than Draco, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t known for having spent a good number of messy weekends with random men all over London.
“I need you to tell the Ministry to leave me alone for the rest of the year so I can finish my NEWTs. I don’t know… ban students from social events not arranged by Hogwarts, or something. I can’t stand it, Professor. The way they all want to shake my hand, and take my photograph, and touch my clothes — I think I’ve given enough, now, and I need time to be eighteen and stupid, not their sodding
Harry snickered. “Look, I was already in the habit. We used to stalk each other at school all the time. Usually took turns, but I have to admit I was always better at it than he was. He mostly sprang from corners, desperate for attention.”
Hermione felt a powerful flash of anger. “Ginevra Weasley — I am exhausted, I am wrung out, I’ve been racing back and forth between London and Naples for weeks, now; I have probably slept six hours in the last three nights and my best friend, to whom we all owe our lives over and over again, is trapped in a dream he constructed because he — because… because he needed a fucking
“Hermione! Come and taste this. I can’t decide if it’s too salty or not. I didn’t use a recipe.”
“Ron,” Hermione said, taking his hand. “You know what it is.”
“It’s your core,” Harry murmured, into his neck. “It’s waking up.”
“Because I want to spend the summer here with you. Healing, resting, and showing you exactly how sorry I am at least a couple of times a day.”
Draco looked at him with resignation, and then stood straighter. “Harry, do you not know how to dance?”
“After the war,” Harry started, and then he stopped. “No. Honestly, everything starts a lot further back than that. I haven’t had the easiest life, if I’m honest.”
“You wanted to ask me something,” Hermione said. She looked tired. Draco would have wagered that the revelations of the night before had robbed her of her sleep, but he didn’t ask.
Draco was having his own day off — an actual
“My understanding is that there is something
“You’re really not doing back to the DMLE,” Draco asked suspiciously.
“Harry…”
Ron and Hermione knew, too, and Molly Weasley. But Harry didn’t want anyone else to know. Certainly not Draco Malfoy, who had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth and only gave it up to swap for a gold one. Who had probably refused to eat when he didn’t like the food the house elves had prepared.
They had another party on New Year’s Eve. Harry surprised himself by inviting Pansy, and she surprised him by agreeing to come, and she brought Blaise with her, who didn’t look surprised at all when Pansy punched him in the dick for not telling her he’d been here before.
“I’m not your Mind Healer. I’m Harry’s.” He picked absently at a stray bit of lint on his trousers, although Hermione was certain he was just giving her a break from that relentlessly calm grey gaze. “And I’m not making any judgement,” he lied, like a lying liar. “I’m merely trying to understand what is happening here. Do you know if he ever sought any kind of help to recover from the abuse?”
“Harry —”
“Ideal,” she said, looking satisfied. She hugged Harry tightly, and to Harry’s shock (and evidently Draco’s as well) she hugged Draco, too. He stiffened for a moment, but returned the embrace cordially when he had recovered his equilibrium.
Julian didn’t move. Draco sat back in his chair. “Auror Flint. Did you hear?”
“Lights,” he said, drawing his wand.
“It’s my intonation. And even with all of that, and with how annoyingly bloody
One of the most amusing days of Draco’s very strange visit to Harry’s home was the day that Andromeda and Teddy appeared unannounced.
Draco looked pointedly at the fire, and Harry realised he didn’t even know where his wand was. Chastised, he closed his mouth.
There was so much he wanted to say.
“I don’t know.”
Friends. Friends! Pah. And yet, Draco found he still wanted that, after all of these years.
The worst thing was the knowledge that Potter was even now laughing at him. Quietly, of course, internally. Externally he was turning sad, pitiful eyes on Draco and probably every time he tried to entice Draco to talk, he was really only interested in telling him that he was very special and would make someone a
“You’ve changed so much,” Harry said.
“No,” Blaise said. He stood and removed his Unspeakable robes, shrunk them down and balled them in his hand. “No, I’m not sure I’ve ever seen you so well balanced. It’s marvellous, really. I’m impressed.”
Harry laughed, and drew his tiny wand from his pocket, placing it on the table.
Hermione was a very good dancer, Luna thought idly. But both women were watching Draco and Harry move closer for a very sweet kiss, full of promise.
“Don’t bother pretending that you haven’t had feelings for this man for most of your life,” Emrys finally said, quietly. “The fact that you barely mentioned a patient who took up most of your time for months had me paying close attention. It’s not like you. I decided to wait, and let you come to me when you were ready, and I suppose that day has come.”
“That’s my boy. How are things with Harry?”
Malfoy stopped as the circle opened to include him, but didn’t step any closer. He didn’t look well. How could he, though, with everything that had happened?
“Sounds like someone who is always ready for someone to stick a camera in his face.”
“I might take you up on that,” he said, and the fact that he did not intend to must have showed on his face because Draco’s eyes flashed disappointment for a moment.
Molly’s reply came less than an hour later. Her handwriting was shaky, but she assured Harry that if he trusted Draco then she would be happy to offer her hospitality. Harry was quite sure that the moment she saw how thin Draco was she’d be fussing over him like he was one of her own brood. Hermione replied shortly afterwards with a declaration that it was a wonderful idea.
“Can’t sleep?”
The Healer raised his eyebrows. “Most people call me Topher.”
The new formal robes weren’t as painful as Harry had anticipated.
Draco took to rather dramatic and formal apologies, the responses to which generally sat somewhere along a spectrum from grudging to amused. Hermione gave him a tight hug (made awkward by her growing baby bump) and Ron said there were no hard feelings but if it happened again he was going to have Charlie feed Draco to his dragons. Pansy promised it was water under the bridge, and that she was completely over it but would almost certainly bring it up whenever she was the least bit drunk.
“Well,” Draco said, “pay attention, then, Potter. I know how easily distracted you are. First thing is, you’ll notice I do this.” He pulled the sheet down off of them both. No stupid orange pyjama pants. No anything, actually, except an impressive erection Draco didn’t mind admitting he was looking forward to getting his mouth on again, even if it was only in a dream. Harry grinned, and linked his fingers behind his head.
“Thank you,” Harry said, with the knife in his hand. “It’s beautiful.”
Joyful purpose began to look a lot like anaesthetising focus, and with the initial flurry of activity over, the anaesthesia wore off.
“You do know I specialise in wands, Blaise,” Harry replied drily.
“I have a fair idea.”
“Delilah. I have been offered a post as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“Then fuck it,” Draco said, looking up through his pale eyelashes at Harry. He sank down slowly, cheeks hollowing, and Harry — well, he’d always thought of himself as a nice, obliging sort of person, so he did precisely as he’d been asked, slowly at first, trying to get a grip on what exactly Draco wanted from him.
“And Miscellaneous?” Draco added, helpfully. Harry snorted. Bonnie stiffened. Maybe it was time for the juvenile delinquents of the faculty to start rethinking the House system.
“Of course you do, Harry.”
. I used those words, Harry, and I meant them. I might have taken the Dark Mark out of sheer fucking terror, but I was a ferocious little arsehole long before that. My father taught me about blood purity like it was a simple fact of life. I hurt people.”
“I could re-create it, if you like,” Harry said, in a voice as slutty as he could manage.
Draco frowned, and then narrowed his eyes, and laughed, and frowned again, and Harry seemed to shrink away, his expression wary but resigned.
Eventually, when all the sounds had died out, he sat up, got to his feet and pushed the cupboard door open. His shoulder was still in place, but it was swollen and bruised and Draco hoped that perhaps he was about to run away from home — from the house, really, this was not a home, and apparently never had been. The idea that Harry Potter had been raised to know how special and important he was, showered with gifts and praise, was gone. Draco hated that he’d ever made such an assumption.
“I’m not in love with him,” Draco said, with much more force than he intended.
He took the parcel that had been addressed to Draco, and held it up for a moment.
Hermione wished that she could say she thought it might be true, but she didn’t. “He… doesn’t have time,” she said. As the weeks went by, she was beginning to see how complicated and ugly this was. How wretched. And she was beginning to see how it was not just possible, but likely, that almost everyone in Harry’s life had some culpability in what had happened here, even if she still didn’t understand quite what was happening. “I don’t think he has time.”
He hurried back to his room, careful to look like he was not hurrying at all. Once in the privacy of his classroom, he opened the letter.
Harry wanted to say… something. Anything. A murmured apology. Or perhaps ask some questions. But the tightness in Draco’s jaw told him it wouldn’t be welcome; it was just something he’d needed to say out loud.
Harry’s thoughts swam.
“Tell me you took down all those heads. Creepy as fuck, they were. Terrified me as a child. And old Walburga —”
“Now, if only you’d mentioned that in first year.”
Blaise shook his head, and took a few steps forward. “No. But the house was sick. Draco wasn’t sure she even wanted to recover, and he sure as shit wasn’t going to force her to survive. She stood for almost a thousand years. Growing, evolving — she was tired.”
Harry slept poorly and shallowly, but that was hardly a surprise.
“Knew I should have been a model or a movie star,” Draco said with a dramatic sigh.
She opened the envelope, and frowned. “What are they?”
Anyway: Structureless. The days were structureless. Harry ate when he was hungry, slept when he was tired, and went walking in places where no one would recognise him. He feed bread to ducks in a nearby pond until he was informed by a serious-faced little boy that bread wasn’t good for ducks. Harry apologised profusely, to the boy and the ducks, and Vanished the bread as soon as the boy was gone. After that, he walked until he found someone selling duck food, and tossed that instead.
“Hmph.” Draco opened an eye, and closed it again. “You’ll know.”
“It’s not exactly good to take too little, either. If your eyeballs are hanging out of your head from a lack of sleep, it’s probably time you swallowed your pride. No matter. I have some time tonight.”
“We would have helped,” Hermione said, impassioned.
“Well,” Draco replied, “roast beef and turkey, potatoes, lashings of vegetables — Lissie’s French bean salad which looks like nothing special but will change your mind about eating your greens forever…”
Ron shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “Dunno why, but I can’t make myself hate him as much just now. Feels like kicking a crup. It’ll probably wear off in a day or two.”
“I think, sometimes, that…”
“I’m sorry?”
laughter. The kind where tears were soon pouring from Harry’s eyes, and Ron was blinking in amusement. “What? What did I say? ‘Mione? Hey! What did I say?”
“No!” Neville wailed. “She’s so important! A magazine editor — and I’m just…”
“I think you are all very aware that my life has been complicated,” he said. He couldn’t force himself to meet anyone’s eyes but he let his glance move over the room so they would have the impression he was doing so anyway. “It really has been. My childhood — you all know very well that I lost my parents. And you know how. I was raised by Muggle relatives for several years and they weren’t… kind,” he said.
“We’d forgiven you before you were even gone, Ron.”
He sat heavily on the chair behind his desk. Molly had sent a tin of biscuits; she always did, shortbread biscuits in the shape of lion’s heads. He knew the shape of the package the moment he laid eyes on it. Tired as he was, a little sugar might give him the jolt he needed to finish some paperwork, so he unwrapped it and opened the tin. It sang a gentle ‘happy birthday’ and he smiled.
“I’m looking forward to it,” Harry said. His newest wand was finished. He made a notation on the end of a long box (19” WN DH), laid out a soft piece of cloth, and nestled the wand gently into place. “I know no child ever forgets the first time they wave a wand. I want to learn everything I can.”
Not prepared to finish that sentence. He took a tub of a moisturising potion. Harry’s skin was dry, and skin contact was good for patients who had experienced trauma. Draco began with his hands, and his arms. His hands were calloused and his arms bore a thousand small scars. Why? Most spell-damage could be healed completely. How much damage did it take to leave this kind of a mess?
“I suppose Firewhiskey is out of the question,” Harry grumbled, exhausted. Draco snickered.
Harry sighed, and removed the pages from the envelope. He frowned. So many words. Harry had never blossomed into a passionate reader the way Hermione had hoped he might, and this looked like a lot of legalese that he wouldn’t have been able to understand anyway.
“My Mind Healer says I need something to do,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they sat on the back steps, a few days into the new year. Hermione sat a step lower than Ron, resting between his thighs, periodically re-casting her warming charms; Hermione’s magic felt like summer air against Harry’s cold cheeks. It was nicer to sit outside and look at the snow without having to be cold than it was being stuck inside all the time.
“I don’t miss it,” he promised. “But there’s nothing wrong with elephants.”
“Thank you for coming,” he said, and his voice was tight and reedy as if he was barely keeping himself upright. Perhaps he was.
He took one anyway.
He could feel the twinkle in his own eyes, and when Harry looked up to see whether he was being teased, or really criticised, he relaxed quickly.
“You’re still a bit of a prat sometimes, Draco,” Neville said calmly, not looking up from his porridge. And there it was.
-ish,” Blaise said.
His finger slipped inside before Draco’s impatient nod was even finished. To the first knuckle, and then the second, laughing as Draco’s hips rolled again, struggling between pulling away from the intrusion and fucking himself down onto Harry’s fingers. Two fingers, then, and he took Draco’s cock back into his mouth while he scissored them, stretching, but not wanting to stretch too far.
“Shhh,” Draco replied. He didn’t move his hands. He didn’t touch. He just leaned down a little, his lips dry, and pressed a kiss to Harry’s mouth.
And they did.
“Mother loved Christmas,” he said, wistfully. “She spent all of November planning the decorations, and setting out the plans for the elves, drawing up lists of things they needed to order and who would be doing what jobs. Packages would arrive for weeks and weeks and then on the first of December, we’d wake up to find the house was decorated. I missed that, when I went to Hogwarts, you know. Not that the decorations there were anything to sneeze at.”
The cemetery was cold and damp, but silent. Draco pushed himself to his feet and rubbed at his knee, where he had landed on a sharp stone or something. Apparently he’d drawn blood. Good thing it was a dream.
Harry stared, and turned the letter over, and handed it back to Malfoy, who read it with a frown and then (if it was possible) paled slightly.
“Neville,” Draco warned the table.
a wand, now, just a wand waiting on its core — taking the Kneazle whisker into itself, welcoming it, drawing from it. And when he opened his eyes…
Draco paled. “It might be better we leave this topic.”
“Can we invite the Weasleys again?” he asked. “If they can come, of course. I don’t know what’s come over me today. I just want to spend time with my friends. Maybe Neville? Or Luna? Is Ginny close enough to come? I went completely overboard. Garlic bread, salad, risotto — like old times.”
“I could be available to consult for the Department while I malinger.”
He could hide under the balcony until it was all over.
“Ron liked you,” Hermione said, suddenly. Changing the subject, maybe, but more to the point she wanted Draco to know. “I saw him after you visited Twelve Grimmauld Place. He was very enthusiastic. He— he
She handed him an envelope. She handed it over with such gravity that Harry felt his bones harden and his eyes widen. He recognised the handwriting on the front, though he couldn’t place it, and when he turned it over to see the seal on the back — the heavy, ornate ‘H’ set into the wax — his heart thumped in his chest.
“Headmaster McGonagall—”
It seemed unlikely.
Well. Friendship had never really been on the cards, anyway.
“You’re not ready to talk about it, are you?”
“A hex,” admitted the miserable boy.
“If I fell —” No, fuck no. “What would you do, if I was dating someone you didn’t approve of?”
“He learned about prejudice,” Harry murmured to Andromeda as Draco fastened coats around himself and Teddy both. “I’m proud.”
,” Hermione said, giving Ron’s thigh a squeeze. “I didn’t think there would ever come a day when I would climb into bed and realise I hadn’t thought about the war a single time since I’d woken up.”
But Harry didn’t try to get up and Hermione didn’t, either.
The air began to shift.
“I would if I knew,” he said honestly. “He showed up in the middle of the night, soaked to the skin, and asked me for my help. I’m giving him my help. That’s as much as I can tell you.”
After a good breakfast, Blaise shook Draco’s hand and left the suite of rooms to wait with Parvati.
“What can I say. Auror vigilance,” he said. “And I didn’t get much of the crackling. Can you pass the pumpkin juice, please, Malfoy? See, I do have manners.”
Later that evening, Draco brought a small desk into Potter’s room. He opened out the map that Granger and —
“You can’t poach an egg to save yourself. We can do it together, though.”
In the third week of February, Ron and Hermione got married at the Burrow, protected from the gentle snow by warming charms and surrounded by everyone they loved. It was a simple ceremony. Hermione cried a little because she had never been able to bring herself to fetch her parents back, and she missed them, but Ginny and Luna and Fleur took good care of her, like the lovely obliging bridesmaids they were. Harry, Bill and Charlie were Ron’s groomsmen — Percy had his hands full with two small children and a tired-looking wife, which was fortunate, as Ron hadn’t really wanted to ask him. They were leaving their honeymoon until Hermione graduated in May and got ready to start her two-year legal internship.
He shook his head sadly, exaggerated. Draco frowned. Harry looked embarrassed. Draco frowned more.
. You’re expecting to reach some sort of a point where you’re good enough for Draco, and it makes absolutely no sense — because you’ve come far enough to understand that we don’t love people for overcoming their troubles. We just love them. You’ll never believe that you’re good enough for Draco, any more than he’ll believe he’s good enough for you.”
“You know,“ Draco said, when he could speak again, when the lump in his throat was gone and he could breathe, and see. “I only ever wanted him to see me. I wanted to be his friend. I wanted us to… have secrets, perhaps, to whisper late at night. I wanted to kiss him. I wanted him to want me. And now I’ve had this ridiculous charade for months… this imaginary version of myself conjured from nothing, and I don’t even know why but I still fucking want it. It’s pathetic. I’m pathetic. And I hope he leaves before I can get any more pathetic.”
Molly was quiet, hands on her hips. “I knitted him a lovely scarf. Not Slytherin colours — a nice pale blue to bring out his eyes.”
Draco snorted limoncello out of his nose. It burned like acid, and his eyes watered. “Blaise, please.” He wiped his face with a napkin. “Perhaps you’re happy slumming it with Gryffindors—”
“What time?” Draco said, after a long, comfortable silence, sitting up formally (if groggily).
Draco nodded indulgently. He couldn’t deny that he was pleased. He knew it wasn’t as easy as all of that, but it sounded at least like Harry was trying to reclaim his life, and that was a start.
He sat up again. He reached for the wand he was using lately and stepped into his slippers. Downstairs, because he was starting to think it was the front door of the shop.
“How is it you managed to make all of that sound
?” Draco asked. “If I’m not mistaken, that was an enormous box of chocolates — if you’re not partial, I assure you, Neville and I would have cheerfully polished them off for you. And anyway, you
. Freezing cold, terribly underdressed for the weather —
Draco spun on the heel of his tattered old Converse sneakers but the urgency of the movement wasn’t reflected in his expression, which was equal parts cold and murderous.
Ron’s delight at having Harry back was palpable. It ached, a little, though. Ron wanted to act as if Harry had been gone for a couple of weeks, and wasn’t interested in hearing any kind of details. Harry knew not to try to share them, but the scene made Hermione ache for the days when the three of them had never had a single secret from each other.
Of course, the whole…
Overhead, he heard a scraping on the wooden floor. So did Mrs Anand, who looked up.
Julian was silent for a few moments, and Draco looked up. Julian looked embarrassed.
“Come for me, Harry,” he growled into Harry’s ear. “Fill me up. Let me feel it. Let me see your face when you come, you smug Gryffindor git. I’ve been waiting to see it long enough.” He gripped Harry’s hair tightly and pulled his head back so he could watch his expression.
The stairs didn’t creak; the portraits on the wall alongside them greeted him warmly. Harry wasn’t sure that he could keep looking at it all. Certainly he didn’t think he could keep looking at it while Hermione was looking at him.
Hermione was sitting at a desk in the corner, apparently responding to a few last-minute owls. She shot Draco a grateful smile and continued her scribbling, and a few minutes later, Blaise responded to a knock on the door and went to accept a couple of pizzas.
She tossed a pinch of powder into the fireplace in Harry’s room, and in a flash of green flames, Hermione was gone.
“Tastes the same,” she said.
“Did you work with him much?”
“Appalling.”
He closed his eyes, and his hands tingled, magic weaving around his fingers and pressing into his skin like sunbeams on an early summer day. He saw, in his mind, the wand — and it
“Does that mean you’ll do it?”
,” he corrected. “There was a bathroom, in the dream. At least I think it was a bathroom. It was enormous, though. And there was a snake. Huge! D’you have any idea what that might have been about? Is he afraid of snakes?”
And so, they did. Finn had made cocktails, with no recipe but a lot of decoration, and Harry wondered how precisely people who were supposed to fall into place did so; these three, and Hermione and Blaise, and Pansy and Greg and their whiskey. But he didn’t wonder for long. When they were all a little drunker than was appropriate for a weeknight, Harry made his goodbyes, and reached for the Floo powder.
“Professor Malfoy,” Minerva said. “Draco. The war has been over for thirteen years. You’re not children anymore.”
“Have I passed? Do you think I’m okay?” He tried to keep his tired amusement off his face, but he failed.
“Oh, silly me,” Ginny said. “Mum, I’ll knead that loaf again, shall I?”
“You’re awake, too,” Harry said, after a long silence.
Harry took the paper out of her hands. It was less than a week since Harry had spoken at Narcissa and Malfoy’s trials. Five days since Malfoy had been cleared of charges and Narcissa had received a sentence of one year in Azkaban, rather than the ten she had been promised; Harry had told the Wizengamot that she was the reason he had made it back to the castle alive, something they clearly hadn’t wanted to hear about, as they had changed the time and location of her trial and Malfoy’s several times in an effort to prevent him from testifying. Four days since Lucius had been transferred to Azkaban to live out his days there.
“Come on. We’ll be alright. I love you,” Harry said. “I’m sure we can borrow a couple of kids whenever you’re in dire straits. Rose and Hugo. Rose loves painting over your tattoos.”
“Well,” Harry replied, wishing she’d accepted the other version of his sentence. “If they’d done something terrible, or… and I didn’t say in love.” Pedantic. He’d almost said it.
“She can come. I don’t want to worry —”
She raised her eyebrows.
Maybe he was just prone to scarring. The one the back of his hand that read
“Alright. I have some personal information to share. I’m not sure it’s appropriate for Blaise to be here. However, I do recognise that he has some skills, and may be able to help. I also recognise that this… whatever this is,” he said, waving in their general direction, “may well mean that anything I tell you, Minist… Hermione, you will share with him. So I ask you as Harry’s medical proxy — should I ask Blaise to leave?”
“I imagine you need to anyway.”
you love chocolate, because the last time we chaperoned the children to Hogsmeade, you inhaled a block of it that was almost the size of your head.”
“Milk and sugar,” he said, meeting Harry’s eyes for a moment. “I know you prefer a slice of lemon, but we need to get a little of something into you in case your stomach isn’t ready for food.”
“What does he do in his spare time?” Draco asked, deliberately softening his voice.
It took two days to make the arrangements for Potter’s hospital room to be attached to Draco’s office. This sort of work would mean long days, even if he did spend a significant portion of them sleeping, in between treating his other patients and no doubt responding to more enquiries than anyone should have to as regards Harry’s condition.
“No, you git. My point is that we’re both fucked up. Beyond the telling of it. Vol— Tom Riddle made a mess of both of our lives. You’re not different to me. And I invited you to a courting dance because I want to court you.”
But no one really pressed Draco on why he was there, and Harry, for his part, was relieved.
“Are you? Dating? You don’t really seem to —”
There was a clap in one corner of the room, and the clapper stood up. Bit by bit, confused people clapped their agreement, or at least their understanding, and soon, most of the guests were on their feet; the applause became deafening. Harry was startled. He had assumed that they would be angry, as Robards (still in his chair and still pulsing with fury) so evidently was, or positively thriving on the scandal of it. But instead he saw a dawning comprehension, and respect, gratefulness, and maybe… maybe even
over the gaslights and the room looked brighter immediately. Of course, that meant the utter filth of the place was now impossible to ignore. “Sort of.”
husband one day. And then he’d go and visit Granger and the Weasel and tell the story and they’d all laugh until they had tears running down their cheeks.
“Good.” Harry took a tentative step inside the room. “I thought I mind send for a curry for supper. If you…?”
“I know,” Hermione said. “But you’re awake. And you’re alright? You’re really alright?”
“Done!” called a loud voice in the back of the classroom, and Amelia jumped.
“I’ll marry you, then,” she said. “Since you asked so nicely. Just don’t imagine I’ll be changing my name.” She settled between Blaise’s knees and he took her hand, carefully sliding the ring over her finger until it settled like a promise.
“Don’t be foolish. If any family had more than one a year the whole of society would assume they were trying to marry off a troll. The Bulstrodes are hosting the next one. Millicent has been married for years, but her younger sister is of age.” Draco spoke primly, and with feigned disinterest.
Draco wanted to chase him down and talk to him. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere without students, or twenty years of ugly history between them, or…
Gabrielle was as gracious as ever, and took Harry’s hands in her own. “You have to stay for dinner,” she said, because Ron couldn’t.
“Thirty, is it?”
“Since it doesn’t look like you’re planning to AK me for trying to hand your skinny arse over to the Dark — Vol —“ Pansy flushed. “You might as well call me Pansy,” she said.
“Professor McGonagall,” he said, through clenched teeth. “Help.”
“And when you’re in the shop? Still getting autograph hunters?”
A careful spell rolled Harry onto his side, and he rubbed the potion into his back. Every one of Harry’s ribs was prominent. There had been no change to the nutrition he was being provided, but with his magic waning, he wasn’t taking as much in.
The days grew shorter, and the nights longer, but twice a week without fail Harry had dinner with Ron and Hermione; sometimes at the Leaky Cauldron, sometimes at their house in Ottery St Catchpole. Sometimes they went to Grimmauld Place to watch Teddy grow up, but Harry always spent time there without them, as well. Sometimes they ate in the kitchen at the shop.
A Healer and a nurse spent time seeing to his physical needs, and making sure he wasn’t developing pressure sores, while Draco sat in his office, meditating. He was still struggling with some anger, and it was making it very difficult to keep his mind clear. But eventually, he found his way to that tranquility he needed.
“Hey, listen,” Harry said, drawing Neville away from the crowd a moment, clutching the paper bag to his chest. “You don’t know anything about Draco Malfoy, do you? Haven’t heard anything at Hogwarts, or…”
Hermione felt… almost as if everything inside her had crumpled, suddenly and finally. As if she might never find a way to stand straight again. Something she hadn’t thought about in so many years. Something that made Harry… human, perhaps. A terrible mistake, a moment of horror.
“D’you think we’ll ever be alright?” Harry asked, quietly, hypnotised by the flames in the fireplace, the way he sometimes was.
“Sometimes I just don’t know who you are,” Harry said. “Or who
Around nine in the evening, they returned to Grimmauld place, with all but the ostensibly adult Weasleys (Molly and Arthur) and the next generation (just Victoire, for now), who was fast asleep by then anyway. Bill and Fleur were remarkably easygoing about leaving Victoire, which made sense, as she was such an easy baby, happy to be held by anyone. Percy’s wife was pregnant and they declined the invitation. Harry hated that he was relieved, but he still didn’t feel comfortable with Percy.
“On the other side of
“It’s strange, you know,” Harry said, opening the doors to a small balcony off the side of the bedroom. It was bitterly cold outside, but he cast a silent warming charm that made Blaise purr. “I started doing this place up because it’s mine. It’s mine because my godfather gave it to me. But it wasn’t a happy home for him, and now I realise I just fixed it up because I needed something to occupy me, right after the war when things were so spectacularly shitty.”
“… And then at the Burrow, chopping vegetables for Molly.”
Draco met Harry’s eyes in the mirror. They were sparkling, and so were Harry’s. “You did, you beast. While I was all fucked-out and floating on a sea of hormones. No, I promise you, I’m here of my own free will. ’Til death do us part, and all the rest of it.” He was supremely satisfied to see Harry’s expression darken hungrily for a moment.
“You’re much more than that,” Harry said, and there he was, ready to sacrifice his own little slice of misery to cheer Draco up, like some kind of a fucking Gryffindor. Good grief.
“I want to get your mother a Christmas gift,” Harry said, abruptly. “Do you have any idea of what she might like?”
“Have we got sausages?”
“Can’t have that. I remember the squeaky little voice you had in First Year. No one wants to hear that again.”
It really wasn’t; even Draco knew enough to know that sort of thing really wasn’t okay. He knew instinctively that saying anything of the sort would either turn Harry mulish or send him hiding. Best to stick with what he knew; being, as the saying went,
He recognised Hermione’s owl, Spot (stupid Muggle joke, but Hermione loved her) and caught a letter in mid-air. A second owl, equally recognisable as Narcissa Malfoy’s magnificent old barn owl dropped a second letter, and Harry passed it to Draco without a thought. He opened Hermione’s letter. Full of the usual; with a photograph of Hugo, pregnancy details Harry could have done without, and an invitation to dinner in two weeks.
Harry laughed.
“Well, half-Kneazle. We think. From Hermione’s old cat Crookshanks. I just wanted to see if I… are you alright, Mr Ollivander?”
“You should head inside. Though I’d appreciate you lowering the wards so that I can leave.”
“Do you have formal robes?”
And he wouldn’t. No, if Harry was looking to reject him a third time, he would retreat to lick his wounds for a year or two and then let Mother arrange him a match.
“This is fucking gorgeous,” he said to Hermione, when he’d swallowed a mouthful of duck. Hermione didn’t answer; she and Blaise, on the other side of the room, were staring at each other in the way they did, communicating in a way that had to involve some far less invasive and more pleasant form of legilimency. “Will I be called up to speak soon?”
