Is this enough?
That was a line Draco often used on Scorpius. It definitely stung to be on the receiving end of that excuse. Scorpius had already gone back to writing.
Blink and you would miss it.
"I do know. I've seen it."
"That's something to be happy about, isn't it?" Harry teased. "Did you have fun with Dad?"
"Never counted." Draco opened a door at the end of the corridor and peered into the dark abyss below. "Got your wand on you?"
ulterior motive?" Draco asked in turn. "You know mine. It's Scorpius. What's yours?"
Victoire threw open the door excitedly. "Teddy!" she crowed as she bounded the last few steps and threw herself at him. Scorpius jumped out of the way just in time because a torrent of children rushed out after her, all of them wanting to hug a piece of Teddy. He was obviously a very popular young man. Harry simply laughed as he ushered Scorpius past the chattering crowd. Inside was a more domestic crowd of adults gathered casually in and around the dining table and kitchen. Most of them were redheads and most of them had a derisive brow arched at the sight of pale Scorpius Malfoy who was hiding behind Harry.
"No."
"Got that out of your system?" Draco asked, and he kept his resolute gaze on the two boys kicking muddy snow at each other.
Teddy was getting fed up with the curious stares he had been receiving since the start of his third year at Hogwarts. He had tried glaring, which usually worked because he could pull off a
He clicked his tongue stormed out of the classroom. He would make damn sure that Scorpius wouldn't get hurt because of something like this, even if it meant antagonizing Potter. Scorpius had had enough disappointment for a lifetime. He grabbed his son by the hand and stalked out the front doors.
Harry didn't mind if it was longer than a minute.
"Is your heart running too?" Timothy asked Scorpius in a shaky whisper.
"Fine."
"Mhm." Scorpius went back to the picture book.
A touch to his ear made him flinch and he glanced at Harry with a frown.
Harry started to say, "There's nothing to talk about-"
At the impending Weasley intervention, Harry found himself in the metaphorical ring with not a single soul in his corner. He was facing off against a group of furious redheads alone. "A public apology?!" Despite the lack of support he had at the Burrow, he was standing his ground.
He frantically searched his pockets for his wand to do just that. Or at least do the next best thing, which would be to disapparate and forget this ever happened.
Harry consoled Scorpius as tears spilled over once again. He remembered crying like this when he was alone in the cupboard under the stairs. The walls were so thin that even the slightest sound would mean someone would be banging on his door, telling him to shut up. His stomach twisted when he remembered all those awful feelings he had in that house. He brushed Scorpius' hair, murmuring sympathetic words. This boy couldn't
He directed his worried expression at Harry who was kneeling in front of his students. "Everybody ready?"
Harry knelt down next to the chair and patiently explained, "I want to see how
Harry glanced over his shoulder at Draco. He saw the carefully guarded expression on Draco, as well as the imperceptible shake of his head. Puzzled, Harry wondered if he had said something he shouldn't have? Draco didn't elaborate. Harry hesitated a beat before saying, "Well... I suppose I should be off." He ruffled Scorpius' hair. He cast one final look at Draco before walking out of the manor and disapparating.
"I'm Scorpius."
Asking for him.
thing that could happen, what's there to be scared of, hmm? It's just a few silly songs."
"Right. What's there to say?"
. Theo always brought chocolates for him from trips around the world. He also knew that Theo was Draco's best friend. He ran down the stairs with his backpack swinging wildly from side-to-side. He couldn't wait to see what Theo had brought him this time. "Hi, Uncle Theo!"
"It was in the heat of the moment."
Harry tilted his head back in defeat and opened his eyes, letting them adjust to the chandelier lights above him. "Right," he muttered. With a loud groan he got up to his feet. "It's quite hard to be your friend, you know?" he added for Draco's benefit.
"Pfft." Teddy snickered and tossed the half-eaten chocolate bar at him.
"Don't get sick, Harry," Scorpius said solemnly. "It's not a nice feeling."
"Go on."
"Because my cousin lives with him, right?" Scorpius continued. "Nanna said that's why Harry is my family."
Draco tsked, grabbed the Daily Prophet off the coffee table, and tossed it to Harry. "Do the crossword." He went back to his letters.
She watched the boy eat stiffly for a moment before leaning towards him. "I like your name," she whispered. "It's pretty."
"Have you gone mad?"
Harry managed to get up the stairs blearily by trailing a hand over the banister and knowing Draco was behind, ready to catch him if he tripped. His stomach growled but he was too tired to eat. He stopped short of the bedroom as an errant thought wormed into his addled mind. He wasn't supposed to be here. He should be home. He turned around, finding himself face-to-face with Draco. "I should go." Or had he thought it? He couldn't tell. He couldn't tell if he was dreaming.
"Dating?"
Scorpius was huddled up in a bundle of blankets on the couch. Propped up in front of him was a large picture book that read aloud to him. The cartoon figures moved as well. The coffee table was littered with cups of water and damp cloth. Harry tapped his finger on Scorpius' shoulder so as not to startle him. The feverish boy looked up blearily, smiling when he recognized Harry. "Hello," he rasped.
Harry shifted on the couch and pressed his hands to his knees. "This is being blown out of proportion. So they've snapped a few photographs of me. What's the big deal?"
He hadn't wanted for a long time. He hadn't wanted in so long that he thought he didn't want anything at all. He hadn't wanted in so long that he had forgotten what it was like.
. Do you have a death wish? Because my brothers are going to murder you!"
. I do not want you to speak to Scorpius about his or your personal lives. I do not want you to treat him any differently than you would treat another child. Am I clear, Potter?"
Draco brushed Scorpius' hair to the side. "I know this summer hasn't been easy. I don't like the way you shouted at me, but I understand what you were feeling. I understand that you were upset. So was I. We said hurtful words. I know you feel sorry. You know I'm sorry too. You didn't do anything wrong. You might feel like you did, but you didn't. You are right. I
He scrambled away as a sudden rush of adrenaline shot through him. He fumbled with his wand while tripping over the rug.
"Nice enough to eat," Harry winked.
Harry nodded sagely. "Yes. Quite different."
"No," Draco retorted. "You dropped them. You pick them up."
Scorpius didn't find that idea as appealing as everyone else and Harry noticed that by the way his face twisted up. "Let's go," Harry rushed, but it was too late. Scorpius sagged heavily and shook his head as a muffled sob escaped him. He was embarrassed and shocked and scared and everything hurt and he didn't
much homework."
"Don't get the wrong impression, Potter."
Teddy kicked Draco's shin, earning a sharp bark from Harry. As he seethed, his hair flickered orange and then fire red. "I hate you," he spat out before running up the stairs. His footsteps echoed down the creaky corridor. The door to his room banged shut.
"Scorpius, wait outside," Draco said. Scorpius tugged at Draco's trousers to get him to shut up, but Draco simply pointed at the hallway. Scorpius dragged himself out of the classroom dejectedly. Draco closed the door between them. Now the classroom was empty but for him and Harry. "What have you been telling my son?"
Harry was just inches away.
"He's a lot like his father in that aspect of things. Hard to keep up with both of them these days." She sighed in defeat. "But you know, I don't just mean in his schoolwork. Draco told me about your godson. Teddy, right?"
Meanwhile, Teddy stomped up to his godfather and planted himself there with his hands at his hips.
The two men stood in the foyer.
Draco propped his elbow on the back of the couch and cocked his head, resting his fingers at his temple, making a show of thinking. "There isn't really much between you," he repeated deliberately. "What do you mean?"
"Oh, don't play that card-"
Harry Potter, in all his glory, was pounding down their door, looking thoroughly displeased and determined.
Harry knew Draco had heard him.
"Okay," Scorpius answered.
Teddy scoffed. "He's got a mansion. Marble statues and crystal chandeliers in practically every room. You should see the size of his estate. There's even a forest with peacocks." Teddy was on a roll now. If there was one thing Teddy loved to do, it was to talk. "I've gotten lost a few times in the manor. No ghouls or ghosts though. He does have a bunch of antiques. His family's ancient, you know? One of the oldest families in history. Everything in that manor is worth a pretty penny and hundreds of years old."
Scorpius took a deep breath and tried again. "I don't want Harry to come over to our house anymore."
"What imposition?" Theo glanced back at Draco, and Draco quickly smoothed his face into an indifferent expression. "There will be plenty for the four of us, don't you think, Draco?"
"Harry."
Scorpius was practically buzzing with excitement as he picked his little legs up on his walk up a gravely path in the middle of a countryside he had never seen. Teddy was already so far ahead, running up the slope with purpose with Harry following along, enjoying the early summer wind in his hair. Summer had just begun and the three of them were feeling wonderful. Scorpius and Teddy had no idea where they were going. That morning, Harry had come over to the Malfoy Manor with Teddy and said that they were going out for the day. It was going to be a lot of fun and they were made to wear light clothes and a good pair of sneakers.
Draco gritted his teeth. "Running a charity, Potter?"
There was little point in trying to reason with a sulking boy. He held back a sigh instead. "Maybe, after you color it, you will like it. Show me when you're finished."
you hear in this house, Scorpius Malfoy."
Scorpius suddenly kicked his legs and shrieked, "SPIDERS!"
Harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "What happened between you and Astoria?" he asked instead of answering Draco.
"Huh?" That feeling was too abstract for a three year old to understand. But she did understand that he was feeling bad, so she plopped her ragged monkey doll down beside him. "Hug Minky," she ordered. Harry did as he was told. Then she brushed his hair with sticky fingers.
"Life is tragically unfair."
"If I were someone else, would it matter?" Harry asked instead. He began searching the rumpled bedspread for his glasses. Draco watched him sift through the sheets blindly, growing more and more exasperated until he simply had to reach over, grab the spectacles from beside the pillows, and shove it in Harry's hand. Harry mumbled his thanks while putting his glasses back on. Then he waited expectantly for Draco's reply. When he was met with silence, Harry nodded. "Right. Well." He sat up, pulling his legs in and crossing them under him. "I'll forget it." He gestured at his cheek. "You know, you've got some dirt on your face."
Scorpius hooked an arm around Draco's elbow. "You are
nice to you."
"We pretended for a while. Then we just stopped pretending." Draco hadn't thought about this for a long time, and it had been even longer since he had spoken about it with anyone. "She couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand her. Trying became too hard." Theo had been furious with them when they broke the news of their impending divorce. He had called them cowards. "We like the easy way out." He knew Theo was right.
Just four days ago, Scorpius had cornered Harry on the playground at school at the end of the day.
"What will happen when Scorpius isn't around anymore? When he's off to Hogwarts? He won't be a distraction."
True enough. Draco tsked and kept quiet. After a raucous breakfast, Scorpius talked his father into giving Teddy a box of cookies to share with the Weasley children. Draco took some dirty dishes to the kitchen and hunted around for an appropriate container to house the ginger snaps. Harry wandered in after him and said, "I didn't expect Astoria this morning."
Teddy flicked his wand at the door and uttered, "
Harry saved face by saying, "We'll see if he's free that weekend, okay? It's a long way away, in any case."
"Hello," Scorpius answered.
"I'm sorry," Hermione apologized and she patted down Scorpius' ruffled hair.
A flurry of questions flooded his mind. What just happened? Surely Harry hadn't... Why did they...?
The two of them scowled at each other.
" he recited.
And when he gently laid their precious baby boy against her chest, she was filled with insurmountable emotion. She couldn't stop herself from pressing kisses onto Scorpius' warm cheeks. And when she looked up at Draco and saw him mouth 'thank you', she believed him. Wholeheartedly…
"Because I'm sick, Harry," Scorpius explained again. He was the epitome of patience. "And it's still cold outside. I'll get more sick."
Startled, Draco brought a hand up between them, stopping Harry from stepping any nearer.
Luna didn't seem the least bit impressed after Harry had finished speaking. That was partly due to the fact that she had been peering through a set of binoculars the entire time without comment, staring up at the trees for something Harry couldn't see or hear. He couldn't be entirely sure if she
"About time," Draco muttered. He was minutes away from a mental breakdown and he would hate to give those Aurors the satisfaction. He knew he could be detained for twenty-four hours without cause because of his criminal record. He just never realized that things would come to that. He snatched his jacket off the chair and stalked out, making sure to glare at the Hit wizard the whole time. It was the least he could do. Three hours in that godforsaken room, enough to drive a man mad.
"Hey," Theo mock whispered. "I hear your teacher's Harry Potter."
"It was in the house, along with a few records. Found it in Sirius' room," Harry said. "I doubt his parents knew about it."
Then, finally, Teddy clapped his hands together once, breaking the staring contest. "Well, I think it's rubbish, what they say about you." He sank back deep into the musty, old couch. "Scorpius is a great kid. So you can't be all that bad. And you're pretty good at healing too. Usually Harry has to check with Aunty Hermione to make sure he's done it right, you know? You'd think, after all this time, he would know how to mend himself. Merlin knows he hurts himself often enough. Last time he was trying to make bread and the dough practically took over the entire kitchen. Got our socks stuck in it. It was like a bog creature. Smelt like one too." Teddy itched his nose. "Anyway, do you guys want to see something?"
"It'll get here when it gets here."
walked fast. He was always in a hurry. If Scorpius didn't hurry, then he would be left behind. He couldn't wait to be taller so he wouldn't have to keep hurrying like this. He nearly tripped over a sidewalk crack but quickly caught himself with a small stumble. Oh yes, hurrying wasn't fun at all.
"Yes?"
"I've tried many times. But he keeps telling me the same thing all the time." Scorpius shook his head sadly, as though feeling very sorry for his idiot father. "Maybe you should tell him it's not true. He'll believe you." Scorpius felt that sometimes Harry seemed to have more of an influence on Draco.
The Holyhead Harpies were indeed quite a surprise entry into the World Cup that would be taking place that summer. They deserved all the success because they had been training day and night for that one shot. Harry was very proud of Ginny and looking forward to what the year would bring. "Best season they've had in ten years, I'd say."
Sometimes Draco couldn't stand how easygoing Harry was. He tugged Harry closer, circling his arms around Harry's waist. "I won't fault you for changing your mind."
"Great," she beamed. "You can't very well cook with just one arm."
"I'm sorry."
There was a photo of Draco and Scorpius kneeling beside a spotted lamb in the petting zoo. Scorpius had had to coax Draco into entering the pen, let alone touch the animals. The Malfoys had enthralled one particular lamb. It had come up to them without much prompt, eager to be held. The photographer had caught that moment when Scorpius picked up the lamb and Draco had backed away with a horrified expression on his face.
Harry Potter pulled himself out of his muggy dreams only to wake up in his stuffy bedroom with a storm beating against the windowpane. Lightning briefly lit up the cramped space as he blinked groggily to glance around. Just a nightmare, he thought to himself. He swallowed to wet his sandpapery throat before falling back into his sweat-soaked pillows. But just as he curled onto his side, the loud pounding started up again.
"Not really." Scorpius just had a feeling. "Why do you fight all the time?"
Harry snorted and wondered why he was surprised that this enormous manor could have a wine cellar. It certainly had an ominous dungeon prison. A wine cellar was quite the upgrade considering that. He followed Draco. "How many rooms do you have in this place?"
"Your Dark Mark. Has Scorpius ever asked about it?"
"Well, that's too bad."
Scorpius turned bright red. What on Earth was Harry talking about? "I-I don't know. I have to ask my father," he stammered out.
Harry nodded. It's what he had been saying over and over again to anyone who would listen. He brushed his cheeks dry. "Yes. Everything will go back to the way they were. It's only a matter of time."
Scorpius smiled.
"No, you are not. You are not useless." Harry tightened his arms around Draco. "You are worried. You have a lot on your plate." He had no idea Draco was feeling this way. He didn't know Draco
Less than five minutes later, Harry and Scorpius were on their way down the gravel path, walking away from the manor. Scorpius glanced over his shoulder to wave at his father. "Ooh, he is not very happy," he noted with an impish smirk directed at Harry.
"Also, sorry for what's about to happen now." Harry gestured at the door just as it shot open to reveal Molly, Arthur, Hermione, and George, with an embarrassed Ron and Patricia hanging back behind them.
Harry asked Gabrielle for a minute. She was surprised at the sight of Draco Malfoy, but didn't ask any questions. She nodded stiffly before walking out the classroom and closing the door behind her.
"Sure, you can. Do you want chocolate ice-cream or strawberry ice-cream?"
"You just want to eat ice-cream with me, don't you?" Harry guessed.
"Most likely."
"Yes."
"Scorpius?"
"Mhm."
"Like what?" Draco bristled with a defensive scowl furrowing his forehead.
Harry snapped his teeth together, clamping his mouth shut. Ron and Hermione exchanged a look. Hiding his annoyance, just barely, behind a low grunt, Harry turned away from them as he shuffled the letters into a neat pile and began walking out the room.
"What did Mum say?" Scorpius wanted to know.
in love with this wonderful girl he had grown up with, gone to Hogwarts with. People say they were perfect for each other. Quidditch mad, full of adventures and magic."
"You seemed alright with him," another emboldened voice chirped from the other side of the room.
"With a Death Eater," Bill interjected.
"Oh... Okay."
Scorpius was surprised when he woke up in his own bedroom the next morning. Last thing he could remember was being on Harry's couch. A warm weight pressed against his stomach, and when he looked down he found his father's arm draped over him. He was wrapped in a hug. This felt nice. He tilted his head up to look at Draco's slumbering expression. It wasn't often that he awoke before his father. The sun was barely breaking out of the sky. Scorpius snuggled against Draco and yawned. He had dreamt of chocolates and magic that night, and it had tasted amazing. He smiled when he remembered the secret sandwich he had for dinner with Harry.
He turned back and started to say, "Listen-" Then he glanced away from Draco, over his shoulder, at the grand staircase.
Scorpius placed his hand on his father's cheek and said, "Harry's so nice to me. He always smiles at me."
"Stop inculcating my son!" Draco whacked Theo's hand away.
"He was worried."
"Ugh."
And, sure enough, the candy started to pop and fizz in their mouth. "Ah!" Scorpius exclaimed before clapping a hand to his mouth.
They moved in unison, breaths mingling with urgency, tasting unfamiliar intimacy. Their fingers curled into fists, bunching fabric with a quiet rustle, as though holding onto an elusive moment. Desire made their stomach twist, knees weak, and mind swirl. They were drowning in a surreal kiss until they had to break apart with a strangled gasp.
have a right. As his teacher,
"Well, you see, one of my boys got up on the roof. I was trying to get him down and he fell on me. But it's all good. I'm mended. You can go home."
Harry turned bright red. "You're still here."
Snow fell on the first week on November, ringing in winter. Scorpius was sorely disappointed by the turn of events. He complained to Harry at school that he shouldn’t have to stop flying just because it snowed a bit. Besides, when he goes to Hogwarts, sometimes he would have to fly in the snow, which means he needed to start practicing now. Harry assured him that he still had five years to practice. Scorpius wasn’t satisfied with the response, but he was in no real position to argue either. As it is, he had pushed his luck with the whole flying lesson business.
"I like secrets."
"Dad says-"
What if Malfoy needed actual medical attention, not just a patch up job? Should he be at St. Mungo's? What if he died on the couch? Then Harry would have a real mess on his hands. He abruptly faced the fire. Hermione. But then he shook his head. Bad idea. One look at Malfoy and she would throw common sense out the window. A lot of people did that after one look at Malfoy. He glanced back at the man. He wouldn't be surprised if that was exactly what had happened that night. Some drunken mob wanting revenge. It didn't matter that the war had ended over ten years ago, or that justice should be left to the Magical Law Enforcement officers to deal out, or that all parties involved with the Dark Army had already been through Wizengamot, either ending up imprisoned or on probation. Harry ran a hand through his untamed hair as he continued to pace. He had tried his best to clean up Malfoy's injuries. At least his face was no longer blood covered, the salve should take care of the scarring, and his wrist didn’t appear to be in two pieces.
Harry shook his head, unsure what Draco was meaning to say. "What? What's 'all this'?" He didn't understand.
"I guess we can all be babies sometimes," Harry told him.
They finished their tea in silence after that.
That afternoon, as the day was coming to an end, the students had some study time before school let out. The classroom buzzed with a quiet din as children painstakingly worked on their shapes. Scorpius was engrossed in his work, keeping the book steady with one hand and dragging his pencil down the page with the other.
"You're just going to mope?"
"With good reason," Draco mumbled.
Harry stretched his legs out in front of him and watched the crackling fire. The sun had set, so the flames cast a warm orange glow in the otherwise dark grounds of the Malfoy Manor. Draco sat opposite him, poking at the embers with a stick. Scorpius and Teddy were making s'mores.
A bright grin broke over Scorpius' face. He pressed a kiss on Draco's cheek.
Draco Malfoy stirred restlessly on the musty couch, looking very much worse for wear. His right eye was swollen shut, his lips were split in three places, there were cuts all over his hands, a slash across his chest, a wrist broken, and a few ribs cracked.
for crying out loud!"
Draco hung his head in defeat.
"What's so great about being nice?"
"I really am. Would I be in good spirits if I wasn't?"
Harry slumped in his seat and thought about ignoring her. He had been skirting her for ages. He dragged himself towards the fireplace. Ginny gestured for him to sit down on the rug and he obeyed without a word. Then she cleared her throat and made a show of holding up a piece of paper.
Theo left an hour later, thoroughly dissatisfied from the results of his attempted interrogation. Draco was glad for the silence once he had shut the front door. These days he was valuing his time alone and not having to constantly worry about how he appeared to others. He let out a quiet sigh as he flicked the lights off in the foyer. Sometimes he wondered if he should get better friends.
"So, when you kissed me, that was-"
"But it's been two days."
At that moment, Draco was ready to say anything to get Harry off his case. Anything to go back to the way things were. "Yes." No sooner had he said it, he saw Harry's sharp green eyes darting over him, searching, seeing right through him. "Already forgotten."
He let go of Harry. He didn't know what had come over him. He stuffed his tingling hand into his pocket as he turned away and let the crowd pull him out the front doors of Gringotts. He ducked his head against the wind, his ears tinged pink even though he had just stepped out into the snow. He shook the embarrassment away with some effort as he picked his way out of the lunch rush.
"Coy, as always."
"You could stay."
"No." Draco didn't add that the reason was because Astoria had a new fling every month. If she kept them abreast of her love life, they would be going cross-eyed with the sheer number of names they'd have to remember. "Bad example, Potter."
Scorpius groaned, "That's disgusting, Father."
"That's me. Wild." Harry grabbed another bottle. "I've got two, just in case."
. Isn't that what you said?" He looked out at the bright blue sky, not a cloud in sight. "Sun's still up." He looked down at her legs. "Feet still on. That's good."
Harry placed hot cups of tea on the table, along with the sugar bowl and some milk. He sat across from the Malfoys, elbow on the table, cheek propped up on his fist. "So?"
"Everything," he lamented. "I couldn't do it. I got scared. I'm so stupid!"
Scorpius gasped and clapped a hand to his mouth. "Oops." So much for that promise. "I wasn't supposed to tell you."
"That's settled then," Harry sealed the deal. "You can come by for lunch. Saturday around twelve?"
Draco blinked back to the present with a faint frown as he glanced over at Harry. "What?"
family," he remarked.
The Burrow was absolutely packed like a winter market in Central London. There were Weasleys and Weasley-adjacent in every nook and cranny of the home. Plates of pastries and sweets appeared on a whim for the guests, cups of hot apple cider going along with the never-ending snack. Children shrieked with excitement as they unearthed toys from gift bags and wrapping paper. Most of the Weasleys were sporting sweaters from Molly. Conversation was loud and laughter even more jovial. A typical Christmas morning.
"Pardon?"
The doorbell rang.
He gritted his teeth. At times like this, he was just fed up with his life. "I don't know," he snapped. "Every time a damned leaf falls, they haul me in. Justice knows no bounds."
Teddy's voice carried through the chatter, causing the room to grow hushed.
Draco sputtered.
Scorpius nodded once.
"Give me one good reason he has to spend Halloween at home."
"Mhm."
"Yes?"
"I couldn't very well just leave Teddy here, could I?" Harry answered.
"Try it."
This had to be the epitome of emotional blackmail.
"What's the plan?"
"These brats have you going soft," Ron muttered under his breath at his best friend.
Harry blinked. "Huh?"
"It's kind of scary," Scorpius admitted. "And I'm not even that high up."
He tried to remember the last time he had seen Malfoy. It must have been right after the war ended. At the time, his bitterness was strong and palpable. He hadn't even acknowledged the teen's presence in court. That family deserved whatever was dealt to them, he had thought then. But now, seeing Malfoy stumble into his home in the middle of the night, he couldn't help but feel abject pity. How the mighty had fallen.
Ginny glared at him to keep him quiet before continuing to recite, "What is her name? Have you seen her? Nanna says Harry's heart is broken. Is it bad? Can you look for his girlfriend?"
"Psst. Harry."
Over the course of the night, he must have fallen asleep at the desk because, when he woke up, his neck and back were killing him and... something else.
"Okay!"
Luna Lovegood tossed a pinch of salt over one shoulder and sugar over the other before digging into tea and scones. She had picked up very peculiar tics following her trips to South America. Her greenhouse was filled with exotic plants, bugs, reptiles, and birds. Harry had to duck a few times to stop a purple moonjay from making a nest in his hair. He pushed a translucent lizard away from the butter dish. "I see you've brought a few friends back from the expedition this time."
her. "We're too comfortable with each other. That can be a problem too."
Draco rested a hand against his stomach, quelling the butterflies, and leaned back against the counter. Let it happen. He pondered the thought. A day at a time, just let it happen. Isn't that what he had been doing all this while?
Harry stilled. He lifted his head to look at Draco in the dim light. Hesitating a beat, he asked, "Is this okay?"
As the door swung shut, Draco could hear his son saying, "Do you like kissing my dad, Harry?" followed by an exhausted groan from Harry and an emphatic shriek of disgust from Teddy.
"Scorpius?"
glare. But eventually everyone grew used to that. He had attempted to be as unapproachable as possible but, being a rather charismatic boy, his ploys of keeping to himself after class and fixating on his schoolwork wasn't cutting it. As Halloween came upon Hogwarts fast, he grew resigned to the fact that everyone had something to say to him but no one wanted to be the first to poke the bear.
"Then why did you come over?"
Theo was oblivious, or at least seemed oblivious, as he waited for Harry's response. "You don't have any plans tonight, do you?"
"Here and there."
Astoria held up her hands in surrender. "I know, I know." She then folded her hands on her lap. "Maybe I should be more direct." For a brief moment, something akin to vulnerability flashed over her face. "I want to spend Christmas with my son."
Compared to them, the children were having a much more fun time together.
"Why won't it work?"
Harry pulled a few blades of grass from beside him, feigning an interest in them as he said, "What did he say about me?"
"I thought you were going to stop being needy."
Draco stared at Harry and Scorpius in shock, his hand still gripping the doorknob tight. All Patricia had told him was that they were at St. Mungo's. That was enough to send him panicking. Now here he was looking at Harry kneeling beside Scorpius, as though nothing was the matter.
"-stepping over boundaries without a care-"
Astoria marched into the dining room, loudly proclaiming, "He won't give me the ginger snaps." That was followed by a chorus of protests. Draco slumped his shoulders in defeat. Always the villain. There was no winning in this house.
He was asleep under the covers within seconds.
Scorpius couldn't either. He simply nodded and watched his feet as he scurried to keep up with Harry's strides. He was used to hurrying. His father
," he said excitedly. "It's marvelous."
loud, so he hoped Astoria would be able to hear him over everyone else's.
alright with this." He had been right about feeling regretful. Remarkable how instantly he had felt that regret. "This never happened." He began rolling down his sleeves while waiting for an answer. When he didn't get one, he glared at Harry. "It's forgotten. Understood?"
He managed to say, "Hello. I'm calling from Scorpius' school."
not-so-proper family." Teddy sprang up to his feet and pulled out a photo album from the bookshelf before sitting down. Scorpius leaned in to gape at the moving photographs. "These are the Weasleys."
Harry sat beside him one afternoon as they got ready for nap-time. "Why don't you join that kickball game this afternoon, Scorpius? I heard they need more players."
"Maybe you and I can practice together next time. That's what we'll do," Harry suggested. "Just like how I help some of your friends with their shapes and colours, I'll help you with your singing. I know Michael and Lisa were
The silence that followed was stifling.
"No, what are you doing
"No."
Harry tilted his head and murmured, "No, it isn't."
"Absolutely not."
"So?"
"How does it look?" Harry beamed. "It's a Muggle festival!"
Draco seemed quite displeased at having had to wait outside for the past three minutes in sleeting rain and melting slush. He didn't have time to wait for Harry to return to his senses as well. He pushed his way through into the house and shut the door behind him. "We need to talk."
To say Astoria was livid would be an understatement. Draco had to silence the study so her explosive ranting couldn't be overheard by their son.
Harry followed suit and lay down as well, shoulder to shoulder with Draco. He stared up at the breezy canopy above them. "If it hadn't been for me, you'd drink the potion and they'd know you were telling the truth. Easy."
"Yeah!"
Harry chuckled. "In an ideal world, sure." He returned to the topic at hand. "What you're saying is that you wouldn't tell Scorpius anything if you were seeing someone else."
"I didn't think he would have more fun at a birthday party with his friends," Astoria mused.
"I can't blow up a sandwich, in any case," Harry added.
a love letter, isn't it?" Teddy gagged.
reason Ginny was the coolest aunt - she always brought presents.
"Will I get in trouble with your mum and dad?"
"Nothing," Draco said while continuing to watch Harry.
Draco shuddered as another wave of nausea hit him.
Harry had jogged down to them by then, skidding to a halt. "What's going on?"
Ginny poked him in the stomach. "I'm not mad."
Harry hid his surprise well when he heard the question. Scorpius had
Harry reached up to push his glasses down off the top of his head, while doing so revealing his bewildered smile. "Quite possibly."
"Well, you win," Draco spat out. "Because I'm the bad father in all this, aren't I? Happy?"
"Nobody."
taken Scorpius out with him. Scorpius was holding onto Teddy's hand tight and gawking at everything. Draco knew that when Scorpius grew older, he would start resenting the sheltered childhood he had led. But, for now, Draco would protect his son as much as possible. Strolling down the street with Harry Potter was about as much protection as anyone could get. That didn't stop Draco from worrying incessantly.
"You're okay, Scorpius," some of the children said. "Maybe you'll get a cast!"
"I'll go with Harry."
Scorpius responded with a sad sniff. He had his eyes closed and he was clutching a stuffed golden-brown bear fiercely.
"Huh?" Harry was caught unaware with a piece of pie halfway to his mouth. "Why?"
"We're using leaves in art class."
They appeared in front of Ron and Hermione's home where the Weasley children were rearing to begin their pilgrimage to get as much candy as they possibly could in the span of a short few hours. "Oof," Ron said at the sight of Scorpius in his zombie get-up. "Spooky."
"Oh yes," Luna picked the lizard up and placed it on a nearby plant. "This has been an awfully productive summer for me. I've almost completed the book, you know?"
Draco noticed Harry approaching them and said, "Not bad."
tradition where parents are encouraged to purchase extravagant costumes for their children, who are encouraged to knock at strangers' doors-"
"No!" Draco objected as he raced back into the room with a glass of his much needed scotch. "No, no, no! No, you won't! Don't tell him anything!"
"Is that what you like?"
"Are you an idiot?" Ron genuinely wondered aloud.
Harry knew that feeling. He had felt the same apprehension when Teddy had started riding a broomstick. "You will," he assured Draco. They began walking to the manor. "One day you'll look at him and see yourself. You'll get used to it."
Everyone pretended to not see Draco. He was used to being invisible. It was better than a confrontation.
"That's no fun."
"What about Harry Potter's place?"
Harry knew then that Scorpius would have no trouble winning over the Weasleys with his solemn words. Hermione was already taken, he could tell. Teddy came up behind them and yanked Scorpius away from the midst of all the adults, spinning him around so the little Weasleys could get a good look at him. "This is my
Theo picked him up with a happy laugh. He was always glad that Scorpius wasn't one of those kids who whined and sniveled all over their parents. This little boy was someone Theo had no trouble spending a day with.
"Teddy says you and Harry are boyfriends."
Draco picked Scorpius up and disapparated from the school grounds, landing in their foyer. But he didn't let go. Scorpius let his father hold him, carefully staying still and not saying a word. He knew what Draco meant when he was hugged like this.
"See you tomorrow, Scorpius," Harry said.
Teddy's impressions brought about roars of laughter once everyone was inside, trying to escape afternoon summer heat and humidity. Scorpius lounged on the rug, lulled into a sleepy stupor despite holding Hugo on his lap. The baby was half-asleep as well, leaning heavily against his new best friend and sucking his thumb. Scorpius held him tight, just like Hermione and Harry had showed him, but his eyes kept drooping. It was past time for his nap, after all. When two o'clock struck, he was out cold with his head nestled against Harry's lap and his arms hugging a small cushion close. Many of the other children were the same way. The adults had mismatched mugs in hand filled with lukewarm tea and were chatting. Harry absently patted Scorpius' arm while listening to George's retelling of the fiasco at his shop in Diagon Alley last weekend.
"No," Scorpius said honestly. "There are too many choices."
Scorpius tsked and immediately moved onto poor Harry. "Harry, come play!" He grabbed Harry's arm and tried to pull him up.
Rose Weasley, a plump red-headed toddler with a heart of gold, patted Harry's cheek, a cute pout bunching her lips together. "Ouchie?"
"Are you feeling okay?" Draco asked incredulously as he apparated to the Malfoy Manor.
"Do you have
"Hmm?"
He scrambled towards it.
"No."
"Good."
Harry stuffed his gloved hands into his pockets and scuffed the snow with his shoe. "There's not much to tell." He looked at Draco who was once again furiously shaking his head and mouthing 'no' at him. Scorpius watched his father, amused by his antics but not making a comment.
Astoria quirked an unimpressed brow. "Pleasure." She glanced at Harry. "Is he hurt?"
He thought he saw Draco's lips twitch briefly, but it could have been a trick of the light.
One afternoon, in cold January, Harry was on his way in from recess when he was called to the front office for a message. After ensuring all the children were accounted for, he made his way down there and got a note from the secretary. He frowned at it for a good minute, ignoring the quizzical looks he was getting from everyone in the hallway, before stuffing the parchment into his pocket and returning to class.
"Was I a complete fool?"
"Yes. I know. Now drink up, Mr. Potter, or I'll have to call your doctor over and I'm sure he'd be more than willing to prescribe something else. I hear the stronger stuff literally burns as it goes down."
Theo stood up and gave Scorpius a final pat on the head. "Ready." He turned to Harry and Draco who appeared nonchalant and like nothing was the matter at all. Theo knew then that dinner would be a good time. "Let's go." He pulled Draco along, Scorpius leading the pack on their way out the schoolyard.
person living with you?"
"What are
He was scanning through the bookshelves of the Malfoy library when he felt a soft graze at his side that made him jump a foot in the air and sent books tumbling down.
that. Everyone keeps hiding it but I know. I know they're mad at you for liking me and my father and I know family's important to you and I
"I'm not giving up yet," Teddy said with a firm nod. "George never lies."
Scorpius cast Harry a sideways glance that read, 'Seriously?'
He almost never had sandwiches. Draco didn't think it was real food. He had pasta or casseroles or chicken or fish instead. Patricia was quite good at those. Scorpius liked the idea of sandwiches. Whenever he saw his classmates eating them, he would get a little jealous. It looked yummy with red jam in the middle. He always brought stir-fry to school. While he got many compliments on how good his lunch smelled, he would glance longingly at the sandwiches in his friends' lunchboxes. Maybe Harry had jam in his house. He hoped so.
Teddy promised Scorpius that they would hang out at least once a week during their summer break. Teddy was a man of his word.
"Don't tell me to shut up. It kills the mood."
"I could double your horde in fifteen years," Theo insisted.
"Alright." Harry downed the last of the tea in one gulp. "How am I supposed to say no to him?" He looked at Draco expectantly.
"I was worried." Scorpius snatched the napkins out of Draco's hands. He began placing them beside the plates. "That's not a problem."
Harry arched his brows theatrically. "My mistake. I didn't realize you were such a catch."
get dressed. Trust me." He tried to wrangle away from Harry, but Harry held firm. Draco let out a heavy sigh, piqued a brow, and asked, "Again?"
"It's fine." Draco cupped the mug in his hands, letting the heat warm him through. He didn't move to step away from the fire, so neither did Harry. They stood there listening to the rain and crackling logs for a minute. Gave them a minute to collect their thoughts. Last time they saw each other, things had gone slightly awry. Draco decided to start. "Can we forget about what happened?"
He would rather make it happen.
Scorpius nodded into his book.
"Oh, well," Patricia giggled and waved a self-conscious hand at the little boy. "I'm a little too old for him. Besides, he would never notice someone like me."
Scorpius thought it best to change the subject, so he asked Harry, "Wait, who fell on you?"
Draco smirked at Harry. "For what it's worth?" he echoed.
Harry smiled wanly as he got up. "He gets nervous. He wants to be perfect for you, that's all." He shrugged. "He's getting better, though. I'll make sure he's more comfortable in front of a crowd."
They never ended up finding the peacocks, even though they walked all around the snowy grounds for almost an hour. Scorpius still had a great time though, kicking around in the snow, trying to follow what he insisted were peacock tracks, and delaying naptime.
Harry jerked his arm away, fuming. "I know that."
Harry shot up to his feet. "Did something like what, Ron?! What's the real problem here?"
"Because it's Christmas Eve, everyone comes to the Burrow," Teddy explained. "That's where Aunty Molly and Uncle Arthur live. It's always crowded in there, so it's a lot of fun."
Draco didn't even glance at Harry as his attention honed in on Scorpius sleeping in Harry's arms. He reached out instinctively.
"It's two in Moscow. After lunch," Astoria replied.
That's exactly what Scorpius did the next day. He waited patiently in the emptying corridor with a lunchbox clutched in his hands, counting the little five-year-old children leaving the classroom. He was nervous, evidenced by his shoe tapping on the floor. If he was nervous, then he was doing the right thing. That's what he kept telling himself. The stream of kids subsided as everyone funneled into the mess hall for lunch. Only once the last student was out the room did Harry appear at the doorway, wand in hand as he began to flick the lights off. He paused when he saw Scorpius in the corridor. "Oh. Hello."
"I don't like him."
Draco didn't voice his comments, but he really hoped Scorpius wouldn't carry that invitation in his head for too long. He knew that the Weasleys would be less than inclined to have a Malfoy in their home. They had been rather vocal about their stance on his family during the Death Eater trials after the war had ended. He doubted that their feelings had changed much even after all these years.
Harry was quick to put him at ease. "Everyone gets sick at least once a year. It's a miracle that you haven't ever gotten sick before."
That wasn't what Scorpius was expecting when he barged into the hospital room.
"No, no, no," Draco murmured. He ran his hand down Scorpius' shins. "There are no spiders." He didn't know what to do. He tried to remember what his mother had done when he had gotten fevers. He couldn't remember much of it. Hot soups and cold baths? A quiet song?
Harry stepped away.
Draco and Harry had a lot of 'problem solved' moments.
"No." Draco finally finished brewing his coffee and set the implements aside before bringing the cup up to his lips.
Harry was too confused to argue otherwise. "I know. I'm stupid." He knelt down on one knee. "Scorpius?"
"Must be."
There was something about Draco Malfoy.
He woke up with a jolt.
Harry bit the side of cheek when he realized that Scorpius didn't think it was okay at all. "Alright, what should we do to make it more perfect?"
"Just me," Harry said quietly.
a present?"
"I didn't. I just said you've got dirt on your face."
"Chocolate?" Scorpius gasped before he could stop himself.
"Good. Because I didn't and wouldn't," Harry said. He was lounging on the couch, drinking a cold Butterbeer. "It's a present from Ginny."
looking for a bird. For all he knew, she was taking a long, leisurely look at the leaves in the wind. Either way, he didn't have anything more to say, so he was silent. They stood in that silence for a few minutes. They were in the middle of a bird sanctuary and it was the crack of dawn. Luna was in the final stages of publishing her book, and the only way to catch up with her was to meet her in the bog, river, or forest where she was doing last-minute research. Harry would meet her anywhere if she could grant him this favour.
"Yes, Scorpius."
"My father's going to be upset with you."
"You're giving me
"You're nicer than him, though," Harry said. He watched Scorpius to see if he had elicited a reaction from the boy. When he hadn't, he added, "Don't tell him I said that."
"Is this enough?"
Not a dull moment... Harry rolled his eyes as he perched on the edge of his cluttered desk and fished the neat parchment from under the stack of envelopes. He began to read it.
His wand wasn't on him.
"Yes?"
"You were right."
"He's nicer than you, so I might start liking him more." Scorpius grinned smugly at his father and planted his fists on his hips. "You'll be sorry. What will you do then?"
"He appreciates
Their conversation was interrupted by a timer chiming from the kitchen.
"Yes."
Another pause filled their conversation, at which point Harry was trying to figure out how best to say that Scorpius might need to go home. But before he could speak-
"Because I don't want to be late for my first day."
"What do you mean what's he like?" Teddy harrumphed. "He's great! Best little scamp."
Harry kept up with these two, he'd never understand.
Draco all but stomped a foot on the ground in frustration before storming away, leaving the two lunatics in their madhouse for the next hour while he angrily glared at some paperwork in the library downstairs. That's where Harry found him and decided to confront him.
Nothing less, but nothing more.
"Yes, all clean."
"Is that all you wanted to ask me?" Harry pressed him.
Draco growled in frustration as he pushed his fingers through his hair. At the moment, it seemed to be Harry's mission to humiliate him. That mission was going a little too well. Theo's taunt rang in his head - you can never be friends. Truer words hadn't been spoken, but surely this wasn't what Theo had in mind. This wasn't what anyone had in mind.
Draco shook his head. "What do you have to be sorry about?"
Harry noticed Scorpius in his reindeer get-up and his eyes lit up. "Look at you!" he exclaimed.
Dejected, he sat on the bathroom floor, all hope lost. He inspected his broken-now-mended wrist. He touched his painful ribs, feeling the gauze running diagonally across his torso. He brushed his thumb over his swollen eye. He licked his split lips. "Pathetic.”
"No." Harry didn't want to colour. He wanted to get out of the house. It was an unusually warm winter morning. Snow was beginning to melt off the trees. But the Malfoys were a couple of homebodies most of the time. "I'm bored."
Scorpius clicked his tongue. "Alright," he huffed. "Holyhead Harpies. She's his
"Malfoy."
"That's generally what investing is." Theo jerked his thumb at Draco. "He hordes his money, won't let anyone get a piece of it."
no one liked his father. That was the reason for his irritability when he saw Draco being treated poorly. There weren't many people who could recognize the Malfoys anymore. It had been so long since the war, after all. Draco's deep-seated insecurities were the cause for most of their hiding and intense privacy. However, his insecurities stemmed from a few incidents that occurred during the first five years after the war had ended.
Scorpius rarely asked for things. Draco often made sure he didn't need to ask. But when it came to spending time with Scorpius, all Draco knew was to watch him draw and read with him. When Scorpius was younger, they would spend time in the large grounds surrounding the manor. But the two of them had never ventured outside their sanctuary together before. Draco had never initiated it, and Scorpius certainly hadn't either. Until today. With Patricia available almost everyday for Scorpius' needs, Draco had never really needed to play with his son. But now his son was coming to him, wanting to spend time with him.
"Gotten him into heaps of trouble already too," Harry said under his breath as he walked into the room smelling a bit less like tomatoes. "Lunch?"
"How fat was this kid?" Ron muttered under his breath as he took a closer look at his friend's injuries. "Let's see."
"I hate surprises," Draco grumbled under his breath. He went unheard.
"Right, of course." Harry let go of Draco and stepped back. "This happens now." He looked down at the wand he had wrenched away. "Let's make sure you don't hex me," he muttered under his breath as he kicked it away. It rolled off under the couch. "Sorry. Wrong house." He raised his hands in surrender although his lips were beginning to quirk up into that frightening smile again. He picked up the apple he had dropped during their struggle. "Thanks for the snack," he said and brushed it free of dirt. He slunk out of the foyer on light feet, disappearing into the deep night as mysteriously as he had appeared. The roar of a heavy motorcycle sounded from the street. A few seconds later, the bike had already moved far beyond earshot, leaving Draco truly alone.
Draco let out a tired sigh.
He sighed in frustration as he dragged his hands over his face, his tired eyes closing on their own accord. "I'm at my wit's end." Some days were worse than others. "They said they had an eyewitness. If it hadn't been for you, I don't know what I would have done."
"Harry Potter?"
Draco read the note a few times.
"Ron." Harry finally looked up at his friend. "Can we not talk about this?"
Theo smirked. "And how's this little guy doing?" He ruffled Scorpius' hair, not minding the squeaky protests.
star? Please?"
Scorpius sifted around the mass of pencil crayons lying beside him to find the perfect shade of orange. "Do you want to colour with me?" he offered.
"Wh-That's not-I wasn't-" Harry heard Draco stammer, prompting him to look back.
Draco snorted in derision. That would be the day.
"-a mistake?" Harry paused. "Wait, spontaneous?"
Draco clenched his fists in his pockets. "What are you saying, Potter?"
Harry held out a hand, asking Draco to help him up. As Draco pulled him upright, he remarked, "Haven't I always?"
"Yes."
"Oh no," Teddy groaned as he grabbed Harry's wrist and looked at the cut on his palm. "Harry, why are you like this?"
"Oh, I hope I get brilliant teachers again."
Why won't the dough rise? Just make flat crust pizza. Problem solved.
Astoria, still seated on the rug, looked at Draco with forced patience. "I didn't realize you two were getting on again."
Scorpius opened his eyes to reveal tears welled up in them. He looked down at the bear as though just noticing that he was all but strangling the poor doll. He relaxed his grip as best he could while still hugging it close.
"Astoria has been busy," Draco corrected Harry. "She's done as she pleases to this place and gone off to her parties, leaving me to deal with it." He kicked some of the Christmas carnage further under the tree to hide it. "I'll be busy after she's gone, cleaning this up."
He was startled when he felt hands on either side of him. It was time for the children to hold hands. It was part of the song and they had practiced this so often. But Scorpius couldn't get his hands to move. Annie and Tim had to wrestle his fists away from his sides. He held onto their hands tight once they had managed to grab on. Annie squeezed his clammy hand many times to reassure him. It helped. His voice picked up a bit. He focused on Harry again who was nodding in time with the song with a proud grin on his face. Although his teacher wasn't looking at him, he still felt some of that excitement seeping in.
Harry felt Ginny's breath against his neck, the tickle of her fiery hair at his ear. He was reminded of the conversation he had had with Draco, what he had said about his brief marriage with Astoria, how they hadn't tried to keep it together and that Scorpius was now caught in the middle of it all. How they had walked away once they learned that their life together was not going to work out, that they wanted different things. He started wondering what walking away would be like.
"Look at you," Harry cheered, standing beside the floating boy and his small broomstick. "Not so bad, right?"
"No." Scorpius snatched the mug from his father and gulped the milk down in three huge swigs. He wiped his milk mustache with the back of his hand as he handed the empty mug back. Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust. "What do you mean he had to go?" Scorpius marched over to his stool and used it to hop up onto the countertop. "He hasn't had his ice-cream yet."
And that's how Draco Malfoy found himself alone in a spare bedroom with a bundle of clothes in his arms.
It was another half an hour before there was a knock at the front door.
He was stopped by Scorpius, who chided, "Tantrums are not allowed. Harry said it's going to be fun, so it's going to be fun."
Scorpius giggled. It certainly would look pretty funny. He could imagine it right now. He held up his peanut butter flower. "This one's nice."
"Oh my God," Teddy squeaked. He raised horrified eyes at Harry and dramatically dropped the letter as though it had burned him. "Ew, ew, ew. I touched it."
"DADDY! DADDY!"
"Making breakfast."
"Because you shouldn't." Scorpius then resorted to actively turning his back to Harry. He scooted away quickly before hunching over and pressing his hands against his ears so he could read in peace.
"What happened last night?" Harry wanted to know.
"But they aren't the only ones who think that, huh? Everyone thinks you're bad, huh? That's why you don't like to go to the park with me, huh?"
"Well, the feeling is mutual," Draco muttered as he moved to sit on the edge of the bed.
"Can I come over?" Scorpius hesitantly asked.
The plant doesn't look too good? Just dump some water on it. Problem solved.
"Are you saying that because of Scorpius?"
Before he could speak, he was swept into an amorous kiss.
Even though the Malfoys were ultimately pardoned for crimes committed, they still played an enormous role in the mass deaths of the Second War. Lucius and Narcissa escaped the country as soon as possible, but Draco had refused to join them. He didn't want anything to do with his parents after all they had put him through. Most of the Malfoy assets had been possessed by the Ministry, save the manor and some investments. Draco was glad he wasn't left to wander the streets, at least he had a home. He couldn't find a job for ages because no one was willing to be in the room with him for longer than ten minutes. He was ridiculed behind hushed voices and discrete hands. The partitioning wall between the manor and the road was often vandalized with messages written in red. Prejudices ran high.
He bolted upright in bed and snatched his wand from under the pillow. Thunder rolled outside but the hammering at his front door was deafening. He struggled out of his twisted sheets and jammed his glasses against his face before stumbling out of the dark bedroom and into the corridor, down the stairs and towards the foyer. The door was rattling in its hinges. He brought his wand up at the ready. Taking a moment to compose himself, he twitched the wand, throwing the door open.
Scorpius threw his arms around Draco's waist and hugged him tight. Success!
"This is scary..."
What was he waiting for?
Despondent, Harry sighed. There was no mercy in this place. He opened the newspaper, sulking. "Scorp?" He held out a hand. "Can I borrow a pencil?" This would be a boring Sunday, he supposed. He chewed on the end of the red pencil crayon Scorpius had graciously handed him and stared at the crossword puzzle that he was definitely not smart enough to complete. He didn't notice Draco glance up at him.
"Whoa. Hey." Harry interrupted Draco's faltering words and pulled him close. "It's okay."
"I can imagine."
"Oh." Harry Potter relaxed and leaned against the counter. "It's you." He held an apple in one hand and was chewing on a bite. He looked much less threatening when he was turned the right way. His black hair hung across his brow and stuck out every which way atop his head. He wasn't wearing any glasses, oddly enough. He seemed to be growing stubble too.
"Teddy gets a kick out of it." Ron wasn't exaggerating either. Teddy kept a shelf full of tabloids to show off to anyone who broached the subject of stardom. The boy thinks he's hot stuff.
cousin," he announced proudly. "He might look small but he's really smart. Let's play!" He slipped his hand into Scorpius' and pulled him along out the front door and around the side of the house. They were followed by six other children racing so they won't be the last to get to their base near the stone shed. If you were last, you were it.
"Because you would care?"
"Yeah. Potter."
He turned his head to the side, breaking away from the kiss in an attempt to clear his head. Had his fever returned? Most likely. Where was he? At home. He was in the library. What just happened? Harry had woken him up. What was happening now? He glanced up when he heard soft rustling. Harry was still there, perched on the edge of his writing desk, looking down at him. Faded moonlight streamed through the window, casting faint and obscuring shadows around them. This must be a dream.
Draco pulled the splinter out. "It's already working." He flicked the piece of wood at Harry.
Teddy wasn't far behind. He shoved Draco aside and skidded on the sauce in his hurry. "Are you okay?"
Draco looked up at Harry. He hadn't realized until then that he had a faint frown on his brow. He quickly smoothed it out. "Pardon?"
"Teddy is home for the holidays and he wanted to meet Scorpius. Would you like to bring him over this Saturday?"
The mad scramble that ensued lasted seconds, but it felt like ages as they fumbled out of bed while wiping sleep from their eyes and silently threatening to punch each other for not waking up even once through the night. Once presentable, Draco opened the door a crack, so Scorpius couldn't see into the bedroom. "What time is it?"
"But that's just not possible!"
"True." Ron dipped a biscuit into his cider and stirred it around for a moment. "Is Scorpius alright?"
The thirteen year old knew that he had every right to be behaving like an insolent child, so he didn't feel bad at all for sulking. He was sitting by the window, angrily stabbing the wooden frame with the tip of his wand. Harry had been trying to speak with him every day since 'the incident'. The way he saw it, Harry had kept a secret from him for almost a whole year. That meant he was allowed to not talk to Harry for almost a whole year too. He could do that. He wasn't feeling lonely at all. In fact, he was doing just fine without Harry around.
"Do you see her often?"
After brunch came more games, this time with some adults joining in on the fun. They played Stuck in the Mud and Mother May I with hilarious results of Charlie having to twirl on one foot ten times until he toppled over and Angelina waving her arms about wildly at everyone who passed her so she could get 'unstuck' from the mud. Scorpius felt both overwhelmed and delighted to be part of such festivities. He never knew playing with adults could be this much fun. But he had a feeling the Weasleys weren't a regular set of adults.
"What?" he blurted out. "No one's coming to collect me! Why would I need anyone to-"
Draco could burst from the anger rising in him. "You don't know what you're talking about-"
"That's not nice."
"Dad?"
Patricia had already put Scorpius down for the night by the time the two of them walked through the front door. She didn't ask for an explanation and Draco didn't offer any. She patted Draco's arm a couple of times and smiled at Harry before taking her leave. Draco sat in Scorpius' dark bedroom for a little while, watching his son sleep. Harry let them be and stayed downstairs to set the plates for their late dinner. They ate in relative silence. By the time ten struck, Draco was going through the motions of his nighttime routine and didn't look twice at Harry perched at the foot of his bed, watching him the whole time. Or maybe he felt better knowing he wasn't alone. Whatever the case, he eventually sat beside Harry and rocked backwards to fall onto the white duvet.
Draco stifled his annoyed sigh and walked over to the old sofa that threw up a cloud of dust when he sat on it. As he waved the dust out of his face, he said, "I'm trying to be civil." He drank a bit of tea while watching Harry's demeanor. His back was turned. He wore light jeans smeared with dirt and a plain grey tee, crumpled and creased. Tufts of dark hair lay in an untidy mess atop his head, also covered in spiderwebs. He stood with his weight on one foot, using his other foot to poke at some ash that had fallen on the floor. Draco pushed those subconscious observations away. "What do you want, Potter?"
Finally George whipped around to face Ron, who was hiding in the back of the pack. "You said he broke his neck!"
"They're right."
"Not bad?!" Harry exclaimed. "Went pretty great, if you ask me."
"Now, listen here-"
? YOU'RE WHAT? YOU'RE WHAT? YOU'RE
Back downstairs, Harry stood outside the front door, scraping at some ice with his shoe. "That letter was... genuinely unexpected, coming from you."
"You are free to go, Mr. Malfoy," the officer said curtly.
Then he crumpled it in his fist and threw it at the door.
Draco nodded slowly, not quite understanding.
"It's been a while since you've been in here."
"It's not going anywhere."
"Looks that way, yes," Draco murmured.
Once back in Scorpius' bedroom, Draco sat down because he figured they had been tiptoeing around the topic for far too long. Scorpius would be starting Year Two at school tomorrow. Draco wanted him to have a fresh start. "Can you tell me what's bothering you?"
"How would you know?"
"Is he your alibi?"
In the warm orange glow, Draco saw Harry standing before him, no longer shrouded in darkness. Not anyone or no one. Here was someone standing before him.
"You could have stopped me any time. There were many,
"I know Harry's girlfriend's name," Scorpius announced.
Teddy laughed impishly and quickly changed back to himself.
Harry let out a short laugh. "It's not a rule, you know. I don't
Scorpius grabbed the pencil and set about drawing a painstaking star without another word. He drew one small triangle and then an upside-down triangle on top of it, trying to get all the corners pointing the right way. Then he showed it to Harry.
Draco was taken aback by that comment enough to turn to face Harry, incredulous.
"Can I have a birthday party this year?"
Draco slipped his clammy hands into his pockets and cleared his throat. "It's obviously no coincidence that Scorpius is in your class," he told Harry.
"It's going to be great one, squirt." Theo pinched Scorpius' chubby cheeks. "How was your Christmas?"
Harry looked up to find Teddy, Rose, Hugo, Ron, and Hermione snooping on him from the doorway.
He abruptly let go of Harry.
"RUDDY BIRD! GO AWAY!"
" Scorpius danced his way to Draco and pulled him in.
"You'll love this." Ginny rummaged through her open trunk and took out a deep mahogany box. She opened up the latch and pulled the lid off. Nestled inside the box atop red velvet was a round golden object, akin to a Snitch. However, this object also had ruby eyes, a thin, long beak and delicate platinum hooks at the bottom. Harry was dumbfounded as he pulled the figurine out of the box. "It's a Snidget imitation. Do you like it?"
"Kept at it?"
"Do you fancy me?"
"Aw. Where is he?"
Teddy glared at Draco. Draco glared right on back. They glared at each other for what seemed like an eternity to Scorpius.
"Play is not really my thing," Draco reminded him.
"Yes, a short one. Decided to spend an evening with these two." Theo gestured at Draco and Scorpius.
The room once again fell silent. Scorpius hopped up onto the bed, Draco stared at passing cars on the street, and Harry tried to figure out what to do next. "That wasn't so bad." He scrunched his eyes up when he felt a sharp pain in the back of his skull. He shook it off. "Some might even call it civilized."
"Well, that's a big exaggeration," Harry said with a modest shake of his head.
"Has he?" She let out a musical giggle. "He is very unlike the people you surround yourself with nowadays."
The next evening, Scorpius was kneeling on the carpeted floor of his bedroom, laying out all the leaves he had picked up from the park in order of size. They were of all sorts of colours and still damp from the melted snow. He had made sure to pick the most perfect ones and he was quite proud of his collection of ten different leaves.
"Maybe I fancied a sleepover too."
Draco bristled. "I missed the part where any of this is your concern. I don't interrogate you about your relationships."
knew about it."
"I can do what I want with it," Ginny argued. "What else am I supposed to do with it? Carry it around in my trunk? Marvel at it when I'm half-asleep after practice? You'll obviously take better care of it, Harry. When I want it back, I'll ask for it." She placed the box firmly in his hands. "It's for you and you're not allowed to say no on Christmas. Besides, I wouldn't be where I am without you."
"No."
His heart skipped a beat when he blinked at a very surprised Harry. Must be serendipity.
"No. Harry told me he was my family," Scorpius corrected.
Draco pushed through muddled sleep, beginning to wake up because of a strange stirring in his subconscious. It took him a little while, but he finally managed to break free and lift his heavy eyelids. It was still pitch-black outside. He was trying to figure out what had woken him up when he heard a soft rustle beside him. He rolled over onto his other side. When his eyes slowly adjusted to the dark, he could make out a small figure curled in bed beside him. Concerned, he pulled Scorpius into his arms. "What's wrong? Did you have a bad dream?" He hadn't even heard Scorpius come into his room.
Theo scoffed and made a show of looking around the grand dining room they were seated in, fitted with a crystal chandelier above them, white china in front of them, an enormous banquet table, marble floors, and antique paintings. "You say that like you don't live in a mansion, Draco."
"Sorry to disappoint." Harry gestured at the school behind him.
"All we require you to do is provide us with your own statement that proves otherwise. You may submit to Veritaserum testing or provide us with your memory of Saturday night, along with an affidavit that absolves you. It is the simple course of action."
"Does she stay with you over the holidays?"
"Oh, I will," Draco promised him. He flicked his wand across the kitchen to clean up most of the stains. "I happen to know my limitations, which is why I hardly ever set foot in my kitchen."
"Then, then," Scorpius excitedly said, "I got first place in the spelling bee! I got a first place ribbon. And guess what? Harry said he's got a surprise for me for doing so well. He says he'll bring it over tomorrow."
"Do you want to sleep here tonight?"
"Dad?"
Harry was just finishing up his lesson plan in his library when the fireplace suddenly flared orange, startling him into knocking his hand against the inkwell and upsetting it. Before he could duck under the table, Ginny's flickering face appeared in the flames. "Not so fast, Potter!"
"Of course! They were Harry's not-so-proper family first," Teddy said. "Harry's best friends with Ron and Hermione. This is Ron's proper family, actually. They like to add more and more people to their family, that's what I think. You know, Harry and Ron and Hermione met at Hogwarts ages ago. Can you believe they're still friends? They've gone on a lot of adventures together."
Harry and Gabrielle admired Scorpius' project. "My father helped me," he announced proudly to anyone who was listening. "He has nice writing. See?" He gestured at the swirling and elegant words that were written on the very top of the parchment. "He got me this, this, this, this and this," Scorpius added while pointing out the five leaves Draco had collected. "He got them from work for me."
"We haven't spoken to him since summer break, and it's almost Christmas now." Draco thought back to last Christmas, when Harry had made up his mind to mess with both their lives with a bold kiss. He wrung the wooden spoon between his hands. Infuriating. "I suppose he has every right to be angry." He turned to the eggs again, extinguishing the fire and scraping the bottom of the pan sullenly.
"Oh, he wouldn't." Scorpius was very sure of this. "He says chocolates aren't something you eat every day."
"This does not concern you," Draco shot back.
It mattered to Draco because he had spent too long being no one.
"I'm not telling you."
Draco froze cold.
Astoria was arranging the presents under the tree when Draco stormed into the living room. She had heard the door slam shut, but she didn't comment on it. He sat down by the hearth and began peeling off his wet socks, warming himself at the fire. After a few moments of silence, Astoria asked, "Is it strange that I come over for the holidays?"
Teddy huffed and glared at her some more. Victoire was the only person who could stand up to him. They had known each other since forever, after all. She seemed to have a strange effect on his usual suave ways. "I don't know what he's like." Teddy was reluctant as he spoke. "He's like a regular guy. He's got a son and he's a lawyer who works all the time. What do you expect him to be like?"
He knew that, at face value, Harry was right - it was only a few days. But there was more to this. He wanted Harry to acknowledge that they were on the same page. "I'm not what you expected. Right?" He crossed his arms at his chest. "I'm not who you expected to be with. It's not just a few days. It's everything else you might want. I'll... say no. No to Christmas, no to holidays, no to your parties, no to that annual Quidditch League pass, no to even being seen with you in bloody public." He bit his tongue before he blurted out more of his worries. He just knew how poisonous resentment can be. He had experienced it with his wife. The dread that welled up in him when he thought about going through that again, it was-
Hermione's fingers twisted into each other as her brows furrowed. "That's not all this is. If Teddy figured it out, it's not a huge leap for others to read between the lines." She kept her words level. "Now, putting aside that fact, the implications of this article are more widespread. You've been here before. You know what people will say. I know you don't mind losing friends, Harry, but you could be losing your future too. People will say you're fraternizing with Death Eaters. They'll say you're setting a bad example for your students. You could lose your job at school. I can't imagine what parents are going to think."
Draco nearly snorted in derision. Standard. What was so standard about being called in for questioning by Aurors and then being made to wait two hours before being asked the first question?
"You always fail to see the big picture, Draco. Good thing you have me around," Astoria said none too modestly. "Having Harry Potter on our side is
"Ah." She pressed a finger to her lips. "That's something I love about you. Never stop stirring up trouble." She hummed a short tune as a cloud of butterflies hovered around her wild, blonde hair. "Malfoys, hmm?"
"You could entertain me?"
"Yes, he did."
"That's not true," Harry tsked. "He picks up on talk like that, you know? He takes things to heart when he hears you two say that. He has you. He has friends now at this school, friends he will be with for the next five years. And he's got Teddy. In fact, I think Teddy's got some of the little Weasleys warming up to Scorpius as well. So there's nothing to worry about."
"I don't care if you believe me."
Harry, desperate to fill the silence, kept speaking. "I wanted to apologize for last week. It was inappropriate. It was unprofessional. I let my personal feelings get to me. Scorpius is a wonderful student, always respectful and very studious. He's shy, but there's nothing wrong with that. I didn't mean to- That is, I'm sorry I-"
draw it."
"Why are you calling me?"
? Surely you've made a plan now, haven't you?"
"He likes fighting with you, you know?" Scorpius plopped down on his bum and began undoing his shoes. He wasn't supposed to wear them in the house. He met Draco's surprised expression with a cheeky grin. "I think you do too."
"No," Scorpius sniffed.
"He's just as angry at you as he is with me."
"I won't be good company, Scorpius."
"Does Astoria bother you?"
"Uh oh."
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry watched Scorpius scuff his shoe on the floor for a few moments before turning around and walking back to his solitary corner. He pretended not to notice when the boy glanced at him.
Scorpius hugged her tight. "I'm glad you came," he whispered. "We'll have fun."
"WHAT? GINNY!"
"Scorpius," Harry repeated slowly.
Harry's smile widened. "Thank you."
"Yes. Also I'll look after Dad." He patted Harry's arm twice. "I'm happy you came over, Harry. You're really nice to me and Dad and you don't even have to be."
"I don't know." Scorpius shrugged.
On cue, Teddy and Scorpius marched into the kitchen, prompting Harry and Draco to step away from each other. Draco did see for a moment the disappointment that Harry hid behind an easy smile as he turned to the boys. Teddy said, "We're out of sprinkles."
"I'm sure you will."
"She will be there," Draco snapped. Then he stormed off without bothering to hear a stuttering response.
Teddy grabbed Harry in a big bear hug. "I've had a great summer. I don't want it to end." He squeezed the air out of his godfather. "I love you so much."
the time. He's busy too, you know?" He laid his head against her shoulder, atop her flowing golden curls.
"I'm sorry. I can't stay. Can we-"
"What are you worth, exactly?"
The relief she felt when she saw his face that night was enormous, a feeling she never shared with anyone. She clutched his hand tight and let him brush her sweaty strands of hair away from her face. She was so glad for him at that moment.
"I don't want a pet."
Draco let out an exasperated exhale. "What?" It was rhetorical 'what'. He knew what Harry was alluding to. Draco dropped down onto the bench beside Harry. "Why do I have to say anything to him?"
"Oh?"
Harry was having strange dreams in the meantime. His shoulder and chest burned hot and cold. He could tell he was in the Malfoy Manor from the smells of faint perfume and burnt cedar. He couldn't seem to keep awake. He couldn't move. His arms and legs seemed detached from the rest of him. The potions that had made him weightless were now bearing down heavily on him. He felt as though he was falling and floating in the same moment. He would hear familiar voices, but they were too far away for him to discern the words. He was aware enough to know when a blanket was draped over him and he felt a soft touch at his cheek.
Harry shrugged sheepishly. "I was going to drop by after, to talk to you, but you got ahead of me, and kept going on and on. I figured I should let you finish."
Harry considered the veiled threat. "You know, it's practically
"No, I was being cruel. I wasn't-"
Harry smiled back at her. "Oh, we'll still see each other around, small school and all. And I doubt Teddy will be letting go of him any time soon."
"I think Uncle Harry's cool."
"Perfect!" Theo grabbed the bottle and waltzed out of there with Scorpius in tow. "This will pair well with the cheesecake."
Harry nodded. Maybe this was something he had to chisel away at. "You know, you're practically
"Yes?" he answered from the hall.
. Like Scorpius needs special treatment because his mother doesn't live with him. I'm so sick of his elitist bullsh-" He caught himself just in time. But Scorpius knew exactly what Draco had meant to say and he gasped very theatrically.
"You think he'll be a Slytherin?"
"But why am
Teddy had refused to see him for the past three weeks. That was certainly the longest the two had gone without talking to each other over summer break. They had been glued at the hip for so long.
here," Hermione wanted to clarify, "Harry isn't dying."
Draco gave Harry a discreet nod before saying, "That's because you made twenty pancakes." He started filling up the box with ginger snap cookies that Patricia had made a couple of days ago. "Ten would have been plenty."
Teddy was just about to lob a breakfast roll across the table when an owl swooped down and landed gracefully beside his plate. It tilted its head to the side and held out its leg. He undid the small letter after throwing his projectile, ducking just in time to miss one that came his way. He could guess at the handwriting even though he didn't read the contents of the letter. "Hey!" he exclaimed, grabbing the attention of the surrounding Hufflepuffs. "I've got a letter from my cousin!"
"Why?"
"Yes. He's doing some schoolwork." Patricia flicked her wand at the dishes in the sink so they were soaked and soapy, ready for rinsing in a few minutes. "I haven't made dinner in a while for you two. Harry's been around so often. He likes to cook, hmm?"
"Good," Harry smiled. "Maybe we'll raid Teddy's bedroom for some books."
"I love you guys," Theo said with a great big grin lighting up his face.
"Haven't you ever wondered about Teddy?"
Scorpius looked down at the pillow in his arms instead of answering.
"Is it only for grownups?" Scorpius asked as they walked up to the front door.
He blinked at her.
"Is Malfoy's kid coming to Hogwarts?"
he said it."
"Hmm, yes."
"I won't starve you either," Harry added.
"No."
"Why did you say you hate Harry?"
-just as the lamp lights flickered back on.
Draco sat up, bringing Scorpius along with him and nestling the boy on his lap. "Tell me. What's wrong?"
As soon as Draco heard the door to Scorpius' bathroom thud, he was pulling Harry out of the master bedroom. "Patty's going to be here any minute. You need to leave. Now," he hissed, not caring for the fact that Harry was stumbling over his feet behind him. "Quietly."
"Then you don't know her name."
"Hmm. I believe it," Harry chuckled.
When the backdoor slammed shut, Harry set his empty mug on the table with finality and asked Draco, "Okay, what did I do?"
"Hey, buddy. How are you holding up?"
"What's my type?"
The boy remained silent.
"Hey, buddy," Harry said as Scorpius settled onto the pillow. "Your father asked if you could stay over at my place for few hours after school. Something came up, so he is running late."
children's books rather than their own. Then there was the handful that thought that wandering towards the toy box was acceptable.
"I lost one of my teeth when I was eating a toffee. I didn't even notice."
Scorpius fell backwards laughing uncontrollably at Harry, who was thumping his head on the table over and over again in utter dismay. Draco hid his smile behind his cards. Teddy was flexing his biceps, saying, "Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Take that, Harry."
"I can't write well yet, Mum," Scorpius reasoned patiently. "And Dad can't write them for me
Draco bristled. "For entirely different reasons." He couldn't believe Potter was spinning this around on him. "Enough with these games already. It's childish and clearly accomplishing nothing." He just wanted some honest answers. "Do you fancy me?"
"Just shut up and take it.”
"You were going to say something."
"You're from the past."
Harry pressed a hand to his heart. "Oh, you didn't," he gushed. He had been made to sit in the living room as soon as he had arrived to pick Teddy up from the manor. He had kept his eyes shut firmly as per instruction, and when he opened them, he was met with a cake on the coffee table and the two boys showing off their creation on either side of it. He pulled them into a big hug and said, "Thank you. You really didn't have to."
"You've been distracted. Everything okay at work?"
When Draco let Harry, Scorpius, and Teddy back into the Malfoy Manor at that evening, he could tell that they had had one heck of a day. All of them had turned pink from the sun and Scorpius had a dazed grin on his face that most likely wouldn't fade for another day or two. "You had a good time, I take it," Draco said begrudgingly. Some very small part of him had been hoping otherwise.
"What's the matter?"
Harry bumped his forehead against Draco's, as if trying to knock some sense into him. "One foot out the door, huh?"
"Your fantasy, not mine," he reminded her.
"But you are a functioning member of society now," Harry argued. "You have a steady job, you pay your taxes, it's been almost fifteen years, you were a kid, and you were never charged with anything. I mean, if that happened to me, I would be furious."
"Yes," Harry lied. Not a day had gone by yet when he wasn't hounded by people he hardly knew wanting to get a look inside his life that had been so uneventful over the past many years. He was suddenly the most sought out celebrity again, especially now that he had gained a certain level of notoriety. He was practically part of the Dark Army, in the eyes of many. Trying to avoid the reporters and crowds was exhausting.
Draco shoved Harry away angrily and spun around because he knew he would end up throwing a punch or two if they faced each other for much longer. He pressed his fists against his temples while his heart raced. This was his worst nightmare. This was the worst case scenario.
Draco knew what Astoria meant. And he thought about what Harry had said about trying. Still trying. Always trying. He couldn't imagine that. If he and Astoria had kept trying to get along, to have the perfect marriage for the sake of Scorpius, it could have ended in one of them snapping for good. What was the point of that? What was the point of them being miserable for the sake of a relationship? "Should we have kept at it?" he wondered aloud.
"It's not a secret. I know it's not a secret." Scorpius narrowed his eyes at his teacher knowingly and elicited a soft chuckle. He sure was shrewd like a Malfoy.
"It's not your fault."
"Yeah!" was the consensus.
"Possessive."
"Do you want to forget about it?"
"Oh no, Nanna!" Scorpius bemoaned.
"Mess about my head, get your rocks off, all in a day's work for you?"
"Yes," Draco snarled.
"Who is she?"
"Yes."
The next day, Scorpius and Teddy were huddled close to the fire, examining their pieces of parchment carefully. Teddy had bought trick parchment at George's shop. When you look at it with a plain eye, it appeared blank. But if you held it close to fire and waited for ten seconds before studying the parchment again, you would see scrolling green letters that told a secret. Teddy and Scorpius had nearly burnt the parchments twice already and they still couldn't find any writing.
one," Scorpius insisted.
Scorpius blinked at Harry.
"You don't have to wait with me."
Next person Scorpius had to be extra nice to was his father. He waited until they had finished supper, Draco had his shower, and was settling down with a book, as he always did before bed. Scorpius sat beside Draco on the couch and said, "I'm sorry I made you sad."
"Yes. She forgets to look at the clock sometimes."
minutes." Scorpius decided. He laid his head on Draco's chest, feeling his father's heart against his cheek. "Tell me when five minutes are over."
is the reality of life.
anyone. "I had always thought that you would be someone who would own one of those empires, you know? But here you are. A lawyer. Working in an office. A salaryman."
"Well… He kind of is, isn't he?" Theo said.
"Unbelievable." Draco dragged Harry to the side, away from Astoria's prying ears, and hissed, "I'm not your bloody babysitter."
Harry seemed to take that as a yes. He pushed a finger into Draco's chest. "You and Scorpius are good people."
"I should be back to normal in a day," Harry said over everybody's excited chatter. "They're keeping me here to make sure it's healing properly." And, apparently, to be collected.
"Ah, I see," Harry itched his nose to hide his amusement.
"Who is this?"
Harry slowly let out the breath he had been holding.
But Draco was hesitant. Surely it can't be that simple...? When was his life ever that simple?
"No."
doing?"
He gaped at the boy sitting up in bed. Crying like there was no tomorrow. His mouth wide open. His brows knit together. The teddy bear discarded and forgotten. Fists pressed against his eyes. Torrents of tears flowed freely down his chubby, red cheeks.
"I sure do."
The park was soon overrun with shrieking children kicking a ball around. Parents milled around the picnic table, grazing on snacks while making idle conversation. Harry had his hands full, refereeing the match, making sure the kids weren't running headfirst into trees. Teddy had invited some of the Weasleys to the park as well, which made the party that much more raucous. Over the course of two hours, they had played a rousing game of kickball, hide-and-seek, and Grandmother's Footsteps. Then came time for cake and presents.
The room grew heavy with the sound of rainfall, shaky breaths, a creaking bed, and rustling sheets. Fingers entangled and strained against each other between them. The heat was almost unbearable. Harry had his head thrown to the side, eyes screwed shut, and moved in synchrony to Draco, who had his forehead pressed to Harry's shoulder as he edged closer and closer-
The faint red Dark Mark etched into pale skin was on display, plain as day. It was usually hidden by sleeves, but Draco had pushed his sleeves up when giving Scorpius a bath. The tattoo had faded slightly over the years, but it was still unmistakable. A constant reminder. Draco felt an ugly twist inside, but he was frozen on the spot, unable to wrench his arm away as memories flooded him from years ago. The shame and pain that accompanied this scar, emotions he had worked at burying deep down, were ensnared in those memories. It was stifling.
Draco was on his third glass of the night when he heard the familiar and insistent knock on his door. He glanced at his watch as he groaned. Eight at night. What the hell did Potter want at this time of day? He supposed he should be glad that the man didn't pound on his door loud enough to wake Scorpius up. He contemplated letting it be, but two minutes of rhythmic knocking was not something he could ignore easily.
"That's not the point."
Harry tripped over an uneven step and twisted his body around to save the 'priceless' bottles of wine in his hands, landing square on his back with a grunt. "Oof."
"What?!"
When Draco rushed after him, he saw Scorpius practically fly down the stairs, right past Harry who had been cleaning up the mess in the foyer, and straight out the front door. Draco knew Harry had heard. The entire house had shook with Scorpius' words. Draco stumbled to a halt beside Harry. "He didn't mean that."
"Since when are we keeping secrets from each other?" Ginny clicked her tongue irritably. "Fine. Our secret." She then looked up at him with an expression of worry. "You're okay, aren't you?"
"For Merlin's sake."
"You."
," he huffed.
"Where is Harry's girlfriend?" she read. "Can we look for her? Then he will be more happy. He is happy but he will be more happy."
"You can come along too, Draco."
Scorpius tried to make himself a bit more presentable by brushing at his ruddy cheeks and nose.
On Halloween, Harry figured he would be doing Draco a favour by offering to take Scorpius trick-or-treating with the Weasley children. He was often put in charge of herding them like cats from one neighbourhood to the next until sunset on Halloween night. One more child in the mix wasn't going to change much.
Draco gently guided him backwards into the bedroom. "Sleep it off."
Scorpius frowned at him. "Huh?" He seemed surprised. "No. I don't think so?"
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin when a loud shriek erupted beside him, followed by heavy sobbing.
When she arrived, the chaos multiplied tenfold.
That evening, when Draco came home from work, Scorpius was waiting for him by the stairs with a small note in his hand. Draco looked down at the red star sticker on the otherwise empty paper. "What's this?"
"DAAAD!"
"Why not?"
Harry sighed. "Why are you like this?"
"-no, I never implied-"
"Worst?"
"I didn't mean it that way, Scorpius. It's just that you have never invited me to the park before, that's all. If you want, I could spare an hour right now. Shall we go?"
"I suppose." Draco straightened Harry's jacket and stepped back. He hadn't seen Potter in a getup like this since they were children. He cleaned up well. "You should wear this more often."
"Hey!"
Harry locked his elbows behind him and leaned back to examine Scorpius. "I'm not
Right?
"About family?"
"Yes, I'm fine," Scorpius mumbled while rocking in his father's arms. "You have to be nicer," he added.
"I'm sorry, Ted."
He grabbed a fistful of Harry's sweater.
"I know," Draco reassured him. "Of course I know you love me."
"Hmm?" Scorpius mumbled.
"How will that work, exactly?"
"Let's try something here, shall we?" Harry murmured as he eased the pencil from Scorpius' tight fist. The boy quickly wiped his damp eyes and looked away. Harry smiled to himself as he rounded a few petals, erased a few errant lines and made a few clouds fluffier until the picture looked presentable. "Perfect, see?" he said encouragingly, moving the paper towards Scorpius.
On cue, Astoria breezed into the kitchen holding the plate of pancakes. "They hardly ate any of this," she complained.
"You know what the problem is."
A few of weeks in, Harry chanced upon Scorpius' art once again during drawing hour. The boy must have drawn at least twenty stars on the page and was in the process of coloring around the points with a dark blue crayon to make a sky. Harry arched an impressed brow. "Hey, buddy… Who taught you to draw that?" he asked.
"Does he really have a Dark Mark?" a Seventh Year asked, knowing that was what everyone was wondering about.
Scorpius hesitated for a beat. "Is Harry my family?"
"No."
Not a dream.
Draco's disappointment showed plainly. The boys had already run upstairs. It was evident Scorpius had promptly forgotten about his gloomy mood now that his big brother was in town. He hadn't even acknowledged Harry in his excitement. Draco pulled the door open wider, inviting Harry inside.
Draco couldn't bring himself to look at Harry. With his gaze trained at the floor, he shook his head. "I'm sorry for what I said."
"I doubt it will help," Harry mumbled.
"Mhm." Teddy pressed the bag into Scorpius' free hand as he chewed up the rest of the candy and swallowed it. "Give it to your friends at school. Then you'll be so popular. My friends are always asking me to get them stuff from the joke shop. That's why I'm so popular." He marched over to his bookshelf. "Do you like comic books?"
Harry stifled a groan, rocked backwards, and landed on the messy bed. Disastrous.
Harry smiled up at Scorpius, slightly confused. "What?"
Harry noticed Scorpius' good mood just as the boy walked into class. "My, don't you look excited," he commented.
. I HATE HIM AND HE'S NOT ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE. I'M GOING HOME!" Scorpius ran out of there, much to Draco's shock.
Harry had never been this sorry in his entire life. "Truly."
Harry arrived at the Malfoy Manor after school the next day and he was quite surprised to see a haggard Draco greet him at the door. "What's up with you?" Draco looked like he had just woken up. His hair was unkempt, he still wore his sleep clothes, and his eyes were bloodshot.
Draco was in the middle of tidying up Scorpius' playroom when the boy ran in with his shoes on, laces undone. "There you are!" Scorpius exclaimed when he finally found his father after having looked for him all over the manor. "Look at me."
The Weasleys were the exception. They had suffered horribly from the war and the Malfoys were an abomination. The wounds were still fresh in the minds of the Weasleys.
wants it to be. So what if we're separated? It's not like it's the first time a marriage hasn't worked out! He's acting like it's something to be ashamed of, that I should be
"I know that magazine article was unexpected and people have been saying some strange things. But is that the only reason?"
"No need to pretend," Harry laughed. "It's fine to be excited."
"Well, there are so many reasons. Where to begin?" Theo tapped his chin. "They were both quite rude to each other when they were at Hogwarts. Harry was a Gryffindor. Your father was a Slytherin. They fought over just about everything. They were both Seekers, so Quidditch was a big deal to them. There were a few other topics of... contention, let's say. It was a very confusing time for everyone."
"Of course Harry's cool," Teddy blustered. "He's the best wizard in all of history."
"We wanted to," Scorpius answered, his words muffled against Harry's chest.
He would pick at his lunch while at work, lost in thought, ignoring his coworkers' chatter around him. He couldn't think of 'more'. What they were doing was absurd to begin with. It was selfish and borderline irresponsible to be sneaking around like this. As far as he was concerned, there was no more. There would only be the occasional thrill of getting caught and stolen nights. Before they knew it, June would arrive.
Harry regarded him and the response for a beat. "Alright." He stepped back into the wintry night. "Then I'm not doing anything either." He shivered against the cold air. "Speaking of friends of convenience," he added, "this is rather convenient, isn't it?" With that, he disapparated from the front steps.
Harry's question, although barely mumbled, seemed to hang in the air for a little while before fading.
Harry felt this and cracked an eye open. "That bad, huh?"
In an instant, it was daytime.
When he cracked an eye open, he saw Draco fuming before him but no hint of any further violence. Still... Unusually close. "Did you finally snap?" he meekly asked.
"Is that all? Just have a party at the park. Problem solved."
"How did you do that?" Scorpius asked in wonderment.
Harry rubbed the back of his sore head. A goose egg had already begun taking shape. "I've been trying to tell you that I'm late for a holiday party at work."
life." A small voice in the back of his mind kept telling him to shut up, but the building anger and humiliation sent cutting words to his sharp tongue. "Whatever this is, was, it's what you wanted. You've chalked it up to curiosity or confusion or boredom. Now you'll listen to what I want, for once. I've spent too many
Draco took Harry's wrist in his hand and began fastening a black cufflink to his sleeve. "Don't lose these."
He glanced up when he heard a soft knock against his open door. Draco stood there, his hands clutched in front of him. And those hands held neatly pressed leaves.
Draco pushed off of the credenza with a tired sigh and walked up to the couch, resting his elbows against the back of it as he leaned forward to accept a bite of cake his son was holding up. It was cloyingly sweet and barely tasted of chocolate. Not bad for a first try.
"No one knows." Patricia shook her head. "People say she left him heartbroken. People say he doesn't believe in true love anymore. He loved her so, so much. And he was so, so sad."
"That you were with me."
"The lights weren't on, so I didn't think you were home," Harry said before taking another bite of the apple. "I'm starving. Have you had dinner yet?" He meandered forward with a hand in his pocket. Draco didn't move a muscle, not even when Harry walked right up to him. He gulped hard, loud enough for the sound to carry a bit.
Teddy glanced back at his cousin. His stomach clenched in dismay when he found the boy in tears. He hurried over to Scorpius. "What are you crying for?" he chided gently. He hugged Scorpius. "Harry does this
Percy clicked his tongue in frustration. "The issue here isn't the children. It's Draco Malfoy. Is that a reality of your life too?"
"Yes," Draco nodded.
Scorpius couldn't believe his eyes as he pulled the knife out of the jar and saw chocolate coating the metal edge. This was his dream come true! He swiped the knife over a bit of his bread. It really was chocolate. He picked the bread up and bit into it. It seemed to melt in his mouth. He sighed, which caused Harry's smile to widen into a grin. He watched the boy quickly dunk the butter knife back into the jar and take another small portion. "Maybe you could ask your father to buy you some?"
"Can you teach me to fly?"
"What's the rush? Keep the Christmas spirit up a bit longer. I love Christmas." Harry closed his tired eyes. "I had a good time today." He waited for a response. When he was met with silence, he cracked an eye open to watch Draco, who was standing in front of the tree, idly fiddling with some of the glittering ornaments, a cup of eggnog in the other hand, making a concerted effort not to answer, apparently. Harry shut his eye and yawned. "How about you? Did you have a good time?" He paused again, waiting. Silence again. He smiled thoughtfully before saying, "You can say yes, Draco. You're allowed to have fun."
"Can you show me how you draw it?"
"At night, fevers spike. That's probably why he had nightmares. It happens. He seems perfectly happy now. You did everything you are supposed to. And..." Harry took a moment to revel in the hug. He realized this was the first time he had hugged Draco. "Next time, call me sooner." It felt nice.
He grimaced when he turned around to find Draco Malfoy standing at the doorway with a glower on his face and a overall menacing atmosphere emanating around him. Scorpius stood beside his father, looking a bit sorry and resigned.
"You two better," Draco muttered under his breath. He was having immense reservations about sending his son deep into Weasley territory for an entire day. He must have be going insane. He looked down at Scorpius who appeared about as nervous as he did. "Behave," he said sternly. Scorpius nodded more than a few times to show that he understood.
He set his pencil down on the table and began folding the letter.
He rarely had an opportunity to converse like this with anyone. At work, he was all business. At home, he was with Scorpius. Potter was welcome company, strangely enough. They had been at each other's throat for long enough that they had gotten comfortable with it. After all, they had known each other since the beginning. They had been through the worst together. They had reached the lowest point in their lives in the presence of each other, in that abandoned bathroom and on top of the Astronomy tower. Harry knew nearly every heinous thing Draco had done, yet here he was, in the manor, about to have dinner at the same table.
Scorpius said, "I got a Firebolt last week and I don't know how to ride it. Teddy says you're the best."
Before Draco could utter the curse at the tip of tongue, the man spun around, his thick overcoat snapping from the force.
After hesitating a moment, Harry said, "Expected worse, actually."
A minute later, Draco walked out of the room with his son in his arms. Harry pushed off the wall, flicking carefully guarded eyes between Draco Malfoy and his son.
"You made me drop them!"
"So… how high did you end up climbing on those monkey bars?"
"Cheat!" Harry exclaimed. "There's no way!"
Harry held the bottle up to Theo. "How's this?"
Scorpius meticulously fixed the cutlery placement so he wouldn't have to look up at his father. "Do
While some of the children turned back around nervously, a few smiled up at Scorpius, beckoning him to join them. Scorpius shook his head. To emphasize his intentions, he even shuffled back a bit. Harry had been flinching through the whole fifteen-second scene, wondering if it was time for him to intervene yet.
Draco still didn't lift his eyes, but his finger twitched against the page. Scorpius was patient. He knew he had struck a nerve. He decided to keep strumming. "Maybe just for half an hour? And then I'll be so tired, I'll go to sleep right away," he promised. "Exercise is good for you, that's what I learned in school. In the winter, we don't get nearly enough exercise, did you know that? We'll bundle up a lot. We won't even feel cold-"
Draco's shoulders slumped. "What?"
"I'll miss you, Harry," Teddy pouted. He was on Platform 9 3/4 with Harry and Andromeda. They stood a little apart from the gaggle of Weasleys who were fussing over their children.
There was always that single frustrated artist.
"Don't encourage him," Harry huffed.
Harry couldn't bring himself to stumble through the same excuses yet again. He looked away guiltily, readying himself for more rants similar to the ones he had already heard from the rest of the Weasleys. He glared at the carpet and waited.
Draco knew that and wasn't going to let that stop him. "Scorpius would have more fun with you in any case. I didn't have to come along."
Scorpius seemed satisfied by that vague answer. Draco stifled a sigh. There were so many things he still had to explain to his son. Scorpius had no idea
"Why don't you go wash up? Your father will be in soon."
"What are you doing here?"
"Of course," Harry murmured before leading the way out into the deserted hallways. The children were being put down for nap-time. Harry heard quiet whispers behind him and realized that the Malfoys were talking to each other. Scorpius seemed to tuck his emotions away around people he didn't know. It was so strange to see the transformation when he was around his father. Harry grabbed Scorpius' bag and coat from the small cubbyhole near the door to the classroom. The blinds were shut and none of the lights were on. Gabrielle was walking up and down the rows of students, making sure all of them were asleep. She jerked her brows questioningly at Harry who gave her a thumbs-up in turn before walking out the door and handing Scorpius' things off to Draco.
"Leaving them where they are." Draco figured it was a sort of legacy to be passed down. Ancient knowledge that no one had read for generations. He tilted his head at Harry. "Why? Got your eye on some?"
The children turned as one to look up at Scorpius in wonder. Scorpius stood his ground with his hands at his hips and his lips pursed into a determined line. Harry was taken aback by the initiative the child had taken in asking the question despite not being included in the conversation.
"What's that?"
Draco didn't much care for the way Astoria was laughing. He sniffed in disdain. "It is only fair to Scorpius that we maintain a professional relationship."
Draco nearly swore again when he glanced at the clock in the hall. Patricia would be here in less than five minutes and Scorpius hadn't even washed up yet. "Go to the bathroom. Brush your teeth. You can choose your clothes for today. Make sure you've packed your books," he quickly rattled off while ushering his son through the corridor.
Harry said, "I don't mind. I see so many people all day long, right? It's nice to be alone for a bit."
Saturday night.
Harry smiled in defeat. These boys had impeccable timing. Teddy surely couldn't handle any more of this.
Harry leaned against the tree, arms folded at his chest, and asked Draco, "What if we
Scorpius puffed out his chest. "Harry?"
"Oh," Scorpius flipped through the comic book and swallowed hard. "I have my mother and father. And… you, maybe?"
"Good," Draco said. He nodded once at Harry and turned to leave.
"I have a friend who is writing this great big book on fantastic animals and birds." Harry was referring to Luna. "Maybe I can ask if she knows of ways to lure peacocks out into the open. What do you think?"
Astoria clarified, "Us being divorced."
Scorpius turned to Harry, who still stood at the doorstep outside. "Thanks, Harry." He grinned a gruesome grin. "I had a lot of fun." He ran into the manor and upstairs without further ado, leaving Harry and Draco in an awkward silence.
Astoria glanced at Draco for a second, then got up on her feet to sidle towards Harry. "Could I speak with you for a moment?" she asked, turning a blind eye to Draco's inquisitive frown.
"I thought you were pausing for effect." Harry looked over Draco's shoulder at Astoria to say, "Nice to see you again." Before Draco could snap, Harry evaded him by hopping down the stairs, his grin hidden.
"What?!" Harry stammered. "What's that? Where did you get that?"
Harry slammed the door shut and glared at it for a couple seconds, hoping the reporters waiting outside caught the obvious hint. What part of 'no comment' did they not get? He kicked the door for good measure before stomping upstairs.
"No," Draco answered with murderous intent. "We most definitely are not, Potter."
"Hello." Scorpius strode up to Harry and stuck the lunchbox straight at him. "I made you a sandwich."
Harry was so glad to feel Scorpius' enthusiasm. It wasn't often that the boy spoke highly of one of his own works. He was usually critical instead of pleased. "Then I guess you need to share your star with your father, Scorpius."
The teacher had been somewhat startled when he found out that Draco Malfoy's son was going to attend such a 'lowly' and unstructured school. He had thought that nothing but the best private tutors would be good enough for the young Malfoy prince. However, this boy was more of a mouse than a prince. He never spoke, always stared at his feet and mumbled his answers through barely parted lips. He looked like a Malfoy, but he acted like a Pettigrew.
to be nice to me."
"And why do you like stars so much?"
Draco waved a flippant hand. "Routine questioning," he said. "They make me wait in the interrogation room for a few hours and ask me my whereabouts.. I provide alibis. They approve them."
Draco wrinkled his nose at the melted concoction. "No."
what you're going through. I know it's scary. It's not fun at all to feel this nervous. But you're not alone. All your friends are singing with you and Gabrielle will be with me right there in front of you. Like we practiced, okay?"
"That's only slightly less dangerous than flying."
"He's fine," Draco bit out before Harry could respond, and reached down to help him up without shifting his scowl from Astoria. "You said after lunch." He kept a tight hold on Harry's arm despite Harry attempting to pull away.
Harry let out a short burst of laughter that ended in a choked moan, which reverberated into Draco's chest, sending a thrill down his spine, pushing him over the edge. Had it always felt this good? He nearly collapsed atop Harry as he rode wave after wave of release. Fire and ice swept over him. He was barely holding himself up when he blinked to clear his vision, panting down at Harry who was looking up at him with a mixture of disbelief and bemusement. It was very unnerving. "What?"
Draco didn't know. He didn't know the rules. He dropped his gaze to a splinter in the old wooden bench and began picking at it. "What does telling Scorpius accomplish?"
Draco said, "They've got a fortune and no employment. What else do you expect them to do?"
"Of course, it does!" Ron didn't understand why his friend couldn't see the situation for what it was. "The Malfoys have destroyed our lives, Harry! They don't get to just wipe that slate clean!"
"What. do. you. want. Potter?"
"Patricia said that he had outgrown them." Harry waved a flippant hand. "Think of it like arts and crafts."
"Hey, Dad?" Scorpius sidled up beside Draco, who was reading by the fire. "Do you think we can go see if the peacocks are alright? It's frightfully cold, you see. I wouldn't want them to freeze out there."
"Argh!" Draco pulled at his hair as he turned back around and kept stomping to the living room where he flopped onto the couch. Theo was now snickering as he sauntered in. He hadn't seen Draco this flustered in a long, long while. Draco was trying to hold in in his sharp words because his son was present, but Potter was just so
"That's why I don't want you to feel the way you do about him," Draco said.
"Glad that's sorted then." She shifted Scorpius in her arms and stood up. "He's sleeping with me."
"Mhm."
Draco rolled his eyes. "She must have read that in some cheap pot-boiler."
Astoria was not ready for a child. She had
"I'm listening," Draco said. "I can listen
She looked at Scorpius again. "Hello, Scorpius," she said, rolling that name around her tongue.
? That's messed up. What did you break?"
"No matter what, I just know your mum and dad will be very proud of you."
Harry snatched up a pillow and chucked it. "Get out of here!"
"We were going to forget about it."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Calm down." Harry rushed as he restrained Draco. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you."
asked him to help out with projects. In fact, he always turned to his nanny for that. "Can't Patricia take you?"
"What I mean is-"
Draco took a breath to calm himself. "You have
Harry smoothed the paper napkin that lay on the table, attempting to break the uncomfortable silence between him and Draco. "So you are a lawyer?" he asked. He wasn't sure if Draco was in any sort of gumption to make more small talk.
the brooms
"Yes." Draco set a few letters aside and picked up a few more to read.
Scorpius exhaled in defeat. "No," he grumbled. "I'm still a baby."
Draco gritted his teeth, sharp words at the tip of his tongue. The kettle clattered onto the countertop with a clang. Potter had been really grating his nerves all day and this was the final straw. "Just say what's on your mind," he snarled.
Harry studied Draco's downturned face for a moment. Then, with a tsk, he said, "Snap out of it, Malfoy," waking Draco out of his reverie. Draco flinched back as he returned to the present. Furious, he forced his wrist away from Harry's grip. He tried to compose himself by pushing his sleeves down, while Harry brushed past him.
"Just because no one will date you, doesn't mean I have to be miserable with you, Edward Lupin."
"Sweetheart," Astoria cooed, kneeling down beside Scorpius' chair before he could get up anxiously. "Oh, sweetheart." She hugged him tight. "You are the most wonderful boy."
"For the sake of the boys, can we pretend it doesn't bother you? Like we actually get along?"
Draco finally intervened, changing the subject from Harry to upcoming winter plans. However, this revelation was too incredible for Theo to gloss over. As soon as Scorpius had retired for the night, Theo pounced on Draco. "Harry Potter is your
Harry didn't know what that meant. He sank into the kiss and the caress at his chin. It was fleeting, barely two breaths. Not enough time for him to figure out what it meant. As they pulled apart, he did see Draco's pale eyes flitting over his face and linger up by his forehead. Harry brushed his hair down to hide his scar. Draco's eyes snapped back down to meet Harry's. Harry quirked his brows and asked, "Better?"
"I DON'T HAVE A TOWEL!"
"What?" Draco exclaimed.
"Are you sure you are alright, dear?" Molly fussed. Her hands were clasping her pink mittens tight and her lips were drawn into a thin line out of worry.
Harry glanced at Draco, who hadn't moved from his spot by the window. "I don't think it's a good idea-"
! "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!" they screamed. Scorpius gawked up at his mother. Astoria said, "Go on," and gave him a little nudge forward. Scorpius didn't have to be told twice. He made a mad dash towards the picnic table filled with pastries, presents, and party hats.
"Wow, you're really busy. I don't know if I like weekends better than school," Scorpius said. "School's loads of fun. We learn many things and get smart. I am really good at reading now."
"Of course." Harry winked at Arthur as he was handed a sweet tart. He was quickly accumulating many small plates of sweets around him. He picked the raisins off the tart carefully. "He's alright."
"Couldn't help it." Ginny laughed at Harry's mortification. "Anyway, he really does sound worried about you." She was genuine now. "You're alright, aren't you?"
of Potter was enough to render Draco speechless. His arm dropped to the side and he simply gawked. Harry Potter had just broken into his house.
"Dad doesn't like Harry." Scorpius then leaned in to whisper, "And Harry doesn't like Dad either. Why?"
"I haven't done anything..." Draco was close enough to Harry to smell the scent of musty books, see flecks of gold in those emerald irises, giddy with an overwhelming sense of
"Who was it?"
"Oh gosh!" Harry gasped. "They're going to come out any day now!"
Hermione sighed. It had been years since anything this dramatic had happened in their lives. "I suppose this is as good a way as any to come out, Harry." Her sensible mind had finally taken over, making her much calmer and more rational. "They really have painted a rather pretty picture here."
Draco shook his head. "Don't."
Harry helped the last boy put on his backpack before standing upright and stretching his aching back. It was Friday evening and he couldn't wait for a restful weekend.
"There isn't really much between us."
They made their way down the grand staircase, Draco trailing behind, listening to conversation without interruption. Harry was telling Scorpius about the extravagance of a Ministry of Magic gala, with its champagne tower, big band, and endless food. Scorpius wondered how often Harry got to attend a party like this. Harry said it only happened once or twice a year, which was enough for him.
Ron snorted. "Bureaucracy." He sounded like Arthur when he said that.
"I'm not going anywhere." Draco moved his wand upwards so cold air could blow onto the bed. Then he gingerly laid down against the pillows with Scorpius still holding him tight. "You don't have to go back to sleep if you don't want to."
"Interesting Draco Malfoy," Luna murmured. "Cold. Calculating. Villainous."
"That doesn't define him-"
"We have ice-cream at our house. I'll give you lots of scoops."
Harry looked back to find Draco Malfoy standing with one hand at his hip and the other pressed to his forehead. From the looks of it, he had been interrupted at work as he wore a dark suit that was still creased and polished black shoes that echoed authoritatively on the floor when he tapped his foot. "Potter. Some privacy?" Then he pursed his lips to indicate that he didn't have the time or patience for any arguments.
"Oh, we can't."
"Harry is different. People aren't allowed to be mean to him."
"Wait." Harry reached out a hand to stop the door. "You should come along next year." Draco frowned at him. "Indulge me for a change." Draco scoffed while forcing the door shut in Harry's face. Amused, Harry muttered, "Goodnight," at the door. He tossed the severed foot between his hands as he hopped down the front steps of the manor.
"Did you ask for ice-cream?"
"Exactly."
Astoria, Draco, and Scorpius walked down small cobblestone streets, blending in with other families who were out at night to marvel at the Christmas light displays. There were traditional fairy lights wrapped around trees, blinking colorful globes floating atop houses, and more nontraditional apparitions of flying reindeer clopping over rooftops. Little blue, wispy elves milled around Scorpius singing cheery music, much to his delight. There were street vendors selling hot cider and mince pies. Draco realized that it had been a very long time since he had ventured out during the winter holidays. When he was young, his parents were too posh to take him to winter markets, at least not ones such as these, 'for the general public'. He had been to many parties, wearing stuffy robes and mingling with high-profile witches and wizards instead, feeling rather important indeed. When he went to Hogwarts, he had finally had a chance to experience some of Hogsmead's Christmas magic. But even then, he was too stuck up to enjoy it. Now, seeing the little winter marvels through Scorpius' eyes, he realized that perhaps he had been missing out.
"Does Scorpius mind not having his mother around everyday?" Harry wondered.
"I don't want you to feel that way." Harry hated to think that Draco felt less than because of him. "Don't fret about it, because I don't. I want you to know that I don't think about that stuff."
"Well, I've heard rumors about Harry Potter, you see?" She gesticulated mysteriously. "He used to be
"What else would we talk about?"
"I don't want it to come out." Scorpius pouted. "It'll hurt."
"Only sometimes, right?" Harry guessed.
Malfoy immediately got up from the table.
"No," Patricia chided. "That is not how you behave."
Scorpius could hardly sit still. There seemed to be an almost endless smorgasbord in front of him. He shifted in the seat so he could sit on his knees, which gave him a much higher vantage point. He wanted to get a good look. Harry was already helping himself to the shredded lettuce and turkey slices. There was also butter and strawberry jam and orange marmalade and tomatoes and this strange jar of black things and half a loaf of bread.
"It is." Draco's eyes remained shut. "Who told you that?"
Harry stumbled away. His eyes were wide and a hand was pressed to his lips.
Teddy and Scorpius insisted on spending one last evening together as summer drew to a close. Harry and Draco kept to themselves downstairs while the boys made a ruckus upstairs. The men had polished off a couple bottles of wine between themselves. Draco shook the empty bottle and piqued a brow at Harry.
Astoria winced, but also smiled at that response. "It always comes down to Scorpius, doesn't it?" She twisted a length of ribbon between her fingers, watching it curl with ease. "He came between us."
famous?"
Truth be told, he really wanted-
"Don't bother yourself."
"Right."
But, right then, he put all that behind him because of one person.
Harry was halfway through his first bowl of cereal when the two boys came in with damp faces and freshly brushed teeth. They sat opposite Harry and set about shoveling breakfast into their mouths, paying no heed to Draco who was constantly clearing his throat and pulling faces at their lack of manners. Only after finishing a bowl did Scorpius suddenly realize something. He looked up at Harry. "Did you sleep over too?" he exclaimed in disbelief.
Scorpius pushed his nose against the window and stared up at the grey sky. "School." His breath fogged up the glass. "I get all my bad attitudes at school." He tsked once, turning around to face his father. "Maybe he didn't like the letter."
Draco was suddenly aware of the glances he was getting. No doubt news of the arrival of Harry Potter had traveled through the Ministry like wildfire. He shook off his trepidation, keeping his usual mask in place. It wasn't hard to do at all since he was immensely irritated and angry at the moment. His scowl came naturally to him. "You didn't have to wait."
