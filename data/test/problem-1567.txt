Harry had been hesitant at first, not sure how the boy was going to act or how his parents would act. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon always hated Harry because he took attention away from their Dudley. He
They sat in the cart chatting for a while, eagerly sharing stories from their childhoods and swapping jokes. They only stopped when the trolley came by.
It was an attempt at privacy that the dark haired man appreciated when he knelt down before his son and tried to give him his gentlest smile.
Harry stared at the angel for a moment, his face scrunching up in what some might consider concentration. For a moment, Crowley feared the boy might burst into tears, or that perhaps he was soiling yet another diaper. Instead, he reached forward and smacked a hand onto Aziraphale's lips and grinned. "Ba! Ba!"
“We shall take him shopping tomorrow as well,” Narcissa said decidedly, though neither of the men would dare argue. “The poor dear doesn’t look like he’s owned anything new in his life. He’ll need clothes, shoes, robes. I’d like to get him some a trunk as well for travel, maybe a few books and things for entertainment. We’ll of course have to get the boys their Hogwarts supplies but that can wait until next year. There are some wonderful books for magical children who were raised by muggles, those might be helpful for him.”
A spike of pain shot through the man’s heart at the question and he could tell Lucius knew what the boy was asking even if he didn’t technically know of the meaning behind the fingers pressing to the boy’s lips. It wasn’t hard to figure out it meant ‘food’.
The red haired boy grinned big and nodded, waving to the seat in front of him. There was chocolate on his fingers, Harry noticed, and he finished swallowing whatever he was eating as Harry put his travel trunk on the rack above the seats.
Despite only seeing a photo of him a few hours old, Severus couldn’t deny the boy was his. His hair was wild and curly, falling messily around his chin like his mothers had when she was his age, and his big green eyes blinked up at them behind a pair of spectacles. But he had Severus’ dark hair and sharp cheekbones and his nose was long like his but it turned up in a little button just like his mother’s. As Dumbledore had told them years ago, the boy had a scar starting under his fringe and stretching across his face like branching lightning, just slightly darker than the rest of his skin. It was mostly on the left side, but parts of it reached across his nose and stretched just slightly down the side of his neck.
"Says the angel who is a literal soldier of god," the demon laughed, rolling his eyes behind his glasses. "And come on, angel, Harry knows he isn't supposed to hit anyone unless he has to. He's a good kid. I'm sure he's already made all kinds of friends. And if he hasn't, we'd probably know about it by now."
Upon verification of identity Griphook had given him a file with his name scrawled beautifully on it in Lily’s exceptional handwriting. It contained Harry’s (Hadrians?) true birth certificate, the adoption papers signed by James Potter and witness Sirius Black, and a single photograph.
And it's the mousse cake all over again as Harry gets lost in the overwhelming heat, in the way Draco twists under Harry as Harry gets his hand around Draco's throat, presses down just enough for Draco to feel it. It's so much easier to just focus on what they're doing, on that low whine in Draco's throat, how he gasps beneath Harry's hand and comes with Harry's name on his lips.
But he must have been done waiting too because his hands tightened in Draco's hair as he finally brought their mouths together.
"I know how to keep the mothers away from you," Draco said. "And I know how to get myself a Spanish prince."
And, in the end, when it came down to a choice between happiness and duty, Harry found that happiness was as easy as finally saying, "Yes."
Harry says nothing, does nothing, pretends that he heard nothing. Ron, the bastard, looks like he's about to burst into laughter. To his credit, he keeps a straight face at Draco's offended look.
"Careful, Potter," Draco said, leaning closer to Harry so that he could keep his voice down. "Don't let Mother hear you talking like that."
He can't help the smile that breaks out across his face as he stands to rearrange the blanket over Draco. He tucks the ends over him and leans down to press a quick kiss to Draco's forehead. He'll wake him later, when Draco's rested a bit and they can head to bed for the night.
"I looked up ways to tell someone you love them," Harry says, knowing what it sounds like and knowing that explaining won't make it better. "And before that, I wrote him a poem."
"Potter," Draco said, delighted beyond belief. "You're not suggesting I was referring to sex. I don't need to remind you how wildly inappropriate that would be. Here. With just the two of us. Unchaperoned."
Those thoughts settled in his chest as they continued their walk, as Draco talked about Blaise having tea with him and his mother. He imagined that Draco wore no gloves, that their skin might touch, and suddenly, he wanted it so much, he thought he might burn from the inside out with the need. Just a single touch, one of Draco's fingers pressing into his skin, the way they'd touched that first day Harry had paid him a visit. He wanted to press his fingers into the inside of Draco's wrist, to feel the thin skin there.
It had seemed somehow important that Harry let Draco know just how much his presence meant to him. To show him or have some way to make it mean more than the casual, "come by mine," and "stay the night." He'd wanted to tell Draco about the ache in Harry's chest that had made it just a little harder to breathe. How Draco's eyes in the sunlight had seemed to look into Harry, how the easy way Draco had taken Harry's cup and kissed him on his way to the sink had sent a shiver down Harry's spine.
"I know," Draco said. "You've read Lady Red's pamphlet, I assume. Everyone in Wizarding Britain gets it."
"Well, you've clearly been introduced to the dregs of society," Draco said. "And you haven't even noticed, especially if they had you thinking for even a moment that your only purpose was to be their saviour."
He glanced at the door next to him and realised his mistake as the first mother made it to him. He'd picked the spot next to the exit so that he could escape should the need arise. But in doing so, he'd let Ron take the space next to him, effectively blocking off his right. The group of people in front of him had fanned out as though expecting him to run, and though he might make it past the threshold and into the Parkinson Manor waiting room, he knew he'd never make it out without someone stopping him. Besides, the night wasn't over and Harry had promised Ron he'd stay, so he took a breath and turned a smile on the woman in front of him.
Harry raises an eyebrow and Draco shrugs. He puts his hands behind his head and then, just as Harry's turning back to the film, Draco nudges him again.
Dinner at The Pheasant is Ron's idea because he asked Hermione to marry him at the same place and he thinks it's romantic.
Harry looked at him, at his mouth. The seconds ticked by, the air heavy with unspoken words. If either of them moved, it would be over. There was no way either of them was coming out of this unscathed. But what did that matter?
"Good evening, Mr Malfoy," Elise Abbott said. "You seem to have a lot of time on your hands tonight. Would you do us the honour of dancing with Alice?"
Harry hadn't made Draco wait. He'd come the morning of the Bulstrode Dance and simply let Draco know that they were to put an end to their fake courtship. He'd been polite, if a bit distanced, his eyes never straying from a spot over Draco's shoulder. And so, things ended, and Draco had been left to sit in silence for the rest of the morning and well into the afternoon.
Harry's mouth dropped open as he watched Draco pull further away. He didn't know what exactly did it, whether it was the obvious out Draco was giving him, or that infuriating beat of his heart whenever Draco got too close. He only knew that as he stood in the hallway just inside Grimmauld Place, he felt a desperate need to hug Draco, to hold him, to bury his face in Draco's neck and have Draco stroke his hair. He wanted it to be simple, more than he had ever wanted anything else in his entire life.
Harry eyed the people behind Draco then refocused on him. His first glance was quick, nothing more than a confirmation that it was Draco he was talking to. The second glance was longer, lingering on Draco's jewels and his robes, his eyes straying to the exposed skin on Draco's neck before settling on his face.
It was Harry who demanded entry, but it was Draco who pulled Harry's thumb into his mouth and sucked. He was the one who made eye contact and kept it, his mouth hanging open at the look on Harry's face. He looked ruined, as though he was in pain and there was nothing he could do to stop it. They looked at each other for a moment, their bodies pressed together as Harry pushed down on Draco's tongue. And then Harry moved his hand to Draco's hair. Draco could feel the heat from Harry's mouth as Harry brought their foreheads together, his fingers tangling in Draco's hair and pulling.
"Just as it makes sense that I marry a pureblood. Someone rich and well-connected," Draco said, his voice going soft even as his gaze drifted down to Harry's shoulders, his arms.
There's also an iPod Nano that Harry borrowed from Dean and some headphones he'd picked up on his way from work. The little white rectangle holds all of Dean's favourite songs and though Dean hadn't said anything, Harry's been extra careful with it. He knows Draco will like it because ever since he'd had to give Hermione her iPod Shuffle back, he'd been contemplating getting something for himself.
What she was really looking for was a Weasley and if the woman had any sense, she'd be across the room trying to get into Mrs Weasley's good graces. But Draco supposed that not everyone could have common sense and that to Elise Abbott, nabbing Harry Potter would more than make up for Hannah Abbott's engagement announcement. And though the woman was insufferable as all hell, and rather too ambitious for her own good, she wasn't wrong. Potter was the most eligible bachelor in the room, by far the richest and most well-connected, despite his long absence.
"Oh no, Draco," Pansy said. "You misunderstood. I'm not talking about the Weasleys. I'm talking about someone else, a certain well-off war hero, Wizarding Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor, and the object of many rather lascivious fantasies among this lot."
He tried to push down the disappointment as he caught sight of Gregory again, attempting to manoeuvre his way through a group of particularly determined mothers. The scene reminded him so much of the night Elise Abbott had cornered Harry that Draco couldn't help smiling.
Draco tightened his hand around himself and imagined Harry above him, those arms caging him in, that body pressing him into the mattress. He remembered the heat of Harry's hands the only time they'd touched, how the feel of his fingers had sent a jolt of electricity up Draco's arm and to his spine.
But the night wore on and as more people arrived, it became obvious that Harry wasn't coming. Draco had already said no to two dances by the time Elise Abbott made her way to his side of the ballroom. She was dressed in simple, yellow dress robes that clashed with her bright blonde hair and made her look washed out. Alice, who stood by her side, looking as though she'd rather be anywhere else, was stunning in bright green dress robes decorated with tiny diamonds. She gave Draco an apologetic look and rolled her eyes behind her mother's back.
After the War, it had mattered more that he never lost sight of Ron and Hermione than it had mattered that he was safe and comfortable. He'd put up with the trials, with the interviews, with the awestruck gazes and the constant demand for his time. He'd only been able to sleep when he knew Ron and Hermione were in the room with him, when he'd been able to reach out and touch them.
Harry shook his head, turning to Ron to point out the group. As he did, he caught a glimpse of something shining in the distance, a reflection of light against a polished surface. He followed the glare to its source, a young man with white-blond hair who had his back to Harry. For a moment, the hair didn't register because the man was dressed from head to toe in gold and black. Around his neck, he wore a single gold chain and from that chain hung thinner gold chains that looped down along his black dress robe sleeves, each loop marked by a single white pearl. Gold fabric hung from his shoulders down to his waist, the material cinched at the top and bottom, the creases disappearing behind a gold belt. Elsewhere, gold and black mixed, the materials seeming to attract all the light from the room.
He looked up hopefully, seeking out his potential saviour and came face to face with a sparkling Draco Malfoy.
"As well they should," Draco continued. "You're more than the Boy Who Lived and I am more than an ex-Death Eater. And whatever decision you make, regardless of whether or not the Wizarding World agrees with it, will be your own because you're you, Harry. You're a person with wants and desires and needs, and no one can take that away from you. Not even me."
"No, I don't think so," Draco says, grinning as he leans back on the arm of the sofa. "I'd like to watch."
"Fucking is almost as good as getting fucked," Harry said, his voice getting thicker as he remembered the feel of a body above him, pressing him down into the sheets, a body below him as he moved his hips. "You don't understand what you're missing, how good it is when it's someone else touching you. How soft the inside of a mouth is. So yes, I've fucked my way through the countryside, and yes, I'm good at it. And no one is going to make me feel like I should be ashamed of it."
He thinks of nights alone in this flat as he watches Mark knocking on Juliet's door. He'd been alone for a long time so he knows how to recognize the feeling of belonging. He knows that the certainty that Draco will be there in the morning is good and special and important.
There was a flash of uncertainty across Draco's face before he schooled his expression into a mask of indifference. "Your reputation outside of Wizarding society hardly has anything to do with your reputation within it," he said. "Besides, no one here is fool enough to say no to The Boy Who Lived simply because he tumbled with a Muggle or two."
He can see Draco biting back a smile as the bulbs around them close in, setting their table in an intimate yellowish glow. It's easy to forget the people around them as they look at each other, warmth settling in Harry's chest. He could sit for hours pretending he doesn't understand the intricacies of French pastries while Draco pretends he cares.
It was an astounding display of talent, how she was able to convey a clear disinterest in Ron without saying a word. She effectively shut him out with nothing more than a side step and a turn of her head. Harry caught Ron's eye over Mrs Abbott's shoulder and knew that Ron was leaving him.
Harry toys with the cuff of his sleeve. "He's...that is to say...I don't...I've never told anyone I was in love with them before," he falters, looks down at his teacup.
"McLaggen," he said, nodding his greeting before turning to the door. "Harry Potter here to see Draco Malfoy."
It was so easy to picture Harry kissing him, to picture himself with his hands in Harry's hair, dragging him closer. What he wouldn't do to get Harry somewhere private, away from prying eyes, away from goddamn proper society. He'd push him up against one of the walls in Malfoy Manor, up against the books in the library, or down on Draco's bed, against the sheets. He'd look good amongst all that green and silver, better still once Draco could get him out of his clothes, once Draco could touch him.
Bulstrode Manor was built into one of the sprawling hills surrounding the area. Behind it, the ocean spray had smoothed away the rough edges of the rocks below, leaving only clean sand and a steep fall downwards. The front of the Manor had steps that led into the second floor of the home and large grandiose arches that broke the front gardens into sections. The first section Draco passed contained a maze on either side. The huge green hedges that made up the mazes were about a metre taller than him and could only be looked over from the balconies on the second floor of the Manor.
It's, quite predictably, all Ron's fault. Hermione had shown Ron the movie so he'd shown it to Harry. Then Draco had come over in the middle of the movie and the three of them had watched, until Draco had asked that they restart it. And Ron, being the best friend Harry's ever had, had restarted the movie and had settled back down on Harry's sofa to watch.
Draco looks up slowly, something mischievous in his eyes. He tilts the box to show Harry the broken mass of chocolate mousse, raspberries, and white sugar.
At first, Draco didn't know what to do. He felt as though he'd been punched, the air spilling from his lungs as heat burned throughout his body. He reached out a hand blindly and caught Harry's shoulder, his fingers digging in as Harry kissed him. He could feel his hands shaking as his body focused on all the places he and Harry were touching, on the flash of pain as Harry pulled on his hair, the heat of their tongues, and all the hard planes of Harry's body.
It hadn't even been his intention to start seeing anyone, but the people of the county didn't care about propriety like the Wizarding community did. The women didn't mind if Harry flirted. The men didn't care that he wasn't looking for anything serious. He flirted and they flirted back and when he tumbled into bed with them, they kissed him and knew it meant nothing. They had no expectations. No one in the country needed him to be their saviour. Nobody there wanted him married and with children.
Or perhaps Harry would win in a duel. Perhaps he'd overpower Draco, would take his wand, would have him at his mercy.
The breeze blew and brought with it the smell of freshly mowed grass, that faint sweet scent of flowers blossoming, the hint of spring in the air. He inhaled and didn't move, too focused on the way Harry's chest moved up and down as he breathed. He'd walked the same distance as Draco but he was practically panting in the space between them, his proximity making heat spread along Draco's cheeks. He decided he wasn't going to move.
He looked so sincere that Harry had to look away, out across the water. He could see a pair of ducks swimming in the distance, the green feathers on their heads shining in the sunlight. He imagined he was standing outside of his country home, watching the sun setting behind the water in the distance. It was hard to hold onto the peace he'd felt in moments like those, hard to remember that he was happier than he'd ever been before in his life because he no longer allowed others to influence the choices he made.
Harry reaches out to touch Draco's shoulder and is surprised when Draco startles. He turns, his grey eyes wide as he looks at Harry.
All that's to say that Harry's not overlooking the miracle that's their schedules matching up and making this date night possible. Harry intends to use the atmosphere of the place and the overeagerness of the waitstaff to his full advantage. See, Harry James Potter—Wizarding Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor, six years running, Darling of the Ministry, and Future Head Auror—has a plan.
Draco turned, knowing that the light from the chandeliers would catch on the emerald necklace. He saw Harry's gaze lock on his throat and felt particularly mean as he reached up to adjust it.
So as they stood on that bridge, the wind blowing over the lake, Draco's pupils blown wide with want, Harry knew it was time. He had to break their agreement before either of them did something they would later regret.
They'd been dating something like three months, fitting dates wherever they could, sometimes staying over at either Harry's or Draco's just to get time in. Despite their busy schedules and all the hundreds of things still requiring Harry's attention every day, it'd been so easy to meld his and Draco's lives together.
What could he say? What could he tell Pansy that would make her understand why he'd done what he did? That he might harbour feelings for Harry was a ridiculous excuse. That he loved Harry was even more preposterous because if he did...if he loved Harry, then he was an even bigger fool than Pansy thought him. Because Harry wasn't going to marry him, and Draco had just thrown away his one chance at a good life for nothing.
Harry could feel the stares from every person along the street as he made his way to Bolton's Flower Shoppe, two streets away from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. He'd read Lady Red's new column over Ginny's shoulder that morning, as Fred had tried to wrestle the papers away from her. The Weasleys had been mentioned towards the end, the usual load of rubbish, backhanded compliments and thinly veiled barbs at Mrs Weasley. But there had also been a rather fond congratulatory section regarding Percy's engagement to Audrey Wilson, a perfectly pleasant half-blood witch with stunning brown eyes.
Draco bared his teeth at her and did his best to turn it into a smile. "I'm sure he's just running late," he said.
Draco frowns. "You're being too nice," he says. "Oddly so. Not the usual kind nonsense we both know is annoyingly you. But a sort of strange kindness."
The truth was that ever since he'd seen Draco wearing Gregory Greengrass' necklace, he hadn't been able to stop thinking about replacing it with something Harry had bought for him. He imagined a gold chain much like the ones Draco had been wearing at the Parkinson Ball, something discreet that would nevertheless catch the light from the chandeliers and call attention to itself. He'd imagined Draco touching his neck, knowing that Harry had given him that chain, that he was wearing something Harry had chosen specifically for him. If he got carried away, he imagined Draco liking it, imagined his eyes the way they sometimes got when Harry stepped just a bit too close.
"I will," Harry says, kicking his shoes off, glad that the conversation seems to be moving onto safer territory. "If only to avoid whatever this was."
But that second to last Sunday in September, Draco's off with Blaise and Pansy and Harry's at home, trying to figure out what he's doing wrong. He understands that most of the failed attempts at telling Draco he loves him are due to spur of the moment things he can never hope to control. It still doesn't change the fact that Harry loves Draco, wants to tell him, and hasn't found a way to do it. So, he puts the Internet to good use and goes on a hunt for advice from various websites.
"Draco," Harry says, taking a step back. "We really should at least make sure the cakes made it home all right."
He expected Harry to already be at the ball when he arrived. They'd agreed that they wouldn't arrive together at events, but that Harry would be there first, waiting ever so patiently for Draco to show up.
He went down to breakfast feeling rather pleased with himself and was just digging into his eggs when Pansy Apparated into the library. It had to be Pansy because she was the only person besides Draco and their mother who was allowed through the wards without question. Narcissa, who was reading the daily Lady Red column, didn't even glance up as Draco stood from his chair. He offered his excuses and went out to meet Pansy.
Malfoy Manor had one of the largest sitting rooms Draco had ever been in simply because his mother liked large windows and natural sunlight. It was the one room in the house that wasn't decorated in the family colours of green and silver. It had lighter wooden walls and everything within it, from the couches to the curtains, was in a myriad of blues and whites. That morning, the curtains were thrown wide open so that everywhere Draco turned, he could see the sprawling green of the Manor gardens and the far-off trees that lined the edge of the property. To his left was the marble fountain in the centre of the garden, blooms of various sizes and colours surrounding the area.
Draco snorted, "If you want me to adorn myself with your jewellery, then next time show up on time."
Draco smiled slowly and predatorily. "Oh, Potter, that's only because you have no idea the things I am capable of."
With a small smile, she put her hand on his back and urged him forward alone. He had no choice but to step through to the balcony that overlooked the ballroom. There were steps on both sides leading downwards, and as Draco took the right set of steps, he noticed that the group of people closest to the bottom were looking up at him. He didn't understand the interest until he noticed Gregory and Cormac McLaggen deep in conversation, Cormac's hand laying proprietary along Gregory's arm. Behind them, a little to the left, stood Harry, resplendent in deep red and black, his hair tousled just so. He was glaring at both Gregory and Cormac, and when his gaze met Draco's, he raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
"Because I asked a waitress to write it on a cake and then I ruined that. One time he actually fell asleep. And then there was the time that—"
They haven't had a moment to themselves since the meeting with Kinglsey and the other Department Heads, a week since the restaurant. A week since Draco had laid Harry out in bed and licked chocolate and raspberries off him. He'd fucked Harry nice and slow and it had been worth the ruined attempt at telling Draco he loved him.
A year after the War, he was still the same little boy, gazing at the Wizarding World in wonder. He still needed people to tell him what to do and who to be. He'd expected sadness upon that discovery, but what he'd found was unmitigated fury. He'd felt anger burning through his chest, an uncontrollable urge to rip his room apart, to throw things against the four white walls of his London flat. He'd cursed the world and wanted to hurt everyone who'd ever demanded something from him. The feeling had been absolute, pure, untouched by the outside world. It had been the first thing that was solely his, and because he'd been afraid to have it tainted, he'd grabbed his wand, packed his things and left the city.
That he trusts Harry to see him this way, to take care of him and guide him is almost too much. It makes Harry want to hold him close, to give him whatever he wants, in whatever way Draco wants it. Makes it so that it's a little hard to think as Harry presses in slowly, really letting Draco feel all of him, that heavy slide of their bodies. He feels Draco shiver beneath him and Harry buries his face in Draco's neck. He smells like detergent and the thick heavy scent of his cologne. Good everywhere he's touching Harry, murmuring encouragements as Harry moves, broken off, "please, need to feel you."
He could kiss him right there in the posh restaurant with its floating bulbs of light and its string quartet. He almost does it, lost in the moment as he reaches across the table for Draco's hand.
Which meant that Draco had to find a rich husband. And he was finding that task more difficult since Lady Red had so casually reminded everyone that his family had been in bed with Death Eaters not so long ago. Even though the same thing could be said of half the people in the ballroom in front of him. But, Draco supposed, everyone needed a scapegoat.
Harry's eyes flickered for a moment to the crowd at Draco's back, the light from the chandelier sparkling in his green eyes. "I would say that while I don't doubt your obvious experience with these crowds, I very much doubt that what you have in mind will be anywhere near pleasant for me."
He sighed turning back to the rest of the room. He spotted Gregory Greengrass coming his way and as the whispers around him grew louder, he made up his mind. In one quick motion, he pulled out the necklace Gregory had given him and clasped it around his neck.
People who didn't even know him felt entitled to his time and his life, and he'd been so young, so alone, so lost in the madness, that for a moment, he'd believed it was his destiny to give the Wizarding World what it wanted. And when he finally woke up on that morning, long ago, he'd vowed that the world would never have anything else from him. He was done. He'd given them enough.
Eventually, the anger fell away from Pansy's face and all that was left in its wake was a long look of pity. "Oh, Draco," she said.
The man was looking for a husband or a wife. He had money, he had looks, and he was a war hero. Not so talked about in the Prophet, but rich enough to matter, and if Draco had thought he stood even a minuscule chance at getting Finch-Fletchley's attention, he would have been over there in a heartbeat. But alas, there are some things that can't be bought and chemistry was one of them. No matter how much effort Draco might have put in, Finch-Fletchley was a hard no, and so that made him Draco's biggest rival for the attention of other well-off wizards.
Draco laughed, overly aware that they were putting on a show for the other people in attendance. He found that he didn't particularly care what anyone else thought. Whether they believed he was having a lover's quarrel with Harry or if they overheard their conversation. The fact remained that he'd lost face tonight and his mother had paid some of the price for that. Draco wasn't feeling charitable towards Harry and he could see Gregory looking their way from across the room.
Harry wants him and it feels foolish to admit it to himself when he has Draco in his arms, in the quiet of the flat. But Harry wants him, wants to feel him everywhere. He pushes deeper, harder, wanting to bury what he feels in the sounds they make. It's horrible and wonderful at the same time and as they move together, Harry thinks Draco's never looked better. Never felt as good as he does, then, in Harry's arms.
He thought of his mother that day, of how she'd looked so incredibly young when he'd called her forth with the Resurrection Stone. She'd been younger than he was at the time, with so much future ahead of her, with so many people to live for. And yet, she'd been denied the opportunity to grow old because the world needed her to fight. She'd been asked to do more than a person should have to, because it was the right thing to do. Because if she didn't do it, who would? Because a good cause was worth the risk.
When he was fifteen years old, he buried his godfather and experienced for the first time the pain that came with losing someone he loved. He knew of his parents, knew that they were heroes. But the pain of their passing was an echo of the sorrow that everyone else felt. He'd never known them so he'd never known exactly how to mourn them. Every memory he might have had was gone before he'd even had a chance to save it. Which was why, when he finally learned that he had people to lose, he held on as tight as he could.
Sometimes it was difficult to remember that what he and Draco were doing wasn't real. Harry had become accustomed to meeting Draco at an event and reserving two dances, one at the beginning of the night and one at the end. They'd spend the rest of the time lost in conversation about the decorations, or about the Weasleys, joking about Ginny's engagement to Luna Lovegood. Sometimes Draco would dance with other people. Sometimes he'd say no and stay with Harry the whole night, both of them pushing the limits of what was appropriate.
Ron laughed. "Well, yeah, what did you expect? You're the Boy Who Lived, Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor. You're a catch, mate."
Draco shook his head slightly and she relaxed, turning a smile on Harry. "In that case, I'll walk you to the door."
Draco gives him an odd look but does as he's told. Harry watches him, the careful, delicate way Draco has of untying knots, how he folds the ribbon and sets it on the table. He eases the flaps away from the box and Harry watches his face, waits for the moment Draco reads the message. But Draco looks down and instead of the surprise Harry expects, he looks pensive.
Harry looked up startled, his heart beating hard in his chest. "Hermione and Ron said almost the same thing when I told them," he said.
Harry looked for the Weasleys, finding a single clustering of red hair perilously close to Mrs Weasley. He couldn't tell if the Weasleys hadn't spotted their mother or if they had simply given up trying to escape her. As he watched, Mrs Weasley made it to the group, planting herself in front of Percy and to the right of Fred. Ginny startled, immediately trying to blend into the dancing people behind her. But Mrs Weasley was too fast, looping her arm through Ginny's, making the motion seem good-natured instead of intimidating. It was over and the rest of the Weasleys knew it.
Harry supposed there were some things one didn't say no to, and Draco Malfoy smiling at him under the moonlight happened to be one of them so, with a shake of their hands, they agreed.
He shoved the voice out of existence, focusing instead on getting up the last of the steps and into the Manor, keeping close to his mother. She was wearing black dress robes that flared below the waist, the material expanding into a large skirt that trailed behind her. In between the stitches of her skirt were tiny jewels spelt to shine like obsidian. Draco matched her in dress robes that might have reminded him of Harry's usual style, if he weren't wearing Gregory's necklace. It hung around his neck like a weight, the emeralds shining under the hundreds of small lights that floated along the ceiling.
He didn't look back as he walked away from the fountain and the sounds of the ball coming from the Manor at his back. He wasn't sure where he was going, only that to remain would mean falling apart. He couldn't stand to hear Elise Abbott congratulating him and he didn't want to see Cormac's face. The man had no decency, always chasing the suitors others rejected. He'd been scrambling from one man to the next, inserting himself where he wasn't wanted. It was more embarrassing than if Cormac had outright stated he would take whatever he could get.
Harry's gone through three pages of results, has almost convinced himself that Draco doesn't love him and that Harry's simply reading too much into his own feelings, when he finally finds something useful.
he said, repeating the gesture, “so you don’t have to spell his name every time. It’s an H,” he said, showing off his pointer and middle finger,
“Thank you, my friends,” Severus whispered, a bit of life finally returning to his eyes as he looked at them both. “I can never repay you for all you’ve done for me.”
"This cage is too small," he answered the question, all but glaring at the sign. "He's a big snake with nowhere to go. You know how big I get when I'm like him, right? Do you think I'd be happy if I was trapped in there?"
A series of letters passed back and forth between Minerva McGonagal, Crowley, and Aziraphale, spanning over Harry's childhood.
After a long moment, Crowley groaned, looking up at the ceiling. "Fine! Fine. But!" He held up a hand before Harry could celebrate. "You have to ask your Ba. If he says no, then that's your answer. And you'll have to take care of him, we won't be doing it for you. I'll talk to the school when you get your letter. Maybe they've lifted their rules on snakes since I was last there."
"Yes, but you've decided to ride with the students, so I just want to make sure you've got everything you need, just in case. You've got Sirius' carrying case if they make you put him up, yes," Crowley fretted, finally taking a step back to look down at their son. Harry nodded eagerly and the demon sighed, shoulders slumping. "Very well. We'll be in the teacher's car if you need us. Don't take shit from anyone. And remember what your Ba told you. Be nice to the other kids. But remember what I told you too-"
"My friend, I cannot promise I will be any better than who he  is with," Crowley tried to argue once more.
“I cannot leave him there with her,” Severus snapped, body tensing and teeth bared like a cornered animal. “Who knows what that horrid woman has done to him.”
Harry shrugged and shook his head, adjusting his glasses. "My mom and dad left me everything they had when they died, but it wouldn't have been fair to buy everything. We wouldn't have eaten it all and the no one else would get any. But here! To replace your frog."
Harry hummed, nodding as if he understood. Which he probably did, Crowley mused, he was a smart boy.
"Ssssshut up," Crowley hissed again, his forked tongue slipping between his lips and Vernon tensed in fear.
And oh how Narcissa’s heart positively ached at the despair in the man’s voice. Severus didn’t move from her shoulder, and she didn’t dare mention how improper this was for purebloods, but he waved a hand at her husband in permission.
"Very well, Mr. Fell. Many great wizards have come out of the house Slytherin, powerful but dangerous sometimes. However, Gryffindor is a most respectable house."
"Fairness is an angel's work, mischief. And I am a demon," Crowley responded. But he smirked and waved a hand towards Aziraphale. "Go on then, before our son dies of excitement."
It wasn’t long before Severus found himself in front of an unfamiliar house in an unfamiliar neighborhood.
Aziraphale glanced up from his book as Harry skid into the room, stumbling slightly in his excitement and crashing into the couch. Crowley popped his head into the room, spritzer in hand and eyebrows raised. "Whats here?"
Grim and equally upset, Griphook nodded. “Indeed. There was little the goblins could do at the time with the Ministry backing his decisions. However we will of course assist in correcting this grievous mistake once Mister Potter nee Prince completes his own inheritance test and we are able to verify his identity. As stated, this would be best to do as soon as possible in order to get things moving along to their correct holders.”
A sad expression settled on his face and Crowley smirked, sharing a look with the angel. "Should we tell him?" Aziraphale asked.
"Oh yeah! He was asleep on the train so I couldn't show him to you," Harry grinned as they lined up outside of the Great Hall doors. "He's a service animal so I get to bring him with me, that's why he wasn't ever in his case," the boy answered, shifting his scarf just enough for Sirius to poke his head through. Ron's eyes widened and he took a shocked step back, running into a curious Hermione and Harry shook his head frantically. "Oh it's okay! Mum said some people are scared of snakes. He's fine though, I promise! He's very nice!  Mum had me get him trained as a service animal, but he was already super smart, so that helped."
“Of course, mother,” the boy responded, tilting his chin up in pride. “Blaise and Theo say I’m the best of friends.” It wasn’t completely true of course, people of their status knew better than to be so open with affections, but both boys were always eager to come visit and they never complained, so Draco assumed he
Ron reached forward slowly, holding his hand out like one might to a dog to let them sniff, obviously hesitant and scared. Sirius stared at the red haired boy before rolling his eyes and dipping his nose forward. His tongue flitted out softly and tickled the inside of his palm, causing Ron to giggle and reach a single finger forward to pat Sirius' head.
Draco was gone and back as fast as he could, almost skidding to a halt beside his mother, his gift shrunk into his pocket and his posture absolutely picture perfect just in time for his father and uncle to apparate into their sitting room, a tiny body held in Severus’ arms.
Loud cheers and claps rose throughout the room, filling the air around them and causing the older woman to grin through her tears as she accepted the applause.
"And we'll be picking up a few classes there to teach. Ill be teaching Magical History and Crowley will be teaching Herbology. We aren't wizards you see, so we are a bit limited on classes. But I think they work very well."
Crowley sighed and sat up slightly, leaning back on his elbows to look over at his partner. "Angel, you'll only embarrass him. He's fine. You'll see him again when we get there. Besides, you'll have to get used to it once he starts sleeping in the dorms. We can't always be there with him, you know. He's growing up."
Narcissa frowned, wracking her brain for some memory of Lily Potter’s family. “She’s muggle, isn’t she? Lily Evans came from a muggle family? I recall you complaining extensively of a Petunia.”
"We must get this child away from here at once," the angel decided, all but stomping up to the front door. Or he would have, if angels stomped. Which they don't. "Come dear, don't dwaddle. I'll not have poor little Harry here any longer. I simply won't allow it."
Harry and his friends were gathered with the rest of the students at the top of a set of stairs after arriving at Hogwarts and getting off the boats. He could see the white haired boy towards the edge of the crowd, ready to walk over and ask his name, but the boy was already joined by his own friends: short, a black haired girl who clung to the boy's arm, and another dark skinned boy that stood nearly a foot taller than him at his side.
"It's your own fault you know," the angel laughed as Crowley tried to reach under the table for Harry, but he was already gone. "I told you not to introduce him to Quidditch too early. If what you've told me about his father is even remotely true, he's got it in his blood."
The demon frowned, searching those eyes that once held a very dear friend and now were filled with nothing but trauma and pain.
"I do." It wasn't a question, but Sirius nodded anyway. "But if you want me to get you out of here, you'll have to break the seal and-"
“Hello, we are looking for a Mister Harry Potter,” Lucius said, though the boy’s eyes didn’t leave Severus’.
long time but he remembered it vividly. It was during the summer of their fourth year. Lily had dragged him to some concert in a field for a band he’d never remembered the name of, spread out a blanket and draped herself across it with a smile that could light a thousand suns. Severus was sat next to her, his long black hair pulled into a messy bun and Lily’s with flowers woven into her braid.
“It appears,” Lucius said slowly, almost carefully as his gaze drifted to their friend before returning to her, “that the Potter boy is not, in fact, James Potter’s son.”
"Harry," the demon said, pushing the door open and crossing his arms. The boy squeaked, pushing something quickly under his pillow before turning to look at Crowley.
"Welcome back students, thank you Headmaster for the lovely speech. Now, before we get into the sorting ceremony, we do have a few announcements. It is with great honor and respect that we must bid farewell to our Madam Sprout." There was a series of gasps and 'no!'s as the short, stout woman stood up from the table and smiled, waving to the students. "She will be remaining through the first semester to help our new Herbology  professor settle in, and I'm sure she'll be sad to leave everyone here, but we are honored by her time here and wish her all the best."
Uncle Severus snorted and rolled his eyes, but he still translated the question when Harry turned to look up at him in question.
They didn't have time to talk this out, Crowley knew that. This was a decision they were just going to have to make. But still... Crowley with a child?
His uncle seemed surprised at the question, like he hadn’t expected Draco to do such a thing- which the blonde figured was fair since it was usually the guests who brought gifts for the host. Still, he waited for his uncle to nod and look down at his son.
Crowley didn't actually look upset when he peeked over the couch at Aziraphale, more exhilarated, like it was only a game they were playing. Which was probably true.
“They do seem to be doing well together, don’t they,” Narcissa smiled, following his gaze toward the boys. “If you are fine with it, Severus, I’ll put the boy in the room next to Draco’s. It’s down the hall from yours and ours anyway, but I’m sure he’ll be much more comfortable near Draco than us. Have you explained to him what we’ll be doing tomorrow yet?”
“Draco darling,” his mother said, gesturing towards a table off to the side of the room. “Why don’t you set the book down and show Harry the other pictures, yes? Your father and I have some things to discuss with your godfather before dinner. Afterwards we can get Harry set up in his room and tomorrow we can go shopping to get him some things. Yes?”
Aziraphale did not wait to be invited before taking a very prim and proper seat on a couch that looked like it was never used except for company, and Crowley took the opportunity to sprawl across it lazily, his legs spread enough to have the woman glancing away with a blush. He only smirked wider. It didn't take long for Vernon Dursley to stomp down the stairs, his face red with exertion and his breathing heavy.
Oh and the smile that lit up the angel's lips then nearly broke Crowley. It burned his eyes to look at, so perfect and heavenly. He didn't dare look away.
Relieved to be able to communicate easier, Severus nodded and knelt down in front of the boy, ignoring the way his old knees ached at the movement. “
"Yes!" Harry whooped, jumping into the air excitedly. "Oh my gosh this is going to be so cool! Wizard school! I'm gonna get a wand, and a cauldron. And I'm gonna mix potions and fly and-" he paused, eyes widening with barely contained excitement. "Can I play quidditch!?"
Even with the proof of Lily’s letter, and the one from the boy, it didn’t truly settle in that Severus was a father until he was sitting before Griphook the goblin with an inheritance test in his hands. Lucius had been with him the entire way, explaining the situation to Griphook who was aware only of what Lily Potter had told him previously, and being a pillar of support for Severus when the words stuck in his throat.
So when the dark haired boy turned back to him, trying desperately to keep his tears from spilling over, he nodded.
I struggled hard core on whether I wanted Harry to be in Slytherin or not, but I decided to keep him in Gryffindor for now. OOp.
"Can I give you one? Or would you like to pick one," he'd asked after both boy and snake had sprawled out across the floor to talk.
There was a series of nods and agreements, as well as students shuffling forward to leave their animals where instructed. Harry left his empty carrying case as Ron dropped off his rat Scabbers and Hermione dropped off her cat, Crookshanks.
Harry bit his lip and glanced over to where Lucius was holding a family photo. Severus couldn’t see what was on it, but his friend looked a strange mix of confused and angry. Harry simply looked torn.
About halfway through the trip, there was a knock at their door and a girl with wild curls popped her head into the room, frowning. "Hi, you guys wouldn't have seen a toad around here somewhere, would you? A boy down the hall lost his again and is throwing a right fit." The boys shook their heads and she sighed. "That's alright then. Doesn't hurt to ask. You wouldn't mind me joining you, would you? My cart is rather full and I'd rather not listen to Neville cry about Trevor anymore."
"Maybe we'll all be in the same House," Ron said eagerly. "My family all comes from Gryffindor. Well except Percy, he's in slytherin, but he's always been a right git about it. Gryffindor is a great house though, and we usually look good in red and gold," he laughed. "I'm going to win us the house cup once I can join the quidditch team!"
Ron snorted, saying something akin to 'you would, you nerd,' though it was soft and friendly. Harry thought about it for a while before shrugging. "I don't really care what house I'm in. I don't know much about all of them, but my Ba told me about them. My mum was a Slytherin professor when he taught at Hogwarts, and he likes to joke that my Ba is Hufflepuff. I don't care which I go to though." He smiled bright at Ron and Hermione. "I just want to be somewhere with friends."
Harry taught him the alphabet first since he wasn’t allowed paper at the table, and Draco took to it immediately, only forgetting a few letters the first few times. Then Harry taught him the signs for all of the foods, taking his time after he was finished eating to spell them out for him before repeating it again in sign language. On more difficult names or explanations, his dad would translate, but for the most part Draco was happy to learn without assistance. Something about it being easier to remember if he was forced to pay attention.
Crowley snorted, snatching the letter from his partner's hand so he can look at the shopping list. "That would be your first question. You can, but I don't think they let first years on the team. Sorry kid."
Harry just grinned brightly at them and continued to the front of the room where Dumbledore stood waiting. He gave a short speech of strange words that Harry didn't quite understand, before turning it over to Professor McGonagal.
“They had him sleeping in a cupboard,” Severus said quietly, careful to keep his anger in check as to not draw the boy’s attention. Narcissa looked shocked, like she almost didn’t believe him but when her husband didn’t contradict his statement, her face turned red with anger. “The room was barely big enough for him and all he had was a mattress on the ground and a piece of parchment on the wall that said “Harry’s Room”. It was under the stairs, for Merlin’s sake,” he growled, fists clenching in his lap.
He was sorted into Slytherin just as fast as Ron had been sorted, the hat barely even touching his head. There was a proud smirk on his face when the table erupted into cheers and he strutted in that direction, his robes magically colouring green.
He wasn’t dressed very well, in fact Draco was hard pressed to think he was dressed any better than a house elf, but he carefully hid his disdain with the reminder that this boy had grown up with
Harry still looked confused, but to Draco’s delight, he shuffled out a bit from his father’s leg and stuck his hands out to show they were empty, bowing slightly. His form was terrible, his hands more shoved out than gently displayed and he bowed much too deeply, but Draco was pleased anyway, and it appeared the adults were as well. Besides, there was plenty of time to teach him properly before he met anyone else. When he glanced back up, he signed a few things in Draco’s direction, fingers slowly spelling something out before he took two fingers and waved them in the air above his face in the shape of a sowilo.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
“It’s a year book,” Draco said easily, shifting the heavy book in his hands to prop it open and show Harry the large group photo on the first page. “It’s got images from everyone who went to Hogwarts with our parents,” he explained, pointing to a silver haired man that he knew Harry recognized as Lucius, and a dark brown haired woman that was his mother. Harry’s mouth was hanging open in surprise as the image shifted and moved, the students shuffling or smiling as the camera ran. Draco shifted it again to point towards a dark, greasy looking man and the red-haired woman hugging him. “That’s Uncle Severus and your mother.”
Lucius’ voice cut through the silence of the street, but Severus was grateful for his soft tone and the gentle hand his friend placed on his shoulder. The potions master hadn’t noticed that they’d been standing at the door for a few moments without moving, and he might have been surprised that Lucius didn’t grow impatient if he didn’t know the man so well.
They didn't have to wait long before the door was all but yanked open. A much too thin woman stood in the doorway, her hair perfectly coiled and her floral dress perfectly pressed. She looked prepared to glare at them before her expression softened into a very practiced politeness. "Yes, hello. What can I do for you?" Her eyes settled on Aziraphale for a moment before she frowned. "I'm afraid we already have a church if that's what you want."
“It’s a letter from Lily Potter,” Lucius said quietly, the words barely heard over the crackle of the fire that Tipsy had started. She could feel Severus shiver in her arms, but waited for her husband to continue. “It’s to be delivered upon the tenth birthday of her son, Hadrian, in the case that something happened to her. Gringots must have sent it today.”
"Yes," the demon nodded in agreement. "But Harry has gone through a lot. He may not know it, but he has. It's bound to push him back a bit. The kid had to watch his mother die in front of him. I believe he's earned a bit of slack on the talking front." There was a long silence and Crowley peeked open an eye to stare at the angel. It was clear Aziraphale was still upset, perhaps worried, but he knew the demon was correct in his assessment so he didn't deign to continue the argument, or the gentle pushing towards Harry.
“He’s asked Severus to come grocery shopping with him,” the blonde continued, eyebrows scrunched together in confusion and anger. “It appears his relatives have gone on a trip for a fortnight and have left him nothing to eat.”
'The snake,' Crowley realized, smacking his forehead and sighing. He should have known Harry wouldn't leave the thing there.
“Had the boy been literally anyone other than who he is, I figure this would be an easy case. They would have signed the boy over and prosecuted the magical guardian immediately, especially considering the wills were ignored. However,” he continued before his wife could question him, “the ministry was unfortunately in agreement with Dumbledore at the time in question. They didn’t know anything about Severus being Harry’s birth father, however, which works in our favor more than theirs. Their missive was rather short in response, but they’ve agreed to a meeting by the end of the week to discuss the case.”
Been a while, hasn't it? Good to hear from you and I'm sorry about James and Lily. As for how we found out, Sirius called in a favor I owed him. I trust you won't use that information against him, as I've found out he's trapped in that terrible Ministry prison. Aziraphale went along with it perfectly, and honestly I'm surprised he was so calm about the situation. You'll never believe where we found Harry. Those bastards had him locked in a cupboard under the stairs! The stairs, Minerva! We left up your wards for them, but I do hope they rot in hell for the way they've treated Harry.
Harry wasn't quite sure how to take that, nor did he know how the boy knew his name, but he shrugged and continued on to look for somewhere to sit.
"Well it hardly seems to be doing you any good," Aziraphale scoffed before stepping past the woman and into the home. Crowley just smirked at her incredulous look before following the angel in. "Honestly, to think you've been given such a gift and still so much hatred settles in your heart. Many would die to have what you've been given."
“TILLY!” He roars, and she presses her hand to her ears and cowers. He’ll feel bad about that later, but he needs information now. “Library or study?”
“You’re moving in together?” Molly asks, a cross between pleased and offended. “Percy dear, why didn’t you tell me? Don’t you think it’s a little early? No offense, Tonks, of course.”
The space where her neck and back meet is clear, and he settles there, wrapping his arms around her neck.
Draco considers going on that spiel for a second because at least it’ll be distracting, but there’s the elephant in the room that they’re not discussing. Harry’s washed his hands of the whole thing because it was seriously stressing him out so he’s elected to instead actively ignore it instead, but Draco has a much better track record of meddling in other people’s love lives. Really, he’s more qualified to have this conversation than Harry is.
He shrugs. “Yes. But it’s a risk I’m willing to take.” He doesn’t want anything to happen to his family, of course he doesn’t, he’s been going to all this effort and lying for years to prevent it. But he doesn’t want anything to happen to his soulmate or his friends either.
This is already sounding like a conversation that would be better suited to Draco or Hermione, but obviously he can’t say that, so instead he just nods.
“I,” he hesitates. He’s never done anything like this before, except maybe Ron’s hand. He looks towards McGonagall, and he can see the pattern of her veins just based on the poison glowing through her skin. If the floo connects, who knows if they’ll even be able to convince a healer to come through, if there’s even on available. They don’t usually answer calls from Hogwarts since the castle has Poppy, who’s the best of them.  So, they’re right, they can’t waste the time. “Cassius, Cedric, guard the door. Don’t let anyone through, especially whoever did this to her, but literally no one unless they’re a healer.”
“Ah,” he looks away and rubs the back of his neck, and Harry wants to take it back, it’s none of his business, and Cedric’s a good guy. He shouldn’t pry. “I – look, I know I’m only a couple of years older than you, so this is going to sound preachy and pretentious, and like I’m kind of an ass. But can I tell you something? Something that I wished someone had told me?”
Umbridge wails, scratching at her face in an attempt to get it off, but it’s already started to harden, so she’s only partially successful. She goes stumbling towards the door, and Daphne magics it open while Seamus calls out, “I think you need to go to the hospital wing, Professor! Let me help. Just a bit more, go a little to the left – there you go!”
Could this get any worse? He presses his lips into a thin line and stomps over to Dumbledore’s desk, grabbing the diary and smacking it into Arthur’s chest. “If you truly want to thank me, you could teach your children not to be such
This is probably the exact opposite of what Draco wants him to do, the opposite of what they were trying to achieve, but he doesn’t bloody care. He whips out his wand, pointing it at Moody. “Put him down,” he says, and he doesn’t recognize his voice. It sounds cold. It sounds like Draco’s does when he’s pissed off.
“It’s a better idea than me trying this without having any idea what I’m doing,” he points out. He hadn’t slept at all since seeing Snape’s memories, still trying to process everything. He thinks he’s mostly managed to keep everyone from suspecting anything this morning, but he couldn’t bring himself to go to potions class, can’t make himself go and face Snape. Not yet.
Bill places his broad palm against his back, warm even through his clothes. “It’s okay, you’re safe now.”
Harry launches himself at Ron, who thankfully hasn’t gotten any taller in the two weeks since they’ve seen each other. Maybe his never ending growth has finally coming to an end, which is good because if he gets any taller he’s just going to look silly. Ron catches him and spins him around just because he can, grinning. “What are
“Packing,” Lupin says calmly, and half the classroom is indeed already packed away. His lips quirk up at the corners, “I’m glad you’re all right, after what happened. Did you come here to deliver your mother’s punishment? I’m afraid if will be slightly less effective, since I’m quitting anyway.” His eyes drop to Draco’s cloak, “Or have you come to enact your father’s method? You did say that’s what would happen if I endangered Harry, and I’m not sure we can call me transforming in front of him anything else.”
“Any chance we can skip the studying and go make out in your room?” Harry tries. He’s actually been really looking forward to making out in Draco’s room. It’ll be a bit hard to do it in his, since he’s sharing it with four other boys instead of just one.
“Well, we have our Owls this year,” he says in a reasonable tone of voice. Susan slumps in relief, and he almost feels sorry for her. Doesn’t she know him at all? Obviously he’s not going to leave it there. “Plus, Voldemort’s back and looking to start another war, so there’s that.”
He knows he’s made the right call when Cedric’s shoulders slump in relief and he flashes him a smile.
Pansy shakes her head. “Of course I did. You can’t wear just one bathing suit on vacation. I only let you get away with it this past summer because we spent most of it inland.”
Hermione looks incredible. Her hair’s still curly, but the curls are looser and shining, and she’s got thigh high boots on with a long black dress that has slits nearly to her hips. She’s not wearing any jewelry, and almost all of her skin is covered, but she outfit is dramatic and eye-catching enough that he literally does a doubletake.
It’s nearing the end of the night when Remus and Sirius exchange a look and stand up. “Harry,” Remus calls out, “come here.”
They both look down at the chessboard and make a face. Remus waves a hand, and the pieces begin putting themselves away. “We’ve been planning our days around fixing up the house. But if Kreacher wants to do it, we don’t want to get in his way. So now,” he shrugs. “I’m a kept man these days. It’s not like I have job to get to, so we’re sadly playing chess.”
Snape finally starts acting like an actual teacher and puts a stop to it, and sends Goyle to the hospital wing. But he doesn’t send Hermione. Her teeth are growing past her chin now, and if someone doesn’t do something they won’t stop. Draco knows the counter hex, but he can’t use it, obviously. The worst part is he knows Snape knows it too, but if he hadn’t bothered to cast it on Goyle he’s definitely not going to cast it on Granger.
“There’s more coming,” Kinglsey says brusquely, ignoring both Dumbledore and Lucius’s questions. “More aurors and the minister too. Anyone who doesn’t want to get stuck explaining what they’re doing here has to leave.”
“Fine,” Harry says, “you’re making buttons for the Ravenclaws, right?” He nods. “Can you make like – twice as many?”
Draco rolls his eyes and jerks his head to the side, clearly telling him to just go with it, and the last bit of restraint Harry has falls away. He raises his arms in the air, beaming, and the chants and cheers get louder.
Hermione scowls, which he knows is because he can’t actually get into the specifics of anyone he’s treating, and now he’s made her
“Why don’t we ask? We can sit here talking about them, or we can talk to them. Draco doesn’t have class until after lunch, let’s go ask him to talk to Winky now?” He reaches into his back pocket for his compact. Draco had added a permanent sticking charm and unbreakable charm to them both after he’d repaired his and reconnected it back to Harry’s.
He still manages another couple minutes of making out before Draco heads back the dungeon, and he goes to the tower. The younger years are being kept in by Ron guarding the entrance, and he only manages to quickly assure everyone that everything is fine before he climbs into his dormitory and falls face first into the bed.
“Is it trying to ensure the caster becomes a ghost?” Ron suggests. “If it kills you and then calls your soul back, but your soul can’t enter your body because you’re dead, you’d become a ghost, wouldn’t you?”
“Why does Viktor being stiff mean he’s horrible?” Harry asks, cautiously shifting his foot to adjust the height of the broom up then down. Fleur and Viktor keep level with him easily. “He clearly has control of his broom, much more than I do.”
fault? Sorry, you’re the git who’s running around petrifying muggleborns, so this is definitely your fault.” He’s not a hundred percent certain what ‘this’ is, but he is certain that he’s not taking responsibility for it.
George pushes him away, eyes wide. “Are you out of you mind? Everyone can see us! Your parents are here, they’re going to kill you, you can’t just–”
“That is very strange,” Hermione says, frowning. “I didn’t think anything could get past your wards.”
Draco arrives late to the platform, which means he’s among the last of the students to get on the train, barely taking the time to say goodbye to his parents before rushing onto the Hogwarts Express. Winky is taking care of his trunk, so at least he doesn’t have to worry about loading it onto the train.
Draco doesn’t even bother glaring at her for it. “How many layers can your body take before it rebounds? Are you going to go into shock as you undo them? How long can you maintain before your body rejects the change?”
Kreacher appears with a crack. “Traitorous young master,” he greets, disappearing his stuff with a snap of his fingers. Hopefully just to his room.
“There is something else we have to talk about,” Remus says, and Harry doesn’t like the sound of that at all. Sirius sighs and lean back in his chair. “What with Voldemort back, Dumbledore has reinstated the Order of the Phoenix, which is the group that fought against Voldemort in the last war. They need a secret, secure place to hold meetings. They want to hold them here.”
He has to repeat the process three more times before the poison inside of her is down to a manageable level. He could maybe do it one more time, but the spells and the potions and draining the blood is all a strain on McGonagall’s body, to the point where she just straight up falls asleep during all of it until Angelina waking her up to take the blood replenishing potion. Her body will take care of the rest on it’s own, and he doesn’t want to make it that much harder for her by putting her through another round of bloodletting, potion, and spell just to remove what would probably be a negligible amount of poison from her blood.
The twins and Hermione are scandalized, while Ginny is furious. Ron, for some reason, looks delighted.
Harry stops drinking towards the end of the night, or, well, early morning. Ron and Viktor are still going strong, and he ends up tipped against Hermione, watching them.
“I’m taking that as a yes,” Ron says, then kisses her again, although this time he keeps it chaste before breaking away and continuing to the other side of the table, sitting down across from Hermione like nothing had happened.
Snape rolls his eyes, clearly able to tell that Harry doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “When Fleur Delacour killed Barty Crouch Jr., how did she do it?”
The three brothers stumble over themselves explaining, talking over one another, until Ron gets irritated and slaps his hand over the twins’ mouths. “House elves are made of magic,” he says, and then Fred peals his hand away and says, “No, you’re already getting it wrong–”
He shrugs, “Better they’re staring at my robes rather than my scar. Besides, it seems important to them.” And it’s kind of important to him too, actually. But that’s a little too embarrassing to admit out loud.
Now it’s time for the reception. Everyone starts making their way out of the tent, talking excitedly about it, and he overhears more than one person commenting on her dress.
Harry huffs, giving up and carefully pushing himself away from Draco and supporting his own weight. “All right, fair enough. But Lupin isn’t, so can you stop now?”
“Because it’s not,” he answers, not wanting to get too distracted from his point but also not wanting his friends to waste time being worried. “Breaking the rules isn’t evil. The rules themselves aren’t good or evil. They just are. We exist in a realm where the dead have no power. Ghosts are unnatural for this reason too, but they’re not evil just for existing. In order for necromancy to work, or for ghosts to exist, you have to break those rules and use necromantic magic. Creating your own necromantic magic is difficult and dangerous. Using the necromantic magic that already exists is easy. Well, comparatively.”
“It fits,” she answers, more reflexive than defensive. “Have you read his most recent press release? Like anyone cares about streamlining the process to get an apparition license when he’s threatening to raise the taxes on its maintenance. Pretty much everyone would rather wait an extra hour in line then pay a renewal fee every year, so putting them together like one negates the other just makes him look like an idiot.”
Harry laughs, then leans over the table to kiss his cheek, which is gross considering the half a waffle he’s crammed into his mouth. He at least swallows before saying, “Sorry, honey.”
“Abigail wants bacon,” Harry says, twisting in his chair to face Winky. But his eyes catch on the entrance to the kitchen. Sirius is leaning against the door frame, arms crossed and a grin stretched across his face. “How long have you been standing there?” It’s a good thing Sirius doesn’t speak Parseltongue, otherwise he would have totally just spilled all his soulmate’s secrets.
, but Draco’s grinning at him, all excited and eager, and really, the absolute best thing is being with Draco and making him happy, so.
“We’ve been dating for over a year,” Draco can’t help but point out, “the only thing blossoming about it are our soulmarks.”
the house, maybe? And that’s why he can fly in it. The attic is a greenhouse, and it’s as big as the rest of the house, so he can fly in it. That sounds right. Right? He tries to say that in Tamil, and it takes him three times longer than it would for him to say it English, and almost all of his grammar is wrong.
Draco is awoken by the feeling of something large and heavy falling on top of him, and he groans before pushing himself upright, and coming face to face with a huge, familiar snake. “Fuck,” he says, “Is Voldemort here?”
Voldemort stares at him for a long moment, then points to a shelf right next to him and says, “Pick that up.”
Harry sniffs and turns his head into Draco, so his soft lips and warm breath are right against his neck. This is cheating. “They’re being so mean to me.”
Everyone turns to Harry, for obvious reasons, and he thinks back to the times he’s been in Dumbledore’s office since the sword’s return. He supposes the sword does give off its own hum of energy, but frankly lots of things in Dumbledore’s office do that, so he’d never thought much about it. “She’s right, although I’m not sure how many people would be paying that much attention.”
“It’s still risky,” Blaise says, but he doesn’t look angry anymore, which is good. Angry Blaise is rare, and all the more terrifying because of it. He’s like Zaira that way. Draco’s pretty sure if Zaira ever raised her voice at him he’d burst into tears.
Sirius and Remus leave after extracting a promise from him not to get himself cursed again before the holidays, which seems to be inviting bad luck more than anything else.
“If you want me to feel pity for your cowardice, it’s not working,” Hermione says. “It’s my turn now. Don’t fight me.”
Winky looks like she’s about to have a heart attack, and Harry isn’t far behind. “Maybe don’t do that.”
He turns her arm over, but when he looks up, Katie and Angelina are watching him. “I didn’t see anything, and you didn’t either, got it?”
Currently, he’s in Flitwick’s office grading first year essays while laying back on a divan that’s much too long for Flitwick, and that Draco’s pretty sure wasn’t in his office those first few years. He can’t decide between being offended or touched that of all the furniture Flitwick could have possibly supplied him with, he chose a fainting couch. He’d entered his office and flung himself across his desk more than once, so maybe Flitwick just got sick of him messing up his papers.
“Based on the level of decomposition, it’s been a few days,” Harry says. “Whoever did this is long gone.”
She smiles. He thinks it might be the first time he’s ever seen her smile. “Terrified. But it’s not like it’s much safer for me at home than it is here. It’s one thing to have a bastard child with a muggle. It’s another thing entirely to claim that child as your own and give her your name.”
“Because you would have ducked out of dinner and probably skipped charms to finish it and having you mysteriously disappear for a day before we attempt to steal an extremely important magical object is stupid,” Pansy answers. “Also, if I’m not allowed to skip to work on Tonk’s dress, then you’re not allowed to skip it to forge our fake Griffin sword.”
ceiling. He can’t know for certain, not until it gets dark and he can check the constellations, but he says, “It’s Tamil Nadu.” He looks back down, and inside the orb two smoky arrows are pointing in opposite directions along the metal band. He runs his finger along it, and the bright patch of sky above him gets smaller, and when he does it the opposite way it’s gets bigger. He can make it small enough to play above his dormitory bed, or large enough to fill the great hall.
Percy sighs. “Fine, if it’ll make you happy. No paperwork.” Tonks kisses him on the cheek, and he looks a lot less upset at the idea of not being productive for a few hours.
“I love that woman,” Sirius says, “She’s so willing to sell her morals away, I really admire that in a person.”
Tonks delivers Cedric to the woman in purple and leans forward to kiss him on both cheeks before stepping back to stand behind him.
“He’s feeling loquacious,” says one of the third years, Daphne’s younger sister. She’s not even being sarcastic.
“A hungry human!” Ron confirms, pulling on his school uniform. Harry can’t tell if he’s genuinely oblivious or if he’s just being an asshole. “If you don’t hurry up, I will abandon you for eggs, and bacon, and toast, and
He slides off Firenze’s back and he can land on his feet just fine, but Harry’s smiling a little bit when he falls into his arms instead, squeezing him almost too tightly for a moment before putting him down.
,” Asim is telling him, gesturing with his bottle and splashing it over some of their equations. It’s the ones that had told them their current specification would end in a possible black hole, so he’s not too worried about it.
“It’s delicious, don’t worry,” she says, giving him a warm smile. “I wouldn’t feed you something awful, and if you hate it, we’ll order something else.”
“Give me the names, I’ll ask, and if the Yokuts can’t do it themselves they might be able to give me the name of someone who can,” Draco says.
Just then another body goes sailing through the air, and Harry rubs his eyes, just in case he’s seeing things. But Sprout bounces onto her feet much the same way Susan had, mouth stretched into a grin and her cheeks flushed. “Oh, hello Mr. Potter! You’ve made a huge disaster, and I’m very angry with you.”
When McGonagall comes to collect him, she at least waits until the portrait door swings shut behind them to ask, “What did you do?”
“I don’t think they’re technically married, actually,” Blaise says. “It’s easier for them to keep their money separate that way. Robert’s business is good, of course, but it’s mostly a front so that Rosmerta can funnel all her illegally gotten funds through there instead of the Three Broomsticks, which gets audited way too much for that. Since, you know, she’s implicated pretty frequently in the crimes that she allegedly commits. They’re together, obviously, but I think they just call each other husband and wife.”
“One talon?” Pansy interrupts dubiously. “Even those of a large female aren’t going to be much bigger than a hand’s width.”
Then she’s on her way, trying to navigate through the maze with just the point me spell to guide her. Draco takes a deep breath, then does the same. He reaches a couple dead ends, a trap that blinds him until he can dispel it, and a small hoard of pixies that he has to fight off. He’s calm only because he’s too scared to panic. But the spell keeps working, and Fleur doesn’t change position. That worries him. She should be moving, and she isn’t. It can’t mean anything good.
He’d almost think that they were messing with him, except they’re obviously serious. “Well, mine does. I can tell the difference when one of you guys is wearing it. As long as the person under the cloak stays quiet, no one’s going to notice.”
“That’s because the national team sucks,” he says. Actually, he probably wouldn’t have trouble making it onto any team, since they’d be so eager to have famous Harry Potter playing for them that they might not even care about his ability. That’s just depressing. Could he glamour himself for auditions maybe? “Okay, change of plans. I’ll be a professional glider instead. Fleur’s on the French team, I’m sure she can pull some strings.” Getting a spot just because of his fame leaves a bad taste in his mouth, but he has no problem with cashing in on Fleur’s.
He’s so, so grateful for Pansy and Millie. If it weren’t for them, Harry doesn’t know who would handle this level of friend not-drama. Ginny has never met a situation she couldn’t brute force her way through and Luna tends to give her advice in obscure metaphors, to the point where sometimes he doesn’t even realize its advice until several days later. Granted, Hermione’s a lot smarter than he is, so that might not be a problem for her.
He’s convinced he’s better off than the rest of them until he walks through the doors of St. Mungo’s and gets directed to the basement.
Voldemort is controlling her just like he controlled Theophania. Or maybe not just like it – with Theophania it had been imperio, he thinks, but this is more like possession, like what he did to Ginny.
He’s covered in various scrapes and bruises, but his only major injury is his leg. He silently points at the cut across his upper thigh.
Draco swims closer and hesitantly reaches out, pressing his thumb against Harry’s bottom lip. “Not to alarm you–”
“Yes, Harry,” she says softly, “I like him. If it matters, I think your parents would have liked him too.”
Lily trips and goes tumbling to the ground, but Petunia doesn’t notice, still running forward. Harry moves to help her up before remembering this is a memory and that he can’t do anything at all.
All of the fourth years are hanging out in the boys’ dormitory, since they can’t go to the girls’ dorm. Ron is the one who gets the message, sent by Blaise. It’s a time, and a place, and beneath it, written in the boy’s perfect cursive is:
Lucius Malfoy is here. Draco’s father is here. It’s not like he’s surprised, but it somehow makes this whole situation even worse.
“We can yell at him later,” Harry says. “We came here to get a locket, and that’s still what we have to do to leave, presumably, so nothing’s changed.”
“Enough,” he says, and her mouth clicks shut. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Winky, tell me the truth. Did you start a fight with this castle elf?”
Harry feels as if they’re getting off track again. “What does fracturing a soul have to do with anything?”
into those woods, and if he sent them into a trap then it’s his obligation to go rushing in a after them in a traditionally Gryffindor foolhardy fashion.
Draco lets out a sigh of relief and lets the shield drop. He falls back into his seat, wiping sweat from his forehead, and tries to avoid the couple hundred pairs of eyes that are on him. Blaise summons him a glass of water, and Pansy shifts closer so he can lean against her without making it obvious that’s what he’s doing.
Harry meets Draco in their classroom that night. He only manages it because Ron helps distract their roommates so he can disappear, and he doesn’t know he managed at all back when he was hiding it from his best friend too.
She grins. “Well, when you put it like that. Careful, or everyone will figure out you’re secretly a romantic.”
“Hey,” he says, absently tugging on Millie’s hair as he walks past her. “What are you doing up so late?”
Ink bleeds across the page, forming an image of a roaring chimera. More ink slides across the front of the map, and everyone’s leaning forward, trying to get a good look.
“You’re right, giving her power over Hogwarts is the lesser of two evils. I’m sorry,” Hermione says earnestly.
him, like copper, or something he could store it in to magnify its effects without destabilizing it, like obsidian. But anything he adds has its own kind of magical energy, making it different than the one they’re trying to replicate. They’re trying to make an extremely complex magical sword out of three things, more or less, and they’re not goblins, so it’s seeming more and more impossible. It’s not like he can bind the silver to the griffin claws or the rubies –
“To be fair, Harry,” Ron says, “Voldemort also cruciod you, and you were almost hit by the killing curse, so really, the two of you are even.” He pauses. “Actually, maybe you both should stop living this lifestyle. It doesn’t seem healthy.”
Harry goes white, and Draco almost wants to apologize. But Harry started this, and he might be his soulmate but that doesn’t mean he gets to talk shit about his parents. He lets go of his robes and steps away. “I was such an idiot to think you were any better than the rest of them.”
“Good luck with your extra class,” Ron says, clapping him on the shoulder. Harry glares, because seriously, doesn’t he have enough to do? “Hey, at least it’s not math.”
“He’s a Parseltongue, he’s famous, he’s Harry Potter,” Asim lists off. “If they’re going to do it for anyone, it might be him. A spell dancer can do in months what will takes us years, if we’re lucky.”
Her plans for the shrieking shack, however, are awesome, even incomplete. He’s hoping she'll finish them up over the summer.
When he opens them again, he notices several things all at once. He’s laying down, he’s in the hospital wing, it’s dark, and he definitely passed out. Great. That’s an automatic notice home.
,” he answers, and he’s confident in that phrase at least. He says ‘I don’t know’ an awful lot. Hermione usually goes on trips with her parents, but he has no idea about anyone else.
“Don’t move!” Harry snaps, pressing his elbow into Percy’s side. The green light is headed straight for him, and of course Tonks doesn’t listen, yanking Percy behind her. He twists in her grip, trying to make sure he’s the one to take the spell. Draco’s pale, but he holds the shield, which is really what Harry had been worried about, and the sickly green light of the spell passes by them and careens into the skeleton, the runes carved into briefly glowing green before disappearing.
“Well, he doesn’t exactly treat everyone like he treats you,” Quinn points out. Harry’s getting ready to yell again when ze says, “But you’re right.”
No. Well, yes, but it’s hard in fascinating ways. He’s never really gotten his friends’ interest in academic things. Not just Hermione and Draco, who are frankly a little insane, but even Ron’s casual interest in alchemy, even if he hates math, and Pansy’s love of transfiguration, and Blaise and Neville’s ongoing affair with herbology. He likes magic, but he likes it for the sake of it being magic, and he’s never been really invested in something before. He’s good at defense, and he likes it, but it’s just – something he’s good at and enjoys. He’s not passionate about defense, not really.
“You’re done?” he asks, surprised. They’d been making good progress, but this place is huge. Sometimes it feels like new rooms pop up every time he turns a corner, and since this is a magical house, that’s not exactly outside the realm of possibility.
i post writing updates in my 'progress report' tag if that's something you're interested in knowing :)
“Oh,” he says, a mix of disappointment and pride sweeping through him, “It wasn’t my dad. It was me.”
Harry sneaks a glance at Perenelle, but she looks more amused than anything else. McGonagall has her hand over her mouth, but he’s pretty sure it’s to hold in a laugh. He’s reminded of her hitting Dumbledore upside the head for being dramatic, and he knows professors are people, obviously, but it always throws him when he sees them acting that way.
They walk side by side through the maze, wands gripped in their fists. They set off a trap that sends a few dozen arrows their way, and Cedric takes care of that by summoning a powerful gust of wind. They happen upon another boggart, two more traps, and an angry swarm of poisonous butterflies before Harry thinks they’re getting somewhere.
that Filius had known about Marietta. He’s a little surprised Snape told him about the first time. “I haven’t, actually, the second time was Hermione. And you won’t. Are you coming or not?”
Well, yes, because that would make him a liar and lying to Poppy never ends well for anyone, especially not him. She can and will take her displeasure out on him during healing tutoring sessions and he’d like to avoid that if he can. “It’s been a while since I’ve done a quality check on your potions cabinet, hasn’t it? All those terrible smelly potions that need to be looked over and reorganized based on effectiveness.”
He rubs his nose. “It turns out I’m not that good at killing things. Unkilling things, however? My specialty.” He stops. “That makes it sound like reanimated her, but I didn’t know how to do that yet. She was alive, I was just making a necromancer joke.”
All of the aurors just look confused, but the Weasleys and Hermione wince. Kingsley turns just enough to catch sight of Molly, and it’s probably not a good sign when a senior auror looks afraid.
Harry tries to think of how to ask him what he does during the summer in Tamil, but all he can think of is
Hermione rolls her eyes, head buried in book. “I have no idea where Ron is, he got a letter about an hour ago and ran out of the common room.”
She curves her body in on herself, looking less like a deadly magical snake and more like a pile of morose rope. “
He turns to the side, looks at them, and settles his gaze on McGonagall. “I understand about perceptions, about wanting to keep your soulmate a secret because it will cause too much trouble.” He tugs down the side of his pants, just enough to reveal the three marigolds on his hip.
“To represent you in court, of course,” he answers. “You don’t need a lawyer. According to the law, you’re guilty, and everyone knows it. You need a performer.”
“You’re staying here,” he repeats, thinking. “Or we’re going to Blaise’s. Actually, maybe it’s time for all of us to take a trip to Italy.”
Tomorrow, they’re going to attempt to steal Gryffindor’s sword so they can return it to the goblins by just switching it out with a fake one while Dumbledore’s back is turned.
This is impossible. It should take about twelve hours for the body to be cold, but it’s impossible that she’s been dead that long. Twelve hours ago this hallway would have been bustling with people, it’s been maybe four hours, and she shouldn’t be cold already. Not this cold.
Draco rolls his eyes. “We’re here too,” someone yells, and then Draco is being pushed out of the view of the mirror and Pansy thrusts herself into the frame. “Hi! Wow, Harry, your room is so nice.”
Draco considers getting an early night’s sleep or doing some of the reading he still has for Poppy, but instead he heads to the Gryffindor tower. Harry’s around somewhere and Draco’s positive he can get him to abandon whatever he’s currently doing to tell him he’s pretty and badly braid his hair. It’s about the effort, really, even if Draco ends up having to redo it himself half the time whenever Harry tries to do anything more complicated than a simple three strand braid. Maybe Pansy could teach him.
“Gone,” he says, standing and walking backwards out of her office. He’s back in the hallway, and the door doesn’t quite shut fast enough to hide the sound of her laughter.
Lisa Turpin has ink on her lips from her unfortunate habit of not paying close enough to attention to what is and isn’t a sugar quill. “The stunning jinx worked for about seven seconds! Maybe try that again?”
It’s early enough that the tables are still mostly empty, so there’s plenty of room for them to sit down. “Hey guys,” Harry greets. “Did you have a good summer?”
They’re slowly working their way through the griffin sword. Blaise and Millie spend all their spare time sitting pressed up against each other, their heads bent over a shared piece of parchment, including at meal times or in the spare minutes between classes where everyone can see them. Harry thinks that this seems like suspicious behavior that they should perhaps be avoiding, but no one else seems to find it at all out of the ordinary.
Well, he’s lost them then, at least until this is fixed, since he’s not going to torture himself by going back to the common room and dealing with whatever commotion is currently happening there. Which, considering pretty much every professor here is an expert in their field and a highly accomplished witch or wizard outside of that, it’s going to last exactly as long as they want it to.
“You know,” Pansy says, “if we’re going to expand the group, we should just cave and include Ginny.”
“I didn’t!” he yells, glaring. “Of course I didn’t, how could you – I said no more secrets, and I meant it! You know everything about me, you know about my Parseltongue and my soulmate and my nightmares and – you know
“Percy didn’t tell us anything,” George says, “He doesn’t tell anyone anything, except maybe Tonks. Cassius told us.”
Myrtle blushes silver and she presses a kiss against Hagrid’s cheek. “You’re sweet. You’ve always been sweet. It’s too bad what Tom did to you and me and M-“
She smiles at him, then turns to the mirror, says “Have a good evening, Harry,” and steps out of frame.
, of course, how kids all get used to only calling on magic when they need it, to only channeling it through their wands and letting magic be amplified and controlled by them. But it should have occurred to him to at least try.
The basement has been transformed so half of it is set up as a fully functioning potions lab and the other is a dueling room. Pansy had designed the wards to absorb magic rather than rebounding it, so everything from explosions to stray spells wouldn’t affect the integrity of the house. They use the chamber of secrets for the RA and dueling
He’s finally allowed to look in the mirror, and the square of cloth has formed itself into a robe. It falls down so it almost touches the floor, and the sleeves are long and billowing. It doesn’t clasp in the middle, instead sticking to his sides so the front of the suit is still on full display even while it maintains the proper robe shape and silhouette.
“Performing alchemy requires a certain adaptability and flexibility of thought,” Perenelle continues. “That’s what we’ll be testing for today.”
On one hand, Draco never actually got around to completing the paper for his sky projections, and he did promise Filius that he would finish that up and submit it to the Charms Review. On the other hand, this is easily the coolest thing he’s ever made, and he has an uncharacteristic urge to tell everyone about it immediately. At least this time he mostly remembered to take notes and write down his reference materials as he went along, instead of having to back track and figure out what on earth he’d done after the fact.
Harry is so angry he can’t speak. There’s a mix of guilt and worry churning inside of him, and he doesn’t know how to articulate any of it. So instead he jerks the waistband of his pants down and pulls up his shirt. The rich colors of the iris contrast against his skin, and Ron knows he has a soulmate, he’s seen the little black ring on his hip. He knows what this means. He reaches forward and with shaking fingers delicately touches the edge of a single purple petal. “Malfoy?”
Cho wrinkles her nose. “We can keep talking about this, but, if we do, I’m going to throw up all over this table, so, you know, your call.”
Pansy latches onto the topic of conversation with full force, and Harry does his best not to think of all the things that everyone isn’t saying.
“Yeah,” he says, and the relief of just having Draco there when he needs him makes him feel like it’s almost not a lie.
He got the highest defense score this year. Not just at Hogwarts, but in all of Europe, since all the European magical schools take Owls and Newts.
A couple weeks ago, Pomfrey would have given him detention for talking to her like that. But now, she only rolls her eyes, and Flitwick just beams at him. Pomfrey raises an eyebrow. “What makes you think we were talking about you?”
Draco grits his teeth, then forces himself to relax and breathe. He holds out his wand, straining his memory and focusing on every overly detailed paragraph of Scamander’s Index. “Serpensortia! Serpensortia! Serpensortia!”
“There are a couple more things in play,” Amelia says mildly. Draco wonders if they should be showing a little more deference to the new minister of magic, but realistically it’s too late for that. Harry doesn’t really show deference to anybody and Zaira being here after everything else that had happened tonight had scraped away what little formality Draco had left. “But feel free to go and put him to bed.”
Riding Buckbeak was awesome, and Payne is basically like the best rollercoaster in the world. But she’s all tightly coiled power coupled with a sense of ease in the air. She should be straining to lift herself, but it almost feels like the air is working with her to get her where she wants to be. He looks down, and the stadium is getting steadily smaller. Payne is right underneath them, and this is the highest he’s ever flown.
The buttons vanish, returning back to the manor. Lupin blinks, mouth opening and then closing. “Mr. Malfoy?”
“From Harry Potter, we have taken his friend, Ronald Weasley,” he finishes. “When the fireworks go off, you may begin. To all the champions – good luck!”
“Still haven’t found it?” she asks mockingly, “I thought you didn’t care, that it was stupid and a hiding place for stupid girls.”
Healing them all takes the better part of an hour, and by the end of it he’s seriously considering a nap, or at least a pepper up potion.
“I’m Ron, and this is Harry,” he says calmly, “We’re friends with Fleur, and we’re going to take you to the shore. She’s probably waiting for you there. But I need you to relax, okay?”
She hands him back his wand handle first. He takes a deep breath, then points it at the pig’s heart in the center of the examination tray. “Cicer!”
Cedric turns to face him again, a stubborn set to his mouth that makes Harry want to strangle him. “You should take it Harry. You should win.”
He curses internally, because she’s right. Just because she’s his aunt doesn’t mean she’s on his side. “You’re right, I’m sorry. I just hate being forced to hide in my own house.”
Things are still stalled regarding the war efforts. With Draco’s parents killing a good chunk of the loyal death eaters and Voldemort without a body, it’s really down to Bellatrix and her small group of followers. No one’s heard anything out of them since they burned down Ollivander’s shop, although there have been a series of unsuccessful attacks on the Gringott’s bank. From what Ron told him after hearing about it from Percy, the goblins are pissed about the whole thing since whoever it is doesn’t get in, but has managed to get away. The general consensus seems to be that it’s Bellatrix and her group, but no one knows what they’re looking for.
She sniffles, looking up with tear filled eyes. She stares at him for a long moment before placing her hand in his.
to so badly he can taste it. When he shows up to the informational meeting and sees Hermione there, he has to bite back a grin. She’s probably also too busy to take this class, but he’s pretty sure she’d murder anyone who tried to stop her.
He heads for Ron, but as soon as he gets about twenty feet in about two dozen merpeople with spears form lines in front of them. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
Cho rolls her eyes, huddled into Cedric’s side. She’s sandwiched between him and Quinn, and Marietta keeps shooting her confused and hurt looks from the Ravenclaw table. They used to be best friends, but Cho’s been giving her the cold shoulder ever since she found out what she did, but the worst part is Marietta doesn’t even know why. Harry tries to imagine what it would be like if Ron suddenly started ignoring him for absolutely no reason, and he feels bad for her, just a little. Cho says, “There are only a few months left to the school year. Besides, the majority of the board of governors voted to have Dumbledore reinstated. Umbridge is ignoring them, and Fudge is letting them, which is just. Great.”
, not a sport. Presentation matters, and Viktor is a statue on his broom. He centers his gravity, but then he does not
Dumbledore’s eyebrows have nearly disappeared under his silly hat, and he gestures down the hall in the direction of his office. “After you, gentleman.”
Draco’s shoulders loosen, like he was afraid that Harry would tell him no, that he wouldn’t let him help.
He looks to Pansy, who frowns, looking down at the several feet of parchment and her very small handwriting. “We can get the first layer done today if you’re not a bitch about it. This isn’t healing, it’s not like you have to worry about overlayering them.”
Harry looks nervous at the front, with what amounts to a good quarter of the school of looking at him. Then he seems find his resolve. He stops rubbing the back of his neck and stands a little straighter. Draco can only assume he’s reminded himself that compared to fighting off Voldemort and his Death Eaters while being tied to a gravestone, this is nothing.
Not even a little bit, why would he subject himself to that? “She’s here because of the ministry, and she’s going to cause problems.” He doesn’t have to pay attention to figure that out. Draco had already told him that Fudge had overruled the Board of Governors on her appointment, and Ron had kept up a string of uncomplimentary things about her during the train ride that Harry’s pretty sure he heard from Percy. Plus, Hermione
He expects an argument, something about him being a deceitful slimy Slytherin, even with the rumor mill working overtime to inform the whole school of his midnight exploits. Which, actually, it’s three in morning, what the hell is everyone doing up and walking around? They’re all breaking curfew, and Filch is nowhere to be found.
“I will,” he promises. Cedric edges around Persenet, like he’s still not sure that she won’t take a bite out of him. “Thank you for your help.”
“I’m pretty sure there’s some sort of herbology project I’ve been supposed to be doing, but at this point it’s too late if there is one, so I haven’t even bothered asking,” Harry says. “Moody is a pretty good teacher, but he’s got nothing on you, and I still want to hex his face off, so.”
“I’ll show you when you get back,” he says. “It’s not going to go any faster with you watching me, and I know you worked through lunch yesterday. There are laws against that you know.”
Snape might have a point. The ability to use wandless magic with anything more complicated than first year spells would really come in handy about now.
He nods, really not liking the sound of that. He meets Draco’s eyes, waiting as Tonks counts down, “Three, two… one!”
Ron is still pulling them forward with single-minded determination, doing his best to get them as far from the chaos as possible. “Draco is a pureblood and the son of a Death Eater. They won’t hurt him, but they will hurt us. How do you think Draco will feel if we get hurt because we didn’t listen to him? Do you think he’ll be happy? Do you think he’ll thank us?”
Draco shrugs, “If my options are bending to Dumbledore’s will or burning my hands, well.” Some of his nonchalance peels away, and he adds on, quieter, “Winky didn’t deserve to be punished. She’s a loyal elf. A good elf. If we punish loyal, good elves, then – then the line between what we’re doing now and what it would be unacceptable for us to do gets that much thinner.”
Cedric bites his bottom lip, but says, “Well. I agree that just being able to perform two spells doesn’t mean much, even if they were complicated, but it’s not about what you’ve done. It’s about what you
. There must be some reason they haven’t come for him, but he can’t think of – actually, he can think of one. “Winky,” he says, and the elf steps up next to him. “Did you put a, a cloaking spell of some sort around us?”
“You have your boy to go meet,” she says, but she’s frowning as she looks at her casket. “It’s a bit dark in there, is all. But I’m rather against sky burials, personally, so I’m not sure what I expected,”
“Well, most books about necromancy that you’re able to read weren’t written by necromancers,” he points out. By the look of consternation on her face, he knows that’s something that hadn’t occurred to her before. “Just keep that in mind for a moment. There are different types of magic, right? Healing magic, for example. It’s your magic and the – the shape, like you’d said before, the shape of your magic changes when you cast a healing spell. When you cast any spell, your latent magic has to
“No,” he says, a frown tugging on the corner of his mouth. “They needed bone marrow. The bones are all snapped but still attached and the body isn’t disturbed beyond what whoever did this needed to do to get to the bones. Even if there’s a creature with a taste for marrow, I imagine they would have made a bigger mess of it, and probably eaten some of the rest of him. If it was a creature who attacked just to kill or in self defense, the body wouldn’t look like this. I’m pretty sure it was on purpose.”
“I’m going to get Poppy,” Sprout announces, wringing her hands in a way that sets off alarm bells in Draco’s head before hurrying out the door. She once cheerfully flung both herself and her students head first into a plant monster. She’s not a woman that rattles easily.
Voldemort snarls, reaching into his robe for his wand, but then he seems to realize that it’s no use, that he can’t cast spells like this. “I’m going to slit you open,” he says, but he says it in English, so Harry’s not entirely certain if he’s talking to Arthur or Nagini.
“This is so above my paygrade,” Tonks says, more to herself than anyone else. She summons a patronus, a fluttering little woodpecker, and sends it off with a message requesting backup.
“How did you get here?” He demands, tossing his wand on his bedside table. He then processes the red bow, and the tag it’s tied to.
He doesn’t know where to start with that. That Harry is most certainly an idiot, that the rest of them, as he calls them, are his friends and family, that Draco is
“You have a nearly complete polyjuice potion, and you’re just going to what? Throw it out? Absolutely not. We’ll stick a preservation charm on it and store it away.”
They’re all crowded in Amelia’s office, soon to be Kingsley’s, who’s currently rubbing his forehead. Sophia is with a sleeping Bellatrix, who’s being guarded by a dozen aurors in a high security ward in St. Mungo’s. Draco still hasn’t figured out if they’re pretending that Sophia is one of the aurors guarding her or if the pretense has been dropped completely and he obviously can’t ask.
“Why can’t I pick it up?” Voldemort hisses, yanking Snape’s head upward so he can glare into his eyes. “It has my name, it’s
Quinn is perched on a chair next to his bed, scowling viciously, looking absolutely furious except with the way ze’s fiddling with the edge of Severus’s blanket, which is a clear tell of zir worry. “Sixteen years as a spy and you get caught? Like an amateur? What were you thinking? And you didn’t run! You get caught, you run, what the hell! That’s basic. So you just decide to hang around and wait for them to kill you then, like a genius? Like the literal on paper tested genius that you are? Is that it? I’m writing to the board to revoke your mastery, it was clearly all a mistake, you have hoodwinked and bamboozled all of us!”
His mind wanders back to Moody, and how quick that walk must have been, then he shakes his head. He’s clearly spending too much time around Luna, and it’s making him paranoid, is all.
“I’m sorry,” he says. Dobby freezes, big eyes even wider than normal. “You were the absolute worst house elf that we’ve ever had the misfortune of employing. But it wasn’t right for us to keep hurting you. I wish there had been a way to free you sooner.”
“You can tell us to stuff it,” Padma begins. Harry can only imagine saying that to either of them would end in one of them jamming a wand in his eye socket. “But – would you, maybe, wear Indian robes to the ball? It’s just, people are talking so much about you speaking Parseltongue, and I know you hate the attention you’re getting for all this, and dressing differently than everyone else will only get you
His door swings open. “Tell anyone, and I’ll…” his voice trails off, and Draco raises an eyebrow. He’s a Malfoy. The Worthingtons are pure, and old, and rich. But he’s set to replace his father as patriarch of the Malfoy family, and Cassius is just a cousin to the head of his family. There’s pretty much no threat he could make against Draco that he’d be able to back up.
They both shake their heads, and Draco relaxes a little at their vehemence. “Does this mean we need to start being nice to the Gryffindorks?” Pansy asks.
Harry wakes up Halloween morning intending to go to the ministry of magic for Sirius’s trial. Draco’s coming with him since apparently Narcissa mentioned it vaguely in two of her letters, which means she wants him to be there even though she’s not going to show up herself. That seems like the type of thing she could just say outright, but Harry’s not going to argue against having his boyfriend’s company.
They’re all filing out when Percy walks over and says, “If I do paperwork during the party, that’s fine, right?”
Millie is shaking him, but he can’t even find the energy to try to shrug her off, instead succumbing to the darkness clawing at the edges of his consciousness and letting the rest of his weight fall against his soulmate.
Hermione rolls her eyes, “Draco and I brew a batch of Pepper Up potion once a month, we’ll give you each a vial. And we don’t meet at night
“It’ll be good for you,” she urges. “It’ll help your control, which will make you better at more than just healing. It’ll help your charms and alchemy too. Filius thinks it’s a good idea as well, you can ask him.”
“You’re in the Shadow,” she repeats and he throws up his hands. “Come on. I’m here because you’re here and you used my necklace to do it instead of using my
Ginny starts clapping, Draco raises his mug to him, and Harry tackles his friend, jumping onto his back so he can reach high enough to ruffle his hair. “Ron, that’s great! You’re brilliant at coming up with plays, we’ll definitely win the quidditch cup this year!”
The curse hits his mother directly in the chest, and she falls to her knees. Draco braces himself to hear his mother’s screams, but they don’t come. Narcissa sits on her knees, skirts flung out around her and with her head bowed submissively and her hands still clasped together in front of her, but she doesn’t make a sound. If he looks closely, he can see her shaking, but that’s the only sign of the unforgivable curse piercing her body.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, speaking carefully and slowly, “he’s going to help. His name is … uh, it doesn’t translate to spoken languages well. He likes you.”
“Draco Malfoy,” he says, and his voice sounds silky, like Snape when he’s not yelling. “I’ve heard of you. Interesting boy.”
It changes its attack, and mere minutes later the basilisk shrieks in pain as it’s deadly eyes are pecked out by the wyvern’s talons. Tom’s yelling in anger, but Harry can’t focus on that. He sends the ashwinder to slither across the basilisk, and wherever they touch the basilisk’s tough scales are burned away. It means the smaller snakes that Draco summoned are actually helpful. They can climb onto the basilisk’s back and bite directly into its muscles, and the creature shrieks in pain.
He curses. He should have thought of this first instead of getting distracted. “It’s okay, let it fall, I can hold them off.”
“Brilliant!” she says. “I’ll talk to Cedric and Roger about it, no reason for us all to practice separately this year. It’ll be fun! We can play some games mixing the teams.”
He looks up from his book, locking his eyes with Harry’s mischievous ones. “No,” he says seriously. “I love him very much. He’s beautiful, and kind, and so good to me. No one can compare to him and I’ll never want anyone else.”
Lupin seems – relaxed, around them. It’s not just that they’re outside of a formal classroom setting, because Harry agrees with him, and he’s been hanging out with Lupin outside of the classroom for a while now. He thinks – well, he thinks it’s because they know he’s a werewolf, even if they haven’t brought it up since that first time. But that Lupin could care so much just that they
“Thanks for the protein bars,” he says, “they really helped.” They’d tasted like cardboard, but they were filling, easy to hide, and had actual nutrients, so he supposes their taste is beside the point.
Bill nods. “Even if he hadn’t, Gryffindor’s line has been dead for centuries. But after his death his son refused to give the sword up, and then at one point it went missing, so it’s just been like this ever since. Goblins stopped taking wizard commission once they didn’t get the sword back when it was owed and that’s the end of it. Of course, most wizards don’t recognize that something can be paid for and used by an individual without actually belonging to them, so most of them don’t even acknowledge that the goblins have a reason for all this.”
"You should have been there or you should have sent an owl," Draco said. "It was the polite thing to do after our agreement."
Harry pulls out the piece of parchment that holds his only attempt at poetry and hands it to Ron. Hermione snatches the parchment away and turns back to Harry.
Harry gets his knees under him and lifts Draco's hips higher, changes the angle so that the next time he pushes in, Draco lets out a broken off groan. Draco feels good, their faces close to each other as they move, Draco's hair curling with sweat, his grey eyes half-lidded as he stares at something past Harry's shoulder. He's doing his best to focus because Harry had asked, had whispered, "I want you to watch me." But Harry can see his concentration slipping, the way it does when they get really into it. When Draco lets loose a little and asks Harry for things, listens when Harry moves him around, arranges him how he wants him. So easily compliant, so willing to please.
It's good strong black tea with milk and sugar. The proper way to enjoy tea and when Harry makes a comment about it, Ron agrees.
"You don't have to marry me," he said. "I apologize if I made you feel as though you had no choice in the matter. You always have a choice. As do I."
He could hear the notes of the string quartet coming from the ballroom on the ground floor, the sound of rustling fabric, and the rhythmic click of shoes on polished wooden floors.
"We shouldn't be engaging in such trite and tired filmography," Draco says, as he scans through the titles on Harry's bookcase. "But I suppose, if we must watch something, it's better we go with the enemy we already know."
Draco yawns again and pulls away from Harry. "Merlin, no," he says, leaning against the opposite arm of the sofa and rearranging the blanket. "Can you imagine?"
Harry finds the "volume" button and turns down the sound until he can't hear the music coming from the earbuds anymore. He hands the Shuffle back to Draco, watches how Draco tucks it away as though afraid he'll damage it. When Draco looks at him, Harry's smiling, watching the morning sun, and breathing in the smells of cooking bacon.
"Hm," Elise said, turning pitying eyes on Draco. "It's never a good idea to say yes to someone who will leave you waiting at a ball, dear. Best not to count all your owls before they're delivered."
Harry looked up, his eyes meeting Draco's. "You should call me Harry," he said. "Since we're supposed to be courting."
Harry can see the suspicion in Draco's eyes, the way he starts looking around the room for traps, or worse, surprises. He can almost see the mental list Draco must be making as he goes through all the important dates he might have missed. Harry lets him stew as the host takes their cloaks and leads them to a table. All around them, Harry can hear the usual hushed whispers as he and Draco make their way down the aisle of tables, the floating bulbs moving out of their way as they go.
Everything else was a blur as Draco made it to the front door and out into the first garden section. He inhaled deeply, each breath dragging slowly, rasping against his throat. He tugged at the collar of his dress robes until it loosened enough to give him room to take a breath. He could still hear the music coming from the ballroom so he kept going, down the steps, past a second garden section.
Harry stops but he can tell it's too late because Ron's leaning forward and Hermione looks concerned but curious.
Draco rolled his eyes but the smile at the corner of his mouth was easy to spot. "I don't suppose you've met a Spanish prince on your travels, Potter. I could do with an introduction."
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Are you forgetting lunch with my mother last week? Nothing is ever just dessert."
"It's too bad most of them are either already married or committed," Harry said, following the elegant spread of Draco's fingers. "Things would be much simpler, otherwise."
Draco goes home with him and as they're hanging their cloaks to dry, Harry thinks of the list and says, as casually as he can, "That was fun. We should have lunch with your mother again tomorrow. Your dad too, if he's up for it."
Harry loves the way Draco's fingers dig into his back, the low whine in his throat as Harry moves back and changes the angle again. He loves the way Draco throws his head back, the way he can't seem to get a full breath as Harry speeds up, how he's doing his best to keep his eyes on Harry, how Draco's hands twist in the sheets.
"Why exactly did you do this?" Hermione asks, pointedly ignoring Ron and passing Harry a cup of tea.
Harry looked from the women to Cormac to Draco. He flexed and as he did, he saw Draco's mouth drop open just a bit. Harry did it again, passing off the move as him needing to roll up his sleeves further. He was gratified to see Draco's eyes following the flex of his muscles, how he didn't seem to notice the way he pressed the tip of his tongue to his lip.
Harry let his eyes roam around the room, going from one bejewelled person to the next. He lingered on the long necks and the flattering cuts of dress robes, on the delicate motions of people wandering around the room in groups. He watched the quiet flirtations, the sly exchange of appreciative looks, and the delicate dance between two interested people. He saw a young woman drop her bag, watched the person closest to her stop and bend down to pick it up. There was a moment where the two met each other's eyes, a lingering touch as the young lady got her bag back, and then the smallest brush of hands as they parted ways.
