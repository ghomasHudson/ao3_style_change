He didn't know exactly when, how or why it had happened, but he knew one thing: he was in love with this bloody git.
"How was potions today?", Potter asked. Draco had not the slightest idea why Potter chose this topic, but he joined in.
He knocked on the door to the headmistress's office. "Come in," she called from inside. Harry did as he was told. "Ah, Potter," the headmistress said and after checking her watch, she added, "You're ealy."
"Mister Draco!", another elf said happily and jumped in the chair next to Draco. He laughed as the elf nearly rolled down again.
meet a kind-of-nice Malfoy yesterday, someone he hadn't known before.
"Are you going to eat something else too?", he asked laughing.
Again, Potter pulled his hand away. "No I don't."
Harry shoved him and rolled his eyes. "I won't
Draco nodded understanding. Not so daft these Muggles after all.
"Well, I have to go to class," Malfoy said this morning.
"Headmistress!" She said excitedly, "I am glad you are here."
"I can't believe Goyle is-" Draco said, "He's not."
Malfoy shook his head in disbelief. "I can't believe that it came to this."
There was a long moment of silence when no one really knew what to say. Draco had said everything he needed to say and Harry was really proud of him - so proud he even had tears in his eyes. Hermione was smiling and winked at Harry. Ron showed Harry thumbs-up without Draco noticing it, and Ginny just looked like she'd seen a creature from another world.
He slowly shook his head. "I'm not."
"Every bad thing they did to each other only shows how strong their love for each other was and is, if they can stand here today on their wedding, holding hands and being happy." Theo said with a wide smile.
"What are you doing?" Potter asked, Draco opened his eyes and snapped his head back down so fast that his neck hurt.
"What?" Potter asked oblivious.
"Why exactly are you helping me?" Draco couldn't help but ask Granger.
And then, in the distance, Draco saw a familiar face. Messy dark hair showed up between shoulders of wizards and every second step, the head bopped up and Draco noticed the glasses. He looked at his mother to check if she had seen Potter as well or if this was just Draco imagining things. Narcissa looked in the same direction and the corner of her mouth twitched a bit. Draco furrowed his brow.
Harry heard Ron sitting up and grabbing his wand. Whispering "Lumos", the tip of Ron's wand lit up and Harry could see his face.
"Malfoy, shut up now!" Harry said loudly and Malfoy flinched a bit "If you want to find out what happened last night, you have to work with me together, get it?"
Ginny only nodded wordlessly and turned back to Hermione. Harry helplessly looked at Ron, who shrugged and sighed.
They had to squeeze in Harry's bed, because Harry didn't want Draco to sleep on the floor. Harry didn't sleep with shirts on when he was at home for summer, so he put on his pyjama bottoms and lay down shirtless. Draco came inside Harry's room and was shook. Harry laughed.
"Yeah?"
Then Malfoy started eating his steak again. "You're not vegetarian, are you?" He asked.
He pulled out his mobile phone from his jacket and walked back to the table where he sat down next to Malfoy so they can both look at the phone.
Draco breathed out relieved and stepped in. He grabbed fresh clothes and made his way back to the Room of Requirement.
A minute later, Malfoy opened the door and looked Harry dead in the eye. "What the hell is-" Malfoy started angrily, but couldn't finish the sentence because Harry grabbed Malfoy's waist and pulled him close. Before Malfoy realized what happened, their lips were already touching.
Harry looked around, watched a few healers wandering from one room to another with clipboards in their hands. Some witches and wizards were brought in and some out, some in wheelchairs, some on stretchers and some by foot. One wizard had a horrible rash on his left arm and as he left the room a few minutes later, the rash had already gone back for maybe around fifty percent. After all these years Harry still was amazed by the power the wizarding world had.
"Go." Hermione broke Harry off and pushed him in Malfoy's direction.
"Mhm.", Lovegood said in her dreamy voice.
The two boys nodded and Madame Pince looked at the book in the hands of Hermione.
Seamus rolled his eyes. "You and Malfoy get along pretty well even though you almost murdered each other every time you came too close to each other. And by
"Why did you stuff Harry into the cupboard?", Draco asked. Again, Mr and Mrs Dursley looked at each other.
"Malfoy. Sit." Harry said as he saw how troubled Malfoy looked.
Hermione just laughed and waved off. Harry rolled his eyes and sighed. He felt like he could fall asleep right there and then, but he was going to keep himself awake for Ron and Hermione's sake, even though his eyes were repeatedly falling shut. Hermione shoved the plate with Harry's toast towards him and as he looked up, he saw her begging eyes. He slightly shook his head, but Hermione's gaze remained firm.
"I...", Harry breathed out, "I love you."
Harry sighed again and followed Malfoy back to Narcissa's room. Malfoy didn't even have to say anything, Harry immediately sat back down on the chair and smiled and Malfoy smiled back gratefully. When Malfoy closed the door behind himself Harry pulled out his Quidditch magazine and started to read.
"Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.
"Malfoy doesn't want it," Potter mumbled, "Sirius, I think I don't want to be here anymore."
"And you. You looked hotter than ever.", he said grinning. Draco laughed and kissed him. Potter smiled and blushed heavily.
"Food's ready." Hermione told him.
He rolled around in his bed for a couple of minutes before he got up and put on the shirt he had thrown on the floor earlier. Harry walked downstairs to the living room, where Ron sat and read the Daily Prophet, while the scent of magically cooked dish by Hermione filled the room. Ron smiled as he saw Harry and put down the paper.
He didn't
Harry ran down the stairs, waited and heard Hermione shout at Malfoy, what made him keep running. Since he couldn't stay downstairs in the snow or anywhere else in the castle, Harry disapparated, a thing only he and McGonnagal could do after Dumbledore had died.
"I don't want to talk to anyone else!", he shouted.
Unbothered, she continued to roll croissants. Harry rolled his eyes, but went back to his job of slicing cucumbers.
"Yes. I want to talk to you."
"When? How?" Draco asked.
"Well." Ron said seemingly uncomfortable with the silence, "When did you say your parents invited us?"
"Well I guess she only meant the best for you." Potter said.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry and sat up.
Harry shook his head. "He
want Granger as my girlfriend. No offense, Potter, but she's really not my type and you're really acting crazy right now." Draco said and lay back down. He switched off the light and he heard Potter lay down as well.
?" Ron's voice was getting louder.
"What the-", but Malfoy followed Harry's gaze and realization dawned on him. "Oh." He said, his face getting paler than it already was.
"I tried to be nice because Potter wanted me to. But if you come at me with all of this bullshit, then I just have to say go drown yourself!"
Harry's eyes fell on her Hufflepuff tie and smiled. "What can I do for you, Rose?"
School was over. Lunch had been good, but lonely. When Draco wanted to go to the Great Hall for dinner, he heard Potter talking in the common room. Draco sneaked behind the door and listened.
"He did, but I did too. We both were idiots but we both acted out of the same reason. His father-", Harry's voice broke and he wondered why he couldn't even talk about
"Do you know this place?" Harry asked when he led Malfoy inside.
"You don't even want to say sorry?" Ron asked.
Harry laughed again.
"So, Harry," Mrs Granger said during dinner, "You didn't bring your godson?"
Harry nodded. He was too sleepy and too hungover to argue right now. He didn't even wear a shirt, he noticed as he looked down on himself.
Hermione frowned. "Another best friend?" She asked.
"I've eaten with Malfoy in the kitchens.", Harry answered shortly and drunk from his juice. Hermione and Ron changed a worried look.
And he was right, only Harry felt different. When Ron had found out, Harry was shocked and feared and he didn't know what Draco would say about this.
"Draco, Molly-"
"Is everything alright, dear?" She asked kindly and Harry nodded. As soon as he was sitting down, their food appeared on their plates. Harry's food looked delicious.
"Potter?", Draco asked after a while.
"Mom!", Dudley said loudly and Daco laughed.
It would have been logical to push Potter away and demand an explanation, but Potter's tongue traced Draco's lips, begging for entrance, and Draco couldn't deny the request.
"Yup. Thanks," Draco said and felt the excitement leaving his body again.
Pansy glared at him in shock and Blaise chuckled about her look. Greg and Theo just stared at Potter and looked like they would punch Potter in the face. They reached the doir to Potter's room.
"Well we've been to Hogsmeade a few times and we did our homework together in the Great Hall and stuff. You know, we did all kinds of crap," Blaise told him and suddenly started laughing.
"Can I help you?", an employee asked Draco.
Draco thrusted his hips, letting his cock slide against Potter's, the sweat easing their movements. This was much, much better.
Harry stuck out his tongue and shoved Malfoy towards the mirror. He rolled his eyes, but eventually started. He washed his face and put some kind of cleansing gel on and washed it away again. And peeling, washed away, then moisturizing cream. Malfoy's hair was easily done. He combed it and put a ton of gel in it. Hairspray. Done.
"I am so sorry." Harry laughed.
Hundreds of people sat on silver chairs facing the top of the hall where the teacher's desk usually stood. Instead, there was the podium the headmasters held their speeches on, the groomsmen and maids, Minerva McGonagall and the other groom. Malfoy wore - as Harry had hoped - a black suit and a white tie, the exact opposite of Harry's outfit. He held his father's walking stick in his left hand and smiled. Thousands and thousands of floating candles lit the hall, silver flowers and ornaments were glittering beneath the small windows around the side of the Hall - tiny fairies sat in the flowers. Harry's eye fell on a bunch of red-haired people in the first row as he walked down the aisle with Hagrid by his side. The Weasley's turned around to watch him with big grins on their faces. Dumbledore sat in his portrait at the top of the Hall.
"Good job.", he whispered against Potter's lips and pulled away. Potter smirked.
There was silence between them. Draco could feel it was not a fully comfortable silence after he refused to tell Potter what memory he had chosen. But he couldn't. Not now. It was not the right time to tell him.
"Look. I realized, I never really thanked you for tipping me off about those dragons.", the Hufflepuff said.
Harry folded the map open and searched for Draco. McGonnagal, Nearly Headless Nick, Mister Filch, but no Draco. No where. Harry searched desperately for him, but he wasn't visible anywhere.
On the picture were four men standing. Draco recognised the messed up hair again and suspected it was James. But the others were strangers. One was tall and handsome. He had shoulder-long black hair and dark grey eyes. He held the hand of a smaller boy, a boy with brown hair and brown eyes. This boy had a scarred face, but smiled happily. The fourth boy was the smallest of the four. He had dark brown hair and was a bit specky.
Potter was still here. Draco could feel him. He wasn't leaving. Maybe he didn't want to leave.
"Yes, you've heard right. I wanted to get to know the people you've grown up with and-"
"Hey, won't you join?", he asked, but Hermione only shook her head.
As Harry had promised, he forgot about the fight with Ginny and tried to have a nice day, but something was still not right.
"Draco, don't start with this again. I already told you that I don't want to see him or my aunt or my stupid cousin.", he answered.
"Thank you, Ron.", he said.
"Stop worrying!", he said and rolled his eyes.
Harry was aware that Malfoy was way less drunk than him - he barely drank anything all night - but Harry decided not to mention it.
"Smooth move, Potty. Is that your technique to get me doing it with you on this table?", Draco laughed.
"You alright, Potter?" He asked.
"Well, eventually they will know. I really want to tell my friends. At least Ron and Hermione," Potter said.
Potter mumbled something and opened his eyes slowly. Draco smiled and an irritated look formed in Potter's face.
"The memory I used... father wouldn't like it.", Draco swallowed.
"I understand. It's a no.", Potter nodded.
"Did you just talk about last year?" Draco looked over to Potter's bed.
"Seriously, boy? Every teacher is talking about you two.
"Malfoy, don't you have something to say?" Ron then asked with a serious look on his face.
"You're pretty good with elves, aren't you?", he asked grinning. Potter looked perplexed to see Draco grinning.
He groaned against the mattress. Tomorrow he was going to be alone. All his friends were going home and Harry and Draco were going to stay. And Draco was angry at Harry, even though Harry had no idea why and-
"Weasel!", Draco called and the four Gryffindors turned around to look at him. Draco walked towards them.
"Can't say the same about yours. It's a mess. What do you do with it?", Draco asked and laughed.
"He is not.", as Potter spoke, his voice sounded dangerous.
Draco tried to fight his smile and shoved Potter away. The idiot let himself fall on his bed and switched on the dim light next to it. He watched Draco who took off his watch and put it on the desk.
"Of course, I will!" He said and his face broke into a wide smile.
"I know!" Malfoy shouted even more angry.
Harry nodded and realised that Pansy couldn't see him but before he could answer properly, Malfoy spoke.
Malfoy's lips twitched slightly, what made Harry hope he would get to see an actual smile some day.
Potter moaned.
Wordlessly, Seamus, Ron, Neville and Dean went inside the Hog's Head and came back out with a whole bunch of brooms Harry supposed they have taken them after he, Ron and Hermione had left their home. They each mounted their brooms, Hermione on Ron's, flinging her arms around his waist, Luna doing the same with Neville.
Draco's jaw dropped.
"Mr. Potter continued telling, "If Tom Riddle had been in a magical orphanage where he belonged, he maybe wouldn't have had such anger issues. Maybe he wouldn't have been treated differently or like he was a freak, because he would have been with his kind. I'm not saying that being in this orphanage made Tom Riddle the man he died as. But I am saying that if orphanages have the right money and resources, they can build something great for the children and help them get a bright future. No witch or wizard should grow up thinking there is something wrong with them or not knowing about their powers at all." We were very happy to hear Harry Potter being so kind and open about this topic. He was very nice to interview and he gave us a lot of insight on this new project of his."
"And Ron and Hermione.", Harry repeated annoyed.
"I didn't say that.", he said and Harry laughed.
"Or don't forget someone you
Theo chuckled. "Well if they did, they hid it fucking fantastic. We should tell you about the times and times these two lovebirds weren't so much in love."
"I love y-"
"I'm good at that.", Potter answered.
"Why not?"
Malfoy let out a relieved sigh. "Yeah, I- I don't."
"Do you love him?" Ron repeated plainly.
Draco groaned and rolled his eyes. Speaking of Weasel-
And then, Lucius Malfoy got quiet and a woman spoke, her voice calm.
"Do you want something to eat?" Ron asked, but Harry shook his head.
"Malfoy, can I talk to you for a second?", he asked with a serious look. Draco nodded.
"Make me.", he said.
"So", Hermione broke the silence, "Ron, I thought we could have a nice dinner somewhere tonight."
"Hey." Malfoy said, an awkward smile on his lips.
"Of course you're not.", he said and nodded, "You're my brave little ferret."
"Have you been with him?", Weasley asked. Draco shook his head.
"Malfoy." Harry said suddenly and Draco looked up with curiosity in his eyes, "I want to go downstairs."
"To what?" Potter asked.
"Do you? And why is that?", he asked.
"Well, I hope you are great. And if not great, maybe at least good. I just-"
Now there was no Potter.
"I'm sorry I'm such a bitch," Hermione said and kissed Ron.
Draco shrugged unbothered. "Dunno. Don't care."
had changed. If it was love or plain compassion - Draco didn't know.
"Don't be stupid, she will come back on her hands amd knees. She always does.", Draco said and shrugged.
"Pst, Potter!", Draco whispered more loudly.
"It was really nice talking to you," Harry said before he left.
"I never thought I'd say this", Draco said as they sat in the cozy armchairs and ate dinner, "But this is kind of nice."
.", Lucius said with a nasty undertone on the last word. Narcissa sighed and shook her head. Draco and her knew exactly that it wad useless to argue.
Harry looked at Malfoy with big eyes.
Malfoy slowly moved his head to look at Ron. "Well, Ron," he started.
"You should leave.", Draco said.
"And he barely eats," Hermione said matter-of-factly.
"You can do one.", Malfoy interrupted him and sighed.
Neville clapped his own in front of his mouth. Malfoy's knuckled were swollen and blue. What has he done? He really seemed frustrated about Harry leaving. Right before Neville's eyes, Malfoy stumbled and fell to his knees.
And the two of them left the room. Draco breathed out. He didn't know what to think of that. He just couldn't get himself to spend time together with Potter when other people were watching. Times like this morning or the few evenings they talked were different - no one apart from them had been there and no one could know about this. And Draco could be (almost) himself. He sighed and then made his way into the Hall.
"Without him, your parents would still be alive, just as your godfather.", Draco answered smiling. Potter kissed him and rubbed his watery eyes.
"Yes, and some of the girls think I'm under the influence of the Imperius Curse.", he added.
"Hermione, I'm fine." Potter said.
It was always difficult for him to start this conversation, but someone needs to start. Malfoy shook his head and Harry understood that Malfoy didn't want to talk tonight. He hadn't talked every night when they sat together, sometimes just Harry spoke.
"Malfoy! Open the door!" Harry said loudly and knocked at the door. There was no answer so Harry shouted again.
"Hermione, wait.", he said and looked around. Four younger students walked past them and shot Harry curious looks
"What are you doing here?" he whispered and looked Potter in the eyes.
"Alright. We need to go to class now.", Draco said. Harry looked at him and Ron cleared his throat.
"I didn't," Harry said nodding to himself, "but I was ready to. He
instead of owls. Draco laughed. How ridiculous.
"Come on!" He whispered.
Seamus called for Sam, to help or to admire, Harry didn't know but he appreciated it. Sam came around the corner and drew a sharp breath. He checked Harry out from head to toe, tilted his head and stepped closer.
"You took off my clothes," Potter repeated.
It really helped him when he talked to Potter every night, but now that he and Potter didn't even sleep in the same room, Draco needed his mother.
Harry chuckled.
"Hermione?", he asked loudly as he came in.
Even Hermione was astounded by Ron's idea. Harry nodded approving and smiled. Ron ate his sausage with a satisfied smile, closed his eyes and breathed in the summer air. The back of Harry's head felt hot from the sun when they finished breakfast and levitated the dishes back inside. His eyes needed time to readjust to the darkness inside the house, but not for long.
Potter rolled his eyes and Draco did as he was told. He leaned back at the wall, like Potter wanted him to do.
"I'll embarrass you either way." Harry had answered every time.
"I don't know." Draco said, his voice just as quiet, "I think I just realized."
"I just need to rest for a bit," he said quietly.
"Thank you, Harry.", she said, "And please, call me Narcissa, or I feel so old."
She was
"Yeah, I think Malfoy wears this as a pyjama." Harry said.
Harry and Malfoy looked at each other. Neville was the first one to close his mouth again.
"Is he going to stay at home on bedrest?" Luna asked.
"What about Malfoy?"
Malcolm scoffed and Harry wondered if every Slytherin was born with that. "Do you?"
"Get out of my way," Harry heard Malfoy say on the other side of the door, so he rushed back into bed and coughed. His lungs felt like they were collapsing.
Draco watched with big eyes as Harry pulled out his Gryffindor scarfand threw it towards Malfoy, who smiled brightly.
Harry's happiness from a few seconds before vanished as of it has never even been there in the first place.
Have you already thought about the holidays? What do you want to do when you are here? I thought we might visit the Goyle family and maybe the Parkinsons? Would you like that? Write me back as soon as you can and explain what is going on with Potter.
"You did good." Harry said proudly.
"Yes, you have no permission in here, you're from Slytherin!", a girl said.
Draco looked over to the other table where Potter was seated facing him. Potter caught Draco's eye and smiled again. Draco felt his cheeks heating up.
Harry stuck out his tongue and gave Bond the letter. He told him where to go and let him outside.
"Well, Potter. I guess you did it." She said.
of my shoes are good shoes." Draco said.
"And then came the fight that evening." Harry ended.
What the bloody hell had just happened?
"I'm so sorry, Draco. Your father is shouting and I'm afraid he'll come down here and freak out if I don't come. I'm sorry.", she said apologetic.
"Thanks Luna, that's really nice of you." He meant it.
"So?" Harry asked expectantly, "Do you like it?"
talk to Blaise about it, Pansy wouldn't understand either. To be honest, Draco couldn't fully understand the situation himself. He wondered if Potter talked to someone about all of his feelings.
Over the last few days, Potter has made a lot of attempts to talk to Draco. He wanted to help with Draco's homework, tried talking when they were in bed so Draco couldn't just walk away, he even talked through the door when Draco was taking a shower. He had said he couldn't understand what was going on and he thought they were fine and so on and on. Potter had rambled on for about fifteen minutes until Draco had stepped out of the bathroom and walked past him without a word.
So Draco was accompanied by Longbottom and Weasley on his way down to the Great Hall.
"She was crazy! She hurt Hermione and all of us and you didn't do anything! You didn't have the guts to do anything! They held us here, Luna, Ron and myself!" Harry felt his cheeks heating up and his hands were trembling with fury.
"Good." Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder, "Good."
" was the headline on the title page. Harry had read the article for at least ten times.
"I thought you might like to have it since you're all alone over here sometimes. Smells like me." Harry laughed.
Draco closed his eyes and thought of a hot shower. He heard a
He walked down to Slughorn's classroom and sat down at the table in the very back.
This was going to be the third time Malfoy was over and Harry hoped this would be the first time where there wouldn't be
He swallowed thickly and forced a smile. "Hi."
"What?" Harry asked irritated.
"So?" Potter asked? "What's the reason?"
At first, Harry's wrist was in a strange angle, but then he changed the angle a bit and-wow- it was fitting perfectly in his hand. Draco made a low desperate noise and bloody hell. Harry felt excitement flooding through him. Draco was moaning, his fingers digging into Harry's arm. It was incredible.
but was sure none of the others should or wanted to know.
After dessert Harry and his friends left the restaurant and strolled around Diagon Alley. Ron and Neville kept their promise and politely but firmly stopped every excited witch or wizard running towards Harry. Either way, the group met with Dean, Ginny and Seamus as they walked past a second-hand store. They all wished Harry a happy birthday - Ginny decided to give him a hug instead of an awkward handshake, what made Harry suddenly realize how much had changed. He didn't feel the tickling sensation in his chest when they hugged, his heart didn't rush and he didn't inhale her perfume. He just hugged her and was glad when they separated again. The group made their way further up the Alley until they reached the Hog's Head.
"We love Harry, all of us do. And we haven't seen him as happy as with you in a long time. So many things, you included, made his life miserable. But Harry kept living, put everyone else above himself and sacrificed his happiness. He sacrificed himself just so we could live. You might disagree, you might be sick of hearing this, but Harry is a hero. Ron and I were with him on this horrible journey and we know what he went through. So for us the term
Hermione shook her head. "You've been together for now, what, four months? Don't you think it's time for you to call each other by your first names?"
Draco remembered that he'd told Potter about his mother wanting him to move out, something Draco hadn't told anyone apart from Theo, Blaise and Pansy. Why did Draco tell Potter about that? Why did Draco trust him that much? And why did Potter listen and didn't judge?
"What?"
"How about we leave in half an hour?" Hermione suggested, "Then we could visit a few stores before we go to the Leaky Cauldron."
"Let's get going," Weasley said enthusiastically and everyone followed him.
"Um, Potter?" Draco plucked up the courage and spoke.
"Sit. Have a biscuit," she offered him. Harry sat and had a biscuit.
"Shut up!", he said loudly and turned back to Harry, with a smile, "Common room, probably. Why?"
"Not all Muggles are bad, you know." Potter interjected.
"Alright, alright. Now that he lives here, I have to be nice to him... kind of.", she gave up.
Neville looked between the two of them with a questioning look. Harry shrugged. The door banged open and Malfoy stepped in.
"Where you have to go?" Potter asked.
Harry's shoulders slumped. But the conversation didn't end there yet.
"Mister Draco is alone now here?", a house elf asked. Draco nodded and sat down.
"I already told you that it's not time now.", he said after a while.
"Goodness, Potter keep it to yourself." Draco said annoyed and closed the magazine. He stood up, took his pyjamas and left into the bathroom. Yes, it was Draco's second shower this day but he just couldn't stand being in one room with this git and he needed some distraction.
Harry nodded.
Luckily, Ron and Hermione had been back from Hermione's parents as Harry had gotten home. They had comforted him and Hermione had made them a hot chocolate. Harry hadn't told them a lot about his stay at Malfoy Manor, but about how it had been very nice until their fight. Hermione had conjured Harry's stuff from the Manor to their home and Bond followed not long after.
Draco and Potter looked at each other in shock.
He only heard an annoyed sound by Blaise, but didn't pay attention to him any further. Instead, Draco turned turned to Theo and wished him a happy birthday. Theo grinned annoyingly and thanked Draco.
"Did you just say please?" He said and Draco slapped him.
"What do you mean?", he asked confused. Draco scoffed.
Before one of them could continue the awkward conversation, three elves brought their breakfast.
Just because Madame Pomfrey and literally ever other teacher knew about him and Harry Potter.
Just as he had said it, he realized that it wasn't a good idea. Malfoy glared at him and Harry could see he was ready to burst.
The walking stick fell to the floor with a
"Well then. Let's go eat something. Ron and the others are waiting for us."
Stupid Weaselette. This fucking stupid girl! Draco hated her. He loathed her. He stood up and looked at the big wooden clock on the wall.
"You people are quite alright." As soon as Draco had said it, he clapped a hand in front of his mouth.
"Great idea.", Malfoy smiled. But something was still not clear.
"I don't know... Maybe you told Ron so they would break up and you could be there for Hermione and comfort her and then eventually get her as your girlfriend."
"Thanks.", Harry said smiling.
They both moaned louder as they felt each others erection pressing into their own, their breathing speed up and body heat engulfing them.
is your room?", Draco asked as Harry led him upstairs.
Draco laughed a bit. "A little overprotective, isn't she?"
Weeks passed.
"You didn't ruin it! As long as you are here.", Harry said.
"My owl."
Harry smiled. He knew Malfoy didn't mean what he had said. Harry knew Malfoy didn't hate him. Not anymore.
"The kiss," Draco said quietly even though no one was there to hear them.
This was so embarrassing. Harry looked at Malfoy, who nodded enthusiastically. Harry had never seen him like this - like no one around him would matter. And so Harry started to dance as well. They weren't good dancers, but it was a lot of fun. Harry forgot how many people were looking at him, he just kept his eyes on Malfoy.
Harry and Ron looked at each other with red cheeks and McGonagall  pulled them to their feet. The students wouldn't stop clapping until Harry was shoved forward by Professor McGonagall and she glared at him to hold a speech. Harry felt nervous when he saw hundreds of faces looking up at him expectantly. He focused his gaze on Hermione, who grinned up excitedly, and took a deep breath.
Draco looked at Harry. His eyes were wet and to see Draco like this, no matter how much it would have satisfied Harry a year ago, hurt Harry. He'd rather fight the dragon again, instead of seeing Draco crying.
Harry and Ron looked at each other.
Draco stopped and turned around.
"Wow," Malfoy said, "This is the jacket."
"What can I do for you, Malcolm?" He asked smiling.
Draco sat down next to Harry.
"Good morning mother." Draco said with such surprise in his voice that Harry had to grin.
"Yeah, but I have
"Goodnight, scarhead.", he said smiling.
Draco nodded. "Sure I know Fred."
And now, Harry heard it too. Voices.
"Thank you too, Mr Malfoy."
They lay in bed, it was late at night. Draco was more satisfied with himself than he had been in a long time.
Draco felt tears shooting up in his eyes. What was going on? Why was he such a crybaby? Potter noticed and lifted his shirt, revealing his muscular body and another big scar on his stomach.
"Us at a party, going outside, standing in the cold, you smoking, me watching and thinking you are the most beautiful human being I have ever seen in my entire life..."
Stepping inside, Hary felt his chest tighten. The room was exactly as he remembered it - the ceilings higher than anywhere else in the Manor, the giant chandeliers, one of which Dobby had destroyed just a few months before. The same faces looked at Harry from the portraits on the dark purple walls, but Harry's eyes fell on a portrait that hadn't been there the last time - Lucius Malfoy. And then Harry felt like he was going to faint. The stairs to the cellar beneath the room were clearly visible now. Harry heard Draco stepping next to him and wasn't sure what to do. His whole body froze as he felt Draco putting his hand on his shoulder and something inside Harry snapped. He stepped away, squirming at the touch. Malfoy's face was confused at first, but then hardened.
It was stuffed in the bag for the whole day, but Draco couldn't stuff it in the back of his mind. He couldn't shake the thought of what his parents would think or do. There was a good reason he hadn't told them about Potter. In every letter Draco had written, he had never mentioned Potter's name just once and he had kept the subject strictly on schoolwork. But now, Draco was afraid, it was over. Now his parents knew they were getting along and Draco would have to tell them and they would freak out and lock him in his room for the entire Christmas holidays.
With that he walked towards the bar. Harry watched Malfoy ordering something and ignoring everyone else around him. Suddenly Ginny appeared next to Harry. She must have been watching him. Harry shortly turned to look at her, then watched Malfoy again.
Draco closed the door and lay back down next to Harry, who pretended to be asleep. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, pulling him into a warm embrace. Harry smiled and snuggled up closer.
"Well, Harry
- stopped in mid-air to greet Harry and Ron.
"What are they going to do with the tower after we graduate?" Hermione asked interested.
Malfoy took his hand away and looked at the clear, dark water of the lake. Harry could only imagine what Mr Malfoy would say to that, but he needed to know.
But every time Harry had talked to Malfoy about his worries, Malfoy had just said that Harry should be patient.
"Oh, my Dudders, did he do something to you?", Petunia asked and hugged her son quickly. He shook his head.
"Gee, Potter! What are you doing?"
"Wait, no, I wanted to ask you something."
"What you ask for, Potty?", he asked and kissed Harry back.
"Yeah, right. I'm such am idiot. I totally forgot. Do you care if we join you?", she asked in a fake friendly tone and put on a fake plastic smile.
"There's been a fucking war, Ginny!", Harry said loudly.
A woman had appeared from behind a heavy dark red curtain. She had red hair, several needle-like things in her lip and one in her nose and holes in her ears. Theo looked at Draco with big eyes.
"Ah, Potter. Sit down, sit down." Harry nodded firmly and say down on the chair. The professor sat down on the chair on the other side of her desk.
Draco's head hurt so much. His ears were ringing and his stomach felt sick. When he opened his eyes, the sun was so bright his eyes started watering immediately. He closed them again and rubbed the tears away, then opened again. An empty bottle of fire whiskey stood on his bedside table. Draco sat up and felt like he had to vomit. His eyes fell on two boys lying in Potter's bed. Before Draco could say anything, he felt-
Draco hated it to be alone. Potter was right, Draco really had no one. His friends were not on his school anymore, his mother was at home, his father... Draco didn't even want to
"My grandma made mine. They arrived yesterday.", Neville said with a proud look on his face.
"Yeah, okay, you were a bit.", Potter smiled and Draco kissed him again.
"Go."
Draco nodded slowly. "We called a truce."
"Why are you going this early?" Malfoy finally asked.
Harry helped Hermione prepare snacks for tonight. When she rolled up the dough for croissants, Harry noticed her hands were shaking. He furrowed his brow.
After Harry stopped, he felt tired. It was already dark outside and snow was falling.
"Sorry.", he said. Draco laughed.
Harry watched him lay down and pull the blanket up to his chest. He sighed.
They all gathered around the table as Mrs Weasley and Ginny levitated the food and placed it in the centre of the table. Hungry silence filled the room when everyone started to eat and Harry took the time to look around. Everyone was putting on happy faces, but he was almost one hundred percent sure none of them were as happy as they pretended, not even Harry himself. They all had their demons that visited them at night, if it was the corpse of their family member or of their loved one, or if it was a Death Eater or if it was - as in Harry's case - Voldemort.
"Draco, it's almost two hours later. If you don't do it now, don't do it at all." Theo said.
Harry excused them and looked for an empty spot. At the drinks buffet, they found it and while Harry poured themselves a glass of wine, Theo's face turned from friendly to... well Slytherin-y.
They wanted the teams to be fair, so Ron was in a team with Angelina and Charlie, and in Harry's team were Ginny and Fred. Hermione, Bill and Fleur sat down on a bench and watched them soaring through the air. Harry smiled. He had forgotten how much he had missed Quidditch, but now he was here he never wanted to forget again.
He sighed and walked over to the greenhouses, where Ron and Hermione already waited.
"And I will never be grandmother.", Narcissa agreed.
"You seriously ask what I mean? Come on, as if you don't know.", he stood up angrily and three the book onto the desk. Harry watched Draco.
"Of course I do!"
"I'll call you Potter til I die.", he smiled. Potter raised his eyebrows.
Draco pushed himself past the students and made room for Potter and his friends.
"Look, I know that Potter tells you stuff and I know you know about the fight we had, but I want you to know that's not who I am. I don't want you to be worried."
"Draco.", he breathed. Draco stepped closer to him and kissed him.
"I'm sorry about last night. I was a drunken idiot and I shouldn't have behaved like that." Draco said while he played with Teddy's small hand.
Harry smiled. "I don't."
"Oh, good morning kids."
"What are you going to do now?", she asked.
"If he should come in your room-", he said.
"It was bad, really bad," Draco said the last sentence of his thoughts out loud while he sat down on his bed and Potter closed the door.
"Look, that's what I don't understand. Why don't you call each other by your first names?"
When he finished, Draco threw his clothes into the self-emptying bin and left the bathroom with his wand in his hand. He hurried to his room where he put on some fresh clothes and then went onto the balcony.
"What?"
"Why don't you come over tomorrow?"
"Um, Draco... I have to- to show you something.", he stammered, "Upstairs."
"Then I wish you good luck and if anything happens, come to me immediately," Pomfrey said.
"Mate.", Weasley said smiling and clapped Potter on his shoulder.
Potter steered right towards them and just when he reached them, he opened his arms and hugged Draco's mother. He gave her a quick kiss on every cheek and then let her go.
The raindrops slowly rolled down Harry's face, but he didn't care. He also didn't care that his socks were soaked or that his shirt was wet too. All Harry cared about right now was Malfoy. They stood in the garden for what must have been fifteen minutes, holding hands and not saying a word, just enjoying the moment with closed eyes. Every now and then Harry opened his eyes to peek at Malfoy, who had a smile on his lips and Harry had to smile even more.
Malfoy's eyes were unfocused and even redder than they have been before. Harry couldn't imagine Malfoy crying so much that his eyes were puffy and red, but here he sat looking just like he did.
It was the first time he wasn't looked at like he was scum. He wasn't reminded of his horrible time as a Death Eater and they didn't care if the Chosen one was fucking a servant of You-Know-Who. They just nodded silently and looked as horrified as they had before.
Draco was a mess. He was woken up by his stupid boyfriend at eight in the morning and punched him with a pillow.
"Master.", he said, bowed at Potter and left quickly
"Potter!" Malfoy shouted from the corridor.
"I am very sorry I haven't mentioned Potter before. I was just so unsure of what you might think. To be truly honest, I think I really am in love with him."
are Slytherins." Blaise corrected and Draco nodded.
"A Guinness and-" Harry looked at Malfoy.
about that.
Harry wondered what secret he could have revealed and read:
Harry didn't even look up. He was used to girls greeting him.
"Hey.", Harry said and tried to smile, but it was kind of hard.
"But first if we but a new table.", Draco laughed and kissed Potter. How could he ever say No to this cute boy? Potter smiled.
"Look," Malfoy said, "Thanks for not being a complete jerk to me."
He needed Madame Pomfrey! Draco took out his wand with a shaking hand and conjured Potter into the air. Next to him, Draco walked up to the hospital wing.
"Potter.", Draco said after a while.
"An owl?" Draco repeated and feared the worst.
"From where did you know that I-" Draco already knew what Potter was going to say and he shrugged.
to be in the one store Harry Potter was as well. He felt like a coward running from him and hiding behind shelves, but Draco didn't want to see him and he most certainly didn't want to talk to him.
"Malfoy, take the stage," Weasley said.
As soon as Harry heard what he had said, he cleared his perfectly empty throat and corrected himself: "I mean to us."
Draco shrugged. "I don't know," he answered and bit his lip unsure, but stopped as Potter's eyes watched his lips carefully.
Harry smiled softly and nodded. "Of course it's alright."
"I'm taking a shower.", he said and closed the bathroom door.
Harry heard Hermione chuckle in the kitchen. He smiled at Malfoy and shrugged. When they heard the shower upstairs being turned on, Harry got up to help Hermione prepare a little breakfast. Malfoy didn't move for a while and Harry supposed he just didn't know if he was allowed to.
"You are!"
"Draco," Blaise said surprised, "Can I help you?"
"I had no breakfast.", Draco added.
"I can't protect myself from everyone in this school. I'm a Slytherin, I have Slytherin pride, but I don't aspire being even more hated than I have been already in the years before."
<"Oh, bloody hell!" Ron said disgusted and walked away.
"It was not a compliment.", said Draco, but laughed too.
"Don't worry about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.", Harry answered and took another attempt to leave, but Cedric kept talking.
He finally nodded slowly. "I do."
"Come in," Harry said quietly.
Draco's hands tightened around his wrists and Harry gasped a little, his hips twitching, making him jump up slightly on Draco's lap. Liking the feeling, Harry did it again, rolling his hips and squirming, amused by Draco's surprised little gasps.
He nodded to himself and rubbed his eyes. Harry grabbed a tray and put the hot water, milk, cups and tea on it. Without any effort he grabbed his wand, that lay on the kitchen table, and levitated the tray out on the terrace.
"I'm really happy for you and Neville. You make quite a charming couple," Harry smiled and Luna's face lit up.
"I did." He said, "And I need an owl to write back."
"Bye, Greg.", Draco smiled.
falling in love.
"What's football?", he asked quietly. The man laughed.
Harry didn't want to see or hear Draco and his father arguing, but if he would go between them, one of the three would get hurt.
"I think you don't have to figure it out.", he said friendly, "Maybe you could tell me what's going on inside
look healthy.
"I'm sure. You're doing the right thing."
"Suits you." Harry said trying to cheer Malfoy up, "Smoking and drinking whisky."
Harry watched him look around the house. Only a year ago Malfoy would have despised everything in here, including the people. But now he looked genuinely happy. Mrs Weasley came back into the room with several floating cups of tea. They all thanked her and took each a cup. Harry really loved Christmas.
"Why do you have to be like this, Malfoy?", Ron asked annoyed and Malfoy sneered in reply.
"Fine.", he said.
"Father was sent to Azkaban." Draco said quietly.
"For not making you feel special."
Ron and Harry only nodded courtly and when she turned her back on them, they rolled their eyes and snickered. Inside the bookstore it was even hotter than outside. Ron immediately started whining and said he wanted to get back outside, or at least somewhere it wasn't 50 degrees.
"No. Lie down. You need to rest until you can leave.", he said seriously.
The elf nodded and tapsed away. Draco smiled with sad eyes.
"Hey, what's going on?", Harry asked.
of Malfoy and got a hard-on. That was really unbelievable. Wouldn't Malfoy be such a prick, Harry would maybe understand it, but Malfoy is...
"What happened to the old one?", Ron asked. Draco and Harry looked at each other.
"He won't kill you.", he said.
"Let me sleep.", Harry answered and lay his finger on Draco's lips.
"Thanks.", Potter said. Draco smiled.
"I think Harry did a really good job too." She said.
"You know, we never do something together. Just us two," she said as they searched for another book Harry wanted.
"Yeah right." He shouted back.
Draco hadn't visited Harry until the weekend came around and with it the sun came back out. Harry was glad to see that Malfoy still showed up happily. They spent the weekend together with Ron and Teddy and even though Malfoy didn't like children, he made a real effort to get along with Harry's godson.
So Harry thought he would start with a casual opening. "You won't believe it," he said to get Ron's attention, "I'm with Malfoy."
Malfoy shortly hesitated, then got up and sat down next to Harry on the couch. "I'm sorry I wrote this to my father. I just figured since he is.. you know... I might as well tell him what he wants to hear," Malfoy said.
"I did not!" Draco exclaimed.
They strolled around the Christmas market. Ron and Hermione were holding hands, while Harry and Draco walked next to them, keeping a safe distance to each other.
He got dressed with an unimpressed flick of his wand. Harry was not motivated today. He shuffled out and up to the headmistress' office.
Ron got up. "I made tea." He said on his way to the kitchen.
Potter smiled.
"He's not my lover.", Harry said annoyed.
"Hey, Harry.", Luna said with her dreamy voice. Harry smiled at her.
After dinner, Malfoy even whipped his wand to put the pizza boxes into the trash. He and Harry went upstairs and got to bed, so did Ron. He was still a little uncomfortable with the situation, but Harry was glad he did everything to hide it and keep a smile on his face.
Draco laughed. This was ridiculous. This little
Harry had tried to calm him down for almost ten minutes now, but he wouldn't listen. "Ron, do you really believe what
"But Sir, where is Mister Harry Potter?", asked an elf worried.
"I see.", he said after a while of uncomfortable silence. Harry shifted in his seat.
He attached his note to the foot of the bird and it flew away just seconds later. Harry watched it disappear into the clouds.
"Yeah, that's the Black lake.", Ron repeated for the thousandth time.
They ate silent, no one spoke. Harry and Draco held hands under the table. It gave Harry a comforting feeling and he knew it helped Draco very much as well.
"I'm sorry, Professor, but I completely lost track of time.", Harry said. Slughorn smiled.
"It's because you're just not as good as I am."
"Have you been drinking?" He asked.
Draco took a breath, and then he surged forward and swiped his tongue into Potter's mouth, curling his hand around the back of Potter's neck, into his hair. Draco felt heat shooting through his body like ink through water. Potter grabbed him by the shirt and grunted softly, and the sound ached in him, squeezing him simultaneously in the chest and the groin.
"Why should I, boy?", Harry's uncle asked sneering.
"Sure, why not." Harry said, shortly looking up at Hermione, then concentrating on the game again.
"I'm not going to grovel. But I want you."
"So, Potter.", she said and placed both, the bottle and the wand, on the bedside table.
"You have something left?" Draco asked, pointing at the teapot.
"And I'm really sorry if I annoy you, but it's true.", Potter added and sounded shy now.
Putting his bag away, Mr Weasley sat down next to Bill and took off his shoes, then put his feet up in the sofa table.
Draco nodded. "He really wanted me to apologize!"
They sat there on the couch for a while. Through the tilted window you could hear the sound of the wind rushing through the trees outside. The singing of the birds was more quiet now, but still hasn't stopped completely. When Harry was almost falling asleep as well, Malfoy's arm brushed against Harry's, what made Harry's heart beat faster and he suddenly imagined what could be. That they could be actual friends. Or maybe even more... if Harry could actually admit that he would want that. Before Harry could finish that thought, he felt sleep washing over him.
"Ron told me he wishes to spend more time with you and he's really sad that you vanish all the time. He's not even mad at you. He's mad at himself. He just wants you two to do more together. He also said he trusts you with his life and he would never let anyone steal you from him because you're his girl and he loves you," Harry answered.
Harry smiled tiredly as Hermione sat down between them. Crookshanks jumped into her lap and purred. The rest of the day looked pretty much just like this. They all took turns falling asleep again and taking a shower, in the evening they ate only salad because none of them imagined their stomach would hold anything else. Around eight o'clock the three of them dragged their heavy bodies upstairs and went to bed. Harry immediately fell asleep, he hadn't even turned off the lights as he found out the next morning.
He turned sharply as an owl screeched and Draco opened the window. The owl jumped in and held out its leg, so Draco could take the letter.
"Because-" Draco swallowed and tried not to look at Potter "Because all of this is wrong. It's not right. Yeah, I know that's what wrong means. This is not how this year was supposed to be like. You should go out with your friends and make out with Weaselette and we should shout at each other again and I should be alone again and everything should stay as it was."
"Oh, I will, but you might moan a little.", Harry said.
Draco stood up.
"What are you doing?", he asked and watched Harry walking over to his bedside table, from where he took out his wand.
Draco loved this article the most, because he knew this was the real Potter. It wasn't about the
girl, in fact."
a long time ago, it was this year."
Hermione said they had no milk left at home so Harry agreed to look for it. He looked around the store while walking over to the milk fridge and froze as he spotted a familiar figure.
Seamus came over the next day on December first, with only two days left for the party. His flawless outfit made Harry confident in his choice of company, though Ron wanted to come as well. The three of them knew a lot about Muggles and their stores - Harry being raised by them, Seamus having a Muggle dad and Ron having a father who was very interested in them. Therefore they had no problem finding the stores Harry wanted to go to in the centre of London. Harry knew if he wanted to impress Malfoy and his friends, he had to go all out. Fist stop: Louis Vuitton.
Malfoy shook his head. "Not really, why?"
"Malfoy.", Harry said and nodded. Draco nodded too.
"I know.", he said, "And I'm sorry."
They both moaned as they felt their hardening lengths through the fabric of their pyjamas.
"Malfoy", Harry started and Malfoy groaned, "How come you and Ron were so civil to each other today?"
Harry put Teddy back in his crib and sat back down on the bed. "They know. But they also know what happened yesterday."
They had reached the common room. The floor was covered with a carpet that showed the blazon of Hogwarts. Some pictures were hanging on the walls, but there were mostly empty frames for pictures the students themselves wanted to hang up from their time at Hogwarts so that the common room was getting filled with their own memories. Harry loved the idea a lot.
Harry smiled.
"Stop laughing and look at that.", Malfoy said.
Harry and Ginny were separated on their way to Hogsmeade by three happy couples- Ron and Hermione, Harry's two best friends and Ginny's brother; Neville and Luna, Ginny's two best friends; and Dean and Seamus, Ginny's ex-boyfriend and the weird irish guy.
"It may seem to you that just because I had a few partners before you, you're not special to me," Harry said.
"Oh, will you make me one too?" Harry heard Hermione ask from the terrace.
Harry stared at him. What did just happen? Did Malfoy just greet Harry?
, so Luna and Teddy went on and the two boys would catch up.
"Yes you do", Draco nodded, "Your hands are hot, your eyes are glowing, you are constantly licking your lips and won't stop looking at mine."
He didn't look up instead he bent forward and reached out with his tongue, licking off a single bead of salty fluid that clung to the tip of Draco's cock.
"Do you want to drink something? Tea? Water?" Granger offered, but Draco shook his head.
Waking up the next morning, Harry felt a little dizzy. He put on his glasses and looked around. The window in his room was opened and Harry started to shiver as a cold wind blew inside. He got up, closed the window and shuffled downstairs. Neither Hermione nor Ron were awake yet, at least they weren't downstairs. The last night seemed like a blur to Harry. Judging by the throbbing pain in his head he must have had quite a bit too much to drink. Harry made himself some tea and sat down on the couch. Crookshanks curled himself up next to Harry, who closed his eyes again for a bit until he heard Ron coming downstairs.
"Well she must think the best of you right now." Ron said sarcastically and Hermione hit him.
Just as he had said it, Pomfrey came around the curtain. "Good, you are here," she said and didn't give anything away that Draco had left only a few hours ago. "So, you're his roommate?" She asked Draco directly and he nodded, "Fine. Then I have to take you with me to talk about a few things."
"Could it be possible that you're under the influence of a spell or something?", Hermione suggested and Harry shook his head.
"Draco.", he whispered. Draco looked at him and suddenly, Harry saw fear in his eyes.
Draco fell down next to Harry. They both were breathless. Harry's heart was pounding so fast, as though it wanted to escape his chest.
Harry chuckled. "Don't freak out. I didn't suggest it, I was just surprised."
He heard his roommate getting up and opening his own suitcase. Then, Potter passed him barefoot and closed the bathroom door. A minute later, he came back out, wearing a horrible red sweater and blue jeans.
"What about her?", Seamus asked and slid next to Harry, Dean sitting down on the other side of Seamus.
Draco was so obsessed with the article that he didn't even realise class had already started. He decided it would be time to concentrate on something else,
Harry, Ron and Hermione sat in the Three Broomsticks and enjoyed their butterbeer.
Seconds later, the door was opened again and they walked past Ron's room. Percy stuck his head inside.
"You know what's funny?", Malfoy asked and Harry shook his head, "I wouldn't care if he killed me, but he would rather kill you. And that's what I couldn't stand."
"I- Excuse me." Harry said and stood up.
"Why are you already awake?"
"Shit! Could you tell Slughorn that I'm late? I need to shower and-"
He hated to see Potter like this, all sad and angry and poking into his bread with his finger.
"Hey. Look at me.", said Draco softly and Harry did so.
Draco felt awful. He didn't want it to sound like he
Mrs Weasley laughed and went back to the stove. As usual, Harry and Ron had to set the table, but this time they had help from Malfoy. All thirteen of them gathered around the large table and started to eat. The boys pulled a few crackers during lunch, until Mrs Weasley whipped her wand and banned them from the table. Harry laughed. After lunch, Hermione took Harry upstairs because she wanted to show him something. Harry looked at Ron, but he only shrugged.
"You made quite a scene down there," Potter said anyway.
"Hey.", he said calmly, "Everything will be alright."
"Well, okay.", Zabini said.
"Your-"
"Where
He and Ron walked through the store and then Harry found a pullover he hadn't seen before. Just when Harry turned around to show it to Ron, Ron grabbed a coat Harry immediately loved.
"Ron won't be down here for a while, but Hermione must get back soon. It's completely your choice if you want to be here when she does or if you want to leave." Harry said and Malfoy nodded uncertainly, his eyes still averted.
"Didn't you have the day off today?"
"Why?"
"Ron, Malfoy's awake, I'll call you back." Harry said quickly.
Harry watched Theo join the others and his eyes suddenly fell on Draco. He was talking to Ron, who wore the same look Theo had had mere seconds ago. Harry grinned. Draco was getting the same talk as he was. After watching a nice handshake between Ron and Draco, Harry walked over to them, but Ron left and made his way to the stage. Theo made his way up there as well.
"I like it when you're smiling," Potter said and traced his finger over Draco's lips. Draco flinched by the touch and pushed his head into the pillow.
"I won't go in there.", answered Draco, shaking his head, "No chance."
After lunch, Harry and Draco met in the Entrance Hall. Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle and Zabini behind Draco and Hermione, Ron, Neville, Dean, Seamus and Ginny behind Harry. As Parkinson spotted Harry, she clutched Draco's arm, but he shook her off.
"He told his father he hated me as much as ever and he couldn't get me out of his way and McGonnagal could never live up to Snape because there is no one greater than a Slytherin and he fired the spell at me that got me in the hospital," Harry said quickly and sobbed and cried.
When she saw Harry, Ron and Hermione standing there, she stopped and looked at them.
"Potter, look at me."
Malfoy rolled his eyes and decided they should eat. He had brought fruit and vegetables and a single piece of bread for Harry. Harry missed the good food - pudding and chicken and everything not vegetable-y. But doing Malfoy - and perhaps himself - a favor, Harry ate the carrots and apples and everything else. He couldn't get the enchanted bedside table out of his mind. What was Malfoy hiding? And why didn't he just put it where the box was and Harry could never find it? Harry thought about asking Malfoy about the box, but he decided it would only annoy Malfoy.
Harry laughed.
"I don't care. I'm in the middle of something and I don't need to be concerned with your bullshit right now."
"Thanks for inviting me." Malfoy replied with a half-smile.
He put out his cigarette, grabbed the walking stick with one hand and Harry's hand with the other. "Come on."
He noticed Malfoy walking in. Unlike the weeks before, Malfoy's hair was neatly done and as shining as ever, he wore his black Slytherin robe and a silver watch shone on his wrist. Harry felt like he was drooling, so he stopped looking. But then, just as his eyes left Malfoy, he saw that the blonde had turned his head. Now they were staring at each other from across the Hall. Harry felt his cheeks getting hot, so he looked at his plate and tried to cool off.
"Shut your mouth, I didn't talk to you.", uncle Vernon said angrily, but he shouldn't have.
Draco rolled his eyes.
During the whole train ride, many students passed their compartment and peeked inside, some opened the door and asked for an autograph from Harry and some just stood there and watched him like he was some kind of animal in a zoo, until Hermione told them more or less politely to leave him alone. Harry slept most of the time because he had to catch up the sleep he didn't get last night. He had some crazy dreams. One was about Malfoy running across the school yard to Harry and Harry flinched because he thought Malfoy was going to hex him, but Malfoy only shook hands with Harry. One was about Ron throwing things against a wall and Hermione sat next to him on a chair and levitated all the things and carefully placed them on the floor. Weird dreams.
"Missing you, but fine." Ron answered, "Luna ist still here what seems to cheer him up a little."
"Do you want to paint the walls in some rooms?", he asked and Draco looked at him.
"Draco!", Theodore said loudly.
"Malfoy?", he asked after a while.
Potter slammed the door behind him and Draco was alone again.
"Thanks," Harry said perplexed.
Four weeks later, they had finished their exams and the holidays had begun.
There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainty, and looked around - there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate:
"It's a good thing you're doing, Harry." Dumbledore said with a proud look on his face, "I'm happy to see you use your fame and experience for good."
"Where's father?", he asked Narcissa and stood next to Potter.
"How's it going?", he asked.
"No need to put it in at once. You can use your hand too, if you want to."
Harry shrugged. "Well yeah. I mean it was really nice with you the last few times we met."
"Night mate.", Weasel said to Potter and left with the others. Now
"Everything that makes you happy is good, Harry.", she said and tried to smile.
Harry opened the box and held his breath. "Wow," he breathed out.
"Now we change shifting anyway.", Harry said.
"Not much, I still remember this." Harry answered "You were standing at the bar, a drink in your hand and you were looking so elegant and your eyes darted from one face to another."
"No promises, Potter.", Draco said and Potter laughed.
Ron spat out his tea. "You did
and Harry thought this was perfect for three Gryffindors to watch.
"Do you remember anything?" Longbottom asked more compassionate.
"Too bad. I'm comfortable.", Potter shrugged.
"Are you drooling, Potter?" Draco smirked.
"Why do you tell me about it," Sirius suggested and hugged Harry.
"No. I mean, maybe..."
"Shut up, Weasel.", Draco said.
"I'm sorry" Malfoy whispered.
"I know, right!" None other than Draco Malfoy said and caught for air, "He looked like he was going to drop dead!"
"Thanks.", Malfoy said. Harry smiled astonished and surprised and left.
"Don't make me repeat it, idiot."
"Last year in the Room of Requirement. When I saved you," Potter told him.
"What?" He snapped.
Harry laughed. He needed to think of
Draco rolled his eyes and grunted annoyed. "What are you making?"
Narcissa hated him and he wasn't so fond of her either, so Harry too thought it would be best if he didn't enter the room. Malfoy grabbed the door handle, pushed it down and opened the door. Harry peeked inside and saw Narcissa lying in the hospital bed, her eyes closed and her chest rising and falling beneath the light blanket on her stiff body. Malfoy closed the door behind himself.
The following silence surprised Harry. He stood there, not able to move and looked at the others on the other side of the bonfire, smiling. Then, he heard footsteps behind him and turned around. His breath got stuck in his throat.
"Good." Weasley said more relaxed now, "It's good for me to know that."
"Yes, Draco, finish him. We'll wait outside.", Nott said.
"What? The Mud-", but Draco cut himself off, "
"I, er... kept bumping into it.", Harry lied quickly.
"As a matter of fact, I do. You might not believe it, but I was hated too, you know? By the whole school, and not only the Slytherins. In my second year everyone assumed I was the heir of Slytherin and went around petrifying people."
them.
"Dad!", Draco said.
"You're freaking me out," Potter said laughing.
"Come on, love, let's go downstairs." Angelina said, "It's Christmas."
After they had finished their drinks, Harry paid the waitress and they went outside. The street lights illuminated the empty streets and Malfoy's pale skin and silver hair shone.
Indeed, he and Draco had already talked about this. Draco hated his home. There were so many childhood memories he just wanted to forget but to keep living in this house wouldn't accelerate that.
Harry smiled and stood up. He pulled an MP3 player from the pocket of his jeans and searched a good song from Elvis Presley. "Jailhouse Rock" started playing.
Harry nodded approving. "Sounds good."
"Then why did you move out?" Harry asked, trying to take advantage of the good mood.
With that, Malfoy turned around, grabbed his mother's wrist and disapparated before she could complain any more. Harry laughed and disapparated himself. After a few seconds he stood in front of his house - Grimmauld Place Number 12. He opened the door and immediately started to smile. From the living room he could hear Teddy's babbling and Hermione talking with her baby-voice. Harry loved it to come home to this. It was nice to fill this house that had so many dark memories with new and beautiful ones.
"Malfoy?" Neville asked and jumped up, "Malfoy!" Rage came up inside Neville. He balled his fists and got ready to punch Malfoy in the face.
"Okay, repeat what it said.", Ron said and in fact, he sounded a bit like Hermione now.
He pushed his hand away and stormed towards Matt. In one motion, Draco pulled out his wand, flicked it and the boy opposite of him flinched with pain.
"Good boy, very hard working, I like that." Mr Weasley said and entertained Teddy a little with a rubber duck. "So, I guess you left my lazy son at home then?"
"Godson," Harry corrected him and laughed again.
"Please, do you know where Draco is?", Harry asked the Slytherins.
The blonde looked up at Harry and nodded. Harry smiled and they walked over into the kitchen. While Harry was boiling the water, Malfoy looked around and on Harry's shelf, he found a picture of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry actually saw Malfoy smiling at this picture. Harry immediately wanted to see more of this smile and turned his head around, but the smile vanished from Malfoy's lips just as quick as it had appeared.
"At the market, buying something to eat." Malfoy answered, "I thought you had the day off."
"If you have to choose between life and death, you would choose life, even if you have to do horrible things. But you want to protect yourself and your family." Draco said and Harry noticed that his hands were shaking under the table, "And I wanted to protect my family."
They stopped and turned around, but as Parkinson saw it was him, she turned away again.
Draco sighed, clapped his hand on his forehead and stood up. He stuffed the wand in his pocket and and walked back to the castle. He searched for the two of them and in the Great Hall he found them with Longbottom and Finnegan.
"Kreacher, leave us please," Harry ordered and the elve did as he was told.
He stormed out of the Great Hall and on the school yard. Harry screamed into the dark night and balled his fists. He was so angry. Why did McGonnagal do this? What was wrong with her? Had Harry done something wrong so he was getting punished with this? That must be it. McGonnagal wanted to punish him. This was the worst punishment imaginable. Harry felt like crying but he didn't want to. He hated Malfoy!
"Where's Hermione?", said Ron, looking around.
"And you didn't?"
"I'm fine," Blaise answered, afraid of what Draco would say.
"Wow, Hermione." He looked at her, "It's wonderful!"
As they stood in Purge & Dowse Ltd., the entrance to the hospital disguised as a department store, that Harry had been in not long before to visit the injured from the war, Malfoy walked towards the door.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "I know it's clean, idiot. Yeah, alright fine."
"Hey mate. Good to see you.", Ron said and Harry smiled.
"Now...", Harry said and looked at Malfoy, who still stood in front of him, looking as angry as every.
But he didn't get an answer. Instead, a spotlight hit him and Luna pushed him forward. Malfoy froze for a second, but then followed Harry to the stage - reasonable, because he didn't have anyone else here. Hermione helped Harry up on the stage. He looked at the crowd, at all those familiar faces, and swallowed thickly.
Harry closed the door behind himself and breathed out.
Draco looked at him questioning.
"Was Draco here?", Harry's asked Hermione while Madame Pomfrey cleaned his bedside table.
"And don't think you could come in there for revenge, because I am clever enough to lock the door."
"Get away!" Draco shouted at him.
Draco woke up. His shirt was wet because of his sweating. He rubbed his forehead and looked around. Potter's bed was empty. Draco didn't want to know where he was and lay back down. He breathed out and closed his eyes. He had had an awful dream.
"So everyone says we left at 3 in the morning.", Harry concluded and Malfoy nodded once again.
"May I sit?" He asked.
"Yes, yes. I'll tell him. Just hurry up.", Harry said. Malfoy nodded.
"No. You're coming with me. I want to talk to them."
"I'm fine, I'm fine," Harry said, "Don't you turn into Hermione." Malfoy snorted and shook his head.
"Welcome.", he said. Draco smiled and stepped in after him.
Harry sat down and looked around. All in all, the room was very dark. In the middle of the room hung the Slytherin blazon, that could illuminate the room with a slightly green light. Harry watched Draco walking over to his desk and rummaging in a drawer.
"What?"
"Aww, really, did you?", Potter asked and looked at Draco, who blushed hardly and stopped shaking his head.
"You are such fucking idiot.", Draco smirked and Harry laughed.
"You don't have to prove anything to me." Harry said quietly and looked Malfoy deep in the eye.
Now Harry couldn't hold back his sobs anymore. Thinking back at this seemed so surreal.
He pattened the owl on the head and it flew away. Draco closed the window again and rolled out the parchment. It was the answer from Pansy. She didn't wrote much this time.
"Do it!" Potter rolled his eyes and turned around slowly.
They both breathed heavily as they felt waves of pleasure wash over them, but did not let go of each other.
Harry laughed. "Not like
"See?", the girl asked, pointing at Draco, but her eyes fixed on Harry.
Harry nodded nervously. He felt his own cock leak against his stomach, then Draco's hand skimmed over his navel, and he knew Draco would be feeling it too, the slippery trail of pre-come. Draco's breath caught in his throat, a little stuttery inhale, then his fingers brushed across Harry's shaft and Harry bucked wildly into his touch.
. He rolled his eyes. Why was he like that?
"Only one more thing-"
"I suppose two hot chocolate?", Harry asked and Draco nodded.
"Ron, I told you we shouldn't have brought jello," Hermione said and Harry smiled.
"Why don't we go to Diagon Alley later?" Pansy suggested.
"I'd like a cigarette. Would you accompany me?" Malfoy asked.
It turned out Draco didn't even need Harry's clothes after all. They had sneaked back to Harry's room after the quick shower, that has been more kissing than actual showering, and undressed immediately after the door was locked. They did what they hadn't done with each other before, what made Harry feel exhilarated and amazed. Now they lay in Harry's bed, wearing only boxershorts and socks, legs intertwined. Malfoy traced his fingers over Harry's scars.
Draco wasn't very fond of the idea of sitting together with stinky boring Hufflepuff's and annoying smartasses Ravenclaw's. At least Blaise had got a little self respect left and didn't make friends with
"They're idiots, I know.", Draco laughed. Potter nodded.
"No.", Draco said, "Let me hear you."
He parted his lips and welcomed Potter's tongue with his. His head sank deeper into the pillow, their sleepy, slow kiss turning into something more passionate.
"Come on, Ron.", she said and Ron followed her.
"It's not a dream.", Draco answered.
"Because I don't want you to treat him like that.", Harry answered.
They left the store, Malfoy carrying a whole bag filled with sweets. He had bought the two lollipops and Drooble's best blowing gum, lots and lots of chocolate frogs - Harry had never expected Malfoy to be a fan of them - a glass of ice mice and licorice wands. They weren't talking when they walked down the street. They weren't talking until Malfoy had found a bench away from all the houses and people.
He turned the music louder and Draco had to say, this Elvis wasn't that bad.
Plucking up courage, Draco raised his hand to knock - three times. He was freezing, but he was so afraid, he wanted the door to stay closed. Unfortunately, it was opened. Weasley stared at him from the other side of the doorstep.
"I think we need to buy another table tomorrow.", he said and Potter hugged him laughing.
There was a short pause.
"I just-" Malfoy started, but Harry stopped him by holding up his hand and shaking his head.
"You want something to drink?" Harry asked awkwardly.
"He's doing great, healing very quickly." She said with an approving nod, "The scars on his chest won't heal, though, we have tried anything we could. Wounds like this could have killed him, do you perhaps know where they came from?"
"Well, I don't know, I just - I thought maybe you'd like to come over to my house tomorrow." Potter stuttered.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Shut up, Malfoy." He grabbed his bag. "I brought something for you."
"Just a bad dream.", Harry told him quietly.
"Never do this to me again.", Draco said smiling. Harry grinned.
Malfoy couldn't hide a smile, what made Harry smile even more.
Malcolm had left the office with his head held high. Harry was proud of him to have resolved such a big issue, but then there came someone he knew through the door. Romilda Vane. Harry had had quite a history with Romilda, she had started at Hogwarts when Harry had been in third year and he remembered vividly how she had tried to give him a love potion, but Ron had eaten it accidentally in his sixth year.
"Now let's sleep."
Harry washed his face with cold water and stared at his reflection in the mirror. Then, the door opened and Malfoy appeared in the mirror behind Harry. He lay his hand on Harry's shoulder and the two boys looked at each other in the mirror.
Draco hated Weasley and Granger and they hated him. Potter rhated Pansy, Blaise, Greg and Theo and they hated him. It was just tge same. Draco sighed. He rolled to his side and stared at the wall, trying to sleep.
"Let's go.", Potter said. Draco looked at him.
"Don't you dare ever coming back!", Vernon shouted after them, as Draco grabbed Potter's arm and they disapparated back to their home.
"The year is still long, Potter." Potter laughed.
"Tomorrow." He told himself and closed his eyes. He could see the silhouette of Hogwarts in front of him and fell asleep.
They lay there together, for a long time, not speaking, merely continuing to look into each others eyes.
Harry kissed him again.
"He just said I'm doing wrong things."
After Dean had left as well and the coast was clear, Luna flung her arms around Malfoy, who stood there frozen and was completely overwhelmed.
"Ah, yes. Malfoy.", Ron said, seemingly remembering about Harry's boyfriend.
Harry laughed too. He wanted to talk about Draco with them, but he knew that Draco wouldn't like it. And to be honest, there was nothing to talk about. He and Draco weren't in a relationship or something and you
"Hermione!", Potter snapped back with a stern look before Draco could even answer.
"I saw them.", he said. Narcissa nodded.
"I'm so sorry, but we have to close." He said.
After breakfast, Harry and Neville made their way to Transfiguration while Ron waited for Hermione to finish reading.
"No.", he said firmly.
Harry. "And then I said he was just some scrawny little bloke. And he said he was strong and I thought this was funny and said he was not strong enough. And that's when we walked in on you."
"Sorry."
"No.", she laughed slightly, "Mister Potter asked for you." Draco straightened himself.
bad. Harry fell asleep with a big, fat smile on his face.
Potter's pupils were wide and black, and god, Draco wanted to weep at the delicious torment of his touch, the teasing, wicked way he brought Potter to the edge.
"But I just don't have the strength to deal with two babies right now." Harry said with a look at sweet Teddy sleeping in his arms.
"Drink.", she ordered. Harry took one sip and choked. It was disgusting.
"Yeah?"
"What are you idiots up to?" He asked.
" was another headline. Draco knew this article just too well. It was from Rita Skeeter.
"Don't be sorry for everything.", he said. Harry was still shaking.
"Come. Now," Draco said sternly. His stomach was fluttering and he wasn't so sure about this anymore.
"Potter." Draco answered and put on his best sneer.
Harry sighed and picked up his towel, wand and new clothes.
"So that's why you two are such good friends?"
"Get in.", Draco mumbled, not looking at Potter, just lifting the covers a little- very carefully.
"You know exactly Malfoy has them in the palm of his hand, they wouldn't do anything as long as he's there." Ron said, "They're bloody afraid of him and, quite frankly, they should be of you too."
