Harry pushed past a young girl who was nearly crying with excitement, trying to squeeze his group through. He had to flash his badge at glaring fans more than once before they made it to the section at the bottom of the stage.
And then he went right back to staring at the textbook in his lap as though he hadn’t said anything at all.
Harry wasn't sure how to do this. It had been so long since he'd had a civil conversation with Ron, and he was still more than a little cross with him if he was to be completely honest.
Harry grimaced, and Malfoy grinned at him. Harry hoped that smile wouldn't always flip his stomach like it did.
Harry hadn’t been sure how to take any of that in, but Sheila hadn’t appeared concerned by his distress. She’d simply plowed on, theorising as only she could.
I really loved writing this chapter. Neville and Lavender will be main characters in this, because I love them and I say so. As always I’d love to know your guy’s thoughts.
New determination overtook Harry, and he swam faster toward the music, soon coming upon a large rock in the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of various merpeople on it.
was forgiven. He had been for a very long time, even if Harry had never had the chance to tell him. But it was a darkness that he’d spent too long pretending didn’t exist.
Thank you to everyone who reads this. And thanks a million to everyone who has or will comment, I really appreciate/d it c:
“Quidditch?” asked Harry, heart quickening despite himself. He hadn’t been certain that they even played Quidditch here, and was exhilarated at the thought of flying again.
Draco, though, was still clearly waiting for an answer. Harry had to at least try to reassure him, but he knew sugar coating wouldn’t solve anything, so he resigned himself. “Sometimes I have to... go without. Mostly it’s just housework and insults, though. A few really big lies,” he admitted, “but Hagrid told me the truth when he met me. And I’m here now, so everything’s alright.”
Harry looked back and forth between them in bewilderment. “Why hasn’t there been an announcement? Or… a lock down of some sort until she’s found?”
Draco's jaw was flexing, and Harry wanted to calm him but didn't know how. "I came out fine after the first task, this time'll be no different."
Cosima nodded. “Came to in the third floor corridor that Christmas day. Had no idea we’d been missing for so long.”
But they were nonetheless the sort of answers that came from a budding relationship—the almost innocent angst of will-they-won’t-they that would hardly have registered, wrapped as it was inside the temperamental ocean that was Harim’s love.
A minute later arms came around him and he jumped at the unexpected contact. Since when did Blaise hug him? But when he opened his eyes, he understood. Pansy held onto him tightly, though where she came from Draco had no idea. He could see Blaise over her shoulder, back on his bed and pretending to be deaf like any good friend should.
Draco looked between the two of them somewhat helplessly. “I still don’t understand what’s going on.”
murdering her father, Cygnus Black—the then Head of House Black—and her mother, Druella, in their sleep.
"I'd tell him he should be nicer to students,” Neville answered immediately. “Er, I reckon he might not be as Snape-like then, but terrifying first years isn't exactly the best skill for a professor. I wouldn't say it to be rude or anything, just to try and help him understand where some others are coming from."
Shoutout to Alana for calling the publicist bit way back when. In the original outline for this fic, the whole reason for Harry’s side plot with Neville was to eventually find him a more comfortable, relevant means of living with his newfound skill set. But I love having them as buddies so much, too, so a good decision all around I think.
Harry furrowed his brows. If he had expected a translation from the Slytherin, he was disappointed. Malfoy simply rolled his eyes at both girls.
For a moment, Draco thought she wouldn’t answer or hadn’t been listening for his thoughts over the Dark Lord’s voice. But then she said,
Harry felt his cheeks flush, hating that he couldn’t refute it. Hating the lie. “I’m not here in defense of what I’ve done. I told you, I’m trying to make it right.”
Ophelia flinched in surprise when she found him in her path. “Merlin, Potter, you scared me,” she chastised, irritated. “What?”
Harry finally looked at him, his mouth opening like he meant to reply but producing no sound. Finally, he swallowed. “I need to be a part of this. It needs to be me.”
. It was impossible, ridiculous, absolutely mad that everyone had managed to ignore something so blatantly obvious.
Harry turned his head to the side to look at the other man. He wasn’t looking at Harry, just kept staring at the ceiling.
He and Malfoy sat beside each other as the stands filled up. Half the school must’ve showed just to watch, the chatter deafening while more and more people filled the field. Harry could just make out Joshua, his dark silhouette in direct contrast to the slightly shorter, lightly tanned brunet next to him. Even from where Harry sat, it was clear they were already arguing.
Malfoy hadn’t sat with them of late, opting to avoid Harry whenever he could get away with it, which was as often as possible. Harry knew that their friends were incredibly curious on top of their irritation, but he still hadn’t been able to bring himself to fully explain.
“How do they even narrow down this many people?” Harry asked, deliberately changing the subject as they waited for things to really get started.
“I will have to insist that the adults handle the situation this time, Potter. Children have no place in this,” Draco’s dad said finally.
Ayesha had her arms around him, her face pressed to his chest. After a moment of surprise, Harry tentatively hugged her back. He rested his chin atop her head, his body relaxing instinctively.
“Theo,” Draco began sternly. “You’re my friend. I don’t want this between us. I want to move on. And for that I need you to stop feeling guilty and let it go, alright?”
Harry laughed and kissed him, and it felt every bit as brilliant as the first time they'd ever kissed. "I love you," Harry said between that kiss and the next. Another "I love you" after it. Then another kiss. "I love you." And another. "I love you." And another. "I love you."
Draco sighed. “I was only thinking how long it would be before I stop... catching myself. You know, second guessing if all of this is real.”
He thought about the Neville Longbottom he’d grown up with. That man had been a gentle soul, fearful as a child but fiercely loyal and extraordinarily brave when he’d needed to be.
Lavender had been hurt, perhaps rightfully. But that didn’t mean she had to be right. Lavender had also called him on avoiding all his friends from before, though, and she’d had a point.
It was all she could do to keep her tears from spilling over. Not trusting her voice anymore, she nodded.
“I know exactly what I’m talking about,” Harry retorted, getting frustrated now. “I had the story all written up. I had photos.”
Then she seemed to take everything in, glancing at the glass bowl of eggs on the counter, the pan on the stove, the dogeared novel on the kitchen table. She exhaled through her nose. “You weren’t going to go,” she said. She sounded painfully unsurprised.
"See you around, mate," Fred said, he and George smiling full rows of teeth, one reaching out to muss Harry’s dark curls before walking off. They went in opposite direction their younger brother had gone.
Harry had, like with everyone else, given her a second chance at life. Unintended, but a consequence of his actions nonetheless. If she had proven herself an even somewhat acceptable person, he might’ve found the strength to leave her be. But here was the proof she was certainly not. And that was all he needed.
The Slytherin nodded, breathing out in relief. He shook his head, then, as though clearing it. “You’re not going back.”
Harry spared himself a moment to wish he might have come upon a mostly empty house, in which Molly might’ve been making pastries or engaged in something equally simple to pass the time, and wouldn’t have minded the interruption of a little company.
Well sod it, he decided viciously, his heart still galloping in his chest. Sod Lavender’s theories, and sod bloody Dumbledore.
“I do, I always will,” she insisted. She and Viktor had been through so much over the years, but they’d somehow always made it through everything. She never wanted to lose what they had.
Not even a hundred kids showed up to try for Quidditch, and the stands were more empty than not. Still, Harry was thrilled. After all, Malfoy was right when he’d said less kids meant more chance of making the team. Not that Harry had any doubts.
All Harry's friends from Gryffindor had come as well, congratulating him often and being considerably warmer than Draco knew most of them had been lately.
Clark took a deep breath, regaining her composure. “As your Head of House,” she began, her voice a warning all its own, “I am sending you both
Essentially, if your mind was occupied by any person that was truly other—as you and I have talked about a form of possession before, think of that—it would fragment under the strain of housing incompatible structures, especially for such a sustained period of time.
"Ask the lunatics who gave it to us," Harry replied, ears still ringing. "What clue we're supposed to gather from that, I've no idea."
Harry briefly pictured himself taking Draco clubbing with Lavender, Parvati, and Pansy Parkinson, and cringed. He was certain
Then Malfoy stood up, abandoning his half eaten meal and left the Great Hall without so much as a goodbye to his friends. Neither of them appeared concerned, likely used to melodrama. It was now or never, Hermione decided and darted quickly out after him. She heard Ron say something, but ignored it. Who knew when she would have another chance to speak to Malfoy privately.
When classes finally released for the day, Harry and Malfoy practically raced each other to the pitch. Joshua, Cosima, Maria, and Celine were all there to support them, even though these tryouts had far less fanfare.
“Haven’t seen anyone since this pillock followed me in,” said Not Fleur. Draco scowled but knew better than to say anything.
"More than. I wouldn't have even known to think along those lines if he hadn't said something. This is it, Harry's going to do fine. Merlin it's like I can breathe again... er no pun intended."
It would be down to Blaise alone to discreetly watch for Draco's entrances and exits, since Harry's role in things—as well as Hermione's and Neville's—was to occupy Snape's attention by bringing his wrath down upon themselves. All the three of them could do was pray it would all go according to plan and they wouldn't be forfeiting their entire lives to detention with the man as a result.
Draco’s back straightened, tense. There was no telling how this would go, and there was no one around to save him from the moment.
It took hardly any time at all to spot a certain singer, even with how different his hair made him look in person. He was sitting alone at the bar, eyeing the whiskey in his glass with an absent expression. Harry took a deep breath and sat down on the stool next to him. The other man looked up at the movement, and his fingers visibly tightened around his drink.
And this is because, despite what you would very obviously prefer to believe, you and Harim are fundamentally the same person. That is why there is only room for one entity in the long run. Setting aside the factors placing you on opposite sides of the metaphorical spectrum, you actually share an array of intrinsic traits. These are unchangeable. They are the nature element of the nature versus nurture debate, if you will. I don’t expect you to have a working concept of neural science, of course, so allow me to paint you a picture.
It’d probably been a bad idea to ask Hermione how Malfoy’s friends had been. It was almost certain she’d put it together immediately. But Harry hadn’t been able to help it. If he was honest with himself, he’d been hoping she’d give him more details, the kind that Malfoy would want to hear. The Pukwudgies never delivered any post to the Slytherin, of course, since he’d likely had to leave his mates without explanation. News from home would’ve been a brilliant excuse to break the heavy silence between them.
you just hate everyone who isn’t pureblood and want to see us all dead, and in that case you might want to write a letter to your dad and ask him to explain why he’s to spend his life in Azkaban for willingly obeying a lesser being.”
He was grateful that Draco and Hermione had informed him in such detail what the gillyweed would do, or he might have been distressed to find himself with gills and unable to breathe above water. As it was, he slid below the surface and began to swim, sweet oxygen ever present in his lungs. For what felt a long while, he carried on like that, growing more and more conscious of the time as well as worried he would run out of it. Those concerns quickly became secondary, however, when something latched on painfully to his leg. The water was murky, but it was still easy enough to make out the demon-like grindylow. For a moment, he thrashed against the creature before making for his wand. He finally grabbed hold of it, two more grindylows having emerged and taken hold of him in the meantime.
"Wow, Nev," Harry said. "You've a heart of gold. I think just about everyone else would have a few choice words."
For the next unbelievably nerve-wrecking couple of hours, Draco did his best. Time seemed to pass strangely, though he thought it may have just been the stress. The only real means he had of knowing approximately how much time had passed was when the woman would open a pouch on her hip and drink what must have been Polyjuice from a flask.
Harry looked down at his page of half-formed doodles and back up. He sighed, unable to recall what he’d been taught in Transfiguration this morning, either. If he’d been taught anything at all, that was. “It’s nothing,” he said. “Just distracted.”
“Who’s the one with the best chance of nicking it? Or who would do it without asking too many questions?”
Harry sighed, having expected as much. He reminded himself of his decision to follow his gut. “I know you don’t want to hear this, but I think you were right before. You might just have to get out in front of it. You can’t wait for him to be divorced. It might be that this is the only chance left.”
, Not Fleur told him. He nearly shushed her out of fear before he understood she was speaking to his mind. He realised in the same moment that, yes, of course she was a Legilimens. Why else would she have trusted him so easily earlier in the maze?
But then they reached the den, where everyone looked over at their entrance practically in sync, and the momentary comfort he’d felt evaporated.
"All right, Harry?" Cedric asked from right next to him. He sounded downright excited, only the slightest bit of nerves evident in his voice.
he reminded himself the next moment. Knowing that didn’t calm him nearly enough, however, as he was still bewildered. He didn’t appear to be the only one, as Not Harry chose that moment to notice Auror Fleur and ask, “What do we do?”
"Fine," Harry said hesitantly, wondering how many times he would lose his best mate before it was permanent. And if this might just be it. "I choose him then."
"Merlin! Are you all incompetent?!" Snape demanded before stalking over to Harry's workstation. "I really shouldn't be surprised Potter, your abysmal effort in my class is as unmatched as ever. Another thirty points from Gryffindor! And where is your
“Ron was asking about you again today,” she was saying to Draco. “I thought you’d like to know that. I never would have imagined a year ago that the two of you would be friends. Or the two of us, for that matter. But I’m so glad we are... I miss you. We all miss you. Your parents miss you. Harry misses you, though I’m sure he tells you that himself often enough. He’s... not well, Draco. I don’t think you’d want to see him like this. His birthday came and went a while back, turned fifteen and he didn’t even blink. It’s—”
When Draco looked at him in alarm, the other boy only waved his arm. “It took both me and Pansy to drag it out of them, and none of us are going to tell anyone anything.”
Even worse, everyone was going to have to be willing to sacrifice House points to do it—everyone being all the Gryffindors. The only reason Hermione and Neville had agreed was because it would be Draco doing the actual breaking in and stealing, and his would be the worst punishment of all if he was somehow caught in the act.
Cosima looked down at the wand in her hand, mournful. “I’m no-maj born,” she said quietly. “You’d think that would make it better, easier somehow. I mean, Cel’s pureblood. One of very few like
His rising panic and dread were forcefully put aside, though, when the muscles in all four Auror’s shoulders tensed and Not Fleur murmured, “Someone’s here. Hide.”
This is where I started listing song inspiration. I’ve deleted a lot of those chapter notes now and linked the Spotify playlist at the end of the fic. If you’re coming across this now: enjoy the music!
Blaise rolled his eyes. "This is my dorm as well, so either go find somewhere else to be sickeningly in love, or go to
"I don't think anyone would choose desperate to describe you, Potter. And why wouldn't you want to take me? Because I'm a bloke? That's rather homophobic of you, don't you think?"
“I haven’t even gone on yet, mate,” Neville said at Harry’s shoulder. “There’s still time for him to show.”
“Right well, I think I’ve had my fill of this conversation,” said Draco at that. “Thanks for letting me know I can keep my name I guess.”
Hermione watched the boys leave and prayed for all their sakes that Filch wasn’t anywhere near the Astronomy tower at the moment.
Neville rolled his eyes, not moving from his position. “He said that I’m going to be forgotten. I wasn’t talented enough to maintain what we had going, and I ought to be working on my backup plan for once we ran out of C grade hits. Isn’t that what’s happening now?”
So they were here for quidditch, Harry realised. That made sense; his brother would be Hogwarts age now certainly. Ayesha agreed, and then they were walking onto the grounds.
"Very well," Snape said at last through his teeth. He seemed to put great effort into turning from them and walking away.
The Slytherin hadn’t so much as glanced Harry’s direction all weekend, which meant there’d been no change. He’d had nothing to go on, no indication anything he’d said had gotten through. Until now, that was. The very possibility was startling.
In any case, Parvati had been right. It wasn’t twenty minutes later that the floo flared up and Lavender came through. She didn’t notice him immediately, heading straight to the kitchen and setting her purse on the island.
Draco opened his eyes to find his mother staring at him. Hermione had disappeared a while back, presumably to tell everyone he was awake. Harry moved out of the way likely just in time. Draco had no doubt his mother would have peeled his boyfriend off of him otherwise, as she practically launched herself at him. Draco closed his eyes and sighed into her embrace, a moment passing before he realised she’d begun sobbing.
Malfoy wrinkled his nose. “I hate them because they don’t deserve our fear. Because we may as well be gods in comparison to them, but we cower like sewer rats so as not to risk extinction. I hate them because they have no right, but they outnumber us so vastly we’ve no other choice.”
There were no words for this, Draco decided. He had actually kissed Harry Potter; he must have been certifiable to do so but he had. In public, no less. And Harry was kissing him back. Had Harry kissed anyone before? Draco knew it was ridiculous—not to mention selfish—of him to hope the answer was no, but he did anyway.
Draco’s head whipped back just in time to watch his family owl swoop down and place a letter in front of him. Draco blinked at the bird dumbly. “Pyxis?”
Ron only shuddered, and then left. Leaving the Hall, however, proved to be a mistake of epic proportions. Harry and Malfoy hadn't made it very far at all. Worse, they didn't appear to notice him. It looked as if Malfoy was trying to leave the world's most noticeable hickey on Harry’s neck. Harry, who’s head was tossed backwards, was staring at the ceiling as though he could see the stars beyond it. Ron could only watch in horrified fascination until finally, finally he remembered how to move, and left to sit and possibly obliviate himself in the common room.
Heartbeats by The Knife is playing at the beginning of this chapter; I couldn’t resist the opportunity
an inner voice helpfully pointed out. Harry sighed and tried to push the blond out of his mind. Everyone was focused on defeating Voldemort, it was only right Harry be as well.
It was a short moment before Harry ceased gaping and cleared his throat. “Be that as it may,” he said finally, “I was only saying how it would look. Don’t let the Prophet slander you like this.”
He couldn’t risk them using this as an excuse to leave him behind, not when he’d went through so much just to be allowed there. More Aurors had joined Timothy when Harry had went down, and he hurried to explain what must have happened. Thankfully, they all took him seriously.
,” Draco stressed. “You did nothing wrong. Harry was just scared when he said those things to you. It’s not the truth.”
Maria nodded. “Understatement. They tried to say that it must’ve been, like, a freak accident. Like they’d done it to themselves or something.”
Not Harry, who had obviously landed badly, twisted around to scowl at him. The look was all at once so familiar and not familiar at all that it stole the blond’s breath for a moment.
"It's true," Pansy assured them all. "No one was looking anywhere but at Snape. I still can't believe none of you let me in on the plan, though," she huffed.
Draco answered what he thought unspoken. “So I’m telling you now. My father wanted me to look at the scars and think horrible things. How I had no money, no status, no—no children in my future. But instead I made these my own. Now they remind me that who I am, I chose to be. That despite what he took from me, I have choices that I never would have had.”
“I know that,” Draco snapped. “And he forgave you, because he’s Harry and he’ll forgive anyone for just about anything. I’m example enough of that. The point is that he shouldn’t have to
His name was said frantically, the feminine voice laced with anxious worry. Harry could feel soft hands pressed to his cheeks. And, for a dazed moment of relief, he thought
Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand in his. The blond flinched in surprise but didn’t pull it away.
“You were one of Skeeter’s little rats,” she said testily. “You’ve some nerve showing up to a Holly’s doorstep after you wrote that shite about Angie and Coach.”
Neville himself lay next to him, his hand lightly tapping along to the music streaming from his sound speakers.
Draco grabbed the back of Harry’s neck and pulled him forward, crashing their lips together. He decided this was far better than being dead.
Wednesday had, in fact, been a blood bath. ‘The Culling,’ as Maria had gleefully dubbed it, had required nearly four hours to cut less than ten down to small digits, depending on how many slots were even in need of filling. And the final rejects had not gone quietly.
“You’re a pureblood without any magic,” Celine had mimicked once several days ago, voice pitched in an obnoxious mockery, “a disgrace! You’re not welcome in any home of mine!”
It was not a large party that awaited him, either, thankfully. In fact, there were only the five of them.
Finally, Harry said, “Because, if so, that means you must think you were a better wizard than Voldemort.”
In hindsight, it really shouldn’t of been such a surprise that Dumbledore would tell him no. Pointing out that Harry was also ‘
But as they made their way to the end of the school year, Harry knew there was no avoiding the daunting thoughts of the task to come. He was more than aware that his future with Draco could come to an end all too quickly if he wasn’t careful enough.
"Not really a trio anymore," Hermione pointed out as Lavender Brown made her way to Ron’s arm. She turned back to Harry. "Speaking of, where
His wretched counterpart was wrong, anyway, or exaggerating. Harry had fancied himself in love with Ginny once, sure, but the whole thing had lasted longer than it should have, and wasn’t even very long, besides. Moreso, after the urgency of the post-war had faded, it had been perpetually lacking in meaningful intimacy.
As they walked off the grounds, Harry thought how lucky he was to have avoided seeing Dumbledore face to face, but he knew he would have to some day. He wasn’t ready right now for how that would feel. It was an effort not to be too visibly relieved when they landed back in his flat.
The following scream was terrible, and Draco’s back straightened so tightly that his body jolted. The Auror by his side gripped her wand tightly, much like Draco was doing. Then, before he had time to even fear for her, she peered very quickly over the edge, and then breathed out very long and slow in obvious relief. The scream had been the servant’s then. For a moment, Draco pitied the unknown man.
"All my life I suspect, but you'll have to forgive me for not figuring it out sooner, seeing as I'm fourteen and all," said Harry.
For the next half hour or so, the five of them discussed everything they knew about Bartemius Crouch, his history and connection to the Death Eaters as well as all that had happened so far this year. When Ron mentioned Lucius Malfoy—looking surprisingly apologetic about it—Draco admitted that his father had been among those masked at the World Cup, which Harry had all but been sure of already. Draco didn’t know for sure who had sent up the Dark Mark though, only that the Marks on the Death Eaters were solidifying again. But Draco hadn’t had any real contact with his father since December, so he had no way of knowing what was going on on that side anymore. His guess work, though, seemed to be incredibly helpful to Sirius, despite Draco’s insistence that Snape was likely on the right side of things.
" he gurgled, and despite that the word only resulted in a large bubble and a muffled, incomprehensible noise, the spell somehow still worked, sending what seemed a jet of boiling water at the creatures, forcing them to release him. He swam away as quickly as possible, occasionally casting the same spell behind him just to be sure nothing would sneak up on him again. Maybe another five minutes had gone by before he heard it: singing.
Malfoy seemed to remember the last part about halfway through his meal. They were sat with at least three feet between them, Harry paying pointed attention to his food and trying not to react to the group’s watching them both with bewilderment, when the blond suddenly stood and stomped over to the table where Noelle and Jacqueline sat amongst a handful of other transfer students. Harry was immediately relieved.
They were escorted to the office by a pair of boys Harry didn’t know, and no one spoke the entire way there. The silence was broken only once by Malfoy’s mumbled
Draco closed his eyes. "I forgot to tell you last night how much I love it when you say my given name." When he opened his eyes again, Harry was blushing.
He read it twice through, and then dropped it onto the table. He could feel Hermione's concerned gaze on him, but he did not meet her eyes. Seconds later, though, the letter was snatched and in her hands.
Harry all too happily did as he was told, just as horrified by the sound as he was the first time he'd tried to open it. It was why he'd wanted to put this off in the first place. But Draco had brought up the second task a few days ago, worried about its' fast approaching.
“Who’s Slytherin’s Head of House?” he asked aloud, thoughtlessly. Both Remus and Ayesha turned to give him matching quizzical looks.
Sheila sighed. “Let’s try something different,” she suggested patiently. “I’d like to see if perhaps I could talk to him—Harim, as you refer to him as.”
Harry’s attention had snagged, though. “End your tenure?” he repeated, unreasonably surprised. “As in, you’re leaving the Unspeakables?”
Harry was tired. It was nearly all he could feel, an exhaustion so acute it overrode everything else.
Malfoy snorted. “She just didn’t know where I was, wanted to meet up like we usually do. Then she decided that I was busy, because she doesn’t like you.”
Draco felt more relaxed than he had in a long while, and it was obvious Harry felt the same, as he had finally began to let loose. That was, until the Weasley clan made their entrance. Though it wasn't an
Draco's head snapped towards the other boy so fast he nearly made himself dizzy. "A plant?" he repeated dumbly.
He looked at Draco again then. “Things had been... strained between us before your accident. I didn’t visit because I felt my presence might harm your recovery.”
how it is for you to be around family. No matter what you think of me, I have always understood why you do what you do, even if you don’t want to hear that. But you have to know that Amjad is different; he’s always thought you hung the moon. So I don’t want you to lie to him if you’re just going to hurt him later when you realise you can’t handle it.”
“And I was promised that I would be returned to my full power and glory. Look at me, Wormtail. Do I look as though I received what was promised?”
“That doesn’t matter,” his father waved him off. “If all goes correctly, we’ll practically be heroes.”
Harry, though, had a lot more convoluted of a personal path. And he didn’t have anyone to ‘tell him what he needed to do.’
“I don’t have a very clear idea what’s going on with the two of you, mate, but I think you need to fix it. We all hate seeing you like this.”
Harry noted with necessary detachment—because why did this never seem to get any less shocking?—how kind age had been to the man, producing a squared jaw and broader shoulders than in youth. But there was the same dark-hazel eyes, the same deep brown hair, the same grin.
“No,” Draco interrupted, his voice low. “You listen. There’s always been bad blood between us, Weasley. Even before we’d ever spoken two words to each other. And since then the words have not been kind ones. I’m not going to apologise, you’re not going to apologise. No need to waste the breath on pretence.”
That was when it finally occurred to Draco that it might be really nice to get home and have a shower, change his clothes, and, Merlin, eat actual food again.
All the while, Malfoy looked blank, as though, for him, time had simply stopped. Like he couldn’t quite manage to form thoughts, let alone words.
Theo rolled his eyes. “You honestly think Blaise and Greg didn’t tell me everything they heard you say?”
The library taught him many things that night; they were things he ought to have already made it his business to know, long before then.
“Having a good day Mr. Potter?” professor Hanson asked him as he entered the classroom just then. Several people giggled, but Harry just nodded.
Neville watched Blaise in amazement as he silently, anxiously, counted the seconds. The Slytherin boy was
"Oh thank Merlin," Hermione's voice cut in from behind Harry. They both turned to face her, startled. She beamed at them. "I worried you'd never get over yourself," she told Ron.
"I know, Potter. It's fine. I guess because Pansy and Blaise didn't believe I'd do it. I think I just wanted to prove to them that I wasn't a coward. It backfired, obviously."
When he looked up, expecting Lavender to be sneering at him, he found the opposite. She looked weary with relief, of all things.
“Oh Harry I’m just teasing,” she laughed. “Lavender did say you were a bit barmy these days. Come in.”
Cosima took a deep breath, looking quickly around to be sure no one was paying them any mind, and slipped her wand from her pocket.
The blond shook his head to assure him. “No, I don’t blame you. I’d probably have done the same thing in your place, but Theo’s still my friend. I have to fix this if I can.”
Draco’s appearance was always difficult to miss, even in a crowd, but with his sister at his side, it would have been impossible.
Draco’s grey eyes softened as he remembered the same conversation that Harry was. There was an apology in them—one that Harry didn’t deserve but was immensely grateful to receive regardless. “I hope you know it is.”
"Suppose that's fair," said Malfoy a moment later. Harry's mind whirled. Surely Draco Malfoy did not admit his own faults.
“Crazy Death Eater bastard chopped off his own hand for that maniac and now I think he’s bleeding out,” Draco told him, all business.
Oh my god look guys an update! I know some of you were beginning to doubt you’d live to see it, but I am back again. I actually stayed up pretty late last night in kind of a concentrated burst of writing and then fixing this, because I was just so excited to have something to post again. I even got a bit of a start on the next chapter, so ideally—hopefully but don’t quote me—there shouldn’t be as long of a break between updates next time.
Harry rubbed his eyes then, suddenly very tired of it all. “None of it matters anymore,” he told the blond. “I know everything I need to know and I’m where I want to be.”
They’d barely entered the school again when a familiar voice stopped them on their way to the Thunderbird wing.
"You can rest assured," Harry said as soon as the girl was out of range, "as I think that proved I'm definitely gay."
No one could know. For her own safety, Sheila was better off in ignorance of Harry’s plotting. Especially when the plan was still on relatively shaky ground and there was no telling what could go wrong.
Draco pretended not to notice when Hermione shot him a last look of concern. He could handle seeing his father if it meant Harry would be safe again.
Blaise found the entire situation unbelievably hilarious, which he made very clear that evening in the Slytherin common room before dinner. Harry, Draco, Hermione, Neville and Pansy had all had taken up various positions in front of the fireplace, listening to Blaise laugh and retell the story from his point of view.
Everything he saw was somewhat familiar now; he didn’t have trouble finding his way in the dim light. Dhadhi’s portrait was asleep, snoring softly as Harry imagined her flesh-and-blood counterpart was at that moment, as well.
Harry gave a surprised yelp, but Ayesha didn’t even blink. “I hope you weren’t planning to give the student body a show,” she said mildly, eyeing her watch. “Doubt Amjad would appreciate that too much.”
“What about if professor Clark doesn’t like you?” he asked, unable to stop himself glancing at Malfoy again, who pointedly did not look up.
“It’s okay,” he said breathlessly. “We have loads of time. Some point in the future when we’re... ready.”
Merlin, but Harry was tired. He was tired of all of it—of being so anxious and guilty and uncomfortable all of the time.
Dumbledore only nodded. “It’s nothing to be worried about anymore, my boy,” he assured him. “The young Crouch was interrogated under truth serum and the real Alastor has been found. He is being cared for as we speak. I only thought you’d like one more trouble off your mind, and your Map returned of course.”
Draco’s mum turned to Harry then, her eyes soft but concerned. “The Dark Lord, dear. I am so very sorry.”
Neville put his face in his hands, and Harry waited. “I think someone got a photo,” he said finally. “I’d like to believe it was just of a kiss but...  I can’t believe how stupid I am.”
“I don’t care,” Harry cut her off immediately, resolute. “I’m not risking that again. For my little brother, yeah, but not for the sake of- self-improvement, or whatever you think it's going to accomplish. Besides, he’s not even here right now anyway.”
Over two months after the battle, Hermione Granger could be found sitting in what might as well have been known as “Harry’s chair.”
The incredible green of Harry's eyes had retreated some, the pupils widened and giving the impression they were darker than they were naturally. They were also—Draco noted with satisfaction—slightly clouded over, much like he imagined his own were. But that would have to be addressed later, because at the moment they had Snape to contend with. The Potions master was looking down at them with pure disgust—and something else Draco didn’t have time to think about—his lip curled back and his eyes slitted. For once, Draco was a bit unnerved by him.
Sirius cut her off with another laugh. “Only having a bit of fun, I do understand. I assure you Mr. Malfoy, I’m no mad criminal.”
And then Draco was laughing, short and helpless, like he was stunned. “Circe,” he said, his smile wide and almost awed. “You haven’t done something even close to this ridiculous for me since we were fifteen.”
The words were playful, but Harry wanted to give a real answer, sentimental as it was going to sound. He looked Draco directly in the eyes. "No, I didn't. Not this you, anyway. I'd never heard you laugh like you do when you're happy. I'd never seen you be playful or protective or caring. And now that I have, it doesn't matter who calls me disgusting or delusional or whatever else, because you are incredi–"
Harry’s heart squeezed painfully. He fought to keep it from showing on his face, but must not have quite. This seemed to result in the wrong impression.
But Harry could now see what the dark, inked lines concealed. The scarring would have almost blended in perfectly, had it not been ever so slightly raised.
“That... that is brilliant!” the blond exclaimed. “Wait, how do you even know about his cloak? What’s the point of having one of those if you go telling everyone about it?”
Alright so! I have actually been quite excited to get to this. This chapter and the next, in particular, I’ve almost been a bit nervous for. I would love to know what you guys are thinking at this point! As always, thanks so much for reading! 700 kudos! That’s pretty awesome! <3
“Neville,” Harry sighed. “Listen to me. You have to be more careful if you’re going to keep doing this. He’s not just your manager; he’s the head of your label. And that might just be one thing, if he wasn’t married.”
Harry was lounging on the couch, watching Malfoy as he spoke to Parkinson. Hermione was doing some writing for SPEW in hopes of owling it to the
Draco swallowed. "Because you telling him off was—I know how difficult that must of been for you, and I'm awful for enjoying it so much."
Malfoy twisted from her and punched the wall so hard Hermione heard his knuckle crack, but he made no cry of pain. Hermione swallowed her surprise. She'd never imagined Draco Malfoy the type to express anger physically, though she didn't now know why she'd thought that. Slytherins had just always seemed so... collected.
Harry couldn’t quite keep the bitterness from his tone at that. Once again, someone in his head set on controlling him.
He made his way up the left staircase quietly, so as not to disturb the sleeping manor, and slipped into the massive ancestral library he had only recently learned was there, evidently seeing little use.
Harry sat against the headboard and rubbed underneath his glasses. They were new, and improved his vision much better than his old ones. Both Draco and Pansy had insisted, though he’d not budged on keeping the rounded shape he’d been accustomed to. Sometimes, though, they still felt a bit strange. “Under the stairs,” he confirmed. “It was my room.”
Hermione took a grateful sip and then looked back down at Draco. “I come when I can, but I don’t have as much time now that I’ve got coursework again. In fact, I’m surprised you’re here.”
“…And so I told him,” Pansy said, poking about in her Ceasar Salad, pushing the bacon to the side of the dish. “That it couldn’t have been from Hugo the Terrible, because he lived during the great unicorn famine in the 8th century and back then they didn’t even use glass-shards to contain-“ Pansy snapped her fingers in Draco’s face and he jumped slightly in his seat, his grey eyes landing on her dark ones. “You’re not even listening to me, you prat.”
“Hardly,” Pansy rolled her eyes before she made an ‘off with you’-gesture with her hand. “Owl me, okay?”
, Draco wanted to say, but he kept quiet and looked away. It seemed he’d knocked himself out bashing his head into the bathroom mirror that morning after his fateful wank in the shower. Fortunately, it seemed he wouldn’t have to shag Astoria tonight. At least he didn’t think so. Did you have to shag your wife after waking up in hospital? A notion as bizarre as the actual shagging itself and Draco felt dirty all over again.
When he didn’t work, he went to the gym and worked out some frustrations. When he came home - to a bizarrely empty house with his sour-face house elf still hiding in the cupboards, he continued redecorating, preparing bedrooms for his boys and one for Lily when she was old enough to properly be without Ginny for more than a day or so.
Potter rolled his eyes, “Come off it, Draco.” Potter sighed, “Yeah, I’ve heard the rumours. Mistresses and so on. Though, call me an idiot, but I don’t think it’s ‘mistresses’ as much as men you meet in bars like this, eh?”
His father… Well, he might need more time. Or a friendly visit from a Demetor. Draco hasn’t decided yet.
He’d meet with Gemma Zabini today, discussing the divorce proceedings and how Potter’s assets were to be divided.
Opening the door, it became obvious that it wasn’t his neighbour from the door next to his. It was Potter, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking delicious enough to devour and Draco found he still hated him as much as he had just the other day.
“Want something to drink?” Harry asked, moving towards the liquor cabinet. He had a few bottles of wine stored in there, as whisky might be a tad too strong for lunch.
“Jimi Hendrix?” Draco raised an eyebrow before he smiled and walked into the kitchen. Harry followed him.
In his dreams, his brain had betrayed him, showing him tousled black hair and startling green eyes. He could still feel the touch of Potter’s beard against his skin from his dream and Draco wanted to throw something against the wall. For
He had just wanted to see him. To poke that long winding ache just a little, see if he’d still felt that stirring inside him at the sight of him.
Gemma Zabini nee Farley had married Blaise two years back, but now tried to avoid obvious nepotism by recommending Draco instead of Blaise to help her deal with Potter’s divorce. Blaise would honestly have been a better choice, though Draco says nothing about it. It annoys him that Blaise, who must have known about this from Gemma, hadn’t thought to warn Draco before Potter burst into his office.
“Draco!” Potter almost shouted, his eyes large and desperate, but Draco took a step back, scowling as he turned around and stalked off, leaving Potter in the street looking troubled. Draco didn’t care, didn’t give a shit.
“It was ten years ago, Draco…” Potter said, frowning. “I told you yesterday, I was frightened and confused. I… I didn’t fucking know better.”
Draco hardly daydreams about murdering his co-workers anymore and he finds that he can actually listen to what others have to say. He’s even sat through weekly lunches with Pansy for the last two months without completely zooning out, which in itself is an absolute miracle, if he’s being honest. He allowed himself several pats on the back for that alone. Their lunches are fulfilling and every time he laughs, he can see a sparkle in Pansy’s eyes that hasn’t been there since they were kids. He likes it.
First, divorce was more or less unheard of in wizarding society. You simply did not get divorced. Wizards and witches marry young and stay married, unless they separate and live as estranged, but you do not get divorced. It’s such a complex and drawn-out process, people more often than not fund it easier to just stay married and instead live separate lives.
. Yes, they’ve all got their own corpses in their mouths, but it’s easier to blame those where it shows, isn’t it? Those who wears the corpses on their sleeves - literarily. And go on then, Draco thought, blame him all you like. He doesn’t care anymore.
Draco knew he had a special look to him - either you loved it, or you found him strange looking. Most people either loved the strange, or they simply found him attractive. Androgynous, he’d been described as several times before.
“Very good, master. Liffy will prepare dinner for Mr. Potter as well.” Draco nodded and Liffy popped away.
“Draco…” Harry sighed, rubbing his temples. “Please, just answer the question. We… We have to start somewhere, right?”
, Draco sighs, casting a glance at his partner, before he lifts Albus off the floor, flicking a remaining crayon from his sticky and chubby hand, depositing the little beast on the kitchen table next to Harry’s divorce settlement papers.
He savoured the minutes to himself outside and when he returned inside, Potter was waiting for him at the bar, his green eyes following Draco’s every move until he sat down.
On the second day, an owl arrived to Draco. It was from Potter, inquiring about his health - though, not in those words, mind you. Fucking auror knowing everything. Draco crumbled the note and threw it in the fire, disgusted by his stomach’s fluttering reaction. Instead, he downed two glasses of muggle whisky along with a dreamless sleep potion and collapsed beside his bed.
Draco doesn’t comprehend what’s happening at first. But Potter’s hand is on his shoulder, then his neck - and then his lips are on Draco’s. It’s panic and lust and fright and every strange kind of unwelcome non-feeling come at once. Potter’s lips are too full against his thin ones. His lips are too warm against Draco’s cold lips. And at the same time, they feel absolutely wonderful and Draco can’t help but to kiss back. Potter’s tongue flicks against his lower lip and Draco opens up, accepts him inside. It’s been so long, so bloody long.
“And what says you’ll do the bloody fucking between the two of us?” Draco cut him off, furious with the man sitting arrogantly across from him. “What if I don’t enjoy being fucked up the arse?”
It was unfair. How did Potter always seem to get away with things? And why did his stomach still flutter, just from holding that awful little piece of parchment with those simple yet so powerful words written on them?
The whole first week had been a complete orgy of drunken anger, prostitutes and general debauchery. The fact that he still had a work to go back to, was a miracle in itself. Draco had felt ill the entire last week, depression from his bender pushing him into a bottomless darkness and for a while, he’d completely forgotten what was real and not. He couldn’t remember what he’d done at work, couldn’t recall whom he’d spoken to. It wasn’t until his crying mother had brought his father with her last Thursday and threatened to have him hospitalised, that Draco managed to snap out of his misery.
He got his second pint and they remained silent for a while, drinking and staring at anything but each other, which Draco was fine with. What he wasn’t fine with, was that Potter was in a gay bar - the very same one Draco used to get a quick shag when he didn’t want to put in much effort.
“Seems like it, yeah.” Potter shrugged and Draco had to remember to shut his mouth. Fuck this prick.
Potter seemed as if he was enjoying himself, being an uninvited guest who obviously didn’t give a shit about breaking social protocol. He looked more himself now, just as he had done in the pub. He had left his dark green suit at home and was dressed in blue jeans with ripped knees and a black knit jumper. Draco saw that Potter was wearing a slightly dented wrist watch on his left wrist. Instead of hands circulating around its face to show the time, there were golden stars.
Potter looks… Like Potter. His unruly black hair is messy and he looks as if he hasn’t shaved in at least a week. It pained Draco to admit that it suited him. He was dignified in his all-black auror robes and clothes, and it gave his tall, athletic body a casual but still uniform seriousness most people would find difficult to pull off. His green eyes were starkly bright beneath his round glasses, against his tanned skin and Draco hated it.
The Malfoys have been high on the ladder of status for generations. The Ministry’s attempts to seize their assets to repay wizard society after the war hardly even made a dent in their finances. Much of the assets were tied up in muggle investments and accounts abroad and the Ministry’s little inquisition to have the Malfoy’s make a free-fall from grace, did little to nothing. They might not be as influential as they once were - and for that Draco mainly blames his father - but the Ministry cannot and have not, managed to erase the Malfoys from society. It’s all just a game, of course, but a game to be played nonetheless.
It shouldn’t have surprised him that Arthur stepped out on the same floor as Draco and continued in the very same direction. It wasn’t until Draco arrived at the large wooden doors leading into the chamber assigned for the hearing, that he saw Gemma and took his headphones off. Gemma cast a glance Arthur’s way and gave a nod, before she shook Draco’s hand.
“What does that even matter?” Potter’s voice was rising and Draco couldn’t help but to feel enjoyment from egging him on, almost feeding on Potter’s indignant anger. Finally, Draco thought, something
Ignoring his rumbling stomach, Draco went to his liquor cabinet and poured himself a firewhisky before he went to put a record on the turntable. Bowie’s Diamond Dogs called to him with its bizarre, surrealistic cover and after skipping the first two songs, he sat down in his Jetson with his whisky and closed his eyes, just enjoying the dystopian hopelessness the music conveyed as he tried to just breath. Tried to come to terms with his reality.
He called it working, but in reality, he did little work. He learns, still, how to fit in. It was a entire science in itself, knowing what to wear, what to say, how to react and act depending on the company you kept. It’s all very shallow. Tailored suits and robes of the finest fabric, handmade inherited watches, ticking as time passes, and of course, routines for skincare to keep you looking young and healthy for as long as possible; all done to make it look as if not a hair is out of place. Everything to show your wealth, healthy living and first and foremost:
Standing in the en suite connected to their bedroom in the western wing of the manor where his family resides, Draco looked at himself in the large golden framed mirror.
Of course, Draco hadn’t thought of it, but it made sense Potter would have moved into 12 Grimmauld Place when he separated from Ginny. It just hadn’t crossed Draco’s mind. And it wasn’t as if they were neighbours. That would certainly have made things a bit too complicated - or, less, maybe. He couldn’t decide.
Draco shrugged off his robes, throwing them over one of the sofa in the living room, before walking over to the turntable and his albums.
Nothing else would be done for the coming two weeks. Gemma and Draco both needed to prepare for the hearing and Gemma told him she’d let him know if anything came up, but they scheduled a meeting for the day before the hearing - so that they could make sure everything was as it should.
“Have you eaten?” Draco asked as he poured a glass for Potter, deciding he might as well bring the bottle with him into the living room.
To get Draco to laugh, you either had to insult him to the point of absurdity, or actually come up with something worthwhile. It wasn’t Harry’s strong point, exactly. Draco was a complex person - and it wasn’t as if Harry was devoid of depth himself, he just didn’t think too much about things in general. Instead of thinking things over, he preferred to just act. Which, at times, had led to several ‘act first, think later’ situations - which hadn’t always resulted in a perfect outcome - obviously.
He was trying to calm himself. Trying to shut out the world around him so he could escape into his daydreams. Daydreams that are just that, unreal and wishes never to be fulfilled. Dreams of some kind of unattainable freedom far away from the life he’d been given to live. Dreams of an escape, of just telling the people around him to fuck off, of leaving everything.
Potter leaned his forehead against Draco’s, a sob raking through his throat. Draco turned his face away from Potter, looking out over his kitchen for a moment. The lights around them were dimmed, the whiteness of his kitchen laid in dark shadows that seemed to creep closer and closer, making Draco’s chest tighten and it felt harder and harder to breath. He just couldn’t take it. He couldn’t take it anymore.
He had allowed himself to spiral out of control, because he’d boxed himself into the misery of his own making, never allowing himself to confront the literal shockwave of feelings he’d pushed aside since Harry had pushed him aside.
“Since you own both properties together,” Draco continued, clasping his hands on the desk. Harry could smell the faint scent of cigarettes coming from Draco as he spoke. Harry had never liked the smell, but there was just something about that lingering scent that did something to him.
Maybe, if Harry hadn’t treated him like an old pair of knickers to throw away before, perhaps he could have blossomed into something less sociopathic as an adult. Something just a tad bit warmer.
“Right,” Potter frowned and sat down again, clasping his hands over his thighs. Draco desperately tried not to allow his eyes to follow.
The last few weeks had been strange for Harry. He’d moved into 12 Grimmauld Place the same day Ginny had told him about Shacklebolt. It had shattered him to begin with. He felt betrayed by not just his wife and best friend, but also by a man who’d been Harry’s mentor since he was a bloody kid. But it didn’t take long for Harry to realise that neither Ginny or Harry had been happy for a very long time.
Draco didn’t go far. Didn’t have to. He chose the first gay pub he knew of, a place he’d visited before just east of Mayfair and took a seat at the bar, ordering a pint. He tried to relax his shoulders and stop his sweaty cold hands from shaking from too much alcohol in the last few days. He wasn’t sure he succeeded. He wasn’t sure he cared.
“You don’t mean that, surely, do you Draco?” His mother said, looking over him with a falsely sweet smile on her lips. “Astoria, be a darling and tell the nurse we’d like some tea. You know how Draco gets in the mornings. Don’t you worry yourself, dear.” His mother’s eyes lowered from his wife to his own with clear warning in them. Draco shivered and looked up at the roof as his mother grasped his hand. When Astoria had left, his mother squeezed his hand. “She has to put up with enough of your indiscretions, don’t push her away further, Draco.”
Right now, Draco believed any number of years until the rest of his life would actually be worth it. He could imagine his hands around Potter’s neck, squeezing as he pressed him down on the floor. Potter’s face turning pink, red, then purple until it turned white in that typically unnatural way only dead people could, his eyes bleeding red.
He hated having to separate himself from Draco, but when he felt his hands pressing against his chest, Harry allowed Draco to push him away gently, even though he was reluctant to let go of Draco’s lower lip.
Ginny looked at him then, her fingers slipping in between his. “We’ll still be great parents to our kids. They’ll always be ours. We’ve made them, you and me. You’ll always be their dad. But I can’t live like this anymore Harry, and neither can you. We’re slowly smothering each other.”
It’s the last months at Hogwarts all over again. Potter with his arm slung around Ginny’s shoulders, snogging her in front of the entire school, while Draco sat at the Slytherin table, thrown away like the scary dirty secret he was.
Rolling his eyes, Draco cocked his head, pulling out his pocket watch and snapping it open. “Anyway Pans, I have a meeting at half past. We’ll have to continue discussing your shards another day.”
“I see,” Draco said. Before he had to think of something else, the record had finished and Liffy arrived with a pop, bringing their food.
“Easy there, tiger.” The dyke said with a sly smile, giving Potter a wink and Draco loves her and hates her and everyone inside this normally nice establishment that’s now polluted by Potter at the same time.
“Yes?” Draco finally managed to grit out, holding his chin high as he looked down his nose at Potter.
Draco gestured to the kitchen and rose. Potter followed. With another snap of her fingers, Liffy had prepared the table, plating the pasta for them both. She had brough newly baked bread, as well as Italian olive oil and grated parmesan cheese. The pasta was a simple affair, but smelled heavenly. Liffy knew exactly what Draco preferred, and he preferred simple, always simple. It was a light tomato sauce with diced guanciale, just a touch of white onion and basil. Draco accioed the bottle of wine from the living room and refilled his own glass and Potters, before thanking Liffy.
Harry was quiet, just watching Draco as he looked away from Harry, staring first up at the ceiling and then to the side. “I guess you could say I have a few issues in general.” Draco said, scratching the point of his nose with his thumb, holding the fag close to his face. “One day, I might wish to hurt people - anyone, for the sake of hurting them. To make myself feel better. The next, I just wish I could disappear. I’m not satisfied with my life, never really have been. People, generally speaking, are garbage - and I’m honestly tired of being around them.”
And, most important of all, Draco supposes, is that it’s just freeing not having to hide from everyone he spends his time with.
His own dastardly connection to Potter, unspecified as it may still be, weren’t much better, but Draco decided it was far from the same situation as the one with Ginny and Shacklebolt.
He didn’t even wait for Potter’s answer before he was outside, lighting up. The nicotine was a welcome distraction and the cigarette felt at home between his lips. Whyever did he stop smoking in the first place?
Malfoy? It would blow Ron’s head off. Good thing nothing’s come of it then, Harry thought miserably as he sat down on the edge of his bed on the third floor of 12 Grimmauld Place. He’d certainly done it this time, hadn’t he?
“Rumours which naturally are untrue. Part of yet another campaign by the Prophet and their gossip mongering tail to smear our family.” His father’s grey eyes stared into Draco’s and Draco had to hold his breath to keep from shivering. “I honestly do not care what you do in your spare time, Draco. But need I remind you that you
Potter had the decency not to follow him and Draco arrived back at his flat feeling exhausted. He leaned back against the door, his head swimming slightly - not from only from the alcohol - but from the absolutely bizarre and too candid conversation he’d just had.
When he arrived back at his flat to enjoy his Friday night with a neat record and a good book accompanied by a glass of Merlot, an owl was waiting by his window, clutching a scroll.
Maybe Draco could read his thoughts, maybe he could see the anguish, the longing, the fright - Harry didn’t know, but he felt as if he was about to collapse. Draco’s grip on his arm hardened, as if keeping Harry upright.
, as if his soul has been sucked out by a Dementor and replaced with nothing. It was all false, this whole existence - a play pretend of hamsters in their wheels just continuing on doing what they should because someone somewhere once told humanity and wizard-kind alike that they needed to do
“Listen,” Gemma said, looking at Potter, “It’s important you don’t give your assets away. I understand this is difficult, but these are
Draco raised his eyebrows, clearing his throat. “Well, as I am just that, I suppose you’ve come to the right place. However,” Draco leaned back in his chair and crossed his leg over his knee and made sure his face was cold, haughty. “Normally you’d book an appointment.”
“Excellent choice, Potter. Surrounding yourself with former Slytherins. I wouldn’t say I’d do it any differently.” Draco gave a somewhat sly smile as he wrote down several more details. He didn’t look up to see Potter’s reaction, but he remained silent, as if completely unprovoked by Draco’s jab. It’s a bit disappointing, but Draco ignored it. “I’ll contact Mrs. Zabini and set up a time for a meeting. She’ll also be able to send me the documents I’ll need to sort through your finances before I’ll be able to set up your funds and accounts according to the outcome of the divorce settlements.”
“I see him every now and again,” Draco said and Potter frowned, swirling the wine in his glass. “But you ask if I miss him? No, I wouldn’t say that I do.”
“Pot calling the kettle back.” Potter said with a raised eyebrow as he leaned back, looking all too amused for Draco to find it even remotely funny. "
“It bothers you, does it?” Draco asked and Harry wanted to deny it, but it just felt silly. Of course it bothered him. Sure, he could still see the slightly paler mark still left on his own left hand from a ring that’d been there for ten years.
“You deserve it.” Draco’s voice was a whisper as he spoke. He didn’t know how he managed to form the words. They pained him and at the same time, he was so angry he could have screamed if his body allowed it. It didn’t. He hardly heard his own voice.  “You fucking deserve it.”
It was obvious even for someone like Harry that Draco was dressed in an extremely expensive black three-piece suit that hugged his body in just the right places, with a hand-tailored robe resting over his shoulders. He wore golden cuffs by his wrists and a matching pocket watch with a chain that gleamed beneath his robes. He was still so pale he looked sickly in too yellow light and his eyes would appear bizarre if you were unused to them, but to Harry, he looked more like some bloody angel that you weren’t completely sure if he was truly a man, and it just didn’t matter. He had such fine features, slim hands with long fingers, thin lips with just a tad too much teeth behind them, which only ever gave his looks more character. And Harry had wanted him just as much in that moment that he had ten years ago, but been too cowardly to admit he did - and he still wanted him just as much as he walked away from Draco’s building.
He’d give his parents that, at least. They’d been lucky enough to marry out of love, even though what little love they still held for each other was well hidden and private, if it even still existed. Draco had no such luck. Astoria had been a desperate choice before his parents married him off to some horrid Rosier or - bloody hell - Goyle’s older sister.
Draco entered the lift inside Gringotts, refusing to take his headphones off as he played oblivious to those around him. He knew it annoyed several of his co-workers, but he just didn’t bloody care. He didn’t even take them off for his assistant already sitting at her desk outside his office. When she began speaking, he simply held a finger to his lips and walked past her.
“So,” Draco took a drink from his glass, savouring the taste for a moment. “You’re going to be a part-time dad now, then? Every other week and all that?”
As he ground himself against Potter, feeling their skin begin to slick with sweat and heat, and Draco never wanted to feel anything else. Never wanted to kiss another pair of lips, never wanted to fuck Astoria again. It was sick, the shallow life he’d lived for the last ten years.
His father cleared his throat as he walked and stood in front of Draco, setting a hand on his shoulder. “Well, enjoy yourself while you can, son. Just remember, no bastards.”
Draco gave Potter a glare before he stepped back from him, going over to the door. “Wait a few minutes.” Potter nodded, his eyes following Draco’s movements. “Until tomorrow.”
Draco felt disgusted as he sat at the too large dining table with his family. His father sat at the head of the table, dabbing the corner of his mouth with a napkin, his hair perfectly pulled back and bound at his neck and his eyes as empty grey as Draco’s own. The constant sneer was still etched to his face as he looked down the table at his family with disappointment in his eyes. What he ignored was that the failure he felt for his wife and son was of his own making.
He quit a couple of months ago, but it seems since Potter’s bloody wife decided she was in love with the much, much, much older Minister for Magic and wanted a divorce, he was again a smoker. Well, he knew an excuse when he saw it, but decided to not acknowledge it.
Draco didn’t know if Potter could see it in his eyes, but as he rose suddenly from the table, Potter rose with him.
Looking down at his pale, spindly fingers resting on the arms of his Jetson, contrasting the furniture’s dark leather with its unhealthy hue, Draco thought about how his life could have been great. He was born into a wealthy family, grew up on a large estate with enough friends and he was, at one point in his youth, close to his parents. But then everything went so wrong.
“Me and Ginny, we’re getting divorced. Considering my financial situation and the reasons for the divorce, I was advised to seek proper help with splitting the assets. I want to make sure our kids get their due, no matter what happens to me. I don’t care what Ginny does with her share, but I don’t want them to be left with nothing if the worst happens.”
“Um…”, Potter looked over the massive bookshelves filled to the brim with old, boring tomes of outdated financial advice and economics that line one side of Draco’s office. “Yeah. Well, I was advised by my solicitor to have a word with a financial advisor.”
After getting a handful hours of fitful sleep, Draco called for his house elf, Liffy, who brought him strong black tea with milk and buttered toast. Draco drank his tea still in bed and nibbled on the toast before he forced himself to get up and take a shower. The tea helped, but he felt like a miserable sod as he scrubbed his pale skin until it shone brightly pink.
”Mrs Potter might wish to include the worth of your London house into the settlement. Seeing as 12 Grimmauld Place is worth almost twice the estimated sum of Godric’s Hollow, I’ve prepared documents which notes the inheritance of 12 Grimmauld Place comes from your late Godfather. The issues here though,” Draco now frowned and pushed a parchment toward Harry, his fingers long and spider-like, “Should she wish to, Ginevra might claim closer relations to the Black family, through her paternal grandmother, which would make it easier for her to claim your London property, as you did not have a pre-marital settlement.”
Draco looked down on Harry and felt his chest tighten. He’d never really cared for other people, or their feelings. He’d never looked at another human being before and realised he loved their smile. Loved their scent and the way their skin felt under his fingers. The way their lips felt against his own, or how a simple blow job could make him feel something more but a desire to have the favour returned.
Harry wasn’t an idiot. He knew his money could sustain them for generations on, which they had already done for the Potters, and Sirius’ money had kept the Black’s secure for god knows how long. But it wasn’t right that Ginny would get half. That should go straight to his kids.
“For the love of god, Potter,” Draco hissed through his teeth, looking around with worried eyes, “Don’t fucking do this here, you arse.”
He puts on his coat and boots, circling his scarf around his neck and grabbing a pair of leather gloves before threading his hand through his now shoulder length hair.
“Do you want to date me?” Draco asked before he actually realised what he’d said. He was at once horrified with himself, feeling his cheek’s turn pink as Potter stopped chewing, just looking at him for a moment, before swallowing.
“In an hour, ta.” Draco walked through his white kitchen, trying to locate the bottle opener somewhere amongst the unnecessarily many drawers and white marble counters.
Walking from his spacious kitchen to his even larger living room, Draco put his glass of wine down on the side table beside his Jetson and walked over to his turntable, pulling out the Doors’ L.A. Woman and put it on. After that, he went into his bedroom and grabbed the book he had been reading for some time, but hadn’t gotten very far into due to…
“Of course.” Draco gave her a nod before he turned and left the restaurant, heading back towards the Leaky and into Diagon Alley again.
He should have left Ginny years ago. Before, when he read in the Prophet Malfoy was getting married. He should have left Ginny and gone to him - stopped that bloody charade from happening and just admit he’d been an idiot and that … That… He what?
With a pop, the old house elf materialised beside Harry, his crouched back and long nose making him look as horrible as his moods.
After another minute or so, he could see her physically shaking and he began to grow tired of looking at her. Draco gestured for her to leave. She just glared at him before she left, looking as miserable as Draco did in his bathroom mirror after a few glasses too many.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Maybe he regretted even asking now that it seemed Draco had decided on honesty for once. And still, he listened and watched Draco intently. Draco glanced carefully at Harry before looking away and continuing.
Opening the medicine cabinet, Draco removed a small bottle half filled with a softly pink potion. He shivered as he turned the bottle around in his hand, watching the liquid slosh around like a false promise.
“And why would I want to shag you to begin with?” Draco continued, “I gave you head once ten years ago and after you went completely mental, going on and on about you not being queer. I’m pretty sure I don’t want to go through all of that again.” Draco took a deep breath, glaring at Potter who’d now shrunk back against his chair, a much different expression on his face now. “Actually, I’m not just pretty sure - I’m dead sure.”
“No, you’re not.” Draco said, acid in his voice again. Draco pulls back, making space between them as he clutches his pint, crossing a leg over his knee to at least try to hide his erection. “You can’t just come ‘round, ten years later and suddenly you’re queer and everything’s alright.”
“Thank you,” Draco said and turned around, watching as Harry reached for a bottle of white and cooling it with some wandless magic. Nothing too boastful, or at least he hoped so. Draco didn’t seem to care.
“Off you go, then.” Harry said and Kreacher peered up at him, giving him a nasty glance before he disappeared with a pop.
Draco refused to sit. Instead, he calmly took off his coat and replaced it with his black, billowing robe, straightening his cuffs and checking his pocket watch.
Draco’s mother insist his father loves him. Draco does not believe her. Lucius Malfoy love only himself, if he’s even capable of that. It’s doubtful and in the end, it doesn’t matter to Draco anymore whether his father loves or not. If anything, it seemed to be another thing he inherited. The narcissism, the coldness and complete incapability to truly care for others.
And Harry had understood, he really did. Still, the shock of it all took some time to get over. He’d only every been with one other person aside from Ginny, and… he didn’t want to think about that. Not right then and there.
“Yeah,” Harry pulled him down and pressed their lips together, letting out a moan as Draco pulled back. “I want you to.”
It was too much and still all too painful. He didn’t want to touch it. He hadn’t touched it in ten years and he wasn’t about to open up that pandora’s box now either. This time, it was professional. Potter had come to him, asked him to act as a professional and Draco would do his job - and that’s would be that. Get it over with and then leave it in the past where it belongs, along with every other shameful secret he carried in the back of his mind - hidden and pushed away.
He failed to see the importance of them. Failed to remember, even though his mother insisted there were times when they were happy, when things were easier. But when was that? He's tried to recall more than two hundred times since the war (yes, he'd keep count). Aside from a pre-Dark Lord childhood, he fail to find the good memories his mother insisted on.
When Potter pulls away, Draco is left gasping, frightened, aroused and disgusted with himself for being so bloody easy. He shivers at the pained hardness in his trousers, feeling uncomfortable as his cock continues to grow, completely at odds with his brain.
Draco hadn’t answered his apology and it wasn’t as if Harry had expected him to. He might have held out hope, sure, but he didn’t expect anything. And still, standing there with both Gemma’s and Draco’s eyes on him, Harry felt as if he was about to shatter.
Instead, we found himself with Potter at 12 Grimmauld Place, and from there - it was as if Draco lost control for a moment. Lust, anger,
Harry himself hadn’t even bothered with his clothes. He’d arrived home, pulled off his black auror robes and then jumped into a comfy pair of absolutely ripped jeans and pulled a college shirt over his head, mussing his hair whilst at it. Draco didn’t look as if he minded.
He enjoyed travelling around Europe looking for art and he especially enjoyed spending time in Scandinavia. The minimalism from the 1960’s was a favourite of his and he’d spent a couple of weeks with a gorgeous Italian muggle who lived in Copenhagen last year, hunting for what was now his dinner table - a Danish teak classic in pristine condition from 1964. His mother thought him absurd and his father wished he’d just spend all his time in the manor, like a proper and respectable husband and father.
Draco’s hands reached out to Harry’s trousers, working at the fly and soon, he had a hand cupped against Harry’s straining cock and Harry had to pull his lips away from Draco’s, just to make sure this was what he wanted. To make sure it was okay. He wouldn’t hurt Draco again - didn’t want to be the arse anymore.
Draco bit into Harry’s neck and kept thrusting into him, reaching down and wringing the last of Harry’s come from his cock. Soon, his own movements were beginning to become erratic and Draco couldn’t hold himself back anymore. Grabbing hold of Harry’s hair and leaning down into his neck, Draco decided he would just let go. Let everything fall, so he could fall with it.
On the third day, Draco was about to go mad, so he packed his bag, kissed Astoria’s cheek whilst ignoring the way she winced from his whisky drenched breath, and left for his flat. Tomorrow was Friday and he wanted to at least check in at work before the weekend. He also had an awful meeting with several of his colleagues and the goblins. He didn’t look forward to it.
he’d focused on rebuilding his life, his reputation. He’d wanted to be normal, so he had done all he could to be normal - but it was pretentious pretending. His life was a sodding joke and it seemed as if Draco was the only one who wasn’t laughing.
Draco arrived early and had a good thirty minutes to speak with Gemma alone before Potter showed up, looking all too bloody handsome, something which made Draco even more angry.
Draco growled to himself, sitting down angrily in his chair, pulling out his iPod again and going through the songs as the anger inside him bubbled like water boiling in a kettle. Lou Reed gave way to the Stooges, if only to give in to the anger, at least mentally.
“Now I’m confused,” Potter put his fork down and sat both elbows on the table, ignoring Draco’s glare, leaning against his hands as he looked at Draco intently. “We’re alone, eating a gourmet dinner and drinking wine. This is a date.”
“You don’t have to tell me. Bloody hell, I’m having trouble enough keeping my mouth shut at home. It’s a blessing Potter’s so wealthy someone in finance had to be involved as well, just so I could talk to someone else about it.” Gemma stole a cigarette from his etui without asking, lit it and inhaled deeply. “Would have had to go see a priest if it wasn’t for you.”
Harry was sure Draco had put his napkin on his lap, whilst Harry just kept it beside is plate. But he tried not to speak with his mouth full, at least. No matter what Draco called him, aunt Petunia had drilled some manners into him, Harry just didn’t care. However, it was obvious that Draco did, so the least Harry could do was to keep his mouth closed as he chewed. His elbows, however, were still on the table, because - well, just because he could.
The small smile gracing Draco’s lips was beyond beautiful and Harry was certain he swooned, which was embarrassing. “Yes. I’ll try not to ignore your owls, hm?”
The clock above sounded and Draco followed Gemma into the large chamber. Potter met his eyes for a short moment before they sat down, Draco to Gemma’s left and Potter to her right. Ginerva was sat with her solicitor and father - and the rest of the table was filled up with barristers and the undersecretary.
as Matron Anna padlocked it shut, leaving Draco in complete and utter darkness, terrified. His breaths started to come out in short, quick pants, and there was a tingling on his back that felt like a million spiders running up and down his spine. Tears trickle down his face and he clenched his eyes shut, hugging his knees to his chest. He doesn't bother trying to scream and fight to be let out, he knew from experience that it would be useless and a waste of energy.
"Is it true?" He asked, allowing Draco to grab onto his pinkie. "What they're saying? That the Dark Lord is
The three men turned and walked back down the street, Sirius Black mounting his motorcycle as he flew back to his family, glad that the Potter's were safe. Severus Snape apparated back to his office at Hogwarts, pulling open his liquor cabinet and pouring himself a generous helping of firewhiskey, allowing himself to indulge, just this once. Dumbledore clicked his silver Put-Outer once and the orbs of light returned to the street lamps. He spared one last look at the bundle lying outside the orphanage's door.
A low, sibilant hiss rang through the room and the snake that had previously been sleeping inside the grandfather clock slowly uncoiled and rose so that it was eye level with Draco. And then, somehow, impossibly, the hiss translated into perfectly understandable English.
Speak of the Devil and he shall appear, Severus thought wryly. He pushed himself off the bricks of the building and walked towards the tall figure that had just cracked into appearance next to the motorbike, cancelling his Disillusionment Charm as he moved.
"It's when, uh, when people eat or touch or breathe in things that, that their bodies don't particularly like, I suppose," he said, trying to find the right words to explain properly.
Matron Anna gave up on trying to hit the owl, taking a small to catch her breath. When she seemed to have regained her strength, she lifted her spoon and pointed at Draco, shooting him a glare of pure loathing.
Using his spoon, he fished the letter out of his bowl and pinched the corner of it with two fingers, letting the clumps of porridge still on it fall back to join the rest of the slop.
. He scrambled up immediately, diving towards the closing trapdoor with an outstretched hand to try to prevent it from shutting.
Severus and Black shared a look and nodded, seeing the merit in his words. Dumbledore set down the carrier gently, putting his hand into his cloak and withdrawing an envelope, slipping it inside the blankets.
"Wicked, I thought so. What was that thing you did with you wand before? When you did that swooshy thing at the door?"
Severus knew she was lying because he had made up the school ten minutes ago. It was obvious that Malfoy hadn't been receiving proper care at the orphanage, from the fact that the Matron was willing to forgo any of the proper procedures required when looking after a child and not do any background checks on imaginary schools, but it was convenient for him so he would ignore it.
"I should probably name you," he said, thinking aloud. "I've been calling you 'the orb' for way too long now."
Draco buried his head in his hands. He was grateful that he had light, but he had been in the attic for
Draco frowned. "What's wrong?" He whispered, worried, gently petting the snake's coils that were loosely wrapped around his neck like a scarf.
Severus nodded, his face souring more than it already was, and waited until she left the room. Once the door had clicked shut behind her, he slid his wand out of where it had been hidden in his sleeve, casting a quick locking spell and a
"What?" The snake replied, the outline of her curled-up form just visible. She wasn't a large snake, and fit rather well around his neck, using the hood to hide her tail.
." The snake seemed to think that that explained everything perfectly, though Draco was still confused.
The trapdoor was not open. The source of the light came from a small floating orb that hovered in front of Draco, shining with a steady blue glow, cheerfully swaying from side to side.
Also, should the Draco's glow-in-the-dark orb friend have a name? And if so, what should it be? I'm thinking either Orbeez or Bob the Blob. Lol, kidding. But do let me know what you think in the comments!
"Good afternoon, Mr Snape," She said in an oily voice, her smile never wavering. Severus nodded in response and took a seat in front of the desk, subtly sliding his wand out of its holster, hiding it in the sleeve of his Transfigured suit.
And then, all at once, the darkness dissipated. The back of Draco’s eyelids was painted a bright fleshy pink instead of the pitch-black they had been before, something that shouldn’t be possible in the dark attic.
"Another human is coming," she said, her tongue flickering in and out as she tasted the air. "It's the female one from before. I don't like her." Lux bobbed up and down in agreement, and Draco felt the fear dissipate as if it were never there. It was replaced with the welcome warmth of relief because finally, finally, he was going to be let out.
Draco sneezed, the sound echoing through the attic. He resisted the urge to rub at his watering eyes, the itch getting almost unbearable. He had hoped that he would be able to avoid agitating his dust allergy, but considering the fact that he was stuck in an attic that probably hadn't been cleaned for a good few decades, it seemed inevitable that five minutes after he had found the snake living in the grandfather clock, his allergies had started acting up. His face had swollen up, and he would bet his left kidney that it had turned splotchy and an unattractive shade of red.
