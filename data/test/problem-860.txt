The ladies nod, and Harry doesn’t think he imagines the tiniest flicker of remorse on Danica’s face. Draco boots Montague gently towards the table and sits in his leather chair, releasing the handbrake and nudging the bus back onto the road.
Draco doesn’t look away from the road but the surprise is clear in his eyes and his fingers tighten almost imperceptibly around the wheel. He is silent for so long that Harry is ready to give up, and then he nods.
He looks at Draco, who is looking right back, slicing into a carrot baton and slowly lifting an eyebrow in a way that makes Harry’s stomach pull tight.
“I think we should,” Luna says quickly, and all eyes swivel to fix on her. Most of her colleagues merely seem curious, but Sam’s expression is full of suspicion. She looks right into his eyes and takes a running jump. “You said that if I could find a way to raise money then the children could have a piano.”
Ten minutes later, the strings are soaring and the company is now divided into little knot of sharks and swans, all swaying and gliding and snapping to the music. Luna watches them, offering encouragement and half-drifting into a daydream about lakes and sharks and water plants with minds of their own. Neville has bred some Indonesian grasses that spin their own webs to catch flies. She wonders if her father remembered to print the advertisement feature for his nursery in this month’s
“Yes,” she says, turning to check on Rose, “and as far as they’re concerned, I’m a mad person. Why wouldn’t I tamper with my own memory to make them look bad?”
Draco laughs. He touches Harry’s face with his fingertips and then gets to his feet, finishing his coffee in two gulps.
William’s eyes turn shrewd. “Youse’re worried that you’re taking advantage? Has she no got ye doing wee jobs for her?”
“They’ve got the tree up in the town,” Danica puts in. “They had some kind of singer come to switch the lights on.”
Draco takes one of the books from the box and flips through it, expression of disenchantment growing with each page.
Over the next few days, he holds firm. He goes to the studio, he goes home, he goes along on Pansy’s diabolical social outings, during one of which he drinks a little more than usual and ends up alongside Pansy, grinning like a loon in one of the Prophet’s occasional ‘look who’s falling out of a nightclub’ photo-collages. He turns up early to work (even on the morning he has a raging headache and a shocking sleep deficit), he argues with Pansy, he plays the records, he reads out the comments and he notes with satisfaction the rumbles of weary dissatisfaction from the lates which tell him that the coffee switch is taking hold nicely.
“Lovely.” Harry opens the door and nods to Mr Borteg, who doesn’t seem the slightest bit surprised to see them. “Just going to the office. We won’t disturb you.”
Harry takes a long breath of cold air, weighing up the thrill in his chest, the fullness of his stomach, and the spark of an idea that wriggles inside him as he gazes at the frosted cobbles.
“She did, but it didn’t matter. Someone like her disappears and five more spring up to take her place,” Harry says, and Draco stares at him as he paces, imagining reporters growing up out of the gap left by Skeeter like some sort of vile journalistic hydra.
“Mum and Dad are here somewhere, and the rest of them,” Ron says, and he looks around just as the lights go down.
“My mother,” Draco sighs, clearly torn between exasperation and affection. “She had a cat who was hurt at Hogwarts in an accident. She would never allow me to take mine with me in case the same thing happened. Of course, now she’s off picking flowers and chanting, I can do what I like.”
Not then and not now. She lowers herself to the bank and sits, allowing her feet to dangle in the rippling water as she flips through her book and smiles at her photograph of Draco. It’s her favourite one of him, tacked onto the page with a piece of glittery Spellotape, and shows a struggle between stern disapproval and genuine laughter as two small children leap upon the unsuspecting Draco from behind and almost bear him to the ground. She cannot see the glimmers of colour in the photograph, but she remembers them perfectly from the moment when she took it, standing out in the grounds of the Starlight Home for Children just weeks earlier.
Harry doesn’t believe her strident tone one bit, but either way, the chickens are coming out of the oven. In a rush of delicious-scented steam, Molly carries the chickens to the counter one by one and sits them both there in their roasting trays, gleaming and topped with crisp, herby skin. Harry shifts in his chair and gazes at them, stomach grumbling. Beside him, Ron lets out a small groan.
Feeling contented, Draco hangs his coat up on a rack of luminous cat collars and makes himself at home.
“The funny thing is, they all seem to think Draco is wonderful,” Harry says, shifting Hugo’s weight on his hip and refilling his unspillable cup with warm milk. “I know you haven’t met him, but you’re going to have to trust your Uncle Harry on this one. He is definitely not wonderful.”
“It’s you,” he mumbles, staring at Draco for a moment and then walking past him onto the shop floor.
The four of them clink glasses and Ron excuses himself to collect the shepherd’s pie from the oven. Harry stares at his wine without really seeing it, feeling as though he’s been knocked off his broom in midair. He doesn’t know what exactly is surprising about this feeling, but it’s almost too much to contain, and Marius’s warm laughter beside him makes his heart hurt with longing, closely followed by guilt. He seems like a nice man, and it’s certainly not his fault that Ron and Hermione are relentless and that he is keeping things from them.
Officer Kettleworth finishes his currywurst, clearly amused. The second the last morsel has disappeared, Draco flicks his wand and Harry jumps, all at once surrounded by a cool, clean sensation that ripples pleasantly over his skin.
“Well…” the man sputters, looking around for support. “It could be any of them! It’s not like we know them.”
“Good. Try not to talk in your sleep too much; I’m going to need all the rest I can get if I’m going to spend the entire day surrounded by Weasleys.”
“Good for her,” Horace says when she returns to him and explains. “My first magic was taking all the water out of my grandfather’s swimming pool… while he was in it. A little bit of fire is a lot more easily fixed.”
Startled, Harry turns to him. “You mean you’re…? For god’s sake, Draco, it’s been twelve years,” he hisses.
“So did I,” Harry admits, closing his eyes and remembering how the final goat, a stubborn madam who had required an entire trip across the hills to herself, had attempted to make a run for it just inches from the barn. Harry still isn’t quite sure how they managed to get her inside.
When they reach the bottom of the alley, Draco slows. Harry sails past him for several bouncy steps and then backs up.
By the time his next customer arrives, he has written down the name of every business and owner on Diagon Alley, drawn a little sketch of the street and added notes for each of the crime scenes. Feeling a little more organised, he shakes away his misgivings and attends to his work, deciding to give Draco until lunchtime before he starts talking to people without him. He sells several hampers, numerous bottles in shiny festive bags, and takes an enormous order for a Ministry Christmas party that makes Mr Borteg so excited that he goes next door and comes back with a whole bag of crackleballs.
Harry and Draco exchange glances. Already feeling the rush of adrenaline in his veins, Harry turns to Officer Kettleworth, unsurprised to see that he looks utterly terrified. Harry touches his shoulder gently.
Harry’s head hurts. It’s not a stabbing pain or even an ache, it’s just a blunt sort of pressure that has wrapped around his skull and settled there, squeezing slowly and pouring an irritable dullness into his sinuses. His neck gripes in protest at every position he tries, and every part of his body is so cross and heavy that his pillows feel like rocks and his mattress seems to push back against his bones whenever he stays in one place for too long.
“I know,” Draco says, and then kisses Harry with such slow, teasing care that his heart swells painfully and he has to wrap his hand around himself and grip almost hard enough to hurt to avoid coming all over himself with a whimper.
Twenty minutes later, the atmosphere in the kitchen is rather strained. Hugo, either through hunger or boredom, has become tearful, and Rose’s best efforts to cheer him have fallen flat. Molly is pacing, looking out of the window every couple of minutes and repeatedly asking Arthur if she should Floo to Diagon Alley and look for her son.
Harry grabs an end and watches as Draco casts a wordless charm that travels along the string of lights in a glowing pulse, filling the air with a sharp clicking sound before lifting the tangled ball into the air and releasing it in a loose, neat wave.
“That’s mine,” he says, dropping the wreath back into the crate when the sharp leaves prickle at his fingers. “Go and find your own breakfast.”
“I never joke about food,” Draco informs him, and takes one of the sandwiches from the bag, leaving the other for Potter. “Why pineapples?”
As the banging and scraping finally comes to a stop and the utensils are collected by Mary Ann, Luna finds that she can, as predicted, still hear the unholy racket. She sticks a finger in her ear and wiggles it about, hoping to somehow dislodge the ghost of the sound, but it’s no use.
“He was brave and strong and rebellious... all those things that you are, Harry, and he ran away. He looked at what was happening around him and he fucked right off. Because he had to.”
“We do have a map of the street marked with everyone’s whereabouts at the times of the incidents,” Harry says. “You can come and have a look once you’ve finished that.”
“They should cover anything important,” Draco finishes, catching up to him in three long strides. “Florean keeps all the notes at his shop. He’ll be closed now but we can get them from him first thing in the morning.”
“It was an arrangement, that’s all. I helped them to pass some of their classes and they helped me to not have the shit beaten out of me,” Draco says, offering the words easily and without emotion.
Harry swallows hard and takes the jar, swiping his fingers through the contents and releasing the scents of lavender and mint into the room. He doesn’t look away from Draco once as he pushes his fingers inside him, stroking and stretching, and Draco looks right back, pushing back at him with a breathless smile as his cock flushes and jerks against his stomach. All at once, Harry wants to go slow, to drag this out, to keep Draco just like this, hard and wanting and his, but he knows they can’t last. Not today.
“Mrs Cook had better watch out,” Hermione says, tipping the carrots into a pan that looks a lot like the one she uses to make the horrible soup with the weird things floating in it.
,” Caroline says in a stage-whisper, cutting off Luna’s train of thought and diverting her attention to the back of the room, where Eliza is bouncing up and down with delight and Draco…
Harry nods weakly and steps inside, barely pulling his coat out of the way as Draco yanks the doors closed behind him. He drops his coins into the scoop and reaches for the curtain, sensing that he will have a warmer reception from the ladies.
“Are you hurt, sir?” Officer Kettleworth asks, taking out a brand new notepad and a pen, which he promptly drops.
“It’s just... this whole thing is ridiculous. Since when do teachers interfere in our relationships? What gives them the right? What gives any of these people the fucking right?”
“‘Potter and Malfoy’s Secret Love—was their rivalry just an act?’” Draco reads aloud, brow furrowing. “Give me strength.”
“A bit of a warning would be nice,” he says, brushing off his coat and heading back to the shop with his carrots bumping against his thigh.
“Furious?” She laughs bitterly. “I’m raging. MLE’s on the case and I’ll tell you what, Harry, when they find who did this… they’re going to be sorry they ever crossed me. Now… a black coffee and…?”
The swan stretches out its long neck and hisses at him. He shuffles backwards on the cold stone surround of the fountain and realises he can no longer feel his backside. He looks at Mrs Purley and wavers. She’s a strong woman, obviously fit from running her little café practically single-handedly, and there’s something in her face that suggests she wouldn’t take any nonsense from a swan.
Harry smiles back and says something, anything; he has no idea because his friends have finally chosen someone who seems wonderful in every way, and all he can think about is Draco. About his stash of
“This is amazing,” Hermione says, walking through the bottom deck and looking around at everything: the chandelier, the tea set, the quirky armchairs and the paintings of Juno.
“Yep,” Harry says, swimming slowly to join him. “Looks like our friend Angus is a very grumpy trout.”
“You’re early,” she says, and her smile is real despite her tired eyes. “Black coffee for Mr Borteg, and what will you have today?”
Behind the counter, Mr Borteg makes an odd rattly sort of sound and becomes very absorbed in polishing the till.
“It measures pressure in the atmosphere,” Danica says. “We thought we could hang it up in the bus and see how long it takes to explode.”
“We knew there was someone, but you weren’t going to admit it on your own,” Ron says through a mouthful of mashed potato.
“I believe the ladies have just brewed a fresh pot of tea,” Draco says, startling Harry out of his thoughts. “If you’ve quite finished staring at me.”
Luna joins them, losing the worries of the last few days in the voices of her friends, the scrape of the violin and the piping of the flute, the warmth from the setting sun and the multicoloured glow of happiness that fills her garden with light.
That night, he climbs the ladder to his attic, hits his head on the loft hatch and carries the decoration box carefully down to his living room, where he promptly drops the whole thing on his foot. After a minute or so of hopping around and swearing, he stands and looks at his tree. Rose has chosen a Norwegian spruce that just about fits in the front window of number twelve, its top curving at an odd angle where it touches the ceiling. It’s a little bit too skinny and the branches are uneven, but it smells wonderful and Rose likes it, so it’s just perfect.
Harry snorts. “I love you,” he reminds Draco, warmth spreading in his chest when he feels himself being stared at.
He doesn’t know quite how to feel about any of it, and as such, decides not to think about it at all.
Harry takes a deep breath. “I need to find a way to persuade Draco to take some time away from the bus. He needs another driver, but I’m not sure how I can help with that beyond offering to pay for one, and I know he won’t take my money. The thing is, he’s very attached to these ladies and the bus is the only place they’re not alone. If I could find somewhere else they could meet… maybe a day or two a week… I could…” Harry trails off when Molly turns around and stares at him, hard.
“Did you really think I’d get bored of seeing this?” he laughs, shuddering when Draco wraps a slicked hand around his cock and strokes him. “Did you—
Harry steps closer to get a better look at the object Draco has picked up and is now glaring at as though willing it to explode.
Refreshed by the morning spent in the park and then stuffed full of roast chicken, vegetables, and Arthur’s mixed berry crumble, Harry sleeps deeply and rises early, not at all surprised to be the first to arrive at the Burrow to meet the others.
Harry turns, opening his mouth to ask another pointless question, only to find that Draco is already halfway up the stairs. Intrigued, he follows, pausing to look around the second deck and its collection of comfortable brass beds before realising that Draco has once again left him behind. Feeling oddly wary, he climbs to the top of the second set of stairs and stops dead, fingers wrapping tightly around the rails in his surprise.
When Mr Borteg stops talking, a comfortable peace fills the little wooden cocoon of the shop. For several seconds, all Harry can hear is the scratching of Rose’s pencil crayons and the howl of the wind up and down the alley.
Draco doesn’t look at him but his little smile is rewarding. And irritating. “It says that I’m a man of excellent taste.”
Harry snorts. “I wanted to tell them when we were actually in the same room. Fortunately, they’re several thousand miles away from the nearest
Draco snarls at the engine and blasts it with a spell that makes Harry taste metal in the back of his mouth.
The main entrance to the Daily Prophet building is grand and imposing, the tall double doors flanked by gleaming sculptures: to one side a golden quill, to the other, a silver scroll. Draco pauses to let a young man with a camera bag exit the building, regretting it instantly when he stops and stares.
Feeling a little dejected, she leaves, Apparating into her garden and finding herself almost knocked backwards by the roar of voices that greets her. She stumbles, blinking, and immediately her vision is flooded with colour. Something yellow moves towards her and steadies her with an arm around her shoulders, and suddenly she can see scarlet and sea green in the crowd, fuchsia and silver and vivid blue, each colour distinct and glowing and each belonging to someone that she loves.
Diagon Alley is bustling with early morning shoppers but they manage to find an empty bench in a patch of warm sunshine. Draco sits, carefully not touching Harry, with his hands in his lap. Harry stares down at Brenda, who is attempting to wind her way around the bench. For a long time, neither of them says a word.
The sky outside the windows is grey and the fog has turned into a downpour, but the Burrow’s kitchen is warm and comforting even to Harry’s fragile nerves. He is alone, sitting in a sturdy chair at the scrubbed pine table and idly watching the hands of his watch drift towards eight in the morning. Molly’s wall clock lists almost all the Weasleys as ‘in bed’, with only Molly’s, Arthur’s and Ginny’s hands pointing elsewhere.
Something about the collective sigh from the group tells Harry that this isn’t the first time they have heard Thora’s opinion on the subject. He hovers by the curtain, waiting, and wondering if Draco’s silencing charm isn’t at least a little bit because of Thora’s rather grating voice.
“I don’t think I’d dare,” Harry admits. “Did you really want to do detective stuff or were you, in fact, lying to your mother?”
“In your fucking dreams,” Draco mumbles, wondering if calling Potter by his first name will actually make him more forthcoming, and then wondering if he’s really still here for an explanation. Of course he is, and not just because the alternative is rather disconcerting. “In your fucking dreams, Harry,” he says, a little louder than he means to.
“We saw three magpies and a big spider!” Rose says, taking off her coat and hurrying to stroke Kingsley as though he might disappear at any moment.
Harry notes the flimsy footwear of Angelina’s bridesmaid and shivers in sympathy. Beside her, at the top of the aisle, the bride looks radiant, and her wellies do nothing to detract from her beautiful lacy dress, her long, dark hair glittering with jewelled pins, and the smile of sheer delight on her face when she looks at her husband-to-be. George, too, looks surprisingly debonair and as proud as can be to be holding the hand of the woman he loves.
“Only when they’re frightening the animals,” Draco points out. “Do you really think a man who hand-raises Kneazle kittens could cause so much destruction?”
Harry opens his eyes and stretches, smiling as Draco’s bedroom swims into semi-focus around him. He feels around for his glasses, finally locating them in a tangled heap of clothing on the floor beside the bed and pushing them onto his nose. He is alone in the bedroom but he can smell coffee and hear a rumble of voices from the television beyond the wall. Reluctant to leave the warmth of the bed and the gentle morning sunlight, he burrows under the quilt until he hears the distinctive flap of Needle’s webbed feet against the floor, at which point he decides that he might get up after all.
“She’s a very intelligent young lady,” Draco says, and though his face is tight with worry, there is a real, rather promising smile for Harry.
“Oh, that’s a lovely idea,” someone says, and Luna turns to see one of the teachers hovering in the doorway, arms full of exercise books.
“I don’t think you want to try,” Harry says at last, and though he smiles as he shakes the editor’s hand and thanks him for the retraction, there is an awful lot of steel behind it.
The girl from the market who had been speaking turns to shush Shan but then stops, transfixed by the note. She holds her hand out for it and Shan lets it go, returning to her tropical sundae.
Draco sighs. “I’m not sure what to do with myself now. I feel as though I put so much into being a detective that I can’t remember what I used to do with my time.”
“Speak for yourself,” Ginny laughs. She stands, somewhat unsteadily. “All hail Malfoy, for he is omni… omni… erm, he’s everywhere and does all the stuff, and that’s good because…” She pauses, staring down at her stomach as it grumbles loudly. “I
“You’re going to be useful right here, Draco,” she says, selecting a record for the warm-up and smiling with her back to him.
“Some company would do her good,” Shan says, voice tinged with exasperation. “I’ve got her upstairs in the flat, drinking Pepper-up, but I think she’s got cabin fever already. She’s got books and all sorts but you know how she gets when she’s bored.”
“You’ve let yourself down, Marmaduke,” Esmee says softly, and just for a moment, Harry sees the blow hit home.
By the time the three of them have finished cataloguing and photographing both scenes, the socks have gone off five more times, and Harry has thrown in the towel completely, singing along with Timothy at the top of his lungs. Draco, who insists he doesn’t know the words, regards them with a soft sort of amusement that seems to wash away almost all of Harry’s sadness.
“Everyone is fine, but it’s all a bit of a mess,” Draco says. He hesitates. “I thought we’d seen the last of it, too.”
It is, Harry supposes, glancing at the clock, only half past nine, but Draco has been hidden away since the end of yesterday’s meeting and he doesn’t know whether to feel irritated or concerned. Despite his better judgement, he actually misses the frequent interruptions and the constant flow of bizarre whisky-related questions. It makes no sense that there should be a request to find a signature whisky of all things and then… nothing.
“Don’t…” Draco manages, somehow pulling his features into line for a fraction of a second and then losing it again, suppressed amusement spilling from his lips in a cascade.
“Well, it’s...” He looks more closely and wonders if he’s going mad. “It looks like a tape measure. In the shape of a trout.”
“I’d ask what I’ve walked into but this seems about right,” he says, slamming the back door behind him. He grins at his mother. “Sorry I’m late, Mum, has the stress sent you over the edge?”
She doesn’t, of course, because he is trying. He is so far out of his comfortable place that she can almost taste it, but he is doing it anyway, and she thinks she might just have to hug him once this session is over.
“Draco, it’s the Prophet. They aren’t interested in you as a person. They just want to boil you down to something that sounds snappy for people who are reading the paper before they’ve even had their first cup of coffee.”
“Absolutely,” Harry says, listening to the whistling of the kettle with quiet satisfaction. “It wouldn’t be Christmas without a swan trying to eat my clothes.”
“I hoped I might have imagined it,” Ron mumbles, face flushing violently. He brightens. “Does that mean that Ginny really did try to steal a chair from the Leaky?”
“You, silly,” Molly says, pulling out the roasting tray and setting it to stand. “I’ll make sandwiches, shall I?”
Harry turns, almost colliding with a waitress. “Sorry,” he mumbles and she smiles at him, carrying her steaming plates over to one of the spindlier tables. When he realises where the voice has come from, he walks slowly to the far corner of the dining room, feeling suddenly nervous.
“That’s a bad Needle,” Draco says, peering down at the swan, who is poking his head out from behind Narcissa’s robes. “He can come with me now. I’m going to open up in a minute and he’ll be sad if he can’t wander around and nibble at people while they eat.”
“I’ve got money,” he says, digging in his coat pocket. He catches Draco’s eye and adds, “Can I still get a toothbrush for fifteen Sickles?”
As far as Draco knows, Potter is an unremarkable mad person who is friends with just about everyone, works in a glorified pet shop and, if the gossip columns are to be believed, has had affairs with everyone from Ginevra Weasley to old Tom from the Leaky Cauldron. If Draco is completely honest, he has no idea why everyone is so obsessed with the man.
“Okay. I think we deserve a nice lunch to celebrate your first victory over the Daily Prophet,” he says, wondering if Harry is in the mood for something spicy and hoping it isn’t too late in the day for Mr Wong’s. He has no idea what time it is and he doesn’t think he has ever cared less. His mouth hurts from smiling and he is sparking with adrenaline, exhilarated by the rush of adventure.
The next morning, Draco arrives at the studio feeling rather pleased with himself. Harry is starting to warm to him, which can only mean that he’s getting closer to the truth, he has had an excellent night’s sleep, and in two to three days he will be the proud owner of a large Muscovy drake from a highly reputable breeder. In an irritatingly excellent display of customer service, Harry had spent the best part of an hour walking Draco through the various catalogues and then submitting his order by owl. He had been polite and helpful throughout the process and had only once looked as though he was going to lose his composure, and he had had the good grace to nip into the back room to ‘look for something’.
In reality, there will be nightmares and there may be a shivery little figure attempting to climb into her bed in the early hours of the morning, but she asks for the tranquillity in the hope that something, somewhere, might grant it. She’s never really minded getting up in the night, anyway. Her father taught her early on that adventures do not always wait for daylight, and being friends with Harry over the years has only confirmed that.
“This is really happening to me,” he mumbles, feeling as though his heart has swollen impossibly and is lying smashed up against his ribcage.
Stanley, who has now decided to direct his apologetic dance at Harry, tacks loudly and spins in a circle. Draco knows that he didn’t mean to break anything, he’s just made that way. A strange, chaotic being, much like Harry. At that thought, he smiles and draws his wand, focusing all his energy on raising the broken shards of the pot and clicking them back together in a flash of yellow light. Next, he spells all of the spilled soil back into place and then carefully levitates the plant to sit in it. There doesn’t seem to be any permanent damage, and he thinks his peace lily will live to see another day, but now he’s hotter and wearier than before, and he knows that he will have to do something to amuse that sodding beetle before he mischiefs the castle to the ground.
He returns with the Orisha cube and sits on the edge of the desk. “Alright, Elegua, let’s try again.”
“Yeah. Well, you and Hermione are our experts on all that stuff, and if you’re not there, we’ll be at a bit of a disadvantage. Percy’s read a lot of books, though, so it makes sense to pick him next,” Ron says.
“Shh, now, Mummy’s sleeping,” he whispers, and to his astonishment, Hugo’s cries seem to soften, just a little bit.
“Behave,” Charlie teases, just as Kingsley emerges from under the table, steals a whole chicken breast from his plate and runs upstairs with it.
“Hello, Horace,” she says, offering her hand to pull him in. He takes it, and with one hard tug, he and his enormous bag are safely in the room. “How are you?”
Harry follows his eyes over to the set of little pigeon holes and sighs. “Forms to fill in, so you can get a passport or a driving licence or insurance... look, shall we buy something to eat?”
The snow is still falling heavily when Harry leaves for work on Tuesday morning, and by the time he reaches Diagon Alley, his trousers are wet up to his knees and his vision is swimming with the swirling flakes. Disoriented but determined, he struggles on, wavering only when the savoury aroma emanating from the café seems to tighten around him like a lasso. His resolve crumbles in seconds, and when he sets off again he is in possession of two hot cups and a foil-wrapped bacon sandwich.
“We know he’s a strange young man,” Eilish says, lowering her voice in spite of the silencing charm. “He’s dedicated… solitary…”
She looks up from a rather involved stretch on the arm of Corrie’s chair and regards Draco with her head on one side and her ears twitching. After a moment, she sneezes and then settles down to sleep.
“I doubt you’ve had time,” Harry says, imagining the restaurant in uproar as kitchen staff, customers and Malfoys alike are terrorised by a furious swan.
“Louis!” Molly cries, beaming at him. “Would you like a job? Why don’t you fetch the big gravy boat, I think we’re going to need it.”
“Shut up,” Harry mutters, but he smiles anyway and only resists a little bit before telling Draco all about his evening, including all the bits that he knows will make him laugh, roll his eyes, or both. By the time he gets to the part about Ron arguing with the quizmaster over the difference between beetles and Beatles, Draco is using one hand to cover his face and the other to protect his coat buttons from Needle.
Luna accepts a large bouquet of sunflowers and thanks Horace, amused to see his shoulders already twitching to the music.
“Of course. If you want to be a teapot, all you have to do is believe it,” she says, and within seconds, the room is filled with a whole variety of kitchen-themed interpretive dances.
Harry instinctively looks for Montague, quickly finding him sleeping at Ida’s feet, paws and nose twitching in silent dreams. Juno, disinterested in both the sausage dog and the idea of rest, walks up and down the dashboard, rubbing herself against the steering wheel and then springing onto the back of Draco’s leather chair.
“You’ve lost your mind,” Seamus says hotly as he stomps around, dressing for bed. “I can’t believe you’d be friends with that bastard. You’re mad. If you ask me, you should see a—”
“Just one more thing,” Harry shouts, and much to Luna’s relief, everyone falls silent. “I know how much you like to dance, Luna,” he begins, shooting her a crafty look that makes her think Draco has already told him the truth about the potion. “So, here’s my present to you—The Rainbow Eels!”
“I’m glad you agree. And, you know, it’s the not knowing that bothers me. It’s not that it matters what Malfoy does or why he does it…” Harry sighs and rubs at his face. He fixes Hugo with a conspiratorial eye. “Okay, it does matter a bit, but I’m not sure why, and I’m not asking Mummy and Daddy because no doubt they’ll tell me why and I don’t really want to know. Do you know what I mean?”
“Er… yes,” Draco says, just as thrown off balance by the change of location. “A single malt… a single barrel if possible.”
Harry looks over his shoulder at the map. “He couldn’t prove where he was for any of the thefts. He always just said he was in his shop.”
“Are you having a funny turn?” Draco asks, watching over the top of his paper as Harry leaps to his feet, no longer able to control his body, and dances his way energetically around the courtyard.
“You make no sense,” he mumbles, dropping behind the counter and rummaging for something to write with. “You make absolutely no sense, Draco Malfoy, and you need to stop it.”
Five minutes later, he settles cross-legged on the hearth rug with his steaming mug, letting the sound of the carols drift around him as he breathes slowly and watches the sun come up. Just for a moment, he feels warm, content, and perfectly calm, and then he wonders what Draco would think of his decorations and all at once his heart is attempting to climb into the back of his throat.
“Well, Needle here followed me home after my last attempt to return him to the park, and he made it clear that he was going to stay,” Draco says, the faintest flush creeping into his skin. “He chose me, so to speak.”
Then again, the swan in front of him doesn’t look furious at all. He looks impressive, with his elegant stature and his beautiful white feathers, but there is no malice in the little eyes now and the sharp orange bill is neatly closed as he fusses around Draco’s trousers with quiet contentment.
She sips her coffee and smiles to herself, thinking of Hermione’s flushed delight when she’d finally had her article published in the
“I don’t know. I just like them because they’re soft,” he says, and Stanley pushes the last cotton wool ball into his lap. Perhaps he’ll need it.
They find Narcissa out in the garden, long pale hair fluttering in the breeze as she sweeps her wand slowly around the table, creating a shimmering bubble that shatters each snowflake into fine glitter on contact. She smiles to see them but holds onto her cast, drawing the spell carefully along the table until it seals itself and settles with a shiver.
When they find themselves back at the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes stall, Luna is thrilled to find that all of the buckets they left there have been filled almost to the top. There are mostly Knuts, as people have wanted to get rid of their loose change, but she can see plenty of silver Sickles, too, plus a surprising amount of gleaming gold Galleons.
Harry smiles to himself, thinking of Eilish, Danica, Ida, and Corrie, of Audrey and Thora and Mr Barleycorn, wondering what they have chosen to do with their busless day and if they know just how much their driver cares for them. He hopes they do, and he has the very strong suspicion that they care about him right back.
The swan responds by punching a hole in the cardboard and hissing through it. Alarmed, Harry picks up his pace, determined to reach his destination before the whole thing is torn to shreds. By the time he steps into the Leaky, the swan has managed to poke its head through the top flaps and is eyeing everyone in sight with pure malice.
Her smile is comforting, reminding him of Molly and making him feel, just for a moment, as though he’s safe and warm and has nothing to worry about.
“Not if we hurry up,” Harry says, and flings open the doors of the bus. “Ah. I’d forgotten about that.”
“Harry,” someone calls, and he squints through the rain to see Jean on her doorstep. “Have you got a minute?”
“Thank you for doing the chairs,” she says, flicking her wand to open the prop chest and then the cupboard that contains the record player.
It’s just the sofa. Molly and Arthur’s sofa. He also appears to be wearing his dress robes, no doubt crumpled to hell, his shoes, and a hat that doesn’t belong to him. The matter of the warm, gently breathing thing sprawled on top of him remains uncertain, but there’s something about the smell of lemons and—he thinks—gin that stirs his memory.
“Harry, I know you don’t always make sense, but if you’ve bought a cat and you’re keeping it a secret… well, that’s strange, even for you.”
“Over here?” Harry asks, indicating the wall where Rosa’s picture of Draco, Professor McGonagall’s Christmas card and his own drawing of Stanley hang in pride of place.
Harry grins and holds out his hand to her. She takes it and he squeezes tight, knowing that she won’t want to hold his hand forever. She’s already impossibly grown up for an eight-year-old, and he feels as though it won’t be long until she’s reminding
Harry stares into silvery-grey eyes at close range, heart hammering against his ribcage. Draco leans closer and kisses him, slowly, fiercely, and something inside him snaps.
Hurriedly, Harry retrieves his cards and attempts to spell away the bent corners. In a flurry of movement, envelopes are distributed around the table and before long, he has a small pile in front of him, each with his name written in green or red or gold script. Following the example of Draco and the biddies, he opens each one, admires the picture and reads the message before setting it aside. Each card has clearly been chosen with care, and he can only hope that his own choices are up to scratch.
“That’s better,” Draco murmurs, pulling Harry on top of him and kissing him slowly, so slowly that Harry’s whole body aches and his cock twitches and leaks against Draco’s belly.
Harry laughs. “God, no. The more the merrier. Anyway, they aren’t giving them away. They’re two pounds each. The kids have decided to give the money they make to an animal charity.”
At the sound of muffled voices, Harry turns, just in time to see a small group of first and second-year Gryffindors creeping towards them across the grass.
“What exactly do you mean by ‘civilised’?” Daraja demands, taking the words right out of Harry’s mouth.
The sky is almost completely dark now, but the lanterns glow softly and the band plays on, seemingly tireless. Luna’s father is still jigging around energetically, as are plenty of the others, but Luna is happy, just for a few moments, to watch them and drink in the atmosphere of her first proper party.
The cabin is almost completely dark, and Harry immediately begins feeling around the walls for light switches but finds none. The floorboards creak under their feet as they move around, Harry managing to stub his toe on something extremely solid a fraction of a second before Draco casts
Enough is enough, Harry thinks, steeling himself for another attempt at capture. All he has to do is get it into a cardboard box and take it to a suitable place. A place where swans are free to bite other swans and everyone can keep their fingers. He’s being public spirited, really. And swan spirited. After all, nobody wants to be pelted with pears. The fact that it’s almost three o’clock and he has to go into Muggle London anyway is just a bonus.
The smile surprises Draco, and he realises that he doesn’t remember the last time he saw Potter smile, even in a photograph. It’s a good smile, broad and slightly lopsided, the sort of smile that makes a person want to smile back, even when they are trying not to. Draco scowls.
“We’re the only family she’s got,” Draco snaps, and there’s something about his ramrod posture, his hands on hips and his air of don’t-even-try-it defiance that makes Harry’s heart roar with approval.
“Perhaps another time,” Draco says with a smile that feels like a promise. “When I don’t need to drive the bus.”
“No… well, yes… but I’ve just remembered I’m having Ron and Hermione over to my house tonight,” Harry sighs, feeling very regretful indeed when Draco catches his mouth in a kiss and he is helpless to do anything but kiss back.
“I don’t not want to, either,” Harry mumbles, pressing into the touch and reaching for Draco’s mouth. “I want to. I want you.”
“I also shouldn’t have taken so long to come back and say that, but that’s the thing, Draco, I’m useless with all this and it’s just better if I don’t do it.”
“It’s the main part,” Ron says with obvious pride. “And Rosie was the only one who knew all the lines. She’s been so excited about the whole thing that she’s learned everybody’s lines.”
Irritated, cold and soaking wet, Harry turns to stare at him. “You’re the one who agreed to it! Why do you think she gave you the fucking key?”
“Hello,” Draco murmurs, shifting position on Rose’s desk and then seeming to notice her presence for the first time. “Sorry,” he adds, getting up and making room for her without ever looking away from Harry.
With a sigh, she picks up her notebook and begins to write. She had, of course, suspected that there would be a difference in the reactions of crows and stubborn young men, but she’s not sure she wants to risk Harry and Draco tearing apart the office and then losing consciousness. It looks like ordinary Cheering Charms will have to do. She still has plenty more things to try.
He dashes off into the living room and returns with a bottle-shaped present that draws a questioning look from Draco.
“We’ve both put extra security measures on our doors and tills,” he explains. “I think they got in by breaking the windows under a silencing charm. Look at this.”
“These are not pieces of a soul, sir. The representation of the Orisha is pure energy. They are not hurt and they cannot hurt you.”
Harry laughs, lifting his hands to press against his heated face. Luna pats his shoulder in commiseration. He doesn’t suspect her for a moment.
Juno leans over his shoulder, long whiskers brushing his face, as though waiting to see what he’s planning to do.
He’s a mess. He’s exhausted, covered in cracker crumbs and his hands shake when he reaches for his tea. And yet, when he thinks about the stupid lying bastard, his heart still aches and his stomach still fills with heat.
“We’ve only got a couple of minutes, Ida,” Draco says, dissolving his own charm with a flick of the wrist. He glances at Harry.  “Hmm?”
“Thank you for rescuing my beetle,” he says, ignoring Harry’s snort of amusement and attempting to retain an air of dignity. After all, it might be the only bit he gets today. “Thank you for not eating him. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to take him back to the castle now.”
Harry stares after her, scrubbing at his messy hair and then looking down at his scruffy outfit. When a tall, handsome, well-dressed man follows Hermione out into the garden seconds later, he decides that there’s only one thing for it. He’s going to have her murdered.
Draco stares at him, mind racing. He doesn’t really know why he’s still here. All he knows is that he doesn’t want to leave. In the end, he just says the first thing that pops into his head.
Something heavy rests in Harry’s stomach. He looks at her expectant face and sighs. Pretends that Draco isn’t staring holes into the back of his head.
“Let me look at that,” Draco insists, shoving a pair of shears into his trouser pocket and setting down his mug.
He opens an eye and two beady black ones peer up at him with an odd sort of affection. Amused, Harry rests a hand on Needle’s back.
“It does,” Ron says, kissing her on the cheek and smiling beatifically as she gets up and heads inside to attend to Hugo. He turns to Harry, fork held aloft. “Now, tell me everything before she gets back.”
“I don’t know… they all use the same fucking sacks?” Harry sighs, wishing for just an ounce of the bravery it would take to walk across that floor and kiss Draco senseless.
Eilish sets the owl down on the table and removes the letter tied to his leg. Juno jumps up to sniff at his feathers and he takes off, flapping for all he’s worth, colliding with the chandelier and coming to rest in the overhead luggage rack.
“This is Tewkesbury,” Draco says, gesturing vaguely. “That is the river Severn, and this…” he grabs Harry’s hand and pulls him around to the other side of the bus, “…is the annual Christmas Eve bonfire.”
Something ripples on the surface of the water and Draco’s stomach turns. Without another word, he forces himself over the muddy grass and down to the edge of the lake. A second tentacle breaches the surface and he thinks he might just be sick. The Giant Squid is always hungry, and a Stanley-sized treat would probably go down very nicely, especially if it were to leap into the lake so willingly. Horror-struck, Draco stares at the swirling water for a fraction of a second and then wades in, wincing at the temperature, shoes slipping on mounds of shifting pebbles. He’s going to have to go in, and he’s going to have to do it now. The water is freezing and heavy with algae and he’s not entirely convinced that the squid won’t eat him, too, but he has to get Stanley back. He has to.
Stanley says, and climbs up onto Draco’s lap. Slowly, Draco looks at him, at the waving antennae and the ink-spotted shell and the little multicoloured footprints all over his trousers.
He wants to tell Draco to stop it, that he’s doing it all wrong, but he’s attaching the lights exactly the way Harry always does it and a good deal more neatly, too. He wants to hate Draco and he’s not sure why, but he thinks that what he really hates is the fact that he doesn’t hate Draco. He likes him. He likes having him around, even if he now does come with a swan, and perhaps even more because of it.
“Where the bloody hell did that come from?” Harry demands, trying to peer into the darkness without success.
“It’s one of those tentacula hybrids,” Harry says vaguely as Ron hurries away and leaves them in the middle of the chaos. “That’s what I got Mr Borteg. Felicity said they needed good homes after what happened… some of them had gone a bit weird. I thought I’d hang it up over his desk.”
A smiling nurse meets them at the entrance to the children’s ward and introduces them to every patient, including the ones lying motionless beneath floating bags of sleeping potions. The sight of them and their gathered families makes Harry’s festivity waver, but the excitement of the rest soon brings it back to full brightness, and he finds that even the parents and siblings of the sicker children seem lifted to see the gifts and cards and chocolates from the residents of Diagon Alley.
“Messages from the rest of yesterday’s show.” She flicks them across the desk at him in two piles, one small and one large. “Support for your campaign of doom on the Prophet, questions about you and Potter, many of them obscene.”
“In that case, let’s go,” Draco says, pulling Harry close for the jump and utterly failing in his attempt to resist kissing him again. And again.
Feeling dubious, Harry obeys, and the moment his hand touches the polished wood, an outline appears, followed by a soft click as the little compartment falls open. Inside, an improbably wide selection of fruits are packed into the small space in a riot of colour and delicious, heavy scents.
Ron and Rose disappear into the flames but Hermione hangs back with Hugo, scrutinising him with an intensity that is familiar but no less unsettling.
“No,” she laughs, “but if you stick all that lot here next to the till, you can go and get whatever it is you’ve just remembered you’ve forgotten.”
,” she interrupts, drawing out his name with a light shiver. “This won’t take a moment... come with me.”
“I told you she’d forgotten,” her father laughs, squeezing her to his side. “Scatterbrained, this one. I’ve no idea where she gets it from.”
“Are you going to dance with us?” Benny asks, flopping onto his side on the floor and staring up at Draco.
Ida shakes her head. “It’s alright. The original Mrs Skower was my mother-in-law, you see, and my husband was her only child. I’ve been left with rather a lot of money and, to be honest, I’d much rather give some of it to Draco than let those ungrateful children of Henry’s have it.”
Harry smiles at her. “Thank you. So… we looked at a lot of different angles and eventually realised that the person responsible had to be someone from the street. Someone in this room,” he adds, and the ice cream parlour erupts into a cacophony of angry protests.
“I wanted you to be able to try our whisky,” he says as Draco peels away the wrappings, smiling at the swan patterned ribbon and then frowning at the bottle.
“Come on, Caroline,” Mary Ann says. “Let’s go and speak to Mr Lovegood. I just know you’re the best person for the job.”
While the other ladies have welcomed him to the table with genuine pleasure, Thora seems to regard him as… if not a completely unwelcome interloper, certainly an object of suspicion. She sits squashed into a corner, clutching the flask of black coffee she has brought from home and screwing up her face whenever the teapot is proffered. Most of the group seems to ignore her odd behaviour and engage her whenever they can, but Corrie, now working on a new blanket in bright red yarn, seems to regard her with equal distrust.
Luna turns, along with several other people in the vicinity, first to look at the cart and then at Caroline.
“No, laddie, it’s my father’s, but he’s too dead to interfere,” the woman says briskly. “It’s just behind the trees and down the slope, you’ll no miss it. If youse need more wood for the fire, I’ll bring some up from the cellar when youse come for your food. If I’m no here, ask for Gertie. Gertie Campbell.”
“I’m an old man, Harry. A job like this needs a quick mind, or, even better, two,” he says, smiling.
“Are you laughing at my earmuffs?” Draco demands as they reach the skate stall. “It’s bloody freezing out here. Literally.”
Luna frowns. “I don’t know. I thought perhaps it was about the dancing... because...” She leans forward and lowers her voice conspiratorially. “It was me. I put a potion in his drink when he wasn’t looking.”
“Maybe because she thought I looked responsible, unlike people who Apparate off to the middle of nowhere without a moment’s thought,” Draco snaps back.
“We knew he couldn’t sell the stuff around here without raising suspicion… what if he was just hanging on to everything until he could figure out what to do with it?”
“I’d like to say that I had nothing to do with this,” Hermione says, but she is clearly trying not to smile.
Draco rustles the pages, and when he begins to read again, there’s a smile in his voice that Harry can feel, even with his eyes closed. Feeling utterly at peace, he drinks his tea, strokes Needle’s soft feathers, and listens.
“You thought she wanted...” He pauses, snorting with amusement and then emerging from beneath the towel, mouth stretched into a grin. “You thought she wanted to have her way with you.”
“If you say so, ’Mione,” Harry says, but he clearly doesn’t believe her any more than Draco does. “Listen, I have to go. I’ve got a customer. I’ll speak to you soon, I promise.”
“Bill’s covering today,” Harry says. “He was as furious about what happened to Hermione as I was... told me to take a couple of days off.”
“Should we look at the scene?” Harry asks, reluctant to see what the thief has done to either business.
“You shouldn’t make assumptions,” Hermione says, and then sighs. “It’s fair, though. What are you going to do next?”
Harry catches his confusion in an instant. He has never realised just how many cupboards there are in the Burrow’s kitchen, and if poor Louis has to start trying them at random, their lunch is going to be cold by the time he finds the gravy boat.
“In which case, why are you trying to light the wood?” Harry asks, and Draco gives him a filthy look but alters the position of the match, which is now rather close to burning his fingers.
At the sound of the words ‘Dragon Spirit’, Harry scrambles onto the bus without hesitation. He has been talked into testing several of the local drinks Charlie has brought home from Romania over the years, and he remembers this one particularly for its propensity to make him take complete leave of his senses. The last time he had ventured a single shot of Dragon Spirit, he had walked into the Leaky Cauldron, declared his undying love for Tom the barman, and flung himself across the bar, weeping, when Tom had refused to run away with him. At least, that’s what Hermione had told him, and she very rarely lies. Ron had insisted that he had also performed a striptease for the patrons of the Leaky, but he does tend to embellish his tales.
“That’s wonderful,” Luna says, itching for her notebook and already wondering what she can come up with to nudge Ginny’s happiness up another level.
“You’re shivering!” she says, directing him into the kitchen chair closest to the fireplace and flicking her wand at the kettle. “Why didn’t you Floo in, you daft thing?”
“Around the back of the…?” Harry attempts, and Draco fixes him with an exasperated stare, even though he would actually rather like an ice cream right now.
“It’s got all this diagnostic magic built into it, and all these different settings for fixing engines,” he says, words just spilling out as he begins to panic. “I think it works… I mean, I tried it and set my curtains on fire, but I think you’re probably only supposed to use it with a… what?”
With what looks like a massive effort, Needle clambers onto Rose’s barrel seat and pokes his head through Draco’s arm until his knobbly beak protrudes.
When they come back, it is, according to Sam’s schedule, time to begin. Luna takes a deep, fortifying breath and climbs up onto George’s stall. She wraps her fingers around the top spar and feels for the strings of the balloons, allowing herself to pretend that they are pulling her gently skyward as she gazes down at the sea of little faces and the curious glances of passing strangers. Lively music is already being piped down the alley, and the reporter with the Wizarding Wireless Network is loudly counting down each minute to the start of the eclipse, filling the gaps with astrological trivia and news updates. The Starlight Home for Children is going to have to make a hell of a racket if they want to be heard.
“Well, that was special,” Draco says flatly. “I think the last time I was hexed by a first-year... I was also a first-year.”
“I will certainly try,” Patrick says grandly, swallowing half of his pint in one gulp and bathing them both in a beatific smile.
As Rose and the other birds arrange themselves around the eel and the piano starts up for another song, Danica leans over and whispers:
“Oh, Mr Spain?” Danica says, pouring a cup of tea for Harry while the bus seems to be behaving itself.
“I suspect I probably am,” Mr Borteg agrees, voice dipping into a particularly sombre range. “And what are these?”
“Don’t be, it looks better this way,” Harry says. “Sorry, Esmee, I just have to ask Draco something.”
Luna says nothing, secretly thinking that Draco should consider himself lucky. If Deb had been here, instead of at home with the dodgy prawns, he would never have heard the end of it.
“Ah. People who eat and people with grandmothers… two more things to cross off the suspect list,” Harry says, grinning.
“My Orisha told me that there would be difficult times ahead, but he also told me that if sufficient spirits joined together to fight, the darkness would be overcome.” Daraja regards Harry calmly. “There are more than sufficient spirits in this street.”
He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care if Draco buys something or doesn’t buy something. In fact, now that Draco thinks about it, he hasn’t cared for quite some time. He can’t remember the last time Harry told him to make a purchase or bugger off, and he can’t remember the last time he pressed Harry for answers about his campaign of madness. It’s just been lunches and animals and the two of them, spending their afternoons together because that’s just what they feel like doing.
“Just to clarify, we are talking about you?” Draco says before he can stop himself. “In the third person?”
“If you’ve given her one drop, I’ll… I’ll report you to the Ministry,” the woman says, face starting to turn slightly purple. Behind her, the door swings open and the bell tinkles softly.
Harry doesn’t catch her mumbled spell, but it’s a practised movement that draws the string up from the desk until it rears there like a drunken cobra, then shoots forward without warning and threads itself through each pearl in turn. Finally, the bracelet glows with the purest white light and then clatters back onto the counter, fully intact.
“Go,” Harry says firmly. “Have a brilliant time and bring me back something ugly with glitter on it.”
It’s not as though Harry is an experienced skater, but he’s tried once or twice before and his balance is strong from years of flying. After a few false starts, he is able to skate around the rink with barely a wobble, and as his confidence builds, he opts to loop at a moderate speed and watch everyone else’s efforts. Unlike Draco, whose usual elegance of movement does not translate to the ice, Florean skates like he’s been doing it all his life, and perhaps he has. He spins and jumps and snakes between the other skaters, drawing laughter and admiring glances.
“Don’t write yourself off,” Luna says, giving the letter back to her. “I think they’ll be very impressed with you. And when you’re playing professionally, I’ll come and watch you. I could get a new hat!”
“Who’s having ice cream?” someone asks, slamming the office door behind them and adding: “Sorry I’m late.”
Outside, the wind howls and the raindrops hammer through the hole in the roof and into the bucket. Draco sighs heavily.
In the end, Harry takes the bottle nearest his hand and downs half the contents. Each swallow is painful, but within seconds, he can feel it working. While a pleasant warmth seeps through his veins, the uncomfortable heat of his skin is soothed away, leaving him sticky but otherwise comfortable. The potion is spicy and familiar on his tongue, as is the sensation of clarity that surges through his sinuses and allows him to take in a deep, gasping breath for the first time in several minutes.
“I have to go,” he says, and there’s a tug in his voice that makes Harry both disappointed and relieved. “They’re seven hours ahead. I’m supposed to be speaking at this ridiculous conference in about twenty minutes, and I think we both know I can't go looking like this.”
This just sets them off giggling again, and all he can do is wait. There’s no way they can know anything about the situation with Draco. He’s pretty sure. And yet.
Harry waits, and this time he hears it. The front door of the restaurant, opening and closing, and then the sound of footsteps and excited chatter.
“You will have to wait a moment, I’m in the middle of writing a letter to the Minister for Magic,” she says, and Stanley doesn’t know what all of those words mean but he has heard that tone of voice plenty of times before.
“It is not hot, there is an open fire and you are wearing a coat,” he says evenly. “I haven’t seen the swan’s face because, as you well know, I didn’t realise the swan was back until about two minutes ago. Are you honestly suggesting that I should do something about it?”
“It’s just pearls and a string, right?” Shan says, and Miss Lister opens her mouth to protest. “I don’t mean it like that. I mean that it’s a simple construction. If you don’t mind letting me have a go, I think I can put it back together for you.”
“The other thing is… I don’t think I’ll be able to make lunch today,” he says, and Molly fixes him with a stern eye.
“We did this when Eilish had her funny eye,” Danica confides, taking out her wand and ducking behind a pillar.
“Weasleys don’t have inside voices, you know that,” Harry says, grinning, and follows her into the house to find Ron stirring something on the stove and looking so much like his mother that Harry has to bite his tongue.
Needle ambles after them, only biting Harry’s fingers once as Draco lets them into the restaurant and locks the door. He releases Harry with a look that says ‘Be good. Both of you’ and then leads the way upstairs. The flat is in complete darkness with only the faintest sparkles from the street flickering like fireflies against the windows. The air is warm on Harry’s cold skin and smells comfortingly of firewood. He breathes it in and pushes the day away, already feeling as though he could curl up on any available surface and sleep for a week.
The ladies greet him with enthusiasm and Montague, who has been licking up tea from a saucer near his feet, plants his paws on Harry’s knee and lets out an impressive sneeze.
Harry frowns and goes to peer at the object. “Oh,” he says, rubbing at his hair in embarrassment. “After the… er… well, I wrapped a load of stuff from the shop so it looked like we had presents under the tree. Did you just… collect everything?”
“She needs rest,” the nurse says firmly. “I have other patients to attend to now, so if you’ll excuse me?”
and everyone scrambles to their feet, adjusting their robes and heading for the door, leaving only Fred and George behind. After the warmth of the kitchen, the icy air hits Harry like a slap to the face, but once they have found their seats he is pleased to discover that the whole area has been magically warmed. The snow remains on the ground, however, and when Angelina starts up the aisle on her father’s arm, he is amused to see that she has abandoned her fancy wedding shoes for a pair of glistening, pure white Wellington boots.
“I should get back to my patrol. Thanks for lunch and… you know,” Kettleworth says with a sheepish smile, “… basically doing my job for me this morning. If we can keep sharing information, that would be brilliant.”
Eilish either doesn’t hear or doesn’t appear to notice, so focused is she on peering into the instrument, and when she lets out a shriek of surprise, everyone around the table jumps.
“What are you going to do about him? You can’t leave things the way they are. Apart from anything else, you look ill,” Esmee says.
“No, that just means that we’re all mad,” Draco says, pausing as both of them watch Florean take off his apron and carry his own ice cream to his seat.
“I am full,” Draco says, equally sternly, and for a moment, they both regard each other steadily over the tops of their glasses.
“That means it’s accidental magic,” Otis says, leaning over to her. “You did it! You’ll definitely get your Hogwarts letter now.”
“Draco, I can assure you that no one at the wedding will give a shit about whether your robes are fashionable or not,” Harry says, rubbing at his cold face with equally cold fingers. “And besides, everyone will be looking at the bride. No one will be looking at you.”
“One way or another, it always is,” she says. “You go and have a think, he’ll do the same, and in the meantime, there are plans to be made.”
“I am the manager, Malfoy. If you’d like to speak to Bill, the owner, you’ll have to wait until tomorrow.”
Mr Abernathy catches a chunk of her hair in his beak and tugs it in clear reproach, but then accepts the cherry and retreats to the balcony to eat it. Sensing that she has been forgiven, Luna watches him for a moment and then turns out the lights. Tomorrow, she will be working the night shift, and it hasn’t taken her long to learn that one cannot be too well-rested for these occasions. As sleep pulls her under, her mind is filled with images of Harry and Draco, bathed in yellow light, running amok around the home and flinging pumpkins at one another while Mr Abernathy looks on, dressed in paisley pyjamas and a purple top hat.
“Congratulations,” he says, throwing his arms around Shan. “It was beautiful. I think all the good luck charms worked, didn’t they?”
“Maybe it was a big eel,” Harry offers, gazing down into the water around Draco. He laughs, suddenly struck by the memory of a conversation. “Maybe it was Angus!”
“When you’re ready to stop being so disgustingly bigoted, perhaps you might consider that all three of these stalls arrived in the alley on the same day,” Draco says, stepping out of the crowd. “Are you going to accuse the face painters and the sweet seller, too?”
“Is that it, Mr Potter?” the editor demands, dropping his hand to his side. “The Daily Prophet is not in the business of handing out retractions to every disgruntled reader who walks into this building. I concede that, given the evidence you have just supplied, the comments made about Ms Granger were incorrect, and –”
“Could be worse,” Harry mumbles, reaching out to touch a spot on Draco’s hip, where a strange patch of red and gold fabric seems to have meshed itself into the black.
“I don’t suppose you want to talk about your hair,” he says, remembering just in time to drop the scowl and adjust his face into a neutral expression.
“Aren’t you going to sit with us?” asks a lady with a heavy West Indian accent, and Harry turns to her.
“I told you those weather forecasters always get it wrong,” Harry says, tipping his head back and catching a snowflake on his tongue.
Luna isn’t surprised. They are both pink with exertion, with laughter, and with a healthy dose of embarrassment. Of course, the real discomfiture will come when the Cheering Charms have fully worn off, but this is definitely a start.
, of course, plenty of people have ridiculous names, but something about it won’t quite leave him alone.
She sits in absolute silence as Harry tells her about how Draco came to take over the Knight Bus, smiles as he explains all about the biddy club and their outings, and barely raises an eyebrow when Harry gives her a stumbling, heavily-edited version of his friendship with Draco and their recent argument. By the time he stops talking, the tea in their cups has gone cold and the kitchen is full of the warm smell of roasted meat.
“I promised myself I would not,” she sighs. “I have already had too many things from the sweetie stall and I am getting fat.”
“Take a giggle break,” Mr Borteg’s bracelet says loudly, and a ripple of laughter passes around the table.
When the bus pitches up and the doors open, he boards with a heavy heart. The driver’s seat is empty. Puzzled, he closes the doors and steps beyond the curtain.
“My mother has some of those,” Draco says, amused. “Sometimes she uses my bathroom and it looks like a pixie exploded in there.”
She isn’t worried as such, but Harry’s absence does prey upon her mind a little, and when the staff team gather the children the following day to announce the final total and he is still nowhere to be seen, she begins to think that something may be wrong. Perhaps she has meddled in his affairs a little too much. Perhaps he is angry with her, or worse, with Draco. Still, she smiles and stands beside Sam as he tells the children that they have raised enough money for a piano as well as a selection of other musical instruments.
“No,” Harry says, knowing that if he stays even another minute he’ll do something impulsive and stupid. “I can’t do this, Draco, I just can’t. I’m sorry.”
,” Draco amends, and there is a twist of heat in the pit of Harry’s stomach, just as Draco kisses him.
“I didn’t realise he’d gone anywhere,” the woman admits, and in spite of himself, Harry is amused to see Draco’s eyebrows shooting up into his hairline. The customer bites her lip, apparently hiding a smile, and heads for the door. “Well, thank you for your help, Harry,” she says, and then is gone, leaving the door open behind her.
Draco stares at him for several long seconds. One of the children drops their cup and covers the tiles in a splatter of juice and ceramic shards. Luna cleans up the mess with her wand and quietly supplies a new cup of juice without Harry or Draco seeming to notice her.
The last Christmas crackleball, Harry notes, and though there is no way he can stomach a Cherish confection right now, he is touched by the gesture.
Draco splutters on his beer and Harry just stares at the old woman, head full of lurid and terrifying images. A cabin by the loch sounds wonderful, but he’s not quite sure he’s prepared to pay that kind of price for it.
“He was a bit strange, actually—the Egyptian man,” he admits. “He was very nice but he would only talk in whispers because he thought there were goblins in the walls… listening.”
He still remembers absolutely nothing about the whole fiasco, and if it weren’t for Hermione—once again an unhelpfully reliable witness—he might think Ron had made it up for his own amusement. Still, he never thought he’d see the day when Ron and Draco shared a joke, and all things considered, he doesn’t mind too much if it’s at his expense.
“They can do without us for a few more minutes, can’t they?” Draco says, and he smiles as he lifts his wand and selects a particularly battered parcel, rewrapping it in a flurry of silver paper and finishing it with a delicate, rainbow striped ribbon.
“We do have a kettle,” he says, shivering and pulling the blanket up to his neck. “We just like to support the café, as you well know.”
Luna isn’t even a little bit surprised by his perceptiveness; so often, children just know things. Still, she feels slightly sorry for Harry and Draco for being outsmarted by an eight-year-old who thinks green vegetables are his mortal enemies.
“For his ‘signature’ whisky?” Harry asks, sketching derisive air quotes, but Mr Borteg just wanders back into his distillery without another word. “Fine,” he says loudly, uncapping the heavy pen and returning to his notebook.
“I do,” offers someone else, and Harry whips his head around so quickly that he fears his head might fall off. It feels quite delicately-attached as it is.
Once Harry has managed to convince Hugo to accept the first mouthful, the rest is easy. The huge, wracking sobs soon settle into hiccupy breathing and then almost silence, and when the steam begins to pour from his ears, Harry knows he has won. His temperature is already coming down when Hermione lifts her head and frowns.
Grinning, everyone but Harry raises a hand, while he merely buries his head in his. Draco joins in, too, but Luna can see his anxiety as if it were written across his face.
“Yeah, okay… oh, god, what am I going to do with Rose?” Harry groans. “She’ll need picking up in an hour.”
Harry opens his mouth to retort but Draco is already kissing him, and he thinks he’ll leave it alone.
The cat chirrups, shakes some of the snow from her coat and barrels off in the direction of a stone footbridge up ahead.
“Maybe you’re cross because you work too much,” Harry says, pulling out the photograph of the Scottish landscape and gazing at it.
Harry doesn’t really blame him. He doesn’t know what Draco has done to the swan but however well behaved he might be these days, he still has the capacity to look pretty fucking terrifying.
He can feel their eyes on him all the way to the front of the bus, but he doesn’t turn around, and when he pulls the curtain closed behind him he doesn’t think he imagines a collective sigh of disappointment. For a moment, he watches Draco steering the bus easily along a winding coastal road and fumbles for words.
“That’s rich coming from the girl who once ate an entire pound of sausages in one go,” George counters, and then frowns. “Who’s this, then?”
“Was it this?” Lee asks, twisting his face until one eye threatens to pop out, and the giggles intensify.
Draco nods. “Eilish and Danica came up with it. They were the first to meet here, and then it grew from there.” He taps the photograph. “If you stand in just the right place at just the right time, the fells sing.”
“Maybe just something nice for the conspiracy theorists to remember me by,” Harry mumbles, and then he takes out his wand and aims it into the air.
Draco snorts inelegantly and his pale skin flushes, but he can’t quite stop giggling as he says, “Harry started it, I’m certain.”
“Ten more Galleons here,” Draco says irritably. “And would you mind keeping your voices down? My head feels like it’s about to explode.”
“Don’t be,” Esmee tells him firmly. “I’m lucky. Not everyone gets to meet the right person. Now, what are you going to do about Draco?”
“Even so, Mr Malfoy,” the nurse says. “I can tell you that she’s doing fine, her hip has been completely healed and she’s awake. We just want to keep her in overnight for observation. You can wait here if you like, or you can come and pick her up in the morning. Those are your options.”
Harry grins and kisses him back, hands creeping under Draco’s thin sweater and slipping over smooth, cool skin. Behind them, the loch laps contentedly at the shore, and somewhere amid the rushes, a pair of oyster catchers pipe loudly to one another. Harry doesn’t remember the last time he felt so completely peaceful.
At six-thirty, Pansy breezes in with pastries and a little promotional bottle of a new type of firewhisky, which she places on Draco’s desk along with an apricot Danish. At six thirty-five, Lofty Lee arrives with the first batch of parchments, and at six fifty, Draco picks up a message that reads:
“I will be here,” says the German sausage man, and all the other stallholders jump in to back him up.
Harry thinks he might know the answer to that one, but he decides not to offer it. As far as he can see, what is wrong with one is wrong with the other, but apparently, it’s complicated.
Draco lifts an eyebrow. “That would be your opinion,” he says tartly, and Luna stares at them over the top of the file she has picked up at random from the nearest shelf.
“I’d like to say he’s a good swan having a bad moment, but this is pretty standard for him,” Harry says, much to Draco’s chagrin.
Ginny nods, and when she turns to face Luna, the sunset paints her pale skin with glowing pink and gold. Beside her on the grass, her Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes robes sit discarded in a ball not dissimilar to the one Harry makes every afternoon.
After lunch, William heads out to the Land Rover and returns moments later with a small wooden crate, which he places on the floor next to their table.
“Our window looks much the same,” Mr Borteg says. “I cannot be sure I would have noticed it, though, at least not immediately.”
As he steps towards Needle and pushes him in the direction of the restaurant, he feels the eyes of the curious shoppers all over him. All he can do is try to ignore them and hope that the swan finds the bristles intimidating, or at least enough of an irritation that he opts to step away from them. For a moment, Needle stays put, pecking crossly at the advancing broom, but to Harry’s relief, he finally gives a cross little hiss and moves off across the cobbles. Harry follows him, jabbing his way to Draco’s door and yanking it open, broom still poking at Needle’s back. As soon as the way is clear, Needle ambles inside quite happily, and Harry wonders if he’d meant to escape at all. Perhaps he came to Borteg’s because he was shut out and needed somewhere familiar to hide.
“You can bring a friend or a special person if you like,” Rose says earnestly. “We have extra tickets because Mum’s the Queen of the PTA.”
Molly beams and Hermione regards her father-in-law with suspicion. For a moment, their table is silent, and Harry idly listens to the buzz of conversations all around him, then Needle arrives to bite Hermione’s sleeve, and the roast potato controversy is quickly forgotten.
It seems ludicrous that his life can have changed so much in such a short time… and yet. Here it is. He has Draco and the bus and the biddies, and the idea of leaving them behind for—he checks the letter—
“That’s right,” Draco says, still staring at his cards. “And you don’t need any help; you’ve won twenty-five Knuts from me today already.”
“There is nothing usual about any of this,” Draco says, and then: “I thought you’d turned those off.”
Luna sighs, unable to decide whether she is amused or exasperated. When Draco spreads out on the floor with them and doesn’t complain about the indignity of the situation, she decides that amusement is for the best.
“If you’re referring to my father’s money, I refused to have anything to do with it,” Draco says, tone turning icy. “It may surprise you to hear that it didn’t take me all that long to grow up and realise that the whole Malfoy estate is tainted and will bring nothing but misery to anyone who inherits it.”
“I’ll no be long with the milking,” William tells them over his shoulder as he heads for the barn. “Enjoy the sunshine while it lasts.”
“Go ahead,” Natalie says, folding her paint-spattered arms. “None of us like what you’re insinuating.”
“I haven’t!” Harry shouts, gripping the metal pole until his fingers hurt. “I haven’t got anything worked out, you idiot, I just fucking hate lies, especially when they’re not necessary. Those women down there—”
When she walks into the dining room at a minute after two, Draco is already there. The children have yet to arrive but the tables and chairs have been spelled to one side of the room, leaving the waxed, sun-warmed floorboards clear and ready for an hour of what seems to be her colleague’s absolute worst nightmare. He is here, though, and it hasn’t escaped her notice that his reluctance has done nothing to diminish his compulsion to be on time. He gazes evenly at her, arms folded and glimmer flickering with apprehension. He looks like he’s ready for some terrible adversity rather than a children’s dancing group, but she decides not to say so.
There must have been a date on the shopfront at some point, but it has been lost to time and weathering and no one, least of all Mr Borteg, has ever bothered to reinstate it. Suffice to say that the shop has been around for quite a long time, and the sight of the gently glowing mullioned windows and the black and gold shopfront makes Harry feel instantly at home.
“Today, tomorrow and Thursday, yeah,” Harry says, also looking over at Rose and wondering if she has noticed that Needle is rummaging through her pencil case. “Do you want to go to Sage?”
“No, thank you, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, casting a mournful glance around the shop and disappearing back into the distillery without another word.
When it arrives, he always gives back as good as he gets, even though he couldn’t care less about what Pansy thinks of his clothes. She knows that he works for his money these days and cannot really afford to keep everything up-to-the-minute like he had as a teenager, but what she doesn’t understand is why he doesn’t just write to his parents in France or Dubai or wherever they are this week and ask them to move a few thousand Galleons into his bank account. She probably never will, and that suits Draco just fine. His relationship with Pansy has never been based on similarity, and that can only be a good thing. The idea of having to spend several hours a day cooped up in a tiny studio with someone just like himself gives him the absolute horrors.
Taking a deep breath, Harry opens the envelope. Inside, he finds a letter written on creamy parchment, an envelope addressed simply ‘to Harry’ in Hermione’s neat script, and a postcard of a haughty-looking blond surfer who looks quite a bit like Draco. Smiling in spite of himself, Harry sets the postcard and Hermione’s letter aside.
“I think… this is either going to be the best wedding I’ve ever been to… or the weirdest,” Draco says, expression pensive as he leans against the counter.
“He’s back,” Draco announces, striding into the shop and sending the little bell almost jingling off its fastenings.
Instinctively, Harry touches his face with his fingertips, bewildered to see them come away with a light dusting of silver glitter. And then it hits him.
“I love you,” he whispers as he pushes inside, words mouthed against Draco’s ear and reflected back to him in an almost unintelligible mumble and a stifled groan.
Harry looks up to see at least a hundred paper snowflakes dangling from the ceiling, each glittering with magic and spinning slowly, and every last one completely unique.
The editor sighs. “Like it or not, Mr Potter, you are a celebrity. The people are interested in the things you do. They want to read about the things you do, and one of our many jobs is to collect and print the things they want to read. I can’t alter that any more that you can alter the rotation of the earth.”
“Very nice,” Harry approves, reaching for another parcel and setting about transforming it, all the while stealing glances at the man beside him, a sharp, clever man with black dust in his hair who can conjure the most impressive multicoloured ribbons out of nowhere.
George stares at her for long seconds and then shrugs. “Fair enough. Right, let’s get to the travel office before they give our tickets to someone else.”
He lets out a loud caw and hops from one foot to the other. Luna drops the cap into her pocket and digs around for a reward. Mr Abernathy is not a fussy eater, but she has discovered by watching his colours that cherries are his absolute favourite. She thinks it would surprise some people to know that animals have colours, too, but she isn’t really sure why. Why wouldn’t they? It’s clearly not a matter of intelligence, she thinks, finding a cherry and offering it to the crow, who accepts it daintily. When Draco first met him, he said that Mr Abernathy was smarter than some of the people they went to school with. Luna hadn’t known whether to tell him that wasn’t very nice or to thank him on behalf of Mr Abernathy. She still doesn’t. Draco makes her feel that way a lot, but she likes him.
“It’s a bigger group today,” Sam says helpfully. “Mr McGann’s off, so there’s no art lesson. I need at least two of you in there. I’m sorry, Draco, but you’re going to have to just… give it a go.”
Luna looks too, wondering just what would happen if everyone at Starlight did turn up in their nightclothes. It would probably frighten the children. That aside, though, Luna can’t help imagining her colleagues at their most vulnerable… whether Sam would wear matching pyjamas, buttoned up to his neck, whether Mary Ann really does sleep in her husband’s Hufflepuff yellow boxer shorts like she once joked, or whether Deb ever wears the red satin thing she got in the staff’s last Christmas gift exchange.
“What’s happening?” he asks, clutching a heavy dressing gown around his body. “Who are these people?”
Esmee is clearly the stronger skater but she doesn’t let go of her partner’s hands for a moment, gliding backwards in order to pull her along the ice. Harry smiles, warmed by the picture they make together. He glances over at Draco, just in time to see him lose his balance and crash onto the ice in a heap. Forcing out his breath in a visible plume, he makes one more circuit, pushing himself faster and savouring the bitter wind against his face. Then he slows, coming to a stop beside Draco, who is now on his feet, shivering and soaking wet.
Scrambling to his feet, he pulls his discarded t-shirt over his head and walks out into the tangled mess of garden. The thick covering of moss is soft and cool against his bare feet and he stretches pleasurably, relieved to feel no traces of a hangover from the previous night. When he spots Draco, sitting on a large rock at the water’s edge, he heads to join him, stepping carefully over the stony ground. He perches beside Draco and leans back on his hands, relishing the morning sunshine on his face and breathing in the cool, damp air. Every breath tastes crisp and pure, as though the rain has washed the landscape clean.
“Well, I know that, but I thought… it’s fancy, it must stand for something,” Harry says, relieved when Needle stands up and the blood starts to flood back into his extremities. “You know, like… Strictly Affluent Gustatory Experience,” he suggests, realising that he definitely is making fun of Draco now.
“You remembered?” Harry mumbles, and Draco shrugs as though it’s nothing, but it’s not. He knows it’s not. It’s everything, and just for a moment, the world beyond the Knight Bus ceases to exist.
His pyjamas are classic, no-nonsense, comfortable-looking—a lot like him, Luna supposes. Made of some sort of cotton or light flannel—she’d have to touch it to know, and she won’t—they are covered in neat, broad stripes of red and blue and look somehow perfectly at home with his usual brown brogues.
“Well, I always go to the Burrow—you know, the Weasleys’ place—for Sunday lunch, and I thought you could come with me,” he says, shrugging and trying to brazen it out.
The nurse scowls. “Rules are there to be obeyed, Mr Malfoy. You might slip past me once but you will not manage it again. Do I make myself clear?”
“Five more minutes,” Francis nods, looking rather perky for someone has essentially been talking to himself all night. “I’ve got that Neptunians record on. Seven and a half minutes long, it is. Good on them, it’s a brilliant coffee-breaker.”
In spite of his bitten legs and fingers, he only wants good things for the swan, and it is far better off here with its own kind than marauding around Diagon Alley, frightening dogs and avoiding edible projectiles. Satisfied that he’s done the right thing, Harry walks back through the park, shoving cold, sore fingers into his pockets and quickening his pace when the nearby church clock chimes three. He makes just one brief stop before heading to his usual Disapparation point, and the striped paper bag rustles happily in his coat pocket as he makes the jump to Ottery St Catchpole.
“Stanley, you daft beetle, just stop!” he calls, knowing that it’s useless. Stanley has been well and truly spooked, and the only way to stop him is to grab him and lift him off the ground.
By ten-thirty, the marketplace is full of people. The stallholders yelling and flinging produce around, the young parents are gossiping as they push their small children in prams, and the elderly, stooping in brightly-coloured cloaks, seem to be everywhere, but no one is doing anything remotely out of the ordinary, so Draco swings the Eye back up the street, letting it linger on the Magical Menagerie, sipping his coffee and watching customers flow in and out, some leaving with cages or boxes or long, soft bags containing snakes.
With a mixture of horror and interest, he looks around the dining room. The first thing that hits him is how light the place is, illuminated against the grey sky by a magical glass ceiling, yards and yards of tiny white lights and a mismatched collection of glowing ceramic lamps. The walls, pale and roughly textured, are lined with shelves that contain a forest of plants, with everything from flowering cacti to dangling vines represented. There are no pretentious tablecloths… in fact, there are no tablecloths at all, and every table is different. Some are chunky and wooden, others spindly with legs propped up on books; one in the window is made of wrought iron and has two matching garden chairs, on which a young couple sit, chattering over coffee and cake.
“Starving,” Harry says, gently tugging the bag out of Draco’s hands and rummaging through it. “This looks interesting, thanks.”
“What in the name of all that is holy have you done, you… you devil beetle?” Draco demands, and this time, Harry can’t quite stop himself from laughing out loud. Draco’s eyes snap to him. “Have you been here this whole time?”
“Don’t give me that. That was fancy stuff and fancy stuff requires proper training.” Harry shoots a sly glance at Draco from under his messy fringe. “You might as well tell me. I’ll just annoy it out of you in the end.”
Harry swallows hard. “It means… erm… it means she’s unconscious and I think there’s a broken bone, but I’m not exactly qualified.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, gulping at cold air that tastes like clean, damp moss. “Hang on, though… this is where George and Angelina are staying. What if they see us?”
“She’s doing okay,” Harry says, handing him his coffee and hoping the warming charm has held out against the snow. “She’s a tough lady.”
“Thank you! Emmanuel, will you stop…?” she calls, and then dashes off after her colleague, who seems to have moved on to his next victim.
you are,” says another girl, snatching up Stanley and bearing him away from the stern voice at impressive speed. “Look who’s wandering,” she says, carrying him through a set of doors and settling under a tree that is even bigger than the one that couldn’t fit through his door.
Harry frowns, gazing into the middle distance as he sorts through the people in his life, searching for someone who has a Muggle postal address, a line of communication to McGonagall, and enough integrity to keep the whole thing to him or herself. His search yields only one such result, and after a moment’s consideration, he decides that she is indeed their best hope.
“Oh, well…” Harry lifts a hand to rub at the back of his neck. “The usual kind of business. Transactions. Expenses. Things going forward and up the… erm, flagpole. Taxes?” he tries, voice rising into a slightly more panicky octave.
“Alright, let’s do this!” George announces, emerging from the crowd and freeing himself from the gigantic jumper.
“The most important thing to remember is that that we, just like everyone else here, want to keep our community safe,” Draco says, meeting Harry’s eyes and strengthening his resolve.
“The bus created chairs for each of us,” Danica says. “Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the right one, but then it remembers.”
It all makes sense. All of it, even the part where he’s having sex with Draco Malfoy on the top deck of a magical bus while the sky is lit up in swathes of green and blue and gold.
“Yes. Since I was three years old. My first cat was a tabby called Moliere. I taught him to fetch my socks in the morning. All my cats have been retrievers ever since,” Draco says, looking at Harry as though all of this should have been perfectly obvious to him.
“Let’s sing a carol!” Ida says suddenly. She screws up her face in thought for several seconds and then launches into song, voice sweet and rather quavery: “Ding-dong merrily on high! In heaven the bells are ringing!”
“You took your time,” Ida says, smiling up at them from her pillows and squeezing the little dog tightly. “Do I look ghastly?”
Harry’s heart stutters painfully and he turns to stare at Draco. “I’m sorry. Seriously. I didn’t realise. What did you do with it?”
“Can we wear any pyjamas we want?” Gareth asks, and the murmuring among the children falls silent, as though the answer to this question is the most important of all.
“You can go. Look at them, they’re fine,” she says softly, and he follows her eyes to where Molly and Arthur are curled contentedly together on the sofa with Rose squashed between them. “I think we both know that there’s somewhere you need to be.”
Needle shifts over a fraction of an inch and Harry gives in. He’s exhausted and he can’t think of anything better than climbing into this bed with Draco and sleeping until the morning. Yawning, he strips off his dirty clothes and crawls under the soft quilt, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist as he lets his head sink onto the pillow. Needle settles himself at their feet. Draco doesn’t stir.
She smiles back until her face hurts, whispering “Thank you” over and over again as her eyes flit over the familiar faces. Ron and Hermione, right at the front, are standing next to George and Verity, still in their vivid pink work robes; Neville waves at her with an enormous white bandage on his arm and beside him, Blaise beams at her and attempts to restrain an excited black Labrador puppy that is pulling at its lead and whiffling at the grass. Her heart leaps at the sight and almost thumps right out of her chest when she sees that Harry and Draco are standing next to one another and don’t seem to be cross with each other at all.
Harry wakes with a feeling of warm contentment that rapidly turns to longing as he remembers Draco’s hands on the wheel, his startled but pleased little smile as Rose had hung onto his chair and asked question after question and the way the bus had trundled around London at an almost sedate pace to avoid knocking her off her feet. There had been secret glances for Harry in his conductor’s seat, and an almost-hidden sigh of genuine regret when he had been swept back to the Burrow along with the rest of the Weasley clan.
Harry looks around to see a group of men and women in rich red robes gathered next to the ice. All movement in the area stops for a moment as their, warm, soulful rendition of ‘Silent Night’ seems to swell and fill every available bit of space. He remembers discussing and voting on the choir as part of Diagon Alley’s winter festival, but their sudden appearance and pure festive brilliance is a surprise.
“No… well, yeah, but it’s… business, that’s all,” Harry says, and Luna watches his eyes flit to Draco, who is still looking at the paperwork on his lap.
“Absolutely not,” Lee says, hopping from one foot to the other with surprising energy. “I can’t... policies and procedures, you see... oh, you’ll have to bear with me, young man, I’m feeling a bit funny. It’s this coffee, I think... shame, there was some lovely stuff in the back of the cupboard a few weeks ago...”
As they watch, every shop doorway fills with shopkeepers and customers alike, faces turned up to the sky. The babble of conversation echoes around the alley, forming an excitable counterpoint to the silent drift of the snow. Harry shivers, feeling several icy flakes sliding down the back of his neck.
Luna stares at her, then at her father, then at the others, who are all holding glasses of sparkling stuff and smiling at her. A glance around the garden reveals strings of lanterns, tiny lights in the trees, a long table set with all her favourite foods, including her dad’s speciality pie. It certainly
“It’s Saturday, and I can do whatever I want,” he tells himself firmly, standing in the middle of his bedroom, shivering in nothing but boxer shorts and trying to remember what he usually does at this point.
His eyes meets Harry’s through a fall of pale hair and hold steady with such intention that Harry flushes all over, breath coming quickly now, heart racing out of control as Draco stares and strokes and envelops him in soft heat, rhythm and caress, and he comes with a whimper, hands flying up to cover his face as he tightens and twitches and empties himself into Draco’s mouth.
“Do I look alright?” she whispers to Harry, and he smiles, taking in her dark red dress and festive cardigan, her hair caught up with a velvet clasp and her uncertain little frown.
Luna continues to smile at them but she feels as though her notebook is burning a hole right through her leather bag and shouting ‘LOOK AT ME! I’M FULL OF SECRETS!’
“—case of woodworm?” Draco interrupts. Rose glances up from her work and then continues, tongue poking out of the corner of her mouth. “It did, but it’s all been dealt with now. It’s as strong as ever,” he says, knocking on the counter for good measure.
“Really?” Draco asks, recalling scarlet eyebrows and hospital rooms and all that came before this. Them. Everything.
“Shut up,” Hermione says, turning slightly pink. “Harry, I promise I’m not trying to rush you,” she adds softly, before bellowing, “ROSE!” loudly enough to make Harry and Ron jump.
Harry helps Rose to put away her things, feeling a bit sorry for Angelina, who is immensely practical and as such seems to be everyone’s first port of call when something needs to be fixed.
Very gently, he presses his foot against seven pedals in turn, and then lets his feet rest on the floor, all at once finding a new admiration for what Draco does, and the way he appears to expend no effort at all when doing it.
She tells those people that they like it this way, and it’s the truth. It hasn’t escaped her notice that the truth makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but she doesn’t think there’s anything she can do about that. She has always been a truthful person, and she has always been a happy person. Harry says she has a knack for finding the bright side, even when there isn’t one, and the idea makes her laugh, because if anyone she has ever met knows how to find the light and keep going, it’s Harry.
“Is that why she’s so big? I mean, is that a feature of her breed?” Harry asks, keeping half an eye on Ida as the wind surges around her tiny frame and whips her long white plait from side to side.
Intrigued, Harry crouches and sifts through the papers, checking the dates. He looks up at Draco, who is now folding his arms across his chest and shivering.
She nods, shifting against him to secure herself. The paper bag in his pocket crackles and her eyes light up.
The messages flood in, as Draco had known they would, and though they are extremely entertaining, they contain nothing at all that can come close to explaining Potter’s strange behaviour. Pansy is smug, sending him pointed little glances every few minutes, but she laughs when he reads aloud a message suggesting that Potter is unhappy because a house-elf has cursed off his genitals.
“The first thing I would do is make sure the entrance to the alley is closed,” Florean says, stepping out of the ice cream parlour. “This is going to be a big clean-up operation and there won’t be any shopping today.”
“Ahahaha,” burbles Hugo, abandoning his cup and picking up a caterpillar made of wooden beads that lights up when shaken. Harry isn’t sure about the logic of teaching children to shake caterpillars, but Hugo seems to enjoy it, and the lights make the living room look rather festive.
“Chocolate frogs!” yells the little boy in the corner, beaming as the nurse unwraps his package for him. “Am I allowed to eat them?”
Harry laughs, sitting on a bench to remove his heavy skates. The sensation of lightness is an odd one, and he rotates his ankles, gazing down at his thick woollen socks.
Draco takes one look at his hat and turns back to the steering wheel, eyebrow flickering dangerously. He starts the bus, sighing when it splutters and turns over with a whine before finally roaring into life.
“Do you think the bus needs a mascot?” Harry wonders, inspecting the beetle’s characteristic bristles.
“Aha,” Draco mutters, drawing close to the window of Cherish and peering inside. “That might just be the one.”
“It’s a bit daft,” Draco says, pulling something from his coat and holding onto it, clearly uncertain. “And the tassels are a bit… bitten.”
He takes his opportunity during a brief lull to hang more baubles, enjoying the relative stillness and catching his breath. As Mr Borteg serves the last couple of customers in the shop, Harry takes the almost-empty box back behind the counter and pulls off his hat, rubbing at his damp forehead with the back of his hand. In a flash of inspiration, he hits the hat with a cooling charm and replaces it, smiling when the fabric touches his skin and sends a wave of freshness across his scalp.
“You know as well as I do that if something makes sense to Hermione, it’d better make sense to the rest of us,” Ron says, grinning. “He’s going to spend the whole night correcting everyone’s grammar but I’ll do it if we’ve got a chance of winning for once.”
“I have no idea!” Draco admits. He steps into the lift and presses the button for the basement, tipping his head onto one side and then the other. He feels as though Mr Fortuna is still bellowing into his face, and it’s rather disconcerting.
Baffled, Draco glances down at his clothes and goes very still. Because she’s right, and these are not his jeans. They are Harry’s, and he has no idea how he could have failed to notice that fact. They are lighter in colour than anything he owns, sort of faded and worn with torn patches and holes that are perfect for a beetle to poke his antennae into. They are rather too large, too, hanging from his hips and clinging only where his damp skin is sticking to the soft denim. He is wearing Harry’s jeans, and Ivy bloody Baron knows it, which means that it’s only a matter of time before Magnus knows it, too, as well as his boyfriend Fergus and half of Gryffindor House, which, with the help of the Hogwarts rumour mill, will soon be the whole school.
When he walks into the studio on Monday morning and Pansy is already there, he can’t decide if it is a good sign or just an unsettling one.
It’s a fierce one, though, and despite Harry’s best efforts at healing the grazed skin, he is still rubbing at his bruised hand when he closes up the shop for the day and Apparates into Ron and Hermione’s back garden. With the temperature seemingly dropping by the minute, he hurries for the cottage, hanging back from the door for just a moment and crossing his fingers for an edible dinner. Ron is a solid cook, taught by his mother to make hearty, flavourful dishes that stick to the ribs and warm from the inside. Harry, when it is his turn to feed the family, does what he feels is a creditable job, throwing together quick meals that please everyone like homemade pizzas and his famous chicken curry, which contains an awful lot more vegetables than Rose knows.
“Ridiculous,” Draco mutters, scowling, and Harry has the strangest urge to lean over and pat him on the shoulder.
Already idly wondering whether she’ll be making chicken or beef, lamb or pork, Yorkshire puddings or stuffing, he showers, dresses warmly, throws down a cup of coffee and hurries out to hail the Knight Bus. Aware of their agreement to start over, he greets Draco with a smile and relishes the look of bewilderment on his face.
Harry grins. “Well, maybe one day. The truth is that Ron and Hermione have been trying to find me a man ever since they got married. Which was ten years ago.”
Harry grins and ignores him. Arthur emerges from the crowd with a collection of familiar items, which he places on the table with care.
“Did you get any sleep?” he asks, perching on the arm of the sofa and filling her nose with a familiar clean, spicy scent. His dark hair is wet and he has missed a patch while shaving. For a moment, she debates telling him this, and then decides to let it go.
It makes sense, Harry supposes, but his attitude still rankles. “What’s wrong with Weasleys? It’s been a long time since school, Malfoy… or does your father—”
Draco sighs. “Then I tried to change the subject by telling him that we needed the sacks for our investigation, and he rather lost it. He said she was cruel and maybe she raided his till and took his unicorn horn just to spite him.”
Harry blinks. “Oh, god, I hadn’t even thought of that.” In the split second it takes him to realise how disgustingly selfish he is being, he is flooded with hot, prickly shame, and he tries to pull away from Draco, but a strong hand holds onto his tightly and warm grey eyes burn into his.
Potter laughs. “I’m not going to be your breakfast show exclusive, so unless you’re going to buy something, you need to bugger off.”
“You’re not going to tell me what that is, are you?” Harry says, picking up his pace when Draco starts striding back to the bus without warning.
Rose giggles and Harry smiles at them both from behind the counter. When Mr Borteg had first agreed to this unusual arrangement, he hadn’t been worried, but he certainly hadn’t expected an instant friendship to spring up between the clever little girl and the bizarre, brilliant man. They make an odd pair, one all bright red hair and giggles and the other a walking Halloween decoration, but they share a pure, burning sort of curiosity that makes them nothing less than kindred spirits.
“He’ll be confused when he wakes up, but at least he won’t sting Stanley,” he says. He eyes the beetle with such sternness that Draco has to smile. “Don’t play with wasps.”
“In that case, I say we make a run for it,” Draco says, making Harry turn to him in surprise. “I can’t get the bus any closer without blocking the lane for everyone else, so let’s just get inside and dry whatever needs to be dried when we get there.”
“What’s the matter?” Harry asks, smile turning into a frown of genuine concern, and Draco suddenly can’t stand to look at him, because it’s happened and he’s done nothing to stop it.
“In that case, thank you very much,” Harry says gravely, patting the dashboard and waiting for a piece of fruit to fly out and hit him. Nothing happens. The idling engine continues to purr and his lovely new chair doesn’t dematerialise beneath him. “Looks like there’s no getting rid of me now.”
“I’m your mother, I just know,” she says, and then turns to him, aghast. “I’m so sorry, Harry. That just came out. I know I’m not your mother.”
“Cardiff to Edinburgh. He doesn’t really need to take a bed for the night but that’s what he likes. He’s not much of a talker, but I’ve gathered he has a very noisy family.”
Harry says nothing, just watches in confusion as Draco casts a spell that protects them from the icy wind while leaving the view of the Aurora intact.
He pauses, frowning, and Harry ducks behind the arm of his chair just in time to miss the Stinging Hex that Draco throws with impressive speed.
She smiles, but the tightness of her face betrays her anxiety. “I called you four times last night and three times this morning and you didn’t answer. I promised Ron I’d leave you alone after the last time but I was worried sick.”
“Yes, I have given in to the window boxes, and I don’t want to hear a word about it from you,” Draco says.
He watches the little huddle of Eilish, Danica, and Corrie in the seats on the opposite side of the corridor. They are lost in their own private conversation, all whispers and flapping hands.
“Of course,” Harry says with a grin. He puts them in his coat pocket and tucks the file under his arm. “Thanks for this.”
“Take a breath, Hermione,” Harry says, but his posture, suddenly rigid and upright, tells Draco that he is just as caught up in this new development as she is.
“She was part of the family,” Draco says. “He was rather unimpressed when he discovered that he wouldn’t be allowed to bring her to Hogwarts.”
“Everyone is okay,” Esmee promises. “It’s just like Mrs Purley—none of them were in the shop when it happened. All the staff were out the back…”
Harry listens to his footsteps on the stairs and then above his head as he pays for Rose’s strawberry ice cream. It really is too early, but she doesn’t seem to care. Florean returns with a large box file and presents it to Harry. He then reaches behind the counter and produces two balls of turquoise bubble gum.
He slouches in his chair, immediately stopping when the motion threatens to make his head explode. Groaning quietly, he lifts his mug to his mouth and sips at his steaming tea. It’s his third cup and he’s not sure it’s actually making a difference, but the hot liquid is soothing, and the fragrant scent seems to drive away the worst of the sour taste from his mouth. It could be worse, he knows that. Ron, Neville and Lee had ended the night in a far messier state than him, and George had had to be levitated up the stairs with his antlers and eyepatch still in place after vomiting into Molly’s geraniums. Still, it had been his stag party and it had been a rather brilliant night.
Confused and frightened, he tumbles out onto a hard stone floor, covered in soot and trying hard to roll himself the right way up. This room is damp and miserable without a single coloured light or decoration, and he doesn’t like it at all. Something is moving in the shadows, watching him finally tip himself onto his feet, and when he scuttles under the table to hide, the something launches itself into view with eyes wild and pointed teeth bared.
“I did the baubles on the tree,” says the boy who is sometimes on fire. “Charlotte helped,” he adds reluctantly, and his sister rolls her eyes.
“All of us,” Draco says. “The biddies miss you. The bus misses you. Juno misses you, even though you stood on her foot. I miss you.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, full of empathy for both of them. He, too, is easily bored and Hermione has told him more than once that he’s a terrible patient. “Tell you what, I’ll come over this afternoon when it’s a bit quieter.”
“Oh,” he mutters, heart sinking, because there, right on the front page, is a photograph of Hermione Granger under the headline: ‘Former War Hero Reveals Dark Side—violence and threats against innocent members of the public’.
“They need to stay out of people’s ear trumpets,” Eilish says, but even she seems happier to share her space with the mouse now that it is safely in a cage.
This suggestion is greeted with the customary level of enthusiasm, with all the children, including the nine and ten-year-olds, dashing off to their bedrooms and returning in a stampede before Luna has even finished assembling the tray. Once she has changed into her Kneazle-print nightie and waffle bathrobe, she tucks herself into the corner of a sofa and watches the pyjama-clad horde descend upon the steaming mugs.
Harry laughs. “Thanks, but if you want to see a really impressive one, you should go to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Theirs is enormous and the decorations sing.”
She says nothing but wraps the cube in soft tissue and then a neat layer of brown paper. She takes Harry’s money and turns her attention to Draco.
She points across the pub to where a dark-haired young man is sitting on a wooden settle, plaster-encased foot up on a little stool. At the sound of his grandmother’s voice, he looks up, gives them a sheepish wave, and then goes back to polishing cutlery.
“Maybe no one wanted to buy your quills because you’re so grumpy all the time,” Felicity suggests. “And while we’re on the subject, what’s your problem with children?”
Keeping half an eye on him, Harry darts into the shop and grabs his favourite sweeping broom. He emerges, gripping the wooden handle and brandishing the bristles at the swan.
“Okay, okay, I’m going,” he promises, placing the collected items on the counter and then protecting them with a good stiff charm.
“Is this the part where I should ask you if you’re scared?” Draco says, and Harry just stares at him, eyes caught by the striking lines of long legs in dark jeans, emerald cotton against pale skin, arms folded in a challenge that takes him back years.
“I don’t work here but you’re all welcome as far as I’m concerned,” says a lady in the crowd. “I shop here every week and I’ve loved everything you’ve done this year for the festival.”
Thora, the woman who doesn’t like tea, peers at him with coal black little eyes and Audrey, a round, sparky character with hair coloured a determined pink, continues to throw spells at her armchair without appearing to hear him. Having met both members of the Mondays-only contingent just hours ago, he is now certain of two things—that Audrey is as mulish as himself and Draco put together, and that Corrie had been right; Thora
