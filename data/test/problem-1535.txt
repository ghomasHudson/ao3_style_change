Harry still gives every window a go first. He tries the backdoor, too. It’s strongly warded from the inside and his spells bounce off all the windows so fully that he must press quickly to the ground when one rebounds right towards him. He makes it entirely around the house like this, where, as promised, the front door sits cracked, waiting in invitation.
Harry’s mouth fully curls up now, a broad smile of hesitant excitement. It’s hard not to mimic, and Draco feels one corner of his lips tipping upwards too.
Harry stops, regards him with unfocused eyes but a true sincerity. “I can if you want me to. I just…”
“I was going to bring someone from the station to make Luna jealous, but I suppose you can be my plus one if you’re so desperate,” she says with a sigh.
Harry, too, had apologised with his actions… though he can’t think of the specifics right now. Wasting time standing in the bathroom stall, he realises he truly can’t remember a single way he’s paid Draco back. He doesn’t have any help to offer with Draco’s research. He’s teaching him to fight, but that’s at his request. The Dark Mark injury had been an emergency. He cooks him dinner often, he reckons.
Downstairs, he rifles through Harry’s cabinets, finding what he needs and making quick work of breakfast. It’s quiet with Harry upstairs bathing, but the home feels familiar. He could prep a meal with his eyes closed here. By the time the other man reappears, he’s found and fed Orsix, chided him for acting crabby with the
For the sake of the objects, they make a very pedestrian walk across the short blocks of Muggle London between the addresses and, like clockwork, Draco pesters him for a training session before they even reach his door.
He wants to say that he doesn’t see it as a lie so much as a careful omission of the truth, but this isn’t fair. If he’d been confronted, it would’ve been a lie. He just wasn’t confronted.
“That’s it,” he’d grumbled as he reached their table, skipping pleasantries and sitting decidedly with his hands flat on the tablecloth.
Harry’s head drops to the left of his, their clammy cheeks pressing together, and he can hear his quickening breaths hot and close to his ear. He’s surrounded by him; his sounds, his touch, his scent on his skin and on the Auror robes hanging close to Draco’s face on the back of the chair.
He smiles patiently. “I’ve worked here twenty years, Mr Potter. My father for sixty years before me. The Potters have been long gone but we are grateful for what they left behind. Of course, you are an important figure, Mr Potter, but in New Delhi, we are equally grateful for your ancestors.”
Another one. And in Diagon Alley. Harry fights the sickening reminders of Death Eater presence on the high street years ago. “Alright,” he says, “I’m right behind you.”
His wand splutters, as lifeless as though it’s been snapped in half, and he stares at it horrified. Draco closes his eyes slowly with a sigh, like Harry’s confirmed something he’d braced for.
Harry smiles, laying a hand on his head and ruffling his hair. He could’ve come more. Another thing he’s lost in himself lately, but he works now to focus not on what he should’ve done but what he’s going to do in the future. It’ll start with fighting to make more time for Teddy.
“Yes, but the Harry I… knew… went zero times a week. You’ve always been lean, with Quidditch and all. It’s not as though you look like a bodybuilder. It’s just interesting to see you… toned and lean.”
“Coordinates,” Harry says vaguely, just before footsteps thump above them and both men snap their heads towards the ceiling.
Pansy slips into her seat to Draco’s left, looking far too pleased with herself, just as Shacklebolt begins to waste a couple of minutes introducing Potter to a room full of people who know him and listing his wartime accomplishments to those who’d witnessed them.
“Yes!” He sweeps up his broom and takes Harry’s from Draco. In its absence, he places his hands nervously behind his back.
, Draco, my turn. I was a dick. I started shit, too, in case you’ve forgotten. I could’ve been the better man. And maybe you’re right, maybe I’m too forgiving with the
“No, yes—you could call it that. Er, something that makes me happy. And well, I’ve realised that wizards are a bit reliant on… well, wizardry. So I’m opening a gym. There will be duelling, but there’ll also be hand-to-hand combat, physical self-defence. It sounds stupider than it’ll be, I swear.”
“Ron and Hermione are going home in a few minutes, I’ll just leave at the same time. If you can just make your exit, I’ll be waiting at yours.”
“Where did you learn this?” Harry sets his elbows on the table, leaning forward in curiosity. “You told me how but never where. Or when.”
Potter’s eyebrows finally lower from their position of surprise. He grimaces with understanding and something that might be empathy. “Oh god almighty, they found you.”
Draco looks down. “Can’t. Pansy is coming over to learn how to stir the cauldrons over the next couple of days so work doesn’t have to stop.” He raises a hand to Harry’s shoulder in slight hesitation, then pats him amicably. “Pack cool.”
He does, moving in close to Harry still in thrilled gratefulness and tucking his face into the crook of the other man’s neck. He has to agree; today ended much better than expected.
“No! You can’t see. Pretend I said nothing,” says Ron, pulling his robes tighter across his chest like a scandalised old woman.
“He’s going to be okay, Virginia, not to worry,” Malfoy says. “I specialise in curses, alright? And I recognise this one. Auror Potter got us here quickly, and when his partner returns, I should be able to easily put an antidote together for your husband…”
His mum doesn’t need to know all that, though. She’s lived with enough of that prejudice, and he reckons the least he can do for forgetting about her visit altogether is to omit such a painful reminder of their past. So, all he adds is, “Thank Merlin that woman’s alright.”
Blaise trips over a leg of the pulverised chair when he leaves, and Draco resigns himself to some cleaning.
“Please, and try to live that down when she’s back from sabbatical? I’d like to keep my limbs working for the games next year. She scares me,” she adds, voice lower.
With a hiss, the flames turn to steam and Cassie’s screams become quiet, rolling sobs. Every Auror not out on assignment has gathered around at a cautious distance, watching the poor girl sit on the floor soaking wet.
.” He places a light hand on Harry’s right shoulder nearest him, adding just enough pressure to get him to release the tension there.
The voice calls with urgency and a hint of desperation and Harry rushes around the corner to his hearth, where the head of a young fellow Auror, Elijah Powell, looks relieved to see him.
Harry sighed. The last thing he needed right now as he properly wallowed in his feelings was recognition worth a galleon if sold to the right paper.
He tells him about knocking into the toiletries while checking the water temperature, about how he had about five seconds to feel his hand start burning and his vision begin tunnelling, and how the last two were spent trying to shout Harry’s name.
“Ah, a thumbs up from Moris!” he’s busy declaring. “She’s okay. All well, then, seems fine, so the game continues on. Or rather has been continuing on, ahah—“
“Yes, yes,” he says, happy to jump at a chance to pay him back. Draco hopes he knows he doesn’t need to.
It was incidental, not obsessive—he’d planned this whole trip to put a smile on his face, so it was only natural to confirm it was there. And if he enjoyed the glint in his eye, the flash of teeth and the bewildered joy he saw every time Harry turned to him, that was simply supplementary.
Draco just shrugs and hands him the phone. Just like that, with no idea how Harry’s heart is hammering.
Draco seems caught off guard by the question, sitting back up and setting his glass on the table. He hesitates a little long for what Harry thinks is a simple question, and his mouth opens for a few seconds while he looks past him in thought before responding.
is. He hasn’t forgotten how strange Draco acted when he’d gotten impatient with his snap temper, and isn’t entirely ready to repeat it. Instead, he keeps his head firmly pointed at his book, but closes his eyes, taking slow breaths.
“Yesterday, I… made that joke about the flowers, and the way you looked at me… just like old times, wasn’t it?” He laughs nervously, glancing down at his feet for a moment before gathering a deep, brave breath and meeting Harry’s eyes. He’s glad for the distance between them when he says what he has to say.
Harry laughs and looks over at Draco almost protectively to make sure he’s still doing fine. He’s staring straight into his emptying soup bowl with wild eyes, and when Harry nudges his shoulder they meet his with something complex behind them that he can’t pinpoint. If Harry had just proposed a riddle, he’d say Draco was solving it.
Ron narrows his eyes as if he’s answered anyway. “I support his choices… though they baffle me sometimes.”
Ready or not, the night eventually draws to a close, even with an after-dinner coffee, and all four of them reach for the check. Draco comes away with it. He doesn’t miss the increasing glances from Blaise, tries to ignore them, and when they walk out the front entrance his friend speaks before anyone else can.
Harry nods in understanding. When the Auror department did especially well, like the amendment to the Statute of Secrecy Murray and Shacklebolt had been discussing with the Muggle PM, Murray found a high horse and refused to dismount. He was a nightmare, and they all hid any disappointing case news for about a week while the dust settled.
Ron and Hermione, especially, have leaned forward in interest. He tries to give Draco a look to reassure him that he’s mostly appreciative he’s been pushed into talking about himself, and takes another sip of the cocktail for some liquid courage.
“Auror Potter, thank Merlin. You weren’t in the office. Situation at Flourish and Blotts. Another curse, we thought you should know.”
As if beckoned by his thoughts, a tapping on the window sounds while his head is squarely in his shirt, arms over his head, and he has a moment of panic, aware that he’s just in his pants, forgetting that he’s on the second floor. When his head pulls through the collar, Orsix is sitting on the roofline, letter in his beak.
He won’t ask what it felt like, what the doctor said to him, until tomorrow at least. Tonight, he’s thankful to have him at all. That swooping feeling hits again, but this time it hurts like he’s fallen from his broom rather than gone diving on it. His eyes are prickling again, his breaths coming short overpoweringly, and Draco clearly feels his shuddering chest because he tenses suddenly beneath him.
Pansy turns her mouth up into a smile, eyes creasing, and she looks at him contemplatively for a long breath. Her expression tells him he’s already won, before she speaks.
His mother appreciated the company, even if she wouldn’t outwardly say so. Every morning they’d have breakfast together, quietly exchanging sections of the Daily Prophet. The extent of their conversation rarely topped fifteen words, but they were a pleasant fifteen:
The hushed conversation is soon replaced with the sounds of clattering in the kitchen, Rose’s little babbling voice, and several hushes from both of his friends. He takes a few more moments to himself, gathering his reserve and preparing for whatever today has to offer—starting, apparently, with a daily newspaper.
“It’s probably Ron,” he suggests to ease his worry, though he knows Ron wouldn’t bother knocking. Draco stiffens into the unsettling stature of his father regardless, stepping away from Harry’s desk.
Harry lowers himself carefully, holding his breath, until his stomach is flat to the ground. He crawls forward painfully slow, listening and trying to see in. There are multiple voices inside, one that is certainly Lucrezia, another a second man. Murray, he considers for a moment, but when he inches even closer he sees a tall figure beside Lucrezia’s.
And Draco truly does eat his words when they’re walking back out with small bricks of gingerbread wrapped in napkins. It’s a ‘secret recipe’, baked out of the tiny school-turned-bakery, intensely ginger-flavoured, sugary, crumbling, and unmatched by any other gingerbread Harry’s ever had.
“It doesn’t take much, and it should just dissolve,” Malfoy says now, scooping some of the paste onto his makeshift spoon. “You will probably feel a warm sensation and some tingling as the blood recirculates. I’ll do it now.”
She smiles sweetly, a distraction from how ruthlessly she’s about to steer the conversation back to him. “So, what happened outside the pub? Because you didn’t seem like you’d returned from a professional discussion of work.”
Harry smiles in thanks, unfolds himself from the couch, announces, “I’m going to get dressed,” and leaves Draco alone as he thumps quickly up the stairs.
She approached him with her boyfriend in tow and gave him a dimpled smile. One hand held her shawl in place against the breeze.
“Okay, fuck you,” he says, taking his wand and wallet from the dresser. “I have places to be. People to bore.” His cheeks are heating and he’s sure his hair’s already rebelling against Draco’s hard work, and on his way to Draco’s door, he takes some deep breaths.
“We’re not competing in the bloody Olympics. I just want to touch you,” Draco whispers back, embarrassed by the sulkiness in his voice.
“I do, too, Pans,” Blaise says. “I’m just multitasking with work so sometimes I miss the details. But I love it. You’re amazing.”
“This is my friend, Draco,” he says, and Lars fixes him with the same tight grip in exuberant reception. Harry hides a smile when Draco places his hands behind his back primly, flexing the throbbing fingers of his right hand.
“I wish my son was home to say hello. Your family, they would be happy you’ve returned, Harry Potter. I’m sure of it.”
The call comes from across the house, at least a storey down from where Draco stands fixing himself up in the bathroom mirror, and it stills his hands where they sit on his collar.
“Wanker,” Lars laughs. He kicks at Harry’s calf from between his legs, trying to knock him off balance. He stumbles and catches himself, but not before Lars takes the opportunity to hook him in the chin, then sweep his legs while he’s recovering and send him tumbling back onto his arse.
She’d posed the question casually enough, a delicate hand refolding the linen napkin in her lap, smoothly asking whether he’s met with any of the victims.
“She’s worked with us for years! It’s a first name basis!” Harry argues, sparing a shocked glance towards Rose as Hermione cusses.
“Some of the most unkind yet unavoidably valuable counsel an actively-worked upon patient has offered,” the Healer had sighed, looking a bit abased.
“Yeah, it’s all been logged out, though, sir,” says Tim, the Auror on duty, when Harry arrives with his request.
Jack answers his command instantly, keenly. His free hand comes up to lift Harry’s chin and he brings their lips together. Harry sinks into the touch like a drought-watered plant, eyes closing as the taller man leans in even further, until he’s twisted Harry enough to press him tightly against the locker.
His friends had listened closely and thoughtfully, interjecting no more than with their expressions and a couple huffs of judgement. Hermione, unsurprisingly, is the first to speak.
When he gets to the fight after he’d shoved Harry into his bedroom just so Blaise wouldn’t see, he’s clicking his tongue and shaking his head with heavy judgement and wisdom.
“This would be just between us,” he says quietly. “And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention it in the office.”
“Nothing.” Draco pushes off the door, begins to make room on the desk for more work. “So are you sticking around?”
Shaky fingers trace the lines, double- and triple-checking against the necklace. With a flash of rationality, he briefly entertains the idea that the necklace itself isn’t trustworthy or that it’s not taking him to Draco. But it’s never felt malicious or disingenuous—he trusts his own tracing, and it’s only ever offered comfort. He doesn't have time to consider caution and thinks, should this take him where he’s needed most, he’ll have another story for Teddy, about the ways in which those who’ve left never stop looking after you.
The confusion has returned, as he knew it would when he broke the seal, and he jumps when Pansy’s voice interrupts the moment.
“Yeah.” There’s a creak on the bed, and Ron lays down beside him, staring at the ceiling, too. “I’m sorry if… I’ve been resisting, I think. But I’m with you no matter what. It’ll just be easier when it makes sense.”
Thankfully, the loud crack of Blaise’s arrival shakes him from his thoughts and he rises to beat his friend to the door. It opens to a smartly-dressed Blaise Zabini, one fist raised as if to knock in the space where the door had been moments ago.
The problem is, Hermione has given him enough to chew on that he needs to talk about this, but she didn’t offer herself up. That’s convenient, isn’t it? Drop something to someone she never speaks to that she knows will leave him confused and rethinking very large decisions. Never mind that he and Harry agreed not to speak of this to their friends, and he seems to have told Hermione everything, or at least enough for her to seek out and send exactly what might sway him. If they’re over, he supposes Harry’s free to do as he wants.
Murray’s not present, Ron also points out bitterly when the three of them sit for a moment together after their various duties.
Surprisingly, Harry stops in his tracks in the middle of the study, taking in the four walls as if he’s never seen them before. “I see what you mean. So many voices.”
“It’s really important to me that you feel you can do just as much work as would get done at home,” Harry shakes his head. “I don’t want to be dragging you from something. Honestly.”
Finally, agonisingly, he turns to Harry. They’re right in front of the valet, so he signals to his right and walks towards one end of the building away from prying ears. He throws his hands into the pockets of his coat, shoulders tight and high, and pretends to notice something in the flowerbed under the restaurant’s fogged windows.
His mouth is turned down grimly, his eyebrows low and his eyes intense with an anger Harry’s never seen and can only pray isn’t directed at him.
He’s angry to see Harry, perhaps surprised too, and so he should have found it strange that he barely reacted watching him point his wand right at Lucrezia as he came down the stairs. The unknown man stands against the wall to Harry’s right, maybe six paces away, and yet no one reacts to his threat.
“Ah, oh, it is.” His face reddens, but Pansy moves on. Draco is still fighting to think of an opening statement.
And so he had perched at the window of his personal rooms, watching students fly around the empty Quidditch pitch with the falling sun at their backs, and sat with himself.
“Draco didn’t seem like himself,” he admits, as he retells the story. They glance at each other and back over.
Slowly, he would work through his cross-referenced inventories while his host worked on personal projects, mostly. He scribbled a lot of what seemed to be arithmancy, occasionally reciting a spell aimed at the cursed skull. When he began a test, Harry would find his parchments drooping distractedly as he watched Draco feel for a trace of magic—the absence of which would be proof of success—with his eyes shut, hand extended so innocuously. Always, Draco would growl in failure and Harry would snap his attention away before he noticed that he had an audience.
Thanks for your patience yesterday, if you were waiting on an update. As we close in on the climax, I decided to put quality before timeliness.
Harry sits up against the wall, leans his head back against the brick and squeezes his eyes shut angrily.
Something strange flickers through Jack’s expression when he says this, but then he’s standing, offering Harry a friendly clap on the back and going to change by the lockers.
He pulls him to his feet, keeping his arm under Harry’s armpit, while lacing the man’s own arm around his neck. Harry sits and rests his head back against the chair, only grunting when Draco says, “Don’t touch anything” sternly and leaves to remake the tea. When he returns, he floats the skull safely away, and only once Harry seems notably more lucid, tea half-drunk beside him, does Draco kneel in his eyesight again.
Three pages later, his left hand is playing with the edges of it as he writes, and by the time the second song has ended, he’s holding it in both hands, staring intensely at the seal. He breaks it before he can stop himself, and unfurls a single page torn from a book.
Eventually, he moves deeper into the shelves and Harry leaves him to browse alone, picking out something he’d read the back of yesterday. When Draco comes to the till with two more books, he adds them to his purchase, paying with the right Muggle notes, and gallantly offers to hold the bag as they keep walking.
“It’s Sirius’,” he says. “We traced all of Grimmauld Place and found it, and he went through the trouble of analysing it for me.”
Harry clears his throat, and Rose sees him first, dropping the toy unicorn from her mouth with a slobbery grin. “Uncle Harry!”
No one was spared from a glossy eye, by the end, and Harry felt the relief shake through him unexpectedly from their words and his own. They leaned on each other. And then they shook off the tears. Hermione said she loved him, Ron too, Ginny with her lips on his cheek, and Harry had reciprocated it all.
“Honestly, Harry,” Ron teases. “You made some really questionable man-choices when you first dived into the gay thing.”
Draco wants more than anything to get Blaise back in the fire, so he looks up from his stirring almost wildly enthusiastic. “Yes!” he says. “Yes, sounds fun, yes. A week from today—Oh damn, I’m supposed to be at my mother’s for warding by late evening.”
He knows absolutely no one at his table—a nightmare—and the only thing he manages to mumble before dinner is served is ‘My grandparents died of Dragon Pox’. He’s at what he’d call ‘the photo op’ table, with a well-to-do couple who’s on the board at St. Mungo’s, an ex-Beauxbatons professor, and a few particularly record-breaking healers. He spots Madame Pomfrey across the hall, which makes him sour with assigned-seating jealousy, but he doesn’t have time to catch her eye before the professor to his left is asking him to run him through the Battle of Hogwarts.
Jack’s smile had fallen completely as Draco’s grew, and he swings recklessly now in frustration. Draco ducks them all and returns a few. By the time he calls stop, Jack hasn’t managed to make good on the offer of Draco’s cheek.
Harry mumbles like a nutter the entire trip to Draco’s—a trip he chooses to take by foot, to clear his mind and set his thoughts straight before he arrives.
He’s still deciding, too, whether a large assignment, even ill-intended, makes up for frustration in his usual role as hands-off trophy of the Ministry. But he has a handle on all of that. And whatever topples over, emotionally, he takes out on a punching bag every Monday and Friday. So he gives Hermione the most confident look he can muster as he says, “I’m doing fine.”
and makes great contact this time, pivoting his weight forward and pinning Harry’s legs in place. He narrows his eyes. “Perhaps,” he says.
He drops his head to Harry’s shoulder, catching his breath and trying not to sound as bowled over and boneless as he feels, but it’s encouraging to notice that Harry, too, is breathing like he’s gone for a run. What had felt like ages was more of a quick blur, and they sit there for a minute, unmoving, quiet but for the sound of their breaths, while a flurry of thoughts begins to wade back through Draco’s sluggish brain.
She thinks for a long moment, crosses her legs and draws a contemplative hand to her lips. When her eyes alight, Harry raises his quill expectantly.
Ginny rolls her eyes and punches him sisterly in the arm. He fights a hiss of pain as she lands somewhere tender from the gym—he’d only cleaned up the visible bruises. He wondered mildly if she still held a grudge or just punched harder than she thought.
Draco’s ears are reddening under Harry’s penetrating, fascinated gaze. “Yes,” he admits. “But I’m not a teacher you can flatter, alright? So
She rose from the table and folded her napkin on her chair, sweeping out of the room. Draco had no clue what was happening, but it felt too significant to return to his dinner, so he waited anxiously with his hands in his lap.
Luna smiles and nods. “I do miss him at the games… Neville’s picked up the slack wonderfully,” she says with a pat on her friend’s wrist. He blushes and fixes his shoelaces. “But he was so amusing! And Godric forbid he bring
There are some things magic can’t fix. That’s the hamartia of most wizards; a lack of consideration for the separate magic of the non-magic. Magic can’t materialise food. It can’t force love. It can’t make you truly immortal. And apparently, it can’t remove your worst mistake, no matter how much you regret it.
Harry looks back towards the pub, no doubt thinking the same thing as Draco, who drops Harry’s wrist, standing. “Everyone’ll be wondering where we are.”
Draco’s never eaten so much in his life. He’s not sure where Harry procured a feast with the speed and range of Hogwarts kitchen elves, just that by the time he’s changed (albeit slower than usual) and come traipsing into the kitchen, a full spread is waiting. There’s oatmeal and eggs and jam on toast and Spoonfuls pastries and fruit and coffee and orange juice. There are also two little Muggle pills.
. People who need help understanding, and-and you have to push me into another room when your best friend stops by. A normal bloke would think ‘ah what a great time for you two to finally meet.’”
“I only didn’t tell him because he can be… hypercritical,” Draco adds, keeping his voice soft and docile. “This is
It gives him a stomachache to think of anything from their relationship with such a pleasant undertone tonight, and so it twists sickeningly even as he’s prompted to remember the first time Draco had held out his arm and asked him to trace it. There had been a soft affection that lingered on his face a moment too long before he’d covered it with a glower. He remembers how it had given him hope, for friendship and for more of that secondary, sweeter Draco. Once upon a time, Amortentia had made him smell the woody scent of brooms and Ginny’s flowery perfume, but now he thinks it might be mint gum and ink and—
“Well. Thanks for the nightcap!” He pushes out his chair and stands, pasting a smile on that doesn’t reach high enough to brighten his eyes. “I’ve taken up your evening enough as it is.”
“Erm, do you think there could be almost… Dark magic residue if something absolutely horrible was here once?”
He’d corrected the spell to date cursed objects the morning after they returned, refreshed perhaps by the time away, and the momentum of that had led him to a greater accomplishment: a second spell, born with the help of Herbert Nadia’s Personally Cursed, that could illuminate the intended receiver of a curse. Something in the way the curses felt, when he’d gathered the nerve to trace them again, besides the pull of terror, kept niggling at his brain, and only once he’d successfully adapted one of Nadia’s curses in reverse as a diagnostic did he realise why.
Immediately, with suspicious hindsight, he wonders, had Harry wanted to do that just as badly or been swept along for the ride? Had his enthusiasm been embarrassingly prominent or just flatteringly so? Should he get up? Are Harry’s legs asleep?
But Draco had certainly put himself out there today, came to the Ministry for Harry, and so he makes his next offer hesitantly.
Instead of listening, he closes the book and turns to face him. “I’m sorry, I know we’re doing that thing where we sit in bizarrely comfortable silence together and just coexist but I—you fought today like I’ve never seen you. What on earth came over you?”
“That’s how fast,” Harry says. “Now again,” and when his right foot leaves the floor, firm hands propel his hips forward again, and this time he’s prepared for the speed of it all and moves with it. The bag swings further than before.
“Y-yes, well, you know, I did just assume we would hit two pixies with one hex the other way, what with me being in London, and you having a chance to see all your school friends...”
Suddenly, with a loud crack, Draco’s on Harry’s stoop. With his hands still on Harry’s waist, he locks his elbows, holding him an arm’s length away as his stomach catches up with him.
His legs are stretched out across the empty sofa, ruminating heavily when, too soon to have changed, he hears the footsteps again and Harry hurries back around the corner, leans down and kisses him quickly.
He’s sure that his face is fully red as he gestures to the living room couch. They’re friendly, but they don’t talk appearances anymore. They’ve both changed, since they were together. No one looks the same at twenty as they do at twenty-seven.
Draco frowns, thinks quickly. “Hm, er, well with the necklace chapter, rewrites for the skull and necklace chapters, maybe—“
He blinks in surprise. “Thank you, Mari. That means a great deal. Do you… ever feel like the slowness of all the bureaucracy just ruins your case?”
The interest in Draco’s face flickers briefly into something else, greater and complex, and Harry takes a deep breath, sobered by the solemnity. And then his wrist feels too cold—Draco has let go, exposed his flesh to the air’s chill again, and he has a strange thought of
“You were just talking like you might have a night terror or something, and I haven’t—you didn’t seem to need the offer before, but now I thought you might be interested. But I understand if you’d rather not.”
“Yes?” he replies, walking forward. Draco appears from nowhere, hands full, watching them both intently.
“Of all people I expected through that fireplace, it certainly wasn’t you, Mr Malfoy,” she says coolly. She sets her quill down with purpose, gifting him her full attention.
“I’ll ask another question, then, if that’s alright,” says Harry, hoping to change the mood. He clambers out of bed, feeling Draco’s eyes follow him, and picks up the pair of jeans off the floor. When he speaks, it’s with the accusational tone of a wife who’s found another woman’s earring.
“I’ve been coached, too. I know how to work through it. Crucifying pain stimulates the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and judgements about predicaments. So that’s where you have to counteract. Hearing another voice helps that.”
Seamus sets his glass down hard, elbowing Ron good-naturedly for backup as he says, “Mate—you’re… not ugly—“ Harry rolls his eyes. “—You’re a celebrity, you could have any girl you want. If Ron’s not reminding you daily, he’s a bad best mate, and oi! One for Ron too, eh?” His face is flushed, eyes glittering. Harry wonders how many drinks he’d had before he spotted them; he’d been at Ron and Hermione’s wedding.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugs. It’s not as heart-stopping as it should be. He’s not ashamed—he’s just not been going out of his way to create the maelstrom of press that’ll circle once it’s public knowledge. “Isn’t it possible that it’s an open secret by now? I don’t go announcing it at work, but you lot know, Luna, Neville, all the Weasley’s…”
pulls itself from the shelf. Malfoy directs it with his wand and they follow it out of the aisle. Harry’s glad to see that Powell’s managed to calm the victim’s wife a bit more, and she’s sitting on a stool he’s brought out from behind the till. Her hand is clasped over her mouth and she sits up straighter when they turn the corner.
Draco scoffs. “Typical Harry Potter, prioritising personality.” His eyes leisurely roll up and over to meet Harry with a full toothy grin. The entire expression is lazily fond and familiar. It stops his lungs.
“He definitely wouldn’t fancy that name. But… no. I just… er, can’t get into something right now,” he says. He’s pulling words from thin air, not yet even capable of working through his hesitation himself, but Jack deserves some sort of explanation, even a false one.
“Bulstrode will be there, I suppose,” Draco considers. He slips his wand up his sleeve, ushering them out the door as he contemplates. “You guys. Luna. Flitwick…”
With a small, proud quirk of his mouth, Draco takes the set to the shopkeeper, then stands by the door exaggeratedly swinging his small bag on his finger as he waits. He leans against the wall and tries not to get too introspective as he looks over the entranceway, much cleaner than he’d last seen it.
It is the truth; he’s had it on his mind ever since the Flourish and Blotts incident. He’d had to tell Harry to physically back up because his innate magic was drowning out that of the cursed book. He’d never experienced such an intrusion like that before, though he’d kept it to himself. Seeing now how Harry handles talking about his own power, he’s glad to have done so.
“It wasn’t him. I’m sure of it. You’re right, you don’t have all the facts. You didn’t see his face when we found that first cursed book. The one meant for me. And why would he teach me to trace, then?”
It makes no sense to him. Besides the first event, none even seem to warrant the reactions Draco’s given, unless he hates Hermione that much. Harry frowns—he thought he knew Draco well enough to figure this out. But then again, he also thought he knew the man well enough to safely suggest dinner plans at the Leaky. He thinks again of the Two Dracos: Draco his friend has been overpowering the other, save some little fits and moments of bitterness. Perhaps it’s bigger than even that.
The chateau that Narcissa Malfoy had bought in Chalais was a castle. A ‘modest’ castle, she called it, as she pointed to where a drawbridge used to pass over the now-dried moat. “Just 900 square meters, not including the woodlands.”
“A Frankenstein charm,” Draco nods and smiles. “So then after the notes I made from the Scrope book, it was just all about finding a charm and curse hybrid that would actually work for something as strong as an Unforgiveable. And then—Harry,
Draco hasn’t been fast enough to find Flitwick, hampered by Blaise’s lateness, but as everyone else also begins to seek out their tables and sit, he watches McGonagall walk from where she stood with Potter towards what must be the Hogwarts tables. Shaken by the sheer size of the guest list, he resolves to catch the professor quickly once the food arrives and leave early before he’s been surrounded by insufferable company too long.
Ron claps his hands together. “Yes, we’re all in agreement, my wife loves books. I should get them home to her.” He taps the bag that he’d set down with his foot. It makes a sound like he’s kicked a brick wall.
the way down here before silencing me. Too daft to realise that the ward you set only exempts you from restrictions on instantaneous spells.”
surprise trip to India had been executed. They’d been together more often than not, and yet neither he nor Draco’s friends had any clue that he was practically moonlighting as a travel agent. Harry, on the other hand, took his plans to Hermione almost immediately.
He doesn’t mention that Draco’s managed to invent a fixed spell. He omits, too, the fact that the objects were cursed for specific recipients, himself included, and any implication that he’s suspicious of someone on the floor. Especially with an office so close to Murray, who’s never been Harry’s biggest fan and certainly not Draco’s, he’s wary to trust what can be said.
“What’re you thinking about?” Harry tilts his head, looking down at Draco and narrowing his eyes. He sees in them the flecks of olive and brown, in his cheeks the still-fading freckles of summer.
Harry shakes his head slightly, seeming to give up on his invitation with a low sigh, and looks back down at the page as he extends an arm towards Draco. There’s a small note held between his fingers. Draco walks across the room and takes it, still receiving no indication of expression from Harry, whose attention is firmly set on the book in his lap.
He cups the tea in his hands as he hums in interest, feeling her attention on him and discovering terribly that he’s quickly losing all energy available for maintaining pretences. If Draco maimed him Wednesday, Murray had been the killing blow yesterday, and he’s having trouble picking through old history books while coming to terms with the fact that he’s planning on disregarding Ministry orders to treat his boss as a suspect, all with no support and no curse specialist.
He’s especially nervous about tonight’s speech, his latest ‘yes’ courtesy of invitation from the Mind Healers for Survivors, who had partnered with Professor McGonagall and the rest of Hogwarts to hold a ten-year commemorative gala to raise money for services for those affected by the war.
He gives her a weak smile, a bit surprised, and she takes one final, deep, satisfied breath before turning to mention something to Ron, smoothly giving him a moment to himself. And thank Merlin she does, because his stomach is dropping out, like he’s fallen unexpectedly from a great distance, and his heart is twisting, ever so slightly, into knots, reflecting on the boy he’d once met—desperate always for his father’s approval, taught to live on admiration, seeing no other way to feel whole. And he reflects on the man he’s met since—fiery but trying. Defensive and passionate. Wronged and lost, but seemingly recovering.
When he crosses the office again, he taps his hand quickly on Cassie’s long reception desk, drawing her attention from something, and says “As soon as you can,” without stopping until he reaches his own office.
He smiles warmly so Harry smiles back, though he doesn't feel clever, just in desperate need of a breakthrough. They drift into an easy silence, just as pleasant as the study, surrounded by the sounds of the forest.
“Oh joy,” Draco mutters. While Harry’s nightmares have continued to slowly depreciate, especially with the intermittent use of Draco’s own Dreamless Sleep brew, they’ve been replaced with vivid dreams. Too often, Draco’s been woken to claims of things he did in Harry’s nighttime imaginings that require real-world assurances.
The dreams are fuzzy, as they often are the next day, but he remembers one bad and one good. There’s a heaviness settling over him from the night before, like the kind of headache that worsens in sleep instead of disappearing, but he thinks it would be rude to bog down the trip with such unspecific moods.
An extra two years at Hogwarts. What a thing not to mention, but then again, Harry recognises with a mature awareness, there’s much he hasn’t mentioned either: Jab Gym, Jack, anything about his sexuality since his speech at The Four Johns.
“He has to climb so much further. I’m sure he’s distrusting of the most well-intentioned, neutral-grounded wizards out there, so learning to trust that Harry Potter of all people is trying to rise to the occasion can’t be a simple task. It’ll take effort.”
“Well, I don’t think any of us are surprised that you’re trying to see the best in people, Harry. I’m just surprised the Ministry agreed with you.”
Harry’s hands travel to hold his waist and pull greedily, as if to beckon him closer, prod him from his seat. With the little brainpower he’s maintained, he reflects on his quick, chaste kiss in the pub, on waiting for Harry to lean in in the alley, on sitting and letting Harry catch him by surprise with a kiss on the couch. Even on the wrestling mats, they’d met halfway.
At the hospital, they take Draco from him and disappear behind doors, and he stands in the hallway looking down at hands he hadn’t noticed were caked in dried blood until Draco wasn’t in them anymore while Hermione says things that he doesn’t hear.
Harry sighs and runs a hand through his hair, turning and stalking towards the hallway. Draco stands quickly to follow him, but his vision is instantly replaced with fuzziness, overcome with nausea.
He stares at her, trying to think of something else to ask. He tries to remember if he’s ever seen a photo of a boyfriend or girlfriend on her desk. Or even a dog. There’s an extraordinarily long pause, so he panics and pretends to wave to someone before drifting away with a mumbled goodbye.
“He’s a nice student, Wood,” Luna comments, patting Ron’s shoulder lightly. “We haven’t had a proper Lee Jordan-level commentator in ages. Not since that firecracker of a girl years ago…”
Draco is surprised when day after day passes and it seems Harry has listened to his instructions and won’t return unless it’s with evidence in hand. He’d meant for that, at first. Especially so shaken after a day that started with voluntarily entering the Ministry and staying composed as the Head Auror berated him and ended, inexplicably, in a Muggle gym.
, Harry thinks. He doesn’t give Murray the honour of jogging his memory. For both of their sakes, he turns and leaves before he can do something he’ll regret. He passes an astonished Yolanda silently, too, and doesn’t look to see if Lucrezia is in or heard any of that.
Flitwick claps his hands together happily. “Exactly! The river rock was a success, though I’m guessing took more complicated arithmancy to de-escalate than the diary?”
“Yes, well I wouldn’t want him to get the idea that I have anywhere better to be than right… here.” He lays down next to Harry and throws an arm and a leg over him. “Pull that blanket up.”
Draco never won when they sparred. Harry refused to take it easy on him. He saw in his friend the same strength of will fed by frustration that fueled him when fighting. For Harry, a loss was a sign of faults to correct, which would aggravate him. He’d channel it with determination and do noticeably better the next round. Draco reacts scarily similar.
He clears his throat and hands the paper back to Ron, blinking his eyes. “I need to go to the Ministry as soon as possible,” he says to Rose, the safest person to make eye contact with.
“I was saying, you should take all these home for a fortnight, look through them,” she says, staring firmly to get him to meet her eyes. He glues his to the book, where it’s safest.
Then, in forfeit, a voice, echoing in the empty afternoon gym; “Jesus, Harry, that was eerie. Have you got eyes in the back of your head or something?” Its owner is smiling good-naturedly, even as he rubs the side of his head. He holds a hand out in concession. “Spare me? I’ve got drinks with the office in an hour.”
Harry falls flat against the pillows again. “Of course, I can multitask.” He tugs at Draco’s arm. “Come to bed now. It’s late.”
“That bath was your best idea ever,” he says, feeling intoxicatingly comfortable. “Your best in the history of ideas.”
Harry stands and cheers with the rest of the crowd, sincerely distracted by Isabelle Porter’s mad grin as she thrusts her fist in the air, the Snitch’s wings fighting valiantly between her fingers. He smiles. It’s a good feeling, he remembers it.
He raises his head too fast and the world spins a little faster. When it settles, Potter is standing in front of him, leaning down a bit to meet his eyes. He instantly throws his head back down.
It was a chaste kiss, fast and gentle and barely touching, everything he hadn’t imagined—as he admittedly often did—it would feel like to be kissed by Draco. Even in an unfathomable moment, he’d managed to act more unpredictably than Harry had imagined.
He hesitatingly then firmly pats Draco on the knee under the table, a gesture of support, and stands. “Off to the gents,” he announces, abandoning his newest friend to his two oldest.
He freezes, momentarily, then quickly returns to fitting the box. His back is still to Malfoy, so he bites his lip to hold his tongue, hoping he hasn’t given the man the satisfaction of catching him off guard.
Something strange happens to Harry after work. He stops outside the Ministry and feels a strong desire against his better instinct to go not towards home, but to Diagon Alley. There’s something he must do that he’s been putting off long enough.
“Bundle of nerves, I think, but she’d never say as much,” Ron says. “But you know Ginny. She always pulls through. And she doesn’t have to bother with First World Cup anxiety this year.”
For the love of Circe. Harry would be happy if he never heard about Simon again. It’s not as though he’d done Harry wrong in any way. He’d simply been so early, so inconsequential in his life and romantic history that he’d just about forgotten about him completely until Hermione mentioned his name.
When he’s walked halfway home and his heartbeat starts to slow, he counts off all the reasons he’d had to see Harry: School reunions? Gone. Consultancy? Gone. Friendship? Gone. Something bigger? Gone.
He looks like he has more to say, so Draco stands patient, holding the plates. Harry’s biting his lip with the expression he has when he’s shopping through words, choosing carefully.
Draco turns his head to look towards Harry, but he’s staring straight ahead. The flames dance in the reflection of his glasses.
Harry laughs, then taps Draco’s leg and he climbs off, releasing Harry and trying to quickly tidy his appearance. Harry watches, wonderfully tousled himself, but just stands with his arms crossed and his gaze investigating Draco deeply enough to turn his cheeks red. He finally turns to Harry himself, unable to stand it, and delicately adjusts the shoulders of his shirt and untucks the tails completely past the point he’d messily wrested out earlier.
It’s strange to see her at something as relaxed as an office party, so visually discordant from her disposition, but she’d always taken a liking to Ron and Harry. He’s never fully decided whether the tense, narrow-eyed expression she moves with is made more intimidating by the tightness of her high bun or the shaved patterns in the short hair of her undercut. She speaks in her usual curt voice, serious and yet somehow friendly.
“That’s all my opinion though,” Pansy continues. “As for your actual question, if you still believe from your experiences in friendship and your early relationship that this is something you want to pursue, confirm three things for me before you reach out: First, will you be alright if he isn’t willing to try again? Second, has he exhibited attempts to change and better himself in the past, maybe for other reasons, and do you believe that he cares for you enough to consider doing so again? And third, do you have it in yourself to change?
Watching Ron circle the room and shake hands jovially, Hermione at his side, allows him a minute of something resembling sadness or nostalgia for what’s being lost today. This’ll be the first time he’s been fully without either of them daily, after school and Auror training. It’s a fight to keep a frown off his face, to remain present for Ron. But soon he’s spotted, forced to reenter the throng himself and make his own small talk, and his expression lifts forcefully into the canned publicity smile.
but otherwise completely empty on top. It’s as though half the study has been transported to northwest England and Harry stands behind his chair and skates his fingernails through blonde hair absently as he watches the mountains.
At least after this, when everyone is calling him daft and self-destructive, he can say he tried the perimeter first. With his wand tightly in his fist, he reaches out his left hand to push the door open. It creaks slowly and reveals a dark interior, furnished but out-of-date. It’s a home, not an abandoned house—there are framed photos hung on the walls, placemats on a table.
He reaches for Draco’s leg to finish dropping him onto his back, but Draco brings his knee up in defence before Harry can get there, pushing him back with enough strength to break the hold on his neck. He scrambles up and utilises Harry’s instability, tackling him to the ground, then presses close, lowering from his hands to his elbows to bring his face nearer to Harry’s own surprised one. Their bodies are pressed together, none of it in a way that Harry can’t escape, but he lays limp.
She nods. “He used to trade me shiny sickles for my galleons because he said shinier coins were worth more.” She screws up her face. “I’d hate to be in Slytherin.”
, that’s… I remember this, during the trials. God, that missed the background checks… If you wanted to tell me that the case is uncomfortable for you, then I completely—”
It’s not a great idea; they’ve been friends for years and Jab is a small gym if this goes south. But the pit in his stomach that’s been haunting him all weekend is persistent, and Jack is
Draco looks murderous, stuck in silence, his eyes flitting between them as they speak. Harry tries to catch his gaze, but he glides past his face too quickly every time.
“About the case how?” Harry asks again now, tilting his head lazily against the cushion of the couch.
Draco had once pulled off a prank on Blaise by wasting an entire day on creating a charm that counteracted the Boggarts’ charm during a major game, directing the figurines to win him their Fantasy Quidditch bet. Now, every time they spent a game here—
Draco wonders if James Potter has been excluded from this query because he’s been gone so long or because Harry knows he’ll never miss him less. He doesn’t ask, though he has occasionally tried to imagine what it would be like if Lucius was considered a good man and an absent one. He creeps his hand left a few inches and finds Harry’s. It feels like crossing an ocean, the easy confidence of his touches this morning fading fast. He threads their fingers together against his reservations anyway, keeping his eyes up. He’s always found words to be an easier medium than touch.
He lifts the necklace now, too, and sets it in his palm. It’s flat gold, shiny enough to spot a warped reflection of his eye on the surface, with no inscriptions or marks. A complete mystery object he has no context for. Suddenly, he understands what Draco meant by the tunnel-vision fostered by a particularly puzzling cursed object. He wants to do nothing but decode this.
He does as told, tips his head back, enduring the burn of the firewhiskey and the small puff of smoke from his nostrils when he breathes out through his nose meditatively. He affords himself one more deep breath, then shakes his head clear and claps Ron’s back amicably as he walks towards his fireplace.
“I felt it again when I touched the skull,” Harry continues, “but then after a bit I felt your hands and I heard your voice and you sounded kind of underwater, but you were telling me what to do and keeping me present and I just thought… it’s daft, but if you’d been there every time, it would’ve been so different.”
Aside from a brief foray into society for his trial before the Wizengamot, which required sitting amazingly still while the likes of Potter and McGonagall spoke of him as a social experiment that wasn’t yet complete, he spent all his time in the Manor’s library after the war. Probation offered an excuse to hide away at the family home, but it was his hatred for the rest of the rooms that kept him sequestered with the books, surrounded by so many publications that he could think of nothing better to do than self-teach himself to pass his NEWT’s.
Of course, any success of Draco’s had to be coupled with a nagging parallel success from local savior Harry Potter, who around the same time was making headlines with Weasley for completing Auror training—a completely normal accomplishment that most Ministry officials achieved without the need for a front-page photo.
He moves closer and Harry’s shoulders drop as the defensiveness leaves his body. He flushes. “Sorry, I came early.”
Draco is smart, he thinks, waiting until he’s fully stepped off Ministry property onto the pavement before he unravels his muggle iPod. And he is interesting, and probably funny when he wants to be, and self-assured. He stands up for his friends. Those are great qualities, wrapped up in a muddled reputation.
He’s tall and toned, a regular by the weight equipment and Harry’s usual spotter when he can be bothered to participate. His olive skin is regretfully rosier where Harry’s fist had made contact, but his own jaw is similarly sore, so there are no hard feelings. There never are.
Draco hears in the question. He raises his eyebrows, eyes full, hoping the sincerity is visible in his voice, or at least the hand he’s placed over Harry’s heart, under his shirt. It’s still beating rapidly.
He remembers his surprise to watch Harry’s face fall at the ramifications of vanishing Draco’s completed evidence—a feeling he thought he’d been alone in, and that he wasn’t going to confront. But in watching him, his stomach had turned, and he felt an overwhelming need to convey reassurance, to make that look disappear alongside the heaviness in his chest. The longer they’re friends, the more his stomach does that, like he’s anxious that Harry will wise up and stop being kind, or decide Draco wasn’t worth the effort.
“Yes. It’s a crack up. I know.” He massages his temples. “Laugh at my pain later, but if you could keep it together for two more minutes, I can get this off my chest.”
He rolls his eyes, disguising his agreement, and watches Harry walk around the bed. He stops, though, at Draco’s desk and a book sitting there.
“Ron, I’m just… we’ve got to work together on this. When he wakes, we’ll have a chat, and from the chat, we’ll gauge whether to mention the
“…Yes, she did.” For a moment, he’s caught in surprise at Draco’s curiosity of his friends, even if they’re currently heading toward them.
Weasley says something and nods his head towards his sister, causing Potter to laugh generously, head fully tilted back. The man’s easiness in the same setting that fills him with resentment and distress feels personal. It sends ice through his veins—a reminder of how enjoyable it was to perfect, pretty, doted-upon, keynote speaker Potter.
The rush of joy he’d felt from his meeting with Marta and his presentation of the necklace to Harry is snuffed out. He knows the sacking isn’t representative of his professional capabilities, but that doesn’t stop his mind from whirring through the effects this will have on the case.
Grimmauld Place lasted two nights. It was nightmarish. He tried to cook, one of his few newfound joys, but the kitchen felt full of ghosts. He couldn’t walk the halls without running into Kreacher, and he couldn’t
And thank Merlin he got to it when he did, in the pin-sharp focus he was using to cope that morning, because a letter from Hermione Granger arrived with an owl he didn’t recognise in the afternoon and he took it so the bird would leave but left it sitting on the kitchen counter unopened.
“Oh, save it, you haven’t even told me what’s in the bag,” Draco teases back. “Can’t be that brag-worthy.”
is black! Speaking of ‘identity’, I distinctly remember the both of us camped out in the Hogwarts library doing everything we could to research her history. Passage from Jamaica, Jamaican wizards, traditions…”
“Shhh,” Harry interjects, hand pausing in his hair. “It’s okay. This is nothing.” A thumb sweeps his temple and his eyes close again. He takes a deep heaving breath.
It’s already quarter past ten, so he decides to leave early and settle in at the café with the file. He’s just putting his shoes on by the door when he hears the telltale crackling of a firecall.
It threw him off when she would occasionally ask for his advice on her students, and at first he’d refuse to comment. He’d learned about most of the children from sitting in on Charms, however, and it wasn’t long before he couldn’t help but discuss the learning methods they’d both observed working. They never talked favourites. But they would whisper about least favourites.
Tace glances at Draco but doesn’t dare say anything. They speak quietly between themselves for a floor or two, and when the lift calls “Magical Law Enforcement, Auror Department,” Harry budges past with Draco on his heels. He spares a double-take when he sees that Albin, a wiry, usually mouthy Junior Auror has drawn the short wand and taken over at reception.
Harry’s attended a few events in the Ministry ballroom, but it has never looked like this; the usual dark mahogany walls and tall, coffered ceilings are affixed with Hogwarts regalia from all four houses and several beautifully gilded Hogwarts crests. The podium, too, on the raised stage that stands against a curtained partition, holds the Hogwarts insignia alongside the Mind Healers for Survivors emblem.
“What do you think of the place?” asks the man in question, watching keenly as if he cares for Draco’s opinion.
The frog had been forgotten immediately in the enticement of shopping. Harry had held out his arm and whipped Draco into the bend of space, landing them behind a Muggle street in North London, across from a small storefront called Manticore Fight Store. The outside was painted a dark, intimidating black, but inside the light from the large store window filled it with brightness. Its graffitied walls were covered with boxing gear, clothing, hand wraps, and shoes and in the back stood a display of several pieces of equipment, including hanging and standing bags.
Draco’s face flushes, Harry’s too when he turns to look at him. “Oh well,” he says casually, voice a bit high. “It’s—I mean, I’m moving in hopefully before December. But Draco… he’s—“
He’s grateful, then, when they reach the pub and their silence can be drowned out a bit by the chatter of others around them. The Four Johns looks just like a wizarding pub, apart from the giant boxes displaying muggle sports that hang around the bar and walls, and Potter drags him to an open table. It’s tall and he has to almost climb into its stool seating.
Harry hardly remembers getting home, or kicking his dress shoes off by the door, peeling off the layers of formalwear, or falling into bed, unbelievably exhausted despite being home hours ahead of schedule.
Asia chapter is dedicated entirely to the Potters—not just mentioning them offhand in reference to another topic. It still awes him to see just how many books at least mention his family. How many times had he been to the Burrow and never known his family history was sitting on the shelves right by where he ate? It’s more jarring still to see his name in text:
His time at Hogwarts had been complexly challenging, of course. And yet, he thinks, in a way it was when things were simplest—good and evil, the war so large and harsh that he’d had no need or time to investigate moral nuances of individuals. Hate had never come easier.
“I was just thinking,” Harry tells him easily. “My favourite and least favourite thing about us is how good we are at not talking.”
In his mind, this is the natural result of one friend cautiously reaching out and the other falling into complete, distracting infatuation, the handling of which is only going decently well because his most intuitive friend is near-oblivious. He can handle this well, internalise it, so long as he doesn’t have to handle the input and inquisition of certain outside, well-dressed, charming forces. But if telling Blaise is what it takes, he’ll do it, because he can feel that this is something interesting and good and important to him.
Draco had to practically kick Harry out of his house that evening, he’d been so excited to make progress. Though he’d had often watched Harry work on study nights, it had been paperwork for a job he seemed less-than-thrilled about, though he’d never make such a bold claim to Auror Potter’s face.
“Clearly I fucking wondered, I’m here aren’t I? If you think you and Murray weren’t suspicious for dismissing—“
“No, no, not in any words,” she says, carefully sincere. “We know that, right Blaise?” She elbows him lightly.
He’s satisfied, but it still takes more conversation than Draco would like to usher his slowly sauntering friend back towards the study. Finally, he reaches into the floo powder and pauses in the hearth with it sifting through his fingers.
“You don’t mean to say there’s… a group? Of Dark Wizards?” It’s Phaidra who says this, a young witch who’s searching Harry’s face like he has all the answers.
The trio enters into the quiet chatter of Harry’s least favourite part of the evening—cocktail hour. Per his request, they’d managed to miss most of it. He reckoned that anyone he’d wish to make small talk with was someone he’d have kept in touch with independent of a planned special event.
“Aren’t you dying to hear? Your necklace?” He rounds the table and takes Harry’s hand, flipping it palm up and pressing the chain and charm into it. He leaves his hand on top and frowns at the worry on his face. “What’s happened?”
He doesn’t miss the fact that Draco’s leg, the one not tucked under him, stills when it brushes with Harry’s shoulder as he readjusts. He chews his lip, trying to focus all his energy on his book. He’s just gotten to the chapter on Asian wizarding hierarchy, which has taken a delightfully more laudatory approach than the biased, though educational, pro-Malfoy books from the Manor.
, Draco’s thoughts betray him. It’s a constricting large thing to consider, knowing Harry for a lifetime, and he can’t match the flutter in his chest to a specific emotion, positive or negative.
“Leonard?” Malfoy says, now speaking to the man directly. “Are you doing alright? Blink once if you’re at manageable pain levels, twice if an anaesthetic spell would make you comfortable.” He ignores the choked cry of worry from Virginia at his question. Leonard blinks once.
“So this has nothing to do with you running out of the pub all the sudden after Malfoy on Friday?” asks Ron.
“He—there—he must’ve touched something—a curse in the shower… the bottles… his veins, Ron,” Harry croaks belatedly. “He was just
“That look you’ve got, I’ve seen it on Hermione every exam season. You don’t want to know what happens next. Take a break, yeah?”
When Draco tumbles through the fire into Harry’s living room a while later, the first thing he does is laugh. It’s funny to admire fire for its non-magical qualities and then use it for its magical ones. Plus, he’s in a bit of shock.
Draco parts his lips to say something, to find a way to call Harry something, too, but it all feels insufficient, incapable of providing an appropriate description for the man above him.
Harry thwaps him with the papers and Draco’s grin doesn’t budge an inch. He picks up his bag with a nod to Hugh, who reaches out to shake hands with Harry.
There’s a casual concentration to his gameplay that feels insidious. Draco regards him surreptitiously, more studious than before now that they’re alone. Much of him is as remembered—the red hair, the height, the sheepish grin he knows he won’t receive today—but much of him has changed since Hogwarts, just like the rest of them. He’s broad-shouldered and holds himself with conviction. He looks like he’s kind when deserved and menacing when not.
to hate me. It’s not something that’s going to narrow down your search, so it’s no use obsessing over it. The best thing you could do is find the perpetrator. Focus on your wand lists and all that.”
“Charming,” says Draco, tossing it to him. He catches it, impressed into disbelief, and runs his hands over its bony pockets and protrusions.
“We’re not exactly royalty, these days, are we? I decided an event I’m actually invited to would be a good start.”
He’s charmed himself into a corner by judging his old classmate for not growing past schoolyard taunts. Now, he’s forced to choose between being the bigger man or a hypocrite. In truth, it was no choice at all. His first big case had one lead, and he’s a bad Auror if he doesn’t throw his best at the situation.
“Jack is excellent at getting out of pins and wicked strong,” he says, crouching across from Draco on the mat. The description doesn’t fill him with the prickling anger it would have before Harry had kissed him back. “But you have speed. If your opponent is stronger, it’s vital to focus on technique. Speed will increase with good technique, and technique will always beat muscle. Go
that was an evasive answer. But he’s glad to have it out. They’ll only move past ‘nemeses’ if they talk candidly. He lowers his voice as he speaks.
Harry doesn’t feel too encouraged by the appeasing tone in his voice. He props his feet up against the stones of the fire pit and watches the embers almost lick the bottom of his shoes. There’s no time to reconsider his life trajectory. It’s enough to be wrapping his head around the… Draco problem. Is this a quarter-life crisis?
Most interestingly is a small oval void of dust in the cabinet, and he calls Draco back over to take a look, so sure is he that this negative space is emitting Dark magic. It felt like a heart-racing drop, an emptiness he’d wrongly called hunger so long ago, but worse. It’s dizzying. He waits to be corrected, but it never comes.
“Mm, not likely. Past early evening they almost always throw in the towel. I think they’re scared of the dark…”
An hour after their dinner break he’d felt for a trace on Draco’s wand and described it as “like, er, magnets, maybe.” This, at last, encouraged Draco to call it a night, only after promising Harry he could come back the next day.
Something passes between them—the companionship of mutual hatred. “I hate to say it,” Ron adds, “but he’s worse than when Malfoy had an Imperius on the department. No offence. You can’t just Vanish a history of hating Malfoys, especially Lucius.”
“It’s fine, Harry, it’s fine,” Draco rushes in, sitting on his knees beside him. “It’s my own version. No loss of REM sleep, no grogginess, no addictive qualities. If you fall asleep on your own, it simply prevents dreams.”
something,” he mutters, throat vibrating against Draco’s mouth. “Murray’s stepping in. This goes deep.”
He dives in as quickly as though they’d never slowed into a diverted topic, rambling with a captivating excitement, his expression alive with thrill. It is infectious.
Harry stares for a moment. It’s all bark, no bite. He can tell. The almost rote insults, the pinched expression. Yes, he clearly hates that it’s Harry who’s come, but there’s a hint of something less confident in his darting eyes and the way he continues twisting his wand in his hands rather than slotting it back up his sleeve like he used to be so keen to do. Instead of showing sympathy, Harry makes a calculated choice to save him the pride he seems to urgently be clinging to.
Harry snickers in surprise. “I have to talk to him. But it’ll have to wait until I’m back from the Ministry.” He stands and kisses him quickly. “I just wanted to tell you and check in.” When he reaches out to touch Draco’s cheek, he catches his wrist, face pinching crossly.
When he finishes, she gives him a curt, distracted smile, already turning back to her work. “Well, thank you for the update and do continue informing us of any major discoveries.”
As his eyes search desperately to try and catch a glimpse of Draco, his elbows pull him closer to the light. There—the back of a blonde head, sitting upright with his hands magically bound behind his back.
He reaches out with his recently-shoed foot, knocking Draco’s much shinier leather oxfords. “You’re too young to be old.”
“This is incredible, I don’t even know how to thank you… There’s—You don’t know how much this means to me.”
Draco feels as though his arm is close to falling off. “Thank you, Professor Flitwick,” he says earnestly, extracting his hand.
“Auror Potter!” Murray tries to act unflustered by his sudden entrance. It’s an attempt to save face, as everything is with Murray, but it only makes Harry roll his eyes internally—only a fragile man would think it worth his time to mask such a minor moment of surprise. “What’s brought you so… unexpectedly into my office?”
“Good?” Harry breaks the silence, loudly and indelicately, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose again.
He knows only that he’d been woken from sleep by a harsh pounding, thrown behind a closed door yet again, and forced to listen with an ear to the wood to hear anything at all. He couldn’t place any of the voices, but he
“Lucrezia got her position because she was good at her job.” He puts his feet up on the desk, regarding Ron’s own casual position behind the Potter nameplate and considering wistfully how often and easily they used to escape to do just this. “It’s going to be strange without you here. Honestly,” he says.
Draco had apologised by meeting him at Spoonfuls, by accepting the consultation, by teaching him tracing. He had apologised by choosing Harry—seeking him out on his stoop while escaping the press, tumbling through his floo when he’d been injured. Most of all, he’d put Harry in his debt with a trip to India.
Draco closes his eyes, but when he closes them he sees Harry curled on the rug, so he opens them again.
He finishes the last sip of his tea and waits patiently in the silence for a natural change in the conversation to release him from such serious talk.
“I wanted to take you somewhere where everything is older than any of us. There’s a… erm, a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson. ‘How cunningly nature hides every wrinkle of her inconceivable antiquity under roses.’”
“Well, well, look who had success!” Harry strolls toward him, tucking a small wrapped package into his bag. “What did you find?”
“The first chapter is a complete first draft on lightly-cursed objects—sting-hexed diary, a couple of other case studies, then some explanation of the curse theory and the arithmancy. The second chapter’s the same format but for an Unforgiveable.”
He gets to his feet slowly, carefully, turning back to the desk. He considers the very real fact that this is Potter’s fault. He’s never usually this distractedly sappy and retrospective. Only upon seeing—
Harry senses his temper rising dangerously as the curtains cut off his view of the hall, where half the crowd had moved towards the exit and the other half towards Agnes. He twists his shoulders, finally shoving out of the security wizards’ hold, and immediately bolts towards the part in the curtains, crashing directly into Ron coming through the other side.
She sets him with a familiar, deep stare; a stare that Draco has known for a lifetime as one that could scan him and decipher every thought he wouldn’t say. Then, she gave him a slow, careful nod.
He pulls his wand out, taking the napkin remains and whispering an incantation he hasn’t verbalised in years. It folds effortlessly into a fat pigeon and flaps over to Ginny, landing on her shoulder. He sips his drink as he watches her extend a finger in front of it. The pigeon hops on and sits contently as she moves her finger from her shoulder towards the centre of the table, then leaps off her hand into the air, exploding into a mushroom of ash, which, if Harry’s performed the charm correctly, should land in front of Ginny’s seat neatly spelling
“Then perhaps… a house with a Fidelius charm would be beneficial,” she added slowly. Then, another look with Ron, suggesting that they’d been debating when to mention Grimmauld Place. Did they think he couldn’t see those, after all these years?
He’s surprised to find that Potter looks different in person these days than the snippets he’s caught in the
The dining room table is, once again, flooded with papers as he works to properly organise the case studies for his completed chapters. The flat is filled with tense silence, quiet enough to hear a pin drop, which is proving distracting because it only further reminds him that he’s gotten so used to the sounds of Harry moving about the study.
“You smell like firewhiskey,” he says coolly, hands thrown into the pockets of his robe, cocking his head at Harry. The easiness of it only adds to his angry bewilderment.
His breath catches when Harry moves incomprehensibly closer—close enough that the tips of their noses almost touch. He could lean in like before and close the distance, but he can’t seem to move. Maybe he needs to know that Harry wants this just as badly as he does. He needs Harry to be the one to do the leaning.
What happened with Emilia was so trivial to him that he’d pushed it fully from his memory, refused to consider it as something worthy of marring an otherwise fine trip to France. Out of sight, out of mind. It was sharing a cigarette, perhaps, that made her feel like things were as they’d always been, enough to brave pulling him in. But things couldn’t have been more different.
“No one helps me practice with him,” she tells him in her native tongue. “I want Victoire to speak it just as easily as English.”
“Great,” he says, a bit muffled as he puts his mouthpiece in. He sets his glasses outside the ring and gives Draco a final encouraging nod, then touches fists amicably with Lars, bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet.
Draco nods. He wants to be anywhere but here in the moment, feeling a bit nauseous when he replays his moment of shocking vulnerability met with a mother’s chores. He fleetingly considers running and grabbing the cursed skull again, instigating a trip to St. Mungo’s just to escape.
This was likely one of the less proper things to say, but he can’t tell anyone else and he’s not sure he’ll be on discursive terms with Draco in the near future.
Harry does, with worry and relief and something deeper, so glad to feel the warmth of his skin, and when their lips part he pulls him into his arms again. “Thank god,” he murmurs. “Thank god.”
“I trust the Healers, but I’ve found that the wizarding systems often ignore the benefits of Muggle medicine.”
“Maybe he just needs time,” Harry muses. “You were a bit off when you first found out, too. And then over time, you realised I was still just myself.”
“Hermione caught me just after I got in this morning, said she’d gotten a firecall that the closing arguments for her case had been moved forward to half an hour from then.”
Malfoy blinks at him, mouth slack, searching unsuccessfully for words. He looks down at his plate and back up. “Chocolate croissants,” he corrects slowly. “Certainly you’re not suggesting you’d pay me in pastries.”
He ignores her, walking away and cracking the bedroom window. He exhales smoke with his head bent awkwardly to the open air.
He distantly remembers that he’s been asked a question. “I’m out of books,” he says. “I’ve read all your history books.”
He doesn’t tell Draco this—he’d likely have to stop and explain spaceships and outer space and NASA and wormholes—but he does attribute it to this brief moment where they move on as if they both know about Flitwick and Hogwarts. In years of friendship, after all, such a mention should go unnoticed.
Marinella leans forward, meeting Harry’s eyes across the row of Aurors between them. “I’d be available later this week, Harry.”
Harry wills his brain to quiet, but it’s as if it’s out of his control, and he’s thinking of his own body, the slats of a locker digging into his back, the sound of their breathing, their kissing, their moving, fearing that his breath smells, that he’s a bad kisser, that someone will walk in, what he’ll say when they pull apart, whether he’ll have time to shower before work.
you on your little play-mission. You lot almost destroyed my hard work that first night—Malfoy by attending a gala rudely without warning, and Magnus for assigning
He folds it in his fist, closes his eyes, and traces it, just to feel the comfortably unique power built into its spellwork.
There’s an empty plate and a half-drunk mug of coffee on the dining table alongside the Prophet, and Harry picks the mug up as he travels to the couch, settling in comfortably lengthwise with his knees drawn up to his chest and his back against one arm of the sofa. He’s in joggers, hair still wild with bedhead, and Draco almost wants to confirm that he’s awake enough for the seriousness of the information that he needs to relay.
“Nothing…” When he looks up again, Jack is holding one hand out in front of him, the other on his heart with sincerity. “I just, well, to be honest, I was trying to time my workout with yours, but it seems I’ve missed completely.”
He follows her finger, then turns with his brow furrowed in disbelief. “Well, I’d expect you to look a little out of breath after you’ve just won the World Cup.”
This isn’t realistic, he knows. It’s fantasising, hardly different from any time before except that he can now remember the feeling of Draco’s lips on his. It had been so reserved; he hadn’t touched Harry at all besides his mouth. No hand lightly on his cheek, no grip on his shirt or in his hair. Nothing to prescribe it as anything more passionate than a teenaged first kiss.
So instead of sleep, dreamless or otherwise, his thoughts drift back to the peculiarity of the evening. To Malfoy’s scepticism of Harry’s motives. To the adrenaline rush of their cutting remarks back and forth. Agnes dripping blood on the ballroom floor, face frozen in horror. The emotionless conviction in Malfoy’s hardened gaze as he lifted his wand.
Draco slams the door behind him hard enough to shake the wall. His eyes dart frantically around the flat, but for what he’s not sure. Maybe to ground himself back in reality, because he feels like he’s quickly spinning out of control.
Sometimes Harry thinks his unconscious mind knows him better than his conscious. That it’s speaking to him. That in this case, it wants him to consider the fate of his last serious relationship as he loses sleep over a potential new one. He pulls the pillow back over his head.
“I hope you recognise, you are very intelligent, Draco,” he says, eyes soft with kindness. “Impressively so. You could pursue many careers. Ministry work, spell healing at St. Mungo’s, come teach here and allow me to retire.”
It reminds him of the identifiably specific traces he’d picked up the one time he’d traced Draco. As though he could feel the trace of just who charmed the necklace as clearly as if he was holding his arm like he’d held Draco’s.
“It wasn’t my secret to tell!” Blaise defends, pushing Pansy back across the table for what must be the fourth time that night. He looks back at Draco. “Sorry, but it’s been over a decade, and if the Potter jokes were getting at you because you thought I’d care about that, then I wanted you to know I know. And I don’t. Care, that is. Men
“Too much history, I suppose?” Jack is watching him closely, nodding along but trying to parse through whatever Harry isn’t saying out loud. “Alright. I just know… there’s a thin line between love and hate.”
“Finally,” he says. “I hope you all will forgive me for impressing a moment of sentimentality onto this evening, but anyone who’s read the inscription or the preface of
There are a couple of books he almost gets for Draco, but decides the greater gift would be to let him do his own browsing tomorrow and make the discoveries himself. So instead, he moves on to the local supermarket, where he quickly fills a basket with sandwiches for lunch, plus ingredients for dinner and breakfast tomorrow, and throws in some beers and milk for the tea and even some sweets by the till. When he’s fully out of sight of the village again, he magically lightens his load just a bit.
“Oh Merlin, I… Oh god, Harry—I’m so sorry,” he gasps. “I didn’t mean that. I really didn’t mean that. That was a huge mistake. I have to go.”
“How sure are you about the concussion? Because I shouldn’t let you sleep if there’s a chance. You could get… brain damage. Or something serious, I think.”
After a few moments where they sit unmoving, careful, as though balancing on the precipice of something hard to return from, Harry raises his head and meets his eyes with a newfound conviction. His lips are parted, eyes steady and pupils wide, and he locks his gaze with Draco’s while his hands slide up between his shoulders, as though to touch as much surface area he can, pulling his jumper up on the catch of his wrists and exposing him to the cold of the room. Draco shivers.
He takes Harry’s shoulders and turns him towards the mirror again, looking seriously from over his shoulder.
There’s a mist rising from the water, giving the morning a foggy tone that makes him pull his coat tighter and walk close to Draco. The walk is long and they talk warmly the whole way, knocking shoulders and kicking rocks and stopping occasionally to walk a few paces past the trail for a better view. Halfway down, Draco leaves the path to look at the water and glances around his feet. Harry unwraps his scarf unprompted and lays it on the dewy grass, meeting Draco’s confused look.
Draco frowns, as does Pansy, and when they look towards the door, there’s a second knock, clearer in their silence. She has to nudge him into action, gesturing to the door with a look like she’s worried she’ll have to teach him how to use a knife and fork later, too.
It’s just past five, so the high street is full of shoppers, people bustling home from work or heading out to meet friends. Harry is stopped much more than usual—the papers have not let up on speculating about the case and the role he might play. ‘
Draco tears his eyes away from her sad ones, wishing they could visit once and have nothing worth mentioning but the weather.
Draco doesn’t linger on it. He can imagine the series of emotions a trip like this would trigger, and simply hopes that his plans for the day will do all the cheering up.
Then, with an easiness in his step, he sets to work making the kitchen his own. The gas clicks as he turns the hob and whistles a muggle tune, moving like a dancer; swiftly turning the dial on the radio with his right hand in the same breath that he grabs a pan from below the oven. He places it on the stovetop, opens the fridge to grab a couple eggs and cracks them easily into the pan as he taps the fridge shut with an outstretched leg.
He laughs breathily, trying to appear as friendly as he wants to be. “I couldn’t speak to that. He’s great, er… He talks about you often; I suppose I should thank you for making him the man he is.”
He scrubs the cauldrons, stacks his papers into organised piles, and even reaches a point where he can see the wood surface of his desk. He’d just moved the most trip-able piles of books to the outer edges of the room when Harry’s owl returns through the window, swooping in and dropping a note in front of him.
He shucks the jeans and slithers back under the comforter, trying to make a point that he’s going nowhere, then reaches for Draco’s Belgian bun and coffee. One of Harry’s favourite Draco faces is the quiet elation when he savours the first sip of coffee and he does so now, sitting up, taking the plate and mug with a smile of thanks, and closing his eyes as he drinks. He smiles happily, but then his brows furrow in confusion.
“Indeed.” Draco leaves his tea to turn the corner into the kitchen, parsing through the drawers for a snack. “It gives the flat a much less insidious
gay at all? And Harry was an experiment? The kiss was so chaste, so cautious, it could have been investigational. After all this time together, maybe he had begun cautious of Harry’s sexuality, but it had become a cautious curiousness.
“No, I employed the Blaise method—to get over you without mucking things up. It’s a strategy from school, because I’ve known this about myself much longer than you, apparently, and had to handle the horrors of finding my best friend suddenly rather attractive.”
trying to figure out what connection you’d have with any of the Aurors… Deciding how unlikely it would be for us to have an Auror on staff in 2007 who’s still a Death Eater sympathiser. Willing to go after anyone who seems to have wronged your family. No offence.”
Having them over is comforting, more so than Harry had expected. Ron and Hermione had been concerned, but mostly for Harry and Draco only by extension. What he sees in Pansy and Blaise’s faces, however, is familiarly pained, like a reassurance of his current despair. The silence threaded between their conversations is universally grave.
Harry meets the grey eyes a breath away from his with gratitude, both knelt close over the box, and, like a life-saving reflex, stands so suddenly to escape them that he almost crushes the empty box under his foot. He quickly begins tracing the room again, and if Draco finds it especially strange, he keeps it to himself.
“Murray told me to ‘seek alternative consultants for a higher success rate’. As if you haven’t provided so much information. Can you believe it?”
Harry sighs with relief and comfort to be understood in such a way without the need for explanation, and against his more lucid, emotionless mind, he leans his head against the shoulder of the taller man beside him. Draco does nothing but put a hand on his knee in friendliness, an exact mirror of Harry’s supportive motion earlier, like he’s learning physical closeness through observation.
Instead, he reckons he must be strangely affected by his spoon hitting the floor. He quietly offers his spoon while Hermione talks, but Draco looks at it in confusion and shakes his head.
Harry tilts his head back and closes his eyes, taking a deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth—one of the temper-reducing techniques Ginny taught him years ago. He’d wanted an easy night with his friends. Instead, everyone from Hogwarts gets together under one roof and there’s blood and screaming. If that isn’t enough déjà vu, Harry’s currently resigning to the fact that he has to go handle it.
The article dredged up Potter’s history fighting Death Eaters, which called for additional ‘Where Are They Now?’ articles on ex-Death Eaters who were trying to atone, which meant a brand new expose on Draco’s past. He could always tell walking through London when his name had been in the papers again; he never saw reporters, but it was obvious, overnight, in the dirty looks of passersby and the following eyes of shopkeepers. He’d retreat, just for a week or two, into his flat like a coward.
Harry drags his thumb and index fingers down his cheeks thoughtfully when she leaves his side a few minutes later, as if he’ll feel whatever she’s seen. They don’t mention the poem.
There’s a lot that he wants to say, but clean and warm against the rise and fall of Draco’s chest, he feels for once as though it can wait. The sun is rising, light beginning to spill through the cracks of the curtains as they fall asleep, holding each other close, damaged but unbroken.
The questions he’s been asking himself explode out, then, and the debate over whether he should confront or let it go.
He'd had trouble associating anything but the Dursley’s with muggle living, but a warm, familiar feeling had begun to grow after school when he and Hermione laughed about EastEnders reruns or shared an amused look when Mr Weasley wanted to talk through the mechanics of electric kettles.
, which sends his thoughts back to the Muggle bar after his first major paparazzi experience and Harry’s fifteenth year of the same. He’s been written about plenty, but never ambushed, presumably because unlike Harry, he offered not an ounce of patience.
When they dry off and get dressed and climb into bed with spectacularly loud sighs of relief, they aren’t the least bit exaggerated, and under the covers they shift as close as possible, which isn’t close enough.
The ‘Ministry schmuck’ comment hurt, yes, but it was the identity of the man behind the words that did him in. He was surprised, after what he’d thought was friendly progress, to elicit such a livid reaction. He wouldn’t have followed Malfoy out of Boggarts if he didn’t think their relationship could be different now, and until Friday, he’d assumed they were circumstantial enemies, thrown into a feud bigger than them, fueled by old stereotypes, partisan sorting, and loads of bad parenting.
He considers himself fully responsible for the temptingly difficult next hour of his life. When Draco makes it back to his that afternoon, Harry’s changed in his t-shirt and shorts, and though he’s handled innumerable workouts by now it’s different today. Different thanks to the last week, and the last hour, and the last ten seconds, when Harry skated his hands delicately down the shoulder seams of Draco’s tee, then squeezed his arms affectionately and winked.
Harry twists the faucet and steps out to dry off, shaking the towel through his hair before throwing it loosely back over the towel rack. The wood floor under his bare feet is cold and he pads quickly down the hallway to his bedroom, where he chooses a pair of jeans and an old polo shirt for the day.
The more unlikely friendship had begun when Pansy first came to visit and saw Luna in the gardens with Neville. He reintroduced them, a nice tingly feeling filling him with pride to have diverse enough friend groups to necessitate introductions between them. They’d talked regularly while they had Draco as a dependable mutual topic, but had grown apart since he left. He regrets that.
Miraculously, Draco listens with a huff and stops his stalking, but he doesn’t sit. Instead, he stands in front of Harry with his arms crossed, fingers tapping agitatedly on his biceps. Harry’s attention falls to his hand. It brings an earlier image to mind, that same hand, and a paper-wrapped package that without Draco he might’ve touched. As it sends a shiver through him, he has a thought.
Draco would love to say that he’d taken in every inch of New Delhi that they’d visited, but he’d spent too much time watching Harry witness it.
He would like, so after another minute of quiet rested eyes, he extricates himself from the soft cushions and makes his own breakfast, yawning uncontrollably. He sits across from Draco at the table sipping at a mug of coffee. Only then, slowly, does he feel himself coming back to life, recovering from a night of fragmentary sleep.
He almost chokes out a sob of relief, and for a moment the sight of him is enough to distract him from how still the charm remains against his chest. He's trying to scan the back of his figure for any signs of injury when a voice speaks loudly, startling him.
“Oh. Those are perfect,” he concedes, a gloomy tone in his voice. He wonders how Harry’s family feels to receive such thoughtful gifts. He would feel rather intimidated. And yet, he can also imagine Harry sitting around a fire, delightfully unwrapping a pair of socks or a sweater, elated as if they were woven with gold. The prat is undoubtedly extremely gracious and genuinely thrilled with any gift. Typical.
“We’re comfortable with each other? As ourselves?” He’s not sure what’s compelled him to ask. He’s not one to talk, with the bandage on his forearm.
cracked a huge curse this morning. I suppose wait for Borgin and Burkes to find something worth my time.”
“Glory be,” Harry mutters, looking past her to where one of the Aurors is helping Draco to his feet. “I’d love to leave this basement.”
Lucrezia Bode is a strapping woman just slightly taller than Harry with a blunt bob and a blunter expression. She’s generally nice—Harry has met her husband and her two children at Auror events and they’re all cheerful and polite—but years as an Auror in the field has given her a quite acerbic resting expression. It’s simply a façade, though; when he walks through the door, she grants him a big smile.
Harry waves goodbye with papers in hand and they’re back on the street. Draco takes a second to appreciate that, unlike every other shop exit, Harry’s finally started to flag and chooses to lean against the wall and reorganise his bags.
Draco pulls his hand down from his face and pulls at Harry’s other one too. He tries to convey the level of concern he feels, recognising Harry’s passionate path towards well-meaning rashness.
As quickly as Draco had leaned forward he jumps back, wide eyes mirroring Harry’s as if he was just as much an unwitting recipient. Harry is horrified to realise he still hasn’t moved a centimetre, lips still half parted, face unmoving, while his mind works wildly trying to comprehend that one of them had leaned in and it hadn’t been him.
“I’m trusting my instincts. You’ve never been this tense about your mum. And if I thought you could cook to begin with, I’d be concerned that you didn’t want to. Even
Harry breathes out a long, shuddery breath into a smile, just to catch those grey eyes and see identification in them. Hermione squeezes his hand supportively.
Draco chuckles and whispers a spell, making the gold inside of his eyelids darken with the room. Then, he hears “Go to sleep,” and a much quieter “
Luna and Neville had gotten distracted in their own conversation when they realised Harry wasn’t about to give any substantial update on his love life. Ron, unfortunately, is awkwardly stuck with Harry to his left and Seamus perched to his right. He wishes more than anything, with a sudden wave of weariness, that he was curled by the fire in Draco’s study, sitting in comfortable silence.
Harry shrugs, trusting his word, and charms his bags back into the air. Something still has a firm hold of him, something crushing every organ that feels things, first lost in admiration that Harry should put such care and detailed precision into gift-giving, and now simply because he is nice. And today he’s been a recipient of both.
They’re almost late to Andromeda’s, so engrossed in the research, and Draco’s mind is still stuck desperately trying to decipher personal connections that he feels responsible to have the answers to when they knock on the door of a nice brick house with a fully-tended vegetable garden under the front windows.
Hands skate lightly down his back, sending more shivers through his spine. They sit on the backs of his thighs as Harry pulls urgently to direct Draco’s motion, willing him closer, and when he twists his hips just right it sends a shock of sensation through Draco’s system that hitches his breath. In the thrill of it, he considers letting go of the hold he has in Harry’s hair, letting his lips leave Harry’s, imagines his hands travelling down … but it’s over too quickly.
“Ron, Ron, that is… usually I would be very interested, of course, you know I love Ginny.” Ron gives him an unfairly meaningful look. “But I’m not in the, er, headspace for dinner.”
Harry blinks. “Jesus, what a jump. She—well, we—I’ve said before… I didn’t know how to love her the way she wanted me to anymore. She confronted me about it. I had no good excuse.”
Brilliant. Draco sets his drink down a little too hard. A bit of foam sloshes out onto the lacquered table.
“I didn’t ask if you’ve been alright since the banquet, Draco,” she says evenly, her eyes meeting his pointedly. “Please don’t think I don’t care. Rather the opposite—I’m sure I already know the answer. You’ve always been more than adept at defending your own honour.”
Dante emerges immediately from under the reading chair in the study once she’s gone and Draco meets him halfway, crouching and scratching his head.
The intrusion at least gifts him an apologetic smile from Harry, which he grasps onto desperately as an implication that he wants to be on good terms with him. Then again, he thinks, as the woman bustles over and shakes his hand profusely, he is a rather agreeable person. He’d be apologetic that his recognition had interrupted anyone. It could mean nothing.
“You have superb peripheral vision,” Draco tries into the silence, shifting back and forth on his feet.
“’Dreadful chapter opening, Draco’,” he imitates, voice gravelly. Blaise is laughing, eyebrows raised in the shock of watching him perform an impression so fearlessly. “’You must have fire safety on your mind because you’re trying to limit the
When he returns, he plates the pastries and pours the coffee into mugs, carefully balancing it all in his arms as he nudges the bedroom door open with his foot. Draco looks at him squinty-eyed from beneath the covers.
His attention strays to earlier, and the hopelessness that filled him again when the Protean Charm theory broke down. Who was he, if not a curse expert? What was this, if not a curse? He’d felt so unbelievably desperate.
—I would’ve given up on that skull ages ago, you say you’ve ‘almost’ got it once every three days. So-so… I’m not saying this well, you’d say this better. Maybe we would’ve been better off to put the pettiness behind us, but… it’s brought us to here, and if we didn’t put it behind us then, I’m glad we have now. I have at least.”
It seems like a lifetime has passed since this morning, and despite his absolute mental exhaustion, something flutters in him when he hears “Harry?” from downstairs, and he moves with speed down the stairs in socks and joggers.
He leaves Harry’s side immediately, hands clasped behind him, for the nearest path. Harry stays back, a handful of paces behind him but walking the same trail—just as Draco had somehow sensed to withdraw while he spoke to Pratik, something in him says that this is a time for independence. He sees it in Draco’s tranquil expression, the way he strolls and considers the foliage like a patron in a museum.
“Certainly you did. But I suppose I’m glad you brought it up, if it’s that bothersome. We have to work together after all, so it’s better to have it out in the open. If you’re uncomfortable, I mean. I didn’t know… I didn’t think you’d noticed that about me.”
She nods to the man against the wall, who wiggles his wand at Harry like a joking threat. Hawthorn and, if he had to bet, a unicorn centre. “And by ‘helped me’,” she says, “I mean helped my brother. A mastermind at spellwork, I’ll be the first to brag.”
“No! No, and I didn’t say anything. I was at Finsbury Park with Rosie and all of the sudden there he was jogging past us. I’d know that blonde ponytail anywhere.”
The hanging man is quickly looking worse, and Malfoy must agree, because he quickly sets the book down close to him and orders to no one in particular, “I need billywig sting, crushed lionfish spine, octopus powder, and distilled water. Preferably with a mortar and pestle.”
When he retreats to the end of the bed, Pansy and Blaise and Hermione are all staring at him, and in a flash of sheepish panic at the attention, he gives Draco’s blanketed foot a chummy punch. Draco gives him an amusedly puzzled expression.
?” Harry sounded sceptical, but stretched tall, feeling for the tool and settling back on his heels successfully. The fridge is an antique, like much of Draco’s furnishings, and closer to an old-fashioned icebox than to Harry’s stainless steel model. He said as much.
!” he growls in exasperation, falling to his knees. His hand wrapped around the skull is tight and strained, his tendons standing prominently from wrist to knuckles. Combined with the twitch of his muscles it’s clear—the Cruciatus has left him too tense to let go.
“In the Lake District. It’s completely secluded, I thought you might need a change of scenery. And I
Harry sighs to himself. He’ll have to take the inventory back at least a year. His head hurts just thinking about the tedium and tiny, endless lines of documentation he’ll be sorting through. The work is rarely as glamorous as one might expect.
Draco fixes him with a scoff and mischievous eyes. It’s a testament to their fast-growing friendship that Harry takes one glance up and reflexively back down to his paper before growling “Don’t…” in anticipation
“Fucking hell,” says Blaise, interrupting his furious attention and following his stare. “Do you think he ever stopped being obsessed with you, or it's just this wonderful Hogwarts social getting to his head?”
He’d left around three that morning, but he was past calm into steely ire at the Ministry, and a strangely platonic almost-thankfulness (almost) for Potter, as persuaded by his friends. They made plans to meet up soon, and Draco had stumbled into bed with two pacts in mind: he’d never walk into the Ministry again, and he’d avoid hypocrisy by giving his Hogwarts peers the same open mind he was so desperate to receive.
suddenly change shape incriminatingly, don’t send it to tell your fiancée that your tuxedo is ready for her to pick up.”
The room chills. He barely masks the glare he gives Murray, then turns to Phaidra. “It’s too early to worry about that. We’ll know hopefully next week when Mr Malfoy has results from his investigation.”
Draco left at the other corner, Harry realises. For the first time, he’s been privy to the full switch. Draco to Malfoy.
Harry waits with bated breath, evidence in hand, for Draco to answer the door, fingers tapping nervously on the edge of the box. Though his friend is often seen as an unpredictable man—Harry would’ve thought so too, before he got to know him as well as he feels he has—he doesn’t usually waste time anymore feeling completely unaware of what Draco Malfoy will do next. But as he stands on his doorstep today, he does.
“You just have to show up and look handsome,” she’d told him while organising the Portkey paperwork in his study. He’d listened, and when his own Portkey—all were in the form of
He grabs his arm, drawing him from his sun-soaked trance and towards the busy streets of the city. He has ‘
“I want to hear everything about this,” says Harry, letting his Quidditch excitement get to him. His mate—the professional Quidditch head of security. Ron narrows his eyes sceptically. “No, seriously, I do! I told you at work—I’m happy for you, it was just a surprise.”
Some of this he assumes Harry had already imagined, if he’d been able to catch a trace of the curse when Draco had instructed. The sympathy he’s offering makes it almost a certainty—it’s not the face of someone who hasn’t at least caught a glimpse of what the Dark magic had felt like. He hopes it’ll be worth it, if it can help them reap any information out of the Ministry offices.
He doesn’t think, just acts. It’s everything Draco might disprove of, but he has trouble believing Draco wouldn’t do the same if he were here tonight and Harry was in danger and there’s no time to be an improved version of himself so he tears the map right from the wall, charms it smaller, and escapes to the pavement outside. He disapparates as accurately to the coordinates as possible, within a few streets, then charms
Draco might blush here at the oversight, but Malfoy just stills momentarily before removing his tee with uncharacteristic ease. He slips calmly under the ropes and faces his opponent. There’s a stark contrast between his pale, lean frame and Jack’s build, though Draco’s taller still than the inches Jack has on Harry. In a professional setting, they would certainly be on the cusp of differing weight classes.
She giggles, and is still laughing when Draco appears. In the shock of finding Pansy there, Harry had momentarily forgotten the seriousness of what he’d brought along. The look on Draco’s face reminds him.
“It took my mum two attempts to get clearance to move out of the UK, because of our… history. Ex-probationary status, ex-Death Eaters… The first time she was rejected for her move to France it was on the grounds that she ‘could defect to dangerous practices upon the release or orders of her husband’.”
, when it’s Saturday, you can go to the significantly more abandoned office. Let’s not jump into actions we’ll regret later.”
Harry shakes his head firmly. “No, definitely not. In fact, I think he was trying to help her. He’s become… a better man, I think. Since school. But because he was a bully then—“
Jack sits back. He looks a bit sheepish and when he speaks, it’s without the easy confidence he’d been exuding before. “Ah, that’s… my bad. I really thought you were gay. Wishful thinking, I guess.”
Hermione’s the first to break through the awkwardness into something resembling sociability once Harry returns from placing their order.
If he can just keep her talking. She seems to enjoy it, anyway. He’d kill for Draco to try to hold his gaze, so he could somehow convey that backup is coming… eventually.
He’ll never know exactly what Draco says, can hardly imagine it, most interestingly because, despite a couple of heartfelt conversations, they’ve apologised to each other with their actions more than they ever have with words.
It goes unsaid that sleeping last night was, more than anything else, a biological necessity that had only served to interrupt the work he’s sure they’re both keen to do today. And though Draco’s body working to recover forced him into unconsciousness, Harry doesn’t seem as lucky. There are deep bags under his eyes and a tenseness in his jaw that could have answered Draco’s last question for him.
,” her mother chides, looking entirely embarrassed to be having this conversation in front of Harry.
Her help, however, is unparalleled. He brings back his potential agenda on Sunday and she adds a couple of things she’d found, but mostly praises his planning. Ron watches from afar when he’s home—his first week of work has been exciting but busy—and Rose often adds her input by pointing to a photo and making insightful suggestions like, “Big tree!”
He thinks the most enjoyable bit might be watching Harry watch others open his gifts. There’s a bright light to his face as he waits not for his own praise but for their expressions upon reception. It makes it all the more emboldening when Harry looks almost jealously impressed to see Teddy open Draco’s gift—a case with a full set of Quidditch balls.
