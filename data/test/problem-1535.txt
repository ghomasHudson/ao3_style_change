Cache pondered the notes until, "Oh Merlin! Ahhh Sanguini! Your tongue ahhhh so good in my ass ahhhhh! Cumming! Yes Sanguini!" Upon being reminded of the intimate goings on just one room over Cache and his kneazles made a beeline for the floo and left.
Cache heard Poppy say hi to Neville before telling her apprentice to follow for another lesson and sighed “my shift ends at 5:00 today. I would say you could meet me, but it’s a long story-”
Before Harry could say that he didn’t know where his vial went Frank smirked and held up a potion vial “I grabbed it before the professor went wild in the lab. I managed to some of the potions to detect spells and potions in the body, no hanks to you” the werewolf said sounding very much like he blamed Severus, but the potion master didn’t mind. Now everything made sense …
Maria shook her head “damn clever owl … I’m glad he knows. Haven’t you noticed that his sleep seems to have improved?”
XXXXXXXXXX
“of course not” Moody barked sternly “it rains here frequently so the scent would be washed away by now. I’m to do the tracking while you’re to identify him if we cross paths. Come on … I have a lead that might be exactly what we need”
“dying?” Severus gasped, his usually calm mask shattered. Did the child he vowed to protect really come so close to death when he was brewing a potion or drinking a shot of whiskey? Guilt hit the potion master like a lightening bolt …
Slowly but surely he set up the cauldron and found the recipe for a Skele-gro potion. It took several books, but he found it and thanked Merlin that he not only had every ingredient but that the vials magically labeled themselves! … he didn’t even think of that while ransacking his professor’s supplies.
“the first payment is in four weeks. Take care Cache” Sanguini said and left the new resident to settle in.
“probably not. I bet it’s waiting in his mailbox though I doubt it’s a big concern. He has enough to think about with what’s to come” Draco said cryptically before going outside with Sasha following him.
“I confined him to my quarters until he calms down” Percy said and after hugging his sister he lead the transfiguration professor to Ron leaving Ginny, the twins, Cache and Severus mostly alone. Poppy and, more importantly, the boy were too far away to hear anyway so it was as close to being alone as they could get.
Sanguini looked amused as he saw the rather relaxed boy had no fear of him. Once on the top floor the vampire pulled out a key and opened the door to apartment 405 and showed Cache around.
Harry went to the door as his kneazles immediately started cuddling the kids, "What do mean-… oh." Harry chuckled as he heard very loud moans echoing through the halls and shut the door so the kids wouldn't hear. "Ummm … ok, so who wants to have a snack?" He said and the toddlers all giggled eager for some treats. Since both Harry and Draco were tainted with potion fumes they couldn't feed little Isaac so they got Draco's parents. Narcissa especially was happy to give the baby some blood.
All those comments made no sense because these ‘reds’ and ‘greens’ look gray to him. After the first day he realized what was wrong … he was colorblind … that was something that made potion class tricky until he started listening to the sounds the potion made … and sadly the plops made by the dick spiking his potions …
“You need to keep warm,” he said, gesturing with his hand. Draco frowned at him before looking around for a way to move without leaving the car. There was nothing for it but for him to clamber over the centre console, which meant he was right on top of Harry.
‘Before you say anything. There’s something I need to tell you. There’s no need to panic, it has nothing to do with us.’ Immediately, Draco’s heartrate picked up. Harry should know by now that Draco would always panic, no matter the situation.
“Is it exhausting being so dramatic all the time? Is that why you sleep so much?” Ron asked him. He was lying flat on his back on the picnic blanket with his eyes closed. Harry had thought he was asleep until then. Draco rolled his eyes like he’d heard it a hundred times before. Which he had.
‘Go away.’ Her voice was quiet and raw, and he imagined she may well have been screaming at the staff.
‘What’s this bloody surprise, then?’ Draco asked him impatiently, he really did hate surprises.
‘And why is that?’ Draco, leaning back in his chair. Draco clenched his fists in his lap. There were things Draco didn’t discuss with anyone. He was naturally a very private man but knowing how much damage could be done should information about Harry find its way into the wrong hands was enough for him to clamp down any idea of talking.
‘It’s quite likely when you think about it.’ She looked as though she was searching his expression for some sort of agreement, but she wouldn’t find one. She sighed heavily and began adjusting the mess on top of her desk. ‘I have some friends who are in the medical profession. Researchers, not healers though. I can ask around if you’re nervous?’ He nodded enthusiastically.
It probably didn’t help that it was another Asian cuisine restaurant – Chinese this time. The waiter who handed them menus looked like Marlon Brando’s grandson, so much that Draco almost did a double take before remembering that Marlon Brando was a muggle and, if he were still alive, would by 94 by now.
'I know what you're going to say and I think you shouldn't say it.' Draco looked at Harry, startled, but he was defiant. He squared his shoulders and looked Harry straight in they eyes.
He felt a pang of worry. ‘You’re not angry with me for asking you for this, are you? I swear I don’t want to upset you any more than I have…’ Harry finished dropping the memory into the pensive and turned to face Draco who was biting his lip with anxiousness.
‘You can’t have him. I won’t let you.’ He’d been forced down a path he didn’t want too many times to let it happen again. Harry was one of the rays of sunshine in his life and he wasn’t going to let anyone take that away from him.
‘Well aren’t you a little charmer. Let’s get you pampered like the princess you are.’ Daphne led Ella over to the corner where she put her in a fancy pink gown and took her over to the basins to wash her hair. Draco and Harry hovered nearby, but she looked so excited she barely even noticed when they weren’t standing right next to her.
“Having a nice snooze?” He asked, lowering himself down next to Harry gracefully, so close that their shoulders bumped. Draco’s sleeves were still rolled down and fastened at his wrists. He must have been boiling, but Harry understood. He sat perfectly upright, tension thrumming in his muscles, and Harry wished he knew how to get Draco to relax.
‘A-a- a what? You’ve got to be kidding me. Draco, why didn’t you tell me? They shouldn’t even have put you on trial. The ruling doesn’t stand if the council weren’t aware of your medical history.’ Harry became frantic, as if the ruling from the bloody Wizengamot bothered Draco now, it was a decade ago.
“Does it have to be about something?”
‘I don’t know what else to do.’ He fidgeted nervously. He didn’t know if he should sit down or not, but then he watched as Harry pulled two mugs out of the cupboard and he realised he wanted him to stay.
“Oh I was so worried!” It was then that he realised they weren’t alone. Behind Pansy stood Blaise, Theo, Millie, and Greg. He never thought the six of them would ever be in the same place at the same time ever again, but there they were.
‘I’m really sorry, I over did it. I’m just worried about you and-’
“Oh shut up!” He scolded affectionately.
That’s how Draco found himself at the Orphanage on Boxing Day. Harry had suggested the three of them spend a quiet day in together – maybe just go for a walk. They lived in the country for a reason after all. Draco was feeling guilty about not having seen Ella though so for once it was his decision to go in. The orphanage was running on a skeleton staff over the Christmas period, and Draco knew full well some of the staff weren’t exactly perfect examples of the Christmas spirit.  Before they left, he borrowed Eltanin so send a quick owl to an old friend to ask a favour – Christmas wasn’t over just yet.
‘You sure you’ve got everything, bud?’ Harry asked him. Teddy nodded seriously.
There was a warmth burning in Harry’s chest as her voice carried on the wind like an echo. It was a rich and sweet sound that felt like it reached into his very soul. He was once again mesmerised by the way her fingers danced over the strings. He’d forgotten since that night at the open mic just how talented a musician she was; he remembered how beautiful she had looked when she forgot anyone was watching.
‘You’re wise beyond your years, little wolf.’ Teddy bristled at the nickname then flung his arms around him. Draco stumbled a little in shock, not having expected it, but soon recovered and hugged him back.
he only bought some the day before yesterday. He walked into the kitchen to find Draco stood at the island holding a slice of bread with half a pot of hummus dumped on top of it. He watched on in bewilderment as Draco proceeded to slap another slice on top of the hummus mountain to make a sandwich.
The paper crumpled in Draco’s hands as cold fury swept through him.
‘Honestly, Potter. Have you no manners? I’m trying to clean myself and you’re disturbing me. Just because you wake up looking like a drowned sewer rat doesn’t mean you can get in the way of my cleanliness. Wait your turn, there’s a good boy.’ He closed his eyes to avoid getting the next lot of shampoo in his still stinging eye area. Also so he didn’t have to look at him.
“They’re the wipers. They’re just clearing the water off the windscreen so you can see better.” He was amazed at how calm his voice sounded because he most definitely didn’t feel calm.
“Did something happen?!” He asked her in alarm. Right away Pansy’s hands came up to calm him down.
Again, Harry tasted like chocolate. He must’ve had pain au chocolat for breakfast – he always was fond of sweets. Strangely enough, Harry seemed prepared for this kind of reaction, and met his kiss instantly. Unlike their previous kiss, there were no teeth and just the right amount of tongue. Draco re-mapped the inside of Harry’s mouth as if searching for the last drop of rain in a drought. Harry brought his hands up to cup Draco’s cheeks and he could feel the callouses from years of quidditch playing. Draco had always a had strange fascination with Harry’s hands.
‘We should get on with it.’ Draco said abruptly, and the moment was lost. Harry’s face shuttered but he nodded.
‘I don’t think so. We made a deal, see? You tell me about Harry, and I set you free from your magic problem. I’m only upholding my end of the bargain. Draco looked at Harry. He shrugged as if it was as simply as popping out for milk.
‘DADDY!’ Teddy yelled loudly, almost knocking Draco for six when he charged at him. Draco’s worries were forgotten the minute he got to hold Teddy again. It hadn’t been very long, barely more than three months, but it felt like a lifetime since he’d had this.
‘How come he always gets the hugs?’ Teddy giggled and let go of Draco so he could hug Harry too.
When he didn’t respond, she tried a different tactic. “So, tell me about this project of yours.” She waved her hand idly and refilled her coffee while Draco managed a couple of mouthfuls of his mangled, and now cold, eggs.
“You must be mad! We can’t keep a fox in here!” A fox. Surprising. Draco hadn’t been able to ascertain his animagus form, not having had an opportunity to see his reflection or transform in a context where someone could inform him, but funnily enough a fox seemed to fit.
. He was still surprised she’d dropped down a peg or two, but honestly, he couldn’t think of anyone who could do a better job. Right from the beginning Hermione had been a high-flyer – although Draco used to be loath to admit it.
‘Sorry love,’ he said absently, tapping away at the phone. Except…it wasn’t the same phone.
“I want my friend back!” She burst out. “Don’t you dare sit there keeping information from me! Do you have any idea how agonising it has been? Not a word from him since September – no messages, no calls, no idea if he’s even still alive. And here you’ve been, sitting on information that could be the difference between life and death. You’re a disgrace!”
‘No I couldn’t. It’s Boxing Day anyway, today is a family day.’ Teddy snorted with derision in a way that made Draco’s guts twist uncomfortably. Namely because it was exactly the reaction Draco would have had.
‘They’re funny about that now…parents taking photos of children. Political correctness gone mad and all that. It keeps them safe though. We can always take photos of her before she goes, she loves your camera.’ Draco was overly concerned with the children having photos. It seemed silly, but without parents to dote on them, it would be so easy for their lives to pass them by without them having anything to look back on. Draco didn’t want that.
“It’s impressive.” Lyra said with wonder. “You might be able to undo the burns, but I don’t think you’ll be able to restore it to its original state. That’s the kind of thing you’ll need a professional for.”
Having said that, the orphanage didn’t stop for Christmas.
He eventually picked up the gifts for everyone and as he made his way to the fireplace, his attention was caught by the parchment left on the coffee table. It had writing on it again even though he was sure he had heard Harry explaining to Teddy how to use the map properly as he’d gone upstairs. Since he of course couldn’t ever let anything slide, he paused to read what the words said.
“And you’d prefer it if I let her go on her own, would you? You’d like me to let your girlfriend steal evidence, break into the highest security level of the Ministry, try a spell no one has heard of or used in at least three hundred years, and do absolutely nothing to help her when my own selfishness got us here in the first place? All for a man you don’t like and nearly sold out to- to-
‘Look, Malfoy, I-’
‘I see. Well, seeing as you’ve decided to grace us with you ever stunning presence, welcome to my slightly-rundown, fixer-upper abode!’ Draco said cheerfully. France really was doing wonders for him.
Nevertheless, Draco had long since assumed that all of that had been taken by the Ministry during his trial. He had no idea he had any assets to be frozen at the time. This certainly changed his plans for his move to France.
‘I don’t think so. They don’t get much do they? It’s not like the orphanage has the time or the resources to organise things like this. She really is a little angel, she deserves it.’ He shrugged. Harry sighed and sat down on one of the chairs in the waiting area. Draco followed suit.
She knew where Potter was living … she was good friends with Lily Potter so she knew about Petunia’s hatred of magic, which will help frame her abuse sense she did nothing … she was Potter’s head of house so she had access to him and lastly, she was under his control …
Focusing solely on pulling the charm Harry said the removing incantation and carefully tugged the charm away. He could actually see the charm fluttering in his hand as he set the frog aside and grabbed the plastic figure.
“are you sure you wanted to give Mickey away?” Aster asked as they walked to another floo.
The door was opened …
An older woman came to answer it “yes how can I help you?”
Hagrid said it was a place for dark evil creatures and wizards, but he wanted to make those opinions on his own. That and it struck him as strange that Hagrid, a very opinionated and impressive half giant, was the one to pick him up from the Dursleys. If it wasn’t for Hagrid’s ‘Slytherins are evil’ rant he would’ve let the hat place him in Slytherin. It on its own wasn’t that weird, but Ron and Hermione also constantly said the same thing and Harry knew he couldn’t trust them …
I’m thinking)
“I don’t … under- … stand- … what happened?” Dumbledore gasped as his singed robes and beard released smoke into the air.
“ummm … is something wrong Brian?” Narcissa asked curious as to why they were there.
Someone was standing in the aisle behind him and glancing at him through the shelves …
Severus gasped through his labored breathing “he is predictable … and arrogant” he said with slightly slurred words obviously referring to Dumbledore before looking at the old witch he has known for years “Poppy if you don’t drink this I swear to Merlin I will apparate out of here and to a place where I won’t get treatment in time”
“you’ll be safe here” Trocar said soothingly.
Severus nodded brushing off the cold stare the vampire was giving him “yes lets”
XXXXXXXXXX
Cache smiled, 150 galleons was one tenth the prices of the homes in Diagon Alley “sounds good so far. I do make potions, but I prefer using the kitchen for that … yeah, it’s weird, I know” he chuckled at the odd look the vampire gave him.
"No! We can't wait that long! There's still creature laws, restrictions and hunting going on even after Dumbledore was discredited! We need to end this and that potion will do it!" Severus yelled worried for his lover and unborn child.
"I'm speaking"
Hedwig fluttered from Vernon’s chair to the couch right behind Harry. Harry popped off the little metal tube that was snuggly attached to the owl’s left leg. It was for carrying small items aren’t beak friendly and works as an identifier for post offices … and even better, Harry knew Hedwig could take it off easily if needed!
False blue eyes snapped open and Harry gasped as a soft feeling nudged him “Hedwig?” he blinked and looked around. Finding that in his mind must’ve shocked him back to reality and to his worried owl and kneazles. He gently stroked the feathers and slowly calmed down. Nothing about that was right …
“of course” the potion master answered stoically not betraying any of the pride he felt for his student “you’re going to accomplish great things. You have already surpassed all the dunderheads I teach and considering the new DADA teacher will be Gilderoy Lockhart that gap will only widen”
Harry felt his cheeks heat up with pride for his potion and anger, he was ticked that Dumbledore was the one behind this “Dumbledore told me I had only one vault … right sorry, umm … as for my appearance I managed to get some potion ingredients and develop a potion to change my appearance … I didn’t think it would be a good idea to be recognized and I brewed a height restorer” he did tell the truth … he just tiptoed around he fact that he stole the ingredients and why he needed them …
The twins smiled as Severus placed the tray of tea on the dining table with small containers of cream, sugar, and honey “thank you Severus” the twins both purred as they turned to add sweetening to their cups … and since they didn’t button up their shirts yet they flashed a generous amount of cleavage at Severus who was blocking Julian’s view now. With the great reserve of a British spy the older wizard didn’t react. Even when the witches took their time ordering their tattoos to come back and slowly buttoned their shirts. He simply focused on putting out Julian’s potions …
“yes, why?” Severus asked genuinely confused as to how the man knew.
Lucius glanced at his son “Draco did you finish getting together everything you wanted to bring to Hogwarts?”
Minerva stood at the podium in the Great Hall and looked at the students who were waiting for their lunch, “You all may have noticed that some of your fellow students are missing as well as a few staff members. For most issues, it’s a matter of security that I don’t speak of it, but I can say that due to certain issues I will be taking the headmaster’s place,” Minerva paused to let the rush of whispers settle down before she started again, “and I will be making arrangements to find a new DADA professor. Classes will be canceled tomorrow while a new teacher is found, and you’ll see aurors and Gringotts goblins searching around certain places in the school for a few days. Be polite and do not get in their way. Now, please relax and enjoy your meal.” The Transfiguration professor said and sat down to her own meal. She mentioned the meeting set for after curfew to the others, but didn’t chat as much as she normally would. It felt strange being the only one there that may have a clear mind what with Severus still brewing or helping Cache in someway and Poppy helping the girls recovering from the love potions.
“I will try it after seeing what this school has to offer. What do I owe you?” Lucius asked.
XXXXXXXXXX
The apprentice frowned, "Couldn't I just bring them to the trial?"
The second they stepped in the transfiguration professor’s living quarters she rounded on Severus “is everything ready to reverse the love potions?”
A faint pink tinted Severus’s cheeks as he mentally cursed the vampire landlord for dragging him into a farewell make out session before he flooed to Hogwarts “very well” he said trying to not sound embarrassed, but it came a bit harsh and that gave him away. Cache chuckled as he pretended to lean over and whisper something in Severus’s ear. As he did so he carefully used a healing spell with his wand to make the bruise fade away. Once it was gone Cache sat down and pursed his lips to keep from teasing Severus, but he could tell the potion master knew about his amusement. Severus was glaring at his apprentice after all …
Anyone who said recovering from starvation was as simple as eating when there was food is a fool. It’s not so simple. When someone has spent their life on the brink of starvation the stomach shrinks. You can’t go from eating nearly nothing to scarfing down big meals. If someone truly starving ate too much too fast they could die. Eating slowly or lots of small meals is the best way to recover assuming they remember to eat. If you’re used to not eating then getting a steady routine going can be tricky. She wondered if someone was helping him.
XXXXXXXXXX
Greyback growled, “Harry is free to leave wherever and whenever he wants so lets focus on something more urgent. You both were right outside the door so you must’ve seen who attacked. Who did it?”
Severus was startled by that decision. Yes, he knew Julian’s mother and was her friend, but he had only just met the man. Despite the oddness with this situation he wasn’t going to give up a chance to be a part of Julian’s life so he took the offered quill and signed as instructed along with a drop of blood.
“sorry, but these kneazles are stubborn. It’s safer to find another place to sit” Cache said amused at his feline friends actions and as far as he was concerned it confirmed what Draco feared. These guys weren’t friends …
(I'm thinking)
“wow … never thought about it” Neville pondered impressed at the amount there was to do. If you didn’t love teaching, which Severus didn’t, it would suck to have to do all that and put up with brats all day.
“potions first little one” said the blue headmaster. He poured out the right amounts of each potion that was needed into one small cup and set it on the table for Harry. The child climbed up into the chair with his toy wolf bounding after him and the basilisk draped on his shoulders. It wasn’t tasty again but Harry gulped down his potion mixture and waited for Brian to set some food on the table for them. Brian quickly set out some food, which was at set of sandwich wraps with chicken, cheese and lettuce and started eating with Harry.
Both Narcissa and Lucius sat down and began reading the book to clear up this issue right away. they did trust Severus, but they needed a good reason to reject years of traditions. What could this school teach Draco that would be more important for him to learn sooner?
Free …
Isaac grinned, "Yeah! Vampires can't drink from vampires and babies start on a mama or papa's blood or one person's blood until their tummies and teeth are strong."
“yeah … for future reference Draco, my mother was a muggle-born witch” Cache looked down at Draco and saw that the Malfoy looked puzzled before understanding settled in followed by sadness making it clear that Draco did indeed regret what he said. Before Draco could open his mouth Cache chuckled “it’s ok you didn’t know. Now we really should go or these two kneazles will drag us there” he said as he saw Libra and Lyra sitting in the fireplace with their tails twitching impatiently.
"I'm speaking"
That response made Severus frown realizing that something greatly trouble his usually laidback apprentice “what’s on your mind? Is this about going back to Hogwarts? … or Draco?” Severus asked knowing full well that the thought of the young Malfoy learning who he really was bothered him.
Their job was done … the goblins had everything handled though it was puzzling why the ghost was found actually paralyzed floating in mid air, but they still insisted Harry, Trocar and Severus should leave. That’s when it happened …
Remus frowned at the lack of response from the boy, but he didn’t want to stop trying to get Harry away from here, “Harry, you could come with me. I knew your family-”
“have a seat Mr. Potter. I am Griphook, the manager of you vaults. I must say it took you long enough to meet us. That’s not a good way to handle finances” the goblin sneered with a disapproving glare.
“owow ow!” Frank whined after the full moon night. Like always he was weak, sore and tired, but this time there was a terrible pain in his back tooth. Since he wouldn’t stop whining Trocar dragged him into Harry’s apartment where Severus and Harry were talking over some tea. Most of the conversation seemed to be about a certain Longbottom and more feeling guilty on the professor’s part.
” Mr. Weasley corrected harshly as he placed a comforting hand on his only daughter’s shoulder when he saw her flinch at what Ron said “I can’t believe you’d treat your family in such a way. It’s terrible” Arthur said disappointed in his young son.
“along with the entire store it seems” Cache chuckled as he handed over the bottomless bag of sweets “I’m not looking for a Sugar Daddy you know”
In a split second the vampire landlord appeared, "Oh really? Now, now, little one. Don't chew your mama." He said sweetly as he stuck his finger into the corner of the child's mouth to get him to let go of Severus' arm, which was raw since the baby half vampire's fangs were pointy, but couldn't pierce the skin cleanly like an adult vampire's would. Sanguini took his love's freed arm and sank his fangs in smoothly. "There we go little one. Drink up." He said as he watched his son lap at the blood happily.
’ Julian paused to think as his Daddy headed to the floo in town to take them home. The scales under his fingertips got him thinking. Scales are harder than stone and Aster wears jewelry that had pretty gemstones in it so that’s a place to consider “Daddy, are there any blue stones?”
“No. I . Didn’t.” Severus said firmly in a dangerous tone that would scare the hell out of anyone.
“Harry has some ideas, but no decisions yet. That’s ok though, there’s plenty of time” said Brian as he gently ruffled Harry’s hair unknowingly making little Harry blush.
“indeed … that’s where I’ve been brewing” Severus commented dismissively secretly feeling great amusement from his friend’s surprise.
The blonde smiled “that sounds great! Which potion would you like me to brew?”
“yes! This year should be very different with Cache there” Draco said excited for the start of school “I’m just not looking forward to seeing Lockhart there. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s only teaching to be near Potter and leech off his fame”
XXXXXXXXXX
Cache chuckled as he noticed Draco shot a light glare at Blaise for telling personal things. He remembered what the young Malfoy said about Blaise and they did seem to be on good terms “fluffy things huh … thank you for telling me this. May I help with that?” Cache asked as Blaise was looking for a spot on the rack to put his trunk.
“everyone was talking about these books supposedly talking about Harry Potter and his charmed heroic life and it was getting annoying. As for Sasha … some of the older students were making fun of her and she wanted to show them what a real familiar can do” Draco said knowing full well that his jackal can handle herself. All familiars can develop magic or already be magical thus why a bond can develop at all. Plus she was a jackal, who are creatures often connected with the moon, trickery, adapting and mate for a lifetime, so she was cunning. If she got into trouble she could tap into Draco’s magic.
Against the others warnings Harry took the unconscious wizard back to his apartment to tend to the injuries … under the watchful gaze of Trocar and Frank, of course …
"You remember it quite well!" Draco smiled as he adjusted his grip on the wiggling fussy child in his arms.
Severus smiled a genuine smile “I think we will get along just fine. Before we do counters we need to do diagnostic potions”
"Since the professor is ill could you sign these?" Hermione asked as they each handed Cache a form.
“whoa … what happened?” Cache blinked.
XXXXXXXXXX
“I’m not. I don’t know for sure, but I always wondered why Sirius Black never had a trial and Dumbledore’s first act as your guardian was to seal away your parents wills, but nothing can be discovered there until you gain access to your accounts so we won’t know if Black was the Secret Keeper for your parents. The last is a friend of your mother’s who is your godmother, Alice Longbottom, she is with her husband in St. Mungo’s and was declared insane”
“I’m going to get them” without another word the headmaster swirled away into tendrils of silver gray smoke and silently apparated away …
Frank watched in the background with the two kneazles as the potion was bottled into 20 small vials “that will be tricky. What are you going to do? Tackle the idiot to the ground and force him to give up a hair?”
“indeed” Severus said as if he was still unconvinced and Harry was freaking out on he inside because Trocar looked pissed.
Clearly anyone helping him must die and the boy’s memory altered, but that’s easy and the compulsion spells in the Dursleys’ and school will help. Finding him will be tricky because of those restrictions for international travel, but with one owl he can get permission. He jotted down a quick letter requesting a meeting with Fudge, who will of course say yes, and sent it. Once the boy lands he will apparate him back.
“the Minister isn’t allowed visitors”
“we have 16 different clubs. You saw the young man walking around the students down there? His name is Stephen and he handles the Mind & Magic class and the art club along with special classes for older students who need more help controlling their powers. Other clubs are music, chess and various sports clubs including dueling, soccer, karate, tennis, basketball and quidditch. Since I mentioned it Mind & Magic will be the first class you boys take” Brian explained as he looked down at the boys. He frowned slightly as Draco seemed to be glaring at Julian.
Draco sat anxiously waiting for the floo to flare. It felt almost as bad as waiting for Teddy to come home at Christmas except this time he didn’t have as many secrets to tell. Harry had gone to Hogwarts to bring Teddy back himself. Draco had wanted to go too, but Harry thought it might be too much after the distance they’d apparated. He hated agreeing with Harry but he knew when not to push it.
was pounding in time with the beat of his heart and he was struggling to concentrate. His fingers itched to reach out to her, but he forced himself to stay where he was.
Why was his husband kissing Oliver Wood? Draco walked away from his mother as fast as he could without drawing too much attention to himself. He hurried around the circumference of the pond until he was standing right behind Wood, who was still sticking his tongue down Draco’s husband’s throat. He tapped politely on Wood’s shoulder and the two broke apart. He briefly saw Harry’s look of surprise before he took a swing at Wood’s annoying face.
‘Thank you for coming to get me, and for letting me put the star on the tree. I love you.’ Teddy slipped under his bed covers.
, Draco thought.
Kingsley’s secretary wasn’t even in yet when Draco arrived, so he knocked directly on Kingsley’s door.
‘Hm. This is an interesting way to wake up,’ he flirted, kissing Draco again. His hands ran up Draco’s thighs and Draco took a deep breath.
He slipped the ring on, the cold metal stinging his finger just a bit, and he hauled himself into bed, fully clothed. He fell asleep dreaming of jet black hair and green eyes.
‘I hate her.’ Teddy said, his voice muffled against the dark material.
‘Excellent. Please do also consider what I’ve said about bringing Harry with you. I really do think it would improve your recovery by leaps and bounds. I expect to see you at the same time each week for the next eight weeks.’ Draco breathed a sigh of relief when he left the room. He despised those sessions and the supposed
“Hello Harry! I do hope your kidneys are well. Did you know it’s a very important time to not be afraid to be who you really are, despite what is expected of you? It’s a waxing crescent today.” She spoke in a rush. Harry honestly had no idea what she was talking about, but he went with it as usual. Typically, it was his policy not to question Luna too much, for fear of getting answers to questions he didn’t really want to ask.
‘If you leave hickeys on me like a horny teenager, Potter, I swear I’ll-’
‘Father.’ His voice echoed through the dimly lit room.
Stilled puzzled, Harry grabbed his denim jacket from the hooks by the door and slipped an extra packet of sugar snaps into his inside pocket. He’d discovered the easiest way to travel with Aspen was to hold onto him. Being a fox, he didn’t like that very much, so Harry hid his favourite snack inside his jacket and allowed Aspen to ‘dig’ for it. It was genius if he said so himself.
“I er, thought you might be able to help me with something. For Sirius. He said you see him sometimes?”
‘Don’t sugar coat it, Harry. It wasn’t your fault and I don’t have a bit of a problem.’ He said to the window. He heard Harry sigh from behind him and the sofa creaked slightly as Teddy shifted.
He was so unbelievably tired of thinking all the time and getting absolutely nothing done. He should be out there, using every spare moment to find Potter, to bring him home, to explain everything and right his wrongs. But instead, he was stuck in the dark, wasting away when he might be the only one who could fix things.
‘Oh gosh. It looks terrible doesn’t it? I’ve been completely restructuring the filing system. Honestly, I swear a bunch of utter morons ran this place before I got here. I can’t make head nor tail of the logic behind the filing. It’s a wonder the Ministry has been functioning at all.’ She pulled her wand out and waved it across the room, sending a few of the piles of papers to one side so that there was at least a path from the door to her desk.
He drummed his fingers on the countertop nervously. He couldn’t sit still. Harry had only been gone ten minutes and already Draco could explode. He didn’t know if it was more nerves or excitement anymore, it hardly even mattered.
‘Of course not. Take my room, I’ll take the sofa. You should floo Ron though, let him know in case he worries.’ Draco offered her a tired smile and gave her some privacy to floo-call her husband while he went to get some spare blankets for himself. It took him a few minutes to find them since he hadn’t needed them since he’d moved in.
‘I don’t know.’ Harry said defeatedly. That surprised Draco.
Then there was a sound of shattering class from down the hall.
“You don’t look so fresh either,” he shot right back, referring to the kink in her hair and the bags under her eyes. If there was one thing their relationship suffered from, it was that they were both inclined to insult when stressed.
‘Of course! Genius surprise. Would you excuse me for a minute?’ He turned before he could see Harry’s face crease into a frown. He walked away from the living room as calmly and steadily as he could manage and went upstairs to the bathroom, closing the door slowly and quietly behind him. Then all hell broke loose.
‘Because you’re absolutely miserable and I’m sick of looking at your stupid face.’ She said bluntly.
He was just about to give up and turn in early for the night when he felt a shift in the wards around the house. Draco had taught him a lot about how to attune himself to the house and it had been a very difficult process without the necessary Black blood. Thankfully living in the house with an actual Black descendent had helped. There’s no way Harry would’ve got the stuffed house elf heads off the walls without Draco’s help.
‘I’m sorry, baby. I know how much it means to you.’ He whispered gently in his ear. Draco sniffled again but rested a hand on top of Harry’s where they held onto Draco’s stomach and Harry knew he was getting through to him.
‘Come on then, lets sign you out.’ Harry checked in on Teddy who was upstairs building Lego with a little boy called Peter who was the oldest at the orphanage and would be going to Hogwarts next year. Teddy seemed to be making it his own personal mission to prepare Peter for the school. Draco had had to bring Harry with him since he wasn’t an official staff member and as such wasn’t able to take the children out on his own. He maybe could have left Teddy at home on his own – he wasn’t a small child anymore – but the idea worried him far too much.
He added towards a trunk, loud enough for those outside to hear. Ted gave a sad smile as a bang sounded before giving a fake cry of pain. “I can figure it out. Just... give me some time.”
Draco bit back a pained smile. Harry usually talked nonsense when he was half-asleep.
"Welcome, welcome!" Bellatrix greeted, sashaying into the foyer like she owned the place. Harry had very (very) little respect for Narcissa and Lucius, but he had at least hoped they would be the ones running the show instead of the demented aunt. Hermione made a choking noise, leaning away from her as Bellatrix bounded a bit closer, looking them over eagerly. "Oh, how lovely. Just... how
“It’s like a book that you watch,” Draco said, “Sometimes it shows real people, but there are also these drawings… right now we’re watching this new one about lions,” He frowned a bit, “The lions talk for some reason. I tried to watch it last night, but it made me mad.” He explained.
“I see myself… throwing this tea cup at your head.” She said and Draco placed a hand over his heart in offense. “This is such a waste of time.” She muttered, placing the cup down. Draco gave a weak smile in return.
“How do I access their magic?” He asked as Harriet peered out from Draco’s bag to slither up and absently poke at the knives. Severus ignored her.
“Are you trying to recruit me?” He asked. Blaise raised an eyebrow. “I’ll have you know that I’m discussing my potential reconciliation with Graham Montague, but thanks.” He muttered and went to turn away. Blaise grabbed his arm.
“Neville?” He called. The plants seemed to perk up at the name with leaves and petals fluttering about. He followed them, reaching one end of the greenhouse where Neville was gently using a dropper to put some sort of orange substance near the base of a purple flower. “Hey.” He greeted. Neville jumped.
“Obviously the dream was credible considering Mr. Weasley is at St. Mungo’s,” Harry answered hotly. Draco felt his own temper rising dangerously. He wanted to tell. He wanted to tell so
… her irises were brown, which made her whole appearances a bit jarring).
His luck seemed to be worsening by the second. Potter’s atrocious hair bounded towards the table, his eyes bright and wide as he looked wildly around while the Hall erupted with applause, the idiots around him screaming in glee.
“Yeah, but it’s still your name,” Draco told him, mystified, “And a connection to your family. I thought you liked that kind of stuff.” He said and rolled over on his stomach to hover over him, trying to gauge his expression even in the dim lighting of the stars and moon.
Ugh. Draco could not believe he married one of
“I care too, you know! Though… well, he is an idiot so he sent me to ask,” she told him, not bothering to deny being used as a very bad spy. “I don’t actually think he’s terribly upset at you. Just concerned.” She shrugged. “They all are.”
at least. Draco knew Harry was a little disappointed it hadn’t been his father he had seen earlier, but… well, Sirius was right to say in a way it was.
“You dress well,” she greeted with a small smile. Draco scoffed and held out his arm, “I also did some research,” she added as she took it and began walking down the hall. “You did not tell me you were disowned.”
“Oh, and
“Ah, very good. Set it there.” He grumbled without looking away from the mirror. Draco curiously looked it over. He could see a few figures moving faintly, but none of them made a definitive shape. Draco dropped the book with a thunk and turned to leave. “Wait.” Moody called.
“Ah, well. I’ll admit it’s humor is lost on me - and who did you ask here, my boy?” Slughorn asked. Ugh. Right. Okay. Draco inwardly felt himself melt as the table turned to him, eyes curiously looking him over with a level of expectation. This was clearly a segway to ask much more personal questions about Harry and Draco’s relationship that he just wasn’t ready to delve into. Not now. Not in front of all these people. He glanced over at Harry who seemed to be thinking along similar lines as he watched the table warily. From where he was seated next to Lavender, Ron took a bite of chicken before raising his eyebrows at them both.
The world began to tick.
"Well? What is the answer, Cissy?" She asked. Narcissa straightened up and turned to face Voldemort. When she answered, the words bounded across the woods. Draco had expected them, but they cut no less when she spoke - looking the Dark Lord straight in the eyes.
“Of course,” Ron snorted and Draco paused, “What? I’m just saying it isn’t a surprise that you made your boyfriend the most important piece on the board is all.” He said. Draco blinked a few times before spluttering.
“What!?!”
Needless to say, Harry had spent the past couple days being bitter over the whole ordeal after he told Sirius and was properly told off in return.
(See the end of the chapter for
or else he won’t give us the points back!” Lavender Brown hissed and Harry scowled at her until she went back to her own potion.
"Stay safe out there, you guys," she said gently and then turned to where more Slytherins were watching uncertainly, "Let's go! Follow me!" She called and waddled off with the group following her. Astoria skipped over to Harry with a bright smile.
"No! No, of course not," he said and then paused and looked at Hedwig. Hedwig tilted her head before looking at where some other owls all paused to also look at Sirius as if sensing he was lying. Draco waited. "Well, yes, actually. Pretty much everyone. In the Order, anyways. Nobody who would make your life difficult knows - like no Death Eaters know. Well, nobody difficult except... um..." He rubbed the back of his neck. Draco narrowed his eyes.
“Hey-” Colin started, but fell silent under the weight of Draco’s glare.
Draco was like... ninety-five percent sure he wasn't going to answer.
“Hey, uh, you’re okay right?” Draco called after him. Harry paused in where he had a brief conversation with a painting to wave at him. “Harry - you… you’re okay?” Draco asked.
“Ron has earned that,” He finally said and Draco gave a small smile before nodding. “You and I cause too much trouble.” He added as an afterthought. Draco bit back a grin. That was probably true… Draco might be an unwilling participant in some of those adventures, but he had always been there to ensure it was a spectacular mess.
“Narcissa disowned you?” Sirius asked and Draco shrugged. It was probably more his father, but he did feel a sense of betrayal at her lack of fight on the matter if he was being completely honest. “Huh,” Sirius mused and tapped Draco’s chin with a grimy finger. Normally, Draco might gasp at being touched by someone so filthy, but he felt too defeated to care much. “They weren’t very nice people, my parents.” He said softly. Draco sighed.
“I can be a double agent. Like Severus.” He said, leaning forward. Sirius scowled back at him. “Dumbledore said I could if I proved I could help him this year...but the more I think about it..." Draco said and stopped himself. He didn't
"Pureblood custom," he said softly, "Putting your wand at someone's feet is highest form of respect you can give someone."
Draco groaned and hugged her. “....I’ll join SPEW if you stop crying.” He said and Hermione looked up at him with a watery smile.
His father didn't respond. He looked far too lost to his own thoughts. The others had already started leaving - pops following them all disappearing now that they had their fill of violence for the evening so that only Draco, Lucius, and Macnair's floating body remained.
“They don’t scare me,” She sniffed. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Montague will fall a lot harder than I will if knocked off his broom,” she said wisely. He couldn’t argue that. “Look, just… don’t be stupid.” She sighed and reached over to pat his arm. “Because if you are… I’ll hex you.” She grinned and got up.
“Ron!” She called brightly, and the gangly boy walked over to them with wide eyes and tense features.
"No, we're not," Hermione reassured him. Draco stared. They had to be. Look around them. He couldn't really find a way to voice it. Hermione's hands felt like the only real thing in the world. "I know," she continued - like a chant - "It doesn't feel that way, but we're
No. No, definitely not. That was... impossible. The
"Look around, Draco," Ron said and gestured to the room, "This is Fleur and Bill's house. You're safe." He promised. Draco edged away from them. Slowly, Harry reached out in an attempt to calm him, but Draco flinched away. Harry froze. There wasn't a single memory where... if they were arguing and Draco felt guilty he might cringe away, but... not like... not like this. Not as if Harry was an actual threat. Not as if he was
Maybe that should have made him feel better. It didn't.
“Hello everyone,” Dumbledore greeted calmly. Draco had to fight not to roll his eyes. “I see you have captured one of my students, Bellatrix.” He added and pulled out his hand, “If you would kindly release him that would be much appreciated.”
“Let’s see,” Hermione mused, tapping her wand against her arm, “All of us meeting… including Draco’s charming introduction on the train.” She added. Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh! When you two first rode your brooms like idiots,” she mused, “Our sorting, obviously-”
“We don’t know everything about the universe!”
"No. Well, yes. I was. My plan was to just schedule days where I yelled at you about saving my life until I died," he informed him and Draco bit back a smile, "But now I see that if I hadn't been for your... stubbornness, that my daughter would be an orphan and grandson without any grandparents at all." He said and ran a hand through his hair. Draco bit his tongue.
"It's probably Delacour," someone said behind them, "She couldn't make it through the second task either."
“I’m sorry.”
“I’m suggesting they tortured him into submission!” Moody shot back, “They kept him locked away. Severus, did you ever see him for more than five minutes at a time?” He demanded. Draco rolled his eyes.
Which was actually kind of weird. Draco may not like Dumbledore, but Harry did. It seemed very...out of character for him to be so chipper about the man condemned the death over a cursed hand. Maybe he had gotten over it? Perhaps he already mourned over the summer.
“Wow, you know where to put your hands.” Draco said dryly and Harry rolled his eyes, “You know, somehow you seem ten times less awkward now then you did back there.”
, well, we will be when that happens! You have nothing to worry about!"
"Yeah, love the aesthetic."
“A letter to your aunt?” He asked coldly. Draco frowned.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
“So, you’ve decided to continue down this foolish path.” He greeted dramatically because Severus was probably the most dramatic man ever to exist. Normally, it was something Draco found admirable in him, but given recent events he found he wasn’t in the mood.
Right. He regretted this line of conversation deeply. Harry reached over to tap his hand impatiently.
“I really think it’s just sprained-”
“Voldemort.”
The answer was obvious, of course. There was still a war to be fought. The snake still needed to die. Then Voldemort himself and if Harry was gone... Draco might have to take up the mantle. Chosen One or not.
“Really? What does my name being Henry have to do with the kind of people my parents were?” He asked skeptically. Draco shook his head.
“If I see it again,” Draco said, jamming his wand right under the stupid sixth-year’s chin, “I’ll make sure you get a firsthand demonstration of Moody’s lecture of unforgivable curses.” He hissed.
Draco had never thought what it would be like to see the infamous Black sisters duel. Andromeda had once said they had been pitted against one another often as children. That they became so familiar with their dueling styles that the whole thing became a sort of routine. He now saw exactly what she meant. This could barely be classified as a duel. It was... something else entirely. A dance, maybe. It seemed to enrapture the attention of both sides as light flew back and forth while they each deflected and dodged with ease. The strikes were fast and consistent. Bellatrix was clearly breaking under the pressure of both her sisters. Neither were taking turns. Andromeda and Narcissa struck again and again with little mercy as Bellatrix was reduced to going completely on the defensive. She alternated between protego charms and summoning bits of the earth to rise and serve and physical barriers between her and the spells.
Draco felt like punching Dumbledore, quite frankly. Who doesn’t
“I’m not usually volatile?”
Well, that was something. Shaking his head, Draco walked inside to find Hermione and Harry gathered in the corner with a gold chain between them. Before he could ask what was happening, Hermione grabbed his arm and pulled him over to toss something around his neck.
“Hey!” Draco yelled and hurtled himself around the corner, “Don’t you ignore me!” He growled. His father froze. He could sense the change in the atmosphere - from cold and wary to electric with a defensive energy crackling between them. Draco didn’t cringe away from it though. Instead he marched forward, ignoring curious whispers coming from the portraits around them. “What are you doing here?” He asked.
….Draco regretted putting on this stupid hat. What the
Draco opened his mouth. Was that a joke? It had to be. Dumbledore would have to tell Harry, right? He would have to. It didn’t make sense that he wouldn’t.
Deciding Remus was really the best person for Sirius at the moment, Harry quietly left them alone, strolling around the house. He wanted to visit Draco - or at least attempt to. He gave a weak look towards the door at the top of the staircase and sighed. What he actually needed to do was talk to Griphook... again.
“That’s not the sa-”
I think the main thing I can promise is that Sirius will live... Also, as I'm finishing up year 6 I'm finding that one is LOTS of fun with Slughorn and all the awkward teenage stuff. So. That's gonna be good fun. Just survive some of the torment I'm about to put you through :D
His fingers trembled and Draco put down his quill to regain his poise. The thought that he no longer had a home felt like a stab to the chest. He had failed his family and was now losing everything. Taking a deep breath, he continued to write.
“Well,” he said instead, “I’m going to not get murdered and make this potion.” He said brightly, carefully picking out some other ingredients so the gillyweed would remain inconspicuous. He wondered if Severus would just give it to him if he said what he was really doing… not a chance he was willing to take. “Thank you, Severus.” He added when he had what he needed.
"He left her with Snape so he had access to the basilisk's skeleton," he explained. Hermione's mouth parted slightly with realization before gently returning Harriet back to Snape with a solemn nod.
“Yeah, but for a different reason. I’m beginning to think I’m not a pleasant person to be around.” Draco said lightly. Neville snorted. “Hey, Zach!” He called and Smith’s eyes darkened slightly at the nickname.
“Don’t be sorry,” he snapped, “Be prepared. I won’t accept stupidity as a pupil.” He told him and grabbed the black box Draco had reached for earlier and opened it, “Since you seem to be a fan of baby steps… we’ll try this.” He said and clicked open the box.
"Potions professor from Brazil. Very pretty. Her voice lures you to tell the truth. As an auror I want to put her in my pocket and keep her forever." Dora said brightly and gave Draco one last smile before dashing off towards the end of the hall making a left at the end towards the West end of the castle. Draco smiled fondly after her before going back to the window to see where Theo had placed the Mirror of Erised out in the courtyard. Dozens were casting spells around it as Hermione walked around giving various orders for preparations. From behind him, Remus moved.
“Yeah… yeah! We are!” James agreed. Apparently not then. Sirius clapped his shoulder.
Draco was too tired for this.
“Shut up before I paint over you.” He threw back, “Sorry. Ignore him. He’s an attention seeker.” Sirius said. Regulus gave a small gasp. Draco offered a weak smile before looking down at his lap.
Huh. Cars. Fascinating.
“A howler?” He asked and Draco fixed him with a cold look, “You can try running out with it?”
"You-" she began, jutting out her chin as her eyes filled with rage. Harry took a step away from her. Nope. He loved Ron, but maybe not enough to stand in between him and a furious Hermione. He glanced over, fully expecting Ron to go sprinting off in the other direction, but he was already shaking his head. Before Hermione could continue he raised his hand so a golden watch swung on a chain.
"You're playing your part a little too well," she hissed at him and Draco felt his heart rate pick up, "Are you sure you know where your loyalties lie, Draco?" She asked and then jerked up before he could respond, pointing her wand directly in front of them, "
“So. Right.” Draco muttered and sat up to peg Ron with what he hoped was a terrifying glare, “Do not freak out, okay?” He said and when all three of them nodded, sighed. “Theo just… likes someone else. We thought it would be better if we called it off early.” He explained and for a second all was silent before –
"Where the bloody Hell did you get those?"
He was truly alone then.
“Don’t worry, Vincent, it won’t require too much thinking on your part,” she scoffed, “I only wish to teach him a small lesson in manners-”
Draco stopped tugging at the end of his sleeve to give her a questioning look. He liked Fleur… a lot. But he had only just met her so he wasn’t sure why she was being considered a candidate as his best friend. Also, why couldn’t Fleur be? Hermione shrugged as if reading his mind.
And yet… it was what bothered him the most.
“It’s okay if your feelings are hurt,” he said finally, deducing what must be going on. Hermione’s eyes flicked from the water to him. “He’s your friend. Just because they chose Ron to be the person who he would miss most doesn’t mean he cares for you any less.”
This was weird. Draco felt like he was missing a piece of the conversation. Theo's words weren't malicious... Draco had definitely said worse things about Harry. There was just a note he couldn't quite decipher. Almost as if Theo was trying to push something out of him. From somewhere above the maze, red sparks flew up, crackling across the sky.
Neville was so nice. Draco had always known it… and been a little terrified of it, honestly. It didn’t make sense to be that nice. There wasn’t an inch of snarkiness or even sarcasm to him. He was just… sweet.
“Harry’s uncle. He hates magic and is mean to him. They kept him a cupboard for eleven years.” Draco told her with a nod. Nymphadora gave a low hum before her hair turned bright pink with interest. “How do you think he’d react if I showed him my pig nose?” She asked.
“Hey… are you awake?” Harry’s whisper sounded from across the hospital wing. Draco watched as the younger version of himself hid a smile into his pillow.
It had to be strange… to go from living in a world where nobody really cared much about the stupid things you did only for some random adults to pop up and start scolding you. Draco didn’t blame Harry for being annoyed. He got rewarded for breaking rules often enough - and now his godfather was upset he went for a walk with someone? After he literally tried to track down a serial killer and used a time turner last year?
"Are you here to kill Voldemort?" Someone asked. Draco fought - very hard - not to roll his eyes. Obviously. What the Hell else would he be here to do? Kill Father Christmas? Harry nodded and the whispers rose. Before he could give a vocal response, someone had stepped forward and placed their wand at his feet. Draco's eyes widened. A few people murmured. Harry, of course, looked confused.
“Did your map tell you I’d be here?” He muttered and Harry flinched as he drifted over a bit closer to the window Draco was sat by. “If Severus kept it I won’t help you get it back.” He added and Harry bit his lip.
"My mom says she likes you."
“Or you’re going to what?” Draco said, turning back around and flicking out one of his knives. The tip glimmered for a moment before turning silver. Fenrir snarled. “Or you’re going to
He was briefly reminded of Hermione's askance about starting the DA after learning Sirius was for it. Normally, he might point out that Sirius didn't often
“He killed Amelia Bones!” Bellatrix snapped and the name sent a shiver down his spine. “He was raised to be docile, you idiot. Give him a moment.” She seethed and squeezed Draco’s arm tighter. “He can do it. Right, Draco?” She asked.
“No need to be rude because she’s better than you,” he snipped and marched past them (making sure to shove Potter as he did) after Hermione.
"Well," Draco said, pouring himself a glass of juice, "You
"I would
“I didn’t mean it like that, Draco.” He said softly, “I’m a mess too-”
“He - don’t
“I’ve let everyone I ever loved down,” Sirius told him before Draco could retract the question, “If I had been more Gryffindor then maybe I wouldn’t have switched places with Peter and James and Lily would still be alive. If I had been a bit more involved in my family then maybe my little brother wouldn’t have died serving Voldemort. I got myself locked up so that Remus had to deal with this world alone and with the hatred of ignorant witches and wizards. Harry was left to grow up with muggles and not a single memory of his parents,” he said and shook his head, “If you need advice on that front… perhaps do the opposite of what I say.” He said mirthlessly.
He should probably find Theo. It was dangerous for him to be seen here. Death Eaters might come for him. Hell, Theo might turn him over in a fit of rage. It was a serious problem, quite frankly.
Draco shot up in bed. He was drenched in sweat, shaking. Wildly, he reached for the watch around his neck only to notice he wasn’t alone. Frowning, he looked down to see his bed had magically expanded to accommodate a small group.
"He'll also need a middle name..." He said, turning to Sirius who frowned.
"Oh? The muggleborn? We'll find him again soon enough," Voldemort said and Draco shook his head. It was at that moment that Rowle started coughing. Draco glanced over at him before turning to back to Voldemort. Donovan joined him seconds later, clutching as his throat as he fell against the wall. Bellatrix stiffened for a moment before turning to look at where Narcissa stood calmly, watching with an eerily blank look.
“Hello,” Fleur said pleasantly with her hands folded politely in front of her. Draco paused. Oh. This was embarrassing. He internally winced as he registered the fact he was rolling around on the ground like a toddler while the person who was
“You dueled Voldemort?”
“If you think it’s going to be funny to say you’re an animagus I will be

agree to be his friend during their first year of Hogwarts and Draco was many things, but he did pride himself to sticking to his word… most of the time.
“I thought we were doing homework,” he said and shrugged, “That’s what I’ve been doing at least. To be fair, I don’t really listen to you all that often,” he admitted and went back to his food. “Anyway, Flamel is the alchemist who made the sorcerer’s stone. Why do you care about that?”
"What," he asked darkly, "Are you doing here?" He whispered. Theo raised an eyebrow at him. Harry could see two figures behind also trying to peer into the room.
What he
“Practice?”
“I think I’m going to pay a visit to some muggles,” he said and Bellatrix lifted a brow, “They’re moving Potter today.” He added. Bellatrix brightened.
be in.
and to be fair, he only kissed three people so Draco wouldn’t have expected him to be that great, but it was just annoying that his world could be so shattered by someone who barely knew what they were doing.
“She’s a monster,” Draco decided and watched as Harry blinked a few times before giving a questioning hum, “Forget banning love potions from school, that shit should be illegal.” He said and winced when his quill snapped in half.
"Hey," Harry said, unwittingly cutting off what would have been a very loud argument. "Hello, Mrs. Malfoy," he added quickly when he noticed Narcissa by Draco's side. "I need to thank you for not giving me away in the forest. I thought for a moment..." He trailed off. Draco watched warily as his mother's eyes trailed over him curiously before looking at Draco.
“I found out my mother was the one who disowned me,” Draco shrugged as he sniffed slightly, “And Jafar isn’t getting credit for all his hard work because of Aladdin.” He explained. Hermione closed her eyes and leaned against his shoulder.
What? What things? Was he -
“…Maybe a six?” He responded lightly. “No, a seven. Definitely a seven…And a half.” He said, winking at Draco. Ron was gaping – words spluttering incoherently until Hermione sighed and closed her book, tucking into her bag.
“As for you three,” Dumbledore continued as the Weasleys took their daughter outside, “I believe we must discuss your actions.”
Well... it looked like they were getting a personal escort into the manor after all.
“Yeah. My mistake.” He said and went back to the peppermint. Harry stared at him for a couple of seconds and slowly went back to the moonstone. There was a moment where his eyes flicked to the completed potion of amortentia towards the front of the classroom. Draco had all but been holding his breath in an attempt to keep from smelling it. He tried subtly breathing through his mouth instead, but occasional wafts still came by (mainly thanks to his animagus’ stellar sense of smell).
‘Do you need to…’ Harry broke eye contact and Draco’s mouth was suddenly dry as he followed Harry’s switching gaze to the pensieve. Now he was faced with a potential answer, he was terrified of it. What if this was the answer and it still didn’t make a difference? What if unblocking his memory didn’t restore his magic but let the darkness take over? He nearly dropped the vial as the fiery itch of his magic set his dark mark alight.
“I thought about that.” She took two slips of paper out of her pocket and handed them to Draco. They were two Ministry ID slips belonging to Jo March and Atticus Finch.
So that was how Harry ended up sitting upstairs in Luna’s house, in the guest bedroom which had become Malfoy’s, watching her write out a letter to a certain Remus Lupin. It was a relatively plain room with pale grey walls and blue bedding, but there were dreamcatchers hung up at the windows in a myriad of colours and there were piles of paperback books overflowing the shelves. Most of them looked read, but some were clearly brand new and stacked neatly in the corner. All muggle. Malfoy sat at a small desk with a sheet of writing paper and a fountain pen filled with dark blue ink. It took a good five minutes for Harry to get his brain wrapped around the concept of a Malfoy using a pen over a quill.
“Yes, it will. If you want to do something for someone else for once in your life, you can start by not being a judgemental prick.” She was so taken aback by the force with which he spoke that she almost dropped her guitar on the floor. Luckily, he caught it by its neck with his seeker’s reflexes, dropping his coat that he had picked up when he had been preparing to leave.
‘We made mistakes Harry. We were young and stupid and we both thought we knew best.’ Draco was done blaming either one of them for what went wrong, he was finally ready to move on with his life.
Inside was a collection of old brooms. His father had never had much of a knack for quidditch, so all Draco knew had been taught by his mother. He hadn’t realised her brooms had been left out here to the elements and he could see many of the twigs had snapped and a couple of the handles and thawed and split. His own broom, however, being the youngest, looked in serviceable condition.
‘I love you Draco.’
She feigned offence. “Well, you might as well be. Please?”
“Muggle? You want me to break into the Ministry for Magic while Polyjuiced as a
‘I needed some time to myself.’ Harry sat down on the grass next to him and slung an arm over his shoulders. He wanted to push him away, he burned with the desire to get as far away as possible, but he also knew he shouldn’t have been sat outside in the cold for so long, and he probably needed Harry’s body heat – and his warming charms.
‘When I’m not having a nightmare, you mean.’ He shuddered as the image of Smith’s face flashed in his mind. Harry intertwined their fingers and pulled Draco’s hand to his chest.
‘Um. Well it was installed in the mid-13
‘The rest of the day is ours, what do you say we do?’ Draco considered it for a moment until he had a brainwave.
‘What was the big emergency?’ He asked, pushing aside the voices in his head telling him to scream accusations until his throat was raw and his voice hoarse.
The pitch black was disorientating and Draco tumbled to the floor. They hadn't even bothered to untie his hands. He lay there spread-eagled for an unknown length of time before he figured out how to haul himself up with his hands numb and tied behind his back. He tried to them free, but the ties cut into his wrists further and rubbed his skin raw. There was nothing he could do but manoeuvre himself onto the rickety metal bed with the thin mattress. It was difficult not to be dismayed at the state of the cell, with its peeling walls and smell of damp, but he knew it was a lot better than Azkaban would be if he ended up there. He had escaped doing time in the wizard prison thus far, however he was skating on alarmingly thin ice.
“I don’t know where he is.” It wasn’t exactly a lie. He didn’t have a clue what was beyond the Veil or if Potter had even got that far at all.
In his heart he knew the responsible thing would be to turn the fox over to the Ministry. It was impossible for him to know where it came from or what it was capable of, and he certainly didn’t have the skill to look after it.
The wards embedded in the door clicked open beneath his palm like a key turning in a lock. The door creaked open slowly and sunlight streamed through into the hallway. The magically sealed room inside was any historian’s treasure trove. It was this library which held the oldest and rarest of the Malfoy volumes. It was carefully preserved with charms and wards to protect the most fragile of pages. The magic itself was so strong that even natural sunlight couldn’t penetrate the protections. From as early as Draco could remember his father had begun teaching him the conservation charms, although it was a while before he had the competency to try for himself. Now it was Draco’s sole responsibility to look after these books and manuscripts, some of which contained magic so rare that these tomes were the only written proof of its existence.
‘Excuse me a minute.’ He excused himself from Ron and said polite hellos to the gaggle on Weasleys who’d just arrived as he escaped to the kitchen. He could feel his hands shaking and he didn’t want to spoil anyone’s fun so early in the day.
‘Well-’ he was interrupted by a pop.
‘You really love it here, don’t you?’ Draco turned to see Harry with a gut-wrenching sadness etched across his features. Draco stood before him and smoothed out the worry lines with the pads of his thumbs.
“How did we win the war? Tell me like I don’t already know.” But he didn’t get to hear her answer because the tide came in and pulled him away.
‘You alright, mate?’ Ron asked him as he took Hugo from him. His arm felt cold where he’d been, even through his winter coat.
‘Fine. But I will make it up to you another time.’ Daphne sighed in annoyance.
Hey, at least he knew that about himself.
‘Oh. Er, not exactly. You’ve been sleeping a lot and one morning I was talking to Spungen and he told me about it. He said he could make pastries just fine, but you always preferred them when he was sent them from this bakery. I know it’s not your favourite, but well, I may have made a deal with the owner…’ How long had Spungen been giving him these pastries? That sneaky devil!
“Stay for dinner and forget about the fox for a while. Tell me about what else is going on in your life. I hear you’re spending more time with Luna and Lyra?”
‘Would you pass me the pile of mail, love? I forgot to open it this morning.’ Draco levitated the small stack of letters over as he was waiting for the milk to heat. They exchanged huge grins at Draco’s easy display of magic. He knew, despite having lost his magic for less than a year of his life, that he would never take it for granted again. The letters landed neatly on the table in front of Harry, who scanned the envelopes. He always tried to guess which letter would be the most important and opened it first. Most of the time he was hopelessly wrong, but it made Draco laugh anyway.
‘Uh, alright then. I’ll, uh, see you at home.’ Draco winced as Harry fumbled over his words. He used to berate him for doing that, way back before they’d realised they didn’t hate each other. He’d come to learn that he only did it when he was upset or nervous.
Even now the accuracy stung.
‘I think maybe I should apparate you the rest of the way. Will the wards let me?’ Draco nodded, feeling lightheaded. There was a pop and they reappeared on the steps outside the main doors. Draco prayed Spungen would notice a shift in the wards – although he had also sent word ahead to warn him of their arrival. A few seconds later and the large oak doors swung open, revealing a far sprightlier elf than Draco had left behind.
Harry can see why Malfoy wouldn’t trust him with these in the slightest.
Happy Belated Christmas!
‘I should stay with Dad when he gets angry, he- he needs someone around.’ Draco frowned at him. He didn’t like the sound of that. What exactly had he been exposed to in the past few years? Draco had assumed the majority of Harry’s anger had been directed at him…
‘I can’t very well say I’ll forgive you and then rub it in your face every chance I get, can I? It’s not right and it’s not proper.’ There was a finality in Draco’s tone that stopped Harry questioning him. He went back to his pancake batter which by now was probably completely useless.
‘Aunt Hermioneeeee, how’s Hugo?’ Teddy interrupted. Teddy adored Hugo, much to Rose’s annoyance. Draco tried to explain that Teddy couldn’t pick favourites amongst his cousins, but Teddy had simply said “love and like are two very different things”. Whilst that was certainly true, Draco wasn’t sure that was the best attitude to take.
“It’s all circumstantial right now,” she began. “There’s no evidence from your meeting with Harry that you had any intention to harm him, which is good, but-” Of course there had to be a but. “It is suspicious that you happened to see him. It could easily be construed as a planned event, like you wanted to be seen getting along with him to divert attention, why would you suddenly want to see him anyway? And right before he…left.”
He missed dessert, although there was plenty left over, and he also missed gift exchanging. Later on, Harry passed him a beautifully wrapped Weasley jumper with the initials DP knitted into it to signify Draco’s return. He promised he’d send a thank you owl the next day.
Harry laughed. ‘He was the brightest of all of them.’
They sat in silence for a long time. Draco stared at the clock on the wall opposite. Five minutes. Ten. Fifteen. Twenty.
Only he could’ve managed to sleep through the new year. He woke up feeling sore although he couldn’t think what he’d been doing. He didn’t remember going to bed actually. He glanced at the clock next to him – how had he slept until two in the afternoon? And since when was it the 2
‘Look, I know you hate those appointments, but do you have to take it out on me? I’m just concerned.’ Draco looked up from his journal and immediately felt guilty when he saw the lost expression on his face.
“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” Pansy grinned at Granger in a maniacal way that had Granger looking at Draco with a worried expression.
‘Gabriel said we’re welcome any time. I think he has a bit of a thing for you.’ Draco wanted to roll his eyes at Harry’s obvious jealousy, but it was too sweet. He laughed when Harry took a bite of St. Honoré cake and ended up with choux pastry stuck to the side of his mouth with a little bit of cream.
He could see Blaise, even now. As if he was in the dingy cell next to him, lounging languidly on one of the common room’s black settees, the green flames casting sinister shadows over his sharp bone structure even as he smiled at Draco teasingly.
‘Ted, would you mind getting dressed? I need to talk to your aunt for a bit.’ Draco shot Teddy a pointed look. Teddy wandered off to the spare room he usually stayed in where he had a few clothes.
‘I’ll do this, you’ve had a long day already,’ he said softly. Draco wasn’t sure since Harry wasn’t exactly the most eloquent person he knew, but Teddy listened to him, trusted him more than anyone.
Draco had been agonising over it for months, losing sleep and being snappy with the few visitors he had. He was in the midst of another battle of his internal war when his oldest and dearest friend interrupted him at the breakfast table.
A lock of hair falls into Malfoy’s eyes. His plait has slowly been unravelling as the afternoon wore on. It takes serious effort not to tuck it behind his ear for him, but he finds it equally fascinating to watch Malfoy do it himself. He hasn't even been looking up from his work to speak to Harry, but he doesn't mind at all.
Whilst the trip was supposed to be an important chance for them to talk, Draco had hoped that it would be an opportunity for Draco to show Harry the more elegant and respectable side of his heritage – expose him to some French culture.
‘Of course I have Pansy, you utter tit.’ He said angrily. There had been a string of one-night stands in the earliest months of his divorce which he’d somehow managed to hide from everyone he knew. It had been fun at first, lowering his inhibitions and forgetting about everything for a while. The company staved of the loneliness and helped him relieve tension. After a while though, he woke up feeling even emptier than he had before. He never brought anyone to his own flat; it was much easier to sneak out of someone else’s bed in the early hours of the morning.
He felt like he’d only been asleep for a few minutes when the floo flared and through his blurry vision he could make out messy dark hair and round glasses.
“Less inclined by the minute.” Her elbows remained on the table and she propped her chin up with her hands. It was a surprisingly informal posture. “There’s nothing formal about this chat, Draco. Just tell me what you know, and we’ll go from there.” Draco’s irritation flared.
They sat down on the sofa together and Teddy all but crawled into Draco’s lap like he had when he was little. Except now he wasn’t shoving his stuffed pigmy puffs in Draco’s face.
‘Why Catherine?’ Draco smiled at Harrys sudden eagerness.
‘What the fuck, Draco? Why are you being like this, it’s my right to know what’s going on as your boss and your friend.’
‘We’ve known each other eighteen.’ Draco pointed out. Harry sighed.
So many ifs. What was he really waiting for? What if those things never happened at all?
He held his breath as he passed through the Manor wards. Even with all the precautions he had made, he still expected blaring alarms and restraints to shoot out at him when he tried to leave. When nothing happened, he still couldn’t totally relax, still half expecting a delayed reaction. Perhaps he should have had more faith in his magical ability.
‘Dad?’ Potter’s stony gaze softened the minute he saw Teddy in a state. He came rushing over and for a brief minute, it was like nothing had changed.
‘Ok, but wouldn’t we have noticed valerian in their systems? It’s a common ingredient in potions and healing.’
‘Stop thinking so hard,’ Harry said with a small nudge. His hand felt hot against Draco’s hip and it was the sort of comfort he hadn’t even known he needed. ‘Sleep, you’ll feel better.’ It was nearly impossible to fight the tiredness and Draco’s eyes fell closed.
‘I have a lot to do today. I thought seeing the children might give me a bit of encouragement,’ he told her. If she wanted to know what he was up to, she didn’t ask.
‘Well, some of them are a little complicated to explain, but you see this?’ He pointed to a Japanese holly. ‘These are very special.’ Teddy was hooked, his face bent towards Draco’s as if he was about to impart the secrets of the universe. ‘Your dad’s wand is made of holly, but this type is very special. You know why?’ Teddy shook his head, his mouth opening slightly as he waited for Draco to tell him. ‘We used to put it on Professor Trelawney’s floor cushions to see how high she’d jump.’ Teddy blinked at him.
‘I don’t think anything,’ he said abruptly. ‘Now, if you don’t mind, I need to find some childcare.’ With that, Draco strode swiftly out of the room, leaving Harry standing there with his mouth working like a fish. Draco knew he wasn’t justified in being so angry, but he couldn’t help himself. The sooner he got away from the stupid idiot the better.
‘Of course.’ She led him back through to his office and he was careful to close the door.
“Lord Malfoy.” Knock-Off Crabbe grunted. “Requested by Head Auror Robards.” Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. To have a warrant out for his arrest authorised by the Head Auror himself was not to be taken lightly. Of course, no one wanted to be the face of the DMLE when that meant taking responsibility for a missing Harry Potter, so Draco presumed the Head Auror was taking a hands-on role. That didn’t bode well.
‘It’s a really good thing you’re doing here, you know? You’ll actually make a difference. A much greater and better difference than you would running around for the Ministry. I say it a lot to Teddy, but I’m proud of you too. And please don’t be annoyed at me for saying it, because I mean it with love, but it’s really helping with your anger too.’ Harry didn’t like to talk about the anger, Draco supposed it made him feel a bit of a failure, but he couldn’t be perfect
‘Oh, Draco my love, it’s so good to see you!’ She said as she squished him into her amble bosom.
‘Yes, you git! Now get up!’ Harry stood up, his terror slowly melting into relief as he slipped the ring he’d given Draco months ago back onto his finger. When their lips met in a kiss that made Draco feel like his veins had flooded with molten lava, he thought he might just be the luckiest man on earth.
‘Are you going to tell me where we’re going?’ He asked Harry when he made it back downstairs, adjusting his cufflinks impatiently. Without saying a word Harry cast a styling charm at Draco and he watched as his hair fell into place from the slight mess it had become in the wind earlier.
“You don’t know that,” her voice was barely above a whisper, “where does it leave me?”
‘Come here.’ Draco made actual grabby hands at his soon-to-be-maybe-not-ex-husband, since he hadn’t regained the use of his limbs properly yet. Somehow, knowing Harry was here for him, the idea that he might live his life without his magic didn’t seem as scary as he thought it might be.
“I’m taking you to meet a very special friend today,” Harry said to Aspen. He had developed a habit of talking to the fox like a human. Malfoy mocked him for it, especially since Luna claimed he was a non-magical fox, but Harry still firmly believed he understood everything Harry said.
‘What?’ Harry gripped Teddy’s shoulders and steered him away from the Christmas tree, sitting him down on the sofa. ‘Dad? What’s going on?’ He was starting to look worried, so Draco opened his mouth to answer him. Harry held up a hand to stop Draco.
He was finding it difficult to regret it. He knew it made him sound like a lovesick teenager, but he’d missed Harry. He still missed Harry. He was starting to wonder whether moving to Paris was a coward’s way out. Even so, just because they’d kissed a couple of times, it didn’t mean they were going to try anything. Surely once you’ve been married, been so close to someone, it’s only natural that you’d still feel a connection with them? He couldn’t be the only divorcee who’d ever felt this way, and hadn’t his attacks been better since the divorce? He didn’t know. He could think himself around in circles.
‘He what?’
Spending the day with Harry meant he hadn’t gone back to the orphanage to see Ella after school. He knew it wasn’t a big deal, but it would be to a child. Ella needed stability, not Draco letting her down.
‘I’ll be back soon.’ Teddy offered in consolation, clearly reading the look on Draco’s face.
‘Not always, you’re not so bad sometimes.’
work for them
It had looked like blood to begin with. A deep bluish purple which looked like a bruise. He’d taken a blood replenishing potion and that had been that. Now though, it was inky black, as deep as his dark mark had been during the war. It reached his shoulder now – a heavy weight pressing down on his chest and forcing the air out of his lungs. It felt a lot like it had when he’d first had that vision of his father, when what he now knew was poison had flooded his veins. He choked and spluttered trying to get air into his body. He supposed it was stupid to have tried to perform magic in the middle of the night having not warned Harry at all. But then, it had never quite done this before.
‘I took it. From your flat. That day you weren’t well.’ Harry said nonchalantly as if it didn’t matter at all.
‘Ok. See you soon! Love you!’ She walked down the corridor to where the matron smiled and wave. He supposed she’d probably missed her meal time. He froze for a second when she said she loved him – he’d never meant for that to happen. He probably was getting a little too close. Maybe he should cut back on the time he spent there.
‘Ok,’ he said eventually, a smile cracking across his face. Draco couldn’t help himself, not that he needed to. He pulled Harry forward and kissed him gently. He’d been making a more concerted effort to show Harry how much he loved him, knowing he often forgot to. Harry was the kind of person who would never ask.
There were potted plants perched precariously on the top of bookshelves full of brightly coloured spines, their leaves trailing across the shelves like climbing frames. There were large, spiky plants in huge ceramic vases on the floor sticking out in all directions. Under the windows there were boxes of herbs and on the side tables there were vases of freshly cut flowers from the garden. Combined with a mishmash of patterned throws and cushions and the vague smell of vanilla, it felt more like home than Harry’s flat ever had.
“Wait a second,” he interrupts, “you said when considering the nature of a counter-curse. There isn’t one here?” He feels like his lungs deflate of their own accord.
‘It was Harry. Ron saw you leaving Gringotts on his way to the shop in the morning and because you looked like you were raising the fires of hell – Ronald’s words, not mine – he asked Harry if he knew anything about it. Of course, Harry didn’t know a thing. So, he pulled strings in the DMLE and had you investigated. He basically bullied the goblins into overturning the decision. I know you’ll be angry Draco, but I just wanted you to know. He’s not angry that you left, he’s angry that you didn’t tell him you wanted go to.’
Just as he returned the ground floor and turned towards the West Wing, Granger appeared wearing nothing but a huge quidditch jersey that fell nearly to her knees. It took him a minute to realise it was Potter’s old house jersey. He could hardly see her in the darkness, but he could just make out that she was barefoot, and her hair was loosely thrown up in a tangle of curls and frizz. It looked as if she had already gone to bed and then thought better of it.
Draco took a seat opposite Granger’s whilst Pansy sat next to her. There was already a tea service set out on the low table between them – Pansy must have ordered it before she came to get him. That or Granger was far too familiar in the Manor, and that didn’t seem likely. He did the honours.
‘It takes ages to go through the vetting process, maybe by then your magic will be better anyway. That reminds me, I’ve been meaning to ask you about that. What happened to your wand? I haven’t seen it anywhere near you recently, and the last time you cast you borrowed mine…’ Draco looked at him bewildered.
‘It’s fine,’ Draco said coldly. He was only here because he’d tried skipping his mind healer session before and Harry had thrown a hissy fit when an owl had arrived to complain about Draco wasting appointments.
“I don’t know. Luna told me he isn’t a magic fox, but I just don’t believe her. You know when you just have this
‘You two are so mean to me.’ Draco said like he hadn’t plagued Harry’s existence for the first eight years they’d known each other.
‘Where did you get this.’ Draco asked him lowly.
“Please? You don’t even need to help really; you could just leave me in there. I won’t touch anything but the books I promise. But since your father helped the Ministry a lot back in the day, it knows the library quite well…” Malfoy tenses at the mention of his father and Harry thinks he might well have just ruined his only chance at getting a look at the Malfoy tomes.
‘I haven’t done anything, don’t panic. There's something I want to show you. Would you come to the flat with me?’ He held out a hand to Harry, who took it and carefully extracted himself from the pile of photos surrounding him.  They took the floo to Draco’s apartment which was cold, and dark, and smelled like stale air since no one had been in a while. Harry turned the lights on and was surprised to see the piled of papers lying around everywhere. Draco walked over to the typewriter he’d purchased months ago with a little help from Hermione. Next to it was a large pile of pages loosely clipped together. He handed them to Harry.
“Funny kind of friends,” Harry said when he finally found his voice again. He was surprised when Draco pressed another quick kiss to Harry’s lips and climbed off him to settle back against his chest like before.
He took a seat between Millicent, who had brought her cat with her for who knew what reason, and Pansy, who was looking at him like he was a terminal dragon pox patient.
‘Ted?’ He shouted up the stairs when he arrived home. He didn’t have to energy to go up to check on him.
‘I-I- thank you,’ he stammered. Mentally cursing himself for being so inept. Harry looked at him in utter bewilderment before the penny dropped.
‘Right.’ Draco had no idea what to say. Harry had gone behind his back yet again. Maybe, if Harry had just asked Draco, he’d have told him. Then again, Draco had never given him much reason to believe he would tell the truth. He’d made such a mess. Still, he thought they’d turned a corner after their last meeting and he’d hoped Harry would have learned from his mistakes by now. Apparently not.
The Hit Wizards resumed their painful grip on him and led him down a narrow corridor painted a sickly shade of yellow with very narrow doors either side and no windows. Not even the fake charmed ones that were all over the other departments of the Ministry. They turned left, then right, then left again until the rabbit warren opened out into a wide corridor with a polished floor and wide metal doors. He was quite literally thrown into the nearest one, a blanket and a pillow thrown in behind him, and the door was slammed shut, leaving him in darkness.
No. He realised that would be a stupid idea. He hadn’t had a dose since before he went out the night before and he’d never make it through a conversation like that without one. He couldn’t quite bring himself to move though. He used to love watching Harry sleep, like he sometimes watched Teddy now. Harry was a strong and independent person when he was awake, but when he slept there was a kind of vulnerability about him that reminded Draco that Harry wasn’t a perfect hero, he was just a man like Draco.
‘Everything said in this room stays inside this room, Draco. I wouldn’t ever repeat anything you tell me, and even if I did, I’d have my license revoked and my wand snapped no questions asked.’ That didn’t make Draco feel any better.
‘You’re killing me.’ He adjusted his grip on Draco and his hand came in contact with the letter. ‘What’s this?’ Draco had completely forgotten about it.
His mind healer had recommended he write a journal. He said it would help Draco “process the changes in his life” and give himself some” perspective on the events which led him here”. Draco understood the theory, it was just that he felt a bit of a wally writing in a journal, even though Harry had bought him a beautiful dark leather book with the crispest white pages. He’d even invested in a muggle fountain pen and Draco had to admit it made quills look quite antiquated.
“We’re talking over three hundred years ago; you can’t possibly know everything he did. Besides, you’re the best hope I have.” She paused to consider whether she should continue. “I wondered if you’d ever heard of the
‘There’s just a blank piece of paper?’ Draco looked at the familiar Marauder’s Map and remembered the time not long after the war when Harry had told him about it. He’d been fuming – he’d had an advantage over him all that time? No wonder he’d stalked him so successfully in sixth year.
‘His is ours.’ He said coldly. His hand tightening against the leather binding.
‘Look at me.’ Draco’s lifted his gaze. He wished he knew how Harry’s eyes could always burn with intensity. It was like nothing else he’d ever seen. ‘I’ve known you had that mark. I saw it myself. Every one of our friends knows you took the mark and we all care about you anyway. It might go away again, we don’t know. What we do know is that you’re a good person with or without it. Ok?’ He removed his hand and with it the last of the bandage slipped. He’d known what it would look like, but it still took the breath from his lungs to see the ugly black snake coiled on his inner arm once again. It was unmoving, thankfully, but it also had the inky vein markings around it that had appeared on his chest.
“Unless- unless of course you might like to stay for dinner?” Malfoy doesn’t seem able to meet Harry’s eye as he asks, and Harry sort of finds it adorable that the man who not five minutes ago was a pillar of authority as he discussed Latin grammar, is now reduced to a bashful schoolboy.
“I want to get in touch with Remus. Professor Lupin, that is. I think it’s time he and Sirius… I don’t know, got a few things straight with each other? They were friends, before we were born. When Sirius was sent to Azkaban…well, I guess Remus believed what everyone else did.”
‘Finding the cause has proven much harder. It seems your magic had been with you since about a month after you were last admitted, however there appears to be significant mental scarring preventing you from using it. So, when you tried to cast the spell which brought you here, the lingering dark magic in your arm tried to fight it. We can’t figure out why the dark magic seems to be connected to your mental state, but it seems you’ll be spending a lot of time with your mind healer in the future.’ Draco groaned. He hated that twat with a passion.
“Alright, alright! If you would just stop squirming, I could get you out!” Harry said to the moving crumple of stiff curtain. The screaming only got louder, and Harry wished he had brought his wand with him, even though taking his wand to the bathroom wasn’t exactly something he was in the habit of doing.
He had been resigned back at the Manor, but it really hit him as he was dragged into the heart of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement that there would be no one to come for him; to pay his bail or to explain their way out of it. If he was lucky, Pansy would get him a decent lawyer, but most of the good ones wouldn’t work with the likes of him.
‘You silly sausage,’ Draco said with fond exasperation as he looked around for a cloth to wipe Johnny clean with. ‘Thanks,’ he said when Susan beat him to it.
‘Hermione, what do you want me to say? It’s been three years and I’m not any better than I was. I need to get out of here, I need to not see him around every week, I need space to figure out who I am without him.’ He knew it was cowardly. A better man than him would just come right out and say that he was still in love with Harry Potter and seeing his face made him want to tear his hair out and cry.
‘Teddy, listen to me.’ Harry said gently. Teddy finally eased his vice-like grip on Draco. ‘I’m not going anywhere ok. Nothing will take me away from you. You’ll go to school and I’ll go to work, and when you come back to see me at Christmas it’ll be like I never went anywhere, yeah?’ Draco had to appreciate that there was always something calming about Harry’s presence. At first, Draco had wondered if it was a side effect of Harry’s magic, but eventually he came to realise it was just Harry.
As if in a blur there were forms signed and dates stamped. All the while Ponytail stood next to Draco, keeping a tight grip on his upper arm as if it was necessary to hold him in place when he was about to walk right out of there. He could hardly believe it. It seemed so surreal after two days of solitary confinement and no daylight, so he kept his mouth tightly shut until he was certain it was safe to speak.
Harry gripped the doorframe as the world shifted sideways. How could these two people have the same face? Was he imagining things? Who was that man in his dreams and what did he want with Harry?
The real world was a nasty shock to Draco’s system. The smell of the hospital hit him first, although he daren’t open his eyes. He’d spent enough time in St Mungo’s over the years to know when he was in hospital. Harry had been there so often he even had his own bed. Funny that the tables had turned again. He had an odd kind of feeling that was like he was running through water – he assumed that must be potions in his bloodstream. Why did he always have to be on potions? He lay there for a long while, waiting for the feeling to return to his body.
‘I’ve been awake ages, Harry. You’re the one who’s late to the party. I feel like I’ve been trampled on by a heard of Hippogriffs and fed to the Giant Squid, but I think I’ll survive.’ It was lame humour, but Draco didn’t want to admit how terrible he really felt.
“The werewolf replied to our letter.” He winced and he wasn’t sure if it was because she referred to Remus as the werewolf again, or if it was because being this close to her made him dizzy again.
‘Maybe another time, yeah?’ He said gently and as Draco drifted back off to sleep, he could’ve sworn he felt Harry press a kiss to his forehead.
Wait a second, that wasn’t even his clock.
‘You never lost me, Harry. There’s no point dragging it all out again, but I want you to know that even if I pretended like I hated you for a long time, I never stopped loving you.’ Draco could feel hot tears pricking in his own eyes and he willed them away. Now wasn’t the time to cry for what was lost, it was a time to hold on to what was left.
‘He said he wanted me around, get to grips with everything he does, learn protocols, meet dignitaries, etcetera…’
“A visitor? Is that- is that a fox? Blimey.”
“What? And having two massive black things swiping across my field of vision every few seconds is better?!”
“I- uh, well, it must have been-” the tips of Ron’s ears were vermillion, a total contrast to the greyish tinge on his cheeks. Harry turned to Sirius and Remus who both looked worried.
When he’d renovated the chateau last year, he’d had Blaise help him install a wardrobe of French fashion so that he didn’t always have to bring a ton of luggage with him. Most of what he’d brought this time had been Harry’s. He pulled out the warmest cashmere he could find. He chucked a few items Harry’s way since his nap had likely interrupted Spungen’s unpacking. He’d taken the liberty of buying a few things in Harry’s size – just in case.
It was instinctual to glance down at her left arm. He remembered when he had caught her in Luna’s conservatory. When the light had hit her just so and the music changed the way she held herself, he remembered thinking how strange it was that he associated her with ignorance, intolerance, and Death Eaters. Death Eaters who had the dark mark on their arms. Before he could think too much about it, he took her left hand and pulled her arm towards him. She was wearing long sleeves again and now that he thought about it, he had never seen her with her arms exposed.
‘That’s never happened before,’ he muttered. He bounced Hugo gently to calm him down, but it didn’t seem to make much difference. He’d been terrible with Teddy when he was a baby, he’d always been convinced he’d never like children, but he got used to it. With Rose, he was better, although he did accidently make her cry a couple of times. Hugo on the other hand, he’d been a natural with so far.
“Thank you.” He took a sip of the tea and sighed. “Yeah, I’d like to read it.” It occurred to him when she shivered that she was still cold and damp, so he waved a hand half absentmindedly to dry her off and warm her up. He jumped when she gasped.
Only when Draco was left alone in his cell did he allow himself to really take in what was happening. Panic washed over him like a tidal when he realised that there was no father to charge in and demand he be released and no mother waiting for him to come home. His throat clamped shut so painfully it made his eyes water and he gasped for breath. He thought about his father now, how he had been in a cell like this one and Draco had barely cared. Not the second time anyway. He remembered the summer after his fifth year when his father had been locked up after the fiasco in the Department of Mysteries. It had terrified Draco then to see a man he thought untouchable reduced to nothing but a skeleton in a small, windowless, hovel. If he had known…
On the other hand, if he stayed, there’s no way he could put their talk off any longer. That could be a good thing. He could get it all of his chest and then he’d be ready to move. He was still waiting to hear back from the jobs he’d applied for, but he was totally ready to go as soon as the case was closed.
little to the imagination – and smelled like heaven and Draco would be damned if he didn’t go home with this guy.
‘When you left- when I left- I don’t even know who left, the nightmares started coming back. There was nothing I could do and-and- and I had to sleep on my own.’ He was trembling again, and Harry guided him over to the ugly sofa.
‘I’m sorry, I really am. It’ll be good for her though, to have people who love her and can give her what she needs.’ Draco set the empty teacup on the table between them.
‘Minister.’ Draco greeted cordially, ignoring the elephant in the room.
“See, you knew exactly what I meant, so it is like that. Do you really think you’d be doing any of this if you didn’t? You saved his live once already, most people would think that was more than enough. And what am I supposed to do? Flit about worrying about the wording of Astoria’s engagement in the papers, start organising wedding venues and flower arrangements while the two of you… what? What even are you two doing? Because you haven’t told me a thing!” He had forgotten all about Astoria.
“Yes.”
‘I agree with the Minister, Draco. I need you out there.’ Harry said as he sent his memo to the department. Draco flushed at his choice of words.
‘I’ll leave you gentlemen to it then, shall I?’ Yes, Draco this guy might be a bit old, but he would definitely be Draco’s type if he wasn’t hopelessly in love with Harry Potter.
‘Love you, Draco.’ Teddy said. Draco’s chest swelled. Teddy didn’t say it very often, which only meant that it was so much more special when he did.
They strolled casually out of the main doors and Draco was glad of the fresh air. He wasn’t fond of the way private clinics always tried to make it look like it wasn’t a medical facility. There were far too many scatter cushions and ‘accent walls’. It wasn’t a magazine HQ for crying out loud. They were careful of passing muggles; many wizards had been caught short leaving magically hidden buildings, forgetting that muggles weren’t accustomed to seeing people randomly appear in the middle of the street.
“Good morning to you too, Parkinson.” She was in the habit of dropping in unannounced and Draco kept up the pretence that he hated it. That morning he didn't feel up to idle chit-chat though, so he picked up the morning's Prophet. As usual, Potter's face was splattered all over the front page.
‘I see.’ The anger drained out of Harry in an instant and his expression was so wounded that Draco wished he could just evaporate on the spot. ‘This isn’t over.’ Harry said as he turned on his heels and stormed out.
October 1999
‘She must be locked in her room or something.’ Harry mused. There was a crowd of people outside a particular door, each cooing pitifully against the wood as if coaxing out a spooked horse. He could see Susan and Helen among them, although Helen seemed far less concerned and far more annoyed than the others.
‘Really Granger? You’re going to complain about your relationship with Potter to me?’ Hermione looked at him sheepishly.
‘I’ve got this Harry.’ Kingsley rested his elbows on his desk and paused as though choosing his words carefully. ‘We’ve been keeping tabs on anyone with connections to the Death Eaters. In recent months, Albert Runcorn has been spotted numerous times with Mafalda Hopkirk.’ Draco’s brows furrowed.
He trudged his way to Gringotts anyway. His father told him that the only things goblins hate more than wizards, it’s fear. As he reached the doors of the lopsided old building, he paused, straightened his spine, held his head high, and stepped inside.
‘Speaking of, is Teddy coming to see you. You know, after everything?’ Draco shook his head.
Harry began peeling off his clothes when a sniffle made him freeze. Casting a wandless lumos because he was too lazy to turn on the lights, Harry realised why the bedsheets weren’t made when he came up. There was a body, curled tightly into the foetal position, buried in the bed and shaking uncontrollably. Harry’s heart dropped.
He was dizzy when he stepped out the other side of the floo, but he’d expected that. He took a deep breath and gave himself a minute to re-orientate himself. He hated coming to the Ministry. Ironic since he’d spent years coming for lunch dates with Hermione and of course he’d worked here before the…incident. Still, it wasn’t one of his favourite places in the world. He made his way to the lifts and up to Hermione’s office.
‘Harry, look, there’s a lot I need to tell you and it’s been a long time coming. I just don’t think I can do this today. With Ted going away and the fight we had and everything else I’ve got going on, it’s just too much right now. If you can just stop hating me long enough to let me get used to Teddy going, I promise I’ll tell you everything.’ He was rambling terribly, but he was finally done keeping secrets and finally done lying and Harry really did deserve to know the truth about it all, from beginning to end.
“I’m uh- I’m not sure that’s a good idea right now.” He glanced at the clock on the wall, “it’s half past four in the morning.”
‘I appreciate that.’ Draco knew when to pick his fights, and he certainly wouldn’t kick up a fuss when given support from the Minister for Magic on a silver platter.
‘Fanks you!’ Johnny said happily, his speech was, interesting, but highly amusing. He dug his plastic spoon in and promptly smushed the yoghurt all over his face.
‘Sorry to drop in unannounced. I was going to ask for your help with something, but I can see you’re busy, so I’ll come by another time.’ He didn’t want to be getting in the way of what looked like a very well-planned operation.

“how can I help you?” Harry spun around and came face to face with a very pale handsome man with dark hair wearing old styled robes and a cape “I am Sanguini, the owner of this establishment” The most notable features were the slightly pointy canines and red eyes … according to the book on magical creatures he read this man was a vampire …
“that’s all I ask. After all I don’t want something bad to happen and certain … marks discovered” Albus said faking his concern as he said a farewell and left.
I'm thinking)
Severus’s eyes narrowed at the three red heads in a silent warning to not say a word to anyone. When they nodded in agreement the potion master sighed “come Ms. Weasley, I’ll escort you to your dorm. Fred, George you both should go back to your dorms before curfew”
Harry pondered the passage in the book as he got up to tend to his potion. Once that was finished, cooled and bottled he cleaned the cauldron and made a set of nutrition potions. Poppy’s words came to mind and he drank a blood restorer as he kept working. As the potion brewed he moved all his finished potions into his new bottomless bag as well as most of the library books and put many empty vials in Snape’s bag with the replacement ingredients … all the vials look the same anyway so he didn’t worry about mixing old and new vials.
Sanguine smiled as he moved towards the worried potion master, “Calm down, love. This isn’t the first time people have tried something like this.” He said before kissing Severus who kissed back eagerly clearly more relieved than he calm mask revealed.
Gritmace ignored her in favor of looking at Cache, "I am Gritmace. Who are you?"
A flutter from his loving owl brought him back to his senses. With one more light spell he found each book and put them back in the bottomless bag with his wand. He placed the bag in the mattress and after making sure it was hidden he let Hedwig perch on his arm.
The Minister sighed, "Ms. Prewett, you are here by arrested for child abuse, conspiring to commit line theft and potioning a ministry agent-" Of course, Molly decided to struggle. She managed to get a nasty curse cast on Arthur before she was restrained by the aurors. After making sure Arthur was cared for, which was easy considering he was already in St, Mungo's, Cornelius turned back to a restrained Molly. "And I'll be adding assault to your list, which, thankfully, gives me jurisdiction instead of Gringotts. I need to charge someone today." He muttered jokingly.
Harry pulled out all the food he took. Most of which he did buy himself anyway so it was his. He put the spices, flour, sugar, oil, ect … in the upper lower cabinets with his pet bowls for Libra and Lyra. The candle was set on the counter and the cold things in the wizarding version of a frig … meaning a cabinet on the wall with cooling and preserving charms. Next he put his potion ingredients in the lower cabinets and the potions on the counter, which is when he took a second blood potion and nutrition potion. Then he pulled out his book to make the kitchen his potion lab, which wasn’t difficult and the stove had the same burners that his potions classroom at school has.
“Is it bad?” Armel asked, seemingly appearing out of nowhere he moved so fast.
“I found a place to stay and after sleeping on it I decided I will not go back to Hogwarts and I will make everyone think I disappeared into muggle world, but for now lets go get settled. My landlord said that I can floo straight to the room, but I need to be locked into the wards first” Harry said as the kneazles settled down to eat with him and Hedwig who has made a mess of Vernon’s chair.
"It's not calming down." Draco said as he watched the moonlight soaked potion remain very reactive.
“he betrayed my parents” Harry muttered as his eyes dimmed seemingly in deep thought before focusing back on the goblin “you don’t seem so sure” he commented.
The entire situation puzzled Severus so he went to get Julian’s soul orb and check the Gaunt Shack …
He looked down at Cache and it just so happens that at this angle he could see down the back of the apprentice healer’s shirt … the clothing wasn’t as baggy, but he cold still see scars very similar to the ones he spotted under Harry’s neckline at school…
Ginny bobbed her head eagerly ”it’d be nice to spend sometime with them”
Snape’s scent was on he potion master’s cauldron …
It was definitely more them and they learned a good deal about each other. Sadly they shared rather painful pasts. The abuse Severus made to endure as a child at the hands of his father was similar to the twins’ bloody childhood. Unlike Severus Silvia and Sophia didn’t have a muggle father.
“what in Merlin’s name is a screw?” Lucius asked looking just as confused as his wife.
It was amazing! Harry smiled as a few colorful birds he never saw before flew passed the roof of the building he was just in. He could just barely see three other blurry buildings up in the trees like this one and through his blurry vision he could see the rope bridges connecting them. It was so lovely and peaceful, but how did he get here?!
“Sirius Black” Sirius said in a daze.
However, it seems the castle had other plans. As the old wizard closed in on the fireplace it shivered. Dumbledore frozen startled by the motion, but then moved again. He was only inches away when the entire fireplace sank into the stone wall. The baffled headmaster looked at the wall, not sure what to make of it. A smug part of his mind immediately thought the castle was back to obeying him and he backed away. Once he did that, though, the fireplace melted back out of the wall.

To anyone else it would be considered nothing more than the insane ramblings of a spell damaged mind. No one would take that seriously. Harry was safely tucked away somewhere as far as most of the people in magical UK believed, but this young heir suspected otherwise. Neville thought back to when he first saw Harry. The small and frightfully skinny ‘Boy Who Lived’ made him worry. There was something so very wrong, but no one else seemed to notice. Even though Harry didn’t really pay him much attention he tried to help.
Lyra nuzzled Harry’s hand comfortingly “you’re right … my aunt, uncle and cousin hate anything magic. They didn’t want me and they made it very clear, but it wasn’t too bad at first in comparison. I was given the cupboard to sleep in, got meals about five times a week even though I cooked the meals when I turned four and the beating weren’t horrible, but then my magic got stronger and the accidental magic became more frequent … it got really bad when my invite to school came”
Draco glared at his godfather who was invited for dinner “you knew the second I told you my friend’s name”
Brian grinned, he was eager to leave before he hurt someone “it’s all done, good bye” he heard screams of joy as he left out the door before using his portkey to return to Aster’s home.
“it’s this Severus” Sanguini’s voice purred over the wizard’s ear.
“now Severus don’t be mean” Albus chastised lightly.
“I’m sorry girl, but you need to stay out of sight. When I have time tomorrow night I’ll go get your owl treats … and my homework” he groaned softly, but couldn’t stop the smile as Hedwig hooted softly and fluttered into the attic. Standing on the rickety cot made it easy to shift the attic panel and with a quiet good night to his feathered friend nestled in her cage he closed the panel.
Harry casually munched on his dinner as he double checked the homework he finished so far and then completed the rest. After correcting his grammar and spelling thoroughly he realized that that went much faster than he thought. So many people complain, but it only took one evening … 5 hours or so. Even Snape’s essay was actually pretty simple.
“yes …you should eat a little more” the vampire said when he noticed that Neville had stopped eating ”Eat this half at least. A growing boy needs nourishment” he said as he took the knife and split the remaining chicken into two parts and pointed to the smaller half. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. It seems Trocar adopted Neville too …
Neville sighed sadly as he heard his grandma’s daily stream of belittling comments. It has gotten even worse since he didn’t excel in his first year of school … at least not to her satisfaction. Today was the one day of the week he could get away. He always goes to visit his parents on Sundays, which his grandma didn’t approve of like most things, but she never stopped him …
Frank stabbed the cake with his fork and slowly chewed the chunk of cake making the prisoners drool. When the cake was swallowed the werewolf grinned “brought you some food”
The wizard used magic to get in and looked around. He quietly went upstairs and saw the smiley face drawn on the wall with the word FREE in big red letters …
Lyra and Libra trotted into the room that was being used as a dueling room and laid at Cache’s feet. The false blonde was leaning against the wall reading a magical newspaper that had an article splashing Dumbledore’s words all over the front. It was an excellent read.
Severus opened the door and let Dumbledore in “headmaster what is the problem?”
"I'm speaking"

Poppy knew she could use some help passing out potions, but she knew Harry couldn’t stay with his eyes bothering him so she asked for a few volunteers to help speed things up. It turned out to be a good idea, since many girls needed calming potions after the love potion was removed. What happened to them while they were under the potion is for the aurors to investigate upon their return with Poppy, who went with them to make sure Lockhart didn’t try anything. For now, the five volunteers were just keeping everyone calm until Poppy returned and, apparently, answer stupid complaints.
“your set up is quite different, but it is safe assuming you were taught shield charms …” Severus glanced at Trocar.
“s-she means well, she even gave me my Dad’s wand. It’s doesn’t help that I’m one step away from being a squib” Neville said in his grandmother’s defense, but only succeeded in making the vampire and his pupil look at him blankly. Clearly they weren’t convinced. In fact both were sure Neville’s grandma just wanted a duplicate of her son and was trying to force Neville into those shoes. That didn’t make her a bad person, but it wasn’t the right thing to do.
In order to keep himself from going crazy on the potion problem he has taken breaks to focus on charms. He has become quite good, but not good enough to fix his clothes to fit his new height so he was running around in a sweater and jeans from Dudley’s closet. The extra slack made it fit better than expected on his tall frame, but he was dying to get clothes that fit him for once.
“Daddy what is it looking for?” Julian asked as he finished his ice cream and started nibbling at the waffle bowl.
“sounds like it and this proves that he probably didn’t intend to break his soul” Brian mused out loud.
The muggle flinched as the paper seemed to stick him with an invisible pin, but he was shocked to see his name appear on the line in red ink … his blood. Petunia did as instructed next and Brian after that …
Harry sighed. “Is it so hard for you to be my friend? You’re friends with Luna, I’m friends with Luna. You love Aspen, Aspen is…weirdly obsessed with you. Wouldn’t it just be easier if we got along? I know you avoid me.” He hadn’t planned on being this direct, but if he wanted her to agree to his plan, he had to be sure that she wouldn’t walk out halfway through because they got in a fight.
‘I see.’ He said simply. Harry’s eyes widened in frustration.
While he’s checking the shelves over again, making sure all the books are perfectly level, Harry wanders off and comes back with his laptop. Draco doesn’t use it because he doesn’t understand it and, if he’s honest, all the different buttons sort of scare him.
There was a pause after he’d finished, and he watched Pansy slowly absorb the information he’d overloaded her with.
‘Are you going to leave again?’
“You were the one who said you wanted to learn.” Harry pointed out. After his third attempt, Draco managed to get the car in gear, but by the time he’d done so they were approaching a bend.
‘She’s not here.’ Pansy whispered in his ear.
Deciding that it didn’t matter either way, Draco slowly edged forward towards the light.
Harry seemed to notice Draco’s hesitation, and he let go of his hand. Draco felt bereft for a long moment until Harry’s arm wound around him and he felt his hand resting comfortingly on the small of his back.
‘He thinks you’re in France anyway. It would kind of ruin the surprise if you showed up right there on the platform. You know how much he loves surprises, remember that time we…’ Draco tuned out as Harry started talking about all the times they’d surprised Teddy. He leant his head against the shower wall and tried to ignore the pain in his chest. He was so bloody stupid. Of course things hadn’t changed. Just because he was home and they were working things out didn’t mean the past three years didn’t happen. Teddy was Harry’s godson. Draco might be related by blood but being honest the family feud ran so deep Nymphadora would have hated Draco being anywhere near her son.
‘Draco don’t be silly.’ He held Draco’s face in his hands and Draco felt like he could float away. ‘Listen to me now. I would never do that. I shouldn’t have threatened you with Teddy I’m really sorry.’ He said earnestly.
Harry was amused at how expressive it was, but also struck by its eyes – he could have sworn they were blue at first, but now they were very clearly a pale shade of grey, almost silver in fact. They seemed rather familiar, like the fox was looking at him like it really
‘I’m sorry I didn’t come to see you. Have you been ok?’ He rasped. She held up a finger to shush him.
‘Honestly, considering how much you used to berate Harry for being a reckless Gryffindor, your sense of self-preservation is really quite terrible.’
‘I don’t know why I said it. It isn’t true. I’m stressed and I took it out on you and I’m sorry.’ It wasn’t good enough. He didn’t get to throw curveballs like that and think a simple apology would fix it.
Draco wasn’t entirely sure he was ok with the implications of that. As far as he was concerned, he was still going to be leaving in the next few months.
‘I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ve done with the chateau though. When do we go?’ Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was deliberately avoiding talking about Wood or if he was unaware of how hurt Draco was because of it.
“I thought you were exactly the right sort, unless there’s something you’d like to tell me?” Harry cocks an eyebrow at Malfoy who looks suitably uncomfortable.
eyes as if to say
‘Ella? It’s Draco. I thought I’d stop by for a visit. I’m sorry I haven’t seen you for a while.’ He couldn’t spook her, he had to make her think he was safe. He was safe, after all.
“What the fuck are you doing up so early?!” He exclaimed. She put her hands on her hips and huffed.
‘He always did have a temper on him.’ Draco wasn’t quite sure why he’d decided to talk about Harry as if he was past tense, but he went with it.
‘I’ll send my supervisor through now you’re awake, I expect he’ll have a few questions.’ He nodded and turned back to ask the healer how long he was out, but she’d already gone, and he hadn’t even noticed.
‘I don’t want to talk to him about it.’
“I’ll go.” He said.
The wand was placed on the ground between them at a safe distance. “So that the two separate parts of the spell don’t interact with each other.” Granger clarified. Draco stepped forward and cleared his throat, praying that his Latin translation was close enough.
“Who is Draco?” His voice cracked in the middle of the name.
‘Are you sure? How?’ Harry looked as alarmed as Draco felt. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears as the overwhelming feeling that there was something he was forgetting became more and more prominent. He burned with the desire to know, to understand. He vials on the shelf began rattling and he could feel the itch of magic crackling across his skin. This was it, he just knew it.
‘Uh, yes. I make my own now though and I only need one dose a month. No, wait, that’s not the point. The point is, they put my trial back because I wasn’t well.’ If he was going to do this, he wasn’t going to let Harry distract him.
‘I’m fine.’ His voice was a little choked, but he forced it into some semblance of normality. ‘Go have fun, we can have a nice trip out together tomorrow.’ Harry crossed the distance between them and kissed him fiercely.
Not that he was maudlin. Of course not, he’d never do anything that would make his father even remotely proud of him. Draco surreptitiously pulled his wand down his sleeve and cast a disillusionment charm over himself. Harry and his lady-friend had sat at a table so that Harry was facing the door and there was no way Draco could leave now without being noticed. Disillusionment charms were great, but they couldn’t make a door open and close without anyone noticing. Draco wondered whether Harry told this new woman why he had to face the door. If she knew about the war and how Harry always had to have his main exit in his eyeline in case he had a panic attack.
“Oh, oh shit. I just- I just walked right in here. I didn’t think- I’m sorry. I’ll get out of your way.” He placed the bottle down on a shelf just behind her head, studiously avoiding looking at the vast expanse of her skin currently exposed to him. His own skin prickled with the need to touch her again, but he clamped his hands to his sides.
‘Or he just really loves you.’ He said nonchalantly. He jumped off the window seat and went to the kitchen looking for his breakfast. He’d once told Draco that everything was much more chilled at Draco’s than it was at Harry’s, which surprised Draco because he’d grown up in the manor. He supposed that Harry was a lot more family conscious than Draco – he had always insisted that they at least ate their meals together. Draco had no such regimen.
‘Oh my god.’
, he was Dumbledore. He knew that the only reason he had ever been able to defeat Voldemort had been Tom Riddle’s resulting miscalculation over the owner of the Elder Wand. If Lyra had never become a Death Eater, she could never have been given that impossible task. She would never have been at the tower that night. She wouldn’t have disarmed Dumbledore. The wand would have been Snape’s…
‘Which has already been cleared by the Ministry. What exactly would you write on the form? Fixed a magic disappearing cabinet and accidently cursed a girl with a magic necklace?’
‘Helen?’ Draco asked him, careful to use the right name. Teddy nodded. He reluctantly pulled his head up off the sofa, so Draco could sit down next to him.
‘Anything. Name it.’
‘Don’t get all sappy now! It’s present opening time!’ Teddy giggled. Draco released him and let him begin opening presents. It was a paired down Christmas this year – with everything going on it had been hard to plan much – thankfully Teddy never really asked for much anyway. Even if he did get very excited to open the boxes under the tree.
‘Draco darling!’ Pansy exclaimed as she walked brazenly into his lab. Draco was so shocked he nearly dropped the vial of blood he was extracting from.
Guys. We're almost done. Omg. One more year and an epilogue to go!!!
“Sorry, Goyle,” Pansy rolled her eyes, “I can’t point you in the direction of your next master.”
Either way, it was hard to be in the festive mood given Theo’s reemergence. Draco had gone to Dumbledore already but hadn't heard too much on the matter. Draco figured he would wait and see Theo’s first move before reacting too rashly. He should also write Andromeda to let him know he left her safe house. It might be a good idea to move the others.
of all things underneath the reception table earlier. That was a goddamn Ravenclaw. “Bet you ten galleons it’s Hufflepuff and Andi a Gryffindor."
“Riddikulus.” He said stoically as Harry snickered loudly, raising a hand to hide his face as the rest of the class began to join in all turning to Hermione and chanting the spell at her.
“Wait,” Hagrid interrupted and looked Draco over, “You called her that in front of everyone?”
“I’ve been meaning to tell you,” he said, “We should try wiggentree bark. I’m growing a new batch and can get you some. I think if I modify it or crossbreed with dittany-” He started. Ginny leaned in and whispered something in Harry’s ear. Whatever. Gross.
...ah. Right. Draco watched a white light shoot out around them, illuminating a dementor eerily close to his right before sending it hurtling the other way… which was great, but also Draco recognized that voice and it wasn’t a professor who came to the rescue.
"You don't have a wand."
"How many peppermint patties have you had?" Neville asked. Draco paused. He wasn't planning on going into his animagus form today so he had been devouring all the sweets he hadn't been able to eat recently. He had a few this morning... then a couple more as snacks... also during lunch...
Look, he wasn't eleven anymore. He had developed an appreciation for muggles, yes. That didn't mean he had to enjoy all of their inventions. Was it amazing they made such a machine without magic? Of course! Was that amazing machine also slow and ugly and bumpy enough to make Draco want to vomit on its low-grade interior? Also yes. Not to mention it was red. Why was everything in his life red? He was forced to wear robes, live in a dorm draped in red, befriend red-headed people - the color haunted him.
"No matter who it was, we decided we wanted to go get married."
I know this is a magical world, but like... there was a sword... and the main villain DIDN'T get stabbed? Nonsense.
“Reading your mind?” He asked, “That’s a thing?”
“I can’t hear you! You’re too far behind!”
“Nobody is
, oh my God-”
“Then let us see.”
“Hey. Scarhead.” He prompted and reached out to grab his arms. “Harry, look at me.” He instructed and for the first time he saw what kind of state he was in outside of the blubbering panic. Blood covered the side of his face, drenching his clothes from what looked to be a cut on his arm. Dirt also mixed in along with tears. Draco swallowed and squeezed his arms tighter. “Breathe.” He tried.
“But-”
"Should we
There was a dog guarding the sorcerer’s stone apparently. Turns out a lot of what his new friends discussed were highly dangerous, possibly illegal activities. He was right not to listen. It was ridiculous.
“This is Hermione’s game and
“Ron said you used a spell to wake me up,” he greeted. Draco internally cringed. He didn’t like the way Harry was looking at him. They were alone in one of the house’s many rooms - Draco had gone to one of the more obscure ones in hopes of being left alone - but alas. Not even the house's favor helped when his highness Sir Potter decided they needed to speak.
a voice said a few moments later,
“Hi,” He said lamely “Sorry to bother you.”
written Valentine’s day card in their second year was from Ginny. Draco sighed. Somewhere down the line somebody was going to have to inform Harry that he was attractive because Draco didn’t think he would ever figure it out himself.
“I suppose,” Draco murmured. It was a fair point. Theo, while the younger of the two, did love Winston. Maybe he didn’t want to disgrace him. Plus with all the tournament stuff going on… more people would be critical that his brother wasn’t chosen as a champion.
"That's how a mirror works! Besides, it wasn't
“Oh,” Draco began nervously. Somewhere in the back of his mind, his animagus senses perked up. Was that... cinnamon? “Well… I, um-”
“I thought I wasn’t the reason?”
“Hey,” Ron greeted quietly as the others walked back upstairs, “I need to talk to you.” He said and Draco looked over from where he had dumped the dishes in the sink. The others were still in the dining room, now whispering among one another. “I didn’t say anything to Harry and Hermione. Didn’t want to freak them out,” he explained, “But… where were you this summer?”
“Very much disagree. I’m not awkward.”
“...am so disappointed in you!” Hermione was seething. Ginny also popped in to announce she was disappointed (at not receiving an invite) before stealing Harry away and disappearing once more.
“I can see that,” Theo said and shook his head, “Draco caught me up on a lot of what you’ve been doing. I’m here to take over. You look exhausted.” He said, handing her an apple. “I got this hippogriff nonsense. You sleep.” He said and Hermione laughed, a bit hysterically.
with all his password changes and what not. Draco had gotten into a shouting match with the idiot at one point.
“FOR THE LOVE OF MY MOTHER AND HER ANCESTORS!” Seamus’ voice shouted from out of nowhere, “STOP FLIRTING FOR FIVE GODDAMN MINUTES!”
Draco sighed. Harry. Of course, Harry found him. It was always Harry, wasn’t it?
“Um,” Draco began and pointed at the three of them, “We aren’t investigating that.”
“That they needed to heal the snake.” Harry said. Draco turned to Hermione for an explanation.
Hermione.
“I haven’t said anything. I won’t. I will never like the man, Draco. I wish you would stay far away from him. I don’t trust him or anything he does. He is the worst purebloods and Gryffindors have to offer,” he said, lip curling in disgust. Draco waited. “But,” he continued just when he was sure he wouldn’t, “I did some investigating into the Potter situation.” He admitted.
"You can keep that one. It seems to be lucky." He said and walked over to him, "You look good." He added. Sirius beamed in return. Freedom suited him well. He wore new robes - ones that actually fit and seemed to be of decent quality. His hair was brushed out, healthy, and actually looked decent and his face wasn't nearly as pale or gaunt as it had been in previous years.
“To which question? The patronus or the muggles?” Draco asked and when Harry opened his mouth, waved him away. “Nevermind. You’re clearly mixing your stories up as we speak.”

“Yes, but only because-”
"I thought you might want to meet him!" Dora said defensively, "There is no war here
"Horrendous. Absolutely unacceptable."
"I have a gun," Jenkins said wisely and Ron pointed at him.
wizards read potions? Maybe… it’s him. Or perhaps Professor Snape,” he drawled out. Ron looked around before shrugging.
“You’re amazing.” He said as he let go. Draco turned red.
pray tell?” The creepy turban loon (Squirrel or something…? Quirrell!) asked, his hands trembling slightly as he tried to gesture around him.
Harry didn't need to be told twice. Within seconds he was next to him, pulling out a rather impressive assortment of calming droughts out of his bag and sliding them towards Draco.
“An idea?” Ron repeated. Draco nodded before gently nudging Harry off of him, “Draco?”
Harry demanded and Draco resisted the urge to throw something at him.
“Kind of…? Our family literally inbreeds, Draco. Shut up.” She snapped.
“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR GODDAMN MIND?!” Andromeda shrieked, “SOMEONE TOLD YOU THERE WAS A MURDERER ON THE LOOSE AND YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD JUST PRANCE ABOUT THE SCHOOL AFTER HOURS?!”
“Hi,” Draco said and shoved a Durmstrang student out of the way, “I’m Draco and I have a business transaction to discuss with you.” He solemnly. Fleur tilted her head, twisting a string of hair between her fingers before giving a small smile.
Dumbledore grimaced.
1. Montague threw the stupid rememberall after some more bickering
Draco saw Nagini's head hit the ground right as he heard Voldemort scream. There. It was done. All the horcruxes were gone.
“I bet you would blush just trying to flirt with me.” Harry decided.
"Hi," he greeted, "I'm glad to see you're doing better," he added, softening his voice. Ollivander beamed back at him, "I... obviously, you're recovering, but I wanted to ask you about my wand," he explained and dug out the two snapped pieces to hold out. Ollivander frowned and set a cup aside, reaching out to pluck the wood from his hand and examine it closely. "I wanted to know if it could be fixed."
So, yeah, he couldn’t tell Harry. Wouldn’t. Even if part of him really, really,
“I do,” Draco whispered.
“Yes, professor.” He told her. She gave a short nod and placed the quill back on her desk.
"I- I mean, of
killed anyone yet, right? He tried to remember if his parents had mentioned anything to him about the chamber. Probably, but he couldn’t remember now.
"That would mean you and Harry are married."
"Where's Draco?"
"Diadem," Cho Chang answered, crossing her arms over his chest, "And no. We think the
“I am now.” He whispered back.
“Yeah, we have to.” Ron said pointing at Harry with a firm nod. Draco turned to Hermione for help, but she seemed to also be mulling over Harry’s words. Right. This was too much for him.
Theo’s eyes snapped into focus.
“Are we supposed to stop it?” Hermione asked. Draco leaned against the doorway. Good question, Hermione. He waited for the answer.
This was... a lot to digest. Blaise and Pansy had left the safety of Andromeda's to join Theo? Knowing that Death Eaters were after him? Knowing that if they were caught and told where Andromeda's safe house was that their unbreakable vows would kill them? What motivation did they have for any of this? Blaise seemed so earnest as well. He was wringing his hands, eyes flicking around nervously as he waited for Draco to give him some sort of direction. Somehow, despite the untidy robes and clear lack of sleep, he still looked refined and poised.
fucking died? Part of him wanted to hiss in frustration. This was awful. And it should be illegal. The fear he felt right now? Illegal. Why wasn’t it illegal to feel this sick? Why were people laughing and clapping? He wanted to hex them until they screamed.
(Hermione said they shouldn’t call each other by their surnames) offered him a treacle tart.
"I, um, well-" Draco started, flushing pink right down to his roots. Ron snorted from Draco's other side because he was the worst. "I didn't really mean to invite myself or anything. My aunt usually spends the holidays with me-"
“Yeah. He’s with Neville.” He said and Draco frowned. Right. At the beginning of the year Moody’s unforgivable curse lesson seemed to have shaken him more than Harry. “He’s helping him with some herbology stuff before Hermione finds them and makes them both join SPEW.” He said and Draco clicked his tongue. Ah, SPEW. He wondered if Viktor had been introduced to Hermione’s most recent political lobbying. The idea of the huge Bulgarian listening to Hermione prattle on about house elf rights made him smile. The next time Draco saw him, he was going to tell him the fastest way to Hermione’s approval was to wear a SPEW badge… Dear God, please let Viktor Krum walk around wearing a SPEW badge. Please.
"A pensieve. You made Draco a scrapbook." He added with a shrug. Andromeda slowly lowered her weapons. It had been awhile since he'd seen her. She looked pretty good for being in the middle of a war. Maybe it had something to do with being a grandmother. Speaking of which-
“That brings me to my next point,” Ron said, tapping his wand against a knight, “They’ll assume Hermione and I are with Harry.” He added as Harriet slid up to the pieces and started knocking over Ron’s side. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Is that a promise?"
Needless to say, when Monday came around he was exhausted… so when the crying came from the girls’ bathroom he wasn’t thrilled. Now, Draco had gotten pretty familiar with Moaning Myrtle’s wails of post-death agony so he knew it wasn’t her, but… he also recognized the flash of red hair and worn robes that had disappeared around the corner moments before.
"I'm confused," Draco said, "Did you like one of us?"
"When a bleeding four-eyed nightmare with bad hair decides to bother you for no reason," Draco told him sourly. Harry poked him again, "
"What the Hell does that even mean?" Draco said, voice raising slightly, "You're going to chuck me into Azkaban because they
"You put Pepper-up potion in this, didn't you?"
“You know,” he said and held out his hand, “I don’t really fancy going to class anymore. Lockhart doesn’t actually teach anyways.” He said and Ginny gave a small smile at that. “I’m going to read some more about muggles. Do you want to come with?” He asked. Arthur liked muggles well enough. Maybe Ginny did too.
“Give him a second to rest!” Lily called back from the other room.
An awkward pause followed. Ron and Hermione exchanged wary looks over him - they had probably already prepared whatever they were about to say as they always did when they thought something would upset Harry.
want to be honest. About everything. So when they ask you something you kind of have to deflect. Like… they asked me if I was loyal to them and I said I was loyal to my family and beliefs. That sort of thing.” He shrugged.
gave Sirius a pause, “Also, um, you might not be safe here.” He said and handed Sirius the letter he had tucked away in his coat. Harry and Ron both exchanged alarmed looks. Draco had figured it was better to leave this out in hopes of keeping them from overreacting.
“We find a way to be supportive of their relationships?” She asked. Draco grimaced.
...yeah. Draco was going to have to work hard to get that relationship less awkward.
“You didn’t warn him?” Neville asked, “Weren’t you two dating?”
. Pretty sure you couldn't die even if you wanted to." He mused and then grinned at him, "Besides, I'll protect you."
Predictably, the spell backfired, throwing him into the ground with a thud. The Slytherins roared with laughter… yeah, Draco didn’t exactly blame them there.
“Stop acting like you know what she’s saying!”
"Dora?" A voice asked and Draco watched in amusement as Remus went to put down his wand only to notice Dora also about to put down hers. She grinned at him. "What are you - Harry, it's great to see you - why are you here? Stop -
“Not really. That might be because of… Past familial events. I’m not sure.” He admitted and nudged her shoulder “If it makes you feel any better, I know you would be the person I missed most.” He grinned at her, “Me?
Oh, Draco… the fun part about dramatic irony is that we all know how badly you fucked up with those last few sentences to Hermione RIP. That mental breakdown is coming. I promise the next chapter will be fraught with some major character development for our boy, worry not.
“You thought so?” Ted asked, appearing from seemingly nowhere so that Draco jumped, “Good! I thought we could go to a football match this summer to give you the real muggle experience. You do know about football, right?”
The point was that Draco was trying to be agreeable to the DA stuff even if his schedule was becoming… very full.
,” Harry hissed and slid in his seat as a flash followed them. Draco paused, baffled. Was that… a
Draco was totally jinxing his socks when they were done here.
"But at least let me fix things first."
“Oh, you go to that now?” Draco called after him. Harry flicked him off, gaining the attention of a stern McGonagall who marched after him - probably to give out a detention. Draco sighed as he left.
Draco gave a small yelp, almost falling off the bed at the voice. He jerked up to see a portrait of Regulus was looking down at him with a rather bored expression. For the most part, Draco knew portraits spoke, but photos typically didn’t. The painting was so realistic he hadn’t known which one it was.
"He will not." Dumbledore said simply. A deep knowing in his expression. A kind of knowing that Draco knew he would never thirst for. Yanking his bag up, he turned away. "There is no shame," Dumbledore told him, suddenly, "In being a pawn. They are the only innocent pieces on the board. The ones who don't need to worry about the hard decisions or sacrifices." He told him and swallowed before continuing, "One day," he finally said, voice quiet and almost... maybe even a little broken, "I hope you might understand I did make sacrifices. There are times and reasons in which you will have to sacrifice those you love for the greater good," he said and looked Draco over for a moment - with an intensity that almost made him think there was some sort of hidden message there, "You may need to remember that one day."
"You didn't fail," Severus said, looking over his shoulder before glancing back at Sirius warily, "His fate was sealed for years."
“Yeah, well, I don’t ever feel particularly brave,” Draco admitted, “I wouldn’t do half of what I do if it weren’t for the others.” He said and Lupin laughed.
"You think you can hurt us with that stick?" One of them said, voice mocking and Severus rolled his eyes, looking seconds from casting a stunning spell when another one of the muggles spoke up from the back.
“Oh, she’d
"James says no PDA." He announced. Draco was torn between outrage and amusement as Harry turned a dark red, looking completely at loss on how to deal with a parent embarrassing him from the beyond. Draco snorted.
“I went off on him during our third year,” Draco shrugged, “Maybe he was thinking about some of the stuff I said… I didn’t ever mention their first names though. I’m pretty sure he knew your mother.” He added. Harry blinked. “I don’t really know the details, but… some of the stuff he says. I think he knew her well, actually. I know he hated your dad and stuff, but it might have been different with her.”
“We’ll keep it a secret.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bellatrix went still.
“Did you know that about him?” Ron asked Theo aggressively, “Did you know he loves quills?”
Daphne said, holding Pansy back when she launched herself across the table. Theo gave a delighted laugh.
flooing over with all the new restrictions the Ministry set in place.”
“I don’t think so,” He shrugged “But we all know Harry. If he didn’t have Ron who would do the stupid stuff with him? They were friends first.” He snorted and Hermione smiled a little at that.
"Bella, please," Draco tried again, "I can make it right. I just need-"
“I thought it was a normal wizard thing!” Harry defended as Draco tried hard - very hard - not to start yelling. Instead, he put a hand over his mouth before trying to speak again as calmly and rationally as he could.
“Dinner!” Slughorn called. His arm was still slung around Harry. When their eyes met, Draco grinned at him, ignoring the panicked gesture Harry was giving him to intervene. He wanted to talk to Eldred Worple over whatever Slughorn was going to force them to eat and maybe have a glass of wine.
far. Sure enough, when Severus finally did take out his wand, he didn't place it at Harry's feet.
"You just have that?"
“You can’t understand Harriet,” Hermione told him and Draco shrugged. Whatever. They had a bond. Rolling her eyes, she took some of the valerian root he was using out of his hand. “I’m serious. He’s been acting off, hasn’t he?” She asked. Draco looked up. He had noticed, in truth. “Both of you-”
McGonagall paused.
Draco looked down at his charms book.
“Are you
"Oh, I've seen dad bring home one of those." Ginny said as Draco summoned a platter of food, "Bill thought it was an ancient torture device. We tried to use it on Percy, but nothing really happened. Well, other than him getting angry." She mused and jumped up on one of the table to try and touch it. Draco slapped slapped her hand away. In turn, she poked him in the eye, which Draco felt was
such a Gryffindor.” He said and then paused, “Wait. It’s not an insult. Stop using that as an insult.” He said and threw a bone over his shoulder to grab another one. Draco scowled.
“I was in hiding.” He said, going with the same spiel he had told Ron. It seemed to work as Harry deflated a bit, lips pursing as he mulled out the window. Draco considered. “I, uh, was thinking of some useful things to know. Now that...he’s back.” He continued slowly. Harry glanced over at him.
“You… said you played quidditch too?” He said, tilting his head.
“Have you told her you made up with Theo yet?” Harry asked blandly from where he was still slumped over in his armchair. Draco ignored him. The letter was fairly… short. Cautiously worded and… ah.
“It’s because they still think of me as a kid,” Nymphadora sighed, probably sensing his thoughts as she crossed her arms over her chest. “Give them a second. They’ll remember.”
"I need to go," he said, placing a hand on Harry's arm, "Also, if you don't get into the damn car then I'm going to kill one of you. You have three seconds." He added to the Dursleys. Vernon went bright red.
The rest of the evening went by in what felt like minutes. He danced with Fleur... then Hermione... then Ginny challenged Fred and George to a dance-off, which McGonagall ended up judging. Molly gave a very sweet speech and Harry gave a very awkward speech. Draco's time to shine had also finally come.
“They were looking for you. Winston was worried they would use him to find you. That’s why he wanted to tell the Order. I
"Mr. Malfoy," she greeted when Draco walked up, "It has been a few weeks since I've seen you," she noted and glanced over her shoulder, "Your husband can be insufferable in your absence, I hope you know," she added and Draco fought back a grin by how exasperated she looked by the mere mention of it, "I do hope Professor Binns returns soon. Him and Nott are... very determined to annoy one another."
“We can all sit together,” she insisted stubbornly, “Draco is my friend and wouldn’t have been in danger tonight if he didn’t try to help me after you were mean,” she snapped at them and Potter looked at his shoes.
Fuck it. Draco might stop by for Easter.
“Yeah, but you need to trust me with my own.” Draco told him, stopping so he could turn and look at him. Harry seemed to falter at that. “I know I’ve sucked at doing this so far. I couldn’t handle lying to you guys, I got myself caught up with Death Eaters sooner than I meant to, I’m not handling this summer as well as I should… I… I get it.” He said, rubbing the side of his arm. “And I know you’re scared for me and that sucks. I hate that I’m doing that to you, but…” He looked at the ground for a moment back and then back at him and shook his head.
is beyond me," Andromeda said, shaking her head before Draco could reply, "Not to mention your side lost the war-"
"Shh..." He said and closed his eyes, "Shh. Just... silence." He whispered and took a long breath, "I... am so...
“So to be clear,” Draco said, holding up a finger at the spiders circling around them, “We tell you that Hagrid has been arrested under suspicion of opening the Chamber of Secrets. You tell us this is wrong and give us some hints as to what it is because you’re too cowardly to say it’s name and… what? You kill us now so we can’t prove your friend innocent?” He asked and paused. Wait. Spiders won’t speak of it.
"Well, we asked her if she liked being called Andi," Draco told Harry, "I don't think any child would agree to be Albus. You know, after the man who was
“Come on,” he finally prompted them and yanked at Ron’s arm, “Let’s go.”
"Who the Hell did you bring in here?" A new voice called and Harry looked up to see Daphne Greengrass standing in front of them. "...what the Hell, Astoria? Is that Harry Potter?" She asked and took a long breath, "ANDROMEDA!" She called and walked over to help Hermione up, "YOU HAVE A MUDBLOOD, A BLOODTRAITOR, AND THE CHOSEN ONE HERE TO SEE YOU!" She shouted.
”You’re not in love with Neville, ” Sadie told him when he had joined the other Slytherins for a study session. “You just think you are because he is someone you would like to be in love with.” She said simply. As if anything she just said made sense.
"Didn't you hear? We eloped on the way over -" He began as Dora gasped, "I'm
When Draco (finally) found Harry again he was alone and staring out towards where there were shouts and yells.
"And?" Harry prompted, eyes glittering with amusement. Draco looked him up and down.
“Okay, then. Fuck you.” He said and Harry shot up.
“Draco,” Harry frowned, looking a bit alarmed at the outburst.
"Mind yourself." Severus told him darkly. Draco shook his head. This was getting him nowhere. Plus, they were sidetracked from his original question. He had half a mind to redirect them back to it when a light knock followed. He turned to find Harry peering in before giving a small wave. Severus glowered before gesturing him in.
of him. He thought back to the manor.
Lucius’ eyes widened a bit as he spun around to find Draco in the corner. There was a beat of awkward silence as the pair looked at one another and then at the journal between them. It was clear what they both knew. You did this. You gave this journal to a little girl. You almost killed people. You hurt Hermione.
Draco sighed. “Actually Granger, I brought second dosages because I am, in fact, not a total moron.”
‘Play him at his own game.’
“Because that was what I was expecting too.” There might have been a moment between the two of them if it wasn’t for the loud crash that came from above. At the top of the room, through the door they came in, a group of at least ten hit wizards came bursting in, wands raised. Draco looked at Granger and she was almost returned to her regular appearance bar a slight distortion of her nose and mouth. That must mean that his own Polyjuice had worn off already.
