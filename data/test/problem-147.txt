Harry walked down the aisles, searching aimlessly for a book to read to pass the time. He ran his fingers along the bindings, stopping on one that piqued his interest. Satisfied, he returned to his table at the back of the library, hidden by rows of lined up bookshelves. Harry sat down and sighed in content, opening the front cover of the book to read.
He didn't want people to think he needed someone to look after him at all times, just to make sure he would live to see another day.
"Draco," Harry started, grabbing the blonde's soft hand in his own, "I had a great time today. Even if you did cry, I'm glad it wasn't because of me,"
Much to the pale boy’s surprise, Harry only hugged him tighter. Draco’s heart swelled in his chest at security he felt in those tan arms. His tears had slowed and begun to dry; he was thankful that the darkness hid the puffy skin under his eyes.
disrupting other students? You of all people should know better than that, Mr. Zabini." Quirrell smirked as an embarrassed flush colored Blaise's already dark skin. The class snickered as he walked over to the last available seat, a few rows down. The entire school knew of
“But you look better,” Draco retorted, though he didn’t know where this random boost of confidence came from.
“He started drinking more often, about every other day, if not every day. I was surprised, as we were only sixteen at the time, but he thought it was okay. He would say how he would be fine, that he wouldn’t drink that much. But he always did. I still remember the first time h-he… hit me.”
“It gets better.” Harry smiled widely, eyelids squinting into half-crescent moons in the bright light. He began walking down the nature-made trail, letting his feet take him where they need to go, having already memorized the exact location. They arrived at a sort of cliff, the calm sound of rushing water greeting their ears. Draco let go of Harry’s hand, walking cautiously towards the edge. It was closer to the ground than he expected, though still quite high. A small waterfall caught his eye, glinting in the hot sun. Draco gasped quietly at its beauty, unable to look away. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”
Luckily, the music remained unbothered, still flowing out from underneath the second door on his right. He soon reached the top of the stairs, moving towards the door in anticipation. Harry rapped his knuckles on the door lightly, hoping it was loud enough for the boy inside to hear.
Harry felt his chest tighten at the blonde’s tone of voice, subconsciously squeezing him tighter. “I-” He hoped with all that he had that he wouldn’t regret this. “I promise.”
sorry for the long wait! i was super busy these past few weeks with family and such. updates might start coming a bit slower so thank you for your patience with me.
“No!” Harry yelled, wanting to laugh at the situation he managed to get himself into, but he knew it would make things worse.  “How could you possibly think I would do that to you?”
“We were arguing about his problem, how I thought he should stop before things got worse. Blaise didn’t agree. He went on endlessly about how he could handle himself, that he knew he wouldn’t go too far. Of course, he was wrong. He reached his breaking point; just…slapped me. We were both shocked. I pushed him away for a solid week, ignoring and avoiding him like the plague. By that point, I had already accepted the fact that I would never go back to him, that he must not have been my soulmate because would he act like that if he were? That was until he apologized, made a big show about it and everything. I, being the lovesick puppy I am, forgave him and we went back to the way things were before. But that was a mistake. Even though things are long over, I regret it to this day.”
A few quiet minutes pass, the sound of the waves crashing on the shore filling the silence between the two. Surprisingly, it wasn't awkward, but comfortable; it felt as if they've known each other for years.
"Wait, right now? In my pajamas?" Draco asked, appalled, gesturing at his blue and black plaid pajama pants and plain black shirt. Plus, his hair was a mess and he was sure he looked utterly distraught.
left him that day just one year ago, Draco was stuck picking up his own broken pieces. His eyes soon fluttered shut in exhaustion, his vision slowly fading into sleep.
Harry, though it feels like it's been years. Sure, he crushed on him forever, but he never got the chance to see this side of him. He can't help but think he might be.....
“Oh.” Draco said, his mind already running wild. He was hoping the two could just cuddle and lay about, like they usually do. He swallowed the words he wished to say, not wanting to sound controlling. “Okay.”
“What is it, Granger?” Draco drawled, rubbing a hand over his face in attempt to wake up his drowsy features.
Draco finished up in the shower, towel drying his hair and body before dressing himself in his hoodie and jeans. By the time he was ready, it was already well past six, meaning he could just head to school early. He told the girls he was leaving, earning whines and hums goodbye. He rolled his eyes, grabbing his keys off his desk and leaving the apartment.
Now he sat, alone, at one of the empty tables outside, when all he wanted was to see his favorite blonde boy. The wind blew threw his thin jacket and the curls on top of his head, making the hair stand on his arms as he shivered. Harry picked at the chipping red paint on the table out of boredom, his chin propped up on his left hand.
Pansy didn’t miss the not-so-subtle topic change, but accepted it regardless, “To check on you of course. Your-“
Harry couldn't help but be excited for his date on Friday, with none other than his crush, Draco Malfoy. Believe it or not, it was his first in a long time. He felt giddy inside, knowing this might be his chance to make Draco his.
Harry shook his head, attempting to dismiss the conversation, "Come off it, Ron." But Ron kept persisting, a series of 'come on's and an adamant use of the 'best friend' card rapidly flying out of the ginger's mouth.
Suddenly, a bushy brown-haired girl stepped in the way of Draco’s aggressive stride. He raised an eyebrow at her, moving to walk around her. She followed, standing her ground. Draco sighed, knowing this must be important.
The ride went smoothly, quiet but for the local radio station playing overrated pop songs. They pulled into a small restaurant; Draco’s favorite.
Draco buried his head deeper into his pillow, wrapping his large comforter tighter around his body. One of his kittens, Tiberius, hopped up onto the bed, his small paws quietly pattering across the soft sheets. He paused in front of Draco’s face, mewling and pawing at the blonde’s nose. Draco allowed himself a small smile, ruffling the thick white fur on its back; his cats always knew when he was feeling sad. He sighed, content leaving his body just as quick as it came.
Draco finished his explanation but didn’t dare look at the girls in front of him. At some point he had covered his face with his hands to hide the darkening blush on his cheeks, so it wasn’t as if he had a choice. He peeked through his fingertips to find the dark-haired girl looking at him in an amused sadness, only a look Pansy could pull. Pansy grabbed him by the arm, slowly pulling him into a hug. He tentatively returned the embrace and looked at Hermione, who gave him a weak shrug.
"I don't know," Draco laughed, pulling away from the embrace, wiping his eyes on his jacket sleeve of the happy tears found there. Hermione giggled at the sight; she'd never seen Draco cry in the years that she's known him, even if they were just happy tears. Draco found that he couldn't stop the large smile on his face, even when he could feel a certain curly-haired boy, smiling fondly despite the weird looks from his friends, looking his way.
She pulled out of his embrace, quickly wiping the tears under her eyes and smudging the already messy mascara. Draco watched her stand,
“I…’m not that hungry,” Draco settled for, hoping that Harry would drop it, though knowing him, he wouldn’t.
“Oh, that boy has got something coming,” Pansy mumbled, clearly annoyed. She whipped out her phone, preparing to type something in, “This is exactly what we talked about!”
Harry looked down at the blonde, watching the dying tears roll down the illuminated features. He was truly the most beautiful person he had ever seen.
Draco’s face heated, looking back down at the white cat next to him, who in turn looked up at Harry with large blue eyes, “I-I can explain…”
Draco shook his head, his chest suddenly aching for a new reason. He missed his boyfriend. His face flushed at how fast it hit him. His mind constantly wanders to just how little time he's truly
He took that moment to finally realize that there was a weight on his abdomen. At the achingly familiar voice, he peeked one eye open until a sliver of the person was in view; Pansy.
The curly-haired boy smiled crookedly and nodded. He leaned forward and kissed Draco’s forehead, not wanting to pressure him into anything.
“Don’t remember exactly,” Harry replied, taking a bite of his food before finishing. “I suppose I was probably angry and went for a drive, found the dirt road and thought, ‘Yes, it’s definitely a good idea to drive down this unpaved road by myself in the middle of nowhere.’” Draco giggled softly, leaning his head onto Harry’s shoulder as he talked.
Harry chuckled, the sound vibrating in his chest against Draco’s ear. “Agreed. Ron could definitely do better. On a negative note, my ‘friends’ are acting the same. As if I didn’t just
Draco jumped slightly in surprise, nearly forgetting he was there. He turned to look at the boy, finding him watching him from a few feet away. His cheeks brightened, and he smiled. “Amazing.”
“Have you ever…brought anyone else here?” Draco couldn’t help but ask, jealousy spiking sharply in his chest.
Draco made a mental note to visit her after school, and another to actually get a job. Not to sound like the typical rich white boy, but he never had to worry about money given his father's financial situation. His mother constantly reminded him that he didn't have to. But things are different now.
Draco nodded quickly, attempting to take a deep breath, “Just get me through this,” It had been a while since he had any sort of anxiety attack, and he wasn’t about to start again. Especially not in front of the entire school.
He could feel him boring holes into the back of his head, but he ignored it, paying his full attention to the lesson before him.
Harry strayed by the living room couch, back against the wall and cup of generic alcohol in hand, trying his best to keep himself away from the loud music and dancing. He made sure not to drink too much, wanting to go home sober to Draco. He still couldn’t figure out why he agreed to this; his so-called friends continuously pester him about it, still claiming that Harry deserved a night out to just hang with the guys and let loose a little. Despite wanting to hang with only one certain boy, he agreed, though mentally deciding this would probably be his last party.
"What?" Draco asked, his smile dimming. The girls smirked simultaneously, sharing a knowing look. Sometimes it was creepy how similar they were; if they weren't soulmates, people would definitely think they were long lost siblings.
He pulled his iPhone from his pocket and clicked it on, sending the boy a quick text asking if he was around. Harry replied in under a minute, "
Draco paused, looking up to find Harry staring angrily at the wall. Feeling the blonde’s stare, he looked over, his expression turning sheepish. Before he could apologize again, Draco picked up the small cat, moving it to the foot of the bed, despite its meows of protest. Draco moved closer to Harry, allowing the larger to wrap his arms around the pale boy’s frame. Draco sighed in contentment, before continuing.
“Morning.” He manages, eyes flitting this way and that. He doesn’t dare make eye contact with the other man, the green would be arresting in the morning sun and Draco isn’t prepared for that sort of thing just yet.
Should Draco tell him? Should he unlock the doors to the sea of memories he so resolutely keeps hidden away? What always seems to slither out to dance freely behind his eyelids when he falls asleep?
“Another time, perhaps.” Draco echoes, and the two of them smile quaintly, before slipping into a comfortable, if heavy silence.
Potter makes a contemplative face, almost a facsimile of a peaceful expression and it’s strange to see. As though Draco shouldn’t be allowed. He doesn’t recall a single instance in which he’s seen Harry Potter looking peaceful.
“Sorry about that, some of Teddy’s curry traveled into my ear somehow.” Potter says as he reenters from the bathroom, wagging a finger at his godson and unknowingly shattering Draco’s swift moment of contemplation.
“Why did you say it wasn’t me?” Potter asks breathlessly, and Draco takes a breath. He looks away, and schools himself. Enough of the hot tears, of the trembling. He’s twenty years old, a grown man. He can’t just go crying and blubbering over his mistakes forever. In front of Potter, no less.
“I don’t think this is the kind of place to talk about…that. Custody arrangements, yes, the rest of it, perhaps not.” Draco points out, alighting at the subtle hints of orange in his Earl Grey. The right and only kind of citrus that belongs in tea.
It seems not to have come from the Ministry, then. Draco looks over his shoulder, thinking of Edward still sleeping in his bed, and allows himself to imagine a world where they never have to leave this place.
“What’s wrong, monloup?” Draco breathes, wiping the child’s tears away with the hem of his own ragged pajama shirt. He hates seeing Edward in pain more than most everything Draco dislikes, which to be fair is a notably long list.
To be better for Edward, he has to be better for himself. He remembers Andromeda pouting and providing him some tidbit about ‘accepting that you need help is the first and best step’. He laughs ironically.
“That’s right, Edward. I won’t lie to you.” Draco sighs, adjusting the downy, white blanket he’d thrown around the toddler before they’d apparated from the church. The boy’s cheeks are getting red from the approaching frigidity in the air.
“I see the swing, Teddy.” He replies absentmindedly, looking around for Potter. Draco doesn’t particularly enjoy being in muggle areas without the accompaniment of at least one other wizard. It’s nothing to do with his past prejudice, though that lingers in his conscience like a stubborn tick, but rather his complete ignorance of anything non magical. Were a muggle to come up to him and attempt pleasant, morning time conversation he’d surely be lost. Left gaping like a very stupid fish.
“Do you really have any other options, Malfoy? If so, pray tell.” His question is still sharp, but its certainly more polite than what Draco would’ve said, evidently.
“We’re getting tea, Teddy. Would you like some?” Potter asks the toddler. The boy blinks owlishly, and as natural as breathing his skin becomes slightly darker and his hair grows untamed and black. He looks like some bastardized version of a Potter-Malfoy child, or a Black. Draco goes decidedly with the latter.
No, he is not ‘okay'. He’s absolutely terrified. Malfoys don’t do this, he was never taught to open up, to speak of the torture he faces in head, to apologize. Chins were to be high, jaws set, eyes narrowed, to be a man, be merciless; to show no weakness. Besides, it’s the last thing he deserves. He knows telling Potter- not just anyone- every nuance of the hell he’s lived, well- he’d feel better.
“I live in Grimmauld Place, which you technically have claim to. There’s plenty of rooms, and besides, having a Black in the house might shut Walburga up for once.” Potter points out in a rush, scribbling something on his parchment and allowing at last a cinched brow to disrupt his eerily placid face.
Hey guys!!! I know it's been a while and I know this chapter is S H O R T but I've got a lot of stuff going on, my laptop broke (like I havent already written all of this on my phone but I'd use it to edit) and I kinda want to die most of the time BUT writing makes me feel Better damnit so heres what I got!!!!
“Okay?” Edward asks him, hands pressed seriously into the floor where he is playing with blocks at Draco's feet. Draco chuckles mirthlessly, and clutches his arms tighter around his middle.
Draco continues musing over his maternal family’s nonsensible intricacies whilst Teddy babbles on, far too energetic for seven in the morning, until at last he hears a faint apparation pop nearby. Draco’s head swivels round, growing frustrated with all the bloody vehicles and dull brown brick that floods his vision.
Harry nods, mouth crumpling a bit in thought. He hikes Teddy further up his hip, grunting a bit because Teddy is getting rather heavy and growing much too fast. Draco moves forward to adjust his little, green cap but thinks better of it. He’s fine, Draco is simply clucky when he’s nervous.
“Moving on.” Draco says stiffly, closing the subject with a flick of his hand. “What’s your schedule?”
Draco shrugged, “Father keeps tabs on me. He’s not pleased that he’s gotten word that I’m not living up to his standards. His threats aren’t getting through over paper so he’s coming to see me. I’m not keen on seeing him, especially since he’s coming alone. He’s normally bearable when Mum comes with, but he made it very clear it’s just him.”
“Goodnight, Pans, I had a wonderful evening,” Draco kissed her forehead. She smiled at him then turned away and traipsed down the hallway towards their Common Room.
Yall have absolutely floored me with your reactions! Thank you to the end of the universe and back for every view, kudos, subscription, bookmark, and comment! It seriously makes my entire day!
I hope everyone enjoyed this long-awaited chapter! Let me know your thoughts!! I hope everyone in America has a safe and Happy Thanksgiving (Zoom is eliminating it's 40 minute time limit just fyi). And happy holidays for anyone else celebrating things around the world. (the one drawback of Ao3s statistics is they do not tell you the country of origin of the people reading the story like Fanfiction does) You all brighten my days. Thanks for coming with me on this adventure.
“Well, then that makes it extra hilarious that he was stuck as a rainbow canary.” Harry’s eyes drifted up to Draco’s cheek. It was even more purple than the day before. He started to feel the anger that had been present the last couple weeks, and even worse after this past weekend, bubble up again.
“Please hold his hand to your mark,” Pomfrey instructed. Harry did what he was told, and fervently hoped it didn’t bring Draco as much pain as Harry was experiencing touching Draco’s mark. Harry ignored the feeling of his hand being burned, focusing instead on gritting his teeth against what felt like acid flowing through his body.
“No shit, because no one in their right mind is going to stick around after cursing Potter. Which makes reason number three why it was not us. Now if you’ll excuse me, if Saint Potter does not need a parade in his honour for surviving that attempt on his life, we’ll be going inside. Feel free to check my wand where I’m not freezing my bollocks off.”
“At the Cup, we were on our way out. The twins shoved into Ron, and I fell into Draco. He caught my arm and the marks appeared. We’ve been meeting in secret this year up until our fight last week. I’ve been ignoring him all week until last night.”
“Fuck, Potter, come on. Look at me,” A deep familiar voice commanded. Harry blinked trying to focus on the dark outline in front of him, his eyes ached. His whole body hurt. “Shit your glasses, hold on,
Draco waited a few moments before striding out as well and making his way towards Hogsmeade. He was to meet Father at the Three Broomsticks, at least it was somewhere public. Hopefully that meant he would only be verbally punished. Draco tried to stuff down the anxiety brewing inside him. His words to Hermione had been honest. There was nothing he could do to please his Father. This year had made that obvious. He had written every letter, had corresponded with all the people his Father had asked, his marks were perfect, he was apprenticing with Severus. None of that mattered in the eyes of his Father. The only thing he cared about is if he was bullying Muggleborns, if he bonded, if he was flaunting his money and reputation enough.
“Why was I packing by hand again?” Harry asked, slightly annoyed. They could have been snogging instead of wasting time packing his trunk.
The Task was dredging on with the only entertainment being the Weasley twins transfiguring themselves into various animals to the applause of those around them. Mrs. Weasley looked on in muted amusement. Harry seemed to be having an easy go of it. Draco barely registered any anxiety, fear, or pain filtering through at all. There had been a moment of intense fear but then it had quickly changed to happiness. If Draco had to hazard a guess, he must have encountered a boggart. After a while Harry seemed almost suspicious. Perhaps he was waiting for a bigger challenge.
“You didn’t truly think I was the one leaving those bruises, did you?” Another voice said and Draco looked up to see Pansy and Theo squeezing in on Draco’s other side. “So that was it? We’re officially broken up?”
Harry still had no idea what to say, he shrugged, “It’s fine now, though. I solved the Dementor issue. No worries.”
Again, I am so thankful for everyone for supporting my writing. It's been a struggle to keep up with this the last couple weeks because I caught up to what I had chronologically written previously. Thankfully I have more written, the tough part is connecting it and making sure it works. I should be okay for a bit, I just hope this story still sparks joy for you all. Stay safe, and take care of yourselves.
Father did not slow his stride as he hauled Draco down the alleyway next to the Three Broomsticks and into the small, empty street behind it, normally only used for deliveries and to house the rubbish bins.
“I know,” Draco agreed. “If you wish I could come back with your Cloak, I’m sure Hermione would get it for me.”
“Come on guys, we’ve got to keep moving, forget him,” Harry said, finally catching on. “I think I saw Ginny up here.”
Harry opened his mouth to protest and Malfoy rolled his eyes. "My mother’s maiden name is Black, he’s my second cousin."
Weasley bit his lip, abruptly standing. "I need a moment," he mumbled before striding from the ward.
Please accept my unending apologies for how late this update is! Life has been insane with the holidays and such. I have the next few chapters written now so updates will be much more on schedule but hang in there with me for Christmas, it's gonna be busy here. Thank you all times a million for sticking with me and supporting me. Love you tons!!
Draco felt something grabbing at his ankles and limbs at one point and barely kept himself from grabbing at the small blooms of pain. About 45 minutes into their pointless observation Draco felt strong hands grabbing at him. Draco’s mind whirled with what Harry could be experiencing, he assumed he had made it to the Merpeople.
In a daze, Harry piled his things into his trunk. The last couple days had passed in a blur. Between watching Crouch fire his house elf, getting his wand back, leaving the camp site, and the panic Mrs. Weasley was in once they got back, he had been barely able to think more about Malfoy.
Draco nodded throwing the fabric back at Harry’s chest, “I don’t know why that didn’t occur to me before, of course the Potter’s would have an Invisibility Cloak.”
Many heads whipped their way at the movement of the door, whispers and words reached them but not for the reason Draco had expected. The name ‘Cedric’ was whispered over and over, far more than his own.
Pansy had marched around the bed to Weasley and slapped him. Precisely the moment she had, Hermione had grabbed her opposite hand to pull her off. They all gasped in unison and Draco watched as a bundle of what looked like twigs or logs materialized on Weasley’s forearm, a swirl of blue and white coalesced onto Hermione’s, and what looked like a spark etched itself across Pansy’s.
“I didn’t know what it was, but I definitely felt it. I should have recognized the feeling. I shouldn’t have brushed it aside…”
So Harry definitely cast spells out loud. Draco was no further in his quest to figure it out than he had been before. Draco couldn’t risk brewing tonight, Pansy and Theo were sure to show up again. One thing was for sure, Draco was going to go crazy if he didn’t figure this out.
“I always thought that the ones that complete one another were platonic...” Ron said, confusion painting his face.
“You’d apologize to Hermione? You know what that would mean, right?” Harry asked, Hermione would know they were soul-mates then. Harry guessed she already suspected after last night, but this was something else entirely.
I hope their coming out was okay. I rewrote it about a million times. Seriously my notebook is filled with about 10 different attempts. Let me know your thoughts. See you later this week for the LAST chapter! *eek*
Harry groaned, “She didn’t make me stay, I was terrified for you, I had no idea what you were going through! I don’t want you to be in pain or, or fucking dying, but Jesus Christ Draco I’m upset! Hermione is my best mate! You can’t just call her awful things like that and expect me to be okay with it! You can’t curse her and expect me to be okay with it!”
Harry frowned, “Er, I guess? I never really thought about it. How can he be half-giant though? Are giants real?”
Snape seemed satisfied that Harry was still getting made fun of by someone, and moved back to his desk.
“Like I said, she had already guessed. She was mad at me for what I did, told me I was dumb a couple hundred times for ignoring you.”
“She would not,” Madam Pomfrey said curtly, appearing from her office. “She would, however, get food brought to you and your stubborn guests.”
“It has to be more complicated than that. They aren’t just going to let him stand on the side of the lake and summon whatever he’s looking for,” Hermione sighed, pursing her face in thought.
“That’s what Apparition is. There’s no spell, just focus. I’m sure loads of magic is like that, at its core.”
Harry was at a loss, he was trying to call on his wandless magic and as per usual whenever Draco wasn’t around, it wasn’t responding.
“Ooooh, well then, nevermind! Wouldn’t want to interrupt anything important with something as trivial as conversation,” Draco teased and Hermione blushed further.
Draco looked sideways away from Harry, biting his lip, “You don’t hate him though, and I’m working on my prejudices. Also, I owed him one. Who knows what could have happened to you without him tipping you off about the dragons. It wasn’t that hard, just a few letters, a couple galleons, threats of a lawsuit, all under a pseudonym, don’t worry. There’s a reason that Rita goes after the people she does, she’s counting on them not knowing their rights within the media.”
Sirius nodded to the group, winked at Draco, before leaving the room as well. Dumbledore gave Severus some instructions and he was about to leave before he stopped and looked at Draco.
“Wait a second, the Second Task is at the end of February. The water is going to be absolutely freezing!” Harry pointed out, his voice going high pitched.
“I realize now how hard this must be for you, and I’m sorry for not realizing sooner, but I can’t just let it go that you called her that. You’d call anyone with the same blood status that name without any hesitancy; she’s not special just because she’s important to me. The attitude itself is the problem here. You’ve talked to me about how disrespecting someone’s mother is this massive slight in pureblood culture and yet my mother was muggleborn.”
“That’s not what I’m worried about,” Hermione’s brow furrowed. Harry was far away with Sirius at this point, even if Lucius did find out in some crazy instance, there was no way he was getting to Harry. She was worried about what Lucius was going to do to his heir that would make Draco sick about it for weeks.
Harry made his way to their classroom, eager to get some time with Draco. He had felt an overwhelming need to be near him since the Hogsmeade trip and also hadn’t gotten a chance to tell Draco about what he and Sirius had spoken about while there. He cast the spells needed to enter the room, and entered to find Draco already seated. He was working on an essay of some sort, his hair hanging down over one of his eyes as he bent over the parchment.
“Walk with me?” He asked and she nodded, standing up. He grabbed her hand and led her back out of the Common Room to the room where Draco had comforted him the night his name was pulled from the Goblet. She followed without hesitation and waited patiently as he locked the door behind him.
“That answers one question, how did you button my shirt so quickly?” Malfoy asked, not to be distracted.
Draco always knew that Harry was a magnet for trouble and this year with the Tournament was definitely evidence of that, but he had always seen Harry as sort of indestructible regardless of his frequent Hospital Wing stays. Seeing Harry completely unresponsive in the Hospital Wing scared Draco shitless. Just imagining a life where Harry stopped to exist or a wayward curse made its way home, terrified Draco to no end.
“Draco, what’s wrong?” Greg asked and Draco held his eyes shut, waiting for the pain to pass to a manageable level.
“I’m okay, I feel completely fine. My face hurts a bit, and my body aches, but no worse than any Quidditch practice.”
Draco didn’t suspect any alarms or warnings going off from his trespass into Lucius’ study and strode over to the book shelf directly behind the desk. Draco floated the dagger and goblet down to him from the top shelf. Artifacts that had been handed down from Malfoy son to Malfoy son for as long as anyone could remember. He wished he could take the objects to his room, but he knew removing them from the study would definitely raise alarms, no matter what he tried to do to stop it, until he was judged.
“You’re saying when you’re near a Dementor, you hear your parents being bloody murdered?” Malfoy seemed to force out each word.
“Good, I’m glad. What you said wasn’t okay, but I also didn’t consider that you felt what it was like there at the end. I can’t imagine how agonizing this last task must have been.”
“What, no, what are you talking about? Draco, what are you keeping from me?” Harry asked, pulling away slightly to lock eyes with him. Draco wanted to lie, but knew it was fruitless. Harry would find out sooner or later.
Draco nodded and they retreated a few steps down the hall, murmuring quietly to each other. A few moments later they returned.
“I am proud of you,” Severus whispered and Draco had to bite the inside of his cheek not to allow the emotions he was feeling overtake him. Severus did not give praise often.
Draco looked up at Pomfrey as he said the words and she pursed her lips again tightly before nodding her head slightly and leaving the curtained area. He waited until she had retreated a few steps before promptly allowing himself to have the break down he had barely been keeping at bay. Harry was in Dreamless Sleep and wouldn’t be able to feel his emotions and be affected by them.
“Is there a Portkey in the maze, another challenge?” He burst, uncaring. Something was terribly wrong, he knew it. Harry was too far away.
“I have to thank you for everything, Parkinson. You’ve helped a bunch, it means a lot,” Harry said earnestly.
“Anyways, get out of here, go back to your ginger before he gets more suspicious than he probably already is.”
“Gillyweed. It’s a plant that makes you grow gills and shit! Doesn’t quite matter about the mechanics, the important part is we figured out how to keep you alive and able to breathe underwater for an hour.”
"No need," Draco assured, running a towel over Harry's head to try to dry the soaking wet locks. Draco assumed Harry didn't want a drying spell used on him quite yet.
Draco stared at the floor and Harry felt the distinct cut off of Draco’s emotions stop flowing through the bond.  Harry crossed the room to him, gently tilted Draco’s head upwards, forcing him to meet eyes with him.
“This wasn’t exactly how I imagined spending the night next to you would be, but I’ll take what I can get, I suppose. Beggars can’t be choosers.” Harry felt Draco bury his face in his chest for a moment, and heard him inhale deeply a couple times.
Draco had no idea how the fuck Voldemort had managed to do what he did, but he figured Fudge was too dumb to contradict him.
She finally found Ginny and Luna inside Honeydukes. The two of them were drifting between the shelves, hands tightly clasped together. Hermione noticed that the two of them, much like Draco and Harry, liked to keep constant contact with each other’s marks. Hermione wondered what it must feel like. The way the two couples engaged in it, it didn’t seem sexual, just comforting. The habit also didn’t seem to be practiced by every bonded couple. She had found herself watching Dean and Seamus as well, and they did not seem to have the obsession with touching each other’s Marks like the newer couples did. Perhaps the marvel faded with time.
Harry didn’t know how else to make it clear to his soul-mate that he needed help. If only he could summon even just the smallest shred of power to work a counter charm so he could at least get away or scream loud enough for someone to hear him. Of course, the one time that Sirius hadn’t escorted him all the way back to the Castle is when he would get jumped.
Harry laughed, “I’m just saying, just because you aren’t soul-mates, doesn’t mean you can't be with her. Who knows, maybe you are and ‘your souls aren’t ready yet’.” Harry made air-quotes and Ron cackled loudly.
"No one deserved that.” Harry said fiercely. “Besides, I know you weren't going to curse one of us."
“I’m sure if my family were to bring the idea up to the Wizengamot that we would quickly find support. We will, obviously, also have to bring to light what is to be done about the fact that Voldemort has returned,” Draco continued casually, as if it was the simplest idea in the world.
“You are wearing my tie,” Draco growled, punctuating each word as he grabbed onto the aforementioned object. Harry simply smirked at him, his teeth catching the light of the moon through the window. “You look so stunningly handsome. Green is definitely your colour. Now I hope you don’t hold my following behaviour against me.”
“As infuriating as it is, it’s quite advanced magic,” Theo commented as he picked at some eggs. He had moulted once already.
“I’ll go contact Dad, he should be able to get the ball rolling,” William said, before quickly striding from the room.
“No, don’t,” Harry said, eyes transfixed. Malfoy stared at him curiously, but slowly lowered his wand.
“Luna!” Ginny gasped, staring down at their enclosed hands before looking wildly back up at her. “Did we just bond?”
If Harry were being honest with himself, he was still reeling over what had happened the night before. He had had his first kiss (and second, third, etc.), and it had been with Draco. It had been with probably the last person he thought he would ever kiss just a few months ago. It had been with a guy. Draco had said that he was gay like it was something so simple. Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t gay. He definitely 100% liked men, obviously, but he was also definitely attracted to women. He was pretty sure he knew of a couple people at Hogwarts who didn’t just like the one gender. He was sure there was a word for it. There had to be. He’d ask Hermione the next chance he got.
Harry carefully folded his hand, matching his fingers up to the cuts, clarifying to himself how Draco had procured the injuries. Harry’s eyes came up to Draco’s, emotions that Draco couldn’t decipher swirling in his eyes and through the bond. Harry carefully cradled Draco’s hands in his own, his eyes not leaving Draco’s, and a light tingle settled over his hands where the cuts were. Draco felt the cloying feel of healing magic, and he knew without looking that his hands were healed. Just some more uncontrolled wandless magic from his soul-mate like it was nothing.
Harry was still staring at the door, if he hadn’t known better; Malfoy had seemed almost concerned about him.
“Er, I thought you knew… I felt everything last night. Our bond got stronger,” Draco said slowly, frowning at the sheer look of horror on Harry’s face.
“Have you given any thought to soul-mates?” Ron asked and Harry forced himself to school his features. He shrugged noncommittally.
“I have quite a lot of damage control to do today, I was not quite thinking things through last night. I don’t regret it. I had to know if you were okay. I’ve realized I really do not enjoy when I can’t feel your emotions. I sincerely apologize for any time I have cut you off. I will never do it again.
Hermione bumped his shoulder with hers as they made their way downstairs and gave him a knowing look.
Harry shrugged again before sighing, “We really should get back to our Common Rooms, we can’t afford to get caught.”
“Parkinson …. And Nott are welcome here. If you have a problem with them, there’s plenty of table left, move away!” Weasley piped up, the tips of his ears pink. Draco was a little impressed, to say the least.
Harry had to agree with him there. Obviously he hadn’t been in the same agony Draco had been, but he definitely hadn’t been unaffected. He just hadn’t known the pain he was feeling had been reflecting so intensely in Draco. He took a deep breath.
“You will need to become aware of the affects of your bond, you cannot let ignorance lead to anything close to the severity of what happened tonight. I will provide the literature. Now, I have paperwork to fill out, if you could stay with him until I return.”
That made much more sense than the story the Ministry had settled on. “I’m sorry Harry,” Draco whispered, feeling the pain radiating off his soul-mate.
Also I finally get to show Ron not being a complete and total ass. Just to be clear, this is not a Ron-bashing story. I love Ron. He just had a lot of growing up to do 4th year and he isn't the most likable character in the 4th book. We will see some growth. If you hate Ron, well sorry, this is still primarily Drarry, and that's what you're here for.
“See for yourself,” Draco challenged, lowering his mental shields. He was silent as Severus dove into his thoughts. Draco only allowed him to see the very last
"Yes, I am. How may I help you?" he asked for the third time as he leaned forward and smiled at her.
Harry cut him off by slapping a palm to his mouth and pushed him down. Straddling him, Harry grinned and waggled his eyebrows. “Wanna see how well you do against a seasoned Auror in a wrestling match?” He punched the air with his fists. “Come on, pretty boy.”
Draco turned to face Harry and saw that he was looking up at something. When he followed Harry's gaze and spotted what he was looking at, Draco whispered, "Mistletoe."
Potter looked up at him, his eyes glazed and his expression empty, and Draco faltered. Ever since they had returned to Hogwarts for their eighth year, Potter always wore that expression. As though he was disillusioned from everything in the world and nothing mattered anymore. It was rather heartbreaking. But mostly disturbing.
tell you is that the general suspicion regarding the accident being orchestrated by a third party is true."
"Ah, I didn't have the time, actually," Harry admitted, belatedly thinking that he still found it weird that Malfoy addressed him as
Harry rolled the pieces of parchment up and gave them to Ginny to tie to Pig's talons. Somehow, the obnoxious bird hadn't quite taken a liking to him, even after all these years. It adored Ginny, though, and seemed oddly possessive of her. He made a face at Pig when it stared at him and could've sworn it had an evil glint in its eye as it took off.
While Harry and Ginny were speaking to the distraught woman and were in the process of clearing the confusion, James and Albus had gotten into a fight because one of the older kids had accused them of getting special treatment just because they were Harry Potter's children. That had led to the involvement of more parents, and everything had spiralled pretty quickly from there.
"I don't know if I should laugh at that or not," he said with a grin, and she finally looked up from her book.
"Wait until Hermione hears about this. You'll decide to never drink again, after her lecture. If you survive it, that is." Ron rolled his eyes, but he had a fond expression on his face.
Harry was grateful for Kingsley's help, even if sometimes he went overboard with it. Harry oftentimes felt like Kingsley used him as an excuse to show people who ran the place.
Malfoy nodded and Levitated a cup of tea towards Harry. "Right, then. Before we begin with anything, I have to say this: it is completely up to you whether or not you choose for me to be your Mind Healer, considering the history we share, and I will neither recommend nor reject your choice, but simply accept whatever decision you make."
Everyone sat staring at the former Death Eater's body, stunned and unable to believe what they had just witnessed, till Robards' gruff voice echoed through the quiet moor.
his mind said even as his thoughts returned to the first time he'd laid his eyes on Mini Malfoy and the tantrum he was throwing.
"It's perfectly alright," the blond finally said in a voice that was soft and soothing, and so unlike anything he'd ever heard leave Malfoy's lips, that it sent shivers down Harry's spine and made his skin tingle. "I've instructed my secretary to reschedule all of my morning's work to after lunch."
That made Harry laugh again, and he finally said, "I don't know if she told you, but your mother saved me in the Forbidden Forest. I should've died. But she lied to Voldemort and saved my life."
"So," Ron began the moment Harry had put the glass down. "Why exactly did you think it was a good idea to get pissed on a Thursday afternoon?"
"Keep the coat; it looks good on you," Draco said, stepping away. When Harry looked like he would argue, he added, "Think of it as a Christmas present."
, Harry made a mental note as Ron Scoured the vomit and helped him to the sofa. Harry settled against the cool leather with a sigh and accepted the glass of water from Ron, revelling at the clean taste as he gulped it down.
It was a long-awaited meal with his family, and although his wife was missing, he couldn't help but feel grateful and glad for their company.
“Someone has willingly accepted you as their life partner. We have just received an official summons from the Ministry.”
He hummed a little tune as he scooped up the mash and served it onto one the plates, feeling oddly relaxed despite everything that had happened that day. Malfoy had been right; the massage and the well-deserved nap had really refreshed Harry and calmed him down, allowing him to see everything in perspective.
“I never said I wouldn’t go through with it,” Draco replied flatly. “I’m just sceptical about this mystery benefactor’s intentions for marrying a werewolf. Wouldn’t you be, after being rejected for seven years?”
About an hour later, when he had awoken with a start, lying facedown on the massage table, having fallen asleep during the course of the massage, Mr Hussain had insisted that he allow himself to relax completely and let go, leading to one of the best naps he had ever taken in his life.
He looked down at the folder, and Malfoy's hand on his, and just as he was wondering if he should pull his arm away, the blond stepped back and placed his hands behind his back. "Well, I would say we've accomplished quite a bit today, wouldn't you say? You don't have to complete the tasks to their entirety by the next session, but it would make our sessions go by a little faster if you could finish as much as possible. Although I recommend that you answer each of the questions, if you can't, we can always work on them the following session."
He gasped and turned over, falling off the bed and lying sprawled on the floor. He shuddered, eyes tearing up as his heart beat rapidly in his chest. There was scrambling, and Ginny's arms were around him, helping him up.
Harry was about to reassure Draco when his mobile phone rang. He quickly answered the call and placed the phone to his ear. "Talk to me."
A considerable amount of stumbling, swearing, drunken crying, and a very uncomfortable cab ride later, we arrive at my little two-storey townhouse.
"So you decided to offer him a promotion exactly when I decided to take a break from work," he said tiredly, trying to massage away the oncoming migraine—with no luck.
There was silence again, and Harry found himself being impressed that Camilla could hold her own against Malfoy. He'd never actually known of anybody, witch or wizard, who wasn't Narcissa Malfoy or Bellatrix Lestrange who the blond actually listened to, let alone argued with. Not that he knew all that much about Malfoy to begin with, he reasons.
"I'll be around the neighbourhood for another hour or two—gotta get some long-pending shopping done—so I'll come by just before I leave, if that's alright?" she said, writing down her name and number. She handed back the card. "Thank you so much for doing this so quickly; I really appreciate it."
"No," Harry said after such a long pause that it took Draco a few seconds to realise he was answering Draco's question. "There's no point trying to reason with Ron when he's like that. This isn't the first time he's done this. He'll be back eventually."
Harry nodded and looked down at the list. "Do you have anyone you recommend? I haven't really seen or spoken to any of these people before, and I've always been assigned a Mind Healer."
"I apologise for being late," he said to the three seated opposite Ramsey before turning and regarding the reporter with contempt. "Mr Ramsey, I see you're here, yet again making my job difficult."
"Daddy, bow me?" Lily came up to him and turned around, holding out the satin ties of her dress. He tied them together in a neat, big bow and kissed her hair when she hugged him.
"Shite," he said, raking his hands through his hair and squatting down. He hadn't meant what he'd said… he really hadn't. But he was just so
"The reason I actually came here this morning," Harry said, and then decided he didn't want to talk about his nightmare or his childhood abuse. That was a line he didn't want to cross just yet, and definitely not with Malfoy.
"Well—" his gaze drops down to my nametag before returning to my face, his smile widening, "—Draco, I was wondering if you could make me a nice bouquet of fifty red roses."
"Hi. I'm Harry Potter. I'm currently looking for a school to enrol my kids in, and I wondered if I could take a look around your place for a bit before I made a decision? I haven't been to any other schools, yet, so it would be really helpful if I could get a brief tour."
Placing the photo on the table, Harry stared at it unseeingly, barely noticing the tears falling down his face. He was too afraid to flip it over. He was too afraid to see what message was written on the back.
"No!" Neville yelled adamantly, continuing with his ministrations, a panicked expression on his face. "Let me—save him—let me—"
Potter frowned, and Draco awaited the snarky rebuttal. It never came, though, because just then Draco's least favourite pet peeves had arrived.
Harry jumped out first, followed closely by Neville and the rest, and they made their way to the small jetty in two lines. Robards pulled him aside as the men started boarding the boats.
The Herbology Professor sighed, fumbled around for a moment, seemed like he wanted to say something, and then slumped back in his seat.
"Actually," Harry said, placing the list on the desk. "I do see some merit in what Camilla suggested."
"You did?" Draco asked, taking the crumpled piece of paper and reading the name scrawled on it. "Christopher Macnair?" He looked up at Harry, his heart starting to race. "Macnair… is this the same as the Macnair I'm thinking about?"
Rabastan Lestrange's release from Azkaban has set things into motion in a direction Harry hadn't expected. Will his meeting with Neville affect the way he handles his nightmares in any way? Read on to find out.
For some reason that didn't placate him in the least. The thought of returning to an empty house did not seem appealing in any way, and Harry didn't really want to visit the Burrow again without making at least some progress with the pre-schools. Grinding his teeth, he picked up his coat and strode out the door, wondering if he should go on his weekly rounds and check on what the rest of his department was up to. Just as he decided that we would, a sharp, high-pitched ringing assaulted his senses and he swore loudly, digging into his pocket for his mobile phone.
Neville shrugged and shook his head, his eyes still wide and clear. "Cremate it," he mumbled, and Harry nodded.
Narcissa Malfoy held her son’s broken body close as she cried to the night, her sorrowful wails drowned out by the sound of howling.
Harry almost asked him if he was referring to just now or something else, but Malfoy had already brought over the tea and poured him a glass, as per usual.
"I think you are," he murmured as his son struggled some more, feeling his mind slip towards unconsciousness. Now, if only Albus would stop moving…
"'fraid not," Harry replied. He was trying to figure out where he had seen this boy, because there was something vaguely familiar about his wild curls and his striking blue eyes, but he couldn't be sure where he had met a boy who was so properly dressed and as well-mannered. "Say—Danny, is it?"
Neville stared at Harry as though he thought it was a joke, and when Harry offered him a small smile, he sat up on his knees and leaned forwards.
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed Harry off him. “I don’t partake in childish games,” he said coquettishly. Harry grumbled something that sounded like wuss, causing Draco to tackle him. He pinned Harry beneath him and smirked. “How does it feel like to be beaten by a pretty boy, oh seasoned Auror?”
"It's three, counting the flat." Harry shivered as the cold breeze nipped at his face when he stepped out. "Anyway, I'll be back before suppertime."
The last thing he needed was to trip and fall down the stairs and die in a pool of his own blood after having survived a direct Killing Curse from the greatest Dark Wizard of all time.
Harry nodded in understanding, watching his sons ride their brightly coloured tricycles. "I never thought I'd see the day when Jamie would ride a tricycle. I mean, the tantrum he threw when we told him we'd get him one three years ago. He refused
"I was just wondering," Harry said when Audrey stopped speaking, "is it possible to leave my kids here for a day or two before we decide to put them here? Just to see how they react. The last school wasn't a very pleasant experience for them, so I just want to make sure that they fit in alright before making a decision."
"Merlin, no," Harry scoffed. Malfoy laughed in an unreserved manner that surprised Harry, and he couldn't help but stare.
"Makes no sense to me," Harry said, pointing his wand at the cup and murmuring a warming spell. "Where're the kids?"
"You do that," Harry said, but she was already racing across the room, screaming her brothers' names.
Lily ran up to him just then, breaking his train of thought, and showed him a shell she'd found. He smiled as he told her it was pretty, making a mental note to ask Ginny what the hell she was up to once and for all as soon as they were home.
Neville's voice had gotten extremely quiet by the end of his little speech, and he looked exhausted. "And for the record, my healer knows nothing about this," he added, and Harry shook his head.
She flushed, apparently embarrassed by her question, and seemed flustered as she rummaged in her bag. Whatever she was looking for wasn't easily found because she seemed to go into a panic as she began pulling out one thing after the other and placed them on the desk. Harry watched her with amusement, glad for this entertaining distraction from the monotony of paperwork, and waited patiently as she exclaimed at having found whatever it was, sat in the chair, placed it in her lap, and then put everything she'd taken out back into the bag.
"Nightmares, on the other hand, are more disturbing dreams that contain emotions and experiences that have impacted the person in a more negative way, or even physical causes like poor sleeping positions. Nightmares are more common among children and affect them more strongly than they do adults, but if they continue to persist, whether among children or adults, and affect them during wakefulness, then the cause for the nightmares need to be determined, and the person may need help to overcome that negative aspect that is eating away at them. In your case, your nightmares stem may from your war trauma but could also be related to current stressful factors in your life."
She watched as he fell to the side, eyes wide, and reached out with her foot to nudge his cheek. "Disgusting," she said with a sigh.
"All aboard?" he called as he stepped into the hollow, metal interior and nodded for the anchor to be raised.
"Right, and what is that, exactly?" he asked as he breathed deeply and tried to calm his racing heart. Only Kingsley could affect him like this every single time he wanted to, and Harry
" he whined, resorting to begging and bribing as the last resort. "I'll even help clean out that old hov—Grimmauld Place. I swear. Every last visible dust particle."
Draco lay in bed, wide awake, using all his will power to keep his eyes shut and remain perfectly still. He knew Harry and a dozen other Aurors were outside his bedroom, lying in wait of Macnair, but that didn't calm his nerves too much.
"This!" she said proudly, holding out a large, blonde doll. It looked suspiciously like the ones that were all the rage in Muggle London.
"What's there to sort?" Harry asked, his voice harsh. "Ron's just too immature and petty to believe that Draco and I can be friends."
Draco nodded. "After my mother's sudden passing, I couldn't live in the Manor anymore. It was claustrophobic. I saw her everywhere. And while my father still revels in that, it drove me over the edge." He looked around, a small smile on his face. "Astoria found this house. I had just been certified as a Mind Healer and wanted to start my own practice, and she thought this was the perfect place for it." He shrugged, his smile still affectionate. "She was right."
Lisa seems to be hiding something; Harry finds a threatening note addressed to him; Buxley and Harry struggle to find the missing pieces of the puzzle by themselves, so Harry decides to call on an old friend; meanwhile, somewhere in the outskirts of London, some shady business is underway as the lead suspect shows himself.
He strode towards the front, barking instructions, and grabbing onto the railing as the boat teetered. Conjuring ropes, he, and a few other Aurors, threw them to where Robards' team was waiting, and after a lot of yelling and screaming and falling over, the boat was finally moored, and everyone was ashore.
The look in Draco's eyes was cold and unforgiving. "Why indeed," he said, as he trailed his fingers down from Harry's chin to his chest and pushed.
"Keep your arms by your sides!" Draco instructed when Scorpius waved, smiling as he watched his son disappear in a rush of green flames.
spell, slowly moving his hand in a wide arc. When he was convinced that there were no uninvited visitors in the room, he leant back against the pillows and sighed.
Draco stared slack-jawed as the person he was to marry entered the room. His mother jabbed him in the side with her elbow, and he snapped his mouth shut, swallowing down his shock.
Harry rose to his feet shakily, noting that Neville did the same out of the corner of his eyes, and cleared his throat.
"I'm sorry for breaking down like that," she whispered in a shaky voice. "It's just that after what happened today with Mother…"
Harry frowned, unsure if he was pleased that Malfoy was being humane or annoyed that his plan to irk the blond had failed.
"It's not," Neville said a little too quickly. "It's not." He sighed. "I just—it's just—I don't know. I still go visit my parents and watch them flounder around as they unsuccessfully try to grasp at reality and I just… I just wanted to see it with my own eyes. I just want it to be over, Harry, all this pain and suffering… I just want it to end."
"I'm… not sure," he admitted finally, and Malfoy nodded as though he'd reckoned as much. "Why? Do you think it means something?"
"There are so many empty seats; why're you squeezing in beside me?" Draco complained, trying to push the other man away.
Harry grimaced and whispered, "Look, I'm sorry that things turned out the way they did, but next time, maybe you can talk to me before barging in here unannounced and demand that I do as you say in front of everybody?" Her lip twitched, but he continued quickly, "And maybe you could rely on me for help, next time, as I did with you, instead of going behind my back and forcing my hand."
Camilla laughed, and the familiar, light, lilting sound allowed Harry to relax as she motioned back to where they had come from.
"Er, how are you?" Harry asked stupidly, feeling useless simply standing in Draco's living room when his son was missing.
"Although the cause for old man Barkridge's death was passed off as being natural, taking his age and prolonged bouts of illnesses into consideration, the timing of it was all too suspicious—not to mention the aide's mysterious disappearance. So, a team from my unit was assigned to secretly backtrack the lines of investigation, under the request of a certain
"That shouldn't happen," Draco murmured, tightening his grip on Harry's hand. "When I pushed you, you should have passed straight through the gateway between our worlds and landed right back in yours, exactly the way you had been before I pulled you here, having no memories of anything that had transpired here."
Harry crossed his arms, practically pouting. "Two grown-ass men lying in bed together? That's disgusting."
Harry's instant reaction was to find out if this child was an orphan. He couldn't imagine a seven-year-old fending for himself and having to go to the extent of stealing just to eat one square meal a day.
"Alright, you know what you've got to do," he said, nodding to them. "And this time, be sure to follow the bloody instructions
"It is imperative that you finish your schooling, Draco, war or otherwise." She turned back to her flower arrangement, signalling the end of the conversation.
Harry nodded. "Fair enough. Then, how about you tell Rogers that he has been promoted to be your personal assistant from this moment on?"
"Didn't see you at dinner, Malfoy," the matron said as she came over, her tone chastising but her expression kind.
"I swear, Neville, it's a good thing I have self-control or you'd have my fist in your face right now."
"It can be slightly overbearing at first," I admit, cautious. "But you clearly don't have any ill intentions, so it's not all bad."
The corner of Malfoy's mouth twitched in the semblance of a smirk before returning to the calm smile, and he said, "Yes. At the end of every session, I will be giving you a handful of tasks for you to work on, and we'll monitor your progress every session. These tasks will be based on whatever I've learnt from our meetings and what I think will help you progress. And while they
At first, Draco would go to the bakery just for an excuse to see Harry at his best, kneading and baking with so much passion that you couldn't look away. But on days the shop got too busy and Draco resented the fact that he wouldn't be able to visit the bakery, Harry would come over with something or the other for Draco and his mum to eat. He smelled like freshly-baked bread and there was always some flour in his hair or clothes. Draco loved it.
Then, just when everything was going a little too well, his mother had passed in an accident, leaving him all alone with nothing but flowers surrounding him, overwhelming him with their vibrancy and pungent fragrance, leaving him unable to look at a rose without thinking of her, lying in a pool of her own blood. He had distanced and isolated himself from everyone and everything, unable to cope with the sudden loss.
She sighed, long and deep, and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. Looking away from him, she said, "George and the kids had planned this whole thing for Angie, so he wanted me to convince her to go on a trip for her birthday so they could surprise her."
He cleared his throat and nodded, offering Malfoy a tight smile as he reached forward and put down his nearly empty cup of tea. "Yeah."
envelope, not just any old envelope, but several envelopes and paper covers and whatnot flew out of her bag and settled in a heap on the desk. She exclaimed in delight as she found was she was looking for and waved it at him.
"I would begin with small talk if this were one of our sessions, but since it's not, I'm going to get straight to it." Her eyes shimmered with uncertainty, and she said in a soft voice, "I apologise for my rather rude behaviour yesterday."
"Robards asked me to give these to you. He and the team are ready for you, Harry," she said in a clipped voice, and Harry sensed her anxiety.
Doling out a substantial amount of everything onto his plate, Harry dug in, ravenous. It didn't take him very long to finish the food and drink, and once he was satiated and calm, he stood and walked to the door. He pushed it open slowly, careful that he didn't make a sound, and peered down the hallway. There didn't seem to be anyone in sight, and he made his way down the corridor, keeping an ear out for someone.
"I heard about it from Kingsley," Arthur finally said once the two were out of earshot. "Terrible, simply terrible."
There were joyous shouts as the three siblings were reunited—Albus squished his sister in a hug until she began to screech—and they ran out to the back garden just as Molly was stepping in.
park on the road like that! Look at the mess you've caused!" she cried, waving her hand at the line of cars that were slowly coming to stop behind Ron's car—which was parked almost completely in the middle of the road—honking loudly.
They circled around the park and reached an alleyway that led back to the main street. He couldn't hear the voices anymore and decided that they were fine—for now.
“Quit,” he said, holding up the Firewhiskey. “Was just going to get some food to go with my celebratory drink.”
now, and the faster you finish up all of your—" he waved his hand, "—paperwork, the faster you can give up that uncomfortable chair of yours and get the nice, plush one. Plus, you've been covering for Gonsales for years now, so I only think it fair that he helps you this one time. "
She nodded and walked to the kitchen isle, giving him a moment to calm himself. He inhaled shakily and ran the tip of his wand over his body and clothes, cleaning himself with a simple freshening charm Hermione and Ginny had stumbled upon when trying and failing to get the kids to clean themselves.
"He looks even worse than when I went to visit him," Neville said in a low voice as they followed close behind the group of Aurors escorting Lestrange.
James nodded, making a beeline for one of the sofas, and flopped down on it. Harry tried to coax him to go sleep in his room upstairs, but he just moaned and grunted, and curled up into a ball. Harry shared a look with Hermione before Summoning a blanket. He caught it as it zoomed down the stairs and draped it over his son, who already looked to be half asleep.
Ginny laughed as her phone rang and she fumbled around with her bags as she looked for it. The second she saw who the caller was, though, the smile dropped off her face and she paled.
The room itself was more a carefully constructed and maintained garden than an interior of any sort, the flowers and plants growing around them so vivid and colourful and nothing like anything he had ever seen before. It was sublime, unearthly, and there was a subtle heaviness in the air around them, as though it were
"True." He began to pace, his mind on overdrive, unable to process possibilities and variables like he usually would have been able to. "I can't think of any logical explanation besides him stepping out and leaving the room before you spotted him."
"Look, Angie," Harry interrupted. "Ginny had quite a bit to drink last night, and if she could climb up the stairs to my study, I'm sure she could go put her phone back in her coat or whatever. I don't know why you're so worried about this, but whatever it is, don't overthink it. I'm sure it's not all that big a deal."
Angelina gave him an odd look and he swallowed, making sure to keep his smile as natural as possible. If Ginny really
"Ah, well, we've known each other since before I was Minister and you were Head Auror, and not once have you suddenly taken an entire week off before," Kingsley replied, easing into a chair. He had a glint in his eye that Harry recognised all too well.
Harry sighed and stood up, coming to stand beside his desk. His insomnia was acting up again, and he was feeling exhausted now that his adrenaline rush had passed.
They checked every room along the corridors that led to the main exhibition hall, even the locked ones, but found no trace of the boy. The large hall itself was mostly empty, save for stalls being put up by volunteers.
"You made me a promise last time he was kidnapped," she said, her voice quavering. "You promised that you would always protect him." She turned away, shaking her head. "It's my fault for believing you. It's my fault for thinking you would—"
"Better get those to Molly." She took the box from him and made her way down the stairs—but not before shooting him a look over her shoulder.
"Great, now I, myself, have high expectations for my own death. Just what I needed," Harry muttered as he stomped up to where the stupid bird was sitting on the windowsill, preening its feathers.
"Break my heart," Draco muttered again, turning away to go back inside. Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him back, caressing his cheek gently. "Draco," he said, his eyes wide and pleading. "Do you like me?"
Something flickered in her eyes, and she quickly waved her hand, laughing in a high-pitched voice. "I don't know! I was just referring to the thieves, I suppose. I really don't know who would've wanted to steal from me."
Draco hummed in thought. "Unless you're planning on marrying me for my money, I don't think I will."
Harry quickly placed an arm around the man's waist to steady him, alarmed by how slim it was, and Summoned a chair for him to sit on.
He shrugs. "From our first few interactions—or lack thereof—I thought you were standoffish and cold, almost hostile." He smiles at me, and the waning sunlight catches his face at exactly the right angle, making his eyes glitter like emeralds. "But despite me dirtying your brand new shoes and then being overbearing to compensate for the blunder, you were not only nice enough to make me a beautiful bouquet of roses but also kept me company as I wallowed in self-pity—the latter of which you had no obligation to do whatsoever."
"Of course you are; you're the Deputy Head of the DRCMC," he said. "And why does he think so?" he added when she gave him a pointed look.
Lisa shook her head, her eyes wide and teary. "Please," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Please, I don't know where he is, I swear. I'll tell you everything I know, so please help him. I can't lose Erhard, too!"
The Muggle town seemed busier than the last time he'd been there, and he had to move out of the way several times so cyclists or joggers wouldn't run into him. The sun was already setting, and it was getting colder. He rubbed his hands together and side-stepped as a group of women bustled past, talking in loud voices. Sighing to himself, Harry glanced into the window of a bakery, breathing in the pungent aroma of freshly baked biscuits and bread.
Harry walked away, leaving Draco to stare at the message over the fireplace, feeling sick to his stomach.
He holds out a brown paper bag, and I'm assaulted by the scrumptious smell of scones coming from within. I swallow down my hunger, trying not to make it obvious that I'm starving, but Harry seems to notice anyway and laughs.
"Found anything from reading between the lines?" Buxley asked as he trudged up to the desk and flopped down in a chair.
He pursed his lips and asked Buxley to hold the line as he turned to Malfoy and Camilla. "Actually, do you mind if I take a rain check on our next meeting?"
His heart jolted in his chest, and he half-turned to see Camilla. She was wearing white Healer's robes with the Antares insignia on the front pocket, and he stared at her tied hair and the clipboard under her arm before realising he'd never seen her in uniform before.
Malfoy winced, as though the proclamation had hurt him. What about it had hurt, Harry wasn't sure. Was it that being related to Sirius disgusted the blond? Or was it that this conversation brought up unpleasant memories? Or was it the fact that Harry owned the house that should've ended up belonging to the Malfoys?
Harry groaned as Albus bounced on top of him, not caring in the least for his father's fatigue or problems, and Harry finally gave in by rolling out of bed.
Harry shrugged as he picked up his teacup, finished his tea, and replaced the cup on its saucer. "I'll probably just toss it back in the house, where it belongs, with all the other useless stuff collected over the years," he lied easily.
Harry laughed as she tossed her hair over her shoulder pretentiously and decided that yes, it definitely would do the wizarding world good to have Hermione Granger-Weasley in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
"Hi," she whispered back, smiling. "I'm really drunk," she added, biting her lip to stifle a giggle.
He took a moment to observe the boy and get his thoughts straight. The child was definitely around seven or eight years old, and Harry's suspicions were confirmed as he watched him scarf down the bread. His appearance was even worse on second glance: he was far too thin and pale, he wore only a single layer on a cold, November's evening, and his sandals were falling apart and were too small for his feet.
"Doesn't matter. Go talk to Hermione if you need help with permissions, and make sure," Harry paused, giving the other man a pointed look, "that the higher-ups know
Mrs Buxley smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling, unshed tears swimming in them, and rose to her feet. "Excuse me, I have to go…call the nurse," she said, making her way to the door.
"No, I don't," he snapped, his irritation at its peak. He rubbed his temples as he felt the headache settle there and sighed. "I don't understand why you have to stay three extra days once your work is done, so can you please explain it to me?"
He couldn't hear anything that was being said thanks to the Imperturbable Charm that had been placed on the barrier separating him from the Aurors milling around his clinic. He wasn't an expert in lip-reading either, so he couldn't exactly decipher if things were bad or not, except from Harry's physical reactions.
Harry and Neville nodded as Robards' face glared at them from the other side of the phone's screen. The older wizard grunted, shaking his head. "You lot can't stay out of trouble for one minute, can you?"
Harry snapped the book shut and strode out of the office, his heart racing. If the message was for him, then the perpetrator's target was him, and the abducted victims were probably their way of forcing Harry to take on the case. If so, what was it that they wanted?
"I thought you'd finished up your week's worth of work," she said as she Levitated three piles to the file cabinet.
"So how come Ron only got five tickets?" Harry asked since he'd been wondering about that for a while.
"What, again?" Harry asked as he perched on a stool by the kitchen counter. "Why do kids like playing with dirt so much?" he asked. It was a question they would never find a satisfactory answer to, he knew. "Did they pull out the flowers again?"
He pursed his lips at that, but couldn't disagree. This wasn't the first time that he'd been left out of a surprise, after all, and he was sure Ron hadn't a clue about it either.
Harry stumbled out of the fireplace and stood staring at nothing for a long moment until the nausea passed and the throbbing in his temples eased.
"Yes, sweetheart, we are," she said gently, brushing the hair out of his eyes and kissing his forehead.
When Zabini only looked away and Malfoy focused on comforting his ex-wife, all three ignoring the reporter, Harry turned back to the man and said, "Looks like you overstayed your welcome to me."
"That we do," I concede, stretching my legs out and tilting my head back as I decide that I'm going to take a leap of faith and let myself be moved by the unabashed joy Harry exudes.
"I suppose it makes it easier since I haven't signed an official form naming her my healer," Harry said.
"Papers are due in an hour, remember?" Harry reminded her, and Hermione gasped, her eyes becoming comically round. "I'll see you for a late lunch!" he called after her as she dashed down the corridor, nearly upsetting one of the large potted plants as she zoomed around a corner.
He plodded out of the bathroom and lumbered down the stairs, stifling a yawn and groaning. He was as exhausted now as he usually was after a particularly strenuous mission.
Padma's jaw was set, and Harry could see the veins popping along her forehead even from afar. After a long moment of deliberation, she said, "Fine. But only if you allow us to conduct a thorough investigation—"
Kingsley nodded sadly. "That and the fact that he played a pivotal role in ending the war as well as being a part of the Auror Department until very recently."
"You can't arrest me!" Ramsey exclaimed, slapping away the Auror's hands as they neared him. "I know the way the law works; this is foul play!"
Harry chuckled and nuzzled Albus's hair, wrapping his arms around him. "How can I wake up when I've got such a cute cuddle buddy?"
"I came because I was worried," she says without the slightest hint of concern as she looks around the still-empty room. "But I'm mostly here because your father asked a favour of me."
"Where'd you learn that word, Lily?" Harry asked as he squatted down and pressed his palms against the kids' foreheads. "Well, looks like you don't have a fever anymore."
The corners of her eyes crinkled as she patted his arm and nodded. "You take good care of them, Harry."
managed to react the way he expected him to. "I know, but we've agreed to be there two hours early, just like you wanted, so I hardly think there's a need for you to—"
The first thing he did when he opened his eyes was groan, turning to his side and fumbling for the bottle of water he'd managed to Summon before he'd gotten pissed out of his mind. Splashing some water on to his face, he gulped the rest down, revelling at the clean, sweet taste that filled his mouth.
Her eyes looked suspiciously moist, and he groaned internally. “Mother, please. You can trust that I will meet with this person and be on my best behaviour—even if they turn out to be a sadistic maniac who wants to experiment on werewolves.”
"Right, guys, hey," he said, clapping his hands together and drawing everyone's attention to him. "Since you both are here, what say we go out and get some lunch?"
He wanted to go up to the boy and tell him that it was alright and that things would get better, but Harry, of all people, knew how dangerous lying about something like that was. He watched the boy for a moment longer and then turned away. He wanted to help this boy. No, even if he couldn't help, he wanted to know about the child's situation. First and foremost, he wanted to make sure that the boy wouldn't have to steal again. One wrong decision was all it would take for the blond to go down the wrong path. The greatest and most feared wizard of all time was the perfect example for that.
"They're still giving you trouble for being Head Auror," Neville said, more than asked, and Harry had to keep himself from groaning out loud.
"That's too bad. But Ginny'll be coming back soon, anyway, and besides, I don't think the boys would've even missed their mum all the much in all the excitement."
"Do you really want to do this? I mean, I'm not complaining or anything, obviously not, it's just—" Hermione began.
"Bye, Harry. I love you," Ginny was saying as Harry pulled the phone away from his ear and shoved it in his pocket.
"Yeah," Ron scoffed as he stood up and made his way to the kitchen. "At least now it's just the four of them. Yesterday it was all five, and then Lily fell sick, so every time they screamed, she'd start crying. I tried contacting both you and Hermione, but both your phones were out of reach and neither of you seem to have received my letters, so I assumed things were hectic and decided to do whatever I could."
"I—no—I mean—Harry," he stammered, fumbling with his own name, words forgotten in the wake of the beautiful being before him.
replacing you. Rogers is still under my supervision. He's only going to make a move on anything once I give him permission to do so. And as soon as you're back,
"Hullo," Harry said with a smile as he looked down at the messy mop of golden curls under a lopsided hat and the sparkling blue eyes. The boy's overcoat seemed to be a size too large for him, but it may have also been because he was on the skinnier side.
Buxley threw his hands up and strode out of the room, grumbling under his breath. Harry nodded to the rest of his men. "Wrap it up. We're moving this investigation back to HQ."
I stare at the empty space in front of me, stunned, but for the first time in a very long time, instead of being left with a sense of loneliness, I'm left feeling a sense of nervous anticipation.
She paused as the large hallway branched into smaller ones. Flashing Harry a small smile, Camilla continued, "Primary colours are for the older offices and secondary colours for the newer ones. We also have tertiary colours, and black and white, for other services." They continued down the same hallway. "But while reinforcing and strengthening the foundation, we realised that we didn't have the funds required to continue construction on the second floor. So Draco thought of something else—he'd invested in the cross-technology venture from several years ago, and offered to let them use the second floor for their research if they funded the construction of it."
Harry leaned forward in his seat and laid his arms on the table, giving Neville a long, searching look. "What happened?"
It was addressed to him and not to his alias, and requested him to go to Antares at the earliest in order to clarify and coordinate the necessary details regarding his consultation with them. He glanced at the bottom of the letter and was surprised to see that the letter was signed by
Harry nodded and rose to his feet. He wanted to go home right away and get down to business, but he knew it wouldn't be possible until later that night, after the kids were asleep, so he decided to exercise his willpower to prevent him from taking a peek inside the folder. As though able to read his mind, Malfoy gave him a knowing smile but didn't say anything.
Harry nodded, unfocusing his gaze as he stared at Malfoy. He felt as though a warm haze was surrounding him, and he never wanted to get out of its gentle caress. When he refocused his gaze, Malfoy was smiling. His usually grey eyes were sparkling silver, and there was a kind of gentleness to his smile that made Harry wonder how many women he had swept off their feet with it.
"But it seems it's true," he added, clapping Neville on the shoulder. "Don't be a stranger, Neville," he said seriously.
Harry snorted at that though. Had he not personally witnessed this new and improved version of Malfoy, he would never have sympathised with the man and gone so far as to humiliate himself in order to help the man escape from a sticky situation.
"Or you could just use that cleaning charm on us and no one would be the wiser," Harry said around a piece of tart.
"You don't know that," Harry said, holding Draco's gaze. "The book and the note had been for me—this one may also be for me."
"Been having a tough week at the office," he murmured as he sipped the scalding liquid, revelling at the burn in his throat.
The receptionist nodded, holding the phone out to him. He took the device and placed it on the desk gingerly, staring at it with fascination. He'd heard about the success of the Ministerial Department for Research and Experimentation with regards to discovering a method where they could cross Muggle technology with magical devices without going haywire. Nobody had believed that it was possible, but considering the extent to which both Muggles, as well as magical folk, had progressed in the field of science and technology, it had become a possibility sooner than later.
Harry turned to see Ginny and the kids dancing around in a circle and watched them for a long moment, his mind whirring, but when Lily called to him, he grinned and joined in. So had he really just been paranoid about the whole thing? Had this surprise been what Ginny and Hermione had been hiding from him all along? There were still things Ginny had to explain, like why she'd lied about the tickets or why she hadn't just come clean to Harry about everything, but that was a matter for later, he decided, because he'd finally gotten what he'd wanted—all of his family together. Maybe this trip wasn't a complete waste after all.
He raised his eyebrows. "To work for the DMLE, I presumed," he answered, to which she waved her hand and rolled her eyes.
"Hah!" Ramsey exclaimed. "Unfortunately for you, I am a welcomed guest here! Isn't that right, Mr Zabini?"
He grimaced, feeling chastised. "You're right. I'm sorry. I should've handled it with more tact. I guess I was just annoyed that they simply waltzed in here without permission and behaved like they owned the place."
insisted on letting it remain in our house, and the stress of it all led to him dying from heart failure."
The Auror nodded once and hurried away. Harry strode forward and stood in front of the group that consisted of his men and Erhard. "Padma," he said, a sceptical smile on his face and his arms behind his back. "This is a surprise."
Starting to panic, he decided that it would be best to go to someone who could help him. The first person that came to mind was Camilla, and, taking in a deep breath, he focused on the image of a large, floating green plus sign and crisscrossing corridors as he spun on the spot.
"Oh, you know how it is. Work, work, work." She waved a hand but didn't seem like she was complaining. She turned to him and smiled. "What about you? I heard Ginny's covering the tournament."
Harry narrated the events that had transpired in his dream, careful to leave out the details that could upset the blond, then remembered that Draco could read his mind when the latter's face coloured in anger. Draco looked away, a hand flying to cover his face, and Harry was by his side in an instant, knowing what that meant and wanting to comfort the blond.
Harry seemed to consider Draco's proposition for a long moment before relenting with a sigh. "Alright. But you have to stay within my line of sight at all times."
Malfoy studied Harry for a moment. "That would depend entirely on the nature of what you intend to tell me."
Draco smiled, but this time, instead of causing Harry to go into a frenzy of happiness, his heart ached and he felt tears fill his eyes, his chest tightening and his jaw clenching in pain. "Not anymore." Draco pushed Harry, his fingertips barely brushing Harry's chest, but Harry could already feel himself falling. "You are an odd human, Harry Potter," Draco was saying. "But I'm glad to have stumbled upon you. May we meet again."
Draco stepped out of the Floo, still smiling about his conversation with his son, when Astoria walked up to him with a frown. His smile growing tight, he started to greet her when she cut him off.
"Sounds like you had a good day," Malfoy said, his smile so genuine that Harry felt moved. "Good, good. And how about your wife? Have you spoken to her after…" he trailed off, making a vague motion with his hand, and Harry laughed nervously.
He walked up to where Ginny was trying to keep a rather large banner hanging in mid-air and held up one end to keep it steady.
Harry watched as Zabini squatted beside the armchair that Astoria had fallen asleep in, with her head resting on the armrest. He was stroking her hair with a loving smile on his face, and the sight disgruntled Harry. He pitied Draco, who had to witness his supposed best friend and ex-wife get together.
"Alright you guys, come on, give Daddy a break," Ginny said as she pulled James off from Harry's shoulders.
I'm somewhat taken aback at having been called out in such a direct manner and can't think of anything else to do but acknowledge the situation.
"While dreams and nightmares are essentially figments of our subconscious minds," Malfoy began in the same professional tone of voice, "dreams are mostly disjointed images and scenes created from emotions we have felt and things we have experienced previously. Not all dreams have much significance to a person's routine, daily life as they occur normally during the REM cycle whether the person is aware of it or not. Most often than not, many people don't remember their dreams, but for light sleepers or people who sleep restlessly, or if one were to awaken while they were dreaming, they may momentarily retain the memory of their dream.
"Oh, we're doing wonderfully! Fleur's been making a round trip to all the siblings' houses now that they're back from France, and Dominque's been dragging us all down to Diagon every second day to get some shopping done for when she starts school next year." Audrey rolled her eyes. "It's been driving Fleur mad—though I find Nicki's excitement rather endearing. Molly and Louis have started to make a list, too, believe it or not. And they've been hounding us to buy them supplies even though we keep telling them they've still got over two years to go before they start at Hogwarts. But, really, look at me, babbling on and on."
He scrambled to a stop as the truck picked up speed, coming directly at him, and he only had a moment's time to jump out of the way before it zoomed past. He crashed into a pile of boxes that had been pushed up against one of the cement columns, hitting the back of his head against something hard and groaning as his body convulsed in pain.
I roll my eyes as she exits the shop, and although I'm grateful for the peace and quiet, I can't help but swallow down the lump of loneliness that settles in my throat.
The blond shrugged a shoulder. "I suppose he's not going to be too pleased when I tell him that he's going to have to change Camilla's name on the place cards to yours, but it should be alright."
"They're back from France, are they?" Neville asked, waving back to a group of Aurors who were standing a little way off.
"Your friends were looking for you," he said, holding out the textbook Harry had asked for previously.
Harry wasn't sure what she was talking about, but he still laughed breathlessly, feeling exhausted, and ran his hands down his face. Sighing, he shook his head and said, "You're right. I don't think I could continue with you as my Healer."
"Who are you and what have you done with Hermione?" Harry laughed as she gave him a wide, triumphant grin.
," Albus finally said, pointing a finger towards the back garden, and Lily ran to the kitchen door and peered out.
"Right, then," Malfoy said as they returned to his office and took their respective seats. "That was a rather pleasant stroll, wasn't it?" He smoothed down his robes and checked the clock before saying, "We have a little more time left in our session. Would you like to tell me about what you have planned for tomorrow?"
It still baffled Draco that befriending Harry had been so… simple. Although their personalities and interests differed quite a bit, their relationship so far was surprisingly easy and effortless. And Draco somewhat understood what Harry meant when he said he could relax around the other. Considering they had been two of the people tormented most by Voldemort, there was this sense of mutual understanding and acceptance that neither really had to talk about to get. It really was like they had succeeded in putting the past behind them and were steadily walking towards a future where a rejected handshake, years of bitterness, and a manic Dark Lord didn't matter as much as the fact that they could walk alongside like they were just then and just… be.
Swearing under his breath, he listened intently, hearing a soft, scratching sound. He debated whether to go after the intruder or leave them be until he went and retrieved his wand and, after a minute of going back and forth, decided the latter was the better choice. A sharp rapping sound came from the living room as he slowly stepped backwards, but before he could turn and run up the stairs, an undeniably familiar squawk filled the quiet house.
Swearing under his breath, he wondered if he should go down to the reception and ask when a familiar voice addressed him from behind.
"Hi, Ginny," Draco said, not having the energy to rebuke the awful nickname she'd given them the last time they saw her, and moved out of the way before the drunk ginger could bear-hug him too.
"Miss Barkridge," Harry managed in a choked voice as he tried to control his laughter. "Miss Barkridge, if I may."
Taking in a deep breath, Harry tried to calm his racing heart, and, clutching his wand tightly, lumbered down. It seemed like he would have to put up Muffling Charms on the bedroom door again, that night.
It was as though his nightmare had never happened. It was as though nobody had been in that room at all, the previous night.
"None, sir," the man said, a confused expression on his face. "Which is very strange. The thief stole some ratty old blueprint, discarded its envelope, and left everything else untouched? Especially in a suite like this?" He motioned to the extravagant chandelier hanging from the ceiling and the paintings around the room. "That's doesn't add up."
It didn't make sense. He had known that there was something she was worrying about and that she didn't seem too excited about the trip, rather suddenly, too, since she was the one who'd chosen the place and the hotel and everything, but it didn't make sense.
happen," Harry said as he picked up the sheet on which he'd circled Hertzfeld's name and held it out to the other man. "I think I may just have cracked this case wide open."
There was some sort of commotion behind Harry just then, and Draco peered over the other man's shoulder. Harry followed his gaze and turned around, and they watched as Lee and a few other Aurors rushed away from the wall they had been examining.
"When's Mummy coming back?" Albus asked as Harry finished freshening up and picked up his glasses from the nightstand.
"Sorry about coming unannounced," Harry said as Audrey motioned back down the way she'd come. "I hope I didn't cause any inconvenience."
Draco stepped back, a pensive expression on his face as he moved back to his vials and herbs. Harry tried to tap into the blond's thoughts again but failed, and wondered if it was just something accidental that had occurred due to the intensity of emotions in that moment.
"Looks like it's poisonous," Draco said, pressing his hand against the barrier. "It's not safe for them to inhale too much of it!"
"This is…" Neville shook his head, having gone completely pale, and they watched as the Aurors gingerly helped Lestrange to his feet, exchanging looks of confusion, their disconcert clear in their expressions.
"Good. I'm glad you acknowledge your actions and are willing to change them," Draco said, patting the boy's back.
"Well, I don't usually go around broadcasting the fact that I drink potions to put myself to sleep…" Harry admitted sheepishly.
He stared at his son's head and sighed. Well, this was what he got for not spending enough time with his kids.
The blond nodded. "I suppose that makes sense. Especially if it's something that's become a habit, you do it without even realising it and never think twice about whether or not it's actually working. The process of immunisation towards medication is very slow and gradual, which is why you wouldn't have noticed its ineffectiveness, since it happened over a long period of time. It's not something sudden that you can instantly take note of due to a drastic change."
Malfoy had a solemn expression on his face as he said, "I was sure my nose was broken and needed to be reshaped because of how hard she hit me."
"Well, I've been here longer than any other human you've brought here and I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?"
Molly called something back that Harry didn't catch, and Hermione nodded as she turned towards him, nose scrunched up in distaste. "They're playing in the mud."
"Yeah. The kids want to take the train since neither Lily nor Al have ever been on one, so I plan to leave at noon. We should reach just before the match ends."
"As if Ginny needs an excuse to get pissed out of her mind on a Friday night," Hermione said dryly as she appeared from the kitchen. Putting down a platter of assorted snacks, she turned to hug Harry with a smile and waved at Draco. "I'm really glad you came," she said, hugging him too. "I needed some intelligent company, considering tonight's lineup."
she'd spoken to Robards. He mentally berated himself for telling her to find out about Lestrange's release some other way.
Neville shook his head. "I even wrote it all down, just in case." He scratched his chin awkwardly, and Harry couldn't help but grin.
"Still can't believe George finally succeeded in persuading old man Zonko to sell him the shop after all these years," Harry said as they made their way downstairs.
"Mr Potter?" Malfoy calling his name snapped him out of his reverie, and Harry slowly forced his eyes open. The blond was holding Harry's glasses out for him, and he took them, placing them on the bridge of his nose as he inhaled deeply.
The vase itself was quite spectacular in a weird, modern-art sort of way; it was tall, with a long, narrow neck that opened out into a flat mouth. The handles curved up from the broad disc of the mouth and curled close to the neck, re-joining the vase where the neck widened out to a rather disproportionate body. The body curved gently to form a narrow base, from the centre of which protruded a dewdrop-shaped gem of some sort. Around the gem, creating a sort of cage-like structure, was an intricately carved support that seemed to be made of some sort of metal, from the way it was drawn. The design of the support matched the design on the handles, and there seemed to be a picture painted along the neck and body of the vase.
"Yes, you are. Look, I don't keep pushing you about your cases, do I? So why is it that you're suddenly so interested in what work I'm doing?"
“Turn to page four,” Draco said, raising his bottle of Firewhiskey. “There’s an interesting article about a wild dog attacking some innocent children.”
The memories were still fresh, and he knew what he had felt then, but as they filtered through his mind now, it was like watching a montage of moments from someone else's life. They no longer evoked any of the happiness, contentment, gratitude, affection, or even sadness, that they should have.
She had just detangled herself from a low-hanging vine when she spotted someone hunched over a gnarled root. Without hesitating, she shot a hex towards the man. He rolled away with a  pained shout, revealing the body sprawled across the ground. Her blood ran cold as the boy’s platinum hair shone in the pale moonlight that filtered down through the gaps between the leaves.
"Liz, this is Buxley, and he's going to listen to everything you have to say and then report back to me."
"It was very safe. I basically had a whole platoon escort me to and fro. It was rather stressful, to be honest."
He had his head in his hands from the recent news of Macnair's unexpected death, knowing the media was going to give them flak for poor vigilance, when the door was thrown open and Draco came bursting in.
that bad," Harry laughed as Albus asked Ginny to bring his tricycle down so he and James could ride them behind the house.
They walked for a little longer, their conversations never lasting more than a few sentences before lapsing into a comfortable silence, but it still made Harry feel oddly comforted. For some reason, he liked the idea of being friends with the Malfoy beside him. He was an entirely different person, the sort of person Harry got along with very well, and Harry felt as though he had to keep reminding himself that the blond on his left was the same person who had made his life a living hell for most of his teenage years. But, somehow, the comparisons never got very far. It seemed as though it no longer mattered to Harry that Draco Malfoy, the pleasant Mind Healer, had once been his nemesis, whom he had despised vehemently.
"That means that I can't say anymore than I already have, and if you really want my advice, I suggest you shut this case down immediately and wipe your hands clean of it."
"It's always been their dream, y'know." Ron shook his head, a wry smile on his face. "Fred must be throwing a party and wreaking havoc wherever he is."
"Boss?" Buxley's voice called as the door was slowly pushed open, effectively ending the moment of solitude. Harry turned to Hermione, noticed she'd fallen sleep, and pressing his lips to her hair, carefully extricated his arm from her grasp.
"It was great." Harry nodded. "There wasn't too much work today so I could leave at lunchtime. I took the kids to Diagon and finally deposited the vase in Gringotts. So relieved now that that's out of my hair. Then I visited Ron at the shop—he helps run Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes—and he's looking after my kids until I'm done here."
"What time is it?" he asked groggily, too lazy to find his watch, and Albus checked his naked wrist.
Harry turned away from them and glanced at the desk, reading all the different awards displayed on it. At the far side, in a small, silver frame, was a picture of Malfoy's son, and as he eyed the awards and thought back to the last time he'd been there, Harry realised that Camilla was right. Although the history they shared was far worse, maybe he
Harry cleared his throat and forced himself out of his daze. "Did you increase that lavender scent earlier?" he asked, motioning vaguely.
Lily placed her hands on the edge of the table and got on her tiptoes, eyeing the bundle curiously. "What is it?" she asked, fidgeting when he didn't seem like he would open it anytime soon.
"Why, thank you, Hermione, that's exactly what I needed to hear right now," Harry grumbled as she fell into step beside him.
Padma smiled and stepped close, pulling him into a quick hug. But before she pulled away, she brought her lips very close to his ear, as though she was kissing him on the cheek, and whispered, "If you
"Hi," he says in a cheery tone of voice. "I'm Harry, and I manage the bakery a couple blocks from here."
"And why should I believe that you have information that even the German special forces haven't been able to get their hands on?" Padma demanded.
Harry's watch started to beep just then, and he realised that he had to leave then if he wanted to grab a quick lunch before he met Lisa. "I'm sorry, but it seems I've run out of time. Maybe we can both take some time to think about this and you can get back to me?"
"You do that," Harry replied, clapping the wizard on the shoulder. "And let me know if your boys find anything useful from Hermione's books."
"My apologies," he said breathlessly as he adjusted his dishevelled clothes and hair. "My son was throwing a tantrum and refused to go to his pre-school without seeing me, so my wife had to bring him here before she left for work. And once he saw me, he refused to leave."
Harry looked up at the earnest expression on Neville's face and then swallowed thickly, taking another gulp of the Firewhiskey. "
Hermione nodded, beaming, and Harry smiled at her. "Thanks a ton, 'Mione. You really helped us out."
In an attempt to prove a point, he hefted Draco up and rose to his feet shakily. "Where's his bedroom?" Harry asked Zabini, whose eyebrows were raised so high in surprise that they were almost off his forehead, and the latter pointed in the direction of the room. "Thanks."
Ginny had gotten paranoid about it because Rose had apparently lost all of hers and Albus still hadn't lost all of his. So Hermione had spoken to her dad and Ginny'd taken Albus to see Mr Granger the second he had stepped out of the bath.
Sighing, he called for a waiter and ordered a cup of black coffee. The girl who'd served him before arrived with his order five minutes later, shooting him an odd look as she replaced the empty cup on the table with the full one. He thanked her, and she bustled away, greeting the customer who had just walked in. Picking up his coffee, Harry eyed the overcast sky from his seat by the window and wondered if it would start raining again. He had been soaked by the time he had found the café half an hour earlier.
Harry swallowed, the weight in his chest shifting to form a knot in his stomach. Ron continued before Harry could think of something to say. "And so can Ginny. You've been together for ages; give her the benefit of the doubt, mate."
She looked at him with a sort of sad expression in her eyes, and he felt guilt well up in him. In all honesty, he
"They are, actually," Hermione said, and Harry threw her a look. "Having a gala of a time, I mean," she continued quickly. "But not at your expense."
"I see," Harry began, and Malfoy sat back, the same thoughtful expression on his face, but Harry continued. "But I don't suppose we could have this conversation off the record?"Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and Harry explained what he meant. "I can understand what you're saying since we have to follow protocol while questioning witnesses, too, but since I haven't signed any forms stating Camilla is officially my Healer, this can still be considered as playing within the rules, yes?"
Shaking his head from the tangent he'd gone off on, he looked back at Draco, truly appreciating the fact that the man was still sitting before him and willing to engage with him, even having rescheduled his other appointments to ensure that Harry was alright. Perhaps Malfoy had been more than slightly concerned by Harry's appearance that early, in his nightclothes, looking the way he did. And, right now, Malfoy was a Mind Healer willing to help Harry with his trauma, and Harry was an individual willing to trust that Malfoy would be able to put an end to his prolonged suffering.
"I wasn't finished with my explanation yet," the other wizard replied impatiently. "It is possible to manipulate the direction of the trace when someone is in the Floo as they essentially travel through vacuum to get to their destination. But this is a highly dangerous task, and if done wrong, can kill the traveler."
"I am, too, actually," Harry said. "I had to leave in the middle of handling a case, so I would appreciate if we could skip the formalities and get right down to the crux of the matter."
"Neville, listen to me," he said quietly as he gripped his friend by the shoulder. "You said you wanted to speak with him, yeah?"
Buxley scoffed as he pocketed the book. "The girl apologised to me, so I took the opportunity to get her talking."
Harry nodded, scratching his ear and looking sheepish. "I feel bad for having to kick you out of your own house, but the messages may be slightly… you know…"
that which others longed to see. And this heartache and fear left him always wary and on-edge, unable to focus on anything but the flower arrangements he could lose himself in—the fragrance he could drown himself in.
Draco blinked. It took him a moment to process what he had just heard, and he burst out laughing, forgetting all about needing to put on the snob front. Potter watched him in amusement.
I swallow down the guilt and don a smile as Harry looks up at me and pats the blanket. As I settle down, Harry starts to unpack what I had assumed would be a simple meal but turned out to be a full-fledged, three-course dinner.
out of the whole year, and you behave as though the world is ending. What about all the times you're away and I've had to single-handedly deal with everything? And I'm with the kids
"It's good to see you in high spirits, Malfoy," Potter said with a resigned smile before walking away, leaving Draco feeling like
Harry smiled and motioned for Lisa to come in as he put away the file containing information on Hertzfeld and the case. "How're you doing?" he asked her once she was seated.
" I cut myself off when I turn around to see a forlorn Harry slink into the shop, looking like he had witnessed the end of the world.
"Of course." Harry carefully made his way to the top, making sure to avoid the especially creaky stairs.
"Stop bullying Pig," came Ginny's instant retort, and he rolled his eyes. "If you don't like him, get an owl of your own."
Harry nodded, staring at his hands. "Even I wouldn't have been able to forgive him, if I were in Neville's place. I may have just said it, just for my own peace of mind and because it may have been the right thing to say, but I never would've forgiven him
Molly smiled at him and patted his knee. "You've gotten wise, Harry." He laughed at that as Lily crawled into his lap with her doll and mumbled something to him.
There was a short silence followed by hurried shouts and excited shrieks, and lots of thudding and clattering. Sighing, he trudged up the stairs and walked into Albus' room.
"Yes—I mean, only if you want to tell me," he replied, leaning back and attempting to be polite. He somehow felt the need to treat the man before him like he would treat the Queen.
Harry chuckled and came around the desk. He picked up his coat and slipped it on as he nodded to the other man. "Well, wish me luck."
Lisanna finally glanced up at him, and he made his smile look as reassuring as possible. He waited patiently as she fiddled with her skirt, still hesitant. She seemed to be having a difficult time speaking, which came as a surprise to him, considering she was the one who had demanded that he help her, and now that he actually wanted to, she was unwilling to talk.
Exhausted as he was from his lack of sleep and all the recent stress, he managed to lower the banner to the ground while muttering in complaint, sat back, and let his eyes slip closed.
"Of course. What can I do for you, Miss Barkridge?" He sat back in his seat and pushed the case file to the side as he studied her.
He snorted at that, and there was another brief silence before he said, "I still think this is the right school. I know you're going to want to take a look for yourself, but I assure you that we won't regret it."
the primary suspect," Harry replied, consciously making sure to keep the bite out of his voice. "But, as of recently, the case has been solved, Agent Patil," he continued. "And I have enough evidence to waive the allegations against Mr Hertzfeld. Do
Albus sidled up to Harry and whispered, "Auntie Fleur is scary sometimes." Harry grinned as he patted his son's head, agreeing wholeheartedly.
"Why would I lie about something like that?" Astoria said, an edge to her voice as she peered down the hallway that was the sole exit out of the room.
Harry glanced towards where Ginny was laughing at something George was saying. He caught her eye, and when she smiled, he looked away, as though he was guilty of knowing something he shouldn't have known. He turned to Angelina and gave her a small smile.
Harry winced at what could've been an awkward faux pas. "Right. Should keep that in mind. Anyway, where are they?"
"Right… well, it's already been a couple weeks since we pulled them out, and Ginny and I've been really busy of late, so we haven't gotten around to looking for schools, yet. So I was wondering if you had any suggestions or recommendations."
"Anything baked by you is my favourite," Draco muttered as he picked up the pasty and took a big bite, humming in contentment. "Despite how annoying you are, I begrudgingly admit that you're still the best baker in town."
He narrowed his eyes, trying to discern where the silky voice was coming from, when he felt something soft caress his aching body and pull him backwards ever so gently.
"A message for me, obviously," Harry said, looking down at his name in the title of the book, which had been underscored several times using a sharp object. "And Mr Malfoy? Where is he?"
Padma stared at her, the disbelief clear on her face, and even Harry himself was eyeing the girl with amazement. Was this the same girl who had broken down in tears less than twenty minutes ago?
Demitri stopped short as he spotted the two, the scroll in his hands clattering to the ground. "Prince Draco!" he admonished, his voice high-pitched in alarm. "You cannot be doing this!"
Harry watched as the cameras flashed away, a pale-faced Draco standing before the fireplace his son had disappeared in, the bloody message above his head glistening. Draco looked overwhelmed, nauseous, even, after his powerfully worded warning taunting Macnair to come after him, and Harry was glad the interview was over. As the reporters thanked the blond and began to clear out, Harry walked up to Draco, who was standing stockstill, his eyes wide and unblinking.
"Who's the smarter one, now, eh?" He waggled his eyebrows, and he could swear that Pig rolled its eyes. The owl turned towards the snacks and Harry shrugged.
"Because nobody needs to know I live where I work," Draco replied for the hundredth time, wondering why he even needed to explain himself to his adolescent son.
Harry laughed, feeling the weight in his chest slowly settle. "Not too much. I reckon that's not too good, either."
Head Auror, and as Head of the Auror department, I would think it my duty to make sure that one of Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters' release and transfer happens seamlessly and according to protocol. I would rather be there than not. The last thing we need is a Death Eater on the loose."
Harry frowned in disbelief but was distracted as Draco pushed away the chairs to reveal an ornate symbol carved into the marble. It looked familiar enough, but Harry couldn't quite place it.
"We can debate the extent of your foolishness once we're alive and safe," Harry said, stepping away but not letting go of Draco's hand. "Alright. Now do what you need to do."
"I came straight from Diagon, so I couldn't use the Floo," Harry replied as he took off his coat and draped it along the back of his usual armchair.
dangerous, and I don't think the force would be the same without Jon. He's helped me on countless occasions, and for that, I'll be forever grateful."
"I heard that!" she calls as she pulls open the front door, causing the doorbell to chime. "And I'll be dropping by again next week. To buy a bouquet, of course!"
Harry waved and Apparated, arriving just within the threshold of Antares. He knew Malfoy had left the Floo open for him, but he didn't have time to go home, so he had decided to take the long way there. Pressing his hair down over his forehead so it hid his scar, he pulled the collar of his coat higher and made his way to the lifts. He didn't get recognised all that much anymore, but it had become a habit. There weren't as many people as usual, and as he stepped off on the second floor, he breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of the empty hallways.
As he had expected, she said in a voice that was no more than a whisper, "My parents fought and died in the first Wizarding War, and my brothers in the second."
"No, please," Harry replied, unable to tolerate it anymore. "Your worries aren't baseless at all. The work we do
The next few pictures were more of the same—him with different groups of people: some students, some from the Order, some professors, some Aurors, some younger students. There was one picture of him and McGonagall, and he couldn't help but smile at the triumphant look on her face as she laughed and patted him on the back.
"Well, this was an enlightening conversation, and as much as I would like to stay and chat—" he tapped his watch, "—duty calls."
"Speaking of which," Harry said as he reached under his desk and pressed the buzzer that would alert Buzley that he needed him. "How did you manage to get in here? People aren't allowed here unless they're important or have an appointment."
Harry laughed, unabashed, and Draco tried to focus on calming his racing heart. Harry Potter was all sorts of trouble, and if Draco couldn't understand him before, he was far out of the reach of Draco's comprehension now.
Everything about Harry's baked goods was perfect. It was moist enough to melt in your mouth but not too soggy that it left a wet aftertaste, it was sweet enough to make you hum in delight but not too sweet that you couldn't eat more. And his pasties—his pasties were Draco's go-to lunch on busy days because of the perfectly savoury blend of spices melded together with the filling and blanketed in dough baked so skillfully that it was crispy along the edges but soft at the core. You could tell, just by eating what Harry made, that he came from a family of skilled bakers.
She seemed startled by that, for some reason, but composed herself before he could question it. She opened her mouth, made to say something, and then shut it, looking conflicted.
"At least he'll be able to spend the rest of his days in peace." Harry watched two Aurors help Lestrange climb over a small boulder.
"Oh, trust me, you can't be half as surprised as I was when my men stationed in London reported back to me that they found
He nodded as Hermione placed a steaming cup of tea on the table and eased into the chair across from him.
This had led to his decision that it would be best if the three were home-schooled until they were old enough to go to Hogwarts, but Ginny had immediately refused because the entire responsibility of it would fall on her; while she loved the kids to death, having all three of them at home all the time while also attempting to work and managing other things was an impossible task. Not to mention them being isolated from other children their age. Harry had argued that they had plenty of cousins for that, and, of course, this had turned into a prolonged row until Molly had intervened and offered to look after the kids whenever necessary until they found a more suitable pre-school.
"Yeah, I am. I'm meeting with someone, so I'm not entirely sure how long I'll be, so can you take care of Miss Barkridge when she arrives, if I'm not back by then?"
he thought in alarm. "No, I'm not. I just woke up and didn't see the banner and the other stuff, so I thought you'd left."
At the mention of my shoes, I look down to see large, white dollops of some sort of cream on my otherwise gleaming Oxfords, and an alarmed squeak escapes my lips as I stare at my new shoes in horror.
Hermione shook her head, her eyes looking suspiciously moist. She pulled him into a hug and patted his back. He let her hug him because he somehow it felt like she needed it more than he did. When they pulled away, she gave him a watery smile and with a "Come on," walked to where Ron was.
"Harry! It's good to see you, mate!" the obnoxious voice Draco wished he didn't know so well said from behind him.
They exchanged looks. "We think someone may have planted it there, Sir, maybe to make it seem like it was a message sent via Floo."
Ron sighed, running a hand through his hair, and the two made their way downstairs to the living room. Harry grabbed a pinch of Floo powder and tossed it into the fireplace as he got on his knees and said, "Ron and Hermione's house."
"Look," she said in a quiet voice after a moment, "I know we've both been stressed out of late, and the tournament came at the wrong time, but we've been through worse. This barely scratches the surface."
"I'm sure you know what I mean when I say I'm still haunted by the past." He paused till Malfoy nodded in affirmation and then continued. "Well, I've had nightmares before; for months, after the war, but all of us had them, and we eventually figured out methods to cope. After about two years, they became less frequent and weren't as earth-shattering or heart-stopping as they used to be, and while I did lose sleep, I never used to jerk awake drenched in sweat, unable to fall back asleep."
I sigh for the third time in ten minutes as I check my wristwatch and tap my foot impatiently on the pavement. Where is the bloody bus?
"Because this seat is close to both the food and the booze, and it's right in front of the TV." Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco. "It's also the perfect excuse to sit beside you.
He glanced up to find himself staring into Neville's worried blue eyes, and forced himself to smile. "I'm fine, Neville."
The blond rolled his eyes and strode to the door. "Just get that bloody vase out of here, Potter. I'll handle the rest."
"I'm not moping." He took a tentative sip of his drink and hummed in appreciation. "Mm, this is actually really good!"
Hermione stared ahead for a long moment, and Harry wondered what was going on in that brilliant mind of hers. When she turned to look at him, her eyes were moist and her lower lip trembled as she opened her mouth to speak.
Mentally slapping his forehead, he took a deep breath and gulped down the water, stopping only when he felt like he'd drunk enough of the cool liquid to stop his face from burning with embarrassment.
Malfoy nodded. "Not at all. In fact, I was suggesting the same to her before she decided to… take you out to lunch." He glared at Camilla, but she pretended like she didn't know what he was talking about.
Before Harry could reply, Leeky the House-elf arrived right on schedule and placed two large trays; freshly baked scones, muffins, and biscuits on one, and the other containing to English breakfasts with baked beans, bacon, fried eggs, tomatoes and mushrooms, and two cups of coffee. With a deep bow, she Disapparated, and Harry barely managed to wait for Malfoy to gesture to the food before devouring it.
Both Malfoy and Harry winced at the accusing tone of her voice, and just as Harry let go of the doorknob and took a step back, Malfoy said, "Because he needs me more, right now, Astoria. I know you're strong enough to handle this for just a little longer—"
"First of all, you must know that my birth surname wasn't actually McMahon. That is my mother's family name, which I took on before I formally began my Healer training. My birth name is Camilla Hutcherson, and I was born in a small town in the far south that probably no longer exists. My parents, Helena and Steven Hutcherson, were devout supporters of the Order of the Phoenix and fought for their cause, as did my two older brothers, Raymond and Marcus Hutcherson."
Harry bowed his head. "We haven't found conclusive evidence yet, so we're trying not to jump to conclusions, but," he paused, glancing between her and Malfoy, "we have reason to believe that they may all be connected, due to how soon after the previous abduction your son's disappearance has taken place, as well as the similar m.o."
"Oh, give me that." Padma grabbed the file and flipped through it, squinting as she read from the dull light of the overhead lamp, and her expression grew dark. She held up the file and looked at him. "This is some serious stuff you're getting yourself mixed up in, Harry."
"Oh, alright. Bye," he said, but she'd already disconnected the call. He raked a hand through his hair.
He eyed the shawl that had fallen to the floor when he'd stood and picked it up just as Ginny rushed into the room.
"You're in quite a mood," the other man commented, placing something on the counter. "What, did someone ask for roses again?"
Harry smiled into his mug as he sipped on his coffee, not having expected Draco to take his side but pleased nonetheless. He then placed the mug down and said, "We're close."
"Don't go too deep, OK?" Hermione handed them the blown up floaties, and they ran back to James, yelling excitedly.
Buxley nodded and headed back over to Lisa, leaving him to enjoy his hasty lunch in peace. He had just downed the scalding coffee when he felt his phone vibrate against his thigh and pulled it out. The moment he saw the caller ID, his eyebrows shot up, and he pressed the phone to his ear.
"Sorry for waking you up, then. It's just—we got back from rounding up another group of vandals just now, and one of the lads asked me about that vase. It's still sitting pretty on top of the boxes of lost items, so I was wondering what to do 'bout it and thought I'd call and ask. Just in case you already had something planned for it."
of a briefcase closing. "Do you not trust me at all to set my personal feelings aside and be professional?"
"Can't you just show them your pass?" he asked as he stuck his hand out from under the canopy and felt the cold drops splatter against his palm.
"Yes, good to see you too, Mr Simpson," Astoria said impatiently, although she was gracious enough to put on a smile and shake the man's hand. "Have you seen my son?"
Draco rolled his eyes, but he couldn't quite reject the brunet. "Only until I'm done eating. And if you get any bodily fluids on me, I swear I'll—"
"Whining 'bout it isn't gonna help, Dyers," Harry said with a grin. "I think this is your chance to up your game and show 'em what you're made of, eh?"
Harry looked around and noticed that the ceiling and edges of the walls still had ornate fixtures on them, although they seemed fake and he was sure they were child-proofed in some way, and the building itself had sort of a vintage feel to it. Although there weren't that many rooms, what rooms he could peep into were spacious and large, despite the fact that there didn't seem to be all that many children enrolled in the school. It definitely had a more… fancy air to it, as compared to the previous pre-school his kids had been in.
Before Malfoy could respond, Camilla took the opportunity to say, "Which is why I suggested that you be his healer, Draco."
For a second, Harry didn't know what Neville was talking about, and it must've shown on his face because the wizard sighed and said in an endearing voice, "The organisation I told you about, Harry."
The voices fell silent, the only sound permeating the unusually quiet night that of intermittent static, and he cursed his luck. Rounding the corner with his gun drawn only to see the tail of a disappearing shadow, he swore at his own stupidity. He barked his location into the handset as he sprinted down the seedy alleyway and turned right. Dodging upturned garbage bins, he took the first left and jumped over a broken fence, wincing as he felt a sharp pain on his palm from having cut it.
She broke off, sobbing, and Harry, being the nosy person that he was, peeked out, concerned about what was happening. He imagined Malfoy had made a ton of women cry in all his years, but he never imagined the blond would have such a crestfallen look on his face as he pulled the brunette into a hug and comforted her. Harry reckoned she must be his wife, and started to pull back and shut the door, now embarrassed by his impoliteness, when the door let out a small squeak.
"I know." He raked a hand through his hair. "I suppose I'm just not used to not having you around to deal with everything."
Unsure of what he was supposed to do, Harry followed after her through the throng of people in the lobby until they reached the crossing corridors just before the Muggle-Repelling Charm.
"All set?" Angelina called, and Ginny nodded as Ron stopped quarrelling with Hermione long enough to help Harry carry his sister's bags to the car. "Put them in the backseat, boys, the boot's full."
He had almost finished when there was a knock on the door. Guessing it was probably Buxley or one of the other Aurors, he called for them to enter without looking up from the forms he was signing.
She didn’t look too convinced, so he added, “I promise you, if the person turns out to be a psychopath, I will run out of there without thinking twice about it.”
Ginny had apparently decided that after the previous night's events, she was going to have to be overly bright and happy in order to make up for his sullenness and irritability. He appreciated the effort, really, but if she made one more remark on what a beautiful day it was, he was going to lose it.
He then turned to the elf and, to Harry's surprise, smiled and said politely, "Mr Potter and I would like to have our breakfasts here, today."
Scratching the back of his neck as he made his way out of St Mungo's, his mind returned to the other most pressing matter on hand: what the hell to do with the bloody vase.
Harry returns to the Burrow to find Ron and Hermione there, taking care of the sick kids, and with Hermione's coaxing, Harry decides to make good of his day off and take a nap. However, his nightmares haven't left him be just yet, and a worried Hermione confronts Harry about them. Ron, who overhears the conversation, gives Harry his own bit of advice. After a surprisingly restful night's sleep, Harry heads off to work, only to hear startling news about Buxley.
"Coming, coming," Draco replied coolly, taking an aggravatingly long time to pull on his coat, smooth down the lapels, dust off imaginary dirt, assess his impeccable hair in the small mirror by the door, and then turn to his son with a smile. "All set?"
The two men looked over their shoulder as Harry's deputy stood behind them, looking between them with an odd expression on his face. Harry cleared his throat. "What is it?"
Malfoy's expression sobered down. "That is a legitimate concern—one that I'm hoping will end in the same way you want it to: with me being your Healer. But we can set that aside for later. For now, why don't we talk about you?"
This was probably the reason why he'd buried it. Because he hadn't wanted someone else to find these pictures and other mementoes from the war and look at him with those eyes full of pity. Harry loathed the idea of people thinking he was pitiful and needed help. He always had and always would.
"One cup of tea for the lady," the girl said in a cheery tone, the complete opposite of the cold look she shot Harry. When Miss McMahon smiled and thanked her, the brunette blushed and scampered off.
"Well, I suppose it's time I made a move," Audrey said finally, and they rose from their seats, making their way to the front of the little café. "It was wonderful seeing you, Harry. We really must keep in touch more often."
"Worse," she replied, sniffing. "Ginny nearly had an aneurysm when Dad brought the syringe close to Al. I swear, I wasn't sure who was the one to get their teeth pulled out by the end of it."
"Look, that fellow's probably still looking for you," Harry said, shaking the boy's shoulders gently in an attempt to get his attention. "I'll give him the money for the bread, but I want you to promise me that you won't steal again."
Harry laughed, feeling a fluttering sensation bloom within him. Somehow, speaking to Malfoy so freely like this, as though they were friends, made him feel an odd sense of relief blossom from the depths of his soul. As though the very act of simply walking nowhere and chatting with him was a process of healing in itself.
Weasley threw his arms in the air, shaking his head in disbelief. "Nothing to do with anything, he says!" He directed his rage at Draco once again. "Why'd you decide to suddenly become friends, eh? I can't believe it was just because Harry asked."
"Nonsense! No one ever said you had to do it alone, Harry. We've been looking after the kids for so long, now; a couple of weeks more hardly matter. I just wanted to speak with you about this to make sure you actually did plan on putting them back in school. It'll do them good to experience different things with all the different sorts of people out there."
"I've never really seen her like that," Hermione said softly as they watched Ginny and the kids troop out of the room. She turned to him and shook her head. "It made me quite nervous to see how panicked she seemed."
She kissed him on the cheek, and he smiled at her before turning back to the road. "I'm glad you could make it."
"Some close friend of Dad's passed away last evening, so they decided to spend yesterday and today with the grieving family," he said, rubbing his eyes.
Hermione," he snapped, splashing water on his face. He looked up to see her reflection in the mirror. She looked worried.
"I know," Harry replied softly. "So did I." He reached over to hold her at arm's length, rubbing slow circles over her blouse with his thumbs. "But apparently I haven't. And now, I've finally reached a point where I'm willing to accept things and confront them."
Harry nodded, ignoring the fact that Malfoy had avoided his question, and shifted in his seat as the blond Summoned a piece of parchment and a quill. They came to a stop before Harry, and he looked up into impassioned eyes and an anticipating smile as Malfoy said, "You know what to do."
The blond fell silent, still staring down at the steaming kettle, and Harry cleared his throat, always terrible at knowing what to say in such situations.
He grinned as his plate floated over to him, and with a quick "Thanks," sat down and began digging in himself.
"OK. First question, then. Since this isn't really official, what guarantee do either of us have that the other will keep this confidential?"
Harry grunted as he pulled off his coat and uniform jacket, turning in a slow circle as Neville, and a few others, helped warm the wet Aurors.
Harry shrugged, sipping his coffee. "I was never really going to cancel it because I'd booked the rooms and everything." A sudden thought occurred to him and he asked, "Wait is
"The place I told you about; it's called Antares. Be sure to use an alias when you first start the correspondence."
"Careful down the stairs!" Harry called after them as he began picking up the clothes strewn around the room.
"Well, that's a lesson learnt. So… did you call me here so you could be mental again and ask me to get you into Azkaban on the day of Lestrange's release?" Neville smiled sheepishly, and Harry rolled his eyes. "Seriously, Neville."
"Oh, wait, I'll pack some of these biscuits for you and Ginny," Hermione said, emptying one of the smaller bags and placing half the biscuits in it.
"Miss Audrey is here, Mr Potter," Vanessa said, and Harry turned to see Audrey making her way down from the other end of the hallway, a wide smile on her face.
Harry rolled his eyes as his son yelped and grabbed his leg, shrieking in pain. Albus snickered and whispered, "Serves you right," smiling innocently up at Harry when he looked down at him with raised eyebrows. The three then made their way inside with a limping and grumbling James in tow, but the moment they reached the two goblin sentries standing outside the main hall, all three children simmered down.
He pinched the collar of his shirt, looking from one miserable face to the other as he awaited a response that would be nothing more than satisfactory after his A-plus insults. Potter only nodded somewhat tiredly at him before patting his friends on the arms and jerking his head towards the waiting train.
Harry leant back and relaxed as she started to narrate the story of how she had stumbled upon the café, and he felt he may have judged her a little too quickly. Maybe she'd be able to help him after all.
"Why would they imprison their prince?" Harry had asked innocently, and Draco had simply glanced at him through half-closed eyes, offering nothing more than an endearing smile.
She laughed airily and almost skipped around the counter, kissing him again and all but running out of the room with a hurried, "I absolutely
was the one that had done something to apologise for. He swore under his breath and reached over for a can of beer, cracking the seal open and chugging it down. Grimacing at the taste, he popped another mini quiche into his mouth, unable to not admire Harry's skill despite being mad at him.
His hands were trembling so violently he almost spilt the hot tea on himself, and Harry quickly took the cup from him and placed it on the table. Stepping closer, he placed a hand on Draco's shoulder and smiled. "Scorpius is fine. We can still sense his magic, and it's stable and strong. He's fine."
She sighed. "I originally only joined this camp as a volunteer because it was the easiest way to come in contact with families returning to the country after fleeing during the war but having nowhere to go because their homes were destroyed."
Harry opened his eyes and watched as James held Albus and Lily's hands as they splashed around in the water, the older boy instructing the younger two to not get water in their eyes. He sighed contentedly and watched as Lily and Albus ran up to Hermione, demanding their floaties.
"As always," Harry replied as Buxley stepped aside and allowed Hermione to leave the office. "Do they want my statement, now?" Harry yawned and Buxley nodded. "Are they in the conference room?"
Lee held up his hands, looking apologetic. "I'm quite certain your son is fine, Sir, because we're able to sense his magical signature, even if we are unable to track it due to him being in an untraceable location."
Draco stared at the ceiling for a long time, recounting the events that had transpired since Scorpius' disappearance, feeling oddly detached from it all as Macnair's face flashed before his eyes.
His father didn’t bat an eyelid, let alone actually do what Draco said. After a moment, he drawled, “The one where a bunch of no-good brats pelted stones at a pregnant bitch and got growled at in response?”
"What can I do for you?" he asked, crossing his legs and clasping his hands before him. "And if this is going to be like another one of Weasley's pointless tirades, then I suggest you quit while you're ahead."
"I'm sorry you had to endure that," Harry said, then gestured to the armchair Ramsey had occupied. "May I?"
"Well, the pub nearby should be opening soon, right?" I say before the saner part of me has a chance to berate my stupidity. "I'm done for the day anyway, so I could close early and we could head there, if you wanted…?"
Harry leaned forward and squinted, wondering what exactly he was looking for, when he spotted it. Close to the ground, running along the bottom of the walls, were two-inch-thick strips of different colours. Some strips ran down along the main hallways, and some ran down only the adjacent corridors. The signboards at every other corner that had names of various locations were painted their respective colours as well.  Harry hummed in surprise as he realised they were a very similar concept to the London Underground's colour-coding system.
Inhaling deeply, he braced himself, and before he could wimp out again, he turned the picture over. Harry read the lines very fast, and then, realising he hadn't registered what it said, reread them. Percy's message was very formal, to the point, and short.
Everyone stared at her like she was off her rocker, and Harry could've sworn he heard Padma scoff if she didn't have such a serious look on her face when she said, "And what might that be?"
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry demanded, knowing he was in the wrong for snapping when Malfoy was being nothing but polite and patient.
"And, she confirmed everything we already knew about her family's background." He placed the file on the desk and pulled out two sheaves of paper. He pushed one towards Harry and placed the other one in front of him. "You probably read about it already, but I'll brief you anyway—Lisanna Barkridge's parents, Jenson and Amber Barkridge, were presumed to have died in an accident two years ago. But rumour has it that it wasn't an ordinary accident and that they were murdered. After Miss Barkridge's grandfather's untimely death soon after her seventeenth birthday—which was a month ago, by the way—rumour turned into suspicion, and there have been claims of someone, or multiple someones, trying to cut down the heads of the family one after the other, and they may be coming after our little miss, next."
At the very bottom, almost swallowed up by the frayed edges, was a single, incomplete sentence in slanted, elegant handwriting. He assumed it was Narcissa's, but only when he saw Malfoy's name did he realise it wasn't. Curious, he squinted as he tried to decipher the faded writing.
"You're still here," Draco stated as he entered the living room, looking more haggard than he had a few hours ago. "I just sent Astoria home with Blaise. Considering how in love with her he is, I trust he'll take good care of her."
insisted it was a guardian angel, and wouldn't tell me anything else. I became suspicious, and I started to spy on him and found that my guardian angel was actually Erhard. He had managed to escape the fire that killed my parents, but the right side of his body was covered in burns, and he seemed like he wasn't happy in the least to be alive. When he approached
"And we've narrowed it down to two possible locations for now, after putting together all the facts."
"Yes, I have," Harry finally managed when Malfoy gave him a curious look. "It's that super elite pre-school, isn't it?"
Before anybody could react, there was a bright explosion, whose sound was muted by the Imperturbable Charm, and Draco squinted through the dust, trying to see what had happened.
"I hope they don't give him too much trouble." Harry sighed as he walked towards the sofa and slumped down onto it.
"Ah, she knows already," he said as Lily came running out from behind the bushes, her arms laden with plants.
Harry bowed his head and said, "No, I suppose not. But I really do respect what you did. Your life was in danger, yet you still chose to protect Hertzfeld's innocence. You are very brave, Lisa."
"Camberwick Green*?" Harry asked, and the man nodded. Harry turned to Draco. "I'm really sorry to have to tell you this, but…"
Trudging downstairs, he paused as he listened to Ginny's voice coming from the living room. He could hear the kids playing outside, so he wondered whom she was talking to. Stifling a yawn, he shuffled inside, grumbling about his need for another mug of coffee.
The Auror Office was bustling, and Harry stepped into his office to see a smartly dressed blond wizard seated in the chair opposite his.
She sounded like she was on the brink of breaking down into tears, and Harry felt guilt well up in his stomach, but he was much too angry to do anything about it. "Well, sorry for missing my wife and wanting her to come home," he snapped. "Please, go ahead and eat your lunch, don't let a conversation with your husband—whom you haven't seen in over a week—keep you from
He pulled his head out and straightened up, wincing at the sharp pain in his knees, and stepped into the fireplace. A moment later, there was the familiar
"Harry," she said softly, touching his arm. He looked away and ran a hand down his face, feeling another migraine settle around his temples. "I'm sorry."
"Because that's the only place that can be tied to me," Harry explained. "There's also my parents' home in Godric's Hollow, but the wards on that one were taken down a long time ago and it's a rather well-known tourist location now." Draco continued to stare at Harry until he began to feel uncomfortable. "What is it? You're scaring me."
"Because I needed her to make sure that you would go on this trip and that you wouldn't sit around and wallow in self-pity or whatever all day long."
The kiss was everything that Draco was not; it was fervent and eager, confused and urgent, desperate and wanton, and when they pulled away, Draco felt more human than Veela.
He looked up to see a woman in a long, black fur coat standing in the doorway. She was standing against the light, so her face was cast in shadow, but there was no mistaking the cruel gleam in her jade eyes.
He suddenly realised that, in his panic, he hadn't even disguised himself, and a sense of terror gripped at him as he stared at the wizard standing before him. The shock left him immobile, and the only thing he managed was to gasp out a single word in question.
Mr Simpson floundered, looking around the room like he had committed a grave error and was getting chastised for it. Sometimes, Draco still wondered how Astoria had this effect on people when she was never overtly commanding or authoritative.
Lily fell silent, and several pairs of eyes—several more than there were supposed to be—stared at him. Ginny was by his side in an instant, a tall tumbler of strong-smelling liquid in her hand. He needed little prompting before chugging down the Pepperup Potion, instantly feeling its kick wake him up.
Draco felt him shrug. "I called Ginny and told her that I wouldn't take up the position if she was willing to take a break from the Harpies and get married. I wanted to start a family soon and thought she would be on board." Harry pulled the covers higher over himself. "She laughed, thinking I didn't seriously expect her to quit the team when she was at the peak of her career. We didn't talk for three weeks after that. Then she called me one fine day, just when I had made up my mind to tell the higher-ups that I wouldn't take the job, and told me that it was extremely unfair of me to expect her to give up what she had spent years striving for to get married and start a family."
"—you're always with me," Draco finished, glaring at the other man. "His anger is reasonable, even if his logic is flawed."
"Don't you have better things to do than wake me up?" he groused as his son started bouncing up and down.
"Neville," he urged again, trying to pull his friend off of the dying wizard, but Neville wouldn't relent. "Mate, it's too late."
"Sit," the blond commanded, and Harry sat—on the chair that had moved up behind him—intently watching Draco's every move as he Summoned a table and some vials of coloured liquid. "You somehow managed to unlock a portal in your world that I sensed from here and, from the goodness of my heart, decided to connect with my own so as to not let you fall prey to other beings from other realms."
He did just that—right after he was administered first aid at his partner's insistence—and walked into the station with one arm in a sling, eyes scanning the room for the man that had been described to him. When he spotted the fellow, surprised by how good looking he was, he walked over and cleared his throat.
Somehow her excuse sounded half-hearted, but Harry waved it off. There was no point in overthinking the smallest of things just because he was feeling guilty. She continued speaking, not having noticed his silence.
She nodded as she beckoned to the waitress and ordered a plate of crumpets. "Well, where were we?" She looked at the file on the table. "Ah, yes. So, Mr Sandford, would you like to tell me a little bit about yourself?"
felt. He knew the blond wouldn't give him a straight answer, though, so he nodded, feeling the first signs of nervousness set in as he consciously quelled the urge to bounce his knee. "I would like to give this—" he motioned between the two of them, "—a try, first. I think it might be mutually beneficial."
"A shot of espresso for me, please," Camilla added, making a little motion of drinking a shot with her hand, and Leeky bowed again.
As they made their way to the door, Harry couldn't help but mutter, "Is it really that easy?" to which Malfoy replied with the telltale sign of a smirk, "It really is."
He could no longer ignore the fact that his nightmares were slowly eating away at his sanity and ruining his life. Somehow, when Ginny and the kids were around, he was able to function normally, and the nightmares didn't affect him as much. But as soon as he was away from them… it was like a rabid animal that had broken free from its chains.
"Don't forget to take this, mate," he said, placing the box that Harry'd put down back in his hands and grinning at him. "I left Ginny one when I went over and tried to give her the ones for the kids but she insisted I speak with you first."
Harry nodded. "Smart. So, how come you're here? Took the day off, too?" he asked as Hermione shuffled about in the kitchen, looking for something.
"Alright, then. Be a good boy and go help your grandparents," Harry said as he made his way back up the stairs.
"Oh, I was wondering when you'd drop by!" Molly gushed, pulling him into a tight hug and calling to Lily. "Lily, sweetheart, your daddy's here!"
She scrunched up her nose at the tacky phrase but grinned anyway as she made her way into the office. He watched till he could no longer see her and then exhaled loudly, letting his shoulders droop. He debated whether he should return to his office or hang around to wait for the verdict, then decided against the latter. This was Hermione, for Merlin's sake. There was absolutely no reason to worry that she'd do anything less than a phenomenal job.
he thought, feeling foolish for assuming that just because the blond was a Mind Healer who solved other people's problems he wouldn't have problems of his own.
"When that time comes, I'll make sure to tell you," he said, and she gave him a watery smile and nodded.
And Harry hoped, expected, even, to plummet into darkness, but Harry felt his back hit the asphalt as he skidded to a stop and collapsed back onto the pile of boxes, his mind going black just as he wondered if he would remember any of what had happened.
"That's not possible," Astoria retorted with a huff. "I ensured that he knew exactly what to say—as I always do."
"I'm only concerned!" she said defensively, and he knew she was bristling without having to look at her.
"Wait, Harry, before you go—" Hermione went around her desk and picked up a quill. "What did you say her surname was again?"
Padma's eyes went wide at the unwarranted thread, and Harry felt a sharp sting from Hermione pinching his arm, but he stood firm. Erhard was innocent, and if proving so was going to cause a rift between the English and German Ministry, then so be it. He didn't defeat a Dark Lord and nearly die multiple times just to step back and turn a blind eye when he could bring justice for someone. Maybe he was going about it the wrong way, but to hell with it. Besides, the damage was already done. There was no point regretting his choices now. He could feel Hermione's anger burning hot against his side and knew he was in big trouble for being so brash, but this wasn't the first time he'd overdone it for the sake of a righteous cause.
They walked down the short corridor and turned left to enter what looked like a kitchen-cum-dining area. There were about a dozen children from around the age of four until about ten sitting at a large, round table, eating their meal and chattering amongst themselves.
Harry threw up his hands, slumping back in his seat. "And you honestly expect me to just take your word for it?"
"Oh, yes, that's right," Weasley yelled. "After all these years of hating him, you both are suddenly the best of friends and I should just take that in stride like it's completely normal? You're off your rocker!" He stabbed a finger towards Draco. "And you! Did you get so lonely without your minions that you decided to string Harry along?"
"Same difference. The Auror Department constitutes the largest task force of the DMLE. And anyway, one of the reasons I joined was so I could help you."
Said lady companion was currently introducing herself, but Harry was preoccupied by the crimson scarf wrapped around her throat, identifying her as the person he had been waiting for all along.
The Goyle boy moaned in pain, and she tutted in annoyance. Looking around to make sure they were alone, she considered for a moment if she should use the Feather-light Charm to Levitate him out of there, but he stirred before she could act on it. He mumbled something incoherent, and she brought her face close to his.
Malfoy's eyes twinkled. "Only the ones with mysterious backgrounds." He paused for a moment, then continued, "Let's just think of it as an extension of my services, shall we? This vase is obviously a source of distress for you, and since it's my job to facilitate you relieving yourself of stressful matters, it makes sense."
"I see." That was all the blond said for a long moment before suddenly standing up and moving to the back of the room. Harry watched as Malfoy fiddled around with something, then the familiar clinking of teacups was heard, and he returned with a tray. "Tea?"
"What are you doing?" Draco asked, squatting down beside Harry and wrapping him with the heavy coat he had had the presence of mind to bring.
Draco's eyes twinkled, his lips finally upturning in a smile, and Harry felt the butterflies in his stomach once again, his heart rate increasing and his breathing growing shallow. The birdsong was shrill in his ears and all the colours in the room were blindingly bright. "Stop doing that," he breathed, leaning forward to kiss Draco. "Maybe losing your magic will be a good thing; at least I won't feel like I'm going to die every time you smile."
Malfoy smiled, and Harry couldn't help but notice the faint dimple he got in one cheek. "That's good to hear. I was hoping that you would be more refreshed so we could take our sessions to the next step."
Draco sighed, his long lashes fluttering as he blinked and closed his eyes. "I was birthed and have existed solely within my mother's protective magic." He motioned around. "This birdcage—I have heard my father joke about it being like a second womb, where she has kept me protected and well nourished all my life. I do not know if I can exist long without her magic."
