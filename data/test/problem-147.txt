“A toad, actually...” I mumble, still not looking at you.
“The mind healer arrived some time ago and would like to talk to you,” she informed him. “The session will be for about an hour.”
Tingling on the back of his neck told him he was being watched. He turned from his buttering process and looked too. Malfoy. Harry fought down the stupid smile on the familiarity of it. Malfoy hadn't done that in a long time.
"...Harry? Are you listening?" Hermione's tentative voice broke through.
The fourth time they met at the Pitch, the majority of students left for the holidays. Ron was telling him for the hundredth time that Harry was welcome at the Borrow, he was taking Hermione to spend the holidays there. But Harry wanted to stay at Hogwarts, help to repair some parts of the castle that were damaged still, to rest from people a bit because really “you know how it is lately, I just… I would love to go to the Burrow but maybe at some point in the holidays, okay?”
“Hmhm.”
“I didn’t want to spoil the surprise is all!”
Harry raised his wand and threw the first hex that came to mind. It was a quite strong Stinging hex and the boy yelped in surprise, his friend flinching just as badly.
Cold air hit him square in the face and snowflakes seemed to become more savage than usual. The weather was becoming worse with each day and the layer of snow was almost coming to Harry’s shins. It was a good thing he could take off from it at any second. Which he did.
Hermione blinked at him, puzzled. “Er— Sure, Harry, of course…”
You look at me incredulously.
Then Ron spoke.
You get obscured from my line of sight by someone and it’s almost a pity. I could watch you all night, I know for a fact. All faintly uncomfortable with the attention, jerky movements and unsure smiles, but still undeniably bright. Oh, you’re a star.
Now he was hurrying outside (Ron and Hermione were nearly late to the Hogwarts Express since they took so long trying to persuade Harry to go). Harry didn’t look at the map, he simply knew Malfoy would be in the usual place. It was morning and gentle snow was falling from the painfully white sky. Perfect weather for Malfoy to come.
“How am I going to ‘fuck off’ if your weasel face is right in my way?” he said in an ugly tone. Harry had forgotten how ugly it could be. Malfoy scowled and moved to pass them.
“Hm, no, I don’t feel like it,” his voice was over the top bored.
He returned to that classroom in the evening after dinner. He told Ron and Hermione that he was going to the dorm early. They hadn’t seemed concerned. Harry suspected they wanted some time together. He didn’t mind.
“Get the fuck out,” Harry interrupted, “and don’t come close to him again.”
As if sensing Harry’s eyes on him, Malfoy raised his head and unerringly found Harry. His blond hair was longer and messier than Harry had ever seen it, one lock covering his left eye almost completely. Malfoy scowled at him, raising his chin higher and sitting straighter. Harry blinked. He hadn’t realised how hunched over he himself was sitting. He straightened too and tried to scowl back. Malfoy grimaced and turned to Zabini dismissively.
Harry stared at him in bewilderment and ever-growing confusion. What on earth was he talking about?
“Harry, do you need any help with your homework?”
He turned away the moment their gazes met.
I clear my throat, gazing intensely down on the night garden, “Um... No?”
Harry was definitely going mad.
After a bit Malfoy looked up at Harry and there was a strange expression on his face. Harry blinked away the tears and everything became slightly more focused. Malfoy was looking at him with… Harry couldn’t really decide. Horror? Pity?
Ron’d said.
Harry reached the door. He swore he heard hushed voices. He couldn’t decipher what they said, but they didn’t sound kind. He grabbed the old handle, swinging the door open.
Harry startled so badly he almost fell from his boom, pulling the handle up too fast. But he regained his balance fast and looked down at Malfoy, who was now sitting upright and staring at him without a bit of surprise. Harry felt his cheeks go hot.
Then Harry saw him getting up and walking to the archway cautiously. He looked inside and after a moment stumbled back. Harry couldn’t see his face clearly but he assumed it was terrified. He felt a strange dark glee inside as Malfoy made a few steps and fell on his knees.
I want to get closer to you, always had, I admit. I want to be something the star looks at. And then I could be above you, above you,
“Liminal space,” I say, meaning the balcony and maybe nothing else.
Children generally don't like sleep, but Harry welcomed it for as long as he could remember. Except maybe for the times when he dreamed things that didn't belong to his mind. Sleep was an opportunity to escape. The cupboard under the stairs had closed around him securely, and then disappeared in the ever coming dreams, hallucinations and then finally nothingness. There was no one to take his food away, to push him or scream at him in rage for the broken plate. Even the dreams weren't so generous.
“Yeah, but we aren’t, are we?”
Harry just looked at him and didn’t say anything. In the wandlight, Malfoy’s features were sharper than usual and that trace of blood didn’t help him look healthy. After a bit Malfoy scoffed and moved to stand up. He staggered on his feet, face grimacing in a painful expression. Harry leapt to his feet and reached out just in time to catch him from falling. The little shock went through him again but weaker this time. Malfoy pushed him away, stumbling back and grasping the nearby desk for support instead.
, he wanted to say,
Harry smiled to the memory. It seemed now like a story from so far away, almost made up. Under the eyelids, along with dancing red circles, there appeared some images from memory, too vague in a dream to distinguish, but still causing Harry's chest to contract slightly with nostalgia. He opened his eyes and turned to Draco and found him studying Harry with a peculiar expression on his face. Harry knew that expression. It made his heart to clench unpleasantly, but so desirable that a hot wave passed through Harry. He could not take his eyes off the grey ones opposite. They always reminded him of a stormy sky.
“Can I come with you next time?”
Harry opened his eyes and let go of Malfoy's robes he was clutching tightly in his fists (when did he even..?) and pushed him away hard. Draco opened his eyes, disoriented and flushed so deliciously with those red swollen lips, fuck, that was Harry's doing, the thought made his chest swell. Malfoy blinked and Harry returned to reality.
“I remember the fields rolling as far as the eye could see, green and all soft-looking. Never liked them much, though. One time Mother took me to see the stars in the middle of the field and I got dizzy looking at the sky, it was so vast and high, I felt like I was losing the ground underfoot.” Malfoy smirked. “I got scared by the night sky, Potter. And I’m named after a fucking constellation.”
“I don’t— need your fucking help,” he panted, face whiter than ever and eyes burning. Harry thought he was just like a ghost in this light, a wild mad ghost. He lowered his hand.
“You’ll what? Curse me? Or punch me in the face?” Harry heard another sarcastic snort. “Try me, you waste of—”
The shadows of Grimmauld Place looked down at him from the dark corners, breathing disapproval and strange quiet knowing.
When Harry and Hermione came to the library the next afternoon, Malfoy wasn’t there.
“No!” Yes. “I mean, I didn’t mean to!” He very much did. “Er— Listen, that wouldn’t happen again.”
Then he stood for a while, breathing deep with closed eyes. Malfoy was all blue-grey and almost glowing for some reason, so far from the darkness under Harry’s eyelids. Harry watched him as he just stood there some feet away.
She choked and hugged him again. Harry felt like she was trying to seek some comfort from him this time rather than giving it to him, and he suddenly felt so tired. Harry hugged her back this time anyway, it wasn’t fair to her.
“Yes, I do remember. But I think we should ask him when he’s awake and not make any harsh assumptions,” Hermione said.
No, that wouldn’t do. I want you to look at me again. Come on. Do it. Look at me, Potter.
“You have the most beautiful eyes I've seen,” Harry said quietly through a lump in his throat.
“I’m a dragon as well, you know.” Malfoy smiled a little, eyes glistening. “You shouldn’t have saved me.”
“Harry?” he asked, confused. “What are you doing?” His eyes flickered to Malfoy behind Harry’s back.
“Potter, tell me,” The words were distant as though coming through the layer of cotton. “Do you hear the clock?”
He hadn’t even noticed how Ron and Hermione stopped arguing (of course there was more lecturing than anything for the last minutes) and now Ron was whispering something to her quietly. She nodded and then briefly squeezed Ron’s hand when he stepped back.
Eighth years weren’t allowed to play Quidditch this year, it so Harry just developed a habit of flying by himself to clear his head.
There was a silence for a few moments and then Harry heard a sigh and Malfoy sat up in bed.
The last thing Harry noticed was the tears swelling in those stormy eyes.
Harry woke up slowly to the bright sun shining in his face. He grimaced and turned away, but the comfort was lost and he opened his eyes. They felt puffy and heavy so he blinked a few times. Everything was bathed in bright morning October light, making already mostly white surroundings blindingly so. Harry supposed it was early.
"Fuck..." Malfoy whispered and went for another deep kiss.
What a curious little thing, isn’t it? You, drifting closer to me, of all people. God, have you forgot who you
He kissed Harry again, but this time it was just a peck on the lips as if just to support his words. It felt more intimate than the thigh pressing between his legs.
Malfo tugged at him, steadying him and saying something. When Harry’s stomach was empty, he leaned back against the wall. Everything was cold and he couldn’t take a full inhale. He realised there had been tears streaming down his cheeks for a while because the new ones felt hot against his skin. Malfoy waved his wand and the smell of sick disappeared.
Harry didn’t even try this time and gave the most reassuring nod he could master. Ron came up behind Hermione.
"So. What the hell is going on?" Harry pressed.
Harry moved as close as possible without touching Draco. He wanted more time, just a few more seconds. The clock pounded mockingly in his ears, hurrying. Draco looked at him, his deep grey eyes floating threateningly.
Malfoy grimaced almost... hurt? Harry was at a loss completely.
He hadn't told them about what had happened on the other side. It had done things to him, and he didn't want to make it real by saying it aloud. His friends worried enough about him. He liked to remind himself that this was what strong people did - they cared for others, not for themselves.
“Wanna go flying?” Harry heard the words and only then realised he had said them. Oh fuck, why would he say that? He looked at the floor wishing he could take it back. Malfoy was standing still somewhere to Harry’s right.
I’m a bit at a loss for what to say in return. My tongue goes heavy and the only thought circulating in my head is “this is some surreal shit right here.”
The forest around was whispering in the language of leaves and insects. This conversation was thicker in the darkest of the shadows, living in between the massive trees and bushes. Twilight was coming. There was no one around and Harry lifted his head to the crowns of the trees, which were hiding the grey sky from the view. It was so high that almost no light reached the grass on the forest floor. Harry recognised this forest with a jolt.
Harry felt something heavy in his chest. He opened his mouth to say something, to reassure his friends (he could speak, he had no problem speaking when he was alone), he wanted to say that it was fine and they shouldn’t worry and he was
Somehow, Harry missed Draco walking in and nearly jumped when someone touched the back of his neck with cold fingers. He turned just to face an annoyed-looking Malfoy. Harry smiled to him because he knew the annoyance wasn’t a fraction real. Draco rolled his eyes at him and sat on the bench, not moving his hand away. Ron was silent. Hermione had a not-so-surprised and rather pleased look to her. Harry smiled sheepishly at them, hand going for Draco’s waist protectively at all the staring he got from everyone at the table.
He stood abruptly, gasping for air, and turned to the exit from the Hall. Ron and Hermione both called after him, but he couldn’t take more of that. Of Hermione’s pleading eyes and Ron’s confused but loyal expression, as though he was waiting for Harry to confess that he had been attacked or something. Fuck, Harry couldn’t take it.
“You try,” he sneered at Ron, and this close Harry could see a glint in his grey eyes. Then Malfoy was past them without meeting Harry’s gaze, and Harry couldn’t help but catch a bit of his smell in the air stirred by his movement. It smelled mostly like nothing, but with a bit of something sharp and overall almost pleasing. Harry immediately tried to forget the thought.
“Some of you are hurrying,” Harry whispered to the trees. His throat felt strange, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d spoken out loud.
"Uh, er... yeah?" Harry felt like an idiot. Ginny was eyeing him in confusion. He couldn't take his eyes off of Malfoy to look at Ron or Hermione.
I smile just a little, involuntarily and baring my teeth just so. We’re not that far now as some minutes ago, I realise, and I can see you pause before looking away at a loud old witch by your side. You practically have to tear your eyes away from me and... Now, isn’t that a curious feeling just in the pit of my stomach?
Harry took a few steps forward, noticing a look of brief confusion flash across Malfoy’s face. Then Harry turned and stood between them, stepping in front of Draco and facing Ron, trying to communicate with a frown how he felt. Ron’s wand wavered and he lowered it, opening his mouth slightly in shock.
Then the green flames swallowed her away, and Harry was allowed to stare at nothing in particular for as long as he wanted and no one would ask him if he was listening or not. He let his thoughts wander.
“Ah, I believe a mind healer would be more of value here. That’s not my area of healing, not exactly, Ms Granger, but…” Pomfrey looked at Harry in question and he realised she wanted to tell them about panic attacks. He didn’t like the idea much but he supposed there was nothing for it. He nodded. “We already discussed with Mr Potter his panic attack earlier, I believe you know what it is?” Hermione nodded, while Ron looked confused. She glanced at him and mouthed ‘later’ just as Madam Pomfrey continued. “It was a serious one and I can’t say I’m not concerned. I can’t give you a diagnosis, but I already contacted an acquaintance of mine who specialises in mind healing and she should be here in a week.”
Walking in casual haste I think. Now, what do people who have been enemies—scratch that, rivals— a school bully and a hero that bullied each other? — when one nearly killed the other and then saved a couple of times from death; what would they have to say to each other?
As soon as the lecture ended, Harry was quick on his way to the Pitch. Ron tried to ask him where he was going, but Hermione was, apparently, very distracting with her animated speech about her homework results. Harry just smiled and waved at him, assuring he will be in the common room soon and really “I just want some fresh air”. Which wasn’t a lie. Very lame truth, maybe, but not a lie.
As soon as they walked into the Great Hall, the sick feeling rose to the top of his stomach and the ringing in his ears grew louder. Everything went fuzzy and blurred, and Harry kept his head low, keeping close to Ron and Hermione. The Great Hall was all in warm colours, but Harry shivered. Everything seemed so familiar, but he wanted to be out as soon as possible. Everything was home except Harry was going to throw up.
When it stopped Harry didn't notice because there was no Harry anymore. He fell into the shy version of death, enveloped in it tenderly. Love was the reason he lived but now all he wanted was hatred. Because nothingness felt better than the kiss.
Harry forgot he’d agreed to meet Hermione in the library that day. It was a Sunday and he’d spent too much time on chess with Ron. It was raining today and the common room was entirely too comfortable with the crackling fireplace. Ron had been sleepy all day, he wore a lazy smile after spending the previous evening with Hermione. They were so obvious when they spent time together, smiling at Harry more than usual afterwards. He didn’t want to think about what they were doing, really.
“I think you have to go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry quickly. As soon as the words were out of his mouth he knew it was the wrong thing to say. Malfoy jerked his head to scowl at him.
“…know that. Scum, that’s what you are,” a disgusted voice was saying and Harry froze. He didn’t recognise who it was but judging by the laughter of approval the speaker was not alone. Harry gripped his wand tighter.
The birds sang something to each other from opposite sides of the lake, something quick and light, echoing in the air. They could fly to be closer.
Harry realised that this corridor led straight to the Pitch. Did Malfoy come there and then change his mind? There was no one in sight, everyone was in the Great Hall at lunch. Malfoy gave him one last glance and made a couple of steps past Harry.
Harry turned to Malfoy standing some feet away and already looking irritated. Harry couldn't quite believe he called him. The silence was stretching. Draco lifted one eyebrow in exasperation.
“There’s a fire dragon behind us,” he whispered. “It will burn me alive, I can feel it close, breathing with smoke. I want it closer.”
They were both guilty, one way or another, of letting people die.
Draco was lying on his side, eyes closed and evidently unconscious. His face wasn’t damaged badly except for the split lover lip that sent a trace of blood down his chin. Harry supposed it was because those arseholes didn’t want to leave any obvious traces of their “fun.” Even unconscious, Malfoy’s hands were on his stomach and Harry suspected that had been the main target. Fresh bruises mottled his hands. Harry felt sicker with every second.
Anger flared in Harry. Ron thought he was doing this for his sake, but Harry couldn’t help but suspect that Ron was finally spilling out years of hatred. It made something shift deep in his stomach.
Harry snorted. He’d just run off two witnesses that had seen him staying in this classroom with Malfoy.
Harry stiffened. He wanted to object, to say that there wasn’t anything wrong with him. But he remembered the talk about panic attacks and he already knew there was something wrong with him. He’d known for a while. He didn’t want to hear a confirmation.
“I wanted to publicly humiliate you.”
“You said you wanted a drink,” you glance at me, confused. “And I feel drained, so.”
Interesting thing was, Malfoy hadn’t come here when Harry was at the lessons once, even if Malfoy himself had a free period. But Harry didn’t ask.
He focused his full attention on her. She had an expression on her face he was becoming used to more and more. Her mouth was turned down slightly at the corners with exasperation or concern, Harry couldn’t really tell. Her pleasant brown eyes glittered with sympathy and her brows were furrowed. She obviously had something to say, maybe even snap at him because, really, for goodness’ sake, it wasn’t the first time she had asked him if he was listening at all and he lied that yes, “of course.” But she never snapped at him these days. Instead there was a lot of understanding and concern and sympathy, and Harry hated it.
"Of course." He wasn’t, actually.
She only waved a hand at him, amusement apparent in her small smile she tried to hide.
Malfoy turned around… and fell in the snow with his back first. Harry’s breath caught, but he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes closed and he would say something at least if he saw him there, wouldn’t he? Wait, what was Malfoy doing in the snow?
Something bumped into his right shoulder, cutting off the train of thought, which was unpleasant. Harry blinked and turned.
Harry breathed heavily. He wasn't used to talking this much but now he was holding back a flood of words. His wand hand shook.
“And he still thinks he’s worthy to even look at Harry Potter! We saw how you looked at him across the Great Hall… You, disgusting little—“ The was a flash of a hex and another yelp.
Harry couldn’t fully process this new information. There was a name to the thing he felt? It was apparently a medical thing with symptoms. Was he sick? Would it happen again? Harry felt a wave of fear wash over him at the possibility. He looked at Malfoy again, alarmed.
“Yeah yeah, alright,” I say. Some good memory you have.
. The forest enveloped his figure with shadows the moment he started to make his way through the trees. The rustle of leaves and songs of insects was thick in Harry’s ears forming one whole buzz, sometimes it changed the loudness to almost uncomfortably loud but the next second it was barely audible. Wild thickets in his way were not a problem, they let him pass obediently. Soon there started to unfold a small clearing in between the tree trunks. Without the layer of the crowns above there was blinding sunlight. Harry flood with relief thinking he could finally get a little warmth.
Draco Malfoy settled near him and sighed too tired for someone who just appeared for Harry’s liking. Harry pointed out his familiar pointed features through some slight fog; the pale skin, graciously warmed by the sun. Malfoy half-closed his eyes, relaxing a little. His light eyelashes were slightly trembling in the sunlight. For some reason, he looked like he was glowing quietly.
My heart’s hammering. There’s noise in my ears and I feel dizzy.
Hermione abruptly stopped and shot a quick almost apologetic glance at him. Harry could feel the irritation rising from the deep of his throat. He knew she meant well, but he didn’t need her careful handling. He was strong. He’d killed bloody Voldemort, hadn’t he?
“Hi Hermione. I’m sorry I wasn’t here earlier. One of the girls from my year almost fainted as we got close to the castle. I had to go with her to Madam Pomfrey.” Ginny dropped her eyes. “Her sister died in the battle.”
He nodded and they headed for the nearest entrance in the train. The crowd parted and quieted as they made their way through.
“Anothertime,” he mumbled a bit too fast and made another step past Harry, not looking at him.
that apparently had a ‘novel’ use of Valerian Sprigs, the list went on and on.
And now he could sleep.
Harry's heart skipped a bit. His name sounded so unusual from Draco and yet so right. It was not as sharp as 'Potter', softer and almost gentle. His chest hurt, he squirmed his eyes tightly.
On Christmas morning, Harry went straight outside only to find Draco with a broom in hand and a golden snitch, smiling nervously. The snowfall had stopped a day ago and now the sun warmed their faces and the crisp cold air was clear and inviting. Malfoy was hesitant at first but after a while regained his usual confidence, smiling brighter than the white light of the snow under the morning sun. Harry let him win and Draco was so smug about it, Harry just had no choice but to kiss him. That was an amazing Christmas present if you ask Harry.
You glance at me. “Yeah?”
I know you don’t now, I’ve been looking enough to notice. How dare you not wanting the privilege I do not have? How dare you being a star when I should’ve been it.
Malfoy startled as though he’d forgotten Ron was still there, then he glared at him.
Harry knew he was right. The sound of the Forbidden Forest around returned, filling everything with a whisper of foliage and insects. The sun faded over their heads. Harry looked up and saw rapidly gathering clouds.
, all of it and he had tried so hard to forget about it—
All the eighth years now shared a common room. That discovery wasn’t met very warmly. Although, Harry felt a bit grateful because that gave Ron something to fuss about and he became more like his usual self for a bit.
Harry was spending breakfast as usual: staring at Draco Malfoy and trying not to notice anything about him (he failed, of course). Malfoy had been avoiding him the past few days and was now sitting with his back to the Gryffindor table. Harry still found the brisk morning light illuminating his hair quite fascinating.
Nothing changed after that. Harry had no idea why he thought it would. Really, it made sense, he couldn’t suddenly become Malfoy’s friend after helping him one more time. If anything, Harry would understand if Malfoy was pissed at him.
“He won’t talk,” he said simply.
Harry wanted some light to keep the darkness away and Malfoy was afraid of fire.
"Malfoy?" The name felt strange on his lips.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, turning his head down at his forgotten parchment with hardly any notes on it. “It’s snowing.”
“I heard you aren’t talking,” Malfoy said abruptly and Harry turned to him. His brows were slightly furrowed and he wasn’t looking at Harry.
“You’re my girlfriend, ‘Mione, aren’t you supposed to, you know,” Ron was muttering to Hermione, offended, “
Harry blinked and looked at Madam Pomfrey, still in confusion. He had? She nodded, looking sad.
“What?” You ask, confused.
Harry noticed the little things after that. He would watch Malfoy across the Great Hall at breakfast and catch how he flinched when standing up, rubbing his chest briefly. In potions class, he sometimes bit his lip while stirring; his hands shook when he chopped the ingredients; he fled the classroom as soon as Slughorn dismissed them for the day.
“I’m nearly done,” he wrote it all already but he needed some excuse to disappear today at lunch break if he wanted to go flying.
He didn’t add. Malfoy stiffened and looked affronted.
Harry should have known it will be like that. During the next few days Ron and Hermione were looking at him in this sympathetic way, they talked tentatively and helped with everything.
Harry made a step from the wall, getting angry now. There was some bitter disappointment somewhere inside him where he didn't want to look too closely right now.
“You have to mean it,” Harry said quietly, bringing the wand closer to his chest.
“Does Malfoy study in the library?” he asked Hermione in the common room. She was reading a charms textbook and startled in the chair, looking up. Harry realised he hadn’t talked since the morning.
She turned to him at the entrance to the Floo.
“It’s not pathetic, the way you feel. I know it sucks, believe me, I know,” he pushed at Malfoy’s shoulders a bit harder. “But you can’t dismiss it forever. Can’t hide from it.”
Some birds were making a distant conversation, Harry listened to them sing. The wind rustled softly through the trees surrounding the lake, making some leaves take off.
When she sighed and averted her eyes, grimacing, Harry’s frown deepened.
. I really, really am.
Trees whispered at them from the distance and the sun was beginning to turn orange, everything went warm under Harry’s closed lids. He’d forgotten that under his closed eyes there could be light too.
"What? Tell me, come on, or–" Harry had no idea what he would do but Malfoy didn't need to know that.
"Fuck, everything is bollocks, everything going straight to hell, and I can't even bring myself to—" Malfoy was getting angrier and seemingly more confused with every second. As if he had the right to get fucking confused by the situation he created. "And the worst thing is you! You with your fucking— That I want to— To—!" he started to raise his voice.
“Now you don’t?” Harry asked.
Harry stared at him. Was he hallucinating someone else as Draco Malfoy? Because he was sure the real one wouldn’t say these things to him. The real one would’ve been cruel and smirking at the way Harry fell apart. He wouldn’t hold Harry’s wet face in his shaking hands and telling him it wasn’t his fault.
“Damn mate, that was scary as hell. We thought something awful had happened.” He sounded concerned and a touch suspicious. Harry felt a small wave of frustration. Hadn’t that been ‘awful’ enough? He dismissed the thought. Ron probably didn’t want to mean it like that.
“So, Hermione, any ideas about our schedule?” Harry asked, voice a little rough, turning to her.
Sometimes he would ask Harry something like, “Potter, have you noticed the new garden in the Middle Courtyard?” Harry hadn’t. “Of course you haven’t, you’re such an inattentive oaf sometimes, really. There’s some Blue Flyeating Heather and it’s so fascinating!”
Fuck. I move to the side just a step and I instantly catch your eye. A shock goes down my spine, a sharp little thing. Were you looking for me? You were, weren’t you?
You stare at me with a strange expression. Cruel, I notice, oh well... Cruel was always a bit of a my thing.
Harry waved his hand, “No-no, it’s really nothing, I know what to write and will do it at lunch break.”
Harry went for the kiss fist instead, swearing in his head. He was already addicted, it seemed. The intoxicating heat and sweetness were everything he wanted. And the fact that it was Malfoy... Harry moaned as the tongue slipped into his mouth hungrily. Harry's back hit the wall again, and this time there was a knee shown between his legs. It was almost too much. His hands found silky hair on their own accord. Harry gasped as the thigh pushed into his crotch, all his thoughts begun to flee. The kiss was so consuming, so hungry and desperate, it was so hard not to fall into it completely until nothing was left...
Then Malfoy was kissing him. Harry didn't have a second to comprehend when it started and the next thing he knew he was slammed into the wall with a strong body. He opened his mouth to gasp and immediately hot tongue was sliding past his lips. Eyes fluttered shut automatically, there was nothing left except for the hot sensation of a deep hard kiss, Malfoy's tongue was persistent and their teeth collided painfully. Malfoy tasted of pudding that was for dessert this morning and Harry felt like he started to float away. He didn't notice the moment he started to respond, but an answering deep moan against his mouth made him shiver. Fuck. He wanted to hear and feel more.
“Hmm.”
He nodded and stood to walk her to the Floo, feeling exhausted and stiff with regret. Their tea hadn’t even cooled yet.
Draco's expression changed, turned into a familiar scowl of distaste.
Harry just wanted to fly alone. He wasn’t entirely sure why he wouldn’t just say so to Ron. Maybe because Ron would go with him, and it was a fine concept but wasn’t something Harry wanted at the moment. As Harry was making his way through the castle in a quick pace, almost every student in his way made sure to greet him. He smiled back politely not changing the tempo.
He looked at Draco sideways, finding him already staring at Harry. Harry stumbled a bit, something catching in his throat. He felt annoyed with himself. That was happening more and more often. Malfoy looked away, frowning a little.
“Where’s your wand?”
Harry stared. Something hot rushed over him at the sound of his name. It really shouldn’t have sounded so new when Malfoy said it, he heard his name all the time. Hermione said it constantly, with concern most of the time, or sympathy or exasperation. Ron said it with delight or excitement or alarm. But Draco never called him Harry of all things and now it felt strangely intimate to hear that. His name sounded almost tender, Harry realised.
That someone yanked his hand hard and Harry startled, looking at them automatically. He couldn’t see much but it was Malfoy. Harry absently thought that it was weird he was here, but felt too frozen to even blink at him. His throat was constricting dangerously and he thought he was shaking but it was hard to say. There was only one thought loud enough in his head.
He gasped in disbelief. Malfoy licked gently at his lower lip and Harry closed his eyes, his mind melting into the warmth and all the thoughts left in quick succession. He kissed back, Malfoy made a quiet desperate sound and the kiss deepened, cold hands cupped Harry’s face, moving his closer. Something almost painful constructed in his chest, gripping his throat and making him moan.
And then Harry threw himself at Malfoy, pinning him to the snow and hovering above. He had no idea why he’d done it but Malfoy was now so close and looking at him with a shocked and open expression, eyes wide and strange looking.
Hermione looked him in the eyes, searching.
“Harry? You okay?”
“I’m meeting with Ron tomorrow and I don’t know when we’ll meet later. I’ll owl you as soon as I can. Will you be okay?”
When Harry caught up with the words and the meaning, he felt a sharp ping of sympathy and ache. The last time Malfoy went flying. Harry was an idiot.
Malfoy swallowed and met Harry’s gaze. He wore a haunted expression, pained and defensive, but after a moment he relaxed a touch and shifted his hand with Harry’s wand towards himself. Harry let him, not letting go for some reason. Malfoy aimed the wand at himself and murmured a spell that filled the dark room with a faint purple glow. A pleasant tingle ran through Harry’s fingers where they were pressed to Malfoy’s hand, magic pulling a little from him in a familiar gentle way. Malfoy sighed with relief, standing straight (Harry hadn’t even realised he was leaning so heavily on the desk). The moment broke when he shook off Harry’s hand with an affected expression of annoyance.
“It will rain. Rain! Right, because rain will pour out of my grey eyes, Potter!" the bitter laugh was more like a howl, Harry’s throat clenched painfully. Lightning flashed.
“Harry!” he exclaimed and threw a weary glance at Malfoy. “I don’t know why you won’t tell me what he’s done, but it’s fine, now it’s the two of us and—” He scowled darkly at Malfoy, shifting to Harry while still facing him with a raised wand.
“Good morning, isn’t it Harry?”
Ron shivered and started to add some sugar into the newly appeared teacup.
So he kept rolling his eyes in exasperation at both of them and waited for them to act normal again.
Harry flinched and felt the urge to turn around and go for the castle before he got noticed. He remembered uneasily the last time he watched Malfoy when no one had been supposed to. He really really should just turn and fly away. Right now.
And after he would wait for the soft opening of the door in the dead of the night.
He searched the map for the name and almost laughed at how familiar that was. Malfoy wasn’t in the dungeons, nor was he in Library or the Great Hall. Harry’s heart quickened as he looked for the Pitch. And there it was, not really in the same place the day Harry saw Malfoy but near. And Malfoy was moving slowly, walking to nowhere in particular.
In the next moment he lowered to his knees by the bed. Harry tried very hard not to flinch in surprise. Malfoy’s face was closer to Harry’s now and he could see such an open expression he was taken aback. His brows were furrowed and mouth turned down at the edges, pale skin contrasting to the shadows. He opened his mouth slightly.
’ he’d said, and it sounded as though he’d had many.
Harry’s first thought was that he was drunk, but he didn’t sound drunk. He sounded like he was in pain. The fall couldn’t be that bad, Harry thought. He wanted to turn his head and look through the curtain. He didn’t move.
it or something?”
Suddenly someone was calling his name but Harry heard it as though it was from underwater. It was
When they were dismissed, he reminded his friends about going to the Library and tried to look as relaxed as one could while being as nervous as possible. When he was making his way through the castle, Harry cursed himself mentally. What was wrong with him? That was ridiculous, to be so…
Ron muttered something as he stormed into the room. Harry breathed in deep and went after him, thinking, ‘What the actual fuck?’
“Why are you here, Potter?”
Suddenly, Draco pulled back a little, Harry still felt his rapid breath on his sensitive lips. Malfoy laughed so brokenly, making Harry returned to reality abruptly.
Harry glanced at Draco uncertainly. He had no idea if he’s being honest, it just happened somehow. Draco was looking at him at a loss, his hand tightened around Harry’s nape. Harry turned to Ginny, smiling at her.
“You didn’t take your broom,” Malfoy said after a while.
Malfoy never seemed surprised and they didn’t even talk sometimes. Malfoy asked him the third time Harry flew to him on the broom how Harry could know he was there every time.
Some level of calmness finally took place from the familiar feeling of flying. Harry looked around for a figure but all he could see was snow. So he flew in the vague direction he saw Malfoy on the map. He took a little higher to see the ground better.
Harry’s heart slowed down only after he landed on the snow some fifteen minutes later. It was still snowing in the evening and he couldn’t stop watching the Slytherin table.
“Get out,” he said quietly and almost flinched from the cool steel in his own voice, it sounded raspy from disuse.
After a while of Harry definitely not staring at Malfoy, the patch of light moved and fell right in Malfoy’s face. Harry had a moment to notice how his eyelashes seemed to glow white under it before Malfoy stirred, grimacing slightly, and then opened his eyes. Harry’s heart caught and he looked at the door to Pomfrey’s cabinet. He still saw as Malfoy blinked a few times, rubbed at his eyes and undoubtedly looked in Harry’s direction. Harry felt his cheeks go warm.
“I’m sorry for the mess, Mr Potter, I’m afraid I haven’t yet unpacked everything, it will be done in a second.” She walked past him, weaving her wand to levitate a stack of books and send them neatly onto the shelves. She then turned to Harry and smiled apologetically. He hesitantly smiled back.
A strange nervousness was taking hold of Harry as the morning went by and the lunch break came nearer. It was the last days before the Christmas break so the classes were more or less relaxed, students were excited about the holidays and spending time talking with friends about their plans. But now Harry just thought about flying and definitely not about how Malfoy’s face looked that day under the snow.
The next thing Harry felt was Draco kissing him. Angrily and no less dangerous than his eyes. The intoxicating warmth and sweetness were right next to painful biting and collision of teeth. And yet it was the best kiss Harry ever had.
He saw Malfoy when he was preparing to land. Harry almost missed a small figure near the line of the forest, his eyes watering and nose numb from the cold. Snowflakes hitting his face only intensified and no longer seemed insignificant. There was no one around and Harry stopped abruptly some five feet above the ground when that was proven to be wrong. The figure was easy to miss in the constant shimmer of intensified snowfall. Harry immediately recognised the blond head (what the hell was he doing without a hat in this weather) and then noticed how strange the picture was. Malfoy stood with his face turned upwards to the sky and his palms (without gloves) open as well, arms bent at the elbows. Harry was some distance away and Malfoy was turned sideways to him but Harry could see his face clearly. Eyes closed, brows relaxed and mouth slightly opened, sharpness almost gone. Harry shivered, not entirely from the cold. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t supposed to see that — no one was — Malfoy seemed so unguarded and relaxed that Harry was not sure if it was Malfoy at all. No, it was him, Harry doubted he could mistake him for anyone, but he never saw this Malfoy. If not for the black coat he could easily blend into the snowy landscape, blond hair and everything. But he didn’t seem cold at all, he seemed strangely human and gentle…
“Ah, Madam Pomfrey, you see— Harry, he— We want to be as supportive as we can but…” Hermione struggled and Ron stepped forward.
Harry shook his head. There was something more important right now to ask.
Harry felt the heat on his cheeks and god that was a disaster. Malfoy was looking at a loss during his speech but at the last question his pale eyes widened and the colour drained from his face. He stared at Harry for a couple of seconds. Harry cursed himself for talking at all and, anyway, what Malfoy was reacting so dramatically for? He didn’t say anything
Harry suppressed a shudder. Malfoy’s voice was so quiet, Harry was half sure it was in his head. And he could feel the burn of the memory behind his neck as well.
Malfoy tsked at him with a snort.
After some floating the dreams came. The flickers of images and sensations swallowed him fully. There was Ginny with three heads, every one of them was screaming at him the words of love and he was running away. Ron and Hermione were standing on the cliff, looking at him in disappointment. Hogwarts in the summer afternoon and the familiar lake, but full of blood. Then Harry lost himself and observed some story from above about a group of teenagers fighting an evil queen. Near the end of the story, two boys were sitting together some distance away from their friends in the red glowing of the sunset. Then Harry found himself as one of the two. He looked in the eyes of his friend.
Draco rolled his eyes but returned the grin. He was looking at hem with the same excitement Harry felt.
Trees were losing their leaves too soon, shaking them off impatiently, trying to breathe in some cool air.
, but Harry liked it. He didn’t have any strength to deny it in his head at the moment.
"I know," he answered uncertainly.
He couldn’t tear his eyes away.
“So, let’s go and see which bastards we’re going to live with for the rest of the year!”
Harry threw her a smile before returning his gaze to the fire. He thought he felt just for a second the deadly heat and choking smoke and hands around him holding so tight, another chest pressed to his back. The fire continued to crackle softly in the fireplace, its light flickering over the engraving of red shimmering grape leaves.
They stopped at the door next to the Hospital entrance, Harry had never been there but he reckoned it was some kind of personal quarters. He glanced at McGonagall.
Ron and Hermione took him to Madam Pomfrey the next morning. The previous day they let him be, though he’d felt their concerned glances all the time. When after an awkward breakfast Hermione raised to her feet swiftly and took Harry’s arm, he didn’t resist. When he realised they were going to the Hospital Wing, he merely sighed but let her tug him along, Ron by his side with a serious expression.
Draco smiled wider, despite his trembling lips. Tick-tock.
Harry hesitated. He could swear he heard voices. He scanned the room one more time carefully, frowning. Something felt off but he couldn’t say what and he wasn’t sure he wanted to worry his friends more.
Harry turned and scowled at him, wiping the cold snow away from his neck and shivering.
He stormed out of the common room. It had been four days and he was going mad. Ron and Hermione treated him as if he would break any time they spoke too harsh or let Ron beat him in chess. Harry scoffed under his breath. The look of pity in their eyes reminded him every time that something was wrong with him, and he hated this feeling. He just wanted to be normal again.
Then his expression changed to a brokenly determined one. "How is this that the one single thing you know is a lie anyway? It's ironic, don't you think? And so pathetic, really."
Ron threw up his hands in the air, staring at her incredulously.
Love, Harry’
“Never mind,” I turn away, cheeks hot. Goddammit.
She sighed patiently. “I was talking about the next year at Hogwarts. We have only a week left, you do realise that?” Harry blinked at her rather stupidly. She rolled her eyes. “I told you already...”
Then you kiss me. Your lips are dry and warm and smiling and I freeze entirely, my heart included, apparently.
“Oh! Wait! That horrible one in second year?! It was so humiliating! You said it was Ginny?” Shiiit.
“Do you
Harry decided he liked it fine. There were a few students here talking in small groups, but the majority had already gone to their dorms. A parchment floated near each entrance with the rooms and names. Harry and Ron hadn’t yet gone to see if they were in one room and who they’d be rooming with. A shiver of anticipation ran through Harry.
The night breeze rises bringing the smell of the night grass with it. You don’t chuckle this time, looking put-out and thoughtful at me.
Hermione ended up hugging him so tight he could hardly breathe. And even if she did cry she didn’t give it away (much) and Harry was grateful. He loved his friends but he couldn’t shake off a feeling that he was causing too much unnecessary worry for them. He wished he would listen to Malfoy talk about everything but Harry instead.
“Sorry,” he mumbled. Malfoy snorted.
Someone touched his hand and Harry jerked sharply in surprise. Ron was looking at him with understanding.
He didn’t hear a word Professor McGonagall said. Headmistress McGonagall. Frankly, there were hardly any first year students this time. Maybe a few joined their table, but Harry hadn’t paid attention to the sorting. After a short time, he watched in a haze as the feast appeared before them, and at this sight his stomach rolled and clenched painfully. Somewhere to his left Ron reached for something and hesitated before helping himself to the smallest portion Harry had ever seen him put on the plate. He was pretty sure Hermione wasn’t eating either.
Draco blinked and realisation flicked over his face, followed by more panic. He made a step backwards.
“… Harry?” The taller asked hesitantly, glancing at his friend.
At some point during the feast, Harry felt someone sit down close to him. He jerked back out of nothing and turned. It was Ginny, with much shorter hair and tired eyes, as warm and familiar as ever. She smiled at him timidly and turned back to the food, filling her plate. Harry realised he hadn’t even noticed her. The uncomfortable thought at the very back of his mind said, ‘
“I really don’t know how hard it must be for the younger children that witnessed the battle last May...”
Harry closed his eyes, he couldn't wait to start floating.
“No I’m not, you tosser,” he quickly ducked when another snowball came flying into his face. “Hey!”
“I need a drink.” And then you’re moving past me, for some reason brushing my elbow when you didn’t have to do that, at all, frankly.
Harry stared. He actually wanted to learn more. How did Malfoy deal with these attacks, why had Harry never known they were a thing, why did Malfoy get them a lot?
“Whatever,” this Malfoy mumbled, looking past Harry, ending the short exchange here. Then he looked back from where he came with a brief uncertainty crossing his face.
How could he answer that? He didn’t know why. He couldn’t say that he just wanted to see Malfoy… Harry looked at the snow beneath the broom, there were deep tracks Malfoy left. For several seconds everything was quiet and Harry felt a searching look on his face but didn’t look up. Malfoy didn’t seem willing to break the silence first. Harry glanced at his legs in black trousers that were buried in snow.
Harry had no idea how long he had been lying like this, unmoving and wide awake, swimming in self-pity and being angry with himself for it. But suddenly he heard the heavy main door of the hospital wing click open. Harry startled a bit, not sure if his mind was playing tricks on him. The entrance was right in his line of view so he looked in that direction, not moving. It was pitch-black in that corner but soon Harry saw a slim figure appear in the square of dim yellow light from the corridors. He thought it looked familiar and frowned.
Sometimes I think I worship you. Other times I hate you, of course, and the percentage I’ll leave for you to figure out.
Hermione had even given him her homework to copy without a word. Ron was constantly acting awkward and Harry clearly saw he didn’t know what to say. And all of that was so akin to pity, he wanted to shake them. Yes, he didn't want to talk, but
Harry was so grateful, he felt his shoulders fall in relief. He honestly
He was glad for his best friends but now he threw the second book aside because he couldn’t concentrate. He sat back in the chair near the fireplace and looked out of the tall window of the Gryffindor tower. All he could see was the white sky. He sighed and got up. Harry was never the person of cosy reading anyway.
It wasn’t his bloody fault he couldn’t force himself to talk.
You’re a star. And all I want is to go find the darkest ditch somewhere and die in it, alone and undisturbed. Too bad the darkness makes me sick with memories, too.
“So, my name is Lynda Wright, I’m a mind healer at St Mungo’s but often work on the continent. I studied Muggle Psychology after my graduation from Hogwarts.” She paused, looking around with a somewhat melancholic look to her eyes. “It’s good to be back.”
Harry didn’t say anything. The leaves above his head whispered encouragingly.
There’s an awkward bit of just lips connected and then you draw away slowly, uncertainty drawing your brows in a frown. I blink at you, not knowing what just happened.
Harry sighed.
"I said, I'll tell you, are you deaf or something?" Harry felt a rising wave of irritation. He stepped closer. But suddenly Malfoy's hands were cupping his face. "First, can I— One more time, and then I'll tell you?" Malfoy's heavy gaze fell on Harry's lips, almost making them tingle. "Anything you wanna know..."
Every night Harry looked at the ceiling for hours, listening to his roommates breathe. Ron would occasionally stir and sometimes jerk awake after a nightmare. If this happened, Harry would sit up and conjure him some water with a calming charm on it. He tried not to hear Ron’s heavy breathing and occasional muttering of Fred’s name. After Ron would quickly fall asleep, Harry stared up some more, searching the shadows for something and never finding it. Waiting for the door to open.
He tore his eyes away with some effort. He needed his head clear. That thing yesterday had messed up his thoughts and then Malfoy came and made everything worse. Harry felt like thinking hurt.
don’t like this. Please tell Ron everything’s fine because I won’t be writing sappy notes to him as well.
Malfoy evidently found what he was looking for and stood, sighing. He was a couple of beds down from Harry’s, right in the blue light. He looked pale and haunted with sweat faintly glistening on his forehead, the hand uncapping a potion was shaking. He downed it fast and placed the empty bottle on the bedside table.
“You didn’t answer, though,” Malfoy said. “Why are you here?”
The grey eyes were sizing him with annoyance. Malfoy grimaced and wrinkled his nose in such a mask of displeasure that was screaming of hatred. Harry grimaced in return but didn't say anything. His throat was stubbornly not working. Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned away, walking fast towards his table.
"Malfoy!" The strange thing was, Harry couldn't believe he hadn't been saying this name all the time, it felt so familiar and easy to say. Even if earlier it was with nothing but dislike to it.
“You know, Malfoy?... I think it’s the first time we’re alone and talking since we first met.”
Ron and Hermione appeared by his side.
“What the clock is doing in the forest?” The sharp silver of his opened quickly eyes glittered in the sunlight.
“And what the fuck are scum like you doing in here? Hasn’t your daddy got himself into Azkaban already for messing with us? Wanna follow in his steps, little Death Eater?” There was a shallow thud of a punch, followed by a groan.
“Glad to hear that I was such a threat,” Harry glared at him. Then Malfoy looked forward again with a serious expression. “I did like flying. Quite a bit.”
Harry felt an urge to smile and instead rolled his eyes.
Draco was silent, looking at Harry as though waiting for him to say something. Then he lowered his head and just sat there for a while on the floor.
Then Madam Pomfrey’s door clicked open and she appeared, briskly awake and wearing her usual uniform. Harry sat up as she noticed them. He waited for a look of surprise and maybe outrage on seeing Malfoy there. But she just acknowledged him and Harry with a nod.
“Hogwarts seems the same but feels different.”
I appreciate yours and Ron’s worry, you mean
“Mate, what’s up with you?” Ron whispered into Harry’s right ear causing him to startle.
I wait just a bit before coming after you through a door leading to the balcony. (No drinks there).
I grab the front of your smart robes and draw you in again, forcefully. I slam our mouths together— ouch — and kiss you open-mouthed and hot. You let out a breath and open your lips.
“W-we’re sorry,” the taller said, still holding a hand to his chest where the Stinging hex it him, “we were just—”
Ginny looked at her with a tired smile.
“This sun reminds me of June at Hogwarts, when we were gathering by the lake after exams, remember?” Harry closed his eyes again, turning to face the light. “The third year. Ron, Hermione and I loved to sit in the last days by the lake before the holidays and discuss how we managed the exams. Perhaps this was one of the few years when the end of the term was not overshadowed by anything terrible and I had to lie in a hospital or something ... Not that it was without any adventures, of course!
“Ask me another time,” Malfoy didn’t stop.
Harry came closer and stopped several feet before them. He could now see Malfoy, just laying there and not moving. He felt a cold rage going through him in a wave. He looked at the shocked boys.
Harry didn’t moved though, he was supposed to be asleep anyway and what was his concern even if Malfoy had come here to steal medicines? Harry would tell Madam Pomfrey in the morning if it was something important.
“I’m aware of your circumstances,” she said, and Harry looked away. “And you won’t have to speak until you’re comfortable doing so. For now, I just want to tell you about something that can help you understand what’s happening.”
Suddenly Hermione knocked over her goblet of juice, and Harry startled. She squeaked and drew her wand to vanish the mess. Harry looked at her. Not that he hadn’t noticed,z but she was a mess today, hair more wild than ever and a lost look on her face. He frowned, concern blooming in his chest.
“You stunned me first and then stomped on my nose.” I grimace.
“You’re late,” said Malfoy’s bored voice.
“Malfoy,” you say, after a bit. You say it as if tasting something awful. I smile wide. You’re such a dick.
“Harry, mate, we can just play chess, maybe this time I’ll win.”
"I— Oh, fuck," he started trembling a little.
“I know, I know, I know,” he was muttering, holding tight, “Fuck, it’s not your fucking fault, hear me? It’s not and you know it. So stop bloody crying, you’re just pathetic—”
My knees feel weak when I taste you. You’re hot and wet and forceful and I think I’ll taste this kiss for weeks. Your tongue slides into my mouth, your hands into my hair, ruining them, ruining me. Fuck.
He supposed he should go flying. At the thought, an idea struck him. Harry almost cursed himself and went up the stairs to his dorm quickly.
“Don’t be, it’s pathetic of me really.” Harry could hear the bitterness in his voice but it was so far from the usual Malfoy bitterness Harry had to look at him again just to make sure.
You drift closer with every minute, unnoticeable, in the stream of people surrounding you. I can’t tear my eyes away even to check who’s near me. It’s darker here, in my corner. I hope you’ll enjoy it, that spotlight seems to be very tiring for you to bear for long.
“Yeah, maybe but I didn’t realise that while I dreamt, did I?” Harry grinned a bit nervously. Now with the more clearer mind, he remembered why exactly he didn’t like this place.
Malfoy stopped so abruptly Harry nearly bumped into him. He finally turned to Harry with the most strangest expression on his face that Harry had never seen before. It was strangely determined and serious but uncertain and a bit flushed. Harry stared back in wonder.
“Don’t. You’ll wake up.”
When Hermione asked him why he was frowning for the third time that day, Harry sighed and asked if she was going to the library. She gave him her usual worried-exasperated expression and nodded.
“This autumn is surprisingly warm so far, isn’t it?” he murmured. “I always preferred the autumns of Wiltshire rather than how it is here. The sun there lasts longer. I remember it being warm till the second half of October.”
Ron and Hermione were still walking on eggshells around him. Harry finally decided he needed to do at least something. He went with Hermione to the library and wrote her a note. He had trouble picking the words but eventually handed it to her.
Then Malfoy did something with the corner of his mouth, very subtle but Harry noticed. Was it a smile? Even if it was, Malfoy stood up and walked a bit closer.
He started making his way to his place at the Gryffindor table with a wave of students like him, his mind deliciously blank. This morning was just the right amount of empty, exactly the way he liked it, full of automatic familiar motions and some greeting through the throat that was refusing to speak more than three words at a time. Harry reckoned it was Sunday. A small glimpse of disappointment shot through his mind at the thought that tomorrow was Monday already. It was familiar and fleeing. He really--
The door appeared and Harry went through. The passage was dark and narrow. The raw stone surrounded Harry from all sides but he ignored the uneasy feeling and moved farther, lighting his wand to see. It wasn’t a very long trip and soon Harry saw a bit of light from the other side hidden in the archway. He sighed with relief, the darkness and cold started to push down at him. Then he smelled something strange. It was barely-there trace that wasn’t one bit pleasant. Had some student left a bit of food here? Harry grimaced and quickened his steps. When he came closer to the end of the passage something caught his eye. He paused and aimed his wand slightly to the bottom of the wall. It was a dark spot. Pretty big but somewhat faded. Harry frowned and came closer.
“Rain is coming,” he muttered distantly. As if in response, silvery clouds rumbled approvingly distant peal of thunder somewhere in the depths of the sky.
And then angry with himself. That was just ridiculous. Since when had he started to rely on that for falling asleep? At first he’d just told himself that he was making sure Malfoy wouldn’t do anything funny like playing pranks on them as soon as they were asleep. But he couldn’t rely on that excuse anymore, it sounded ridiculous even in his head.
“Good morning to you as well, Potter,” he murmured, stretching.
Harry pushed the door open with a kick, not really aware that he did it until he found himself staring at the two boys turned at him. They were Gryffindors, sixth or seven year, he wasn’t sure in this light. They were standing in a further corner and Harry couldn’t see their feet behind all the desks but he was sure of what he would find. age pulsed through him.
And now he heard someone arguing in their room.
Harry didn’t know how to answer that. A prickle of irritation went through his stomach and he thought about biting something in response but then he noticed something. Even though Malfoy appeared annoyed as always, he seemed much softer than he usually would. His shoulders were relaxed and eyes clear, and he hadn’t stormed off yet for some reason. Harry tilted his head.
Suddenly for no apparent reason Harry glanced at the Slytherin table. Very few students sat at it, Harry realised. The younger years sat close together at one side of the table, not raising their heads. The half a dozen older students were spread across the table in twos and threes. One blond head drew Harry’s eyes. Malfoy sat near Zabini with his head low, not eating either. Harry vaguely thought that he especially shouldn’t be here.
This was the last thing Harry felt before waking up. He sat abruptly in the dark, his heart pounding in his ears. He raised slightly trembling fingers to his cheek. Wet.
After a couple of days at breakfast, Harry tried to wake up properly with the help of a cup of tea. His eyes were on the Slytherin table, as it later became his habit (again), where Malfoy just arrived. Harry lazily thought that it would be great to go flying again today and that Malfoy looked more tired than yesterday. He sipped the tea and glanced at Hermione and Ron who just sat at the table — Ron still yawning and with sleep dishevelled hair, Hermione as collected as always. She smiled at Harry.
Harry's nape was tingling occasionally for the remaining of the breakfast.
Harry rolled his eyes, breathing out a huff. As long as he didn’t talk, Draco had all the time to listen to his own voice. Draco shot him an annoyed glance.
Ron glanced at Harry and grinned uncertainly but reassuringly.
“Don’t make me repeat myself. If I ever see this shit again, you’ll be out of Hogwarts sooner than you can ‘sorry’, do you understand?” The two boys looked guiltily at each other, and Harry continued, “I didn’t go through all of the trouble of killing Voldemort just to let even more suffering happen in these walls. I’m disgusted to see my house colours on your robes.”
“Fuck you, Malfoy. Tell me what you’ve done to him or I swear I—” Ron choked off. Harry could imagine his friend being red from fury.
Malfoy was staring at his wand with wide eyes and mouth a bit open. He didn’t make a move to take it and after a few seconds Harry was starting to feel awkward. Right, so he didn’t need any help, did he. He lowered his outstretched hand a bit. At the movement, Malfoy shook himself minutely and took his wand with a quick movement, as though afraid Harry was going to change his mind. Harry let go and looked Malfoy in the eyes. Malfoy was appraising the wand with a somewhat dumbfounded expression. He dragged his eyes to meet Harry’s and aimed the wand at him with this curious tilt of his head. Harry didn’t flinch. He knew enough about wands to know that his own wouldn’t hurt him. And Malfoy wouldn’t also.
Malfoy was panting, running his gaze all over Harry's face, which made him feel very conscious about himself for some reason. He licked his lips nervously and Malfoy's eyes were there the same instant. A shiver ran through Harry.
This imaginary Malfoy stood, tugging Harry up by the arm.
Then, as he lay in the darkness, exhausted after all the smiles and thankful feelings, he let the inner darkness match the one above him. Then he would wait until Malfoy came. ‘I can’t sleep anyway’, he thought. ‘I don’t care if he comes, why should I care, I don’t.’ Then he waited for the soft opening of the door, anyway.
Screams, screams, screams. And the nothingness of death.
Harry just blinked at him.
Madam Pomfrey was nodding. “Yes, Mr. Malfoy, thank you.” Harry turned to her, and she shook her head at Malfoy disapprovingly but good-naturedly, then smiled at Harry. “It’s ok, with the calming potion I’ll give you it’s not going to be that bad. You can also use it to fall asleep easier. Although, please, no more than three days in a row, this potion can be a bit addictive.”
, you don't know anything about nice, Potter. It’s called
Voices. They were harsh and then there was something like laughter. Harry tried hard to decipher them but the door was too thick. Then he suddenly heard a yelp and after that more laughter. He frowned.
Draco drew back a bit with a momentary painful expression on his face, lowered his gaze.
Malfoy just smiled at him with the corner of his mouth but there was a deep sadness in his expression. That was so unusual to look at and Harry didn’t like it one bit. He wanted other unusual Draco Malfoy, the one who laughed without any other meaning except joy. So he scooped up some snow and went straight for the sad face.
“No, it’s not.”
“Thought I heard something,” he told them and closed the door.
Harry stopped at the door to their room. He was just going in for the night, wandering later than usual. He was in a better mood after the walk in the night air, had evening listening to Malfoy, who had apparently started his project in Potions and was intent on developing his own novel draught. He wouldn’t shut up about the wonders of Porcupine quills (at Harry’s blank stare he sighed dramatically, “
Malfoy shuddered and Harry saw him shaking more.
Malfoy didn't even flinch to acknowledge him, he slightly picked up speed instead. No one was here at this time, and Harry thought absently that if Malfoy intended to hex him here it would be pretty perfect circumstances. For some reason, the thought amused him.
“It doesn’t matter, I’m here now. Why would you dream of the Forbidden Forest?’ He frowned a bit but not enough for that little line between his eyebrows that Harry knew well to form.
Harry carelessly shrugged. “Who knows. It is often in my nightmares but now it seems rather nice, doesn’t it?
“I’m a wizard, Potter,” he rolled his eyes. “Do try and think sometimes.”
Harry walked into the Great Hall to the hum of conversations and clicking of dishes with food, the warmth of it and a delicious smell. He didn't notice any of it.
“Well, you know, the usual. I just like flying and he likes snow. We came around.”
“Mr Potter, do you know anything about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?”
Fuck. It was Malfoy. Harry’s heart skipped a bit. The second person spoke.
As he was making his way through the corridors out of the castle, he caught some glances and whispers behind his back. Everyone pretty much knew by this point. He wanted to scratch his skin clean of those stares. His best option was to be alone for a while. He found that he liked to walk for some time in the rare autumn sun on the Hogwarts grounds beside the lake. It was calming and nobody looked at him with pity.
When Malfoy finished he lowered the cup but still didn't look at Harry. Silence stretched for several moments.
"Wha—?"
They didn’t see a lot of Malfoy. After a few days it became apparent that he tried to spend as little time in the room as possible, waking up at sunrise and coming in the evening late as they slept. It was impossible to tell that he lived here at all if not for the trunk half hidden under the bed and his name written on the parchment near the door. Harry knew he was here though.
Harry nodded uncertainly and tore his eyes from Malfoy to his friends, standing from the table.
Harry was getting hot all over, almost feverishly so. Under his shut eyes there were images of something unclear. Draco (...Draco?) tugged at the hair on Harry's nape and this was so familiar... What?
Harry felt interest in spite of himself, looking at her again. Mrs Wright leaned back in her seat and offered him another smile.
The deep, dreamless sleep always tasted like death to him.
Harry bit his tongue just so he wouldn't say that Malfoy was so, so dangerous to him. Malfoy was everything but safe. Of course, Harry knew better than to say so.
Harry looked around their new common room. It was smaller than their old one and there was no particular main colour. Instead, there were little things from all houses, like a couple of circular canary yellow couches, some trophies in emerald green right above the enormous fireplace made with beautiful red intertwined grape leaves within the stone walls and, finally, at the very centre of the ceiling was a big circular pane of glass to see the sky above. The majority of furniture was in warm wooden shades, the thick carpet was dark with chocolatey stripes as a pattern, there were arches near the ceiling and a fancy chandelier. Their dorm was in the East tower, so the windows and the views weren’t really different from what Harry was used to.
, Harry, you should take it more seriously.
“Have you finished the essay for McGonagall? I realised it’s due today only when it was late,” Ron sent a sheepish smile to Hermione, who only huffed and sipped her tea.
The holidays went by too quickly for Harry’s liking. The morning after everyone had returned he was restless at the Gryffindor table. They couldn’t meet the previous evening and Harry couldn’t wait to see Draco again, he got rather used to him during the holidays. Instead of constantly glancing at the entrance, Harry tried to concentrate on the story Ron was telling him about something featuring Percy and his new girlfriend. Hermione was looking at Harry curiously.
Then, “I always loved to be a centre of attention, I guess, and there always was plenty around you.” I say.
“Do you know what a panic attack is, Potter?” Malfoy asked suddenly, a serious expression on his face. Harry was actually a bit grateful and shook his head. Malfoy nodded. “Yesterday. You had one.”
pretty hungry. He nodded again and they went to the Great Hall.
The platform was as busy as ever. Harry found it suffocating. He tried not to look at his friends. Ron was visibly exhausted but tried not to show it. His freckles were a wild spattering of paint stains on his cheeks and nose, his back was rounded as if he carried a heavy weight on his shoulders, which was all more noticeable because of his height. Hermione appeared strong and collected but Harry couldn't help but notice how she leaned closer to Ron, either in support of him or in an attempt to find solid ground herself. At least they didn't talk. Harry wasn't sure if he could manage a steady voice.
Tick-tock.
But he didn’t look at Harry much. Harry realised that before yesterday Malfoy had looked at him a lot because now it all felt off. They didn’t frown at each other at breakfast as usual. When they were leaving for potions and crossed ways Malfoy looked at him briefly with the most indifferent expression, just like the rest of the students near him. Harry had no idea why this felt so wrong, more so than the constant insults and scowls and smirks he was used to.
Harry just stared at the door; in the new silence he thought he heard some noise. He moved a touch closer. From the corner of his vision, he could see Ron and Hermione exchange a look. They stepped up to him with serious expressions the next moment.
“By the sound of it, yes. Basically, a panic attack is a sudden overwhelming sense of fear that has no physical cause. Everyone experiences it differently, but overall, you can feel a faster heartbeat, difficulty breathing, dizziness or nausea and other symptoms.” She searched his face, sympathy in her eyes.
Harry closed his eyes, trying to imagine a smaller Malfoy looking at the stars and getting lost in the height, up and up, so far no one could imagine going, and being scared of that. Harry smiled in spite of himself. It made sense. Harry had been scared of small places when he was a child.
He couldn’t
Harry glanced for a moment and got caught by the view of a small patch of white stomach illuminated by the sharp square of light. It was glowing, as well as some strands of light hair that were tossed around uncharacteristically for Malfoy. It was strangely, inexplicably… endearing. Harry tore his eyes away in horror.
, have you seen him? I don’t remember him looking so bad since the… You know.” It was Ron’s voice.
"Ugh, I can't believe it," Malfoy muttered irritably, "You just can't be a normal person, can you? Can't stop thinking that you’re better than everyone. With this idiotic empty stare on your face, not thinking anyone deserves your attention, huh? I know it doesn't work like that, you’re supposed to forget—"
They haven't met in a while. Harry smiled. “And why do you have to do it so abruptly every time?”
“It is, innit?” You say, hiding that little smile again and looking out into the night. “Why are you here, Malfoy?”
Draco looked at him, not impressed.
There was an understanding pause and Harry almost smiled bitterly. Yeah, that’s what it was. Almost all of them felt the presence of grief, hiding between the lines spoken and looks thrown at each other. The usually cheerful atmosphere of the first Feast was ever so slightly off. The grey enchanted sky shimmered in confusion at the students.
“Good, I don’t see any reason for you to stay here any longer, I’ll give you some calming potions for sleep and you’ll be ready to go.” She turned to Malfoy. “I presume you’re out of the calming draught I gave you earlier?”
The noise coming from the bushes on the edge of the clearing reached Harry and he turned, opening his eyes. All the colours were too faded and grey after the warmth of the sun under the eyelids, and Harry blinked several times. He smiled the moment he recognised the coming figure.
"Potter." Came suddenly behind him, making him jump and Ginny stop mid-sentence.
Harry stiffened. He didn’t want to have a mind healer sent just because he had a small panic attck for fuck’s sake. Madam Pomfrey seemed to understand.
Harry didn’t fall asleep as fast as he usually did.
When Harry saw the wand pointed at him, he didn't even have a moment to feel surprised.
“The Hogwarts Express in sixth year?” I try. I remember talking then.
He often couldn’t sleep for hours and then at some point the door would open silently and there would come soft footsteps as Malfoy made straight for his bed and shut the curtains. Harry stared into the inky darkness above, breathing deep as his thoughts buzzed. When Malfoy came and his breath went quiet with sleep, everything would become quiet in his head. Harry could finally sleep.
And... Well, you chuckle. Quietly and a bit warm, maybe? Oh god, you
“Harry, are you sleeping fine? I can ask Madam Pomfrey for more calming potion, you look gloomy today.”
Suddenly Harry couldn’t breathe. Everything he tried so hard to ignore, to push down, everything was flashing before his eyes. The dead on the floor in the Great Hall, the exploding wall right behind Fred, the faint smile on his dead face, the fiery beasts roaring in his ears, the smell of suffocating smoke, the cold light of the killing curse, his mother’s smile and the burning Sorting Hat on Neville’s head—
Harry felt exhausted. He didn’t hear anyone anymore, just a faint hum of healing magic in the air. It was soothing and he fell asleep slowly one more time.
“Took you long this time.”
Then Malfoy turned to look at him again several feet away.
"Okay, I'll tell you." Harry crossed his arms on the chest, partly to hide his surprise, "I assure you it's not something dangerous."
“Yes, you did! Malfoy, what the hell,” you laugh. “I should’ve known, really! Ginny was awkward then, sure, but she wouldn’t have written me a song that was that awful! What was it? Something how my eyes are like a frog? Oh my god.” You laugh harder and I think I’ve never heard anything more amazing.
During the holidays the storm came and they were unable to get outside as much. At first, it was unfamiliar, to meet that way in the castle but soon they got used to it too. Harry asked McGonagall if Draco could help him work on the ruined corridor Harry was rebuilding. She gave him a curious look and said that they could help each other because Draco himself was working on the part of the castle. Harry could keep the serious face with some difficulty, all he wanted at that moment was to go find the prat and snog him senseless.
“Yeah, sorry I came in the middle of the night, that panic attack was nasty.” He wrinkled his nose, running a hand through his hair. Harry paused at the unfamiliar term.
“This evening sucks,” you say, as I come to stand by your side a few feet away. There’s something quiet — even a bit soft?— in your voice as if you’re just tired and not speaking to your arch-rival or whatever.
Harry didn’t see Malfoy anywhere aside from the Great Hall and the classroom.
Potter, and oh have you heard of, I don't know, the
. Fuck them. I wouldn’t smile at you if my life depended on it.
we’re talking about!” Ron sounded angry. “Do you think he helped out Harry out of the goodness of his heart?”
Malfoy did smile at that, just with one corner of his mouth and so quickly Harry felt that he wasn’t supposed to notice.
The hallway was rather dark and the emotion behind his eyes wasn’t clear. Harry stared back with a strange fascination of waiting to see what would happen next. Ron glanced at him and then back at Malfoy.
Harry smiled lazily and Malfoy flinched, frowning.
In and out, in and out, in…
“Yes, of course,” Draco smirked maliciously. “Stop that.”
“Yeah, you better be,” he said, wrinkling his nose with distaste, “my shoulder hurts.”
Harry felt a stab and everything went blurry again. His breath hitched again in a sob.
?” Ron began to flush slightly from all the arguing, and Harry noticed that there was hardly any colour to him these days. “There’re Slytherins!”
“Not really, but I do think that is a good
He let out a sigh, still staring. Draco was looking at him, frowning.
"Who do you think I am, Potter?" He moved closer, "Some kind of a fan of yours? Some ponce? Faggot?"
“Really, get out of here already.” Malfoy waved a hand at him and Harry frowned. He thought they’d be going to their dorm together, it was pretty late by now. “I wanted to check into the Kitchens quickly, I missed lunch.” He turned away and started to fix his robes.
“You told me to ask another time if we could go flying,” Harry said slowly. “How about this time?”
"I hate you, Potter, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate–"
Finally, he shook his head and turned back.
“The fuck you know what I have to do, Potter.” His voice was surprisingly level and very cold.
“Look where you’re going, Potter,” Malfoy said, raising his nose a little.
“I have a magical map,” he answered honestly and Malfoy snorted.
When they parted, Hermione wiped her eyes quickly and gave him a tentative smile. He tried to smile back.
Harry looked at the setting sun. From this position he could see only pink traces on the sky behind the trees. He wondered if it had settled yet. Malfoy sat at his side.
“What, what—?” Harry heard on repeat coming from the blurry shape of Malfoy.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled and looked down at his own wand. After a moment of hesitation he held it up to Malfoy. “I’m not good at healing spells, so you could borrow mine.”
Harry watched the map closely every time he had a minute. Of course, he tried not to let Ron notice to escape questions and that made it harder. But every time he saw Malfoy either heading to the Quidditch Pitch or already there, Harry would hurry there too if he could.
Harry was grateful she didn’t ask much. Even Ron wasn’t asking him much, he just chatted away on a neutral theme, engaged Harry in the endless rants about how unfair it was not to let eight years play Quidditch, a hot topic right now in their common room. Harry felt a vague disappointment about not being able to play in a team, but he understood why that was. Hermione told Ron the reasoning behind this decision at length, but he just waved her off fondly saying she didn’t understand Quidditch. Then they began bickering as they always did, somewhat good-naturedly and with a high risk of snogging at the end. Harry just rolled his eyes at them fondly and said nothing.
“If you think it's
“Yes, please, I hope you have a good visit, Mrs Wright,” She said.
Harry was grateful for his friends.
“What?” He asked quietly and Harry turned his head to look at him because he expected something more cruel and snarky.
They hurried out of the door, stumbling over each other in the doorway. As their echoed steps faded away down the corridor, Harry stepped closer to Malfoy, who was still on the floor. With the bastards gone, the conjured Lumos had vanished, and it was too dark to see anything. Harry murmured the spell and lowered to his knees on the dusty floor.
“Harry!” She was before him in a moment, hugging him tightly. He hugged her back, feeling better from her familiar embrace. She leaned back and looked him in the eye. “Are you all right?”
He just scoffed seemingly letting the previous question go.
“So full of yourself, Potter?” he asked. “I could curse you and then erase your memories.”
“You know, Potter,” he said abruptly. “The sunset today is early.”
“Why don’t you want to fly?” Malfoy looked at him sharply but Harry continued. “Not that I’m admitting anything but you were quite a trouble for me during a game, you know, I thought you liked flying.”
Malfoy was looking up at him the weirdest way, painfully open but Harry still couldn’t decide what it meant. After a handful of seconds, he started to become more aware of how close they were. Harry moved to let go but Malfoy gripped his wrists.
After an hour of lying in bed in the dorm, Harry heard the door softly opening. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.
The kiss became more frantic and they lost any track of time, clinging to each other in the cold snow, only breaking away to get some air and start again.
“Mhm,” agreed Ron, glancing out of the window as well. Harry tried to listen to Professor Binns.
At first, some tried to follow him and fly together, but it appeared to be very simple to use his Firebolt right and soon they got the message. Ron never tried to push him without an invitation and Harry wasn’t worrying much about the feelings of his most persistent fans.
Harry sighed, drew his wand and cast a warming charm at himself. He shivered with pleasure and sat on the ground. His mind went pleasantly blank as he watched the trees whispering and the surface of the vast lake shimmering, catching the last sunlight. Harry closed his eyes.
“In the dorm with the bag,” he said and it sounded like a challenge. When Harry just frowned in confusion, he sighed again. “What did you think, Potter? That after
“What is the point if we do not exist in reality?” Draco stopped laughing, his voice a little louder than a whisper.
He would come back later and investigate. He felt a rush of excitement and curiosity at the possibility of having something to investigate. Ron and Hermione didn’t ask as they continued the way.
Madam Pomfrey looked at Harry with surprise.
For a moment Malfoy looked at him with an unreadable expression. Then he turned to him and made a step, hesitated, turned away, cursed and looked in Harry’s direction again. After another handful of seconds he made his way to Harry’s bed quickly. Harry lowered his eyelids to appear sleeping, his heart racing and thoughts confused. He still saw Malfoy coming near.
The hallways were mostly empty, bathed in the dim blue light from the windows and the many little warm ones from the torches on the walls. Everything was blurry at the edges and Harry liked it. His quiet steps echoed off stone, the portraits murmuring something to each other. The castle felt so familiar and welcoming. It looked fondly at Harry from the tall ceilings and arches, the stone walls and flickering fires, from its deep shadows in the corners. He let himself walk a bit slower, liking the feeling. It felt like he was looked for, cared for.
“What?”
? Honestly…”). After they parted, Harry had spent some time alone.
Harry looked to the passageway again and felt his throat tighten and his mouth watering. He just managed to turn to the other side before he threw up.
They would meet and Malfoy would begin to talk as though he didn’t need Harry there and just liked the sound of his own voice. He chatted about nonsense most of the time: a strange dream he had once as a child, his timetable or McGonagall’s wardrobe he found weirdly interesting (‘Tartan, Potter,
“He... It will be... I think I’d better go and start to pack my trunk, you know. One week will be over sooner than you know, it's always like that before something...” She stood. “I’d better go. Have a nice evening and don’t forget to start packing.”
Today Ginny told him she loved him and the answer stuck in Harry's throat. When he swallowed the numbness, these words went down to his stomach, causing the heaviness that wouldn’t go away. Ginny didn't say anything but she didn't need to. Harry had enough of voices in his head already.
Ron just eyed him suspiciously and with some concern but nodded without complaint. Well, Harry really did want to rest from all the attention for a bit but also he wanted to stay because of Malfoy. At their last meeting, Harry asked him if he was going to leave for the holidays and Malfoy said no. When Harry asked why, he kept silent for a long time and then just said that he hated that house. Harry didn’t say anything.
Draco Malfoy stood there, looking at Harry. Harry wasn’t surprised.
“Would you like some tea maybe?” Mrs Wright asked. A tray floated to her and steaming tea poured itself into the two cups. Harry shook his head. Mrs Wright nodded and gestured at the chair opposite hers. “Please sit, Mr Potter.”
“Of course. Wake up. I will wait for you in the next dream,” he blinked and one tear rolled down the pale cheek. At the same time, the first drop fell from the sky, shattering on Harry's cheek.
“Harry,” Draco said suddenly, with surprise. “I guess you’re ‘Harry’ now, aren’t you. That’s strange. Harry.” He looked thoughtful but kind of pleased.
Harry moved his head away and tried the handle. When the door didn’t budge, he murmured, “Alahomora,” and it clicked open quietly. He opened the door a tiny bit, trying to see something through the gap. His heart raced.
The audience starts to whisper and I watch you go. A rather nice back, yours. Not that I will acknowledge that to... anyone, really. I wouldn’t acknowledge that to myself, pity I have to deal with my thoughts, I think them, unfortunately.
“Come on, Potter, Madam Pomfrey would know what—” Harry stumbled on his legs and Malfoy caught him around his middle.
"You hate me," he murmured almost inaudible, clutching Draco's hair.
? Who I am? I feel equally undeserving and greedy for your attention for a second. And the next: the last part wins. I always felt entitled to your attention, and so far I haven’t been proven wrong, have I?
After several long seconds of stubborn silence Malfoy looked away, frowning deeply. Harry didn’t mind the silence that much, he just had a feeling that Malfoy did. Finally, after another bit Malfoy sighed irritably, grimacing.
It was a feeling strangely welcoming, in a way that was never fully understood. Nonetheless, it kept coming.
Somewhere in a space between the 8th second and the 10nth, you come close enough to talk. I feel drunk, smirking at your faintly annoyed and hard expression. People are looking.
Harry was sick of it. He simply couldn't do it anymore. And he knew it wasn't doing him any good but, against his better judgment, he just wanted everyone to back off. He was sick of the "you-need-to-talk-about-it"s and the "you-should-share-with-us-Harry"s and the "we're-your-best-friends-don't-you-trust-us"s. Of course he trusted them. His two best friends meant a world to him; they’d literally gone to hell and back together. He trusted them with his life. But just couldn't bring himself to say a single meaningful word.
Madam Pomfrey glanced up at them from the bedside of a small girl who wore a pained expression. Pomfrey murmured something to her reassuringly and walked to them.
I fear for a second that you can read my mind (or my thoughts were entirely too loud) because you flick your eyes at me again. Oh, I’m sorry if you indeed are reading my mind: it’s a fucking mess right now. But again, isn’t everything?
"Yeah, you know," he nearly whispered.
he thought distantly. Harry turned to the sun and closed his eyes with the bliss, letting warm red shapes dance under his eyelids. He listened to the clock, with his luck there was very little time. But for now, he let himself to relax, feeling the tickles of the grass on his wrists.
He was nearly growling now, closer and closer, taking Harry's face into his hands, grey eyes growing darker, becoming the shade of the stormy cloud, one that seems so heavy with rain it feels almost dangerous. The danger was so obvious, so sharp and fresh, Harry felt alive with the energy, he hadn't felt that way for a long time.
Malfoy smirked at him bitterly. “Ah, I’ve got the honour of welcoming the Saviour himself to the wonderful world of panic attacks, how lovely. Yes, you’ll probably have more, although they can be rare. Not all of them are as bad as yours yesterday though. I’ve had many and only a few like that. Usually it’s just a feeling of intense anxiety.” He finished with another smirk.
came about?” Ginny was the first to ask with a hint of laughter.
the world to me! I just feel like you’re waiting for something I can’t give. At least not yet.
“Good morning, boys.” She walked to their beds. “Mr. Potter, I hope you’re better? Mr. Malfoy.”
Hermione huffed in frustration, clearly not sure how to object to that.
At some point during this month, for some reason Harry couldn’t imagine, he’d started to find comfort in Malfoy coming back for the night, and it was just so pathetic. He closed his eyes and then opened them instantly, not wanting to fall into the darkness.
Harry couldn’t find in himself the want to bite back as he always did. And it was the first time he and Malfoy spoke in months, he didn’t want it to be the usual snarky remarks that didn’t mean anything anymore.
As soon as he walked into the common room alone (Malfoy said he wanted to talk to Madam Pomfrey more) he saw Ron and Hermione sitting together closely on a couch, deep in conversation. A couple of Ravenclaw girls were chatting on the other side of the common room. It was relatively early Monday morning and breakfast hadn’t started yet. The room seemed quite cozy with the light streaming in from the circle of glass in the ceiling. Hermione noticed Harry and leaped to her feet.
Ron stared in disbelief and Harry heard Draco breathe in sharply. Harry felt like they both had a lot of questions and a pang of guilt went through him at the thought that he couldn’t give them. He doubted that, even if he spoke to Ron, he would be able to explain what was happening with Malfoy. They seemed to be making some kind of… friendship?
After some digging in his trunk, he found an old piece of parchment and unfolded it.
Malfoy’s blond hair glowed faintly under the line of light seeping out from the slight gap between their door and a wall. It was golden.
He didn’t expect that to get even worse after a few days.
He looked out of the window for god knows which time and that was when he saw the first fluffy snowflakes floating gently from the sky. It was the first snow in a while. He didn’t mind some if it wasn’t bad, a little snow would be even better: there hardly would be anyone at the Pitch. Harry couldn’t suppress a quick grin.
Harry looked at Malfoy some more and then a thought came to him.
Harry realised they were talking about him. He suddenly didn’t want to listen.
Malfoy started coughing and Harry didn’t like the sound of it one bit. He flinched, looked around for some rubbish on the floor. He found an old quill, quickly transfiguring it into a cup and casting an Aguamenti. He held it out to Malfoy, half expecting for him to knock it out of his hands. But he sat up and took it, not looking at Harry. His hands shook violently, spilling some water on the floor. Harry sat back and waited. He had no idea what to say.
For some time, they looked at each other. The setting sun coloured Malfoy’s hair slightly pink and gold. The sharp shadows made his nose and chin look even more pointed than normal. There was a slight line at the side of his mouth, as if he smirked entirely too much to one side.
