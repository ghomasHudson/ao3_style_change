With a quiet sigh, Scorpius closed his eyes and went to sleep again, hugging his mother tight.
Draco rolled his eyes as he turned to the cupboard. "People make fun of you if you act like a baby."
Draco hazarded a glance at Harry. He didn't seem any different. He was laughing with the children, like nothing was the matter. Like Draco was the only one who had had a tough time sleeping the night before. Damn him. "Breakfast?" Draco asked begrudgingly.
Scorpius rocked forward and hid his face against Teddy's back. What he
"You could have at least
Harry was frustrated as he picked at the sling that held his arm tight. He was frustrated with having to explain himself. Frustrated at his friends for badgering him. Frustrated about last night at the manor. Frustrated with Draco. "It's harder on Scorpius if his face is plastered all over London's rag."
Scorpius raced around the old house, throwing open every door that was unlocked, peering into dark rooms, jumping when spiders scrambled on the floorboards, listening for ghosts, sneezing when he disturbed dust on some of the drop-cloths that covered ancient furniture. This place was amazing! Teddy probably had so many adventures when he grew up here. Scorpius peered out the window that faced the street. In his home, all the windows faced green lawns. The Malfoy Manor was in a wizarding community. But Harry lived among Muggles. Scorpius liked this view more because it wasn't boring at all. Cars would splash by, men and women in hats and mitts would be slipping and sliding over the pavement, the streetlights blinked on, and the sun began to set.
sweet girl, Rosie."
Harry glanced at Scorpius when he didn't make a move to start building his sandwich. "Not sure what you want?"
Draco frowned at Harry's profile. "Yes. Of course. All of it."
Harry closed his eye again while smiling. "It's hopeless."
Draco scooped Scorpius up and rolled onto his back so his son was lying atop him. He never wanted to let go of this precious boy. He hugged Scorpius tight. "I have done bad things," he confessed. "Things you wouldn't like. Things I'm sorry about."
"You are his teacher and I am his
Harry leaned the wet brooms against a wall and walked over. "What?" he sniffled.
"Yeah. Whatever. It's no big deal."
"The point is he thinks Scorpius is some damaged child from a broken home," Draco huffed.
Draco had been right after all. Potter was better suited for the rickety bungalow, three kids, family Quidditch matches, and all that. It was about time they came to their senses and carried on with their lives. The rude awakening wasn't entirely necessary, but it is what it is. What is done is done. As always, Draco would put the past far behind him. He was good at that.
"Eager to catch malaria, are we?"
Draco stumbled to a halt at the bottom of the stairs. He took a moment to survey the damage. Then laughter bubbled up in him and burst out.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Whenever he was around Malfoy, he was put in a situation where he either had to fight or run, so, as a conditioned response, adrenaline was pumping through him. "I don't know what you are talking about," he said with as much calm as he could muster.
"I can't help it." Scorpius patted Draco's arm. "Do you like Harry a lot?"
"It doesn't matter. Why does that matter? What's done is done."
"Hey now," Gabrielle frowned as some of the children laughed.
"Hmm?"
"Who told you that?"
"It's your star," Scorpius told him. "Harry and Gabrielle said we did a very good job with the tree, so I got a star and you got a star. Isn't that nice?"
Harry caught himself on the doorjamb before he could trip over the threshold. He looked at once contrite and bemused, wide-eyed and slack-jawed. "I don't... uh... I mean, is there more?" he stammered.
Draco scoffed.
"I'm all clean now, see?"
Astoria was coming into town!
Harry laughed. "Fair enough." He tossed the grass aside. "I never liked him in school."
Ron did notice Harry's averted gaze. "Do you see him at school much?"
He looked up at Harry, searching the teacher's face to make sure there were no signs of condescension. Once he was satisfied with Harry's genuine smile, he looked at his picture to inspect it. "Okay," he said with a polite nod, which only caused Harry to smile wider.
"Nanna."
Scorpius spotted his parents at that moment. His parents stood out from all the other parents in the room, the way they dressed and walked and talked. They were very beautiful. His mother wore a pretty green dress, her hair fell in curls down her shoulders. His father had a black suit on. None of the other dads wore suits. They weren't difficult to spot. He stifled his excited gasp just barely and a bright flush crept up his cheeks. He managed a smile when Astoria waved at him. He was really scared now. His mind was racing with worst-case scenarios. What if he forgot all the words? What if he started coughing? What if he sang so badly that everyone else stopped singing? He wiped his clammy hands on his pants. This wasn't fun at all. Why did he have to remember four songs? This wasn't fair! He was just a five-year-old boy! What if he became stupid all of a sudden?
At half-past eight, when Scorpius returned with his haul to the manor, Harry in tow, and the front door opened again, Draco seemed composed and much less displeased than when they had left him. Scorpius was glad. He couldn't wait to show Draco all the candy he had gotten. "Dad! Dad! Dad!" His makeup had rubbed off around his nose and mouth, green mixing with red to make a muddy brown. The severed foot was now in Harry's hands because Scorpius needed all his strength to drag his enormous pillowcase around. He displayed the loot inside. "Look at this! Can you believe it?!" He could hardly believe it himself. "Rose was a princess and Hugo was a bee and Louis was a pirate and I was the scariest of them all!" With some effort he dropped the pillowcase at Draco's feet. "I won't eat them all. I'll share with you and Nanna and my friends." He couldn't wait for school tomorrow, so he could trade his candy away. "Next year, I want to be a dragon." He scratched his itchy nose, then his itchy cheek, then his itchy neck.
"No. Not at all," Draco yawned. Harry sat beside him, and they watched the two boys for a few minutes. Then Draco said quietly, "I don't think Teddy likes me much."
"Hmm. Is he downstairs?"
"Maybe he didn't like the drawing."
Meanwhile, Scorpius was just
Scorpius didn't hear a word of Harry's excuses. "Yeah! Come over, Harry."
"Of course, of course," he said. "Administration is piling on a ton of new policies on us. That's been a bit frustrating."
Then he cringed and shivered while squeezing his eyes shut.
"In a bit," Harry grumbled.
She ended up flat on her back on the foyer with children crawling all over her, showering kisses and hugs on her. "Oh, alright, alright," she laughed at their exaggerated displays, "You can open my luggage." Yet
with your love life."
"Thank you." That's exactly what Scorpius wanted to hear.
"Worst part is..." Draco started to say before trailing off.
"Aw, come on. I just wanted to go sledding."
Scorpius quickly hid his face against Patricia's sweater.
"I'm pretty sure you'll hate me if I change my mind," Harry guessed correctly as he piqued a brow.
Draco was taken aback by the sudden questions. Scorpius had hardly spoken more than a few words to him over the past few days, only to start now. He was watching Draco closely. As though waiting to hear something important. It was unnerving and Draco tsked, "You're being difficult." Although he had said that, he was glad that Scorpius was being difficult. A difficult Scorpius was similar to normal Scorpius. He got up while swishing his wand to darken the room. "Goodnight."
"I didn't!" Harry held up the wine. "See?"
Scorpius slapped Harry's hand away.
"You just don't understand." Scorpius pushed Draco back and scooted away from him. "I'm going to have breakfast." He hopped out of bed without further fanfare.
"That's brilliant."
"No."
"He's a Malfoy, alright," Harry replied. "He charmed them half to death. What did you expect?"
"No."
Why couldn't he get Malfoy out of his mind?
getting your grubby hands on it."
to sleep.
Scorpius was a ball of nerves as soon as he realized that he was finally hovering two feet in the air. He had never gotten this far before. In fact, he had only left the grass once with Draco helping him, and it had ended with him in frustrated tears because Draco just wouldn't stop pestering him about the way he sat on the broom or how his elbows shouldn't be locked or the position of his head. It had all been too much. But now here he was, actually hovering two feet in the air.
"Scorpius hasn't said anything incriminating… yet." Theo hugged Scorpius reassuringly. "Harry doesn't have a mother or father anymore. But he used to, when he was a little baby."
"-surely you'll find someone you want to spend time with, maybe when Scorp goes off of Hogwarts. You wouldn't tell him even then?" Harry wondered. He scooped a bit of stew with the spoon and offered a taste to Draco. "What do you think?"
The front page of The Quibbler showed a photo of Ginny Weasley on the red carpet, holding an award in one hand, and draping her other arm around Harry Potter as they smiled cheerfully. Dressed to the nines in evening wear, they posed with practiced ease as flashes went off in rapid succession from various photographers behind the velvet rope. When Ginny whispered something into Harry's ear, he laughed. And the moving picture restarted, Ginny once again draping an arm around Harry as they smiled.
Draco's jaw dropped. Witnesses? "Who?!"
"Now that's definitely a change from last year," Draco muttered. Last year, Scorpius had been a nervous wreck, about to start kindergarten, not wanting to leave his precious Nanna, crying into his pillow. This year, the boy was practically bouncing in anticipation. Draco had to talk him out of wearing his first-day-at-school clothes to bed.
"You. It's you, Potter. You are my problem. You have always been the problem."
"You'll trip, Scorpius," Draco chided. "Come here."
Harry smirked as he held his cup close, treasuring it while he shuffled into the bathroom. He looked worse for wear. His hair stuck up every which way, his eyes were red and droopy, and his stubble made him look his age. He splashed water on his face and attempted to smooth his hair by running a damp hand through it. It didn't help much. After freshening up as best he could, he made his way downstairs to the kitchen. The manor looked different in the morning. With the curtains thrown open, there wasn't any need for artificial lights. It was organically lit, making everything glow white. The shimmering chandeliers cast dancing rainbows on the walls. Harry paused at the foyer to look up. It really was beautiful in there.
"You shouldn't indulge him like this."
"Of course I need to worry."
Theo had been watching his best friend the whole time, trying to discern his expression. All he saw was impassiveness. He was disappointed. "Rather obvious publicity stunt," he remarked, to see if he could get a rise out of Draco. He was met with nothing as Draco simply continued to nurse his drink. Theo clicked his tongue and tossed The Quibbler on the table without further fanfare. "It'll work."
"Really?"
Meanwhile, Harry and Draco were seated in the living room. They had finished up with their pleasantries, leaving them with little else to talk about, so an uncomfortable silence was starting to encroach.
Without thinking, Draco reached out to stop Harry. His warm hand slid over Harry's chilled palm, cold from the harsh wind outside. Their fingers entwined.
"What?"
"More than anything."
Hugo giggled and hid his face against Hermione's neck, like he knew that he had done something mischievous.
Teddy jumped off the sofa and parked himself in front of them with his hands on his hips. "I'm Harry Potter," he announced, pushing his imaginary spectacles up his nose. "I like to blow up my kitchen because cleaning up is
"I don't know."
Memories flooded back into Draco's mind.
Draco glanced at Harry, who had his head down, picking at a loose thread on his sweater. Strange thing to admit. Draco reached for the platter of cookies.
Draco was a bit embarrassed by his streak, especially when it came to matches against Potter. He didn't want to tell his son the whole truth. "Well, I have lost a few games, but I've won a fair share too."
Scorpius flicked his eyes from Hermione to baby Hugo who was held against her hip. "Thank you," he responded for the lack of anything else to say.
"Don't scare Scorpius. Give me your hand, Potter."
Harry got up off his chair in a huff. "Because you haven't said a word all morning." He folded his arms across his chest. "I knew it. I did something stupid last night, didn't I?"
Teddy bit back the rest of the speech he had prepared. Instead, looking at the miserable look on Harry, he went in for a hug. He let Harry squeeze him tight. "Don't be sad, okay?" He rubbed Harry's back. "This is such a silly thing to be sad about."
Rose giggled as Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. "That kid's a heartbreaker," he complained. "I would keep an eye on him." Harry laughed it off.
Scorpius clenched his jaw and looked away firmly.
"Then don't waste my time." Draco pushed Harry off of him and rolled out of bed. "Like I said, I can listen and get dressed." These evening rendezvous were beginning to get out of hand. Third time this week Draco had lied to Scorpius about working late. It left a bad taste in his mouth. But rather this than trying to explain to his son that he was having a tryst with Harry Potter. Draco buttoned his trousers and realized that Harry hadn't said anything in a minute. He looked back at the bed where Harry was watching him. "What am I supposed to listen to?"
"This idea is a good one, right?" Harry was pretty pleased with himself. "You worry too much. Before you start worrying, you should talk to me. I'll solve your problems like this." He snapped his fingers. "Teddy will be home for spring break. We're on it. You can count on us."
Scorpius kept laughing. What a hoot! Silly Harry. That would be the day.
"Just until we figure things out, that is."
"Any book."
"Wh-what?" Draco and Scorpius stammered in unison.
Scorpius wrinkled his nose.
Loud enough for Potter to hear.
Why had he run to Potter at the first sign of trouble? He cursed his instincts. Why was it always Potter? He screwed his eyes shut as humiliation crushed him from the inside. He just wanted to curl into an insignificant ball and disappear through a crack in the wall, never to be heard from again.
"Don't be silly." Patricia waved him off. "You two set the plates. Dinner will be ready soon."
"Hmm?" Draco answered as he opened the front door of the Malfoy Manor.
"Well, you have been a very brave boy."
"Oh, he did, did he?" Theo threw a curious look at Draco before returning his attention to the chattering boy in front of him. "I thought Harry only taught the little brats."
they walk away? It felt strange to think like that, pulling away from Ginny with a finality. Won't he always wonder... what if?
"There's this thing that Luna says. I figured I might give it a whirl."
“You did give me this necklace,” Harry mentioned, gesturing to his chest where the chain hung.
“Really? I wasn’t sure if just ‘hanging out’ was your thing.” Harry propped his arms upon the fence bordering the arena. “I’ve always reckoned you to be - you know. The fancy dinner date type.”
Harry immersed himself in volumes about the Unforgiveable Curses, which was no small feat since those particular titles were weighty tomes at least six inches thick. Armed with a signed note from Professor Dahlia, he checked out so many Dark Arts books from the Restricted Section that Madam Pince kept shooting him suspicious glares over the edges of her glasses.
Professor Dahlia had cleared the space just as she had done for the boggart, stacking the desks against the wall. But this time, there was no cabinet, only empty polished wood floor. The thirteen students shuffled in apprehensively, dropping their schoolbags by the wall. The professor herself hadn’t yet arrived, which no one considered odd; Professor Dahlia was the tardiest of all the Hogwarts teachers, but none of her students complained much about the classes being shortened by a few minutes.
Draco bristled. “I’m being careful.”
“Sorry, but I promised Dad I’d be back before dusk,” Luna said dreamily. “We’re going to clear the Nargles off the plums.”
died in her throat as she felt blood seep onto her sleeves. “Oh, shit.”
Perhaps it was that philosophy that kept Joey from shedding tears for a stranger, no matter how precious her life had been.
“I haven’t seen this place before,” Harry said, trying to make conversation.
“Malfoy?” He called, his voice no longer echoing through the room. “Malfoy, are you okay?” In the few moments of silence that followed, Harry’s heart jumped into his throat.
” He cried, and the unconscious beast rose into the air. Already, Draco felt himself tiring from the amount of magic he was exerting.
A bit woozily, Harry stood up and offered his hand to Draco, who took it and stood as well, then let go under the pretense of brushing the snow off his clothes.
As the wounds began to close, his brain short-circuited.
The Room of Requirement’s magic had not diminished since the last time Harry had visited. The room was small but cozy, with a fire flickering in one corner to drive away the castle’s chill. A simple, woven rug warmed the cold stone floor. Directly opposite the door was a window seat, covered in red and green cushions, set in an alcove. The view from the tall window would have been impressive, displaying the grounds, but persistent rain clouded the glass.
“I was protecting a child from his own mistakes!” Caroline bellowed in Igbo.
“How is she?” Hermione inquired.
Draco’s face was dry, but Harry could feel him shaking when Draco gathered him in his arms. Harry was couldn’t even be embarrassed as he wept into Draco’s shoulder; he was somehow relieved to let it all out. Hands gripped his shoulders with a firm comfort. Draco’s lips moved almost soundlessly, telling him, it’s okay, I’m here, Harry, you’re safe now.
“Have ye been listening ta me, wain? It’s my real name for the purposes a this wee operation.” Charon suddenly launched into a heaving coughing fit, lifting his cloak to his face, and the three young wizards jumped in surprise. He took a moment to breathe, rather wheezily, then continued speaking. “Bad air down here. Nothing ye wains hafta worry about, ye got young lungs. Now shift it.”
“Because I’m Harry Potter, or because we’re together?”
Breakfast passed with a peaceful mundanity, the smell of cinnamon, eggs, and black pepper drifting from the enchanted plates. Luna did most of the talking, describing an encounter she had with a thestral that weekend, her flow broken only by Hermione’s skeptical questions.
“Where are you off to?” Hermione said innocently.
Draco’s wide eyes are accusing. “How do you know my middle name?”
“Commander Connors?” Draco panted disbelievingly. He arrived just as Connors slashed through the ropes binding Harry. The cut on his forehead was bleeding; Draco was sure it hadn’t been before.
"It's possible." Harry adjusted his glasses, then remembered something Draco had said to him at the funeral. "Malfoy told me that he's better with written words. He said, basically, that he speaks without thinking, but writing letters conveys his thoughts better."
Draco’s jaw clenched, then his expression morphed to confusion. “Likely?” He echoed. “Have you been given a sentence?”
“Some people are gathering already. There’s something we need to take a look at.”
“No. No, I didn’t…”
In a gap between a curry noodle stand and another that only sold tassels, a woman wearing sunglasses lit a cigarette. At the moment she placed it between her lips, Harry threw out his arms, stopping both his colleagues. His hands were shaking.
“A week.” Draco paced the carpet, wand flicking as he wordlessly dictated a parchment and quill to scribble a list. “Seems like a lot of prep time for a short mission. It makes me nervous.”
“Final document,” Harry declared around eleven-thirty, sliding the packet towards him. “Hell, I could use a drink. You?”
“That’s not fair.” Harry reaches for him, but Draco’s image flickers, and he reappears a few feet away. “You did this to me first!”
“How did you know?” he asks hoarsely.
“I don’t take it off.”
Draco made a face at his companion and crossed his arms in a gruff manner. Harry noticed that his shoulders were tense with cold, but he decided not to say anything.
“That’s not comforting,” Draco mumbled, gripping his mug so tightly that his fingers turned snow-white.
The woman, face hidden in the shadows, beckoned with an arm wrapped in loose, autumn-colored cloth. “I am who you are looking for,” She said musically and disappeared through the opening.
A silver glow lit up the dark of Commander Connors’ office. Joey was surprised by how easy it was to get in, but the wards didn’t differentiate the time of day. It sensed the magical signatures of known Aurors and let them right in.
Harry nods, a quiet joy blooming in his chest when Draco rests his head on his shoulder. This is the present, Harry reminds himself, no matter how fabricated it may be. He’s determined to make the most of this, the hidden paradise they’ve carved out for themselves, for as long as he can.
“I’m not going anywhere near your mouth until you gargle something minty,” Harry promised. He slunk an arm around Draco’s waist, pressing his lips to his jaw instead, trailing light kisses down his neck, sending butterflies racing through Draco’s body.
“Probably the latter,” Ginny said reasonably. “Oh, well. Worth a shot.”
“Nigeria has a lot of wilderness to hide in. But sooner or later, they find you.” She swallowed.
Luna has torn herself from Padma’s arms, and now runs outside, coat hastily thrown over her shoulders. Up ahead, Justin strolls briskly through the falling snow, head bent, face tucked into his scarf.
Harry sniffed. “I’m sorry.” He repeated.
This chapter begins to set the stage for the next part of the ABYS saga - that may not be written for a while yet! Though Harry and the rest are still at Hogwarts, I couldn't resist a little indirect worldbuilding for wizarding England. Also, that was the first time I wrote out a Daily Prophet article :)
“Simple yet effective,” Harry replied with a grin. A drop of water slid down his temple and dripped off his chin, pink from the blood smeared on his forehead. “Let’s go.”
“I’ll go,” Harry said firmly. “Draco?”
A feeling of dread slid over Harry like a slimy blanket. “With who?” Silence. “With
The look in Draco’s eyes was comparable to a caged animal. Harry could feel the tension in his body without even touching him.
Joey’s brow furrowed. “Where…”
∞ ∞ ∞
“Come closer,” She said, turning to the two boys. “They won’t bite, so long as you don’t put your hands near their mouths.”
“Your optimism is astounding,” Draco said with a raised eyebrow, though his tone sounded more impressed than sarcastic.
“Bedtime already?” Ron murmured sleepily, “Fancy a game of chess…?” He drifted off and yawned hugely.
“Ri-ight.”
“Flying makes me warm.” Harry draped the robes over his arm and continued walking. “You could’ve gone back to the castle if you’re cold.”
But when he reached the window, all the tension faded from Draco’s body. Dazzling, colorful patterns and wheels of light rocketed into the sky, the dying sparks falling towards the city below. The streets were filled with people, tiny and doll-like below them, necks craning, and mouths open in awe as they watched the show. The cold ribbon of the Thames in the distance glittered in the light, and it looked like as if it was filled with gems.
Harry chose that moment to cut in.
Harry stopped Draco leaving and hugged the man to his chest – to hell with masculine or pureblood expectations. “It’s okay.” Harry patted his back, holding him closer than was probably necessary. “Draco, whatever you say here, stays here alright. Besides, you have blackmail over me now you know.”
Harry heard as he entered the hospital wing Tuesday Morning, greeted with the scene of a furious Draco shouting at Madam Pomfrey… again.
I also wanted to thank everyone for the lovely, amazing comments you have all left.
“I can do other spells Potter.” Draco defended himself, but come to think of it… all the spells he knew wandlessly
Harry: "We're really okay then?"
And when Mr graves had finally left, Minerva had to inform the stressful house elves that they could now begin clear up, and had to admit that tomorrows lessons had to be cancelled.
A few minutes later – after a pep talk to himself in the bathroom mirror whilst washing his hands, Harry returned to the main room.
“We know sir,” Lilium said, “but it’s still a shame that it is over already. The day went rather quickly; I feel as if I’ve just woke up.”
He suddenly remembered what his own therapist had said about him – something about his own childhood being deprived by his treatment of his aunt and uncle, his isolation and lack of normal childhood activities and experiences having shunted his development ... and not just physically.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle. If Draco could be like this more often ... then he would certainly give him a chance. Draco just had something about him that he was attracted to. He could love this side of Draco.
Draco just shrugged, and continue his pudding without a care in the world.
Tau and Padfoot weren’t ready to met yet. He would come clean with Draco, eventually, but for now he had to know if Tau liked Padfoot enough to meet him, and he had to know if he stood a chance with Draco as himself … as Harry.
-Saturday 23rd, Harry sits with Draco at the Slytherin table, confident, with a look to anyone that dared to say anything. People finally start to accept what is obviously inevitable.
-Eyes of hate, malice, and scorn followed Draco as he exited the 8th year common room. Walking slowly, and woefully to the courtyard.
Harry muttered, as he and Draco walked towards the courtyard together. They were going back to their 8th year dormitory to try and find their friends. They had memories of them, and spending time with them, but it was a like a dream instead of reality.
“I didn’t say anything.” Harry held up his hands in a form of pacification, but he still could not contain his mirth. “Can I ask you something though?” He asked a few moments later.
Blaise: "So, whatcha up too? You're not sulking over Potter agian are you?"
“You really like him, don’t you?” Harry asked.
He’d asked Draco how he was keeping, what had made him move to France and then come back to England? Draco had explained; the animosity and hatred both he and his mother had faced - after the war, was the most deciding factor in them leaving the country. Harry understood that, but then Draco had mentioned the night Albus dumbledore was murdered; whatever Draco had said after that fell upon deaf ears - Harry was lost thinking about that night.
-The kiss deepens and Harry's hand finds Draco's hair.
Despite his shock at everything he’d learnt, he blushed again when reading the obvious innuendo of anal intercourse outside in nature, and the accusation that he was ‘demure and humble’ because he preferred to keep his clothes on when outside. He also didn’t want to think about Tau’s – possibly Draco’s - ‘morning trek’, especially not when naked moonlight basking was their last topic of conversation – well, that and absorbing magic from nature while denude of all apparel.
“Mr Bartlett?” Harry said, as they were leaving the hospital wing together.
tell anyone, he would never chastise the boy if he did tell his friends, he just wanted the boy to trust him. Sharing a ‘secret’ was a good way to do that, and for a Slytherin... well, a Slytherin would take the ‘secret’ and use it as a comfort blanket – a sort of ‘I have dirt on my professor’ kinda thing, and it would make the boy feel more comfortable around him. Harry almost shook his head just thinking about how the majority of the Slytherins’ minds worked.
Draco was already there when he'd arrived, and they'd pulled each close. Their lips joining like they needed the others to breathe again. After a while of making out they sat on the dusty floor together - Harry's head on Draco's shoulder.
Smiling as he washed his hair, he imagined what Tau was like to look at. Rinsing his black locks, he wondered what Tau’s hair felt like. What would it feel like to be touched by the man, and were his hands soft like he’d imagined? And Kissing?
They left the Quidditch shop about twenty minutes later with a new broom, gloves, and a broom care kit. Harry shivered as they stepped into the cold, and Draco reapplied their warming charms.
Baby, don't be afraid
only about six o'clock, and he usually stuck around until later in the evening if they weren't overloaded with homework to grade.
If Harry had to guess, with Tau being a pure-blood wizard, he would assume that he’d never had muggle chocolates before. Harry hoped Tau wasn’t a pure-blood that was against all thing’s muggle, seeing he still enjoyed many of the thing’s muggles had to offer. Yes, Harry even had a laptop at home, and he still preferred muggle clothes shops.
“How did you know that?” Harry frowned, helping himself to the chocolate gateau too.
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm
“Dare I ask?” Malfoy drawled again, completely confused, but Harry just started laughing harder.
Harry took Draco’s hand as it went to grab at his sleeve… and it felt
Ron: "She's just trying to make you jealous, she isn't really sleeping with him you idiot!"
One of the house elves had left some honey and cinnamon while Poppy had been treating Draco’s arm. Harry used it to start up a conversation.
serious about Padfoot. Draco was a Slytherin, he had done things that were unforgivable, but he was not a cheat! He would not betray Padfoot without giving the man a chance, without meeting him first at least. Besides, Harry was out of his reach – too good for a Malfoy. For all the words that Harry spoke, perhaps they were just kindness as per the duty of friendship, nothing more.
The door chimed three sickly-sweet tones, and Harry Potter's eyes roamed as he slowly entered Le'Amortentia, tapping a purple and silver voucher against his left hand nervously. Sucking his bottom lip, his eyes widened to better absorb his new surroundings. He wondered then, whether he still had time to change his mind and quickly make his exit?
Harry: *Laughed* "Dray, you idiot. We're getting married. Of course you can bloody live with me you prat. I wouldn't have any other way."
from Draco!
Harry was smiling at him – the same smile that he craved to see, yet at the same time, it was a smile that he wished wasn’t aimed at him because it muddled his well-organised mind. Oh, right… the cracker… Should he? He really didn’t want to give Harry hope that there’d ever been something between them… Oh, but it was a just a bloody cracker! As long as he didn’t have to wear a stupid hat… he nodded.
Draco: "I could ask you the same thing, Potter!"
-Draco's reply on the parchment: 'Perfect!'
It wasn't until the next morning, when everyone was at breakfast, that he went to see if Harry was in his bedroom. He knocked firmly on the door.
Harry was washing his hands at the sink, listening to Draco trying to string his words together. It was actually funny - Draco Malfoy mumbling and rambling.
Baby, do what I say
-Turning with the music, eyes fixed on each other.
“What the fuck do you want Potter? Come to take the piss, have you?” Draco screamed, suddenly brandishing his wand and firing the knockback jinx at him.
Harry’s screams followed him as he awoke; sweating, tangled in the bed sheets, each breath trembling, and the pain he’d felt in the nightmare… reduced to ghost like shivers along his nerves. The terror still had hold of him, a sickness deep in his gut, and his memories fought to substantiate reality.
Draco’s eyes instantly searched the left-over crowd of students. He found one browned-haired student with wide eyes pointing his wand at Harry – Mr Silas Avery! Silas realised that his spell hadn’t worked, and he ran onto the train before Harry even had a chance to turn around.
Harry was looking at him with anticipation in them big green eyes of his. “Thank you, Harry, I will try this out later for certain.” He smiled, but he gratitude just didn’t seem enough – Harry had put a great deal of thought into this quill and journal. He honestly was fascinated by it, in awe, curios, and greatly appreciative … but how did he show that without turning into a Hufflepuff. Then he remembered the gift he had gotten for Harry.
Harry had paused during the writing of the message he had just sent, remembering what he had written in his own profile – the one Tau would have read before accepting him as a secret chérie:
Harry took the list from his pocket and went over them with Draco. He needed the antidote for pixies, blood replenishing potion and bite solution for vampire bats, and several vials of the beautification potion for the red caps he was introducing to the first years. Most of the potions he needed were emergency precautionary measures, but the beautification potion was an effective method to repel red caps.
Perhaps it would be best just to break his promise to Padfoot, to return his parchment and quill, and remove his files from Le’Amortentia… but it hurt to imagine Padfoot’s pain if he should be so callous.
Draco: "Show me!"
Harry chuckled. He hadn't gotten anywhere yet, but this mystery blond man already had him highly interested. Why wouldn't he expect someone to choose him? Not only had he signed up to a dating service, but he sounded sincere and nice enough - even if he had made terrible mistakes in the past.
It took a long shower, and those pressing, unwanted thoughts that plagued you the moment you wanted to sleep. Why did his mind do that – become the most active when he wanted it to shut the fuck up?
Harry froze when he walked into the Great Hall, it was deadly silent and everyone was crowded around something in the middle. Any thoughts he’d previously been having, rapidly vanished from his mind to be replaced by an ominous feeling.
-Draco cuts the ribbon of his new apothecary shop.
“What do you want then?” Draco gave in. His body slumped back in his chair and his mask dropped.
-Harry runs his hands under Draco's shirt.
He turned the page of the heavy book on wizard illnesses – rather fascinated and shocked by the variety of strange diseases and viruses that were out there – and eventually reached a page on Snowflu:
“Kreacher!” Harry called, his stomach feeling empty and uncomfortable, making itself known – he would deal with that first. He hadn’t eaten since his Christmas dinner yesterday evening, and seeing as that came up during the early hours of the morning… his body was obviously desperate for sustenance.
No! He had to focus on something else… someone else! Yes, he had found something quite real and wonderful with Padfoot. His only chance at love lay with the mysterious man behind the parchment. It would work as a distraction – as it had been these past couple of day – but it was also something that was truly promising; he
Harry: "See that's exactly what I'm talking about."
Patronus like images form into wisp and shapes around the room - blue, white, and ghost like. The shape of a child starts to form by the door - its him! Draco's patronus like six-year-old-child-self, standing in the doorway of the living room they're in.
Draco glared at anyone that dared to come too close to them – the man didn't mind crowds per se, but he hated being touched and knocked into. Harry was in the same frame of mind actually, but he had more tolerance for rambunctious crowds when they didn't know his real identity… Yes, they'd never get anything done if they knew their '
affects my job, I think I should familiarise myself with these details.”
Snuggled in bed that night - in Harry's room and top-less, Harry turned to face Draco.
-Harry slumps down against the outside of the shrieking shack, kicking the snow in anger. Then his head falls into his hands.
He hadn’t realised that the pudding had been sent up until he next looked down at the table… his mind rapidly changing from thoughts of Miss Payne to chocolate… in particular, one very luxurious, triple chocolate yule log with chocolate shavings. Oh Merlin! He couldn’t… he shouldn’t… but… it was Christmas!
Harry nodded, suddenly feeling awkward. They’d managed to start up a conversation last time fairly easy, so what was with the uncomfortable silence this time? He tried not to stare at Draco, but he glanced up and smiled as Draco caught his eyes.
By now, Harry was so close that Draco could feel Harry’s breath against his face. He panicked - “It was a mistake!” Draco growled, hoping his expressed anger would mask how much those words hurt him to say. “I don’t want you here! Get OUT!”
As just like that, Draco turned to leave. Harry grabbed Draco's arm to stop it; he don't know why he did it, why he didn't just let him leave, but he was confused. A part of him that would never admit it - wasn't ready to lose the amazing scent that was Draco, it was just so criminally addictive.
Harry was sitting by the Great Lake, holding Ginny Weasley's hand, and facing out across the water. Draco Malfoy wasn't far, with his two best friends Blaise Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. Draco had been climbing the giant apple tree, and he couldn't help but turn to watch him yet again.
There's no way to ring the alarm
-Hands roaming, pulling, feeling until ... they search blindly, but urgently for each other's trouser button. Harry sucking Draco's neck, his collar bone - working his way down, down, down .... jackpot.
“Kreacher can be doing this for master. Anything else?” The elf asked.
“No Draco! You kept you and your family alive. If Narcissa had – if she hadn’t been there to lie to Tom, I might have died and stayed dead. We all have a knock-on effect; we all played a part. Even the terrible things Tom
"You completely lost me at battery and ektricity." Draco said, bemused.
"I'm almost finished here Draco." Harry tried to contain his mirth, unaware of Draco's darkening thoughts. "I just need to pick up Teddy's; I promised Andromeda I'd buy him a new broom."
Harry put down his glass, deciding anything would be better than sitting their staring, and went to the food table. He filled his plate with mini sausage rolls, chicken nuggets, and some stuffed vol-au-vents. He didn’t notice Draco behind him until the man spoke.
There was a knock at the door to his private chambers, the sound pulling him from the depths of his thoughts. He should have been grading papers, but once again he’d gotten lost in his own mind.
"Yes. That about sums it up, yeah. How did you-"
-Harry and Ron busting into the delivery room frantic.
The brown haired, sixth year Slytherin delinquent, brought with him an eerie cloud of dread that seemed to pervade the entire room. He sneered at Draco; his obvious feelings of indignation made apparent, but Draco forced himself to react professionally.
“That’s… thank you Harry. Really, thank you.” Draco blinked as if in a daze. The gift was so thoughtful, and he wondered if the Dragon was just a coincidence. As if Harry had read his mind…
Once he stopped laughing and chuckling, he pulled out the thick parchment with a special black-purple feathered quill. He read the note attached to it which explained that he must only use this particular quill with the parchment - that the ink needed lay inside the parchment itself - no ink was required. Once he had finished his message, he was to draw the Mannaz shaped rune on the bottom centre of the parchment and . The words would instantly send to its partner parchment and would only be readable to the person it was intended. Any received messages could be cleared with the Othala rune and by running the quill feather over it. Only he would be able to read the words on his own parchment likewise - to anyone else it would appear blank.
Harry chuckled. If he ever met this man, he was taking him to a chocolate factory. There was a magical one at Dartmoor national park that he had heard about, hidden from muggles.
-Stood up and threw a tomato at Draco, other students following suit.
Draco: "Have a good Christmas Potter, hope it isn't ... too chaotic for you."
Harry turned the notebook over and waited for Draco to agree or disagree to the oath. But Draco took out his wand and nodded.
. I suppose, it’s the fact that I know they’re something my
“Mr Malfoy! This is a confidential legal matter, and it is against protocol to have a Death Eater present.” Auror Graves spat.
Draco hadn’t expected Harry to give him anything, what with the huge number of people he already had to buy gifts for. He was immensely curious to what his ex-rival would have gotten an ex-death eater, teacher of Hogwarts like himself. He didn’t feel deserving of anything to be honest, not after he’d basically rejected Harry’s obvious interest in him, and then been slightly avoidant of the man’s company these last two days... and of course, the way he had behaved towards the golden boy during their school years. He wouldn’t deny that he had missed Harry’s company though, at least not to himself, not now they had developed a rather wonderful companionship. The gift was unexpected, but it meant something he hadn’t concluded on yet, and it made him feel light and fuzzy that Harry had brought something for him.
“I’ll stay with you.” Harry said, sitting on the bed in an attempt to keep Draco in it. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle though … his mind
“Well, not much can be done about it, the boy turns seventeen sometime in January.” Harry shook his head and sighed, deciding to change the subject. “I came to see if you could brew a few potions I’ll need for my lessons in a few weeks.”
Harry: "I'm not hungry Mione!"
It only took Harry about a minute to enter the Great Hall, notice that Draco wasn’t there, and return to the frightened boy before motioning Samuel to follow him down to the dungeons.
"Watch where you're going, Potter!" Malfoy drawled, his voice was still as clear, as sharp, and as snippy as Harry remembered it, but the tone was lower - deeper, and there was a smooth wrapping to it. In a way, it reminded him of Professor Severus Snape – a great man that had died in the war playing spy for the side against Voldemort, but not a very likeable potions professor.
"Ah, you have a voucher! Perfect!" Malaise squealed at him, smacking him straight out of his rude staring and into embarrassment. "Just drop it into that cauldron and we'll get started!" Malaise pointed to the table in front on him, and he swore she battered her eyes at him – flirting.
With a fresh tea for himself and a new one for Draco, they sat in the long kitchen at the table. Harry admitted he had awoke from one of his regular nightmares about an hour ago.
of January – and that he would not be permitted his wand outside of lessons or unsupervised for the first four weeks of term. Mrs Avery – Silas’s mother – had collected her son’s wand after her meeting with Minerva back on the 19
As he slipped out of his pajamas and climbed into the shower, he hoped that Tau receive his reply well and didn’t think he was playing the aggrieved party. His intention was to show a degree of sympathising, and to show equal willingness to be as open with Tau as he was with him. He’d never been this open with anyone before, he thought, as the warm water ran over his face, and that was both exciting and terrifying simultaneously.
Watching Harry at dinner from across the Hall. Draco is pulling at his bottom lip with his teeth, running his tongue across them, and remembering what Harry's lips taste like. Blaise and Pansy are watching him.
-Wednesday 10th March, Draco on Harry's bed top-less. Harry removes his robes, jumper, and tie - snapping it out suggestively. He slowly advanced to the bed, climbing over Draco, and running his hand down to undo his lovers trousers.
“I know.” Harry sighed in understanding. “You did what you had to do for your family. You expected Dumbledore to see through the cursed necklace, and the poison, to be the great, omnipotent man everyone claimed him to be. You were forced to let the Death Eaters into the school. I know you didn’t
Draco held his mask firmly in place, he didn’t want Harry to know what he was feeling… his desperate hope that Harry
Harry sighed – “I don’t skip meals Draco. I eat in my room. Kreacher brings–”
Harry wondered why Draco was following him back to his rooms, or escorting him back. Something had changed since their failed trip to the Three Broomsticks at the begging of the week, but Harry wasn’t complaining. Draco had started looking out for him during meal times, and he’d even turned up at his door with a plate of food when he’d missed dinner on Wednesday. Draco smiled at him when they passed each other in the hallways, and the man seemed happier to be in his company. Draco had almost become his shadow. The surprising thing about it though, was that it felt right. Draco Malfoy … by his side … felt right!
“For now.” Harry nodded with a side smile.
"Yes, that's right." Harry nodded.
-Stood up and pointed at Draco accusingly.
It felt right, it felt good, and Harry knew it was only a matter of time before he fell in too deep. He could already feel himself falling…
“How do you – what is a…”
Harry: "I'm fine Hermione, the date ... please!"
“Of course, I wouldn’t have agreed otherwise.” Draco smirked. “As long as let me buy you a decent outfit Potter! Call it a Christmas gift if you like, but I refuse to be seen with you Christmas day if you insist on wearing those rags!”
Tau certainly knew how to make Harry think about things he wouldn’t have even considered before. Time felt very really to him: Eleven years of suffering with his aunt and uncle - not including the five awful summer holidays there, fourteen years since he lost his godfather, nearly an entire year living from place to place in a tent – with Hermione and Ron twelve-thirteen years ago, and twelve years since the battle of Hogwarts.
seemed to remind him.
Merlin, there were a lot of maybes. He really should stop trying figure it out before he gave himself an aneurism. It could just be Tau’s belief and nothing more. Tau’s past could easily be something non related to Voldemort, and it was pointless trying to compare Tau to a bloody character in a book.
“I guess you’ll just have to give me another hug then.” The words had left Harry’s lips before his brain had even giving consent, and he turned to busy himself with a fresh batch of coffee.
Harry tapped his fingers, trying to get his mind out of the past. It must have been a good hour before he received Tau’s very short reply.
They arrived at the bank and went down to Harry's vault. Draco was going to stay behind and wait, but the looks he was getting from the other Goblins gave him the shivers so he didn't want be alone.
“Yes well, we can only reduce the pain I’m afraid. No potion will be able to stop the cold flashes entirely.”  Madam Pomfrey explained, she knew that Draco had suddenly regressed in age, again – not something she enjoyed at all. “You will just have deal with it until it passes.”
Draco scratched unconsciously at his arm where the Death mark is. The councilor picked up her quill and started writing, chuckling to herself.
“It’s regarding Mr Avery.” Said Draco, cutting straight to the chase. Minerva’s face fell and she sighed, understanding now why they had waiting till everyone had vacated the room.
Hermione: "He's not worth it Harry!"
-As the sun sets, Draco hovers to take in the scene. Harry suddenly nudges him, before shooting after the Snitch - Draco on his tail.
Once I'm in I own your heart
-Saturday the 5th December: Ginny is in their common room, sitting on Harry's lap. Draco stares at them both angrily.
"You were saying?" Draco drawled, still bitter that their conversation had been rudely interrupted. Harry was so jubilant and joyous today despite the crowds, and even though the man hadn't stopped talking up a storm, he rather enjoyed listening to him; It was good to see Harry so frivolous, instead of over worked and stressed. "About Teddy, and that Hufflepuff have good players this year."
"Ah, right, yeah… erm … he's worried that he won't be good enough to get in. Andromeda only had enough to buy him a second-hand broom, so he only has his Nimbus 2000."
“It is mostly muggle made,” Harry spoke first, quietly and unsure, but it still made Draco jump, “but I managed to get some charms added.”
Images of his parent's death, then of him bolting up from yet another nightmare at Hogwarts.
Harry: "Gin-"
“Relax Draco!” Harry smirked at him.
-Ron beats Draco at chess. Draco goes to shake Ron's hand, but Ron bro punches him instead.
“Blimey Potter -- Harry. That certainly sheds some light on things I’ve wondered for years. Professor Snape had it out for you from day one - everyone could see that, and I always suspected it was more then the fact that you were a Gryffindor.” Draco frowned in thought, sipping his whiskey - his index finger tapping the glass.
“I think my respect for the man just tripled.” Draco breathed. “Do you know how hard that would actually be Potter -- Harry?” Draco lent forward with a frown; his food mostly eaten now.
“What happened in Hogsmeade?” Harry tossed back.
“Why do you want
Deprived childhood? Deprived…
-Thursday 14th. Knocking on Draco's bedroom door. The other 8th years are angry with Harry for different reasons.
As he was about to shut the door to the bathroom behind him however, he bit his lip, peeked his head around the door and looked over at the bed.
Draco looked between his two confused friends. If they really had no memory, maybe Potter didn't remember either.
“Oh, of course Potter!” Malfoy snapped. “I apologise and therefore I must be
Harry: "Did you have something else in mind?"
If you’re still insistent on enduring my company this evening,
-Harry rests his head on Draco's chest.
Ron: "You trust him? What if it explodes? I bet he is just telling you that so he can watch it blow up in our face."
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Harry nodded. Malaise seemed to be covering everything well enough, but he hadn't really listened to Hermione explaining it to him a couple days ago.
They both arrived late to breakfast, after a trip to the infirmary, and both center of attention as they walked into the Great Hall. Harry didn't even say bye to Draco as he stomped to the Gryffindor table - slumping down next to Ron. Most of the Gryffindors knew to be wary of Harry's temper, but not Seamus.
“Kill it! Kill it!” Draco rocked, repeating the same thing over and over as he panted in fear.
Draco went into his mind agian, thinking it over. Then he looked into Harry's green eyes, he trusted him.
“Yes, that’s him. I didn’t hear the entire conversation, but I did hear this: ‘…
-Harry in Diagon Ally, looking at Slytherin scarfs.
The three of them continued to walk to the library to study. It was the first week of school -currently their first Saturday, and they already had homework due for Monday.
Their eyes met - both sets blurry in their struggle to accept the truth of each other’s words. As their eyes continued to hold contact, and Harry could feel Draco’s heart beat beneath his hand, he felt an awkwardness suddenly descend on him like a cold shower – this had become far to mawkish for his taste.
Harry had been so excited last night that he hadn't slept, therefore, he found himself dozing off on the train soon after boarding. Hermione and Ron did't wake him - they were in favor of making out on the seats opposite, however, Harry woke with a start from images of dead Hogwarts students - Hermione and Ron instantly in caring friend mode.
Harry: "No! Definitely not!"
He gulped down the last of his coffee, staring disappointedly down at his empty cup. “Kreacher!” He called.
You thought an angel swept you off your feet
“W’atsit?” Draco mumbled into the ombre green rug – between the black leather sofa and the antique black coffee table – his voice horse and weak.
Harry resigned himself to the fact that It was going to be a very long night, but he also decided, he wasn’t going to give up on Draco.
“Like I said, make sure he stays in bed and keeps warm. I shan’t be long.” Madam Pomfrey then made her leave, leaving a clueless Harry alone with a sick Draco.
Harry had stuck to her side, helping her at every turn one he’d returned Mr Leonard to the Gryffindor tower. He still felt guilty though. It was rather obvious that someone had spiked his drink while he’d been dealing with the altercation between Oscar, Cain and Mercia. If Draco hadn’t bolted from the Great Hall when he had - to paint the corridor in the lovely shade that is regurgitated chocolate brownies, then he would have finished his drink and the poison would have gone to him instead of an innocent student. He should never have left his cup unattended. Stupid!
Enjoy!
Harry: "Come on then!"
Harry: "That's it?"
“I got you something too,” Harry admitted with a small smile. He went to his bedroom to collect the large book sized gift.
“Mr Oscar Haines correct?” Harry guessed, and the Slytherin first-year nodded.
Something's familiar
Harry: "Yes. Yes, you prat! I'll marry you whenever you're ready."
Harry leaves his therapy session - Tuesday the 1st December at 4pm, and gets intercepted by Draco on the way out.
His first reaction was to apologize, let her know he wouldn't be coming back to the Burrow, and that he never meant to hurt Ginny. He was quite surprised when she stopped his ramblings with a tight hug, and told him he was being stupid.
“This is 12 Grimmauld Place, the
“What is said here, stays here?” Draco clarified slowly, as if confirming that fact and reminding himself of Harry’s words.
“Day dreaming of anything interesting this time sir?” Lilium Zabini smiled, eyebrows wiggling suggestively. Lilium was just like her older brother Blaise Zabini. He had met Blaise a few times regarding his sister, as their mother wasn’t too willing to be involved in her daughter’s schooling. Blaise was just as out spoken, loud, and brazen as Lilium was.
Pansy: "Don't mind him darling. Come, I want to talk to you before we leave – seeing as you won't stay with me over the holidays."
And yet so far
He found himself removing the now soaked bandage. The scratches had healed leaving the faded dark mark glaring up at him, and the old scars reminding him. Nothing had been able to remove it, and Salazar had he tried, he was forever left with a brand that whispered and screamed in torment – the ghostly voices of his victims of torture, the victims he had witnessed murdered, the echoes of his past. He still felt the phantom pain of being called to Voldemort’s side. All the wrong that he committed, all the mistakes and regrets of his past… it was forever there for the world to see…. There for him to never forget!
Pansy: "Draco darling, no one was singing. I think an apple must have fallen on your head."
About these strangers like me
Draco: "What?"
“It’s obvious. You’re disappointed the elves didn’t send up any treacle tart.” Draco chuckled and shook his head, popping the spoon of chocolate gateau into his mouth.
Harry: "Soon we'll be leaving. it doesn't feel real."
Madam Pomfrey used her wand to silence the two you men, threatening to bind them to their beds if they didn't behave. Eventually she left.
Draco walks slowly over to his window and looks out at the now grey sky.
Harry: "Genialclen."
Molly: "Draco Malfoy?"
As he stood up, letting the blanket hit the floor, he took two paces before throwing his half empty cup across the room. The broken shards of china representing his life, his heart… and the coffee that dripped down the wall onto the carpet mimicked his tears.
"Right." Harry nodded, noticing the growing sting of his eyes.
Harry answered many questions after that, and they were a lot easier: height, hair colour, eye colour, physique, and then some stranger questions like: One sentence that your closest friends might use to explain you? What are you passionate about? What is your ultimate goal in life?
facilities.” Draco warned playfully, but Harry could sense the man’s nervousness.
Draco: "You're going to scream my name Potter."
D.Malfoy.’
Blaise: "I could have sworn-"
It took Harry two seconds to think, and then, “Accio, Mr Avery’s wand.”
“Well done! Yes. I would say, navy blue with a slight lean toward indigo. Maybe you should familiarise yourself with a more extensive range of colours, it will help you with your homework when you need to state the given colours of a potion at various stages of brewing.”
It was stupid, he knew he would get over Tau, but he didn’t
“This was the best Christmas!” Samuel declared, plopping down on the empty dark green button-tufted, leather sofa.
Harry's heart wilted as he moved away from the man to continue on up the hill – he really had fallen hopeless in love with Draco Malfoy.
The snow was charmed red for Harry’s team, and green for Draco’s – a nice idea of one Professor Filius Flitwick. If you were hit, you joined the team you were last hit by, and so far, Harry’s team were winning. They had started with even teams: Harry’s team having Neville and nine students, Draco with Filius and nine students... but now Draco was left with only two Slytherin students, and they were hiding behind charmed snow.
“Piss off Potter!” Draco spat. “Wouldn’t want to be associated with a Death Eater now would you, I might taint your golden boy reputation.”
When Harry came back, Draco took the gift in a state of being mute from pleasant surprise. It wasn’t a book, but a box wrapped in green paper. He glanced back up at Harry and was almost relieved to see that Harry was just as nervous as he was.
Friday, 2nd October, Midnight at astronomy tower. Draco looks down ashamed, but Harry takes his hand hesitantly between his own.
-Draco enters the common room and goes to say something, but changes his mind.
-It is advised that you listen to the songs (on YouTube perhaps)  as you read this fanfiction to get more of an idea and feel for the story. There is important events and things written between the lines of the lyrics - for example:
Oh, and Potter. He'd tried to piss Potter off - be his usually tosser self to push him away, but it hadn't worked ... he'd kissed Potter! And that kiss certainly wasn't just a product of a damn cursed radio; their lips fit together quite perfectly, and Harry's scent of broom-wood, apple and cinnamon, was like a narcotic. Did potter wear that scent just to drive him insane, the prick?
Harry only hesitated for a second, before taking out his own wand. “I Harry James Potter, son of James Fleamont Potter and Lilly May Potter nee Evens, call upon the oath of silence to protect the world from knowledge that may harm it and the natural order of life. Absie linguamea aeternum.”
“Merlin’s bollocks, Harry. You were a Horcrux?” Draco shuddered, and Harry nodded sadly at him. “Fuck! I’m assuming that’s why you walked to your death like a bloody Gryffindor. So, what, you died and traded Tom’s soul piece for your own or something?” Draco asked with bewildered aghast.
“We’ll deal with it. We always do.” Harry said.
Draco frowned. He seemed to be taken-back by that question. After a moment he said, “Not at all Potter, the offer of a free drink was simply too good to pass up.”
Harry thought.
“But there was rat sir, and-”
“Why are you so curious?” Harry asked in a softer tone, but not quite ready to let go of his defensive posture just yet.
Draco: "Okay..."
When he looked back at Draco however, he smiled; Draco’s nose was exaggeratedly wrinkled in disgust, and he realised then, that it was avoidance for prides sake. Draco had agreed that they would have each other’s back, but he wouldn’t admit that out loud. The random attack on his dinning room décor, was Draco’s way of avoiding an otherwise awkward and sentimental conversation –- in fact, that was something Tau would do
Harry: "Never mind."
“Did she say why?” Harry asked, rushing from his room as he threw on his robe. Apparently, he was ready to go.
Draco started to walk away, he couldn't let himself believe Harry's words. Harry was just angry,  just consumed by raw magic, and lacking sleep. Wasn't he?
Harry: "You know what Malfoy? I tried. Ron and Hermione are right - You're not worth it. I don't know why I bothered! I'm done!''
After agreeing to go see McGonagall after lunch time, Draco eventually persuaded Harry to get dressed and to stop isolating himself in his room. They had decided to go for a walk while they mauled over the facts - what they knew so far, their theories, and revelations forced on them by whatever was happening. Walking along the outskirts of the forbidden forest, Draco stopped.
Draco: "Fuck you Potter! and for your informa-"
Draco takes Harry's face in his hands tenderly, begging with his eyes for a chance.
“Yes sir! It’s been amazing really, and that Snowball fight between you and Mr Malfoy was…” Samuel coughed once to regain his composure and reel in his exuberance. “What I meant to say, sir, is that it’s been a rather enjoyable experience despite being the only first year here.”
That I'm gonna display
Harry blinked and realised that yes, actually, now that she mentioned it, he did feel much better - much more himself. Malaise seem a little less eccentric and unlikely to jump him at any second now that they were away from the reception room. She was still in strange clothes, but she was not unpleasant to look at, and her dress did match the going theme. It was almost like he had been hyper-sensitive and aroused, but at least he could blame the flowers - apparently.
eyes, and I didn’t watch him kill my mother over and over again in my dreams because of them fucking Dementors! No of course not Draco, of course I have no fucking idea!”
“What?” He asked Draco.
It was time to let go of his childish fantasies, of love and acceptance, and it was time to let Padfoot go… no matter how hard it would be. He was a cold hearted Slytherin, he could do what needed to be done.
Hermione: "Ronald!"
With that though, he knew what he wanted. He wanted Draco Malfoy with Tau’s personality. Gods help him, he was a sick bastard, but he liked Draco, there was no doubt about that. He had come to realised that he cared for the blond, perhaps a little more that platonic. There were new parts of Draco he was seeing all the time that he… well, he loved those parts of the man. All it would take, was a little more give from Draco - a little more of what Tau had given him in all those letters, and he knew… he knew he would fall in love.
“Guess I broke the rules!” Harry winked, sending a whole knew type of shiver down Draco’s spine. “What are you going to do about it?”
His mind argued. Was he really so guilty of judging the book by its cover – of seeing what he expected to see when he looked at Draco? Then again, Tau was an illusion he’d created, he only knew what Tau wrote – his mind supplemented the blanks with fantasy.
Draco: "I've attacked you many t-"
“Yes, they
“We’ll be just behind you. Go on ahead!” Harry smiled, watching as Neville frowned, shrugged, and then left with Filius. Harry then pulled out his wand.
Taking a deep breath, he decided to make coffee for Harry and himself, it would keep his hands busy. The owls he’d let in, were currently sitting on the back of the two wooden, dining room chairs. “You have owls,” Draco called out, “parcels. They were waiting for you in the hallway.” Draco was proud of his ability to
Draco stood up and twisted his wand, causing the snow around Harry to crawl over his downed body, attempting to hold him down on the ground.
Blaise: "Oh come of it. We all know you fancy the pants off savoir boy. I keep telling ya he ain't worth it,  and he's with that ginger chick. Although, I hear ... she's been opening her legs to that Dean Thomas - seeing as Potter isn't stroking her  libido."
alternative option – but he was assuming that Draco would never talk to him again after it did, and because of that belief, he wanted to wait until he’d shown his memories to Mr Silas Avery; until they had dealt with that boy to the best of their abilities, they couldn’t risk being at odds with one another.
Draco: "Then lets make a deal. I'll admit when something is wrong, tell you if i'm not ready to talk about it, and if need be - ill piss of alone for a walk. If I break the deal, remind me of it! Tell me I'm breaking our arrangement. It can work both ways if you like."
That evening, Harry was situated on his bed like every evening; a cup of coffee on the bedside table, and the magical parchment in front of him. He wasn’t yet ready for bed, but he was winding down for the day.
"Why are you so nervous if it is so safe?" Draco asked.
August, certainly wasn’t the one he’d seen today. He wanted to know who the real Draco was – the moody git from today, the one he’d had glimpse of at coffee, or someone else entirely? How many masks did the blond even have?
He just hoped that Draco would rush to get the door, and that he wouldn’t put away whatever it was he was doing first. ‘
Draco: "Potter! Do be quiet, you're ruining my shining moment of proclamation."
-Friday 10th December - Common room: Ginny is sitting in Harry's lap kissing him,  but Harry doesn't appear to be enjoying it anymore - his open eyes follow Draco.
Draco: "It's all your fault Potter."
A comfortable silence fell over them as Draco returned to the books, but Harry had a sudden desire for fresh air. He knew he should finish explaining about the Horcruxes soon – the break from the topic wouldn’t satisfy Draco for long, he’d have question later for sure. At least he’d accomplished one of the things he had wanted to achieve – to get Draco to open up to him a little.
“Mr Longbottom will be heading down to Hufflepuff house shortly, to make sure the students are ready to leave on time.” Minerva’s her stern face was softened slightly by the mirth she tried valiantly to hide.
-Harry shrugs of his own robes, throws of his grey jumper, and helps Draco remove his grey jumper.
“What of my own students? As head of Slytherin, shouldn’t I be assuring my students are ready to leave likewise?”  He knew what Minerva was going to say before she said it.
worrying; the draught of living death, at normal potency, is an extremely powerful sleeping draught which sends the drinker into a deathlike slumber. Harry didn’t dare imagine what it could do when strengthen. Although he was sure he could handle it, he didn’t want to think that Silas would actually try to do something of this magnitude –- and all over being denied for NEWT level Defence against the dark arts.
In the sweet shop, Harry had hand fed Draco a piece of chocolate from the free sample trays. Draco had returned the favor, after teasing him with the first piece he offered to Harry before eating it himself instead. Harry then managed to get the chocolate over the side of his lips as he ate it, which Draco tenderly wipe of - sucking his finger clean of it. Both boys where craving each others lips agian by then, so after paying for his every flavored beans and chocolate, they apparated to Harry house - 12 Grimmauld Place.
It had the desired effect Harry was hoping for, and he smirked when Draco shuddered at the thought. The blond didn’t look happy though, more petulantly resigned to the fact he wouldn’t be having more chocolate today, and he acted like a reprimanded child. Harry chuckle.
-They all return to Hogwarts together, laughing, sharing stories, and in each other proximity. They past a gobsmacked McGonagall, and Draco bows to her goodnight - before running to take back Harry's hand and join his friends.
Draco: "Appearance only Potter. My father didn't want his gay son spoiling his reputation. He paid the Parkinson's a hefty sum; when the time was right, we were to get married, and Pansy was to bare my offspring. Pansy and me never had any sort of romantic feelings for each other, but she was kind enough to go along with the pretenses. We're friends, nothing more."
’ He though, picking up the quill and deciding to just go for it. He’d never get any work done if he just sat there staring and waiting.
“Wait! Walburga?” Draco turned to face Harry. “As in Auntie Walburga?” When Harry nodded, he asked - “Why do you have her portrait here?”
-Draco's 8th birthday with his happy parents, blowing out candles, making a wish.
I'm a hold ya down until you're amazed
“Harry?” Draco was hesitant. He bit the inside of lip, cursing himself for even daring to ask… What was he even going to ask? Do you fancy me Potter? Kiss me? Ludicrous! He had Padfoot regardless and he was behaving the fool.
Suffice to say Herbology was hell. Every time they past each other, looked at each other ... heard each other for crying out loud, there would only be one thing on their minds. Harry and Draco being who they were, wanted to make it more of a challenge - they teased each other.
As much as Draco tried to avoid Harry Potter, it seemed that the fates had other plans – why they tormented him so was beyond him, hadn’t he suffered enough?
“Oof!” Harry had managed to steady the boy by grabbing his shoulders, but Harry still managed to be to be subjected to a speeding face colliding into his stomach. “Mr Bartlett! Running, is not permitted in the corridors. I’m afraid I must deduct ten-” Harry suddenly realised that the small, dark-brown haired boy in front of him, was trying valiantly not to cry and had forced his posture to look contrite. “What’s the matter Mr Bartlett?” Harry asked, kneeling down on one knee to be closer to the boy’s eye level.
Draco just lifted his fork in recognition, and nodded once before continuing on with his own food. It looked like the blond was eating what was left of his Yorkshire pudding and mash potatoes, the veg and meat already eaten. Harry had chosen a small scoop of carrots, lots of beef and a bit of gravy.
“Potter! You just stole a students wand.” Draco was fumbling to accept what Potter had just done.
-Tuesday 9th March. Draco drags Harry into an empty class room - snogging him on the table.
Harry and Neville then went to talk to Miss Payne. Neville sat down at the end of the bed Miss Payne occupied, and Harry sat on the empty bed to the left.
Harry: "Piss off Malfoy. If you weren't a death eater then..."
Draco gasped as the lift moved upwards, but he also noticed how Harry's hands fidgeted, how quiet he had become. "Is it safe?" He asked.
Harry frowned when Draco just stood there.
"C-Cauldron?" As Harry looked, he noticed that a small cauldron had indeed appeared. He chuckled nervously, berating himself for acting like twat, and dropped in his voucher.
“It’s a calming drought potter. I made it myself, so I know it’s safe and most certainly better than where you usually acquire it from.”
"Harry calm down!" Draco told him. They had just got back to the Harry's private rooms at Hogwarts with all the shopping. "It's only the 22nd, we can go and get something tomorrow."
-Draco grabs Harry's wrists to prevent another shove.
“It is certainly not nothing! You levitated Mercia’s book into the back of my head!” Harry recognised the boy as Mr Cain Sharrow, a first-year Ravenclaw dressed as … Bertie Bott he assumed, what with the charmed beard, grey suit, and ‘every flavour beans’ as buttons. Cain was pointing angrily at Oscar.
With that said, everyone quickly gathered at their designated section of the Great Hall, and Harry went to question Mr Leonard.
“It’s none of your business. I didn’t take you for someone to go snooping around in other people’s bedrooms!” Draco’s voice was raised, but Harry could hear the humiliation over the anger.
Draco: "What?"
Draco: "Piss of Potter! I don't need your fucking pity."
Harry: "Let me get you something."
Harry looks up at him, their eyes burn into each other with want for a few seconds, but then Harry averts his eyes down to his food quickly.
Draco: "It was just the damn radio Potter! It mean't nothing."
“I did train with the Auror Department for nearly a year.” Harry explained. “Mr Dale Rogers is head of the Auror Department. Mr Elroy Graves is just the head Auror of his team, but he likes to throw about his title falsely – so people think he’s head of the department. Graves was there when I was training, and he’s always been threatened by me because I was outing him even as a trainee.”
Draco, then Draco was very real! If Tau
-They glide beautifully together around the floor, lost in each others eyes.
“Not the time Potter, you have to go and tame your kittens!” Draco said, changing the subject.
She smiled at her potion professor, apparently relaxing now that she knew she wasn’t being held accountable. “Thank you, sir!” She said, and Draco nodded.
Harry knocked on the potion classroom’s door. He didn’t have to wait long until Draco answered it with a frown before he realized who it was. Draco appeared to be slightly curious of his unannounced arrival, but he realized the man still had a class in session. Before Harry could apologise for interrupting, Draco spoke first.
-Breathing heavily, he slows to a walk.
I want to know about the strangers like me
-Hair a mess, open and free, the six friends laughed as they spin in the tea cups.
About the strangers like me
Draco: "Professor, I can't speak for Potter here, but i'm concerned about my N.E.W.T.s. Even though it appears - to everyone else, that my work is being completed; I am struggling to recall what I've learnt, and I don't remember all of my past lessons due to this curse."
"Tell me you're joking Potter!" Draco shuddered.
“Fuck me Potter. I’d be a wreck right now. How are you so nonchalant about this?”
By hammering on the door to Draco’s private suite.
He’d bet his wand that Silas had done something to put the fear of Merlin into the girl. This was not good… not good at all.
Disastrous pasts… Another confirmation that Draco and Tau where one of the same. Oh Merlin!
“P-Po -Potion.” Harry rasped, fighting to focus on Draco instead of his nightmares – listening to him list of the potions.
Draco: "How very Slytherin of you."
-Feeling that everything will be alright, they made out for ages; breathless and sweating as they kissed and roamed hands over each others bodies. They were making up for lost time, and remembering what they could lose if they let others get to them. Neither one was prepared to lose the other - they would fight for their relationship.
past.”
be notified. Suffice to say, the woman had left in an angry huff.
“I’ll be perfectly fine.” Draco tried to ensure him, but as he went to walk away, he nearly tripped.
Draco: "Habit I suppose. Would you prefer I called you pumpkin?"
“Just go Potter!”
Draco sat in his room looking at the Daily prophet he had flattened out - creased and ripped slightly from throwing it earlier today. He watching as Harry's photo argued with the reporters that were slamming Harry for defending him at his trial back in July.
They weaved through the crowds of excited, last minute Christmas shoppers as they walked back up the hill to Quality Quidditch Supplies. Chatter, laughter, merchants calling out deals, and frenzied parents running after excited children... all ambient for the week leading up to Christmas.
“Oh… And you came to me?” Draco asked, acting a little awkwardly.
"Come on. It's just an elevator. It takes us upstairs." Harry explained, smirking as Draco slowly entered to lift. Harry took his finger off the hold door button, pressed for level three, and went silent as the doors closed.
Harry: "Come on, I'll get you a cuppa."
-Draco's running turns into a slow breathless walk.
After returning the quill and parchment to the draw in his bedside table, Harry settled down into bed to sleep. With his mind playing over the different possible scenarios of Tau and Padfoot’s inevitable meeting, it was a while before he drifted off… and straight into throes of nightmares:
“Oh…” Said Draco. Yes, he’d not thought of that. Fuck! Had he been drugged, breathed in too many potions fumes lately? “I see,” Draco quickly tried to rein in control of his body and his growing embarrassment, “Hand it over then Potter, and I’ll show you!”
He repeated those words to himself over and over again – while his stomach repelled the last of his Christmas dinner, while he violently brushed his teeth and stared at his own reflection in the mirror, while he showered away the feeling of being violated, and while he marked homework and essays with a very strong mug of coffee.
Well I'm about to turn up the heat
“Potter!” Draco wanted to say something, but again, he had no idea what he actually wanted to say. He had a desire to see if they fit… to see if their lips slotted together the way he imagined they would. Surely Harry’s lips were as unique and addicting as the man himself was.
Harry was in fact, downstairs with a cup of tea. He didn't fancy coffee, hoping he could get some more sleep in a while before Draco noticed him missing. Unfortunately, he heard a door close upstairs put his tea down, and went up.
Harry just hummed in feigned agreement. Watching the students: dancing to rather ominous Halloween music as the charmed lights flickered over them, sitting at round tables eating Halloween themed foods, or standing around chatting on a current sugar high.
He really had enjoyed Draco’s company, but now, as he looked into stunning grey eyes, he wondered what kissing him would feel like. But no more then a second later did he think of Tau again. He didn’t want to betray the trust he had started to gain with the mystery man: even if Tau would never know,
century, was bitten by a vampire - Raynould Euanes to be exact. Vlad was a wizard that declared genocide against all vampires because one turned his brother. Vlad killed his brother, believe him to be dead already, but then Raynould turned Vlad as a punishment. Vlad went mad with rage; attacked the Ottoman empire – which was infiltrated by vampires, and Vlad got himself killed. He was a vampire for a few short weeks, and they found his decapitated remains scattered on the battlefield after the Ottomans cut up his corpse. The ministry at the time, failed to erase the memory of all the muggle witnesses: a few slipped away with their memories intact, and thus, Dracula stories were warped and pasted down as mere stories in the muggle world.”
Harry and Draco shared a glance, then together, they started to recount everything they knew so far.
Harry: "And your sister isn't? She is sleeping with Dean behind my back!"
Two minutes remaining.
Harry still didn’t know exactly why the hat hadn’t insisted on sticking him in Slytherin, and he didn’t quite believe Dumbledore when he’d told Harry that his choice made him a true Gryffindor – or that Voldemort’s piece of soul within him at the time had been a factor of that. Harry believed that everyone had traits of all four houses, and when you balanced between two rather equally, your choice was simply taken into account. He would never know, and he didn’t care all that much to be honest – not anymore. He was who he was, and quite frankly, he didn’t like the division that came with being labelled a Gryffindor, a Slytherin, a Hufflepuff, or a Ravenclaw for someone’s entire life. Who you are at eleven, isn’t necessarily who you are at thirty? Not to mention that, people had warped views on the traits that set you apart in houses. Slytherin isn’t the house of evil, Gryffindor isn’t the house of the fearless, Hufflepuff isn’t the house of nit-wits, and Ravenclaw isn’t the house of masterminds.
Harry crashed into Draco so hard he feel bad onto the stone ground. Harry on top of him, kisses him fervently.
“Do you know what memories you’re going to use?” Draco asked.
Something is familiar
“Coffee please Kreacher –
Harry hid the wand behind his back, as he and Draco turned to see Neville and Filius waiting for them.
"It's okay Mr Potter!" Malaise assured him quickly, picking up on his uncertainty and slight panic. "I will write down that you do not mind blood status, but that you would like to avoid magical creature blood for now. You can change your mind at any time, and do not feel bad. I am heterosexual, so I wouldn't want to date a woman, but that doesn't mean I dislike woman or have anything against them. I still have many female friends and acquaintances. You understand?"
-Draco pins Harry to the wall and tries to seduce him, but Harry turns his head.
A woman – defiled – green - snap of bone – blood – joy. It had been a broken link back then – blurry, and he hadn’t known at the time that it was the muggle studies teacher – Professor Burbage. But… he knew now, and he knew that her death had given birth to the seventh Horcrux – Nagini. The sick loop of that memory made his stomach lurch.
He thought, gathering up his congratulating Slytherin students. It was only when Miss Zabini pointed out that he was still wet, did he remember to cast a drying and warming charm on himself.
Draco looked up, and sure enough the cause of his distress had entered the hospital wing.
Harry: "Right!"
Ron got slapped by Hermione for being sarcastic and interrupting them. Draco and Harry just realised they had an audience - Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Pansy, even Luna for some reason.
Molly: "Ronald!"
Draco sat on his bed, trying to read over his school work from the past two months. He was trying to remember his past classes, and trying to make everything he had supposedly learnt - and done, all sink in now that he wasn't singing ... but he was too distracted.
-Wednesday 18th November: Draco getting annoyed that she won't release him from counseling sessions.
“Detention Mr Avery!” Draco’s voice was cold and icy, piercing through silence.
Harry: "Shut up! You almost let pride and ego break us apart, don't let it stop your boyfriend buying you a cup of fucking tea, and anything else he should wish to. Besides, some of that money was the black inheritance-"
Harry lifted the blanket to take a look: Draco’s right foot was now a purple-blue colour, with frozen, icy nails… just like his hand had been. Harry got off the bed to find some socks for Draco, not really knowing what else he could do to help the man.
-After lessons, they hide behind a statue to share a kiss they had craved all day, giggling at themselves.
Harry screamed. “No No NO! Get out of my head you sick fuck!”
Harry went to stand and talk to Draco, but the blond man just shook his head. Harry remained seated, watching as the other students hurried to leave the classroom – only a few of them even said – “Good bye Mr Malfoy.” The anticipation of what Draco would do now was making him uncomfortable for some unknown reason, he felt out of place, but he was curious about the blonde’s student teacher relationship and how he would deal with Mr Silas Avery. It appeared that the students held apprehension in regards to their potions teacher, much like they had done when professor Snape had been their potions teacher in 1991. Harry never feared Severus Snape – he was used to being treated unfairly by the Dursleys, but the man was an arsehole … yes, that about summed it up – a great man, a hero, but an arsehole!
Harry: "Because I love her, we're sorting things out, and you know what ... it's none of your fucking business."
After a week of conversing with Tau in this similar fashion, he felt like he knew the hidden meanings behind his words. In this instance he’d translated Tau’s message to:
“Draco?” Harry puzzled why the man was on the floor, concerned when he made no move to get up. It was also rather out of character for the man to be in his pyjamas at this time of the day.
Harry thought that he could ask a similar promise, that Tau wouldn’t suddenly see only his fame and fortune. This was what the secret parchment service was for, to get to know each other as they are now - not the past, not the lies and stories the media made up, but each other’s true personality. Harry was sure there would be instances of his own past that he would feel hesitant to share, so Tau wasn’t alone in that either.
“Sonixies?”
As much as Draco was loath to admit it, he still wanted the boy to suffer for what he had done to Har– to Potter. He didn’t like the boy, and it was obvious the feeling was mutual.
He must have been there for at least three hours before he was finally handed ten different possible matches, or possible secret chérie's. Malaise left him to go through them alone and only returned once with a cup of tea for him with a few biscuits. By the time he had finished his tea, he had already decided that he wasn't interest in seven of them. One of the aforementioned seven was into strange role play animal sex games - a rather big nope from Harry after nearly chocking on his biscuit. Another had an ultimate life goal of traveling the world to find new or extinct magical creatures, but Harry felt that it clashed with his own goals of having a crazy little family and keeping his job.
Harry took a moment to gather his wits about him and remember that he had students to escort to the Gryffindor tower. He’d felt bereft of the warmth that had seemed to radiate from Draco’s own cold body somehow, and he thought, just for a moment, that Draco had shared his desires. He’d probably imagined it; their battle and the cold having affected his better judgement… but there was still a tiny ray of hope that came from the way Draco had stared at him. The only thing was, if Draco did share his feelings – or even a fraction of them – why would he claim that it would never work between them? That’s what he said, right?
certain teacher needs to take a long nap, he works far too hard.’ His tone was rather angry.”
“Yeah. Erm… The Goblins might have said something about that, but I have no interest to mess with her life.” Harry explained, not seeing the big deal.
Harry forced his eyes to focus on the last part of the message – the part where Draco… where
Harry looked up into Draco's eyes imploringly, inhaling the scent of Draco as they walked. Hope in his green eyes that Draco would stop being a complete tosser, and would start to be his true self.
“Well, the fact that you bolted from the Great Hall might have already done that I’m afraid. I know how their minds’ work. You are not the only victim of their pranks I can assure you, but do you feel as if you are being targeted, bullied?”
Draco swayed his out stretched arms.
“Sure! That sound good.” Harry nodded, trying to relax.
-Memory: Harry sitting in the window at night with Hedwig by is side.
Ron: "To be fair mate, I'm surprised your not at it already."
Draco: "Don't Potter! I Don't want you're fucking pity. Save your heroics for all the damsels in distress that swoon over you like Ginger."
Draco: "Okay, you're right. As your boyfriend then ... i'm asking, will you please calm down."
a divorce, but requesting one is demeaning. She wouldn’t have any access to the Malfoy vaults or properties any longer either. If you were to deem her marriage in breach of the marriage contract, or express concern for her wellbeing as the Lord of Black, she could be released of her vows without condemnation and blame. She’d probably be entitled to a substantial sum of the Malfoy funds – well, what remains of my fathers that is, as indemnification.”
Draco nodded, obviously overwhelmed with all the new information he had just received.
Draco: "Is there even room in their shoddy little-"
-Draco smacks the wall as Harry runs from his room.
“Its just over there.” Draco said, pointing to the door of the en-suite.
Having already paid for the coffee’s when they ordered them, Harry didn’t hesitate to bolt after Draco before the blond man could find somewhere to disapparate.
POP! The darn radio appeared on the ground next to them.
He washed, he rinsed, and he cleaned his body meticulously… but nothing could remove the Dark mark.
Draco: "I know someone that looks good!"
So hold on until it's over
Professor Flitwick: "Time up, quills down!"
“Do you want me to leave?” Draco asked, placing his own mug down on the table.
“Professor Snape was a great occlumens though. He’d have to have been, if he was able to fool the -- Tom, for so long that is.” Draco wondered aloud, stopping himself from using ‘The Dark lord’ as his title - he didn't want to give the man the title of 'lord', and Tom seemed fitting seeing as the man had apparently hated it.
Can you feel the things I feel right now with you
Draco chuckles as he sits up next to Harry. Harry pushes himself up on his elbows.
Harry shook his head - no! He would leave the coffee for now; he could always make some when Draco was here if they decided on it.
Harry: "That's not what-. *Sighs.* Are you really going to deny that whatever this curse is, what it's making us do, isn't ... without truth."
“Just read it.” Harry told him, and then turned to leave once Draco finally took the letter from his hand. He was all the way down the hall when Draco called.
Each step closer that Potter took, was another skip of his heart… and what Draco didn’t see, was that Harry was using wandless magic to lift a small mound of snow that sat behind him. Distracted by the oncoming raven-haired man, he almost squeaked in shock when that mound crashed over his head and snow exploded over his entire body.
“Sirius once told me that all the Black’s were named from constellations or Greek mythology. It wasn’t hard to figure it out.”
downfall, even if it was Harry that ultimately killed the nose-less cunt.
It was almost anticlimactic. The vibe of Hogwarts Halloween when he was once a student was ominous at best, and wasn’t Halloween supposed to be scary? Hogwarts made it feel friendly somehow, fun and animated, and it had been that way since the war – since he’d been a teacher here. Harry supposed that murdering parents, letting in real grown trolls, letting out a Basilisk, breaking out criminals to attack the school, allowing terrified students to compete in dangerous tournaments, and announcing that the most fearful dark lord is back and wants to murder you all – – well, Harry wasn’t going to complain about the change, that’s for sure.
He sat back in the armchair, pulling it a little closer to bed, and watched as Draco finally drifted back off to sleep. Ill or not, the man was still handsome, perfect, and someone he desired fervently with his body, mind, and soul. Right now, however… Harry was just worried about him. He sighed - trust Draco to catch the Snowflu!
It was really tough, choosing just one, but he kept being drawn to number three. It was the way he had written his life goal. Harry read the words again:
By the time his coffee had been finished, he’d finally decided on his reply.
-Draco takes Harry's hands.
"Yeah," nodded Harry, "he wants to try out for the chaser position that will open up after the summer. Mylo Yarwood is a seventh year so he won't be here next year."
“As much as I hate to admit it, yes!”
Harry: "You were forced to take that mark. Yes, you did some bad things, but in every other sense ... you're not a Death Eater. You were cleared of all charges at trial."
Her work was good, an easy Exceeds Expectations grade, but it reminded him that the girl had remedial potion at this exact moment.
-Images of Vernon back handing Harry across the face, and Petunia smacking him with a frying pan.
“Scared that you can’t handle your drink, Potter.” Draco’s left eyebrow raised on its own – something Harry almost frowned at. He couldn’t lift one eyebrow, and it was so tempting to try that he almost did. Draco had such expressive features when his wanted to use them.
Loves all of you
I'm here for your entertainment
-Draco allows Harry to hold him as his tears fall. Overwhelmed, he remembers a part of himself that he though long gone - his innocence, his soul.
“Symptoms?” Draco’s asked.
“I don’t wish to talk about them!” Harry cut him off sharply. He drunk from his glass and then smiled. “So, what about Padfoot? You at least have him to write sweet nothings too.”
disappointed in you both.”
. Her face was beet red.”
Draco: "You don't mean that. You're just angry."
“Like what?” Draco asked, leaning forwards with a burning curiosity.
Draco’s personality was sometimes identical to Tau’s – if you paid attention to him – hidden behind layers of masks and shields, but when he relaxed and forgot about his need to be defensive or protective of himself from others… Harry could see that identicality. The times when that hidden personality of his was allowed to shine – like their whisky night back in September, were something almost precious … something wonderful and catalytic.
Ron: "You alright mate, another dream?"
Harry: "What for?"
mirror that trait with Tau. His illusion was shattering into a million pieces, but if Tau really was Draco, and if there was a chance… he had to try.
“Are you okay Harry?” Draco asked, opening the door up further to reveal the man’s attire: grey long-sleeved pyjamas, in what appeared to be a soft tracksuit type material.
“It’s my old school uniform Potter.” Draco informed him, but that much was very obvious – right down to the ugly pointed hat they used to wear during the starting feasts and such. The green underside of his black cloak looked brighter somehow – as did the green in his stripped tie, and
Harry: "Sorry. Didn't think I'd be so long in there."
-Wednesday 25th December, Harry receives a new letter and a present from Draco.
Draco sighed. Harry really didn't have any reason to trust him, so there was no point trying to get him to believe him. He just needed to know if Harry remember or not, now he had his answer.
-The rest of the family arrive and stare at Harry who is grinning of into space.
"I suggest you get your eyes re-checked Potter. Your ridiculous spectacles don't seem to be working for you." Malfoy yelled after him. Harry paused in his steps, turning to face the blond bully from his past.
-Draco stands up with Harry still holding his left hand. He looks to find his child-self, and watches all the memories around him. His child-self appears in front of him.
Harry swiftly left the Library, Draco hot on his heels and none the wiser to Harry’s lewd thoughts.
-Harry looks down, twiddling at his fingers.
Draco sniffed the air again, that same pompous action that if Harry didn’t already know he was right it would have confirmed it. Of course, Draco didn’t even know that he did it and Harry wouldn’t tell him.
-Image of Harry saving Draco from Azkaban - during Draco's trial after the death of Voldemort.
When Seamus threw the paper at him, he saw the heading 'The boy who lived, corrupted or cursed?' It was a full spread, full of moving photos of Harry in Diagon Alley a week ago with Draco. At homely abode, the owlery, Quidditch supplies, and the wonderful display they put on in Twifits and tattings.
While Ron and Hermione were distracted, Harry read his note.
“You always go out with your buttons in the wrong holes.” Draco pulled at Harry’s shirt. “Your hair looks like a bird’s nest – a worse bird’s nest then it usually does anyway.” Draco wrinkled his nose at Harry’s hair before looking down at him again. “And your robe is a wrinkled mess. Not to mention that you have odd socks on and your tie is still untied.”
“Yes sir?”
He needed to get on a broom!
“That’s not good enough! I demand something better or my father will hear about this!” Draco threatened. He hissed as his right foot started smarting from the frosty sensation that was growing there.
“You’re smiling.” Harry stated calmly, drinking his coffee once again. Draco’s smile vanished in an instant, but his eyes belied his lips.
Avery held his head up high, eyes fixed on Draco’s. It looked like he was going to argue, and Harry wouldn’t be surprised if he did. Silas Avery was a difficult and argumentative child, one that acted extremely entitled and obstinate. Harry use to have difficulties with the boy in defence against the dark arts in the past, often ending with him ignoring rules and injuring other students. Harry had yet to prove that he had been hurting other students for the sheer fun of it, and were not, as Silas had claimed, ‘an accident’. However, with too many incidents, Harry had refused to accept him for N.E.W.T level defence against the dark arts – and was no longer teaching the boy.
“A Horcrux is the name given to an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. Tom would – he would murder someone, use some sort of spell that even I don’t know – nor do I ever want to, and then a part of his soul would split off it into an object of his choice, becoming a Horcrux. He did this six times before his downfall. Well, five times -- the sixth time was an accident on his behalf.” Harry had to pause and use the slight burn of the whisky to distract his thoughts - if only for a few seconds, before continuing.
normal and nonchalant, even if he was desperately trying to chase away his growing feeling for the raven-haired Gryffindor – feelings that were still like weeds, weeds that refused to die no matter how much herbicide he used.
-Shoved against the door, Harry used his hands to slide Draco's robe off his shoulders.
Harry shook himself, making sure that the charms to keep the bedding warm were still working, and were still applied to his clothes and pillow as well.
Draco looked embarrassed more than ashamed, and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. Draco glared at him.
When had they changed from enemies to this? Whatever
“Warm…” Draco repeated, as if in a daze all of a sudden, as Harry tucked the man in.
“Yes, I know! Poppy has gone to get the Warmendall potion.” Harry said, forcing the pyjama top onto Draco’s body. Draco blinked, seemingly in a haze again, but he was slowly looking around the room. “What did you do to make the bed so warm?” Harry asked Kreacher, not taking his eyes off Draco.
“Come on! You know you’re going to tell me sooner or later, so why not cut to the chase and just tell me now.” Harry had a massive grin; he was loving this far too much Draco noted.
“What do I get for sharing private details of my life with you?” Harry asked, slowly placing his coffee down on the table and folding his arms.
Harry plopped down to sit on his bed and faced him. The house elf had a bulbous, snout-like nose, squinted bloodshot eyes, a wrinkly face, and white hair growing out of his bat-like ears. His frayed grey vest - made from an old pillow case, was tied tightly around his tiny waist.
eat too much chocolate – just like Draco did!
-Monday 2nd November - After potions class, Harry tries to talk to Draco, but they start arguing.
dead.
Being around 8pm, the stars were bright in the night sky - cloudless and endless. He leaned on the rails, searching for constellations. An owl spotted him, swooping down with a letter from the ministry. He petted the bird, watching it leave before opening his letter. He read it, smiling afterwards with relief in his face, turning back to the stars.
Yes, I'm quite horrified actually, but in the process ... she accidentally revealed her own sleeping habits. Suffice to say it's been sorted now, but I doubt Ginny will be speaking to me for a while.
Harry: "I can't believe it's nearly Halloween."
“Both!” Harry laughed. “But I was actually referring to the homework.”
“Yeah, we didn’t mean to disrespect you Mr Potter. We’re sorry.” Duncan Gibson apologised.
Draco closed his eyes, a futile attempt to stop the tears that fell there as he realised … he would never know what it was like to be in a relationship with someone that loved him.
He wanted to be friends with Harry, but it was laughable. A Death Eater, and the savior.  Harry has enough to deal with, without his problems adding to them. It was also impossible, Harry's life would be ruined if he was apart of it. The problem was, he was addicted to Harry, curious about him, and was attracted to him something bad.
“I’m okay now. Thank-you for your help Mr Potter.” Samuel nodded and went to get back onto his feet to leave, but Harry gestured for him to stop and to remain seated.
Harry knew he was being ludicrous, Padfoot and himself were the same fucking person, but … he couldn't lie to himself – he'd wanted Draco to choose him, the real him. What was worse, he knew Draco would kill him for not be honest sooner, fuck! What had he done? Draco was infatuated with Padfoot, and he'd rejected him – Harry.
And yet nothing to me
“Potter!” He accused, and the raven-haired prat opposite him smirked.
The week past as normal, and Harry and Draco where absolutely in love; sneaking kisses where they could, hand holding, using their enchanted parchment during lessons, and always retreating to either ones bedroom for the night.
Draco: "Babe, not a bloody minute goes by when I'm not thinking of you. I hope you love me just as much, or enough to say yes, otherwise I'm making a huge fool of myself. Harry James Potter, will you do me the honor, after we finish school of course, of becoming my husband?"
Harry huffed and threw it down, stuffing dry toast into his mouth, and gulping down his drink. He ignored everyone, even his two best friends. His blood was boiling, he didn't want to read a fucking news article that slated and accused Draco. They didn't fucking know Draco.
"Right!" Harry chuckled bashfully, rubbing at the back of his reddening neck.
That challenge was Draco’s undoing… he forgot everything he’d resolved to do, everything around him, even that he was a teacher with students to supervise, and he only knew that he had to accept the challenge with an action. Draco hastily moved away from the raven-haired man, swiping his wand, and causing the snow to lift from the ground in a small snow flurry.
As his eyes finally adapted to the morning rays that streamed through the window, golden and intrusive, he saw what he’d knocked off his bedside table a moment ago – the Le’Amortentia parchment and quill. Tau-Draco, had already sent him a message that morning:
Farewell! Bye bye! See ya!
Draco suddenly fled the bed, curious and wanting to find out exactly what the golden trio were arguing about. Sure enough, the golden trio were in a semi heated discussion. It appeared they were trying to argue in whispers, but failing epically. Draco stayed hidden, his door open ajar as he peered into the common room to listen. Blaise tried to get in on the spying, but he failed when Draco elbowed him hard.
“Thank you, Harry,” he managed to say as Harry sat back down opposite him, but he just stared at the Christmas gift most tingling in his hands.
“Harry.” Draco caught his attention, cutting of his train of thought. “I think I better return to my room; my legs feel like jelly.” He slurred ever so slightly, and as if to prove his legs had lost their proper function, Draco had to grab the dining table to prevent a fall. He chuckled as he stood up straight again.
"Kreacher?" Harry called to seemingly no one, but his house elf appeared with a bow.
Once Harry had drawn the rune to send his message, he froze ... realising that he'd added a kiss to the end. Oh Merlin!
I assure you; those things were soon proven very real. I was not mad.
"Thank Salazar,"Draco sighed, looking up at the blue top section with red letters forming the word 'Argos'.
“Yes sir,” she nodded, “may I go now?”
Draco stood up from the couch defensively. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Harry’s eyes throbbed as he tried to squeeze back the visuals of distorted dreams and memories. They were like a thick fog, sneaking into every crack and crevice until he couldn’t see anything else…
Harry snorted. “Is that so?” He asked, wondering why the book never mentioned the fluctuation of moods and the changes in behaviour: Draco went from tired, sleepy, and hazy, to scared, loud, and childish… and the childlike behaviour ranged in ages from young child to moody teenager.
Draco shook his head, frowning as he searched his memories. “If I have, I don’t recall anything.”
Hermione and Ron had their own lives – when they weren’t meddling in his, and they were growing distant. They would forever be his first and best friends, but they talked about their own lives – their families, their kids, and their job’s. Harry didn’t really have a ‘life’, and when he was in their company, he often just sat there nodding along with another drink they’d pushed his way, or picking at the snacks they’d set out.
me he targets – despite that being the most obvious outcome.” Harry explained. He glanced at Draco, wondering when the blond started to care for his safety.
The room suddenly felt still and silent, eyes met and held, and their breathing seemed louder. Draco coughed and tore his eyes away.
Remember that no good would come from avoiding what was so totally obvious; remember that he would gain nothing from being blissfully ignorant; and remember, that if he could face his death – literally, then he could face this.
Over the last three weeks, he had grown used to having someone to talk to that didn’t know him for the ‘boy-who-lived’. He thought they were developing a real connection between them, one that promised a possibility of a face to face meeting one day. The thought that it was all just suddenly over, hurt in ways he wouldn’t have expected at all; he felt lonely and disappointed - a sense of dejection twisted with perplexity shadowed over him, and it was as if he was grieving for man he had never met.
Draco: "Boyfriend?"
Pansy: "You owe me five galleons." (She told Blaise)
-She points to the black armchair, which paints the room in Gryffindor colours, with green wall oddly enough.
Draco cursed himself for his moment of weakness. What the fuck was he thinking? The friendly battle was one thing, but what the bloody hell was that at the end? He had to stay away from Potter, the risk of doing something he’d regret was too great in the man presence… he had, for a moment of foolishness on his part, wanted to kiss the man again… and in front of the students and the other two teachers. ‘
