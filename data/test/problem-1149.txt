“I’m tense,” I announce, when neither of them say anything. “And I’m getting the strong impression this is a ‘fuck off and forget this ever happened’ situation.”
Malfoy’s lips parted. A loaded silence fell. Harry was about to start forwards, to pick up where they had left off on Saturday night, when Malfoy cleared his throat.
Harry’s spark of hope flickered and he drew his wand reluctantly. “Are you sure it’s not all in the notes already?” He had lost count of how many times he’d been asked to levitate office supplies and cast
by running his hands over every part of Draco he could reach – his thighs, his hips, his arse. He stroked up Draco’s chest, trying to find the thin scars that criss-crossed his skin, a sick, permanent imitation of the ribbons.
“Come on,” he grits out. “Come on, Potter, I want to see you – Let me see what it looks like when you come while I’m fucking you – Wanna see you – Wanna feel you – Fuck,
. Some months, he’d thought of nothing else. He’d thought about it while wanking, while with unimpressive lovers he’d picked up at Muggle bars, while waiting for Portkeys or meetings or tearoom queues. It had become a comfort fantasy, something reliable and impossible.
had gone. He’d lived without magic for years, so he was surprised at the strength of his reaction to its loss now; he felt like he was ten years old again, locked inside the cupboard under the stairs, powerless and worthless. He stopped going outside, feeling far too vulnerable with no means of defending himself from a possible attack.
“No,” Harry snarled. Scuttleby had chased Malfoy off last time. Harry wasn’t going to let it happen again.
Ron rolled his eyes. “You’re telling me. Five months ago, I didn’t even know St Mungo’s had a library. Now I’ve had bits from every book it stocks read out to me before bed. I’m practically a Mind Healer myself at this point.”
Goddamn it. Malfoy looked truly pitiful. What sort of person would Harry be if he slammed the door in Malfoy’s face, knowing that Malfoy had come to him for help?
Malfoy smiled softly. When he spoke, his lips didn’t move. “Not at all. It was all you. You’re brilliant, Harry Potter.”
“Okay.” Draco flexed his fingers around his wand, his gaze locked on Potter’s. How long had he wanted Potter—the real Potter,
“Yes, he is.” His voice was perfectly polite, his back suddenly ramrod straight. Harry hated it. “I should get going.”
And Draco—the gorgeous, arrogant, rodenty dickhead—takes it, melts into it, coaxes me down so my body presses him into the bed. The sharp angles of him are still so unfamiliar against me, but I can learn them. I can know him. I can know both of them.
“He wasn’t dragged into anything,” Ron said stoutly. “He loved it, he bragged about it constantly when he got the Mark–”
Draco breaks away breathlessly to tell the fantasy Potter that he doesn’t need to stick to this realism thing, Draco would rather just get on with it, but once he’s broken the kiss and his eyes have fluttered open, he finds himself quite unable to speak.
“I told you enough to get you through the conversation, didn’t I? Nothing else I could have done without a breach of confidentiality. If he had suspected you to be a patient of mine, he could have leaked it to the press. I abandoned you for your own good.” He didn’t look up from his notebook, cheerfully unapologetic.
“Of course not,” Harry said in an insulted sort of voice, deciding to keep the details of his adventures on Muggle public transport to himself.
Molly had been in charge of the cake. She’d let out such a joyful shriek when Harry had told her about his engagement that he hadn’t had the heart to explain about the contract. She had quizzed him relentlessly about plans for the wedding and had been extremely disappointed that Draco was handling it all; afterwards, Harry had suggested to Draco that Molly might be able to help, and Draco had given Harry such a scathing look that Harry had nearly called the whole thing off right there.
The door with the snake-head doorknob was slightly ajar. Harry took a deep breath, plastered an “I definitely haven’t just been nuzzling your clothes” smile onto his face, and pushed it open.
He pulled at Harry’s arse again, and this time Harry went along with the movement, lowering his hips until he was directly on top of Draco, the hard line of his cock pressing into Draco’s groin. Draco groaned and yanked him closer still, his hands blindly grabbing at Harry’s skin, the soft flesh of his arse cheeks, the hard lines of his back. Any grasp he’d had on his self-control had disappeared with his clothes. Years of training himself to have restraint, to be slow and subtle and composed, melted away in an instant. He was a teenager again, whining and desperate and needy.
Harry’s cock throbbed. He’d been so preoccupied with what Malfoy might be plotting that he’d pushed the details of their last interaction to the back of his mind. He remembered suddenly, with startling intensity, how Malfoy had driven him absolutely wild. How one kiss had sent him into a frenzy of desire. He narrowed his eyes and forced the memory away.
Malfoy knocked over his glass. Nettle wine splashed over the table, soaking the paper menus and spilling onto their laps. Malfoy yelped and fumbled for his wand to vanish the mess. Harry laughed, dizzyingly grateful for the distraction.
Harry looked from Ron – red, triumphant – to Hermione – bright-eyed, angry – to Malfoy – politely blank. He made a snap decision. “I’m going with you,” he said to Malfoy. He stood too.
By the ripe old age of twenty-nine, things had changed. Harry no longer disliked his birthdays; on July 31st, his friends piled into his house, bringing food and booze and laughter. They’d stay up late drinking and talking and making sure Harry was enjoying himself.
“I…” Everyone was silent, waiting for him to finish. Even the chest calmed, as if it, too, was waiting to hear what he had to say. “Right,” Harry said eventually, his voice sounding hollow even to his own ears. “Right. A Valentine’s Day wedding to Draco Malfoy. Wonderful. I can’t wait.”
I blink, unsure whether this is a “thank you” or a “sorry” moment. But my blood-starved brain is saved the impossible task of speaking when Malfoy drops to the floor beside Harry.
“Shit,” Malfoy said, dazed. “Fuck. Yes. Fuck. I… The angle, I can’t do it from here.” He gave the wand a haphazard wave in demonstration. Harry flicked his fingers at the headboard, barely pausing in taking off his trousers, and Malfoy’s wrists fell, still bound together. He made a small noise of pain at the sudden movement, but he was quick and sure as he reached down and aimed Harry’s wand.
The room really was a bit of a state. It had been much tidier when Harry had been there the day before, for the garden party Draco had politely invited him to. But Harry had left in the early evening—emergency babysitting while Andromeda tended to an ill friend. It was obvious the festivities had continued long after he’d gone.
“I like having power over you,” Malfoy said. His face was unreadable. “Not other patients. Just you. That’s precisely what I’m talking about.”
A smile took over Draco’s mouth. It lit up his entire pinched, pointed, beautiful face. “Yeah, you can come over. I’d like that.”
Malfoy swore softly and shook his head. “It was a mistake,” he said firmly. “All of it. I’m really very sorry. Truly.”
“I’m so sorry, I have to run.” He rolled up the parchment and stuffed it inside his robes, smiling that too-charming smile. “Could you owl me the details? This has been lovely. I mean—very important issue. I can’t wait to— Anyway. Thank you. Good to see you again.” He stood, and turned purposefully towards the bar.
“Magic,” Draco says. He must realise he sounds facetious, because before Harry can roll his eyes, he clears his throat and clarifies, “It’s my magic in you, and yours in me, recognising its original host. There are theories that the whole point of the contract’s requirement of a magic exchange was to give the newlyweds motivation to actually touch each other, since most of them didn’t have a choice in their spouse.”
?” Potter asks, when Draco continues to stare. Draco steps forward and runs an awed hand down Potter’s naked chest. Fuck.
The real Malfoy – the blank-faced, straight-backed, neat-haired Malfoy – shimmered into view. Harry had been so taken by the memory of the duel that for a moment he was surprised to find himself sitting down, his wand in his pocket rather than in his hand.
Harry had replied automatically, but Malfoy wasn’t mocking him; Malfoy sounded amazed, his eyes dark and wide as they fixed on the vice-like grip Harry had around his own cock.
Draco, by contrast, is finally quiet. His eyes are glassy and his hair is sticking to his forehead in sweaty strands. He’s gasping, shivering, jerking with each thrust, his fist moving rapidly up and down his cock.
A strange spark lit up inside Harry’s chest. It took him a second to realise that it was hope – something else he hadn’t felt for months. “Wait, what did you do? How did you do that?”
Harry wanted to devour Malfoy. He wanted to tear him apart, inch by inch. He was holding his own orgasm back through sheer force of will, his desire to keep fucking Malfoy and watch him shatter stronger than anything he’d ever felt.
Awareness returned slowly. Harry’s mind woke before his body did, the sensations of his physical self distant and muffled. It felt like he was floating. He was calm. Peaceful.
Draco’s stormy-sea eyes met his. “Those robes had perfectly standard buttons, you uncultured swine.” He didn’t look away. Neither did Harry. In Harry’s peripheral vision, blue-grey dripped over red; shimmering charcoal swallowed gold. Harry reached out and traced a dazed finger over the twining ribbons that circled Draco’s neck like a collar.
Harry was once again struck by how different Malfoy was to the other experts he’d worked with. This wasn’t the first time that Harry had lost his temper at a Healer – it wasn’t the first time it had happened after he’d received a letter from Alicia, either. But usually, the Healers would coo at him, coax him back into his chair, gently explain that everything would be all right in the end, Mr Potter, just you wait and see. He’d never had one of them tell him to fuck off if he didn’t want to be there.
Harry hesitated. He’d been so preoccupied with his own return to Hogwarts that he hadn’t considered what Draco would do. They certainly hadn’t talked about it. What if he wanted to go back to that Muggle village in Wales? There was no way Harry was going with him, not after he’d
The Malfoy at the desk hummed and turned the page. Harry leaned closer, curious to know more about his past. But this page didn’t hold a schedule, but a journal entry. Harry only managed to read a snippet –
“I also wanted to let you know that I’ve thought a lot about what you said. About how overburdening myself could be the reason I lost my memory in the first place.”
Harry glanced at the man, who leant over to say something to his friend. He was wearing a Muggle T-shirt; a strip of rich brown skin showed above the waistline of his trousers. “No reason.”
He rubbed his nose against Harry’s – slow, affectionate – and stepped back. Harry felt the loss immediately, cold air rushing to fill the place Malfoy had been. He reluctantly opened his eyes and squinted through his foggy glasses. Malfoy ran a hand through his hair and smiled ruefully with red, swollen lips. Harry grabbed the desk again to keep from yanking him back.
He’s right; mine are prettier. Where I assume his Dark Mark used to be is now a gnarled, lumpy stretch of skin. I’m familiar with the texture of it from visits to Charlie’s—it’s a burn scar. A bloody serious one.
Malfoy lost his professional formality quicker each time they met outside of the office. This time, it was barely ten minutes before he was laughing, his limbs long and loose, practically lounging in his seat. His leg pressed against Harry’s under the table. Harry could barely stand it.
It was just the lingering effects of the ritual. It was their newly shared magic’s reluctance to separate. That had to be the reason it felt like he’d float off the face of the earth if he let go.
“It can be,” Malfoy said. “Granger mentioned that your Occlumency tutor had been rather heavy-handed. She was not too polite about it – but I suspect he thought you would react instinctively to a more brutal approach.”
“What?” Harry said, grinning. “It’s true! You told me as much! Remember, the first time you showed me all the books in your spare room?”
Obviously, there was the thing with Hermione. But that’s hardly my fault—Hermione’s brilliant, isn’t she? Everyone who knew her in school fancied her. Of course, not many people actually got to know her properly—most other kids avoided us, either because they thought Harry was a nutter, or because they thought Harry was intimidatingly famous, or because they thought Hermione was a massive pain in the arse. And that’s fair, because all three were true. But take Neville, for example: not bothered in the slightest by all the Boy Who Lived shit, but absolutely obsessed with Hermione. I mean, he was too scared to say more than three words to her, but still. I wasn’t the only one in the dorm mooning over her.
Harry looked down at the puddle that had formed beneath his feet. “Right,” he said. “Should I… Is there time for me to find a towel?”
A mug on the bedside table shattered. Malfoy flinched, his eyes snapping to the shards of ceramic. He looked back at Harry warily. “Potter?”
“Nah,” he says. “He just likes being bossy. He’s happiest when someone takes control from him, really.”
Malfoy quickly recovers from the flash of pain. He drops backwards, catching himself on his elbows, and thrusts roughly into Harry’s mouth. Harry’s eyes close and he sucks hard, chasing more blood. Malfoy moans, long and low.
This warped sense of grief was the only reason he could dredge up to explain his awful demand that morning. Of course Malfoy would never have shown Harry his memories of being a Death Eater. Harry was horrified that he’d even asked. Aside from anything else, it would have meant that Malfoy himself would have had to relive them. How could Harry have asked that of him? What had he been thinking?
He left the letter on the bed, tentatively donned a pair of glasses that were on the bedside table (only to find that the world, once resolved into sharp focus, was not any more familiar), and began to investigate the house he’d woken up in.
“Yes. We’ve spent a lot of time using the doors to connect memories. Today I want you to hide a memory behind a door so I can’t access it.”
Harry’s heart sank. In just five months, he’d witnessed enough fights between Ron and Hermione to be able to accurately identify which ones were going to end with an eye-roll and which ones were going to end with an explosion. He got the feeling that this was going to be the latter. He cast a quick
A younger Malfoy – short and sneering but unmistakable – gestured to a badge pinned to the front of his robes. The fifteen-year-old version of Harry scowled from ten feet away. The students in the stands were chanting something. Harry gazed up at them, fascinated. Had he recognised all these faces, once?
He woke in St Mungo’s two days later, limbs reattached and organs reinserted and wounds closed without a trace. He didn’t have time to feel relieved—Hermione, her lip bitten bloody, immediately flung herself on him, a stream of words gushing from her mouth into his shoulder. Harry didn’t understand a single one.
Neither of us looks away. I can’t, and he doesn’t, and Draco is none the wiser because his eyes have fallen closed and his head is lolling backwards onto Harry’s shoulder, his face twisted in pleasure—but this look between me and Harry feels too intimate when Harry’s boyfriend is right there, when Harry is inside him, alongside me, when Draco tenses and whimpers, “Don’t stop— Please don’t stop, I’m gonna come—”
Harry rubbed his forehead. “But how can they just do that? Why isn’t everyone writing up secret magical marriage contracts for their enemies, if it’s that easy?”
and would get a flash of surprise when nothing filled his waiting hand—the stomach-clenching jolt of falling into one of Hogwarts’s trick steps, thin air where something solid should be. On an insistent second attempt, whatever he’d wanted would soar right to him; he chalked up the initial lapse to lack of attention, to sloppy spell-casting.
The room reappeared around them. Harry reeled back. “You’re right.” He smiled tightly and stood. “Complete nonsense. Dunno what I was thinking.”
“Of a kind, Ms Granger, of a kind.” Brisley smiled indulgently at them. “Now, let me just find my glasses, give me a moment…”
“I haven’t heard from Brisley or Granger about your recovery for a few days,” Malfoy said carefully. “Are things still progressing as they should?”
“This was after I stormed out,” he said. He could almost hear the echo of the pounding headache he’d had. “I tried to write to you all afternoon, but I couldn’t figure out what to say.” Malfoy’s presence shifted inside his head. A waft of Earl Grey. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you.”
The humour disappeared from Malfoy’s face as if it had been wiped clean. “Oh, forgive me, Weasley. I should have known you wouldn’t understand.” His tone was achingly polite. “The joke is that twelve hours is quite a long time to spend reading case notes. Of course, I can’t imagine you’ve spent more than twelve hours reading over the entirety of the last ten years.”
Harry considered that as the sensation slipped down his chest, his stomach, lower. He and Malfoy winced at the exact same time, and Harry ultimately decided that he probably would prefer stabbing ice to boiling liquid—though his balls felt like they had retreated to somewhere in the region of his kidneys.
The pounding of Harry’s heartbeat twined with the pounding on the door. Six months. He was really doing this.
“What’s wrong?” Harry hissed. “You have the nerve… I don’t know why I expected any different from you. After everything you did…you’re scum.”
“Very kind,” Draco said drily. Then he smiled. “You will stay for the reception, won’t you, Mr Fryer? We’ve lined up the very best food and entertainment, if I say so myself. The No-Maj Matrix will be here in a few hours.”
“They’re nice, the flowers,” Harry tried, remembering Luna’s advice about compliments. “Pretty. What are they?”
mince pies. (“And don’t get me started on the outrage of that! How can you not like mince pies? Especially not the sacred ambrosia that comes from Madam Tamsworth’s incredible kitchen. Lord, the things I would do for her pastry.”) Harry had found himself several times in the embarrassing position of feeling jealous of a festive baked good.
The evenings he spent at the Leaky Cauldron added to his torture. Malfoy had taken to joining him, smoothly filling the vacant seat that Ron and Hermione had left. There was a strange feeling of reluctance, of compulsion, from both of them, like they knew that spending time together outside of the office was a bad idea, but neither of them were able to resist.
Draco’s past self was approaching the reception desk, holding the hand of little Agatha Arrington. The present Draco winced at the sight—he wasn’t, strictly speaking, supposed to touch patients, but Agatha had lost her mother in a neo-Death Eater attack six years after the War, and a session with her always left both of them feeling a little vulnerable.
After what felt like a long time, he sagged back against the bed. He was suddenly aware of the come cooling on his front, of the ache in his thighs, of the sharp pain in his bitten lip.
The words catch my attention like a fishhook in muddy water; I’m grateful to be yanked out of the murkiness in my head, but it’s painful. “What?” I ask sharply. “Hermione and Parkinson left? Together?”
He showed Malfoy the next fantasy, and the next, and the next. He showed Malfoy how Harry had touched himself all night, unable to stop, unable to get Malfoy out of his head. He showed Malfoy how Harry painstakingly scraped his mind into the Pensieve at the beginning of every session, how he strained to keep his mental doors closed, how putting his fantasies back into his head was like reliving them all over again, how he Apparated home every day and immediately got himself off. How he’d been sure that Malfoy must have known. How Harry wanted – how he
“Yeah, I’m okay. Bit stressed, maybe—I thought I was late, but Luna said I’m okay? Wasn’t it supposed to start at one o’clock?”
“Sorry!” the older sister said, still giggling. “We just wanted a bit of fresh air. Are we interrupting?”
While Draco acts out his fantasies through this glorious new medium, Potter explores him in turn. His hands are warm as they run down Draco’s sides. His nails are sharp when they dig into his flesh. His finger is tentative but steady when it runs along the scars that dissect Draco’s chest.
Draco sinks his teeth into the hard flesh of Potter’s neck and Potter’s question dissolves into a hiss, his fingers digging into Draco’s sides. Draco runs his tongue over the teeth marks, lets the flare of ownership flood through him, lets himself believe in the fantasy for a minute. He won’t let Potter heal the marks. He’ll make sure everyone can see them, make sure everyone knows that Draco gave them to him. He won’t mind their stares so much then.
Draco was staring, not at the ferret, but at the green smudge in the sky over the white fondant Manor. It could have been a Dark Mark. Maybe the flash of a Killing Curse. It could also have just been a green smudge.
Potter looks at him as if he’s just begged to be Celestina Warbeck’s new backup dancer. “What are you talking about, Azkaban?”
Tom did a double-take so big it was almost comical, but Harry wasn’t in a laughing mood. “Mister Potter!” he said, his smirk untwisting into a welcoming smile. “No, sir, no problem at all. What can I get you? Any drink for you is on the house.”
“You’re such a good kisser,” Draco breathed, pushing himself into Harry’s fist. “Look what you did to me.”
The crumpled letter from the Aurors was hot in Harry’s pocket. “How is this supposed to help? How is any of this supposed to help if we don’t even know what happened to me?”
“Even percentage-wise, it’s still no contest.” Malfoy’s eyes glittered. “Finally, I’ve beaten you at something.”
Harry gulped, and met Malfoy’s gaze. It was weird, to stare so intently into a stranger’s eyes. Malfoy’s dark eyelashes were the only things on his face that weren’t pale. It made his eyes strangely captivating. Now Harry was looking into them, he wasn’t sure he even wanted to look away.
“If that is the case, you need to be prepared for what you’d be going back to. It’s likely you’d have to implement some lifestyle changes to avoid this happening again. If I’m right, your previous self may also resist coming back. There is a chance – and I couldn’t tell you how great a chance it is – that if you do open the door, you might not wake up.”
“Do you want to tie me up and question me some more?” Malfoy asked, arching his back as Harry scraped his teeth along the smooth join between his neck and shoulder. “I could be hiding any number of nefarious things, you’ll have to interrogate me thoroughly to be sure.”
“You can’t,” he said, his voice breaking. “Please, Harry – I promise, I swear to you, I didn’t know, I don’t know how he knew. Don’t – don’t make me go back.” A tear rolled down his face to land on the letter. Harry snatched it from him.
After breakfast – wherein Kreacher made pointed comments about “nocturnal disturbances coming from Master’s bedroom” – Harry Apparated to St Mungo’s. He had grown accustomed to barging into Malfoy’s office without warning, any time between half past nine and half past ten. Today, he hovered in the corridor until ten o’clock sharp.
His awareness of his slow breathing and steady heartbeat was first to return. It was restored abruptly, like a lost part that had clicked back into place. He was alive, then. It was good to know.
“Plus,” Harry says, a little sheepishly, “he’s literally always up for it. That’s why I laughed—if anything, he’s the one not being satisfied. I can barely keep up with him.”
Malfoy tasted – Harry suppressed a wild laugh – he tasted like tea, like Earl Grey, but he wasn’t cool like his mental presence; the smooth skin of his neck was hot beneath Harry’s hands, and Harry wanted to take him apart.
That wasn’t to say that Harry resented their sessions. Quite the contrary – he found himself looking forward to the next one almost as soon as he left Malfoy’s office. But although Malfoy insisted that worrying about it was unhelpful, that six-month time limit was looming ever closer…
Malfoy stayed close as they left the pub and lingered outside the door. It was the moment where one of them should have announced that they were heading home, that they’d see each other tomorrow, but Harry certainly wasn’t going to be the one to initiate their parting.
“Shit.” Harry pressed his face into Draco’s sternum, his glasses smushing into his eyelids. “You’re killing me.”
Harry spun on his heel and started to pace. What should he do? He knew what the right thing would be – tell Lucius Malfoy where to stuff his threats. But if the alternative was losing everything…and it wasn’t as if he didn’t have the Galleons to spare…
“On the contrary. You learned to identify when the spell had been cast and truly recognise a presence in your mind.”
“Are you joking? The way he looked at you when you told him your name. I told him where he could shove his fundraiser – in slightly harsher words.”
Draco automatically made the appropriate interested noises and asked the appropriate interested questions, and by the time Potter had finished chuckling about the sweet revenge he’d taken on Brisley’s abhorrent cuckoo clock, they were halfway through the meal.
“Not very helpful, then?” Harry sat gingerly on the wingback chair, pleased to find it was more comfortable than it looked.
, on his knees on a four-poster bed with ribbons wrapped around the whole length of him, circling his neck, winding down his arms, tying his wrists behind his back, twisting down each thigh, binding his ankles, and, worst of all, looping around the base of his erection, which stood hard and proud from a neat bow of green and silver.
“Goddamn it, get up,” Harry barked. His fingers twitched in the absence of his wand. He cursed himself for forgetting it.
Second to return was a searing pain that throbbed right over his scar. At this, the rest of his consciousness abruptly flooded back. Panic shot through him. He fumbled under his pillow for his wand. His eyes were gummed shut.
He turned back to Malfoy. “You scheduled someone else in my spot?” he demanded. “When did you even get a chance to do that?”
“You were such a mess last night, by the way,” Draco said affectionately. “I have Hangover Potion in the cupboard if you want— Oh!” He glanced over his shoulder and realised that Harry was not, in fact, Pansy Parkinson. He blinked. “Hello, Potter,” he said warily. “I thought you were Pansy.”
Harry’s eyes burned into Draco’s. Draco felt like he could fall forwards into them and land in the smoky sweetness of Harry’s mind without even lifting his wand.
Malfoy grabbed Harry’s arm. “It’s fine,” Malfoy said. Harry stared at Malfoy’s fingers wrapped around his bicep. Malfoy let go quickly. Harry still felt the echo of his grip. “Really. I think you have some things to discuss with your friends.”
“I didn’t,” Harry growled, biting Malfoy’s lip and running his hand down Malfoy’s side to yank up his shirt. “I didn’t come back for this. That’s not – I’m here for answers.”
“Now, really, Mr Potter, I’m not going to barge in on a senior figure’s private session, not even for you!” Healer Brisley gave an uneasy chuckle. “I’m sure he meant that he would visit later on, once you’re in recovery–”
,” and leaves as quickly as he entered. For the first time all night, the air is cool on his skin. Malfoy’s blood has warmed him.
“Not ideal, no.” Malfoy hesitated. “But, honestly, it might mean nothing so significant. It could just be that you’ve recently been – so inspired, as it were.”
It was the first time he’d been back. He was amused to note that he hadn’t made up the room from scratch, as he’d assumed – it was almost identical to the Gryffindor boys’ dormitory. The five doors – all the same size now – stood along the walls where the five beds had been. All of them were ajar except one.
“No, it’s fine,” Malfoy said. He moved his leg away from Harry’s. Harry mourned the loss of it immediately. “What is it?”
Harry studied the unfamiliar handwriting idly for a moment, then gave up trying to guess and opened the envelope with a slide of his thumb. He looked at the signature first, and felt the bed fall away from under him. He sat up abruptly.
“I don’t have time for any of this,” Harry told him. “The quicker Tom stops arsing around pretending to be some virtuous hand of justice, the quicker I can go home.”
And, despite everything, Harry couldn’t look away. The indescribable feeling of thrusting into Malfoy’s hot mouth, of Malfoy having asked for it, wanting it, taking it – of knowing this was
“You’re going to have to take those off,” Draco said, his head tipped back so Harry could kiss down his throat again. His skin smelled like his scarf had – tea and pine and potions. Harry inhaled deeply, pressed open-mouthed kisses down Draco’s neck, bit at the juncture of his shoulder.
Harry, already on guard from Malfoy’s earlier outburst, felt a twinge of annoyance. What did Malfoy mean by “if you wish to continue”? Did he think the only reason Harry hadn’t got his memory back yet was because he hadn’t been bothered to stick with something for longer than a day?
” he demanded, rough and insistent and completely, utterly irresistible. “Fuck me, Draco. Please. Fuck me,
“Call me Draco, then,” he says casually, but Harry’s raised eyebrows make me suspect I shouldn’t take this peace offering for granted. I bite back the joke I was about to make.
“Isn’t it just.” Malfoy’s pointy nose pinched in disapproval. “You’d think there’d be something useful in fifty feet of parchment, wouldn’t you?”
I hum in agreement and regret it immediately. A hum. What was I thinking? A fucking hum. He’ll think I’m getting turned on thinking about him and Malfoy having sex. Also, more importantly, why the bloody hell am I getting turned on thinking about him and Malfoy having sex??
“You didn’t force me to do anything,” Potter says firmly. He’s still holding Draco’s shoulders. “I wasn’t the one who thought it wasn’t real.”
at Robards’s request. He answered their questions in a bored monotone (“When did your magic start disappearing?”—“I don’t know. I don’t use magic if I can help it.”—“Why did you move to Wales?”—“Why would I stay here?”—“Were you aware of the existence of a marriage contract with your name on it?”—“What? No. Are you serious? To whom?”) then sat silently, shoulders back and eyes narrowed, as Robards explained. He gave Harry a look of pure disgust at the end of it, then bowed his head and said in a quiet voice, “My mother did this?”
The melodious note is absent from his voice, but Malfoy nods and obeys, pulling off his shirt and discarding it as he goes. Harry catches it before it hits the floor, sucks at the maddening patch of blood on the collar. The richness is polluted by soap, but heightened by sweat and the salt of his skin. Harry swears and buries his face in it, trying to concentrate on the neutral smell of the fabric, trying to regain the control that Malfoy effortlessly obliterated.
Harry pulled his attention away from the window and braced himself for the usual routine interrogation. He was certain that every single Mind Healer worked from the exact same textbook. Harry reckoned he could recite it by heart at this point.
It wasn’t that Ginny didn’t understand. It was just that she was being logical about it, which Harry couldn’t bring himself to do. Sirius hadn’t even liked it here, she would say. He’d hated it as a child and he’d hated it as an adult. He of all people wouldn’t have wanted Harry to be cooped up here as Sirius himself had been. He of all people would have wanted Harry to be happy.
“Oh.” Potter chews his lip and looks away. Draco takes one last chance to drink him in. The real him. His face is sharper without the glasses. Draco likes it.
“Are you kidding? It was bloody brilliant.” The grin took over Harry’s face again. “Never been so excited to see plants. At least, I don’t think I have.”
The next few hours were … really nice. The buzz of the alcohol and the novelty of being around Malfoy and not being desperately afraid he would see anything untoward in Harry’s head lifted Harry’s spirits. He found himself smiling and laughing in a way he hadn’t done for weeks. Malfoy’s leg was touching Harry’s under the table and he looked pink and pleased every time Harry laughed at one of his jokes, and eventually Harry had unwound enough to take a deep breath and say, “So, erm. I wanted to ask you something.”
Somehow, despite Harry’s memory loss not being public to begin with, the news of his recovery had made it back to Head Auror Robards. Harry was pulled in for a lengthy interrogation about whether he still wanted to be an Auror (yes), whether he was ready for active duty (no) and whether his head was fixed yet (mostly). He wore his uniform to the meeting out of habit – it was only once he got home and caught sight of himself in the mirror that he realised the only time he’d seen himself wearing it in the last six months had been inside Malfoy’s mind. Harry pulled the robes off and shoved them in the back of the wardrobe out of sight.
“Have you ever done this before?” he asks breathlessly. “It feels fucking amazing. I never knew – Next time I wanna do it to you, show you how it feels.”
“Right.” Brisley settled herself into her chair like a hen on a nest. “Well, as I said in the letter, I’ve been working on convincing a top-level specialist to take an interest in your case, Mr Potter, and I’m pleased to say that he’s finally agreed!”
Harry dug his fingers in. Malfoy was still moving, a slow gyration that was driving Harry wild, but he seemed content to wait for Harry to do most of the work. “Are you sure,” Harry ground out, not certain he’d be able to pull out if Malfoy said no. “Are you sure you want–”
Malfoy nodded once, chin held high, and disappeared into the flames. Harry stared at the smouldering firewood left in his wake. He hadn’t seen or even thought about Malfoy for years. What was Harry playing at, giving him a bagful of Galleons? If their positions were reversed, the only thing Malfoy would have given him would have been a triumphant sneer and a door slammed in Harry’s face.
, Harry thought at him—and that purposeful mental communication, that control he’d developed under Draco’s tutelage, had Draco mindlessly thrusting deeper into Harry’s heat.
Harry fell silent immediately. Malfoy’s mask of professionalism had shattered; he looked dark, dangerous. His eyes were silver knives. He prowled towards Harry. Shoved him. The backs of Harry’s thighs hit the desk.
Potter shrugged. He kept looking at Draco, his head tilted to one side. He didn’t say anything else.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but the words withered in his throat. He stared at the twisted scar on Malfoy’s left arm.
“No.” Malfoy grimaced. “Merlin. Okay. This is the last I’ll say about it, since there’s no point keeping it from you after – well.” He took a deep breath. “The other night was … beyond anything I had ever imagined. You’re not harassing me. I like that you told me. I like what we did. I like that you keep telling me.”
He had barely stood and brushed his knees of dust when Kreacher reappeared, the robes of the bushy-haired woman from the photographs clenched in his small fist.
Half an hour after their meeting with Brisley and Malfoy, Harry ducked through the door into the pub. The barman grinned toothily and waved him towards their usual table. Hermione wasn’t there yet, but Ron was, fiddling with a broken Decoy Detonator with his tongue poking between his teeth. Harry had only just joined him when the bell above the door tinkled again and a harried-looking Hermione burst through. Harry waved, and she sagged, taking in his position next to Ron with obvious disappointment. Harry tried not to be offended.
“I see,” he said bitterly. The pounding in his head seemed to intensify. “You’re constantly holding yourself back from hexing me, is that it?”
“Aside from that one thing, I’m fine,” Harry amended. “It’s not a big deal, though, right? People Splinch themselves all the time. And technically I still haven’t taken my test, so it’s hardly surprising.” He grinned, but Hermione still looked grave.
“Is that where you dashed off to?” Given that the meeting with Malfoy hadn’t finished until two o’clock, Harry had expected them to head straight to the pub together, but Hermione had made hasty apologies and disappeared almost immediately after Malfoy had left.
“You could pay him for now, and we could figure out a way to shut him up later. We could Obliviate him, or – or find out how he knew and destroy any evidence. We can solve this together.” Malfoy moved his hand up to Harry’s neck and leaned closer. “Please don’t take this away.”
He tuts indulgently, as if I’m being intentionally silly but he didn’t expect anything better. “That you’re in love with him, obviously.”
I try to nod sympathetically, but the truth is—I’ve been on the receiving end of that conversation, and that’s pretty awkward, too. It makes you second-guess yourself every time you try to initiate something. Makes you analyse every previous encounter—wondering whether you’ve accidentally pressured them into it, wondering whether you’ve been overbearing or annoying or made them feel bad for turning you down.
His eyes rake over Malfoy, searching out more red, more blood, and he’s drawn again to Malfoy’s cock, which stands hard and flushed and tempting. Malfoy notices.
“Let them in, Harry.” Harry couldn’t see Malfoy any more, but he could still feel him. “You can do this.”
He left St Mungo’s in a daze and walked the familiar fifteen minutes down Oxford Street to the Leaky Cauldron. When he arrived, Ron and Hermione were sitting at their usual table, heads together, deep in conversation. Harry stood by the door and watched them for a moment. His eyes followed the way Hermione’s fingers smoothed out the sleeve of Ron’s robe, the way Ron absently caught them in his, neither of them paying the slightest bit of attention to what their hands were doing while they talked. How long did two people have to know each other for their bodies to thoughtlessly love each other in such small ways? If it was ten years, fifteen years, and Harry didn’t get his memory back in the next two months, he might not have anything like that until he was forty years old.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, then raised his wand again. “All right,” he said, holding Harry’s gaze. “I’m going to cast after three. One … two … three …
The chest shuddered, thick iron legs thudding against the desk. Malfoy rolled his eyes, gestured sharply for Ron to stand up, then flung himself into Ron’s vacated chair. He grabbed Harry’s hand—Harry, stunned, let him take it. Malfoy’s fingers were cold.
“Because that’s when I got kicked out!” Despite Harry’s rough treatment, it was the first time in the last few days that Harry had heard an edge to Malfoy’s voice. “And then Gringotts wouldn’t let me in, and once Parkinson found out I was disinherited, she laughed in my face, and I wandered the streets of Muggle London for hours thinking about how you told me your address after my trial and I knew you would help and I – I wanted to see you, I’ve thought about it so much over the last few years but I didn’t think it would – I didn’t know you would – I never thought you’d say yes to this–”
“Yeah.” Malfoy clears his throat. “Yes. I’m rather miffed it didn’t work, actually. I didn’t expect you for another few hours.” He does sound miffed, and his nose wrinkles, and Harry locks his limbs against the urge to
Draco’s stomach swooped, his cock aching from how ready he was, from how much he wanted. But he couldn’t help but drag this out, couldn’t help but stare at the incredible, impossible sight of Harry Potter desperately fucking himself on Draco’s hand. Each clench of his hole sent sparks of sensation up his arm, down his chest, straight to his cock.
“Harry—” Draco gasps, and I try very hard not to be miffed that it’s not my name he’s crying. “Harry, please, I want—”
St Mungo’s. With another throb of his head, the world warped and resettled around him. St Mungo’s. Yes, that made sense. He must have got hurt on a case – which one? The Yaxley murders? Another throb – the Yaxley murders had been years ago, when he was fresh on the job and Ron was still his partner. Maybe it had been the Thistlewood disappearance? The Poesy plot? The images appeared unsteadily one by one in his head, as if balanced precariously on top of one another.
“Yeah. See, yesterday, I thought I wouldn’t see this person I really like until next year” – Harry dragged his mouth over the sharp line of Draco’s jaw – “but then he invited me over to his house to give me a Christmas present. So now” – he kissed the end of Draco’s pointy chin – “I’m beginning to wonder if he might like me too.” He ran his nose over the side of Draco’s face, pressed his lips to the very corner of Draco’s wonderful, clever mouth.
“I’ve heard something like that, yeah,” Harry said wryly. He had been told as much by at least fifty different people over the last few months.
Harry considered. “Hogwarts?” he suggested. “I was only there for a couple of hours, right back at the beginning.”
Malfoy looked up at him then, his smirk evident even as his mouth was full, and Harry dropped his head back and swore.
“What?” Potter glances at the time distractedly. He’s still panting, still thrusting his hips minutely, his cock rubbing against Draco’s. “We’ve got ages.”
Instead, he leans over until his face is lined up with Potter’s, holding himself on unsteady arms. He takes one last long look, drinking in Potter’s chapped lips, the fine hairs between his eyebrows, all the tiny details he’ll never get to see again, then kisses him, slow and soft and deep. Potter makes a contented little noise that feels like a stab in the gut and kisses him back. Draco wants to cry.
Draco moaned and kissed him so roughly their teeth clashed together. He felt Harry’s smile against his mouth—and fuck, that made his stomach
Draco moans in satisfaction. I’m starting to think Harry underplayed the truth when he said Draco was adventurous in bed. I lean my head as far back as the headboard allows and stare incredulously up at him.
“For one of them, the colour of the sea when we fought that counterfeit cauldron syndicate on the cliffs in Shetland.” Harry had been distracted all the way through that duel; the stormy grey-blue of the waves crashing below them had been the exact shade of Draco’s eyes.
With the strange musical note in his voice, Harry could ask anything of Malfoy, and Malfoy would give it. Harry could drain Malfoy of every drop of blood (a thrill shoots through him at the thought) and Malfoy would let him, would want him to, would beg for it.
Harry hadn’t given Narcissa Malfoy much thought, other than resenting her for signing their lives away. It hadn’t occurred to him that Draco might feel differently—might actually have wanted her here, if she were still alive.
“You too,” he said gruffly. “Good job with all of it, really. All the stuff for today, I mean. It all looks great.”
It was unbearably warm in Grimmauld Place. For the seventh day in a row, Harry found himself hunched over his desk, the room lit only by the dusk sky through the grubby window. It was summer, and it shouldn’t be fully dark outside for another hour yet. But Grimmauld Place was always somehow darker and drearier than the rest of the world.
“Yeah.” Harry cleared his throat, fighting a smile. “Yeah, okay. Six o’clock works. That would be nice.”
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Welcome back to my humble abode,” he said, his eyes – so much brighter than last time – following Harry as he approached. “Please, do make yourself at home –
“You can call me Draco.” Draco tried to smirk, but his face wouldn’t quite obey him. His mouth still hung half-open at the sight of Harry—his cock hard and flushed and pushing up into Draco’s fist.
A silvery cat streaked up to them. “About fucking time,” it hissed in Pansy Parkinson’s voice, then promptly vanished in a wisp of smoke.
“I – I can’t have!” Hermione rifles through her bag and holds out a stack of books. “I only got these out on Thursday!”
“When I walked into the Forbidden Forest to get murdered by Voldemort,” Harry says blithely, following Hermione through the double doors of the library’s entrance. “And speaking of despots…”
“I mean it,” Potter insists. He meets Draco’s gaze and there’s that look again – the one that’s so unbelievably
Harry shrugged. “Not much to say to them, really. None of us want to get in any more fights, so we just sit there in silence whenever I go over. It’s better than arguing, I suppose.”
Harry lifted his head with a wet pop and loosened his aching jaw. The flush across Draco’s chest had deepened to a dull red, revealing thin white scars that slashed from his neck to his navel. His eyes were dark and wild, and his hair was loose and messy, spread like snow over the dark bedsheets.
Hermione Side-Alonged him to St Mungo’s for the first of his daily check-ups with Healer Brisley. Harry automatically led them to the fourth floor. They were almost at Malfoy’s door when Hermione pointed out they were in completely the wrong part of the hospital. Harry’s face heated and he whirled back towards the stairwell without a word. He couldn’t think about it yet. He couldn’t stop thinking about it.
“I want to.” He forces away the ache of longing. “Merlin, I want to.” He’s struggling with the buttons – Potter’s cock is too distracting. It’s so hard and so
Of course, when the waiter arrived at their table seconds later, quill in hand, Draco was entirely unprepared. Unwilling to admit to his discomposure, he smoothly ordered the first items his gaze landed on: roast lamb with a glass of Chardonnay. Heat crept up his neck as soon as the words left his mouth. Lamb with white wine? Humiliating. The waiter made no comment, but Draco could feel the weight of his silent judgement—even as Potter ordered fish and chips with a beer, the brute.
“Huh.” Harry raked his eyes over the page again, taking in as much as he could. “Do the Aurors have this?”
It was a stark contrast to the guilty afternoons they had spent together in the Leaky Cauldron. Back then, Harry would lounge in his seat with his back to the room, his eyes fixed on Draco like he was the only person in the world.
“I’m not moving,” Draco says, as if in response to Harry’s thoughts. His voice is muffled, spoken into Harry’s shoulder. “It’s two in the morning and I’ve just jizzed all over you. I’m not moving and you can’t make me.”
Harry concentrated. He thought about leathery wings and white, staring eyes. Hot breath that smelled like meat. “No,” he said firmly.
“You’re being stupid,” Harry says. Even so, he can’t stop himself from taking three slow, prowling steps towards Malfoy. “You know I can’t control it. Not when it’s been this long. Not when you smell so
Harry lunged upwards and kissed him. He was stretched over the length of Draco, pressing down on him – Draco’s arms, still trapped under him, couldn’t have been comfortable, but he didn’t complain. Rather, he strained upwards with a whine, with little hitched breaths, with inviting rolls of his hips. Harry couldn’t stop himself from thrusting, chasing the addictive thrill of hot skin sliding against hot skin.
“Chelsea,” Harry said, and the journey flashed in front of him – the walk from Knightsbridge, the bustling Muggle high street, the white-accented townhouses of quieter neighbourhoods. “Sorry,” he said. He tried to focus on the garden again.
“I still have some of that Odgen’s left at home.” Harry’s heart was thumping madly. “Do you want to come back to mine?”
It was much worse now. Now they’d been inside each other’s minds, their fantasies. Now Harry knew how Draco felt. Now they’d kissed.
“You spent a lot of time here while you were my patient,” he said. It wasn’t quite his usual calm tone. “The environment evokes memories of the last few months. Makes them stronger, more immediate, than the ones from before.”
Harry stands and approaches me. Malfoy stays where he is. I’m glad; I’m so on edge that I’m worried my old Auror training instincts will kick in and I’ll fling a hex at him. I can’t imagine that would make this any less awkward.
Despite the lingering embarrassment of his own vulnerability, despite the thrill of Harry’s closeness, Draco grinned. “Actually, the usual safeword I use with patients is ‘Hogwarts’. I just wanted to make you say it.”
you get into Mind Magic? I think you said something about—you needed to learn Occlumency? When you were younger?”
So, when Malfoy said he wanted to teach Harry a new skill – how to focus on specific details within memories – Harry was quick to say, “Can you show me? Can I see in your head?”
There was a rant building in the back of Harry’s throat. He felt no need to stifle it. “Well if it’s not that, then what? Have you been letting Ron get to you? You’re not stupid enough to think I’m on his side, are you? He had no right to talk to you like that.”
Draco does it again, spearing Potter on his tongue, twisting his hand around the head of Potter’s cock, digging his nails into the flesh of Potter’s arse. He’s shaking, struggling to keep it together, but Potter is worse – he’s
Lost his memory? That was ridiculous – his problem was that he had too many memories, all jumbled together out of order. It seemed like yesterday that he’d stood in a quiet underground room gazing up at hundreds of flitting keys, while Oliver Wood’s thirtieth birthday drinks – and the subsequent lengthy hangover – felt like decades ago. Ginny speeding across the skies in a Harpies uniform morphed into her smiling shyly from across the Gryffindor common room. Lucius Malfoy’s sneer in the Top Box at the Quidditch World Cup jerkily became Draco striding towards him, throwing locking spells at his office door and pushing him so the backs of his thighs hit the desk–
Malfoy shook his head, those eyes pinning Harry to his chair. “Just – flashes of thought. Nothing visual.”
“Yeah,” she said, and grimaced. “Anyway, I know I thanked you then, but I just wanted to say … talking to you really changed my life, you know? The stuff you said about how you grew up, your family and all of that, it really helped me to get out of the situation I was in. I know you probably get this a lot, but I’ll never forget what you did. Really. Thank you so much.”
Draco’s mouth was hot and soft, and he tasted faintly minty, like he’d recently brushed his teeth. The skin of his jaw was smooth – no rough stubble, not like Harry’s own face – and Harry had never felt anything so achingly perfect.
“Really!” Harry protested. “I just – I dunno. I sort of expected to have recovered a few more memories by now. It’s fine, it’s just – I thought it would be a bit more like it was in that first session, you know?”
Harry hesitated. Draco had never known him, memory or no memory, to think about something for more than a single second before saying it; the haze around him dissipated slightly at the unnerving novelty of it. “What? Tell me.”
“Good,” Malfoy says, “because I just saw her leave with Parkinson. Pansy will have her begging for it within twenty minutes.”
Malfoy’s eyes flicked to Ron and Hermione. Harry turned to look, too; Hermione smiled encouragingly. Even Ron nodded.
Potter walks haltingly to Draco’s bed. Draco gets eagerly to his feet and circles him, studying him in a way he never normally can, taking in every detail. His eyes linger on the familiar curl of Potter’s hair, the smudges on his glasses, the shadow of stubble on his chin. Potter lets it happen, his expression bewildered. It’s deliciously authentic.
He didn’t remind her – they’d argued about it quite enough by that point. And, once he realised what the package was, he knew it wouldn’t be Pansy Parkinson who’d be visiting him when he used it.
Harry took a deep breath. He remembered the stillness, the peace, the owl at his window. The letter from Hermione – the hundreds of other letters he’d received over the last few months. The Head Auror asking him whether he could make a few appearances. People thanking him, criticising him, asking him for help. Foreign dignitaries requesting his presence at events and parties and conferences. Pages and pages and pages from St Mungo’s –
“It’s like being attacked by an overly affectionate pigeon,” Draco complained with an amused huff. “I never thought you’d be like this.”
But if he hadn’t had his memories last year, that freckled teenage girl would still be in whatever awful situation she had been in. How many people could he have helped over the last six months? How many lives could he have saved if he’d been on duty as an Auror? How much good could he do in the world, once he could remember his place in it?
“I really don’t know what I’m supposed to be feeling.” Frustration began to build in Harry’s stomach. It didn’t help that he couldn’t look away from Malfoy, his bright, joyful laugh playing over and over.
Draco had paid an extra ten Galleons to guarantee the most private spot in the restaurant. When Potter immediately made a beeline for the chair against the wall, he knew he’d made the right decision. He’d suspected Potter would have a preference, now—but it was still unnerving to watch his eyes dart around the room as they settled into the stiff, high-backed chairs.
Harry let out a shaky breath. He had been prepared to grovel, to beg Malfoy to take him back (and something new and dark at the back of his mind perked up at the thought of “Malfoy” and “begging”), yet Malfoy was inviting him in like nothing had happened.
“Right now.” Harry straightened, convinced his idea was brilliant. “Look at what I’m thinking right now and tell me I haven’t wanted you for weeks.”
The room was filled with the resonant sound of ringing bells. Everyone was on their feet, still clapping; the officiwizard waved his wand and the rows of chairs vanished. Another wave and tables appeared along the edges of the room, laden with food.
Harry knew how to handle Draco’s jibes and smirks. He knew how to handle them in the office – with an eye-roll or a sarcastic retort – and he knew how to handle them when he remembered them later, in the privacy of his bedroom – his hand clenched around his cock, his face screwed up in pleasure. But he did not know how to handle a Draco who was hesitant. A Draco who wasn’t making
Malfoy whimpered and dragged himself upright to smash his mouth against Harry’s, his hand clenched tight in Harry’s hair. But the intensity faded slowly, passion dissolving into sweetness like sugar in tea. Malfoy’s hand moved from Harry’s hair to cup his jaw. Harry leaned into the unexpected tenderness of it.
Then the fuzzy shape of a small, scruffy owl landed on the outside windowsill and pecked on the glass.
“You expect me to believe that?” Sweat prickled on his forehead; he shook his hair out of his face impatiently and increased the pace of his hips, gripping Malfoy’s legs and spreading him wider. “Some name you just made up?”
My mouth hangs open, which is unfortunate, because when Harry wraps his lips around the end of my cock and takes it into his mouth, a low moan is wrenched right out of me.
Malfoy said something else, his voice slipping neatly back into the soft, distant, understanding tones of Mind Healer Malfoy, but Harry wasn’t listening.
Ginny had said fine, then. And she went alone. She’d been gone a week and Harry had barely had time to miss her; he’d spent almost every minute since she’d left poring over files and chasing leads that did not actually lead anywhere. He hadn’t eaten in days, he hadn’t slept for longer than twenty minutes at a time…but he needed to solve this case. It was his job.
“Erm, hello?” Hermione snapped her fingers in front of Ron’s face; he swatted her hand away angrily. “I’m perfectly able to remember our history with Draco, thank you,” she said. “And I was having quite an enjoyable conversation with him before you started having your little tantrum.”
Summoning the visuals of a fantasy through Legilimency is one thing; replicating physical sensation is entirely another. Draco severely underestimated those ostentatious Weasley twins. Twin.
“You do mock poor Kreacher,” Kreacher declared, pointing a bony finger, “but Kreacher is a good and obedient elf, and Kreacher will do Master Harry’s bidding.”
Hermione let out a huff of exasperation. At the same instant, Healer Brisley’s cuckoo clock – one of Harry’s least favourite objects in the world – began to hoot. Harry glared at the ugly bird as it fought its way free of the tiny wooden doors.
Harry had easily called up his mental space—there was no pounding now, and the fifth door hung serenely open, the same size as the other four. But Draco didn’t have a chance to comment on the change; with easy control, Harry guided them into a memory, and the quiet stone room smoothly transformed into the reception area of St Mungo’s. Potter—in Auror robes—stood by the fireplace, talking to miserable old Healer Morgan. The details of the conversation itself were muffled—not because Harry’s mental control wasn’t up to scratch, but because at the time, Potter hadn’t been paying Healer Morgan the slightest bit of attention.
“Well, what would you prefer?” There was a faint note of hysteria in Draco’s voice. Harry realised he wasn’t acting very grateful for his present.
Harry stares at the TV and tries to calm down. But the man gripping the bunch of asparagus on the Sainsbury’s advert isn’t helping, and Harry squirms before he can stop himself. Draco makes a soft noise of complaint. His hand twitches. Harry freezes.
“Show me.” The words were out before Draco could stop them. Potter had offered, yesterday in Draco’s office, but Draco still had no right to ask. It was completely unethical.
Harry hummed and did as he was bid, concentrating on the heaviness of the door as it closed, the squelch of a
Potter extinguished the flame under the kettle without looking away from Draco. “I meant it, you know. I really haven’t stopped thinking about that kiss ever since I remembered it again. I haven’t stopped thinking about you.”
“Fuck off.” To cover my embarrassment, I pull Malfoy into another kiss. He snickers but allows it, opening his mouth easily against mine. I can taste the salt of my skin on his tongue. Harry’s fingers work their way down the buttons of my flies. My jeans fall to the floor.
“Don’t clean that up,” he says (if he does have fifty more minutes, he’s going to lick Potter’s chest clean himself) and wrenches himself away, ignoring Potter’s noise of protest. He grabs his wand and dashes across the room to the Daydream Charm box, which is lying abandoned on his bed.
Potter hands it to him, casually, as if he’s not naked and come-smeared and defenceless, as if Draco doesn’t have a Dark Mark etched into his arm.
Harry didn’t move. Draco wasn’t lying: he was tied up. Literally, gloriously, devastatingly tied up. And he was naked. Naked and
“You should have brought an umbrella,” Luna told him. “They trap your thoughts, so I understand why you didn’t want to, but it probably would have been for the best. I couldn’t save your flower.”
He tried to keep Malfoy out of his head. He thought of Ron’s sister, with whom he had apparently been in a relationship for years – but, having only met her once, he didn’t have much to draw on. He thought of the stranger in the Leaky Cauldron, the way his nose had crinkled when he’d smiled at Harry – but when Harry imagined kissing him, touching him, his soft features became pale and pointy, his dark eyes faded to grey.
His voice lowered towards the end of the sentence. Draco held his breath so he didn’t say anything stupid. Potter must have known how much Draco craved his attention, his approval—how much he’d craved it for years, for as long as they’d known each other.
Harry almost felt like crying himself. How was he supposed to know the truth? There was nowhere he could go – nobody he could talk to about this. It was all on him. He was all alone.
Harry went into the hallway, shivering as he left the warmth of the fire. “Yeah, it’s me. Where are you?”
“God.” Harry pulls a face and takes a drink as if to wash away the image. I join him, but there’s not enough beer in the world to drown out the hideous thought of Filch leering at me while I’ve got my kit off.
“I want too,” Harry says. He drops a kiss to Draco’s soft hair, lets the shimmer of pleasure wash through him. “Night, Draco.”
“Well, you see,” Harry says, very reasonably. “When I got here, this crowd of Ravenclaw girls was leaving, and they were asking all these questions. I had to run into the bathroom to get away from them. I was going to come straight back after they left.”
“Oh. Sorry,” Harry said. “Yeah, I’m ready.” He joined Malfoy in holding the strand of his hair over the bowl.
Malfoy seemed pleased at Harry’s reaction, but his voice was level when he answered. “Mind Magic is actually not very widely studied in Britain,” he said. “There are only a few advanced books written on the subject, and all of them are, quite frankly, outdated. Many who work with Mind Magic refuse to consider building on the foundations that have been previously laid out. I do not.”
He was reminded of the last time they’d left the pub together. Leaning against the wall, hot anger chased away by Malfoy’s lazy smile, the sharp curve of it painted peach by the sunset. Harry had asked if Malfoy had wanted to come home with him that night. They had been interrupted before Malfoy had had a chance to reply. If Harry asked now, what would Malfoy say? Now Harry knew what he’d really been asking, what it was he’d really wanted, could he do it again?
“You haven’t – I’m sure you haven’t failed anyone!” He reached out a hand to pat Kreacher on the back, then thought better of it. “There, there,” he said helplessly. He only had four hours of memories; there was not much he felt qualified to do. Consoling a howling house-elf was definitely not within his skillset.
” He flinches as Harry allows his right eyetooth to nick the side of Malfoy’s cock. It’s not deep, but it’s enough, and a thin stream of hot, syrupy blood fills Harry’s mouth. Harry groans and starts to wank himself in earnest.
Harry had been working for six months to get his memory back. He’d done so much – so many meetings and tests, so much time spent in the bloody Leaky Cauldron, so many mental exercises and arguments and new experiences and frustrations. It had all been for this. He had to at least try. Even with the risk of losing Malfoy. Even with the risk of losing everything.
Malfoy didn’t move. He stood silhouetted against the window, staring out at the darkening orange sky. He looked…helpless.
Harry’s indulgence in sofa-sharing is why he’s waking up late Friday night—or is it early Saturday morning?—with Draco tucked into his side, the television that Draco insisted on bringing over from Wales (“I’ve missed too much
Harry nestled into the pillow. His wandering hands had stilled, and he was holding on to Draco’s wrist, thumb and forefinger wrapped around it like the world’s softest handcuff. It was far more effective than steel and magic would have been.
Malfoy hesitated, watching him warily. “Don’t try anything,” he warned. “You’re just there to get a sense of what it feels like. No snooping around. No barging through doors. All right?”
He woke to Hermione thundering through the house, shouting his name. He groaned out a weak protest, his head still delicate. He was rewarded with the door slamming open and a furious lecture about disappearing without telling someone where he was going. Attempts to point out that he was allowed to go into other rooms in his own house were met with hostility.
It took an age for the shuddering to subside. When Draco finally came back to himself, shaking and tentative, the world was unnaturally quiet.
Harry was about to protest, but a tap of drumsticks rang out, and The No-Maj Matrix sprung into action. The haphazard combination of instruments somehow produced a gently flowing waltz, Harry found himself being led across the floor.
.” His words were swallowed by a gasp as Harry grabbed his chin and aimed his wand. Malfoy’s neck moved against Harry’s fingers as he swallowed.
Right from the beginning, Harry had been fascinated by the mystery of Malfoy, had devoured every detail he could learn about him, but this was different. His pounding headache was suddenly almost audible in the silence of the room.
“Tell me,” Harry murmured, raking his hands through Draco’s hair. Draco’s knees threatened to buckle. “Tell me if I’m moving too fast, or—being presumptuous, or whatever—”
“Shit, Malfoy. Breathe,” he says, and Draco obeys him instinctively, dragging in a loud, painful breath through his mouth.
Ten minutes later, Harry found himself on the train, muttering the route to himself and checking the map at every stop, as if it might have changed since he last looked.
it was suspicious. He’d known it, had gone to Malfoy to confront him and then – what? Malfoy had batted his eyelashes, said he was innocent, and Harry had believed him?
“You’re pathetic,” Harry snapped. “I’m going to see Tom and get the rest of my money back. You need to leave right now and go back to your gutless father. Tell him he can do what he wants. I don’t care. I don’t want to see either of you ever again.”
“Fuck.” His hips bucked up into that hot, tight wetness, and Malfoy made a choked noise and drew his mouth back up, working his tongue around the head, closing his eyes in apparent relish. Harry let his head fall back again.
“If you intend to continue with this course of therapy,” he continued in that same distant, professional tone, “tonight I’d like you to practise visualising your mind as a physical space. If you can, picture a few of your memories from the last few months behind a locked door, in a closed box, whatever feels natural. This will form the basis of our work going forwards.”
Harry did want to know more about Malfoy’s past, but it felt like he’d pushed his luck enough already. “Let’s do it.”
His robes were just as fancy as Harry’s, but his were a shimmering deep turquoise that called to mind the sort of oceans that decorated the covers of travel brochures. His hair fell differently, somehow, in a way Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on. It looked softer. It suited him.
“I’m gonna come,” Malfoy gasps, his stomach tightening, his body curling around Harry’s head. “I’m gonna come, fuck, I’m – I’m gonna–”
He scrambled off the sofa and dashed upstairs, shedding yesterday’s clothes as he went. He arrived in the bathroom completely naked and jumped straight into the shower, squeaking manfully under the icy water until it warmed.
Malfoy recovers quickly and somehow, he already knows how to push my buttons. He slides a hand up my side and pinches my nipple and smirks against my mouth when my hips buck into his thigh. His soft robes drag against the skin of my stomach as he shifts sideways. I follow his mouth unthinkingly, still that stupid fish caught on his hook.
. They haven’t been as close as this at all, before. Harry shivers as he takes stock of their position.
He got to the final line and was about to let out a relieved laugh when a shimmer underneath the signature caught his attention. It was a slight shifting of light, nothing that most people would notice. It also happened to be the mark of a spell used within the Auror department to conceal confidential information.
“You better not be talking about Harry’s.” He drops both hands to my chest and uses them as leverage to fuck himself backwards with deeper and deeper thrusts. “Can you believe it, both of us with these dramatic disfigurements and his piddly little scar is the famous one?”
Over soon? It was never going to be over. He was going to be tied to Draco Malfoy for the rest of his life. But Harry did appreciate the thought—he really would feel better once the farce of the ceremony was done with and he could go back to Grimmauld Place.  They had to have two weeks together, away from other people—Ron and Malfoy both called it a honeymoon; Hermione insisted it was just a settling period for the spell and they wouldn’t actually need to—to do what couples usually did on a honeymoon. And then…
Slowly, over the next six months, more and more of Harry’s spells failed. It made sense, really: he was getting lazy. After all, since becoming a teacher, he was no longer being challenged by learning new spells every day. And Voldemort was long dead—Harry’s magic had probably been fuelled by sheer panic for the previous thirteen years. It was only natural that his spells would be weaker once he finally started to relax.
Harry lost himself in the sensations, the noises Malfoy was making, the sight of him – fuck, the sight of him – until he felt a tingling pressure begin to build. He threw his head back onto the pillow with a grunt and yanked Malfoy upwards. Malfoy gasped and sat back on his heels. He wiped his mouth with a shaking hand.
Across the desk, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry. “I’m going to cast one more time and enter your mind again,” he said. “Now you know what to look for, see if you can identify the feeling of the spell. Do you need a moment to prepare yourself?”
“You mean … the bed?” he tried. Perhaps Draco would have found it funny to gift Harry a bed that he’d just had a festive wank on. Maybe he just hadn’t finished in time, maybe he expected Harry to linger more on his journey upstairs. Or, shit, maybe he had someone else here. Maybe–
“Whoa.” The movement had been reflexive, automatic. Harry couldn’t remember having cast a Shield Charm before, but it had felt as natural as breathing, his body flowing easily into a defensive stance, one foot sliding behind the other, his torso turned to minimise the target. He’d known, because he’d been told, that he’d been an Auror. He hadn’t felt like one until that moment.
Malfoy is still clumsy, and his tongue catches on the point of Harry’s tooth. Blood spurts into their joined mouths – Harry hums appreciatively, but licks the wound closed and pulls away.
Malfoy’s head snapped up. “Potter.” He looked at Harry for a beat too long, as if he didn’t quite understand why Harry was there.
“Oh, well done, Potter. Keep talking about how you don’t intend to properly fulfil the binding magical contract while you’re
He tried to chase that freedom over the summer. He was banned from using magic outside of school, but he didn’t need magic to call the Knight Bus, and the pimpled conductor let him aboard without comment.
This time, Harry retained enough of himself that he didn’t collapse on the spot. He let Malfoy’s leg fall and sat on his heels, catching his breath, allowing his awareness to slowly expand away from Malfoy – beautiful, wrecked, come-smeared Malfoy. It had started raining at some point. A summer thunderstorm.
“I have work tomorrow,” he said, resting his forehead on Malfoy’s. “I can’t – this is the last time.”
“Yeah, I know, I know.” Harry grinned. “Well done on proving your point. What were you saying about mental space?”
I’m clinging to the edge with everything I have, but then Harry growls, “Let me see you come, Ron,” and that’s it. Orgasm crashes over me, curling my toes, clenching my fists and trying to squeeze my eyes shut—but there’s no way on earth I’m missing the sight of Harry watching me, of him swearing and thrusting and tensing as he follows me over the edge. His dick pulses against mine and I feel his hot spunk on the head of my cock. I fuck up into it, and shit, if that doesn’t send more waves of pleasure thrumming through me, the thought of Harry’s come coating my dick.
Malfoy shook his head and leaned towards Harry to reply, but Ron cut him off before he could speak. “I can’t believe I’m hearing this! Harry, mate, if you could remember what a shit he is, there’s no way you’d be seen dead at the same table as him.”
Malfoy smiled. “Wherever you want them to. That one, for example,” he pointed behind Harry, “takes you out of my office to the fourth floor corridor. If you have no other questions, you should go through it. I’ll see you at the same time tomorrow.”
The scene inside the room hadn’t changed much – the same grand fireplace, the same four-poster with rich, dark bedding. But now, a flush painted Draco’s cheeks and spilled down his neck, across his chest. His cock had drooped a bit, but it was still half-hard, jutting outwards from that green-and-silver bow. The fangs of the snake-head doorknob dug into the flesh of Harry’s palm.
Malfoy made a helpless noise. “You can’t just say something like that and then change the subject! Merlin, your impulse control is shocking, I can’t believe…” He narrowed his eyes and pointed accusingly at Harry. “How long do you wait between having a thought and immediately blurting it out?” he demanded. “Five seconds? Ten?”
“Really, though,” Harry continued, “who cares? I don’t care.” Malfoy was silent for long enough that Harry felt the need to ask, “Unless … you don’t want to?”
Everything about this was so wrong. Before now, Harry would have sworn on his life, on someone else’s life, that Malfoy issuing commands with that haughty look on his face would do nothing but piss him off. And yet, right now, it made Harry want to devour him.
“Harry,” Malfoy said, after a too-long pause. “Listen: there is a real possibility your memory will not be recovered, and, as I’m sure you know, the likelihood of recovery only gets smaller as time goes on. But I’ve reviewed your notes, and I think it’s likely that your memories have not been taken from you; they’re merely hidden – locked away within your own mind. It’s my professional opinion that a course of Legilimency-based therapy has the best chance of strengthening your mind and helping you to regain what you have lost.”
“I don’t know.” The loud thudding of his heartbeat was distracting – it was hard to think. “‘Familiar’ isn’t the right word. There’s just something about you…”
Harry dropped the scarf as if it had burned him. “Yeah – coming,” he said. “First door on the left?”
“I’m going to sink down on your thick cock and I’m going to fuck myself until I can’t take it any more,” he says in that same level tone. “I’m going to be so fucking tight around you and you’ll fill me up so much and I am going to
,” he says. “Remind me who just had you begging to come? Because I don’t recall it being Harry ‘can’t deepthroat anything bigger than a finger’ Potter.”
. Eighteen minutes left. Not long – not long enough – but, Merlin, he’s not going to forgo the chance to push his aching cock between Harry Potter’s lips. He wants to see Harry Potter suck Draco’s dick and
Malfoy had grown impatient with stealing kisses between words. He dropped his mouth to the underside of Harry’s jaw and began biting a trail down his neck.
“I’m going to have to start taking you to dinner, refine your palate,” Draco said sternly. A touch to Harry’s neck made him jump and look back, but it was just Draco absently fixing his collar. Harry wondered if Draco could feel the way Harry’s pulse sped up at the contact. “You can’t go on like this. It’s embarrassing. First week back after Christmas, we’re doing the tasting menu at Lakewend’s.”
Harry spent the afternoon at Ron and Hermione’s. They chatted about light things – schooldays, Quidditch, Weasley family drama. Harry recognised every name that Ron and Hermione tentatively mentioned, although his grasp of timelines was still shaky. He stayed for dinner (Ron cooked) and returned to Grimmauld Place after sundown.
“I was doing the exact same thing,” Harry said quickly. “I didn’t come here to stay, I just wanted to make sure you weren’t – I mean, I didn’t want you to think…”
“I can vouch for Harry – the proper Harry, with all his memories,” she said. Harry tried not to wince at her choice of words. “I think he’d be grateful you were willing to help him, Draco.”
After that, Harry stopped trying to resist. He’d rather be in a pub, warm and welcome, than digging his fingers into the dirt of Primrose Hill to keep himself away from the Leaky Cauldron, from Malfoy.
Harry had been focusing on the fifth door with single-minded intensity; he’d needed something to distract himself from the mounting awkwardness of delaying everything until Malfoy’s arrival.
“I like these,” he says, tracing a shaking finger over the faded swirls that the fifth-year visit to the Department of Mysteries left me with.
“Oh, nothing. Just—Well.” She shot him a smirk. “They’re the exact same shade as your eyes. Did you notice?”
“You’re so hot,” Harry says unthinkingly. “You— Is it the spell making me think that or are you actually really hot and I’ve never noticed?”
“Not yet,” he says simply. He’s still kneeling, his glasses smudged and his trousers hanging open, but there’s such quiet authority in his tone that I find myself nodding again, not needing to think it through to know I agree with what he’s saying.
“Can’t help the image of him coming to mind while you’re in the throes of passion? I get it. He’s a popular bloke.”
I dunno what I was expecting, but sucking cock isn’t actually that difficult. Maybe at the advanced level there’s more to it, but I bob my head, trying to keep my teeth out of the way, and Harry’s mouth falls open. He stares at me with an intensity I’ve only seen from him once before—about five minutes ago, when I was about to come down Draco’s throat.
“Ah, fancy dress party, is it? What are you supposed to be, some kind of fancy monk?” The woman chuckled. “Bit early in the day for that kind of thing, innit?”
Harry thrust against him one last time, then rolled sideways onto the bed. Draco made a noise of protest and turned to follow him, but Harry pressed him back against the pillows with a firm hand to his chest.
Malfoy’s mouth is a sinful distraction, trailing down my neck, along my collarbone, over my chest. His teeth drag over my nipple and my hips buck again, into Harry’s waiting hands. Towards his face. He catches the movement and his eyes darken. Shit. Shit.
“Is now really the time? I’m hard as a fucking rock. I’m not going to be able to stand up as it is.”
“There’s one more thing I’d like to do before we get stuck in,” Malfoy said. His pale eyes locked with Harry’s. He had a very intense sort of eye contact. Harry felt a little bit like Malfoy was looking straight through him. “I’d like to quickly test your magic, if you’re amenable.”
“I’ve seen worse,” I say with a shrug, not letting myself stare at it, not letting the wrenching feeling in my chest show on my face. I meet his gaze unflinchingly.
“Dead romantic, yeah,” Ron said, avoiding Harry’s gaze. “It’d really show everyone”—he nodded at the chest—“how serious you are about fulfilling the— I mean, how serious you are about each other.”
“Exactly. And it’s why Narcissa was able to evoke the contract in your name. The magic recognises her as your elder relative. She has authority over you.”
“Er. We had an appointment at ten? The Welcome Witch told me to come straight in. Sorry. Did I get the time wrong?” He was glad he’d found the right room, at least. The white, sterile corridors of St Mungo’s all looked the same.
He hadn’t been able to face going back into Diagon Alley two days before Christmas to get any of the things he’d previously been tempted by, but he hoped Draco would be happy with the gift anyway: two dozen mince pies under a Stasis Charm, fresh this morning from Madam Tamsworth’s kitchen. She had been overjoyed to receive Harry’s owl, and had refused his offer of Galleons, waving him away with a chuckle and an, “Oh, you’ll pay me back one day, I’m sure!” Harry would have preferred it if she had accepted the gold; the number of favours he owed people was starting to make him nervous.
Draco withdrew his hand and Harry whined, his arse following Draco’s fingers. Draco had to grab Harry’s knee as the room spun around him again. He fumbled for his wand in the wreck of bedsheets and cast another Lubrication Spell. A moan of relief was wrenched out of him as he slicked up his aching cock.
Hermione giggled and Ron sputtered out a protest. Harry glanced at Malfoy. His face was carefully blank.
“Your fastest yet. Five hours and twenty-three minutes.” Malfoy touches his neck and winces. “But maybe we left it too long between feeds.”
“It was so good,” Harry says. “And we can always— We can always do more stuff another time. If you want.”
He untied the scroll from the owl’s leg with shaking fingers and found his hand automatically drifting to a pot filled with owl treats. The gesture calmed him; it was evidence that he was real, that his body had routines his mind had forgotten.
Harry was dimly aware of applause, of other people on the dance floor with them, of the first notes of a new, livelier song. His head was still spinning.
“Draco,” Harry said, but his hands were already rising to tuck Draco’s hair behind his ear, to brush the back of his finger against the warm, pink skin of Draco’s cheek. Draco’s eyes slid closed. A throb went through Harry’s entire body. “Draco…”
“We’ll be here when you wake up,” Hermione said. “I know you can do this, Harry. You’ve worked so hard.”
Harry lifted his head at Malfoy’s tone. Malfoy looked small and unhappy. “You think I won’t want you if I get my memories back?”
Draco’s defences crumbled. He swore, opened his eyes, and pointed his wand at Harry. “Tell me again,” he said harshly. “Are you certain?”
“Malfoy.” He didn’t know what to do with his arms. He leant one casually against the door, then dropped it back to his side. “Erm. Are you busy?”
“Some people call it that,” Malfoy said, his nose in the air. “I myself don’t like to consider it a branch of Healing. ‘Healing’ implies a single, discrete cure. As I’m sure you’re aware, the brain is a little more complex than that.”
Even if I had sucked a hundred dicks, I wouldn’t have done anything even remotely like this before. I shake my head.
But Harry didn’t find out what Draco thought, because Harry was kissing Draco desperately, fumbling with the fastening on his own robes. He needed to be closer to Draco, to feel him, to have as much of him as possible before he changed his mind and realised that he didn’t mean it – couldn’t mean it–
And now he was in Harry’s bed, and Harry was twitching his hips towards Draco’s mouth, and Draco swallowed him down without a second thought.
Harry frowned and re-read Malfoy’s letter anew. Was it too convenient that Malfoy had shown up on Harry’s doorstep, asking for help, while Harry was in the middle of one of the biggest cases of his life? Was it too convenient that Malfoy somehow seduced him – maybe even tricked him – into bed? Eyes narrowed, Harry added a postscript of his own and concealed it with the same spell. See what Malfoy made of that.
Harry nodded distractedly, struggling to keep up with this switch from the ruffled, grinning Malfoy back to the uptight professional before him – even if said uptight professional was still pink, his breathing still a little uneven.
Malfoy sighed. “You should know I cherish every instance of you questioning whether or not I can do my job.”
Malfoy met his gaze. He looked as awful as Harry felt. His skin was almost grey. There were dark circles under his eyes, his hair was a mess, and his robes were hanging loosely off his spiky shoulders.
The dinner crowd came and went and the pub settled into mellow evening chatter. Harry had held up surprisingly well, he thought, but for the last hour, he had spent much more time staring than talking. Every now and then, Malfoy would meet his eyes and abruptly fall silent. Each time, warmth would pool in Harry’s stomach – then Malfoy would look away and continue as if nothing had happened, delivering wry observations in a voice slightly huskier than usual.
The glint in Malfoy’s eyes sharpened, and his mouth curled into a smile despite the grip Harry had on him. “Why, Potter,” he said in a silky voice, “are you jealous?”
He gazed at the unfamiliar handwriting. His mouth formed the names of people he didn’t know: Kreacher, Molly, Ron, Staghart, Silverling, Hermione.
There was an unusually awkward pause. After a strained moment, Harry realised he was waiting for Hermione to jump in with a full explanation of Legilimency therapy and the history of its uses within Mind Healing. But Hermione was biting her lip and staring determinedly at the menu, not saying a word.
Draco frowned and opened his mouth, but Harry wasn’t finished; it was important that he clarify his position. He hadn’t intended to say it either, but having Draco know felt too good to take it back.
The first touch felt just as impossible as last time. Malfoy was so tight, and Harry hesitated, not confident that he wouldn’t hurt Malfoy if he carried on. But Malfoy was encouraging him, begging him to sink further in. So Harry did.
“Yes.” Malfoy leaned forwards. “It may be that it’s none of my business, so do feel free to tell me to fuck off. But you’ve been awfully distracted recently. Are you sure everything is okay?”
By the time Harry had de-clenched, the chill had reached his ankles, his feet, his toes—and then it was over.
A sharpness stabbed at Harry’s palm. Harry flinched and instinctively tried to pull away, but Malfoy’s fingers tightened around his, holding him in place.
Malfoy’s long fingers began to twist the silver ring around his thumb. “Not directly,” he said quietly. “But I let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, which led to Dumbledore dying, so in a way, yes. I killed him.”
Maybe he was talking sense—or maybe a Teacher Voice worked on Hermione like nothing else could—but Hermione took a deep breath and nodded shakily.
Harry had never been comfortable around people who cried. But it was as if each one of Malfoy’s tears put out the fire of Harry’s anger, drop by drop. Slowly, the roar in his ears faded. The only sound in the room was Malfoy’s quiet, gulping breaths.
Draco put down his fork and dabbed his mouth with his napkin. “Well. Her approach was effective in one way: I was desperate to master Occlumency so I didn’t have to deal with her barrelling her way into my head. Then when the Dark Lord moved in, I had—certain doubts, I suppose you could say. Obviously, I needed to conceal them from him, but I also needed to allow him access to surface memories so he didn’t realise I was hiding anything. It wasn’t easy. It’s a skill a lot of people never develop. I was a master Occlumens at eighteen.”
“It’s likely it wasn’t even intentional. Perhaps you were under a lot of pressure, doing too much – Merlin knows not a day went by that you weren’t at some event or other – and your mind couldn’t cope with the stress. Perhaps your magic manifested a latent desire for a ‘normal life’. Perhaps you made a stupid wish on a shooting star. None of it would surprise me.”
. Potter was the ill-mannered brat Draco had gone to Hogwarts with. Potter had coasted his way through school, then defeated the Dark Lord through a combination of luck, nerve and some mysterious power that still remained unknown to the rest of the world. Three years after the end of the War, Potter had become a surly Auror who Draco tried not to stare at whenever their paths happened to cross.
Draco was sweating. His feet skidded against Harry’s bedsheets as he tried to find purchase, tried to bend his knees so he could fuck
“Cast the spells,” Harry said. “The ones you did last time. I’m going to fuck you.” He started to strip, undoing the buttons of his robe, his eyes on his wand held loosely in Malfoy’s hand, on Malfoy’s slack-jawed expression. “If you don’t cast them soon I’ll fuck you without them,” he warned, and took off his shirt.
“Some, maybe.” It was remarkable to think, but Draco really did have an idea of what he did to Harry. Nobody could fake what he’d just seen—what he’d just
“I could kill you. It would be so easy. It would be so good. Wouldn’t it be a good way to go, Draco? With my dick in your arse and my teeth in your neck? Would you like that?”
The second touch was a slow, almost motionless press of the head of Harry’s dick against Draco’s rim. Neither of them moved, united in wanting to savour this, this moment of not-quite-yet, the last moment they’d be able to say they hadn’t had sex. They could hardly take it back, not now, but there was still an exhilaration in being on the edge of this, the last barrier they had to cross.
before turning around. Potter was leaning in the doorway, his hands in his pockets, one shoulder against the frame.
Malfoy settled himself onto the bench. “I’m glad I bumped into you, actually,” he said. “I’ve been wanting to talk to you in a more casual setting, you know? Outside of the office.”
I look over my shoulder once I get to the back of the room, but George lost interest as soon as I was out of earshot—and it’s not hard to get out of George’s earshot these days. Maybe he assumes I’m nipping to the loo and will be back for more banter in a few minutes. It’s a reasonable assumption; usually, I’m one of the last to leave the DA reunion pub nights, but there’s no part of me that wants to stay right now. There’s one part of me, specifically, that desperately wants to leave.
,” Malfoy says. Harry is still working Malfoy’s cock. Malfoy raises a hand to grasp Harry’s shoulder and Harry has his mouth on Malfoy’s wrist before Malfoy can draw his next shuddering breath. Malfoy’s pulse quivers against Harry’s lips. Harry whines.
Harry had been too hot before; now he shivered. He wanted to get under the covers, to pull Draco close, but despite everything that had happened, the thought felt like a presumption. Draco had said he was Harry’s present. He’d said he didn’t want Harry to return him. But that didn’t necessarily mean–
“No,” I croak. I clear my throat. “No, you’re definitely not weird. He doesn’t make you feel weird for not wanting to have sex, does he?”
The image warped again, and the messiness of Harry’s bedroom became the clean, dark lines of Draco’s office. Draco had Harry pressed against his desk. This one was a memory, not a fantasy. Their kiss.
“I don’t know,” Harry said weakly, staring. He had never thought of the Leaky Cauldron as grubby until he saw elegant, ivory-skinned Malfoy lean against the worn wood of the bar.
He settles nervously against his pillows, the box in his hand. It’s a wine-dark red – slightly worn from Draco’s frequent fiddling – with a black ribbon tied around it. The look is simple, tasteful – nothing like the garish inventions Draco confiscated in fifth year, or stared forlornly at from across classrooms during sixth. He’d never guess this was part of the same range – and he rather suspects Parkinson didn’t, either. He can’t imagine her buying something from the Weasleys on purpose.
Harry entered the kitchen to find Draco with his back to Harry, chuckling. He was standing at the sink—washing up, Harry realised with a start.
The unexpectedly exciting thought is cut off when he flattens his hand against my chest. “Wait—” he says. “Slow— Fuck, feels so good— But no, stop, stop, god—”
Harry held out his hand and his wand flew from Malfoy’s fingers. Another flick, and Malfoy’s wrists were secure against the headboard again.
“Fuck, Harry, I can hear your cock against his throat. I can hear him choking on you. How does it feel?”
And all the while, Harry was fucking him with his fingers, changing the angle with every inward push, trying to find the spot that would–
A pause. “Whatever you like,” Malfoy said awkwardly. He cleared his throat again. “Anyway. As comprehensive as these notes are, I’d like to do a few preliminary exercises with you today before we begin working with Legilimency. You’re available for sessions any time this week, correct?”
Draco stares, uncomprehending, even as cold horror builds at the base of his spine. Potter was supposed to vanish after exactly thirty minutes. Do they have more time? Maybe Draco misread the three – it could very well have been an eight. He doesn’t know how to feel about the thought of eighty minutes; thirty has been more intense than he could have ever anticipated.
“Fuck,” he gasps. His eyes are watering. My cock is wet and hard, right next to him. Jesus. “God, Ron, you’re fucking huge.”
Ron shifted at Harry’s side. Harry glanced at him. His face was set, his mouth a determinedly neutral line.
It was amazing, the power of being pressed into Harry-scented bedsheets by a warm body and a hot mouth. Any thoughts that Draco had that weren’t related to the weight of Harry on him were swept away by an immediate tidal wave of lust.
“Mmf – I like that,” Malfoy said, pulling off but not moving away. His breath played over the wet, sensitive head. His hand was still wrapped around the base. “Fuck my mouth again.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t remember anything about the War,” he said. “Obviously I know about it – Hermione gave me about twenty books and I read a couple for lack of anything better to do – but it’s not personal for me like it is for them.” Ron and Hermione didn’t look how he imagined leading fighters in a war that had been fought ten years ago should look, either. They were only in their twenties, for one thing.
“Unbelievable,” Malfoy muttered. He laced his long fingers together. “Fine, yes, let’s get to it. I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing. When you’re ready, visualise your mental space.”
Harry obligingly sucked at Draco’s earlobe, nipping gently. “You were saying?” he murmured. “You’re thinking of Ron?”
In one swift move, his cock still buried deep within Malfoy, he flipped them over. Malfoy landed on his back with a surprised huff.
The touch of Malfoy’s mind on his was a familiar cool caress. Harry’s breath caught at the intimacy of it. He’d been wrong; it wasn’t the same as usual. Doing this, opening himself up to Malfoy in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron, the barman wiping down tables not ten feet away – it was almost exhibitionist. He shivered. Malfoy made a small noise of dismay.
It’s a long time before the roaring fades. I’m still pretty much out of it when Draco laughs breathily, a hand over his face, and Harry murmurs praise into his neck as he withdraws. Draco rises onto shaky knees and my cock slips out—I go to help him settle on the bed, but I’m distracted by the sight of it, of my cock covered in come. My come and Harry’s, mixed together. Draco’s, on my stomach. I’m a mess. An impossible, incredible mess.
This thing with Malfoy—Draco—is still new. But it only took a month for him—bright-eyed, flushed—to confess his favourite fantasy: two Harry Potters, tying him up, taking him apart. Harry immediately considered the logistics. He ruled out Polyjuice. A Time-Turner—challenging. Gemino Curse adaptation? Risky.
Draco knows that the fantasy Potter will probably forgive him. He knows it will make his real life so much more painful if so. He knows he’s going to chase it anyway.
“For the other, the colour of the robes you wore to the Victory Ball after we broke up the Pixie Powder ring. The ones with the fancy buttons.” That had been the first night Harry had realised how much Draco came alive under positive attention. His pinched face had opened, blossomed like a flower at the first taste of sun. His sneers had brightened into delighted laughter. His snarky jibes had come out as affectionate teases. Harry’s chest had ached all night.
“Oh. Only we’ve been sitting down for five minutes and you haven’t touched your menu. All you’ve done is stare at me.” He met Draco’s gaze. The familiar eyes sparkled with amusement. “Unless I’m the only thing you want to eat? Because I’m still up for that if you are. Just so you know.”
“It takes a concentrated effort to focus on the specifics of a memory without the use of a Pensieve. But once you have mastered the skill, you will find that every aspect of your recollection will improve. Watch.”
“Hey,” Potter says. “I really am sorry. I should have realised something was up. It’s just – when you said I was a stuck-up dickhead–”
Malfoy met his eyes unflinchingly. “Yes, I had a trial. And I went through the same ethics tests as every other person in a Healing-adjacent field. My scores are in the public domain in St Mungo’s Research Library, if you’d like to see them.”
Harry’s heart warmed. His shoulders dropped. Suddenly, with the approval of his friends, all his doubts vanished. He knew he was doing the right thing. He really was ready.
, which reminded him of graveyards and large cauldrons—but Hermione had talked him through the stages of it, had assured him over and over that it was nothing like that, not at all, Harry, really, it’s quite romantic when you think about it—
A second later their robes were gone, Harry’s wand was clattering onto the bedside table, and Draco had the shock of Harry’s hot, naked skin sliding against him. It was impossible. It was electric. It was the best thing in the whole world.
Harry, by now used to their arguments, knew that anything else he had to say would not be heard. He tuned them out, snagged the bowl that sat forgotten at Ron’s elbow, and tucked in to the rest of Ron’s rhubarb crumble.
“Truthfully,” Malfoy said after a pause, “it wouldn’t take much to make me give in. That’s why you need to stop asking. Like I said, I’m not known for my strength of willpower when I’m being offered something I want.”
“Understandably,” Malfoy said. “And – about…” He faltered. “About the other thing.” At Harry’s blank expression, he continued, pained. “The discussion we had regarding … my feelings towards you in particular as a patient.”
“As you can see,” he said to Harry calmly, “I am not currently available for a drop-in session. Please remove yourself from my office and come back at our scheduled time.”
Harry’s mental space nearly melted away with his shock – he managed to cling to the image just in time, fifth door and all. “What?”
“Don’t be stupid,” Malfoy sneered. “The Three Brothers? That’s nonsense. Something from a storybook.”
of it. Harry Potter is on his knees in front of Draco, naked and hard and sucking Draco’s cock like he was born to do it, like he
“The way you put our history behind you when you took me on was amazing. I remember, those first few sessions—you snapped at me, like we were kids. You only did it a few times, then you pushed it down and never did it again. I couldn’t have done that. There’s no way. You’re so much better than me. So much better than so many people.”
“‘If I think it will help’?” Malfoy repeated. “You do have a wand up your arse today, don’t you. What is it?”
Tonight, Draco’s not drinking. He’s fine with it; it’s an opportunity to gather information on his colleagues. You never know when you might need it. Constant vigilance.
Because where Hogwarts should have been, there stood a crumbling ruin. A sign was chained to the rusted gates:
Harry pushed open the door. As always, Malfoy was alone, behind his desk, writing in his journal. He lifted his head. His eyes widened.
It’s warm. I lick my lips and my tongue meets skin. His breathing speeds up. I watch carefully for his reaction and lick it again, deliberately, taking my time. I allow myself to learn the subtle bitter taste of him, the softness of his foreskin, the feeling of his slit against my tongue.
“Let’s go somewhere,” Harry said, looking Draco in the eye. “Somewhere we can talk properly, for once.”
The potion was somehow both hot and cool, sharp and sweet. Harry lowered the empty bowl and blinked; with the potion out of sight, no longer enthralling him, he felt like he’d been released from a spell. He looked at Malfoy uneasily to see if he felt the same, but Malfoy was standing tall, his chin raised, his gaze forwards.
Harry lifted his free hand to Draco’s sharp jaw, tilting Draco’s head with the smallest pressure of his thumb. God, he smelled so good. Draco’s lips parted easily, and Harry darted his tongue out to taste him. It wasn’t enough. It was too much. Everyone was looking at them. Draco was his
“I’ve never felt anything like that,” Harry murmured. “The Legilimency connection, I mean. Well, the sex, too, but—that was something else.”
Harry hadn’t realised that his shoulders were tense, but the relief was sweet when they loosened. “Missed you too,” he said ruefully. He meant it.
“I’m not putting your dick in my mouth while you’re kneeling up like that. What do you think I am, a flobberworm? I have a spine, you know.”
Draco took the last few inches. He was fully seated, his arse pressed against the tops of Harry’s legs. Harry was inside him. As deep as he could go.
“I can’t believe you’re making me rub my dick against Chudley Cannons boxers,” Draco complained, making no attempt to stop.
By the evening, crumpled parchment covered the drawing room floor, Harry’s fingers were dotted with ink smudges in a way that tugged oddly at his chest, and he was no closer to finding the words he wanted.
“Can’t you see it?!” It was bloody massive, and it had appeared out of nowhere in Harry’s personal mental space that he’d spent hours painstakingly constructing so his clever, mysterious new Mind Healer would be proud of him.
Harry stumbled behind them, dazed. The distant sound of his footsteps echoed the pounding in his head. The white, sterile walls were the same all over St Mungo’s, but suddenly they felt unfamiliar, even though Harry had been here every day for months. Malfoy was two floors up and three corridors across. Harry could almost feel him, a lingering coolness at the back of his mind. He’d be here soon, Harry reminded himself. He’d said he’d come.
He smells the same as ever—like crisp fresh air and the sizzle of a recently cast curse. But as familiar as the scent is, it’s never filled my senses like this before. It’s never clouded my mind and made me dizzy with want.
this fantasy Potter would be hard for him. He whimpers, reaches down immediately to feel the shape of it.
Harry shrugged. Picked at the arm of the chair. “Hermione says being immersed in a familiar wizarding environment is helpful.”
Their mouths are still connected, but their kisses have devolved into mindless, breathless groans. Draco can’t think of anything other than fucking against Potter’s dick. Tension pools at the tops of his thighs. His balls tighten. He’s close again already – But he can’t yet – There’s still time – There’s still–
Harry found himself wildly wishing that Malfoy would use Legilimency on him, right there in the pub, so Malfoy could see exactly what Harry was thinking. It took all of Harry’s energy to keep the door in his head locked and it was getting more and more difficult; he’d only be able to hold it together for so much longer. It was a miracle that Malfoy hadn’t figured it out already.
Draco had thought about what Harry would be like in bed. Harry glowed. “What did you think I’d be like?”
“On the contrary, Healer Malfoy,” Brisley chirped. “So sorry to interrupt, but your presence would help to stabilise Mr Potter through the process. Twenty-seven years is a lot of memories to regain; an anchor would be greatly beneficial if Mr Potter wants one.”
Through the daze of Draco’s clever hand on my cock, I make myself lean around Harry so I can see what’s happening. The flush on Draco’s sharp cheekbones is back, but apart from that he seems collected enough. Whatever he was doing to make himself sound breathless before and whatever he’s about to do now are both still a mystery to me. That is, until he swings one leg over my thighs, shuffles forwards so he’s practically spooning Harry, and sinks down onto my cock.
It was much cooler and much quieter in the foyer—the hush was a welcome reprieve after the volume of the main chamber. Harry pulled Draco over to the wooden bench that stood along the wall. Draco sat without protest. Harry could have let go of Draco’s hand then. He didn’t.
Draco’s head dropped backwards. He was restless, not quite impaling himself on Harry’s fingers but definitely meeting each thrust, his hips rising, his thighs flexing. He was making these restrained little noises, biting off each one before it could become a gasp, letting out another immediately after.
Harry snorted and plucked at the buttons of the—the waistcoaty bit. “If I’d’ve seen them before today, I’d’ve refused to wear them. God knows what Malfoy was thinking. I swear Bill’s robes weren’t nearly this fussy at his wedding.”
“Like you and me, yes.” Draco reaches for Harry’s side and Harry bites his lip against his hum of pleasure.
Draco presses forwards, chasing more of the roughness, the heat, and Potter’s back hits the post of Draco’s bed. Potter breaks the kiss with a sharp inhale. Denied Potter’s mouth, Draco drags his lips over the coarseness of his jaw, bites his ear, licks his neck. His skin tastes like the outside, like brisk mountain air, like salt and wood and musk. Draco can’t get enough, and lavishes hot kisses down Potter’s throat, yanking his robes out of the way, the softness of Potter’s skin driving him wild.
I’m so caught up in Harry, it’s almost a surprise to hear Malfoy say, “I can’t believe how much this is turning me on.”
. Draco’s back arches. He wants to come. He wants to come all over this stupid gorgeous famous face.
“Right, yeah.” God, what did they do to this beer? My heart is beating way faster than normal. “Makes sense.”
“Hardly,” he said. Hermione elbowed him. “But, er. Like Hermione said, it was a long time ago. He might be different now.” It sounded like the addition had taken a lot of effort to force out. Then something seemed to occur to him. “Hang on, are we sure he’s not just going to run straight to the
“You already know. I just told you. What could you possibly hope to gain by being exposed to it first-hand? No.”
Harry remembered the sudden appearance of his first erection in months. He opened his mouth, then remembered exactly what thoughts had prompted said erection. He closed his mouth again.
“I dunno,” Harry said. “I dunno who I’d be with them back.” He could still feel their kiss on his lips, in the echo of Malfoy’s thumbprints on his jaw. It hurt to think that it might be their only one.
is the best thing you could ever see. My hips jerk forwards helplessly. My cock catches on the inside of Harry’s cheek.
Harry waved an impatient hand, but was saved from having to muster up a response by Tom re-emerging from the back room, making a show of peering down at a large, battered book.
It was easy, then, to get lost in the pleasure of it. Of Draco’s easy vocalisations, of his visible reaction to the flattery that Harry couldn’t stop from pouring out. They fell into a rhythm – Draco’s weight on his knees, Harry supporting him with a desperate grip on his ribbons, on his hips, fucking into him with increasingly uncontrolled thrusts. Harry could barely think – the only thing he was sure of was that he wanted more – he wanted Draco to keep making those noises, to keep looking at him with those wild storm-grey eyes, to keep rocking back onto his bound heels, meeting Harry’s every thrust.
“Oh, thank goodness.” There was a murmur, and Hermione’s otter Patronus swam past him and disappeared through the door to the foyer. Harry followed the direction it had come from and found Hermione waiting, tapping her foot. “I was worried you’d changed your mind,” she said. “Parkinson is with Malfoy, she’s been nagging me relentlessly for— Oh, for heaven’s sake.”
Harry had to fight to keep his eyes from fluttering closed as Malfoy poured himself into Harry’s mind. He let the cool bergamot fog roll through him, made all that much sweeter now he had nothing to hide. Sunlight streamed through the window of the circular stone room and his four mental doors hung open; he didn’t even have to steer his thoughts away from Ron, from Ron’s insults or complaints. They had talked it over. Ron knew he’d been a dick. He had written to Malfoy to apologise.
His diagnostics were all perfect, apparently; Harry was, yet again, a medical miracle. The only thing he needed to do now was rest. It was recommended that he stay in St Mungo’s for the next few days, and have Healer Malfoy do another final check-up, just to be sure.
Draco frowned. Out of respect, Harry kept his eyes from trailing down the taut lines of Draco’s body to his dick but, god, it was difficult.
“Take them off,” Harry ordered, already stripping out of his own robes. He pulled off his shirt last, emerging back into the musty air of the room to see Malfoy lying there, rumpled but still fully clothed. Harry surveyed him. “I said take your clothes off, Malfoy.”
It’s unclear which of us he’s talking to, but I feel myself flush anyway. Harry rolls his eyes, gratifyingly unimpressed with Malfoy’s theatrics.
The words were like a hex. The reality of what he was seeing hit, and Harry’s face flamed. Horrified, he wrenched his eyes from Draco and flung himself back out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
“Very good,” Draco heard himself murmur. He watched in fascination as Harry’s arse swallowed his fingers, over and over.  “Fuck. You’re doing so well, Harry.”
“Self-important dickhead,” Potter amends solemnly. “I knew it wasn’t a love potion, and it was just so bloody nice to hear.” He huffs a frustrated sigh. “I should have made sure – shouldn’t have been so spontaneous. I’m really sorry if we did anything you didn’t want to do.”
“Good.” Malfoy drew his wand. “I’m going to cast a quick Diagnostic Charm on you to flag up any Dark Magic that might be lurking, if you consent?”
The fight was hard and fast. Harry lost track of time – he couldn’t say how long they’d been duelling, only that by the time that Malfoy yelled “Stop!”, his breath was coming in harsh pants and his entire being was alight.
“Mmm, and that worked out incredibly well for me, I don’t mind telling you.” Like a snake, Draco slithers out from between us and crawls over me.
But Potter wasn’t looking at the scroll. In fact, as before, he wasn’t paying the slightest bit of attention to the conversation. Instead, his eyes were fixed on the bar, against which a past version of Draco was leaning. Memory-Potter and Draco both watched as memory-Draco spelled the lid off a bottle of Butterbeer and took a swig.
Harry shook his head. “Fine, never mind,” he said. “But in the New Year, I’m going to think up something awful for you to do, and then you’ll be sorry.”
“I’m not scared.” It wasn’t a lie. Malfoy was with him, and Harry trusted him completely. Nothing would go wrong. He was certain.
“Memories. But not ones we’re going to see today. We’ll start with something a little more civilised, shall we?”
So, if you’d asked me before today, I’d’ve said I’m familiar with him from every angle. But it turns out that looking up at him from cock-level is a new one. A very, very good one.
“You want me?” Draco says, numbly defaulting to the words he’s said to Potter thousands of times in his head. “You want my cock?”
“The Healers say there’s evidence that this has been happening for a while. Haven’t you noticed your spells getting weaker?”
The ritual they did on their wedding day joined their magic before restoring it. Which is fine, really. Except—
The waiter brought the bill. They both reached for it but Potter got there first. His eyes widened at the total—honestly, it was supposed to be Draco’s treat, somewhere he knew Potter hadn’t been in the last six months—but he reached for his coin bag without complaint.
The large door that led out to the courtyard hung open, revealing a dark blanket of cloud hanging low, from which poured sheets and sheets of rain. As Harry desperately tried to think of something to say, a rumble of thunder growled overhead.
The iciness hadn’t disappeared, but the pain had transformed into something refreshing—a cool flannel on hot skin, a cold pumpkin juice on a summer’s day. And mixed with it, complementing it—a hot, restless energy that was both the most comforting and the most thrilling thing Harry had ever felt. He knew at once that it was his own magic, and triumph flared through him. He resisted the urge to draw his wand and cast every spell he could think of.
“Contrary to what I’m sure you believe, when you’re not here, I don’t sit around, bored, waiting for you to show up,” Malfoy snapped. “I’m so sorry, Parvati,” he said to the woman.
Draco couldn’t reply, could only keep moving, keep the connection open, keep desperately telegraphing his pleasure, keep willing Harry to come,
Potter breaks off with a groan as Draco bottoms out, his hips meeting Potter’s arse. He can taste blood – he’s bitten his lip, though it’s not whimpers he’s holding back; something much bigger is trying to claw its way out of him, something that has been buried for years, hidden deep where nobody can get to it, where nobody can hurt him–
Malfoy took a shaky breath. “Merlin, I can’t believe – your mental control really has improved tremendously. You didn’t – deviate from the theme once. That’s – That’s good.” The dichotomy of the formal words spilling from his mouth while he looked at Harry with such dark, hot intensity made Harry, impossibly, even harder.
Draco whines helplessly; Potter has said that to him before – in other fantasies, where Draco is on his knees in front of Potter, Potter’s hand on the back of his head, Potter’s cock between his lips. He can’t believe he gets to act it out now. He can’t believe–
“Well,” Potter said, abashed. “I mean, to be fair, I didn’t have much else going on at the time. And you had to learn it by yourself, whereas I had…such a good teacher.”
“And then my memories sorted themselves out again, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since,” Potter finished. He was stacking Galleons in a neat little pile, each one carefully dragon-side-up.
A wave of calm washed away the unease so thoroughly that Harry wondered if he hadn’t imagined it. “Not at all,” Malfoy said. “This is a safe place for you to retreat to if your memories get out of control, like they did yesterday. The doors will allow you to sort through your thoughts and store them separately. What you find behind each door is entirely up to you. We’ll dedicate some sessions to that. All of this is about strengthening the control you have over your mind.”
I lie there for what feels like hours, staring at Harry and Draco’s joined hands, resting, twined, just above my belly button. The clunking tick of the grandfather clock and the soft ebb and flow of their breathing lulls me into a sort of trance, I suppose, because I don’t notice when Draco wakes up.
That one stumped him; Harry couldn’t deny that Malfoy was distracting. Even then, while Malfoy was listing reasons why he didn’t want anything to do with Harry, Harry couldn’t stop staring at him.
“We’re in the circular room,” Harry said dutifully. “There’s a big window facing me. There are doors along the walls.”
“I’m not proud of it.” Malfoy lifted his chin. “But I won’t lie to you. Our shared history does mean that there’s a part of me that finds this arrangement … thrilling.”
I open my mouth—to apologise, to ask if he’s okay—but he silences me with a hand over the bottom half of my face.
And even though Draco is stunned into silence, Potter isn’t quiet. He’s making little appreciative moans, louder each time Draco fucks his mouth, vibrating through Draco’s cock and shooting over his whole body. Fuck.
”s mixed in with the curses, and tries to drown out the sound by reaching between Potter’s legs to grab Potter’s cock.
Flecks of dust sparkled in the summer sun that poured through the office window. Harry clenched his fists. It was frustrating, having to consider the needs of a person he didn’t remember – especially when that person was himself. And if he did get his memory back, if he did regret doing anything with Malfoy – Harry knew that it wouldn’t be him, Harry, who would take the blame. It would be Malfoy. Harry would have to be the most selfish person in the world to push the issue and leave Malfoy to deal with the fallout – if it came to that.
Harry nodded again. “Sure, of course.” It was easy to agree; he had no idea how to snoop around in someone else’s head, no matter how much he might want to.
Malfoy glanced over at Ron and Hermione and raised an eyebrow. “Granger continues to spout wisdom in a subject she has zero training in, I see.”
It’s not long before the two of them drift off, their slow breathing loud in the quiet of the room. But I can’t sleep.
Harry lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening to Malfoy hum a song Harry didn’t recognise. He reluctantly admitted to himself that it made quite a nice change, waking to the sound of life, of absently murmured music, instead of the crushing silence he’d lived with since September; he’d spent too much time alone at the Dursleys’ to relish solitude as an adult. That was part of the reason he loved Hogwarts so much—there was always noise, always activity, always the reminder that he wasn’t alone, wasn’t locked up, wasn’t hidden away in shame.
“Remember what I said. Gently correct yourself when you notice your attention wandering. Don’t force anything. Let the memories flow. Don’t worry what form they take. Do you understand?”
“I want you to stay.” He says it so easily, like it’s the purest, simplest truth. “Please. If you want.”
“What? Is he not–?” Harry scrubbed at his eyes; they were crusted over with dried tears. The room was blurry; unfamiliar at first, but the memory of their arrival slotted into place as he took it in. Ron and Hermione were sitting on his left, both with rumpled robes and dark smudges under their eyes. There was no one else in the room.
“I suppose you just have to find a man who watches white walruses in wet weather and wears an unwashed Swiss wristwatch.”
“There also needs to be a familial connection. This is old magic, Harry, from a time when it was common for the head of families to arrange marriages for the younger members. It seems that when Sirius named you as his heir, he marked you as officially being of Black lineage. That’s why Grimmauld Place—”
“Don’t get your wand in a knot,” Malfoy said lightly. “I’m going to try to open the door and access the memory. It might feel a little invasive. You can tell me to stop if it’s too uncomfortable.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. Malfoy’s reaction was unexpected, but it was also gratifying: Harry really was getting sick of the Leaky Cauldron.
Ron rested the tip of his wand on their joined hands. He spoke an incantation, the words not flowing quite as smoothly from his mouth as they had done from the officiwizard’s, but they were still melodic, song-like. A golden thread of light crept from the tip of his wand and wrapped around Harry and Malfoy’s hands. By the time Ron had finished, the light circled their joined hands three times, criss-crossing from fingertip to wrist.
Malfoy seemed to take Harry’s indecision as a refusal. He opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded sharply. He turned to leave.
Harry stood and started to pace. He’d ruined his relationship for this. He’d thrown away – god, he’d thrown away the Weasleys. Hermione. His family. There was no way they’d understand – there was nothing
By some glorious miracle, the doors remained closed, and Harry made it through two hours without a single errant thought slipping through. It took all his concentration, more than he’d ever had to use before. When Malfoy lifted his wand and waved Harry back towards the Pensieve to collect his memories, his feet dragged on the carpet, his movements clumsy.
“If you could both join me at the front, gentlemen,” the officiwizard said kindly, gesturing to the empty space in front of him.
it had felt. The fact that he wasn’t visualising it well enough for Malfoy to see it in detail was disheartening.
But once again, Harry didn’t hear what Draco thought, because he was kissing him helplessly. Draco made a soft noise in the back of his throat and arched into him, and Harry’s heart felt like it would swell right out of his chest.
When they were like this, Harry didn’t need to say anything. Harry knew he was ready, so Malfoy knew he was ready. The Malfoy in his head reached out and tried to turn the knob of the door. Much to Harry’s satisfaction, the door didn’t budge.
Malfoy’s face crumpled. Less than a heartbeat later, Harry was sure he must have imagined it, because Malfoy was as blank-faced and professional as always. Harry realised suddenly that Malfoy hadn’t looked like that for their last few sessions. The thudding rhythm stuttered again.
“Time to cut the cake,” said a voice, interrupting Harry’s spiralling thoughts. Harry would have recognised the crisp accent anywhere, but he would have known who it was anyway; his recently regained magic lit up at Draco’s proximity.
Harry’s gaze is so intense that if I didn’t know he was shit at Legilimency, I’d think he was trying to read my mind. I stay still, letting him see whatever he needs to.
When Pomona Sprout asked him at the wedding, Harry was unsure of what their living arrangements would be post-honeymoon. But, as it turns out, the contract decided that for them too: they are required to live together in a marital home—that is, a property with both of their names on the deeds. Unable to banish the thought of Sirius’s outraged face from his mind, Harry flatly refused to add Draco to the Grimmauld Place records. In revenge, Draco refused to add Harry’s name to the deeds to the Manor, to his Welsh cottage, or to his Kensington flat—which Harry thought was ridiculously petty, and was not shy about saying so.
Harry tried to pull himself together—it wasn’t as if he’d never been in an interrogation room before. He straightened. “Southend-on-Sea.”
Malfoy stepped closer. He curled his long fingers into the front of Harry’s robes. He was taller than Harry. Harry hadn’t realised.
“Oh,” said Malfoy again, bristling. “Well then. I sympathise with the poor sod who ends up dealing with you.” Harry grinned at Malfoy’s knee-jerk waspishness. “Is that all, then?”
Harry absently rubbed his forehead and cast a regretful glance up to the ceiling, where his study lay waiting. He heaved a sigh, let his head fall back in frustration, then stepped into the fire.
“Do you remember when we first met? When I said I thought your memories weren’t lost? Just locked away?”
The hand-holding was not the worst part. The bottom tier was innocent enough: a tiny Harry was surrounded by tiny Weasleys, and a tiny Draco was flanked by a tiny Lucius and Narcissa. A tiny nougat Hogwarts Express stood between them.
Siphoning the memories back into his mind was another ordeal. By the time he was done, Harry was sweating, weak-kneed and desperately, desperately turned on.
Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced helplessly. Harry groaned – but the thought of Malfoy sitting next to him and laughing along with them was inviting, enticing, and suddenly impossible to resist. “Fine.” He stabbed his pie once more for good measure. “But we all know this is going to be awful.”
that Draco’s trusty mental locks clicked open and memories spilled out. He had thought that his Occlumency skills were the one thing he could rely on. It had been more than disconcerting to learn that wasn’t true.
“Don’t mention it,” he said. He tugged on his trousers and bundled the rest of his clothes under his arm. “I’ll, er. I’ll see you round, I suppose. Let me know if you need anything.”
Apparently dissatisfied with Harry’s lack of attention, Malfoy reached up to where Harry’s hand was still clutching his hair and placed his own hand on top of Harry’s. Then, he pushed down, shoving his head down onto Harry’s dick. He looked up at Harry, mouth full, eyebrow raised, as if to say, “See?”
,” Hermione said. Her bottom lip was already reddening from renewed nervous lip-biting. “But—you might have to be.”
Harry would love to say he has, but his brain is too busy short-circuiting over the way Draco’s thumb is rubbing the inside of his thigh, the way his hand inches higher with every upward stroke. God, what would it feel like if Draco were to wrap those elegant fingers around—
But the interaction nagged at him while they ordered, and while the barman, still beaming, delivered them three steaming steak pies. It was something he’d been wondering about for weeks. A tiny frustration, really. Insignificant in the grand scheme of things. But something that, suddenly, he was unable to keep to himself.
“Good. Now, when you are ready, think back to the first day you can remember. What happened when you woke up?”
“He could have single-handedly Healed every person who has been to St Mungo’s in the last ten years and I still wouldn’t piss on him if he was on fire,” Ron said stubbornly.
He’s still rocking his hips, meeting my every thrust with an appreciative moan, so it takes a second for the words to register. Once they do, I drop my hands and straighten my legs, trying pull out—but he leans backwards, keeping me inside him.
“No, I know,” Harry says, before Draco can work himself up any further. He really doesn’t want another fight, not in the early hours of Saturday morning. Not while Draco is in those damn tailored pyjamas and Harry is
“The last time I saw him,” Harry said, leaning closer, “he showed up on my doorstep while I was in the middle of a very important case and managed to keep me away from work for hours.”
There’s an honest-to-god chandelier taking up the majority of the ceiling. I doubt Malfoy would appreciate the comparison, but the glints of its crystal droplets remind me of the disco balls in the tacky Muggle clubs that Harry and I got fucked up in every other night, those first few years after the war.
He said as much, and Malfoy frowned. “Well, I was a cowardly little shit. I didn’t do much of the raiding and cursing. I mainly just benefited from the” – he pulled a face – “the status of it all.”
“But, you–” Draco remembers the feeling of Potter’s hole spasming around his tongue, the way Potter begged. “What do you – I don’t understand–”
The look on Draco’s face and the sound of his breath catching are more than enough to convince Harry he’s made the right decision.
“Oh – sorry, yeah. Ready.” Harry planted his feet. Was he really about to duel a Death Eater? The thought sent a giddy thrill through him. He raised his wand.
Harry rolled over. Draco was staring at the canopy of his bed, his fingers idly tracing the pink marks that the ribbons had left on his stomach. His flush had abated, leaving behind pale, seemingly unblemished skin. The zigzag of scars had faded, white blending into white.
“Draco.” Harry reached out helplessly, needing to touch him, needing an anchor. The bed felt as if it were on the waves of that wild blue-grey sea off the coast of Shetland. “You never said.”
The fresh torture of the Legilimency sessions continued. The Aurors had a new lead on Harry’s case, which turned out to be another dead end. Harry’s dreams about Malfoy intensified with every passing night. There were exactly two weeks left until the six-month anniversary of Harry’s memory loss. After Harry’s chat with the girl outside the Leaky Cauldron, his desire to regain his memories had doubled.
Harry declined the check-up. Hermione and Ron took him back to Grimmauld Place in a Muggle taxi. Ron tried to pay the driver with a Tesco Clubcard. Harry went to bed.
Harry quashed a stab of disappointment. He didn’t know if he’d ever been there, but it was unlikely.
The tap-tap-tap of an owl’s talon on glass woke him. Harry opened his eyes, squinting at the morning light, and waved a haphazard hand to unlatch the window. In flew a small brown owl that Harry didn’t recognise. It dropped an envelope neatly onto Harry’s stomach and left without waiting for a response.
“Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was quiet compared with his earlier moans, which still rang in Harry’s ears. “Can you… My arms.”
“No, I got there eventually,” Harry said, trying not to squirm under Draco’s lingering gaze. “Not that Kreacher didn’t try to help, the perv. He practically broke down my bedroom door, he was so desperate. He was never this weird before—what have you been teaching him?”
“Open your mouth,” Draco rasps. Potter obeys without hesitation, his lips parting, his tongue out, resting flat over his bottom teeth. Draco rubs the head of his cock against the glistening pinkness. He teases himself – teases both of them, going by Potter’s frustrated little moans – and rubs the head of his prick over Potter’s tongue, not letting himself slide inside that hot mouth. Not yet. Potter’s lips wrap around him, and Draco manages to pull back, letting Potter chase him, letting Potter try and take Draco into his mouth again and again, only for Draco to deny him, even though Draco is shaking, even though he wants it so much he could scream.
“No. I was on duty with the Aurors the day before but nobody knew where I was.” Harry quirked another grin. “Maybe the notes weren’t helpful because you weren’t reading them closely enough. Pretty sure this is all in there.”
“God, what are you doing?” Draco slurs, grabbing at Harry with a clumsy hand. “Lie down. I’m fucking wrecked.”
“Ron told me. He said you’d both find it funny, I hope he wasn’t having me on…?” Molly looked at Draco too. Her smile faltered.
And if Harry’s time limit was approaching, if his mind was beginning to settle without his memories, surely he shouldn’t be throwing up barriers and concealing things from his Mind Healer. Surely he should be able to focus his full attention on strengthening his control and seeking out what he had lost.
A throbbing beat later, they were in Malfoy’s office. Malfoy was sprawled in his chair, his quill in his hand. Harry was on his knees under the desk. Malfoy’s cock – Malfoy’s
.” Harry was unable to stop his hips from giving a short, sharp thrust and was rewarded with a low moan.
The memory of Draco’s nose brushing Harry’s when they kissed during the wedding ceremony flashes through Harry’s mind. It is not helpful.
, but by the dozens of Thirst-Quenching Draughts that Harry had been force-fed by unsmiling Healers. He’s tried to tell him every time since then – whenever Malfoy pushes him, offers himself up, persuades Harry to forgo the potions and chase him over Europe.
The unpleasant pout on Malfoy’s face softened. “Well – thank you.” He blinked, gathered himself and continued sternly, “But if you had listened in our first session you would have known that retrieving semantic memories is much easier than–”
Draco didn’t look up as Harry approached. His eyes were still strangely unfocused, his gaze fixed on some vague spot across the room. Up close, the casual grip on the wineglass was much less casual than Harry had assumed; Draco’s knuckles were again stark white.
His lack of memory was obviously an issue, but apart from that, things weren’t bad. Even if he didn’t remember their history, he still had Ron and Hermione. Both of them had shown him kindness beyond anything he could have imagined – although, in fairness, his scope of reference was limited.
It’s not weird. It should be weird—I’m standing in Draco Malfoy’s posh bedroom, kissing my best friend—but somehow it feels normal, like something we’ve always done. The shape of Harry against me is so familiar, so beloved. I snake an arm around his back and pull him closer, open his mouth, deepen the kiss.
And now Malfoy knew how Harry felt about him and hadn’t been offended. Had, astonishingly, wanted Harry too. Harry didn’t even have to worry what was next for them – not yet. The memory of Malfoy’s forehead resting against Harry’s fluttered through one of the open doors. Harry let it come, and let it drift away again. The last of the tension dropped from his body. For the first time in a long time, Harry felt completely at ease.
Adrenaline surged through Harry in the rush of spell-casting. He hadn’t duelled since his very first meeting with Malfoy, and it was just as good as he remembered. If anything, it was better – this time, he
But what could Harry contribute, really? He didn’t know a thing about weddings. He certainly didn’t know anything about magical contractually obligated weddings. And although he had grudgingly accepted his fate, he still couldn’t summon any enthusiasm for the day itself, no matter how hard he tried.
“Quite.” Malfoy rubbed an absent thumb over his left forearm. “Well, you already know we were in the same year at school. And now you are also aware of my, er–” he held his arm up jerkily– “unfortunate history. Your friend Weasley and I – well, we never quite managed to find the time to talk things over after the War.”
“Do you want to come back to mine?” Harry asked impulsively. “You didn’t finish your drink. I have a bottle of Odgen’s at home.”
After a quick lunch (that an approving Kreacher tiptoed through the piles of paper and ash to serve him), Harry sat down to write replies to the remaining letters.
He wasn’t going to go, obviously. But the confirmation that he’d done what he’d done obliterated the tiny bubble of hope that had formed in his chest. And to see it written down so plainly, black ink on white parchment – well. His newly interested cock was a testament to the mixture of emotions that swirled within him.
Draco felt the first hot lick of Harry’s orgasm before the Legilimency connection stuttered and failed—but it was enough to push him over the edge, his fingernails digging into Harry’s skin as his hands became claws and his body became nothing but a tense, throbbing mass of pleasure, Harry’s moans in his ears and the echo of his thoughts in his mind.
“Well, you did that, didn’t you?” Harry said, nudging him. “People can’t stop talking about how well you did, putting it all together. They’re very impressed, I’d say.”
Harry’s breath caught. Draco did that a lot – said things that were just on the edge of flirtatious. Harry could never tell whether it was just his personality, or whether he knew – whether he was teasing Harry on purpose–
He said as much, and Malfoy nodded slowly. “I see,” he said. “Well, if you change your mind at any point, or if I happen to see a memory that you’re not comfortable with me seeing, just say ‘Jarvey Janglers’ and I’ll end the spell immediately. Understand?”
Harry searched Malfoy’s face, trying to see the truth, trying to see something Malfoy wasn’t telling him that would mean he hadn’t chosen to do those awful things. But his familiar grey eyes were unreadable.
Less than half an hour later, a private room had been cleared for him at St Mungo’s. Ron and Hermione had both Apparated to his side mere minutes after Harry had sent his Patronus. Together they had dragged him home, assembled him an overnight bag, and whirled him back to the hospital.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, but Malfoy was silent, his face shuttered. This wasn’t something he could help with. This was something that only Harry’s lost memories could help with. He looked back to the girl helplessly.
Draco almost laughed—they were at the Leaky Cauldron again. Potter was sitting at a table in the corner of the room, opposite two women Draco knew by sight, but not name—higher-ups in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. On the table between them was a scroll of parchment, held flat by two empty wine glasses and an untouched plate of chips.
“Fuck you.” Harry twined his fingers with Draco’s and felt the weight of Draco’s other hand settle on his waist. “I can’t dance,” he warned.
of him is overwhelming. Harry wants to feel that warmth wrapped around him. He wants to be inside it. He pushes his finger into the tight heat of Malfoy’s arse. His cock does a very human twitch.
“I’m just saying. It’s objectification.” I take a slow drink of my pint, watching Parkinson over the rim of my glass. The nerve of her! As if Hermione would be interested, anyway. I don’t know if she swings that way (but if she doesn’t, I reckon she’d give it a go for academic purposes), but she’s got better sense than to do anything with a former Slytherin.
Draco raised an eyebrow and met Harry’s gaze. He looked so much like his usual self that Harry’s control slipped; his hips thrust upwards, burying him impossibly deeper.
Draco’s hand shook as he aimed his wand. His eyes locked on Harry’s. “All right. On three. One…two…three.
Malfoy looked dubious but jumped on the change of subject. Harry tried to listen while Malfoy explained, but found himself quite unable to concentrate. Malfoy’s long fingers twisted his silver ring around his thumb, over and over and over.
“It’s a memory thing,” Harry clarified, gesturing at his head. “Sorry. I get it if you don’t want to talk about work.”
Nobody could tell him how it had happened. The only thing anyone knew was one day, he had been Harry Potter: an Auror, a Saviour, a busy and prominent member of the wizarding community, and the next, he’d been … this. Harry Potter, who couldn’t remember which cupboard he kept the sugar in, who didn’t recognise friends he’d had for years, who knew next to nothing about himself.
He supposes, all things considered, he should be grateful that staring is all they do. Merlin knows he deserves worse.
Routine was important, Hermione insisted, so most days Harry had lunch or dinner with the two of them. Hermione also insisted it was important that Harry stay as immersed in the wizarding world as possible (“Anything could trigger recall!”), so often they ate at the Leaky Cauldron. Ron privately told Harry he suspected this was nonsense and Hermione just wanted an excuse to avoid cooking.
But, obviously, Harry’s memory didn’t show that part—it showed Harry turning back to Healer Morgan and demanding, “Was that Draco Malfoy?”
Armed with this knowledge, he made his way straight to the kitchen while Potter locked the front door. Politeness be damned—Draco wanted to get the water boiling before Potter caught up. He didn’t want to be tempted by an offer of anything stronger; a few shots of Odgen’s would no doubt help his nerves, but he was making enough of a fool of himself already.
“No,” Malfoy said bluntly. “But it will strengthen your mental power, which in turn will enable you to look deeper within your mind and access that which may be buried there. Are you ready to give it another go?”
“I reckon it’s one of those ‘he’s serious if I agree but he’s joking if I’m offended’ situations, you know?” Harry takes a swig of his beer and wipes the back of his hand across his mouth. A streak of wet glistens just below his wrist.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, soothing, so soothing. “I know it’s a pain, but it will ground you. What can you see?”
. Harry’s thoughts were sloppier now, flashes and fragments projected into Draco through sheer desperation rather than mental prowess.
On the morning of February 14th, Harry woke to an empty house. Malfoy had stayed at his old Kensington flat—another nod to tradition Harry thought was unnecessary, but, as usual, his opinion had not been consulted.
I’m not following the conversation at all, but Malfoy’s arse is my current favourite thing in the whole world, so I’m feeling generous. “Let him have whatever he wants, Harry,” I grit out. “Give him— Oh,
“Yeah,” Draco agreed, nodding. His long hair fell over his shoulders, into his face. “God, you feel –
at his front door. When he woke, he found that the pounding joined him in consciousness – his head throbbed with the echo of alcohol.
I’m surprised to find the regret I half-expected to appear as soon as they were gone doesn’t come. I’m a little nervous, sure—but it’s mainly Malfoy that’s making me falter. He’s so different from anyone I’ve been close to before—so cold and sharp and spiteful. Even though I’ve been seeing him more often recently, he still feels more like a story than a person. A dramatic tale of darkness and redemption, or whatever. I don’t really
“Mmm, hello,” Harry mumbles, a sleepy smile in his voice. His hand, looking for Draco’s fingers, flattens against my stomach.
He’d just have to go to St Mungo’s tomorrow and wing it. He’d get Malfoy to look inside his head and let his thoughts speak for themselves. That is, if Malfoy hadn’t told the St Mungo’s Welcome Witch to turn him away on sight.
The mirror shimmered and vanished, revealing Head Auror Robards and a row of Auror trainees, who didn’t seem to know whether or not they were allowed to laugh.
Parkinson gave him the package the last time he saw her, two days before the start of term. She pressed it into his hands, winked, and said, “So I can pay you a visit while you’re stuck in that dump. Remind me again why you’re going back?”
Draco raises his head, licking his lips. Potter’s eyes are intense – dark and dazed. He’s definitely not ignoring Draco now.
The trail ends at a tavern tucked down an alleyway, dim golden light spilling through murky windows. The tavern door is heavy. Harry pushes it open easily.
“I’ve wanted this for so long,” Harry found himself saying. He thrust up into Draco again, couldn’t help it. “I’ve wanted you – God, Draco, I want you so much.”
“What? Used Legilimency during sex?” With his thumb, Draco tentatively stroked the soft, delicate skin of the underside of Harry’s arm.
“Hm.” Malfoy ran a thumb over his lip. Sunlight glinted off his ring like a glimpse of a silver Snitch. “Perhaps. But at this stage, I’d be hesitant to suggest anything that you had an emotional connection with prior to your memory loss. Is there anywhere else?”
“You know, I’m not technically a Healer,” Malfoy said eventually. “There’s no need to call me that.”
Their mouths met, Malfoy’s fingers digging again into Harry’s shoulders. Harry found himself reaching back to sharply squeeze Malfoy’s arse, and Malfoy made another delicious whimper that shot straight to Harry’s groin. But he wasn’t pliant for long – one more bite to Harry’s lower lip, and Malfoy shoved him to the side. Harry fell back onto the bed.
It didn’t feel like long before the yellow tinges of dawn began to paint the sky. Harry raised bleary eyes to the window and cursed. He’d already been nervous about apologising to Malfoy; the thought of having to do it after the night Harry had just had made his stomach churn like he’d swallowed a live pixie.
I laugh nervously. I never expected Harry to be a jealous sort of bloke—but I suppose when you hang around Malfoy all the time, some of his entitlement is bound to rub off.
“You even taste good,” Harry told him, thoroughly enjoying the physical reaction Draco had to each compliment. He remembered the Pixie Powder Victory Ball, where Draco had bloomed under every word of praise. “You’re amazing. There’s nothing else I’d rather be doing.”
But instead of shuddering dramatically, as Harry had expected, Draco straightened and snapped his fingers.
But that had been a different person, Draco reminded himself. He cleared his throat. “So, anyway. Once everything had settled, after, you know…”
Under normal circumstances, Harry was sure he’d be preoccupied with his mind potentially settling without his memories. Malfoy had told him not to think about it, but it was hard to avoid: the six-month deadline was less than three weeks away; it wasn’t unlikely that Harry had reached the point of no return. Under normal circumstances, he was sure the thought of having to live without his memory forever would be gut-wrenching.
Draco laughs hoarsely, wildly, and kisses him again. Potter’s mouth is perfect, addicting, and Draco loses himself in it, Potter melting into him, his fingers cold on Draco’s jaw. Potter’s nose presses against Draco’s, and Draco is fascinated by the thought of it –
And now, to add to this confusing mélange of identities, there was yet another Harry Potter. Because the man currently sitting on the other side of the too-small table might have
“The way it feels when we touch each other, I mean,” Harry says distantly. A thought occurs to him and he tears his gaze away from Draco’s crotch. “Wait, it feels good to you too, right? When we touch? It’s not just me?”
“I suppose he gets away with it because of his fancy clothes and his pretty face,” I grumble, glaring at Malfoy as I take another drink. He’s scowling and waving an imperious hand to the bottles stacked behind the bar.
“Fuck.” Harry tightened his grip, twisting his wrist at the top of each stroke so the leaking head dragged against his palm. Draco shuddered again and pressed his forehead against Harry’s cheek.
But then, on his twenty-fifth birthday, Harry Apparated from Grimmauld Place to Diagon Alley to meet Ron and Hermione. He landed outside the Leaky Cauldron—or, rather, most of him landed outside the Leaky Cauldron. The rest of him stayed in Islington.
“I haven’t wrapped it yet,” Draco continued. “So you’ll have to come and collect it from my house. Tomorrow?”
“It’s reasonable to have doubts. You’re doing remarkably well, by the way – you’ve held the image stable for several minutes now.”
“I–” Malfoy scraped a hand through his hair. Harry’s eyes followed the movement. “I don’t like to mention the six-month deadline,” Malfoy said, “but switching Mind Healers at this late stage would be inadvisable.”
“But sitting around and thinking about imaginary doorways is the best way to do that?” Harry scoffed. “Surely it would be more helpful to find whoever did this to me and get them to reverse it.”
Despite appearances, Malfoy’s fingers were strong as they dug into the back of Harry’s neck. His mouth was hot and hard and god, Harry wanted this. He wanted it so much. It was almost unthinkable that the possibility hadn’t even occurred to him until thirty seconds ago.
It had been long enough since he’d woken that any Polyjuice would have worn off. This must be what he looked like.
He’s watching me expectantly, as though he’s waiting for me to clarify my position on Malfoy’s prettiness. He’s been getting weirder and weirder ever since they started seeing each other, I swear.
Malfoy smiled, but his eyes were sad. “There are a lot of people who need you more than I do, Harry Potter.”
Harry's mouth is too full to respond, but he hums and looks up at us through his lashes. I groan and cling harder to Malfoy to stop my knees from buckling. He laughs, delighted, and presses closer.
He takes himself in hand, allows himself half a second to let the anticipation of the moment wash through him, then he slaps his cock against Potter’s face. Potter makes a surprised noise, and Draco takes the opportunity to rub the leaking head over Potter’s open mouth. Potter’s tongue darts out to taste him – fuck, it’s so soft and wet and it’s
Malfoy, who, without Harry noticing, slowly but surely installed himself in Grimmauld Place, until one frosty January morning, Harry woke to the sound of running water from the bathroom and realised Malfoy had been living with him for weeks.
Malfoy’s was cool yet … fragrant, somehow. And there was something else … Harry couldn’t put his finger on it.
“Depravity, hedonism, general wrongdoing,” Draco said, ticking them off his fingers. His wedding ring glinted as he moved. “Why, is that a problem?”
“If you don’t want to, that’s fine,” Draco says, and starts to sit back. Harry grabs him by the wrist, despite everything still surprised at how good such simple contact can feel. But maybe it’s the fact that, for once, they’re touching on purpose. They haven’t touched each other with anything other than forced nonchalance since their wedding day.
“As if you could,” Malfoy says lazily, but there’s something hungry in the glint of his eyes, the tilt of his head. “It would be best if we go to mine, I think. You’re still in that awful broom cupboard, aren’t you, Weasley?”
Draco still looked unconvinced. Harry wasn’t entirely sure it was the right thing to do, but he had never been good at wallowing in indecision; he took Draco’s free hand and dragged him towards the exit. Sparks of delight splintered from where they were touching, up his wrist, his forearm…
He shakes from the effort of keeping himself in control. There’s a misty sheen over his senses; he’s barely aware of the cobblestones under his feet, the smattering of stars above him, the rough stone of the wall he braces himself on.
Harry must be dreaming. It was the only explanation. Someone must have slipped him some kind of – Fantasy Potion. Or perhaps he’d been hit with a Hallucination Hex. Because this couldn’t be real. It couldn’t be. He’d wanted Draco for years. This
“Don’t be stupid, I was the one who made assumptions. You told me all along, right from our first meeting. If I had just paid attention–”
Draco looked down at himself. “Do you like them? I thought silver and green would be funny. But they’re colour-changing, so if you’d rather something different…”
Malfoy banished the furniture as soon as Harry was on his feet. Harry drew his wand uncertainly. “Is this to do with the kiss, or the pounding noise?”
Potter grins. “Let me walk with you.” Draco shakes his head, but he knows he’s going to agree. “The trip will clear my head. I’ll Floo from yours.”
“Oh fuck.” Harry’s head fell to the side. “Fuck, that feels so good.” His glasses were smudged. The office was indistinct, the sunlight smeared over the familiar dark furniture like a streak of paint. Malfoy’s thigh pressed between Harry’s and Harry mindlessly thrust against it – once, twice, three times. Heat coiled in his stomach.
. Harry’s breath came in harsh bursts and his neck hurt from craning to stare downwards but god, he couldn’t help himself. He needed this. He couldn’t get enough.
Harry opened his eyes. Draco was watching him carefully. His cock was insistently hard in Harry’s loose grip.
A hot tingling grows at the base of my spine. My hips jerk, chasing it. Malfoy moans—a deep, gorgeous sound, punctuated by every thrust of my cock. And Harry is right there, unzipping his jeans and shoving his hand inside, watching me, watching me fuck my cock into his boyfriend’s mouth, watching me come undone. He bites his lip. I throw my head back. I let myself fall.
Goyle stepped forwards and put the tip of his wand where Ron’s had been. He, too, began to speak, pronouncing each syllable of the incantation slowly and carefully. A silver thread emerged and joined the gold. Once it had wrapped around their joined hands three times, Goyle stepped back, visibly relieved. Harry felt strangely proud of him.
The force of Draco’s attention is pushing Potter backwards, both of them wild but Draco more so, fuelled by the knowledge that this is his only chance to know what Potter feels like, tastes like, sounds like. They’re both breathing heavily, hot gasps becoming a single desperate flow of air between them, and it’s making Draco light-headed. He’s rock hard – has been since the moment Potter batted his hand out of the air – but the ache in his trousers is distant, overwhelmed by the taste of Potter’s mouth, the slide of his tongue, the scrape of his stubble against Draco’s chin.
They watched TV all evening. Or rather, Draco watched TV—Harry mainly concentrated on casually pressing his socked foot alongside Draco’s bare ankle as he pretended to get comfortable, on brushing his fingers against Draco’s shoulder when he stretched, on leaning across Draco’s chest to reach for the remote—in short, on doing anything he could to shift closer (closer,
And if he knew already – which, Harry realised with a sudden cold certainty, he must do; Harry’s mental control had always been awful and Malfoy was a genius – why was Harry putting all this effort into hiding it? Keeping his thoughts locked away while Malfoy was in his head was exhausting. Siphoning an ever-growing collection of fantasies into the Pensieve every morning was exhausting. And pouring them back into his head at the end of the sessions never failed to give him a hard-on so immediate and aching that he had to limp to the St Mungo’s Apparition Point to get home again.
Seven fifty-six. The sun was beginning its descent, bathing the street outside the restaurant in a beautiful golden glow. Draco scowled. He should leave, before he embarrassed himself further. If he had more self-control he would leave. If he could stop indulging himself for a single second. If he could stop living in stupid, ridiculous, unrealistic
Grumbling, he stumbled down the stairs and opened the door. As tired as he was, it took him a few seconds to process who was standing on his doorstep.
Malfoy didn’t reply. He looked at Harry consideringly, his head cocked, one long finger tracing his still-swollen mouth. Harry liked that look, and was contemplating whether it would be breaking his own rules to say so, when Malfoy said, “Let’s duel.”
Malfoy on his knees, looking at him with those blasted eyes, his mouth full. Malfoy kneeling above him, filth falling from his mouth, his fingers stretching Harry open. Malfoy’s hand in Harry’s hair, his hips thrusting mindlessly while Harry teased him with his tongue. Into the Pensieve.
“I’m not immortal,” Harry starts to say, but Malfoy curves his body into Harry’s and pulls him into a kiss. It would be easy to resist the tug of it, but Harry doesn’t want to. He presses himself against Malfoy – warm again, soft again – and lets himself sink into the decadence of Malfoy’s mouth.
It occurred to him, as they stood in the doorway on the precipice of the downpour, that they could conjure an umbrella. They could cast an
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “No! Absolutely not! That’s completely – That is to say…” He trailed off again, looking at Harry helplessly.
“Well,” Draco said, taken aback. “There usually has to be some kind of existing connection between the two. They have to know each other intimately, on a deeply personal level, to be able to instinctively recognise and welcome the mental and magical intrusion.”
As Harry got angrier, Malfoy calmed. “Viewing things like that could set your recovery back months, and you don’t have months.” His gaze was cool, his earlier emotion gone. “You know what it’s like to experience a memory; it’s not like hearing or reading about it, it’s like you’re actually there. I wouldn’t show you even if you were fully recovered.”
“I…” Another shaky breath. “Merlin, I…” His eyes darted over Harry’s face. “Harry. Merlin. I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“All right,” Malfoy said. His voice was hoarse. Harry pretended not to notice. “We’ll start in your mental space. Ready?”
“Fascinating,” Draco said. “I’d love to see where you’re going with this, but unfortunately I can’t pretend I don’t know that’s a report on the centaur territory dispute that you should have filed three weeks ago.” He smirked and wrapped his moss-green scarf around his long, pale neck, pulling his ponytail out of the back with a practised flick of the wrist that Harry had long since memorised. “Incidentally, you can bin it; I did write that up for you, even though I said I wouldn’t, so that’s another one you owe me.” He drew his wand and pointed it at the blackboard that hung on the wall of their office. A number two rubbed itself out and a number three took its place. The board now read:
, Harry wants to say, but he knows better; the antique chest that holds the contract sits on the bottom shelf of the bookcase by the door. Harry wishes he could
“I don’t think I do.” Harry glared at Ron, who gaped at them. “We’ve both heard enough of his dragonshit over the last month. I’m not sticking around to hear more.”
Under that sharp gaze, Harry promptly forgot every name he’d ever known. He paused, contemplating plausible people. “Seamus,” he said eventually. “Seamus Finnegan. And—Susan Bones?”
“And it would be distracting. It could affect your recovery. To do anything further, to keep even entertaining the option – it would be the height of selfishness.”
“Potter.” It was the first time Harry had heard his voice since before he’d regained his memory. The sound of it made his skin tingle.
He whistled to himself as he got ready (Kreacher flatly told him that he sounded like a broken Sneakoscope) and arrived at Malfoy’s door just before ten. He raised a hand to the knob and paused. He remembered that Malfoy had scheduled a meeting with someone else during his slot yesterday, a move that surely couldn’t be anything other than a personal dig. Harry lowered his hand and kicked the door open instead. He was almost disappointed that Malfoy was alone.
“Lovely weather outside,” Harry said. Malfoy glanced over his shoulder at the overcast sky visible through the window. “Plus,” Harry added, “I did what you told me.”
“You know, putting resentful thoughts or doubts into a Pensive doesn’t remove the feelings behind them,” Malfoy said from the desk. “If you don’t trust me, you can’t put that aside. The Legilimency therapy won’t work.”
.” The curse comes from Draco this time, but it’s more of a strangled noise than it is a word, something wrenched from deep inside him. “Fuck,
The thrill of forcing Malfoy’s firm self-control to fray had never faded. Over the years, Malfoy had got better at hiding it, but Harry had got better at reading it. Back at school, Harry would never have noticed Malfoy’s jaw jutting as he bit the inside of his lip, nor the way he hid his hands under the desk to flex his thin fingers and thumbs into wrathful fists. But Harry knew him better now. He knew that the way Malfoy turned to the two-way mirror was a tacit petition for help.
At least, it did me. I doubt Malfoy overthinks things to the same extent. I doubt he’s had a single self-critical thought in his life.
He leant against the brick wall of the Leaky Cauldron, his head tilted back, and let out a slow breath. Malfoy came to stand wordlessly beside him.
There was a dingy cupboard door towards the back of the kitchen. He turned to it wearily; he had been through four floors of drawers and cupboards and hadn’t yet found anything useful. Without hope, he grabbed the handle and yanked it open.
Potter groans and throws his head back and everything else disappears from Draco’s head as suddenly as if Potter had cast
He spent the evening stewing at his kitchen table, resentfully knocking back the Odgen’s that Malfoy wasn’t sharing with him. He stumbled upstairs and stewed some more. The room spun.
Harry, however, his hand loosely gripping Draco Malfoy’s erection, was thinking quite hard indeed. He was remembering every touch, every look, every wicked smirk. The way Draco’s hands had lingered as they smoothed the collar of Harry’s robes.
Malfoy met his eyes. “I think there’s a reason the Aurors haven’t been able to find a culprit,” he said. “I don’t think anybody did this to you, Harry. I think you did it to yourself.”
“How would it be taking advantage? We’re both adults. I’m not vulnerable. I just forgot a few things.”
in Harry’s fist, and a tremor went through his whole body when Harry tightened his grip. Pressed against him as he was, Harry could feel Draco’s every shudder, every twitch, and he couldn’t suppress a noise of amazement. He’d never thought – never even considered that one day he’d be able to–
A throb of panic pulsed through Harry before he realised that Malfoy was referring to the looming deadline.
Draco allows himself five seconds of indulgence. He gives himself over to the sweet, slow pressure of Potter’s hand, lets his eyes flutter closed, lets Potter’s voice ring in his ears. Lets himself believe it’s real.
I’ve always avoided thinking about him like that, even after the kiss. Always tried not to notice that the way I felt about Hermione never felt too different to the way I felt about Harry. But I can’t deny it now, with Harry’s hand on my thigh and his gaze on my mouth: I want him. I want to kiss him. I want to touch him.
Harry winced at the update. “Another one? Can’t my four cancel out some of yours? So I only owe you nineteen?”
He’s behind Malfoy before anyone sees him move. He smells the spike of alarm a millisecond before he sinks his fangs into Malfoy’s throat.
“Is that you, then? Healer Maffloy? Do I have the right time? I wouldn’t want to disturb you if you’re with another patient.”
It was only once he was outside Malfoy’s door that he realised he should have sent an owl first. Or maybe he should have worn his Auror uniform after all – he’d briefly considered it, just to see how Malfoy would react – then, at least, he’d look like he had the authority to turf out anyone else. Not that Harry was possessive, not like that, that’s not what–
Potter is still warm and pliant. His tongue slides against Draco’s. Their breaths mingle. The ache in Draco’s chest grows.
“Shit.” Harry carefully withdrew his finger and held out his hand for his wand. He realised just before the wand slapped into his palm that his hand was still covered in come. Now his wand was too. “Sorry,” he said. “Come here.” He cast a quick cleaning charm – which did nothing to help his wand – and settled himself at the top of the headboard. “Ready? We’ll go slow.” Malfoy nodded.
and Draco’s knees nearly give out. He smears the wetness over Potter’s lips, his chin, his cheeks, and Potter’s eyes fall closed, like he’s
In Malfoy’s office, another day, another time. The room was empty of furniture. Malfoy was rolling up his sleeve, the Dark Mark an ugly scar on his smooth, pale skin.
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth twitched, his eyes glinting above Harry’s grip. “Would it make you feel better to think so?”
He had been unreasonable. Of course he had. He’d been unreasonable to Ron, he’d been unreasonable to Hermione and he’d been unreasonable to Malfoy. He had been utterly convinced that Malfoy was innocent of any wrongdoing, despite what Malfoy himself had said – despite what any of them had said. To find out the details – to find out that it had involved Hermione, who had been a guiding light through the darkness of the last few months – it had felt like a personal betrayal. Even though it had been ten years ago. Even though Ron and Malfoy had both warned him.
Draco grimaced. That wasn’t surprising. That kiss really had been an unforgivable lapse of judgement—the most selfish, stupid thing he’d ever—
“Erm, actually, do you want to join us?” The look of incredulity that overtook Malfoy’s face made Harry laugh. “I’m serious!” he said. “Hermione says it would be beneficial to be with you in a casual setting. It will increase our level of trust, or something.”
