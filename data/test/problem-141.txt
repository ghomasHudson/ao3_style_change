I’m debating the best way to ask if we’ll be confined to the bedroom when the Headmistress reads my mind.
“I promised I wouldn’t.” Draco summons the bottle of Firewhiskey and pours his tumbler half full. After taking a deep swallow, “I’m trying, Potter. To keep the promises I make. To amend for my past. I thought you knew that.”
Well, five of them, but that was between Draco, his scale, and
(See the end of the chapter for
His heart warmed with her praise.
She raises one eyebrow. “As I understand it, they came through Mr Malfoy’s mirror, spelled by Mr Malfoy’s friend. How is it that you have undertaken the responsibility of their safety?”
Harry’s eyes darkened, the line of his jaw tensing, but he said nothing.
But before Draco could form the words, Kreacher returned, bringing with him a full spread to lay on the kitchen table.
Draco swallowed. “Yes, Scorpius.” He looked into Astoria’s questioning eyes. “Soon.”
Convinced that his son’s presence wouldn’t be a burden, he agreed, “Sure, Scorpius. You can go.” Mother would be disappointed not to have the extra time with Scorpius, but Draco resolved to give her some grandson time on Saturday to make up for the last minute change.
Shrugging, “I mean, like I said. I always hated when people cast spells on me.”
“I missed you,” Draco choked, the depth of his emotional response shocking.
, placed in stark contrast Draco’s own inability to share.
So Draco sat, and he read.
With a smirk, “When did you first realize you’re bisexual?”
“Pot-ah?” Draco mimicked, trying to imitate the curious accent she’d used to say Potter.
Malfoy pipes in, “I feel like you’ve skipped over a few steps between hating and dating.”
, Draco’s mind supplied. But he kept his mouth shut on that secret.
Draco cleared his throat, which suddenly felt choked. Misreading the sentiment, Harry leaned into Draco and said, “You’ve raised a really good kid, you know.”
Harry shrugged. “I have nothing to hide. The worst of me has already hit the papers, and, if it hasn’t, I’m not ashamed of who I am or what I’ve done.”
“What did you do to Simon?” I snarl, embracing my inner villain. Turns out, it doesn’t bother me to tap that well when Simon’s life is on the line.
“No,” She admitted. “But I plan to.”
“That’s better,” Draco smirked, stretching his long limbs into an appealing pattern.
Parkinson gets detention and exits the office with Draco barking at her heels, leaving Simon, Harry and me alone with the Headmistress.
“You seemed surprised to see me,” Harry said, arranging the nifflers into a pseudo-toga, staring into the mirrors. “Did you not get my messages?”
“Harry. Harry who?”
The resulting stare from Scorpius was so quick and disconcerting, Draco barely had time to school an expressionless face back at his son. “That sounds exactly like something Emil said, at the end of ‘The Wrong Sider.’”
I’ll give you the short and sweet answers to use.”
,” and finally, Draco sucked Harry’s earlobe into his mouth.
A bottle of beer and shot glass appeared before them. “Cheers,” Harry said, clinking his drink against Draco’s.
Which is why it shocked him to realize something about that cover had changed. He brought the book closer to his eyes, noting the space beneath the title, the spot where an author’s name should go, the place that normally read ‘by Anonymous’, now said something quite different.
“Oh fine. You’re no fun,” Draco muttered. Stifling a grin, he pointed his wand at Harry, as if to comply with Harry’s wishes, and popped the top button off instead.
“It’s hard to remember sometimes.”
He shook his head, smiling, “Salazar, I wish I liked fanny.”
He walks over and peeks through the drapes. “I’m setting a silencing spell. It’ll hold as long as the curtains remain closed. So. Uh. Goodnight.”
Draco shook his head. But who was he kidding? If he were a wizarding house, he’d be charmed by Harry, too.
The Headmistress tents her fingers across her chest. “Mr Malfoy has also had an unfortunate role placed on him. I advise you to judge the man for who he is today, rather than what you might hear whispered in the hallways.”
Draco gave Harry a curious glance, and received a shrug that meant something like ‘I’ll tell you later’ or ‘don’t worry about it.’ They’d only known the new versions of each other for less than a week; Draco wasn’t very worried that he hadn’t quite mastered how to interpret the shrugs Harry used to communicate.
Honestly, it was a wonder Draco’s heart hadn’t stopped yet. “Oh?” He managed to squeak.
Suppressing what would have been an embarrassingly high-pitched squeal, Draco demanded, “Do you regularly leap out of invisibility cloaks to startle your guests, or is this a courtesy you’ve only extended to me?”
, young man! If my pins prick you, I’ll hear no complaints. How are you completely incapable of standing still? My word.”
Treasure stopped by the table again, hands full of bingo cards. He set them on the table and, with a wink, pulled out his wand and slyly muttered an incantation at both of their cups. “There,” He said, a satisfied grin on his face. “That’ll keep you boys tapped up for the duration of the show.” Then, he sashayed away.
The look of confusion on Harry’s face would be adorable in any other situation. “But I thought—Hermoine said you and Astoria were close.”
“No!” Hermione objected, falsely, as if she hadn’t once been so incensed over Ravenclaw’s Alumni Newsletter calling her CL invention “more flash than substance” that she’d gone on a months-long tirade that ended in Ron creating a light curse that spelled Hermione mute for 10 minutes anytime she said ‘Ravenclaw.’ It’d been the quietest month of Draco’s life, not counting his year of house arrest after the war. Then, Hermione threatened to withhold sex from Weasley until he gave her the countercurse. Consequently, the resulting makeup led to the conception of Hugo. Ah, the circle of life.
Rubbing the back of his neck, “I’m trying not to be pushy here. You know I don’t agree.”
The Floo rang, and Astoria’s voice rang through the flat, “Draco! Scorpius!”
magic,” Simon corrects. “I gave mine away.”
“Good grief,” Draco said, picking up the wine and taking a sip to ignore the warmth in his stomach at Harry’s gesture. “I don’t need your meddling sympathy, and if I did, I would have asked for it, you silly sod.”
“Jesus, Draco. Warn me next time,” Harry sputtered, lifting up the bottom of his shirt to use as a napkin for his spilled wine.
Harry laughed, “How could I ever have doubted you?”
“And are those friends the most vehement in pushing you to go public?”
“Except for sex food.”
of him. For once, the sound didn’t fill him with that cold mixture of anger he’d always felt. Draco couldn’t help but silently respond to Emil’s unasked question: Would it always feel this way?
There’s no room for dissent in her request. Not that I have any. Simon may have appeared the more thunderstruck of the two of us, but I’m not immune to Hogwart’s charms (except the name. Grotesque).
For a while, the clanking of forks against plates filled the silence no one dared breach.
“Care of Magickal Creatures is another good option.” She looks at Simon, “I apologize in advance for Hagrid.”
A pinched expression stole Harry’s face. “You finished it?”
“Potion work out for you?” Draco asked.
Draco paused, his mouth half open. Taking another drink of wine, Draco decided to be brave. Even if just to spite his recent Hufflepuff-esque behavior. “Because I don’t have Scorpius.”
It shouldn’t affect him so deeply, the way Harry remained still under Draco’s explorations. Pliant. As if waiting, but for what? Still, the control was heady. Having Harry, here, under Draco’s spell. He drew in a deep breath, then exhaled against the now damp skin of Harry’s neck.
On second thought.
“Don’t pout, Draco,” Hermione commanded, then sighed. “Really, as far as Harry Healing Sessions go, he seems to have gone easy on you. I think those two questions are perfect for your situation. I know you haven’t been challenged in this role for awhile; that’s why I’ve been recommending you for open positions. But, I know I sometimes push people before they’re ready.” She sighed. “I can’t tell you if fear is holding you back, that’s something you have to decide for yourself. But I can tell you that yes, I was terrified of the new role. Have you ever heard of imposter syndrome?”
“Potter!” Draco called from behind him. “Potter, what are you... wait up!” He heaved, his long legs having caught up to Harry but at a significant cost to his inebriated lungs.
They walked this way to the kitchen, before Draco released Scorpius in order to hunt down owl treats. He didn’t need them as much these days; most of his correspondence occurred via CL, except for the Zabini’s and his mother. As he opened cabinet after cabinet, Draco tried to tamp down the anxiety caused by how comfortable he’d become with his son, and the fear that his departure back to a life with Astoria might reset whatever familiarity they’d built over the past week.
“Our turn?” I ask.
Harry nearly falls out of his chair at this admission.
“If you wanted to complain, darling, you should have gone to Lavender,” Pansy drawled.
“Don’t do it!” Baz cackles.
nearly 5 p.m. after all, perhaps it was time to switch to something harder...

Sorry for the lengthy wait time! Post a cliffhanger... get struck by writer's block. Such is the life of a work in progress. It's possible this story may end up being 22 chapters now, but I wanted to post this ASAP given the wait.
“How’s Narcissa?” Hermione inquired.
“But why?” Harry whined, clearly having had this debate many times, never to his preferred conclusion.
“I’m sorry, my lovely,” He said, allowing her to perch on his shoulder while he headed to the kitchen for some owl treats. “But your owner is a real bitch with bad timing.”
Draco nodded. “Come to mine at 8. I’ll have breakfast prepared.” It was a little later than normal, but Draco expected that Harry, as an unemployed layabout, might prefer a bit of a lie-in.
Simon nods.
Stopping at the door to Scorpius’s bedroom (now the guest room), Draco stared at the half-made bed. He imagined his son reading ‘The Wrong Sider’, kicking his legs as he ignored his father on their first day together.
“But he’s committed to his work, and he’s kind. He knows about Scorpius, and you. It’s not his plan to get in the way. He has his own kids, actually. Two daughters, aged three and five. And he’s
The inside of The Pub was dimly lit, much less vibrant than its exterior lights. On the wall hung different flags representing the myriad of gender and sexual identities, along with vulgar neon and aluminum signs. The audience theme was always ‘come as you are’ on Draq Queen Bingo nights, with some people dressed simply for comfort, and some dressed seeking company. Draco knew he and Harry fell somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. He wasn’t looking for any company other than the one at his side, and he hoped Harry felt the same.
“Master Harry,” The elf, Kreacher, Draco guessed, bowed. “Are you and your guest—”
Harry and Draco came to different but equally disturbing conclusions at the same time.
me?!” She slapped his arm. “Draco, you promised to take me to the next drag show you attended.”
“Never asked,” Harry smiles. “Oh! We ought to take you to Honeyduke’s this weekend. They have blood-flavored lollipops they sell just for vampires.”
Draco sighed. “I’ll come. But you’re buying my drinks all night.”
“Of course your beard would be sexy,” Draco complains, before realizing what he’s said.
[HJP]
, Potter?” Draco took another sip while watching Harry make increasingly frantic gestures at his own face. “Merlin, use your words. Whatever is the matter with you?”
“I was wondering,” Harry paused once more, and Draco’s heart threatened to pound a hole through his sternum. “Maybe, you’d like to go with me?”
Then, he saw the mirth in her eyes and relented. He was getting too old for prolonged grudges, anyways.
“Well,” Baz takes a sip of whiskey. “Turns out I didn’t have a good enough imagination.”
Ron peered out the back door. “Looks like Molly’s already started feeding them. She never could resist a gaggle of hungry kids.”
“I never complained about Potter’s arse,” Draco huffed. “And why is it on the free square?”
Also also, is anyone still pretending to care about The Wrong Sider anymore? Don't worry, it'll make a come back in a chapter or two.
“Yes, Hermione. I’m fine,” He lied.
She scoffed. “I wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t.”
“Do you want to go home, or would you like to stay and work?” Hermoine asked, once she’d released him from her embrace.
Mother smoothed down Scorpius’s hair, and picked a few small twigs off his sweater. “I should be leaving, darlings. Give you some more quality time together.”
“I should go shower and change,” He said, standing. Scorpius kept his gaze fixed on the plate, though he hadn’t taken any more bites.
Now, Draco opened his eyes. “Circe, you Gryffindors are so easy to rile up.” He added a saucy smirk to punctuate his taunt.
Harry scooted along the wall so his shoulder brushed Draco’s, the additional warmth almost intolerable to withstand. “About that.”
Panicking that she could smell the bits of hangover the potion didn’t evaporate (namely, the guilt), he realized she meant Scorpius. With his head clear and his vision less foggy, he realized he
better. Still. Can’t help all those years I envied you for it. When I thought I wanted what you had. When I thought you did too.”
With one last apologetic look to my reflection, I head back into the bedroom. Simon follows.
“Hello!” Harry exclaimed.
Treasure gave Draco a look, seeking permission, which Draco granted with a slight head nod. “I knew of Draco by reputation, of course. Who didn’t? Especially as a fellow pure-blood.” If this news surprised Harry, he kept his reaction to himself. “But I didn’t go to Hogwarts. That’s why you don’t recognize me.” Treasure laughed, taking a drag of the cigarette before passing it to Draco. Blowing out a puff of smoke, “Not that I’m deluded enough to think Harry Potter would have even noticed me in school. I was a few years younger, after all.”
At their floor, Lavender and Draco exited the lift. “So did you spend

ego.”
“Huh,” I say, my mind scrambling to land on my actual emotion before my mouth volunteers, “Neat.”
“I did, yeah.” Potter smiled. “Before I do, and don’t roll your eyes at me, Draco, I will tell you eventually, I promise. Before I tell you, I want you to know that only a select few people know this. Mostly, it’s the circle of friends and family I’ve kept around me these past years. Hermione and Ron, of course. The Weasleys, all of them, even Percy. Hagrid, duh. Luna. Andromeda as well—she’s your aunt, right? And Teddy, he’s old enough to understand. Most of the Dumbledore’s Army crew, at least the ones that come to our monthly pub night—”
Simon sighs, “Fine. Well, as Baz mentioned he pretty much hated me on sight. And, based on how he acted, it didn’t take me too long to hate him, too. In fifth year, I was convinced he was a…” He trails off, looks at Baz. “That’s not important. Basically, we hated each other until 8th year. Or, I thought we hated each other.”
“That’s not the part that confuses me, Draco, and you know it,” Harry growled.
Pity would be a welcome reflection in those green eyes. Instead, Draco saw the fear of recognition that painfully reminded him of that day in the Manor; the day when a stinging hex and a small lie changed the course of Draco’s life.
“So we’re not worried about this, right?”
Draco scoffed. “You’ll need my help with more than a statement, Potter. I expect you’ll need press conference prepping, and an entire new wardrobe as well.”
Why did I ever believe Simon could avoid a mystery? He’s been friends with Bunce for far too long to walk away from any problem that may need his help solving.
On the other side of the door, he couldn’t help but turn around and wonder,
“Oh!” Potter finally caught the scent of a potential connection. “Do you want to tell me about the book you’re reading?”
“Come over for dinner tonight.” She posed it like a demand, not a question. The tactic nearly always worked.
The Headmistress raises an eyebrow but doesn’t pry.
“Luna wanted to travel. To experience. We had a long talk about it, and split amicably. I know that’s a lie people often give, but it was real with us. I was the Man of Honor at her wedding.”
Silence grew between them as Draco did not visualize the sexcapades currently underway at the Zabini house.
“Draco,” Harry said, his hand reaching out to Draco’s shoulder. “You’re not forcing me to do anything I don’t already want to do.”
Nodding, Scorpius pulled his father back in for another hug. “As long as you try, that’s all that matters.”
I sigh. “Fine. Let’s get this over with.” I push Simon up against the headboard and wiggle my way into his lap. Pushing his hands into my hair, I command him to, “Untangle.”
Harry leans forward. “Mage?”
“Kreacher hopes tonight’s meal will be satisfactory to the Masters Malfoy. Kreacher was unable to discern Master Scorpius’s favorites on his own, so Kreacher created many options.”
Hermione broke the silence first. “I should have known you were in an existential crisis. You only file when you’re trying to work something out.”
As he swallowed that sentiment, the clock above Astoria’s fireplace chimed 10. Then, the Floo flared, and Narcissa stepped through with his son.
Of course, she was even more supportive about Draco’s desire to get closer to Scorpius.
I lean into Baz’s ear. “So it begins.”
Simon and I stay silent; it seems the safest course. To speak only when spoken to.
He rolled off the bed and stumbled through his morning routine, wasting several fruitless minutes seeking a bottle of Hangover potion, only to realize he’d run out and failed to restock. With a curse, he soothed himself with the fact his meeting with Hermione was later in the morning, well past the point where he could expect to be recovered (though his mind shuddered at the thought of natural healing).
Draco blinked. “Fair point. Maybe it’s worth considering that I already knew you lacked manners, and therefore would be more hurt if you hadn’t taken the time to plot out a way to startle me specifically on our first official friend outing.”
Sending him a glare, “Oh really, Malfoy? How would you like being marked for death? Watching every single parental figure in your life die to protect you? Being called a liar by your government for telling the truth? Watching your secrets spill across the pages of the news? Spending an entire year living in a tent, hunting dark magic while being hunted along with your best friends? Having the weight of the whole Wizarding World on your shoulders? Knowing every day you live is another death on your conscience?” Harry’s chest heaves and Malfoy turns his face so Harry can’t read it. “I died,” Harry’s voice cracks. “I died, and they still haven’t enough of me.”
Harry sat up straight, his hand reaching for his wand, but Draco managed a swift head shake before Harry drew.
Seemingly unconvinced, Harry stood. “Actually, I should go.”
“So, Mr. Potter,” Draco started. “When did you first suspect you were bisexual?”
When Harry caught Malfoy’s eyes next, he marveled at the unfocused grey pools. The man had matched Harry shot for beer and Harry had to have at least two stone of muscle on the other man. Not that the difference spoiled the view.
“Should we go?” Draco distracted himself.

As if manifested into existence by his internal queries, the Whirlwind descended in front of Draco’s desk.
,” Harry replied in a poor imitation of Draco’s accent, his fingers tapping on the glass of his firewhiskey. He turned to Draco and grinned. “You have a, uh.” He scratched absently at his nose.
Scorpius shook his head.
“I know that now,” Draco says, spelling the bottle over to Harry.
Holding out her hand, she said, “It’s a deal?”
days since Simon Snow reminded us that he’s the main character in this drama).
the one who betrayed me. And what in the world are you doing hanging out with Harry Potter in the first place?”
“I see you also needed an escape,” Harry spoke, his unexpected presence jolting Draco from his thoughts.
Harry spells a quick Muffliato and hopes it excludes Draco.
Clasping his hand over his heart, Draco gasped, “Potter, did you use your celebrity for a short cut?” Because without his influence, there was no way he could have acquired a Portkey on such short notice.
“Huh?”
Draco’s mind supplied.
Moonlight falls on Harry’s face, still furrowed and dark. The dream may have slipped but the memory is still there. Because it’s late and Draco’s still drunk he allows himself a slip or two. He rubs his thumb along the crease between Harry’s eyebrows. Traces the length of his set jaw. Finally slips his hands through the thick mess of hair, both softer and silkier than he’d imagined.
“Don’t you dare.”
“Harry—“
“Curious,” Draco repeated, one eyebrow raising.
“Or Astoria,” Blaise added.
A corner of Harry’s mouth twitched. “Good grief? Silly sod?” He laughed. “How do you look 20 but sound 80?”
“Well, pining Baz may not be perfect but he’s still cute,” Simon boops Baz’s nose and Baz scowls.
of drugging you with a love potion. They’ll blame the break-up. They’ll--”
The silence strained between them, and Draco felt a growing sense of dread stemming from his inability to soothe Harry’s nerves. Whether it was the stress of the conversation, a slip in Harry’s attention, or even the accidental catch of a stray spell, the moment broke, and Draco caught the instant Harry’s glamour fell.
business.” She stepped into the fireplace. “Oh, and do try not to picture what my husband and I will do when I return home,” She leered at Harry. “That would be quite the invasion.” Then, the fire rose, and Harry and Draco found themselves alone in the room.
Treasure smiled back, but there was no joy in it. “Yes, I was exactly like now. Came out of the womb like this, really.” He sighed. “I don’t mean to belittle Draco’s experiences, but in some ways it was easier for him. He’s like me, but he doesn’t
Sitting, and gesturing for Harry to do the same, Draco sighed. “Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been so absent in his life; the idea that I could waltz in now and become a father to him after what I’ve done… I don’t know if I have the right.”
At that lovely thought, Scorpius and Rose entered the kitchen, the thrill of a summer’s evening spent outdoors with new friends followed by a Molly Weasley dinner radiating off the two of them (as well as a not underwhelming scent of child sweat, which Draco tried to ignore).
“I told you,” Harry whispered, nipping at Draco’s ear in a balanced mix of teeth and tongue. “Call me Harry.”
“Making the other interns taste-test your food for poison,” Astoria continued.
“All I need in a job is to do good in the world, and avoid getting fired for being a werewolf. Why rock the boat?” She’d said.
“Well, it started shortly after the war—”
Since I’ve never been able to exert control over individual eyebrows like Baz, I raise both. “How often
“Coming out,” Harry said, smiling at Draco’s panic-stricken face.
“What’s the condition?” Harry asked warily.
“Still,” Draco pouted. “Tell me why you need me, and maybe I’ll come.”
There was a brief look on Harry's face, almost like pity, but it evaporated and
Draco narrowed his eyes.
. And liked it.
With a shudder, Harry begged, “
“Er,” He flaps his hands like they can help him find the right term. “Non-magickal?”
In a display of serendipity, Harry chose that moment to Apparate into Draco’s living room.
I sigh. “All right. I’ll confess. I’m not sure our magic works the same as yours.”
Plus, Draco was haunted by that damn book.
He took a large sip of wine for distraction.
A buzzing noise sounded from Harry’s pocket, and he pulled out his CL. Smiling as he read, “Hermione wants to know if Scorpius can come over to The Burrow II tonight when you go to your Friday Snake Up.” He turned his twinkling eyes on Draco. “What in the world is a Friday Snake Up and can I come?”
“Are you sure you’re comfortable with Scorpius flying?” Harry asked.
“Just, you know, close your eyes and think,” Pansy cooed. Draco found his eyes closing as well. “If you had one night with Draco, and you could only have him one time, one way, would you rather take it like me, or give it like Blaise?”
Finally, she arrived. With a to-go cup of coffee in hand.
He sat.
giggled.
“Ah, interhouse unity strikes again,” Draco said, reciting the phrase that had dominated post-war Hogwarts. “I suppose we’ll need a Ravenclaw in the mix as well? What should they contribute?”
All things considered, I’m having a fantastic day.
“Why, Potter,” Draco drawls, setting down his book. “I can’t believe I’m finally getting to benefit from your penchant for rule-breaking.”
“No,” Draco placed his hand on her shoulder. “I’m sorry. I really am touched. Only, sometimes I have to say things I actually mean in sarcastic tones so that my tiny heart doesn’t explode.”
Again, Draco cursed himself for his part in Harry’s pain. He knew his own emotional withdrawal from their earlier conversation hardly made a drop in the bucket of Harry’s most traumatic experiences. Still, the fact Harry needed Draco, had asked for his comfort, had referred to him as
Blinking, Harry asked, “How did I help?”
Later that night, after a horrible, awkward family dinner where Scorpius pretended he couldn’t hear or see his father, Draco sloshed the amber liquid of his Firewhiskey around its glass tumbler. In his haste to get away from his father, Scorpius had left his copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ on the coffee table in the living room. Draco stared at the book. Could a book glare? Could it mock you? Was it capable of judgement?
“Hey, I’m right here,” Harry frowned, snapping out of his self-pity.
Before Draco could respond in kind, a hand gripped his shoulder. “Did you pay for those drinks?” A familiar voice demanded.
Draco raised one eyebrow. “I’m not the one coming out inside the Honeymoon Suite of his schoolboy nemesis.”
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out.
Draco cut him off. “Really, Potter. I rarely see the boy. Astoria has full custody. She’s Scorpius’s real parent.”
At lunchtime, Draco Apparated to the coordinates Harry sent, arriving in the shade of a tree among a stretch of muggle townhomes. Looking up and down the street, Draco tried to determine where exactly he’d found himself, when Harry suddenly appeared beside him, whipping off that damnable invisibility cloak of which he was so fond.
“Is that all? Bisexual? Really, I’d been hoping for something a bit juicer,” Draco lied. “Pony play or something. Secret furries with the dragon-taming Weasley. Maybe Rose and Hugo are actually your kids. Anything but being unable to line up your sexual preferences perfectly against society’s ruler.” Really, Potter being bisexual was the juiciest gossip Draco had ever heard, and he had known Hermione was pregnant with Hugo before she did. Of course, Draco’s interest in the gossip had more to do with a few Hogwarts-era dreams and fantasies of his, but that fact would stay shuttered in Draco’s brain forever, thank you very much.
“Life of a parent?” Hermione inquired, her eyes full of concern.
Instead, Draco turned his back on the now empty room, and shut the door.
“How completely infatuated I was with Baz.”
“Another, please,” Harry called at the bartender.
The elf popped away, and Draco turned to Harry, as if to ask,
“You tackled the filing cabinet!” Hermione exclaimed. “Oh, bless you. You know that’s been bothering me for ages.”
Harry let out a deep exhale. “I spent a lot of those first months back wondering if I made the wrong choice.”
With a wry smile, Harry explained, “You’re going to think I’m pulling your leg, but I honestly didn’t know I was doing it until you asked. Not much of an answer, I know. If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say it’s because Hermione and Ron talk about you so often, and they always call you Draco.” He shrugged. “Guess it caught on.”
Baz mimics locking his mouth and closes his eyes again.
For the next hour, they enjoyed the show, although they watched different events. Harry kept his eyes on the stage, laughing at the ribald comments, cheering the winners on and whistling whenever Treasure accented his assets. Draco, on the other hand, watched Harry. Neither of them called a single Bingo, but Draco couldn’t care less.

again feel the sting of his son’s absence. Not that he was interested in anyone
“I can judge for m’self, thanks,” Draco slurs. Then, for good measure, “Potter.”
“Potter,” Draco leveled an intense stare in his direction. “Think before you ask stupid questions.”
And immediately regretted it. Pansy and Blaise turned to each other with mirrored expressions of glee. “Pottah!” They shouted in unison.
into my motivations for creating ‘Potter Stinks’ badges.”
“Really?” Scorpius sent his gaze straight into Draco’s eyes.
“Don’t start something you don’t intend to finish,” Harry winked.
“So,” He started. “You have news?” Only after he finished his inquiry did he take his first bite. Delivery food aside, he couldn’t erase all his Malfoy breeding.
“He gave me a choice, you know,” Harry added. “About whether or not I came back.”
“I may need your help drafting a statement,” Harry said.
Draco turned to Lavender with a huff. “To think betrayal was to be found in
“Oh!” Harry started. “How did your talk with Hermione go?”
[DLM]
Huffing, “Of course he told me. I have a very trust-worthy face.” Draco dismissed Hermione’s raised eyebrow with a wave of his hand. “If you can’t be supportive of our new and fragile friendship…”
Harry ran his hands through his thick mass of hair, huffing. “And how am I supposed to do that?”
“Fuck,” He moaned. A jolt of his stomach woke him back to reality. “Wait.”
The response came immediately.
She nodded, and continued setting the table.
Draco gets a new office, Harry finally hosts his press conference.
Draco raises one eyebrow.
Pouting, “Correct use of the past tense.”
“Like you two,” Baz adds with a wink.
Harry bit his lip. “Ok, so maybe I also wanted to check up on you. Given that Scorpius went home today.”
“Actually, er,” Harry stuttered, pulling out a dented can of beans from his jacket pocket. “I requisitioned a Portkey for convenience.”
Harry laughed. “Oh, heavens no.”
“What the
Harry shrugged. “It makes sense. I mean, it didn’t at the time. But now it does. Being at Hogwarts during that time… well, you’d know, I guess.”
“Will you watch me?” Harry asked, following Draco to the Floo. “I’d feel better, knowing you were watching.”
“Fine, it’s.” Harry mussed his hair and shrugged his shoulders as if that could stretch the fabric. “It’s fine.” He inhaled. “Well, how do I look?”
Pansy interrupted, “Hold on, let me write that line down for later.”
“Well?” Draco asked, his arms outstretched. “How the fuck did the author know?”
.” A small sheet flew into her hand. She handed it over.
Draco still didn’t believe her, but he answered anyway. “She’s fine. Still married to Father, but still not bringing it up to me. Honestly, if I’d had this arrangement as a child, I’d probably be way better adjusted.” Taking another sip of wine, he thought again of Emil and the vanishing cabinet, trying to suppress the shiver up his spine.

After an interrogation disguised as a conversation, I decide I like this Harry Potter. He seems to trust us, and he’s making sure I get breakfast, which is always an express pass to my heart.
“I know now that I could have leaned on them,” Harry continued. “But at the time it already felt like I’d taken so much of them. Their last year at Hogwarts. Nearly their lives. On the back of all of the other deaths in my name…”
Harry shakes his head. “They don’t even like the smell of it. But they can’t get enough chocolate.”
“Moving on,” Pansy said. “Do you have the statement?”
“It’s from the Manor,” Draco said. “My mother ships it to me.”
“Can I use my fingers?”
Fully sated from their greasy pub meals, Harry and Draco rested in a corner booth behind a Disillusionment charm, watching Scorpius eat his butterbeer ice cream with apparent delight. It was all Draco could do to keep a dopey smile off his face. Until Draco saw a similar expression reflected on Harry’s, and he decided that if it was good enough for the Chosen One, it was good enough for him.
Except, he knew it wasn’t. Not even a little bit.

“Harry,” Harry grinned.
Draco briefly rested his hand on Harry’s, not daring to meet his gaze. “I guess I should know that better than anymore. Having broken so many things.”
Laughing, Draco ran a hand through his hair. “I know exactly what this was.”
Harry glared. “Real friends don’t let recent empty nesters wallow in self-pity.” Harry turned his glare to Draco’s wine, as if it were the one pouring itself into Draco’s mouth.
Now I’m here, spellbound in ropes next to the love of my life, and I can’t stop smiling.
My head is spinning from the new information it gathered when Harry finally leaves the room.
“Hermione, isn’t it time to get Hugo bathed and in bed?” Ron asked.
Potter smirked, and joined Draco on the couch. The proximity was in no way unsettling, and Draco planned to deal with it in a decidedly grown up manner.
He also liked helping people, especially Hermione. There’s another contradiction with his Hogwarts self. She was his boss, sure, but she valued his input, and allowed him to shape the policies she enacted as well as the laws she supported. They were partners, and she always shared credit with Draco for his contributions. Not that he needed the credit, but receiving it reminded him that his work had meaning.
Draco sputtered. “Absolutely not. There’s no way I’m walking voluntarily into the lion’s den.”
Exactly fourteen minutes later, Draco ventured back out of his bedroom, stopping before he rounded the corner to the living room when he heard Potter’s voice switch from normal conversation into confessional tones.
She smiled. “Yes, the latest adjustments you made really helped,” She said, her head resting in the palm of her hand, one of her fingers absentmindedly tracing a scar, as they often did. “I can’t thank you enough for the help.”
“How about I finish this?” Baz strokes the curls on Simon’s head.
Draco closed the book and glared at his audience. Neither Pansy nor Blaise had taken another sip from their glass during his reading. Harry, on the other hand, seemed as if he’d finished a whole bottle of champagne on his own.
actually done bad things (which he had), instead of begging them for a second chance (which he hadn’t deserved, but required anyway).
Green eyes narrowed. “I’m afraid I still don’t understand.”
“I didn’t know I was a mage until I was eleven,” I start.
Draco should tear off the sheets for washing. He should gather up the hand towel, wash down the bathtub, clear out the wastebin, and straighten the knick knacks on his shelves.
Draco winced. S.P.E.W. was Hermione’s first project when she’d been hired in as a staffer in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. While she’d been ultimately successful in helping advance house elf rights, she built a reputation as a troublemaker in the process.
“Well, maybe. We hadn’t seen each other in quite some time before last night.” Again, Draco reached into his heart and pulled out a bleeding thread. “But I hope we’ll be friends. I hope he forgives me. For my mistakes.”
“Oh,” Draco’s face sunk, remembering he didn’t actually have a waffle iron. “I don’t actually have--”
Draco received his first CL message from Potter shortly after he arrived at work.
“Oh,” Treasure looked at Draco. “He’s sweet, too!” Leaning into Harry, “It’s a dump, sugar, but I like it that way.” He patted Harry’s face. “Now, I’ll get some faces sent over, free of charge. And no more buying your own drinks!” He directed the last line at Draco before storming toward the bar.  “Trevor! What have I said about thinking for yourself? Draco Malfoy does not
“‘Our first official friend outing?’” Harry quoted, laughing. “I didn’t realize we were keeping track.”
“Wha?” Draco sputtered. He shook out his shoulders, attempting to put on a stern face. “To what exactly are you referring?”
, another part of him whispered.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Give it a rest, Hermione. I’m fine. It all worked out, didn’t it? Thanks to your plotting, I am now poised to be Harry’s Baby Gay Mentor.” He gave her a predatory grin. “I’m really quite excited about it. Do you think putting, ‘Helped Harry Potter embrace his inner queer’ is an appropriate line item on my resume? You know, the one I’ll use to leave you for the high-stakes ministry position that is my birthright?”
Harry winced, and stood as if to leave.
Both Pansy and Draco stared at Potter, mouths agape.
Sighing, “I don’t think I’m ready to talk about it.”
Harry gave Draco an apologetic look. “Do you mind going on without me? I was hoping to catch Treasure.”
Scorpius nodded into her shoulder, but Mother caught Draco’s eye and mouthed, “You too.”
knowing about his suffering.
Hermione turned serious again. “But, really, Draco. Rethink your definition of failure. Sometimes, the only way to fail is to have never tried in the first place.”
Despite his curiosity, he never asked. He valued his partnership with Hermoine too much.
Draco gave the lovely owl head scritches. A gift for Scorpius’s 10th birthday from his mother, Snowy had always reminded Draco of Harry’s owl at Hogwarts. They were of the same breed, though Snowy wasn’t as pristinely white as Hedwig had been. Still, the similarity conjured a mix of concern for both Scorpius and Harry, creating a storm of anxiety which settled in his stomach, a feeling that promised to linger.
“I think I have to go back to work now,” Draco said, still feeling like his insides had been somehow removed, shaken, and then shoved back in with no consideration to their original order. He stood up, and walked to the door, watching his legs move with amazement that they could do so without his brain’s input.
“Like, as a date.”
My shoulders tense.
on how Simon hides his wings. I won't spoil the content, but just know in no way was this my idea. My brain is not that good.
But Harry ignored the olive branch, though he did help himself to a pitiful slump on Draco’s couch. “I’ve been doing this for years because I hate Flooing so much. I always just redo the wards when I leave. No one’s ever complained before.” His small, etiquette-oblivious world appeared to have been fully rocked.
“What? What’s this look about?” Draco sputtered.
“Too late,” Harry laughed, dragging the hand down his body until it reached his half-hard cock.
Shuddering, “It’s Harry.”
A pause, and then, so quiet Draco almost didn’t hear it, Harry said, “A son needs his father, Draco. A child needs both his parents.”
“Well,” Draco drawled. “I was hoping you’d have figured it out by now, but if you need it spelled out to you in terms even a Gryffindor would understand: the reason your gay friends want you to come out so strongly is because we understand the shame of the closet and we know how much better our lives would have been if we’d had someone like you to look up to.”
Harry beamed, “I’d be glad to.” Looking at Draco, “Should we meet up beforehand?”
I saw your disembodied head by the Shrieking Shack! And Snape had me convinced it was a hallucination.” He shook his head, both amused and annoyed. Two emotions he’d long felt around Harry Potter. Along with maybe one other feeling that started with the letter ‘a.’ “You threw mud at my head, Potter,” He accused.
Scorpius wrapped his arms around his mother, and Astoria embraced him tightly. “I missed you,” She said, giving Draco a warm smile.
“Do you not like icing?” Harry asked.
“A spider?” Idiot boy Potter said to Draco while Draco slowly disintegrated into the cushions. Probably. Draco couldn’t really tell what cushions were at this point.
Harry eyed their drinks; both half full. Uncrossing his arms, he leaned over the table. “Draco, you can talk to me about this.”
Draco and Harry nodded, both ignoring Treasure’s last comment as they settled in for the second half of the show.
“A sacrifice?”
Then, Harry Apparated back home, leaving Draco’s wards, and heart, in utter shambles.
Pansy scoffed. “Rubbish. It doesn’t have to reveal anything. It could just be a whim or a fantasy. No one’s promising anything.”
“Almost done,” Harry responded, spelling the last of the now clean pans into Draco’s cabinets. There was a world where Draco asked why dishes should be cleaned by hand but put away by magic, but this wasn’t one of them. “...And finished!” Harry clapped his hands together. “All right, Scorpius. Are you ready to see Hogsmeade?”
Draco scoffed. “I wish. More like the life of a bloody death eater.”
“Too soon,” He pouts, wrapping his arms around himself.
“Me either,” Harry reached across the table, grasping Draco’s arm and squeezing. “I’m proud of you.”
Harry grinned. “So I did.”
“Hush, you,” She smiled over her mug. “But it also helped knowing I’d have you by my side. I couldn’t have done it without you; you understand that, right?”
Turning the corner to Guillaume’s back room, he heard the old man’s crisp tones before he saw him.
around Simon and me.
“Potter?” Harry smirked.
Furrowing his eyebrows in confusion, Draco waved his wand from the kitchen, allowing her entry.
Harry winked, and pushed back from the counter. Holding out an elbow, “You coming?”
“Hey!” Harry objected.
His whole body tenses. “Worried about what?”
“Should we Apparate to the train?” Draco prompted, watching Harry shrug into his leather jacket.
“No,” Harry admonished, guiding Draco’s hand along his firm length. “Harry.”
Looking down, Harry laughed. “What? Since when are dancing nifflers
“No!” Draco shouted, a bit too loud for the indoors. “No, I’d like to keep my, uh, big boy moves where they are.”
Hope you all enjoy!
And then, he realized this wasn’t about Draco and Scorpius.
With the gentle press of a forefinger, Draco drew back Scorpius’s gaze by his chin. “I’m not good at this,” Draco admitted, staring into his son’s eyes, a perfect mix of his gray and Astoria’s bright blue. “It’s no excuse, but I will try to be better.”
Draco wondered.
She clapped her hands together. “Right. Now, about that Werewolf Rights Act.”
Scorpius’s eyes dropped. So did Draco’s heart. But he could continue being brave. For himself. For Scorpius.
Harry nodded, and pulled out a wrinkled piece of parchment from his back pocket. Pansy sighed, and did her best to smooth the paper out, muttering about professionalism or the lack thereof under her breath.
Turning back to the rest of the room, “Simon gave me the message, and we formed a truce. Together, we helped figure out who killed my mother, and, along the way, fell for one another.” He leans back and pulls Simon’s arms across his chest. “It was my fifth year fantasies come true.”
Slightly tipsy, but mostly focused, the two men worked together to craft Draco-approved answers to Pansy-suggested questions (she’d sent them over to Draco shortly after setting up the press conference).
Draco paused, not knowing how to respond. Harry continued, “You don’t have to share anything with me that’d make you uncomfortable. But I can’t help but be curious.”
“The…” Draco flicked back and forth between them, not seeing any recognition. He turned to Harry, his normally expressive face a wall of stone.
“I’m yours, if you want me,” Harry whispered, his thumbs gently rubbing the inside of Draco’s wrists.
“But it’s good, though, isn’t it?” Draco asked, hiding a smirk.
Harry followed him out of the kitchen, completely oblivious to Draco’s internal turmoil. “You never picked a restaurant for tomorrow,” Harry said, when they reached the fireplace. At Draco’s blank expression, Harry prompted, “Dinner? To help me with my statement?”
“What a Gryffindor-esque statement,” Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco smirked, and Scorpius gaped, and then the three of them entered Number 12 Grimmauld Place to Kreacher’s overwhelming welcome.
“It’s Potter, isn’t it?” She asked.
“Good morning,” Scorpius said, his eyes fixed on the plate of breakfast opposite Draco.
Harry shrugged. “Given everything that happened during the war, should it surprise you that strength of spirit would be something I prized?”
Harry scoffs. “This
There’d been a time, just after the war, when it seemed all anyone ever did was talk about the Saviour. In fact, it appeared only the downfall of Draco’s family could steal the spotlight from Potter. Until the public breakup with Ginevra Weasley. Then, the months of embarrassing drunken antics that almost lost the Chosen One his crown. And now, almost nothing.
work for The Prophet.”
The Headmistress sweeps out of her office and along the hallways with the confidence of a woman in charge. Again, I’m getting strong Mitali Bunce vibes from her, and I have a fleeting wish to see the two magickal powerhouses interact.
Draco took pity on his son trying to stay strong for appearances sake. “I know you’re not tired, son, but I am. It’s been a long week, and we have a full day ahead of us.”
“Oh my ancestors. Master Draco has arrived with Master Scorpius. Kreacher has been dreaming of this day for ten years.”
“Of course, I should probably leave, then. Let you both have some quality father-son time,” Harry said.
Harry tilted his head, examining Draco. “Are you… Draco. Are you
They found a decent spot for the show, close enough to see the stage but far enough to avoid being in the spotlight. It may also have been strategically within the pathway the night’s talent had to take to reach the stage.
But all Harry wants is a small, normal life and someone to share it with.
Shaking his head, Draco couldn’t imagine ever being in the headspace to consider Harry’s hypothetical. At Scorpius’s reappearance, he pushed all thoughts of what could be and what has been, and played gobstones with his son and Harry Potter.
This is maybe my favorite chapter so far. Hope you enjoyed!
He scoffed. “Of course I do, that’s the Slytherin way.”
face spelled trouble for everyone in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
. Does he know she tried to turn me over to Voldemort?”
Don’t even get me started on Draco. Of course, I may be a bit biased (body bind incident and all), but while the dining hall audience watches Harry with reverence, they glare at Draco with malice.
Did I write this whole fic just to let Simon drink Butterbeer?
“What?”
Suddenly, he realized where he sat. What he’d been wondering. The opportunity he’d unexpectedly been given.
“I still hated you,” Baz argues.
“I think I remember reading about that in the Prophet.” What Draco really remembered was how, even blurry with some sort of Photograph-Me-Not charm, Harry looked handsome.
“I’ll not stand for this level of character assassination,” Draco pouted.
“Really,” Blaise drawled, ignoring his wife’s rude comment and Harry’s flushed face. “You’re about to witness quite the entertainment. Draco-rants are rare, and beautiful.”
Harry turned his focus onto Draco. “What are your plans for tomorrow?”
Draco’s heart sank and he drained his wine. Of course. Any man in Astoria’s life would need to build a relationship with Scorpius. Logically, he knew this. Supported it, even. Only, he flashed back to his previous night’s revelation. As happy as he was for his friend, it stung that Astoria would now have precisely what Draco discovered his life was missing.
No, not spoiled at all.
Draco moaned with joy. “Lavender Brown, I promise to never call your voice shrill again.”
Then, another realization dawned.
Even though Draco knew Harry’d meant to come out anyway, the gesture made his heart tighten. “This is your choice; I’d hate to feel like we’re pressuring you.”
With satisfaction, Harry noted the level of shell shock on Draco’s face superseded the way he’d looked after Blaise ran away, arm-in-arm, with Harry’s bride.
Simon and Baz’s conversation has moved past orgasms, thank Godric.
“Did it sound like I was doubting your parental connection, Draco?” Harry teased.
“Thankfully not,” Harry said, his expression wistful and sad. It made Draco want to give him a Hufflehug, and it also made Draco want to throw himself off a broomstick from the height of a Quidditch goal post.
,” Harry says.
Smirking, “The glare really sells it.” He cleared his throat. “What’s your type?”
With a smirk, “You always did know me so well.”
“Really?” Draco tried not to gape, but wasn’t successful. Maybe Luna wasn’t done shocking him, after all. “It’s hard to picture, really.”
“Potter,” Draco spoke, his tone clipped. Guarded.
“I happened to look in the mirror, eventually,” Harry confessed. “Not all of us pull it off so well.”
“Could you transfigure my shirt a little bigger?” Harry asked, pulling at the shoulders. He was quite brawny for a recluse; Draco couldn’t help but admire his strong shoulders and defined arm muscles, perfectly exhibited in Draco’s shirt.
“Apparently Blaise helped draw off some of the Carrow’s attention,” Harry continued, mostly to fill the silence. Maybe hoping that, in repeating Ginny’s words, he’d find some measure of truth in them. “He helped Neville stage some rebellion. Ginny joined. They got cozy.”
,” She whispered. “The boy is for me. We’ve been seeing each other for a few months and I’m bringing him to the pub night and,” She tugged at the sleeve of her blazer, “And I want your opinion.”
Pansy nodded. “I think that’ll do it, if The Prophet gets an exclusive as well.” She shifted into work mode. “Ok, I’ll need the statement ASAP to kill the Hogsmeade story. We’ll need to schedule a press conference before I leave—Draco, I assume you’ll work with Potter on wardrobe?”
“Oh dear, my transfiguration skills have gotten a little rusty since my Hogwarts days. I don’t think I can,” Draco drawled.
He closes his eyes again and re-opens them with dark intent.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. “Could be risky.”
Delighting in Mike’s involuntary wince at Draco’s grip, he answered the handshake with a tart, “Pleasure.” To Harry, “Are you ready to leave?” It was well past midnight, and Draco had his meeting about career options with Hermione the next day.
Again, Harry looked embarrassed by the inquiry, raising his eyes to the ceiling in response.
Draco’s stomach twisted. It was too much to handle. He spared a brief glance back at the pub, regretting he’d left the comfort of Lavender’s side. Regretting he’d come at all.
He doesn’t know how much he doesn’t know.
I tune back into her tour.
He gaped at her lack of loyalty, “
“Topic change?” Hermoine offered.
“That’s inconvenient,” Harry mutters, then the two of them turn bright red.
Then, the oldest, ugliest house elf Draco had ever seen popped into the kitchen.
I steel myself for her spell. “Sure.”
Draco sat up, straddling Harry’s waist. “Do it.”
“Ah, is that what you’ve been doing for the last decade or so?” Draco teased. “Pausing?”
“Well, you’re bloody good at it,” Harry muttered, dropping his shirt. Oblivious to Draco’s ogling.
Draco raises one eyebrow but complies. Simon and I look at each other, shrugging in sync.
Pansy faced Harry first. “You can absolutely bet that Blaise and I will recreate this scene tonight to a much more satisfying conclusion than the two of
“Oh, well, carry on then,” Hermione said, gathering up her documentlings as normal. “Draco, come see me when Miss Brown has finished delivering the verbal smackdown you so richly deserve.”
“You never actually told me what the job is.”
“My mother killed herself rather than end up like me,” Baz confesses.
A lock of hair falls from the blond’s styling. When he moves to smooth it back, the other man frowns deeper, and Baz and I laugh. The blond catches our reaction and sneers.
about my time with Voldemort, Weasley.” Draco started to feel desperate with all of the defending he’d been doing lately. Explaining Draco’s poor choices felt just as tiring as it had thirteen years ago. More tiring, even, given he was now failing to convince people he
“Are you sure?” Harry asked.
Draco stood. “Come to my bedroom.”
[HJP]
“Well, I spent most of my teenage years trying not to die, so figuring out I liked boys as much as girls wasn’t high on the priority list,” Harry snapped, bringing his hands back to muss up his hair. With a sigh, he seemed to calm himself, his shoulders and tone relaxing. “Why? When did you figure yours out?”
. All right. I’m going to tell you something.” He sighed. “Only Ron, Hermione, Luna, and my mind healer know this.”
“You’re patronizing me,” Simon complains, but he kisses the back of Baz’s head. Then, he tucks his chin over Baz’s shoulder. “Well. There you have it.”
I keep waiting for Simon to shift into Chosen One mode, but he doesn’t seem concerned in the slightest that we’re magic-knows-where with magic-knows-who and magic-knows-how we’re going to get home.
Harry gave Draco his patented Potter ‘Fuck Off’ face. “That’s none of your business.”
, Harry. And, no, he’s not the reason I’ve been away. I’m simply getting too old to stay out past 10 p.m. on a school night.” Draco rolled his eyes at Treasure’s responding pout. “But, he is the reason we came out tonight. As you see,” Draco leaned forward and spoke in a false whisper, “Harry has recently come out as bi, and needed an evening in gay London.” He leaned back. “Naturally, I thought of The Pub.”
“Use to?” He smirks. “And, oh, just about anytime you weren’t facing me.”
“Probably not,” Harry answered, his lips barely removed from the lip of his beer.
“Now,” Hermoine turned her intense gaze on Draco, shifting suddenly from lovestruck wife to on-a-mission Gryffindor. “You have Scorpius this week, right?”
“No,” Draco pouted, returning to his mission of apparently getting-the-fuck-out-of-dodge before Harry had a chance to unwrap the layers of defense Draco’d built in the three seconds after waking up.
As Harry shuddered and shook against Draco’s body, a surge of protectiveness gripped Draco’s heart. Given Harry’s enlightened attitude, it had been easy to forget the sheer amount of trauma this man had suffered. He’d done the best he could, worked hard to heal, but it didn’t protect him completely. Nothing could.
“And Draco?” I ask, eager to get a read on the man.
Potter glared, but continued. “Well, the thing is, I’m bisexual.”
Draco’s heart would restart any minute now. Any minute.
. Not in your sharp manner, more dad jokes than bite. But I like it. I like
Draco dropped his head to the table with another loud groan. Wrapping his arms around his head, he mumbled, “I just wanted to complain about the book.
“Anyways,” Harry continued, letting Draco off the hook for
With an unimpressed eye roll, Lavender piped in, “Actually, I need Mrs. Granger-Weasley to stay.”
Draco nodded, “From my marriage to Astoria Greengrass.”
“It would be cruel to keep two young men such as yourselves locked in a room for an entire week. However, given your magickal situation, it is unlikely you will enjoy all of our classes. That being said, there are a number of classes in which I think you may find enjoyable participation. Come with me.”
Giving Draco that irresistible crooked smile again, Harry called out, “Kreacher!”
“I’ll wait until you’re done to leave,” Astoria promised.
“Oh, hello, Draco, how are you?” Harry said, draping a gauzy pink number over his shoulder.
“Ooh, I love a good Malfoy-rant,” Ron said, rubbing his hands together. “What’s on the agenda today?”
Of course, Harry Apparated into Draco’s flat just as he’d burnt his third pancake.
Finally, Draco found a quiet corner, and spun them back into his flat. They landed in his living room; Harry immediately broke from Draco’s hold and doubled over, panting, near sobs.
Ron choked on his Pad Kee Mao. “Wut?”
Draco wanted to object, but Harry raised his hand, and Draco nodded, urging him on. This was, after all, Harry’s secret to tell. Even if he was being a giant self-sacrificing wanker about it.
” Draco exclaimed.
Harry nodded, like he understood perfectly. Scorpius flicked his gaze from Harry to Draco, trying to understand.
Raising his sleep-ready face, Harry asked, “You think so?”
Hagrid, thestrals, and rock cakes.
With a wandless Accio, Harry drew his wand and cast the spell. They shuddered in unison.
Draco couldn’t help the smile that took over his face, and he didn’t even stop to consider how Harry knew about their discussion (in fact, given the look of satisfaction on Harry’s face, Draco suspected Potter might have known about the job before Draco had). “Honestly? It couldn’t have gone better. I walked into that meeting completely unsure what I wanted, and Hermione offered me the job of my dreams.”
“But,” Harry sputtered. “The Prophet?”
“Here,” She said, rummaging through her purse until she pulled out a familiar green bottle.
The final confrontation.
“I’m flattered,” Treasure said, giving Draco a curious stare, but if he doubted Draco’s story, he played along regardless. Turning to Harry, “Well, Harry. Welcome to the club, both literally and figuratively. What do you think of my place?” He opened his arms in a gesture that invited Draco and Harry to take in the sights before answering.
At this, Draco couldn’t help but interrupt. “You know those deaths weren’t yours. Nor was Hermione and Ron’s choice to help you. They aren’t your burdens to carry.” Salazar, Draco wished he could lighten the load that had settled on Harry’s shoulders at this conversation. When he asked for secrets, he didn’t expect for Harry to bare the soul behind his mask of self-assurement.
“So, the Mage invited me to study at his school. Watford.” I shift in my seat, debating about how much of the story I need to get to the point. To ask what I want to ask. “He told me I was prophesied. That I was destined to save the World of Mages from the biggest threat they’d ever faced. Someone who was literally eating magic.” I fuss my curls a bit and let out a short laugh. “Turns out it was me. Accidentally, of course.”
Draco shifted in his chair. “A little, but continue.” He didn’t risk a glance at Harry, choosing to take drag from the cigarette instead.
, He thought, dipping the fried goodness into sweet and sour sauce.
Scorpius’s eyes widened.
“I’m not tired!” Scorpius claimed, rubbing his left eye with his left fist.
Harry nodded, like this was something he knew. “He’s cute.”
After their embarrassingly Hufflepuff hug (Hugglepuff? Hufflehug?), there was no way Draco could get out of his scheduled trip to the Granger-Weasley’s. In fact, Hermione sent him home an hour early to collect Scorpius and a bottle of Malfoy Manor-approved wine, which his mother still delivered regularly enough for Draco to share with others.
his heart strings. “Draco,” Harry’s voice trembled. “Why did you leave?”
“No,” Draco commanded. “We are not doing your Gryffindor pity-party routine. You do not get to ask me about last night. We’re on Draco-time right now. You can pick apart my psyche later. First,” Crossing his arms over his chest, “I want to complain about the book.”
To which, Draco had leveled a devastating stare. “Who do you think manufactured his week-long stay?”
“You can go.”
“You brought it,” Hermione laughed, slapping his shoulder lightly.
“Will the kids be joining us for dinner?” Draco inquired.
“What’s going on?” She asked “You’re never late, and you’re never this angry, and you’re. Merlin, Draco, are you wearing two different shoes?”
while you were exiling yourself from his life? For a crime you had yet to commit?”
Harry smiled, and leaned forward. “All right, Draco. I’m going to tell you something very personal about me, and I’m going to trust that you’ll keep it a secret. Can you do that?”
In that vein, he removed his hands from hers to reach for the last eggroll.
“Well, I didn’t actually grow up with parents at all, so,” Harry deadpanned, tearing off the head of one of the dino nuggets with his teeth.
“Fine,” Draco conceded. “I’ll allow you the pretense that you can smell emotions
“Uh huh,” Baz deadpans.
Grey eyes turned toward the park where Scorpius was still swinging, still climbing the air, trying to fly.
“Done,” She beamed. “See you at lunch? Cafeteria all right?”
“Draco,” Hermione’s best mothering voice chastised him mockingly as she entered the office, scooting around Lavender. “You know the rules: no threatening Ministry Employees in my presence.”
to find out exactly why said vampire sucked and ran.”
,” Lavender exclaimed, hugging him tightly, the tray of coffees levitating behind her.
Footsteps sounded down the corridor. “Don’t mind me,” Blaise remarked, grabbing a full flute on his way in and taking a seat on the kitchen counter. “Just here to watch.” He summoned a plate of pancakes, ate one off the stack. Waved for the show to continue.
“No, Potter.
“I didn’t even know you were gay,” Harry said, trying and failing to fix his eyes anywhere but on the blond.
Harry smiled. “As I pointed out earlier, you’re hardly elderly, but I get your point. There were several months where I spent too many nights out, remembering too few of them in the morning.” He paused. “Of course, you already know about that. You would have read it in The Prophet.”
To further prove Draco’s point, the Floo flared, and Ronald Weasley tumbled out. “Hermione? Can you come help? I’ve got dinner.”
“I hated the idea of it at first, but now I don’t know what to think of it,” Draco confessed. “Have you read it?”
Harry startled, falling off the block and into another pile of fabric at his feet. He scrambled to cover himself up with the loose sheets of material, then tried to play it off like he’d
Because one misstep rang loudly through all of the bullshit Harry conjured to separate himself from the mess he’d landed in. That, through all of Harry’s denials and deflection, he’d never once taken the time to learn the name (or gender) of Draco’s betrothed.
“Follow my lead, and pretend you’re besotted.”
At the time he got ‘promoted’ to Granger’s assistant, he’d only been at the ministry for a year, doing temp work as part of his probation. Then, some jerk with a grudge against both Granger and Draco saw the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. Make the up-and-coming nuisance who hadn’t earned her place have to work with a death eater, all while forcing the Malfoy heir to work as a glorified secretary for one of the Golden Trio. A recipe for disaster, at least on paper.
“...Elsewhere.” He kisses Baz’s cheek. “And she told me to give Baz a message. That she’d been murdered, and to seek revenge.”
Five seconds from a full panic spiral, the office door opened.
Only, they’d subverted all expectations. Draco by swiftly apologizing and seeking to make amends through hard work and results, Granger by giving him a clean slate to move forward and treating him as a partner rather than an employee. They quickly learned their skill sets were complimentary: Granger charged a path forward with a mission all her own, Draco worked on the sidelines convincing people it was in their own best interest to support her.
Ten minutes later, Draco had outfitted Harry in a plum button up, dark wash jeans, and black dragonhide boots.
“You’re late,” Draco pouted before he could stop himself.
“Never,” Draco waved his hand in the air. “As I said, always a pleasure.” To the chagrin of his fifteen-year-old self, he meant it.
“So,” Draco twirled his wine glass. “Do you still have threesomes?”
“Oh Harry,” Draco drawled. “Two inches makes a world of difference.” To which Harry flushed beautifully, as expected.
Crowley. And I thought
“I’m going to teach you your place,” Draco licked down Harry’s neck.
Draco dropped his arms and fixed Harry with a stare worthy of his fifth year self. “Did I say you could talk, Potter?” He spat the name with as much venom he could muster.
Draco leaned over and patted Harry’s leg. “You really are,” He said in a soothing voice, to which Harry growled. “Now, tell me what was more important than my wards.”
If it hadn’t already.
“Sins of the father, Potter. I’d know that story better than anyone. Trust me, Scorpius is better off without me.” Draco ran a hand through his hair, singing the tune he’d hummed for years despite not being sure if he still believed it. “I gave him clothes. I gave him books. I gave him Astoria. I even gave him the plausible deniability of my influence. He’s been well provided for. What more could he want?”
I’d be a good father? Because, what, I’m a good secretary for Granger-Weasley? Because I have a werewolf friend? Because I don’t call Luna Lovegood, ‘Looney’ anymore?”
“Except you just casually dropped your orphan status into a complaint session where I’m upset I’m not more interested in all the jobs I keep getting offered,” Draco said. “If I kept on, I’d be the most insensitive person in the world. And, well, I’ve been that, and I’d prefer not to regress today.”
“So. What to do with you, two?” She leans back in her chair, waiting. “I do not suppose you would want to attend class with Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy?”
“You never answered my question from earlier,” Harry interrupted Draco’s thoughts.
Salazar, how would Draco survive these continued confessions? He had to admit that juicy gossip almost tempted him. Almost. “Hmm,” Draco hummed, relishing the spark of hope rising in Harry’s eyes. “Tempting, but still no.”
Harry glared. “No, Draco. I do not still have threesomes.” He sighed. “Without Luna, it lost its appeal. After we split, I learned quickly that anonymous sex just doesn’t do it for me.”
The grin on his host’s face evaporated any lingering anxiety.
“Draco, you poor dear, you look
knows Harry Potter
When the whimper turns into a pained moan, Draco releases himself from the stranglehold of his blankets with a sigh. He sits up and turns toward the source of the noise. It’s Harry Potter, bane of his existence, having a nightmare on the floor.
Draco sat on the bed, his wedding robes hanging open off his shoulders, his body caving into itself.
Finally, the ink dried, the dust settled, and Harry toasted their teamwork with two bottles of craft beer from a new wizarding brewery.
Baz blushes. “Well, perhaps I was plotting a little demise.”
Plus, unlike our world, their magic seems limitless. Is their magic not something that can run out? Circe, what would the Mage say? (Scratch that; I really don’t care).
“No one,” He responded, incriminatingly quick.
“Oh?” Scorpius said, joining his father in the walk to the kitchen. “Well, I think Mother might approve of your using that word if it’s in reference to Aunt Pansy.”
Just, not tonight.
Harry’s eyes widen. He wouldn’t be the first to pity me, but it stings a bit. Coming from him. “I didn’t know who my parents were,” I explain.
His son rolled his eyes, but did as his father commanded.
He followed her in, choosing to stand so they’d remain at the same height. “Were you afraid of failing when you took the Deputy Minister position?”
Scorpius, to his credit, only looked up from the dessert once, took in the two grown men staring at him, said, “You’re weird,” then went back to eating his ice cream.
“What?” He asks when we catch him with his secret stone stash. “They’re handy for transfiguration.”
I kiss his curled lip for nostalgia’s sake.
Luckily, they don’t put up any more fight. Harry watches them crawl into his sheets then spells the curtains closed.
Baz holds my hand tightly, as if I’ll float away.
“Anyway,” Simon sends Baz a fond look then continues. “We were cast by The Crucible together.” At Malfoy and Harry’s confused faces, he explains, “It’s a spell from our magical boarding school to sort first years into roommates.” He smirks down at Baz. “We hated each other instantly.”
“Your guy’s new, he didn’t know the rules,” Draco drawled, leaning back to smile. “Please don’t fire him. He’s very cute.”
The morning edition of The Prophet landed with an inauspicious thwump on the duvet of the hotel bed. Draco paused in his getaway, inching forward until he could see the printed words.
“You don’t know that,” Draco raised his voice, bringing in a good finger point for emphasis. “You don’t know
Anyways I'll just be in a corner crying over Natasha calling Baz 'little puff' until I can't breathe.
Hermione started making apologetic phrases with her mouth, but unapologetic expressions with her eyebrows, and Draco was beginning to suspect the two of them, Potter and Malfoy, had been
“Draco!” Lavender exclaimed. “You’re basically friends with half of the regular attendees.
“Truce,” Draco accepts.
After ushering Scorpius into the Floo, Draco looked back at Hermione, Ron, and Rose. They waved goodbye, with Hermione looking rather pleased for having embraced her inner Slytherin for the day.
With a wandless spell, Harry opened the balcony doors.
“Dinner’s ready!” Ron called from the kitchen, rescuing Harry from his apparent discomfort.
“Worth a shot,” Harry replied.
The man in question made a soft whimper that Draco refused to let tug at his heart strings. Refused!
Draco stood from the couch, stretching his hands overhead in an effort to get his blood circulating again. He turned to see if Harry needed a hand getting up, but Harry seemed to be looking anywhere but at Draco. Shrugging, Draco headed toward the kitchen, Harry trailing behind shortly after.
Eyeing the stack of yes’s with the kind of reservation only a Gryffindor could muster when faced with fine clothing, Harry sighed. “All right, Draco. Make me pretty.”
“But I have nothing to wear.”
Harry spells their cups clean and sets the pint glasses aside from now. Malfoy transfigures the shot glasses into tumblers. Pouring a few fingers of Firewhiskey for each of them, Harry considers Baz’s prompt.
“I smile at Hermione all the time! And Lavender,” He defended. “And
you doing?” She asked once the lift doors closed.
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “How come?”
Looking back at Harry and Draco, I raise an eyebrow and ask, “What do you want to know?”
Draco was not internally screaming at Harry to just answer the question already.
“As protection?” Draco smirked.
Draco’s leg wouldn’t stop shaking as he waited for Hermoine to arrive. He’d accidentally shown up 10 minutes early to work, nervous as he was for Hermione to see the two additions to her calendar. It was possible she’d already seen them. Ok, it was 100 percent certain she’d already seen them—the woman could hardly breathe without checking her CL first.
spirits. Harry spelled back his glamour, and the two of them headed to the Leaky to grab a post-shopping pick-me-up. Well-earned after two hours of trying on clothes.
His fingers wind in my hair instantly, gently pulling apart the wind-knotted strands.
She smiled fondly, “Yes, you do. It’s adorable, really.”
“Who is that?” Astoria asked.
Confused, “It does?”
“I’m sorry, Harry. But I think it’s best if I go home now.”
“Well,” Hermione smirked. “You’re just really huggable, you know.”
Harry growled with desire and pounced. He’d never so much as kissed a man before, though he’d imagined it many times. Still, nothing could prepare him for the intensity of feeling Draco’s hardened cock pressed against his; the silk of Draco’s robes catching on the scratch of Harry’s muggle wool suit. The friction of their contrasting fabrics sending an already arousing situation into ecstasy.
“Ok, fine. It’s possible that a
After gaping like a fish, Draco argued, “You can’t, Harry. They’ll eat you alive. They’ll accuse you of breaking every witch’s heart. They’ll accuse
Harry smirks. “You say that now. Can you transfigure four pint and shot glasses?”
, Draco thinks, realizing the Saviour of the Wizarding World gave up the comfort of sleeping on a mattress to a dragon-boy, a vampire, and a former deatheater.
“Oh,” Draco said. And it was only because his brain and his mouth had temporarily separated that Draco asked, “Would it be all right to have it here, with Scorpius?”
Because for all Draco screamed about the lessons his father had taught him, the biggest emotion he felt when reflecting on Lucius Malfoy was absence. An absence of approval, of love, of time.
“Whatever you want,” Harry said, though Draco still didn’t understand why he needed such assurance. Why Harry thought Draco needed such assurance. Harry captured Draco’s wrists, pulling them out of his hair and down by his sides. Draco leaned back, just enough for green eyes to finally capture grey.
“It’s just, you.
Draco armed a distraction. “Why? What’s your type?”
Huffing, “By at least two inches.”
“Here,” Draco said, pulling out a chair, pushing down his emotions to where they couldn’t overwhelm him. “Have some breakfast. There’s plenty left over.”
Until they reached the doors.
“‘Muggle-born/Pure-blood Outreach’?” Hermione read once  half the board filled.
Simon and Baz share a smile like they’re in on a secret joke.
question is a trap. Instead, I’ll point out two things that struck me from the way you phrased your question. One, you said ‘perfectly content.’ Is perfectly content enough for you in your job? If so, then you have your answer. If not, then maybe you should explore what kind of fulfillment you want in a job before trying to figure out which job you should have. Otherwise, it’s a bit like putting the cart before the horse, right?
Though he hadn’t quite come to a conclusion on what type of job would make him happy, he turned his attention to Potter’s other question. The question of whether or not Draco feared failure.
What was it about a job that made Draco happy? Merlin, that was no small question.
[DLM]
She laughed and ruffled his hair, “Good job, Scorpius.”
A few minutes before their scheduled meeting time, he arrived at their favorite Thai restaurant, a muggle place around the corner from the Ministry. Seated comfortably in a booth with a view to the front door, he watched Hermoine’s hurried arrival. The egg piece was gone from her hair (Draco’d removed it before she’d met with the Minister), but Hermione had newly acquired ink marks all over her hands and forearms.
Draco closed his eyes and laid the book back down on the table. He covered it briefly with his hand, then slid the novel across the table. He opened his eyes and dared to look where he couldn’t before.
Harry smiled at his feet. “Maybe?” Looking at Draco, “I didn’t want Scorpius to miss a minute at Hogsmeade when he didn’t have to.”
“Indeed,” Harry swallowed. “Ready to start drafting my coming out statement?”
Draco nodded.
The Headmistress nods. “I can cast a few diagnostics, if you do not mind.”
“Kinky sex stuff?” Potter guessed, to Pansy’s delight and Draco’s dismay.
“You ok?” I mouth, patting Simon down all over.
“It looks like the feeling is mutual,” Draco said, his heart in his throat.
“Tell me why you’re calling me Draco and not Malfoy,” Draco commanded.
Harry raised an eyebrow in question.
His eyebrows lift. “Someone had to.”
Harry paused. “Yes, and no.”
Draco frowned. “You didn’t redo my wards yesterday morning.”
Draco groaned.
“Hermione, I’m ready to make a decision—” He started, before looking up to realize Hermione wasn’t alone.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think I’ll ever understand Slytherins.”
“Sorry, sorry, but I have good news! Come in,” She waved him into her office.
She blushed. “Sorry! I got so excited. It’s Director of Legislative Affairs, Deputy Minister’s Office. Kingsley’s position will be the same, but for the Minister’s Office. Whoever they pick, I’d expect the two of you will work closely together.”
is this my life?”
magic to enjoy it.
Draco huffed. He knew Harry was right, but he didn’t want to admit he’d been cooking the muggle way in order to impress Harry. Now that he’d failed, he certainly wasn’t going to admit his misguided attempt at showing off.
Draco sighed. “You really like Mr. Potter, don’t you?”
Clearing his throat, Harry asked, “So what’s the story with you and Treasure?”
, and they use it to punk their friends?
Ignoring the accelerating heartbeat in his chest, Draco sputtered, “Well, thank you, Potter. We very much appreciate the consideration.”
. I didn’t mean for it to happen.” She paused. “He’s a muggle.”
She laughed and leapt out of his reach before he could reclaim his property. “Oh, Potter, don’t you know? We Slytherins have the kinds of kinks Gryffindors wouldn’t
Draco hugged him back, drawing his hands up and down Harry’s spine, almost as if to replicate the sensation Draco’d just experienced. They held each other like this, not quite flush, but pressed tightly enough for Draco to appreciate the sheer warmth of Harry. The hard press of his chest. The strong grip of his arms.
“Technically, it was Drag Queen Bingo.”
“No,” Harry answered, the blush spreading for some reason, despite the fact Draco asked this question earlier.
“Draco,” Harry said softly. “What do you want to do?”
,” Draco admitted. “It is pretty funny, I guess.”
visit often, Scorpius?”
They ignored him. “You have to admit, Ron. The author does go on about the main character’s appearance a bit too much,” Hermione said. For some reason, this observation made Ron look queasy.
, Harry thought, taking a sip of beer, his throat dry.
to fall into a mass of textiles. He had yet to remove the glamour that transformed his face and hair into someone unrecognizable, which added to the surreal nature of their encounter.
Harry frowned. “Isn’t there a way to do this with magic?”
Maybe Draco was wrong, though he shuddered to admit it. Maybe it wasn’t being selfish to want time with his son. Perhaps the most selfish thing he could do was not take the opportunity to teach his son the lessons Draco had learned in blood and pain.
With that in mind, Draco Malfoy invited Harry Potter to lunch. An invitation that Harry Potter accepted.
me,” Draco objected with mock-offense.
“...We’re entering hour fifteen of waiting outside the Acropolis Wedding Resort in Athens, Greece, where Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy Estate, and Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, were both dumped by their partners-to-be on their respective wedding days.
Leaning in, Draco whispered, “You realize, of course, that he’s going to sell this story to the Prophet the instant we leave this bar.”
“Oh I’m sorry,” Lavender snarked. “Did
“Perhaps,” The Headmistress considers. “Whatever that spell was meant to do, the one that resulted in your being immune to magic, I think your body reacted defensively. Mostly likely subconsciously. When I examined you earlier I saw a rather complex set of wards.” At my confused look, she explains, “Magickal protection spells. Of course, like Mr Grimm-Pitch’s magic, they do not work in our world.”
Astoria leaned over and brought the card into the center of the table so they could both see it. “See,” She pointed to several squares. “When you complained about any of these items, we’d get a square.”
“Malfoy knew, though. Didn’t he?”
jealous!” He rubbed Draco’s arm gently. “Poor Hufflepuff baby.”
“Good morning!” She called out, cheery as ever, grabbing her coffee from Draco’s desk. “So,” Her eyes twinkled. “Are you ready to put together that list of legislative priorities?”
In an answer to a prayer Draco didn’t remember speaking, Scorpius joined his father at the table, taking the spare seat. Scorpius speared his scrambled eggs hesitantly, then paused.
“Are you looking?”
He reviewed the options: hair, glasses, scar, eyes... arse? “I don’t get it.”
Draco’s heart stopped as it’s door flew open.
“Exactly!” Draco exclaimed, as he stopped writing to review his list. “We could eliminate so much fear and anxiety by just having more conversations. More information. More trust and transparency.” He turned to Hermione, for a brief moment wanting to defend the novelty of this train of thought coming from Draco Malfoy’s mouth, but Hermione gave him a brief smirk, before waving him on.
As we walk to their dining hall, I’m overwhelmed by how magic shapes their entire life. In a world like this, I don’t have to
“And more,” I joke, remembering Blue’s words at the Hoover Dam. I give his hand a brief squeeze and release it.
“What the fuck is wrong with you, Snow?” Baz whisper-snarls.
Draco shook his head.
Malfoy’s face turns red, from anger most likely.
Harry pondered this for a moment, fixing those big green eyes on Draco’s for longer than was comfortable. “Honestly, I’m not sure which answer would upset you more: that I lack manners to welcome a guest properly, or that I hadn’t tailored a greeting plan just for you.”
“She’s the reason I came to terms with my sexuality, too. She’s the first person I told. One night, after a particularly vivid dream, I confessed. She was wonderful about it. Too wonderful, maybe,” Harry laughed. “She took me out to gay bars, and, um.” Harry blushed. “We’d take home men together. She made me see it as something beautiful, not shameful.”
“And why would I do that? Not one ounce of me is Gryffindor. I doubt I’d make it over the threshold.”
He shrugs. “A miracle?”
They started their meal in a relatively drama-free environment. Harry did not bring up his sexuality. Draco did not bring the fact that learning about Harry’s sexuality had passed up his failure as a father and his hatred of books that sympathize with death eaters as the number one thing threatening to unravel his fragile mental state. Hermione and Ron did not bring up… whatever happily married couples with two adorable children think is the equivalent to announcing your sexuality to the entirety of wizarding Great Britain or the fact that you’re probably going to wank over your childhood nemesis in a few hours while your son who hates you sleeps next door.
“I’ll take it,” He said.
Portraits, Slytherins, nargles, butter, gifs, and oh-Merlin-not-another-Chosen-One!
“Oh. Er, I didn’t want to leave without Baz or Simon.”
Without stopping to say goodbye to Mike, or Treasure, for that matter, Draco exited The Pub. But he couldn’t help himself from glancing back inside as he turned to Apparate, the grip of his stomach tightening as Draco saw Mike lean into Harry, their laughter frozen in Draco’s mind as The Pub spun out of his vision.
Then, with a silencing charm in place, Draco allowed regret he hadn’t earned fall off his shoulders in giant, heaving sobs.
Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, confusion on their faces. “What about your father in the parlor?”
“Oh,” She smiles. “I doubt anyone is ever too old to learn.”
Despite knowing they’d been manipulated once again, Harry and Draco allowed the misdirection, though Draco filled up both of their glasses of wine with the remaining portion of the Malfoy Manor selection, leaving Hermione without another drop.
Harry gave Draco another one of his unguarded laughs, and Scorpius looked up at the exchange, as if trying to understand it.
The chapter where Draco learns even Hermione and Ron have read The Wrong Sider.
“Well, you’re right that I’m not going to tell you about my project, I can’t go back in time to force the entirety of Wizarding Great Britain to head to Greece, and I’ve had enough mind healing to know I’d prefer to manage my own orphan-related trauma and not have people walk on eggshells around me because of it.” Harry picked a bowl of pudding for his dessert. “I guess that leaves us with only one problem to solve: why doesn’t Draco Malfoy want to be king anymore?”
The speed at which Draco retreated from Lavender’s desk almost certainly masked the flush spreading up Draco’s neck.
Drawing the pad of his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip, Draco watched the plump skin pale then redden as he applied and released pressure. Harry dropped his head against the brick, and Draco moved to straddle him fully.
Harry leaned over the table, “He’s a
Scorpius bolted to her, and she wrapped her arms tightly around him.
“Just getting you prepared for the ogling you're about to receive. Now,” Draco extended an elbow. “Are you ready to go?”
He swallowed. “How did they know about my father in the parlor?”
Loud enough so the bartender could hear him, “All things considered, Draco, I really think you ought to call me Harry.”
less vengeful than he had hoped.
But, then again, when had Draco ever backed down from a fight where Harry Potter was involved?
Laughing despite himself, Draco draped an arm around Scorpius’s shoulders, nearly stopping himself when he caught the casual embrace. He looked down at Scorpius, who seemed unperturbed by the act.
Draco pulls down his sheets and tells himself,
vampires. But the tint of your skin and the way you move... that’s the same.”
I flip around but the blond’s exactly where I’ve left him.
“Oh, that’s because it’s Draco’s,” Harry replied, innocently, not catching the slight tension his admission introduced to Mike’s jaw. But Draco certainly saw it.
“Draco,” Harry smiled. “This is—”
Draco dropped his half-consumed egg roll. “Story! That’s wonderful.” He leaned in. “Tell me
Harry’s eyes closed, “Don’t stop.”
Maybe the wine had been drugged with Felix Felicius?
Draco’s eyes caught Scorpius’s, the weight of what he’d decided hanging at the back of his mind. Before he could say anything, the young boy launched into his father’s arms, much in the same way Astoria had moments ago. Overwhelmed by this impulsive act of affection, Draco raised his hand to the back of his son's head, gently stroking the soft, blonde hair.
Which was not something that should make him grin this wide, especially with Pansy in the room. Especially since this was Pansy and she knew Draco, and fuck. The look on
“How do you wank then?” He asks, and, you know, bless his sweet stupid face.
The words echoed in Draco’s head as he walked home.
“Could you,” Harry gasped. “Would you hold me, please?”
She groaned. “How do you still not see your own worth? I may have clever ideas, but sometimes my persuasion is quite…” She looked at Draco’s face, and smirked. “Well it’s shit, ok. I know it, you know it. No sense in hiding it. Just look at S.P.E.W.”
actually been thinking about Emil, he might have also pointed out to himself that Emil is a
“The dreams?”
“Shut it,” Draco said, all of the venom of his earlier frustration gone. Lost, probably, somewhere inside the pancake mix. “I tried to do too many things at once, and stopped watching the batter bubbles.”
Gripping Draco’s shoulders, Harry turned him to face the row of townhomes. It took Draco a second, but he finally noticed that there was a new house where one hadn’t been before.
Instead, he said, “No worries, Hermoine. I’ll assume you’re done talking about the book, now?”
“Why don’t we—“ Astoria said to Narcissa, and the two of them exchanged looks before leaving the room.
Finally, Scorpius noticed his father. “Wait,
The server arrived just then, looking quite stricken.
Wednesday started off better than Tuesday. Draco woke up with his alarm, made breakfast, and almost finished The Prophet when the sound of little feet entering the kitchen caught his attention.
Ron kissed Hermoine sweetly on the cheek, “Hello gorgeous.” Her husband was the only person Draco knew who dared compliment the Deputy Minister on her looks.
Harry continued, “Plus she never took on my burdens, not like Ron and Hermione would. Sometimes, they took my pain too personally. Like it was Ron’s fault for letting me date Ginny, or Hermione’s fault for not helping find the Horcruxes sooner. But Luna? She just held my hand, told me she was sorry for my pain, and helped me move on.
It hurt Draco’s soul to nod in assent, the pain deepening at the look of pity on the faces of his two closest friends. Pity that didn’t quickly disappear under a layer of practiced apathy or scorn.
Jealousy aside, he had to admit the garden designed for Harry made for a perfect dinner setting. Then, a soft breeze ruffled Draco’s hair, bringing back his envy. He stifled a groan and tried not to think of the Manor’s tendency for rooms to swing from freezing to boiling.
Draco sent back unconvincing messages that he was fine, didn’t want company, and would let someone know if he needed anything. With a bottle of Malfoy Manor Pinot Gris and an Auror-themed romance novel, Draco hoped indulging in time-tested vices might start to ease the creeping loneliness of his newly empty flat.
Harry huffed. “That’s bullshit and you know it. You’re not your father.”
Once Hermione and Draco had laid out the priorities of the day, Draco snuck over to Shacklebolt’s office to check on Lavender. Her face was more gaunt than usual, her hair a bit less curly, but overall she looked well.
“Potter!” His eyes widened with concern. “You realize what they’ll assume about you. What they’ll print. You hate this kind of press coverage.”
“You guys can take my bed. I’ll spell the floor comfy.” When Simon opens his mouth to object, Harry silences him with a raised hand. “You’re our guests and I’ve slept on worse.”
Not Draco. No, never Draco. No matter how much he wished he were allowed.
Scorpius shuffled over to Harry, who, bless his kind heart, pretended not to know what was happening.
Whatever element of surprise we had is gone. I don’t have my magic. Wrapped up in Simon as I am, I’ve lost the edge my fangs give me. I haven’t felt this far out of my depth since America, and I don’t enjoy feeling that way again.
Harry nodded.
has, that I may never have magic in that way again (though I never really had it to begin with). But, if I’m going to have any magic at all, I like the idea that it exists to protect me.
Sunday wallowing in a bottle of wine?”
“Isn’t that, like, illegal?” Harry asked. “Serving magical wine to muggles?”
,” I hiss.
“I am really very confused,” Harry said, taking in the room with wide eyes: Pansy and Blaise near tears with laughter, Draco fuming and petulant but sipping his coffee like this was just another Tuesday. “I just,” Harry huffed, “I just!” He turned those eyes on Draco, and
“In the back garden?” Harry offered, not looking nearly chastised enough for Draco’s ad hoc etiquette lesson. He even had the audacity to move in the direction of his suggested location without first waiting for Draco’s approval.
“It started after the Battle of Hogwarts,” Harry started.
Draco ignored the surge of pride he felt that Harry trusted him with these secrets. Instead, he sipped his wine. “So how
“Potter, you’re a
Mother sighed, “Apparently he is visiting Harry Potter’s home today, and maybe there will be dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets, and also he is going to fly on a broom with his cousin who has purple hair. It’s a lot to take in.”
It took Draco a second before he caught the meaning. “I could tell you stories about him, if you want. About Dobby.”
Harry narrows his eyes. “There’s more to your story, but I’ll allow it. For now. What do you want to ask me? Or Malfoy?”
"I didn’t even know they knew each other,” Malfoy said, eyes fixed vacantly at the back of the Wizarding Athens hotel bar.
A shudder ran up Draco’s spine, and he passed the cigarette back to Treasure.
Scorpius looked up at Harry. “When did you first visit Hogsmeade, Mr. Potter?”
Harry frowned. “So, if it’s meant for muggles, why place it near Diagon?”
“Oh!” Harry started. “Er, right. So, ‘Harry Potter Lives at Number 12 Grimmauld Place.’”
Scorpius had no idea what to do with this information, so he settled on picking up his copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ and taking it to the living room with Rose. Harry watched the action with poorly disguised curiosity.
“I don’t know what I was thinking, agreeing to this,” Draco continued, taking Hermione’s silent cue to unleash his burden. “I mean, Astoria’s given me so much, and she’s never asked for anything in return. She means well, even if I know she’s wrong. And I shouldn’t expect anything different from Scorpius. I’ve been absent on purpose, which I used to think was better, but I’m starting to think is worse.
Simon nods, still a bit slack-jawed from our snog (once a mouth-breather…).
Finally locating the treats, Draco extended one to Winifred, who ate, hooted her approval, then escaped through the kitchen window.
“Simon’s incapable of growing a beard,” I explain. “I had to experience it while I still can.”
Draco smiled. “It’s a good one, but it’ll have to wait.” The stage lights came on, and Treasure mingled through the audience on his way to the front. “Shows about to start,” He winked at Harry.
“That look of intimidation is slightly lessened by your choice of fabric, Harry,” Draco teased.
“Heathen,” Draco smiled, knowing Harry would see right through any attempt to feign disgust. “Let’s start with a few opening volleys.” He rolled his shoulders and sat up straight, trying to slip into the role of reporter.
Draco suppressed his eye roll and allowed himself an internal,
“What?” Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “That I would have come out sooner if I’d understood what was at stake?”
Tucking my chin over his shoulder (it’s only when we’re seated that I match him for height), we watch the reflected pair.
It’s nowhere near what I need to be reassured, but the Headmistress has a look on her face that reminds me of Mrs Bunce. I know pushing this won’t get me anywhere with her. For now.
I can hear the blond’s heartbeat accelerate, but he manages to keep his voice flat when he answers. I’d be impressed with his control if I didn’t want to tear out his throat for harming Simon.
His eyes drift over to the wall and go a bit glassy.
“Like what?” Harry asks.
Twenty minutes later, and three grey hairs older, Draco rushed into his office to find Hermoine Granger-Weasley already standing behind her desk.
Baz jabs his elbow back into my side, gently. “I told you; no more food in the bedroom. You get crumbs everywhere.”
“And you have the key? Not Blaise?”
you can’t answer with your expressions like that. Merlin, you have no poker face.” Draco shook his head in exasperation. “Simply say, ‘I’m not currently looking, but I’m open to the possibility.”
“A non-magickal being born to wizarding families,” She explains.
“And how Voldemort claimed to have killed me?”
She lifts her wand and moves it in prescribed, graceful sweeps, murmuring softly to herself. Some of the spells I can see: smoke-like spirals and colorful geometric patterns colliding over my skin. Some of the spells I suspect can only be viewed through her lenses. They tingle a bit.
“You are too kind, Kreacher; the pleasure is all mine. I’m looking forward to an opportunity to see how well you’ve taken care of this esteemed home,” Draco said, taking joy in the way the house elf preened under Draco’s praise. At the rumble of his stomach, Draco decided to press his pure-blood advantage, an act Draco only used in desperate and, apparently hungry, times. “However, the tour will have to come later. For today, Master Harry promised that I will have the privilege of sampling your cooking.”
are not a Slytherin.”
“You know, I almost regret sending him to a mind healer. And then I remember his drunken debauchery and I decide that Zen Harry is infinitely better than Repressed and Depressed Harry,” Hermione said. “Only, I wish he remembered that lunchtime healing sessions are never a good idea.”
“My parents are dead,” Harry blurts out, then winces.
Then Harry grabs a spare blanket from his trunk, sets a cushioning spell, rolls up his dirty robes like a pillow, and falls asleep.
Snorting to himself, Harry shook his head. Who was he kidding? Here, in the privacy of his own mind, why was Harry still pretending to be something he wasn’t?
“So, today’s his last day here?” Harry asked.
Gryffindors were so easy.
Even Weasley seemed concerned at this statement, and opened his mouth to protest. Draco cut him off at the pass.
“You do realize there are muggle bars, right?”
“I might provide a little
“No!” Harry objected, his hand flying to his mouth to cover another yawn. “I can answer more questions.”
“That is possibly the most Ravenclaw thing I’ve ever heard you say,” Draco teased.
“Harry,” She said. “You’ve done more than enough for my family. I doubt weekly tea’s are necessary,” She smiled. “However, you are welcome to call on me whenever the mood strikes.” Then, after a beat, “Privately, of course.”
“Oh!” Draco exclaimed. “Right. Well, Scorpius and Mother will be home any minute. Maybe we could hold off? It’s Scorpius’s last night here.”
“Cast away.”
intimidating?” He tried to straighten up, puffing out his chest like that would add to the imposing factor.
“Oh that’s the exception,” Astoria explained, eyes twinkling. “‘Arse’ is on the card for when you looked at it.”
It wasn’t their best work, he had to admit, but thankfully the phrase ‘MOCK-UP’ was printed over the copy. “You’ve been holding out on me, Draco! ”
He swallowed and complied.
“That’s my cue,” He said, standing and straightening his gown. “Coming?”
They sidled up to the bar. It wasn’t too busy; they’d arrived before the pre-Bingo crush. Draco caught the bartender’s attention easily enough and ordered two house reds. Draco watched Harry’s face as the bartender poured two cups full of mystery liquid from a cold-box, his curiosity evident.
“I know you say it often enough, but it’s still hard to believe,” Draco admitted.
It was the most comfortable Draco had felt with Scorpius, and he didn’t want to dwell on the fact it was prompted by having Harry Potter act like a boyfriend inside Draco’s kitchen.
“Draco,” Hermione said, turning to him. “It’s a perfect start.”
“And Luna?”
Then, an itching sensation spreads across my face.
Draco paused in his steps. “You’re right,” He answered with a slight head ruffle. “I shouldn’t have called Auntie Pansy that word.”
,” Harry sighed and reached over the table, swiping a bit of beer foam off the tip of Draco’s nose. Then, he sucked the offending finger into his mouth.
“Cheers,” Harry said, raising his wine glass with a satisfying clink against Draco’s.
Without a word or a wand, the man
The resulting beam across Harry’s face made Draco’s sudden lack of self-preservation worth it. “Really? That’d be fantastic! Can I invite Teddy? He’s a bit older, but it’d keep Scorpius occupied while we work, and they’re basically cousins.”
He pushed aside the memory of an outstretched hand untaken and read on.
!” She squealed, and in the next breath, whipped her gaze to Harry. “Potter, are you
Draco tapped his shoe on the carpet, lamenting the lack of noise the nervous movement made. He cast a Tempus for the third time in ten minutes. Another morning of rarities: Hermione Granger-Weasley was
He grinned, following her into his office with a rediscovered pep to his step. “I already have a few ideas, if you want to hear them.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Probably to strategize his,” Draco darted his eyes around the room, as if a Prophet reporter was lying in wait to capture this lead. “
[DLM]
Harry laughed. “Well, therapy has definitely taught me
No one answered. Draco didn’t want them to. He let them sit in the silent wake of his question for a few minutes, then cleared his throat. “How did the author know about the forced Crucios? How did they know the exact pain I felt when taking the mark?”
Even though Draco knew the sender, he couldn’t help but poke the lion.
“Good,” Draco praised, delighted to see the flush on Harry’s cheeks for the compliment. “Are you currently dating anyone?”
“Darling,” She cooed, reaching across the table for his arm, which he allowed at the sound of contrition leaking into her voice. “It’s not character assassination if it’s true.”
“Oh, they definitely don’t sparkle in the sun. They combust.”
Rubbing his arm gently again, “Honey, when it comes to Potter, you’re as transparent as Thestral hide.”
In the excitement of their greeting, Harry crossed the living room to Draco’s side. “Is it hard to stay mad at her for appropriating our likenesses to have weird kinky sex because she loves your son so much?”
Draco whispered, “Well, I’m not sure if French cuisine appeals to a pre-teen, but my knowledge of Scorpius’s preferences is hardly robust.”
Glaring down his nose, “Absolutely not.
“Well then,” Draco smirked. “I suppose we’ll be off. Mother, thank you as always for your service. Scorpius, are you ready to leave? We’ll have to Apparate there instead of Floo.”
Harry nodded, then covered his subsequent yawn. “What else do you have for me?”
“But,” Draco ran his fingers through his hair. “Since when do you care about me?”
“She wanted to try, despite it all. But I was so angry. It was the only emotion I could feel in the aftermath. I stupidly thought, ‘I’ll dump her, and she’ll realize what she’s missing, and then she’ll come crawling back to me.’ Only, what she was missing was better than what we’d had.”
, instantly,” Baz corrects. “After all, old family son,” He points at himself, “Mage’s Heir,” He points at Simon. With a dramatic sigh, “Star-crossed lovers.”
“Squib?” Simon repeats, wrinkling his nose.
“As if I’d trust you with a comb,” I scoff.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. “She’s certainly…”
“Of course it does,” Draco groaned.
Draco shot her a look of incredulity. “Do you really want to know?” He rarely brought up his family around Hermione. Not when she still had that souvenir from his crazy aunt carved onto her arm.
“It’s nothing,” Draco said, though the expression on Hermione’s face indicated she didn’t believe him for a second. Sighing, “
I chance a glance at Simon, who’s giving me his lets-be-honest face. Although, when
Well, they certainly lifted
“No,” Hermione admitted. “But I understood, regardless.” She walked into her office. “Coming? Or have you already quit?”
This is seriously one of my favorite chapters I've written thus far. Pansy's a joy to write. Hope you enjoyed it!
“Well,” Draco drawled, eyeing the way the foam highlighted the strong muscles of Harry’s forearms. “That would imply a desire to clean the dishes myself, which I clearly don’t have.” He looked over at Scorpius, whose eyes twinkled at the exchange, and Draco winked at his son.
Laughing, “Seems like you’ve recovered quickly from the one you just threw yourself.”
a Hufflepuff.”
The blond walks up to the mirror, scowls at the fringe falling in his face, then slicks it back.
“Oh,” Harry breathed. “That’s a relief, actually. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, either, but people keep telling me it’s a big deal and asking me when I’m going to announce it.”
“Yes,” Draco admitted. “And, take it from me, it’s hardly worth the energy.”
Harry nodded. “When I wasn’t having nightmares about the war, I had… confusing dreams.”
She blushed. “Sorry, I know that’s rude of us.”
“Really? They don’t seem your type.”
Lavender laughed, “Draco, you don’t need to bribe me to go to lunch with you.”
“I dunno, I do remember you saying you were very huggable…”
,” She gasps. Raising her wand, “Can I release the Glamour?”
“I kissed him in a forest after he tried to burn himself alive,” Simon adds. “What?” He says to Baz’s dropped jaw. “How would you explain it?”
“Pining Baz tried to steal your voice.”
Draco smirked. “Right up there with marrying Weasley, huh?”
“Is that what you mean by ‘Wizarding World Education For Muggles?”
The weight of his epiphany hit him with a dropping sensation in his stomach. He drained his glass in one gulp.
“Oh no, Draco. This one’s for you,” Hermione winked, pausing outside her office door to switch coffees with Draco. “I figured you’d earned it, given your two big boy moves last night.” She looked him up and down, catching Draco’s leg jiggle before he had time to still it. “Unless you want to take it back?”
“No. Not you, too!” Draco closed his eyes and sighed. Re-opening them, “I thought I’d at least be safe with you two.”
I?” Mother said, with more of a hint of sarcasm than Draco’d ever heard in her voice before. “How kind of you,” She added, leading the boy out of Draco’s flat, turning back at the door to give her son a brief wink before leaving.
Not long after Harry left, Scorpius tugged on Draco’s arm. “Can we go home, now?” He asked in a quiet voice.
Draco hardly had to ask; Scorpius pulled his father out the front door with a terrifying show of force for a 10-year-old. As the front door closed behind them, Draco could almost hear the sigh of relief his mother exhaled at their departure.
After staring, blinking, at the spot that used to hold Lavender for a few minutes, Draco took her message to Hermione.
“No, the part where you said I’m right. This night has not at all turned out like I needed it to, so I might as well take something home for my wank file.” As tempted as he was to peek at Harry’s reaction, Draco kept his eyelids firmly shut.
“As if I’d let him go on air in these clothes,” Draco gestured at Harry’s baggy jeans, t-shirt, and ratty trainers.
Harry cut off the WT.
FYI: I am trying to post once a week. If you're interested in my personal scheduling goals.
Harry nodded. “Try me.”
“Oh. Draco. Hello,” Potter said.
She crumpled up a spare strip of parchment and chunked it at his head, which he dodged easily. If he were 10 years younger, he’d claim Seeker skills, but it’d been ages since he played and by now his muscle memory came mostly from dodging Hermione’s parchment balls rather than bludgers.
“Yes, Potter,” The smile in her voice was obvious even though Draco couldn’t see it.
Now was Draco’s turn to roll his eyes. “If only we’d thought to evaluate our prejudices
“You bitch,” Pansy said, stomping straight into the kitchen. She threw down a copy of The Prophet in front of Draco, her chipped crimson fingernail landing on the banner headline:
Harry and Draco were left alone in the resulting silence.
He threw his hands up. “Fine! Whatever. I just wish everyone would stop insulting my clothes. They’re comfy.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. He’d only known Hermione to enforce a closed door, no visitors policy once, maybe twice, in his time working for her. “Sure, whatever you need.”
Again, the Headmistress pinches above her nose. “Mr Potter, what will it take for me to convince you that the weight of the world no longer falls on your shoulders?”
“No, I don’t,” Baz’s hair sweeps the side of my face as he scans the mirror. “What am I looking at?”
Blinking. “What, like I’m a creature?”
“Someone who can speak with magic,” Baz explains.
Raising one eyebrow. “That’s all? You realize I was copied on that Owl. And, even if I wasn’t, you could have just sent a CL.”
You're DAMN right!
He beamed, and, for once, didn’t calculate the amount of wrinkle reducing potions the act would necessitate. “It’s real. Astoria and I have changed our custody plans.”
It wasn’t Imperio that spurred the movement. No, he knew what that felt like. Still, he saw his hand move on someone else’s order other than his own.
Astoria pushed back in her chair and launched herself into Draco’s arms as if the wooden table between them didn’t exist. “I knew I could convince you!” She placed a wet kiss on his cheek. “You
“Compare notes about what?” Draco asked, though he shot Pansy a warning glare.
Drawing the book to him, Draco flipped through the pages, found the scene, and read.
She trained him with a questioning gaze. “The week with Scorpius, it was manageable, wasn’t it?”
“Are you going to Polyjuice into me for sex stuff?” Harry gaped.
Salazar save Draco from the knowledge of
doing right by him. That his life would be easier if he didn’t know the death eater father he’d been saddled with. But he won’t look at me. And he won’t talk to me. And it hurts. More than it used to.” Draco paused for a breath. “Granger-Weasley, did you put Veritaserum in this wine?”
Draco smiled, “No. It’s hard to stay mad at her for her blatant disregard of boundaries because I love
Simon elbows Baz. “There’s a similarity. Do they also like melted chocolate bars disguised as lattes?”
you discover your sexuality?”
“Not like this,” She breathed, clearly giddy. “You were giving him the kind of face you reserve for guys with whom you think you have a chance. For gay men only, that face.”
Scorpius chimed in, “
With a gulp, Draco turned to Harry. “I’ll be watching,” He promised.
Draco smiled. Sometimes, Potter was too easy.
A large owl thumped against the window; Harry waved it inside.
Lavender nodded. “Truth,” She said. Then, she cocked her head, and gave Draco an appraising glance. “Something is different about you. You,” She sniffed. “You smell happy.”
Draco scoffed before he could stop himself. “He’s all Astoria.”
“How did you two get together?”
“Oh Godric. I really am the worst house guest, aren’t I?” Harry moaned, throwing his head back on the sofa.
And Pansy had to pop the bubble. Because while Draco’s mind choked on Harry’s question, Pansy stalked over and plucked a hair from Potter’s head.
“Well, I could hardly have taken you because—” He stopped, realizing he couldn’t admit why he didn’t invite Lavender.
Draco wondered for a brief moment how Hermoine knew to reach him through Harry, and then he remembered who he was dealing with and left the thought alone.
“The wings?” The Headmistress asks, again scanning the area behind me where my wings
Draco tried not to look uncomfortable, remembering his own role in the whole affair. Lavender rolled her eyes.
And as he read, he started to fume.
Harry and Draco (finally) get down to some press conference prep. Also, some fun backstory is revealed.
Scorpius returned his intense focus to breakfast, finishing off all of his bacon and most of his eggs before he broached the topic again. “But you’re friends now?”
She caught onto his hesitation at once. “Because why, Draco?” Her eyes narrowed, and Draco sighed. He did call her voice shrill; he could owe her this.
If you liked this story, and my writing, and you'd like to read more of my stuff, drop a comment because, sadly, nothing motivates me to write like external validation. I have about five WIPs (lol) so I need all the help I can get.
Draco and Hermione have their first legislative meeting, Astoria confesses, and Draco makes a decision.
“Neat!” Harry says, diffusing the rod of tension through my center with one word. Harry tilts his head. “Of course, I know why I didn’t see it before; you don’t look at all like
“You have no idea how much I needed this time away from the office,” Draco confessed as she sat down across from him. “If I have to hear one more—” His sentence was cut short by the arrival of Ron through the main entryway.
Harry leaned over the table. “What if I told you the Sorting Hat tried to place me in Slytherin? Could I come then?”
Draco laughed. “The same. Needless to say, I did not make a good impression. Mr. Potter refused to be my friend. In fact, we had a rather legendary rivalry at school.” He paused, taking a deep breath. “It’s not something I’m very proud of.”
Harry swallowed and allowed himself the luxury of examining Malfoy without blinders for the first time in five years.
“Carefully,” Draco deadpans.
,” He added, though at the moment he felt like taking back any expressive face he’d ever gifted her.
Guillaume took a second look at his customer, and, having finally recognized him, blanched.
, Potter. You’ve known me for ages,” Draco reminded him.
“Draco!” Harry greeted, stealing the bag from his hand and opening it. “What did you bring me?”
“Huh,” Harry said, taking in the new attraction. “What a good idea!”
The way I figure, my story will come out sooner or later, and I get a good feeling about the Headmistress (or do I only trust people who give me food?) (I’ll unpack that later). Plus, I hate people speculating about my wings and magic and backstory. Now that I know we’re stuck here for at least a week, I have a plan.
“Confusing?”
<3 <3 <3
He’s going to hate himself for asking, but he has to know.
Harry chuckled. “You’re about to find out. Just remember that when I say go, you touch the can of beans.”
The grin on Draco’s face turned wicked. “Exactly.”
He couldn’t help but double down, placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder, then slowly dragging it over to the nape of his neck, adding a few massaging squeezes for emphasis. “See you tomorrow, Harry,” Draco added in a low tone, watching a flash of red spread up the back of Harry’s neck.
Draco nodded. Exhaled.
“Luna Lovegood?” Draco should have been surprised, but after she wrote to him offering her forgiveness, unbidden, for the atrocities committed against her at his childhood home, he’d long since learned not to expect anything but the unexpected from his cousin.
“I’m a Slytherin, dear. Secrets are payment.” With that, Draco stole a bite of Harry’s spare roll.
Wrinkling his nose, Scorpius asked, “Do I have to?”
She blinks. “It is no trouble at all, Mr Snow.” She waves her wand and a clock rises out of its tip. “My goodness!” Glaring at Harry, “Mr Potter, you ought to have left for Transfiguration 15 minutes ago.”
“You know,” Draco said, flicking his gaze down his book, feigning nonchalance. “It’s rude to Apparate into someone’s house without invitation.” He ventured a glance up at Harry, who stared back, aghast.
“Ooh, I like that phrasing,” Hermione said, opening up her CL to jot it down while Draco breathed a sigh of relief. Unaware of Draco’s nerves, Hermione looked back at the board. “‘Relaxing the Statue of Secrecy Rules’? What did you have in mind?”
Trying to ignore the lump forming in his throat at the casual touch and reference, Draco nodded. “Of course, Scorpius. If that’s what you want.”
. Come with me.”
“No,” Harry shook his head. “No, I think it’d be good to talk about it.” He took a deep breath. “Honestly, before things fell apart after sixth year, I couldn’t have imagined a future without Ginny. She represented everything I wanted in life: home, stability, love. Plus,” Here, Harry grinned. “She was smart, resourceful, and full of life. More traits I appreciate. I ended things with her just before I took off with Hermione and Ron.” Harry paused. “You know the story?”
Dedicated to
“Well,” She blushed. “I’ve known him for awhile, actually. He’s the Co-PI on my research project.”
I have no idea what a body bind is; the magic here works differently than back home. Like in America, I’m not sure my spells will fire. Luckily, the blond doesn’t know that. Under my threat, he releases Simon (and secures himself another moment of life. I may not have my magic here, but I still have my teeth).
“Forgive me, Draco,” Harry said, looking confused. “But I fail to see the problem?”
long, given Snow’s track record.
“Dumbledore.”
“Not entirely,” Draco explained. “It’s designed for muggles, but the location isn’t a coincidence. The Pub is under magic, a sort of wizard-repelling Charm. Muggles can see and enter without issue, but wizards have to use a special code to enter.”
,” Lavender gave in. “It’s just. There’s a boy.”
Draco smoothed down one of the legs of his trousers, noting that he’d failed to change into matching shoes. He sipped more than a healthy mouthful of wine before answering. “Awful, actually.”
and is therefore beneath Draco’s continued kinship).
Draco held his breath, wrapped himself up in the velvet of her words, and, well,
“Of course,” Draco snarled. He pulled out the small charm as proof. “Lifted it off his cheating ass when he came by my room to return his ring.”
She grinned. “Not even going to negotiate? Come on. I busted out my negotiation textbooks for this!” She gestured at a row of books, full of flags and highlights.
“Mr. Potter! You’re still here,” Scorpius said, his face flushed with the excitement of the outdoors.
We spent nearly a week watching our strange mirror counterparts before joining them on the other side. I should be grateful we lasted
All of that magic, all of that
Casual acquaintances often misread Astoria; thinking her more Hufflepuff than anything else. Moments like these reminded Draco that his ex-wife had more Slytherin in her bones than credited. She’d engineered a masterful plan. Manipulated Draco with expert precision. Merlin, he loved her.
Draco’s CL buzzed. “And now, I’ll display more un-Malfoy-esque manners,” He said, pulling out the notebook, knowing it’d be personal rather than work. He flicked to his new messages.
“You’re smiling,” Hermione interrupted Draco’s not-actually-flirting flirting. “You’re smiling, and you’re messaging. What’s going on? And don’t tell me it’s Lavender, because I know she’s out today.”
“Smaller,” Draco smirked. “At least, you were.” He straightened up, using the advantage of his two inches over Harry. “Still are, actually.”
I guess I’ve been missing that bit of mystery since The Chosen One Debacle. That big ol’ adventure chase. Because when the strange man reflected in Baz’s and my bedroom mirror turned solid, I couldn’t help but reach out to touch.
Together, they stepped out of the suite, and into the light.
“Thanks,” I beam at the Headmistress.
Shrugging, Scorpius allowed his gaze to linger on his new favorite book.
Pulling out his own CL, Draco penned a reminder to himself about cancelling with Mother, noted the many missed messages from Hermione (she always failed to remember that, unlike her, he didn’t check his CL while out of the office). He made another note to ask Hermione about charming the notebooks so you could silence work messages while allowing personal ones to buzz, which would be an interesting project for her—.
,” Baz grumbles. “There’s only about, oh, seven years of it.”
I grab his hand before he can retract it, giving his index finger a little nip.
“Again, a CL or an Owl would have sufficed.”
Draco dropped his pointing hand, not willing to continue exerting the effort. “I could befriend a thousand werewolves, apologize a million times, and none of that would ever erase what I’ve done. Only I know the weight of my mistakes and I’d never inflict that on my son.”
“Can we invite Mr. Potter to join us?” Scorpius asked.
“You take care of everyone,” Draco whispers. “But who takes care of you?”
“True. But it doesn’t lessen your pain, knowing that other people hurt more than you. It’s like,” Harry sighed. “People are always trying to skip over the problem to get to the solution. And I get that, who wants to dwell in the bad, right?”
you agree to go to lunch with me.”
“And?”
Harry scoffed. “Don’t presume to tell me what I mean.” He drew his hand back, crossing arms over his chest.
“I’ll be there,” Harry promised.
“Yes, I did.” Draco continued sipping his wine. He wouldn’t pry. He wouldn’t.
Draco tried to scowl, but he always felt so pleased when people noticed things about him. Especially things that made him cute.
Draco leaned back in his chair. “Yes, well. Treasure and I have known each other for a few years now. I used to be quite the regular here.”
,” Harry moaned.
Harry gave a resigned sigh and sat back down in his chair, crossing arms across his chest.
“We call ourselves wizards.” Harry catches the Headmistress’s eye briefly before turning back to us. “And witches. Wixen, if you prefer a gender neutral term.”
As they walked onwards to butterbeer, Draco reflected on their conversation. Argument. Whatever.
,” He sighed. “Tell me about this bingo.” At least his outings at The Pub meant he understood the general game, if not the point of this Slytherin-specific version.
Again, Draco marveled at the changes one week could inspire. He grabbed a waffle, some bacon, and eggs as well. The two ate in silence while Draco contemplated his next steps (while refraining from commenting about the devolution in Scorpius’s table manners).
Following Scorpius, holding tightly onto the wine that would likely keep him from screaming in frustration all night, Draco called out, “The Burrow II,” and it was a mark on his state of mind that the terrible name didn’t make him shudder like it normally did.
Harry nodded. “Recognize it? It’s the old Black home.”
She whispers an incantation that make my wings and tail reveal themselves. She holds my tail gently, bringing it up to her eyes. “It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. But the wings are almost like a Peruvian Vipertooth.”
Draco, poor soul, has an unflattering mustache that curls at the ends. Harry’s grown a rugged five o’clock scruff.
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry teased.
“Of course you have the right,” Harry said, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “It’s never too late to fix the things we’ve broken.”
“Is it really?” Harry breathed. “I had no idea.”
To think, they’d agreed to stay virgins until marriage. And Harry’d believed her.
With a sigh, Draco holds the shot glass over the pint and waits. Simon and I follow suit.
“Mr. Malfoy! I take it this young man is whom you’ve referred to my services?” Guillaume greeted, a note of disdain in his voice.
“Have a biscuit, boys.”
“Ah, those kinds of dreams.” Draco shook his head. Because what did Harry need after surviving a war—given he’d literally died then came back to life, had his girlfriend cheat on him, witnessed the murders of friends and loved ones, and been abandoned by his two closest friends—but an identity crisis to top it all off?
[HJP]
She had the audacity to look aghast. “There’s no plot! Really! Just finally forcing together two parts of our lives that matter to us.” She gestured between Draco and Harry. “And look. No blood. No Unforgivables. Just two blokes, becoming fast friends. Right, Harry?”
It wasn’t much, but it was a start. He hoped Hermione would help add to the list, but maybe she wasn’t interested in helping him anymore. Maybe, she’d just tell him to pick one of the open positions at the Ministry and move on. That’s why she was late; she didn’t really want him working for her, after all.
Draco looked down at his remaining cake, only the icing left, and felt his soul leave his body. He couldn’t tell what was more disturbing: that Harry Potter thought he was capable, or that Harry Potter was himself capable of pulling a truth from Draco’s mind that he had never considered.
The night started on the right foot. After Scorpius exited the Floo, Rose took one look at his book, and started chattering about recreating some of the scenes. Draco was certain even the wine couldn’t save him if they started to mime fixing vanishing cabinets, but the two settled on a Quidditch scene, enjoying the expansive lawn that the Granger-Weasley’s shared with the original Weasley’s—those of The Burrow I.
Harry rolled his eyes. “It’s not a competition. And if it was, I’d win every time, against everyone. Which I actually don’t want, believe it or not. Pain is relative. To someone who’d never been injured before, a paper cut would feel like the worst injury in the world. Is it fair to tell them they aren’t hurt, just because you’d broken a leg before?”
not on. “Draco,” She started, but he’d have none of that.
With a groan, “
“Message me?” Harry asked, always the brave one. “After the conference?”
Raising an eyebrow, “You’re going to just, what, tell me what to say? Isn’t that cheating?”
After a beat, Draco clapped his hands together. “Let’s go out!”
“Ah, Fidelius charm. Neat,” Draco nodded, not at all focusing on the fact Harry’s warm hands had yet to leave Draco’s shoulders. He shook them off. “All right, now show me inside. Chop chop.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry reassured her with his temporary face. “His bark is worse than his bite. He’s basically harmless.”
“But what?”
the shrill tone of her voice today.
Also, if you don't tuck your loved ones in and think 'lil burrito' do you really love them?
Covered up to the elbows in suds, Harry scoffed, “I’d like to see you try to stop me.”
“Fine,” Draco delivered the standard line. At her unconvinced gaze, “I got a new job.”
Draco looked at Harry, needing guidance for some reason. Harry provided, “Apparently Rose has been begging to see Scorpius for days. She’s the spitting image of Hermoine; I wouldn’t dare deny her something she wanted this badly.”
Ron grimaced. “Oh god, now I’m just thinking about how the, uh. How the
“Someone at Gringotts will have a fun time lightening my vaults today,” Harry snarked, signing the transfer slip for payment, then shrinking his purchases pocket-sized.
She gave him a death glare, “Oh really? Because it looks like you had actual juicy gossip last night and, instead of sharing it, you let me whinge about my fucking botched manicure for nearly thirty minutes.”
[HJP]
Then, the house lights came on, and Treasure invited them for his break outside after slapping down a ‘Reserved’ sign on their table.
She shrugged. “Should have given me the coffee yourself. You know the rules. She who caffeinates The Whirlwind receives her blessing.” Then, she disappeared behind her door.
inspired an epilogue! Thank you so much *kiss emoji*
,” Draco accepted.
With strength Harry hadn’t anticipated, Draco flipped Harry over and settled on top.
“Hey!” Harry objected.
“Sorry, I’ve been trying to figure out why one glass of wine was affecting me so deeply, and I just remembered I didn’t eat lunch.” Draco swallowed. “So, you see, mystery solved.”
Standing in line for his scheduled coffee run, Draco tried and failed to erase the memory of Scorpius’s empty room from that morning.
They stared at their half empty plates and not each other.
was exactly why he didn’t go to Drag Queen Bingo on Sundays anymore.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Got a glimpse of the afterlife. Dumbledore was there.”
“I’ve got a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore,” Harry said in a joking tone, though Draco didn’t understand the punch line.
Harry shrugged. “I’ll let you know if it gets too personal, and I promise to keep what you say between us, unless you’re planning to quit or something,” Harry joked.
Hermione smiled. “Admittedly, Dumbledore’s explanation to my parents was somewhat lacking in detail. I’ll never forget the looks on my parents’ faces when I came back after coming of age and could do magic in the house. I swear, they had no idea what they’d gotten into.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, but before Harry could elaborate, Scorpius and Mother returned from the park.
Harry nodded. “I owe her a life debt, so she’s very important to me.” He caught her gaze again. “Even if I don’t get to see her very often.”
The tapping of owls and CL buzzing haunted the rest of Draco’s day (it had only taken Hermione a day to figure out to allow personal messages through Draco’s work-do-not-disturb, and had sent the charm updates to his CL overnight. Without warning).
Really, how could it surprise him? That Harry had organized a ‘coming out’ party at The Pub? That the whole event would serve as a fundraiser for Potter Friends? That Harry had given an invitation to Draco, personally?
The sunlight glinted off Harry’s (still unfashionable) glasses, rendering his expression unreadable. “Right, Hermione.”
, Harry scoffed. How absurd that, five years after the war and a shared jilting to boot, Harry still couldn’t refer to the man by his first name. Well, fuck that.
“It gets worse,” Harry winced.
He seems to understand what she’s asking, and waves over a tray of tea and biscuits.
“Don’t use your bullshit werewolf senses on me, Brown. I know you can’t smell happiness.”
Harry gave Draco the exasperated glare of someone who’d heard this question before. “Just because you don’t see the work, doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.”
“Harry,” His warning failed both in timing and in confirming who stood before him.
Harry necked his beer to hide his red cheeks.
Blinking, “Harry I--” He reached out one hand, barely leaving the orbit of his body, but enough that Harry knew the emotional cost of the action.
“You go,” Baz replies, leaning his head into Simon’s hands, letting his eyes fall closed. “I want to hear how you explain this.”
“Don’t spill,” He warns. “The sheets are silk and don’t respond well to cleaning spells.”
bisexual is not a big deal, but announcing it is,” Draco asserted, without first thinking he should maybe filter his wine-brain a bit better.
“I take it back.”
Harry, Pansy and Draco glanced between one another.
. Who else could help parse the utter chaos that had been his last few days?
He planned to wait until the clock struck 10. Until he could reasonably assume at least one cup of coffee had passed his so-called best friend’s lips. He tapped his nails on the back cover of the book he’d finished a few hours earlier.
Draco looked up just in time to catch Lavender’s lower lip tremble.
Harry watched the entire exchange with a bemused look on his face, while Draco tried to school his shock into an expression of gratitude toward the repulsive, though well-mannered, elf.
Draco sat up straight in his chair. “Harry, you don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.”
“Can’t,” Draco responded, grateful for the impulsive promise he’d made to his mother. “I’m taking Mother and Scorpius out to dinner.”
office.”
Draco ignored Harry’s rolling eyes, and thanked Kreacher sincerely. Once the house elf left, Draco and Harry sat at the table, surveying the options.
“How do you know Harry Potter?” Scorpius asked.
The Granger-Weasleys waved back, until the fire erased their smiling faces.
“I thought it was dramatic,” Baz confesses.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed, but didn’t press.
Draco quirked an eyebrow at this strangely emphatic response, but continued his prior train of thought. “So, you want to keep something just for you and your loved ones.” He paused, trying not to preen in how Harry kept nodding along, agreeing with Draco’s insight. “There are lots of secrets I’d support you keeping, you know. I’m not just pushing you to bare your whole soul for the sake of my enjoyment. Only, this secret you need to share because it matters.”
Harry shook his head, his own urge to laugh stifled. “I really don’t think you do.” Draco scoffed, and Harry scowled. “Get your ass back in bed.”
“Ok,” Harry agreed. “On one condition.”
like me, you know? He had Pansy as a beard, and then his dark missions to distract his parents from whatever it was Draco wanked to at night.” Glancing at Draco, “I’m not treading on too personal a thread, am I?”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “So it’s serious. I’ll need to meet him, of course,” He commanded, picking up the remaining egg roll to use for emphasis, before disappearing it down his throat.
he thinks.
Draco was pretty sure Potter couldn’t hear the sound of Draco’s internal explosion, but if he could, he’d expect Potter would be impressed with the way Draco powered through the glass crashing and debris spreading in his brain to make his retort.
Astoria fixed him with a pitying glance, which was unfair and
“One of the best mistakes of my life,” She said.
Draco raised one eyebrow.
Draco didn’t feel embarrassed at the overflow of emotions he’d spilled at Hermione’s feet. Worse than that, he felt
Draco examined the look of exasperation on Harry’s face. Then, he poured wine until their glasses were almost overfilled. “Change of plans. First, you’ll need to confess all of your secrets to me,
Treasure groaned. “God, they say never meet your idols, but of course you’d be the exception.” He turned to Draco, “Is he really this noble? I mean, I thought your martyr act was bad, but his takes the cake.”
“Yes, yes,” Baz murmurs, settling deep into Simon’s lap. “You know all about repressed homosexual love for your archnemesis. Bravo. You’re the expert.”
Harry laughed. “Sorry, I thought—” He shook his head. “It’s a muggle movie reference. Remind me to show it to you sometime.”
Clearing his throat, Draco asked, “So, how’s Mark?”
Hermione leapt off the couch. “Well then, no sense in dallying when my husband needs me. I’ll just leave you two to, um.” She stared at the mess in her living room: Draco, looking indignant and slightly drunk on the couch, Potter, seeming confused but somehow amused by the turn of events, her three-year-old son, licking a cork duck like a popsicle. “Harry, you said you were ready to make a decision? Why don’t you talk about that with Draco? And, Draco? Listen to Harry.” She sprinted to the kitchen. Hugo looked up at her departure, gave the cork one last lick, then dropped it as he waddled out of the room.
With a short scritch as distraction, Draco pulled the small letter off her leg and read:
Note: I've finally written an end chapter on this story, so only two more chapters to go! I've been waiting for the next two main events for so long now, it's exciting to almost be finished.
“You’re Harry Potter,” Scorpius said, in a showing of his Greengrass genes.
Draco’s eyes flicked to Harry’s in a heartbeat, but instead of invitation they held hostility. “You don’t mean that.”
“I didn’t, actually. Not until Potter told me.” Draco didn’t mean for it to come out bitter, but the emotion laid itself on his words without permission.
Ignoring Simon’s and my baffled expressions, he waves his wand and speaks in Latin until four glasses, four shot glasses and a tray emerge on the bed. I raise my eyebrows; that’s one nifty trick. Draco waves over Harry’s bottles and places them on the tray in the center of the bed.
Scorpius nodded emphatically.
” Then, she had the audacity to
manners.
Potter left before Draco, though not before exchanging their CL contact information.
“You’re helping the economy, Harry. Always remember that.”
book,” Draco scowled. “‘The Wrong Sider.’ Bah. What a stupid name?”
Without pause, Scorpius dug into the stack of waffles, adding several slices of bacon as well.
And he ripped his arm back.
Huffing, “I doubt your fifth year fantasies included a boyfriend with PTSD and dragon wings.”
“I know that now, Draco. Of course I do. I’m just painting a picture of the broken Harry.” He smiled, and, again, Draco wondered how much of the expression was true and how much of it was what Harry wished were true. “And, then, the dreams started.”
“Never,” Draco replied, eyes trained on the dark hair that traveled from Harry’s navel to disappear beneath the waist of his jeans. “Startling you is basically my new hobby.”
Entering his living room, he rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands. Despite his anguish, no tears would come. His CL buzzed in his pocket, and he silenced it. Then, he blocked his Floo against everyone except Astoria. That was one door he wouldn’t close today.
“I’ll stay until you get back, Scorpius,” Harry Potter reassured him.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
The lift dinged, and two Aurors joined them. Distracted by the newcomers, Lavender handed Draco the hangover potion without further delay. He downed it, shuddered, and chased the foul potion with another sip of coffee. The Aurors gave him knowing glances, one judgmental and the other sympathetic. Draco smiled at the sympathetic one.
“Blaming the ten pounds you gained after starting working for Hermione on a revenge hex,” She teased.
The looks of joy fell from Blaise’s and Pansy’s faces. Turns out, the Zabinis had found their line, and it was mocking Draco’s attempts to become a better father.
The Prophet catches Draco and Harry in Hogsmeade, but don't worry: Pansy has a solution for that.
“Don’t,” Draco held up his left hand, winced, and stumbled back, hastily rolling down the sleeves of his shirt until they covered his forearms.
[DLM]
Pushing aside his inadequacies, Draco returned his focus to Harry. He had yet to stop his gentle backrub, and paused for a moment to give Harry an extra tight squeeze. He hoped the subtle movement would convey to Harry his friendship and care. The things he couldn’t brave speaking out loud.
Speaking of, he noticed ‘The Wrong Sider’ had relocated itself from his bookshelf and onto the coffee table. A note on top in Astoria’s handwriting read,
The next day, everything went wrong. Draco woke up to the screech of his alarm. The Prophet’s owl tore up half of the international section. He’d run out of his favorite tea. He barely had time to make toast, not that Scorpius even left his room to find breakfast.
The responding moan left Draco bereft of all thought and caution. Allowing both hands purchase in that black mane, he pressed his body flush against Harry, satisfied to feel the mutual effects of the extended seduction. He mouthed along Harry’s jaw, drawing up the courage to taste his mouth, but faltered once there. He dropped his forehead to Harry’s.
“Seriously!” Harry defends. “He let deatheaters into Hogwarts. Nearly killed two classmates, one of which was
With a deep sigh, Draco fingered the embossed invitation and leaned back against the Leaky’s exterior. The brick held the lingering day’s heat, but a cool breeze kept him from heading back inside despite the beads of sweat gathering on his forehead. He closed his eyes and counted each breath, in and out, as he relished the respite from laughter and conversations he couldn’t yet allow himself to enter.
“Well,” Draco cleared his throat. “We’re definitely going to unpack
Draco sighed. “I suppose not but.” He gulped. “I don’t particularly want to be alone.”
“Ok,” Draco cracked his knuckles. “You ready?”
Rolling her eyes, “Come off it, Draco.
Shaking his self-pity, he returned his thoughts to Astoria’s presence.
Harry clears his throat.
The wry look on Harry’s face revealed he knew exactly what Slytherin trick Draco’d deployed, but he allowed the change in topic. “Resilient.”
“One can only wonder, Potter, why you continue to underestimate me so?” Draco drawled, his hand lightly resting on Harry’s shoulder, until Draco noticed and pulled it away.
Hermoine and Ron gave each other a look, and Draco’s heart sank.
while Draco laughed and indulged his son’s wishes, some faceless partner smiling at Draco with warmth and love.
“Yes, yes, hello,” She flushed. “Now shut up, dear. Draco was just about to complain.”
is Potter here?”
“Will you come to Hogsmeade with us, Mr. Potter?” Scorpius asked, his big, blue eyes tearing down the defenses of the Saviour.
Harry sipped his cocktail. “Why not?”
Draco shrugged. “Maybe, maybe not.”
Draco let Potter have the win; this triumph fifteen years in the making. “
I kiss my favorite spot on his neck, just below the hairline over his scar, and sigh. “Because you look so good with it falling loose on your face,” I whisper in his ear. On second thought, this confession doesn’t hurt at all.
“I look 20?” Draco preened.
“Yes, I separated that out because it’d be helpful for muggle-borns and their families as well. Provide more help than just the headmaster dropping in for one conversation before asking your parents to send you off to magical boarding school for seven years, no context provided at all.”

“Tell me you don’t want this.”
He turned into her kitchen, and stopped short of the sight of one Harry Potter having mimosas with his best friend. Wearing a second day outfit of his own. Sporting, Draco gulped, a rather prominent love bite he’d yet to heal.
He tried not to be offended at her hesitancy in revealing this. She knew better; obviously, Draco had evolved in his way of thinking on pure-blood and wizarding supremacy. But they’d both been raised in the same restrictive environment, stuffed full of prejudice until their insides were fit to burst with hatred. Astoria’s wariness wasn’t personal; it was ingrained.
Draco nodded, surprised as always at her memory. He suspected Hermoine employed a series of charms and spells to keep up with her fast-paced life, but the degree to which nothing escaped her notice never failed to impress him.
“I’m not

to which I deeply relate.
“The current rules only allow sharing our world with muggles if we’re in intimate relationships. I think we should extend to platonic ones as well.”
Nodding with a wink, “Of course. The sooner we replace the tragedy of your wardrobe, the better.”
Harry’s face fell, and Draco felt compelled to lighten it again. “Don’t give me that kicked-crup face, Potter. I only meant I’m
Draco extracted himself from the indent he’d made in Harry’s couch cushion, stretching as he rose. “It’s bedtime, Potter.”
“Sure,” Harry beamed. “Can we go shopping? After you’re done with work?”
By now, their plates were clear, the bottle of wine almost empty. Harry summoned another bottle, and Draco welcomed the additional alcohol as Harry continued to weave his sad story.
He almost had to laugh at the insanity of it all. Drooling over his schoolboy nemesis when he was meant to be on a Greek Island honeymoon with his wife.
Draco gave Harry a confused stare, but was interrupted before he could say anything by Scorpius remembering people other than Aunt Pansy were in the room.
Draco nodded. Then, with a sudden and unexpected wave of insight, Harry asked, “Do you need a hug, Draco?”
“So, a week,” Simon says.
The reminder of Lavender’s condition stripped the wind out of Draco’s playful banter with Potter.
“Neat?” Baz echoes.
Scorpius, on the other hand, looked between his Aunt Pansy and Harry Potter, torn with the decision.
rabbit hole, “It turns out sharing trauma can forge some pretty deep connections. It was more emotional than anything. I don’t think they did anything more than kiss once or twice. Despite having broken up with Ginny, she did want to end up with me. Only, she wanted the Harry who left. Not the Harry who came back.”
Resisting the urge to ask who ‘we’ included, Draco said, “Well, I expect a full tour at a later date, but I regret I came here with some other more important purpose.”
joked back, that I already had a second me: you.”
Ultimately, Draco won the battle, though it’d cost him a hefty pledge to Hermione’s house elf charity in return.
“And he doesn’t want you to hire someone else for the job? Someone… with a cleaner record?”
Draco, quite honestly, did not know what to say.
Draco’s stomach sank, but he kept his face neutral. “Of course not.” He tried on a smile. “Glad you’re making friends. Message me tomorrow?”
“We’re invited to the party?” I ask. Simon and I are wearing spare pajamas that hardly seem fit for public consumption; mine’s two inches short and Simon’s one size too small (it’s all I can do not to stare at his arse, which he keeps catching with a wink).
“Oh. That.” The tension drains. “No. I guess not.” Baz tilts his head to the side. “Seems harmless enough. I brought the mirror from the Hampshire house, and you know how haunted that place was. I’m sure it’ll go away eventually. Just, you know. Don’t touch it.”
“Hi,” Draco said. There. That’d do.
And then, the funniest thing happened. Harry visualized the potential barrage of headlines and realized: he didn’t care. At all. Weeks of waking up in a cold sweat, wondering if he was doing the right thing. Avoiding Hermione’s perceptive eye. Hoping no one noticed he was falling apart.
Draco froze. He didn’t care about Harry’s answer. Really, he didn’t.
I suppose it’s never good being the Chosen One. That should have been the main clue Smith-Richards wasn’t one. He wanted it too much. The spotlight. The followers. For him, there was no downside. That’s what I’ll look for. The next time a pseudo-Chosen shows up. I’ll look for the parts of their life that have been ruined because of it. Then I’ll know.
“If he looks at his roommate’s arse one more time,” Baz growls.
Draco leaned back in his chair, wishing to hell and back that today wasn’t a full moon. He knew Lavender would be back tomorrow, but he needed her
“Wait,” Harry repeated, drawing Draco’s full body into his arms. Nuzzling the silken blond strands with his nose, “Draco, I want to do something first.”
Draco could relate to that. “What eventually broke the cycle?”
Draco thought. But he ceded the point. It was a good one, and Draco appreciated that Hermione sometimes forgot the time when everyone on the right side of the war, and not a small number on the wrong, rooted for Draco Malfoy to fail.
“Oh! Oh, yeah. I mean, I can get them surgically removed but it’s not easy. The wings have extra sockets or something? And the tail comes straight from my spine.”
“Your mother will be by shortly to take you back home,” Draco winced at the last word and hoped Scorpius didn’t notice. “Is there anything you’d like to do before then?”
[HJP]
“Like, died.
Harry furrows his eyebrows, then they release when it hits him. “Oh! I see it now.”
“But after Voldemort died, people were so focused on moving forward that they stopped to remember a) the whole wizarding world had just experienced a significant trauma and b) Voldemort was the symptom, not the cause, of many of the issues that led to the war.
Giving his scar a little nip, “About the fact we can see into some random bedroom through our mirror.”
He peaks around the corner of Harry and Draco’s bathroom with a sheepish grin. “Saw your hair, didn’t ya?”
“Salazar, you may become a Slytherin yet,” Draco said.
Astoria patted Scorpius on the back, but the boy didn’t let up an inch. Sighing, she walked with her new Scorpius-shaped growth to the kitchen table. “Chocolate chip waffles?” She observed. “Trying to steal him away from me with sugary breakfasts?”
He cursed himself. Laid aside for so many years, Draco’s best sword still knew exactly how to pierce the weakest part of Harry’s armour.
“I killed my father,” I add in a soft voice.
Harry gave Draco a crooked smile, and led the way into his home. Harry Potter’s home. That Draco was now visiting. To distract himself from the continued roller coaster of Draco’s week, as well as the view he had walking behind Harry into the house, Draco babbled.
“You see,” Harry explained. “This is my preferred method of greeting Malfoys.”
“Do I really?” Draco hadn’t noticed, but, once again, Hermione’s perception.
Draco cleared his throat and extricated himself from the bed with the precision of a well-sharpened knife. He began gathering his clothes with haste, and Harry couldn’t stand it.
this real?”
Enjoy this fun and flirty exchange of backstory! This chapter was one of the first parts of this story that I wrote, so I'm excited to finally connect it to the whole (yes, I've been living with the secret of Harry+Luna+threesomes this whole time).

“You’re friends with Harry Potter?” Scorpius asked, and the kid finally looked Draco in the eyes. Stamping down the injustice he felt at this small act, Draco was definitely not thinking about how Emil might have reacted in this situation (because if Draco
, Pansy? We took Scorpius to Hogsmeade to give him a leg up on his future Hogwarts friends. It wasn’t some hot date. I didn’t even take him to Madam Puddifoot’s,” He tried joking.

Ok, hands off the keyboard, that's all I've got! Thanks again for reading along with me. Now I'm off to find my own Tyre... omg I love him so much how will I ever write another fic without him????
I wiggle in the ropes while our captors debate what to do with us. “I think I like this.”
“I can multitask,” Harry said with a mouthful of bread.
Draco finally looks away from the wall. “Hard not to, with his fangs in my face.”
This chapter is dedicated to
Then, the scarred roommate enters.
He looks over at Draco who’s managed to rally long enough to pour more whiskey in his glass.
Most of the time, Harry acted like a soft uncle, with his baggy jumpers, unflattering jeans, and bed-rumpled hair. A less haggard version of Remus Lupin. But here, today, Draco could see the depth of pain and resilience that had allowed a seventeen-year-old boy to win over ostensibly the most powerful dark wizard ever to live. Draco shuddered in the gaze of such intensity, and wanted to surrender.
Draco gave Pansy his best, ‘Shut that moron up’ glare before burying his nose in coffee once more.
Draco spent the rest of the day in a haze. Thankfully, Hermione got caught in meeting after meeting, leaving Draco to tackle reorganization projects he’d been keeping on hold. As he labeled folders, filed paper, and vanished old documents, Draco thought about what Harry had said.
Exactly what he didn’t need this morning. Draco crumpled up the note, then hit it with a burst of Incendio, making Winifred hoot in fear. Sighing, Draco stroked the eagle owl until she forgave him for the sudden outburst.
Draco’s eyebrows shot to his hairline. “What?”
Blinking, “We’ll unpack all that later. How about we put you and your boyfriend to sleep?” Harry says.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed.
“Thanks, Draco.” She fixed him with a piercing gaze. “You sure you’re ok to work today?”
Baz’s eyebrows furrow, reflected in the mirror. “How come?” He takes the black spade tip between his index finger and thumb, stroking gently.
We finally learn the truth of 'The Wrong Sider' (the fictional book, not this story).
Thanks again for taking this journey with me. I may have said it before but this fic is 100% wish fulfillment, written only for myself, and I'm so glad you guys all wanted to see the same weird shit I did! Drarry is so fun to write but SnowBaz will always hold my heart.
Swallowing, Draco took on the role of voice of reason. “No, I think we were discussing The Prophet trying to out Potter’s and my illicit and fictitious relationship.”
“So,” Simon coughs. “Not good, huh?”
“Sorry! So sorry,” He stammered. Bringing the last coffee to her desk, he looked down and realized he was wearing shoes from two different pairs. He sighed.
“Ah hah!” Simon exclaims. Poking Baz in the side. “Told ya.”
certainly knew how to answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco stifled the laugh rising up from his stomach. “Oh, Mother. You sound quite aggrieved.”
“And some chips,” Malfoy slurred.
With a sigh, Harry walks over to Draco’s bed. He curls back the sheets and coaxes Draco under them with a few murmured words. Draco nuzzles into the pillow, the harsh lines of his face relaxed. Like he’s once again in flight. Harry gently brushes a stray lock of blond behind Draco’s ear, then pulls the covers up around his neck. Tucks the sheets tightly around him.
Raising one finger, Harry summoned the bartender. “Two bottles of the 1369 Goblin Vintage,” Harry instructed. “Send it up to the honeymoon suite.” Then, on second thought, “Discreetly, please.”
“Thank Astoria. She’s the one who gave me the revised recipe,” Draco said. “Her lab is really producing great work, thanks to their muggle pharmaceutical partners. With your help in the study, she’s hoping to roll out a public version in a few months.”
Seconds after Draco side-alonged Scorpius to Grimmauld Place, Harry appeared, again throwing off his invisibility cloak dramatically, this time to impress Scorpius.
All I know is that we are completely, utterly fucked.
And what did it matter now, where Harry lost his virginity? Since Ginny had run away?
“Stop with the martyr act, Draco. You’ve more than made up for your part. Plus,” She waved her copy of ‘The Wrong Sider’ in the air. “With this new perspective, I’m sure a lot of wizards and witches will begin to rethink their post-war prejudices.”
It took several more glasses of wine before Draco could be coaxed out of his bingo-induced sulk. By then, Astoria had moved back to her original manipulation: Scorpius and the
and you have yet to feed me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Because he’d never been one to stop while behind, Harry was the first to try again. “So, uh. He likes ‘The Wrong Sider’?”
“I mean,” Harry added, not willing to cease his teasing. “You said yourself you’re not ambitious anymore, you aren’t nearly pretentious enough to be a Ravenclaw, and I’m pretty sure you’d hex me if I implied any Lion-esque traits. That leaves only one house remaining.”
It's so good to finally feel
“Mr. Potter,” Mother started.
“Now, when were you thinking of having the press conference?” Pansy asked.
“No, you moron. You!” Huffing, Draco muttered, “Moron.” He found the insults slightly grounding. Maybe that was what this evening needed. A reprisal of schoolyard taunts. That’d be a mature way to react as a 32-year-old man.
“No,” Draco admitted. “It makes perfect sense. And if I could call Ginevra Weasley one thing, it’d be resilient.”
“That’s more like it,” Lavender replied, sweeping her hair over her shoulder. “Now,” She flicked her wand, sending a beacon down the hallway. “I’ve just summoned facilities to help construct your new office. Any requests?”
“That
Draco looks up from the textbook he’s studying on his bed. Harry holds up two bottles of liquor in one hand, a six-pack of beer in the other.
Simon nods.
“What
Yes, you heard it folks. I'm writing an epilogue. It'll be short, sweet, and mostly involve brunch at Lady Ruth's house. Totally up to you if you skip it <3 should be up in a day or so (or tonight if I can get my shit together).
“What do you think?” He asked.
“Oh good, he’s back,” Draco slow-clapped. “Are you done regretting choices you can’t change?”
“Of course, Ron was furious. I didn’t have the heart to tell him about Neville, so he thought
The Headmistress leans back in her chair with a sigh. “You’ll have to forgive Mr Potter. Up until now, he has had an undeserved and inappropriately adult role placed on him. Not unlike the one you were forced to play, Mr Snow, if I can be so presumptuous. But he is a good man. You are lucky to have found yourself in his bedroom, of all possibilities.”
“I can see how that would help,” Draco said, thinking of the kind words Harry bestowed on him earlier. “Harry’s approval has a tendency to buoy one’s self-esteem a bit.”
Draco was certain he’d stopped breathing. It hadn’t been something as simple as a birthday cake, but the feeling of injustice the book described… he’d felt that. Continued to feel that, just like Emil.
“Draco, you should really read the book,” Ron said, giving his best parental ‘it’s for your own good’ face.
“He basically asked me if being perfectly content in my job was all I wanted, or if I’m actually just afraid of failure.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, trying to retrieve his arm from Harry’s grasp.
Draco shrugged. “Your last answer covered it. Just say, ‘Asked and answered’ if you feel like they’re beating a dead dragon.”
This is going to hurt to admit. I look at the roommate, the man with the scarred forehead, and feel a pang of sympathy. “Remember when I thought I hated you?” Wincing internally at my own lack of self-awareness, “I used to make that same face when you slicked your hair back.” My tail snakes over my leg and onto Baz’s.
Draco cursed under his breath.
“Draco,” Pansy sounded breathless. “I don’t know… I can’t remember…” She took a large gulp of mimosa. “That story wasn’t in the book I read.”
I sigh, pinching my nose. I can’t stay mad at him, the sentimental fool. “You’re in charge of untangling it,” I point.
With every ounce of disdain, Draco shoved Harry Potter aside with his elbow and stomped to a corner booth. “I am
“Is your food bad? Why do you look sick? Ron. Ron!” Still, the Weasel wouldn’t look at Draco.
. “You’re basically one of the best things to ever happen to Hermione’s career. And they do actually like you, you know. They’ve been begging me to hang out with the three of you for ages.”
TW: Brief mentions of conversation therapy.
“But you were a hero,” Draco said.
Draco snatched back the food. “
“Will you visit me soon, Grandmother?” Scorpius asked, his eyes wide and almost fearful. “Even if I’m at my mother’s?”
“Oh, hello, Mother. I didn’t see you there,” Draco breathed.
That being said, he was looking forward to lunch in a way he hadn’t in years. Draco loved his job, but endless conversations about the book put him in a real mood. Especially when people seemed convinced that
Draco nodded, not surprised that Ron worked late at Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes. Administrative roles at the Ministry typically ran 8 to 5, but stores on Diagon were open 10 to 7, meaning Ron took the morning shift with Hugo and Rose, while Hermione took the evening shift. It meant Hermione often had to work from home in the evenings to accomplish all the goals she’d set for herself in the day, but she confessed that she did her best drafting and revising while curled up next to her husband. It was the kind of family routine Draco might envy, if he thought about it long enough.
Harry shifted his gaze to his feet. Draco’s pondering of this uncharacteristic shy display was interrupted by a tug on his sleeve.
much taller.”
And Draco didn’t push. Didn’t pry out the details he was dying to know. What had happened to the Boy Who Lived Twice? Why had he dropped out of the wizarding world?
After dinner, the boys ran back out to the pitch, leaving Harry and Draco on the sidelines, stuck with the arduous task of drafting the actual statement. In many ways, the resulting battle over phrasing and figures of speech reminded Draco of the fights they waged as schoolboys over much more serious topics. However, as an adult the arguments invigorated Draco rather than draining him. From the energy Harry demonstrated while striking back, Draco assumed the same went for him.
“How did the author know?” Draco asked.
“Come with me to the next Gryffindor pub night.”
Shit. He’d forgotten about the other days of the week. And like so many of the targets Granger-Weasley set in her sight, he folded. “I’ll be there.”
“Oh,” Harry blushed. “Noticed that, did you?”
Harry had always needed but had been too afraid to want.
“As if we have secrets left,” Simon jokes, pushing Draco over to settle with him on the bed.
Scorpius snickered, his hand over his mouth as if trying to hide his laugh.
“How Blaise and G-Ginny knew each other.” Harry hoped the crack in his voice at Ginny’s name went unnoticed. The way Malfoy downed his ouzo after Harry’s statement left him with the impression that Malfoy had fallen too deep in his own sorrow to notice Harry’s.
The elf suddenly noticed Draco, and fell into an even deeper bow. “Master Draco! What a pleasure to welcome you back to the most Ancient and Noble House of Black. Kreacher wishes to offer a belated congratulations on your siring an heir. Kreacher must wish you and Master Scorpius many long and happy years of life.”
Holding up a hand, “I obviously don’t feel that way now. Only, it speaks to my mental state at the time. I was in no place to be a boyfriend. I couldn’t comfort Ginny in her loss. I couldn’t even feel my own. At least, beyond the most obvious one.
Harry shrugged. “Once I became more myself again, I realized that I still shared many of my pre-war dreams. Not being an Auror, obviously. But wanting a family. Wanting stability.”
Draco pulled his arm back. “I don’t know if I’d call myself happy.”
“She didn’t know,” I squeeze his hand so hard that, without vampire strength, I think it’d break. I’m sending all the love I have through the gesture, hoping that works, like when I could share my magic. “She didn’t know how good it could be, being like you.”
“I can’t look away. It’s like a train wreck I’ve survived but can’t stop reliving.”
“Ok,” Draco mumbled into Harry’s neck. “Whatever you want,” He gulped. “It’s yours.”
Shaking his head, “What about what he wants? Huh? Did you think about
(See the end of the chapter for
Do I now want to own a Tyre II?
Draco pulled back from Scorpius’s embrace, leaving his hands on the boy's shoulders. “You know I love you, right?”
“I know,” Draco breathed. “I used to visit here as a child. Does it still have that awful painting?”
“I was plotting something,” Baz teases. “But definitely not your demise.”
He shuts the fabric tight and casts the spell just as the laughter starts.
“Turns out Ginny wasn’t exactly faithful while I was gone.” Harry paused, then answered the question Draco didn’t ask. “Neville.”

Draco resisted the urge to reach out and take Harry’s hand. “You don’t have to answer; not if you don’t want to.”
A short, sweet epilogue with a visit to Lady Ruth's house.
Harry turned, and walked to the penthouse door.
The wake of Harry's press conference, and Draco finally attends the Gryffindor Pub Night.
“Of course it does,” Draco laughed. “Harry, do you have any gay friends?”
This pause allowed an even deeper melancholy to settle. Draco could tell that, greater than Ginny’s betrayal, feeling abandoned by Ron and Hermione had cut him deeper. Like a good friend, Harry didn’t elaborate on that heartache, but Draco felt it.
Astoria fixed him with a probing gaze, then leaned over to take his hand in hers. “I’m really proud of you, Draco. You’ve come a long way from the man who spent his midday break cowering in the Ministry Owlery, too afraid to eat lunch in the cafeteria.”
and his
Growling, “You said it was perfect.”
Malfoy hummed noncommittally and raised a finger to the bartender who obliged him with another shot. He’d long ago stopped trying to use his translation charm to order drinks. Body language worked fine, and it didn’t require the coordination of being sober.
“I never thought I’d see the day when Draco Malfoy drank boxed wine out of plastic,” Harry teased into Draco’s ear, his arm on Draco’s shoulder.
Scorpius’s eyes lit up. “Whoa! That was fast!”
“Probably both,” She admitted with a smile before continuing. “And it just so happened Ron was watching this muggle television show I introduced him to, ‘The West Wing’, when it dawned on me: their presidents and vice presidents had whole teams of people to enact their legislative goals. So while you were out on Friday, I put together a proposal.”
A few spells later, and Draco and Hermione sipped from their office cups. He used his ‘Lord of the Manor’ mug from Pansy, a rather sick gift if he thought about it for too long, which he didn’t normally. Hermione picked her ‘Be the Leslie Knope of Whatever You Do’ mug that Draco bought her for Christmas.
“Potter.”
who said Luna deserves better and, you know what, I agree! I hope I've given her part in this story a good ending.
“I do,” He said, his face expressing his lack of comprehension.
“Oh! The wine isn’t poisoned, I just didn’t eat lunch!” Draco exclaimed.
Harry let Draco catch his breath, then struck again. “And what about Scorpius?”
,” Lavender shook her head, amused despite herself. “And you’ll want to be nicer to me, considering I’m placing the request to create your new office.”
Before Draco had a chance to appreciate the pride in Scorpius’s face at that observation, Harry called out, “Draco! Scorpius! Touch the beans!”
lost so many people. And Ginny? I mean, she lost Fred. They were really close, you know. I think,” He ran a hand through his hair. “I think she expected a hero to return, and that’s not who I was at the end.”
, Harry. It’s called coaching,” Draco grinned.
She frowned. “Tomorrow then.”
When the last Bingo had been called, Draco excused himself from the table to use the restroom. Returning, he saw Harry in deep conversation with a stranger. A very attractive stranger.
with Potter.” Only Draco’s sentence took more time, and the extra words hung in the room like a bubble ready to pop.
It wasn’t working.
“Pansy Parkinson, where are you?” He stormed into her living room, leaving the leftover powder on his second day outfit, not caring for his appearance.
“What’s a Portkey?” Scorpius asked. Astoria lived mostly muggle these days, and hadn’t introduced Scorpius to all of the wizarding ways of travel.
Draco laughed. “Still bitter about the newsletter?”
“I’m going to cast a sobriety charm,” Harry panted.
and Harry’s mind went blank.
“He means you, of course,” Draco said, sipping his butterbeer.
“You did, didn’t you? You got all Slytherin and conspire-y and you turned a nice night of me drinking and forgetting my troubles into some Potter-themed plot.” Draco whined, over-pronouncing the ‘p’s. “But what I don’t understand is
Harry’s mouth opened and closed. Then opened, “What arrangement?”
“Luna,” Harry grinned.
“Huh. Mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, buttered noodles, dinosaur chicken nuggets, and about every type of chocolate dessert invented. Can’t say I’ve ever seen such a bizarre selection from Kreacher before,” Harry observed.
Draco shuddered an exhale. “Then I hope you don’t mind that I plan to take my time.”
[HJP]
With his heart exposed, Draco could no longer resist denying himself what he had long sought. Not when the snitch glittered tantalizingly close. Turning to face Harry, Draco’s mind cleared as he raised one hand to the side of Harry’s head, cupping the stubbled cheek in his palm. Harry nuzzled into the touch, releasing a pleasured sigh that spiked Draco’s arousal. But Draco wasn’t ready to finish the game so soon.
The sly compliment cracked open the door Draco had endeavored for years to keep shut. “I detected that my invitation missed a key element,” Draco said, holding the parchment to his chest.
“It has, hasn’t it?” Draco smiled back. It occurred to him suddenly that he’d been allowing himself more than his weekly allotted extreme expressions lately. It occurred to him that maybe he didn’t care.
heart.” Harry paused to shrug. “Maybe I had, despite everything. In any case, Hermione was dealing with restoring her parents’ memories so she and Ron went to Australia, and left me behind.”
Harry cleared his throat, but the next words sounded rough despite the action, “I guess, in that situation, I’d rather you Polyjuice into me.”
Magic in this world is
“You went
Draco pulled out the charm, security lock releasing in an instant, almost throwing the two men to the floor. Harry managed to catch Draco merely inches from the ground.
“No!” Draco exclaimed. “Why would I— that’s absurd. That’s a preposterous supposition.”
to suck his cock, Draco will be in a much better mood once he’s had his rant.”
The man looked so troubled, Draco took pity on him, regardless of poor manners. “It’s all right,” He closed his book and sat up. “Your presence is actually a relief.”
With a small smile, Harry pours himself a finger or two. Passes the bottle over to me.
Then again, maybe the solution to dealing with chaos was introducing more.
The not-so-surprising revelation! Finally! Whew, this chapter isn't even all that long, but it feels like a lot happens.
“Potter,” Pansy breathed. “I’m impressed!” Then, she shook her hair. “And a bit dismayed I’m not the staffer you’ve bribed.”
“And I’ll come visit you at your mother’s next week,” Aunt Pansy added.
For a second, Hermione said nothing. Just stared at Draco, and sniffed? Did she really just smell him? “You’ve been to 12 Grimmauld Place, haven’t you? I can smell Kreacher on you. Oh, I should have seen this coming.” She rubbed her temples. “You let Harry mind-heal you over your lunch break, you poor, poor thing. He brought up Voldemort too, right?”
“No,” Draco stilled the movement of his hips. Grasping Harry’s sides. Draco dug his fingernails up the length of Harry’s body. “Tonight, you’re Potter.”
He nodded.
Draco very politely did not point out how little her story had to do with him, the person with a career crisis, and the one who had actually called this meeting.
Lavender slapped Draco’s arm again. “I can’t believe you took Harry Potter to a drag show before you took me! ”
Hermione sighed. “Please shut the door, Draco.”
He cleared his throat and attempted speech. “Hogwarts. During the war.”
“So,” Draco said, breaking his life-altering reflection. “What’s this decision you need to make?”
Which was a good idea, Harry thought, so he repeated Malfoy’s words to secure the order. He’d hardly eaten that day. Too nervous. Harry suppressed another laugh at the irony of
Steps sounded down the hallway, and Draco dropped his hand from Harry’s.
“Right,” Harry nodded back. “I never intended the break to be permanent.” He laughed. “Seems a bit shit now, to think I had the right to press ‘pause’ on our relationship without first consulting her, but I knew our connection would put her in danger. To be fair, she didn’t really fight me on it. She knew I had a mission, even if she didn’t know what the mission was, and she wanted me to be successful.”
“Harry Potter!” A voice called out, and Harry’s face (his real face) drained of blood.
“They can write the books when we’re done making history.” Hermione waved her hand in the air, dismissing the idea she’d ever need the help of a Ravenclaw.
Lavender’s CL buzzed, and she examined its message with a curse. “Shacklebolt needs me. Tell Hermione she can see him at 9:30, yeah?” She placed her hand on the door, and turned her head back. “And don’t think we won’t discuss this Harry Potter development.” Then, from the hallway, “And you owe me a drag show!”
Just like that, Harry moved on. But Draco didn’t.
Smirking, “Sorry, left him with
, as if sharing the burden had lessened it somehow. Circe, could one turn Hufflepuff from too many hugs?
Grinning, “I’ll do you one better.
Draco raised one eyebrow. “Are we stating our addresses for fun now? Should I join? Mine’s not as catchy, but I don’t like being left out.”
Before Harry could respond, Teddy and Scorpius dropped out of the sky onto the grass in front of them.
He raised an eyebrow. Lavender’s jaw dropped.
“You know,” Draco slurred, “I would have donated to SPEW even without our agreement.” He smiled, clearly relishing this one win on what had to have been one of the worst days of his life.
“So I’m second fiddle now, aren’t I?” Harry added, relaxing somewhat, despite the extreme violation of his privacy now set to occur. “I defied death for the Wizarding World, twice, and I’m in second place in Scorpius’s affections after
A flash of red tints Draco’s ears but it’s hard to catch it when he leans over to pull a handful of rocks from his bedside table.
“You wouldn’t be the first,” Draco said, then eyed his glass of wine, as if
“Of course,” He smiled back.
“Oh Godric,” Harry laughed. “How did I ever doubt he was your son? That expression is the most Draco Malfoy thing I’ve ever seen.”
“Hmm. Technically, I’m Master of Death, you know,” Harry said, licking a spoonful of pudding in a most obscene manner.
“So. Eighth year?”
son was never so enthusiastic.”
“In a twist worthy of a romance novel, the two jilted lovers were last seen ordering a 2,000 Galleon bottle of wine and retreating to Mr Malfoy’s honeymoon suite.
Raising an eyebrow, “I suppose that’s my cue?”
“And you didn’t tell me?”
go to, but mine require shirts. Even for the Saviour.”
Along the way to Three Broomsticks, the three of them stumbled upon a playground.
“Fine,” Draco sighed, as if it were a struggle to accept Harry’s fondness. “How do you want to do this?”
A shiver runs through Baz’s whole body. “I can’t imagine not being able to go in the sun.”
Hermione sipped her wine, “How’s the visit with Scorpius?”
“Well, it’s a muggle phrase. Basically, it means feeling like you’ve accidentally ended up somewhere you don’t belong. That you’ve misrepresented yourself as someone with more skills than you actually have. In short, you feel like a fraud,” Hermione explained.
“Is popcorn sex food?”
“Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said, striding toward her. “It’s so good to see you again.” Then, took her hand and kissed it in greeting.
“It’s how you used to say his name.
“Mmm. Say that again,” Draco said, closing his eyes.
Also sorry about the cliffhanger, but I need to give y'all a reason to come back, right?
“Do you?” Draco asked, feeling Harry’s walls rise, the distance between them increasing.
Releasing Simon with a sigh, I lean back on my hands. I want to say, ‘It’s not my fault you two can’t get your act together,’ but it’s not my place.
Squaring his shoulders, “You know my family better than anyone, Potter. The rot they subjected me to, that they taught me. You of all people should know the damage I could inflict, if given unparalleled access to the next generation. Just look at my father.”
“Really,” She drawled, crossing her arms across her chest. “Who’s this no one who makes you blush like—oh my stars.”
Harry blushed. “How do you move from arsehole to flirt so quickly without getting whiplash?”
Draco woke up before his alarm, full of dread. He knew this day was coming, had even spent the first half of Scorpius’s visit eagerly wishing for it. But now that it was here, Draco didn’t want to let his son go. And he had absolutely no idea what to do with that feeling.
Steeling himself for the Floo ride to work, he reminded himself that today was Lavender’s turn on the coffee rotation. Come to think of it, maybe
Hermione tapped her finger against her chin. “Yes, but change the world into what? Perhaps we need a Hufflepuff in there to keep us grounded.”
Harry should be annoyed by their constant flirting, but it’s somehow soothing in the dim room with Draco’s warm body inches away from Harry’s. Simon’s tail is once again stroking the inseam of Baz’s pajama leg, red wings pressed against the headboard, Baz’s body pressed fully against Simon.
