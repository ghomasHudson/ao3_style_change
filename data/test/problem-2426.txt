‘Go on,’ Draco urges. ‘Tell me what you’d get me to do for you.’
Draco lets Potter talk until he’s done, the words flowing out of him as if they’d been right on the surface, ready to burst out, for years. He has the feeling that this is the first time Potter has said some of these things out loud, and he wonders why he hasn’t felt able to share them before.
‘I still don’t trust you,’ he said, narrowing his eyes.
‘New father, I’d guess,’ Malfoy said, following Harry’s gaze.
He’s stretched out fully and submerged up to his neck -- thank Merlin Draco insisted on getting a bath big enough for both of them to fit in comfortably -- and he can’t stop his eyes from sliding shut, the water lulling him into a state of complete relaxation.
The discovery of the mug broke the slight awkwardness and uncertainty that had built between them since leaving the cinema, and Draco began to feel more at ease—still jittery, and still desperately hoping to be able to touch Harry again soon, but that faded into a pleasant simmering need, noticeable enough but not so distracting that he couldn’t talk to Harry normally. They didn’t reference what had happened in the cinema as they chatted while Harry made the tea, but it was constantly present, an unspoken tension in the air, Harry’s gaze lingering on Draco for longer than usual, both of them aware of what was building but not yet mentioning it, content to let it take its time to come into bloom.
When Teddy’s attention started to wander, Draco decided it was time they moved on, and they walked slowly across Westminster Bridge, pausing to look over the side at the water below and the boats passing underneath them. Draco had been planning to get Teddy an ice cream and then start the journey home, but as they passed the aquarium Teddy turned to Draco and begged to go in, puppy dog eyes in full effect. Surprisingly unable to say no, unwilling to deny Teddy anything that would mean he enjoyed their time together, Draco led Teddy into the aquarium, once again fumbling slightly with the money—he’d forgotten everything he’d memorised about Muggle currency that morning—and staring blankly when the cashier asked if he wanted to use contactless. Thankfully the cashier was clearly used to tourists who didn’t quite know how many pennies went into a pound, so she kindly helped him, her friendliness sparing more of Draco’s blushes. It was all worth it though, to see the wonder on Teddy’s face as they walked through the aquarium, pausing in front of each tank to look at the huge sharks and colourful fish. Even Draco’s mishap with the lift—he just couldn’t get the door to stop closing and then immediately opening again—couldn’t put a damper on the day.
The more he thinks about it, the angrier he gets. He’s finally made a life for himself outside of Britain, where his past doesn’t hang over him, and now Potter has tracked him down, used his body, stolen his heart, and then destroyed him.
Draco thought that would be it for another ten years. But, as happened far too often for his liking, Harry proved him wrong.
Harry would never have expected it, but they make a good team.
‘Um, yeah, good,’ Harry said, his voice rough.
Potter doesn’t speak as Draco begs, his fingers still idly tracing patterns on Draco’s stomach, but his eyes never leave Draco’s face, and Draco can tell he’s affected. Just when Draco thinks he can’t take much more of this, Potter takes mercy on him, tugging Draco’s joggers down before surging to his feet. Draco’s prick springs free—he never wears boxers beneath joggers, preferring the way the fabric clings to his bare cock—and Potter runs a fingertip through the liquid that’s pooled at its head.
‘Not all night, no. You’re not that interesting,’ he says.
‘Calm down, it’s just me,’ comes a laughing voice.
‘Stop, Malfoy,’ Harry gasped, pulling back as Malfoy looked up at him, confused, his lips swollen, the hand on his prick stilling. ‘Was going to come,’ Harry added in explanation.
‘Or?’
Malfoy cut Harry off with a wave of his hand. ‘Water under the bridge, Potter. Not like I didn’t deserve it.’ And then, when Harry opened his mouth, Malfoy hurriedly kept talking, moving the subject back to his reasons for going into Healing. ‘The main reason, though, I suppose, was that I wanted to do something good. I’d spent so much of my life surrounded by monsters, unable or unwilling to do anything other than what they asked of me, and it sickened me to think of what I’d been involved in. To think about the things I’d done, or nearly done.’
When Potter’s hand wraps around Draco’s prick, it’s all over. With just a few strokes, Draco peaks, his legs stiffening as he shoots over Potter’s fist, stripes of come landing on his own stomach and chest. Draco’s eyes slide shut as he lets the rush of pleasure take him over, Potter still fucking him, his hand wringing the final gasps of Draco’s orgasm from him.
‘So far, yes.’ Draco nodded, caught off guard by the way Harry was looking so intently at him. ‘Minus a few incidents with Muggle technology anyway,’ he added with a slightly awkward chuckle which he immediately hated himself for.
Winter was here in earnest now, the sky darkening even as Draco served the last of the lunchtime rush, his customer numbers dwindling as the weather got bitingly cold and people began to hibernate in their homes and offices, subsisting on poor coffee rather than venture out into the cold. The weather never seemed to put Harry off though. He still turned up several times a week, wrapped up tightly in a surprisingly fashionable coat and scarf, the feeling of the edges of his warming charm making Draco’s skin tingle. Draco was torn between wishing Muggles were able to cast warming charms so that they too would keep coming to his cafe - winter was always a harder time for the cafe with far less passing trade - and grateful that the lack of customers meant his conversations with Harry went uninterrupted.
‘And you like—you like what you do?’
‘And how is your hip feeling? Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort?’ Malfoy asked without looking up from Harry’s chart.
‘Do yours, Draco!’ Teddy had come back up to them, and stood looking expectantly at Draco, while Harry’s stag continued to dance behind him.
‘Well,’ Potter says, one hand on the door knob, his clothes neater but his hair still a rumpled mess that immediately gives away what they’ve been doing. ‘Thank you, I suppose.’
‘Why have you been cancelling your appointments, Draco?’ Pansy says softly. ‘Did something happen?’
‘Yes?’
‘Well, far be it for me to stop the Chosen One drinking his coffee where he chooses,’ Draco said, giving a mock bow.
‘Are you sure about that?’ Harry had a glint in his eye that made Draco’s stomach flip over.
‘What?’ he pressed, knowing somehow that Malfoy was keeping something back.
Malfoy was wearing a white shirt again, the top buttons undone to give Harry a tantalising glimpse of his chest, and that was just too much for Harry to take. Blood was pounding through his veins, a dangerous mix of anger and arousal, and Harry rounded on Malfoy, backing him up until his body was pressed against the wall. There was no trace of fear on Malfoy’s face though, instead a wicked smile and a look in his eyes that suggested he knew exactly what Harry was about to do.
Once they had done as requested, Harry quickly stripped off his clothes, his butterflies returning with a vengeance at just the thought of being in his boxers in the same room as Draco. He put on the dress robes, the fiddly buttons taking a few minutes to do up, before turning to the mirrors and clearing his throat to let Millie know he was ready. Millie immediately moved over and began fussing with the fabric, shifting it around and adjusting where it sat on Harry’s shoulders, a tape measure appearing from nowhere to measure the length of his arm and his waist, but Harry barely noticed any of it. He couldn’t drag his attention away from Draco, who was staring at Harry, his eyes slowly, leisurely trailing down Harry’s body, Harry’s nerves alighting wherever Draco’s gaze touched. Draco’s mouth was slightly open, as if in shock, and his pupils were wide, the heat in them making Harry’s blood boil. Draco had clearly not noticed Harry looking, and Harry found himself wondering whether he’d missed gazes like this before. He’d only just had his eyes opened to the possibility of an attraction between them, but had Draco been aware of it for much, much longer?
‘Yes. I remember it vividly—you don’t forget this feeling, after all.’ Harry nodded in agreement at that. ‘I remember my father telling me that he had brought me here to show me why we had to look out for ourselves, to protect ourselves and our heritage from Muggles and others who would want to destroy us. I hate that framing of it now—we can protect magic without hating Muggles—but at the time it was what all pure-blood children were told.’
‘You knew what it was,’ Harry couldn’t resist shooting back, even as he thought to himself that right now, on his knees with swollen lips, Malfoy looked like he certainly knew a lot about sex at least.
Draco tried to return his focus to work - there was always plenty to do, even when he wasn’t serving customers - but he couldn’t stop his eyes from drifting back over to where Harry was sat every few minutes, as if to check whether he was still there. He found himself wiping down tables near Harry, just as an excuse to get a bit closer and get a better view. He peered surreptitiously over at Harry as he cleared dirty mugs off the nearest table, craning his neck to get a glimpse of the front cover of Harry’s book. He was inordinately curious to know what exactly was capturing Harry’s attention so well, and his interest only grew when he discovered that Harry was reading
‘It’ll be good for Healer Malfoy, too, to have a break from so much overtime,’ Esther said. ‘He’s looking exhausted, poor man.’
Potter’s hips are moving fast now, his strokes hard and perfect, and it’s everything Draco ever wanted. And when Potter shifts, his arms coming to bracket Draco’s and his chest pressing hot against Draco’s back, Draco can’t stop himself closing his eyes and letting himself imagine just for a minute that there’s no money involved in this, that it’s real rather than just a transaction. When Potter drops a kiss against Draco’s shoulder blade, Draco can’t hold back a moan. Potter seems to notice, because he does it again, and again, and then he’s nuzzling into Draco’s bared neck, kissing and licking and sucking and it’s driving Draco crazy, pulling him higher and higher into bliss.
‘And your mum?’ Harry said after a moment. ‘Is she okay?’ Harry hadn’t forgotten what Narcissa did for him, and on multiple occasions over the years he’d sat down to write to her, always shying away from sending the letter at the last minute.
It’s so good, after Potter’s endless teasing, and Draco wants more. He drops his head onto his hands and arches his back, showing Potter how much he wants this. Potter takes the hint, and suddenly his fingers are slippery with lube, the crackle of magic hanging in the air from his spell. Draco’s always loved the sensation of magic, and Potter’s spell is so powerful that the lingering magic skitters along Draco’s skin, goosebumps appearing in its wake.
‘I suppose the right person would be…’ Draco tried to think. What could he say that wasn’t just
Malfoy was watching Harry closely, nodding and making quiet noises to show he was still listening. It was the most Harry had talked, or even really thought, about the period immediately after the war in a long time. He preferred to leave those memories locked away, buried deep away from view. But there was something about Malfoy, maybe his own openness when talking about his decision to become a Healer, that made Harry feel like he could talk about it.
‘The speeches are over, it’s time to dance,’ Draco said, voice low so as to not be overheard by the nearby couples. ‘You do know how to dance, yes?’
‘About your nightmare.’ When Harry didn’t immediately say anything, Malfoy continued, ‘I always found it helped, to talk about them. Made them feel less real, somehow.’
‘You don’t do anything? At all?’ Draco was surprised - Harry had never seemed the type to enjoy swanning around leisurely. He had always given off the air of constantly needing to be doing something, ideally something that helped people. Last Draco had heard, admittedly years ago, was that Harry had joined the Aurors and was steadily making his way through the ranks.
In the final chapter, Draco is given his verdict, a confiscation of much of his wealth and a probation period of six months. He apologizes to Hermione in the hospital for his past mistreatment of her, and after completely recovering from his physical injuries, he confesses his feelings to Harry and kisses him farewell.
"Yes," Malfoy said, much too blandly for a situation like this. He snapped his fingers and the lights went out.
A dream memory from the second chapter in the train:
In the video was a dim room set golden and alight, a study light somewhere off to the side on the desk. There was Draco drawing his hand away from the lens of the camera, scooting a little back on the chair.
Malfoy's fingers moved slightly, so that Harry's slipped between his, loose and curling a little more. Harry liked the hum between them, piquant and warm and jangling up the nerves of his arm, the way it cocooned around his heart, shivered down his spine.
"Draco."
Harry's brain snagged on the 'our room'. "Did you share your room with somebody?"
He knew the way Draco looked, coming up to Harry when he was either bored or wanting it. He would always have this edge of a smirk at one corner of his mouth, stepping forward into his space, crowding him in, or pulling at Harry to crowd
"Nothing borne of pity is real."
So Harry told him all of it, about the curse, the way it was incinerating through him. His voice was raspy and scratchy as he did, throat dry from disuse, and still, he felt outside of himself, hearing himself tell it all to Draco.
Draco doesn't say anything. He wishes he hadn't said anything at all.
Luna's going on about Blibbering Humdingers, whatever those are. Draco walks alongside her on the grounds of Hogwarts, humming in acknowledgment and interjecting every now and then. Giving a proper verbal response would surely require understanding much of what she's saying.
Madam Pomfrey raises an eyebrow, pushing him down with one hand. His head is spinning again. He clenches his eyes shut, trying to make it stop. "I don't believe you have much of a choice, young man, seeing as you can hardly get up of your own accord."
Harry watched him for a moment, sitting alone on his own, an empty chair next to him. He was tugging out his Eighth-Year Potions book from his satchel, thin fingers wrapping around the spine of it.

The only consequence Malfoy got was confiscation of most of their family wealth and to return to Hogwarts as a part of his agreement. His mother was placed on House Arrest under supervision of Aurors.
," Harry says, the word a slow, considering stretch. "But strange anyway."
Harry's brain hits a barricade, goes blank. He's just staring at Neville, his brows twitching.
"It was a pathetic attempt at a chance to see you again," Draco said quietly. "I thought I was dying, and I just wanted to see you one last time."
, let him sense the disintegration of his core underneath until he could fully string together the entirety of it. She was saying, "Mr. Potter, your husband is very ill. His core is burning out due to high levels of unstable magic — a fraction of it already has — and I'm afraid there isn't much that can be done."
Narcissa asks him to stay for a few more days, verging on a plea,
"Overly saccharine," Draco dismissed.
Malfoy waited a few seconds. When Harry didn't oblige, he turned and made his way over to the bar across the room. His hair was tucked behind his ears, only just reached the wrap of his black, woollen rollneck. "What do you like to drink?"
They'd thought, at first, that they could just grip each other's arms as a minor form of their necessitated contact, the tangle of it laid out on a surface. It was still awkward, but much less awkward. It was unsatisfactory in comparison, and even though they'd remained like that for an hour, Harry was left with a discontented sort of feeling, wondering if it was just him, but insisted to himself that it was far better this way.
"How'd you manage it? Getting Potter fooled enough to take your side?" Smith snarls. There's a girl beside him, another Hufflepuff, touching his bicep and trying to steer him away, murmuring,
It was a few seconds more before Harry could bring himself to say, "Okay."
signed at the bottom. In his owl cage, where he still hasn't gotten himself another owl. There are empty spaces in the hollows of Harry's heart.
"You've changed a lot," Harry said, staring up at the expanse of the night sky. He understood a lot of the Malfoy he used to be, even if, in Malfoy's own words, it didn't justify or excuse his actions now. "You're still a git, but you're not… a
And then it's quiet, the two of them staring at each other. Potter's grin fades into a quirk at one corner of his lip, a glimpse of teeth between the teetering smile of his lips, his face fixed in an odd and studious little expression.
Harry told him about the time he accidentally blew up his Aunt Marge. Draco stared at him, slightly wide-eyed. Harry shrugged.
"I'm sorry," Draco murmurs to him, when he breaks away.
All can do is stare up at the ceiling, blurry-eyed. Talking about him, even if they don't say his name, stings all his sensitive, chaffed nerves, grief sinking heavy as a boulder on his sternum.
Malfoy’s pace slowed down even further as he looked intently at Harry, his expression thoughtful. ‘Now I’m not so sure. I’ve not had much luck in love myself, but there’s a part of me that has hope that one day I’ll get to experience a better kind of love.’
‘I’m going to the Burrow,’ Ginny said, cutting into Harry’s internal crisis about the depth of his feelings for Malfoy. ‘I can’t share you, Harry. I’m glad Malfoy saved your life, but if you love him, if you don’t love me anymore, then I can’t do this. I’ll come back later tomorrow, but before I do, you need to decide what, and
‘Any hints that she was involved in—’ Harry broke off, suddenly unsure. This was shaky ground for them.
By unspoken agreement, neither of them mentioned what had happened in Millie’s shop the next day. Their interactions for the first hour of the day were slightly stilted, tender, uncertain, as they tried to carefully tiptoe around the new dynamic between them. Harry was beginning to worry, scared that he had ruined a valuable friendship, but then they got swept up in work, and as they discussed potential theories on their latest case, the tension melted away. Harry couldn’t completely ignore the new dynamic between them, but over the following few days he grew used to it, and found himself enjoying the excitement and nerves of having a crush, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. He didn’t feel the need to do anything about it; it was enough to simply spend time in the same place as Draco, occasionally catching his eye and letting the butterflies fill his stomach, returning home every evening with a mind full of Draco and nothing else, each night drifting off to sleep to imagined scenarios of Draco in bed next to him.
‘There’s really nothing else we can do?’ Harry asked in a last gasp attempt at reprieve.
Thorebourne had noticed Harry’s acceleration and was quickly gaining on Harry, the nose of her broom inching into Harry’s peripheral vision. Harry was pushing his broom, and his body, as far as they could go, but he was slowly losing the advantage of his headstart. Thorebourne was a relative unknown, having only joined the Bats the previous season, but she was fast and agile, and Harry was beginning to realise that he’d underestimated her. He dragged his focus back to the Snitch, trying to ignore Thorebourne’s broom as it got ever closer. Losing the Snitch now, when the score was so close and the outcome of the game rested on his shoulders, would be agonising. He was determined he wouldn’t be responsible for Puddlemere losing the opening game of the season.
‘About an hour. I’ve had an initial scout of the house—’
‘I would like that very much,’ Draco says, not even trying to stop the smile that spreads across his face.
‘And keep an eye on that ferrety bastard!’ Ron added over his shoulder as he and Hermione left, leaving Harry laughing even as it made his ribs ache.
Malfoy held out a hand, hauling Harry up to standing, but then to Harry’s great relief, he didn’t let go, instead shifting so that they were holding hands. It should have felt strange—Harry hadn’t held hands with anyone but Ginny in over a decade—but it didn’t. He told himself it was just because the pain, and the relief of it fading slightly, was distorting his brain.
Harry just laughed in response, and Draco couldn’t stop a smile sneaking on to his face. Making Harry laugh had set butterflies wild in his stomach, and he had a sudden inexplicable and incredibly out of character urge to start cracking jokes or pulling silly faces in an attempt to get Harry to laugh again. To avoid making a complete fool of himself, Draco hurriedly returned to cleaning up the cafe, getting everything in order so he could leave as soon as Harry had finished his drink. He already knew he would spend the evening driving himself crazy replaying the memory Harry laughing over and over, wishing he was in a position to make Harry laugh like that every day.
‘I bet you are,’ Potter says after a beat, and his finger slides down to Draco’s arsehole again before pressing in slightly.
Draco had to hurriedly brush the tears from his cheeks when Harry finished talking to Teddy and suggested that they leave, hoping that Harry hadn’t spotted it but knowing from the look on Harry’s face that he had. As they made their way out of the courtroom, Harry’s hand brushed against Draco’s shoulder, a light touch that could so easily have been imagined, but Draco could still feel the imprint of that hand as they left the Ministry, a phantom presence that set his nerves alight. His physical awareness of Harry only increased when they slipped into an alley behind the Ministry so that Draco could Side-Along Harry and Teddy to their next destination, Draco’s stomach flipping as he wrapped a hand around Harry’s arm in preparation for Disapparition.
‘Don’t lie to me, Draco, you know you’re crap at it.’
‘She’s very well, although Edward is keeping her busy.’ Draco hated how his mother refused to call Teddy by his nickname—everyone else did, after all, and it always took Draco a minute to figure out who she meant by ‘Edward’—but she insisted that it was only proper to use his full name.
It shouldn’t be. They’re supposed to hate each other, supposed to have years of history between them that make something like this impossible, but that doesn’t matter, not when Potter is stalking towards him, making Draco step backwards until his back hits the long windows that line the room.
He hadn’t wanted to admit it at the time, but Draco had always been…
‘Did your parents get married here?’
The grin that Harry shot his way made up for any embarrassment Draco felt at his hasty acceptance however, as did the way Harry once again linked their fingers so they could Apparate to his house from the alley behind the cinema.
When Draco trembles underneath Harry and spills, hot and perfect, over his hand, Harry’s completely powerless to stop his own orgasm, the pleasure so intense that his knees nearly buckle underneath him. With a groan he drops his head to rest on Draco’s shoulder, trying to catch his breath as aftershocks of bliss race through him. For a long moment Harry can’t do anything but stand there, legs shaking, heart pounding. It’s only when he softens and slips out of Draco that he finally comes back down to Earth. Draco shifts underneath Harry, making him realise that it can’t be comfortable, being pressed up against the brick wall like that.
The jingle of the bell above the door broke him out of his quiet reverie, and Draco looked up to once again find himself face to face with Harry Potter.
‘Oh,’ Harry said, turning round to face Draco and Teddy, a look of wonder on his face. ‘
‘Malfoy’s your Healer?’ he nearly shouted, rounding on Harry as though it was Harry’s fault.
‘You were,’ Harry agreed, to a raised eyebrow from Draco.
‘So you opened a cafe?’ Harry had been listening quietly, his eyes trained on Draco as he spoke, but when Draco paused Harry filled the silence.
And then Draco’s stroking Harry hard and fast, in the way that never fails to make Harry come, and Harry’s powerless to do anything but watch Draco’s hand as it coaxes a breathtaking orgasm out of him. He spills over Draco’s fingers and into the water, his moans echoing around the bathroom as he shudders with pleasure.
Harry waited for a moment, in tense anticipation of pain erupting under his skin, but when nothing happened, he relaxed. ‘Fine,’ he called out to Malfoy.
It had seemed like the right decision at the time, but as Harry lay next to Ginny, unable to drift off to sleep, the inches separating their bodies feeling like a mile, the memory of Malfoy on his knees floating to the forefront of Harry’s brain, Harry began to think that letting the curse run its course might have been a far easier option.
‘Fine,’ Harry said, repeating the movement. ‘Bit stiff, maybe.’
Draco’s good mood vanished immediately however when Teddy asked what was on the lowest floor of the Ministry, replaced with churning anxiety and guilt. Draco was unable to come up with a reason not to take Teddy there—it was only one floor down—and so on shaking legs, he lead the way to the courtrooms. He hadn’t been back here since his father’s sentencing. Since the last time he’d seen his father.
‘Andromeda mentioned that he’s started displaying signs of accidental magic,’ Narcissa said, her tone light, as though this was just another piece of idle chit chat. Draco knew better though, years of experience teaching him that his mother was skilled at lulling people into a false sense of security before revealing the main point of the conversation.
‘What’s going on?’ she asks, hands on hips in a way that is so Pansy that it makes Draco ache with missing having her around all the time.
Harry had thought the exact same thing when he’d realised that Malfoy was going to be his Healer, and he still wasn’t entirely convinced, but then he remembered how emphatic Malfoy had been about treating and healing anyone, no matter his personal feelings, not to mention the kindness in his voice when he’d been talking to the Trainee Healer. There was something about this older Malfoy that intrigued him. He wasn’t going to say that to Ron, though, so Harry fell back on his other reason for not demanding another Healer.
As Turner scored yet another goal, Harry turned around to face the opposite end of the pitch. He felt a droplet of rain land on his nose, and as he looked up into the clouds, he saw it. The Snitch was hovering not too far away from him, tiny wings fluttering rapidly, just slightly higher up in the sky than he was. Harry’s heart kicked up a gear as he bent low over his broom and pushed forwards, the wind stinging his face as he picked up speed. He only had a few seconds before his opponent would notice his movement, and he needed to make the most of them.
that Ron and Hermione had brought him and settled himself more comfortably in bed in preparation for a long and painful day, but he didn’t immediately open the magazine. Instead, he looked over at the chair Malfoy had sat in and replayed their conversation over and over in his head. With every conversation, Malfoy only intrigued him more, and Harry was glad that Malfoy had suggested the physical therapy, partly because it would help his recovery, but also because it meant he’d have to see Malfoy even more.
‘It’s not pity money!’ Potter roars, shocking Draco with the force of his emotion. ‘I hated paying you, alright? Is that what you want to hear?’
‘We’ll see how you are in the morning, but potentially tomorrow we can start getting you up and about.’ Malfoy seemed almost as happy about this as Harry felt.
‘Oh, I dunno,’ Harry said. ‘You’re not touching me now and it doesn’t hurt so, I guess so?’
‘Uh, yeah, sure,’ Harry said, doing his best to ignore the way his heart rate kicked up a notch when Malfoy’s fingers touched his, gently guiding Harry through the movements. The ghost of Malfoy’s touch lingered even once he’d pulled his hand away.
The air was cold on Harry’s overheated skin when he snuck out into the alley, his cheeks hot from the overcrowded pub and the beer he’d drunk. The team had been even more raucous than usual today, and it had taken Harry longer than he’d liked to extricate himself. He hoped it wouldn’t take Malfoy too long to make his escape, but he wasn’t too optimistic, considering how enthusiastically Ava had been telling Malfoy about a new curse she’d come across that week.
‘Didn’t realise you cared about rules, Potter,’ Malfoy said, one eyebrow raised as he looked over at Harry. Harry could only nod in acquiescence—Malfoy wasn’t wrong. Harry was notorious around the office for bending the rules when he was out on a job. He only got away with it because he got results, and it had been a close run thing at times.
‘Surely you must have a
‘Don’t push your luck,’ Draco replies, but there’s a smile in his voice and his hand leaves Harry’s hair, trailing down his chest instead, pausing only to circle Harry’s nipple before continuing its journey down.
‘What about you? What do you do, when you’re not here?’
‘It doesn’t feel like enough, most days,’ Malfoy replied. He looked down at his lap, twisting his fingers together. ‘I—I don’t know how to make up for what I did, what I was part of.’
‘Yes, please, Harry,’ Millie confirmed, placing the other outfits on a chair in the corner of the room.
Some of their trips into Muggle London were distinctly less successful however, especially when Harry decided to sit back and let Draco take the reins in an attempt to prove that he was perfectly able to deal with Muggles, thank you very much. It turned out that Draco was in need of more help than he would let on, as he discovered when he tried to use the self-checkout in Tesco, the robotic voice screeching at him to put his items in the bagging area, and when a Muggle asked him for directions to Trafalgar Square. Each time he nearly died of embarrassment, hating that he had shown himself up in front of Harry. But Harry was always gracious, waving away questions from concerned onlookers and slowly explaining how to actually use the till, or jumping in to direct the stranger himself. It hadn’t been the point of the lessons, but Draco found himself learning more and more about the Muggle world with each trip they took, he and Teddy both eagerly soaking up the knowledge that Harry so freely shared with them.
Harry had suggested a trip to London Zoo, for reasons that he refused to share until he forced them all to stop in front of one specific tank in the Reptile House. There, in a quiet voice, he explained to both of them that this was one of the places it had all started for him, making Teddy burst out laughing as he described the snake incident. They’d had to leave the Reptile House in a hurry, both stifling laughter, as Teddy kept trying to speak Parseltongue to all the snakes in an attempt to replicate what Harry had done, and Draco and Harry were both afraid that either he would succeed, and a snake would indeed escape, or that one of them would inadvertently talk too loudly about magic and break the International Statute of Secrecy.
‘I know why you’re here, Potter.’ Draco shifts, pushing up off the window frame, stepping closer to Potter. ‘You’re here to see me. To fuck me.’
Harry stood and watched while Malfoy cast a series of spells at the jewellery box, content to let Malfoy work without getting involved, the pain still too fresh in his mind to make him want to get any nearer to the jewellery box than he had to.
,’ Teddy breathed, and Draco could only laugh.
‘You tell me, you’re the one holding it,’ Draco says snarkily, his old defences snapping back into place in the face of Potter’s anger.
Hours after he first got into bed, Draco finally began to drift off to sleep, his mind finally exhausted after an evening spent wrestling over the dilemma, struggling with the pain of remembering his own past behaviour. He knew he could never forget what he had done, that it was something he would always have to carry with him, but normally he used that as a motivation to be good, be
‘How long will it take you for you to recover?’ Hermione asked, going to pick up the chart that Malfoy had left at the end of his bed, her lips pursing as she read it.
‘Oh.’ Harry didn’t quite know what to say. He might be grateful to Narcissa for helping him, but he couldn’t pretend that he didn’t think Lucius had got exactly what he deserved. ‘I’m sorry,’ he said finally, awkwardly patting Malfoy’s arm where it was hovering near Harry’s. He would have immediately regretted his clumsy gesture, were it not for the way Malfoy’s eyes shot down to where they were touching.
and would know why he wasn’t in. It was the main headline of the day,
The sound of Potter saying his name wakes him, who knows how long later.
As they prepare to head back to the office, hope swells in Harry’s chest, and the last thing he sees before he disappears into thin air is Draco, looking right at him, smile still firmly in place.
‘A bit. More than anything else, at least. We’d talk until the nightmare faded, and I felt like I could go to sleep again. She’s got the patience of a saint, that woman, not that she lets anyone else know that.’
him. It was just sex, he told himself resolutely, even as a quiet voice in his head immediately disputed that.
‘It’s hard to say for sure,’ Malfoy said slowly, his expression suggesting he was choosing his words carefully. ‘So much depends on the individual patient’s genetics, bone strength, baseline fitness… their cooperation with treatment and rehab.’ Malfoy looked pointedly at Harry as he finished speaking.
It’s dark by the time they fall silent, the room lit only by the pale, weak beams of the streetlights coming through the uncovered windows. They’ve shifted as they talked, and now they’re facing each other, bodies curled in mirror images of the other, close but not quite touching. It’s almost unbearably intimate, far more so than anything they’ve done with each other so far. Sex is one thing, but this is more than Draco’s shared with anyone.
Harry is aching all over, an intense day of putting the new Auror recruits through their paces taking its toll on his body. He likes to think he’s still as fit as ever, but on days like this, when he has to watch the 20-somethings he’s in charge of perform feats of physical skill for hour after hour, he’s reminded that he’s not as young and in-shape as he once was.
then, but he had never been able to make it happen. He didn’t want Harry to see him fail now.
His hand was cold against Harry’s hot skin, the temperature combining with the heady sensation of Malfoy’s touch on his skin after so long to leave Harry shivering, and all thoughts of taking things slowly vanished as desperate need overtook Harry. He pulled back for just long enough to pull his t-shirt off, Malfoy quickly following suit and removing his own shirt, before grabbing Malfoy’s hand and practically dragging him up the stairs to his bedroom.
He’s leaning against the window frame, looking out onto the street far below, watching the Friday night crowds on the terrace of the bar opposite. It’s one of the things he loves best about Paris, the buzz that fills the city on warm summer nights like this, when the terraces overflow with people drinking and smoking and chatting and revelling in life. He hadn’t planned on staying for so long when he’d first fled here, after several years of hatred had driven him out of Britain. But he’d found his place, here in the city, and it’s home now. He’s happy here.
‘Right then,’ Malfoy said, more businesslike than he’d sounded in days. ‘Everything looking all right, Esther?’
‘I—I don’t know what to say.’
The rest of the office had beaten Harry there, and had bagsied their favourite corner of the pub, pushing tables together and borrowing chairs until they all had seats. Harry spotted Malfoy straight away, sat on the far side of the tables, chatting animatedly to Robertson, and his stomach flipped over at the sight. Blaming it on nerves, and resolutely ignoring the flash of remembered pleasure, Harry made a beeline towards the bar, buying himself two pints. He wasn’t usually a big drinker, especially not at work events, but he had a feeling he’d need it tonight.
‘You know. Tall. Pointy. You’ve got that hair.’
‘I don’t intend to pay for anything to do with you ever again,’ Harry says, sincerity shining in his eyes as he brings Draco’s hand to his mouth and kisses it.
Once they were out on the pavement outside the cinema, stood slightly to one side to allow the stream of other customers to hurry past, they paused. Harry turned to look at Draco, uncertainty written across every line of his face. This was usually the moment when they parted ways, one of them—usually Harry—dropped Teddy back at Andromeda's while the other headed home. But Draco didn't want to go home. Didn't want this to be over yet, afraid that leaving would break the spell that had fallen over them in the hush of the cinema.
This man, a shady potions dealer, is a significantly better dueller than Harry had anticipated, and rivers of sweat are flowing down Harry’s face as he tries to land the final blow and capture him. Harry doesn’t doubt for a second that they’ll get him though, not when Draco is next to him, whirling like a fury as he alternates between offence and defence, his movements in perfect harmony with Harry’s. It’s like a dance they’ve choreographed, both knowing their part and moving seamlessly together, covering each other’s weak spots and boosting their strengths.
‘What if it’s not enough? Is a blowjob enough to lift the curse?’
‘Like this?’ Draco smirks, thrilling at the way Potter is looking at him. The bulge forming in Potter’s trousers hasn’t escaped Draco’s notice either, and his mouth waters as he pictures what’s hiding underneath the fabric.
‘What do you mean?’
'Teddy's staying at mine tonight,' Harry said, breaking the silence.
Ginny came into the kitchen as Harry was forcing down the last few bites of his dinner. She was in her pyjamas, her long hair plaited ready for bed as it was every night, and the sight made his heart hurt. This was all he’d wanted for so long, a happy home with the woman he loved, and this should have made him smile, should have made him want to follow Ginny upstairs to the bed they shared, but now all he could think of was how he’d put it all at risk.
‘Oh, sorry.’ Harry had the grace to look contrite, as though he had suddenly realised that it was in fact quite late. ‘I’ll go then.’
‘Physical therapy. Nothing extravagant, and his team had a physiotherapist lined up for when he was discharged from hospital, but we did a bit of extra work before he left St Mungo’s to help him recover his mobility and strength faster. Got him up and about a bit sooner than usually happens with Skele-Gro patients, walking around the hospital, that kind of thing.’
‘Dreamless Sleep?’ Grace answered, glancing up at Malfoy to check his response, her cheeks pinking as Malfoy smiled at her.
‘That’s ‘cause he knows you’re easy now,’ Harry replied. ‘Why should he give you a good price when he knows you’ll pay the high one?’
Hermione began pulling clothes out of the bag, far more than should have logically fitted inside. She piled jumpers and soft t-shirts and jogging bottoms on Harry’s bed, and stacked toiletries and books on the table next to him. ‘I didn’t know what books you wanted, so I just picked up the ones from your bedside table, and Ron said to bring the latest
‘Of course,’ Draco said, his voice rougher than normal, and Harry gave him one more quick kiss before dashing out of the room to intercept Teddy. Of course he would wait. He would wait as long as Harry needed.
‘You’ve already paid, Potter,’ Draco says, closing the gap between them fully. Potter’s eyes are shockingly green up close.
‘Looking forward to it,’ Harry said, thrilling at Malfoy’s answering smile. He was being honest—despite the complicated past they shared, Malfoy’s visits to his room had fast become Harry’s favourite part of the day. He tried to tell himself that it was only because being stuck in hospital was so boring that any company would be worth looking forward to, but he knew that wasn’t quite the truth.
‘I missed you, too,’ Malfoy said finally.  Those simple words were enough to make Harry’s heart soar, and then Malfoy leaned in, and Harry couldn’t hold back any longer.
. He could only get so lucky, however, and sometimes his risky flying ended not with the Snitch and resounding victory, but with broken bones and a body covered in bruises.
‘How could you, Harry? Did you think I’d never find out?’
‘Good, I’ve always thought you could do with having a more interesting life.’
‘You didn’t need to pay to see me,’ Draco replies, heart thumping in his chest as he skirts dangerously close to a confession. He’s not the type to take a risk, to put his heart in danger, but the thought of missing this chance with Potter—with Harry—is too much.
‘It was her daughter,’ Malfoy said when it became clear that Harry wasn’t going to add anything. ‘The one who referred the cottage to us in the first place. After—’ Malfoy paused for a second, as he seemed to search for the words that would let them dance around the reality of what had happened in the cottage, ‘when we went back, finished the investigation, we realised that a lot of the objects had been purchased at the same shop, and recently too.’
‘She knew, of course, where my interests lay, and not too long after we got married she proposed our arrangement. That we could see other people outside of the marriage. It was just as much for her as for me—Astoria’s far more interested in women than I’ve ever been. So, we were happy. I got to live with my best friend, and support her, while we both discreetly saw other people.’
‘Dunno,’ Harry mumbled, his mouth dry from the match and passing out. He thought for a moment, cataloguing his aches and pains, mentally checking in with each part of his body, from his sore head down to his feet. He was injured, that was for sure—his chest and side were burning with a gradually increasing pain, and his leg felt funny and swollen. ‘Bit sore, my leg…’ he started to say, but his words trailed off as he finally turned to look at his Healer.
‘No, wait, like this,’ Malfoy interrupted, as Harry slowly touched each finger to his thumb, one by one. ‘Can I?’ Malfoy paused, his hand hovering inches from Harry’s.
‘We should go together.’
Potter’s words echo around the room as Draco tries to take them in. He thinks—hopes—he knows what Potter is trying to say, but he doesn’t quite dare to believe it.
Potter’s standing over him, fully dressed again, hair still a disaster but cheeks back to their normal colour, all other signs of their time together vanished. It makes Draco inexplicably sad.
‘I’ll leave you to it,’ Esther said, patting Harry gently on the arm and leaning in to whisper, ‘And good luck with him, too.’ With one last smile and wink at Harry, she left them to an awkward silence.
thing they’d done since this began. They were quick blowjobs and messy handjobs in dirty alleyways, not hand-holding and cuddles, and Harry knew he was on dangerous territory, conflating the two, but he couldn’t stop himself.
‘Would be nice to give everyone something else to gossip about besides poor Harry Potter, dateless at a ball again too,’ Harry added, eyebrows furrowing as he remembered the endless headlines that had been splashed all over the front page of the
‘But—,’ Potter starts, as though he’s going to argue, but then he deflates, swallows the words, relents. ‘Ok, fine, we won’t talk about it.’
‘Potter? Are you alright?’ Malfoy looked concerned, his face tight with worry, his voice strained.
There was another person with him, a young woman, the word
‘What the fuck, Malfoy? I was so close,’ Potter groans, his expression wild as he looks down at Draco. Draco has never felt as powerful as he does in that moment, when he sees the full effect he can have on Potter.
‘I thought I’d had my celebration,’ Harry replied, to which Draco laughed.
‘I’m sure you could go and get as much sex as you wanted, without doing it for a job.’
is going to be, then, I want to try this.’
‘Well, since you asked so nicely,’ Potter chuckles, and then he’s pressing in, his prick opening Draco up, and
‘Right,’ he said, at first as though just to himself, then repeating it again, more firmly this time. ‘Right, I think I know what this is. I still want to have a look, but come here, stay close.’
‘After the war,’ Malfoy began after taking a deep breath, ‘I didn’t know what to do with myself. I had so much to unlearn, so much to come to terms with. Pansy and Blaise left the country, my parents fled to France, and I was all alone. Astoria saved me, in a lot of ways. She was my only friend for a long time, while I worked to become a better person, although believe me, I know I’ll never be able to make up for what I was a part of. But nevertheless, she supported me through it all.’
‘Yes, I’d noticed he’s getting a bit bored, it’s just a bit hard to make inheritance rituals interesting to a ten year old. And I suppose I’m trying to teach him not to blindly believe things he’s told, teach him that Muggles aren’t dirt and that they do have value. Really I just want to make sure he doesn’t get sucked into the pure-blood superiority crap like I did.’ Draco found himself slightly out of breath at the end of his explanation, the words pouring out of, leaving him shocked that he’d just told Harry of all people so much.
‘Eventually.’ Malfoy sighed, rubbing his palm over his face and then up into his hair, ruffling it so that it fell more softly around his face. ‘It took a few hours to get him stabilised, but we got there in the end.’
Malfoy chuckled quietly, and the underlying tension that had settled across the room while they talked broke. Harry half-expected Malfoy to leave then, to decide that they’d talked enough, that there was no need to risk bringing up more difficult moments from their past. Instead, Malfoy simply shifted in his seat, crossing one long leg over the other.
‘Merlin you don’t give up do you? No wonder you managed to defeat Voldemort with persistence like that.’ Draco laughed, before his tone turned serious once again. ‘It’s not that it’s a bit run down, that could be fixed, although I do think you’re seriously overestimating the power the Malfoy name has now. It’s that I wouldn’t be allowed to have the wedding I want here, to the person I want.’
‘How do you know about that?’ Draco said, shocked.
. At times, it almost seemed like Malfoy felt the same. Harry was past the point of needing someone to hold onto when he walked, and yet neither of them moved apart. Malfoy was a constant presence at Harry’s side, the smell of his cologne surrounding them, his arm warm against Harry’s as they walked laps around the hospital, their fingers brushing from time to time and sending sparks of pleasure up Harry’s arm. Harry’s nerves were on edge constantly, bombarded continually with awareness of Malfoy. Each night when he collapsed into bed, Harry was exhausted from the ever present anticipation and excitement that churned in his gut, yet at the same time, he couldn’t wait for the morning when he’d get to see Malfoy again.
Harry had no idea what to say to that, other than to apologise once again, however futile it might be.
‘Definitely,’ Harry said. ‘Come on then, let’s get this over with,’ he added, nodding his head towards the entrance to the house.
Harry’s never heard Draco sound like that before, and the need in his voice sends such a heady rush of lust through Harry that he thinks he could come, there and then, completely untouched. Harry decides he’s teased Draco enough, at least for now, and takes him into his mouth fully, tongue swirling as he begins to move up and down, his hand moving in time with his mouth. Draco’s hand sliding into his hair, tugging ever so slightly, has Harry moaning around Draco’s dick and reaching down to undo his own trousers, desperately needing to touch himself.
‘Um, sorry, what did you say?’ Harry asked, praying they hadn’t noticed him cataloguing Malfoy’s face.
‘I don’t want to come yet,’ Draco said, his tone stern but the effect ruined by his glassy eyes and pink cheeks. ‘And besides, it’s you we should be treating today, not me.’
‘Mm,’ Malfoy hummed, coming closer and peering down at Harry’s wrist as he cast a diagnostic spell. ‘Your hip will have to wait a few more days, but I see no reason to delay starting work on your wrist.’
This time, Draco didn’t close his eyes. For a moment he just stood where he was, feeling the magic in the air prickling against his skin, letting it course through his veins and fill him up with a feeling of power and wonder, and then he looked at Harry. Mind full of the memory of Harry’s lips against his, his body thrumming with the power of centuries worth of magic, he cast once more.
‘Yes, completely, but not because I think you’re unattractive.’
As Harry read, comprehension dawned, and he understood why Draco had reacted so strongly to the invitation, when normally he loved the Yule Ball. Monsieur Baptiste Dubois was Draco’s ex. They’d met when he first came to the UK to work with the Ministry, and Draco had seemed happy for a while - so happy that Harry had found himself jealously wishing he could find the same contentment in a relationship. But then something had happened, Harry didn’t know what, and suddenly they were broken up, and Draco was giving death stares to anyone who so much as mentioned the name Baptiste.
Harry was tired. He was exhausted from a week of non-stop work, and beyond weary of constantly policing his thoughts in case they strayed too close to Malfoy and having to deal with the guilt when they inevitably did. He was tired, and he had no strength to fight his desires anymore. When Malfoy swayed forward slightly, Harry was powerless to do anything but meet him halfway, a groan escaping from him when their lips met. It was everything he’d been dreaming of for the past week, and all his pent-up desire raced through him like an inferno as he pulled Malfoy flush up against him.
‘Yeah,’ Harry agreed, before adding, ‘I feel all right now though, like nothing happened.’
‘Hello, Harry, welcome to Chartreux Designs.’
Malfoy was hot and tight around Harry’s finger as Harry slowly opened him up, letting Malfoy’s moans guide him as he figured out how to touch him. Before long Malfoy was pushing back to meet every movement of Harry’s fingers. Harry’s cock was achingly hard, and he was sorely tempted to reach down, just like Malfoy had that day in the cottage, and bring himself off as he drove Malfoy wild with just his fingers. One day he would do that, he caught himself thinking, before he reminded himself that there shouldn’t be a
‘For me.’ Draco drops his head into his hands, hiding from Pansy’s gaze. ‘I wanted it to be real, and it was too much, I couldn’t see him anymore. I couldn’t have him paying me any longer.’
Draco felt a burst of hope shooting through his veins. Maybe this hadn’t ruined anything, maybe it would turn out to be the best thing they’d ever done.
‘I missed you,’ Harry said quietly, watching Malfoy’s face closely to catch his reaction. ‘I only stayed away at work because it was too hard to pretend that I only saw you as a colleague.’
The Magpies’ Seeker was hot on his tail, and the teams were only twenty points apart, so Harry had no room for error if Puddlemere were to win the League. The team had worked so hard all season to get to this point, and there was no way he was going to mess it up for them by fumbling this chase. The Snitch was several arm lengths away, speeding upwards, right through the middle of the Chasers who were still trying to score goals. Determined not to let it get away, Harry bent low over his broom, bracing in anticipation of a flare of pain in his hip that never came. It was his fourth match back from his injury, and he was relieved that just when it mattered most, his recovery seemed to be complete.
‘Did you do your training here?’ Harry asked tentatively. There was so much he didn’t know about Malfoy, so much he
‘Yes, Potter. This is my cafe, I work here. Now do you want a drink or not?’ Draco’s attempt at treating Harry just like any other customer failed, the customary exasperation he had always felt when dealing with Harry overpowering his ingrained habit of always being polite to customers.
‘Well, good luck with the rest of your recovery,’ Malfoy said quickly in a tone that Harry suspected was supposed to be professional and detached but ended up sounding strangled. Then, before Harry could say anything, Malfoy turned to leave the room.
Harry doesn’t want to move, unwilling to put any space between them. He wants to stay right here, Draco’s back hot against his chest, forever. If he moves, then it’s over, and he doesn’t think he can bear that, now he knows what it feels like to be inside Draco. He can’t stop himself dropping the lightest of kisses on the exposed nape of Draco’s neck before he moves away, busying himself with righting his robes to avoid having to see the look on Draco’s face. He doesn’t quite know what he’ll see if he looks at Draco, and he’s scared to find out.
‘I’d intended for yesterday to be our last lesson,’ Draco said, Harry’s face immediately falling.
‘Not happy about that?’ Esther said, catching Harry’s frown.
‘You like to travel?’
Nerves flutter in Draco’s stomach as he waits to see if Potter will respond, unsure if he’s pushed too far. He hopes he hasn’t—he doesn’t want Potter to leave, not now they’ve come so close.
‘Takeaway again?’ Draco asked, already reaching for the cardboard cup.
‘This was-,’ Harry paused, and Draco began to panic. He knew what came after those words. ‘This was incredible.’
‘I’d tell you to suck my cock,’ Potter says, his voice stronger, firmer. He’s standing straighter now, his eyes no longer shocked but instead darker, a hint of want in them. Draco doesn’t miss the way Potter says
Harry stretched out his arm, leaning as far forwards as he could on his broom without risking toppling over. His stomach leapt as his fingertips briefly touched the cold metal—this was it. Stretching his arm and hand as far as he could, Harry willed his broom forward and let out a roar as his fingers closed tightly around the Snitch. He flew upwards, the Snitch held tightly in his fist as he raised it above his head to loud cheers from the crowd. He could hardly believe it. Only the feeling of the fluttering wings under his palm could convince him that he’d really done it. He’d caught the Snitch, and they’d won the League.
‘It’s harder than you’d think,’ Potter laughs ruefully. ‘Dating, casual sex, whatever,’ he waves a hand in the air, ‘it’s all hard in Britain. People watch me everywhere I go, and I never know if people are actually interested in me or just in the man they think they know.’
Again and again, in fact. He’s quickly becoming one of Draco’s most frequent clients—something Draco absolutely isn’t complaining about.
‘Right,’ he said, nodding to himself and standing up. ‘You’ll have to take a few more doses of Skele-Gro before your bones will have healed enough, but as soon as possible we’ll get you up and moving about. I must go and finish my rounds now, but I’ll be back to check on you again later.’
It’s having a different effect today though; even though minutes earlier he’d been feeling sleepy. He’s getting hard, just from the sensation of Draco’s fingertips against his head, and Harry’s mind drifts to the other things Draco can do with those skilled hands. Harry would happily -- and indeed has -- let Draco spend hours just touching him, his fingers dancing over Harry’s sensitive skin before slowly, carefully opening him up. He’s come like that before, just from Draco’s fingers inside him.
Draco goes back to his normal life, after that.
Settling back down on the sofa, accidentally slightly closer to Harry than he had been before, Draco poured two generous measures of whiskey, clinking glasses with Harry before taking a sip, the drink burning and warming his chest.
Malfoy picked up the book and turned it over slowly, his forehead creasing slightly as he read the back.
Malfoy’s face had grown even paler than normal, his face twisting at whatever he was thinking about.
‘I want another Healer,’ Harry said determinedly. A flush of embarrassment raced through him when Malfoy just looked at him dispassionately, one eyebrow slightly raised.
Malfoy spent the next half an hour demonstrating different movements to Harry, getting him to move his hand from side to side, and turn his palm up to the sky, and clench his fingers into a fist. Harry could hardly take his eyes off Malfoy’s hands as they worked, unable to look away from the elegant way he moved, his motions effortless. Harry found himself wondering if Malfoy’s hands would be like that when doing other things, and a shiver of unexpected lust ran through him at the thought.
As the action resumed after the penalty, Harry went back to flying slowly around the pitch, scanning the sky for the Snitch. The sky was gunmetal grey, threatening rain, the wind was whipping in his hair, and he loved it. He’d never expected to end up a Quidditch player—he never expected to live past school, really—but now he couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Despite the difficulties that came with a career in the public eye, it was all worth it for how free he felt soaring high above the ground, the thrill of competition beating through his veins.
‘Right,’ Malfoy said eventually, lowering his wand hand and turning to face Harry, all the while maintaining their contact. The look on his face made Harry’s stomach constrict with nerves. That expression could only mean bad news.
‘A few months?! What the fuck, Harry?’ Ginny sank back down onto her chair, dropping her head into her hands, her long hair falling around her face, shielding her from Harry. ‘How could you?’ she added, so quietly that Harry almost didn’t hear.
‘Ok,’ Malfoy scrubbed a hand over his face. ‘Shall we just—let’s just try this, first?’
Harry lingered in the kitchen long after Ginny had disappeared upstairs, alternating between pacing and sitting at the table with his head in his hands. When he couldn’t hold back the yawns any longer, Harry finally gave in and trudged upstairs, fighting back yet more guilt when he climbed into bed and looked over at Ginny who was curled up on her side, sound asleep.
‘Well there’s no need to brag.’
‘I don’t think you’re stupid!’ Harry burst in. He knew he deserved all the yelling and more, but he didn’t want Ginny to think badly of herself.
‘Merlin, Potter, are you ever going to actually fuck me?’ Draco snaps, need rendering him incapable of hiding his frustration.
‘And talking to her about them helped?’ Harry asked.
‘Oh, Draco.’ And then Pansy is beside him on the sofa, pulling him into her arms, and it’s everything Draco’s been needing. He’s used to bottling up his feelings, burying them deep down, but it’s a relief to have said it aloud, and he finds that his eyes are damp and he’s trembling as Pansy strokes his back.
‘I mean, I wouldn’t rule it out, but apparently it doesn’t matter whether he’s Muggle or pure-blood.’ Harry shrugged, the way his eyes met Draco’s as he confirmed his suspicions making Draco’s heart flip. Draco didn’t say anything in response, just nodded and let a small smile spread across his face, a smile which was met by a much larger one from Harry, and they lapsed into silence, watching Teddy play. The knowledge that Harry was gay too had a curious sensation of hope blossoming in Draco’s stomach, a sensation that he tried to tamp down—however curious he might be about Harry and however attractive he did admittedly find him, nothing was going to happen, ever.
‘So why did you decide to become a Quidditch player?’ Malfoy asked. ‘Despite the accusations I used to throw your way I’d have thought you’d have had more than enough of fame?’
‘Eloquent as ever, Potter,’ Malfoy said with a low laugh, that, combined with the use of his surname, made something hot coil in Harry’s stomach. ‘But yes, it was shit. I don’t know what I would have done without Pansy when they were at their worst.’
‘But you did?’
‘You tell me, Harry,’ she said, her tone unlike any Harry had heard her use before.
‘Muggle London?’ Harry couldn’t disguise the surprise in his voice. Going to live among Muggles seemed a rather drastic move for someone who had just fought in a war on the side of
‘And yet you’re here,’ Draco’s mere feet away from Potter now. He can smell mint in the air, and the very ends of Potter’s curly hair are damp—he’s clearly showered recently. It’s a deliciously tempting image, and Draco’s desire deepens further.
‘I can’t wait to find out which house I’m in,’ Teddy said, before listing off on his fingers which house each of his extended family had been in, including every single Weasley.
‘Ok,’ Draco replies, stretching his sore limbs and standing up. He feels better once he’s standing, less vulnerable than when Potter was looming over him.
‘Didn’t you win Witch Weekly’s most desirable wizard or some rubbish like that multiple years running?’ Draco suppressed a laugh at the way Harry’s blush deepened.
‘And, I don’t know. I just needed a coffee,’ Harry finished anticlimactically.
Draco didn’t respond immediately, returning to tucking in chairs and wiping the tables, trying to decide what he wanted to tell Harry.
'We're going to watch more films and eat Muggle sweets!' Teddy added excitedly.
But then Malfoy looked away from the window, glancing down at his watch. ‘Merlin, it’s late, and I have early rounds tomorrow,’ he said, reminding Harry that he was only here because this was his job. ‘Do you need help getting back to bed?’
‘We have to have sex,’ Malfoy said quickly, as though saying it as fast as possible would make it easier.
‘Malfoy,’ Harry said suddenly, interrupting his musings.
‘No, you just broke most of the bones in your body instead.’ Malfoy’s veneer of professionalism had vanished almost entirely, as though the dim light and the stillness of the night let him slip out of it and back into himself.
‘Potter,’ Draco says, sharper now. ‘I said, leave it.’
What Draco does is get absolutely plastered. After insisting that he doesn’t want to talk about it anymore, he and Pansy begin to steadily make their way through several bottles of wine. Draco listens as Pansy regales him with scandalous stories of her life in Monaco, distracted for the first time from the undercurrent of sadness that has been present these last weeks. It’s good to have her here, and he makes a silent promise to not leave it so long between visits. Whatever he might like to think about his ability to look after himself, he needs his friends.
‘Fine,’ Draco said, in a decisive tone, ‘we’ll go together then.’ And then, as though they hadn’t just decided to do something crazy and potentially friendship ruining, Draco turned and went back to work without another word.
For long minutes he just stands there, letting Potter look. It’s surprisingly erotic, and Draco’s cock hardens further under Potter’s scrutiny. His clients normally look at him, of course, but never quite in this way. When they look at him, Draco knows they’re seeing what they want to see, his body just the template for the fantasy they superimpose on top. With Potter, it’s different. Draco feels seen, properly, for the first time in years, and he knows Potter’s seeing the messy reality of him, tattoo-covered wrists, sectumsempra scars and all.
As soon as his spell hit the box, he knew he’d messed up, and didn’t have time to do anything but brace for whatever was coming, not even to shout a warning to Malfoy.
‘Well, I am mostly here,’ Malfoy said, laughing, his eyes crinkling and his face lighting up in a way that made Harry’s stomach twist. ‘And I have to do a lot of training, and studying to keep up. With the little time I have left, I read a lot. I try to travel when I can. I see my mother, my friends.’
‘Pansy would never be caught dead on a broom, and Blaise isn’t a big fan either,’ Malfoy laughed, his eyes crinkling with mirth, making Harry’s stomach flip over. ‘I remember trying to teach them to fly one summer during the holidays, and Merlin they were awful. Blaise is terrified of heights, not that he’ll ever admit that to anyone.’
It’s an unusually hot September and the city is sweltering. It leaves Draco feeling listless, his boiling flat making it impossible to sleep, forcing him to spend hours lying in bed, tossing and turning and thinking about Potter. His days are spent in a daze of exhaustion, books opened and put aside without taking a word in, years’ worth of routine slipping away without the structure of his work. And all the time, his mind is full of Potter. He keeps refusing to see anyone though, and eventually stops responding to any communications from the hotel at all.
Harry doesn't think much beyond how much he wants to hold him, an urge so strong it propels him forward into Draco's space, to step up to him and wrap his arms around his shoulders, raised slightly on his bare toes.
"I have a kitchen table," Harry said to himself, feigning surprise.
"But you were still unsure, weren't you? Would you have done it if I hadn't said all those things, pressured you?"
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Malfoy. Whatever you need to talk about, talk about it. Right here. There's no need for all these… these formalities or whatever."
"I don't know why I did," Harry said, breathing a small laugh, because he looked back on himself and thought, he must have always been at least a little mad when it came to Draco. "I just saw your name, and I went."
There are many points in time at which Draco tries to question the reason behind Potter wanting his company, despite him knowing what he knew, despite the memory that breathed heavy and unacknowledged between them. But he quickly abandons any such trains of thought when he learns that all it does is take him down a path to a terrible, delusional hope or a terrible hurt and humiliation. Some things are best not to think about if one requires their sanity, and Draco already has the recurrent sense that he's just about on the edge of losing it most of the time.
"To make it even worse for him," Malfoy snickered, trying not to lose it again. "It was us."
"It did." But now there are many other scars to replace them, hidden underneath, and so it hardly matters. He doesn't say this.
He feels strange, a bit off-kilter, having Potter so close and next to him, even despite the distance. He feels it a bit harder to breathe, but now for an entirely different reason. "I'm well-aware."
engagement, they were offering a fifty-percent decrease in their overall bills.
"We're not going to die, Malfoy, come on," Harry said, in a desperate scoff. He ran a hand down his face, spread it out, the other palm on his hip. "Maybe…
They stood. Harry gently pulled away, insisting he could walk on his own.
Draco stares at her, and it takes a few seconds to latch on to what she's said. His head feels full, even though his thoughts are foggy and slow. He's been thinking a lot these days. He's been thinking a lot about a cellar, and his dreams, and about Harry, about Potter. More than anything these days, Potter. He's been going away a lot.
"I don't know," Harry answered her, low and hoarse. "I don't know if he was aware he was cursed. He looked strange, a bit sick, I think, but I
For a time after, Malfoy didn't bare his body in the light, only in the dark, and Harry never asked. Harry never asked either when Malfoy did, again, with his history hidden under glamours.
"Thanks," Harry says. Neville pushes himself off the doorframe, and then leaves. Harry goes into his own room, sits down by the bed on the floor.
"Tell her again. She won't forgive you right away, but talk to her properly at least once."
"Water under the bridge," Harry says. He hasn't quite thought about it so much in years.
"There's an extra broom there, if you want," Harry said, nodding towards a small cupboard.
"You didn't tell her," Harry said. Draco ignored him, spinning with a step of each foot and walking towards the exit. Harry followed after him. "Did you tell anybody at all?"
He'd let his mouth run with the course of his emotions and had ended up snapping, said an unkind thing—
He lifted his head again a moment after, had only meant to only watch what was happening, to be in the moment, but something focused in his mind on what he was looking at right then, and he was stilled by the odd flare of a feeling, a warm bubbling low in his stomach.
Ginny slams the door shut on her way out. Harry feels sick to his stomach, sick with himself all the time, and like he might just lose everything after all. He lost Draco because he was too afraid of just that, and now he might just lose everything anyway.
When Malfoy's face crossed the inches of distance between them, his heart jolted into rapid beats again, the feeling of it pounding against his sternum. Malfoy's mouth pressed against his own, one soft, chaste kiss that was enough to steal all of his breaths away, pleasurable tingles radiating from his lips and down his spine.
with me and I know
One morning, an awful, exhausting morning, Harry came back from a run, not feeling much better than how he'd left, and vyed for skipping breakfast. He was making to walk past Draco, who was lounging against the doorframe of the kitchen, only Draco put a hand to Harry's shoulder, stopped him there. He turned back into the kitchen, and came back a moment later with a foil wrap.
hex you."
"You called me your husband."
"I always thought you had a good relationship with your father." Harry didn't say that it was about the only human thing that he'd known of Lucius.
"I thought that... I was sure you must have moved on, after all this time."
"Come, darling." Narcissa smiles, a flicker of one, her eyelashes damp and clumped together, but her bittersweet joy crinkles into her eyes. Her hand falls as she turns away, coming up to wipe her thumb under her eyes and dabbing the tears on them away with fingers. "Let's talk over some lunch."
And then there were hands grabbing his bowed face carefully, turning it to the side towards another pale face leaning closely to his own, lowered to try and meet his eyes. Harry blinked as he lifted his gaze, locking with Malfoy's moonstone ones, and he was looking at him in the painfully tender way that he was looking at him in the restaurant during that fake proposal.
"The ones you, um… left behind for me?"
Xavier added, which skipped over Harry with no meaning. Hence the curse kept acting up in sporadic breaks of time, resisted the distance between them and encouraged physical contact
Draco rolls his eyes, exasperated. But then he's grabbing Harry's face and pulling him in, nose to nose, sort of grinning into his grin, Harry laughing. Through the rest of the song, they dance with faded smiles and foreheads together, by a Christmas tree and fairylights.
Half-way through July, Draco collapsed again, and their lives came to another halt once more, only it was in an entirely different way.
He was roused from sleep in another blink, his head pounding. When he checked the Tempus, it had been an hour since they'd returned from the party. More than that, he felt the beginnings of a nauseating malaise through his body. He looked beside him. The other side of the pillow was neat, untouched.
"There's no other reason, then? You just—is this—are we just hanging out?"
"It's only an hour, Harry."
"Wanker."
"Hmm," Draco said, slanting a mild smile. "But I think I've had enough of that, now."
Harry jerks the treacle tart away from his mouth in an exaggerated display of indignation. "Well,
They were sitting by the fireplace, comfortable and warm from the winter cold, the two of them fairly drunk in celebration of New Years Eve. Draco had been playing around a bit with wandless magic, gold embers forming shapes in the firelight, still a little fizzly, but they could see it coming back. He'd been humming something to himself for the last few minutes, slightly croaky as that of somebody inebriated and hazy.
Harry shrugged. They were sitting very close, shoulders brushing. He could feel his warmth, the warmth of the bond pulling back. "Me? No." He thought briefly of Elias. "Not before this anyway."
His secret crush on Cedric had complicated things even more, even if he hadn't entirely understood it then.
Most of the time, he'd just walk past him to the bedroom, expecting Harry to follow. Other times, they'd just fuck right there on the couch.
Here is a boy that he's wanted since forever, has had and yet not at all for another forever, and now here he is, finally,
There was the tussle over who got to have the first shower in the morning. Harry's stance had been that he got to it first, and Malfoy took too long in there, and he had
"I didn't mean to…"
"Really?" Harry asked, brows raised.
, when he points out that he doesn't need any of this, that he's only sticking around for her and Harry this year
"Upstairs," Malfoy said curtly.
as if that made any sense at all.
"What are you thinking?"
His mouth was dragging down the side of his throat, all tongue and teeth, sucking heavy at the flutter of his pulse, heard him inhale a sharp breath — pushed his shirt up to his underarms and over his head, palmed him broad and thorough everywhere.
Harry had been downstairs making breakfast for the two of them, to be carried up to their bed. Draco had shown up in the kitchen after his shower, insisting on making tea for the two of them just to have something to do.
It was a redundant question, because there was only one answer to it, but Draco only said, "You ask a lot of questions."
Harry's eyes lifted to him. He frowned, bemused. "Why?"
Malfoy pulling out his chair for him, maybe, honestly what the—check.
Harry hadn't spoken with Malfoy since the beginning of the school year. There were occasional, awkward run-ins with one another, nearly bumping into each other in the hallways, but hardly ever any proper conversation.
Malfoy threw an arm in an angry sort gesture at him as he walked away, the back of his pressed white shirt to him, bellowing back, "And I say, the feeling is mutual!"
The thing was that bonding curses that worked on something as internal and volatile as emotions could hardly respond much to any external treatments. There was only easing the symptoms that were to follow, only shifting their focus to the quality of life.
"Stop trying to comfort me," Harry said. "You're not supposed to be the one comforting me after everything that's just happened."
Ginevra is holding Potter's hand. She is looking at Granger and Ronald across from her as she speaks, gesturing with her free hand as she supposedly tells them a humorous story, Potter staring on at her with the lingering grin of prior laughter.
He ended up looking over anyway, a daily losing battle these days. Draco was still asleep, a hand under his cheek. His mouth was softened, muscles loose at the hollow of his cheeks, around his eyes. His prim and neat eyebrows were gently furrowed in slumber.
He tugs a parchment close to himself, the ink bottle with the quill dipped in it. He picks it up, wiping excess ink on the edges. His fingers hover over the top of the parchment.
"I'm here," Harry said, nearly soundless under the tinny song playing. "I'm right here."
"They won't ever know what they…" Draco's voice trails off, in a low voice. He huffs, derisive. "The way I can't even stand the thought of... I don't remember any of it, but I
Draco had bought the robes for Harry, a deep blue, silken robe with intricate golden patterns woven at the borders, the sleeves. He taught Harry a charm that could style his hair best, bring it under a bit of control, so that it looked deliberate and artful.
"Am I boring you?" Draco says, pressing his lips together with a look at him. He has to crane his head against his shoulder, arch an eyebrow, to be able to do that. "You're getting lost in some fantasy again, aren't you?"
The embarrassment begins to sink in deep, spreading a hot flush up his neck. It sounds much too lamenting. He wishes he didn't say anything.
When they were gone, Harry shut the door with a low click.
"No. God, I..." Harry says, huffs, a tremor, thick like a cold. "I haven't been happy without you in years." And maybe given a few more years, Harry would have learned. And Draco would have learned too. But they are here now, and they have waited and are still wanting and in love, and Harry would rather be happy with him than without. He entwines his hand with Draco's, pulls it to his own lap. "I'm not letting you go ever again."
— Merlin and Morgana and Salazar, you're so—" He ruffles through more of them, all the tomfoolery and ridiculousness of their younger selves, smiling faintly. Draco's doodles, Harry's additions sent back. "I don't remember drawing half of these."
When there isn't anything else, he turns on his wireless to fill the silence more often than not, playing tunes he doesn't always pay attention to.
When Harry went downstairs,  Narcissa was in the kitchen, drinking her tea. It was an entirely contrasting dining table set from the ancient, gothic furniture she'd previously had in their drawing room, an elegant combination of marble-white and ember brown. He thought of Nagini and didn't have to wonder much why she might have had those thrown out, had all this moved into a different place.
"I miss you."
Draco was palming his cheeks, pulling his face close to his own, saying, "You're so
"You're really alright?" Harry asked, needing reassurance.
he thinks to him, when he draws back, Harry smiling back at him with a face so sweet, and his eyes full with tenderness, with himself.
"Draco," Harry said. There were so many things he wanted to say.
Of course, he knew that family was prejudiced, but in the matters of the law, that is his new home.
Albus nodded his head and took the child away from her arms. McGonagall grabbed the Potter boy and was quested to take him to the Dursleys.
"The boy will go with Lily's sister, Petunia, and he will live with her family." The old man said.
Albus left the orphanage and sighed.
"Seems that you've named the child, McGonagall. Are you able to take care of this child?" Albus said, with a curious look on his face.
The father ran to help the Potter's, completely oblivious his wife was going through labor.
There were many orphanages in that area, so Albus took Aurora to the closest one.
Finally, as if you pulled out the needle from a shot, her body was filled with relief when the baby was completely out.
"Why don't we name you?" She whispered, slowly moving side to side. The baby cooed in her arms.
McGonagall joined him a few minutes later and they apparated away.
The night of the Dark Lord's scheme impacted a child's birth. The house near the Potter's was thieved of light, leaving the pregnant mother inside hopeless.
It was the start of a new life.
A beautiful, small and petite girl cried in the woman's arms. The mother reached her arms out to receive her child but her eyes suddenly got blurry.
:"They're vile Albus, I have studied them to be the most narrow-minded and ignorant family ever." The witch replied. Albus only shook his head and opened the door to lead them both out.
Aurora after the sunset that rising in that moment, Lucia after her dead mother, and Moore given by her father's family.
The room was spinning around in her head, however, she can still see the woman pulling the child away from her, making the mother cry.
Snoring from the babies made the witch smile. She caressed the girl's cheek and thought of a name.
"My goodness, the nerve of people these days." The lady said and took the child from him.
"I don't think I can, Albus. I simply do not have the time nor energy to, sadly." McGonagall replied with guilt. Not that she didn't care for the child, but there was no way she could possibly survive taking of Aurora and her work.
"What about Aurora, both of her parents didn't have a relative?" The witch said then looked down at the peaceful girl.
"There was a note that had her name written, here. Make sure she finds a nice home." The clerk nodded her head with a smile and wrote in her computer about the child's limited information.
"GIVE ME MY CHILD!" she screamed. The cries of both babies were slowly fainting away as her vision worsened.
The two wizards looked at each and sighed. They lost not one but two wizarding families in one night.
Darkness, silence, and comfort went through the mother's body. Slowly drifting away from the world.
"We'll take good care of her." The woman whispered, caressing the mother's sweaty face.
"Aurora Lucia Moore." The witch could've sworn she saw the baby smile at the name. She took it as a sign that it perfectly suited the child.
Aurora cooed in her crib and opened her big blue eyes.
Everything happened so slow in her mind, time going on forever.
Focus wasn't easy when another child was crying in the old man's arms. Pushing with her greatest strength was hell, her body was in agony.
"Thank you sir, have a nice day." The lady then took Aurora away and into a crib, waiting to be checked on.
