“I know!” Harry yelled back and laughed. But his laugh was soon stifled by Draco pulling him into a hug too, his face being pressed into his sweater. He hesitated but wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, welcoming the embrace by his, obviously former, nemesis.
“First of, don’t call him ‘Potter’, got it? Second of, I can’t tell you,” Draco said, raising his voice and Harry flinched next to him, being somewhat used to Malfoy as a calm and quiet person nowadays.
Draco couldn’t help himself but feel thankful for the reassurance Barry’s words held. They made him feel better about being a gay man. It was nothing compared to the reaction of his father and his mother. And he was absolutely right, the team would never judge him for who he is. He never noticed any kind of discrimination coming from one of them.
“It’s alright. You were right, you deserved to know.”
“I didn’t see that. His hair was in the way. He asked if I know where “Draco Malfoy” is, though. Took me twenty minutes to tell him that I don’t know Draco after he said he works with me. We’re still trying to find out his name, but no success so far.” Barry remained calm, not getting the reason why Draco shifted anxiously from one foot to the other. “Do you know him?” he continued, eyeing him warily.
It was a warm Friday afternoon in Central City when Draco- no, Julian, walked into his office at the Central City Police Department to do his job. As soon as he turned eighteen, he left England, leaving the world full of wizards and witches behind. He moved to America to start a new life, changing his name and his background. He had a new identity: Julian Albert. No one knew he is a wizard, everyone just saw him as the CSI expert at the Central City Police Department.
“Right, because I’m not as eloquent as my teenage self and cut walking with a stick up my ass, I’m pretending to be someone I’m not? I don’t think you’re aware of the person I really am. But how could you? We made each other’s lives hell, I never gave away my true self, like here,” he said and pointed at his chest, the spot where his heart was. “If you want to enlighten yourself on my personality, you might as well go visit Pansy. Her psychological expertise is going to give you a whole encyclopedia of Draco Malfoy, the broken boy!” he yelled and stomped away, needing space to take some deep breaths.
He came to a halt and walked into the building, knowing the way blindfolded by now. His friends greeted him like any other day before Harry showed up out of nowhere, except for Cisco, who slouched deeper into his chair, refusing to look up at him.
“I didn’t say anything,” Harry lied and laughed, holding his arms up in defense to act innocent.
Cisco still hadn’t found the courage to comment, just giving him something that seemed like a supportive smile and nod. But Draco couldn’t care less in the state he was in. He could be himself. He felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long, long time. He found himself a home.
Everyone from Team Flash burst out laughing at the way he said it, Oliver just formed an “Oh” with his mouth and smiled.
Malfoy only gave him a shy smile and an appreciating nod in response, but Harry hadn’t finished just yet.
“We went to school together but lost contact over the years. He left England after school and moved to the USA. Simple as that,” Potter answered and behaved unaffected by the whole situation by shrugging his shoulders.
He lay his hand on his shoulder and gave it a tight squeeze, showing his supportive and caring nature to encourage Draco. But he was also swallowed up by guilt at the same time. Draco never deserved all the insults the golden trio called him behind his back. He was just a another teenager with problems he bottled up deep inside of him.
Harry was left standing in the middle of the room, mouth gaping like a fish you pulled out of the water. When he was released from his stiffness and was able to put one foot in front of the other, he walked up to Draco’s room. He opened his door a crack and stuck his head inside.
“When I turned eighteen, I felt ecstatic. I knew the moment I’d have to step over the threshold of my own house that everything was going to change. My father would’ve given me commands of how I would have to live my life from that day forward. So I-“
It didn’t hurt him to leave. The only thing that made him feel like he was dying from the inside was leaving the boy he was in love with behind. Potter.
She gave Draco a reassuring smile that didn’t make him feel less guilty and Cisco immediately closed his mouth. She was the one closest to him. Lying to her hurt him the most. Their friendship was uncomplicated, something that was necessary in a friendly relationship for Draco. He felt safe around her, not safe enough to tell her his secret, but still. It took him back to the time with Pansy, and he felt something pulling at his heart strings. When he said he never looked back at the people he left behind, he meant it.
“The bad side of you wasn’t what defined you! Who are you, Malfoy? The Draco I know wasn’t like this. In fact, he talked completely different, with words I’d need a thesaurus for. He walked elegantly. Proud and chin up, remember?”
And from this day, he kind of just belonged to the team. They would always come to him to seek for help when in need, and after a month passed, he was an important member of Team Flash. He got along better with Barry so they wouldn’t create any more awkwardness and uncomfortableness.
Draco nodded, not a tiny bit surprised at Harry’s sudden appearance.
Sure, he still didn’t make any new friends, but he was convinced he wouldn’t need them anyway. Until he found out about Barry Allen being The Flash. Central City’s superhero. Seriously, was there anything that wouldn’t make him hate that man more?
Next thing he remembered, they were at Draco’s place and he showed Potter around. His guest room wasn’t anything too special, just a simple king sized bed with nightstands on each side and a closet on the opposite wall. The walls were painted in a light blue tone that fit the pillows and blankets and made the room a little brighter compared to the dark blue curtains. Draco never expected to have someone over anyway so he held it as simple as possible.
They fell into silence after that, none of them wanted to overstrain the good atmosphere between them. The risk that they would fall back into their their normality back then during their school days. The peace between them just couldn’t be something constant and they were both fearing the moment their old quirks would come back to replace their friendly behavior towards each other.
Draco pondered for a bit. He considered them his friends, but could he really call them true friends when they didn’t even know who he truly was? Would they still call him friend if they were to ever find out? And even telling them his real name would mean he’s still keeping up a façade. He wasn’t Julian Albert. And he most certainly wasn’t a Muggle. He could pretend all he wanted, nothing was able to change who he really was.
“My point is, they don’t put this in the papers because they think it’s not good to let anyone know that you’re gay. Not even when they “changed” your “wrong behavior and beliefs”. I left England when I was able to leave the camp, I just turned eighteen and haven’t talked to my parents since. I brought as much distance between us as I could at that time,” he finished off his rant and the lie he fed. Not everything was a lie, he just changed big parts of it. That didn’t change the fact that he felt more horrible than with the simple lie of his name that was still not revealed.
“I’ll explain on the way,” Draco said.
Despite always wishing Harry would be gay and reciprocate his feelings one day, in that moment he prayed that it wasn’t the case. He knew how much a coming out meant to LGBT people, and he was now a person who possibly outed someone else.
He looked down and could see Cisco shaking his head in disapproval.
“Morning?” Draco said, but it came out as a question. He smiled and watched Harry flinch through not fully open eyes. Harry, who stared at him with wide eyes didn’t hear him entering the kitchen, but soon calmed down and put eggs and bacon on Draco’s plate.
He couldn’t shake off all the bad feelings from the night before like he usually did. There was something about everything that happened that made him feel anxious and he was still afraid that he would wake up every moment, coming to the conclusion that it was only a dream he had.
“Did you see if he had a scar on his forehead? Right over his right eye?” Draco asked in a hurry and almost choked on his own spit.
“Got that?” he repeated, mocking Draco’s voice in a horrible but entertaining way.
“Actually-“
“And you couldn’t try to be doing fine back in England?” he asked and Draco swore that he heard something like sadness in his voice.
“Will you ever tell them who you really are? I mean at least your name, not that you’re a wizard.”
Turning around and closing the door with a quiet clicking sound, his gaze fell on the many broken glass pieces, the large whiskey stain on the brick wall and the many objects scattered on the wooden floor. An inaudible “fuck!” escaped him when he saw Barry, Caitlin, Cisco and Iris staring at the immense mess he made.
Draco was about to burst out laughing but controlled himself and grabbed his jacket, not asking any questions like Cisco insisted.
“I guess,” was the only answer he could think off, hoping Potter would leave it at that.
Barry Allen.
“I thought we were done with digging around in people’s past? Seriously, get a fucking life.”
Walking over to the pile of vase fragments, Alamar grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment as well as a huge container. Harry tilted his head, looked over to Eric to see that he was still making breakfast, and jumped down from his chair.
Harry heard Ron call out how Luna even knew the password to enter their Common Room, and chuckled. Turning back to Neville, he decided to start his question over. “Hypothetically, if I wanted to ask someone out, but I had no idea if that person was even into me or if I don’t know them that well, how would you do it?”
When he had almost reached the dungeons, he heard footsteps behind him and sure enough – once again – Severus had gotten a hold of him and motioned for him to take the teddy bear. Draco sighed and shook his head.
Draco froze where he stood and exhaled.
“Do we know it?” Hannah asked and widened her eyes. “Maybe I know it. It could be my favorite pizzeria!”
Draco decides to tell Harry the reason he left England.
Any other time Draco would’ve found him hot like that, all heated and trying to stay calm instead of fighting with him. But this was a serious matter. The truth was, Draco didn’t intend to offend Potter, but he got it the wrong way. What he meant was: If a wizard found him with his normal magic, how short will it take the death eaters to find him with all kinds of dark magic?
“Next time you use super speed, do it while wearing a suit. Oh, another good advice for you: Don’t let your co-worker see it.”
“Oh, so because an old acquaintance is looking for me that means I’ll slowly kill every single one of you in your sleep?”
“If you think I’m here to tell you everything about my school life and the people in my life in the past, then you’re definitely wrong.”
The second thing Oliver asked was “Why the fuck are you guys so happy today?”
“Sure,” he agreed and sealed the deal.
“Go ahead, Potter.”
“Who the hell is Draco Malfoy?”
It wasn’t like Draco felt uncomfortable in the company of Harry, it was the complete opposite, really, but he didn’t know how to act around him either. What do you say to a person you kind of bullied from day one to the day you parted ways? He treated him badly until the very end, the only good thing he ever did to him was acting like he doesn’t know whether it’s Harry Potter or not in front of Voldemort. He was also a horrible person towards his best friends Weasley and Granger, making snarky comments about him being poor and her being a mud- a Muggle born.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
Draco had no idea what to do, if he would be honest to them and tell them every single detail, they might understand why he did what he had to do. On the other side, he wasn’t allowed to. Muggles aren’t supposed to know about magic.
“Someone like me? Excuse me, but I just warned your sorry ass,” Harry bit back through gritted teeth.
Damnit, he thought. And Harry wasn’t feeling better.
It turned out that Muggles weren’t what his father made them out to be. They weren’t as strong as wizards with magical powers, yes, but they were also interesting. Coming from a completely different world and never seeing something else than only that world, he was fascinated by the way life works on the other side of the two kinds of humans. Most of them didn’t believe in magic, and they weren’t able to use it, but they still found ways to go through their daily lives. They had their problems, too.
Draco looked up from the little sofa in the corner of the room and Harry gave him a reassuring smile.
He knew he said that to himself, but he was angry at himself for thinking something like that. And he was angry at his father for forcing him to become the person he was. An emotional, bitter wreck that wasn’t able to control itself.
“Malfoy, do you think they know something?”
“I don’t know. How could I make them understand why I did what I did without telling them why I did it?” he reasoned, hoping his words made any sense.
“So, how are we going to do this? You got a good plan once in your life or are you just going to, I don’t know, stick to my ass and follow me the whole time?” Draco changed the topic and continued skewing his food with the silverware fork in his hand.
He was under his desk, looking for the pen that rolled over the edge of the table, wishing that it wasn’t as risky as it was to just use his wand and cast a simple Accio. Then, suddenly, like a tornado flew through the room, the wind threw all his papers around the room, a lot of them landing right in front of him on the floor. He looked up and standing there was no other than Barry Allen, grabbing his stuff and with an audible whoosh and orange lighting he was out the room, causing wind once again. Draco crawled back to his chair and looked totally gobsmacked, not fully believing what just happened right in front of his eyes.
His mouth dropped open in horror. Barry and the rest of the Scooby gang were the last people he expected to turn up on his doormat. They smiled at him, but the concern was written all over their faces. Draco backed away, making them room to step in. As soon as they didn’t see him, he wiped the tears on his face away.
“Julian, because of yesterday. You don’t need to worry about it, we didn’t tell anyone,” he started, his hands on each side of his waist. “And to the coming out which Cisco forced you to, I wish that would’ve gone differently, but- Just know that it won’t change a thing, huh? I support you, gay or not. And I know for a fact that the rest of the team wouldn’t make a big deal out of it either. I don’t want you to feel like anyone here wouldn’t accept you the way you are, because I do, and the other idiots in there do too.”
Right in front of him, only a few feet away, he stood. Harry Potter.
“Got it, Mr fun police.”
“And?”
“Potter, what are you doing here?” he whispered although the other ones were out of reach to hear anything.
He cleared his throat, indicating that he was about to say something. He wanted to get this over with, so he opened his mouth and started to explain himself with a monotone voice:
“Just wait until you meet Oliver Queen,” Draco said, smiling at the lack of knowledge coming from someone who grew up in the Muggle world.
“I hated that I had to let my mum down by never coming back home without saying goodbye, but the majority of my early life was filled with taking commands and compulsively trying to be someone I would never be, while my mother let it happen. So I grabbed my important belongings and left Hogwarts with no particular destination. I had to make a lot of sacrifices to be where I am today, I left friends behind. Pansy hurt the most. I lied about my identity, a Muggle of all people put here helping me getting it in the first place. I had the feeling back then that it would come back to bite me in the ass one day, but I never felt as relieved as I felt when I was a thousand and more miles away from my past. The feeling of suffocating in my own four walls left when I arrived in Central City.”
Harry looked around for a second, asking himself who he’s talking to when he remembered that Draco was Julian. An audible sigh escaped him and he was about to open his mouth when someone rudely interrupted him.
Next thing he knew was that he ended up in a much smaller room with computers and more Muggle technology and scientific tools. Then, right there in a little niche of the wall, was the shining red suit of Central City’s most loved meta.
No surprise they get tricked all the time, Draco thought, almost rolling his eyes but knowing better than that.
“How-“
“Okay, “just Harry”,” Joe began, using quotation marks with his fingers. “How are you able to breach?”
He hadn’t started yet, when a beeping alarm drew away his attention from his paperwork. He instantly recognized it as the meta alarm app sound. With the blink of an eye, Barry was gone, leaving the papers flying around for Draco to pick up and take care of. Just the usual Tuesday, Draco thought and got back to work.
“That’s the Potter I know. We wouldn’t want it any different, huh?” he tried to reassure him, telling him it’s no big deal, they could still come up with something, after all.
It was Cisco’s turn to ask a question now. The question Draco hoped he wouldn’t ask.
“I’m gay.”
Barry tried to stop the argument, but instead he made everything worse, everyone started to speak and yell at once after he spoke up. Then, something that Draco very well knew as Apparition, silenced them. He started to panic, Potter was the only person that knew who he was, the only person who was able to accidentally reveal his secret by calling him Malfoy in front of everyone.
“Are you sure? Because if you-“
Draco turned around, Barry came walking in, still in his suit. In his mind he shook his head, he couldn't believe that Allen was repeating the same mistake and exposing himself once again. This time to Potter, a complete stranger to him. And they thought that they got played with is because they trusted the wrong people?
“Oh.”
“Does that mean we can talk about guys?” she happily exclaimed.
I don’t feel too sure about this chapter, so please, feel free to give me honest feedback in the comments!
“Wait, so you really are working with the Muggle police? My, my, Malfoy, never knew you secretly liked the Muggles.”
“That’s actually a pretty funny story.”
Later that day, when everyone was back to normal, they were invited to join Team Arrow for dinner.
If only he knew that I did it because I loved him, Draco thought.
Draco suppressed a sigh of relief when he looked at him, the same shining green eyes, the same raven hair, the same glasses that always made him look good in his own, unique way. He didn’t change all too much, but he looked more mature, grown up. All the weight Draco carried on his shoulder over the past ten years seemed to lift and he tried not to show the happiness he felt tingling in every part of his body. A wave of excitement rushed through him, the worries about missing Potter and everything else long forgotten.
“And for your information, I stopped disliking you the day you saved me from Voldemort, ignoring how dangerous it could’ve been for you and your parents,” he admitted, not daring to look at the man in front of him as he felt a light blush creeping onto his cheeks.
“You know exactly what happened in the past!” Cisco yelled furiously.
“Look, guys,” he said, still searching for a good enough explanation for the situation he was in. He didn’t want them to know that he was indeed vulnerable like any other human being, after all, the nonchalant attitude that Draco always had defined him. He wasn’t one to talk about stuff going on in his head. He wanted to get rid of the nervousness and the people that showed up at his place without sending a text. He felt like a big and the most important part of his privacy has been invaded by them seeing this. It was like they looked into his soul by only seeing his living room in this condition: Thrown around, stained and broken into many, many pieces.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oliver” he only said. Blaise smirked, knowing just as well that this shop owner seemed to have a third eye for animals and he clearly knew that this household was the perfect one for this cat.
Sadly their new kitchen wasn’t as big as the other one anymore, though still with enough space to place down a table. However, the couch had to go into another room. On the bottom floor were next to the kitchen, a dining room and a somewhat sizable living room, two offices and an animal play room.
Harry yawned and untangled himself from Draco. “I’m tired, so I’ll see you guys tomorrow.”
Severus huffed. “I had no idea. Though in all honesty, I hadn’t talked to either of them.”
“Is there nothing else, I can do for you? Nothing I could improve?”
Minerva cleared her throat and placed the quill on the table. “Harry, I’m just asking out of curiosity… Is everything working out fine in your marriage?” she asked and furrowed her brow, looking at him as if she thought she had to play a marriage counselor.
“But I don’t like things that are…” Draco stopped and tried to find a word that would probably describe his constant need to control everything, his fear of messing up and his wish to be brave in one.
“Oh you mean, us running away from danger?” Harry offered and snorted. Hermione rolled her eyes at him and shoved him slightly.
Wet snow clung to his shoes as he apparated right outside of the gate to Malfoy Manor. Draco stood still for a second and stared at his childhood home. It looked so… out of place. Forlorn almost. The iron gates were locked firmly into place and the ancient magical family wards lay dormant like a huge dog after a meal, just waiting for someone to invade them. Then again, last time someone else took over, the wards did nothing.
Minerva nodded and looked at the decoder interested, before she turned to Eric. “Yes, Russia is rather well adapted to young wizards and witches.”
Kevin stood next to him again and shook his head. “I will never be able to understand this craft. Even trying to find a perfect couple is complicated, but this...?! They never said anything about rose pedals falling from the sky! How in Merlin’s name did you figure out that they wanted that?!”
“Two things?” Harry sniggered. “Yes, so
“I know, but… I mean, I have memories now and they’re all so weird and bad.” He stopped, taking a sip from his cup and looked up at Draco as if he was assessing him. “Did you make fun of me because I didn’t have parents?”
Harry let himself fall onto a chair and let his coughing fit go. The cough was so violent, that he held his stomach, which already hurt from the two apparitions he had done today. His lungs and rib cage had long ago started to get used to his daily caughing fits. He tasted blood and leaned over the floor to not get it all over his things. Draco stared at him utterly shell-shocked.
“If he falls into the lake, I’ll tell Severus about this.” Draco threatened, though Pansy winked at him, before they walked out of the Common Room, leaving Draco to go and fetch the potions from his godfather. Hopefully, there wasn’t any Veritaserum used this time.
“Nope, you’re free to leave. Tomorrow you can read through the paperwork and sign it if you’re happy with it.” Harry sat down by his desk and grabbed an empty parchment, starting the field report.
Harry laughed. “Well, then I also can’t promise anything.” He turned around and looked at the beach, where the waves were softly breaking. The sound of water had always had a rather calming effect on him. As he turned around he felt Malfoy’s eyes on him and he smirked. “I’ll go check up on these two idiots, in hopes that they haven’t killed each other.”
Frowning, Harry looked at Draco. He hadn’t had much experience with pregnancy but from what he had heard from Hermione’s two pregnancies, it had taken her more time until she realized she was pregnant. As he looked at his husband, it seemed as if he had read his mind.
Harry nodded. “A small one, yes. And no matter how I tried to… to get that conversation going, it always ended in a fight or something like that. But Mirjam helped us talking about it.”
Neville was fighting hard to keep his grin hidden and he couldn’t bite it down for too long, before he snorted. “Harry, there really isn’t any berry inside.”
Now it was Draco’s turn to hide from food, though he just blocked the oncoming attack from Pansy and made the food float down onto the table again. “But we talked about all kinds of shit, Draco! Why didn’t you tell me?!”
“I love you, my handsome snake” Harry whispered. “One word and we’ll stop, okay?”
“Is that a threat?!” Draco placed his hands on his hips and was swiftly taken away by Pansy who tore him into the other direction, while Ron did the same with Harry.
“I understand” Hermione said and smiled. “Ron and I also think about getting a dog. He misses having a pet, I think.”
Neville Longbottom
Nott huffed and shook his head. “Well, look at that, it actually has something to do with you, Potter. What a surprise.” He turned to Ron and smirked. “We should try to find another way out of here, wouldn’t you agree? We’ll never find a way down here.”
“It’s not for me...” And he almost slipped up by calling him
“I’m sorry” Harry said sarcastically and rolled his eyes. “He got the better of me. It’s just…” He sighed and pulled his wrist out of Ron’s grip. “He just gets to me sometimes.”
And well, who had the time to study, when you had to take care of a child day and night?! If he wanted to study as much as Hermione would, next to taking care of Harry… he probably had to ignore sleep for an entire school year to catch up to this stupid topic.
Draco chuckled and shook his head. “I wish I knew. My mind keeps bringing me to weird places.”
Minerva smirked and shook her head. “I have been meaning to ask you about your schedule, so we can come up with possible times on when you’re here and we can look into everything that goes into being a headmaster of a school together, including hiring your own staff.”
“Dray” he voice had a warning sign in it and Draco sighed again, sitting up.
“You were right, Mr. Malfoy” Madam Pomfrey said as she looked at the parchment. “He’s just reached his fifteenth month.”
Pulling Draco closer, Harry chuckled. “We can always go home, I want you to know that I’m not mad if you want to leave, okay?”
Harry shook his head and looked at his bandage. “But it was so real! And I… I was bleeding!”
“Should you be discussing anything in the grey area of legality, I would suggest you do it somewhere no one could listen in and tell the Aurors about, Mr. Potter.”
Draco chuckled. “You’re too Gryffindor for your own good, Harry. Stupid, brave, bold, idiotic, did I mention stupid?” He grinned. “Jumping into a relationship head first instead of checking every angle and…”
Lily was explaining her drawing and Severus was listening intently, while Harry crossed his legs and leaned back, smiling at Draco, having their baby on his arms. After a while, Lily went back to drawing quietly – while singing to herself.
About two hours later, Draco groaned and got out of bed. He grabbed his absolute favorite jumper, which Severus had given him once they had been father and son, and he walked out into the dark Common Room. It looked as if the House Elves had been there, since it looked spotless once more.
“I do what I can” Neville retorted and shrugged his shoulders. “Go, sleep a little and I’ll see what kind of chaos I can create.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes and thought. She was just about to say something, when the door to the Common Room opened and Luna entered the room. She stopped and smiled at them. “Sorry, the Nargles led me here. Wrong Common Room. Enjoy your evening.”
Sighing, Draco nodded and got up. “You know I will be back tomorrow night, right?”
Luckily for them, Longbottom just walked out of the Common Room and stopped dead in his track, when he saw them. “Oh… um hi.” He raised his eyebrows. “Anything I can help you with?”
“Likewise, Draco.”
“Peter? What’s going on?” He really hoped that this man hadn’t once again messed up everything. For some weird reason, he had a tendency for always doing the one thing that was uncalled for in almost every situation.
“You’re thinking too much, Draco” Harry whispered softly and pulled him closer again.
Otherwise, I can tell you that coming Tuesday my schedule is back to normal and I should have a little more time on my hands. But I really do want to answer your questions and comments, so please bear with me... :)
“I wasn’t even supposed to be there, that day.” Harry played with the pasta on his plate, when he said it. He felt Draco staring at him and looked up.
“What are you doing here? How did you even find me?”
What he and basically nobody else knew was that the picture wasn’t faked. No, Harry didn’t have the Dark Mark on his arm, but Draco did. And the way the picture was taken, Draco was hiding behind him, and his arm was in such an angle that it looked as if this arm belonged to Harry. How Skeeter had been so unlucky to take a picture like that was a miracle to him.
Love you all! Especially you, Dray.
“Miss Granger” the Auror witch said as she turned to Hermione, completely ignoring her question. “We are aware of the fact that you have been brewing Polyjuice Potion as a Potions project.”
“Dada?” Teddy asked, before seemingly realizing that this was not his father. “Fend!”
Harry laughed and put his arms around the Slytherin’s neck. “I don’t mind. I just don’t want to be pressured into something anymore.”
His mother chuckled. “Thank you. Oh, but what are you wearing, Draco? That won’t do for tonight. Please, go to your room and change into what I have placed there.”
“I assume, Mr. Snape can confirm that, but losing one’s name has a lot of pain during the process” Kingsley explained. “People are known to have lost their conscious and others are too weak to use any more magic. So, it was used to strip people of their magic and name to finally win over someone who can’t fight back.”
Looking up, Eric was shell-shocked. “What?”
Harry nodded. “Yes, Severus really cares about you. I can tell.”
shouldn’t be our problem any longer.” His voice was so contempt. He loved this devilish plan with every fibre of his being.
showing interest in this story by commenting or giving kudos or just reading it up until now. I’m happy I can give you a little happiness through this story. And you give me a smile every time I read a comment or see that people gave kudos, so thank you so much! Enjoy the chapter!
Harry chuckled softly. “Don’t freak out, guys. It’s not even a bad thing!”
Raising his eyebrows, Draco couldn’t stop himself, from grinning. “So, you want me to lie to my own godfather?”
“Draco?” Pansy slightly pushed his shoulder. “Come on, darling, you know you can tell me anything!”
Well, whatever it was these two Gryffindors (or Gryffindor and Gryffindor-turned-Snake) had planned; Pansy and Draco had to wait for a little longer to find out. And Harry was better going to say he was sorry for not being there for the past week for him. But yes, that was the only reason Draco was okay with having to wait. Harry would soon be in his arms again.
Could you maybe help me in finding out what it means? I’m really confused by it and I can’t seem to figure out why I don’t have a swallow anymore. Not that I’m complaining much, since I am rather proud of this animal, but still. I’m utterly confused.
“This is awesome!” Harry called out and the stag jumped as if it had been watching Draco closely and completely ignored the other person in the room.
Draco chuckled softly, his arms wrapping tightly around Harry’s waist as he pulled him closer. “I love you too, Harry.” He pressed a soft kiss on his forehead.
, bear. Pansy is correct: he died. So now he can’t hurt anybody ever again” Draco explained and smiled encouragingly at his ward.
“He’s not my boyfriend!” Pansy glared again. “But that would be very nice of you” she added sheepishly.
“Everything is resolved. And if he takes the potions, there won’t be any repercussions” the Druid stated and smiled. “I was even able to heal the scar on his forehead. It’s still there, but not as visible and weirdly shaped. The scar was apparently a place to hide a curse and since Dwarfbart removed the curse, everything is fine.”
When he looked at the Headmistress, she once again looked so tired and old. Was she feeling okay? Had she ever looked like that when Harry had been younger? He couldn’t remember.
Remus laughed. “Well, whoever did that,
“We are supposed to be civil to each other, I promised Ron, so I thought I take this as an opportunity and talk to Malfoy” Harry explained.
“How do you know when the ball is?” Draco wondered and found the answer then quickly by himself. “Mother invited you, didn’t she?”
“You have secrets?” Ron wondered and frowned at him.
Draco quickly looked over to Harry and Lily, playing with Merlin, and chuckled. He also turned to see Caellum still sleeping deeply, before opening the letter.
And the kitten said: ‘No, you can go from here! Follow the path and you’ll end up at the school.’

“What Mister Malfoy is wolfing down looks rather good, I’d like to try one of these as well.”
Both Gryffindors shook their heads. Draco smirked and turned to Harry. “What if we play a game? Three questions, two answers are right one is wrong.”
Sorry, I’m busy and no you cannot have my Moontrimmer. It’s my pride and joy. And the only one still in existence.
“I fear that people only see me as the things I have done in the past. Not the person I am. The person I became because of everything that I did” he said quietly. Harry looked up at him and nodded.
Pansy smiled at him. “Of course, you have to. The person who thinks you’re the love of his life is there.”
Harry was just about to ask if she didn’t want him to bet better, when Ginny held up her hands. “Don’t even try to say that, Harry. I know exactly what you’re trying to ask. I just want you to relax a little. Is it so hard to do nothing?”
“Thanks.” He smiled and left the Headmistress’ office and walked straight to the Room of Requirement, where Draco was lying on the floor in a very soft looking carpet. Padfoot saw him and raced over before the Slytherin even realized they were in the room. His shocked scream made Harry snort as he closed the door.
“Fred, stop thinking bad of him. Harry actually really likes Malfoy and the Slytherin clan can’t seem to stop talking about him!” Weaslette said.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “I think fifth year is going to suck. And I’m constantly afraid that people ignore me for some reason.”
Nodding, Draco confirmed Potter’s question, which made him cuss again. “Shit, I am very sorry. So sorry, I’ll talk to her.”
Draco rubbed his temples and yawned. “And did you have to do it while I was here?”
“Boy!”
Once again, Theodore was asking the questions: “So, when you went to the Ministry, you were looking for a Horcrux there?”
Harry smiled innocently. “Thanks. I didn’t know if I should buy them, they were expensive. But I think sometimes you just need to buy nice things.”
His ward flinched and Draco widened his eyes. What was going on?
Draco almost spit out the water, when he quickly swallowed it started to laugh. He looked up at Harry and shook his head. “As sad as it is, Harry, you never were my hero. Well, one time in the Room of Requirement, but that was all. I don’t need a hero in my life.”
Ginny smirked. “Okay, see you then. Neville, tell us how it goes!”
The last sentence was met with silence. Everyone shut up and turn to Lovegood who smiled at little Harry, as he climbed back up the couch, sitting down next to Draco. The toddler beamed at Draco, clearly unaware of what was happening, while he grabbed a fork full of the Treacle Tart.
And the Gryffindor also didn’t look any better. His hair was much more chaotic than ever and there was an unknown fear in his eyes. Even though his clothes looked normal, Draco knew that there was something wrong.
His godfather nodded. “Your… former mother kept trying to fire call me. Last night, I finally accepted the call; it went as you would have guessed.”
Draco caught it and Pansy threw him a thankful look, before turning to the boy around her leg. “Hi darling! How was your day?”
“I don’t like it.”
That comment made Harry look up at the castle. “He had?” Did he really have a panic attack or was it just played? If he really did have one, there should have been a message on his phone. Harry took it out and checked his texts – nothing. Well, nothing new, so his husband was pretending. Good man! “Why would he have a panic attack?”
Draco jumped up and pulled him into a hug, before he could get away. His warm body so close, the scent of his aftershave and the calming motion of Draco’s hand stroking over his back was enough to completely break Harry.
“Around thirty items and no, not everything should make you throw up.” Draco raised his eyebrows as if he had already anticipated that question, which was fair. Harry had just opened his mouth to ask that exact question.
“Potter, what did you do to open the door?” Nott asked and rubbed the back of his neck.
His godfather brought over some tea and sat down himself. “You don’t have to talk, Draco. But I believe you might need a little comfort. And if having a cup of tea with your old godfather helps, so be it.”
Draco watched Harry very closely and saw him actually faking a somewhat sad expression. It was so believable that had he not spent the last few months with him, he would have never seen the small sparks in his eyes and the miniscule jerk of his lips.
Draco held up his hands in defeat and smirked. “I won’t say a word.”
Sitting up on his chair, Harry looked at Draco, before he got up and grabbed some wine from a cupboard. He knew the house elves were hiding wine and whiskey in there for the professors. Draco and him had found that in their last year, when they had snuck around with the Invisibility Cloak and one of the thousands of DADA professors had taken some while they had been hiding in the kitchen.
“High Executor Nelson” Draco started and looked at her interested. “Do you know why the will has never been read? In the letter I received from James Potter it stated that there was a copy of the will…”
“Wow” Draco commented and ate another string of spaghetti slowly just to annoy the man. “I never thought someone could be so... complacent.”
Draco didn’t wait for him to finish, even though he was hurting his etiquette slightly. “I don’t care about what happened when he was young, Severus. I want to know why you have a teddy bear for him, why you in fact have a playpen in here and why you actually care for Potter!”
“No, I...” Harry was now interrupting Alamar and he smiled. “I really want to be with you guys. I like it here and I feel weirdly safe.”
Well, there was nothing easier. Alamar pressed the door handle and it opened through the power of the welcoming vampire spirit emitting from the door mat. Whoever had invented them and made them normal was Alamar’s favourite person – well right after Eric, of course.
, Draco thought, shaking his head, suppressing the need to tell him to get lost.
What if... what if something like that was going to happen tonight? What if he couldn’t get out of the prison he would usually build in his nightmares? What if for some reason they wouldn’t let Draco in his Dormitory and he would... die because of it?!
Draco denied it immediately. “Nope. Just seriously scare them.”
Ginny, are you home? Can I come over and talk?
Pansy shook her head. “That can’t be true, right? He knows not to do something so stupid.”
“That was by far not perfect, but whatever” Draco grinned and got up. He pulled the green ring out his pocket and put it over Harry’s finger.
“Harry, where did you go?” he asked.
“It’s not even five o’clock!” Blaise called out and laughed, when Draco shoved him again.
Pansy interrupted him right before he was able to talk about what he was dreaming off. “What were they about?”
Shrugging his shoulders, Neville looked from Draco to Harry. “If you really want to, but I think you should concentrate more on your fake divorce proceedings with Harry.”
Draco groaned and pulled the blanked over his head, drowning out Pansy. He should have known better than to ignore her, as his blanked vanished and he glared at his best friend.
He only had to walk for five minutes, wherein he almost reached the castle entrance, when he heard fast steps approaching and Padfoot turned happily. It was indeed Draco who raced towards them and didn’t even slow down for a second as he threw himself around Harry’s neck.
“So how about next Saturday?”
“This is crazy!” Dean said, shaking his head. “How did we not see that?! You played us all like a piano, like Daphne said!”
His best friend laughed and shook her head. “Ron would definitely love his own Quidditch team! He wants to have a huge family and I can’t really say anything against it. Growing up alone, I’ve always wanted my children to have siblings.”
Draco quickly and half asleep cast the tempus charm to see that it wasn’t even seven o’clock yet. “Pans, go back to your room and sleep!” he muttered and turned his back to his best friend. He should have known that this would never work on Pansy. She grinned at him and shook her head, pulling him back to his original state.
Chuckling, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Well, I wasn’t happy at all. And you telling me to stick to my Auror career wasn’t really what I needed then.”
think it’s weird or problematic?”
Draco tilted his head. “You are far better at this game than I would have ever imagined.”
Looking back at the parchment, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “No idea. But it seemed a long time ago. I don’t think I could write something like that.”
Blaise stopped eating and eyed Ginny suspiciously. Draco frowned.
Before he could have said something, Malfoy was already climbing up. Harry followed quickly and after a few rounds on this spiral staircase, they ended up on what seemed like the top of the house.
Weasley still seemed to lack the knowledge and simply shrugged his shoulders. “Look, guys. I came here because you told me that you wanted to thank him for what he did for you. You all have owls... just write him a letter.”
“Yes, have you heard about Scott Davis? They imprisoned him and...” they entered the Common Room, so Harry couldn’t continue eavesdropping.
“Of course she is” Harry laughed and shook his head.  What else would she be doing?! He turned back to Hermione and smiled. “By the way, are you trying to outdo Molly and Arthur, ‘Mione? Or do you simply want to have your own Quidditch team?”
Draco looked at him, before he started laughing. “She told me, if I was going to break your heart, I should think about moving somewhere, where none of her family can ever find me. And then she proceeded to tell me where on the world everyone was living.” He frowned at Harry. “I honestly don’t understand what I’m supposed to do with this information.”
Sophie nodded, while Draco took the vial out of her hand.
Snorting, Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, that’s only normal when I’m at Hogwarts. I’m never safe.”
He smiled at them and started walking quicker. “If you excuse me, I’ll need to find the Headmistress and beg for Padfoot’s presence.”
Walking out of his bedroom, he almost smiled for the first time in this apartment. It had taken quite a lot of time apparently.
“I believe that was for twenty-four hours.”
“We’re wizards, love. We can figure out if our significant others are pregnant or not. Especially as gay couples, you need to know fast. A man’s body isn’t really made for a pregnancy, so you need to ingest a certain potion each day. If you forget, you could lose the child” he sighed and pulled Harry closer to kiss his temple. “Which was another reason why I wanted to be the one who had the child, so you didn’t have to take one of these disgusting potions each day. I guess your friends decided that for us.”
Kevin nodded and walked into his own office, while Harry turned back to the dark brown haired wizard at the front desk. He caught Maria glancing at the man in front of her slightly interested. Well, in his fairly elegant dark blue Muggle suit and the nicely kept hair, he did look rather handsome. That was also how Harry had fallen for him.
A wide smile crossed Draco’s face and he rolled his eyes playfully. He offered his hand for a handshake.
His friends weren’t convinced, but they decided to leave him on his own anyway. If he wanted to be alone, there’s nothing they can do to help him. And Cisco was still convinced that there was more to the story than “Julian” told them. They closed the door and left Draco with all his questions and doubts behind.
He missed him. He missed magic.
Draco just scoffed, the conversation was done for him.
“All jokes aside, are you happy? I mean- Yeah, that went into a deep direction. But seriously, are you genuinely happy with your life and the people in it? These people back there seemed like they’re nice, you know,” Harry rambled and gave him a sincere smile when he finished.
By the time his alarm ringed, he was already sitting on his bed fully dressed and ready to go. He walked down the hall, following the noise that came from outside his room and shortly afterwards he saw Potter in front of the stove, cooking something that smelled like bacon.
They stepped back into the room where the rest of the team waited for them. Draco stayed calm and spoke quietly:
“Yeah,” he admitted sheepishly and his shoulders sagged down.
His look landed on Caitlin, who looked somewhat disappointed but mouthed the words “I’m proud of you” with the typical small Caitlin smile. Draco didn’t think about the obvious disappointment for too long, as he was pulled into an embrace from behind, his back pressed against a chest, by H.R. whom he hadn’t even noticed standing behind him the whole time.
“Should I- Uh, should I leave you guys alone?” Harry asked and awkwardly shuffled with his feet.
So instead of sitting back down, he stopped in the doorframe. He cleared his throat to get everyone’s attention. He contemplated the words best to use, secretly wishing Harry would be there for it, reassuring him by a tight squeeze of his shoulder like before. Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined to need the quirky Potter.
It was one of those moments when he sat in his armchair in front of a fire that radiated enough warmth to make him feel cozy, a good old firewhiskey in his hand and music he bought at a muggle store played silently in the background.
However, that left Draco to himself and he had some free time to think about the feelings Potter once again awoke inside of him. He wasn’t unaffected with the way Potter treated him like he never did anything bad and Draco couldn’t forget how attentive he’s been the night before. He listened, not faking his interest and will to help. He could still hear the echoes of their laughs mixed together when they shook hands after eighteen years in his head. He wished he could get used to that sound one day. He wanted to see the man smile and wrinkle his eyes for the rest of his life.
“I mean he does have a point,” H.R. defended Draco while he played with his drumsticks in the meantime and sipped on a drink from Jitters.
“Yet,” he whispered.
“As far as I’m concerned, you guys are the most accepting and supportive people,” he started, giving Barry a quick smile who reciprocated it and gave him two thumbs up. The rest eyeing the two suspiciously. Cisco shifted in his chair uncomfortably, fearing the words Draco was about to say. “And Barry told me it would be okay to tell you as soon as I’m ready, which I am. I’m-“ He took a deep breath. “I’m gay.”
Oh boy, was he wrong.
“I’m not even going to try and ask how you found out, Julian. Follow me,” he said and covered his face with his hand for a second, obviously knowing that this was all Barry’s fault and Barry’s fault only.
But he didn’t care, his father was in the past. And what’s in the past stays in the past. Except for one special person who has always been close to Draco’s heart: Harry Potter.
“It’s just Harry. Just Harry,” he said, cringing at the way Cisco said his name.
“I’m Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
Draco nodded and gulped audibly. He had tears in his eyes and his hands were shaking. It took Harry a lot to not grab his hands out of nowhere.
Harry laughed softly, sounding convincing enough to everyone else. Draco was the only one in the room who knew that it wasn’t what his laugh sounded like. His real laugh was warm, contagious and made Draco’s stomach erupt in butterflies. Often enough he has heard it echoing in the stone old walls of the hallways at Hogwarts. And more than just a couple of things had he wished that, one day, he would be the reason for his beautiful laugh.
“Potter,” Draco whined and did all he could to look embarrassed. “If you tell them I will beat your ass back to England.”
Barry is supportive about him being gay.
I really love this chapter and I hope you do too.
Harry was surprised at the honest answer. He couldn’t remember a single conversation between the two of them where they talked like they didn’t hate each other. He enjoyed being around Malfoy like this. Still, he told himself not to get used to it all too quick.
Despite not thinking about Muggles as mudbloods anymore, he didn’t change all too much over the past ten years. His face still remained nonchalant most of the time and even though he left Potter, his nemesis during school, behind, he had a new person he argued with most of the time.
Dear Draco,
After about five minutes, in which Draco was sure, Harry had tried to remember as much as possible about his parents or even his friends, he finally spoke up. “So what happens when someone’s dead? I mean, what happens to these vaults?” Harry looked at Draco questioningly.
“In a huge castle? Surrounded by interested children? There is no privacy! But tell me! He didn’t say who you’ve met. I won’t say a word, you know me!” Hermione begged and Harry chuckled. He couldn’t say no. Not when Hermione seemed to be genuinely interested.
His ward looked almost as if he was dreaming when he answered. “You’re loud and ob… ub…” he frowned and shook his head, apparently having a hard word to say, before he continued. “… ob-noc-us…”
“Manager of everything?” Draco repeated and frowned. “What do you mean?”
Draco groaned and fell into his chair again, another tear running over his face. Harry kneeled on the floor, grabbing his hands. “Dray, what’s going on? Tell me!”
“Are you okay, Harry?” Alamar asked and walked back around the corner to look at him.
Draco smirked and motioned to Harry. His ward seemed to know what Draco wanted, as he started to talk and explain. “Well, I found a letter from my father talking about his vaults. And I realized that there was a vault that I didn’t need and I think the person it belongs to is dead...”
Jason nodded. “From what I’ve heard, they don’t need to be. They’re up to their ears in work all year long. My friend Marcus told me, he wanted to book an appointment, but he had to wait almost six months for that to happen, so he looked for something else.”
Draco was floored. Something like that was possible? Maybe like that Harry wouldn’t immediately start to hate him when he turned eleven...
“So, do I get your majesty’s approval then?” he asked and smirked.
Draco sighed. “I know, but it feels weird.”
“Here?” Harry asked amused, though he felt Draco pulling him back into the castle and down into the dungeon. There were a few rooms down there which hadn’t been used – at least when they had last been at Hogwarts, so Harry knew exactly where they were going.
Draco smirked and turned to look at the watch at the wall. “Okay, I have a quite a few things to prepare for the photo shoot today. Are you interested in helping me?”
Draco stayed quiet, knowing too well that whatever he would say next would be harmful not only to the relationship to his father, but also towards his mother. And she did somewhat accept his life choices – she was at least trying to get him a nice pureblood wizard and not a witch.
Harry sighed. “I really want to leave.”
see the value in being friends with him.”
Sighing, Draco grabbed his coke and sipped at it. “I don’t think I’d mind. I just can’t stand then if they’re too arrogant.”
“Please don’t tell Harry, that you’ve got this information from us. He’s trying to stay undetected and I would hate for him to find out that I gave him away.”
Draco looked at Longbottom, while a grin spread across his face. “Longbottom, what you don’t realize is that if you tell me where and when the next date is, I will make sure to be there as well. I might bring some more people and we will be checking on you two the whole time.” He smirked. “Do you still want to tell me about...”
“Sure, Anna’s looking forward to playing with Padfoot.”
Just then, he saw the one person he had never thought he would see again right outside. Harry freaking Potter. He hurried through the rain and waved to someone and just as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone again.
Harry sighed, before he seemed to be able to answer. “I don’t even need to try. I know I can’t sleep.”
His mother smiled and looked at her husband, before she turned back to look at him. “He wants to talk to you as well.”
Anyway, enjoy this chapter :)
“Hermione, this doesn’t make sense!” Ron growled and brought Harry out of his state of mind. He looked up to find his friend about to throw the book around. “Why would they start a law against whatever these blood potions are, when they haven’t even been tested by that time?!”
It turned out... they didn’t. Harry found Seamus and Dean walking through the halls very quickly.
The Gryffindor grinned. “On that rather fateful day where Seamus made a huge mistake, both of us said that we had other ideas of relationships. Most likely… same sex relationships.”
Draco turned to Charlie and frowned slightly. “Is it dangerous?”
“My kind?” Harry asked, shutting up quickly when Draco raised his eyebrows again.
Harry frowned, before he grinned. “No, I think I’ll ask her tonight.”
Harry looked at Draco and smiled broadly. “I want him! He’s perfect.”
His best friend smiled softly. “Why did you never tell us you had a therapy dog?” she asked then.
Lucius inhaled and nodded. “Well, your mother and…”
Since Draco was slightly freaked out, Pansy and Theodore had chosen to accompany him and Harry. It was always best to have a few more people around who could help you, should anything happen. And if McGonagall had something to say against Harry living with the Slytherins, at least he wasn’t alone to challenge that. Nobody wanted to be against Pansy and with Theodore’s knowledge that could very well rival Hermione’s, Draco was sure he’d win the fight.
When Pansy seemed happy that they were not hexing each other and walked towards Blaise, Harry and Draco reacted almost at the same time, throwing wandless magic at the other. Harry almost laughed loudly when their spells collided mid-air and hit the walls. They had grown so close that they even reacted almost identical.
It wasn't even hard anymore to pretend to glare at him. It was hard however, to keep a straight face when Draco returned the look.
“Most likely” McGonagall smiled. She looked at Padfoot who sat down on the carpet with a tilted head. Harry looked behind him and ruffled his fur.
Harry hummed and pulled Draco closer. “Unless you want me to go to my own room.” His eyes were closed and he did not let go Draco. It was as if he wanted to let Draco know that there was nothing which would make him let go of him.
So he cleared his throat and motioned to the chair on the other side of his desk. Once she sat there and looked at him expectantly, he smiled with an intentional sparkle in his eyes. This always made people relax around him.
Kind regards,
“Maybe you just think you’re constantly hungry?” Theodore offered as they finally sat down in their secret spot again. Growing up with them should have gotten his hunger under control, right?
Draco wanted to say something else, when Charlie simply continued. “It’s the memory, Draco. He’s now going through everything. That might take a while.” She smiled. “Anyone up for some tea? It will take approximately fifteen minutes until he’s back in reality.”
Harry smiled into his chest and placed his arms around his husband’s neck. “You know, we still haven’t talked about what McGonagall told me about our living arrangements when I’d take over as headmaster.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever truly been in love. I mean, I remember I’ve had a few relationships, but… It’s all really weird and there are a few weird feelings smashed together. So…”
“Right” Pansy said for the second time this morning. And once again, Harry felt as if she knew exactly what was going on here.
Now it was his father’s turn to cross the arms in front of his chest. “I can and I will! You’ve fooled around for long enough; it’s time to get serious. So unless you show me a worthy man of your own, I will do what’s necessary to give you a future. With a wife.”
Pansy narrowed her eyes in thought. “What do you want to do in the future? I mean, don’t you want to move in with your Gryffindor friends?”
In this week, Draco had been able to take Potter to all the private classes. Blaise had accepted looking after Potter in his free period, where Draco had to go to class for the Study of Ancient Runes. Well, Pansy had gladly looked after her new boyfriend – which was how Draco called Potter in front of her – when he had to go to Astronomy.
Finally, she started speaking. “I need you to brew a nutrient-rich potion. I’m well aware that Mr. Potter’s fast aging makes it a little hard, however, I believe that we can start giving him this potion before he turns four years old.”
“You are the messiest wizard I know, Potter” Malfoy smirked. “No other wizard I know would keep the patens of two such huge potions hiding somewhere. There’s a lot of money involved in these.”
If you’re not happy with reading about this, stay around for the next chapter, where I will not talk about it anymore (that much).
“Well, let’s hope it’s a good game then, right?” he asked meekly, before getting up and heading to the Quidditch pitch, leaving the others to start discussing what they had just witnessed. When he marched past Draco, he winked at him and smiled at Raphaél, before mouthing: “Good job!”
“How about we go back inside and see whether or not we can sneak some sweets from the kitchen?” Draco offered and they quickly got up. When they walked by Draco’s friends, Harry couldn’t help himself and jumped out at Theodore who swore so many different things, Draco had never heard him say before.
“Well, Severus. It’s not getting boring around here.” He wanted to say something else, when Draco smirked.
Walking to the ball room, he watched the pairs dancing and his gaze went around the nicely decorated room, until his attention was drawn to someone special. It wasn’t hard for Harry to find Draco. He was wearing a smooth black suit with a yellow, red patterned mask. His blond hair, however, immediately told Harry who he was looking at. He did look a little uncomfortable, though Harry could see that he was trying to hide from someone else. Nevertheless, he still looked absolutely stunning.
“That sounds like a pick-up line from one potions lover to another” Harry smirked.
“Harry!” Draco turned to look at him and shook his head. “Names are names!” He was trying his hardest not to laugh over his ward’s blunt statement. He didn’t quite manage that, however, Miss Soames aka Charlie was laughing now as well.
The other Gryffindor groaned, clearly not happy that Ron either didn’t read everything or just wasn’t getting it. “They wanted to make the people stop the testing, Ron. Read the second part again,
Ginny must have seen him setting the table and came into the enlarged dining room as well. “You left Draco with Mum?” she asked and quickly went around the other side of the table, placing plates down.
He didn’t say anything, simply sat down on the floor next to his Magical Guardian. However, before Draco could start the movie, Harry jumped up again to grab a soft blanket and walked back to his original place.
“Hey!” Harry called out, but couldn't bite back his laughter, which was quickly followed by Draco's and Ron's and then everyone else's. Draco placed a tired out Caellum back into the crib and accio'd two more glasses.
That was a lie. Both people knew it. Draco was sure that the fire reminded him of the Battle of Hogwarts, but he couldn’t say it to a Muggle. And well, Draco couldn’t tell him that he knew about the Battle of Hogwarts, because well... that would make him a wizard.
As for your other point: The Magical Guardian’s Test has a few… let’s say difficult points, which haven’t gotten their own set of rules yet, as it is barely used. I have read a few books about it, but nobody really seems to know where it comes from and who created it for what reason. From what I know, it checks the magical surrounding (not the actual term) and then bonds with the one the most compatible. In Harry’s case it was yours.
Draco shrugged his shoulders. “It’s not too bad.”
His life seemed like a rollercoaster. So many ups and downs and now he felt as if he’d had a loop and completely lost his orientation while the rollercoaster continued to race towards the end. It was just crazy. However, he was on this thing together with his friends and Harry. He knew if someone was going to look out for him, it was all of these crazy people. And at the front was Harry. Which was probably why he was doing what he was doing right now: protecting the person he loved. Well, rather taking revenge for him.
“I’m sorry” Ron was the first to speak up. “
“So… while
Rolling his eyes, Harry got up. “I’m constantly around you guys and people don’t ask me if there’s something going on between all of us. Frankly, even that thought turns me off.” Harry shivered and shrugged his shoulders. “And I’m married.”
Theodore looked at him closely and frowned. “You look far too fancy for it to just be a catch up dinner”
“I guess.” Harry shrugged his shoulders, staring into the almost empty cup.
This made Harry laugh and he shook his head. “Honestly, it’s just amusing to see Theo jumping into the air when I get him. That’s all there is. Still innocent, right?”
obvious.”
“Yes, I just got that recorded, so if it then does work, I’ll play this at your wedding.” He winked and Draco rolled his eyes, before heading back to his depressing home. This wasn’t going to work, right? That would be weird if someone could somehow match two people together without much thinking and it would be perfect? No way.
Shit! This wasn’t a platonic love potion, that was a full on –
Draco decided to explain a little more as well. “When he turned eleven again, the Book of Acceptance had decided that he needed to do the sorting again.”
Harry chuckled and got up. “Of course I’m talking to Padfoot. I wouldn’t dare call you ‘darling’. Not after we’ve broken up for… how many years now?”
Blaise frowned. “Why, because he asked you out two years ago?”
Symptoms: every fucking think I’ve had so far, just intensified to about a thousand percent.
Someone should have done something. Children were much more scared of nightmares. If you had a nightmare as an adult, yes it was still scary, but you could calm your own mind much more easily than a child.
As his group headed out of the Great Hall, Harry stayed in the back. He watched Draco discuss the first few clues – which apparently Minerva had once mentioned, while he had been too busy concentrating on anything else than his husband – with Neville and Pansy. He looked very much interested in the game, most likely a perfect coping mechanism so he didn’t have to think about the fact that their future had changed.
He leaned in and put his hands around him quickly. Whatever Draco was feeling for him, he was apparently also feeling for him. The overpowering scent of coffee took over all of his senses. Harry’s warm skin seemed like his own personal sanctuary. Draco lost the time in the sensations of what was Harry Potter.
“I doubt that” Draco grinned and turned around. “Now get rid of all these stupid clothes and get the fuck in here!”
“I’m okay” Harry continued, pressing another kiss on his husband’s temple. He still had his shirt in his hand, but Harry wasn’t concerned about that. He just wanted the love of his life to get better. “I’m okay” he repeated and smiled softly. “And you’re here in my arms. Also, perfectly okay and safe.”
So, last week wasn't all that bad. Now, however, I don't even have time to write. I still have 2 chapters ready, where I only have to add a few details etc. But after that, I'm done... I'll give you these two chapters during this week, I promise and I hope I can have time to write during the week-end, but I don't know...
Finally, with another loud meow, Merlin climbed down the table and tapped behind Harry who walked back to the stove. There, he sat down basically on Harry’s foot. Draco smirked, loving their dynamic extremely. Ever since they had gotten Merlin, he stayed by Harry’s side and nobody could separate them. However, when Harry was too busy, their Kneazel also chose other people to be around, even though Harry was his favorite human.
Harry hummed and pressed a gentle kiss on his temple. Theodore shook his head over their affection, though it didn’t seem as if he was against them. Maybe he just wasn’t entirely okay with public affection. Since, yes, most Slytherins had been taught not so show affection and love if there were a lot of people in the room. However, Harry didn’t seem to care. And Draco loved how Harry had no problem showing him how much he liked him. So yes, public showcase of affection was something Draco couldn’t get enough of. As long as it wasn’t inappropriate. And also as long as Severus wasn’t in the room.
Hogsmeade hadn’t changed much. There still were the same shops, pubs and it seemed as if even the people there hadn’t changed much. McGonagall had shown them around the place again, pointed out a few new shops and war memorabilia and let them go after half an hour.
Dear Lion
His boss had quite obviously already lost interest. “Well, there is something else I need to discuss with you. Since you have not followed my order of coming back, the promotion’s off the table.”
“The Dementors suck the soul out of the living” Malfoy explained, even though he really didn’t need to say that part – Harry was well aware of that fact. “It keeps the shells alive, so technically they aren’t dead. Though for a house that keeps track of the lineage, it might look like they’re dead, so it gets confused, because it knows they aren’t dead, but they’re also not alive.”
Unsurprisingly, Pansy and Harry stood by the lake, playing with rocks, the water or just generally throwing weak spells around.
The Slytherin held his breath and averted his gaze. Harry put a finger under Draco’s chin, once again making him look at him. His thumb stroked his chin softly and Draco closed his eyes.
Thursday being the last day, well second to last day, of their class reunion… there were a lot of things going on. And Draco and Harry also had a lot of things planned. In all honesty, Harry wasn’t sure if they could get to do everything they had planned. Nevertheless, he was going to try it. Far was it for him to not let Draco have his fun.
Draco quickly made the excess coffee, hitting the table, disappear. Pansy was clearly shocked and unable to react. Only after a few more moments, she turned to Harry with wide eyes. “Well, first of all, you just ruined a good cup of coffee, but secondly, you are such a nice Slytherin prince!”
When Harry turned them around, he saw the very first name
“I’m sorry, Draco. However, you’re too dramatic: It’s only two more nights and a day.” Severus raised his eyebrows and smirked. Draco could tell he was amused by how Draco turned a simple problem into this unsolvable puzzle.
“The best. They finally found a way remove the transformation entirely. They’re doing a few test runs, but the medicine could be ready in a year” Remus explained and while he said it his eyes were full of joy and Draco could even see a glint of hope.

“You really should take a little time off of being around Potter and think about
“Hi there, deary! Come in, come in!”
Harry stood up as well, leaned over the table and squeezed Draco’s shoulder with a soft smirk. Draco brushed the tears out of his face and grinned at Harry. Daphne shot them a warning glance, as if she wanted to tell them not to overdo their relationship, and stood up as well.
The fact that his ears were burning, coupled with his silence, made Ginny start laughing and she threw her fist onto the table. “I knew it! You guys can’t even keep your hands off of each other when you’re supposed to not know that other one’s gay!”
Mirjam chuckled and shrugged her shoulders. “What are your main issues?”
tried to talk to each other and it didn’t go well!” Harry huffed and angrily rolled his eyes once again. “I’m not going to do that anymore. What’s done is done.”
“Well, loyalty would be nice.” Harry said sheepishly.
While Harry sat down by the table, Eric caught the booklet with his eyes. “Oh no. I thought we just did a course with the academy!”
“All good?” Eric whispered when Alamar joined him at the back door.
Draco widened his eyes, while Harry got up and walked towards him. He continued walking, effectively pressing his husband into the wall behind him. “It’s so strong, Draco. I can’t ignore it.” He panted, his mind racing through so many scenarios of what could happen. “Please! Help me.”
“I’m sorry, Potter. I hope you know that. I just... I wanted to live back in seventh year.”
“In there is everything that happened to me over the course of this curse.”
In the following silence, Draco wondered whether or not there was someone. Judging from the saddened look on his godfather’s eyes, there must have been someone who either didn’t make it or something else happened.
Sighing, Minerva McGonagall shook her head and took a sip of her tea. “Dumbledore would have found out. He would have also found out about me being an Aminagus. He already doubts me; I don’t want to give him more information on me.”
“At least we can confirm that they were wizards” Malfoy commented and pointed at the words ‘magical marriage contract’. “They must have been in love and had to hide it.”
Looking up, Boy quickly turned to the window. Aunt Petunia didn’t like to be loud around neighbours so the fact that she was screaming for him, made this an emergency, he was sure.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Longbottom, what’s your point?”
He just wanted to answer, when his phone vibrated and he found Ron finally writing a text message. It must have taken him at least half an hour to write this. Harry smirked, when he read it.
Sniggering, Harry evaded another hex coming his way. “You’re his favorite person.”
Draco grinningly interrupted his ward as well. “…of being a dick to anyone who’s not in your favorite house.”
Harry laughed and shook his head. He handed Draco the last cup and cleaned the sink. “You’re still a Slytherin, my darling.”
Draco had not given Harry a present. It was a letter to him. A promise to go and pick another pet, once he was eleven years old. Severus had always said that boys needed pets to take care of and learn responsibilities. His father had never believed that. But Draco decided to do whatever
“Draco” Harry breathed, stopping his hands. He stared at the Slytherin whose eyes had darkened with lust. He couldn’t stop this train, not now. “Please” he whispered and kissed Draco with much more force, hungrily.
unknown (will show up at 17)
“Thank you” Harry then said quietly, as if he had hoped Draco wouldn’t really hear it.
Harry almost told the truth, that Toby was a bald, middle-aged, happily married man with three children, one sixteen year old step-daughter who was having her first serious boyfriend, which made Toby incredibly nervous. He couldn’t say that – obviously.
For the first time in forever, Draco was whistling again, when he crossed the road to once again another unknown location. Harry was leading him to all kinds of different places with this adventure. He was on his way to the office of this Gryffindor and the address led him to a little outskirt of Muggle London into Creature London. Out here, you could meet literally anything.
Laughing, Draco shook his head. He was just about to thank him, when he realised that Benjamin didn’t really drink wine. “Thank you for the offer, however, maybe you should keep it for someone who actually likes your wine.”
Finally, after a solid minute of silence, Minerva seemed to figure out that Albus wanted her gone and she excused herself with the stupid reason of having some essays to correct. He knew that nobody really worked in her classes; they all looked as if they were having fun.
“Millicent wanted to wake you up, but I thought my method was much more effective” Theodore laughed and dodged one of Draco’s jinxes. “Get out of bed; we’re leaving for breakfast in ten minutes!”
Harry looked up and carefully held his hand towards the animal. It purred again, rubbing its owl head on his hand. “What’s that? It looks like a cat and an owl.”
Weasley nodded. “He told us, that he was going by foot. Something about how he could think about things while he’s walking. I don’t know, man. I haven’t heard from him in ages.”
Draco stepped inside and stopped with wide eyes. They were in the middle of London, yet there was a huge apartment at the top of these buildings. On Draco’s right, there was a big living room with a door to a patio where you could see almost all of London – clearly not but that was what Draco thought.
“Come on, Pans! Breakfast! Now!” Draco shook his head, not willing to let Pansy start a fight with a Gryffindor.
Harry grinned. “That’s great!”
“Is it in Muggle London?” Harry explained.
Potter smirked and nudged him to enter the pub. He held open the door, while Draco passed, thinking about what a gentleman the wonder boy had become. Once inside, Draco stopped dead in his track. The morning light flooded the room through the big windows and the wooden floor was decently covered by about fifteen tables and at the back he noticed a few games, billiard, darts and even a chess table. There was a bar with a few bar stools and a lot of alcohol behind it.
Draco hugged his ward and they walked out again like ghosts. Well, since the ghosts in the corner had not realized anything. When Draco led his ward to the Hospital Wing, he grinned a little. “You liked the Patronus cats?”
“Someone like Nicolai?” Harry smirked.
Everyone jerked up, when another voice answered Harry’s statement. “Sadly, this is not in your hands anymore, Mr. Potter.” Severus stood there, right next to the book case, looking down on them. Harry and Draco quickly sat up properly and Pansy giggled, when Draco’s father couldn’t stop himself from grinning. “Come on, Draco. We’re just having a quick meeting with everyone, and then you’ll be free to return to Harry’s arms. And I will make sure to tell Minerva that the meeting with Harry will happen tomorrow, so you two have all the time you want together.”
Ron shoved Harry slightly and motioned to the group who was following McGonagall out of the Great Hall. “What are you thinking about?” he asked and grinned. “You know, if you were in a relationship, I wouldn’t be mad if you’d tell me right now.”
“Most likely, yes” Draco grinned and leaned over Harry again. “You’re my missing piece, Harry. I would be nothing without you.”
His godfather narrowed his eyes and held up his hands in confusion. “Hold on, Draco. What’s the topic? I thought you were talking about me adopting you, but it doesn’t…”
Hogwarts had probably finally gotten a professor for wild beast who knew how to teach the students, as there were a few paddocks with different animals and even magical horses. A few wizards were going through the boxes, other were feeding the animals. Thinking his made Harry feel slightly guilty, since Hagrid had been a good guy, but he just didn't have what it took to be a professor. While he cared enough for the animals, he didn't care the same amount for all the students. So, Harry was glad that he had found work in Charlie's dragon house, or whatever it was called.
“Other than that, Harry, our entire school carrier sucked” Draco answered and offered a weak chuckle. “But it’s a good year for friends and…”
“You’re going through all emotions at once, huh, little bear?” Draco smirked and ruffled through Potter’s hair, while he squealed.
The Headmistress looked at everyone and back to Harry. “What is the meaning of this?” she then finally asked sternly, as if she hadn’t been able to figure out what was going on, which… yes, was pretty much it.
It was pretty clear to Draco that he needed to expect the worst. And… yes. The small, almost six years old Harry Potter entered, sporting a rainbow of colors on his head. It seemed as if he couldn’t decide what color to go with, so he took them all on different strains of hair.
“Please tell me you’re counting on me making a huge scene!”
Nicolai chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “It’s been a nice experience.”
Harry chuckled as well and turned back to the meat in the pan. He checked it and added the pasta into the water. When he looked back at the Slytherin, he frowned at Harry. “You’re okay?”
Draco rolled his eyes and sighed. “Well, we’ve had a good run.”
The man seemed too excited to have heard the warning and continued cheerfully. “It’s from a critic, Sirius, who wants to come and check out your pub, apparently you have the best food in the area, so they want to make sure you’re doing a good job.”
Malfoy looked up and raised his eyebrows. “Is it an illness?”
Vanessa shrugged her shoulders and smiled. “Sure.” Henry sighed, but nodded as well.
“Love, it’s most likely a fertility love potion.”
Harry stared at him and smiled softly. “I am. Interested I mean.” He groaned and hid his eyes, when he heard Draco chuckle, even though he tried to hide it. “I am interested” he murmured.
A hand in front of his eyes brought him back to reality. Draco looked up to see Pansy frowning at him. They stood in front of the Great Hall and everyone else had already entered. Probably because Pansy told them to do so.
“Oh, it’s um… not a child anymore.” Draco smirked. “It’s Harry Potter.” He quickly summarized what happened to their holy Savior, when Harry walked and placed an arm around his boyfriend.
Draco sighed. “Luckily, Severus said we could stay with him until we find a flat. But he lives in a rather tiny appartment close to Diagon Alley.  I never knew where he lived…”
“Hello, Molly, how are you doing?” he asked, turning to her and sitting down on an armchair now as well.
“So you decided to threaten me with having to visit you in the Hospital Wing if I didn’t come looking for you with a blanket?” Draco interrupted him with a lopsided sneer on his face.
Eric nodded and placed a hand over the other man’s mouth, since he had already huffed when Eric talked about him disappearing. There seemed to be something else, though Eric made sure to keep it from him.
Have a nice evening!
“Harry, you need to sleep. Come with me, I’ll give you a little Dreamless Sleep, with that you can at least sleep in peace” Draco offered, knowing full well that having to deal with something like that was not going to work if you had to stay awake all night. However, Dreamless Sleep also wasn’t entirely helpful for dealing with something like that. The truth was, nevertheless, that Harry really needed to go to bed.
Pansy glared at him. “How did nobody do anything against this? He was being abused! He’s only two years old and already had twice as many life events and injuries on his parchment… Did you see the bullet point before the broken arm? He’s living
“Thought about what?” Harry frowned and turned to his best friend.
I’m constantly dizzy and about to throw up. I don’t even know where up or down is. My head is killing me and I think I’m having a fever again. The mediwitches are freaking out. They try to be calm and all, but they probably think that my ears are still messed up. As soon as the door is closed they scream at each other.
“But…”
The former Gryffindor let go of Draco, panted and started to laugh quietly. “Are you telling me to stop kissing you, when you continue? I am confused.”
“You are so welcome, Mr. Potter. Enjoy the early evening” Hannah retorted and got up to take seat Harry was vacating. As quickly as she sat down, the three women were neck deep into theorizing who Draco’s wife was, all while Daphne winked at Harry.
Potter snorted still slightly pissed off, but couldn’t stop himself from smirking a mere second later. “And who are you that you can tell me to get healthy, Mr. Brown?”
Draco held up his hands and interrupted his ward. “Harry, stop it. If you don’t believe me, you should ask Pansy or Blaise, or Theodore. I’m sure they’ll all say you
“They do understand English, I believe. And if not, we can always use out hands to mime out what we’re looking for.”
“Meow!”
“Bear, what’s wrong?”
“I know, Harry. I’m sorry you had to go through this.” Draco placed his hands on Harry’s knee and squeezed it shortly. “Do you want to talk about your nightmare?”
“Harry!” she screamed and jumped up to hug him.
Shaking his head, Harry rolled his eyes. "Malfoy, we’re not doing this again!”
Draco sat in their favorite spot, watching people enter their new room for the tenth time. It apparently wasn’t getting old, which he did quite understand. They had within three days taken everything the basilisk had to offer and sold a few things. It would have been too obvious if they had appeared with so many basilisk parts in front of Severus. He had still been suspicious, when Harry, Pansy and Draco had stood in front of his door with a huge arrangement of basilisk parts.
Eric luckily saved him from his thoughts. “In order to keep you save, we thought that maybe you should blend in and go to school here, in Russia. The problem is that with a name like yours, everyone will know who you are. So, what do you think about changing your name?”
“Huh” Blaise nodded impressed, when the door to their company opened and Pansy walked in, followed by Blaise’s boyfriend.
Draco looked at him uninterested and sucked in one piece of spaghetti slowly, just to make the critic uncomfortable. He was doing exactly that. Ian got a red head and was probably about to kill Draco when he had finished his game.
“You should probably tell Sirius about your partner, before he gets his heart broken by another man not willing to make space for him.”
Hermione frowned. “What do you mean? Wait, how did I not find this store, since you have the best books? And since when did you get into books, Harry?”
Her voice was almost begging for some truths. However, Harry couldn’t tell them. He was having too much fun with pretending to hate his husband and in all fairness; neither Ron nor Hermione had told him about the secret bingo game that was going on with their relationship. So, he didn’t really feel the need to tell them what was going on – at least not now.
Harry’s intense look was enough to bring Draco to his knees any second now and his breathing sped up, trying his hardest not to fall. After all these years, Harry still had this power over him. He reached up and tucked a strain of hair out of his husband’s face.
Harry smiled though he would have loved to tell him he was one of the people that left him behind and just continued with business as usual. He didn’t do that, mostly because he didn’t want to cause a scene in front of Luna and Ginny.
Draco couldn’t pretend it didn’t get to him. He hugged his ward tighter and pressed a kiss on his forehead. “Whatever happens, Harry, there are no monsters you can’t fight. And if you’re scared, you can always come to me and we’ll fight them together. Okay?”
“You have a memory loss?” Draco asked and frowned. “What happened?”
Before Harry could answer, Pansy asked a question of her own: “When did that happen?”
Before he could continue, Harry interrupted him. “Stop thinking bad of yourself, Dray! You took me in and even though you didn’t really have to, you raised me. You’re still raising me! And I… I feel safe here. You make me feel safe. That’s what superheroes are supposed to do, right?”
“Don’t just stand there, Dray” Harry brought him back to reality. “If you want you can help me in setting the table.”
Harry exhaled and relaxed slightly. At least now he knew where his planner was.
Granger nodded and even Weasley – although reluctantly – agreed. While the wall disappeared, Weaslette walked closer frowning slightly. “How come, we didn’t get to hear any of the rules?”
“Sadly, my friend, someone taught me manners!” he said as if it was the last thing on earth that he wanted. He winked at Neville and motioned towards his girlfriend. “Be careful when you’re on a date with Pansy!”
The Gryffindor chuckled, while she shook his wet robes, where the rain had luckily stopped pouring out. “I may have started to say something inappropriate to Harry.”
Olivia smiled at him and it was the sweetest smile, she was probably capable of. “We were actually hoping to earn some money here. So, if it’s not too much to ask, we’d like to work as much as possible.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, bear, how can I help you?” Draco smiled softly. There was a very weak, almost suppressed ‘aww’-sound from Pansy, when Potter’s grin turned broader as is he seemed to realize what Draco’s actual name was (besides Potter calling him ‘dada’). Also, for some reason, Potter had managed to say ‘r’ for the very first time.
“What are you doing around Draco anyway, Harry? Wait, is he a client of yours and are you following his work? You always were amazing at all of that and…” Pansy just kept talking and talking, which Draco already was familiar with, though it seemed as if Potter also was used to that.
Draco’s head turned into his direction, and only then Harry was able to take in his presence for the first time. He looked rough, hair disheveled and dark shadow-like bags under his grey eyes.
“I figured that, Malfoy. That’s why I’ll stay here and protect you if I need to.”
“There are a lot of things about me that you don’t know and that you’d never believe me,” Draco copied his words from earlier, his lips curling up into a smug grin.
Harry was about to finish the chapter of the book when the sound of a door handle being pushed down and soft steps making their way in his direction startled him out of his concentration.
“No. You’re the most important part.”
He put his bookmark between the pages and put it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Looking up, Malfoy came to a halt a few feet away. He was rubbing his neck and gestured for Harry to move a bit to make room for him on the couch.
If my father would see me now, sitting here with Harry Potter like we’re friends and living with the Muggles, he would probably chop off my head, making me the Nearly Headless Nick, Draco thought.
Draco was well aware of the fact that Cisco didn’t believe him. But that was his smallest problem. Why did Potter look for him after all these years? How did he even find him in the first place? Draco made sure that no one was able to find him in Central City. What was so important that Potter did everything to find him?
Draco looked him dead in the eye:
“What is he doing here?” he heard Barry’s shocked voice behind him say.
Please leave some good prompts or ideas for OneShots and stories in the comments!:)
“I guess you just have to trust me and find out.”
“I’m not dead,” he nodded approvingly.
“So you decided to never take that step into the house in the first place.”
Typically Potter. Coming here without a well thought out plan.
The next day, Draco found himself walking to S.T.A.R Labs to meet up with the team. It was his only work free day in the week, but he still spent it working with the others. He brushed past all kinds of people on their way somewhere as he was deep in thought, furrowing his eyebrows. Harry had to go back to the ministry that day to give them a detailed report about everything that happened the past days and if there was anything suspicious going on in Central City that might indicate death eaters were present.
In moments like these, where the team felt like the family he never had but always wanted, he felt even more horrible. He shook the thoughts away for once, focusing on the then and there. That place, the room of S.T.A.R Labs he was standing in, surrounded by the best people he had ever met, made him feel like he finally found his home.
“Never thought I would see the day you’re here early,” he made himself noticeable and smirked as Barry turned around to face him.
Draco got up without saying a word, having a clue what this will be about. He knew their ways by now. If there was a problem that needed to be solved, they ran after you in the hallway or drag you into it. Which, unsurprisingly, was exactly what Allen did.
By the time he arrived at S.T.A.R Labs and made his way through the big building, they were already waiting for him. H.R. and Joe were also there, an expecting look written in their facial expression as they saw him coming in.
“Cisco, what the hell?” Barry yelled, not a tiny bit amused by the bullshit going on right in front of him.
“Good, you’re here. Should we wait for the others or can I start?” Cisco got louder this time and threw his arms around like he was about to lose his patience.
“Charming as always, Malfoy,” Harry spit back, his voice dripping with venom.
“Well, hello to you too,” Draco sassed and rolled his eyes dramatically. All Harry focused on was that exact moment. The comment, the eye roll. It looked familiar. It made him look so much younger, like he was back at being a fourteen year old.
“It was repulsive, really. I know I walked around with pride about my family. Showing everyone how goddamn proud I was to be a Malfoy and a Slytherin. But- That was Hogwarts. Back home after the school year and I was a wreck and couldn’t wait to hop onto Hogwarts Express to go to school. I refused to cross paths with my father when walking around my own home after he found out I was gay. “Maintain the bloodline” and “disgrace for the whole family” were the only words he had left for me.” He paused, taking a deep breath and closing his eyes for a moment. Harry was sure that Malfoy was close to tears.
Harry sat down beside him and Draco used the opportunity to nudge his shoulder with his own.
“Alright,” he answered when the taxi stopped in front of Oliver’s place. Draco made a quick process of paying him and they waited for the others who arrived ten minutes later.
Cisco’s eyes softened as he started to feel bad for all the accusations he had made.
But the war changed him to the better. It felt like he saw the world through entirely different eyes once he realized the consequences of his actions. And he also realized what person he never wanted to become: Lucius Malfoy.
“But-,” Cisco threw in, a frown visible on his face. “If he’s from England, like you, how was he affected by the explosion? That means he was here when it happened. Which seems like a really big coincidence considering you didn’t live here around that time.”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I have absolutely no idea. I guess I might have to hire a lawyer from somewhere. I’m slightly tempted to just ask Nicolai to make Peter and this whole situation disappear.”
“So Harry” Eric started and smiled. “You know how we took you away from your relatives? There was a reason why we left the country.”
He got back up, pushed everything on the table off and proceeded to destroy his belongings. Belongings that represented a person he would never be. A normal, less confused and hurt person that never went through the things that he had to go through as a kid.
Never had he imagined that he would live with the Muggles, but then again, he only hated them because of his father’s attempt to keep the traditions and beliefs in the family. Not only did he hate them once, he treated them really bad, telling them they’re worth less than purebloods.
“What?” Draco asked. Although, deep down, he would never trust Potter to do something like that, horror reflected in his eyes for a few seconds.
More than amused by the situation, Draco followed him, not even questioning how Cisco knew his name. Allen probably complained about me all day long, he thought, satisfied that him annoying Barry had its effects on him.
“I’m not genuinely happy, Potter. I’m doing fine, that’s for than enough for me.”
“Wait, so they are some sort of virgilantes?” Harry asked while they were sitting in a taxi.
“Fuck,” Cisco cursed, pushing his long hair out of his face. “Did I just force you to come out?”
“Hello?” he called out, well aware that shouting Hello? never ended with a good scenario but what was there to be scared of? He was a wizard, one snap of his fingers and he was back in his apartment without them noticing.
Draco just chuckled and took a seat at his own desk to fulfill his tasks.
Barry Allen, a brown haired, skinny lad he had to share a laboratory with and sometimes it was the instruction of the big boss that they had to work together. They bickered back and forth most of the time, annoyed about the other one coming too close to their work. These moments reminded Draco of the old times, making him feel nostalgic every now and then. Other than that, he was mostly too occupied with cases and didn’t have the time to look back.
“It was nice meeting you, but I need to kidnap my mate here. We have a lot of catching up to do. Is Jitters coffee still as good? Hope I can get to know you sometime, that would be brilliant,” Harry blabbered his rant over his shoulder while he shoved Draco out of their sight.
The meta alarm turned them all serious again, hurrying up to do their work. But it was okay for Draco, because that was his life now. And he absolutely loved it that way.
“It’s all good. He’s not here to kill you, geez.”
Well done, Draco, his inner voice mocked him. Just like always. “Don’t let your past intimidate you,” we’re the words he repeated over and over again like some kind of mantra. In times when he fell back into old habits or did something that might hurt people, lying to close friends being the perfect example of such a situation, he had to remind himself that he changed, that he grew up and that he wasn’t like his father taught him his whole life.
All of a sudden, he was at the verge of tears. He hadn’t thought about Pansy in a long time, everything about her hurting too much. She was the one he could trust and tell everything to and he just dumped their friendship to escape everything. He felt the urge to just disappear from Central City and go back, but disappearing again meant disappointing the people he got to know here. He wouldn’t make that mistake twice.
“I was in Central City during the particle accelerator explosion. I was drinking coffee at Jitters, actually. First time in America and that’s the result, eh?”
I don’t deserve living like this, he thought. But then he realized, and his inner voice seemed to mock him: But you chose this life. You ran away like the coward you are. Just like your father.
He had one big realization that day: Yes, he had to go through some things on his own, but being gay was not a part of them. Not when he had the best friends. And most importantly not when he had Potter by his side.
Everything is about to go down when Draco gets caught in his own net of lies he spun. Confrontation time.
And then, they simultaneously burst out laughing, easing up the mood in the room like the handshake was the greatest thing to grace the earth.
“Damn, is this a bad moment? Feels like I could cut the tension with a knife. Oop, don’t worry, I don’t carry knives around with me,” H.R. said and smiled like the oblivious person he was. He tried to ease the tension. Sadly, he didn’t have any success.
Draco decided that it was best to go to bed early the day before, considering the amount of sleep he got the night before that. He left the living room at nine o’clock, leaving Harry to himself in front of the TV. They haven’t talked much, a little smalltalk was all they managed.
He showered and brushed his teeth absentmindedly, too tired and not fully working after only two hours of sleep. He got rid of the clothes he could smell some of the whiskey on and got dressed in clothes that he got out of the washing machine.
Everyone chuckled at that.
They told them, Draco thought and scoffed. Was there anything they could keep to themselves or did that rule only matter when it came to their private business?
“You two better start talking. The truth this time, may I add,” was the first thing Cisco said when they walked in.
“How the hell did you get in here?” a rather small guy with long, dark hair asked. Draco recognized him as Cisco, the guy who helped the police to catch metas by constructing high technology weapons. He looked sincerely surprised and confused at the sight of Draco standing in the middle of the big entrance hall.
“Geez, okay.”
The first thing Oliver asked when he saw Harry was “Who’s this?”
Harry shrugged.
But somehow, Draco made up his mind. Barry was right and their little talk gave him a boost of confidence and courage he hadn’t felt since first to sixth school year.
“And how exactly do you know Julian?” Joe unashamedly continued cross-examining. Being a detective, it was what he’s best at. Finding out the truth and all that.
“We did go to the same school. But it’s nowhere in the papers because...- because it wasn’t just any kind of school. See, my parents were strict and even more so strictly catholic, and I'm making the whole thing sound harmless with the words I’m using right now. They sent me to boarding school, a catholic re-education camp, to be exact. Guess a gay son wasn’t something that fit with their beliefs.”
“But Muggles have police. Is this an American thing?” he whispered so no else would hear him say the word “Muggle”.
“If you’re here to tell me that I should leave the city and hide from them, then you’re delusional, Potter.”
“Sure. What’s a “Team Arrow” though?” he asked, confusion written all over his face.
“We all have a gay side, don’t you worry. Do you know Oliver Queen?” he said as he pulled away. He put an arm around Draco’s shoulder and guided him back into the room, making Draco burst out laughing at the mention of the Green Arrow as Barry’s secret man crush.
“You know, you should start letting people in. Think about it, there are things you don’t have to go through alone. And, uh- I mean, if you decide to do it, just know that I won’t be far.” That being said, he went into his own room, grabbing one of his books out of his suitcase to go back into the living room and read.
Draco relaxed when he saw everyone eyeing them more at ease after their little unconvincing sketch.
“Hey, so, uhm, this guy- What was his name? Cisco?”
He didn’t know when it happened, when he fell in love with the raven haired boy with the scar in the shape of a lighting on his forehead. But it did and he couldn’t stop himself from liking the feeling of being in love. Of course Draco’s father had to ruin it, working with Voldemort and being the reason he threatened his family so Draco was willing to help him. When the war was finally over, he couldn’t look anyone, but mostly Potter, in the eye anymore and left as soon as he could.
Draco’s stress levels were over the roof, he had abruptly decided to take the offer Harry made earlier. But sitting there, his eyes on him as he tried to find a conversation starter, he felt his throat going dry and getting uncomfortably tight.
If he ignored the fact that he just couldn’t stand the nerdy guy at work, he actually found himself to quite like the job and his new life. If you compared his old life with his new one, there weren’t too many differences. Central City, something that would sound like a normal city somewhere in America to everyone from England, was full of meta-humans.
Smiling cheekily, his eyes crinkling under his glasses, he took Draco’s hand and shook it.
“Okay, stop. I will tell you.” He hesitated, was he going to make Harry hate him again with the words he planned to say? He hated this. He hated the lies and the drama. He blinded people with his lies, and for what? So that he could start over? So that he could build himself a new, good life that consists of messing up the lives of the people around him with his chaos?
“Julian, don’t worry. You don’t need to talk about it. We’re actually here because of something entirely different,” Barry stated.
“I’m serious, Julian. Spill it.”
“How do you know him?” Iris asked, curiosity filling her voice.
“Thank you. For telling me, I mean. But I’d appreciate it if you could leave me alone now. I don’t want to come across as rude right now, but please. I’ll see you tomorrow, eh?” he said and forced a smile.
“I don’t know, Cisco. I haven’t seen him in- in ten years, maybe?” he snapped unintentionally and acted clueless. He knew exactly that he hadn’t seen him in ten years and a bit over two months. But showing his friends that he knew the exact amount of years and months would give too much away.
“Why, hello there, Flash.”
They relaxed for the rest of the day, having fun at the little meet up with their friends from Star City. At the end of the night, Oliver invited them to a party he would have in two days and they said their goodbyes, all leaving into different directions to go home.
“I- Honestly, no. I mean, sure, I left everything behind, but that was a good thing. I saw an opportunity to start over and I took it. I was able to be whoever I wanted here. No problematic past getting in the way.”
“Malfoy, why the hell did you do that?”
Draco could hear Potter gulp next to him and his tense body signaled him that he was more than uncomfortable. Only then he realized that he told Barry and Cisco that he met Potter at a re-education camp for gay boys. Draco didn’t know whether Harry was gay or not, but if he was, then he just made the biggest mistake of his life. He might’ve outed him. He always kind of sensed gay vibes radiating off Harry but he never actually had the conviction that it was true.
He did everything he could to contain himself, not being up for crying that day, but he failed miserably when a tear escaped his eyes. He felt like he belonged there, he was consent with the life he built himself in Central City.
Two hours later, totally focused on a case and not noticing his surroundings, he was brought back into reality by a knock on the doorframe.
They were back at the apartment, Harry dragged him out of S.T.A.R Labs as soon as everyone calmed down and got their shit together.
Draco froze immediately, his heart racing. Could it- Could it be him?
“I’m- I’m not unhappy.” Draco shrugged his shoulders, signaling Harry that it wasn’t a big deal for him.
Harry hesitated. Was this a good idea? Will they survive this “little while”?
Please leave some feedback in the comments!:)
“Uh-huh,” was Draco’s only response as he slowly brought the fork up to his mouth. He chewed for a while and finally swallowed the delicious meal.
Draco have him a questioning look, telling him to continue without using words.
“So, Harry James Potter, why are you here then?”
Iris squealed instantly, beaming at him the same way Allen did in that moment and Draco could feel the weight on his body that he carried around for so long fade away.
He sat down, leg wiggling up and down, a kind of lunatic look in the grey eyes he pinned to the wall on the other side of the room. Harry didn't know if he should stop the ordeal that the white blond man in front of him obviously went through by speaking up or if staying quiet and waiting patiently was the better way to deal with him. He decided on the latter, giving him the time he needs to find his words.
They sat at a table at Jitters, talking about what happened in their lives during the ten years the didn’t see each other. Draco couldn’t shake off the consent with Potter sitting across from him, asking all those questions about the new version of Draco. To his surprise they didn’t jump at each other’s throats yet.
“I know who the dark haired man was, yeah. But honestly, I’ve never heard the name Draco Malfoy in my whole life,” he lied and tried his best not to look as guilty as he felt because he once again fed them a lie.
“I don’t know if it’s that hard to understand, really. I obviously didn’t want anyone to find me. Not some death eaters, not Pansy, and especially not you,” he said and fell into his old habit of going into offense mode when it came to Potter.
“But they’re your friends, right?”
“We have every right to now,” Cisco explained through gritted teeth.
He stopped dead in his tracks when he heard a knock on the door that led into his apartment. He snapped out of his anger and his thoughts and  approached the door, opening it without looking through the peephole.
It felt ridiculous and unbelievable that he was never able to get over his love sickness around the raven haired man with the glasses that still made him look absolutely adorable like back in school.
“Cisco, seriously, stop. This seems like a lot to take in right now. Chill out.”
“By the way, Oliver told me that we should come over for dinner later,” were Barry’s words and Draco couldn’t stop himself but wink at Barry, making him remember what he said earlier. A blush crept onto his cheeks and they turned a light shape of red. Only Draco noticed though, the rest being completely oblivious to the teasing from Draco that was going on.
“I’m proud of you, you know?” He continued when he saw Draco’s unconvinced look. “Malfoy, I’m serious. Look where you are today. You can be yourself! And you opened up to someone.”
Six months passed fast and they couldn’t believe they were already friends for that long without killing each other, but they managed it somehow. They caught metas and other criminals together and Draco started to feel more bad each day that passed by. He was lying to them. Well, not directly lying. But he also didn’t tell them the truth. He wasn’t Julian Albert. He was Draco Malfoy, a wizard from England who visited Hogwarts, a school just for wizards and witches.
“I still can’t believe you Apparated in front of Muggles.”
Barry approached him after he watched him for several silent minutes.
Draco didn’t say anything to that, he only squeezed him tighter until he pulled away because he feared he might break Harry’s glasses.
The questions that were left unanswered were getting too much now.
“Actually, I don’t know all too much about your childhood and the relationship with your parents ante-war,” was all he replied, not wanting to say too much so soon.
Barry was the one patting a shoulder this time, smiling the famous Barry Allen smile with his perfect teeth.
Draco laughed and nodded. “If not for the rest of her life.” He sat up properly and grinned at Harry who rolled his eyes.
. Smirking softly, Draco put it onto the floor and looked at the parchment. It actually was a full on letter from Remus. Checking on Potter, Draco saw him sitting on the grass, playing with a few dirty leaves that he threw into the air and giggled about.
“You’re saying I should go then?” Draco sighed and looked at Pansy to also get her opinion.
“Creepy more likely” Malfoy commented, though he headed to the piano almost immediately. He sat down tentatively and carefully placed his hands onto the keys. As he played an accord, the whole house seemed to breathe in, as if an invisible tension had broken. A soft melody was Malfoy’s reaction to that and the calm, beautiful music made Harry smile gently.
A little down that street, there was his favorite pet shop, his parents had always sold their purebred owls there, but Draco had been much more interested in all the other animals every time they had entered there. It was only fair that Harry got to choose his owl, or any animal he had wanted to get, there.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Are we staking out the movement of the stars? Will they change formation if we don’t keep tabs on them?”
They laid in bed, Padfoot in his dog bed right next to them – in fact so close that the curtains Harry had drawn a few second earlier kept him in sight of his humans. Harry placed a few protection spells and silencing charms around the bed, before he changed into his pajama and climbed back into bed, where Draco rolled to his side and looked at him. His fingers ran along his jaw bone to his chin, where he moved his hand up to trace Harry’s lips. Harry kissed his index finger softly.
“You know what?” Hannah said somewhat excited. “That is so true! It shouldn’t have taken Harry more than two hours to get his dog!”
They both knew that already, but it was still important to say things like that, especially after an emotionally draining conversation or when it was necessary for the other to hear it. Or before an hour of the softest, sweetest love making to show someone that there was no love-potion going on. Just normal, pure love for the human being right next to them.
“He’s too proud. You can’t ask him out, because he will say no. Every. Single. Time.” Parkinson sighed. “The only way for you to have a shot with him is to let him come to you.”
As if to agree – which Alamar was happily going to argue their Krimnee did until he was about to die - Aurora meowed with a rather serious expression and she jumped down and walked to the door, looking outside through the glass window at the side of the door.
In front of the door stood a familiar cat, looking up at him with a tilted head. Alamar chuckled and stepped back, only for Aurora to jump at the Animagi. Minerva McGonagall jumped to the side and raced over the threshold only to turn into a human again as soon as the door was closed.
“Get out!” Pansy called out and pointed to the door.
Potter inhaled and he chuckled as well. “Thanks. Maybe it would be easier to discuss this in person? Do you think we can meet at the Italian restaurant I’ve shown you in thirty minutes? I’ll be punctual, I swear.”
“But… Draco?” Anthony asked, before he snorted. “Who am I kidding, we saw you too together all the time. You make a nice couple.”
Harry chuckled quietly. “What for? I did nothing wrong!”
she heard him say that!”
Their peace was suddenly somewhat ruined by Millicent calling out: “Gryffindors approaching!”
“How dare you!” Draco spat, making a bush right next to Harry catching fire. Padfoot raced next to Harry, who jumped back almost stumbling over his dog. He had touched the fire though realized it was cold. Draco really wasn’t going to risk him burning himself just to have a show. It warmed his heart, while his husband continued screaming at him. This whole situation was just incredibly confusing, not only for Padfoot who looked at Draco incredibly baffled. Poor dog! “You don’t get to say something like that! The Malfoy name is back in society, I have worked my fucking arse off to make it okay!”
“Draco disappeared right after you were gone. Did you see him while you were out?” Hermione asked with an inappropriate wink.
Severus gave them something to drink, while he read over Madam Pomfrey’s letter. Once he finished, he looked at Harry, smiling. “Do you want to help me getting your nutrition potion ready? You could choose the flavor, if you’d like.”
“We should go down and see what we can use to get out of here” Ron said and sighed as he walked past Harry. He created light, put his wand between his teeth and started to climb down.
“I’m not… strong!” Harry shook his head. “I’m scared.”
“You’re just saying that because you don’t want me to feel guilty.”
He placed the ear on the back window sill, where the window was slightly open and the managed to get it rather close to the two love birds sitting in the coffee shop.
They all were quiet again, lost in their own thoughts. Draco watched his ward intently. Harry had gone through so much. Of course, he had been jumpy when they were all back at Hogwarts. He had been hunted for an entire year. They were on the run, constantly scared of accidentally running into the Dark Lord or someone of the Snatchers, probably. Hearing that made him feel incredibly guilty over how he had laughed about him and his friends. They went through hell, while he had a somewhat okay life. At least enough food.
. “Malfoy! Unless you don’t want anything here? I’m sure the house elves would be happy to put together a platter of whatever high end food you’re used to.”
Draco shook his head. “Over Potter?!” What was going on with Pansy? Their friendship had started when they were infants and now she was actually happy to throw it away for the Savior?!
“What… I wanted to win this game!” Daphne called out and crossed her arms over her chest. “And instead of me playing everyone, you two played us like an old flute.”
They had a scavenger hunt promised by the school, then there was their couple’s therapy and Harry had also promised Fleur to come by and get Olaf the ferret for some seemingly evil revenge – thinking of which… that seemed even better now after the couple’s therapy, where they should have made amends and then he would come with a ferret? Sounded pretty… evil.
Harry stopped and shook his head. “It’s nobody’s mistake, babe. We’ve been working so far apart from each other, it’s only logical that we’re not moving so fast. I think.”
“Yes!” she called out and jumped down from Draco’s lap, kneeling at the table and started to draw something with some magical pens. They could bring whatever she drew to life on the paper.
To Minerva McGonagall I leave all the information gathered about Godric Gryffindor. If you receive this, I’m sorry for not finishing our little project, but I hope you’ll like it nevertheless.
Theodore had by now seemingly come to the same conclusion as Draco and he narrowed his eyes, looking at the plates. Blaise was completely out of his comfort zone which you could clearly see, however, he stayed, probably hoping that there was something he could do to help. Draco was really glad that his friend - even though not comfortable - could be trusted to stay around.
Millicent snorted. “But what if there’s still a little love for the other?” she asked and sighed again.
Well, everyone seemed a little on edge and trying their hardest to hide it, since they were unable to talk and once Draco opened the door, there wasn’t just Severus, but also the witch from before. She quickly counted them and nodded.
“If you continue to harass me and Draco, I will sure as hell chase you out of here! Just because Merlin likes me doesn’t mean you can’t use him against me!”
Harry sighed and shook his head. “Too many people, Hermione. Are you and Ron at home or do you want me to come to Molly’s instead?”
Harry laughed. “Thank you so much!”
“I don’t believe you” Harry whispered and gave his husband another peck on the lips. “And if you’re interested, Daphne is already here, I’m sure you guys have a few things to talk about.” Daphne had actually helped them with the wedding preparations and had become a very close friend of both, though Draco and her still had a somewhat closer relationship. Harry always suspected it was because both went through the Voldemort-reign in Slytherin. That seemed to have brought all the Slytherins together quite a bit.
that! I’m doing just fine. How are you?”
The Gryffindor looked at him as if he was assessing whether or not he was being honest or if he had anything else going on. He finally seemed to come to a conclusion and shrugged his shoulders.
Now Olivia and James were laughing and the girl almost spilt her coke, while Potter smirked at them. Draco wondered if he had ever seen the Saviour more relaxed than now. It looked like he was in his element.
The tall man with flaming red hair laughed and shook his head. “My apologies, Mr. Malfoy, but our undercover agent said that Mr. Potter was talking about running away. We needed to get him right away. Luckily, Mr. Wright could be trusted with this operation.” He looked at Draco meaningfully and strutted out of the house.
“Hey” he said and found Harry jerking slightly, before he smiled broadly.
The house shivered again and it even seemed to squeal. “Guess that’s a yes” Harry answered and smirked. “I do believe I’ll have to re-claim it. Because I absolutely love it here! You are going to live here with me, right?”
Blaise looked up from his own mess and grinned at them. “Look at the happy family! Where’s the camera, Mil?”
“Even if my memory isn’t working properly, Harry” Hermione spoke up and smirked at him. “I know for a fact that it doesn’t take you almost an hour to go back to the Dormitory and walk back down. So, what’s really going on?”
The house vibrated a little, as if to say ‘you’re welcome’ and calmed down again. Harry smiled and climbed into the room completely, closing the door behind himself. He lay onto the floor and stared at the night sky.
“I’ve already got one.” Smiling, his boyfriend softly pushed Draco’s hair behind his ear. “When I was talking to your dad after I got out of the Hospital Wing when I turned eighteen, I asked him to give me information for a Mind Healer.”
“No buts, Draco. It’s time to move on and prove that we’re not these bad guys the people think we are. You should move on as well. Being stuck in a meaningless job all day long and doing nothing with your life is not how I envisioned your future.”
“Not too much though, Neville” Harry stopped him. “We’re the evil ones, not you.”
Millicent also walked over to hug Harry and he accepted that as well, giving her a kiss on her cheek as well. This was all followed by a high-five from Blaise and when Harry turned over to Theodore with a huge grin on his face, the Slytherin rolled his eyes.
“Too pureblooded?” Potter asked and chuckled, when Draco frowned at him. “Oh trust me, your mother tries the same with me.”
Harry smirked. They sat in silence for a while, just enjoying their tea and the quiet company. In the background, there was soft Christmas music playing and Harry quickly finished the dishes by putting everything in the dishwasher and starting it with magic. Today was just going to be a lazy day. And honestly, with Draco here, Harry just wanted to do… well, nothing.
“So, you’re saying, Kingsley hopes something bad is going to happen?” Harry sighed again. “Marvelous.”
Kevin smirked. “I did, yes. I cannot believe I haven’t seen it before! Of course Thomas and Melani would work together just fine!” he shook his head. “However, can I ask you something else?”
“Definitely, bear” Draco assured him. “What do you want to write?”
Draco agreed. “How do I know if he’s going through this time in his life?” he asked, looking at Potter. The Gryffindor had lost interest in his teddy bear and was crawling around the edge of his ‘prison’ either looking for something interesting outside or actively trying to get out of it. Draco was somehow sure it was the latter.
“In the middle of the night?! What if Filch would have found you?” Theodore asked with wide eyes.
“I bet” Draco smirked. “Here’s something that should help: Pettigrew pretended to have died by the hands of Sirius. Your godfather then went to Azkaban, where he then escaped to take his revenge on Pettigrew. Pettigrew on the other hand was hiding and pretending to be your best mate’s rat. He was an Animagus, someone who can transform into an animal at will.”
Pansy nodded. “My friend Vanessa signed up for it, because she was always unlucky and within thirty days they found a match and” she shrugged her shoulders, “they have some ritual where they do whatever, but in the end, they actually got married. Yesterday to be exact.” She hesitated for a second and shrugged her shoulders again, as if there had been more she wanted to say, but didn't.
to talk?”
“Something happened to Harry” he explained, not really surprised to see the mediwitch already awake. “He suddenly looked ill, he was tired and I think he had headaches.”
Good news to all our creature allies: Norway has finally decided to open up its borders for all creatures, after Denmark announced their plans of shipping all UK creatures back to England last week. It has seen a massive rush of creature refugees in the last few days and numbers are still rising.
Madam Pomfrey quickly cast some spells, while Draco – once again – sat in the Hospital Wing, fearing for Harry’s well being. After a solid fifteen minutes, where the mediwitch was casting quite a few spells, some of which Draco wasn’t sure were even real spells, she seemed to have calmed down.
“Evan? What are you doing here?” And of course his smile was gone again. Whenever this man showed up in front of his doorstep, something was about to go down – never anything positive.
Rolling his eyes, Harry moved to the side of the bed and got up. “That is absolutely none of your business.” He still felt his heart race the same speed it had in his memory. Draco could still do these things even if he wasn't personally in the room. The power over him was astonishing and not something Harry would have given others.
Draco snorted. “No, you fool! There’s a secret entrance from the library. There was another door but I didn’t want to follow it just in case it would lead me into the kitchen. That would have been a surprise.”
“Yes!” Harry shook his head, unable to believe that Ginny wouldn’t understand. Well, she did understand to a certain point. However, if he were to relax now, the percentage of him dying would be astronomical. “I’ll tell you what, Ginny: When I’m back with the living, I will relax.”
This. Right here. Right now. This was where he belonged.
“Slytherin and Gryffindor do absolutely not match with their personalities! Gryffindors would jump into a dark whole, not knowing what lies at the bottom, Slytherins would find a way to light up the dark and actually
As the Quidditch game crept closer and closer, Harry found Neville, Hermione, Ron and Theodore walking towards him and sitting down on the grass as well. Harry smiled at them innocently, pretending he didn’t know what was going on, though he found it hard to hide his emotions from Neville. This man had an incredibly trained eye, even more than Ron and Harry was slightly afraid that Draco’s and his plan would be spoiled due to that.
Pansy had tears in her eyes and she quickly brushed them out of there, so Draco wouldn’t realize she had them, but he knew it. And he loved his best friend for it. She had a hard shell, but she would protect her friends with her life as well. And right now, Draco was sure that Harry had become to be one of these people as well.
As if to prove her point, Potter looked at her and grinned. “Mama! No happy?”
“I’m never free.” Harry suddenly grinned. “But Aunt Petunia has her book club meeting at two, so I can come over then. She won’t realize I’m gone then.”
“Congratulations, you two!” Harry beamed. “I’m so happy for you!”
“Well” Alamar grinned and pointed at the vase fragments. “Big pieces are the reason why I love him and the small ones are just moments in the last few months that showed and proved to me that we match together and that I am in love with him.”
Draco frowned, but nodded then. “That would be very kind of you.”
The most obvious one? Like… his name?
Draco raised his eyebrows. “So? What do you want?”
Potter seemed to get annoyed by Weasley trying to talk him out of whatever he was doing.
For the second time this day, Draco felt himself tear up. No, this time there were actually tears running down his cheeks and he brushed them out of his face with his open palm. “I just can’t deal with it anymore! I’m a terrible human being, ninety percent of everyone I know hates me, people think I’ve kidnapped Harry and I... it’s just too much for me! I’d rather go back to my normal stupid life where nothing was important to me.”
Harry was giggling in the middle of them and actually got Ron’s attention, before Draco had the chance to say something... Well, he still had the chance to say something.
How had he been so stupid and let his guard down? Yes, Harry meant a lot to him, but only when he was a child, running around, laughing with them. Now... now everything was different. He was a Gryffindor and he was going to stay where he grew up. And well, Draco was a Slytherin. He was more about preserving his life than jumping into a hole and running after Harry. Maybe the memories he had of raising Harry were all he would ever get...
. Was everyone reading Potion’s books right now? It did make sense since they had a quiz the next lesson and nobody was sure how evil their professor was going to be.
“Aren’t they everywhere?” Harry asked and a weak grin grew on his face, while Alamar chuckled.
Harry looked up and stopped petting the animal. “Yes! He’s beautiful and so soft and nice!”
“It is” Alamar confirmed and sighed. “Dumbledore made...”
Potter stood in front of her just like a small child, looking at the floor, not really happy with the situation. This, however, gave Draco a few seconds of checking out the Saviour. Today he was wearing a baby blue jumper with a knitted pattern of a dragon and an egg, as well as some gray trousers and grey socks. Apparently he had decided to forego his shoes. His beard was even more visible than a few days ago and the slightly longer hair played rather nicely with his facial features.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Draco is currently not really working, but I doubt he’d have fun being a professor.” He had offered to be one, though. So maybe option two would actually work somehow.
“What?” Draco widened his eyes. His mother was in contact with Potter? Why had she never told him that?
James and Olivia seemed to talk with no words, while Potter cleaned up the trash from his letters and CDs. Finally, the two teenagers seemed to come to a conclusion.
Harry raised his eyebrows and chuckled. “Is that some kind of new invitation strategy? You want me to spare you the wrath of an angry wife?”
“Well, hating someone and talking to someone isn’t really the same” Malfoy said and smirked. Once again it was this dashing smile that Harry really couldn’t get enough of. He was sure that the whole school was aware that he had a thing for Malfoy, though for some reason the Slytherin seemed to be the oblivious one.
‘I should have just stayed home’ Ravo said and looked into his backpack to find another piece of chocolate.
Severus turned around and narrowed his eyes as he vanished the liquid inside if the cauldron. “It’s different for everyone, Harry.”
? Oh wait, since I am not your son, can I call you Severus?”
He needed to place the Chizpurfle into a container to keep it alive and safe and he wanted to look through the books and figure out why they were standing in this weird little storage room and not in the family library. The rest of the staircase, he could go through another day and time.
How are you doing? You haven’t answered my last text and if you’re not going to answer this one, I’ll be coming by and see for myself how you are.
“What? No, it’s about a penguin! And his name’s not Harry, but Ravo!”
The only person outside their group who also seemed to be worried was Severus. Draco had caught his glance in their direction – mostly towards Harry – once again and he was sure that after lunch, he was going to get a parchment or a personal invitation to go and talk to Severus. Most likely to change the potion again. At least, Harry was still taking the potion. And he did try to eat, mostly when Millicent, Pansy or Blaise told him to take another bite. Which also proved that Draco wasn’t imagining things…
Smiling, Draco shook his head. “That would be a little obvious, don’t you think, bear?” he chuckled, as Harry shrugged his shoulders again. However, Draco decided to tell his ward. “I’m watching a Muggle romance movie. And I’m slightly scared of what people will think of me when they find out. So, I keep it a secret.”
His friend pressed his lips to a thin line, as if he wasn’t happy with what Harry wanted of him. “I can’t arrest her if you’re not pressing charges. However, I’ll need to give her a warning. Because it’s you, who’s asking this, I won’t even put it in her file, so her career won’t be affected by this.” He sighed. “I’ll have to tell the other Unspeakables, though.”
Draco grabbed something to eat, when he cast a glance at Potter. He did look not that well nourished; however, he had always looked that way. Which evidently did not do much.
heard something? Sounds as if I’m not the only nocturnal person in this castle.”
Before he could say anything, Harry pulled out a wand. He placed a spell on his crossbreed and put his fingers up to his mouth. “Don’t talk.” He then took out a small vial. “Take this.”
When Harry walked towards the chair, Theodore had placed both his hands on Draco’s arms, keeping him from holding back Harry. Pansy also stood half in his way towards his ward who reached the chair and sat down while McGonagall held the Hat up.
Chuckling slightly, Draco succeeded in separating them and led his ward back to his room and then even managed to put him to bed. “It is. Luckily, you’re going back to bed. Hopefully, you can sleep better this time.”
“Can’t be worse than the amount of paperwork we usually have to do around Christmas. I’m
“I am” the dark brown haired man said and got up, holding his hand out. “Hi, you’re Draco Malfoy, right?”
“Promise me to talk to me if these monsters are getting too big again, okay?”
“Good morning” the Animagus said towards Eric. Alamar saw how he eyed her sceptically. Even though she was an Animagus and they did side with the creatures, most wizards tried to hide their animal forms. Especially since the Ministry was hunting them down like actual animals during shooting season. So, it was special to see a wizard actually transforming in front of someone. It meant serious business, Alamar was sure of it.
Alamar laughed when Harry looked at him confused. “And our courses will be shorter than Harry’s. First and foremost, Eric: We should get Harry a wand, okay?” Both men nodded and started eating breakfast as if their lives depended on it. Alamar smirked and sent his husband a loving glance, before he grabbed a toast as well.
“Listen, man” Draco turned around and closed the door. “We are not in a relationship anymore! I don’t want to have all this…”
Groaning, he fell on his back and stared at the clouds, rushing through the gray sky. He placed his hands over his face and breathed in the cold autumn air, hoping to know what to do once it had filled his lungs completely. Of course it didn’t happen.
Once Aurora and her human had found each and every evil magical trigger and he had removed all the harmful spells, Alamar told his husband to keep a watch at the living room window. He didn't want him to find out where Harry's room was and probably freak out over the terrible parenting Vernon and Petunia Dursley had done. It really wasn't their fault, with so much magic in the air - but still.
, we should be able to see him whenever we want to!” His eyes were basically glowing with anger, though Draco was sure that he was equally as angry. Especially seeing that Harry was wide-eyed and scared.
“Comes with the experience.”
“Pans!” His ward repeated and grinned up at Pansy.
That couldn’t have been the case, right? Draco shrugged his shoulders and bid goodbye, closing the door behind him, still trying to find a way for Harry to talk to him about what was bothering him.
“Can I watch it with you?” Harry asked curious.
Sighing, Draco nodded. “That was my boss. He wants me to come back and if I do, I get punished with about ten thousand different actions.”
He knew the instant the door opened that he was unwanted there. Behind the door stood Granger, glaring at him, as if he was the grim in person.
Severus sighed and placed the vials on the table behind Harry. “I made a mistake and she realized that I wasn’t a nice person.”
“Are you leaving Hogwarts then, Professor Flitwick?” Ernest asked, directing the discussion back to the professor next to them. Padfoot walked back to Harry, who crouched down and hugged his support dog.
She winked at Harry and Draco, both rolling their eyes, though Harry could only guess what she had said – most likely something that they were cute together. Draco moved his hand to Harry’s lower back.
Severus brought him out of his mind. “Frankly, I have no idea what will be changing. It could only be small features or you could be taller, shorter…”
Harry chuckled and shook his head. Fred smirked and cleaned some glitter off his shirt, while George turned back to Draco and frowned slightly.
Harry Potter
With a loud scream, Harry started running, avoided Blaise once again and almost ran into Draco’s arms, though he managed to evade him and jump over his arms. He had very likely used magic for that and after a few moments, he climbed up the tree.
The look on Ron’s face as he realized that Harry was actually talking about divorce was worth a mint. His mouth dropped and his eyes widened, before he almost punched himself by throwing his hand in front of his open mouth.
“It’s a very specific love potion that leads you straight to your husband or wife” Draco explained, grinning widely. “One which is usually used for same-sex couples.”
