“No! I don’t want to be the one it happens to,” he protested, still filling out his form. “I just want to witness someone else’s fuck up.”
I don’t know that I’ve seen two people more taken with one another in my entire life, and I’m so happy for you, darling.
He worked as a barista at some coffee shop in the area and, far as I’d been able to tell, had little ambition to do much more with his life than continue slinging overpriced coffee drinks by day and picking up handsome blokes by night.
We were both moaning uncontrollably, as though this kiss had tumbled the final barrier holding back our restraint, and I couldn’t have told you how much or how little time had passed when Malfoy finally tore his mouth from mine and swore.
“I suppose it is time for a change of topic,” James mused as he grinned over at Harry and I. “And it was baby stories you
Said kiss, of course, escalated in no time, and next thing I knew, Harry was grasping my cock and guiding it into his slackened hole.
Me, being the idiot, sometimes gullible fool that I am, hadn’t questioned the landlord’s story that I had, somehow, on my fucking meager bartender salary, paid for the next seven months in advance.
“So,” Molly was saying brightly, “That means I’ve only got to bake the barmbrack cakes and then I might have a minute to relax before nightfall!”
“Bye,” he murmured, stretching as he snuggled back into the sheets, causing me to wonder briefly what would happen if I just didn’t show up at work one day.
I couldn’t have even tried to hide the groan and roll of my eyes at that one, and Anaïs even threw her head back and laughed.
It was the last coherent thought I had before Draco’s talented mouth began working itself against my opening.
Harry,” I corrected him as he leant down and pressed a gentle kiss to my mouth, then nuzzled his face in my neck again, and I couldn’t help but inhale the scent of his hair, smelling of shampoo, and sleep, and Harry.
“What are you reading?” I asked, tying the sash round my waist as I crossed the short distance between the bed and the sofa.
“My mistake. You’re a giant cockslut,” Draco corrected, still kissing me, hands trailing paths along my back and sides.
“I’m serious,” Draco continued, confirming my hunch. “We’ll go find some eggs and avocado or whatever if you’re really that squicky… promise.”
A few hours later, I was still researching the philosophy of thought and the mind, and looking up relevant examples, when I felt a pair of arms wrap around my shoulders, Harry sliding his body down along my back, and my brain immediately told all thoughts of work to fuck off.
“And for lunch, we had tomato soup from Polish,” Alfie continued. “With bread that we got to toast over the campfire!
“Then I’m going to need to work myself open just a bit,” I explained, relishing in the groan he let loose as his eyes finally slid shut, no doubt reliving the scene he’d woken to this morning.
He shook Harry’s hand warmly and peered into Harry’s eyes just a tad too closely than I would have liked, personally.
“Something I might help you with, Malfoy?” he asked softly, crossing the distance between us, eyes locked on mine.
I raised my eyebrows and opened my mouth in an expression of feigned baby surprise, to which my companion responded in kind, mimicking my facial expressions before collapsing into a fit of giggles.
“Harry,” he chuckled, still giving leisurely little licks around and over my hole. “You’re blushing so hard, I can practically see it from down here.”
For example, should you ever find yourself rising from a group of British people visiting your girlfriend to make another cup of coffee, please, make sure you remember to ask to refill everyone else’s cup, as well.
Harry was grinning at me, those impossibly green eyes sparkling with laughter and something else that told me he’d quite enjoyed learning that I turn into an absolute Hufflepuff around babies.
Once I did, I couldn’t help but burrow even more into Draco’s welcoming heat, all but smothering my face in his neck, inhaling deeply to revel in that ridiculous, undoubtedly, expensive cologne he used mixed with the musky, somehow sweet scent of just
“Things get… broken,” Draco said with a shrug, in a way that made me think that when he said ‘things’ he meant
Harry ignored it and continued to lick and nibble down the inside of my right thigh, before moving to lap at my bollocks, taking first one, then the other gently into his mouth, then repeating. Licking, sucking, tongue swirling, driving me absolutely mad.
a minute to put up a few glamors,” Ginny informed him, grinning at the dark purple mark that was visible where his neck met his collarbone.
,” I protested, as he leaned in towards me once more, mouth turning from mine at the last second to tease along the side of my neck as he pushed the shirt from my shoulders, hips rolling to grind his naked body onto my cock, now visibly straining against my trousers.
“It’s called novelty, Potter,” I snorted, even as I pulled him closer, leaning down for a lingering kiss, sunset and champagne forgotten for the moment.
“Right. Next time, then,” I said, hoping my voice came out sounding, well, un-Gryffindor-like, I guess.
It took less than ten seconds to find it, disguised as a meditation app to Muggle eyes, but a wizard could see the ornate frame of the Mirror of Erised.
“Did you tell him? Where they live?” Harry asked, straightening suddenly and looking accusingly at first myself and then Ron.
All the while, I watched as Draco worked, reading through the tome, his quill automatically taking notes on the parchment stretched across the coffee table.
of ours really turning into quite the make-out session, “to do whatever it is that you’ve planned for us.”
“I’m sorry, Molly,” he added, turning to face us all standing on the porch, still holding Harry in his arms.
Upon questioning, it would seem that the gentleman in question is a Muggle, with no connections whatsoever to the deceased.
“I need you to make it stop,” he begged again, pulling back, hands holding my face as he stared up at me in anguish.
“What?” I’m sure he was staring at me in a mixture of disbelief and fury, trying to come down from that pre-orgasmic high, to make sense of what was going on.
Our chef was clapping his hands with glee, turning to talk to the other chefs flanking him in Japanese, probably explaining to them how hesitant I’d been at first.
I repeated this — a languid lick and swirl at his hole, followed by a slow, almost torturous push of my cock deep inside of him — over and over, until…
I removed my hand from my cock, somewhat reluctantly, closing my eyes and taking a few deep breaths before pulling my pants back up and fastening my trousers, tucking my shirt back in, then running a hand through my hair, making myself somewhat presentable.
Seconds later, I felt Harry’s body tighten even further around me, mouth latching on to my neck once more and I groaned, eyes fluttering shut as I came, hips still driving into Harry until I collapsed on top of him.
Further north, in Scotland, a brunette with a pixie cut wraps her arms around her partner, kissing the top of her fiery ginger hair, as they snuggle down to watch “Fried Green Tomatoes,” drinking a bottle of champagne (so classy), balanced by a dinner of cheeseburgers and potato chips, as they always do on this holiday — thankful for a bit of familiarity during her first year living abroad.
“Mmm,” Potter made a noise of agreement as he leaned back on his elbows, then slid back so he was lying splayed out before me, eyes fluttering shut, a dreamy smile flitting across his face.
I glanced around for a little card or booklet that hotel rooms usually have listing room service hours and such.
A short while later, I had our picnic blanket out on the lawn overlooking the Serpentine, Harry leaning deliciously against me, despite there being ample room on the blanket for us both.
“Thanks,” he said, turning us towards another thicket of flowers covered in a fiery rainbow of trailing snapdragons.
“Adorable isn’t even the right word,” he informed both Mum and I, glancing from me to her. “I don’t know what is, but this is
I awoke next morning absolutely dying beneath the heat of my comforter and realised I’d forgotten to cast the usual cooling charm I used to ensure I didn’t wake up a sweaty, dreadful mess.
A little later, our starters having been cleared away, our mains arrived at the table, along with another bottle of wine, because Draco insisted that the dry, crisp Riesling we’d been enjoying didn’t match our main courses at all.
Maybe I ought to try Harry’s method of just blurting out whatever popped into my head, completely unfiltered — the thought managed to flutter through my brain before I managed to shut that last portion of my brain up and concentrate on kissing Harry back properly.
a word with your son about that,” he replied. “He seems rather unclear as to proper locations for such activities.”
“You needn’t have worried,” I replied, pulling him closer and resting my cheek atop his head. “Fifteen-year-old me probably couldn’t have swallowed you down so easily.”
We sat, eyes waiting for another dot, ears straining as the cries of the peacocks died away, until it was silent again.
and I burst out laughing as we tumbled back into bed, bodies already meeting, neither of us having any intention of dragging ourselves away from each other until
I was lounging comfortably on the sofa, pulling and rearranging Harry along with me so that he was nestled between me and the back of the sofa.
“What are you doing up so early, anyway?” he continued, looking at Draco and smirking. “I thought Harry
“It’s pretty rare… in most of Asia, really,” he grinned back. “Pretty sure it’s a dead giveaway I’m a tourist.”
, leaning in to inhale just behind my ear again, and I couldn’t help but almost thank that idiot Williams’ for making Harry love burrowing his face into my neck so often.
I sent Pierre-Yves a quick text, asking him to have breakfast brought up soon, then busied myself with encouraging Harry through the showering process without falling prey to his
“Mm, well aware,” Draco murmured, tongue lapping and teasing at my mouth, withdrawing every single goddamned time I tried to capture him and make him stay for a proper kiss, and god-fucking-damn it, you’d think with all the practice I had kissing the sodding bastard, I’d be able to win him at his own game instead of just barely grazing the tip of his tongue with my own before it retreated and I followed, moaning into his mouth like a thirsty, begging whore.
“Better stick to the Bludger where you belong,” Charlie crowed gleefully, zooming towards the other end of the field, Quaffle tucked neatly under his arm only to have his
“Come on, Malfoy,” I taunted, winking up at him. “Admit it. You like me. Maybe even as much as I like you.”
At one point, when he’d been describing yet another one of Draco’s creative retaliations for distracting him from work, I’d burst out laughing, informing Harry that it must have been dually torturous for him, trying to fuck me, when, in reality, he’d just been dying to
His face contorted from apprehension, to confusion, to a sort of surprised acceptance as the flavour danced across of his tastebuds.
, Draco,” I sighed, capturing his mouth once more. This kissing didn’t need to stop, far as I was concerned.
“None taken,” Dudley assured him and I collapsed, nearly in tears, at the site I was witnessing before me.
What punishment does Draco have in store for them upon learning that Harry lived in a cupboard as a child?
“Look! It’s Uncle Harry!” Callum shouted, and, suddenly, every single face turned from the display towards us, and all hell seemed to break loose.
“Yes,” he certified, with another one of his typical little head-bows. “Everything here, many times.”
“And there’s… there’s just this massive billiards table sat right in the middle of the room,” she continued, gesturing with her hands to
“That’s everything he’ll be needing, then” the shopkeeper broke me from my thoughts as he returned with Callum and Teddy, each of whom was clutching a large parcel excitedly.
I couldn’t describe it — the stunned horror, followed by disbelief, then dread, and finally realisation, all combined in one harrowing look.
With a growl, I lifted him from my lap and spun him around, planting one knee on each side of my lap as though intending to let him straddle me, facing front, but stilled his hips, keeping him from fully sitting and making contact with my prick.
The ghostly cluster and Harry were all staring at my father with what I now immediately recognised as stupid Gryffindor-like sympathy, and I rolled my eyes.
I could feel the slick velvet of his tongue followed by the gentle sweep of his lip, and I couldn’t hold back the whimper at that.
share!” Blaise turned to her with an interested quirk of his brow and Harry humphed and glowered at us all from his usual position snuggled into Draco’s side.
“They just didn’t take any,” he insisted, suddenly much more interested in his breakfast than discussing baby photos. “They’re an odd lot.”
“Unfortunately, no,” Draco continued, laughter finally subsiding. “I am still very much on the side of right, although, I suppose I ought to thank you for those wards.
A rich, savoury broth covering a bowl of noodles with the most perfectly satisfying chew to them, the flavour enhanced by a few slices of pork, the green onion, the right amount of spice, and a soft-boiled egg with an absolutely dreamy runny yolk.
“Bessie packed us some cheese and charcuterie and a baguette,” I replied, unpacking the small cutting board, knife, and carefully wrapped platter with Dubliner Cheddar, triple-cream Brie, and Mozzarella with saucisson-sec, prosciutto, cornichons, and a few small dabs of chutneys to accompany it all.
Malfoy groaned and plunged his tongue back into my mouth, swirling it around my own and I responded eagerly, pressing my body up against his, grinding my cock into his hip, relishing in the feel of his sliding against my flank, both of us begging for more.
We were now entering a much larger, bustling street lined with shops selling everything from figurines, kimonos, and edible goodies.
“No, Blaise,” he sighed, resting his head in his hands for a second, then dragging both hands through his hair as though he were about to tear it out, and now I was beginning to get properly nervous.
“It’s one of the four houses at the wizarding school we all went to,” Hermione explained, and I quickly filed away that she was the one to ask when I
, my mouth could have done that,” he informed me, salty as could be, and I allowed myself a chuckle, still stroking gently.
He stared back at me, then he faltered and his eyes shot over to his left, as though looking for something,
My Draco, who would dance around the flat, singing along to his most recent playlist, alternating between positively hysterical, exaggerated antics that left me doubled over with laughter,
“It’s not that he’s gay, so much as it’s with the Malfoy heir. I mean, had it been, say, Ronald Weasley, or someone trustworthy. Nice, you know?”
She stopped walking and turned to gaze up at me, one of those infuriatingly knowing smiles she executed so damned well curling at the corners of her mouth.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Lies, obviously. “He turned out to be intelligent and capable of interesting conversation in
Harry helped Alice count out the Wizard money and Draco helpfully shrunk the boys’ parcels so they fit into their trouser pockets, and we were back on the cobbled street, the children eagerly asking where we
“Vernon!” I called again, more urgently this time, and I was relieved to hear Vernon and Dudley arrive in the hallway.
“I never have. The few blokes I dated where I maybe thought I should, I would just start hyperventilating and freak out and then eventually I just started making sure I’d get out and move on before I got too emotionally attached.”
We landed in a heap in an alleyway just outside of Hush Mayfair, one of Harry’s and my favourite breakfast spots, and I frowned.
We’d Apparated home only moments before and I'd seen the travel brochure with the Eiffel Tower on the front and had nearly squealed with joy.
“This is the oldest shopping street in Tokyo,” Toshio told us. “So, for today, if anyone were interested, you are my friends and I am showing you the number one tourist site in the city.
Alice even found a few that dealt, specifically, with raising wizard children, which we quickly added to Callum’s pile of required texts.
“I don’t know, Charlie,” Hermione chuckled. “That, honestly, might be more of a present for Draco… I have a feeling he
So, it was going to be one of those mornings, hmm? I thought to myself as Draco curled grumpily away from my embrace, burrowing somehow deeper into the duvet.
His hands moved down to begin unfastening my trousers, and I found my nerve, and, more importantly, my voice.
“Hatsue makes tattoos. Some of the best in all Japan,” Toshio added proudly, placing his mobile back into his jacket pocket.
I was thankful for that conversation with Fred — not only because I knew I’d finally found my group — but also because I now understood that, short as his life had been, he’d also
“We pass by these posters of all these drawings of girls in flowy gowns and she just sighs and starts talking about some bloke named Disney.”
“Yes!” Fred sailed gleefully over the table, as always, lightening the mood, passing through Luna and I on his way to land beside Severus, giving him a ghostly attempt at a clap on the back.
I’m sure I’m the only person in the entire world who could’ve caught the disappointment in her voice and actions.
I clambered off of Malfoy’s lap and wandlessly shed both my trousers and pants before kneeling to the side of the couch, knees spread wide, head tilted back and responded:
“Harry, I swear to Merlin, if you ask me one more time if I know what the bloody hell she meant by none of this is real, I will hex you into fucking 2010.”
“Can you imagine?” Draco was asking. “Learning you’re a wizard and having to figure out how to get to Diagon Alley and having to exchange your Muggle money and dealing with goblins and all that?”
a mouthful of egg but Draco, who, I was learning, was a hard feather to ruffle, merely batted his eyelashes at Charlie and replied:
“Well, why don’t you send him a text in a bit to see how he’s doing, or remind him that Draco adores him, and it’s obvious,” Hermione suggested.
“Harry, you just about skewered Malfoy alive with your eyes as you dragged him out of the pub,” I joked, earning a sharp elbow in the ribs from Hermione.
I can keep you making them,” he went on, kissing my other thigh, eyes turning to look at me as he did so and fuck, how could I not whimper at the desire I saw in his gaze right then.
“When did I distract you now?” I asked, leaning eagerly into Draco’s kiss when he returned, no obvious toy or other object that he’d
“It’s, like, you have this little creature that you love more than you can even describe, and who you’d give your life for in a heartbeat, but… at the same time, you just… want to strangle it.”
“It’s Ben!” Harry cried out, flinging the door open and turning to grin excitedly at Draco and Pansy, who
Was I imagining it, because truth be told, I thought they’d be so great together or did it seem as though the two would be a near-perfect match in all things?
Today, however, instead of running to greet me, arms stretched wide for a hug as I swept him up into my arms, already telling me about his day before I could even ask, Alfie greeted me with a sullen pout, tucking his hand into mine, completely silent.
Thankfully enough, the storyline soon changed, and Charlie and I cheered up a bit as Hiccup changed his ways and befriended the little fella, and Charlie even laughed and clapped in delight when Hiccup created the prosthetic fin so that Toothless could fly again.
Can't wait to flesh out my outline and share with you all the stupid crazy stalker and start to wrap up all them loose ends soon!
Or maybe, Father would have lucked out, and one of them might have been the perfect, little pompous twat-of-an-heir he’d always wanted.
Draco only groaned once more, withdrawing before driving back in just as slowly, as though he was savouring the slick, slow slide in, that brilliant tongue of his pressing and furling into me, then back out, and in again, insisting on that infuriatingly slow pace, ignoring my cries and pleas for more.
,” I gasped, arms and legs working frantically to pull him closer, the effects of the billywig making each touch of his skin sliding against my
Harry slowed suddenly, eyes locking with mine, as he began to swallow my cock again at an agonisingly slow pace, and I definitely
I didn’t think I could handle much more. My eyes were positively rolling back in my head as he slowed his pace and began fucking me, slowly, with his fingers.
“Well, don’t let my being awake stop you,” I encouraged, shifting us so that Harry was now laying atop me, pulling him down for a kiss.
“He is watching us,” he warned, before tracing up the undulating figure of the dragon as it pulled the koi fish out of the water so it could right itself and swim back below the depths.
?” Hugo asked, offering Draco a bite of his ice cream cone, lifting the frozen treat up as he did so, managing to
“So… you and Bill seem… friendly,” I blurted out finally as I cut some flowers with the muggle scissors George had found in his dad’s workshop.
“And don’t even waste any time trying to come up with any plausible explanation for how or why that would happen.
I didn’t even have to fake the howl of glee I gave then, throwing my head back, rocking my chair back on two legs, one hand clapping over my mouth as I looked at Tristan with absolute delight.
“I know you didn’t, sweetheart,” I replied, swinging him up into my arms to give him a proper hug, as the situation called for.
magical delights, and I felt my inner twelve-year-old come flying to the surface, eyes wide, mouth agape, as I began
“However, you no blue dragon,” Toshio informed Draco with an impish grin. “You are a leader, yes, but not gentle or lazy, which is also tendancy of blue dragon.”
Saint Potter liked being smacked, apparently. Not that I needed to remember that because, fuck, this was never happening again.
It was perfection — a beautiful sugary coating preserving the shape and taste of the apples beneath, all piled above a buttery, salty, flakey crust that offset the soft sweetness of the fruit.
When I opened my eyes to see Harry smirking down at me, hands threading gently through my hair, I couldn’t have told you if I had slipped away for mere seconds or minutes, and my body was still weak and trembling from the orgasm I’d just had.
older families kept the traditions from the Old World, and so Draco, growing up in the family that he did, would know about some of those traditions and ceremonies that they stopped teaching at wizarding schools in Britain,” Hermione finished.
“Or you could man up and ask him about it and have another one of those lovely awkward conversations that you love so much,” she continued.
He paused, and it felt as though he was looking right into the depths of my very soul and my eyes squeezed shut despite my anger.
. I’m going to fucking AK you into the next bloody universe when I get my hands on you,” I fumed as I furiously paced the reception, finger jabbing at my mobile to ring up Hermione.
“Merlin, how I want your cock,” he sighed, mouth returning to plunder mine, tongue darting in, commanding my own to rise and tangle with his as his hands undid the button and zip on my trousers before Harry seemed to remember he was a full-grown, powerful wizard and vanished them.
that he was standing behind me, hands coming to rest on my hips, and I strained my arse backwards as far as I could with the magical bonds still holding me to the table.
“Right,” Harry muttered, a tiny grin on his face. “No one here would think that odd… me skipping out on an opportunity to play Quidditch or fly.”
on the steps of a wizard financial institution and the wizards left on the steps of a Muggle religious one?”
He set down our bags and opened the door, beaming at us with such an expression of pride and joy that I wondered if he might be the manager or owner of the little place.
you make them,” I told him, leaning a kiss into his inner thigh, gazing up at Harry as he positively mauled his lip to keep from making any noise.
I couldn’t help but lick my lips at the onslaught of naughty memories Draco’s words brought, and I’m sure my eyes glazed over a bit as they flickered appreciatively over his body, but I was soon shaken from my reverie by a small giggle — the couple to our left
“What have you got there?” Draco asked, the usual sparkle and warmth in his eyes already replacing the icy stare that had been there not even a second earlier.
His striped Azkaban uniform hung on his shoulders, entirely too large, making him look rather as Harry had back at Hogwarts, swimming in a sea of ill-fitting, cheap fabric.
Potter responded by shoving back and it was all I could do to keep my hips from slamming forward into that tight heat like I wanted.
Draco set his mug down on the island of drawers in the middle of the closet and crossed over to my side, his eyes flicking over the mess, reminding me that I really needed to tidy my side up before my boyfriend blew another fuse.
“I didn’t quite catch that,” another slow, wide lick before lapping at the sensitive spot where head meets shaft.
I caught his eye and nodded towards the corner of the flat, indicating that we should head in that direction to discuss the non-Muggle-friendly aspects of the case.
“What?” Alice gasped. “You have a hidden room there? Dudley, could you imagine selling magical real estate?”
I leant down to brush his lips again — just a quick ghosting of lips meeting lips — but Harry had other ideas, and I soon found myself plundering his mouth, our hands tangling through each other’s hair, our little charade forgotten, for the time being.
“I have no idea what I’m hinting at,” he began once Colin had left us alone again. Draco glanced off to the side, eyes narrowing in thought. “Or what sort of plan I mean, but I feel as though we’ve a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a lot of fun with our mates.”
Ron looked about as pleased as anyone would look about hearing such details about their brother, and Blaise tactfully turned the conversation turned to more mundane topics.
I spun on my heel and headed towards the door, summoning the bottles in my mind, hoping the hotel had some.
had to go, and Harry figured it might as well be the bad guy, so… cheerio! Have a nice day processing that and all….”
“Did I…” I began, sitting upright and glancing around worriedly, noticing that some people were rushing out of the building across the street, talking excitedly and looking around.
do,” I shot back, allowing my full drawl to come out, partly for effect, and partly just to remind Father that I
“Mmm,” he agreed, flinging his head back, eyes shut, a blissful smile on his face as he continued to grind shamelessly against me.
“I just… it dawned on me that I probably ought to have asked you about the choking beforehand, but it just kind of happened,” he apologised.
“So… is it just… I’m sorry, what’s that word?” Malik asked, looking round at the group. “You know, for people like us? Who aren’t magic?”
“You left me” he accused again, stopping to kiss me frantically, his hands running themselves up and down and across my torso as though he were making sure I was real.
I sagged against him, breathing heavily, then grinned down at his heavy-lidded, post-orgasmic face, leaning in to lick the spot of cum from his chin, pushing my tongue into his mouth, and swirling it around his own tongue.
to have favourites as a Professor, but the littlest Weasley had always had a special place in my heart.
And while I certainly couldn’t argue with that statement, I’d rolled my eyes and had thrown one of the sofa cushions at him when he’d said it.
“Aye, there are still some of those people, thinking those sorts of crazy thoughts ‘bout being better than Muggles lurkin’ about.”
“Where’d I learn to eat arse,” Malfoy was muttering, still laughing, and I felt my cheeks grow warm.
We were now nearly through our round of pints, but I was unsure how to get the conversation steered back to Draco and his mystery man without being much too obvious.
“Look, maybe… hopefully,” Dudley began, twirling his glass in his hands and staring down at it as though it were the most fascinating object he’d ever seen.
“I can’t imagine what that must be like,” I continued as Alfie laid his cheek upon my shoulder, one of his hands coming up to play with my earlobe as he stuck the thumb of his other hand into his mouth.
“What’ll it be for you, then? Would you like some water, or maybe a glass of squash, if mum and dad say it’s alright?”
I grabbed three of her notebooks, the first from before she’d been put under the app’s spell, the second from mid-July, and the third a sheaf of paper from just a few weeks ago and spread them out on the small dining table
Draco’s enthusiasm and fastidious note-taking made the crazed study sessions Hermione organised for us back at Hogwarts seem like haphazard, almost apathetic affairs.
“For some reason, I doubt you would have been amenable to that sort of proposition back then,” he smirked.
’d been quiet mostly on account of these visions, knowing instinctively that she was different and that she ought not to go blabbing to
“You’re not in any immediate danger,” Harry assured us. “But with the crime that just occurred at Gringotts and the two of them getting summoned, it’s best for everyone, Wizard or
“Where would I put a floo in here, Harry?” he’d asked when I’d asked to use it once. “I just Apparate to the Manor when I need it.”
“You’d still love it,” he countered, arms gently encircling my neck as he stepped closer, pressing himself up against me in that manner he had where I wasn’t quite sure if it was cute or obscene, and I allowed myself to lean down and indulge us with a quick kiss.
“Everyone at the dragon sanctuary’s talking about it,” he defended himself, taking a swig of his pint.
Anyhoo. I'd taken to perusing London flats/houses for sale and saving the photos and floorplans of the ones that struck me as "the one" for a particular character, but I swear, when I was looking for a home to envision as the Zabinis', I'd found a few I thought were good, then this one popped up and I was like "I'm pretty sure the Zabinis are real people, and this is their house."
It was untraditional, to say the least, with the children spending most of their day outdoors, exploring the forest via treasure hunts, tree climbing, building dens, enjoying stories, and even simple maths by counting, sharing, and dividing the acorns, feathers, and other treasures they’d picked up during their daily explorations.
“Shut up, Draco,” Micah retorted, and I had to chuckle at the feisty little sprite, glaring up at Malfoy like she didn’t care who he was. “I’m going to order
“Maybe whatever’s going to make you sad isn’t real,” I mused. “Like, we’re here thinking that something’s not real and that’s going to make you sad, but… maybe it’s the opposite?”
off by a positively uncharacteristic burst of laughter from Hermione, who was struggling to keep her drink in her mouth.
“You’re lucky we’re here on a summons and I don’t have the time to hex you properly, Granger-Weasley,” I growled, sweeping my arm out towards the intricate entry to Department Head Bones’ small office that she used for meeting with Unspeakables.
cast some sort of spell to help support me, and I moaned again as Malfoy continued to kiss me, thoroughly mapping every crevice of my mouth, tongue swirling, retreating, and entering with a skill that left me breathless.
“How do you do it?” I asked curiously, stepping out of the lift, trying to pretend as though she hadn’t just caught me completely wrapped in my thoughts.
“How the fuck are you so tight?” I demanded, not for the first time, and he chuckled, green eyes slanting down at me as he leaned down to kiss me again, his arse continuing its slide down to engulf more of my prick.
“I know, and that’s why they’re still alive, living their mundane insignificant lives out in Surrey,” I reminded him, leaning down and brushing the tip of Harry’s nose with my own and his eyes slid shut again, lips seeking mine, and I finally felt the waves of anger emanating from him subside.
Shrugging, I prepared a second mug of cappuccino and then filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner, should he decide to take tea instead.
I had been speaking more and more quickly as I got more excited about this possibility and I stopped now to face Williams again.
Can you even imagine the fucking thrill of having the most powerful wizard in existence, on his knees, willingly sucking your cock and all but begging for more?
I reached forward with my left hand to caress his cheek, and his eyes fluttered shut as he leaned into the caress.
(Also, how the fuck I convinced anyone to read my story given my horrible aptitude at summarizing is completely beyond me, but I'm glad you all did!)
Our first stop has to be Gringott’s, the Wizard bank, otherwise we won’t have the money to buy anything here.
“Please, let us know if there is anything you need,” he said, straightening and handing Draco the key before turning and shutting the door behind him.
“Willow bark,” he explained. “I think you Muggles use it too, sometimes? It’s a pain reliever. Kind of like aspirin.”
I allowed myself a brief internal giggle at the thought, although I suspected both Draco and Narcissa wouldn’t
“Blaise,” I blurted, years of training ensuring that my eyes remained trained on Charlie’s face and not on our target, who had just stood from his table. “Spencer’s on the move.”
“And if it were?” he asked, eyes still trailing over me appreciatively, right hand sliding gently up my left calf, urging my thighs apart as he shifted to nestle himself between them, body sliding up against mine until our eyes were level, his mouth mere centimetres from mine.
“I don’t know Harry, other than what all the books say about him, of course, but he seems to thrive under Draco’s attention,” my wife continued.
Of course, he’d never told me what had worked him up to such a horny wreck, and the sex had been of that
“I need to stop letting this bloke distract me when I’m trying to research,” he admitted, and I jerked my head back up to look at him in surprise.
“It was just a bloody nightmare with this thing at Hogwarts… I mean, it always looked like I was sporting a semi, no matter what,” I began, inwardly groaning at all the little inconveniences having a giant cock brought with it.
She looks at the two roses — one a brilliant scarlet, the other purest white — knowing that, together, they symbolise unity.
But the telly wasn’t quite doing its job to distract me anymore, and I was now curled up and staring out the window again, not even paying attention to what was happening on the screen.
I smiled to myself as I dipped lower and reached the tip of my tongue out to lick lightly up the seam of his balls, returning for another delicate lick, dipping even lower to lap at his pink hole.
“Careful, Potter,” I sighed as he finally slid down, swallowing around my cock yet again, “You’re not going to be able to talk for the rest of the day if you keep that up.”
“Have fun with that one, Luv!” she called out, tucking her arm through mine and leading us out into the street and down Knockturn Alley.
Draco didn’t even flinch, but I understood as his grey eyes flickered across the table at all of us.
The boardwalk stretched out towards our left, heading away from the bridge, while the little beach Toshio had mentioned was on the right, offering a perfect view of the Tokyo skyline against the striking colours of the setting sun.
“With neglecting you like that,” I replied. “Don’t Muggles have people that come round and take you away for doing shit like that?”
“Where are they?” Violet asked, for about the fifteenth time, as we exited the Charing Cross tube and began walking down the small street leading to St Martin’s-in-the-Fields, where Harry and Draco had said they’d meet us this afternoon.
There is no menu! She’s just asking if we want a standard sushi set or the omakase, which means ‘I trust the chef.’
“Merlin, no,” I chuckled, resting my head atop Harry’s, threading the fingers of one hand through his silky tangle of hair.
“What’s the Erised app?” asked Ben, and we all launched into a summary of that stupid app and how it’d been affecting our lives for the better part of the year.
“Sleeping, Harry,” he protested weakly, even as he turned to face me, eyes blinking pitifully up at me, and Merlin, I don’t think he could have been more adorable if he’d tried.
“So… that’s… erm… George’s?” she whispered quietly, arms wrapping around me and holding me tightly as I nodded, all of us gazing down at Fred, who was doing a goofy dance in his photo,
“Right,” Harry mused, shaking his head. “Suppose I’d never thought about a dragon’s bits, but… yeah, sure. Hung like a dragon.”
“I’ve a feeling they’re both bloody well over the moon,” I admitted as the barman handed us our pints.
I went to investigate, but Draco cleared his throat and held out two onions, two carrots, and two celery stalks.
Blaise’s thumbs flew across his mobile once more and a text bearing an address and the name and time appeared next moment on my screen.
Honestly, I’d just planned on taking advantage of the unseasonably warm weather to show Harry some of my favourite food shops in Paris and taking our treasures for a picnic in the Square du Vert Galant, but I frowned, a thought coming to me suddenly.
He, of course, was already fully dressed, looking as impeccably snoggable as he always did, and I couldn’t help but allow myself another lingering glance over Draco.
We continued, hips snapping together in a frantic rhythm, the sound of skin meeting skin echoing throughout the room and I knew release wasn’t far off for either of us.
“So, you two decided to ignore seven years of intense school rivalry to hook up because you were horny? Of
“Well, how would you say thought factors into this?” I asked, understanding Draco’s questioning regarding our department and the sliding, blurry scale presented by Davies and Williams with sudden clarity.
Draco stood and walked over to the cauldron, hand already stretched out to catch a copper ladle that came zooming, again, from out of nowhere, and began gently stirring the potion.
“How are you?” I asked Harry, slinging an arm around his shoulder, pulling him closer and kissing him on the temple in greeting.
Hugo tore his attention away from the television to beam a smile in my direction before returning to the screen where another reporter had taken over questioning Harry.
Moaning, Harry leaned forward and slipped my prick back into his mouth, sliding down, still on all fours, arching his back as the dildo continued to fuck him, and
The empty glass to my right shattered into about a bazillion pieces suddenly, and less than a second later, the miniscule shards of glass swirled upwards like a sparkling mini-tornado and the glass was back to normal.
Harry seemed just as uncomfortable as I’d have been, and he took a teeny step backwards as if to prove my suspicions.
“That does sound fun,” I agreed. “And the weather’s been nice, so maybe Eva did it on purpose to cool off a bit.”
We split the pancakes so we could sample a bit of each, and they were absolutely delightful… savoury pork — roasted and the crisp belly, with the added decadence of the runny egg yolk and the crisp of the green onions.
I turned the taps on the shower and hmmed as the water, just this-side of hot, just the way I liked it, came cascading down around me. I saw Potter staring at me from the other side and smiled invitingly as I turned my face up into the spray. If only real rain could be this lovely.
This, he explained, was “Memory Lane,” which, according to Muggle lore, had served as a black market following World War II.
“Shh, kitten,” he soothed, still kissing me as he withdrew his fingers, lining himself up with me. “I’ve got you.”
It hadn’t even occurred to me then that his distraction might have been caused by a potential love interest.
“My job is to relax you,” I continued as he groaned, arms wrapping around me as he deepened the kiss, plunging his tongue and swirling it into my mouth.
“It just means that each of the children will get their own key, so they can access the front part of the vault to access any money you’ve allotted them.”
or sending each other dick pics and arse pics, or whatever,” Pansy assured them both, causing us all to snigger at our various points of downing pints.
Draco had picked up one of the brochures from the rack beside the desk and was now flipping through it.
“What was the best food moment of the day?” I asked, holding out the “passion” heart, another white chocolate shell, this time filled with milk chocolate ganache and passion fruit pulp, enrobed in a dark orange shell.
“Tomato soup from Poland?” I repeated, purposely not correcting him outright. “That sounds delicious.”
Another table popped away, and I’ll admit, I was more than impressed in my boyfriend’s abilities to vanish complicated glamours like they were fucking bubble wrap.
“Where the bloody hell do you think you’re going?” he demanded, straightening as he turned towards me, eyes flashing. “I didn’t give you permission to leave.”
“Um… I know nothing of cookware,” he admitted, looking up from something he was slicing on a little cutting board.
“Alright, Harry!” I heard Micah clapping and cheering in the background. “Fuck this creep’s shit up!”
Draco withdrew, releasing my cock from his mouth with a moist pop, and flopped over so he was lying on his back, perpendicular to me.
lost Harry for good and hadn’t thought to kiss him one last time before we’d Apparated to the manor earlier tonight?
Luna’s “goat cheese-pear-candied walnut thingies” were incredible, as were the other pre-dinner treats she’d brought for us to enjoy while the evening got itself underway.
His eyes were still wandering cautiously, probably wondering why all the adults were gathered round him, watching with rapt attention as he leant forward to take a tentative bite of the proffered cake,
Without wasting another second, I stormed out of the flat and began striding down the street towards, hoping that Draco’s charm was location-based as opposed to person-based.
“You’re joking, right? They don’t actually eat fish sperm… that’s…. that’s….” I sputtered, unable to think of the correct word to describe my horror.
“Just the newspaper,” he replied, folding it up and setting it aside, then waving a hand to send all of his work papers neatly back into the closet.
There were only two items on the menu, and I sent a mental thank-you to Toshio for suggesting a place where my sweet Harry wouldn’t have to panic over the menu, both of us opting for the roshu-katsu, the fattier, loin cut of meat, as opposed to the hire-katsu, the leaner fillet part.
“Come on, then,” he said, pulling me upright, slinging the blanket around his neck, and leading me back towards the darkened tree-dense park area, looking to any Muggles that might have noticed as though we were heading for a more intimate snog.
I’m completely sure I moaned because, Holy Hecate, this was the most amazing dick I’d had the pleasure of sucking in my life.
“Really, Ron, will Harry ever have a quiet life?” Ginny reasoned with a grin back at me, while Micah’s brow furrowed.
friends back at Hogwarts, really, I mused, as the meal concluded and the conversation continued over spiked coffee and dainty macaron cookies that Harry and Draco had brought back from Paris.
Merlin forbid something mundane like chicken goujons or fish and chips might have taken up precious real estate in my tiny three-year-old belly.
Merlin, I thought to myself dazedly as I, practically involuntarily, fucked myself up into Draco’s mouth.
Next second, I felt the cold, solid head of another dildo nudging gently at my opening and I gave another heartfelt moan of protest.
The kitchen was the centre of the room, as well as everyone’s attention, the staff working like a well-oiled machine to turn out the perfect, crispy panko-breaded pork cutlets that made Tonki Meguro the best spot for tonkatsu in all of Tokyo.
“What? It’s a joke,” Ron reasoned, staring at us all. “You know, how Harry almost couldn’t play that other match because… you know…”
Department Head Bones flicked her wand and a large screen appeared with a photo of a blonde witch stumbling before a brilliant scarlet and white structure, the corners of the roof tapering gracefully upwards supported by rows of red pillars accented with red and gold lanterns.
“What the?” Draco gasped, leaning closer to examine the complex-looking betting system, complete with prop bets, George had set up.
Once inside the menagerie, Violet led me immediately towards a cage of baby Nifflers, while the rest of the group broke up into smaller pairings and trios, each exploring the magical creatures they liked best.
I stopped staring at the window displays and saw a boy, about Callum’s age, with vivid blue hair running towards us, a giant smile on his face.
“Did you follow a rigorous training program to be able to suck cock the way you do, or did it all come naturally?”
“You are not,” I countered, leaning back against one arm of the sofa and pulling him over and down on top of me.
I’d mostly ignored the calls and questions aimed at me, although I had flashed them a cheeky grin and made sure the t-shirt from Charlie was well and visible.
Violet was, apparently, a Seer, and a dang good one, at that, and I wondered what vision she’d seen that Dudley had felt was so important to share with the two as they left.
He glanced at the table, and, seeing that it was empty, continued his path outside, where he set the plate and teacups down.
Harry frowned in thought for a few seconds, then gifted me with one of his brilliant smiles brimming with child-like excitement.
“Meanwhile, I was always stood off to the side, shaking my head, much like Draco probably does with you.”
“It started because I decided I wasn’t leaving without a drink,” he admitted, head tilting up and back to gaze at Draco lovingly.
“Do you want to go talk to your parents some more?” I asked, pulling back and Harry nodded, glancing over his shoulder to locate his parents, Sirius, and Lupin in the tent.
“Harry,” I chided, swatting his arse, delighting in the way in gave a slight jiggle and at how Harry let out a high-pitched lusty sound of protest that made my cock twitch in anticipation.
I didn’t even think before sinking my entire length into him, eyes snapping shut, a positively embarrassingly guttural growl tearing from me as I did so.
“Erm…” I managed, looking around me questioningly. Had I done something wrong? I grabbed at a spare face towel hanging from a towel holder on the wall and scrubbed it against my face and neck, then peered back at Draco.
It was a rich chocolate mousse-type cake with passion fruit set upon a base of hazelnut wafers and popping candy, the whole of it topped with elegant chocolate shavings and more popping candy.
Harry either didn’t catch on to the severity of my glare or didn’t care, although, seeing as he’d faced Voldemort head-on at seventeen, my bet was on the latter.
But now, it lifted, and a pair of hands appeared in the small opening to take our order sheets and meal tickets.
Draco was reading a newspaper and frowning, and I noticed several stacks of parchment and his work folders scattered around him and on the coffee table.
“I’d always heard the French take their cheese seriously,” Harry was saying as we made our way from the shop back toward the river. “But I don’t think I had any idea until now.”
“Yeah, don’t worry, Callum,” Teddy advised. “I’ve heard some wizards can try nearly a hundred wands before they find theirs.”
“I do,” he assured her with a wink, as he continued to portion out the dessert and deliver a generous slice to everyone’s plate.
Smirking to myself, I licked at my palm, coating it, before snaking my hand down between us, not an easy feat with Draco still holding me tightly against him.
“He is coming, isn’t he? I could really use his foul mouth and ability to pull a stupid bloke out of nowhere with his ridiculous dance moves to get my mind off this case,” she added.
“We could try,” Hermione retorted, sinking into the seat beside Ron, looking no less miserable than he did. “But you know we won’t listen.”
“I set the bar high,” Draco added with a joking smirk that set off yet another round of laughter, although, from what I’d heard of the dates he took Harry on, that statement definitely wasn’t false.
My cheek grazed the silken head, and I turned instantly to slurp the wide tip into my mouth, groaning as I reached forward, taking him in, centimetre by centimetre.
“Not teasing,” I replied, already losing myself in the tight heat of Harry, the sweet warmth of his mouth and the way his arms and legs wrapped themselves around me, encouraging me to continue, sinking more and more of my length into him with each thrust until I was drowning, completely engulfed by Harry, and
“In that case, I’d highly suggest you spend some time in the Muggle world, and make a Muggle friend or two,” Draco replied.
Probably because he already knew Hermione worked in the Department of Mysteries and that he hadn’t been inquiring as to which particular room or whatnot.
“Mmm,” he sighed, arching his back so that his arse pressed firmly against my cock, which was quite suddenly very alert and interested.
“You’re nearly an hour late to your own party, silly,” she chided. “We were all sure you were going to blow it off or something.”
We headed for the bar, eyes trained to look for anything unusual, and stepped out into the cool winter air, walking up the pavement a bit and ducking into a dark alley.
“So… she wants you to figure out what happened, then?” he asked, eyes slanting over to me as he took a bite from his sandwich.
A kiss which Draco, obviously, indulged, and I couldn’t help but chuckle and feel a bit nostalgic for those early days when Anaïs and I had been so madly in love.
Not for nothing was he Snape’s godson, and, I’ll admit, reaching way back in my memory to look at the room from a Muggle lens, it was, well, sinister-looking.
“Wait… Harry?” Micah asked, the whole of Charlie’s story sinking in as she leaned in towards Charlie as though asking him to continue.
“I think these two have a little conversation that needs to happen in private. Mind if they use your garden?”
“No! Please, don’t,” Hannah replied immediately, laughing and holding the baby out towards Malfoy, who gathered the little bundle up in his arms, the baby squealing with joy as Malfoy began pulling the most ridiculous faces. “If MacKenzie is smiling, we’re smiling.”
Just kept looking at the stalls and their strange offerings and scowled to myself and at Draco for dragging me here for breakfast.
Then again, given my love life at the time, it wasn’t as though there’d been any chance of him hearing me and realizing that the walls were so thin.
The room was so large, there was no glass encasing the shower, and I noted the floor at that corner of the room was angled towards a drain set between the two showerheads.
looks at someone like that… like they’re a fucking piece of meat on display at the market or something… it’s fucking
“It’s us who should apologise,” Narcissa countered, as I fell into step alongside them once more. “We’re probably boring you half to death with all this talk about the chateau.”
You’ll be reporting to a Muggle crime scene, down in Clapham, the coordinates should be appearing on your mobiles shortly.
I merely raised my arms above my head and stretched, arching my back off the bed, and rolled my feet slowly to release any extra tension and “hmmed.”
“Potter,” I sighed again. Really, was he trying to be obtuse? “Please tell me that your daily ablutions consist of more than slathering that pretty head of yours with shower gel?”
Next moment, Harry had all but leapt from my lap, then had turned to look down at me expectantly before striding off towards my bedroom.
“That’s… good,” he pronounced, eyes opening and staring almost dazedly up at the tube of chocolate, still floating above our heads.
“The deceased is one Ethel Hodges,” Michaels began, our fleeting moment of solidarity over almost as quickly as it had begun.
“I’d hardly call that tickling, Draco,” I groaned, flopping back down, running a hand through my hair and sniggering.
I began fucking him with my tongue, driving it in and out, relishing in the incomprehensible litany Harry was screaming out.
I knew he was mostly joking because he was a little nervous to be hanging out with my ex and a bunch of his friends, all of whom were wizards.
“No,” I groaned, rolling my eyes. “You know what I mean… like, what stood out? Aside from the obvious beaches and gorgeous scenery.”
I’m not sure what the owners or managers of the Henrietta would think about the fact that I was making their beloved home my go-to for Grindr meet-ups, but hey, business was business.
“Anyway, Gin and I were married and awkwardly trying to be in love or whatever, but that came to a screeching halt pretty quickly, and then we were just… I dunno… together? Then we finally came out to each other…”
Maybe he’d agree to alternate between the two to keep me on my toes, I wondered, sniffing at him again, starting as a sharp knock sounded on the door.
karaoke, apparently some Muggle tradition of singing along with songs with the lyrics displayed on the telly.
“Once wasn’t enough, apparently,” Ginny joked with a shrug, although she was still leaning heavily into Micah’s side.
“And the potion’s fine,” I continued, turning my attention to Fleur, switching to French without even thinking about it. “I put a timer on it so the flame will turn off and it’ll keep until we need it.”
Draco sounded angry now, his hand yanking my head away so that his cock slipped from my mouth, and I gave a needy whimper at the loss.
He counted off a few more things — names and details that meant absolute bollocks to me — then paused.
Harry, bless him, turned and stared at me for a second before breaking into the wide grin I usually associated with him.
“You guys are going to want to see this,” one of them said, motioning us over towards the bed, which sat just before the window from which she had jumped.
He trailed one finger lazily down the bumps of my spine, leaning in to ghost a kiss at the nape of my neck, and I couldn’t help rolling my hips back, trying to get more contact.
Draco was now using the wooden spoon to stir the egg and soy sauce, and I did likewise, tipping the mixture over my bowl of rice when he did so.
Seeing as my mouth was rather occupied, I gave a long moan around his cock, hoping he’d interpret my response correctly.
with,” he added, moving to straddle me, arms wrapping around my neck, as he settled himself on my lap to grind down onto my cock, already standing back at full attention.
“Where’d I learn to eat arse,” I mumbled, still snickering, and I noted the blush creeping up Harry’s cheeks and it dawned on me that he thought I was laughing
So... what important business summoned Draco and Hermione away from enjoying the ending of one of the greatest movies ever?
“I didn’t mean to interrupt your dinner,” he continued, straightening his suit jacket. “I forget how early you eat these days.”
“Honestly, Potter,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Could you imagine what an older sibling would do to the younger ones if
Harry’s eyes slid shut as he sucked the length of the glass shaft down, groaning as the ridges played across his tongue, no doubt imagining what they would do to his insides once I’d twisted and teased it into his arse.
It was such a great system that, far as I could tell, had taught our children to communicate their needs and experiences with Alice and me in a way I could never have imagined having done with my parents.
Roger Davies, for example, who was either in denial when he’d attended the Yule Ball with Fleur, or just had a penchant for good-looking blonds, regardless of gender.
wand woods and wand cores and a bunch of other things I’d had no idea went into the little stick thingy Harry had always had on him once he’d started school.
“But, really, I just want to watch you come, and if that means I will always be the one fucking you…”
"That's actually where we're headed – we're meeting with agents from six different countries right now."
I felt that weightless feeling wash over me again, and next second, Draco had scooped me up in his arms, my legs still wrapped tightly around his waist, mouths still connected as though we were each other’s lifeline.
I had just turned my attention back to the movie, quickly approaching its climax where Toothless had
“You know, Malfoy,” he snapped, those eyes flashing. “The one spell I might maybe need you to help out with when I’ve had a fucking dildo up my arse all night and no idea how to make it work on its own,” he finished, chest heaving slightly.
Entering Department Head Bones’ regular office usually wasn’t very difficult, so long as you had an appointment and her secretary buzzed you in.
I leaned forward slightly to wrap my mouth around the head of Harry’s cock, bobbing gently, taunting me, as he undid the first few buttons.
“You’re lucky he didn’t hex you into the next millennium,” Draco confirmed with a wry smile and Ben nodded.
I barely blinked before tossing it into the room, flicking my wand at it to send it dancing along towards the coffee table.
“That’d be the biggest waste of Galleons in the history of the planet,” Draco snorted, and I frowned at him quizzically as I bent over to pull my loafers on.
“Oh, well, I could do that,” I assured them all with a grin. “But I’d much rather do that from the back row, so the rest of you can at least see what I’m commenting on.”
A quick survey of the restaurant assured me that no one else was using the spoon to eat with, and I didn’t really want to stand out more than Draco and I already did in this locals-only place.
“Yes and no,” he answered cryptically, and I quirked a brow at him. “I mean, there is one, but it doesn’t work as well as letting your body fight jet lag naturally does.”
in my arms in our bed in the tent, both of us beneath a thick layer of down blankets, as I pressed kisses into him.
“None of the boys interested had to,” I replied, grinning as I nudged Draco with my elbow, remembering some fellow students I’d seen him sneaking into his bed who I never would have guessed leant that way.
There were more introductions and handshakes, and then a slightly awkward moment as Draco and I both went to hug, then
Each person seemed to have just one task — slicing the cabbage, assisting guests, frying the pork, slicing the pork, and so on.
“Fireworks that dance and do crazy shit that our Muggle ones could never do,” Micah replied, eyes sparkling in excitement.
now?” he teased, mouth popping off for a brief moment before returning to suck me down again, then releasing me, tongue darting out to lap at my slit, grey eyes watching me, looking decidedly anything but adorable.
“Every restaurant does it,” Draco explained as we sat down. “It’s an official welcome into their restaurant.”
“Do you think he’ll still come round for tea?” I asked, taking the clotted cream and preserves out of the fridge.
“Tomorrow morning,” I replied, equally enthralled as they executed their “tonkatsu dance” to perfection before us.
The papa bear in me woke immediately as I scanned the room as though Alfie’s bullies would emit some sort of telltale glow so I could go give them a stern talking to.
“I’m assuming you only date muggles, too. I mean, the Prophet would jump all over the news that you’re gay just as much as they would me.”
“You and Harry seem extraordinarily happy,” Severus commented with an uncharacteristically warm smile.
“Of course not,” she replied with a smile so serene I almost didn’t catch the hidden meaning of her next words.
, but it seemed an easy enough way to get Ginny talking... because I knew she must have just talked to Harry.
“You two need to have one of those open relationship things and find yourselves a cute little wizard to love and make your lives more comfortable,” Micah replied with a smirk, and I couldn’t help but snigger a bit at that.
I begrudgingly left the bath, drying myself off, and allowed myself to get sidetracked by Draco’s body — the way his muscles bunched and flexed as he moved — his cock, flaccid and dangling almost comically between his legs, and I wondered how long it might take me to change that as I knelt in front of him.
Harry’s moans grew louder and more steady as his fingers wound themselves through my hair and his hips began to pump tentatively into my mouth, encouraging me to pick up the pace.
“Gods, you’re perfect,” I heard my voice telling him as I leant forward to suck at just the tip of Draco’s cock, like he’d commanded me to all those months ago.
“You are Malfoy-san and Potter-san, yes?” he asked, his voice welcoming and friendly whilst being quiet and serene.
with the whole life-threatening adventures drama after Voldemort,” he complained, turning his face so he could scowl at me.
“We were just about to eat,” Molly informed them, and I noticed that her mouth tensed a little, and, despite her assurances to her son earlier, I realized that she was definitely nervous to have Harry and his boyfriend over.
“I mean, is it a mental thing just to say you did it, or do you actually enjoy the feeling of a cock practically splitting you in two?”
, as I made a sheepish introduction to the ginger-haired man, that Hermione had been the girl in the trio, all grown up.
1. I am so sorry for how long it took to update this fic. Partly I was working on another chapter, then felt the need to add a few more chapters before the chapter I was writing on, and, well. You get the idea.
The years away at Hogwarts coupled with a few years overseas had relaxed his accent slightly, Draco now leaning more towards the modern accent many of his generation were opting for, and I knew that now he only cranked his polished voice on sarcastically.
“Why am I even surprised?” he asked, looking up at us exasperatedly. “I should know better by now, but still I’m here, hoping he
“Absolutely,” I replied, nodding with mock seriousness. “Certainly not just getting out of bed earlier.”
I’d been musing over this the entire ten-minute walk from my office at John D Wood in Chiswick to the Hogarth Centre, where we dropped off and picked up Alfie from his daycare.
“A tad on edge, thanks to an evil blond prat I’ve somehow let ferret his way into my life,” he replied snarkily and I couldn’t contain the howl of laughter that bubbled up in my throat at that.
“You’re damn lucky you got your magic to help protect you,” Ben continued. “If it were just up to fists alone, you know damn well I’d pulverise your stupid creep face into a bloody pulp.”
There was another pause, and Harry shut his eyes, slumping towards me, resting his weight on one arm.
“Draco,” I began, almost immediately, hoping his brief spike in anger had cooled as much as mine had during Bessie’s auspicious interruption.
“Yep,” I replied, lurching to my feet and making my way to our luggage to rummage about for a pair of trousers, figuring I ought to wear something a bit more work-worthy than my usual jeans and trainers.
I squeezed my eyes shut and curled even more tightly, angling myself so my back was facing him, protecting myself like a wounded animal.
In the centre of the room, an array of cauldrons, a few of them simmering away, emitting puffs of strange-coloured smoke.
My eyes snapped open, finding his grey-blue eyes staring accusingly at me, a grin on his face letting me know he wasn’t actually upset.
“I mean, the olives are good,” Draco was saying, wisely continuing our conversation so the other tables wouldn’t suspect anything had been going on.
Sandy blond hair, dark blue eyes, a jawline that could slice fucking paper, and something that just hinted at a
Blaise’s stare turned back to me as he finished his argument and he smiled a perfectly Slytherin smile.
I was explaining Bill’s job, surprised at how much Violet knew about mummies and Egypt,  when I saw Violet staring at something just behind me to my left.
“My anaconda don’t want none unless you got buns hun!” while pumping his fist in the air then grabbing my arse in his hands, which would have been fine, had he kept it to just ourselves in our flat, and not, say, when we were meeting up for pints with our mates.
“Just tell me you need some alone time next time,” he encouraged hands trailing down my arms to grasp my hands once more to give them a little squeeze.
I was a powerful wizard, sure, but really, we all knew there was no one more powerful than Potter out there.
I decided not to mention that Blaise was half black, partly because I knew he’d protest and insist that wasn’t what was bothering him and partly so I could give him a little shit-eating grin when he met Blaise so
“I’ve felt horrible about the way we treated you since, you know, the Demon-soul-sucky thing, but I had no idea how to go about doing anything about it.
Or maybe even brew my own, honestly, I amended, taking another sip, letting the savoury flavours of the drink slide over my tongue once again.
I frowned for a moment, then retold her my version of what had happened, including my opinion that Ben ‘only wanting to talk’ to Draco was absolute bollocks.
He responded just as eagerly, all but begging me to continue ravaging his mouth, body pliant and yielding as his arms and legs pulled and clung to me, urging me closer, leveraging his legs and arms to grind his body up into mine as I pressed down, and Merlin, had any two bodies ever fit together so fucking well?
True, he’d asked for both, but by alternating them, one lick and stroke at a time, he wasn’t getting anything remotely like the release he’d been hoping for, and the poor man was all but trembling with want at this point.
“How would I know?” he asked, the picture of innocence again. “I mean, I assume as much, but I haven’t, like, asked her, or anything….”
Harry pushed backwards, slowly, his arse taking another centimetre, and I had to close my eyes as I continued to push in further. Was this really happening?
Next second, I found myself standing, all but yanked off of his cock, being spun round in Draco’s arms as we tumbled back onto the bed.
“Come on, Harry,” he urged, reaching down to pluck a brightly coloured piece of paper from one of the pillows that I hadn’t noticed before.
“Felt I really needed one, what, with this prat opening the door,” Harry continued, still gazing affectionately at Draco.
We returned to our table in the far corner, carefully holding the pints as we weaved around the other patrons in the crowded pub, secretly glad for the stabilising charm we’d used so Blaise and I could each “skilfully” balance two pint glasses in each palm and bring all eight pints in one run.
that,” he continued, still kissing, still feeling, one of his hands tangling itself in my hair, pulling my head back to kiss me more deeply as he straddled me, his other hand wrapping itself around my prick, which had, apparently, decided it very much liked stroppy, clingy, worried Harry.
I could see that it was reaching around behind him, working slowly back and forth, I could only imagine, in and out of his tight, pink pucker.
Laughter erupted around the table, and I swear Malfoy’s brows nearly lifted right off his stupid forehead, his mouth dropping open, a look of utter glee dancing across his face.
Understanding the language of flowers was something our kind had passed on from generation to generation, stemming (haha) from when it had been important to communicate with one another amidst Muggles before the Statute of Secrecy was enacted.
“Ooh… this could get interesting!” I exclaimed, hoping that our time wasted sitting in the pub earlier this afternoon might
“I’d be silly not to,” he replied, then, as though just noticing my mates, he pulled away and offered them a sheepish grin
Harry swallowed me down to the hilt, one, two, not quite three times, before I, too, fell over the edge, hips still thrusting into the warm, wet suction of Harry’s beautiful mouth, his tongue swirling and lapping up every trace of my release before letting go with a sigh.
He continued to stroke lightly at his prick, still not quite even grasping it, just lightly trailing the tips of his fingers along the vein, teasing, his knees falling open, and I was thoroughly upset that he’d turned down my offer for help.
“I can speak English, if you would prefer?” he asked, looking from me, then back at Draco expectantly.
Lucius, however, had been sent to Azkaban. Malfoy, as the only heir, had inherited all of his father’s titles and wealth, although Ron and Hermione both said they saw him at the Ministry, meaning that Malfoy worked, even though he had no reason to, from what I’d heard about the size of the Malfoy vaults.
“No. That’s the first step towards rehabilitation,” I explained, and Draco and our server burst out laughing.
“Honestly, at this point, he could just state his business at the gates and I’d probably let him in just to get this all over with….”
I drew in a shaky breath and closed my eyes again, focusing on Draco’s hands and mouth caressing and kissing, bringing me down from the frantic ledge I’d been balancing on.
Because I was raised to be the heir of a fucking idiot who worshipped a megalomaniac both of whom thought ‘alone time’ equalled ‘thinking for oneself,’ and Morgana forbid that should happen.
it, Potter,” he growled, holding my head in place and feeding his dick into my mouth to emphasise his point.
“No, thank you. I can prepare most of it on my own. I only need Draco’s help for the potion, and we’ll just hope he is back in time.”
Baby Harry — who was just as ridiculously adorable as I would have expected with his trademark mop of dark hair, huge green eyes, and the most
Dudley then turned towards Blaise, and introductions went round the group which was, curiously, missing any Hogwarts-aged person.
I had no idea where he was, and then suddenly, his hand was carding through my hair and his stupid, posh accent said:
I hadn’t even realised I’d moaned, like a wanton, cock-hungry slut, until Malfoy pointed it out, in those exact words.
A small pile of notebooks and books sat neatly piled on the corner, looking as though they’d not been touched in quite some time.
“Harry will be so upset if we don’t have a swan,” he added, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and pulling me closer.
Harry’s moans grew louder and longer as I continued licking and sucking, losing myself in the musky taste of him, groaning into him as he clenched around me, drawing me in further, my tongue fucking in and out of his sweet hole as though the universe itself depended on it.
“I’m not telling you to go running home and begin baring all your soul to the man this instant,” I assured him, reaching out to lift his chin and demand his attention.
Draco hardly seemed phased by the attention the creatures were paying him, but Harry and Hermione, I noticed, looked intrigued.
Ron and Blaise insisted that the fact we would even argue something like that, as though it were something worth bragging about, was reason enough for us both to share the “most-boring-person-in-the-world” prize, as my dear husband so lovingly put it.
“I think it’s about time we wrap brunch up,” he stated, grey-blue eyes flashing at me, leaving me with absolutely no question as to what we’d be up to once we returned to his flat.
“And then, I dunno, he sort of… paused and got all weird, and then, when we were done he started getting dressed in a hurry muttering something about being late for dinner at Blaise’s.
“I was just happy to eat any food that was offered to me,” I reminded Dudley, a little more relaxed thanks to the pint.
Little mochi rice flour cakes in an array of shapes and colours, panda-shaped ice cream sandwiches, exotic fruit-flavoured popsicles, and little triangular rice cakes stuffed with something called ume that I learnt were salty, dried plums.
“I admit defeat,” I repeated. “I definitely need to learn more about this pairing food with alcohol business.”
As we all introduced ourselves, I couldn’t help but stare up at the towering white building in the background, the golden letters splayed across the entry telling me that this was Gringotts, the Wizarding Bank.
Once we’d arrived at Claridge’s, we were shown to our table in the Foyer, one of those at the centre of the room with its dark blue circular booth, and I couldn’t help but watch as Harry gazed around him taking in the tall, arched windows and the ornate glass sculpture that hung from the ceiling in lieu of an actual chandelier.
“I’ll tell you one more time to get the bloody hell out of my house!” Vernon added imperiously and Harry’s head jerked to the side to shoot emerald fire at Vernon and me.
“You can talk at me with that ridiculous mouth of yours all you want,” I chuckled, eyes slanting down to meet his own, slightly wide in surprise.
He nodded, still snuggling into me like an oblivious fool and part of me really wanted to pull away from him and stop playing adorable couple for the time being.
“Fuck, Potter,” he practically sighed, hands tucking beneath my hipbones to lift me so I was raised on all fours, arse spread before him.
I was managing okay, biting into a second pasty, this time chicken-mushroom, and complimenting Molly on another wonderful meal, when Harry’s foot suddenly jumped from where it had been lazily caressing my calf to trail
“Like, what if I accidentally spilt some potion in my lap or something and my cock shrank to, like, half its size? What would you do?”
I could feel my orgasm already coiling and building and I squeezed my eyes shut to brace myself for it when it hit.
I slid my tongue into his mouth, deepening the kiss, groaning as Malfoy responded, both our cocks twitching despite recent orgasms.
a child and would either of us really be willing to relinquish some of our work duties to look after a child, and were we really financially ready to raise a child, and not just the everyday expenses, but paying for the holidays and the sports equipment and the dance or music lessons that I was sure we were going to want our child to explore and….
“So that’s it?” I demanded, ire rising again, despite myself. “You just dump him here in my hallway on fucking Samhain, and now he’s
Her legs hadn’t cleared the spiked wrought-iron fence and one of them stuck up through her fattened calf, marring the homey feel of the bright yellow flowers that someone had so lovingly cultivated to grow over the austere black
you can see us,” Lupin finished. “But we’re here for you, Harry. Just as we always were when we were alive.”
Potter then settled himself in my lap and let out the most wanton, unholy moan as he settled his arse against my half-hard cock.
I allowed myself a quiet moan of my own as I pushed past the tight opening, relishing, as I always did, the first breach, only heightening my anticipation for what was to come.
“No!” Draco exclaimed, grabbing my arm and yanking me back. “You have to take your shoes off first.”
I was just getting ready to bring out the teacups when the doorbell rang and I practically ran to answer.
“My condolences,” I heard Draco drawl, his gaze fixed on two men staring into the window of the sweetshop.
I was awake… but refused to open my eyes and, instead, burrowed further into the cocoon of blanket and cloud-like mattress surrounding me.
Three miniature jars, two of them jam and the third honey, sat next to two deliciously creamy French-style vanilla yoghurts and a small dish holding a generous knob of butter.
“And finally,” he continued, immediately sensing my indignation, blue-grey eyes narrowing as he removed the first ball and replaced it with a second, just daring me to complain or interrupt.
Pansy didn’t reply for a minute and I turned my attention back to Hugo, who now had Manon seated on the broom with him, and I lost myself in how damned cute my kids could be when they weren’t antagonising each other.
“Not like that,” he added, hands cradling my face and holding me, demanding that I meet his gaze, and I started at the realisation that Harry had thought I might die tonight.
“Although I suppose you’d have to label yourself a BAH, and that doesn’t have quite the same ring to it…”
skills were definitely not what they were now. I smiled fondly, thinking of all the lumpily repaired items, oftentimes with pieces missing, that would litter the Slytherin common room following one of Draco’s outbreaks.
“Bet you’ve never heard that from him before, hmm?” I quipped, and she shifted her gaze towards me, a mirthful sparkle in her eyes.
“Go on,” he encouraged with a smirk. “You always loved Bessie’s food in the past. Finding out she’s magic shouldn’t change that.”
Potter was almost cross-eyed and drooling in anticipation, and I couldn’t help leaning down to kiss him soundly on the mouth as I unpacked the bottles of still and sparkling water that rounded out our meal.
“When you walked in here, did you suspect that maybe you were walking into the previous couples’ cum-bath?” he demanded.
Draco chuckled again, fingers still working their way through my hair in a soothing motion as I leant forward and nuzzled my face against his neck, inhaling deeply.
I curled up beside him and reached for a piece of the baguette, then noticed a silver tube next to the miniature jams with
“Breakfast,” George muttered a few moments later, stumbling into the kitchen, still not looking fully awake. “Excellent.”
I moved my head to lick and suck at Harry’s exquisite hipbones, hands sliding down to grip at his luscious arsecheeks, prising them apart, kneading them in my hands, before returning to slurp at his cock once more.
sure you’re joking, anyway,” he added, glaring at the man as he sauntered around and came to stand beside James.
“It’s a steaming bowl of rice served with one or two eggs — and not just any eggs, but eggs from this farm in the countryside that are famous, and obviously handled carefully to be safe for eating raw.”
** THIS CHAPTER MAY CAUSE TEARS/TRIGGERS/OVERALL SADNESS... MANY GHOSTS RETURN TO RECONNECT WITH CHARACTERS**
potions ingredients when we grow up?” Alfie nearly shouted while Violet turned giant, hurt-filled eyes at Draco.
The man he’d credited with teaching him to let his guard down, and love, and discover that he could be happy… that he
Laughter bubbled up around the table and when I went to take a sip of my pint, I somehow managed to slosh it all down my front.
“Well, yeah, but, I mean... we had a good time. Don’t get me wrong, Malfoy, I don’t want anything more from you, but in a few months when I’m horny and looking for a good lay, I don’t see anything wrong with looking you up and seeing if you’re available for another go,” I said honestly.
“I mean,” I elaborated, bending my head to suck bruising kisses into his neck. I could already see the purple marks forming and was, honestly, pleased, at the thought of Harry having to explain or hide them
I ignored Draco’s pained expression and subsequent eye-roll and set my pint down to glance over at Hermione.
“Sent him over from England,” he replied in his thick Boston accent. “He’s gonna be working here for a few months. No one knows why or what for. No one who’s talking,
All the while he kept nuzzling at my neck and nipping at my ears, earning him more moans, until the dildo was nestled firmly in my arse and I could only gasp at the feeling of fullness it brought me.
Baby Harry frowned up at Sirius as Sirius repeated his name a few more times, Harry staring with rapt attention.
“I think,” Davies said slowly, “we’ve all been given quite a bit to think about. What if we give ourselves some time to delve back into our own research and we can meet again next week?”
thing just to say you did it, or do you actually enjoy the feeling of a cock practically splitting you in two?”
“Mmm,” he sighed, still sleeping, body pressing somehow closer to mine, and I allowed myself the luxury of stretching my body alongside him, pressing into him, tilting my face up to look at his.
So Tristan didn’t buy my feigned indifference for Harry for a second, it would seem. And, bless him, he was
“It says here you spoke to a particular merchant who is certain she dealt with the creator of the app?” Davies asked, eyes travelling further down the parchment.
“You two must live in the area,” he stated, still blissfully ignorant, smiling pleasantly as Hermione poured him a glass of wine.
Draco released me from our embrace and took a teeny step back — which certainly wasn’t reassuring me any.
“Oh!” Draco sounded pleased, and his eyebrows shot up as a delighted smile spread across his face. “Is that how we’re doing this now? Because I hate you, too.”
“Honestly, Harry was always talking about Malfoy as well,” I confided. “I mean, I remember once Harry told us, all furious like, “Malfoy’s my
“You would not believe the bloody work demanded of me, preparing for that idiot William’s trial,” she sighed.
“Just a small one,” Pansy wheedled. “Like, a simple little tripping hex. He won’t have any idea and maybe he’ll just get embarrassed and go home and leave me alone…
“Pretty sure Honeydukes was out of Malfoy-flavoured lolly last I checked,” he murmured cheekily, tongue still trailing along the sides of my shaft, flicking and swirling lazily around the head with each torturous stroke.
Harry just smirked, and I felt an almost incomprehensible surge of energy, then Williams’ entire created world came collapsing down and we found ourselves in the middle of a cold, rainy moor, far away from anyone or anything.
“I’ve already told you, I’ll give you anything in the shop you want, only it’ll cost you ten Galleons a piece.”
Little Manon, our daughter, had just turned two, and already knew to speak her few words of French to
“Concealment charm. A rather complicated and obscure one,” I answered, mentally putting the spell in place.
I was about to cry with want and then I felt him swirl his tongue around my opening, licking and lapping at my hole, lazily, as though he could, and would, do this all night.
“You’re on,” he agreed, taking my hand and tugging me towards the basin where Mum and Aunt Andromeda had just come up, gasping with laughter and taking the apples from their mouths as they waved themselves dry with a quick spell.
“What have you got planned that you need to get me tipsy, first?” Harry joked, although he did look a bit wary, and I had to snigger to myself at that.
I hurried to kneel across from him and grinned to myself as I cast a quick spell that waterproofed me from head to toe before plunging into the basin, mouth open, seeking one of the plump, pink
“I can’t even decipher this menu,” he informed me, gesturing at the drink menu on the counter between us.
Dad was just plain terrified of magic — that it actually existed and was still mortified that he’d shat his pants when Draco had shown up in their house and had flung him up against the wall.
your room in that giant place?” I asked, frowning and realising that I had no idea where Draco’s bedroom even was in the manor.
Maybe it was because I’d never eaten out as a kid with the Dursley’s, but being able to choose what to eat from such an array of opt
me, it felt like, mouth and hands working down my torso once more, although I noted, happily, that both were touching and travelling at a much more frenzied pace than they had earlier.
I gazed up at him, his eyes squeezed shut, those goddamn moans slipping out of his mouth almost involuntarily as he rolled and slid that delicious arse along my hardening length.
Apparently, he’d got over his initial distaste for foie gras, I smirked to myself, as I ordered the warm goat cheese salad with walnuts and the sea bass with tarragon
on the kitchen counters until one of them would snap back to reality and screech something along the lines of:
“You can have a shower if you’d like, or magic yourself clean if you’d prefer, but you should probably get out of the tub,” he advised, still working the lather into his scalp.
I saw a small figure perched up in the rafters above one of the thick red pillars of the temple, staring down at the three of us.
My attention snapped back to the present, and Harry, as he slid into the seat across from me, rolling his head and circling his shoulders, a tiny groan of pleasure escaping as he relaxed in his chair, green eyes sliding open to make sure I was watching.
Thirty minutes later, Hermione Granger and I were in a deep discussion about the latest case we were working on.
infestation right up,” she added, stepping back and nodding serenely at Harry while I turned to give him a bewildered stare.
“Fuck, Harry,” I gasped as he gave another wicked squeeze around my cock. “If you keep that up, I’m going to cum right now.”
“Come on, Potter,” she snapped, grasping me by the elbow and steering me through the throng of people towards Draco.
“Yeah. You gave me one to use for when I’ve had too much to drink and can’t Apparate,” he explained.
“And then later, we collected leaves and counted them and divided them into groups. I gathered twelve leaves — four of them were brown, six were green, and two were yellow.”
“I mean, I think there’s definitely a correlation,” Davies glanced at me and grinned good-naturedly. “What do you say, Hermione? Seeing as we’re the only two in this room who are in love, at the moment?”
Harry had had his usual panicked expression when he’d opened his menu, then his features had relaxed a bit.
Everyone laughed, and we continued eating, a bottle of wine floating around to refill our glasses whenever necessary
Twenty minutes later, all the paperwork, or perhaps I should say parchment work, completed, our goblin escorted us to one of the several tall doors.
“I think we’re ready for a long walk back to the hotel and then a nap,” I agreed, beginning to pack up our picnic
“I don’t see how me watching is going to help that,” he replied quietly, all of his adorable, somehow-innocent, uncertainty returning.
An hour later, Draco and I were seated in the main chamber of the Thought Room awaiting the arrival of Davies and Williams.
The kids were all so excited at the prospect of seeing their wizard uncle and Draco again, not to mention finally getting a glimpse of the magical world they would, inevitably, all become a part of.
Harry continued to slide that sinful mouth of his up and down my shaft, tongue somehow managing to lick, and swirl, and press into me all the while, and I let myself relax to enjoy Harry’s ministrations.
Molly, in true “Molly” fashion, was rushing towards Harry, a thick blanket already flying into her hands and being draped around his shoulders.
My eyes flickered open and locked with Draco’s as I continued sucking and slurping at his cock, allowing my spit to pool and dribble from my mouth, not only to keep Draco nice and slicked up so that I could continue indulging myself but because I also knew damned well what I looked like, mouth stretched wide and slobbering around his dick like it was leaking fucking treacle onto my tongue.
“I ought to thank them for having such open minds and for the lovely insights as to what a naughty, goddamned
Potter was practically shouting an incoherent babble about the universe being unfair and needing my cock, and I would be lying if I said I didn’t
“You’re welcome, Potter,” I said, sincerely as could be, as Harry’s eyes slid closed, a groan escaping his lips as he rolled his head slowly in a circle, as though releasing the tension he’d been carrying all night, wanting that dildo to fuck him properly.
The app had caused her to spiral down this path to utter insanity, ending with her having taken her own life.
, smiling sadly at the photo as he placed it gently between the next two place settings, turning a grateful smile up at Ron, who had sidled up alongside Harry to give him a hug.
Blaise nodded towards the window where Draco’s unmistakable hair shone as he leant over the counter, deep in conversation with George.
I managed a little chuckle as Harry waved his hand to clean me up and helped me to my feet, his head tilting up for a kiss as I straightened above him.
I forced myself to concentrate, despite Harry’s roving hands, and a mirror suddenly appeared before the telly, right where I'd wished my double could’ve been standing.
I’d even taken to running some of my lessons by her, figuring if she could understand them, then a class full of young witches and wizards, Muggle-born or no, would have no trouble comprehending the lesson.
“Fuck,” he muttered, running a hand through his hair, no doubt realising that Blaise would notice his appearance just as quickly as I had.
“Oh, come now, Potter, you know you could take all of us,” I reasoned. “And I’m sure Micah would love to watch a friendly.”
I couldn’t help but sling my arm around my partner’s shoulders as we ambled up the street, thinking that our “forced” day on Diagon Alley couldn’t have been more perfect.
“Didn’t leave you,” I tried to reason, my own hands performing their own exploration of Harry’s body, hips rising, trying to thrust more of my cock into his hand.
“Yes, erm… he does… tend to leave them all over the place,” he admitted, rubbing at the back of his neck and smiling down at Bessie ruefully.
I had no idea what the nutter was talking about, but something about his tone frightened me more than any of the broken glass, balusters, or other disgusting displays of abnormality we’d been subjected to this day.
“Well?” he asked softly, breath tickling my ear as he nipped then sucked at my earlobe and my eyes closed as my entire body jerked back involuntarily, seeking more contact.
“All I can offer is that I’ve done it and also tell you that I feel there are a limited number of instances where adjusting someone’s memory is forgivable.”
“Is this supposed to be embarrassing?” he’d asked, frowning as he’d glanced down at himself before back up at his perpetrators, genuinely confused.
About an hour later — for a total wait time of two hours and fifteen minutes, mind — we were inside.
“Thought you’d never ask,” he admitted, walking towards me, and I decided that Potter smirking was a decidedly dangerous thing.
“What’s wrong with the way Draco looks?” Ron asked again, giving me a confused glance, then looking down at himself worriedly, as though Blaise might be holding him to the same standard.
“Wow,” I breathed, peering at the intricate folds, wondering if I’d ever be able to fold something this detailed, even with years of practice.
Draco chewed for a moment, then turned back to the house-elf and I decided it was time for me to indulge in my own slice of cake.
Actually, you’ll learn that one your first year, but you’ll start with something light, like a feather, and
“Like you’re not grinding your arse on ex-Death-eater-cock,” I added, raising my hips to meet his downward thrusts.
And, in retrospect, the fact that I’d spent countless afternoons during my summers home dancing around my room to this particular song, it’s pretty sad it took me so long to figure out I was gay as could be.
We should probably accio a spare and leave it as a sorry gift for the neighbours,” he said, setting his water bottle aside.
They returned to the centre in the afternoon, after having played and eaten lunch in the forest, to reflect on their day so their teachers could plan for and adjust their lessons for the following day.
“So… where is dinner?” I asked, about fifteen minutes later, as we exited our capsule, Draco giving a jaunty wave and
“He got enough of an eyeful this afternoon to make an informed opinion, I’d imagine,” Harry commented around a mouthful of pheasant, grinning over at Father.
“Bout time you got here!” Blaise shouted, holding up a bottle of champagne and motioning for us to join him and Anaïs.
Then, suddenly, Narcissa was in what I recognised to be Draco’s sitting room, an almost girlish giggle at her lips.
I had no idea who the man was, but Ethel’s last thoughts had completely focused on him with an almost frightening intensity.
Light bulbs, windows, and, from what I could tell, most of the glasses in our kitchen continued to shatter and break.
Occasionally, another idiot moron tried to use it for personal gain, totally ignoring the carefully worded warning that came with each purchase.
“Draco, what’s going on?” Ben asked, still glancing nervously around the room, then at Draco, who had his head resting in his hands.
“Darling, it would appear that both Harry and I know it will take you much longer than that to get ready.”
The prize I was given seconds later was not, however, Draco’s beautiful cock running along the seam of my lips, nudging them open, but the smooth rubber of the black dildo.
“Father was still on house arrest awaiting sentencing and was driving her mad and I’d just been named Lord Malfoy, so there was mountains of paperwork to go over…”
Harry blanched suddenly, one hand reaching out to grab at my suit and twist, nervously pulling me closer.
Malfoy’s eyes, I noted, followed my every movement, and even though he’d just cum beautifully mere seconds before, his magnificent dick gave an interested twitch which I took as a massive compliment.
“I mean, aside from the fact that he hated Muggles and you hate wizards,” he corrected himself, eyes running up and down Vernon’s person once more.
“These,” he replied softly, hand reaching into his pocket to dangle what appeared to be three black spheres in front of me.
Don’t get me wrong; I loved Callum and spoilt him thoroughly, but I could see right through Alice’s scheme behind it all.
“I suppose once you’ve had your face buried up a man’s arse you’re allowed to use his given name,” he reasoned, “Although Potter does have a certain ring to it. I suppose I’ll use both.”
hard to admit that I didn’t want to be mean anymore, and then I had to kind of work at it, so… I was
Rather than obey, Draco merely let out another series of anguished sobs as he shoved his plate of food away from him, dramatically hiccoughing and gasping for more air as he continued to howl and blubber.
Never, in my entire life, could I have possibly imagined a more vapid, mundane community than this fucking shithole where Harry had spent the formative years of his life.
Then we sat at the bar, waiting and watching, as the crowd in the bar continued to swarm around Harry and Draco.
“Being fashion-conscious and understanding what a quality fitting is has nothing to do with being gay,” he countered.
That crude sentence coming from the mouth of Hermione Granger-Weasley was enough to set the whole table laughing again.
“How will we get our room key?” Harry asked as I handed our room key to the young man behind the desk — Sawa-san had retired for the evening, it appeared.
He stopped and smiled at me again, taking my hands in his and rubbing his thumbs across my palms reassuringly.
I was so lost in my thoughts, I barely noticed another ginger-haired man stepping out of another shop up the street, laughing and greeting Harry, Draco, and Hermione.
I averted my gaze from him as I slid my way up his body, arranging ourselves so that we were laying, facing each other, legs entwining, arms holding each other close, lips meeting for a sweet, lingering kiss.
Little Forest Folk, it was called, and all of our children had gone to nursery school here — another point of contention with my parents.
“Let’s not talk about other boys right now,” I suggested, pulling Harry back towards me and bending down to plant a kiss just behind his ear.
“If you order it then you’ve got to eat it,” a drawl I recognised, even after all these years, scolded, and I glanced up to see Lord Malfoy himself leaning against the door, taking a sip from the glass of whiskey he held in his hand, a teasing smirk on his face.
My arms reached around him, one hand threading through his messy black locks to pull him down for a kiss, groaning as he tilted his head so his mouth fit perfectly against mine, that wicked tongue of his licking into me as he sighed in contentment.
“I have to go,” I explained hastily, clambering over Harry and dashing into the bathroom, giving my mouth a hasty, cursory scrub with my toothbrush, leaning down to rinse and splash my face with water, completely forgoing my morning routine.
He let this continue for a few strokes before adding a second, working them inside of me, still maddeningly slow.
like having fresh rosemary in the kitchen, not to mention it keeps mosquitos and other bugs at bay.”
“This is honey water,” he went on, pouring a large jar of honeyed liquid into the cauldron and floating it over to the open flame on the stove.
“We could ask Fleur if we can help,” I agreed, brain returning to the present and my conversation with Micah.
with, what seemed to me, every pre-teen boy’s dream of disgusting bits and pieces of squishy animals, and Teddy immediately grabbed Callum by the hand to show him around the displays in the shop.
“Yes, my Lord,” I replied, almost breaking character and smirking when I saw the almost imperceptible gasp he gave.
“What? Do I wish you’d come at me, eyes blazing, all, I’m-Harry-Potter-Saviour-of-the-World-Fuck-Voldemort and shove me down on the bed and have your way with me?” he asked.
“I was asking Draco how he kept his job hidden from his Boston boyfriend,” I replied, eyes narrowing.
Of course, my freak-of-a-sister’s no-good son would go find himself a boyfriend who was not only also an aberration, but insane as well.
She’d also decided I needed to get my eyesight fixed, so I'd subjected myself to the slightly scary experience of having a Medi-Wizard fire a few spells at me to correct my vision.
“Sorry about that. It’s been a bit crazier than usual, appearing in public these past few months. Some people are still… not too keen on the fact that I’m gay.”
I was rather full, and Apparating somewhere just to sit in the lobby didn’t sound like much fun, either.
against my entrance, Draco wasting no time gently nudging it into me, repeating the process with the third.
“How are you even playing Squares on this?” I asked, genuinely curious as I stared at the grid filled in with all of our mates’ and families’ initials.
“Let's move on… so you two hooked up that one time… when was that, by the way?” her eyes narrowed suspiciously at Draco.
"Old Man Edward White's going to have to restock all of his supplies?" I grinned, knowing one of Draco's favourite glamours was an eighty-seven-year-old man who turned up in Knockturn Alley from time to time to refill his stores of highly suspect potions ingredients.
,” he groaned suddenly, hips slowing just slightly as he continued to plunge his entire length in and out of me — three long, hard strokes — his eyes sliding shut, a look of utter bliss flitting across his face, before his hips stilled and he all but collapsed on top of me.
“No, nothing,” he continued, eyes snapping open to glare down at me, although he made no move to remove himself from my mouth, sucking determinedly at his prick, still semi-soft, but rapidly filling out.
“Yes, that might be a good idea,” Draco agreed, smirking over at me, and I nearly stuck my tongue out at him, then realised that probably wasn’t something I should do while stood in the lobby of such a fancy hotel.
She paused and glanced at her daughters, Victoire, focused on her wreath, and Dominique, standing once more to show her somersault skills off to her mum.
They were good, I supposed, I mean, if I was trying to show this bloke that I had a cock that could please even the pickiest size queen. I didn’t get it, personally, but was glad there seemed to be a host of blokes out there looking to split themselves open on my cock.
“Holy Hecate,” I muttered, leaning forward to take another bite. “That might be my new favourite thing on earth.”
Potter,” he rasped, eyes squeezed shut above me, hands clenched on the vanity either side of my hips. He seemed to be battling something internally and stormy blue-grey eyes opened to flash angrily down at me. My own hands, which had been tangling happily in his own locks, slowed hesitantly.
“Merlin, not you, too! I’ve had this one here asking me silly questions about bloody flowers all afternoon.”
“What’s that mean?” Ben asked worriedly, hands flying up to pat himself up and down along his torso as though he might feel some sort of device there. “Is that dangerous?”
“You’re crazy if you think you’ll be rid of me after just one lifetime,” I retorted even as I pulled him to me for a kiss, revelling in how warm and soft his mouth was, another shuddering cry rippling through me as I wondered what if I
“Draco,” Harry was saying between kisses because neither of us was going to consider stopping for something as silly as talking.
His great-great-great-great, however-many-generations-back, grandfather came with William the Conqueror back in 1066.
“All joking aside, Harry,” George continued, seriously. “All of us here are damn lucky to call you friend, and we wish you the happiest of birthdays. Everyone raise your glass to Harry!”
When I finally did open them, I found myself staring into Harry’s brilliant green ones, a grin quirking down at me.
is the killing curse. It kills you instantly. Just… poof, and you’re gone,” she explained to Micah quickly, then returned to her musings.
the US? The horror!) and my defence of Muggle-born wizards, all served up with a healthy portion of nit-picking from dear old mum and dad.
“When do you know it’s time to stop fucking me open with your fingers or your mouth, and begin fucking me proper with this insanely perfect cock of yours?” I demanded, still kissing him, as I removed my fingers and began stroking lube along Draco’s cock.
He flung open the closet doors on the wall opposite his bed and waved a hand so that it quadrupled in size. Of course.
“Bon appétit,” he said, standing and turning to exit the room, and I finally turned my attention to the spread before me.
I allowed myself the pleasure of looking up at him as I tugged both trousers and pants off, and appreciated, for the millionth time, the absolute perfection laid out before me.
“Care to join me for a shower?” So, not a quick shower, then. “I know at least one of us is absolutely filthy.”
Lucius and Narcissa glanced from their son, then at each other, clearly not strangers to Toddler Draco’s fits.
“For fuck’s sake, can’t you just shut the fuck up?” he demanded, as Draco spun out of Harry’s grasp and Vernon suddenly found himself slammed against the wall, a good metre and a half off the floor, as though an invisible hand were holding him and dragging him up the wall to the second floor.
-slackened mouth, to the perfect tilt of his head, and I briefly wondered how many times he’d fooled his mother with this look before she’d realised her son was a cunning, conniving, devious little devil.
Alice just rolled her eyes and didn’t even bother trying to stop me, knowing full well her elbows and pointed looks would do nothing this far in our relationship.
“Obviously, Ginevra,” Draco scoffed good-naturedly, turning to allow Blaise to fill his glass once more.
Honestly, we’d been anticipating a text from Harry sometime this morning seeing how he and Draco had left last night.
“So, Harry, dear,” she smiled at him, resting her chin on her clasped hands and leaning towards him. “What have you been up to since we last met? And I don’t mean all that drivel they insist on printing in the Prophet, mind.”
I want you to keep that bit of information tucked away in the back of your minds during this meeting.
“Honestly, Harry, do you even listen?” Draco demanded, pulling me into his arms and feigning exasperation.
Agonisingly so, and while many assumed it was part of his Malfoy, pureblood-obsessed upbringing, it really wasn’t.
Course, I’d just sat around, sneaking glances at Ginny and waited for her to approach me, so maybe that was just how I operated.
“No,” I agreed with a shiver, remembering Crabbe in the Room of Requirement, throwing Unforgivables and casting the
I was just as eager to have his cock inside me as he was, and I felt I’d deprived myself for the sake of giving Draco a taste of his own medicine long enough.
I wasn’t sure what he meant, so I just relaxed, nearly fully submerged in the tub, looking at the greenery outside, letting my mind drift, and eventually, my eyes fluttered shut.
“You were with that bloke, and then what? Did you invite lover-boy over to spice things up or something?”
Malfoy, somehow, was managing a litany of filth despite fucking me so hard and fast into the mattress that I could barely breathe.
“I’ve been doing my damndest to meet other blokes and stay away from him,” Harry admitted, scratching at his stubble
dealt with was the work of a bloody nutter,” Draco repeated, crossing his arms in front of him as though daring any of us to counter him.
“He kept subtly watching movies and TV shows that mentioned witches or witchcraft, and, somehow, got her really into that show,
“It’s pasta with tomato sauce,” Narcissa explained. “And cucumber slices on the side and banana for dessert. Those are your favourites.”
It was a good forty or so minutes later before I found myself gasping, recovering from what, as promised, had been the most earth-shattering orgasm of my entire life, clinging to Draco Fucking Malfoy as we both lay collapsed on the couch, panting for breath, sticky with sweat and semen, limbs entangled, hands running constant paths
Honestly, tho. Thank you all for being so positive, and expressing questions or feedback in a constructive or questioning light. We're all here for the same reason, namely, Drarry, right?
“I’m never going to be able to look her in the eye,” he informed me and I tilted his head up to brush his lips with my own.
“But you needn’t get so upset over them,” he chided gently, selecting an olive from the plate and lifting it to my mouth.
“Or if you even care what I think on the matter,” I added quickly, holding up a hand as Draco straightened in his seat and his eyes narrowed ominously once more.
“Of course I’m alright,” he grinned, sending the giant tome in his hand over towards his dining table as he held his arms out to embrace us each in turn.
He was moving again, coming to stand behind me, watching the swirled glass dildo twisting slowly in and out of my arse, hands reaching down to pull my cheeks open, spreading me even wider so he could watch as my hole swallowed the dildo, then the pink rim stretching open as it swirled out, the green ridge pulling at it unevenly, catching as it clenched around the wide head, not letting it slip out, before returning to twirl back in.
My musings were cut short as I caught a flash of silver from the corner of my eye and I turned to watch Draco come sauntering down the stone stairway into the garden.
“What’s going on now? Why are you here and not lavishing him with your affection or one of your famous debt-cancelling blow jobs?”
He then picked up our bags and led us down a hallway, politely declining our offers to carry them on our own.
“Have a good weekend?” Davies asked, taking the seat opposite me. “Hope you two had some actual time off, what with this case.”
Malik and I were just staring, jaws open, and Pansy shot Harry a dirty look from her seat beside us on the “real” sofa that faced Draco’s tv.
“I… I got…,” I began, then changed my mind. “It just… frustrated me. Brought me back to being a bloody adolescent at Hogwarts.”
“This morning,” he murmured, head tilting down to kiss me, hands already fumbling to find their way beneath the hem of my sweater and shirt to tug them up and over my head, my own hands unclasping from his neck to help as we began the now-familiar stumble down the hallway to his room.
“We’re going to get to the bottom of this. We’re going to meet your mystery lover-boy. You might as well drop the fucking act and be stupid and happy and gushy about it, already.”
“Harry, what are you staring at?” Draco asked, and I turned away from the temple to explain what I’d seen to both men.
“But you’d nearly fallen asleep in the bath,” he continued. “Perhaps it’s time to get out and go out exploring some more?”
I nearly kicked myself for almost having said Harry’s name aloud, even though I was sure two other Unspeakables would understand the need to keep that information to themselves, had I actually slipped up.
of our clothing, eager to feel the slick slide of his skin, so warm and fucking soft, like the finest satin, beneath my hands.
“I’m too damned picky,” Pansy grumbled, tucking her arm into Draco’s right one even as he checked his mobile, pulling us along through the crowd. “I don’t have to explain to either of you how insufferable men are these days.”
“Draco?” Harry asked, and even though it was too dark in the room to really see his face, I knew he was frowning.
“Patience, kitten.” He withdrew his entire length and next I knew, his mouth was fastened to my hole again, tongue swirling and I’m sure my eyes rolled back in my head.
All the while, Potter was giving the most delicious moans, and I finally gave in and swirled my tongue around his sweet, little pucker.
“I don’t know,” I sighed. “I mean, we were in the locker room, and I don’t remember who it was, but some teammates thought… well, you know… thought I had a sore throat.”
“Well, if you decide you want to, I’m all ears,” I reminded him, pouring tea into two mugs, setting one on the edge of the table closest to him, before rising again to grab the food.
“I already told you, you have me,” I repeated, pulling away, understanding that Harry needed to concentrate.
“I would’ve ordered you a pint, then realised I have no idea what you two like. Paid for this first round, though. Just have to let the barman know your order… your… he’s coming, right?”
"But, to bring us back on topic,” he continued, because, of course, he would, “I think you’ve a point, Davies. I think when one is falling in love it feels very much like obsession, and it should, do you agree?”
“I can see your flat,” I informed Draco, leaning back against him and looking out at London sprawled out before us in the golden light of the sunset.
We took our time, snuggled beside one another on one of the leather couches, sipping our drinks and feeding each other bites of our respective mid-morning snacks — Harry had opted for a luscious slice of cheesecake covered with a fresh passion fruit coulis and I had, predictably, ordered the chocolate cake.
“Draco,” Mum greeted me, eyes sparkling with laughter, holding out an arm to pull me in for a hug, head tilting up to kiss my cheek.
To cancel spiritual debts, or real debts, I suppose, not that I’d ever had any of those, and contemplate the fleeting brevity of life on earth, hoping, with each passing Samhain, that when you finally stepped beyond the veil, you would be ready to greet those on the other side peacefully and leave behind only cherished memories.
“Yeah, I got pulled along with Hermione, Draco, and Harry when that idiot turned Ben into a Portkey,” Micah piped up.
I paused, daunted, frankly, by the overwhelming sense of urgency that I was drowning in, wanting to make the most of every precious moment I had with my godfather and not knowing quite where to begin or how to pick through the milestones of my life to share the most important.
“Harder?” he gasped out, hips slamming into me so hard it felt as though my teeth were shaking, as he answered one of my, apparently, mindless demands.
“Skip dinner?” Draco repeated frowning. “Shouldn’t take you that long to get some information out of him.”
I glanced over at Harry, taking a sip of champagne as I watched his eyes begin scanning the extensive menu at an almost comically fast rate, as though there was a correlation between how quickly his ideal breakfast would pop out at him and how quickly he read the menu.
