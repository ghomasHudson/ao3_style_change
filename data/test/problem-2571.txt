Malfoy looked exasperated. “Oh, alright, fine.” He walked over to Teddy like a man walking to his death, which Harry had experience with, shot Harry a nasty look, and said, “Hi, Teddy, what are you drawing?”
“What,” Harry repeated.
, but he almost did. That was how he should have known he was in trouble, even back then.
“Oi, we’re running low on Floo powder, be careful,” Harry says. Once she’s gone, he turns to Malfoy. “What did she say to you?”
Muggle Studies had been required before, I’ve spent seventeen years not knowing what the cinnamon is! It’s exactly like magic.” Malfoy’s voice had started to get more and more excited as he rambled on, like he’d forgotten who he was talking to.
been trying to be nice for the past week,” said Malfoy stiffly.
“Why do you smell like rosewater?” Harry sniffs suspiciously. “Are you following Sirius’s skin care routine?”

“I noticed,” Malfoy says dryly.
Malfoy sat at the Slytherin table with Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, the latter of whom deigned to give Hermione a nod. Malfoy did not give Harry a nod. He kept his head down, but Harry thought he looked a little better than he had yesterday.
“And now I’m not. Isn’t it fascinating how that works?”
────────────
“Yes,” Malfoy said, looking distraught, “and I asked Susan, because everyone knows you go to Hufflepuffs to help you find things and she couldn’t find it there, and then Padma rudely stole her away from me.”
Harry’s heart twists. “Do you – do you want to stop?”
“Now mind your own business,” says Harry sternly to his friends. “Talk about the Chudley Cannons, or Blaise’s depressing love life.”
this is happening to me – ”
“I don’t know, that’s in the future.” Harry looks back at Narcissa anxiously. “Right now, I want to be with your son, and treat him well. That’s all that matters, isn’t it?”
Harry does wish Ginny were here. “That’s nice of you, to, er, ease me in,” he says, trying not to make it sound like a question. “Are you and Ginny good friends then?”
Hermione tutted disapprovingly, but she was having a tough job suppressing her own smile.
“Are you alright?” said Hermione, while the rest of their housemates watched on in interest, most of them staring suspiciously at Malfoy while the Slytherins glared at Harry.
“Oh, goodness no,” McGonagall said, “or, occasionally – I suspect, at least – it was far more your father and mother that – or Mr. Black and Remus – ”
The next time he woke up was to the sound of birdsong and the morning sunlight casting a glow across the room. He looked, again, at Malfoy’s bed. Malfoy was sitting up too, his pale hair sticking up and falling over his eyes.
“It was my fault, I suppose,” Pansy says, her voice bitter. She doesn’t give any details, and Harry doesn’t ask her to.
Malfoy had become something like a friend. They learned little things about each other, most things annoying – like Harry’s hair all over the shower and Malfoy’s hair products all over the flat – but some things strangely compatible – like their taste in Quidditch teams and what they should have for dinner. They knew how to navigate each other’s tumultuous moods and when to leave each other alone and when not to. So if Harry had known then the ridiculous situation he would end up in if he continued living with Malfoy, he probably would have kept on going.

“Ginny has a lot of people looking after her,” Harry said, “and most of all she’s got herself.”
he wasn’t supposed to –
“Nothing has to change,” Harry said. “I mean, we can wait, we don’t need to tell everyone – ”
“I know!” Harry says. “I know. All of you were right, and I was wrong. I’m – an idiot. He doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me, Hermione. He just has an – attraction or something.”
“Lots,” lied Harry around a yawn. “Look, Blaise is.” Another yawn. “Approaching Ginny.”
it be,” Harry said. “I don’t have a crush on Malfoy.”
He still didn’t see where Malfoy came into this, though.
“I’m kind of a coward,” Malfoy said abruptly. “More than kind of. I might have been the one to kill Dumbledore if you hadn’t made me change my mind. You didn’t have to do that. Why did you?”
, Malfoy had said. “I,” Harry said, “well, I – yeah, I would. I would.” He got up from the chair, and stopped. “Professor? Who was it that Malfoy reminded you of?”
She makes a grand exit. Hermione says, “It’s pub night today isn’t it? We’ll talk about this then, Harry, I’ve got a meeting in ten,” and follows suit.
Blaise opened his mouth to start on the speech that the Ravenclaws and Hermione had helped him write, and stammered out a few sentences before Ginny had stood up, swung her arms around his neck, and kissed him. Blaise stood still for a moment before he started kissing her back passionately.
for a few moments, oh, no big deal then, I’m Harry Potter and I come back from the dead, it’s a
Ron blanches. “Let’s talk about something else.”
They went back to Hogwarts together; Ron and Hermione threw themselves at him, and gave Malfoy a tiny spasm that looked like a nod. Blaise greeted them both impassionately, and Daphne immediately dragged Malfoy away to play with his hair.
, you’re meeting Rafael
“You already said that.”
“We need to.”
“Hi Harry,” said Parvati brightly. “We thought about having a little get-together, all of us, since it’s the weekend and all.”
Malfoy is waiting for him.
you.”
“What do you mean you have to talk to Blaise?” Malfoy said, sounding panicked.
“This is one of the oldest wizarding homes in Britain!” Malfoy said. “Your poor house elf isn’t going to be able to do everything, you know.”
Harry could understand about family; he would do anything for Sirius and Remus, would have done anything for his parents. If Harry could convince Malfoy – if he could thwart Malfoy’s plans, he could thwart Voldemort’s.
“Mhm?” Harry says blurrily, forcing his eyes open. Malfoy’s hand had been outstretched for Harry’s, before. Now he can see that in his sleep, when Malfoy had left, Harry’s own hand is extended, waiting for Malfoy.
“I did not know, er,” Malfoy says, with a raised eyebrow. “Can I buy an Acid Pop before we have an actual conversation about…” Malfoy hesitates.
Rafael turns to Malfoy. “And this is?”
Hermione smiles.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, eyes glimmering, and nodded towards the door.
“I’ll put the kettle on, shall I?” Sirius offers, probably so he can escape this conversation, and at Remus’s affirmation, flees into the kitchen like Harry does in uncomfortable situations.
“Who would you use?” Ron says. “Just want to make sure my hypothetical nephew has a good mum.”
that it’s any of your business, but Harry hasn’t been sleeping,” Hermione fired at Zabini furiously, “and I wasn’t about to let you wake him up, it’s good for him to – ”
Malfoy looked extremely gratified when Harry almost snorted with laughter and spit out his drink at his Slughorn impression. “This is the kind of reception I deserve,” he said, tapping his foot against Harry’s approvingly, “although I recall never getting it from you before.”
Harry is uncomfortably aware of what, exactly, it looks like: Malfoy, sitting close to Harry, ankle hooked around his – because that’s the way Malfoy
This made Teddy laugh and say, “You’re slow truck.”
“Did you,” Harry ventured cautiously, “did you say...her?”
“What is wrong with you?” Malfoy shouted, still laughing even though Harry wasn’t tickling him anymore and tossing a pillow at him that Harry caught with six years of Seeker’s reflexes.
“Then,” Malfoy went on, clearly entertained, “you do go out with Cho Chang after all, except you break up because you’re a horrible boyfriend. Then you go out with your best friend’s little sister, who had previously been dating Dean Thomas. You break up with your best friend’s sister and shag Seamus Finnegan, who is the best friend of your ex-girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend. And
Harry looked up – up, and up, Malfoy had grown a few inches taller than him and it was
“It’s a good class,” said Malfoy defensively. “And if you’d known before, you would have laughed at me.”
They’d been back at Hogwarts for a few days when Malfoy burst into the room during their free period, grabbed Harry’s arm, and started pulling him away from his Transfiguration homework.
“Obviously,” Hermione says. “Now what are you going to do about it?”
Harry made a face at him and turned his hair back to its original colour, as someone managed to find a way to turn off Celestina Warbeck and put on the Weird Sisters’ new single.
“I didn’t say that,” Malfoy says.
“I reckon he was scared,” Ron said unexpectedly, shoving his hands in his pockets. “I’ve seen him, Harry, and I don’t believe he doesn’t feel the same way. Come on, all of school he was just trying to get your attention, wasn’t he? All he ever wanted was you. Bit embarrassing, really.”
Harry trailed after him as he tossed T-shirts and trousers in Harry’s arms. “How do you know my size?”
Malfoy hesitated. He looked a bit shifty. “Well, yes.”
“I can’t believe you haven’t been!” Hermione said. “Or that you’re still calling him by his last name.”
Malfoy nearly fell off the arm of Harry’s chair in surprise; Harry grabbed hold of his ankle securely before he did.
“Oh, sorry,” Harry said, looking away from where Malfoy was making a face at him from across the Great Hall. He looked at Ron and Hermione, sitting in front of him, who exchanged meaningful looks.
He looked back at Malfoy. The love bite on Malfoy’s neck was more proof that yesterday hadn’t been a dream, it had been real.
Ginny nudged his shoulder and he leaned in to play with the rest, her long red hair brushing up against his arm.
Completely unexpectedly, McGonagall’s lips twitched again and she laughed.
Franny!” instead of
“No,” Harry said, “it’s, er.” This last word made Malfoy start laughing harder. Harry glared at him and tried not to laugh. “I’ll change it back.”
“Match ended early,” grunts Ginny, sitting up and tucking her long red hair behind her ears.
────────────
“Dying,” repeated Malfoy. “You told me that before – that you died. And came back.”
“He’s with Hermione,” Harry said, making a face.
Harry waited until they’d walked out of the store to ask, “So, that – ”
“He’s not – ” Harry began defensively, and stopped. Malfoy
“What!” Malfoy said, and seemed unable to speak for what Harry assumed was fear of possibly hexing him.
Harry had thought faintly that Malfoy might have been the kind of wizard that used cleaning charms instead of doing things the Muggle way, or what Harry thought personally of as the normal way, but when he came out of the bathroom, a pleasant smell of mint toothpaste and the scent of vanilla followed him, and he was wearing pyjamas. It was absolutely ridiculous to see Malfoy in pyjamas, even though they looked like expensive silk. It was absolutely ridiculous to see Malfoy’s bare, white feet as he set his shoes neatly down by his bed. It was absolutely ridiculous that Harry had to get up and follow him, and that they brushed shoulders as they passed and did not start a fight.
“It’s more interesting when you say it,” Harry said, and watched Malfoy preen with some amusement.
“I’m going to get another drink,” he said, but Malfoy didn’t look like he’d heard over the sound of the music and everyone chatting and laughing noisily, so Harry moved closer, his mouth to Malfoy’s ear and his heart skipping a beat and said it again.
“I thought you wouldn’t ever date Ginny,” Harry said. “Because of her family.”
“Is that why you came over here to sit dramatically on the stands?”
“I’ve heard enough!” Pansy cries. “Potter, you’ve never deserved Draco’s affection and I miss the days where we would plot your humiliation, but since we’re to be a family, I expect you for tea Sunday afternoons. Draco, I require many gifts to compensate for this betrayal.”
“We run into each other sometimes. Shouldn’t you
“Follow me,” said Malfoy threateningly, “or I’ll open Weasley’s bedroom door.”
“If you’re not engaged, why were you trying free wedding cake samples for engaged couples only?”
“How’d you figure that out?” Harry said, thinking of Seamus.
,” sputters Malfoy. “I’m
“Of course it’s recent!” Harry said. “It’s been one week!”
“It makes perfect sense,” Malfoy said, almost to himself as Harry ambled on beside him, only swaying once or twice. He didn’t think they’d walked side by side before very often. The only time he could think of was first year, detention in the Forbidden Forest, where Malfoy, ha, ran away screaming like a girl.
“So we’re – ” Malfoy hesitated. “At Hogwarts, what are we – ”
“Okay, we’ll find it,” Harry assured him. “Er, her.”
? Why are you here, why are you
“Oh,” Malfoy said. “Oh.”
“But no one’s staying,” Harry protested. Everyone was going home to their family, either because they wanted to be home or because their parents wanted them to be home. Hermione, the Ravenclaws, and Justin had been panicking over bringing their revision and books home. Ron said the exams were ages away, to which Hermione had snapped that there were only
“Yes,” Malfoy said, giving him a weirded-out look. “Blaise used the Potion, he told his mother and she went to St. Mungo’s to ask for it. That’s why he was in and out of the Hospital Wing in school.”
“I think you should ask him,” Hermione said, pragmatic. “Ask him the truth and tell him the truth.”
Harry’s not sure how to tell Malfoy not to be embarrassed, and not to worry about making a silent apology to Harry in the form of breakfast. He watches Malfoy burn toast and attempt to scramble eggs with a wince – there’s a reason Harry’s usually the one in the kitchen. Really, apologising to Harry with breakfast is
come into this.”
“Do you want to go in?” he asked.
“Er, shake on it?” Harry said, faltering, not sure what he’d done.
“We wanted to ask if you would come,” Susan said.
Harry stayed. When Ron and Hermione came, he shrugged off their worried suggestions to come back to the Gryffindor common room, and stayed. When Pansy Parkinson came, pale and close to hysterics and clutching at a handful of Slytherins, he didn’t talk to her, and she didn’t talk to him – not even to spare him a sneer – but he stayed. When Madam Pomfrey told him to get some sleep, he took her advice and went to sleep in the hospital wing, so he could stay.
. “We were pretending, you see, to be engaged, for.” Er. “For free wedding cake.” Well, that sounds ridiculous. But less ridiculous than what Dean believes, surely?
“Ron and Hermione are your friends too,” Harry says. “And it's more like every second Tuesday. And I have dinner with Blaise all the time.”
“That’s not,” Harry said, and couldn’t finish.
about this!” Hermione insisted. “At The Three Broomsticks before Christmas!
Malfoy was quiet for so long Harry turned around to check on him, sliding him a plate of pancakes and bacon. He was frowning, looking at the table.
Harry moved forwards through the door and stumbled inside. He heard Malfoy say something about a room, a bed, and moved up the stairs blindly, one hand on the railing and the other holding Malfoy up. He got up the stairs to the first floor and slammed Malfoy up against the wall, let go of Malfoy’s mouth to drag his teeth over Malfoy’s throat and unbutton his soaking jeans. He felt Malfoy find his glasses and put them back on his face, laughing. Malfoy peeled his shirt off, impatient like he always was, tossed it in some corner where it would be a shrivelled-up, wet pile in the morning, and place a kiss under Harry’s ear, on his collarbone, his shoulder, on his mouth. Harry smiled and Malfoy moved away to place two fingers on the two dimples on either side of Harry’s face, and kissed him while Harry was still laughing. Harry reached to take off Malfoy’s shirt, and saw the way Malfoy hesitated. He kissed the scar he had left on Malfoy’s skin, and looked at the Dark Mark and did not flinch.
Malfoy slapped his hand away and said, voice very high, “What are you
,” Malfoy said under his breath, and Mrs. Norris stared at them for another silent moment, before turning around and padding out the door.
?” Ron, who didn’t take kindly to his spot being stolen, complained.
you,” said Malfoy. “I haven’t seen you since I was a child!”
? Harry’s mouth opens, then closes. He chances a glance over at Malfoy, who looks flabbergasted. He manages an, “Er.”
“I can handle it,” Hermione says, and Harry doesn’t doubt that. She hugs him, once, tightly; he can smell her shampoo, the same one Ron uses. It smells like home. “Be happy,” she whispers into his shoulder.
“Draco, tell me it isn’t true!” shrieks Pansy.
“You’ll get em next time, Seamus.”
“You were thinking of getting engaged even back then,” Dean says.
He was practically jumping up and down with excitement when he found Harry finishing up an Owl to Ron and Hermione in the drawing room.
Ron and Hermione were looking at him expectantly. Zabini was looking at Malfoy expectantly.
By the time Pansy, Goyle, Theo, and Millie had started planning to leave, the rest of the Gryffindors had come inside to have a drink or two. Ron and Hermione waved at him, until they saw that he was sitting with a crowd of Slytherins, at which point they began to look concerned for his sanity and physical well-being.
, our most beloved saviour and all that. I just didn’t think it would be appreciated, coming from me.”
“Sixth year is close enough,” Harry says. There is a warm glow in his heart at the thought that Malfoy has liked him since fifth year. “Hermione knows we were faking, by the way.”
chime Ron and Hermione’s voices together.
, Harry thought irritably,
He looked so awkward, shoulders curling in and head down, that Harry nudged their arms together and gestured for him to sit down by Ron and Hermione.
Two hours later, the party was in full-swing and everyone had drunk quite a lot of Firewhiskey amongst a backdrop of Celestina Warbeck and awful opera music, which was what the music seemed stuck on. Ron and Hermione kept making extraordinarily sappy faces at each other; Ginny was flirting outrageously with everyone except for Zabini, who was flirting outrageously with no one except for Ginny; Anthony was performing ‘You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me’ loudly with Justin and Seamus as back-up singers and Luna swaying beside them; and Harry was sitting on the floor watching Malfoy do all his best impressions. He wasn’t sure how he’d ended up here, or when their legs had got all tangled together.
Malfoy was waiting outside of the eighth year common room, arguing with Daphne about something. Harry was struck suddenly with the disconnect from Malfoy at the beginning of this year, shrinking in on himself, too skinny and sallow, and the Malfoy who had now caught sight of Harry and had trailed off in his tangent to Daphne to break into a smile.
When Rafael makes his apologies and leaves with one last flash of a smile like the sun, Harry turns on Malfoy, who is still sulking. “What is your problem?” Harry asks.
Once they were inside, the fire blazing and the common room empty, Malfoy said, words stumbling all out of him like he couldn’t stop himself, “I don’t understand what you want me to do. I’ve been trying this whole time – ”
Dean looked distracted all of a sudden, almost angry. He said, “I don’t know what Seamus
?” Harry said hotly.
“Then it turned out you were sharing a room. And I was prepared, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly. “I was prepared for the stalking, and the constant talking about it – ”
“We get it, mate,” Ron said over dinner, when Ginny was talking to Demelza Robins. “But isn’t this what you wanted? You don’t need to deal with each other. Best case scenario, yeah?”
He’d never known.
” said Malfoy scathingly. “I’m not interested in your opinion, Potter, thanks.”
? It would explain a great deal if you didn’t, actually. Maybe you’ve never
Malfoy complained at length about the curtains in the drawing room and some of the “ghastly” decor. Harry drew the line at going to Diagon Alley to pick up materials, though. They did their best with colour-changing charms and getting rid of some carpets and furniture that even Harry agreed were hideous to look at.
Malfoy sitting next to him in Potions class, Malfoy calling him his best friend, Malfoy saying he dreams about Harry sucking his dick and calling him
“I dunno,” Harry said, not wanting to give anything away. It was Dean’s business.
“You weren’t?” Dean looks startled again. “Well, I’m thinking of – I’m thinking of proposing to Seamus.”
Malfoy, deciding to overcompensate for their emotional conversation, keeps up a steady stream of chatter as they continue towards the register, barely putting up a fight when Harry cajoles him out of the shopping cart. The cashier, young, with a haircut vaguely reminiscent of some of Harry’s students, watches them in an entertained way. Harry even manages to stop Malfoy from showing off his prowess when it comes to Muggle money. They walk out of the store, Harry with an air of triumph around him and Malfoy with a dramatic, sulky expression on his face. Harry can tell he isn’t really upset. This was a good idea. They’re completely back to normal now.
The girl made a face. “That shit’s archaic, mate.” She seemed to notice Harry for the first time and her surprised eyebrows made a return. “Soz, mind my manners. I’m Ester, pronouns she slash her. Are you Draz’s boyfriend?” She punched Malfoy in the arm again and whispered loudly, “You didn’t tell me about him! He’s a bit of an alright, isn’t he?”
“Never tickle a sleeping dragon,” repeated Harry, and then, “Never tickle a sleeping
Malfoy gives him an exasperated look. He says, “There’s only ever been you.”
“You’re still wearing my ring,” Malfoy notices.
“I’ll be honest, I don’t really know anything about him,” Harry says. He vaguely remembers training with the man – he’d been funny, a fairly good friend – and ending up in bed together, but not really any details. “He was nice, I think.”
“Yeah,” says Harry. He had told Narcissa the truth. He had meant every word.
?” The word wrenched out of Malfoy’s mouth like he hadn’t wanted to say it at all.
“Well, that didn’t last long,” Harry noted, thinking of his own family with a pang.
Harry felt a bit uncomfortable, even though he’d been thinking practically the exact same thing yesterday. He just kept thinking of Malfoy’s pointed and bare feet, and his cloud of hair sticking up in the morning.
Harry is still holding Malfoy’s hand. Should he let go? Maybe he should wait for Malfoy to let go. But what if Malfoy is waiting for
. Payback for six years of relentless bullying towards your friends? I don’t understand.”
“Ooookayy,” Ester said, quizzical brows making another appearance. “I’ll ring you up, then.”
With a Herculean effort, he then extracted his other hand away, trying not to jostle Malfoy. He opened the bottle of Hangover Potion and drank half of it, deciding to leave the rest for Malfoy but also having nowhere to put it. His head felt as clear as it would ever be and he felt less groggy, less likely to throw up.
Harry thought about Narcissa leading Sirius to his death and Narcissa leaning over him in the forest, her hair falling over his face. He hoped she wouldn’t mind that he loved her son, because he knew how much she meant to Malfoy.
Harry let go of his arm and took a step back. “Not you too. It’s just a
Harry may have to kidnap Dean Thomas.
“Yeah,” Harry said hoarsely, and didn’t think the likelihood of another Slytherin falling for a Gryffindor was very high.
Harry sighs. He brings Malfoy over to the bathroom, and holds Malfoy’s hair back as he throws up, and makes Malfoy open up his mouth so he can cast a spell to fix his breath. He thinks he should probably be a bit more annoyed at having to do all of this. He thinks it doesn’t really matter.
“Your hair is a mess, Potter,” Malfoy says disdainfully, “whereas mine is – ”
He thought about it fondly later. It was Seamus, and they were both drunk, and high besides, so it didn’t have to be embarrassing or a big deal. He could admit, in the morning, when he woke up, that he’d liked Cho Chang and Ginny, but also Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory. No one had ever told him you could like both, but Ron and Hermione had been really great about it, though Hermione had gone a little overboard with research.
“Oh, Potter,” said Malfoy, sighing.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, embarrassed. “It was just – normal. We didn’t even talk to each other. Who are you rooming with, Hermione?”
he reminds himself, as a Gryffindor asks him gleefully if he’s married to Mr Malfoy.
“Well – shall I make some tea?” says Harry.
“Maybe you’ll answer my question now,” says Remus, because he knows Harry too well.
“Hey,” said Harry, still grinning.
If Malfoy’s jealous, it’s not for the reasons Pansy thinks. Harry shrugs.
In the other one Draco Malfoy was dying: in a bathroom, in fire, in a battle, in a cell, and each time Harry could not save him.
They were walking back from Defence Against the Dark Arts, the day before Valentine’s Day, snow falling outside, on the day Harry figured it out.
“The gramophone,” Harry explained.
“I’m,” Harry said, uncomfortable. “His friend?”
“Ye-es,” Malfoy said. “Hands-on research. I didn’t know anything about Muggles at all before. Seemed like an oversight on my part, you know. If you
As he said it, he remembered that the last time he’d stayed in Grimmauld Place was in the summer, and that it was a horrible idea to invite Malfoy to stay with him, it would make everything worse. But he couldn’t stand the idea of Malfoy on his own for the holidays.
, maybe?”
“What,” Harry says. “Yes, er, we. What.”
Harry walked through the corridors of sprawling, once loved and once hated Grimmauld Place till he’d gotten to the doors to the garden. He threw the doors open and went, as Malfoy had said, out in the pouring rain. The garden had always been the only part of Grimmauld Place that he’d liked, straggling and airy with dead grass and flowers and weeds.
,” Malfoy said sharply.
“How do you know that?”
he thinks.
already go to Weasley and Granger’s every Tuesday,” Malfoy adds in a lofty tone.
trying to avoid that, you know. But I still shouldn’t have.”
so. So far so good.
“I see,” Harry said. “Well, in that case, I’m sorry I was so disappointing. To Daphne.”
“Well, I.” Harry concentrated on looking out the view of the Astronomy Tower. “I think I love him.”
At least he caught the Snitch, his and Malfoy’s fingertips grazing before he pulled up into the air with Ron whooping triumphantly.
“You look
” Ron said.
“I don’t think I ever met Daphne before this year,” Harry mused.
“Of course you were. It remains a comfort to know you’ve been a witness to every single awful moment of my life,” Malfoy said.
,” says Harry loudly, and in that moment, he meets Malfoy’s eyes and he knows what they’re both thinking of – that windswept afternoon, Malfoy’s lips, chapped from cold, on his own, and the sounds that they’d both made, desperate and pleased. Malfoy swallows. Harry can’t look away from him. This isn’t supposed to be happening – they’d put that
Blaise ignores her. “ – doesn’t mean I’m not having sex every night.”
Pansy snorts. “You’re an absolute idiot. Draco’s always had a jealous streak.”
The wind kept blowing Harry’s hair into his face and his hands were numb despite the fact that he was wearing gloves Hermione had knitted because Ron had forced them upon him. But he was talking aimlessly to Malfoy, ducking in and out of shops and coming out with bags full of Acid Pops (because Malfoy actually liked them) and sugar quills and a tenth-anniversary edition of Quidditch Through the Ages that made Malfoy cackle and buy on the spot. So he didn’t mind, at least until Malfoy came to a halt beside the Three Broomsticks.
them.
“So your plan is to, what, avoid him for the rest of the year?” Hermione asked skeptically.
Harry gives her a quick kiss on the cheek, and then goes to offer Ron his congratulations again. Ron gives him a big hug in response. He’s almost as drunk as Malfoy.
“Okay, okay,” Harry said. “Did you search the common room and the bedrooms?”
an unpleasant little bastard.
Ginny moved closer to them and Harry dropped the subject. They had a lively discussion about Quidditch instead, and by the time Harry, Ron, and Hermione had said goodbye to Ginny and Luna and made their way to their common room, Harry was yawning. He wanted to sit on the armchairs by the fire with Ron and Hermione anyway, but Anthony Goldstein was in the library, and Ron immediately whisked Hermione away upstairs. Harry stayed down and reflected grimly that Ron’s room was right next to his, and that he hoped they used Silencing Charms. He half-heartedly joined Neville and Terry Boot’s conversation, and then when they went upstairs, he waited a few more moments and walked up to his room where, no doubt, Malfoy would already be asleep.
“I will always call you Potter,” Malfoy said darkly. “I am not so lost that I’ve forgotten my vow never to call you by your first name.”
Draco Malfoy. I think the world revolves entirely around me. I’ve never won a Quidditch game against my bitter rival, Harry Potter, who is a total twerp and terrible at everything, but everyone
“It’s a Muggle thing,” Harry tells him. “Superstition. If your eyelash falls, you blow on it, and make a wish.” Harry had always made the same wish as a child: to leave the Dursleys, or to have a family, or to have a home. And it had come true, however many years later.
It felt like someone had Stunned him behind his back. He grasped for the door’s handle and held on to it for dear life. “Oh,” he said again.
Harry gave up in order to let Malfoy be lulled into a false sense of security. When they went to bed that night he put his plan in action: he waited until he heard Malfoy’s breathing even out and he tip-toed out of bed towards Malfoy, and tickled his stomach.
“Free wedding cake samples.”
Harry gives him a charming grin – the one that’s a carbon copy of his dad’s, according to Sirius and Remus. To his delight, Malfoy actually blushes. “Does that mean I’m allowed to ruffle your hair?”
“Happy for you, mate,” Ron says, looking faintly ill. “I mean, Malfoy used to be a evil, prejudiced git, but I s’pose he’s grown out of the prejudiced part and he’s not evil anymore. So. He’s just a git, and I can deal with that as long as you’re happy.”
you, you should look at your hair situation before you throw around unfounded accusations, you horrible excuse for a – ”
– he still wouldn’t be able to hate him. It’s infuriating how much power Malfoy has over him.
“I suppose,” Molly says anxiously. She holds their guest list in her hands, and is going over it for the twentieth time. She’s worse than Remus. Malfoy refrained from going to this dinner mostly because of Molly’s endless remarks about their upcoming wedding.
“I’m not faking.” Malfoy’s words come out in a rush. “I’m not pretending. I want this for real. So if you don’t, tell me now.”
Harry said goodbye (Goyle and Theo nodded at him and Millie smiled. Pansy hissed into his ear never to hurt Malfoy and gave him her address), and headed over to Hermione, who was waiting for Ron to come back with their drinks.
“Harry Potter!” Rafael greets loudly. “No, it’s no problem, have a nice day, I’ve just got a meeting here – thank you, I’ll just – ” He manoeuvres his way around the hordes of people attempting to press closer to him, and waves Harry and Malfoy over to another empty table, beaming the whole while.
“Rafael hasn’t done anything to you.”
“Arsehole,” Harry said, laughing. “No, I’m not, I was just – dead for a few moments.”
Malfoy nodded. “Turns out wizards don’t like the idea of another family being that far above them. Anyway, her family’s dead and everyone’s given up on her except one of those knights, Meera Shafiq. She was an extremely distant ancestor of your grandmother probably, and she went looking for the daughter because she’d sworn to protect the family. She managed to find her, and she kept this diary along the way, it was a
When had he even told Ron and Hermione he was dating Malfoy? Had he ever said anything to give them that impression?
“So, possibly a surrogate,” says Malfoy.
“They said I played the Dirty Dancing soundtrack too much!” Malfoy went on hysterically. “They said they were tired of hearing it in the common room!”
Malfoy came back holding an enormous and dusty tome Harry recalled seeing on their bookshelf, and dragged a chair beside Harry to sit in.
“That is
Harry laughed, leaning against the wall and careful not to lean by Walburga’s portrait. “You had dance lessons?”
“Pansy’s company is a delight,” replies Malfoy, even though he has vehemently disagreed on this in the past, “but you have a point.”
“A romantic relationship,” Harry elaborates. “We’re. Together.”
Harry looks up from his desk. He’s been on edge all day, waiting for Malfoy’s arrival, and his second class is still in twenty minutes. “Something the matter, Adriana? You’re a little early for class.” Some of Harry’s students like being early for class – though all they do is sit in the corner and cast giggling looks at him – but Adriana isn’t one of them.
“Yes,” say Harry and Malfoy at the same time.
There’s an odd sort of expression on Malfoy’s face. “Don’t lose it.”

Dean is in the kitchen, closing the fridge. He turns around, sees Harry, and starts.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Malfoy said, very pink.
It wasn’t for Malfoy that he stayed. He had known, that whole year, that Malfoy was planning something. It had never mattered that everyone dismissed him. Harry had hated Malfoy for so long, he could tell when something was wrong with him. It wasn’t for Malfoy’s sake. Only Harry had heard him, and he had sounded so frightened –
“We could, though,” says Harry.
Harry squirms, unsure where this interest in his and Malfoy’s hypothetical children has come from. “Adoption also works, but – ” He glances at Malfoy. “Narcissa really wants a Malfoy heir.”
“Well, would you look at that,” Malfoy said, astonished, amongst a backdrop of whistling and crowing. “I never thought it would really happen.”
Malfoy stared at him for a moment. Harry stared back stubbornly.
He’s pretending to date Malfoy. What’s the point of pretending Harry doesn’t care about him?
Malfoy sighed. “You’re...cruel. I’m. Tired.”
He didn’t want to think about being apart from Malfoy, how this tentative friendship could fall apart and they’d come back unsure of each other.
“Shove over,” he said, and climbed in.
“I should probably get him home,” Harry says, apologetically. He’s not really sorry for it, truth be told. Pub nights with Ron and Hermione are fine, but the party scene isn’t quite his thing.
Malfoy seemed antsy too. Two days before they were set to leave he hit the chandelier with a Quaffle they’d been tossing back and forth in the hallway, one throw each for a question about Transfiguration. Harry spent ten minutes making fun of him.
Before he could drag them away to their room, someone whistled and yelled out, “Finally!”
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Fine. No – ”
“Yes, exactly, cinnamon,” said Malfoy, and then, dreamily, “I watched the best Muggle film in all existence on the fellytone, though.”
“You’re obvious, Potter,” dismisses Malfoy, and then his face lights up.
“Delighted,” Harry deadpans. “This was your idea.”
“Okay,” Malfoy said.
“You and
Actually, apparently Harry’s friends are idiotic enough to believe he’s engaged to Malfoy. And so are Malfoy’s.
“To get your N.E.W.T.S?”
Harry gives Malfoy’s owl a piece of paper asking Hermione if she has time to meet him. A few moments later he receives an answer that says yes, she needs a break from work, and she’ll meet him in a few minutes at the flat. Then there’s nothing left to do but wait.
“You were already traumatised for life, Potter,” Malfoy said cheerfully as he cast a Drying Spell on his hair, which was pretty true.
Harry didn’t know why it mattered to him whether Malfoy went or not, either, but it did. So he got his Invisibility Cloak and went with Seamus and Ron to bring back a couple of cartons of Firewhiskey and bottles of Butterbeer, while Neville and the Hufflepuffs brought back appropriate snacks from the kitchens. Hermione and Dean, elected as the most responsible and likely candidates that McGonagall would listen to, came back and said McGonagall had given them permission; by then Harry was feeling rather attached to this idea and the rush he always got from breaking the rules, so the idea of permission only mattered in that he’d rather never disappoint Professor McGonagall ever. Malfoy and Anthony Goldstein had found a way to connect to the Wizarding Wireless Network on a gramophone that Malfoy caressed terrifyingly before setting down. Neville had stumbled into Ginny and Luna on his way to the kitchens, and came back with them in tow, shrugging helplessly at the look on Ron’s face as if to say
“Fuck off,” Harry said, laughing gratefully and taking it.
, Harry had promised,
Harry’s heart probably stops. “Malfoy,” he manages, “you’re really drunk, you have no idea what you’re saying – ”
They hadn’t talked about this yet. There was a lot to not talk about. They’d talked about the war, even though Harry didn’t usually talk about the war with anyone: Snape and Dumbledore cautiously, treading careful ground. But mostly they talked about things like the Snatchers they’d been most terrified of, Malfoy’s mother curling her hand tightly around his shoulder when Fenrir Greyback came, the cliffs at Shell Cottage and Dobby’s body in a grave, Nagini in Malfoy’s house, the hunger and loneliness, watching the snow fall on Harry’s parents’ graves.
“That Slytherin girl?” Ron asked, and Harry remembered the girl at the Slytherin table yesterday, all golden hair and stately blue eyes, examining her manicure.
, and it was
“See you later, Potter,” Malfoy said crisply, standing up in one smooth motion, inclining his head at Ron and Hermione.

“Are you fucking with me? Are you fucking with
“Luna,” agrees Malfoy decisively.
left.
Well, Harry thought, almost satisfied, that hadn’t lasted long.
He went to sit at the top of the empty Astronomy Tower after Malfoy had gone, because the alternatives were staying outside staring pathetically at the castle or going back to the rest of the eighth years, and he didn’t think being around people was a good idea, right now.

“This is a
Malfoy looked surprised. “You’re welcome.”
“Er,” said Harry, staring. “Hello?”
“You have a partner,” Harry said, gesturing grandly down at himself.
Harry has been subsiding from any more drinks, wanting to keep an eye on Malfoy, who is still singing terribly. He’s pleasantly buzzed right now, but not drunk. Someone needs to take care of the wanker.
“Stop trying to smirk.”
. The next door said, in that same golden, curling script:
“She gave us some pamphlets,” said Hermione. “I think I still have some of them, I don’t know if they’d be useful, though.”
Ron and Hermione, of course, had followed Harry, like they always had, though he could see in their eyes that they were simply dying to confront him about this.
“Ah,” Harry says weakly. Malfoy. Has dreams about Harry sucking his dick? After a moment, because it’s true, and Malfoy isn’t going to remember this in the morning, Harry says, “I’ve had dreams about sucking your dick.”
he get so drunk?”
“Er,” Harry said, and was fortunate that at this moment the door opened to reveal Ron, Hermione, and Blaise Zabini, all arguing fiercely with each other. They stopped once they caught sight of Malfoy and Harry, both sitting on their separate beds, heads tilted towards each other like plants towards the sun.
Rafael clears his throat. “I suppose there isn’t any chance of me convincing you to come back to playing professional Quidditch, Harry?”
────────────
“I know what you meant down there,” Malfoy said finally. “All this – all of last year – and it’s not that important, anymore, is it. I don’t know how to go back to what we were like before. You saved my life.”
” He started laughing.
She turned to Malfoy, who sat, twitching like a rabbit, ready to make his escape at any moment, and murmured a spell for the bump on his head. She handed them both a potion that tasted like gurdyroots, and Harry tried not to laugh at the expression on Malfoy’s face.
“No!” Malfoy said. “Of course not! Everyone knows that!”
Malfoy’s eyes narrow. “If you do that, I’m coming tomorrow to embarrass you in front of a class of gossiping children.”
“Hermione said you were looking for me?” Harry says.
“I’ve already won,” Harry said, and meant it.
“The birds are making a racket,” Malfoy said.
February turned to March, the cold weather thawing enough that nine of them headed down to the pitch to play a makeshift, modified game of Quidditch with only two Chasers and one Beater. Harry and Malfoy claimed respective Seekers immediately, and Harry snagged Ron as Keeper, Dean and Seamus as Chasers, and Lisa Turpin as a Beater. Malfoy’s team consisted of Anthony as Keeper, Padma and Terry as Chasers, and Susan as his Beater.

“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Malfoy said, looking up at him wildly, “you’re not – don’t you know what day it’s going to be?”
is right here,” Malfoy said pointedly. “Shove over, Pans.” Malfoy slid in next to Pansy, smiling at her affectionately, and Harry followed him uncertainly.
“I can’t believe you both!” Harry said, and was startled into laughing, until all three of them were laughing and clutching at each other’s shoulders, voices echoing in the empty tower.
“Had to,” Malfoy echoed. “No you didn’t. You could have stayed gone. Most people would have, if they’d been you. I would have, but I was. I was never like you. You did – you did the right thing, I suppose, like you always do.”
All in all, Harry is absurdly relieved when they make their excuses and leave. Malfoy looks traumatised for life as they step through the door.
“Things that are true?” Harry doesn’t want to move. He wants to rest his forehead against Malfoy’s, and feel him, close enough to kiss. He
“Not that again,” Harry said.
Hermione, with a pitying glance at Ron, changes the subject to the bastards at work who are ignoring her petitions for house-elf rights. Malfoy leans forward and starts arguing with her animatedly. Harry watches him fondly, and doesn’t make himself look away – because he doesn’t need to, at least for now. He’s helping the illusion that he and Malfoy are in love.
────────────────────
“Thanks,” Malfoy said, and licked his lips, and really, who could blame Harry for bringing him in by his arm and kissing him? If anyone blamed Harry they had to blame Malfoy for kissing him back and pressing him against the door of the classroom, while the music was playing in the background:
Malfoy began, pale, “How do you know – ”
“She thinks we just need some time alone and we’ll get back together!” Ginny raged once Molly had left the kitchen. “And we don’t even need to clean the dishes, we can use magic, it’ll take five minutes.” She waved her wand and the soap and water began to move of their own accord, scrubbing the dishes while Ginny watched on darkly.
you going to do all alone here anyway?” Malfoy asked over breakfast on Easter Sunday. “Just brood? Walk around the rooms and sulk?”
“Snookums,” he greets. “You’re a dear. Are those roses?” Harry bats his eyelashes, placing his hands under his chin. “For
Malfoy would have probably called this brooding. Malfoy also clearly didn’t care what he did, so.
“That’s a matter of time,” Pansy informs him. “I know Draco. I’ve been watching him moon over you embarrassingly for years. If you hurt him, I’ll kill you.” She sounds perfectly serious, and Harry inches away from her in fear.
“It was a bit silly,” she went on, “but I almost felt in that moment that James and Sirius were here together again.”
Malfoy ignored this in favour of handing him a pair of jeans and a pullover.
“Thanks,” mumbles Harry, feeling even worse about lying. “Y’know, everyone else already thought we’d been. Together. The whole time.”
“I’m here,” Harry said, even though he knew what she meant.
“And what about when you came down to breakfast in Slytherin robes, and when we told you, you said your robes must have gotten mixed up with Malfoy’s?” Hermione pointed out.
Ron reached into his pocket and handed Harry the Marauder’s Map, clapping him on the shoulder. “Use your old stalking skills from sixth year.”
“Harry, you’re grinning like a loon again,” Ron said at breakfast.
“And I’ve got something for you,” Harry told him, handing him a present in green wrapping paper. It was a book about Curse-Breaking that Malfoy had been talking about all month; he’d gotten it from Tomes and Scrolls when he, Ron, and Hermione had gone to Hogsmeade, and Daphne had wrapped the book for him in exchange for the chance to threaten him about hurting Malfoy.
“What?” Harry said, mystified.
“Oh, not this again,” Daphne complained. “Get a life, Blaise, before you started mooning over Ginny you were interesting.”
Malfoy laughed. “Your love life is a
Now he had seen their graves for the first time, seen the home they had picked out, seen the life they could have had.
Which made Harry want to lean over and kiss him, or just
“You can’t say things like that!” Malfoy raged, and Harry turned around to see him looking at Harry like he was a nightmare or dream come to life.
“Why?” Malfoy asked, quiet.
“Here,” Harry says. “You can, er, you can call me Harry. You know. Er.”
Malfoy’s gramophone”, but they went on searching through every place Malfoy thought she was likely to be. Harry did try suggesting asking Blaise and Daphne, but even he knew they would just laugh. Everyone, even Hermione, who was quite impressed that the music worked at Hogwarts and shocked that Malfoy had watched a Muggle film at all, was getting pretty tired of hearing ‘(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life’ for the seventeenth hundred time. Except for Harry, that is.
By the time Easter holidays came around, most of the eighth years were frantically planning out their revision for exams. Ron admitted to Harry in-between Hermione tossing revision timetables at him that he wasn’t worried about exams. They’d both gotten that letter from the Aurors, after all, like most of the D.A, but Ron seemed to be under the impression that they were both going to go directly into Auror training after school. Harry didn’t want to think about it.
He could not quite bring himself to say “
“Is he all right?” Hermione asks, smothering a laugh behind her hand. She’s smiling, her gaze on Ron, who’s talking about his new position to Seamus. Has Harry remembered to tell her she looks pretty tonight? He’s fairly sure.
“I did mean it,” Harry said, wretched. “I’ve never felt this way before. And I swear, it’s the truth. And I owe it all to you. And. I’m singing the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, aren’t I.”
When he and Dean arrived back in the common room, it seemed like Zabini had won the battle, because Celestina Warbeck was blaring loudly and Blaise was singing all the words with his wand as a microphone to serenade an amused-looking Ginny while Seamus booed loudly. Neville was making out with Lisa Turpin and Ron, horrifyingly, was dancing shirtless while Hermione tried to cajole him into putting his shirt back on. She did not seem to be trying very hard.
Harry makes coffee. He tries to tame his hair, then thinks maybe Malfoy would like it better if he didn’t, so he gives up. He realises he’s not wearing a shirt and Hermione hadn’t mentioned because there had been an emergency, or because she was used to it. He puts on a shirt Malfoy bought him, one that’s green like his eyes or like Slytherin house colours. He is looking through the List and wondering if Malfoy wanted to put
Blaise sighed. “I
“Let’s not get hung up on specifics,” Hermione said quickly. “I expected you to restart the whole situation, start proclaiming Draco was evil and all that. For old times’ sake!”
“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy sputtered, “just – have you
“What happened to your hatred, Potter,” Malfoy said mournfully. “Where has it gone? What has happened to your violent urges to punch me repeatedly until I’m bleeding?”
Harry chanced half a glance at Malfoy. He was even paler than usual, sickly-looking and withdrawn. He was not looking at Harry. Both of them moved over to their door, but neither of them opened it.
“Yeah.”
“You idiot,” Malfoy said, gently. “It is what it is. You almost killed me and then you saved my life. It’s alright.”
“Brain-damaged,” Malfoy said eventually in a sing-song voice, and kept up a steady stream of chatter as he steered them towards the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey was closing up her office when Malfoy triumphantly dragged them in front of her.
kiss Malfoy, at any moment. He wants to take it slow, and he wants to give everything to Malfoy. He wants to make Malfoy lose control.
family too, but Harry doesn’t want to think like that. He doesn’t know what he would have done if he’d had to go to the Dursleys’ after third year instead of Sirius.
“She wouldn’t say anything,” Harry says. “Not until everything is over, anyway. You’ll have to come for dinner with Sirius and Remus, then.”
“Yes,” said Harry with a bit of an edge to his voice, wary.
“It’s not like that,” Dean said, and then exchanged a rueful glance with Harry. “I mean – well, sorry, anyway. I think I’m drunk.” He sank down on the nearest bed. Harry hoped Neville and Justin never learned of the events that occurred in this room.
So their first few days staying in Grimmauld Place were spent cleaning it up, like the summer before Harry’s fifth year, except this time there weren’t any dark objects putting up a fight, the house and Kreacher seemed to actively be helping them, and Harry was having a much better time. Even Walburga kept the shouting to a minimum, and seemed to be taking some time to rest. Malfoy had charmed his gramophone to fit in his school trunk, and he tinkered with it for hours until Patrick Swayze was singing while they worked.
“Oh. I think McGonagall.” He didn’t know how to say this. “You know, figured it out. What we were doing.”
“In case you haven’t noticed,” Malfoy said, “this

eyes,” Malfoy said, and did not finish, and leaned in to kiss him instead.
“Malfoy.” Harry sighs loudly. “Almost forgot.” He sighs again.
“She talks about you all the time,” adds Harry.
Malfoy lifts his chin up. “Obviously.”
Harry notices Rafael Hernandez immediately; he’s kind of hard not to spot, being surrounded by a million fawning fans and all. He’s certainly very attractive, all dark, soulful eyes and muscular arms and curly hair. He’s also not really Harry’s type.
“So,” Harry said in an undertone. “Blaise Zabini?”
“You’ll forgive me if I don’t take you at your word,” Malfoy said sarcastically, but he let go of Harry’s shoulder, which felt, oddly, like another loss even though it was what Harry had wanted.
“No.” Harry glared at him. “What do you think I am? Why would I do that?”
“Says what?”
“Well,” Harry said. “You saved mine, so.”
“Or –
“I don’t like him,” Harry says, but what he doesn’t say is that thinking Harry likes someone isn’t a good excuse for Malfoy being moody. Possibly there’s something else going on here. “And that isn’t really my type.” The sporty part maybe. Good-looking is a
“Nothing,” Malfoy says. “You should have let me stay home. If you really like him we can stop doing this.”
they friends? Malfoy certainly wouldn’t say so, though they’d agreed to be, of a sort. Frenemies? Roommates? Living together meant they spent most of their time together unless one of them was working actively to avoid the other, and Malfoy wasn’t doing that anymore. “Don’t tell Malfoy that,” he added hastily. “He’ll make fun of me.”
“Ground rules?” Harry says in an amused voice, leaning back on his bed and getting comfortable.
Ginny laughed, wild and free, and went to sit in Neville’s lap where he was perched on an armchair, probably just so she could see how red Ron’s face would get. Luna balanced herself precariously on the arm of the chair and crossed her legs at the ankles. Harry thought he could see what it must have been like, the three of them during that year at Hogwarts he, Ron, and Hermione had missed. No wonder he and Ginny couldn’t understand each other after a year apart at war.
Malfoy stops abruptly in front of the painted-red door. He looks like he’s going to be sick.

“Please don’t confiscate Franny,” Malfoy burst out pleadingly.
It isn’t the same thing, of course.
got them both pardoned. Said, let’s go to France, Italy, Greece, anywhere. He wouldn’t. He said he had to atone, that he didn’t want to run away anymore. When he gets his mind and heart both set on something, you see, he doesn’t give up. Well, he’d been a mess the past year.”
Harry was beginning to despair. He couldn’t see McGonagall letting him and Ron share a room when all the other pairings so far had been two people from different houses, the idea of Ron sharing a room with Malfoy was disastrous, and the idea of him sharing a room with Malfoy was even worse. It was unfathomable. He stuck close to Ron, and they kept walking. The second-to last door said – Harry squeezed his eyes tightly shut and opened them –
Malfoy comes closer. He smells like his new face wash and…
“You sound like Hagrid,” Harry tells Malfoy.
get to be upset, or none of us do, really. Get over yourself.”
Malfoy also had to move Harry’s elbow out of his oatmeal and stop him from putting salt in his pumpkin juice several times, except he didn’t stop Harry from putting salt in his pumpkin juice. He let him do it and then laughed for a solid ten minutes, before switching Harry’s pumpkin juice out with his own.
“You could make it yourself, you know,” Harry replies irritably, plopping down next to Malfoy. “You’re the one who makes coffee for a living, not me.”
“Zabini and some of the others came and asked if we wanted to have a bit of a get-together with everyone,” Harry said.
“Hi,” Harry says, smiling, taking a seat in front of Rafael.
“It isn’t
Harry had known he was bisexual since fourth year, when Sirius and Remus had latched onto his descriptions of Cedric Diggory with a suspicious gleam in their eyes, and literally started crying about his Big Bi Crushes, as they dubbed it. He had no doubt the Dursleys would have been horrified, but he’d stopped caring about their opinion a long time ago, and hadn’t talked to them since he was thirteen years old. In the wizarding world, it was mostly seen as perfectly acceptable, except in some pureblood circles. He had told Hermione and Ron in fifth year, and they hadn’t batted an eye. But Cedric Diggory was one thing. Malfoy was an entirely different thing.
“I meant we could still talk, and stuff.”
Hermione laughed and Harry felt warm inside. He went with them to the common room and burrowed Lisa’s owl. At the threshold to his and Malfoy’s room, he rested a hand against the door affectionately before opening his trunk and digging in to find the letter from the Aurors. He thought of Malfoy in the rain, Ron and Hermione next to him, McGonagall’s suggestion. Snape’s words,
“Not smiley?” Harry examines the back of a pint of strawberry ice cream and thinks that he’s pretty sporty himself. And he’s not too shabby-looking either.
Against all odds, McGonagall’s inter-house unity scheme, putting four different houses together like they were one, seemed to be mostly working. Harry liked almost everyone he lived with, and he found himself playing chess with Ron and the Ravenclaws, going down to Hogsmeade with the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs to meet up with Ernie MacMillan and Hannah Abbott, helping Dean and Seamus smuggle in chocolate and Firewhiskey. McGonagall and the other teachers were so far turning a blind eye to their exploits, though Hermione still felt duty-bound to fret over it.
?” Malfoy says.
“I don’t want you to do anything you don’t want to, that’s all.” Malfoy didn’t want to kiss him back then, and Harry hasn’t deluded himself into thinking he does now.
“Because they were Draco’s best friends,” Pansy explains. “Did you really only learn Blaise’s name in sixth year?”
at the very start of this year. I told you about the pamphlets!”
not,” says Malfoy. “I’m not exactly looking forward to hearing her talk about how badly she wants grandchildren, are you? Knowing my mother, she’ll think it’s a given that I’ll marry you, and use a surrogate to carry on the Malfoy name. She’s probably already got someone picked out.”
Blaise not to go overboard.
Harry got the Snitch, anyway, which he would have bragged about years later if not for – well. He flew down, laid down onto the grass, studied the sky and laughed, flushed with victory and triumph. But Malfoy, who was a sore loser, argued that Harry was cheating. He also said Harry was mad for seeing that particular cloud as a crown, when it was so clearly a snake. And they were still arguing, like they were friends, and Harry was still laughing, and it seemed so natural to lean over and kiss him.
Harry leans his head back. “Practically being the operative word there.”
────────────────────
He did not have a nightmare.
“I’m not a floozy,” Harry says, offended. “I don’t remember a lot about that time.” Because it was after the war, he doesn’t say.
“That’s not what happened,” Harry said. “I – ” He didn’t know how to explain, to Zabini or to Ron and Hermione. He wanted to say that Malfoy was a soft touch as soon as he thought you liked him, that he had made Harry laugh, that he never stopped talking, that he was not afraid to touch Harry easily, affectionately.
Malfoy came out of the shower in five minutes, anyway.
Malfoy looks cross and a bit embarrassed. “It’s not what you think, Pansy.”
Harry looked at him because he wouldn’t see. “Asked you what?”
him, God, and this had been a horrible idea.
, Harry thought.
Malfoy’s eyes lit up. He said, “Let me get my book.”
“Oh, honestly,” Malfoy sighed. “There’s no need to feel guilty over that, you’re hurt, you’ve got a perfectly good reason to be wandering about, idiot.”
, honestly. Did you even brush your teeth or use a dental spell, Potter? You didn’t even
“You’re
“You are a man possessed,” Ron said gravely. “We lived through sixth year, Harry, and you know, we’re doing our best to understand – ”
. It mostly just felt like everything had felt, lately, like nothing. The Sorting went by like it always had, and so did the feast. But when Hagrid waved over to him, and gave him a crushing hug, he felt like he was back home. That meant something, at least.
One of Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up and the other followed in quick succession. “Interesting.”
Harry grabs the collar of Malfoy’s coat and pulls him closer. His nose brushes against Malfoy’s. He can smell Malfoy’s expensive perfume. “If I kiss you now,” he says, “are you going to run away?”
It was also hard to concentrate when Malfoy was singing in the shower, by which Harry meant it should have been hard to concentrate but wasn’t. He just wished Malfoy was out of the shower to insult his essay and thereby help him realise what he’d done wrong.
“Er, I think you mean cinema,” Harry said, smiling and trying not to think about exactly how well Arthur Weasley would get on with Draco Malfoy.
“And you slept with him,” Malfoy says. “Ringing any bells?”
“I didn’t know why you were pretending,” Hermione admits.
, and plants a kiss in his hair. (Malfoy’s hair smells nice.) Then Harry kicks him, too.
“It’s not harebrained and ridiculous and who even says the word harebrained,” Harry said, and extended out his hand.
“Er,” said Harry yet again. “Hey, Ron. Is something wrong?”
He gets his coat. He gives Malfoy a Galleon so he can buy an Acid Pop. He watches Malfoy lick his Acid Pop, and then regrets watching Malfoy lick his Acid Pop.
“What,” Harry said. “I didn’t have a crush on
He helped set the telly up. Malfoy was more of a hindrance than a help, and he had gone to ask Kreacher for snacks, and came back with enough cakes and biscuits to feed an army.
Harry isn’t sure if the particular marshmallows Malfoy is eyeing so hungrily are halal, or even if his father had only eaten halal food – it’s something to ask Sirius and Remus later, so for now he gives into Malfoy, like he always does. Even though marshmallows are
The first door said
“I don’t – I’ve got class,” Malfoy said, and looked at him for a long time, pale and with his hand outstretched again – before he turned around and walked back into the castle, leaving Harry standing there, impossibly alone in the sunny afternoon.
Harry had rolled his eyes, fighting the urge to smile. If Malfoy was asking, it meant he liked Harry’s breakfasts. And Harry sure as hell preferred making breakfast for Malfoy over making breakfast for the Dursleys.
“Are you
“I won’t,” says Harry. He squeezes Malfoy’s hand instinctively. It’s – it’s nice. “Ready?”
“How come I’ve just heard from Dean Thomas that you're engaged to this git?” Hermione says dangerously. Malfoy doesn’t protest to being called a git – after all of the shit he put Hermione through, he doesn’t have the right, but also because he still remembers being slapped in the face in third year – though his nose sticks up in the air like it always does when he’s offended.
In quick succession, Harry’s brain went
“Stop acting all – ” Harry waved a hand around vaguely. “Weird.”
Malfoy points an affronted finger at his chest. “Take that back,” he says blearily.
“When’s that going to be?”
“Well, don’t,” Harry said, like he had before, this time without any excuses of brain damage.
Sirius had told him once.
“I’m fine,” said Harry, exasperated. “I’ll see you at breakfast.”
Harry turned his hair blonde with a Cosmetic Charm of the like that he, Ron, and Hermione had used in the war, and tried to affect a drawl. “
here, I’ll be right back.” And he dashed inside while Harry watched on, bemused.
“I cannot believe you,” Harry announced in general.
“What a shame,” said Zabini, producing a clear bottle of liquid out of thin air. “Since if you came to talk with me, I could give you this Hangover Potion.”
“Don’t listen to him, he might have a concussion,” Malfoy advised her. He had turned a little paler, and shrunk down on himself, as though just waiting for Madam Pomfrey to furiously rain down on him and demand to know what had happened.
His old home, in a state of disrepair even after the long months spent repairing the castle, was not going to be the same again. There were still holes from hexes and empty spaces at every house table. Then there were all the crowds of people trying to get a good look at him as he stepped out of his carriage, which shouldn’t have been something new, but the reverence and the way they spoke his
“To go with my motorcycle,” Harry explains, deciding to follow the advice of the Ginny in his head and go with the flow. “Or, Sirius’s motorcycle, technically, but he gave it to me.”
“Would you use a surrogate?” asks Hermione.
Hermione smiled at him when he sat down, but her gaze was on the Slytherins. She said, “I am trying to understand, you know.”
“Bring out a loaf of that bread Mum likes, will you, Cam?” Dean requests, and once Camille has left, there’s nothing stopping his interrogation of Harry and Malfoy, who stand up, ready to make their escape at any moment.
about this, Potter, honestly.”
────────────
“Shut
Malfoy is watching him anxiously. “Er,” Harry starts. “I guess we should have some breakfast.”
“I rather thought so,” Malfoy said dryly.
Camille looks between them with some surprise. “Do you know each other? Oh, of course, from school, I’m being silly. Aren’t they a lovely couple, Dean?”
“What,” says Harry, staring at him, and then, of course, Malfoy struts inside his classroom, a satisfied smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. And is he – he’s holding a giant bouquet of roses. Of course he is. “Fuck,” Harry mutters under his breath, and fights the urge to hide under his desk.
Malfoy’s gaze flickered down to Harry’s hand and Harry let go quickly, unsettled down in his bones for a reason he couldn’t put into words.
“Sorry,” he said. “That was probably too much.”
shocked,” Malfoy says, but his voice is subdued. When he turns around and sees Harry, he turns pink.
Malfoy exhaled a long, shaky breath. “Yeah, alright. We’ll wait.”
is it a mess?” Harry said, starting to get annoyed.
in curling, bright gold letters. Harry registered Seamus’s disappointment and his own relief, said good night to Dean, and went on. Neville and Justin Finch-Fletchley, Seamus and Terry Boot. Then there was only Harry, Ron, Anthony Goldstein, and Malfoy left.
“That was because I told him I used to have a crush on you,” Dean says. “I was dating Ginny then, and he couldn’t glare at her, so he glared at you. Finding out you’re bi would have been a dream come true for me back then.” He pauses, then adds, “Not anymore, though. No offence.”
He thought, distractedly, as the train sped up and the eight of them murmured to each other and started playing Exploding Snap, that his glimpse of Malfoy on the train platform hadn’t been the first time he’d seen Malfoy after the war at all. That had been the trial, where Harry had testified for both him and Narcissa and Malfoy, and against Lucius. Somehow Harry couldn’t count that, really, because Malfoy had not looked like himself at all and he had not looked at Harry once. Harry hadn’t thought about Malfoy since then at all. He had testified because he’d thought it was the right thing to do, what he was supposed to do, or what the person he wanted to be was supposed to do, and he had just wanted to be finished with all of it.
“Oh,” said Harry. He hadn’t known that. “I’ll do it, then.” He dug in the pocket of his robes for his wand, but he had only just pointed it at his face when Malfoy hissed and pulled his hand back down. Harry stared at their hands, intertwined. Malfoy let go quickly.
Malfoy this was an awful idea. They could have set their friends and family all straight, and revealed that they were never going to date, ever,
Malfoy thinks he’s attractive. Malfoy wants to suck his dick. Malfoy has wanted to kiss him since fifth year. Malfoy has dreams about him. Malfoy, Harry reminds himself, is drunk and has no idea what he’s talking about.
“Oh,” Harry said.
expected from both of them?
“Oh yeah,” Harry says. Vaguely. Had he really told Malfoy about that? “But what does that – oh come
Ron looked far from convinced. His eyes flitted from Harry to Malfoy and he stood up straighter, opened his mouth like he was about to say something, so Harry pushed him inside his room and said, “Good night.”
“What?” Harry said.
“May 2nd,” McGonagall repeated softly. “I thought you might like to speak at the feast that day, after we have our moment of silence.”
won’t they look at
He gave up on sleeping and started writing a reply to Malfoy’s letter, the one that had arrived in the morning detailing all of Malfoy’s Christmas holiday exploits, which mostly consisted of:
“Nott,” replies Pansy. “You really did only pay attention to Draco.”
He was thinking about it during the Christmas party Blaise and Parvati and Seamus had insisted on throwing the day before everyone was set to leave, bright Christmas lights hung on the walls. He was thinking about Malfoy’s face split in an honest smile, how he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to sleep without Malfoy in the same room as him, now.
Malfoy says something about the coffee. Remus says something about the weather. Sirius says something about how if Malfoy hurts Harry, he’ll break Malfoy’s face in ten different ways. Remus says something about how that sentiment is shared.
“Right,” Malfoy says, turning away. He seems...disappointed?
Malfoy gave him a scornful look. Then he looked away quickly. He said, “You’ve never cared about getting in trouble, and no one
“Your motorcycle?” repeats Malfoy faintly. “Is this – about last night, I’m sorry about that – ”
Though weddings have proven to be more complicated than Harry originally thought. There are all sorts of pureblood customs, and wizarding traditions, and bonding ceremonies. One thing he didn’t have to worry about was his best men – Ron and Hermione were both up to the task (Hermione refused to prescribe to gender roles), and Ginny, Luna, and Neville were delighted to be his groomsmen (Ginny and Luna also refused to prescribe to gender roles). Malfoy hadn’t needed to worry, either. Pansy, Blaise and Goyle didn’t even wait for him to ask.
“Did you also absorb information about my parents’ Quidditch preferences by osmosis, then?”
They had to fix the chandelier after that, broken glass dusting the floor and the Dirty Dancing soundtrack drifting up from Malfoy’s gramophone.
“You too,” Harry says awkwardly.
“Yeah, and I’ll be myself.”
“No, it’s – ” Ginny sighed. “I think that would make it worse. Maybe I’ll bring Zabini over here, that would make her stop.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry said, unruffled and unprepared for the way Malfoy stared at him before turning away and muttering something under his breath.
“You had an eyelash there,” Malfoy says quietly.
“That’s because you’re a tosser,” Malfoy told him primly, and poked Harry with his foot.
McGonagall’s lips pursed. “Franny?”
Harry frowns. “Wait, why am
“Not engaged, huh?” says Neville, with a raised eyebrow.
“No,” Malfoy says. “Have you?”
“I can’t,” Malfoy said tightly. “Terms of my probation. I’m only allowed magic for classes for six months.”
never talked about it!” Harry argues. “You ran away, and didn’t talk about it! You didn’t like me!”
When Malfoy told the knight the password and they went inside, Harry looked back curiously and said, off-hand, “Who were they, anyway? Were they real people?”
Malfoy is simmering next to him, either with anger or annoyance. “I’m afraid not,” Harry says, offering Rafael another smile, this one a touch apologetic for Malfoy’s attitude. “I’m pretty attached to where I am right now.”
Malfoy stares at him a bit, then shakes his head, and continues, “We can’t tell anyone about this until after we stop pretending.”
Then Kreacher showed up with a crack and immediately burst into tears at the sight of Malfoy and said, “Master Draco is returning to his rightful home!”
The party fizzled out eventually, until everyone was climbing up the stairs to their dormitories, Ginny and Luna sharing with the girls so they wouldn’t be caught sneaking out to their own. Terry and Justin led the way to the boys’ dormitory with a serious and increasingly nonsensical discussion on conspiracy theories about Lady Di’s death. They’d lost much of their number: Neville had disappeared in his room with Lisa Turpin a while ago, Ron and Hermione had gone to Hermione’s room, and Anthony Goldstein had thrown up and fallen asleep on one of the couches downstairs. Susan had Vanished the mess but no one wanted to wake him up.
