How he would love to go back in time.  If he had the chance to do it all over, he would change almost everything.  Day after day he pictured himself at 11 years old, standing in Madame Malkin’s Robe Shop, Harry Potter on the stool next to him.  He had been wearing a sweater several sizes too big for him, and jeans with a tear at the knee, looking like someone his mother would call a ruffian.
She smiled, serenely.  “The Dark Lord always repays loyalty.” She handed Harry’s cloak over to him.  “This is an old magical artifact, handed down from generation to generation, it belongs with an old wizarding family; it belongs with you.”
“And when you are fully recovered,” Lucius would add. “The world is yours.  The Dark Lord has been most generous to us, his old loyal companions, you can have your pick of positions.”
And then it began again, with a sickening familiarity.  There was nothing Draco could do.  He could not shield his eyes, he could not cover his ears, the best he could manage was averting his gaze, staring at the corner of the room rather than at Harry.  But this only felt worse – somehow more disrespectful, as if he were denying him support, denying him pity.
In his dreams now he would wake, and turn around to embrace Harry, but instead of finding him as he was, he found him as a mangled body, ripped, shrunken organs and face that was no face at all.  It was terrifying. Both the idea of having lost him again, and the thought (the fear) that he would have to see his corpse one more time.
The noises from the Death Eater grew less enthusiastic.  It was clear that there was no life in Harry anymore, and although Draco did not want to look, he imagined that whatever they had left of his body was no more than the bits he himself had buried the time before.
The truth was simpler, and more complex.  Draco had lost his appetite.  No matter what delicious morsels his mother had Diri prepare, nothing tempted him.  And what he did eat he would usually end up vomiting a few hours later.  His stomach was in revolt, and in consequence he grew weak and thin, deep shadows under his eyes.
She was about to make the kill, and Draco knew it.  He turned to look at them again.  “So, is it so wrong for Draco to go in search of it?”
They walked into the forest and Draco could feel his heart pounding.  Tonight.  He would have Harry tonight. Everything was ready for it.  His thoughts were so fixated on him that he didn’t even consider how much of this Narcissa guessed at.  She had come here as he had expected, without questions and without judgment. She was solidarity itself, and she loved him.  But of course, there were things Narcissa would not stand for.
He got up and stretched, his eyes inadvertently falling on the lump of soil where Harry was buried.  How lovely it would be, he thought, to lie down on top of it, while the moon shined on them.  It was a mad thought, and he would surely not act on it, but it also didn’t scare him.  At another time being that unhinged, that well – Black – would have been upsetting, he was after all his father’s son, but now it only seemed natural, as if this was the trajectory he was always set on.
And Harry would always answer with total candor, as if lying was beyond him. “No, but I was scared of you.”
“Is there really nothing you can do?” he asked Narcissa one night while Harry slept.  He had brought her to the library, showing her all the books that he had been sifting through, desperate for information.
Ever since he had remembered Narcissa’s tales, he had wanted this to happen. At first it had been a half-formed thought, but everyday it got clearer, it got stronger.  And since he had begun his travels this goal had filled with urgency.  But now he realized this was not going to be as swift or easy as he had anticipated.
Sweating in his bed, he relieved year after year, altercation after altercation.  They had so much history together, and there had been so many opportunities for one of them to turn the tide. What would have happened if, instead of running away during their detention together in the Forbidden Forest, Draco had stayed with him? Would the fear have bonded them, as fear has a way of doing? What if Draco had approached him in second year and asked him how he became a parselmouth like he had wanted to?  Would that have led to an argument, or to an actual honest conversation between them?
The cold was numbing him.  Involuntarily, he was shivering and jittering, his extremities heavy and slow.  This was the last moment that he could change his mind, and he let it pass over him, without a single wisp of a doubt.  When he opened his eyes, he extended his left hand over the grave, palm up.  He wished it would hold steady, but it was shaking badly, from both cold and fear.  He gripped the knife forcefully in his right hand, took a deep breath and then, in one fell swoop, slashed at the flesh from elbow to wrist, right over his Dark Mark.
In August, to his parent’s relief, his health took a turn for the better.  His diet was limited mostly to fruits and vegetables, occasionally some bread, or light soup, and all in moderate amounts.  But it was the start of something and they all sensed it.  Suddenly, he didn’t want to lie in bed all day.  He would get up with the sunrise and walk the gardens that his father was trying to restore to their former grandeur.  He was too weak to go far, but the fresh air invigorated him.
In tone this was a question, but in reality, she said it to extract a promise from him.  An exchange.  She would get him the mandrakes, and he would return home to her.  That was the way purebloods did things. To attain something, you had to give something up.  “I’ll come home,” he promised.
What was he to do but look into those cursed eyes? Into the blood red pupils?  Into the skull like face?  At first, Lucius sensed nothing, and then, it was as if his whole mind was being stormed.  Doors burst open.  And everything he had ever hidden laid out bare.
It looked like it was crafted from the same rough sea stones that surrounded him.  No marble. No onyx.  It had no jewels and no markings, nothing at all grand or distinct.  As he stood in front of it he held his hand back - afraid to touch.
There was something healing about them being together.  As if kisses in the dark could cure everything rotten that had happened to both of them.  As if talking about his doodles would erase all the ways in which they had both failed.  Their intimacy was not based on sex or physicality, instead it was a complete understanding, and a complete trust.
He buried him with magic, and in haste.  It was possible, no, probable that he missed parts.  He knew he had four limbs, and his torso, but there were bound to be digits missing, and internals too.  The fear of getting caught had stopped him from being thorough.  He had dumped him into the earth with no ceremony, no markings, nothing but an old banner over his body.  He had not even taken the time to piece together the bits he had collected.  He dumped them into the earth and sealed it up, covering it as best he could so that others would not come to disturb him.
He came with a lurch, raising himself up enough so that his cum spilled easily from his cock and his hand into the concoction below.  He hung his head.  But just like he felt no pain, he felt no pleasure.  And part of him felt that he would never feel either again.  He had not cast the spell yet, had not uttered the words, but already there was magic here, and the curse of this magic was already upon him.
He read inscription after inscription, but they were neither the right time period nor the right names.  He searched their castle intensely as well, or what was left of it.  There was a darkness in the place, to be sure, as well as some remnant of magic.  But he found nothing except rusted red blood stains.  He wrote of this extensively to his mother, and she, with her impeccable knowledge of old families and pedigree, informed him that the Gaunts had been direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin.
He felt that despite the success of the previous night, he had reached a new low as well.  His stomach was aching from lack of regular nourishment.  His head was pounding from the wine.  His back was in agony from spending the night on the floor when he was used to the softest and highest quality feather beds.  To add to it, his clothes were dirty, and smelled of damp and sea and sweat.
Voldemort was speaking again, but the words sounded as if they were spoken underwater.  Every one of them unintelligible.  He felt the arms around him let him go and he fell forward, the pain increasing at the sudden and harsh contact with the floor.
His mother was crouching by Lucius’s body, wearing a silky night gown that reached the floor. “Now!” he yelled again.
He walked the entire day, not eating, not resting.  He traced his wand over every surface he could reach, and it seemed with every step his certainty only grew. He knew now that this was no false lead, no fertility rock, no abandoned fortress.  He was moving towards his destiny.
He waited in silence, evening out his breathing, and trying to stop his hands from shaking.  He needed the moon to be up before he could proceed.  He felt time move with agonizing slowness as the sky above him darkened.  When at last he could spot specks of stars above him he got up and walked to the precise spot where he had laid Harry to rest so many months before.
For his part, being alone suited him. It was a great reprieve from the pressures he had felt the last few years.  There was no one here to criticize him, and no one here he had to shield himself from.  He enjoyed the solitude, and the beauty of the wilds, and, more than anything being able to spend the bulk of his time thinking.
The truth was he was not sure.  His dreams and his reality were intertwined, and both seemed to be full of nothing but Potter.  He made a shrugging gesture.
He sat up.  His bedroom was pitch black and he had no sense of what time, or even what day, it was.  He stretched his arms up and twisted his neck from side to side ‘til he heard a crack.  Next to him Harry was awake, his one green eye staring at him through the dark.
There was a flash of light and he held his breath, a surge of panic mixed with everything else.  He waited a second and then another, before opening his eyes again.  He was still lying just where he had been, vomit all over him, the Dark Lord towering before him.  “What-” he croaked the word out. “What?” Was he somehow immune, had he survived like Harry had survived?
“It’ll stop once we have more Dittany,” said Draco.  But Harry was right.  It was now happening almost everyday.  He summoned the Dittany from across the room and filled the usual bowl, soaking Harry’s fingers in the liquid.
Draco quickly gave up on the idea of this being simple, or easy, and started from the beginning again.  This time he went painstakingly slowly, rune by rune, even going so far as to pass his wand through the yellowed margins of each word in search for some secret inscription.  He made out entire sentences wondering if Cepheus had concealed this most powerful of all spells in the thicket of something entirely different.  By nightfall he had only gone through a dozen or so pages and he was tired.
His posture straightened. He was not going to be able to manage this alone.  He needed an ally, and there was really only one he would consider.
This time, when he moved towards the sarcophagus, he felt no reverie.  He reminded himself that it was only a cave, only an unmarked grave.  This was no place to intimidate a Malfoy, and whoever the dead man was, he was nothing to him.
His head was pounding, and he was covered in cold sweat.  This was a nightmare.  “I-” he croaked the word.  He would never be able to admit it, not in front of all these men.
He straightened up when he finished and looked over his shoulder.  Narcissa was just where he had left her, still in that black cloak that was blending more and more into the background with every passing moment.  “You should leave,” he told her.
“I will have my meals sent up from now on-” he commanded her.  “Bring some of everything, and tea and coffee, too.”
The idea was so ghastly that Draco could not begin to wrap his head around it.  How could he live after this? How could he exist in any form, settle into any kind of normality? It was impossible.  This had to be the end of his life, there could be no after-
He moved closer to Harry on the bed, shrinking the distance between them.  They lay on the same pillow, and he put his arm around him.  Natural as ever, Harry lay his head on Draco’s shoulder, shuffling his body slightly downward until they were comfortably tucked into each other.  Draco kissed the top of his head, Harry’s messy hair tickling his nose.
“I know,” said Draco, more sharply than he intended to.  “But the thing is that I’m going to figure this out.  We’re gonna figure this out,” he leaned closer to him and kissed his cheek.  “You’re gonna get better again, we’ll try more things, I’ll steal that fucking book again if I have to.”
In consequence of this he started staying in places longer, investigating them for days at a time before moving on.  He spent most of his time under the cloak, moving between trees, putting his palm against stones and mossy rocks.  Although he knew very little about old magic, there was something familiar in it.  Maybe it was because of his bloodlines, but old magic made the air feel different.  He could sense it when they were getting close to Hogwarts, a shift in the space about them.  It wasn’t a smell, it wasn’t a taste, it was nothing he could put his finger on; it was a feeling, clinging to every particle, as if magic had a weight all its own.
He never managed to fall asleep again that night.  Harry slumbered quietly, curled up on his bed and Draco watched him, seated on the window.  Nothing like this could happen again.  He was not gonna let Harry die.
They were in a meeting together, and he sat as far away from him as politeness would dictate.  He had stayed quiet all meeting long, in his beautiful new indigo robes, the trimmings golden in the firelight. He had just been admiring the sleeves when the Dark Lord asked him a question.
He dreamt in red.  Blood splotches on his hallways.  Portraits empty in their frames. Voices that called out to him: “Nasty situation you let happen, Lucius.”
“No, just in poor spirits-” she pointed to the window.  “It’s winter, it doesn’t agree with him.  He will be quite alright by summer.  I believe he will even rejoin the Dark Lord’s service.  There is no need to worry.”
The remains in the tub were no more.  The mangled clothes. The rotting fresh.  The protruding bones.  The wilted, unidentifiable organs.  The dried blood.  The crushed face.  It was all gone.  Instead there was a familiar boy, a familiar face.
He turned his eyes to the next page.  It had further instruction on the working of the spell.  It could, of course, simply be uttered, but there were things to make it more potent.  He read through these instructions, which were made by the same hurried hand.  They brought a knot to his stomach.  He had thought that digging up Harry would be the worst part, but sections of these instructions made that seem like a children’s game.
“I shall,” she gave his cheek a chaste kiss. “You’re very busy with the Ministry of course, it was silly of me to suggest it.”  She looked over at Draco conspiratorially.  “Is that agreeable to you darling?”
She beamed.  “Do you want to hear about Great Aunt Cassiopeia sinking submarines during the second muggle war?”
He would wake up in sweats, clinging to Narcissa by his side, touching and possessing her to ease himself, but it was never enough, never enough.  Everything was getting so confused.
A second later the spell was lifted, and he found himself in the middle of a scream that filled the room.  His body shivering and convulsing, the pain still lingering, just under the skin.
“I think it’s important for young men to see the world a little, to travel.  It was important for you, wasn’t it?”
The Dark Lord laughed.  “How diplomatic.” Careless, he flicked his wand and more blood came out Harry.
Loving someone, really truly loving someone, could not coexist with wanting things from them.  Love was not a negotiation; it was an absolute.  At school, his friends had followed him, but wasn’t that largely because of his status? Because of his money? Because of his looks? And if that were true, then how could he have ever thought that it was love?
They formed a comfortable little routine.  They slept in most mornings – lying in bed for hours after they had woken up.  These mornings were the best and sweetest part of his day.  Sometimes they would just hold each other; other times they have whispered conversations, like schoolboys afraid to be overheard.  Draco often talked about his family, and Harry described death over and over and over again, as if this was the only thought in his head.
“Yeah.  Mostly as self-defence against the Dursleys, or the kids at school.  But of course, I didn’t know it was really magic.”
“It’s okay,” said Draco, raising his head to look at him.  He didn’t even realize he was smiling.  “It’s all alright.  We’re back together again, like we should have always been.” He pulled Harry’s hand up till it was in front of his face and then kissed each of the knuckles.  “I’m gonna take care of you.  I am not going to let anything happen to you.  We’re gonna be safe, we’re gonna be safe.”
She poked the tip of his nose.  “I think you could do anything you wanted; you have greatness in your blood.”
“We’re gonna get more Dittany, we can go through a vial a day if that will help.  And I told Diri to get some mandrake juice too, maybe that will help-”
They went outside every day now.  They made their way through the house, Draco pointing out every portrait and explaining how he was related to them, while his elders sneered and rolled their eyes.  They took books from his father’s library to entertain themselves at night and read them out loud to each other by wand light.  He suddenly craved pudding, and turkey, and wanted his eggs scrambled instead of sunny side up.  Every single time he asked for something Draco felt greater satisfaction in what he had done.  It didn’t feel so selfish anymore.  It wasn’t about him needing Potter, it was about them both needing each other, and now he was sure of it.
“My Lord.  Of course, that is what I call you,” his voice trembled, the tone rising and falling unnaturally.  “I am your devoted servant.”
Draco was also unaware of the strange little habits he had picked up in all his searches.  Now whenever he was outside, his palm was running along walls, reaching out for
He never thought much about the specifics.  If in this reality they were both Gryffindors or Slytherins, if Crabbe and Goyle were their friends or Weasley and Granger. That stuff didn’t matter to him.  What mattered was spending time with Harry, getting to know him (understand him).  What mattered most of all to Draco was getting the opportunity to start fresh.  Merlin, everything would have been different, absolutely everything.
With Harry everything was different.  This was someone who wanted nothing from him.  This was someone who loved him despite all the ways in which he had fucked up and all the ways in which he had hurt him.  There was no pretending with him.  No mask to put on. Draco could just be himself, contrary and broken as he was.
What would have happened if he had confronted him?  If he had opened up to him?  What would have happened that day in the bathroom?  He turned these thoughts over and over.  Always coming up with alternatives far better than the current reality.
Despite the Dittany he was taking, he now coughed blood regularly.  It had quickly been normalized by them, and Harry always said: “I don’t feel it really, it doesn’t hurt or anything.”  But it was growing increasingly alarming as it began happening on a daily basis.
“I know!” said Draco, so angry he wanted to throw something at her. Why had he let that book out of his grasp? Why had he not at least copied the pages?  Why had he just handed it over?
He beamed and pulled on the sleeve of her black velvet dress. “What did he do? Did he bring her back from the dead?”
His love for Harry was also a different thing, incomparable with any sentiments he had had for others.  He loved Harry in his entirety and without question.  He loved the Harry of his memories, quick to anger, quick to act, always in the middle of some mischief.  But he also loved the Harry who lay next to him, peaceful and sleepy, and, more likely than not, dreaming of death.  This Harry who was gentle, and hurt, and a smaller version of his old self, just like Draco was.
The person below – that person whom he loved so much, whom he would do anything for – was really no longer a person.  He had reverted back to a corpse, withdrawn from his physical body. And although there was no way to speak to him, Draco knew that Harry was away, that he had entered his dreams again.  That he was imagining that quiet, empty world of death.
In another of her letters Narcissa mentioned that a few of his school fellows had come to see him at the Manor. Among them Goyle and Pansy.  They, of course, couldn’t know what he was up to, and his mother was not foolish enough to confide in them.  But she had written that they missed him, and that Pansy, especially, was concerned since she had not seen him since the Battle.
, thought Draco with another horrible pang.  “Of course, I suppose I may have overdone myself,” the Dark Lord mused.  “You were never strong, maybe I have performed one cruciatus too many.”
Draco tried again to lurch forward, trying to fight against the constraints that held him in place.  But the only bit of his body he was capable of moving at all were his eyes.  One of the Death Eaters shouted crucio, and the memory of the pain was enough to make him want to cry.
He slumped over. It felt like he was going to be sick.  Like he was fading away.  He could feel his visioning tunneling in, but he had to push past that.  He had to do this alone, and he had to do this to the best of his abilities.  Harry was counting on him.  Feeling strangely out of equilibrium, he rested his head against the side of the tub.  It was smeared with his own blood, and he was sure it was leaving a mark on his forehead as he gathered up his strength for the next challenge.
He did not want to see this.  He could not stand to see it.  Not again.  There was a horrible gut churning noise of flesh being hit and then he put his arms over his head.  He wanted to tune it all out.  To be elsewhere.  But where?  Where would he possibly go? Even if he could get away, what would be the point if he and Harry were not together.
Slowly Harry’s eyes fluttered open.  One socket was empty, the other had the familiar green eyes that he had so often admired from a distance.  “Harry?”
Draco smiled at him and gently interlaced their fingers.  The touch was everything.  It grounded him, and it seemed to clear his head.  “Come on we have to get up, we have to get you warm.” He rose on legs that felt as weak as pudding.  “Can you get up, Harry?”
“Well-” began Draco.  “I am the last Black-” his father made a derisive noise.  “And you named me Draco.  The Dark Lord is starting a revival of the old ways, and the old magic, wouldn’t Cepheus’s teaching be a perfect fuel for it? Isn’t it-” he moved his eyes to meet his mothers.  “Don’t you think that this is my destiny?”
Draco struggled against Selwyn. He wanted to rush to Harry, to help him somehow.  He looked so small like that, so vulnerable, the four black figures towering over him. There was already blood dribbling out of his mouth.
“I just know they won’t hold me,” said Harry with another shake of his head. “They just – they just feel dead.”
At first, he paid no attention to their talk about the future, but as he grew stronger, a new idea began to form in his mind.  It was not a clear plan, just a thought, hazy and wayward.  Sometimes it seemed ridiculous to him, the whimsical desires of an overgrown boy.  Other times it was frightening, and malicious, a dark thing that had to be hidden from others, even his parents.
“Harry,” he whispered, tentatively.  He wanted a response, illogical as that was.  “Harry?”  He paused again, but he couldn’t hear anything, not the wind, or the sea, or his would-be friend.  He was alone.   He turned onto his stomach on the bed, burying his head in one of the pillows.
Draco glanced at Harry on the bed.  He was laying on his back, his one eye on Draco, the sheet leaving him bare from the waist up.  His eyes ran down the scars at his neck, at each of his arms, and the redness of his torso where he had been ripped open.  Then he looked down at his own chest, where the marks Harry had left on him still stood out against his pale skin.
“He loved her.  He surrendered everything in the world for her.  They had no more castles, no more subservient muggles, no more dragons. Instead they moved from old place to old place, with nothing but one another.  For other wizards thought what he had done was wicked, and they wanted to hunt for them, to slay them.”
And still the green eye would move, and still the chest would rise and fall, and Draco knew that the thing in there, the thing that he had resurrected, was still with him, in this room, living his worst nightmare.
That had not been on purpose.  He hadn’t meant to disappear from the lives of the people who had once (so long ago) meant so much to him.  It had just happened.  After he got the Dark Mark, all of his priorities had switched.  And Hogwarts had seemed the stuff of children.  If he hadn’t been so horrified by the Dark Lord’s presence at Malfoy Manor, he probably would not have attended his last year.   What was the point anyway? It didn’t mean anything to him anymore.  And neither did people like Goyle or Pansy.  They were not bad, really, they were simply part of his past, like the stuffed animals he had gotten too grown to play with.
“Right,” said Draco, his hand smoothing his hair.  He was very jumpy and his heart was pounding.  “Are you hungry?”
Eventually, of course, he would have to go to Voldemort.  Either to present him with the book, or to be punished for his failure.  He had known that from the onset; however, he had never really visualized it.  And now that he had the book in front of him, it seemed a horrible thing to turn it over to the Dark Lord.  Although he had not translated every spell, he was sure there were things in here that would be to his liking.  But how else was he to get mandrake juice?
The day of All Hallows’ Eve he found himself deep in the Highlands.  He was following a sort of wisp in the air, a faint sense that was guiding him forever Northward.  From high cliffs he saw the sunrise over grey waters.  Underneath the cloak he was drenched from the previous night's rain, his hair was matted, his clothes had gone many days without change.  But in that moment, as he saw the golden light over the sea, he knew that all of these were unimportant details – there was something else coming – something stronger.  He was not moving North on a whim, there was something there, something calling to him.
When they reached the clearing, he took off the cloak at last.  He was well dressed, his hair combed, his teeth minty fresh. As she looked him over, he could see the gleam of pride in her eyes.  He took in her appearance as well and spotted a cloth bag tucked against the lining of her cloak.  She pulled it out and handed it to him.
He shook the last thought out of his head.  If Cepheus had kept his wife for decades, Draco was certain he could do the same with Harry.  He felt Harry’s hand cup his cheek, his fingers wiping away his tears.
Draco grabbed his wand from the nightstand and murmured lumos, sending a harsh white light over the scene.
She performed a spell he did not know, in the silent manner that she had, saying nothing, her face hiding any thought that she might have had.  “How does it feel now?” she asked Harry when the blue light had gone.
When the water had reached about halfway Draco began putting in salts and bubbles and flower petals, a process Harry observed with some curiosity.  He seemed more interested in this than he had in anything else so far.  It was good to see.
At that moment, and for the first time in his life, he found himself without anything to long for.  This was it – this was all he wanted.
Somehow, going back to the clearing in the Forbidden Forest where Harry lay felt more like coming home than returning to the Manor had.  He crouched by the grave as the bits of brightness filtered in through the high canopy of leaves above them.  It was a golden hour of sorts, with the sounds of the forest filling the air around them.
“He did.  He was the most powerful wizard of his age, maybe the most powerful wizard to ever live.  He was a master at killing, and he became in time a master of death too.  He came up with a counterpart spell for Avada Kedavra.  A spell to breath life back into the dead.”
He supposed searching for old magic was a little like investigating a crime scene.  He would choose a place to start and then surround it by a magical perimeter.  He would walk around it, fiddling with his wand, touching boulders and cliff walls, trying to feel the pulse of magic beneath them.  He looked for runes as well, for markers, for anything that might indicate the presence of wizards.
The events of that day were crystallized in his memory, but at the same time they felt distant from himself.  As if he had been a different person then..  He remembered the Room of Requirement well, and Harry saving him, flying him out of the inferno.  He remembered his own arms around the boy’s waist, and his head pressed hard against his shoulder, too scared to cry, too scared to speak.
“I’ll be right back Harry,” said Draco, approaching the bed. “We’ll figure out what’s happening.  You’ll be okay again.”
Now that the barrier to Hogwarts had been forever broken, he could apparate directly to the school itself.  He chose an inconspicuous spot, right at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and for extra discretion he kept the invisibly cloak over himself.
He tried to look at Harry, but he couldn’t turn his head the right way. The only thing he could see was the wall next to him, and his ancestors in their old fashioned robes chasing after them from portrait to portrait, ever hungry for blood.
Draco was preparing a retort, when Narcissa stepped in for him.  “My love-“ she said in her most docile tone.  “You make an excellent point-” she got up gracefully from her seat and moved across the grass to stand beside him, one of her hands on his shoulder.  “There are so many opportunities for Draco here,” her fingers caressed his long blonde hair, and Draco could see the tension leaving his shoulders.  “You have made such a place for our family,” her words were dipped in adoration.
The smell of death and rot hit him even before he saw the mangled remains.  It was heavy and vile, and every instinct in his body was telling him to step away, to disengage.  He gagged at the smell, and then, thinking quickly, formed a magical air bubble around his nose and mouth like he would if he were swimming.
There was a chorus of agreements from around him, but Draco did not hear it.  He was full of disbelief.  He did not want it.  He would not do it.  He could not stand it.  To live, alone in this house, with his father, forever.  He vomited again at the very idea, and several of the Death Eaters laughed.
It was during the second week that he started moving around the countryside.  His journeys were made through a mostly barren land, moving from one scenic place to another.  He surrounded himself with mountains, cliffs, and the edges of the sea.  At first, he went from place to place quickly, too quickly perhaps, rejecting it in a matter of minutes after a brief search.  Later, he thought better of it.  Old magic was hard to detect, it was subtle, and he found himself sorely ignorant of its ways.
“I am so proud of you, my darling, you know my father was just your age when he went on this quest as well.”
“Don’t listen to her Harry,” said Draco, grabbing the other boy’s hand.  “She doesn’t understand.  You’re alright, none of this is temporary.”
Grandiose and regal, the Dark Lord slowly rose from his throne.  The room was full of blood and a smell so vile that Draco found himself vomiting all over the carpet.   “Draco-” Narcissa said, her voice breaking.  He could not bear to turn around and look at her. He did not want to see her again.  He did not want to see anything ever again.
He had expected to be anxious in the wilderness, instead he found a sort of peace.  There was no need to pretend anymore, and no one to please.  He spent the first week in a clearing in a forest, looking through the extensive notes and maps that generations of Blacks had left to guide him.  His grandfather Cygnus had been especially good at keeping track of all the places that he had already investigated, which of course would make Draco’s search easier (and hopefully more fruitful).
Draco slid to his knees on the dungeon floor.  He stared at the blank wall in front of him, nausea rising up from the pit of his stomach.  He was sick all over himself, gagging and hurling, the sounds monstrous in the echoing chamber.  And for a long time afterwards he stayed right there, filthy and empty.  Something had gone terribly wrong.  He was living and Harry Potter was dead and that was simply not how things were supposed to go.
He replayed time and time again the two instances when he had actually seen Harry wearing it.  The first was when they were 13 and Harry had snuck into Hogsmeade.  It had been a chilly day in November and Harry, invisible, had thrown mud balls at him, Crabbe, and Goyle.  His aim was admittedly quite good, but then the cloak had slipped to reveal his face.  Draco still remembered it so perfectly.  The sunshine reflecting on his glasses, his cheeks flushed from the cold and the exercise, his mouth in a comical angle, like he had been caught right in the middle of a laugh.
The hand that had made them was sloppy and tilted but he was fairly sure of his translation.  It was a fertility spell, which required a particular phase of the moon, and a mixture of semen and mandrake juice.  Draco set the stone down with disappointment, and then continued scanning the area.
To add to that concern, there was the fact that his extremities would sometimes blacken.  They looked like they had gotten nasty frostbite and his only solution was to soak them in Dittany.  That seemed to solve the problem, but only temporarily.  It was also concerning that the rot seemed to be spreading.  Sometimes, when Harry stretched or scratched at his skin, Draco would get a whiff of the nauseating smell of rotten flesh.
“Yeah, and I didn’t dream this time.”  He got out of bed, his body heavy and sore.  He felt like he used to after getting really sick as a child – sweaty and gross, with too many human needs to accurately address any. “Are you hungry?”
Once he had finished, the substance was a few inches deep, reflecting the dusky purple sky above them.   He got out every last drop he could from the jars, using magic to lift up the last droplets and then drop them in.
After that, his sense of time was even further distorted.  He knew that many prominent Death Eaters, among them his father, had taken turns cursing Harry’s body, making it spin in the air, making it convulse with cruciatus, lifting it up and then letting it fall till Draco could hear the bones inside him break.  But that was just the start.
What would have happened if he had been caught then?  If Draco had really handed him over, like he was supposed to? How would he feel then? Would Harry’s death seem more real to him? Would he have gotten the opportunity to actually watch him die?
Since he started at Hogwarts his world had revolved around the other boy.  Outdoing him where he could, fighting him when he had to, being his counterpart, his rival. Almost every choice he had ever made over the last 7 years had somehow been linked to Potter.  And now what? What was he supposed to do?
This is like nothing I have ever written before but as soon as I saw the prompt I knew I wanted to give it a try.  Thank you so much @trigerlili for this wonderful idea that has given me so much pain and pleasure.
His father was the first to appear.  “What in Merlin’s name-” he began, but he stopped when he saw Draco.  His eyes went wide, looking at the blood and then at the wild, desperate look in his eyes.
“Yeah.  Look, I’m not hungry either.  Let’s both of us just eat some and then we can go back to bed.”
Without thinking twice about it, Draco raised his wand and shot a stunning spell at him, knocking him backwards into the room.  He could hear shuffling from within, and something that sounded like a gasp: “Draco?”
She turned back, moving her wand across him again.  “Get my essence of Dittany,” she commanded the elf.  With a snap Diri disappeared and they were left alone.  Draco stumbled towards the bed.
After checking to make sure Lucius was still in bed, Draco and Harry set out.  The day was cold but pretty, with a breeze that fluttered through the invisibility cloak and against their cheeks.  They walked together closely, hidden beneath it, Draco’s arm protectively around Harry’s waist.
He ran out of his room, not caring that he was only wearing underwear, not caring that there was blood on him.  With his lit wand ahead of him he dashed through the hallways, his ancestors in their portraits shouting after him.  When he reached his parent’s bedroom door, he pounded at it, loud enough to wake the dead.
He had to let the remains soak in mandrake juice under a full moon. And then he had to sacrifice parts of himself for his beloved.  Blood first.  Bone second.  Semen third.  He had to cut himself, and rip himself, and then, somehow, still find the pleasure to spill his seed. It was grotesque.  Cepheus had also failed to indicate how much blood or bone the spell required.
He was pale, with one hand still held against his mouth, sticky with blood.  “Does something hurt?” said Draco as he pushed the wet sheets away from his body, trying to see if any of his scars had burst open, or if he had any bruising that might explain this.
“That is of no help at all-”  he turned his attention to the Death Eaters behind Harry.  “Anybody care to voice an opinion?”
“I don’t know if I hurt either, to be honest,” said Draco.  With the only two fingers remaining in his left hand he picked up his discarded wand from the grass.  He murmured a healing spell to close off the wound in his arm, and then another on his bloody, stumpy fingers.  “I guess that will do for tonight,” he said as he took a tentative step towards the tent.
That earned him a smile.  They moved to face each other in the water, a generous space between them.  The air smelled of lavender and eucalyptus.  It was almost dreamlike to see Harry like this, relaxed, off his guard, the shimmering bubbles reflected in his green eye.
He started talking more.  Telling Draco all sorts of things that he had never imagined about the boy before.  About his cupboard, and his fear of dogs, about his first train ride to Hogwarts, and the picture album of his parents that Hagrid had given him at the end of first year.  Colour seemed to drain back into him and, with it, want.  He had been so passive the first few days, like a lost child.  But now he was making decisions and choices for himself.  There were things he didn’t want anymore, and things he wanted more of.
.  He did it unconsciously - it had simply become an automatic response.  He was also using his wand more and more, even for little things, like filling a glass of water or cutting up his dinner.  His mother would have disapproved, to her way of thinking magic was not meant for the inconsequential, but then again, her way of thinking was no longer Draco’s.
Draco could tell by the heavy chandelier above them that they were being brought into the dinning room.  Whoever was dragging him pulled him up by his shoulders, bringing him to his feet.  Draco tried to get away from their grip but Selwyn was large, and his muscular arms went around him easily, pressing in on him like a snake.
Draco would stay awake late into the night, watching him breathing.  Watching this miraculous boy who had survived so much, and had chosen, was choosing every day, to remain by his side.  Draco had always thought he knew what love was.  His parents surely loved him.  His parents surely loved each other.  And plenty of other people had loved him: Pansy, and Crabbe, and Goyle.  It was only now that he was realizing the falseness of this assumption.
With one last look at the moon above, Draco began to undress.  He took off every item of clothes carefully, delicately, folding it with magic and laying it in a neat pile at the foot of the tub.  It was already November and the chill of the night stung his body, making goosebumps form all over his flesh.  There was a vulnerability to being naked in the dark, and he relished in it.  At last it felt like he was making amends.  He was going to give Harry everything he had to give: his blood and his bones, his dignity and his pride.  Everything part of his body and everything in his life.  All of it.
“I didn’t-” Draco looked back at Harry, meeting the single green eye.  His voice faltered and he couldn’t pick up what he had started.
After that he remembered hiding, shuffling about, unsure what he was doing, and what side he was really on.  He had duelled a few people, but only because he had been trying to find his mother. After that he remembered nothing until Voldemort marched back into the castle, with a chained-up Hagrid beside him, Harry’s corpse in his arms.
“In the old places,” she whispered.  “And Cepheus travelled through all of them.  The Pike mountains in the north, the Snowden to the East, he even went to the continent.  In his travels he acquired more knowledge and more magic than any living wizard. And when he returned to his castle, he was no longer alone.
It had been a childish moment, really.  It would have been better to take Harry straight to Voldemort.  So many things would have been different if he had…. But somehow in that instance it had not even occurred to him.  The Dark Mark was already branded into his skin, but he had never really managed to think like a Death Eater.  He had only thought of humiliating Harry, never of truly harming him.
She came to their side, her wand drawn.  Again, there was the blue light that she emitted from her wand.  “His body is giving way,” she said, not bothering to whisper.
And then he fell into it again – a dazzling fantasy that was growing in reach every day – an alternate world where he and Harry had been friends.  Where they rode the train together.  Where Draco got to hear Harry’s ideas, his thoughts, his experiences outside of Hogwarts.  Where he told Harry all about his life, all about his parents, and the long legacies of both of his families, and the weighty responsibilities that he bore as the one heir to both.
For one thing there were only six days until the full moon, and in that time, he had to find and harvest a vast amount of mandrake juice.  And that was only the practical problem; there were many moral ones to contend with as well.
He didn’t notice that he had drifted off again until the door opened.  Once again, he jumped up in bed, looking around.  Harry was awake, and Diri was entering the room two large trays levitated by her side.
Without a struggle, both boys, malnourished and sick, were pulled from the room. Draco kicking and screaming like a child, Harry limp as a dead body, his one green eye staring at the ceiling.
“It wasn’t so bad-” Draco said without really thinking about it.  That day seemed like ages ago and whatever he had felt then, whatever fear and panic and pain, had faded.  He didn’t want Harry to carry any guilt over it.
His right hand shaking, he plunged it into the tub.  Trying not to take account of the things that he felt as he grabbed the knife handle and secured it in his grip once more.  He had gone over this act in his head a million times.  He had always accounted for the pain; but he had never accounted for the panic.  It felt like he couldn’t think straight.  Like the bridge between his intentions and his motor functions had been severed completely.  He found it hard to grip the knife properly, to get all his fingers in the right position.  And his vision was getting blurry, distorted.
Instead he began rearranging Harry’s remains so that they were at least roughly in the right place.  The mandrake juice had turned a deeper shade of brown, and he tried not to notice what the fluids were doing to the corpse itself.  It looked like all the flesh was turning to muck.
He appeared right between two old Elm trees, not far from the place where the Grounds Keeper’s cabin had once stood.  He could see the outline of the school perfectly against the grey morning sky.  Towers and windows and walls, all restored.  Of course, Hogwarts was not a school anymore, it was only a castle, and served as Voldemort’s personal residence.
“Many people have sought it, my own father among them, but nobody has found it yet-”  she was quiet for a moment, and then she added.  “It would take a very great and very clever wizard to find Cepheus’s grave, don’t you think?”
Once upon a time, Draco had really believed in fairy tales, in happy endings, in love ever after.  He had been foolish and small, but some idea of that must have lingered and stayed with him well into the present – until this very moment, in fact – he had really believed that they could be happy, that they could have everything.  Oh, how stupid he had been.  How selfish.  How cruel.  To bring Harry back to this world where nothing good ever happened.  To bring him back to a world where he did not even belong, to bring him back to be sick, to be numb, to be discovered and tortured and made to suffer.
“No, I can’t feel-” his sentence was interrupted when he coughed again, a new splatter of blood coming out of his mouth.
He turned around to see his mother just where she had been.  Her hands and feet still bound.  Whatever magic had been binding her was also stopping her corpse from falling.  The last expression on her face was anguish.  He could not remember Narcissa joyful, he could not remember Narcissa sad, and seeing her like this, every inch of her face overcome with agony, was like seeing a stranger.
By the time he finished with his favorite combinations the bath was almost full, thick pink and white bubbles streaming in the surface.  Draco ran a hand sheepishly through his hair.  It was quite ridiculous to be self-conscious about taking off his underwear, since Harry had already seen him naked, but he was.  He took them off as quickly as possible and immediately entered the water.
“You saved me, it’s only fair I save you.  We always did everything in equal measures.” A hint of a smile came onto his face. “I step on you, you cut me open, you save me from the flames, I bring you back to life.”
Then came bath time, another activity that stretched on for hours.  They would soak in the water together, sometimes quiet and almost sleeping, sometimes engaging in silly conversation.  Draco did most of the talking, but Harry chimed in with comments.  They talked about Quidditch, and trips to Hogsmeade, and all the particular moments they had shared.
Harry’s torso, however, was almost the worst and despite the protection of the air bubble, he gagged again just by its sight.  He had been ripped open just under the belly, like a pig for slaughter, half the organs missing from within. Draco turned away as he raised the severed head out of the grave.  He did not need to see that, he couldn’t see that.  But he heard it drop among the other pieces into the tub.  Lastly, he moved the rotting bits of blackened meat that had once been innards.
He entered the house through the back exit, the one usually used only by the house elves.  It was early morning by this point, the sky barely tinted by the first signs of sunshine.  Inside the old Manor the air was stuffy and had the faint hint of Lucius’s imported colognes.  He moved through familiar corridors slowly.  Around him the portraits of ancestors past continued sleeping and he cherished that rare silence.
Despite this, he did feel that the dream was a sign.  That perhaps wherever he was, Harry was also gravitating towards him.  That maybe – by some force of magic unknown or poorly understood – the Boy Who Lived was standing in this very room with him, more formless than a ghost, more powerless than a spirit, begging him to bring him back to the world of the living.
“Goodbye Draco,” said the Dark Lord, taking a step toward the door, his cloak escaping from between Draco fingers.  “I wish you a long, fulfilling life.”
Draco’s eyes had gone wide and he shook his head, a nasty feeling beginning in the pit of his stomach.
After a moment he sat down on a boulder to better take in the view.  He wondered if this was the kind of place where Harry had hidden.  Wondered if he had also been travelling, moving from place to place, in the wild.  He looked over at the spot beside him and really tried to picture him.  Small and skinny, his hair always a mess, his glasses overlarge, and behind them his eyes bright green.
He raised his wand high, and wordlessly moved off layers and layers of dirt, flinging them off to the other side of the clearing and causing a cloud of dust to rise.  He coughed as the earth settled, and then inched closer to the hole in the ground.
He couldn’t remember the question.  What had the question been? He stared at the floor in front of him in panic and, somehow, found his father’s eyes.  He was on the floor too, on his hands and knees.  His expression dazed; his hair messy.  And all at once Draco thought he was going to be sick.  They were mirror images of each other, lost and pitiful.
“Yes,” said Draco automatically, although the truth was that he didn’t know.  Suddenly the image of the revolting black organs came into his head, the way they had been the night of the ritual, putrid and spoiled, floating through the sky.  He set his fork down, nausea rising inside of him.
With the disjointed awkwardness of a toddler, Harry moved his limbs and rose, with help from Draco’s good hand.  Carefully Draco guided him to step outside the tub, till they were standing right next to each other, naked under the moonlight.
The day he was to leave they had a last breakfast together under a powder blue sky. In order to give them a greater peace of mind Draco ate more than he cared to.  When it was his time to leave, they walked with him all the way to the gates.
It was cold, and perfect, snowflakes drifting in slow motion.  He stopped to take a deep breath of that cold air, which seemed to purity as it touched.  He was just thinking that this had been a very good idea when wham – he was hit by a well-aimed snowball right in the chest.
But slowly, day by day, the idea began to take shape, to grow stronger.  Now when he managed to eat a little more than usual he found himself thinking,
After taking his ears, one of the Death Eaters stabbed his eye with the tip of his knife, emitting a gushing sound.  He twisted the knife hard into the socket and when he pulled it out, the eyeball came with it.  That earned him a congratulatory whoop from the Death Eater next to him.
The edges of Harry’s mouth lifted into another smile.  “Now you won’t have to.”  His voice was so gentle as he said those words.  It sounded almost nothing like the voice he remembered.
“Did I take a spell during the Battle?” he asked another day as they sat at the dinner table, Draco conspicuously absent again.
When Harry had been alive, outdoing and outshining him had been his life’s purpose.  Now it all would be reversed, and he would do everything in his power to bring Harry happiness. To give him rest. To give him peace.  To keep him safe.  He would shield him from everything that was going on in the world. Draco would gladly dedicate his life to him.
And that was the best that Draco could hope for him. That he did not feel the torment and trauma that his body was being subjected to.  But Draco felt it.  He felt every stab and every curse.  He felt a revolting anguish when they began, again, to physically pull him apart.  To rip out fingers by magic, suspending them in the air like darts and then shooting them at Draco as they laughed.  Breaking all the bones of his feet with one of Lucius walking canes, the sound a disgusting symphony.  He watched as the Death Eaters grew more and more violent, eager to outdo each other, eager to show their master how little value they placed on life.
The search and the journey were changing him, both in ways he recognized and ways he was blind to.  For instance, he knew that he had begun the habit of earnestly talking to himself (or to Harry).  And he realized that he was spending the majority of his time, particularly if he was outside of the tent, wearing the invisibility cloak.  This was not only to feel closer to Harry, but because the cloak itself was old magic, and it seemed to be connecting him to his quest.
Draco helped him up, and then, propping his arm around the other’s waist, he carefully guided him out of the room.  For a moment he thought of the stack of books they had carefully selected together, and now left abandoned over the floor.  “I don’t think she means anything by it,” said Harry.  “She just-”
“Is that safe?” said Draco, taking another step towards them.  He remembered Madam Pomfrey using it on him, but for external wounds.  He had never heard of anything taking it orally.
Before entering he removed his invisibility cloak and cast Lumos.   He had expected to find something grand.  A castle carved into the stone, or, at the very least, a high vaulted ceiling like those underneath Malfoy Manor.  What he found instead was a small space, about the size of a closet.  For a moment he thought it was empty, and then he saw the rune for life written on one of the walls.  He approached it, and held his palm against it.  It felt damp to the touch and, although it was neither hot nor cold, it made his skin tingle.
Carefully, one by one, he unravelled the fabric to reveal jars, and unscrewed the lids.  As the light in the Forest dimmed, he spilled their contents into the tub.  The scent was familiar.  It brought back days in Herbology class, looking at Potter’s reflection in the glass of the green house.
Throwing caution to the wind he magicked the door of the library open and shouted for Narcissa.  “It’s gonna be fine,” he assured Harry, his hand feeling the boy’s thighs.  “It’s probably just temporary, a spasm or something-” his tone was not convincing, it was panicked and they both knew it.   He turned to the door again and shouted for her.  “Mum will know what to do-” he said, although those words, foolish and hopeful as they were, were ultimately empty.
It was of a sturdy build, the binding thick but supple. It had no title, no markings on the spine, but it bore telltale signs of having been much used.  The binding had the indentation of fingernails, and scorch marks, and something dark that looked like ink at one of the corners.  He pressed his palm against it before pulling it open.
“Infatuated-” the word rang through the room.  “How very interesting.  To do so much for only such a petty reward.”
There were many similar findings, which he documented with mounting frustration both in the letters he sent his parents, and in the documents that Blacks before him had begun.  A week or so after the fertility stone he came to a ruined fortress, with a graveyard to boot.  He could sense magic in the area, and an excitement began mounting within him.  But this was not the place, as the family buried bore an unfamiliar last name: Gaunt.
Draco squeezed his hand tight.  He was going to get to see Harry in situations he never had before.  He was going to fill his head with happy memories of them, to overwrite all the violence, and hatred, and bickering.  They were going to be together, to have a happily ever after, like heroes did in fairy tales.  Like Cepheus’s had in his mother’s story.
They descended, and as soon as they landed, he heard a now familiar wet cough behind him.  He turned to see Harry casually mopping up the blood with his sleeve, red at the corner of his mouth.   He froze in place, the broomstick still in his hand.  He knew that this was normal, that it was happening every day, but it was another painful reminder that he had no idea how much longer they had together.
After that the story of Cepheus faded from his memory once more.  There was so much else happening, and he had to keep his wits about him.  There was no time to be wasted on old fables, even if they did have half truths in them.
Sounds raged on below him.  The sounds of a body being torn to pieces. The sounds of his father crying.  The sounds of the Dark Lord’s occasional commands, of the Death Eater’s shouts and insults.  And to think these were the last words that the Great Harry Potter would ever hear.
“I have seen inside your head.  If I want you to truly pay for what you did, I must have you live.”  He laughed for the third time, shill, and cold, and loud as thunder.
They looked at each other across the table.  “Why would you want to do that, darling?” said Narcissa, looking him over with wide grey eyes just like his.
Draco was quiet.  He loved hearing stories about their family.  About ancestors who had been great Quidditch players, or Ministers of Magic, or who had fought against the discrimination that wizards faced at the hands of the muggle majority.  But this felt like a very different kind of story.  “Do you think they were happy?”
When they entered the room she was in, she did not even put up a fight.  She dropped her wand to the floor and raised her hands over her head.  This was unfamiliar to her – she had never surrendered before.
He reached his hand inside the tub and touched the back of Harry’s hand with his dirty fingers just to reassure himself.  It felt like skin.  Like normal human skin.  Harry made no move to shift away from him, he stayed where he was, watching him with that one green eye.
Harry stretched out a hand gracing Draco’s collarbone.  Delicately he moved downward until he was tracing the marks he had left on his skin.  “That’s the worst thing I ever did to anyone.”
For a few minutes he waited like that, one hand gripping the knife, the other tilted down, blood dripping down his fingers and into the tub.  When he felt a little bit of strength returning, he gripped the knife hard again.  He extended the fingers of his left hand, which was entirely covered in blood.  He took another bracing breath, raised the knife into the air, and then swept it down to his fingers.
However, quickly enough other interests took precedence.  Quidditch, and Potter; his studies, and Potter; keeping a dedicated band of followers, and Potter.  It was a lot of work, actually, and the longer he spent away from his mother, the more he saw her stories as nothing more than old wizarding fairy tales.  In reality no wizard, no matter how great, could fly, or transform into any animal, or raise the dead.  That was kids’ stuff.  And Draco had more important things on his mind.
Harry coughed blood.  “I am not really back from the dead, Tom,” he smiled, all his teeth stained red.
He turned his back on Harry, wondering if he also wanted a little privacy.  A few moments later he heard splashing and felt the weight of another person in the water.  Draco looked back at him over his shoulder.  His wet hair was flat for once and his hands were full of bubbles.  “I used to take baths like this all the time when I came home from school,” said Draco, consciously trying to fill the silence.
Draco had spent the best parts of his childhood here. Playing with his mother, hiding from her, watching her pick flowers.  But seeing it with Harry felt like seeing it for the first time.   “That’s where I first remember doing magic,” Draco said fondly as he looked at one particular rose bush.  “I was three or four and I fell in.  But I didn’t get cut; it felt like I was floating for a moment, and then mum came.  Did you do magic like that?”
One morning Draco woke up abruptly with the sense that something was wrong.  His eyes shifted over to the shadowy figure beside him.  Harry was sat up, his shoulders squared and stiff, one of his hands  up to his mouth.  “Harry?” he whispered, gently laying a hand on the other’s shoulder.  Harry lurched forward violently and vomited all over the sheets.
For a moment he thought that she was going to deny him.  That she was going to refuse to tell this story at this time.  But the hesitation (if there was really any hesitation) lasted only an instant.  She moved to the side of his bed, sitting just as she had when he was a boy.  Her dress folded neatly; her hands, beautiful and ringed, in her lap.
“I just don’t feel connected to any of it-”  he looked down at his chest. “I recognize it as my body, and I know that I can move it, but it’s like when it’s very cold and you can’t feel your fingertips.”
His parents looked formidable together, like pale marble statues.  He smiled at each of them and then he turned on the spot and apparated away.
Harry’s one green eyes was fixed on him.  It was neither sad nor sacred, but there was something else there, some anxiety.  And for the first time Draco realized that Harry was not scared of dying, he was scared of leaving him alone again.  Draco squeezed his eyes tight; he was not going to cry; he was not going to cry in front of her.  “Fix him,” he said, grinding his teeth together.
Other things, he was oblivious to.  Like the fact that he was slowly losing weight.  That his face was gaunt, and the circles around his eyes darker than ever. He had not looked in a mirror since leaving his mother’s house, but if he had, Draco would have been shocked by his own reflection.  There was little of Lucius’s grace and dignity left in his features.  In fact, he was looking more like dear aunt Bellatrix by the day.  There was something new in his grey eyes, something unnatural, something Black.
After about an hour the hand was back to normal, but they left it there a bit longer.  “Do you want breakfast?” Draco muttered.
Unmistakably, fear flashed through Lucius’s eyes.  They all knew how much he hated being alone with him.  “You do it.”
“Yeah,” he pulled out his wand and summoned the invisibility cloak from his room.  It zoomed towards them.  If Narcissa was right, if their time really was limited, then he wasn’t gonna deny Harry anything.
“He has to get out of the house,” he told Narcissa one day over breakfast, when Draco failed to show up again.
In the evening he would walk around the forest in Harry’s old invisibility cloak.  He loved the feel of it against his skin, and every time he slipped it on, he thought of how often Harry had worn it, how many hours he had spent with it on.  Had it been with this cloak that he had found the Chamber of Secrets?  Had it been with this cloak that he used Umbridge’s fireplace?
He swept the invisibility cloak proudly over his shoulders and marched out of that cave, his back straight.  He had come here to do something, and it had been done.  Once again, he had been successful, and once again his instincts had been true.  Finding this book had been his destiny.
“Oh yes, the legend tells us that they lived a hundred years together.  That he learned so much from her, and that he cared for her every day of his life.  He is supposed to be buried somewhere in the mountains of Scotland, and they say there is a spellbook there, buried with him.”
Abruptly he rose from the bed and walked over to the window.  From here he could look down at the extensive Malfoy gardens.  They had, of course, seen better times.  His father had had little time to care for things as he usually would.  The place was overgrown, and not the luscious green he remembered.  Everything was a little dry, a little dead.  He wondered where the peacocks had gone, he hadn’t seen them for weeks.  Perhaps they had made a valiant escape right under the nose of the Death Eaters, like Potter had.
“And it is an old tradition in my family, and you know how much that means to me.  I am proud to be a Malfoy, but I was born Narcissa Black, and I shall never forget that.”
Lucius was quiet, but the frown lines had disappeared from his forehead, and Draco was sure he was already won over.  “It would ultimately be the Dark Lord’s decision.”
“Oh, he did.  At last, after single handedly defeating an entire Kingdom, he found her secret tower.  He flew up to the window, rejoicing in having found his beloved again.  But do you know what he found Draco?”
“Yeah, it’s me-“ he made a sound that was half a sob, half a laugh.  “Your rival at school, remember?”
A second later Diri appeared again, holding a small, clear vial.  Narcissa pulled on Harry’s jaw, opening up his mouth and pouring droplets of the clear liquid within.
“Shut up!” Draco yelled, grabbing hold of the first thing within reach – an ugly but probably very expensive porcelain miniature – and throwing it with full force at the painting of the 3 witches brewing a cauldron that hung in the library.
“Unfortunately, this magic has been lost for a long time, barred from being written by those like Albus Dumbledore who separate magic arbitrarily into good and dark.”
“We fear your greatness!” exclaimed Narcissa, over the animal noises coming out of her husband’s mouth.  “We fear your power.  As do all, Death Eater or not.”
His dreams were nasty.  They involved bloodshed, and inferi, and Voldemort’s horrific red eyes staring at him from the inside of a sarcophagus.  He sat bolt upright as he woke, staring in confusion at the room around him.  He was relieved to see Harry, still in bed next to him, curled up like a cat, his head resting on his own arm.
But these days everything was more treacherous.  The world was full of spies.  If he so much as stepped foot in a public setting, Voldemort would know about it.  He sighed, and ran his fingers through his hair, combing it back.  It was getting ridiculously long, like his father’s (like his mother’s), and felt silky between his fingers.  He pushed and pulled at it nervously, trying to think of a course of action.
Draco’s eyes fell closed, and he shuffled a little closer to Harry, laying his head down in the space between their two pillows.
