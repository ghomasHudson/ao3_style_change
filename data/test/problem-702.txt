They buy a cat. Draco thinks she’s part kneazle. Harry names her Canis Major and Draco asks why she’s named for a dog constellation. Harry shrugs and looks so sad for a moment that Draco wants to melt into the floor and hug Harry forever simultaneously. Canis Major jumps onto Harry's shoulder and purrs.
“The Gilded Lily” Harry proposes and Draco rubs his temples.
“No! I’m not.” Harry laughs again, alcohol making the memory bubble to the surface almost joyfully. “Third year’s whenI learned to cast a Patronus. I didn’t know I could until I needed to to save myself and Sirius from the Dementors.” He pauses, considering. “Sirius, he was my godfather, you know?”
Harry well and truly does not want to drink with these witches, but he cannot manage to make eye contact with any of his friends. He opens his mouth to attempt to refuse again when he’s saved by Draco sidling up next to him.
“Draco,” he says softly, when the blond man winces at the mention of Myrtle’s bathroom and sixth year, “I don’t think I ever apologized for that. I’m so sorry. I never should have hurt you. I should have tried to help you.” He feels a little bit like crying.
He clears his throat. “We’re going to head out, I think. If that’s alright with you both.” Ron turns to him with a knowing smirk.
For as well as things were going at work on Friday, they’re slow come the new week. Harry makes no progress on breaking the
“Harry, is that —”
The sun was starting to dip towards the horizon when he apparated the two of them home, entering to the smell of coconut milk and curry, and he found Draco in the kitchen, unboxing their favorite Thai takeaway.
“Harry, it’s perfect. Thank you,” he whispered, not trusting himself to speak any louder.
“Are we going to the South Pole?”
It was eerie to be there at night, and though Harry had been many places he wasn’t supposed to be over the course of his life, there was something particularly strange about walking through the broad sidewalks and past the sleeping animals in their enclosures.
He nodded, handing the necklace to Harry and shivering slightly as Harry brushed his hair off his neck, fastening the clasp and pressing a kiss to the top knob of his spine, running gentle fingers down his back.
“He still calls me Potter!” Harry argues.
Outside the window the lights of London seemed to glow against a shockingly clear sky. Draco crossed the room and dropped onto the couch next to his boyfriend, trying to catch a glimpse of what Harry was so invested in. He caught sight of the weather app, but didn’t manage to see the location before Harry turned off the screen and bumped their shoulders together.
Harry works to develop a menu. They throw tasting parties and Draco pairs wine with each course Harry makes, their friends getting tipsy and loud around their dining room table. Eventually Harry settles on a French and Indian fusion that confuses and delights everyone in equal measure.
Harry yawned and shuffled downstairs into the kitchen, stopping in the doorway to watch Draco as he shimmied around the kitchen in one of Harry’s old Gryffindor quidditch tees and a pair of his favorite black boxers. He walked up behind his husband and wrapped his arms around his waist, pressing his chest to Draco’s back and nipping soft kisses to the join of his shoulder and neck. Draco startled slightly and leaned back into Harry, very nearly dropping his head back right on top of Penny. Harry jerked his shoulder out of the way, and Draco spun in his arms, off balance and tilting towards the counter. Harry took in wide grey eyes, startled and unsteady, as they passed over his face and across to his shoulder, widening somehow impossibly more as he registered Penny’s presence.
“What do platypuses eat?”
at the zoo tomorrow, I will come with you to karaoke night. And I will not sing any Britney Spears. ABBA is still fair game though!”
“Whatever you say.”
“Hi, Gin.” He replies, perhaps a beat too late, because Ginny's got the smile on her face that makes her look more than a little predatory. It's intimidating as hell on the quidditch pitch, and the full force of it on him from just across a tiny restaurant table is making Harry feel like bolting.
Harry slowly started to pull back, and Draco grabbed his shoulders, pressing them back together, sinking into the kiss. He brushed his tongue along the seam of Harry’s lips, and sighed when the other boy tightened his hold on the back of Draco’s head.
“You brought me to Boston to see the lights.”
Draco closed his eyes and pressed closer to Harry as they lifted over the skyline, swooping between skyscrapers and office buildings, the lights flashing by painting the inside of his eyelids a warm red. He breathed in the fresh air mingled with the scent of Harry, the wind rushing through his hair, tickling the back of his neck.
Harry chokes on a piece of paneer.
“Go then.” She releases him and he sprints away, skidding into the spell damage ward and terrifying the mediwix at the healers station.
She squeezes his hand. “Talk to me, Harry.”
“Dr’co?” Harry mumbles into his chest “What’s wrong?”
Harry accelerated gently, and carried them away from the Ether Monument, over a set of bronze duck statues, and into the air above the Boston Commons. They soared over the Frog Pond, and around the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; they looped the Commons Carousel, and flew over the historic Granary Burying Ground, the light slowly fading and the sky turning periwinkle around them.
, or simply weird critter on his back.
Hermione laughs politely and turns all business. “Really though - Anthony over at Mungos said you’d brought someone in.” The two of them get up from the booth.
Harry’s working on disentangling the tightly wound threads of a particularly nasty compound curse later that day when it comes up again. He’s locked in his lab and all the wards are up so if he does trigger the curse instead of untangling it he doesn’t do damage to anyone but himself. This spell seems to be a modified version of
Harry angled them towards Siasconset, running them over the bluff walk and past the Sankaty Lighthouse before taking them up through the wildlife refuge to loop around the Great Point Lighthouse.
“It’s Potter-Malfoy to you, and who said anything about not being able to finish?”
He let her down from his shoulder as they settled in to eat dinner, placing her on the table next to him. He could feel Draco’s eyes on him as he loaded up his plate with panang curry and larb gai, but he wouldn’t meet his husband’s gaze until he’d taken his first bite, not wanting Draco to know just how sad the thought of returning Penny to the zoo made him.
“Your body,” Draco starts dramatically, “has no receptors for wetness. You rely on temperature cues to tell if something is wet or not.” He throws his arms wide, nearly sloshing tea over the rim of the mug.
“Are you happy?” Harry asked him, carrying him towards a beach blanket Draco hadn’t noticed him conjure earlier.
“What color are Draco’s eyes?” She asks immediately.
on a supplier gone rogue.
“You know how I take my tea.” He says softly “I don’t think I’ve ever told you.”
?” She asks, looking at him expectantly.
“From what I recall of that you also immediately started crying over his body, and snuck into the Hospital Wing multiple times to see him.” Ginny frowns at him, mouth twisting a little awkwardly. “I didn't like that much. Which was unfair to you I think.”
Harry’s jittery about Draco and his movie night all day on Sunday. He’s got cinema style buttery popcorn and muggle M&Ms to mix with it, as well as an assortment of sodas for them to choose from. He pulls out his DVD collection and waits eagerly for his floo to chime with Draco’s arrival.
He thinks about Draco post-Hogwarts. Growing out his hair through Auror training until one day it reminded him too much of Lucius and he’d chopped it all off. Painting his nails on the weekends. Getting a muggle tattoo to make his Mark his own, and several magical ones across his shoulders and down his sides.
“I'm not saying he’s not handsome
“Yes?” The innocent look on her face wouldn’t fool even the most junior Aurors on the force.
“Yes but you
“I’m keeping her. You can’t make me take her back.”
“I was going to say he’s a Death Eater, but whatever I guess.” Her lip curls, and she turns away from them and stalks back to her table, leaving Harry shocked at the continued nerve of perfect strangers and Draco standing frozen next to him.
Some nights Draco wakes up screaming, tasting the burning room of hidden things on his tongue and seeing Harry's limp body in Hagrid's arms. Harry crushes him to his chest, combs through his hair, and whispers to him until he calms down.
“You didn’t tell me you’d made that much progress.” He protests, setting his menu down to look at her across the formica table.
The bench seat the two of them were on rocked as Potter scrambled in Draco’s lap to wrap an arm around the blond’s neck and secure him in a headlock.
“I promise I won’t, please tell me.”
Think of the Devil, and he shall appear or something like that really - because who else is standing outside his lab but Draco Malfoy himself. He’s flanked by both Ron and Hermione, a smirk on his face. The twist of his lips is reminiscent of the sneer of their youths, but somehow softer. Harry quickly pushes that thought to the side. Malfoy taps his watch pointedly.
!” A very tipsy, very bubbly witch with dark hair says to him, stating the glaringly obvious while leaning much too far into his space.
They flew even higher, and Draco gasped as the shoreline of a very familiar island started to come into view. The crescent moon shape of Nantucket appeared out of the darkness, lit by the lighthouses at each of its points, the moon, and the millions of stars.
“Draco…”
“I've. I'm sorry. I've got to.” Draco doesn’t seem to know where to start.
“For sure what?” Harry demands.
“So do you. Worse, even.” Draco replies, slowly working his fingers into Harry's hair, stroking one of his temples.
“They basically had to rebuild your entire chest, love.” The endearment slips out before Harry can stop it, and he holds his breath as Draco’s eyes go wide.
is fine for just water, but makes tea taste funny.
Draco freezes.
“How did you even get it here?”
Draco eventually stepped out of the circle of Harry’s arms, pressed quick fingers to the top of Penny’s head, and waved his wand at the breakfast still warming on the hob. Two plates loaded with eggs, bacon, toast and the mushrooms he knew Harry loved floated over to the kitchen table, along with two mugs of tea, leaving the percolating coffee to sit on the counter and infuse the room with the smell of the morning. Harry slid Draco’s chair out to let him sit down, and then rounded the table to his own seat, settling Penny on his lap and looking down into her giant brown eyes.
Harry shut his eyes for a moment, processing the turn of events. He rubbed gentle circles into Draco’s thighs with his thumbs. When he opened his eyes, the platypus was still there, and Draco was starting to look anxious.
“I told you it was a surprise! Where are those grey skinny jeans you have with the fleece lining?”
“You didn’t mean it though.” Harry sighs “You have to mean it for an unforgivable to stick. If I’d waited just a second longer, maybe… I wouldn’t have hurt you.”
Harry laughed once again, and pulled Draco back down into another kiss, tightening his hold on Draco’s hips.
“Gin, no. It wasn’t like that.” Harry takes her hand across the table “I was probably being more unfair to you than the other way around.” He sighs “Do you really want an explanation, or just to heckle me?”
“Sirius’ bike? Yeah.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re wonderfully convincing.”
“Something else? What else could you have possibly done? I feel like I’ve done
Draco holds Harry through funeral after funeral that summer. He keeps Harry upright through speeches, memorials, and ministry events. In return, Harry props him up through interviews and
“The most common combination I saw was with grape jelly! But do you know what flavor of ice cream I couldn’t find? Even from Benjamin and Gerald?”
- augmented with some complicated biomagical component that decimates the clotting ability of blood. Anyone hit with it needs to seek near immediate medical attention or risk bleeding out within a few hours regardless of the size of the cut. That alone would be bad enough, but on top of it there’s a tricky suppressant element that makes it resistant to magimedical intervention. He’s shuddering to think of Ron or Susan Bones or even Malfoy being hit with it, when there’s a tap on the all glass door.
Draco Malfoy walks past their table in the ministry canteen and Harry cuts himself off mid-sentence. He tries valiantly to keep his head from rotating on his neck, eyes trained on the other man’s receding back, but all that results in is a full body turn as he tracks Malfoy's progress through the midday crowd.
“What were you doing?”
“Penny! Penny the platypus. That just rolls off the tongue doesn’t it!”
A few hours later the evening is winding down. They’re now four rounds in and Ron and Hermione have retreated into their own world. They’re still sitting there across the booth, but their conversation has reduced to mostly glances and some whispers, and Harry knows it won’t be long before they call it a night.
“He did. I swear to Merlin. The whole disappointed father routine.” Malf -- no Draco -- snickers again. “When those two have children it won’t be Hermione they’ll have to watch out for.”
“I asked Narcissa for some more details.”
“It’s beautiful…” Draco breathed, tightening his grip on Harry and pressing a kiss to his shoulder, hoping he would feel it through the leather.
“Yes yes” Ron waves his hand casually, “the details of your sexuality don’t matter now. What matters is that you’ve got it bad for Draco.”
“You know,” he called to Harry through the communication spell, “this is supposed to be a memorial to the first successful use of ether as an anesthetic for surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846.”
“Shush! Ron.” She cuts a glance at Harry, like she’s checking that he didn’t notice her intervention - as though he can’t clearly see her, and her aggressive elbowing.
“Nobody!”
“Since you were young, I know! I have someplace special we’re going to land!”
“How could there possibly be more?”
“Nothing. Absolutely nothing!” Harry underlines this point by taking his drink from Malfoy and downing a gulp.
“OH! No you do not.” Draco shakes his head, leaning over the table and into Harry’s space. “I know for a fact you forget to do magic. All. The. Time. Ron complains about it every time you wash dishes by hand when you go over to theirs.”
The Aurors try their damndest to recruit Harry. They try for Ron and Hermione and even Draco himself as well, but they want Harry.
Draco stared up at Harry like he thought he was particularly stupid.
Harry didn’t reply, still laughing as he used one of his feet to nudge the door to Draco’s room open. He stopped short in the doorway, taking in the catastrophe that was Draco’s closet strewn about the room.
Harry considers what the next couple of hours of his life are going to be composed of — Ron and Hermione will quickly retreat into their own world and he’ll be left with Malfoy for company. Malfoy, who gets steadily cuddlier as the evenings wear on. Whose long legs in fashionably tailored trousers draw Harry's eyes more and more easily the longer he looks. Who unties the chin-length top of his undercut on pub nights and let’s it float softly around his cheekbones. He shakes his head to clear it, and catches up to the other three as they reach the lifts.
“Yeah.” He says quietly. “Yeah.”
“Can I put it on you?”
Draco bit his lips at that, staring up at Harry with barely concealed mirth in his eyes. His shoulders shook slightly with his attempt to keep his laughter in.
“Oh, er. No thank you. I’m actually here with some friends…” Harry replies awkwardly, scanning the room to try and catch Ron or Hermione for help.
“Did he… say anything else?” He asks, once he’s cleared his throat.
.” Harry smirked, leaning into Draco’s space to press a soft kiss to his cheek. “You look lovely, but you are definitely overdressed.” He leaned back to grin at Draco.  “If you let me inside, maybe I can help you dress a little more er, appropriately?”
“Should we bring her back to the zoo tonight then?” he asked as he brushed a lock of Draco’s hair back behind his ear.
When they get to the door and he’s told her all he can, she thanks him quietly and slips inside. He's left standing in the hallway, outside a door he can’t enter. Hermione finds him half an hour later, which he thinks probably isn’t a good sign regarding Draco's health.
“The fuck do you mean we don’t need you!? Without the guitar it’s just a lot of percussion and me yelling!”
“I am not traumatizing the poor platypus that is currently in bed with us. No whining!”
So he does. Harry leans in slowly, watching for any sign of pain in Draco’s expression. He tilts Draco’s face toward him gently with the palm on his cheek. When they’re inches apart, he lets his eyes fall closed and softly presses their lips together.
He could practically hear Harry’s grin as he responded. “Good! There’s one more surprise I’ve got.”
“And you responded by blaming Teddy for your kidnapping it in the first place!”
Draco pressed his face into the side of Harry’s neck as Harry stepped over piles of shirts and slacks, before depositing Draco gently on his bed and stepping towards the closet.
. It’s
“Potter is it, now? Hi, Draco.”
“Draco!” Potter yelled, launching himself into the other boy’s lap. “Who are you talking to!?”
“I know,” Harry whispered, “she told me.”
“Of course.” Harry says affably. “What did you spend the day reading, then?”
,” Harry practically hissed, not wanting to move suddenly and anger the platypus.
“Let me call the Healer to get you something for the pain.” He goes to pull his wand, but Draco clings to his wrist pressing Harry’s palm to his cheek.
“Nine is great, yes!” Harry replies, a little too quickly he thinks, because Draco starts to shake with laughter. “Thank you for the tea! I should go, before it gets too late, tonight.” He stands, suddenly.
“You’ll see. We need to get going in a second anyway. Up you get.” Harry nudged Draco out of his lap, standing up himself and walking to the center of the room. He produced a muggle pencil with a very chewed looking eraser from a pocket somewhere in the interior of his jacket, and held one end out to Draco.
it,” he swore, kicking aside another rogue pile of shirts to leave the bedroom and let his boyfriend into the flat.
“He had to… he what?” The confusion is almost enough to make Draco stop crying, and then he remembers that Harry was dead and he starts all over again.
for the first time, and again when they’d gotten engaged, and yet a third time when they’d finally gotten married last year. Today he was getting some strange looks, but no one had attempted to dose him with
“Harry?”
“I was always watching him! You all gave me hell for it constantly!” Harry cries indignantly.
? This is
“What?!” Harry squawks indignantly.
Draco pushed himself up onto his elbows to hover above Harry, looking incredulous. Harry skimmed his fingers down Draco’s arms, attempting to keep a straight face as his husband squinted at him.
“Here’s the list.” Hermione pulls a piece of parchment out of a pocket in her robes, and hands it off to Ron.
“Just please don’t let this be a repeat of sixth year, mate. You don’t sleep enough as it is.” Ron does his best to look contrite when he says it, but the wide grin spreading across his face sort of ruins the effect.
“Hello, Harry!” Ginny says brightly as she sits down at their biweekly lunch together two days later. They’re somewhere in Portugal, because Ginny is doing some sort of press thing for the Harpies that involves hopping across Europe at high speeds and taking lots of intense-looking photos at famous landmarks and tourist attractions, both muggle and wix. He’s confused by the job, but appreciates the chance to travel to see her. He ought to leave England more on his own time.
“With that attitude maybe I won’t tell you.” Draco snarks, but the smile spreading across his face is a dead giveaway to his true delight at Harry’s asking to hear more.
“Why did you
“Oh, so now you’ll admit you’re talented?” Draco wheezed back. “In that case I think we’ll all just stay here.”
He pressed himself closer to Harry, angling his head to deepen the kiss, parting his lips and gasping when Harry licked into his mouth. He sucked Harry’s lower lip between his own, biting gently and soothing with his tongue when Harry moaned under him. He tried to pour all the love and adoration, and gratitude he felt for this ridiculous man into the kiss. Eventually they pulled apart and Harry’s eyes were blown wide, his mouth pink and soft.
“Not to overwhelm you further, but there’s more.”
“My facts are hardly terrifying, Potter.” Is all he says, but his smile and the way he squeezes Harry's hand tell him everything else.
Harry leans back against the couch cushions, trying not to be too disappointed. It's fine. He'll see Draco tomorrow morning.
Harry's sitting with Malfoy to his left, Ron and Hermione across from them. They’re a round in, and it’s Hermione's turn to buy.
“Salazar, Potter! Pull the other one.” Draco murmurs.
“Could you? Could you just explain to me how you’re dealing with the slashing curse you’re untangling?” Draco asks, looking shy and vulnerable over the hearth.
“I — okay, I guess. You’re sure?”
“He heard it in some muggle film we accidentally caught on the telly last night.” Hermione provides. “I was mostly asleep but he seems convinced they actually blew up an ice cream truck.” She shrugs and moves to follow her boyfriend.
“Well I’ve got no clue if platypuses are anything like crups, but she certainly seems happy. Thanks a bunch, Florian!”
“Draco?” he asked weakly.
“Of course, it sounds delicious.”
.” Minerva cleared her throat behind them.
“Er. What? How does this relate to…?” He catches himself before he finishes the sentence. He doesn’t want to just say it outright if she doesn’t know already.
“It’s… it’s a long story. I promise I'll tell it to you. Okay? Just… not right now. Please, please stop crying Draco, I promise I’m alright.” He pulls Draco impossibly closer, fists his hands in the back of Draco’s shirt.
“You know how they connect,” Draco accused.
“That I want to kiss you, and take you out to dinner, if you’ll let me.”
“Prat!” Harry called after him, “Bacon please!” He turned to the snuffling little platypus still curled up on his chest, and immediately redirected his eyes at the ceiling. If he didn’t want to get attached to her — fuck, it. If he didn’t want to get attached to it, he needed to spend as little time bonding with it as possible. But…it was very cute. And it had looked so very soft when Draco had been stroking it. Experimentally, Harry reached out to stroke the top of her head.
“It’s
“Draco you know we can’t keep it, right?”
“Don’t be dense Harry, it’s not attractive.” Ron replies with an eye roll. “I am very clearly talking about D-r-a-c-o.”
Draco commutes to Hogwarts every day to retake his sixth and seventh years, and to sit his NEWTs. Harry doesn’t bother. Instead he spends his time at The Burrow relearning to love cooking with Molly. Harry learns to blend muggle and magic techniques seamlessly. He takes over dinner nearly every night of the week. He finds renewed joy in hosting parties for their friends. He talks to Draco about opening a restaurant in Diagon Alley.
“Mate!” Ron is laughing, “I thought you still had issues with him! If I’d known it’s all cause you’re just uselessly gay… oh, Merlin…”
Harry stares at his best friend like he’s grown a second head, perhaps one belonging to a thestral at that. “Er… What?” He manages.
“Alright, alright. You win. Yes, sometimes I confuse cold for being wet. Where in the name of Merlin are you finding these facts anyway?” Harry longs to lean forward and tap Draco on the nose, but he controls himself.
Harry groans and drops his head to the table once again, straightening just in time for Malfoy to give him a weird look as he rejoins them.
bring up the thestral or the nifflers, you know we don’t really
“Alright, love?” He asks quietly, barely disturbing the air between them.
“That’s our destination.”
It's clear when Narcissa says his name that she’s expecting he’ll listen to her - even if he won’t listen to Lucius. And why would he? His own father invited a megalomaniacal would-be dictator into his home and made it so incredibly clear that Draco was just a bargaining chip in getting what he truly wanted - power. The universe will forgive Draco if he doesn’t exactly trust the man’s judgement. Perhaps Narcissa thinks her love is enough to sway him, but it wasn’t enough to protect him from Voldemort before and he’s under no delusions it will now.
.” Ron says, pointedly. “Please tell me that’s not what you’re thinking. Draco's still a pain in my arse sometimes, but he’s a good partner and a better person. He's changed since school.” He eyes Harry over his mostly empty pint glass, like he’s considering saying more.
“You were dead.” He repeats again, no louder than the first time.
The walk to the zoo was just as quiet as dinner was. If Draco could tell what Harry was thinking, he didn’t comment. He simply linked their fingers together and squeezed when Harry glanced over to him. Harry had Penny curled against his chest, and every time he looked down into her big eyes, he felt his heart squeeze a bit tighter.
Hermione rushes forward, pressing a chipped coffee mug into his hand. Before he can question what it is he feels the familiar yank of a portkey behind his navel and they’re landing heavily in the lobby of St. Mungos.
“People were good today. I got a few weird looks, but practically no one approached me. Florian liked her.”
“Okay — do you remember a few months ago you mentioned coming to the States when you were a kid?”
“I suppose it’s only fair that we smuggle her back in the same way. I’ll be right back.”
“Harry? Are you ready to go to the zoo?” Draco called from the living room, just before he stepped back through the doorway.
“Be careful, please.'' Hermione replies. She's intimately familiar with what he’s working on, as she’s currently trying to track down it’s origins while he does the actual wand-on cursebreaking.
“What? What’s wrong? Harry
“How does this relate to Draco?” And there it is, she knows. “Don’t be thick, Harry. I know you’re actually very bright.” She smirks at him.
heard me refer to that snake-faced bastard as the Dark Lord?” Her scare quotes and huge eyes startle a laugh out of him.
“Half an hour? We’re over the open ocean!”
“Harry Potter! Just the man I was hoping to see today!” Florian gave him a once over, grinning broadly, before he noticed Penny. “And who is this little creature? You must have stopped over at the Menagerie today?”
“You are having me on!” Harry laughs. “There is no way that is true!”
“Alright then, here we go!”
He could see Granger’s shoes approach closer, but instead of complaining about the antics of the three of them, she simply sat on top of Weasley, pressing them all further into the floor.
“My brother and Hermione said you have something you want to tell me.” She says, her smile spreading.
“Don’t say anything - I know I’m overdressed,” Draco started, “but it would have helped if you’d told me
“I'm not.” Harry frowns.
“Draco… we’re wizards. We can just cast a notice-me-not and be done with it. Or use the cloak.”
“I need the healer in charge of Draco Malfoy.” He gasps out, “I know how they can stop the curse.”
“No. No. C'mere.” Potter touched his fingers lightly to Draco’s jaw. Draco bit the inside of his cheeks.
“Why do you have a platypus?”
“Never mind,” Harry said when Draco didn’t reply. He waved his hand and immediately the room seemed to brighten, the scent of ozone and cedar growing stronger as Draco’s entire wardrobe flew back into place, whipping their hair around their faces as though they were caught in a small tornado.
“No! Ah. I. No, nothing's wrong.” Draco replies, looking flustered and a little flushed even in the green light of floo fire.
again. Besides! When you’re not there all three of them spend the whole night flirting with one another - it’s gross.”
Harry tried to keep his face from falling. He knew they didn’t have what it would take to care for Penny. He didn’t know the first thing about platypus care, and she definitely couldn’t exist on a diet of scrambled eggs and ice cream from Fortescue’s. Draco had known what he was doing though, and Harry was starting to get attached.
They dipped low once more, flying past the Boston Symphony hall, the warm glow from the plate glass windows painting Harry bronze. They swept from the Hall to the skywalk, lifting higher and higher until the whole city appeared to sprawl below them, the darkness above making it appear that the stars had all fallen to earth.
and very little desire to find out.” Draco flails tiredly.
“And that’s another thing!” Ron exclaims “Why won’t you call him Draco?”
Harry felt the beginning of a laugh bubbling in his chest. “Do you mean Phineas and Ferb? The Disney cartoon you pretend not to watch with Teddy?”
“I suppose I’m not.”
“I found it last summer,” Harry started, flushing slightly, “when we were cleaning out Grimmauld? I know you can’t wear rings as a healer, and I know you stopped wearing the Malfoy one you had at Hogwarts, after…” He trailed off somewhat awkwardly.
“What do you have for me today Mr. Fortescue?” He asked, scratching absently at Penny’s back.
Harry simply rolled his eyes, and waved his hand a second time. The grey jeans he’d mentioned earlier, as well as one of Draco’s favorite black turtlenecks made their way out of the closet, followed by a bulky green and grey colorblocked hoodie that was technically Harry’s, and Draco’s dark leather chelsea boots.
Draco clears his throat. “I, ah. I couldn't sleep. And I was wondering if you’d want to talk? Or ah… talk to me, or at me? Or listen to me talk?? You don’t have to. I'm sorry.”
“You do realize you have to do the dishes for a week now, yes?” Draco asked when they’d landed.
Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco, delighting in the subtle flush that started up Draco’s neck. He grinned when it went from a delicate pink shade to a deep red as he ran his hands over his husband’s arse, and laughed when Draco buried his face against his neck when Harry squeezed.
“I thought you might like to have a connection to the other side of your family. It seemed…
Harry pulls his head out of the floo and a moment later steps into Draco’s flat. Draco leads him to the kitchen and pulls out two mismatched mugs.
desire though?” Harry cocks an eyebrow at Draco, who throws a pillow at him in reply.
“Er…” Harry starts.
“Was that okay? I thought it would be romantic..”
“Mmmm. I’ll have to be here at the appropriate time to try it someday then.” Draco hums, before going a soft shade of pink as he realizes the different ways his comment might be taken. Harry huffs a laugh to himself, thinking along what he hopes are similar lines.
Draco takes his hand. “Harry, I love you” he says, “but you simply need to be stopped.”
Instead of replying Harry pressed the fingers of one hand into the nape of Draco’s neck, and crushed their mouths together gracelessly. Draco froze, eyes wide.
“Yes, it’s nice to know your eyes work.” Draco snaps back at her.
Before he can consider what he’s doing, Harry’s talking. “Would you like to come to mine, tomorrow, after lunch at The Burrow, and we could watch one?” He finishes his tea to cover his burning face. When he looks up again, Draco is smiling.
to throw things at your guests.” Draco scoffs, but he picks up the popcorn and tosses it back at Harry as he does it, so there’s no real offense taken nor meant.
“I wouldn’t miss it.” Harry replies. “Come on, up you get.” He murmurs to Malfoy, gently pressing him out of the booth and towards the door. He doesn’t let himself think about how he wishes they were leaving together in a different context.
“Take the bet or don’t, Potter.”
“I had to…” Harry says softly “I didn't want to. But I had to. He had to kill the piece of himself that lived in me.”
- I mean... you should. Because they did. But now they don’t. Because I have it.”
“He's going to be okay. We were able to patch him up and stabilize him. He's on a course of blood replenishing potion and will need some quiet resting time.” She explains. “You can go in to see him, but please do your best to let him sleep, and Mr. Potter? Thank you. Without your research we might not have managed it.”
Draco looked around the car park - the sun was starting to set for real, golden light reflecting off Harry’s glasses, burnishing his hair nearly bronze.
“That’s alright, I’m fine, are you okay?”
The feral grin spreads across Ginny's face again. “Ron says you like how soft his hair is.” She laughs.
“I'm not obsessing.” Harry groans, but he turns his attention back to the plate in front of him anyway.
“No thank you - that’s just not natural looking.”
Harry laughed, the sound loud and joyous but still nearly lost to the waves.
“Oh sod it.” She says “Pansy is normal looking, and was the whole time we were at school.” She grimaces
“So there is
She laughs.
likes him very much.”
Harry smiles while he does it, grateful he’s no longer watching Draco Malfoy from a distance.
“What?!” Draco shot upright again, looking distraught. “But — for
He dove for his wand on the bed, casting a quick
“I haven’t got any Jasmine Green or Ginger Peach tea,” he says apologetically, “is Earl Grey alright?”
“I don’t want to ruin your evening. Please go spend the rest of it with Ron and Hermione. I’ll see you again soon.” Before Harry can reply, Draco is slipping away from him and out of the bar.
“Can I walk you home at least?” Harry asks a little desperately, realizing that the highlight of these nights hasn’t been the drinking in a while, it’s the quiet walks home with just Draco.
Everything about Florian was happy. Harry had increasingly fond memories of being thirteen, sitting outside Fortescue’s to do his summer homework, and tasting the different flavors Florian was trying in the shop. History of Magic had never been quite so fun as it was that summer. He still made an effort to stop in at least once a month to see what creation Florian had in the freezer for him.
likes him, does he?”
They use part of Lucius's — now Draco's — fortune to buy the space. Draco revels in the joy on Harry's face when he unlocks the door for the first time.
“Peanut butter and grape jelly! So I set myself to it and I think it’s turned out rather fantastic! Would you like a scoop?”
Draco jerked backwards, away from Potter’s hands, but it didn’t matter. Potter practically climbed into his lap, bracing himself against Draco’s shoulders for stability. He nearly toppled forward, and Draco automatically brought his hand up to Potter’s hip to steady him.
“So we all ought to stop shaking hands.” Harry chuckles softly, trying to stop another yawn.
“Like I’m the one performing the studies. I have no idea what scientists define as
They curled closer to one another, gazing up at the stars. Draco slipped his hands underneath Harry’s jacket, warming them against his chest. He laughed as Harry rolled onto his back pulling Draco on top of him, wrapping tight arms about Draco’s waist, pressing them together from chest to toes.
“Yes. But, Pansy is gorgeous, and how do I put this delicately...?” She frowns and tapers off, Harry frowns back.
“Not well then.” Ron laughs, “I thought for sure now that you’d admitted it...”
“Ah. Nothing, nothing. I shouldn't have said that. D’you hear that? I think Hermione's calling me.” He stares at a point somewhere to the left of Harry's head, refusing to meet his eye.
“We’re about halfway there. But I thought you might want to see without all the movement from the bike.”
Malfoy heads after her, leaving Harry to take a deep breath, and attempt to clear the clean slightly spicy scent of Malfoy from his lungs. As he trails along behind the other three he watches Malfoy pull up next to Hermione and strike up an easy conversation.
“Hurry up and catch me!” He ran forward racing towards the breaking surf, hearing Harry chasing after him.
a platypus from the zoo?”
“Thank Merlin. We’re going to need it. It's Draco. They’ve got him at St. Mungos” She says breathlessly.
wrote that poem?” He blurts out, unthinking.
“Where’s Draco? We need the guitar for this set.” Potter wrinkled his nose petulantly, long fingers plucking at the strings on his bass. “He’s never late like this.”
“I lied a little.” She says breathlessly, once they’re seated and looking over pages of Greek delicacies. “I also want to talk to you about the potions ring case. I think I have a lead on where they may have learned the
“Don’t start something you can’t finish, Potter.”
“Of course I’m serious, you git. Why do you think I’ve been sitting here holding your hand for the past twelve hours?” He lifts their joined hands and uses his other to brush off the tears slipping down Draco’s cheek.
“Behold,” Draco said grandly, swinging the furry creature up to cuddle it next to his face. “The platypus.”
Ron corners him that Sunday at The Burrow with a meaningful smirk. “So?” He asks, “How was Friday night?”
“Is she bothering you?” Draco asks in an undertone, watching Harry’s face closely.
“Are you talking to your Instagram followers about me again? Telling them all about how terrible I am?”
“Do you want to do the job?” Draco asks in reply, heart in his throat that Harry will say yes, will want to return to throwing himself head first into danger.
Despite Hermione’s claim that they already had their pub night for the week, Ron drags her to their usual booth at the Silver Newt on Friday night with minimal arm twisting. She does extract a promise to go back to the Drowsy Kelpie next week, as well as an agreement that they’ll do dinners like Wednesday’s more often, however.
“Okay. So.” Draco talks with his hands, animated yet loose and relaxed. “Scientists found that
“I do like him though! That’s the problem!” Harry bursts out.
“Why am I not surprised that this was the source of all that racket?”
People are pouring out of Hogwarts, and though he wants to sprint for Harry and never let him go again, everyone else but Ron and Hermione thinks he’s only just now had a change of heart. They don’t know that he’s worthy of Harry's attention in this moment. He watches, heart in his throat as Ron and Hermione reach Harry first, surrounding him in the hug he wants to be the one giving. Green eyes meet his from yards away though, and the look of relief on Harry's face is like the sun breaking over the horizon.
Draco picks up the bowl. “An interesting concoction you’ve got there, Potter.” He laughs, tossing a piece of popcorn into his mouth. Harry snags a handful and eats it out of his palm, leaning against the counter. The kernels are soft and fluffy, and the M&Ms pick up salt and butter, lending them a savory twist he finds addicting.
.” She huffs.
“The Princess Bride.” Harry chooses, immediately. “You’re going to love it, Draco. It’s got everything. Pirates and princesses and swordfights. Complicated wordplay and fantastic costumes. You’ll quote it for the rest of your life.” He pulls the DVD out and sets it on the coffee table. “But first. Popcorn. Come on to the kitchen.”
“No, I know. I wasn’t sure earlier. I am now though.” She nudges his menu back into his hands. “Pick something so we can go up and order and I’ll be able to tell you sooner.” She dives back into her own menu, humming over the merits of falafel versus chicken in her shawarma.
“I'm going to kill Ron and Hermione.” Harry mutters.
“Owww, ‘Minoe,” Ron complains “he’s got to know he’s doing it again at least.”
“Don’t.”
peanut butter. They eat it in ice cream and on sandwiches and even by the spoonful.”
“I thought it was my turn to cook tonight?”
Granger simply laughed above them, and Draco felt her shift as though settling in.
“Weird how? You’re dating Pansy.” He cuts her a glare across the table.
Draco lifted the necklace out of the box, moving to examine the ring more closely. A tiny skull with black gemstones for eyes winked at him in the moonlight, surrounded by two raven wings, one on each side. Below the lower jaw of the skull, a curling banner with a cursive B rested. It was clearly a Black family heirloom, one that had been taken very good care of. He raised his eyes to Harry’s expectant face.
Not because he doesn’t love his friends! Not even because Malfoy is going to be there. Okay. It is because Malfoy is going to be there but not for the reason everyone might think, he swears! He’s got no issues with Malfoy! And that might be the problem right there.
“First of all,” Ginny starts, “I was eleven. I was so in awe of you I could hardly speak to you, let alone write you a poem to be read in front of everyone.” Harry nods, because that does actually make a lot of sense.
Harry laughed as he shut the door behind him, heading out into the crisp air with Penny flopped over his shoulder. He stopped at Quality Quidditch first, picking up some new tins of broom polish and maintenance kits to keep the school issue brooms serviced, before heading into Flourish and Blotts to pick up the new cookbook he’d pre- ordered last month. He stopped by Luna’s boutique, picking up some chunks of aventurine to hand out to particularly broom-shy students.
.” Her eyes shine with triumph, and Harry is momentarily distracted from the press of Draco’s knee against his own.
Wednesday night Ron and Hermione drag them out to a proper dinner. Hermione claims they’re all adults and should behave as such.
Friday. Pub night. Something Harry's steadily been dreading more and more the past several weeks.
“There’s no need to be rude. Besides, you’re -” She starts, looking offended.
Draco grimaced. Harry knew how much he hated the karaoke night with the four of them since he’d been banned from singing Britney Spears after a frankly horrifying rendition of
“Anytime! Bring Draco with you next time, I’ll work up something you’ll both like!”
“It was a present from Ginny. It’s delicious, but better for the morning than this late at night I think.” Harry pulls out two mugs and sets the kettle to boiling after filling it the muggle way. He always feels that an
Draco turned in the circle of Harry’s arms until they were nose to nose.
Harry didn’t respond, checking his watch and making a face. He crossed the room, dropped a kiss on Draco’s cheek, and made for the door.
Penny shuffled on his chest and he reached out to rest a steadying hand on her back. He could smell frying eggs and bacon wafting from the kitchen, and Draco had started their pour over coffee, despite the fact that neither of them particularly enjoyed drinking it.
Minutes later he’s walking towards the operating room they’re treating Draco in, frantically explaining his work to a healer in eye-wateringly green robes. He doesn’t know her name.
“She is very likeable.” Draco paused, searching Harry’s face. “I was thinking though, while you were out. You’re probably right. I don’t think we’re equipped to take care of her.”
About twenty minutes later, he noticed a blinking light in the distance, seemingly directly in their path. He pressed himself further against Harry and called to him through the communication spell.
“Potter - what?”
Harry’s not laughing now.
“Harry…. What is this?”
“As thrilling of an outcome as this is, I’m fairly certain both of you would be more useful in rehearsal at this moment.”
“You’re Draco Malfoy!” The witch cries, again making a brilliant deduction.
Which is ridiculous of course - he can’t be in love with Draco. They hardly really know each other. They’ve only just started spending time together without Ron and Hermione around, escorting Draco home when he’s drunk on pub nights doesnt count. But that isn’t entirely true either is it? They’ve known each other since they were eleven. They’ve put up with a decade and a half of each other. They’ve gone from a petty schoolyard rivalry, to active antagonism, to mutual toleration, to tentative friendship, to whatever this is. So it very much could be love, at least on Harry’s part. But he’ll never know if he never does anything about it.
“Call me Harry. You call Ron and Hermione by their names, and they call you Draco. You should call me Harry.” Harry doubles down, realizing that somewhere over the course of the evening he’s finally started thinking of Draco as
Harry looked him up and down once from the threshold, and Draco fidgeted, knowing he was definitely overdressed. Harry was wearing a worn pair of black jeans, heavy Doc Martens, a cream colored cable knit sweater, and the leather jacket he’d found in his godfather’s closet when they’d cleaned out Grimmauld Place together last summer. He looked positively cozy, standing on Draco’s front balcony in the autumn air, the wind ruffling his curls, moonlight glinting off his gold wire-rimmed glasses.
“Harry,” Draco breathed in, “this is the best date I’ve ever been on.” He tightened his grip on Harry once more, as though they could possibly get any closer, plastered to Harry’s back as he was.
“Yes?” He asks, closing his book and giving his boyfriend his full attention.
“Don’t say it.”
Harry laughs. “I won’t then. Can I ask about your day anyway?”
“Go on.” He says, once he’s back under control.
“Hi, Harry.”
“Okay,” Harry starts, “all job talk is off limits for the rest of the night. Tell me something interesting from one of those muggle science books you’re always reading.” He stifles a yawn with one hand.
“But what if we were prepared to take care of her.”
“I’m not sure why you insist on dragging me along when I’m not even allowed to participate.”
Draco leaned in, pressing kisses to Harry’s cheeks, his nose, anywhere he could reach on his boyfriend’s face.
Draco’s room looked like a tornado had gone through it.  He had
Approximately thirty minutes later they’re sitting in front of piles of seasoned curly fries, sparkling waters, and their entrees. Harry’s particularly excited for the gyro he ordered, when Hermione starts in.
“It was too late by then anyway.” He laughs a little painfully. “I think at that point we were both set on the paths we took - he had to do what he did or Voldemort would kill him, I had to do what I was doing or Voldemort would kill us all. Not exactly a romantic set up.” He sighs. “I still wish I'd been better in that bathroom though. Things might be different now.”
curses though.” Harry laughs quietly. “I won’t survive a third go around of this.”
“If you didn’t… then. Who? Malfoy said…” At that, Ginny puts her face in her hands.
Ron snorts. Hermione sighs and shakes her head.
Harry smirked at that, before flipping the two of them — careful to turn away from the platypus — ending pressed on top of Draco from hips to chest.  Draco gasped, and Harry took the opportunity to kiss him hard, licking into his mouth and squeezing his wrists tighter. That is, until he felt the strange sensation of small webbed feet on his side. In the tussle, he had failed to check where the platypus was.
“I thought of them, I won't lie to you. But Draco, I thought of you too, and you don’t need to say goodbye. I'm never going anywhere again. I swear, Draco, I promise.” Harry’s nearly too quiet to hear.
He spun in place, looking for something at least
“What?! Of course not! Are we forgetting the part where I nearly killed him in sixth year?” Harry sputters, and then wishes he hadn’t brought it up as all the air is sucked out of his chest.
Harry wheeled the bike around, pointing towards the Harbor and the Atlantic beyond. Draco stared off into the vanishing horizon, wondering what Harry was planning. He kicked the bike into gear and they sped forward into the darkness, the city falling away behind them. They passed over the Harbor again, and flew past Logan Airport, soaring out over the open ocean. Draco thought they would have stopped once they were further out to look back at the lights of the city from a distance, but Harry flew on.
Harry tried to hold in a laugh, not wanting to cut off Florian and have to explain that most people, muggle or wix, tended to enjoy peanut butter.
Harry flushed at that. He ducked his head and scratched the back of his neck, grinning sheepishly.
Harry frowns, but picks up his own menu and considers what it is he wants to eat. Draco is a solid distraction next to him, warm and inviting. He presses his knee slightly harder against Draco’s and thrills slightly when he receives a response in turn.
“Speaking of…” Hermione pipes up, a fondly amused look on her face “our lunch is over in five minutes, so if you’re planning on finishing that treacle tart, it might be a good time to stop obsessing over Draco for just a bit.”
“They have a pet platypus,” Draco mumbled against Harry’s collarbone. “His name is Perry and he’s a secret agent, and
He settled Draco’s palm back against his chest and revved the bike, taking off again, but at a slightly more sedate pace. They lifted incrementally higher above the waves, until Draco felt as though they were flying amongst the stars instead of beneath them. The darkness below seemed infinite, even as the moon lit the water, turning the whitecaps silvery, and making the spray glitter in the air.
Harry lets himself relax against Draco’s shoulder and enjoy the company of his best friends. All of them, he realizes, as Draco has fit himself squarely into that category at some point over the past several years. He isn’t just some bloke that Harry gets drinks with, or his best friend’s Auror partner. He’s an integral part of Harry’s life, and he’s hoping Draco will stick around for a long time.
“Where are we?” he asked, looking for a familiar street sign, landmark, or anything really.
“Hi,” he whispered, brushing the tip of his nose across Draco’s.
Draco stepped to where Harry was, reaching for his hand and the pencil at the same time. As he touched it, it slowly began to heat and vibrate, and Draco felt the familiar yanking sensation behind his navel, before they were spinning through space and time, landing with a thump in a car park Draco didn’t recognize.
“Happy anniversary to you too,
“Where is he? Where’s Draco?” Harry gasps out as soon as he has his breath.
“Oh, no. Er, phish, with a ph. It’s a Ben and Jerry’s flavor.”
Draco huffed and bit back a smile of his own. “I thought you were taking me somewhere, you can undress me any regular Tuesday night you know.”
They’re in a new place this evening. Hermione wanted to try the cocktails in a bar off the new Horizont Alley, an offshoot of Diagon built after the war. It's called the Drowsy Kelpie and the lights are low, the music pleasant, and the seats comfortable. It’s a much nicer place than their usual booth at the Silver Newt.
“I’ve got some crup cups if you’d think she’d like one,” he offered, grinning.
“So, why did you steal a platypus from the zoo?”
“And now we’re in Boston.”
“I can't say I understand it, Harry. It’s better than assuming he’s up to something all the time, but you have to admit it’s sort of an odd development, don’t you?” She points a piece of naan in his direction.
Once Draco had magiced the last of the dishes into the sink, he picked up Penny and carried her off deeper into the house, leaving Harry to stand in the kitchen and consider if there was a way to convince Draco to let Penny stay a day or two longer.
“Silver,” He says without hesitation, “but knowing that doesn’t mean anything. I haven’t seen Nott since we were eighteen. I see Draco almost every day.”
Draco squinted at that once again. His brain clearly working through how Harry could possibly know that, but not have connected the dots himself. Harry watched the wheels turn behind his eyes, anticipating the moment when Draco would figure him out.
“Perfect.”
“Alright…” Draco yawns himself, “Scientists did a study that found kissing is the least effective way to spread germs. Followed closely by…” he pauses to yawn again “coughing and sneezing. Touch is the most effective.”
. He looked around at the piles of clothing on his bed, desk and floor, wondering how it was that he could own so many shirts, and none of them could be acceptable for this date.
“Are we leaving London?” Draco twisted in Harry’s arms to look at him head on, trying hard not to pout.
“In Boston.”
Florian vanished behind the counter for a moment, reappearing with a chocolate dipped waffle cone. He topped the cone with two rather large scoops of ice cream, a marbled brilliant purple and rich gold, it was studded with chocolate chunks, and Penny snuffled towards it as Florian handed it to Harry.
“Okay people,” Ron claps, “let’s blow this popsicle stand. I need a pint.” He heads towards the exit, long legs easily pulling him ahead.
“Do you have a favorite in your collection?” Draco replies. “I’m not all too familiar with the muggle cinema.”
“Okay. You obviously learned
“That it was finally time to admit I wasn't your secret valentine-sending admirer in your second year at Hogwarts.” She looks at him pointedly.
“Are you cold?” Harry whispered, pulling Draco flush against his chest once again, and nuzzling into the side of his neck.
Harry chokes on his pint. “Er,” he coughs, “both of those things did happen, yeah.”
“Everyone only watches to see you and Granger and Weasley - I’m just there. You could replace me with anyone else and it wouldn’t make a difference. In fact, you’d be better off for it.”
“I do too! Just… not that specific story!”
There were too many stars to even begin to make it out, and he was overwhelmed with the sight of the Milky Way glittering above him like so many diamonds in the sky.
“Of course we can.” Harry took one hand off the handlebars momentarily to take one of Draco’s hands in his own, lifting it to his lips and brushing a kiss across Draco’s cold knuckles.
“I — yes. So what have you discovered?”
!” The smile on his face breaks when he sees the frightened look on hers.
being manhandled by Draco, but Harry was unsure if that was just because he was inexperienced in reading platypus facial expressions.
Draco snorts, and presses a hand to his ribs after. “You’re a secret romantic aren’t you.” He huffs another quiet laugh and groans again. “Bloody hell what did they do to me? I feel like I’ve been mauled by a herd of hippogriffs.”
Harry grinned and tugged Draco into a tight hug. He felt Harry’s magic wash over him, the familiar warmth of crash protection charms and the spell that would let them communicate over the rush of the wind. Draco sighed as the smell of cedar and cypress washed over him, settling into his hoodie and clinging to his hair.
Draco frowned. “Fine. But when you can’t bear to leave her at the zoo because you’ve gotten attached, you have to do the dishes for a week.”
“Forget about us did you, Potter?”” Malfoy drawls, posh and infuriating and altogether too appealing for Harry's comfort, even inside the privacy of his own head.
“You’re actually serious about this…” He breathes, looking like he can hardly believe it. His eyes are wet, and Harry’s heart stutters in his chest.
Harry heads up to the bar to buy the first round - trying not to fixate on work. He’s still making slow progress on the
Harry started gently scratching Draco’s scalp, still working to hold back laughter as Draco burrowed further against him.
“I always wanted to jump off the lifeguard stand, but Mother was too scared I’d hurt myself.” He could hear Harry chasing after him, kicking up sand. “So I would wait until her back was turned and
- do not look at me like that
“Why do you know that?!” Harry called back.
Draco's smile looks a little like it hurts — but it’s blinding all the same. “I thought you’d never ask.” He whispers.
Draco blinks for a moment “Y’know Harry, this wasn’t the conversation I had in mind when I called.”
Draco stilled, tilted his head at Harry, and scratched the top of the platypus’ head gently. He considered the offer for a moment, before smiling in an almost predatory manner. Harry gulped.
“Fuck no.” Harry says shortly, and the iron band Draco felt squeezing about his lungs dissolves.
Ron splutters. “I - What?”
“Wait, what??” Harry’s lost the plot. He’s lost the thread of the conversation and he’s not entirely sure he wants to find it again.
“I? What are you saying…?” Harry asks faintly.
“Deal. If you can avoid getting emotionally attached and leave
“Malf.. sorry, Sorry. Habit. Draco? What’s the matter? Is something wrong?” He asks, feeling slightly panicked.
not talk about this when he could be back at any second?” Harry grumbles under his breath.
and he doesn’t really want to stop.
Harry says all of this as though he isn’t casually breaking Draco's heart with each word. Draco can’t respond. He can’t bring himself to move, or even breathe. The urge to sick up returns in full force.
“Go on then, what fact are you going to disturb me with this week?” Draco hands Harry a mug, and Harry fights off a blush when their fingertips touch.
“Then
“But it won’t take long, just one teensy tiny little drink. It’ll be fun.” The witch whines, batting her lashes and pouting at him.
“You know we can’t keep it. Right?” He didn’t want to disturb Draco’s peace, but the two of them were wholly unprepared to care for a wild animal. Well,
“Okay. Clearly the subtle approach is not working. Do you need a list?” Her evident frustration is tempered with fondness and amusement, and Harry can’t bring himself to get too annoyed with the situation. He nods, slowly.
Harry started the bike with a roar, and Draco tightened his grip. Harry set them into motion, and soon they were smoothly rising above the road, the noise of the bike quieting only slightly as they lifted into the sky. The sun burned the horizon gold and orange and pink; Draco stared out over the Boston Harbor towards the Atlantic, watching the waves roll in and grow smaller and smaller as they climbed. Eventually, Harry banked to the left, and sent them soaring into the city.
“You stop that, you tosser,” Draco grumbled from his spot against Harry’s chest. “You have a platypus on your shoulder, we are not traumatizing her with inappropriate behavior.”
“Hermione, that was a stroke of genius.” Ron says, sounding awestruck and a little more in love than he was a moment ago.
“I am not” Harry grumbles, “I’m a very useful gay. And I'm
“I hate this conversation. And I hate you. And I really hate Ron.” Harry mutters.
“If you can actually leave her at the zoo… I will —”
There's a dead body lying in the courtyard, but it’s not his boyfriend and really that’s a small miracle right there.
Pansy helps them market. Blaise finds them a liquor supplier. Luna cleanses the space before each big renovation. Ron and Hermione spend nearly as many evenings helping physically set up as Draco does.
.” Draco chokes out.
“You’re going to laugh at me.”
“I suppose it isn’t. Can we go now? Or do we need to wait for it to get darker?”
Dinner was a quiet affair overall. Draco knocked at his ankles a few times, and Harry did his best to meet it with a smile each time it happened. He knew he was going to lose the bet if he didn’t get ahold of himself, but he was starting to think that doing the dishes for a week might actually be worth keeping Penny around.
“Only that the staring has a bit of a different motivation.” She wriggles her eyebrows for emphasis.
He looked around, grip tightening on Harry’s hand. It was chillier than in London, despite the fact that the sun was only just dipping towards the horizon. He sunk his chin slightly into the neck of his sweater, grateful Harry pulled warmer clothes for him.
He jerked himself to the side and the two of them went toppling to the floor, Draco landing sprawled across Potter’s chest, hands braced on either side of Potter’s head.
“I like to own my media.” Harry laughs. “And you’ve got no idea what the difference is anyway, so there’s no reason to take such a haughty tone.” He tosses a piece of popcorn at Draco’s forehead as he settles on the opposite end of the couch.
“You sound like Penny,” Harry murmured into Draco’s hair, pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
“Er, no? She’s a platypus,” he scooped Penny down from her perch to hold her out to the witch. “Her name is Penny. You can pet her if you like?”
Harry slipped the pencil back into an unseen pocket, and took Draco’s hand into both of his own, brushing a gentle kiss across his knuckles.
They workshop the name until Draco thinks he might pull his hair out. Harry is never, ever naming their children — if they get that far.
Harry turned on his heel, spinning away from the confused looking witch, and stalked towards Fortescue’s. He was used to people being rude at this point, but it frustrated him to no end how easily others threw around terms like
“Of course Harry, we’ll see you at The Burrow on Sunday for lunch?” Hermione asks, giggling against Ron’s shoulder.
I would jump!” He clambered to the top of the stand, turning to find Harry standing several steps away, watching him with a wide smile.
“You said you —”
Harry leads the way to the kitchen. “I’ve got English Breakfast, Honey Chamomile, Peach Ginger, and Jasmine Green teas, which would you like?” He asks, pulling a chair out for Draco at the too-large-for-one-person kitchen table.
He closes his eyes and tries his best to picture Theodore Nott. He gets about as far as generic brown hair, and he thinks pale skin, before he recognizes it’s a futile exercise.
He looked electric - fingers clenched into the fabric of the curtain as though it was the thing that had wronged him.
“It’s one of the nicest things someone’s ever done for me. I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed.”
Harry laughed the whole way out into the Harbor, where they once again dipped low, brushing the surface with the tires, kicking up spray. Harry turned in lazy arcs, banking right and lifting them higher. Draco turned his head and looked towards the Boston skyline, gasping as it came alive in the darkness. Lights seemed to blink on one by one until the whole city was glowing before them, the Harbor lapping at the shore and the idling bike the only sounds audible for a long moment.
“Remember the fact about kissing I shared with you last week?” Draco laughs. “It’s more from that book.”
“Ron! Not here!” Harry feels his entire face heat up, “Literally everyone in this family can spell except maybe Victorie and she doesn’t even know who he is.”
“She’s just a platypus! She hasn’t done anything to you and here you are saying she’s not natural. Have you ever even seen a moon calf!? Now that’s not natural.”
Ron and Hermione exchange a look, the kind that Harry takes to mean they’re setting up some sort of silent bet about him, again. He dislikes the thought.
“So Ron tells me you don’t think Draco’s up to something.” She says with a falsely casual air.
“Liberated.” Draco’s voice was muffled against Harry’s throat, and his breath tickled.
Harry tumbled out of the windowsill gracelessly, dragging Draco behind him towards the practice room, laughing the whole way.
“I am not staring at Malfoy.” Harry says hotly - jaw tightening.
“Harry.” Harry says, without thinking.
Draco glared at him again, but sunk back down until he was resting fully on top of Harry again. Harry looked once more to the platypus, which seemed much the same, if a little closer than it had been previously. Harry chalked it up to the bed shifting as Draco moved around.
“Name or no she still has to go back to the zoo.”
“Draco, wait for me!”
“As much as I would love to do that for hours, we are working under a bit of time pressure.”
“Why did you even notice that?!” Ginny laughs.
“Oh Salazar,” Draco grinned at that, “you’re allowed to
“I don’t, I swear,” Harry lied. “Please tell me.”
“Draco, yes. Yes.” Harry replies, and then Draco turns to summon the bartender for another drink, and promptly slips off his stool after misjudging how far over he’d need to lean.
“That’s what the light is, yes!”
“You’re here. That’s more than enough.” Harry looked up at Draco so earnestly Draco felt his heart stutter in his chest. “Just one second, let me find it.” Harry went back to rummaging in the extended interior pockets of his jacket, eventually producing a long, thin box, wrapped in shiny green paper.
“Harry,” Draco turned partially to face him, pressing his nose into Harry’s pulse under his jaw, “you made one of my biggest childhood dreams come true, brought me back to my favorite summer holiday spot, and talked to my mother to make it all happen. This has been the most special night of my life.”
“I never said I thought he was cute!! Don’t! Oh Godric, why do I talk to you?” He asks.
“Go to karaoke night with Ron, Hermione, Pansy and me?”
“Show off,” Draco laughed as Harry turned to him, smirking.
“Not quite, but we still need to get you dressed.”
“Go! It's fine. Be safe, please?” Harry shoos him towards the floo, and Draco goes without hesitation. The fire crackles, Draco calls out his office address, and he’s gone.
The kiss seemed to go on for hours, but it was probably mere minutes.
He didn’t ask about the band. He didn’t ask about the group. Potter asked about himself. Draco leaned back, away from the other boy.
“Sorry Aunt Minerva, but Draco started it!” Potter managed to unsettle them all from on top of him, spilling Weasley and Granger into a heap on the floor, and finally releasing Draco from the headlock he’d been put in.
The platypus continued to appear unbothered by the conversation, and the squeezing.
Harry skimmed his hands up Draco’s sides, gently running them down Draco’s arms until he could disengage them from the platypus. Carefully, because he wasn’t entirely sure if he needed to be worried about venomous back claws, he removed the platypus from his husband’s arms, placing it to the side on the bed. For it’s part, the platypus seemed to be content to stay where it was put. Harry ran his hands up Draco’s back, pressing gently on his shoulder blades until he laid down on Harry’s chest. Once Draco had settled his face into Harry’s neck and Harry’d started carding his fingers through Draco’s hair, he asked again.
“I don’t think platypuses have particularly complicated conceptions of gender, and in absence of the venomous back claws, I’m assuming she’s a female. It’s better than you calling her ‘it’ all the time!”
“You’re not feeding her from the table.”
“Pretty much all the time.” She shrugs. “I think he only still uses Potter because he’s convinced it’ll make you more comfortable.”
“Okay, but platypi aren’t generally pets. Where did you get the platypus?”
“Go. Living room, or we’ll eat it all before we even get the movie on.” Harry nudges Draco towards the doorway, laughing when he puts up mock resistance and presses their shoulders together for a split second before moving.
“I'm not! I don't think Malfoy's up to something.” Harry feels his face heat and not for the first time he thanks the combination of low lighting and his own tanned skin for hiding his blush.
“Thank Merlin” is all he says, but he thinks ‘
It was a short walk, and before long they were standing in front of the locked front gate. Harry watched as Draco cast, whispering spells under his breath to unlock the gates and disable the security systems while they slipped into the zoo.
“Just open it.” Harry held the box out to him, and Draco took it, slowly undoing the spellotape holding the wrapping, so as not to ruin the paper. He held his breath as he revealed a midnight blue velvet necklace box, opening it to find a delicate silver chain, with a signet ring nestled on the center of it.
He presses their mouths together once more, firmer this time, before pulling away and resting his forehead against Draco’s.
When it comes right down to it it’s an easy choice. Voldemort is gloating, Harry's body is limp in Hagrid's arms, and neither love nor money will convince Draco to cross that courtyard and join the man who killed his boyfriend.
They blink at him, uncomprehending.
he’s fallen asleep on my shoulder and I've had to make sure he gets home safe!” Harry thunks his head down onto their table, unable to meet his best friend’s eyes.
“Oh! Well, muggles seem to simply
“Ironic how that one worked out then, isn’t it.” Hermione does laugh this time, gesturing to the photo of all of them from last New Years, Ginny and Pansy laughing with their arms around one another off to the side.
“Lead on, yeah.” Draco gets up from the table and follows Harry back to the living room, where they settle into opposite arm chairs.
Malfoy’s all angles and lines. Sharp jaw, long legs, thin nose. His haircut is asymmetrical, short on the sides and long on top, swept to the right. He’s long fingers and slightly-too-wide grey eyes, straight white teeth with canines just a bit too sharp.
“Hi, Draco. I sort of thought you might not answer.” He says, softly. “How are you doing?”
“You know that cartoon Luna told us about?” Draco said, almost too quietly for Harry to hear.
“I was thinking I might like to cook, professionally, I mean. There’s an open storefront near The Wheezes… and… I don't know. Maybe it’s silly.” Harry flushes and scratches the back of his neck.
Harry tentatively reaches up and brushes the pad of his thumb across Draco’s cheek. “I know that. And I know you do a dangerous job. But I’ve got a vested interest in seeing this through and you dying might make that difficult.”
“She’s Penny now?”
“Not here it isn’t, but trust me, you’ll appreciate the layers where we’re going.”
“Peanut butter a—“
Harry pulled up higher as it continued to get dark, and they sped towards the Harbor, flying over the Paul Revere House.
“Can we
“A portkey, yeah. C’mere.”
“I. How did you..?” he trails off, realizing he’s as good as admitted she’s right.
“I think we ought to, after dinner.”
“Is that…?”
It would help if he knew what they were
And if the two of them collapse into each other and cling for hours when they’re out of the public eye, it’s nobody’s business but theirs.
Harry's floo starts chiming around midnight on Saturday. He's pleasantly surprised, but more than slightly confused when Draco's face pops up in the flames.
“Of course not,” Draco sniffed, “I showed up dressed like a knock-off Bond villain… and… okay yes this is how I smuggled Penny out of the zoo.”
soft because every pub night for the last
“Not most of them.” Harry grumbles. “He stopped slicking his hair back when we were in third year.”
He slipped into Fortescue’s still holding Penny to his chest, but once they were inside he re-settled her onto his shoulder, smiling as she nosed her bill against his ear while she got comfortable. Florian was helping a harried looking couple with two young boys, who couldn’t seem to decide on a flavor. He waited until the family had walked past him, grinning as the boys pointed Penny out to their mothers in delight, before approaching the counter.
Draco pinched Harry’s side. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Potter,” he huffed, grinning into Harry’s collarbone.
“Nothing, Nothing” Ginny smiles again, swirling a glass of wine Harry could swear she didn’t have a second ago. “So tell me about how you didn’t want to snog Malfoy the entire time we were in school?”
Draco flushed at that, and stepped back to finally let Harry into the flat. Harry crowded him against the wall, kicking the door gently closed as he wound an arm around Draco’s waist and slid a hand into the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck. He leaned in until they were centimeters apart, his breath ghosting across Draco’s lips.
“The healer in charge of Draco Malfoy. NOW!” They startle into action, “Please…” he amends quietly.
They clean out Grimmauld Place. Draco takes a chunk of the wall out to remove Walburga and Harry spends weeks learning construction charms to rebuild it. They live with the hole in the meantime. Walburga screams when they burn her portrait during a bonfire with everyone they love present. They turn up the wireless to drown her out. They tear out wallpaper and cover themselves in as much paint as the walls. They polish the floors and dust the ceilings. Slowly but surely the house goes from a tomb, a wartime safe house, a hideout, to a shelter, a gathering place, a home.
for you tonight.”
Florian disappeared into the back before returning with a pink and white striped cup of vanilla ice cream. He put it on the counter in front of Penny, and the two of them watched as she shoved her bill into the cup and snarfed down the treat.
Saturday night Harry floos Draco’s flat on a whim and is met with the sight of Draco in flannel pajama bottoms and a loose t-shirt, clearly not expecting company.
“I meant it, you know.” They’re keeping their voices low — the only light in the room coming from the moon through the window.
“What?” He asks. “We’re using first names now. Is that really that shocking?” Ron’s jaw clicks closed.
articles about his role in the War. Harry keeps him going as Lucius is sent to Azkaban for life, as Narcissa is put under house arrest.
.” Harry all but growls at her, earning him a sharp look from both Hermione and Ron.
Harry frowned. “It’s not a difficult question, Draco.”
“If telling you won’t convince you maybe this will?”
“Fine. I might laugh. Now please explain why there is a platypus that you liberated from the zoo sitting in our bed.”
“I’m assuming you have something to tell us Hermione - and that you didn’t intend to simply grill Harry over his lack of progress publicly?” Draco drawls from his side. It sounds like an insult, and Harry wants to rise to it.
“Shoot.”
Hermione stifles a giggle, and Ron lets out a pained groan. Harry turns back to them, and his lunch, frowning at their reactions.
“You mean to tell me….” She says slowly, “that the entire time you and Draco were fighting in school, you were also thinking about snogging him senseless.” She looks calmer than Harry thinks she should given the circumstances. In fact she looks a little like she wants to burst out laughing.
Turning off the intercom, Harry pins down several threads of magic he’s managed to tease out from the larger knot with some precise charm work. He then contains the whole thing in a three layer stasis spell he modified himself last year for just these types of situations. Leaving volatile magic like this uncontained can be dangerous, even in the warded labs. He lets said wards down and exits the room to join the others, bringing them back up with a tap of his wand to the door. The stasis will hold until he’s back on Monday, but just in case it doesn’t… better safe than sorry.
“Harry…” he gasped, not fully believing his eyes.
he thinks, ‘
to wear before Harry knocked on his door. He dug through one of the piles until he produced a pair of his more casual black slacks, and a nice white button down. Casting a quick charm to rid them of wrinkles, he dressed and stepped in front of the mirror, frowning. He and Harry had very different definitions of
“No, just happy,” he whispered back, leaning fully against Harry.
Meeting people in public like this was always awkward. He was never sure if he was going to be propositioned in the street, begged for an autograph, or ranted at for simply daring to fall in love with Draco. All the options were uncomfortable, and he and Draco had a running tally on the fridge at home for which happened most often each month. February was particularly good for people trying to slip him love potions, and overwrought poetry. July seemed to bring out a rash of people asking him to sign various body parts. He thought about bolting before this witch could react to her discovery, but something about her expression kept him in place. He watched her eyes travel across his face to Penny on his shoulder.
“Hey! You can’t name it! That’s cheating!!”
, and Hermione had bad news about the last person brought to Mungos with injuries from it. He feels like a failure for not having it solved yet, but the years since Hogwarts have forced him to take a more measured approach to his work. No longer does he insist on running himself ragged and not sleeping until he’s finished a task. He knows the job will still be there on Monday, but it still bothers him to think that someone else might be hurt this weekend. He’s so lost in his head he doesn’t notice someone coming up next to him at the bar until it’s too late.
Draco laughs with him and squeezes his hand back. “Yes, please. This bloody hurts.”
“It’s not over yet,” Harry all but whispered back, taking them up into the air even higher, and angling back towards the city.
Harry put him down on the blanket before settling in himself. He pulled Draco against his chest, leaning them back until they were both staring up into the infinite fabric of stars above them.
Harry turns on the intercom in the lab with a flick of his wand.
“It will be nice to spend some time with one another outside of work that doesn’t involve getting absolutely plastered, you know.” She says, when the boys all roll their eyes.
“Honestly Harry, it’s going to take more than one drunk witch to ruin my self esteem.” Draco smiles at him. “I’ve just been taking the day to read, and I didn’t much feel like getting dressed. No need to worry your pretty little head over me.”
It’s slow, a first kiss that promises many more to follow. Steady and warm like a mug of Ginger Peach tea, or a late night conversation through the floo. As exciting as untangling a curse, or watching Draco react to a movie. Harry had thought that kissing Draco might consume him, burn him up from the inside out, but this is better.
“Harry, we don’t know the first thing about taking care of platypuses.”
Eventually Draco holds Harry's hand as they look up at his storefront a week before the much anticipated grand opening. Three years on from the worst event in their lives. ‘
“You said that already.”
“Harry…”
“Okay, so. Harry. Have you made any more progress on undoing the modifications on the
Harry did, in fact, laugh at that. “I wanted to know what you’d say! Trying to play it off on Teddy was clever, but not all that surprising.” He grabbed Draco’s wrists to keep Draco from whacking him again, and tried to lean up and capture Draco’s lips in a kiss. Draco leaned away from him, smirking.
“Harry! Put me down! I’m capable of walking three meters to my own bedroom!”
Harry sputters “I - it wasn’t - he was up to - I was right!!” he settles on eventually. “And besides,” he continues, frowning harder “we’re even friendly now - you more so than me, you’re partners!” He points an accusing finger in Ron's direction, and he at least has the decency to flush a little.
“Alright then. After dinner.” Harry reached up and ran a finger down Penny’s back, grinning at Draco as she wiggled in place and made a chattering sound at his touch.
“I wanted one! I already told you that.”
Draco is offered a junior teaching position at Hogwarts he can continue to commute to — a combination of Herbology and Potions. Harry makes him dinner in the mostly finished restaurant to celebrate and he thinks it might be the best date he’s ever been on.
“What?” Draco’s face twists in confusion.
“Good morning, love.” Smiling, he brought his hands to Draco’s hips and opened his eyes to — something furry, with a duck bill, inches from his nose.
Florian reached over and scratched her head.
“We’re smuggling a platypus back into the zoo, I’m not about to wear my
“Did she tell you what else I loved to do here?”
“Oh no, you’re not getting any kisses for that stunt.”
“I love you too, more than you know,” Harry replied, surging up to catch Draco’s lips in a kiss that lit him up from the inside out.
Harry sighed, rubbing his forehead.
“Am I happy? I’m more than happy. I’m so overwhelmed Harry, I don’t even know where to begin.”
“Get changed. I’m going to wait out there because if I get my hands on you now we will
“…You were dead.” He whispers, unable to make himself move.
it to Hogwarts our second year? Ron swears on Circe it happens but he also told me you and Hermione went back in time to break my cousin Sirius Black out of Ministry custody when we were thirteen, so I take nearly all of his school stories with a large grain of salt.”
“You caught me.”
“I didn’t realize you were sober enough to recall that story, but yes…”
Harry brought them lower so they were skimming the surface of the boat basin, the empty docks standing watch as Draco whooped and cried out. Harry lifted them higher as they circled Brant Point Lighthouse, swooping past the Coast Guard station and towards town. They flew through historic downtown, past closed tourist shops, past the Whaling Museum — peering into the windows to see the lit whale skeleton hanging exactly where Draco remembered it. They lifted higher as they soared towards Madaket. They passed the darkened Oldest House, flew over the Madaket Harbor, looped above the neighborhoods surrounding Hither Creek.
“Is it a lighthouse?”
“You don’t need me. You’d be just as good without me.”
“A valuable member of the Auror Force and one of the friends I mentioned I was here with? Yes, yes he is.” Harry cuts her off sharply, going to grab Draco’s wrist and thinking better of it at the last moment.
“Draco. Where did you get the platypus?”
“Of course that’s something you’d look up!”
“No.”
“I stared at you across the Great Hall for six years. I could probably make your favorite breakfast without even thinking about it.” Harry says offhandedly, and then it’s his turn to blush.
“You asked my mother… for more details… about the childhood vacations we took… that I told you about when I was drunk… and now we’re... ?” Draco said faintly.
He stayed in town a bit longer than was strictly necessary, watching people rush to and fro with Hogwarts supplies. He watched parents tote bags of school books as they followed behind excited children carrying their first animal companion and felt a pang of nostalgia for his own schooldays, at least the ones where he hadn’t been trying to escape a raging madman.
“This is a great help ‘Mione. We’ll start checking them out tomorrow.” He says, grabbing her hand and kissing her knuckles gently.
“I wanted to make this special. You’re special to me. I wanted tonight to reflect that.”
“We have to. We can do it tomorrow if you really absolutely refuse to do it today, but we can’t keep her.”
“Just humor me.” She says, so he does.
He thinks of Malfoy from back at Hogwarts. How he’d looked in his quidditch gear, wind whipping through his hair. Sending origami crane notes across classrooms to Harry in third year. Taunting Harry from up in a tree when they were fourteen. How even in sixth year when he’d looked tired and terrified there’d still been something interesting about him.
“... Cartoon? I’m not making the connection.”
“Oh!” Harry started, “That reminds me! I have something for you!”
“I. Er. I…” Harry abandons all pretense of focusing on his lunch and scratches the back of his neck.
name her — the zoo did. Good luck not getting attached!’ Quicker than Harry could blink, Draco had dropped Penny the Platypus onto his chest, and was sauntering out of their bedroom. “Do you want sausage or bacon with your eggs this morning?” he called over his shoulder, smirking.
He manages to start stroking Harry's hair again, only just resisting the urge to clutch Harry closer in horror.
“I don’t hate you. You’re an idiot if you think that.”
Draco follows him to the living room, and before he leaves, grabs one of Harry’s hands. “I hope you know what you’re doing here, Harry.” He says, seriously. “Tea on Saturdays twice is a coincidence, three times is a habit. I’ll have a new fact for you next week if you’re interested.”
“You’re always so tired when you get home from being mobbed in Diagon, I thought it would be nice if you didn’t have to cook.”
“You look like you’re convinced he’s
“Hi,” Harry said breathlessly.
“No no.” Draco says. “If you want to do it, I think it’s a good idea.”
Draco settles on what Harry has come to think of as his side of the room, even though he’s only been in Harry’s living room once before, on one end of the couch. He folds his long legs up below him and tucks his toes in between the couch cushions, placing the popcorn next to him, in easy reach. “So what’s this movie I’ll be quoting for the rest of my life?” He takes the DVD case from Harry while Harry slips the disk into the player. “And why are you still using DVDs? Hermione and Ron talk at length about the wonders of
“Draco?” she says, “would you accompany me to the bar? I have some questions for you about your case.”
“Er, yes?” Harry says, attempting to maintain a polite yet uninterested expression.
“And what about our fingerprints, hm? How do you propose we handle leaving behind
“That I always asked to see the lights as a child. She reminds me regularly. No one’s ever put this much effort into a date for me before, Harry.”
Potter frowned at that, hands reaching for Draco’s shoulders.
“Draco! Sorry to call so late but we’re needed! Robards has a lead and it’s time sensitive. Get your arse into the office!”
They make it through that first summer together. It fades into fall, and winter, and into spring of the next year, and they’re still together. Often, in the middle of it all, Draco will look at Harry and think ‘
“Oh but you certainly don’t hate Draco. Was all of that just pigtail pulling? The whole time?” Ginny grins at him again.
“I’m not going to get attached!”
Slowly, so as not to upset the platypus Harry shifted towards the side of the bed, dropping his legs over the side, and reaching up to cradle Penny in one arm. He stretched the other arm over his head, and headed towards the en suite bathroom to at least attempt to tame his bedhead. Slightly blurry bottle green eyes stared back at him, and he shuffled back to the night table to find his glasses, grimacing as the bags under his eyes and the mess on top of his head came into focus. He ran the hand unoccupied by Penny through his hair, which just had the effect of making it more of a mess. Penny blinked up at him and made the purring noise again, and he couldn’t help but run a gentle finger over her bill before scooping her onto his shoulder like a small, velvet lined sack of potatoes.
Harry makes a face. “Ew. Not really selling the kissing, are they?”
The platypus climbed onto his back, settling in and curling up like a cat. Harry froze where he was, staring down at Draco.
“Just trust me Draco, okay?”
“It only seems fair to use her name.”
When he does show up, it’s looking very casual in soft jeans and a green jumper Harry recognizes as Molly Weasley’s work. He’s not sure how he’s never noticed that Draco owns a Weasley jumper before. He considers that it might be due to the fact that he’s rarely seen Draco outside of his professional element, excepting the last couple of weeks. He looks cozy this way, soft. Harry wants to touch.
!” he finally cried, thumping a hand onto Harry’s chest. “You
“Why’re you calling so late, then?” Harry asks, and immediately feels like it’s the wrong thing to say. “Not that I'm unhappy to see you! I just. Figured you’d be in bed by now.” Smooth yes, great recovery Harry.
wild animal. They did have that thestral that had taken to Draco in the backyard, and there was a spot for Buckbeak when he sometimes showed up to visit Harry, and there was the family of nifflers living under the porch that neither of them had the heart to get rid of, even if they sometimes had to summon jewelry from the front yard. But those were magical animals that had mostly arrived by themselves! Not a zoo animal that was used to a standard of care Harry was certain the two of them could not provide.
Harry nearly fell out of Draco’s lap, scrambling to turn and face his aunt.
“I hope you’ve been practicing your household cleaning charms.”
“Fine. Liberating. But we can’t keep it. We’re not prepared to care for a wild animal. And
Hermione grabs menus from the counter, and drags the four of them towards a booth in the back.
“I’ve got no idea if she can even have ice cream, but she does seem interested,” Harry laughed, holding his cone away from Penny’s searching bill.
“I mean, this isn’t just any date.”
“Draco.” He whispers, “You’re not allowed to wake up yet. You need to rest. But you’ve got to wake up eventually, because I've not even gotten to kiss you yet. And I want to. I want to kiss you, and take you out to dinner, and laugh at your terrifyingly weird facts over tea on Saturday nights. And I want to do it for as long as you’ll let me.”
They were idling above the open Atlantic, white caps of waves breaking beneath them and drowning out the noise of the bike. High in the sky were millions and millions of stars, more stars than Draco had ever seen in his life. Wiltshire got dark, but nothing had prepared him for this sight. He leaned back, keeping a tight grip on Harry’s waist, and looked straight up, seeking out his constellation.
, Harry… listen. You don’t need to like him, I guess? But —“
They’re eating lunch in their shared office on Wednesday when Hermione brings that up.
“You make it sound so romantic, dear.”
“Doing what?” Harry asks, innocently enough - he thinks.
“I didn't even realize I was attracted to him until sixth year when Pansy was hanging all over him.” Harry starts. “I just… thought everyone thought he was pretty. And it’s not like I’d exactly been taught what bisexuality was before I turned seventeen.” He frowns. “I thought I just felt guilty and that maybe there was something else wrong with me, when I went to the Hospital Wing those times. It was never… Nothing ever...” He stops.
“Just hold on - it’ll take us a bit to get there.”
When breakfast was over both Harry and Draco got a start on their days. Draco had a couple more illustrations to finish for the latest children’s book he was working on, and Harry had some errands to run to get ready for the upcoming term at Hogwarts. He considered leaving Penny with Draco for the day, but once he’d settled her on his shoulder after dressing, he found he didn’t want to put her down. So errands in Diagon with a platypus it was.
“No! No. of course! Do you want to come through? Or…?” Harry trails off, scratching the back of his neck.
Harry sags in relief and lets Hermione lead him into Draco's room. Draco is lying quietly propped up against several pillows. He looks pale and drawn, but he’s definitely breathing. Harry fights the urge to run to him — forces himself to walk over slowly, to take Draco's hand gently.
Harry presses play on The Princess Bride and they’re swept up into the world of masked strangers, fantastical swordplay and dizzying intellect. Draco, as Harry predicted, loves it. He deflates at Wesley’s death, turning to Harry with sad eyes, and frowns when Harry refuses to give away twists before they happen. He laughs at the grandfather and the antics of Inigo and Fezzik. He cheers in all the right places, and when it’s finally over and the popcorn is gone, he looks at Harry, eyes shining with excitement, and Harry feels his chest go tight with something that feels a lot like it might be
Harry chuckles lowly, a humorless, punched out sound. “Yeah, well. I was dead. What's your excuse?”
“Is this what the surprise is?”
Draco looked about the room helplessly, not sure if he’d seen them in the midst of the chaos earlier.
“I think I’d like that very much. Does nine work for you, or is that too late?” He asks softly.
So Harry settles in next to the fireplace, and talks about untangling threads of magic, and Hermione’s wild hippogriff chase to find out where anyone else learned to cast a
now lies untangled and harmless in front of him. The strands of magic separated and accounted for, he taps the surface a few times and sends his report to supervisor Howitzer. Hermione is standing outside his door and he takes down the wards and lets her in.
“I may have... liberated... it? From the zoo?”
“Maybe call me Harry when I’m about to kiss you, yeah?”
Harry’s not sure who drifts off first. When they blink awake facing each other across the room in the early morning light, neither says anything. Harry makes two mugs of Ginger Peach tea.
Conversation resumes, but Harry's pretty checked out of it. At one point Malfoy heads to the loo, and Harry kicks Ron under the table.
soft. She was silky and velvety and she made the cutest little purring sound when he pressed his fingers into the fluff on her forehead. Harry snatched his hand back and bit his knuckles, wanting to continue petting the platypus on his chest but not wanting to lose the bet with his husband. Karaoke was fun, but it was miserable to watch Ron, Hermione, and Pansy all over one another, knowing the only person he wanted to be all over was at home without him.
“If I call you Harry, will you call me Draco?” Draco says softly, like he’s afraid the answer will be no.
Harry says it like it’s just something that happened. Like he hasn’t processed it. He probably hasn't.
“I have a platypus because I wanted a platypus. That’s why.” He squeezed the platypus slightly, as though worried Harry would try to take it from him.
“I know, Harry.” Ginny squeezes his hand again.
“Tell me,” Draco says, suddenly seeming
His strumming grew more anxious the longer it took for Draco to show up, until eventually he put down the bass, nodding apologetically to Granger and Weasley. “I’m gonna go find him. You two keep warming up.”
.” He complains one day. “They want me because of my name. Not because I'm particularly good at charms or potions or because I'll be good at the job.”
“Just checking the weather where we’re going. I wanted to make sure you wouldn’t need another jacket.” Harry pulled Draco into his lap, wrapping an arm around his waist and nosing at his pulse just under his jaw. “You smell good.”
“Doesn’t Teddy already have a stuffed Perry the Platypus doll?”
“I do,” Draco replied, now holding the platypus around its middle like Teddy did with his stuffed kelpie, and looking as though this was a perfectly normal state of affairs.
He goes back to the table and tells Ron and Hermione what happened. None of them much feel like drinking anymore, and they all leave soon after without ordering anything. Harry can’t help but wonder what Draco is doing all by himself.
“Well if it makes him happy I suppose that’s what matters.”
“Let me finish.” Draco glares at him sleepily, and Harry feels his heart skip a beat. “Less than 24 hours after the kissing, the mouth has completely swept out all the foreign bacteria, like the transfer never even happened.” He gestures grandly, the effect downplayed by the tired tilt of his body deeper into the armchair.
Draco tried to duck away from Potter’s arm, failed to escape in time, and found himself pressed against the side of Potter’s chest, heartbeat thumping in his ear.
“Oh! I’m so sorry sir,” a slight witch squeaked, stepping back herself to look up at him.
“Excuse me?”
Above them, the stars shone on, and the air filled with the sound of the waves.
“Er? No? You know I haven’t ‘Mione. I’d have told you.” He says, frowning at her.
Vaguely he wonders if this is how Harry had felt when Sirius died. He feels a bit like sicking up. He catches the end of a rousing speech Neville is delivering while limping forward, he prepares himself to fight. And then Harry launches himself from Hagrid's arms and Draco is screaming, and crying, and it’s chaos until it’s not.
“I like your mum. I think she’s got a bit of a soft spot for me.”
Harry’s face broke into a grin, but it stuttered when he registered Draco’s words.
“Jasmine Green sounds lovely, though i’m intrigued by the sound of the Ginger Peach.” Draco says, settling into the chair and resting his forearms on the table.
“Draco. This is serious, what do I
Draco turned to look at the receding skyline of Boston, growing smaller and smaller as they flew further away.
Harry groaned and flopped down onto the mattress next to his husband. “Draco…”
“On…?” Draco breathes. “You could have… oh, Harry. Your parents…”
They make dinners and lunches and breakfasts together, working in companionable silence. Sometimes Harry pulls Draco from what he's working on and spins him around the giant kitchen table in a slightly clumsy slow dance. There’s always enough for their friends to join them for a meal when they come by. Harry won’t eat grapefruit, but he always makes extra bacon.
forgein to you. You are friends with Hermione.”
“He really calls me Harry when he talks to you?” He asks, hoping against hope Hermione won’t notice. Of course, she’s the one who answers him.
“You’re not bothered by it? By my thing, I mean.” Harry asks.
?” Draco asked, looking concerned at Harry’s sudden lack of movement.
“Hm?” Draco looked up from his plate, a forkful of egg and mushroom halfway to his mouth.
. Despite this hardly being formal wear, it was probably too much for whatever secret Harry had planned. He was turning to start the whole process over when his mobile buzzed and the wards at his front door shivered, alerting him to Harry’s presence.
Draco laughed aloud as they sped back towards town, flying above the Atheneum, rushing over cobbled streets and sweeping down Main Street, streetlights blurring as they approached the Sound.
“Harry. Harry, don’t.” Draco says, sounding a little choked up himself. “I never would have taken your help back then. And I tried to
“Okay, Harry. I have a question for you. What color are Theodore Nott's eyes?” Ginny says it like a challenge.
“You don’t honestly think I’d be better off without you, do you?”
Draco isn’t in the next morning. Hermione says something about Ron and him being needed for raid prep, something happening at noon. Ron had left the house at 11:30 and hadn’t come back last night.
!” he whined, pouting at Harry’s back.
Harry laughs. “It’s a muggle saying, like… er. I don’t know if there’s a wix equivalent actually. It just means let’s get out of here.”
Harry sits with Draco, holding his hand, rubbing his thumb across his knuckles, brushing his hair off his face gently. Draco sleeps. Sometime around two am he blinks awake for the first time.
“Alright.” Draco whispers back, eyes sparkling.
“I was thinking…” He says one day, and Draco listens because even two years on there’s not much that excites Harry into doing something for himself.
“Reservations to keep?” Draco smirked at Harry, not letting go of his shoulders just yet.
“What do I get when I win?”
“Shut up, Harry.” He pouts and makes a grabby motion until Harry throws the pillow back. He settles in before continuing. “So they determined that
“What movie do you want to watch?” He asks, instead of running a gentle hand down Draco’s back. Despite what he thinks has been flirting lately, that seems awfully forward.
“I’m sorry.” Harry goes for a self deprecating smile, but if the twist of Draco’s face is any indication, he misses by a wide margin. “Would you like to come through so I can make it up to you with tea?”
“Very nice to see you two are getting on, yes, but will you three
Florian’s brow creased, “Draco’s eating fish food? That can’t be enjoyable.”
“She didn’t. What else did you do here?”
Potter whipped back the curtain to the windowed alcove Draco had secreted himself in, frowning at his sullen tone.
antidote, like on the worst days.
Draco clung to Harry and pressed his nose against the warmth of his back, breathing in Harry's scent as it mingled with the salty ocean breeze. He pressed his eyes shut tightly, and waited. A few moments later, Harry began to slow the bike. Draco was certain they hadn’t been flying long enough to have reached their mystery destination, but he opened his eyes to look around all the same.
. Harry had been distinctly cagey about the plan. He’d told Draco to dress warmly, but comfortably. Nothing fancy that he would be upset if it got ruined. That had not been reassuring. He’d refused to cave when Draco had pressed for further details, even when Draco had nibbled his ear and licked down the side of his neck, and done that
“It's just. Mate -“ Ron starts in, but a swift elbow in the ribs from Hermione cuts him off.
“Oh don’t be like that!” She kicks him under the table. “But Harry, you’ve gotta admit - it’s sort of weird.”
“Go on then,” Harry called to him, “or has it lost its appeal now that you’re older?” He was smirking, a subtle challenge in his green eyes.
Hermione merely cackles in response.

“Oh, I suppose we can stay a bit longer, if you insist.”
“Draco?” Potter called, wandering the halls. “Where are you? We need you for practice!”
“You could simply stop going to karaoke at any time.”

“Potter,” he whispers, “I don't think I can take much more of it watching them be so sickeningly sweet. Take me home, will you?”
“Generally speaking I just cast a warming charm before I sit down, because, you know, we’re wizards.” Harry jokes, feeling unbearable fondness for this melodramatic vault of strange science in front of him.
She took a large step backwards at that, scrunching her nose in disgust.
“Comfortable? Not too cold?”
“No. No I don’t.” Harry replies quickly, turning to Draco and trying to shake his head as minutely as possible.
exactly how the platypus connected!”
There's grief in the day, but joy as well. The great hall is full of people. Houses mix, students, and professors, and members of the Order of the Phoenix talk to one another in the easy way only joint survivors of horrible trauma can. The Weasley twins have a pile of first and second years surrounding them, enchanted by experimental fireworks from The Wheezes. One of them, fuck him if he knows which, is covered in glitter, and it rubs off on Draco when he’s yanked in for a roughshod hug.
“You have a platypus,” Harry said eventually, feeling as though his morning had taken a decidedly strange turn.
“Harry, what is taking you so long? Ron is going to expire from thirst.” He snarks, before noticing the witch in front of them, who is now staring openly from his left arm to Harry’s forehead. “Oh. Hello.” He says to her, surprised. “Harry, do you know this woman?”
“You know, I really thought spending my days risking my life for the public might make them like me a little more…” Draco’s tone aims for casual as he stares after the witch, but Harry can see that he’s trembling slightly.
Ron sighs, “To your
Molly Weasley is giving him a strange look, like she can see something in him no one else can, when Harry finally walks in. He locks eyes with Draco, and immediately walks back out of the hall, having spoken to absolutely no one. Draco follows without a backwards glance at Molly's knowing smile.
From the way his face was pressed into Potter’s chest, he had a great view of the door, and was therefore immediately aware of Minerva McGonagall’s presence, as indicated by the heavy leather boots she usually wore.
karaoke. I just like it more when you’re there.
“You were dead.” He cries again, and Harry keeps whispering promises against Draco’s chest, rocking him gently back and forth while he sobs.
“And you still have yet to take me up on it! You’ve known me for long enough now Harry, really.”
They leave soon after, Harry supporting Draco back to his flat like it’s any other pub night. This time however, he’s got to remind himself that his feet are on the ground, not on thin air.
“He didn’t!” Harry gasps eventually.
Harry woke with a start to a familiar, well-loved weight landing on his chest.
“Narcissa said —”
come to karaoke?”
“Why?”
“I’m fine! I bounced right off yo— oh! Oh! You’re Harry Potter!” Her voice practically rose an octave as she registered his scar.
“The British are coming! The British are coming!” Harry called through the comm link.
“Harry, come on. They'll tell us when we can see him. Please.” She pulls him to a waiting room, where Ron is sitting. The three of them sit in silence, one of them holding each of his hands, for what feels like hours. Eventually the same healer from before comes to find them.
“But I
“You look terrible,” Harry mumbles, tightening his grip around Draco's lower back.
“I have just one request.”
Draco blinked at that. “What do you mean, why do I have a platypus?”
“Like what? I'm not looking at you in any sort of way.” Harry asks.
“Don’t ask me — Hermione is a genius.”
and cursing himself, Merlin, and Morgana that he’d let the time get so far away from him. Harry was supposed to arrive in less than ten minutes and Draco was still standing around in his pants.
“Meant what?”
So he doesn’t listen. He doesn’t even really hear her. He's too busy trying not to choke on memories of wild black hair and sharp green eyes. His mind spins him back to the end of 5th year, everything about his life collapsing when Lucius went to Azkaban. Finding out he was the next Malfoy slated to be a death eater, going to Dumbledore and begging for help. Being told to do it anyway — to play the spy. Forging an uneasy truce with the Golden Trio which had slowly grown into real friendship. Sneaking from the Slytherin common room to Gryffindor tower, games of exploding snap and chess that turned steadily into late night conversations about fears and hopes and dreams. Falling asleep pressed against Harry from shoulder to thigh, first accidentally, then on purpose. The slow slide from rivals to unlikely friends to snogging in hallways and empty classrooms and in a four-poster with scarlet sheets.
“I’ve been doing research into muggle brands! These two men, Benjamin and Gerald, I think, have amassed quite a following!”
. She had his defense book from the same year, and in the back were detailed instructions on how to cast, and what the spell did, as well as how he developed it! The book was in the library during our fifth and sixth years. I managed to get a record of who checked it out from Madam Pince. There were only six names on it.” She finishes breathlessly.
“Er… living room?” Harry asks, absolutely wrong-footed.
Draco leans back out of his space. “I read,
“Yeah.” He shoots her a smile.
“Yes! I thought maybe having a real platypus around would be fun for
“What is that?”
“Evans,” he says another night “or James’ Place. The Wolf Den.”
“Would you like to come and have a drink with us? My friend’s getting married tomorrow and she’s just a
It takes a little over a year to get to opening.
“She’s an idiot. Let’s get Ron and Hermione and go somewhere else.” Harry does then touch Draco’s wrist, startling him into movement. “I hadn’t placed our orders yet. We’ll go over to the Kelpie. Hermione will be pleased.”
They head to the kitchen, and Harry uses a muggle microwave to pop two bags of cinema select popcorn that he picked up at Tesco’s earlier in the day. He pours them into a bowl, and dumps a whole bag of dark chocolate M&Ms in after, like he used to see Dudely do as a child. He was never allowed to try, and now he does it any time he watches a film. Draco prefers dark chocolate, so that’s what he got this time.
Harry nodded and grinned over his shoulder as he left Fortescue’s, resettling Penny onto his shoulder.
“Oof – maybe don’t crush the talent.” Potter wheezed out below him, the air whistling from his lungs in a steady stream.
“Because Parvati was very disappointed you didn’t dance with her, and Ron said you barely looked at Cho, or Cedric,” she says, emphasizing Cedric more than she needs to, “all night. Eyes glued to Draco the whole time. He’s pretty sure he heard you muttering something about vicars.”
.” Harry tries to smirk back, but he can feel the moment he loses control of his face and it spreads into a true grin. “I don’t have a lot of free time, and it’s not my fault I prefer movies to books.”

Harry kicks her under the table “You’re worse than Hermione! Why do I talk to any of you?”  He groans.
“I. No!” Harry exclaims “I wasn’t really thinking of snogging him until sixth year, when it seemed like Parkinson was… and by then I was dating Ginny so it didn’t really matter anyway.” He frowns at the memory of just how long it took him to identify the twist of jealousy that ran through him when he saw Pansy Parkinson playing with Draco’s hair on the train.
“I think you agreed to undress me a little earlier in the evening?” Draco asked, and Harry laughed below him.
“Draco?” he called. “I’m going out!”
He didn't even know Harry had gone to Voldemort. Didn’t know he’d walked into the forest alone. He'd not gotten to say goodbye.
“Er… hullo?” He clears his throat awkwardly.
Lifting off from the lagoon, Harry took them around the Ether Monument, slowing so Draco could get a good look at the statue head on.
Harry does his level best to not react to the wording. Draco's toasted, and Harry's feeling pretty buzzed himself. It doesn’t mean anything. All the same, he’s pretty ready to get home and into his own bed.
“Worth it. It’s not like you’re complaining.”
“You’re going to have to connect the two for me, love.”
“It’s more than okay, I just wasn’t expecting it.” Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, pressing kisses everywhere he could reach on Harry’s face.
“Second of all. When in my
On his side of the booth Malf — Draco — is pressed against him from hip to knee, his head on Harry's shoulder, just like he predicted.
