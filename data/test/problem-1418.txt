," He said the word with a dim sort of disdain. "is what I mean, but that would be difficult to pull off, given your dislike for each other, so civility should do as well. Now it wouldn't be entirely…comfortable for him, even then, but I'm certain elimination of much of the ill-feelings should be enough."
"Yeah, I...I guess so," Harry says. He's tracing a thumb over the scar on the back of his hand, remembers the way Draco used to brush his thumb over it. He feels it now, like a phantom touch. He's thinking, vaguely, about that day he told Draco about every one of his scars.
Harry looks over at Draco, takes in the light rise and fall of his chest, steadying down slow and soft. The silver eyes fixated up beyond the world, and the wind playing up his already wind-swept, snowy hair. His neck was flushed, running up to his jaw, to his cheeks, sweat glistening all over his skin in the moonlight. An edge of a smile played at his lips, contented and serene.
"They may be smarter than we know," Draco muses, with a huff. "That they achieve all of this without magic?"
really started to like the Slytherin, more than perhaps anyone should in such a short time when they had a bad history between them. It seemed to be the only plausible answer though. He forced himself to ask anyway, "Why me? Um, why—why with me?"
"A bit. I'm trying not to pick at it too much," he says. Draco is fingering the frayed corners, the thin, folded lines of the parchment at the top. "They look very worn."
Ginny quirks a small smile. She kisses his cheek. "Yeah. Might help you sleep a bit better. Goodnight, Harry."
Pansy breathes a sigh for composure. She has her eyes closed, her throat convulsing as she pushes down whatever she's feeling. In a low, almost trembling voice, "I can't ever see you like that again, do you understand? I don't—"
Harry could hardly hear himself in the bustle and noise, and it was hopeless to hope Malfoy would hear him either. Harry could hear many shouts of protest, and the person at the front of the line shot a seething glare at Malfoy cutting in rudely.
There in the bathroom, he closed the door behind him, stared at the mirror in front of him, his own face staring back. He was slightly flushed. He breathed, in and out, swallowed and let his head fall back.
Over the rest of the month, it became clear that Draco had no faith or hope in surviving at the end of this. He lived like he was dying. He quit his potions mastery classes. He had started to get all his financials in order, had arranged to write his will sometime in the future. He spent copious amounts of time with his mother and Andromeda and Teddy, wrote a lot of owls to Luna, and Harry tried not to let his heart grow heavy at the thought that Harry was not among these people, that he was, in fact, the last person Draco wanted to be around. He understood well why he wasn't.
The burst of laughter was surprising to Harry himself as much as it must have been to Malfoy. He bowed over the table, shoulders shaking mirthfully as his arms laid atop the glass surface. His hand shot up to his grinning mouth, shyly, as he looked up, which was just in time to see a split-second glimpse of Malfoy's own grin, before it wiped off quickly.
"Well, in case you haven't noticed, Ron, Harry's been quite obsessed with him since the year started. It's even worse than sixth year this time," Hermione pointed out casually from the study desk in the common room. Harry was about to protest her usage of the word 'obsessed' because Harry was absolutely
he would say, and ridiculous notes and drawings and reminders left in random places, and wild dancing under Christmas lights.
"As I always am," Draco drawls, nudging his shoulder, as if to make him smile. Harry does manage a small twitch, only because it's Draco. And they lapse into a momentary silence. Until, softly, "Don't try to leave me now, Harry, when I've been wanting you half of my life. And now I finally get to have you." Draco's throat bobs, a subtle sound that Harry only hears in this proximity. "Unless this is something that might… that might get in the way of you being happy with me."
Malfoy's lips twitched into a tiny, imperceptible smile, leaving as quick as it came, leaving Harry to wonder if he imagined it, but keeping the hat on just the same.
"It's okay," Ron says. "I know I get a bit hotheaded sometimes, but. You know. You're my best mate. I wouldn't have just...if you didn't feel that way for Gin anymore..."
Harry thinks, just for a second, of turning his head and doing something he can't acknowledge the thought of.
He was also fairly certain Malfoy often stared at Harry like he was the bane of his existence, when Harry wasn't noticing it. He'd caught those bored, half-fronded eyes fixed on him once, jaw supported by a hand. Harry's gaze had lowered before darting right back up to him, frowning, hand faltering around the knife he was lathering the cheese on his toast with. Malfoy had promptly sneered at him, hand moving out from under his head, turning away, leaving Harry to stare at his back.
He doesn't know how long he sits there, numbed, and when his eyes grow blurry. His body is feeling his grief before he is, because his chest is just hollow.
Harry keeps the coat around him all the way until they return to their dorms at night, the faint scent of Draco's cologne at the collar of his coat constant in the back of his senses. It follows him all throughout their journey to Honeydukes, then the pub for a couple of drinks, and then back to Hogwarts, the Eighth Year commons.
"In a bit," she said, touching his shoulder and following him to the kitchen, where the pan was wafting up smoke on the stove, the smell of tomato and curry spices filling the air. "Is Malfoy here?"
He tears himself away when Potter reaches his carriage, climbing up onto it. Draco turns and does the same.
They both stop. There's a tug at Harry's mouth, but he rolls it back, trying to duck his head to hide it until he catches the corner of Draco's lips twitching as well. They're looking at each other, and then there's a laugh breaking out of them at the same time, Harry still so desperately, horribly in love with the cresent moons of his cheeks and the light of his grey eyes, and they are almost,
At some point, Luna had made her way to him, smiling, pulling Draco in close by the shoulders. There was a very strange look on his face, when he held her back after a delayed second of astonishment, settling his chin to her shoulder.
Harry could do nothing but stare as Malfoy's head moved back to look at him, still in that painfully tender way, temple against his. His thumbs stroked over his very warm and flushed cheeks, and then ran down his chin once, index finger underneath in a light grip.
"It's really not, you disastrous wanker. You're only too used to your incompetent ways." Draco lets him go, patting his chest as he turns around, waving him along with a hand over his shoulder. The warmth of it lingers on Harry's chest. "Come along now, before we become any later."
Harry stood a little far behind him, hands pushed into his pockets. He looked at it for a moment, and then at Draco for the rest of it, at the shadowing of his cheekbones under a light above him, the silver of an eye framed by long lashes. He never quite understood what it meant to stay in the entirety of a moment, savour it, but he supposed it must be something like this, like watching Draco lose himself in paintings for ages.
In May, Harry goes to Cardiff to be there for Draco's graduation ceremony. It's there that he meets Pansy and Blaise. Through their house are framed, still pictures of the three of them, some old ones that Draco said his mother had owled over from the Manor, and some where they looked just the same as they do now, that can't have been older than a year or two. They seem to have travelled around to places, arms wrapped around each other for pictures. The camera is turned back on them, beach winds in their hair, grinning up at Harry. Places they went to in their summers, Draco tells him. It was good for him, to see the world a little more with his friends.
"About the dreams," Potter says, then, and Draco's hands go numb, his heart jolting painfully, kicking up towards a violent storm. "You dreamed of me."
At some point, Harry glanced over at Draco, having come back beside him, and found him completely outside of it. Without Teddy or Luna or Andromeda, he couldn't seem to look up from his own plate, pushing at the vegetables and chicken with the tip of his fork, seeming disinterested.
Draco's mouth closed, taken aback as he stared at him, as if he hadn't expected such easy acceptance. Then, a moment after, he looked away, the movement of his chest still a bit irregular.
Harry takes Draco to the Christmas dinner. Molly and Arthur talk to him, ask him questions about his studies, his future. Charlie asks him about his and Harry's relationship in school, and they give him the watered down version of their story without its impossible complications. Charlie tells them all about his boyfriend back in Romania, and Harry can see the way Draco straightens at this, listening closely. Harry knows what he grew up with, how hard it was to be himself there, and he understands, because grew up somewhere just like that too.
They watched Luna sidle up against Ginny, laying her head on her shoulder, George carrying Teddy on his shoulders to stand at the doorway of the kitchen, where a muffled conversation was taking place.
The morning after finds Harry at the stove, making breakfast. Draco comes in, fresh and clean, hair damp and a towel around the back of his neck.
to his tutor and then careened him off. Harry did, slow and uneven, almost entirely focused on the heat of Malfoy's hand.
Harry was the one that did, that swallowed as his head moved an inch closer, hesitantly, and upon seeing Draco staying right there, eyes dropping to Harry's mouth as his head angled into the hover of the kiss, Harry finally caught his mouth against his own, with a gentle force that drew Draco's head back. His palm settled gently on Draco's cheek, following after him, keeping him there.
"Let's just stay like this today," Harry whispered, one hand around the knuckles of Draco's, forehead against his. He wasn't ready to get up, and face life, and do anything other than stay in bed with Draco, reassuring himself of him.
All he could think about were the months they still had ahead of them, before the curse would break.
"Wait, you were serious?" Ron frowns, his head leaning over and his body against Hermione's to look at him properly. "You don't want to be an Auror anymore?"
It kept Harry half-awake at night, kept him floating back to the surface of lucidity every hour or two, and eventually every half an hour. By the time morning would come, he was left feeling as if he hadn't slept at all.
Hermione stares at him, takes a sip of her butterbeer. When she pulls it away from her lips, there's a foamy mustache. "It… it doesn't bother you at all, then?"
It occurs to him that Draco might just be embarrassed, and angry for it. In that case, Harry doesn't know what to do. He remembered wishing he'd come back after he'd left, the way the want tugged in his gut, but it hardly feels like Draco has at all when he won't even look at him unless Harry's imposing his presence on him.
Malfoy walked in front of him, pulled a chair back from under the table with one hand, the other in his pocket, and then paused. He stepped back.
"Ron," Harry said, and Ron stopped. He didn't want to hear that, anybody taking his side, trying to make him feel better. "It was my fault."
Malfoy's leg was shifting impatiently now. Harry was somewhat afraid he might end up reverting to his old self if they keep him waiting any longer.
Ron eyes Neville across the booth at The Three Broomsticks. "So you're sharing a room with Malfoy." He grimaces. "Er. How's that going?"
dot on the Marauders Map moved out of his dorm and to the kitchens where they were assigned to meet.
Malfoy came by every four days, just as discussed, always an hour after Harry got home on work days, because
For an unmoving moment, all he does is stare down at it, his mind distant, his eyes gritty and tired. Then, his hands raise, a hesitant hovering of his fingers. Finally lower down in a delicate brush over the fabric, the phantom of heat still left behind. There is a memory trying to make its way into his mind, and he is trying not to let it in.
It just hadn't mattered so much, then. Somehow it mattered now, in some way, seeing him here like this.
"Well. What kind of people they must be," he says, then, looking up at Harry. "Incapable of cherishing somebody like you."
"Not the worst roommate I've had," Neville says, with a shrug. He has a newfound, quiet sort of confidence about him these days. It shows in the way he speaks. "We don't really talk. He keeps to himself mostly, now, and keeps to his side. Obsessively tidy about it, too."
Potter's throat convulses, his eyes having gone hazy. It still haunts him, in some way, and that knowledge pulls taut in his chest, that he hasn't been safe, full of laughter and joy, all his life. That he was ever unloved and afraid and hurt, that he's eighteen and he had to save the world and lose too much as he did. That he
It's easy to follow the deep, harrowing ache of his own heart and grab Potter's hand out of his pocket, jostling it out into his own, pulling him along to the way of the staircases. Potter stumbles behind him, after him, by the suddenness of it all.
"I don't remember it," Draco tells him. A corner of his mouth turns up, though it quivers. "I don't even remember what they look like. Or their names. Anything about it. They're gone forever."
He was as terrified and hurt about it all as he was angry, that much Harry saw, in the moments his face was bare from the pain and fear.
Draco tosses him a glance, pausing. Then, a hum, affirmative and soft. He sits up, takes his shirt off.
" But the weight in his throat broke him off, his eyes beginning to burn, not quite certain of where the reasons for it ended, if it was really about the way the night had gone. If it was about something much more.
They ate some more in even more silence. Nearly a half an hour passed, and Malfoy had only just finished his first bowl of soup.
Harry raised an eyebrow, smiled a little, something softened and warm in his chest from the alcohol in his system. Draco didn't see it, pulling a swallow from his bottle. Something focused in the haze of his mind, his smile fading, and he was taking him in, only just aware that he was. He was outlining the raise of a cheekbone, the long lashes framing silvery-grey eyes. The full, rouge lips, closed small over the rim of a bottle.
, Harry thought to him, and smiled, when Draco's attention broke away from Arthur's story and he looked at him.
"Not really," Ginny says, in a small, somewhat quivering huff. "But you know me. I wouldn't have wanted you to push me."
They had to make a few more trips to St. Mungos, going through further diagnostics and tests to see if anything else showed up.
The whole thing with Cho Chang was an awkward disaster. She was wonderful, but Harry supposed they hadn't quite worked well together, and she wasn't in the best state of mind to be in a relationship after... after Cedric's death.
"Promise me you won't let this influence your decision?" Ginny had said, as they strolled through the Burrows' backyard. She waited for Harry's obliging nod, an exaggeratedly solemn jerk, before she continued. "I'd… try. You know. If there wasn't anything else? I can't imagine living like that. Stuck to someone all the time."
Christmas came around nearly two weeks later, and the party was, as with every year, held at the Burrows. The Malfoys were invited as well, both Draco and Narcissa, who Draco said was uncertain about it at first, but ultimately gave in to Andromeda's insistence.
" He cleared his throat, suddenly felt mortified. He plowed through anyway, trying to be as satisfactorily polite as he could be, because Draco had demanded it
"I read," Harry said, huffing at his smirk, and taking it for the teasing it was. "I read all my books before coming to Hogwarts. Picked up the habit again through Eighth Year. I was too busy trying not to get killed to have the time before that."
"Get off me!" Draco screamed, throwing his hand off, and Harry startled back a step, hand left hovering in the air. He was bowing back over again, both hands still tight around the edge of the desk, crying — Harry realised only then, with the soundless trembling of his shoulders, and then the hitched breaths, that he was crying.
Draco thinks he must have, just could never let himself put it into words, admit it so clearly. Not when he had a bigoted father he was desperate to please. Not when hating him was easier than letting himself be in love with him.
Potter's brows furrow. He shakes his head. "I'm not trying to bother you. I just… I didn't think I'd ever see you again after…" He stops, a flicker of something passing through his face. He clears his throat. "I just want to know how you're doing."
he is reminded. Potter, who is calm and comfort and still the only thing that makes even a bit of sense in a world that's grown a stranger to him, but who now also means to him everything that he will never have, who means to him all his love turned to grief, and the impossibility of a dream that hurts worse when he's already seen all that it could be.
On another night, Harry tells Draco about meeting Ron and Hermione. He listens from the other end of the Galleon, humming and interjecting with a comment or a repetition or a question occasionally, but he mostly sounds like he's verging on falling asleep.
Harry stills, surprised, and then relieved. There's a pause after, and he thinks Draco might be trying to compose his grief away, how it still lingers. "Now I have, or had, no doubt about my importance to them, but… with blood relations and people who are obligated to you, there's always a question of how much you'd really matter to them without it." His voice goes a little fainter, quieter, here, something perhaps hidden under the surface. "Not to say it means nothing at all, then. It matters. But I do believe it must mean something more if they choose you."
His smile fades, slowly, flickering out like a candle. A wisp of its smoke is left behind at his lips, still trying to hold.
"Come here," she says, drawing him up on the bed next to her by his hand. Draco follows her, settling in front of her.
Harry tugs at his tie, keeps trying to adjust it into trying to make it look more presentable in front of the mirror. Draco's leaning on the doorway, waiting.
He didn't bother running around much for their birthday tradition, so George caught him too easily, and Ron was feeble and awkward when he wiped a handful of cake down his face, clearly seeing Harry wasn't much in the mood.
"I was wandering around the castle. Saw you out here, so…" Potter steps forward, once, twice, the soil and leaves rustling under his trainers. When he's reached Draco, he lowers to sit beside him, pulls his knees up. His arms are still clutching the cloak to his chest. "What are you doing out here anyway?"
About five minutes later, on seeing no visible improvement, frantic and shaky still over every passing minute of a possibly wrong decision, and the thought of Malfoy's life leaving him with it, Harry began to stand up, pulling Malfoy's shirt down gently, running a hand over him to smooth it out.
Draco doesn't want to be his friend. He wants to kiss him. But he's spent years pretending he didn't want to, and perhaps he can pretend a little while longer, until for as long as this lasts, until they go their separate ways for the rest of their lives, seeing as he will not be remaining anywhere near this country once he's free to leave it. Potter is one persistent bastard, but his persistence had to have a limit. He would hardly follow him outside of Britain.
"For what it's worth, Potter," Malfoy had said quietly. "I'm glad you chose life. I know it hasn't been the best one, but you deserve to live long enough to make it better."
"I didn't know I did. But you," Harry trails off, laughs with his gaze trying to meet the grey of Draco's eyes, a little tremulous with nerves and fear and the way his breath sticks high in his throat like an ache. Draco does look at him, then. "God, you." He swallows hard, gaze coming back to rest on Draco's mouth, hunger unfurling at the core of him, pulling tight.
"He seems rather…" Narcissa continued, paused as if in search for an appropriate word, settled on, "strange... these days."
afford it, he stayed out a lot longer, wishing he could be free enough to stay out forever. He was tired of his house, seeing those walls, trying to stay close to another person
For a time after, Malfoy didn't bare his body in the light, only in the dark, and Harry never asked. Harry never asked either when Malfoy did, again, with his history hidden under glamours.
"You didn't tell her," Harry said. Draco ignored him, spinning with a step of each foot and walking towards the exit. Harry followed after him. "Did you tell anybody at all?"
When they were young, Draco would fold his notes into origami and send them flying in classes to see Harry smile at them. Stupid, silly things, ridiculous drawings, sarcastic quips and comments about certain classes, mainly History of Magic and Divination, that he'd think Harry would find funny.
"Hello," Harry said, hugged her tight. When he let go of her, he looked back to the fireplace. "Ron coming too?"
"Wait!" Potter exclaims. Draco does not. There's rustles and multiple thumps from behind him, Potter putting away everything in his hands on the closest aisle. "Malfoy!"
be in a relationship together at the same time. But surely it's a bit natural to feel a little out of place, sticking around with a couple. They bicker like an old married one, too, which admittedly is nothing new, but it can be head-ache inducing if it seems to be tenfold more intense after them getting together.
He was too quiet at first and had to say it again, louder. The abrupt silence that came over them, and the sudden turn of all the heads in the circle at him, was almost startling. It took him a few seconds to recover from that.
"I worry about you," Narcissa says, stroking his hair. Draco has found a newfound weakness for causing her trouble these days.
"Time to, er—to work some things out." Draco looks very much on the cusp of his patience, likely at his dawdling about, but seems to be reigning it in. Harry swallows. "I should have said something to you."
Malfoy hummed, his temple close to the side of his hair. His mouth was near his jaw. Harry could smell his fresh toothpaste. "It's just sex, you know. It doesn't have to mean anything."
By the third time it'd happened, Harry understood it was another symptom, even if it felt catastrophic and terrifying. The second time too, Harry had found Draco retching in the bathroom, gagging when there was nothing left, violently shaking against the wall after.
"It's not like that," Harry says. He doesn't know how to explain what it is that's keeping him from telling Ginny, and Ron, the strange fear and anxiety that he might just be on the verge of losing everything. "I don't know."
Elias didn't come by again until over a week later. He wanted answers. The puzzling shift in events of that night, he said, drove him mad. Harry didn't know what to tell him, couldn't say anything. To say he
When he got out of the room, Hermione and Ron were sitting there in the waiting chairs, Hermione's head on Ron's shoulder. They stood up when they saw him, and Harry pushed his hands in his pockets and looked down and kept walking. He didn't feel like he'd be able to speak, tell them anything, his brain so fuzzy and heavy and scattered. He saw Hermione try to follow him right as he walked past, Ron taking her hand, heard her saying Harry's name and him murmuring something to her.
Some old French song was playing from his vinyl record. Malfoy hadn't noticed Harry immediately. When he did, he straightened slightly, his brows twitching upward in an unfathomable expression, but then he'd taken one look at Harry and paused, abrupt and wide-eyed, before his face closed off.
Draco was cocking an eyebrow, meeting his gaze. He set his quill aside. He unknowingly had a blotch of ink on his jaw again, a small streak in his hair. Harry had just asked him what his patronus was.
When Potter finally shows up much too late for their studying session, he's on the verge of snapping, irritated, "Where the hell were you? I've been waiting—"
"I always thought you had a good relationship with your father." Harry didn't say that it was about the only human thing that he'd known of Lucius.
"It's just... it's interesting. I've been reading up on it." There's something strange about the way she sounds, her voice light and careful. Harry looks up at her. There's something strange about the way she's holding herself as well.  "I've read that the person the user craves is the one that features most in the dreams. And, more often than not, if there's a romantic one, then it's that person mostly. Not always. I suppose it depends on the person, and what they value most, but for loads of people, it'd be that person they'd spend a good part of their lives with."
It was when he got to the floo that he heard footsteps behind him. Draco had pulled his suit onto his shoulders again, folding his overcoat on his arm. Harry said a general goodbye to everybody, and the roar of a green fire took them home.
But in the weeks after, with this distance, there comes a sort of clarity; that Harry thinks about Draco much too often, even when he isn't here and he has no reason to. That he's never thought of another boy like this, the way he thinks of Draco, with such urgency and intensity. With so much of his heart pulled towards him.
Dudley swallowed again. "It started showing up when she was one. I was at my parents' with her, when I was just getting good with them again. They didn't want Olivia over. You can imagine they weren't exactly glad about us being teenage parents." He paused. "They screamed at her too, you know. Like they used to at you. When she moved one of her toys from one place to another. She was so fucking shaken, and I picked her up and got out of there and I never went back. Not until dad died, and mum got lonely enough that she was willing to do anything to have me back. But they were awful about her for years."
Harry got out of bed, feet planting into the floor, and went over to him. The window was large enough for them to sit together on the sill, with some space between their feet.
It's not all perfect, the way it seemed it was in the dreams by whatever Harry's read of them in the letters. There, it seemed like they never had bad days. But here they do. An upsetting thing at the school, an insolent parent — a rude patient for Harry, a case gone wrong. They have disagreements and conflict. Sometimes they get upset at the other, or go withdrawn and sulky. Sometimes they get snappy if they're both in a bad mood, in which case they both eventually separate into different rooms until they calm down. Harry gives Draco space until he's ready to talk about what happened, and Draco will silently come over and hold Harry if he is open to it, as preferred, and sort through stuff with him. If it's because of something the other person did, they try to work on it together and adjust. They make it work, and it's effort some days, but it's effort that's easy to put in when it comes from a place of love.
It's soft and tentative at first, all clinging and damp lips, Draco's upper lip between the closing of Harry's kiss. It isn't much different from kissing girls, not like Harry had thought it would be — only rougher lips, a stronger jaw under his hands, and it occurs to him that he knows this. He knows this already from a goodbye kiss next to a hospital bed. Except it wasn't quite like this, wasn't quite as raw and aching and sweet.
Harry doesn't wait to listen to the rest of it. He just turns around and runs. He runs out the commons, down all the stairs to the third floor corridor, towards the one-eyed witch with the secret passage that opened into Honeydukes.
"If that's so, then they're not good Mind-Healers, are they? And we don't need them. We're going to find you one that knows what they're doing, one that understands that your past doesn't define you." Harry brought their hands up and brushed his lips against Draco's knuckles. He smiled. "But I don't think anyone would ever refuse services to the Chosen One's boyfriend, you know."
"What if he wants to murder you and throw you into the lake?!" Ron exclaimed. Harry knew they both knew just how incapable Malfoy was of murder and violence of that degree, but he understood the sentiment. "If he does
Both of them seated, Harry sat awkwardly, not sure what to do now. This was... odd. Not bad, but just… odd. This hang-out was not normal, but then he supposed neither was Malfoy. He couldn't imagine taking Ron or Hermione out like this, not out of nowhere, anyway. Maybe both of them, at the same time, on some celebratory occasion, but being here alone with Malfoy, he felt like he was on a—
Narcissa nodded, slowly, like there was something she understood. The line of her throat shifted, subtly. "How… how many times?"
"You just got it even more now." Harry gestured a bit at his own jaw. "There's some here. And on your left cheek."
Potter's lips raise at a corner in a half-smile. Draco wants to ask what he's smiling about, but that would give away the fact that he's been looking at him this entire time.
So Harry tries to focus on other things in his life, tries his best to hold on to the understanding that Draco did what he needed to do to let go of something that was hurting him more than anything, and tries to let go himself, really, this time.
, I believe telling him of the true reality of the outcome would jeopardise, and make artificial, any attempts at creating a good marriage
Draco stares at him, wide-eyed. He blinks, breaking away when he must have seen Harry's nervousness. "You weren't supposed to read those," he mumbles. There is a faint flush on Draco's cheeks. He leans forward, his elbow on the table, rubbing at his brows in some self-soothing way. "They should have been incinerated the moment anybody else tried to touch them."
It was this, the second part of what he said, where laid the true meaning. Everything that had gone wrong in the alteration had led to this, this much he knew, but Harry had not been able to pinpoint what exactly led to Draco's life teetering on this knife's edge, why it hadn't been enough for the two of them to be on decent terms.
"Because it was given to me," Draco tells her. He lets that sink in for a moment, seeing her expression of moderate, controlled bewilderment. "What do you know of it?"
Draco swallowed. "Good. You wouldn't… you wouldn't deserve that at all," he said, his lips a sad slant. "It won't be quite painless before that though, for me."
His gaze dropped, following the line of Malfoy's throat, the fine skin there. Need pulsed at the pit of his gut, pulled in his chest, somewhere deeper. Shame drove it the other way, sick and tight.
Some of Draco's hair had gotten loose from his half-up, wavy tendrils falling at his temples, and his eyes looked more silver than they ever had, in this haze of inebriation, the warm lights of the burrow. He had taken his burgundy suit off, folded it over the arm of the sofa, left only in his trousers and black shirt.
Dudley told him, with a quieter hesitance, that he'd wanted to invite him for their wedding, but he didn't know where to find him, or if Harry would even accept it. The last part, he said with a nervous sort of laughter. Harry wasn't saying a lot back, and he supposed that did make him nervous.
"Woah, Mum." Ron's grabbing her by the shoulders. "Mum. Hey. Nothing's happening here. Think you're the one that might need to explain what in the world is happening
He thinks vaguely of Ginny, and how unnaturally little time they spend together now. There's so much going on in their lives, he supposes. He tries asking her to come out with him somewhere, but she always has plans, and sometimes she asks
Outside of class, he would sneak them into Harry's robes, or in between the pages of his Quidditch magazines to remind him of his homework or tests (a sketch of Harry running after a large circle labeled
The night after, he finds himself standing with one leg out the parapet of the balcony. He went away thinking of grey and dim walls, a wand over him, a weight on him. He comes back, suddenly, horribly awake, the wind cold and raw in his lungs, on his face. He remembers a voice saying his name shakily, another calmer voice speaking to him, pleading with him to come down,
But Draco's head turns away, just slightly, and his breath releases in an exhale, as if freed as soon as he wasn't looking into Harry's face.  "You don't even like boys."
Harry's hair is tied up in a bun today, loose curls at his temples. He is all black turtlenecks,old jeans, and brilliant green eyes behind glasses. And he is so bloody irritating, being all annoyingly sweet to children that fawn over him and flock to him like bloody pigeons—
It's his name. Just his name in a hushed voice. And then the voice registers in his mind and he stills, so still that all he can hear is the sound of winds, the sound of rustling leaves. The sound of soft kisses, of wild dancing and unbridled laughter.
Potter stays around with Draco and Luna until it's time for Quidditch practice, conversation branching out from the mundane into more, into past memories, into a sort of banter over each other's younger selves, carefully avoiding the uglier parts of history. At some point Draco had ended up shoving at him in his feigned annoyance, Potter making fun of him to Luna to the point of ridiculous impersonations, the two of them stupid and bickering to Luna's amusement.
And so a wall broke down in that way, in that putting their hands on each other started to feel less awkward when they've already had their hands everywhere there was to have on each other.
But Harry's head is full of him in the dead of nights, when it's no longer as easy to fall sleep because there is no voice on a coin next to his ear, a vivid awareness of his presence on the other side. And the strange, inexplicable comfort at times, of just being with him in silence or amidst words. His head is full of him—the most ridiculously mundane things. That one time he made Draco laugh harder than he ever has, and how carefree and beautiful he'd looked in that moment. The pin-dots at the corners of his lips. His drawings, tucked in a corner of his trunk, that Harry doesn't know why he keeps so carefully. Who he is with Luna, and that he is someone who stays awake into dead of nights to talk with Harry until they're asleep, who does oddly sweet little things like bring him sweets, his favourites in meals, leaves around funny drawings and notes for him, gives him his coat. That he is quiet in his strength and bravery. That Harry thinks often of the way he'd felt when Harry held him; warm, sharp planes of bones softened by skin, and how his hair smells like mint. How lovely he looked, laughing, with his winter hat and coat and scarf.
Draco was looking over the mess on his table, settling on a holder full of vials. He picked out one full of something faded and prussian blue.
He pulls Harry's hat onto his face, deliberately, and when the hat lifts back up onto Harry's messy hair, it clears his way to vision of the quirk of Draco's grin, crooked canines hooked over his lower lip. Harry doesn't know what he looks like, but it must be as ruffled and exasperated and fond, achingly fond, as he feels. He's certain much of the rest has slipped away, left behind only the warmth in his chest by the way Draco's smiling, all crescent-moon dimples on cheeks and one raised than the other, as he pushes Harry's hair up into his hat with his fingers. He pulls Harry in by the scarf, kisses him. He likes to do that, Harry's noticed too. He likes to take Harry's hands and warm them inside the pockets of his own coat, when Harry is cold and they're alone. Harry likes that too.
," Ron said, sitting back, putting his hands up with a laugh. "We heard you the first hundred times. We know."
There was always a sort of comfort in capturing fragments of time, especially when it all seemed to have gone by in such a quick haze. He looked back and could only remember anything by a picture, a video capturing a moment in motion, could see himself in all of them as he desperately tried to grasp at every fact and detail with his senses, his mind. His camera. Trying to store as much of Draco as possible. Trying to keep him in every way he could.
"But I'm sure you're aware that the work I do is not fitting to speak of in this setting," Draco says.
Sometimes Draco would ask him if he wanted a drink, and Harry would say yes. Sometimes he would settle beside Draco on the couch, on the very opposite end, and one night like this, they talked hours into the morning, eased by the warmth of alcohol and the loose tongue that came with fatigue and half-inebriation, and they learned more about each other than they ever had in the last year.
"You like this, don't you?" he says, pulling him by the hands a little away from the wireless playing a low song into the night, brilliant green eyes brighter with that sweet, crooked little grin as they stumbled a small step to a still, faces swaying too close. "Dancing? You said you did."
"I look for other people! Ginny—" There is a brief flash of something, a flicker of a curl at Draco's mouth. Harry feels the unease slither in under his skin, a memory breathing between them a bit louder. He glances away, down at his sandwich, throat convulsing around the pulse of his erratic heart, and tries to compose himself. "I, er... I search for Ron and Hermione on it if I want to find them, but sometimes I sort of wish I hadn't, because a lot of the times they're alone together in an abandoned classroom or a closet and it brings thoughts I'd much rather not—"
"Maybe we can still fix this." Harry unfolded his arms, rounded the counters, a hand coming to rest on the top as he came to a stop next to him. He was facing ahead of him, Harry facing him, and he must look as desperate as he feels. "Maybe we could do it better this time, and reverse it
" Harry said. He swallowed again, untangling himself to shift onto his back and face the ceiling, scrubbing a hand through his hair. "God. I've been so stupid."
Harry shrugged. "It just seems a bit stuffy in here, is all." He paused, and then cleared his throat. "I won't really mind if you… you can use the table if you want. Just leave me some space or something."
"I did. They took it much better than I thought, really," Harry says, and tells him the entire story of it.
"Potter," Draco says, slipping into that facade that hides exactly these feelings. He feels the need for it especially after the scene in class, Harry laughing in the corner, as lovely as it was exasperating when it was directed
"No?" Potter says, his dark brows drawing together. "I mean, I thought, after everything at St. Mungos…" After he'd spent months at Draco's bedside, keeping him sane. Potter leaves it at that, however, a bit awkwardly. It is a small mercy. Draco has no desire to think about
Harry's own words in his mouth, while Harry was choking horribly over him, still trembling from a vivid dream that had carved his love out of his life and left it grey. He was hearing it all from underwater, under that tsunami grief that had rattled through him in his sleep, only half out of it.
Hermione seems to understand what his confusion is about. "Time perception is skewed greatly in those dreams, you know. What's months here would be decades in the dream. It's a lot like... living another life."
Harry closed his eyes, breathed, slow, with all the roiling desperation of a man trying to breathe underwater. His hand was a tight fist over the counter. "I know you blame me and you're angry and it's difficult and I'm sorry, but will you please just let me
will be…" His eyes were distant, slightly hazed. The jut of his throat shifted, very subtly. "Maybe that will have to be enough."
He watches Potter leave for his classes from behind the statue of the knight, with his heart still in his throat, slow and erratic.
In the final chapter, Draco is given his verdict, a confiscation of much of his wealth and a probation period of six months. He apologizes to Hermione in the hospital for his past mistreatment of her, and after completely recovering from his physical injuries, he confesses his feelings to Harry and kisses him farewell.
At the hospital, after all the spells and diagnostics, Harry's head had begun to throb so much that he could barely pay attention to what was being said.
They'd thought, at first, that they could just grip each other's arms as a minor form of their necessitated contact, the tangle of it laid out on a surface. It was still awkward, but much less awkward. It was unsatisfactory in comparison, and even though they'd remained like that for an hour, Harry was left with a discontented sort of feeling, wondering if it was just him, but insisted to himself that it was far better this way.
"I don't know. That's what I'm supposed to be finding out when I go," Harry answered, sounding as frustrated as he felt.
The process of Mind-Healing won't be a focus in the story. I wanted to use it as a method for glimpsing into the way Draco feels after waking up.
"We're not," Harry said, coldly, cutting him off. He stood up, abrupt, the chair screeching backward. "We are
interested would be to give him false hopes for the future. To tell him the truth was unimaginable. He let the silence confirm what Elias believed, apologised around a lump in his throat. Elias never came back.
Harry looks at him, brows furrowed. "No, God no, Draco, I — I want to tell them about you," he says. He doesn't know how to tell him that it's not because it's him, not really. It's Harry, thinking of being locked inside of a cupboard, and how lonely and cold it was. He thinks about losing Ginny and Ron and the Weasleys and it feels a lot like that again. He wants to say,
Harry blinks, realizing the tension that's seeped into his body, inexplicably. He forces himself to relax. "I'm not. I just… you're bombarding me with all these questions, and it's catching me off guard. Just... what are you even trying to say anyway?"
generally considered stalking if you noticed that nearly the only thing your victim ate that year was caramel pudding."
"It means he will erase everything to do with his dreams," is all she says, but Harry understands what she doesn't say with the way she's looking at him.
It was then that he turned slightly, throwing a glance over his shoulder, and with it, it cleared the way of vision, and Harry could see a bit of himself, asleep on the bed underneath blankets.
"I'm going to take such good care of you," Draco whispered to him, hands featherlight on his cheeks.
"You're here early," Harry said, jostling Teddy a bit in his arms. "I thought you were going to have classes today?"
Harry listened to him breathe, for the longest time, trying very hard not to take his hand into his own.
"That could have actually happened," Potter says, huffing, and there's a twitch at a corner of his lips, and Draco loves him. He loves him with a ferocity so painful it may as well just be pain all on its own.
"It's our last year here, isn't it. I'll be visiting them all the time after school anyway. But a Christmas at Hogwarts, as a student — that won't happen again after this year."
On a Sunday afternoon, Bill dropped by, as Hermione had forewarned, but he dropped by without a firecall and at an extremely inopportune moment. They quickly jumped away from each other when they saw him there. Malfoy, standing a considerable distance away with his palms on his hips, burning his own mortified hole pointedly through the ground.
The first time the bond had begun to act up for Harry alone, he'd thought Draco must have been experiencing it as well in the exact same way. He had stumbled into the kitchen whilst Draco was in the midst of his private classes, both he and his tutor staring at him for a confused, blank moment.
Harry thought it would be a while before they get to this. But it's almost a relief, the prospect of getting it all out of the way, to make sense of their story together.
Harry realizes he's been staring at him, his gaze coming to rest on his lips for a split-second, before they dart away.
"Maybe one day," Ginny says into his chest. "When we both — " she laughs. "When we both have our shite together."
But then he thinks that maybe it wouldn't have worked, that it would have festered in him until he couldn't breathe, and he broke.
"You've been looking at him a lot today," Ginny's voice piped up, and when Harry turned, he saw her leaning close to his shoulder, hands folded behind her.
Draco told him. Then, the Roman Forum, all the ancient, architectural fragments of stone, leaving behind history. In the evening was a visit to the Colosseum, an oval-shaped amphitheatre lit up gold when the sky darkened.
Draco's face is that of somebody not understanding a thing, but still trying very hard to humour him. "And that is?"
Harry learns that Blaise works at a nearby pub. Pansy is a fashion designer for a clothing line. He is nervous to meet them, Pansy mostly, and it's only Draco's presence that calms him down any.
"I like seeing you like this," Harry finds himself saying, without thinking. His brain is woozy, somewhat afar, from slumber trying to creep into his body.
George, too, came by often to check on the two of them, and Ginny as soon as she could get her schedule cleared. So did Ron and Hermione, and Molly too, but most days they did not come upstairs, as if to not burden or disturb, and so Harry only knew by the handwriting on the notes reminding Harry to eat, take care of himself. Only noticed their house left cleaner than before, food always on their table under stasis, a replaced set of potions in the medicine cabinet for pain and malaise and nausea.
"I hardly think Healers would know anything," he said. "A curse-breaker seems more like the kind of person that could help."
He's staring at a spot on the floor, head swimming and hazy with drinks and dreams, firewhiskey in his system making everything dimmer, sharper, the yellow lights brighter, all at once. He inhales close-mouthed, heavy and slow, jaw set tight in a hardened knot of muscle.
"HARRY? OH THANK GOD—wait... what." Ron stared at him for a long moment. His face scrunched up. "Harry?"
had given him in a way he hadn't the first night, when he could only bring himself to touch him but not look at him properly.
"Were you watching me?" Harry asks, amused. His voice is rough, in a way that sounds annoyingly attractive. Draco flushes, flustered alongside his exasperation. Harry laughs, runs a hand down his back. The ink of a dragon wing. "Creep."
Draco comes to sit beside him against the wall, pulling his knees up, pressing his shoulder against Potter's. After a few seconds, he asks, "Something happened?"
A silence lapsed over them, then. He watched Draco and Luna, dancing together in a slow sway. His mind was running vaguely over her words a bit, unsettled, still frowning. He looked back at Ginny. She was staring over his shoulder, the same place he was. She was smiling in a way he could only ascribe the reason for to Luna.
"I'm sure," Draco said. "Most of them hid it well. But not Pansy. She made it very clear she hated everything I made, and flat out refused to 'undergo such torture'."
Once it's arranged that Draco will come pick Scorpius tomorrow at nine in the morning, he kisses the top of Scorpius' forehead, waves at him and Annie and her parents, and watches them drive away. By now, the parking lot is almost emptied of cars and people.
Thank you so much for all your kind and supportive comments in the last chapter! I appreciated them deeply 💙
"Sweetheart," Harry cut him off, half-laughing, and Draco stopped short at that. Harry smiled, a slow bloom, teetering on a soft grin. "Yeah?"
"You make me feel real," Harry whispered to him, the warmth of Draco's cheek on the back of his own hand, watching him press a kiss to it.
So from here on, he resolves to reduce his encounters with Draco, seeing as his company clearly isn't welcome. It wasn't at St. Mungos either, but that had been a far different matter than what it is now. On top of that, it's difficult to interact with Draco when he seems so terribly cross with him. He isn't even sure why he is, because he wasn't cross with him before their return to Hogwarts, was he?
Malfoy pushed the door open, dragged him inside, shut the door and then crowded him up against the back of it. He'd pushed his hands up the opening of his hem, under his shirt and flat over his ribcage.
Draco mouth twitches, thinned and flat. He keeps his back straightened, his shoulders tense, staring up at him impassively. He begins to stand to his feet, calmly, in an attempt to extricate himself from the situation.
"Thought I saw you at the train station," Potter says, pushing his hands into his trouser pockets. "Thought I imagined it. You said you wouldn't come back."
Draco is sort of stunned about it, for a couple of seconds. "Merlin help me," he says then, snickering. "You're sickening."
"I don't suppose you want to know that." But it was enough of a blurry answer when Harry remembered Wormtail living at the Manor.
The whereabout-clock was showing all of them in danger. They'd flooed over to the Burrows, made a quick way for it in the living room. Harry had been moving so slowly that he was three steps behind everybody else. He leaned against the wall, trying to focus on the blurry form of the clock, the little golden hands quivering wildly just on the line of
The reception party had been a surprise, arranged and organised over the course of months by Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Luna for quite a while now. Draco had come in through the door, in the robes Harry had bought and asked him to come wearing. He was left wide-eyed, all the decorations in full bloom, surrounded by all their loved ones.
"And you still got with me," Ginny says. "You… you knew you were in love with… with him, and you were
Harry didn't entirely understand what was happening, why a tremor seemed to run down his face and shoulders, but something in him seemed to break with Draco's hands featherlight and warm on Harry's face, running his fingers over it, frowning sleepy and confused. He was whispering,
Draco doesn't say anything either for a long moment. "You need time," he repeats, then, quietly. "That's what you told her."
Hermione looks down, at her lap under the table. "You know why, Harry," she says, when she looks up at him again. "What you're doing with him —
"I just loved him so much," Ginny whispers, presses the back of her fingers against her mouth to gather herself. "And it's so hard to forget anything now when he's..." Harry steps forward, his throat burning, wanting to hold her, but she shakes her head, stepping away. He stays where he is, arms falling back to his sides. When she finally regains composure, she swallows hard and straightens, looking him in the eye. "you loved him too."
Prior to the start of their classes, Potter was telling Draco about the history of the infamous Marauders, ending on a note about his father and friends being unregistered animagi. The conversation promptly devolved into what animagi they themselves would be.
"Well?" Malfoy pressed. In his peripheral vision, he could see the cross of his arms over the chest of his white buttoned shirt. The cuff of his sleeves was squared at the middle of his arms.
Draco's shoulder tense up, a long silence stretching out between them. His gaze is cryptic and rooted passively to nothing. "What?"
Later on, sitting beside him on the couch, Hermione casted a diagnostic spell over Harry, and a black cloud rose up into the air. "It's
Tiredness creeps up on Draco again, slow and unsuspected, after days of snatching little sleep, his head either full of dreams or full of nightmares. Pepper-Up potions keep him going through classes, even if he can't entirely sit still, feels his head splitting apart with constant irritation, and is tired and jittery all the time.
and the two of them laughed so hard they could hardly speak any more, Hermione snickering uncontrollably into Ron's shoulder, and it took them forever to calm down and say their vows.
"The solution," Ezekiel, the cursebreaker, said, "lies in redirecting this unstable magic into a closed circuit. In other words, in order to stabilise the erratic and perpetual flow of the dark magic, it must be so that it remains only between the two main parties, constantly circling between their magical cores."
" He trailed off there, and his jaw worked, eyes drifting away. "I'm sure we can use our... predicament… to our advantage, in this case."
"What? No." Harry quickly shakes his head. After they've gathered all their things, they begin walking out of the DADA classroom. "No, it's fine. You two are, you know, a thing, and when you're a thing, it's… it's natural, right? To want to spend time together on your own?"
Harry doesn't see Draco the rest of the day, stuck at the celebrations for Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, but he's all he thinks about through it, and it's only in the dead of night, through a coin call, that they meet again on their Astronomy Tower. Draco's standing by the parapet, leaning into his elbows atop it. He must have heard his footsteps, because he's straightening, turning around, and Harry is moving towards him, a quick, desperate pace.
There is a terrible sort of dread swelling up in Harry's chest, overtaking him at the thought of Draco's mind lost in dreams that kept it safe, slowly killed his body on the outside, his eyes blank and unseeing, his body unmoving and sprawled on the floor of the Manor, of the cellar, on a hospital bed. At the thought of a world where Draco was never saved, like so many others that Harry held dear. A world where Harry came for him too late, and Draco wasn't right here next to him, where he never brought him sweets and sent him ridiculous drawings in class and fell asleep under a sky full of astronomy with him.
He was older. Of course he was, nearly six years later. He had a trimmed beard, and a round belly, and a healthy flush in his cheeks. There was a little girl in his arms. She looked just like him.
But there had still been a time, through their younger years, when he'd felt as if he had spent so long watching from the outside that maybe he got stuck there somehow. Even when he
They sit together for a long moment, and then Ginny stands, slowly, gathering her things, her jacket.
Draco only seemed to notice the bag then, so caught up he was in taking care of him. He lifted his head, as Harry gently pulled at his hand, cuing him to come sit up beside him. Harry took the velvet box out of the bag, opened it, and picked the ring out from the slit.
Harry stayed there in the door in the doorway, arms folded, watching him get ready in the mirror. Draco's voice piped up, without raising his head.
"And why exactly did we leave so early?" Draco asked, then, moving over to the hooks. He was tilting his head slightly over his shoulder, reaching his arms up high and hanging his coat on it. Harry thought it rather poncey for him to be wearing overgarments even in April.
Draco's cheeks and nose are pink against the white frost of the world around them, but the rest of him—his grey woollen hat and his white-blond hair falling out of it—suits the winter well. The crisp-white snow falls soft and slow on him, catching in his lashes, his hat, his scarf. Landing on the black of his coat.
Ron had his arm around the back of Harry's chair, warm and reassuring against the nape of his neck. He kissed Hermione's head, and then paused. He had a feigned frown on his face, as if he were trying to remember something. "How did that muggle saying go again?" He smiled, looking at Harry. "Where there is Hermione, there's always a way."
In the journey from the stairs up to what must be Draco's old bedroom, some of the fear had begun to melt into a kind of anger as well.
Luna is still here when he has to set his jaw hard against the tremors moving down to his is hands and shoulders, against the burn making his face and eyes warm. She is still here when his breaths hitch dangerously, when he begins to dry heave sobs.
Draco thought about it for a moment, and then nodded slowly, softly. "Yeah. Okay." Harry smiled and kissed the bumps on the back of his hand.
was. He said just as much, and Ron grinned. Hermione huffed and pushed at Harry's shoulder with a hint of mirth.
Half-way through July, Draco collapsed again, and their lives came to another halt once more, only it was in an entirely different way.
Harry goes on rambling, hardly looking at him. "I like you a lot. And honestly I... I guess I'm just sort of confused too, because the way you act with me, it doesn't feel like you like me at all but then with everything Scorpius tells me about what you say about me—"
Harry shifts at this, releasing a soft, snuffling breath through his nose, brows furrowing into a frown. His arm is around Draco's bare waist, tightening, Draco's fingers having paused at his movements, and the way his eyes open half-mast and meet his own.
Draco thought about it. "Well. A good part of why I went through with it was because I couldn't imagine spending so many years with
He's been feeling like a liar, trying to love her, knowing he loved somebody else. He feels like he's told her the truth now.
"For reasons I cannot mention, I'm not inclined to mention you at all to him. Don't take this wrongly, Harry. I do care for you, but he is my son first and foremost. And I'm afraid you will have to find him through other means."
On the somewhat better days, Narcissa had him curled around her, lying his head on her lap. Andromeda came with Teddy in tow, often, or left him with somebody else if it didn't seem like a good time for Draco, but whenever Teddy did come, he seemed to be the brightest beam in a grey, day-lit room, his wide-eyed innocence and babbled stories in the silence, playing at the foot of their bed. Draco, watching him quietly, from where he was half-sat against Harry or the headboard, with a blatant, tired sort of affection.
His mind is clear, when he looks at him now. He is awake, and they are real. Draco lifts himself up on an elbow, over Harry's face, shifting closer as he pushes back his hair behind an ear. Harry blinks, lips parting, eyes falling down to his mouth. They stay there, full with a quiver of a desperate emotion, and there's no question of the way he still feels. The way he looks at him. The soft way he touches him.
All Harry felt was a strange pang of misery, seeing them, all the subjects he'd taken just for his Auror training.  "I don't know, I've just—" He kept thinking of Voldemort, of the pounding of his own heart so fast that it felt like it would kill him, of the unsaved lives that weighed on him. "I don't know if being an Auror is what I want."
Harry blinked, turned his head away, not having realised that he was outlining him in his mind again, like he would trying to capture the beauty of a moment, a sight. A feeling. He focused his attention on Teddy instead, in his arms. His hair was a flaming red, and he was giggling uncontrollably at Ron's funny voice and silly faces amidst the hubbub of murmured conversation and distant chatter throughout the room.
Draco made a sort of noise, a scoff that jounced in his chest. "See, I don't believe we're much capable of working any other way, Potter," he said, poured the vial into a beaker, sounding half-distracted and insouciant. Something lilac bubbled up to the top. "We were two of the worst people this curse could have happened to."
They'd been trying to avoid the bedroom. There was something far too intimate about that, but it was on the first floor and the last place anyone would come looking for them, and if they would, it would be only
Harry is about to let go of him, his brain only then verging on a horrible doubt, on stepping back quickly. But then Draco's palm flattens at the middle of his spine, a very light and almost tentative touch, and he doesn't move away from Harry.
After a while, "What was it like?" she asks instead. It's a vague question. Draco doesn't know what part she's talking about, and she might have seen this, because she tries to clarify, "When you were... after you woke up. I suppose I just wonder sometimes, how you must have felt to be leaving like that."
Draco's visible grey eyes crinkled against the weariness of them. He shrugged. "He wasn't getting it."
Harry didn't mind it much, liked it in fact, if it was him or Hermione or any of the Weasleys, even if it was hard to seem outwardly comfortable about it. He thought they understood anyway, the way he'd lean into it after a moment and try not to be too obvious about it, because they never stopped.
"They were the first family I've ever had. Ron and Hermione," Harry says, and isn't sure why he's talking about this. Still, the words leave him, perhaps loosened by his exhaustion, by the comfort that now settles between them at times. Draco knows, though only at a surface-level, of his history with the Dursleys, and it makes it just a bit easier to speak of what he does next. "My uncle used to say nobody could ever — " He pauses, trying to substitute with a word that makes it sound less sad and pitiful as
adores him. Like it wasn't enough that he has always been favoured in everything Draco has ever wanted to be good at, now even his son worships the ground he walks on!
When they weren't actively ignoring each other and pretending the other didn't exist, they were arguing. Whatever forced patience they'd been trying to maintain at first, was gone by the next week at most, and all over again, they were arguing about Harry not being able to stay still at night, about Malfoy's shite all over the kitchen table and his damned wireless babbling nutty theories about the two of them again
"What about the whole — I dunno, pureblood, must-beget-an-heir thing? You probably had all that upended with this. The curse and all."
There were tears clumping his lashes together, caught there. When he craned his head up and kissed Draco again, so very gently, they fell.
"What, like you're an idiot?" He's adamantly trying not to think about what else might have slipped onto his traitorous face. He takes a step behind on his shoes, hands pushed into the pockets of his overcoat. "It's because you are one."
Thank you so much to everybody for sharing their thoughts, for all the lovely comments in the last chapter 💙
Song: Line Without a Hook by Ricky Montgomery (Idk I had just listened to this one a BUNCH while writing this chap)
He halts his words there, like he meant to say it aloud and then lost his nerve at the last second. The lingering and heavy weight of it, the unsaid, the memory, weighs heavier between them in the silence that follows, draping over them suffocatingly with the tautness of its tension. There's a scuffle, Potter's head turning away, his body turning into the curtains in his peripheral, like he's about to walk out. Except he doesn't. Except he turns back around.
an old and cracked desk in the corner that seemed to be scrubbed with cleaning charms. It was where all his notes were scattered.
At the reception party, after the dinner and Harry's best man speech (through which Ron began to weep again), Harry had taken Draco to dance as well, Draco leading it. He brushed his fingers at Draco's hairline.
"Globfish," Luna said, smiling against his shoulder. "They look very different when you put them in water."
"Or perhaps we become free by the time we're twenty-four, Malfoy," Harry said, his voice cool, simmering beneath the surface. "Not forty."
Harry remembered Draco again, sickly in the firelight the day the curse had happened to both of them, and knew she understood.
Harry was watching him from over the rim of his mug, getting a bit distracted from his own thoughts by the way he looked. The daylight was shrouding the kitchen bright. Malfoy was regarding his parchment, contemplative, elbows atop the table, his coffee half-drunk next to them. The tip of his quill was dipping at the centre of his bottom lip, a hint of teeth at the top. His attention kept focusing itself on that.
How terrifyingly strange, to be so aware of his own being and breathing and beating heart, still beating even after everything, even after having died once already. How terrifyingly strange, to not only be so aware of himself, but of somebody else's own being and breathing and beating heart, the breakable fragility of Draco's body pressed against his own side. How terrifyingly strange to be so in love with another person, to have all these overwhelming feelings and realisations in the ache of his own bones and stomach and heart, and to still be so held back by the force of his inhibition, because in that moment all he wanted was to turn his head and kiss Draco Malfoy, and even now — even now, he did not, paralysed by fear and doubt, by all the reasons he could not, by the way things often never were as one wanted them to be.
Thank you so much to everybody for reading, and for all the love and support you have shown this series, by kudos, bookmarks, comments, or however else - all of it. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I know there are some who have been here since 2019 and 2020 and that's just wild to me!! Thank you to for your patience and for sticking through the journey (and I'm sorry for all the waiting)!! 💙💙💙
concerned, and he knew that he was disguising much of it in front of his friends behind the 'Malfoy-is-acting-odd' pretense. Malfoy looked even worse than he did in sixth year, sickly and gaunt and quiet, like a ghost treading through the halls of the school. None of his friends, most of the Slytherins in fact, had returned to Hogwarts, so he was mostly seen sitting by himself. No one partnered with him in Potions. Most of the people have stopped paying him much attention by now, perhaps out of boredom or fear of Professor McGonagall's wrath the last time she discovered the perpetrator of a stinging hex that left Malfoy's back black and blue.
He is a lovely child, with his father’s signature white-blond hair, but his curls and dark gentle eyes are all hers. That's what Scorpius told Harry,
" The malaise had begun to lay thick over him, a sickening feeling in his throat. Something had begun to cloy around his heart, or maybe somewhere deeper. "I don't know what he did..."
"I'm sorry," Harry blurted, suddenly. The room went silent. A second. Two. "I know it doesn't matter, because it—" But it took the wind out of his lungs and instead he just went silent, throat burning. Still, a few seconds after, with no response from Draco, he breathed and said, "I'm sorry, for pushing the alteration on you."
"We should get up," Harry said, Draco humming behind him in agreement. He kissed Draco on the mouth again, and got up. He had to be at the St. Mungos pediatric ward soon, where he would polyjuice into well-liked public figures and book characters, or just remain as himself if wanted, and visit the children. Draco would have his classes in about an hour.
Sometimes it felt like he hated Harry from every fibre of his being all over again, and maybe it was because he blamed Harry for it, and maybe it was right, because Draco might have sat in that office and signed the contract for the alteration, but it was Harry who brought it to him, who pushed it onto him even when he kept saying he wasn't certain about it, who didn't do enough to keep him safe from what had happened to him, and now he was sick. Now he was angry and terrified and hurting.
At first Harry didn't quite understand what he'd said. He'd thought it was an incoherent word, as one might in delirium, but it seemed like a sign of improvement and Harry, latching on, quickly kneeled back down, leaned close, hands mindlessly coming around Malfoy's knee, the edge of a cushion. "Malfoy?" he whispered.

His mind was loud and full, lost in the turmoil and chaos. He did not hear the footsteps at first, and then he did, right as they seemed to enter the room. When he looked up, Draco was moving towards him, his eyes bright and full of a desperate emotion, and then he was there with his arms around Harry's neck and head, both of them stumbling back a bit as Harry caught him by the waist, startled. Draco's forehead was against his, his breaths warm on his mouth, only sharing his air like a kiss that he couldn't go through with yet.
Harry kept trying to conjure a Patronus, but it was hard these days to think of anything happy enough for it. He closed his eyes, swallowed hard, tried to calm down. When did it become so hard for him to think when he got scared?
There was Molly, and Hermione sat against his other side, her bushy hair on his shoulder. Bill was standing outside, talking to Xavier and Healer Francine, hands on his hips. Ron was there trying to make him laugh for all the last ten minutes, murmuring just between their group, Hermione throwing a short, hushed quip in with a smile every now and then. Molly whacked Ron on the shoulder with an admonishing word when he said something that was too much.
"I don't know. I didn't…" He'd been in Knockturn Alley, sometime at night, making his way back to a small room he'd rented in a nameless residence. He hadn't seen. It had been dark, and all he'd heard was a voice, a
And then he slips inside the room, shutting the door. The music is throbbing along to the throb of Harry's heart. Somehow, it's enough for him to work over a decision in his mind, to ease some more of his inhibitions, his inexplicable hesitance and low courage. More than anything, he's just not able to think of much else beyond what he wants right now. How much he does.
The rings were exchanged, and they stepped forward, Hermione with her arms around Ron's neck, kissing each other hard.
"Do we really need to be discussing this?" Draco asks, faintly disgusted at thoughts that he refuses to entertain.
"You don't have to tell me, I suppose," Ron says. Harry's been quiet too long. "I mean. Not until you're ready. So I'll just, you know. I have to go back and paint some walls. You'll be alright?"
He was angry at first. He was so angry, over the layer of his hurt and grief, that Draco just left like that. That he
Harry exhaled sharply, finally breathing as his fingers shot up to his tingling mouth. His brain felt scattered and hazy and blank again, which seemed to be happening a lot around Malfoy today, but he managed to croak out a helpless and baffled, "What—what was that?"
Draco's breaths is heavy in his chest, held in his throat. His eyes are heavy-lidded, a mellow frown in his forehead, not unlike the way he'd looked when he told Harry
, Harry said to him, that day he last saw him. He wonders what it means that Draco still wasn't able to call him by name, even after. Had it meant he didn't feel like Harry was his, then? That he didn't love him enough? Had it meant that Harry, here, wasn't enough?
Not studying, Harry supposes in secret when he is there, because he's too distracted by Draco's mere presence beside him, engrossed into his own book, or by the smell of his hair when he's leaning against Harry's shoulder, explaining something to him. He's busy trying to listen, to not think about kissing him instead, because Draco is always annoyed about it after they get carried away. Harry must look absolutely stupid and dopey, smiling at him, because sometimes Draco just breaks off with a huff and a dart of a glance away, and just settles back against his shoulder again.
He doesn't know what he's expecting Draco to say. He's expecting anger, perhaps, some sort of unhappiness on seeing him again. The way his last letter had gone, it seemed like it could be.
There was no ceremony, only the two of them sitting across from each other in Wizengamot. There were their families, and the wizard that would officiate their marriage, marriage license documents signed by a wand with their magical signature, and when Harry watched Malfoy sign them, and when he was trying to push the ring onto Harry's finger, careful not to touch him, he saw his hand shake just as his own did.
It was only after the pain and malaise had soothed to a phantom that the pull in his chest relaxed, that clarity shone through, breaking them out of their haze.
Harry didn't know what to say. He always tried not to think about the time ahead of them, before they could be freed from the curse, but three more years was far more bearable to think about than twenty. His Mind-Healer had told him to take it one day at a time, to try to stay in the present, when the thought of the future ahead would be so overwhelming, and to try all that he could in order to keep himself in the best mental shape as he could. It wasn't the most comforting or helpful, but it was about all she could say, he supposed, for the kind of predicament he was in.
Still, a song from the party throbs through the walls. Harry worries that somebody might be looking for him, but is also half-certain most of the people who'd want to would be passed out before they could. Except for Hermione, maybe. He isn't sure how Draco feels about other people knowing, but Harry is still uncertain if he wants anybody to know yet.
More than anything, he gets angry at himself. More than anything, he contemplates the ten other things he could have done in that moment — kept himself in check, not said those things, acted like he was fine, like he wasn't terrified and overwhelmed by it himself. Maybe he should have acted like he didn't know anything at all. Done anything that would have made Draco stay.
Harry blinked, raising his eyebrows, ignoring the last comment. "What about love? Enjoyment of each other? Compatibility?"
He uncrossed his arms and walked in, sliding a chair closer to his mother. Her face crumpled, terribly, for a second, and he leaned forward to take her into his arms, only she had pulled him in first, a hand on the back of his hair, his nose to her shoulder.
It would be the day after that Harry would know why he'd looked like that. Lucius Malfoy had been given the Dementor's Kiss. Malfoy hadn't been there in the Great Hall, or in their classes together for the rest of the day. He hadn't been anywhere for weeks after, showed up only for his NEWTS two weeks with grief sinking his eyes in. He hadn't bothered showing up for the graduation ceremony either.
Draco blinks hard at the sting in his eyes, a tension around his jaw, and there is still that tight, swooping feeling in his chest.
Memories of Potter's arms and body around him in a hospital bed, warm and solid, and somewhere else in another world, morning after morning, night after night. Potter's hands under a frantic grip of his own, his voice whispering to him about a hundred different things to keep Draco's mind from a wand at his back, setting his broken body right. Somewhere else in another world, his hands holding his own without any thought, walking along his side, pulling him into dances, holding his face and kissing him soft and lovely.
"Are you really so desperate to be on a first name basis with me?" Draco asks. He has a half-amused smirk on his lips. Harry wouldn't call himself desperate, per se— "What was it you'd said in First Year when I asked for your friendship?"
"This is me," Harry says, at the point of Apparition closest to Grimmauld Palace. Standing by a streetlight, he turns around to face him, nervously pushing his hands into a pocket a little deeper. There's silence. And then, "Do you… would you want to come along? Just to, um... see the place? You know, technically, it could sort of be yours too. Since you're a Black and all, but it's still mine, of course, since, um—" He laughs, rubbing at the back of his hair. "Since it was left to me. I mean, I thought maybe you would want to take a look around, see what I've done with it and—" Harry stops, realising he's rambling. Draco's smirking at him, seeming mostly amused by him now, and something else perhaps mellower. Perhaps familiar.
Draco swallowed, his red-rimmed eyes glistening. His brows twitched into a doleful frown, chin crumpling, only dangling on the edge of breaking.
"May I have your hand, please?" Luna asks, is scooting close to see him, and Draco doesn't know what she understands, how much she does. He doesn't know how to feel about it, only that he wants to cry, but he can't and he doesn't. "I won't touch you."
"Of course," Draco said. He put his hand with the camera down to his lap and put his arm around Luna.
Harry spent too long looking for something decent and casual to wear, trying his best to get his hair somewhat in control so that Malfoy wouldn't have anything to point out and mock, but his curls were still too wild and thick, and he was already minutes too late, which would certainly be something for Malfoy to point out and mock.
Malfoy grinned, and it was almost charming, endearing even, despite how unfamiliar it seemed. He really should do that more. He looked nice, Harry vaguely thought, and then ignored the fact that he ever had that thought. "Absolutely not. That would be lovely—" He looked down at her name tag. "Mareen."
Still, they were trying. Still, in the process of it, Harry learned much more about him, over the course of weeks like this. By now, he knew much of Draco's life story, and Draco knew his. It had become much easier to talk by then, even if they mostly seemed to circle around each other, avoided a lot of topics, wondered a lot about what was right to say and what wasn't, at least on Harry's part.
"I can't even imagine what those fucking bastards did to…" he says, shaky, still with his fingers on his skin.
"Do you mind?" Harry asked, upon seeing the scattering of notes and potion-related things on the kitchen table again. He was holding his plate and mug in hand, his book under his arm. The little space that Malfoy had been leaving him was gone again.
At some point Harry's eyes met with Draco's over the man's head, still nodding even though he was hardly hearing anything, desperately trying to be polite. He didn't know what he looked like, but even in his anger, Draco seemed to find it amusing, a tremor of a smirk playing at a corner of his mouth as he quickly broke the gaze, paying intent attention to the man speaking to him.
Harry turned the lights off, nonverbally, because it was weirder to have to look at each other when they did this. His magic was erratic and everywhere though, so all the items rattled, and then settled. There was a scuff as Malfoy stepped forward in the dark. He smelled strongly of alcohol, seemed drunker than he was when Harry had seen him in the drawing room.
Harry doesn't say anything to that. He doesn't know if anybody had anything easy that year, if he can think of those dreams as any better when he thinks of Draco nearly dying from them.
The Healer had said that the symptoms would be fatigue and weakness, magical sensitivity, erratic magic, nosebleeds, nausea, body pain, chills. He couldn't think of anything at first, but then he remembered Draco trying to cast the animation spell, and he remembered Draco looking tired and skipping his classes, and he remembered Draco sometimes seeming to need a minute after flooing in or out of anywhere, and he remembered Draco disappearing into the bathroom in some haste, the back of his hand under his nose, coming back looking strange and troubled.
He turns away, breathes, rubs at his eyes. "Look, I… I'll tell her I don't… feel that way for her anymore. I will. I just…"
But some days, when Draco is with him, he almost feels at home, almost feels real again, the way he did in his dreams.
He sits there, a silent presence, only soothing hands in Potter's hair, over his biceps, his shoulders.
When there isn't anything else, he turns on his wireless to fill the silence more often than not, playing tunes he doesn't always pay attention to.
The lead singer was singing softly right now, over a gentle piano and violin melody. They were two songs in, and the Colovaria seemed to be of somewhere between alternative rock and indie rock genre. Harry couldn't deny that they were actually of his own taste, but he didn't want to be here simply on the principle of how disappointed he was about Malfoy's reason to interact with him after months.
"No," Draco said. "But I did try to court her, through third and fourth year on my father's orders, but I could tell she was just as disinterested in me beyond our friendship."
with a soft, much too pleased smile. She hadn't seemed any more open to the idea of him being there than Draco was to the idea of her hanging around for hours on end, so he'd said his departing words to Luna and taken his leave, spending the rest of the day walking around Hogsmeade on his own.
Upon understanding her words, Draco blinks, gaze quickly dropping to the ground in front of him. "Oh."
"Do I?" Malfoy said. He sipped a spoonful of his soup, and swallowed. "Haven't been sleeping much, I suppose." He smirked, then. "What's your excuse?"
Next to it is that bizarrely dressed portrait at their alcove, that they often made fun of. The man is standing in front of the mirror, but he is blowing kisses out at Harry instead of himself. It had been so absurd, and Harry had laughed seeing it just before their Charms class, Draco turned a little towards him in the next row two seats ahead, a quill between his fingers, smirking.
And so the more Draco begins to fall to this blinding foolishness of his, the more he watches himself grow more open to Potter's company, as if he were watching somebody else from afar, and the more Potter keeps coming back. He finds Draco at breakfast, where he shows up half-asleep before his tea and nearly drops into Draco's shoulder every few seconds. And then he shows up at lunch, and then dinner after Quidditch practices, after which they walk back to the dorm together and separate as he joins his Weasleys and Granger.
Harry stared at him. He didn't know what to say. He didn't know if he blamed him for something he was just as much a victim of. He didn't feel, at a visceral level, that the reason for his outburst last night had much to do with any of that.
At first, Harry is afraid. At first he is afraid because they are friends, and they are fragile, and Draco is still recovering, healing. Tangling anything up into complications might just mean breaking everything apart.
Harry's eyes flicked to Malfoy, a nauseated feeling in his throat that wasn't entirely to do with illness. Malfoy's widened gaze was rooted to nothing in front of him, boring a hole into the carpet.
of Harry's hand is around one of his wrists. He's pink in the cheeks, surprised, until that falls away and his eyes crinkle with a smile. He's in love with Harry too. He's been in love with Harry for a long time. The fact of that takes the breath out of his lungs once more, burns at the base of his throat.
A silence comes over them, then, and there he is again, at a loss for words. Not knowing the right ones.
He doesn't understand how his mother does it. Live here. Forced to live with the ghosts of their past. Forced to live in a place that no longer feels like her own. He knows he can't ever.
The bed moves slightly as she sits up. The sheets rustle, and her clothes, as she buttons her shirt up. Then she scoots forward to sit beside him on the edge of the bed, hands planted onto it, shoulders a little high.
Draco was bowed over Teddy's toes, tucking one side of his hair behind an ear, quick and messy, trying to see. It still left behind loose, swirling tendrils.
He talked about the alteration to everybody who would listen, just considering the idea of it. He talked about it to Ron and Hermione when he stayed another night on their couch, to Neville in an owled letter, to Andromeda while she was feeding Teddy in his high chair, and George at the joke shop while he arranged his shelves, and Molly, Ginny, Arthur and Charlie at the table on the Weasley's Sunday dinner.
In the quiet of the night, Harry wonders of Hermione, of how she is. He misses her deeply, just as Ron does, even though they've both been rather terrible at returning her owls. However, she needs the time with her parents after having them regain their memories of her so recently. There's only a few weeks left now until they meet again at the Hogwarts Express.
Draco is, as of now, leaning sideways on an armchair as he waits the crowd of people out. All long legs crossed over the knee of the other, the cuff of sleeve at one wrist resting on the arm of the chair, the other hand curled loosely at his jaw. His fingers are flexing in thought, thumb running over the pads of his fingers.
? Why not just finish your last year here? And you're—you're bound to stay here by the Ministry, aren't you? How can you…"
, not necessarily that everything would be okay, but that it would be okay even if it wouldn't be, just because they were all there right outside that door.
"It's alright," Hermione said, smiling at him reassuringly and squeezing his arm. "It's alright, you know. You don't have to… Bill would say something like that would be there in almost every bond that was symptomatic, or it wouldn't be a symptomatic bond at all."
On a firecall with Hermione, Ron sitting beside him on the floor against the couch, Harry had passed on Draco's words of gratitude and farewell. Ron had been the more baffled one, which made sense when Hermione sprung on them that Draco had personally apologized to her for his past behaviour, not so much in words as in his tone and expression, but nonetheless, it had happened. Ron hadn't been closely exposed to Draco's changing demeanour, and so therefore he still struggled to wrap his head around this.
"Ronald Bilius Weasley," she said, smiling, a crinkle in her eyes. She took the ring out, grinning widely at Ron's wide-eyed, bald shock. "Marry me and I'll watch all your terrible morning shows with you the rest of our lives."
Harry grins at that, slow and small. "Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So… so come on with me." He jostles his hand out of his coat pocket, reaches down between them and takes a hold of Draco's wrist. Draco glances down at it, Harry's hand loosening, hesitating. "I—it's under a Fidelius charm. I'd have to—"
"No," was all Malfoy said to him, plain and simple, cutting him off in the middle of his riveted explanation. Harry stopped pacing, turning to look at him where he sat upright on Harry's couch, his shirt untucked and missing a top button, sleeves open, fingers at one wrist working on buttoning them. He looked bored, ruffled up, his hair a wavy tousle behind his ears, ending where a flush always lingered at his neck and jaw after sex.
That night, he told her everything in a way he hadn't to anybody else outside of Aileen. Like the seven year old that used to tell her all his stories about the treehouse and the peacocks in their garden, the unkind things his father used to say in his cold anger.
They watched the man run right past, and only then relaxed, slumping back fully, their shoulders leaning together closely, but too breathless and aching to move in anyway.
He turned around and stared at Draco. Draco was burrowed under the covers, hiding half of his face to conceal his smile under it, platinum tuft of hair peeking out.
Harry floundered for something to say, sick to his throat with his own riot of emotions, his own fear. He looked down at the wood tiles instead, just sat there and stared at nothing with him. Draco's breaths shuddered next to him, low in his chest, a controlled exhale.
That night, Malfoy had come into the drawing room when Harry was sitting on the couch, pulling his socks off. He'd come back just now from Ron and Hermione's. He spared Malfoy a glance, saw him in his white long-sleeved shirt and black bottoms, towelling his damp hair, and then quickly looked away. The events of the afternoon, which he'd blessedly put out of his mind, came crashing back.
But he's trying, don't they know? What's the point of holding on to a boy that has long since forgotten he even exists. He's trying to forget him too. He really is.
"I heard Draco's returned to England," Hermione says. They've all taken to calling Draco by his name over time, having picked it up from Harry.
Draco's steps falter, but he resumes then without much of a hitch, and he's pink in the cheeks, huffing as he comes over in front of him. He's wrapping the scarf around Harry's neck, swatting Harry's hands away and buttoning up the rest of his coat, quick and precise and done within seconds. "Yes, yes. Merlin forbid the Saviour of the Wizarding World ever lift a finger to help himself."
Draco was looking at him, a little sweeter and more tender with his hair all mussed up, sleep still a slight swell in his eyes.
Dudley spoke to him normally, as if old acquaintances. He asked him who the bag was for, and Harry told him it was for his spouse. Dudley was telling him that the bag in his own hand was for his wife too, that it was her birthday, and Emelie told Harry that she was the one that picked it out, smiling broadly at him, and Harry smiled back at her.
It’s a strange feeling, to be the only one now who knows of them — to be looking at his face, staring back at him with the dawning of bemusement. It feels like a certain kind of absence.
There was another shift of his head in Harry's peripheral, turning away. "I see." Harry darted a glance at him, and then away. It was nice out here, the night bright and clear, and though not many, the stars were scattered far and wide across the sky.
The mechanics of the bond were complicated, and Harry only got just the gist of the explanation, but was left with gaps in his understanding here and there. He only understood that before this, negative emotions were only partially affecting the bond. They weren't the true basis. Positive emotions were, but there wasn't a whole lot of that there,
Malfoy's face was very still. He turned his head away, made a sort of apathetic noise. He leaned forward, reaching for the bottle on the table. There was a pause, one that felt longer than it was. He poured himself another finger, not looking at him, and then said, "No, Potter. Frankly, I don't give much of a damn about anything when it comes to you."
Potter looks at him, wordless. He looks tired. "You know there's a lot more to it than that. You..." He seems to struggle for words. He settles on, "You look at me like you live for me." He stops, huffing, looking away. "Merlin fuck. I hate how that came out."
As she slid to him his tea, Harry gave her some story about the curse acting up, Draco not willing to leave the party and settle it down.
"I came along because I was… you..." Draco said, trailing off. He scoffed, looking away. "Whatever. Come on then."
"I'll take care of you." Harry whispered back, squeezed his hand. He swallowed. "I'll be here. And all the people that you love."
He finds Draco Malfoy beautiful. He'd known that he was in a peripheral sort of way even years ago, when he didn't like him at all, but this is something different. Something a bit more to do with the way he moved like his every movement was grace, the way it felt to be with him, not so much with the colour of his eyes and his hair (though that too).
These last eight years, Harry has found his corner of peace here, with these children that he loved like his own; his very own home after Grimmauld Place that he shared with Ron and Hermione.
Some people in the comments pointed out the role reversal in the fic, where it was Draco who remembered the dreams alone and now it's Harry, and I was just mindblown because what a COOL CATCH - I didn't realise this, thank you for that!! I used that concept a bit in this chapter!
"I thought we were past thinking Malfoy was an evil, scheming git," Ron said, cheek against Hermione's bushy brown hair. She was reading a book while she leaned into his chest.
Potter pries open the crane with his fingers, tossing a glance over his shoulder as he does, before turning back to look at it. His grin comes slow a moment later, his hand brushing up to his nose and lips to repress it.
That night, he spent dinner with three of his favourite people together in the same room, for the very first time. Though it was initially strange and uneasy, eventually, like a tense muscle relaxing, it began to fall away when they touched upon a common topic with Draco — charity organisations and causes with Hermione, and Quidditch with Ron.
"That's not what's new." His voice was still a light rasp from slumber. Draco reached out and tentatively tangled his fingers into the spaces between his, almost as if he wasn't sure if it was okay, as if he couldn't entirely believe it happened. Them. Draco's forehead furrowed. "You didn't go for classes?"
"I didn't mean it. What I said," Draco was saying. Harry could still feel his eyes on him. "I was just angry and in pain. I don't really blame you."
Hermione shared a glance with Ron from the rather low chair. She worked her lower lip, that silent communication thing that they did sometimes. She looked back at him. "He's...not awake yet," she said, a little slowly. "We don't, um… they won't tell us much. They said you're the only one who can know."
"Yeah, sure. Come on," Harry said. He got Teddy off the broom first, and then got off himself. Teddy immediately grew fussy about that, wanting to get back on it, saying a word that was supposed to be
In return, Harry told him that he loved science-fiction books. He liked digestives. He'd been interested in art since he was a child, and used to collect a lot of art supplies. He used to watch a lot of television, in particular game shows and talent competitions, which he had to explain to Draco what it was
She only smiles at him, a little rueful.  Then she goes back to brushing her fingers through grass, as if grounding herself to it, letting it be quiet for a while.
Theoretically, a marital bond created a connection between magical cores, a sort of channel that allowed for magic to be shared, even if, outwardly, this showed no visible change or effect. There was support and evidence for this theory, but there were loose ends to it, objections that had no concrete explanations. Even so, this had been the only solution for the last several cases.
"Sorry," Harry said, thick, as he drew back to try and hide his face. He quickly swiped the back of a hand over his cheeks, under his nose. "I'm sorry."
"It's the... " Harry's mouth went dry, running on its own before he could even understand why it was. "The physical contact… you know. It's
The letter had detailed, in a rather straightforward tone, the things he was deeply regretful and apologetic for: for calling her a mudblood, for what had happened to her in his home at the hands of his aunt.
She smiled, that thin and wry smile Harry had often seen on the same lips, a different person. "I wonder when exactly he started protecting me instead of the other way around."
She blinks awake to the stirring of his numbed hand. When she sees his opened eyes, she straightens, the side of her hair tousled. "Draco?" She quickly climbs up onto the bed beside him, leaning her head over him and running her fingers through his hair. The relief on her face is painfully tangible. "Thank Circe you're awake."
He was probably a little drunk, pink across the nose and cheeks with it, and this stilted some of the musical notes. Even then it was beautiful, and Harry hadn't realised he was smiling a bit until Draco caught his eyes just a little ways from the end, and maybe that was strange, so he stopped, quickly, slightly embarrassed.
The very tips of their noses brush together when Harry angles his mouth over Draco's, parting along with this, tongues pressing together. Draco's breath shudders, a sharp exhale through his nose, the kiss slow and slick and warm. Careful. It's a few seconds after that Harry feels something cool drip over the back of his knuckles.
"No. Of course not." Luna shrugs. "I don't think you can ever be wrong in being who you are, unless you're hurting someone. Are you?"
Draco walks inside the room, soundless but for Longbottom's breaths too loud in his sleep. He closes the door behind him, casts a wandless Lumos with a wave of a hand as he heads towards the bed. He slides the gloves off his fingers by the middle, throws them aside onto his trunk as he passes it by, and drops down onto the edge of his bed to tug his shoelaces off. He puts his shoes aside, and then looks down at the coat, still draped over his arm.
Draco tilted his face slightly in his direction, in that obscure, studious sort of way he did when Harry diverted from their usual way of interacting, either like he was working him out or contemplating his own reaction. He twisted a corner of his lips. "No. I didn't." A beat, and then two. "Did you?"
When the silence begins to press down on his lungs, he asks her to speak to him, and she does. She keeps up a chatter of everything and nothing, about her wild rose bushes in the garden, sometimes asking him of Potter and his time in the hospital, but sometimes there isn't anything left to say inside a big house with little to do.
Ron is angry. He doesn't talk to Harry for weeks, coming close to a whole month. He knows he hurt Ginny, broke her heart. He did the wrong thing trying to fall back in love with her when he knew he couldn't, and he deserves their cold shoulder. He is still terrified of losing him and everybody else he loved. He is still fucked up over losing Draco. He is terrified of not ever talking to them, terrified of going over first only to learn he was no longer welcome or a part of their family. So he keeps himself isolated in Grimmauld Place, with only Hermione and Luna visiting him for company.
Settled in bed, Harry's arms curl around Teddy, cradling the baby close and protective into the side of his ribs. Teddy lifts his stuffed hippogriff above his head, showing it to Harry, telling him a whole story that only he understands.
"What's this? Is it a new..." Harry's gripping Draco's wrist, trying to take a look at it, and goes still at the sight. He's lying with his head on Draco's lap, whilst Draco is reading a book, an uneventful, relaxed weekend.
"I have fruits," Harry says, lamely. He reaches into his basket and takes out an apple, holding it out to him. Draco cocks an eyebrow, lofty and cold. "It won't bite you now, will it, Malfoy? It's more likely to be the other way around."
"Mother?" Draco's hand is already twisting the doorknob and pushing it open, and then he's inside the room, and he's kneeling in front of her. Narcissa is hunched over, her face buried in her hands. Her shoulders are quivering, but the sobs have stopped abruptly as soon as he'd entered.  "Tell me what's wrong."
He lifted his head again a moment after, had only meant to only watch what was happening, to be in the moment, but something focused in his mind on what he was looking at right then, and he was stilled by the odd flare of a feeling, a warm bubbling low in his stomach.
"Water under the bridge," Harry said, pressing his own fingers to the back of Draco's. Their voices were so low, just between them. He snorted a slight smile, trying to make light. "I suppose it adds some character to it." But Draco didn't smile. He was still frowning, and a vapor of that stayed even after he fell asleep. Harry smoothed it over gently.
His mouth was dragging down the side of his throat, all tongue and teeth, sucking heavy at the flutter of his pulse, heard him inhale a sharp breath — pushed his shirt up to his underarms and over his head, palmed him broad and thorough everywhere.
Draco eyed him for a moment, seeming strange. He opened his mouth to say something, but Andromeda's voice piped up from the door, telling them it was time for Teddy's nap. Harry gently pulled Teddy off the broom, Draco planting his oxfords back into the grass and helping him get off. Teddy was clearly getting irritable without his nap, and yet not ready to stop flying. It took both he and Draco too much time to coax Teddy away, and even then, he was crying as he was being taken away by Andromeda.
Ron is clearly disappointed, but he sighs. "Yeah, alright. I get it. Not going to be the same without you, though." Ginny smirks, and exaggerates an
They didn't always bother taking all their clothes off, but Harry saw Malfoy's Dark Mark and the scars his
"No," he finally said, cocking his head thoughtfully. Then, to Harry's surprise, he huffed, a small upturn at one corner of his lips. A near-genuine smile.
He watched Teddy waddle-run over to Draco, whose cheeks folded into a slanted half-grin. He caught Teddy by the underarms, appearing mock-stern and jesting as he spoke to him, silvery eyes narrow and bright. Teddy laughed around his own fingers, face alight, with the hint of two baby teeth through a broad, gummy smile. Draco pulled lightly at Teddy's wrist, with a grimace that had Harry amused, ducking his head.
There was a reason why they were asked the questions they were asked, and why they were made to sign a contract full of the stipulations it contained
He seemed awfully surprised for a brief second, straightening upright with a hand on the arm of his sofa. It changed into a blandly polite squinch at the corners of his mouth, turning his face away as he put his drink on the side table.
Draco lets go, leaves their temples together. He takes hold of his hand, swallowing hard, seeming overcome. "Merlin, you drive me mad," he whispers, huffing. Harry smiles and kisses him hard.
"What happened?" Harry asked, not entirely sure if he was heard under Draco's harsh breaths, though he was sure that even if he was, Draco would only ignore him.
Harry then stilled, suddenly realizing just who he was sitting with and who he just said that to. Malfoy's silver eyes flicked up to him, and Harry was sure that he would be affronted, and then he would get mad and say something that would get Harry mad in retribution and then t—
The world is growing distant and foggy, the current of his own breathing, the unsteady and erratic movement of it, filling up his ears.
"Probably around half past two," Harry estimated, and then chuckled softly at the surprised, wide-eyed expression on Draco's face as his hand stilled, glancing over at him sharply.
He presses his lips together, watching the Thestrals feast on a dead bird.  He had felt the stares on him as he'd moved through the corridors of the train, the hiss of whispers as he'd passed. "I had presumed."
"Am I really that bad at kissing?" Harry asks, in a laugh, just wanting to make Draco laugh too. Draco does, though it's only a thick huff of one. "This has happened before, you know. I've got to wonder now if it's really something with me."
"I'm just afraid," Harry says, in a low voice. "They're still… there's still so much that's just wrong, and I'm afraid that if I hurt her now, I'll lose her, and then I'll lose Ron, and then I'll lose everybody…"
Harry, perhaps, did not do well enough to show Malfoy he was just as affected. He noticed it these days
"I'm sorry," Potter says, painfully, sincerely contrite, after a long moment. "I… I had no idea what it would do."
Harry swallowed down the lump in his throat, ducking down to look at his hands. He lifted his head after a moment of silence and smiled slightly to lighten the atmosphere. "Viktor Krum."
He tried to distract himself with dinner, tried not to think much of anything. He tried to ignore the bright and sharp ache in his chest, and the feeling of being cold at his core, the inadequacy of not being wanted back. He listened to Draco's footsteps outside, soft falls of shoes slowing, hushing away until he couldn't hear it anymore.
Harry nodded slightly, his eyes drooping back shut. When he pulled them open again, he noticed the expressions on their faces, until they looked away. "Di'n't work?"
Harry obliged, coming to sit on a chair near her. Her eyes were scarlet from exhaustion, a little swollen. She did not look like she slept much.
Draco introduces himself with his full name, and then presents himself as a chemist, explaining what it means by adapting it to his work as a potioneer, what his tasks are; to analyse chemicals and see what they consist of, to measure how fast a substance reacts with another, to understand a new thing that they don't know much about or to create a new chemical that can help in certain fields or areas of life. He works from a lab in his home, creating a lot of new chemicals and medicine, delivering them for the people that place their orders.
"You're quite good," Draco said, a hand absently playing with Harry's hair, massaging at the nape of his neck. Harry's brows jumped up, surprised. He looked down at him, smirking. "I really did like all those paintings you made of my face."
"I don't want to talk about it," Harry cut him off, abruptly. "Just. I don't want to talk about the war, or anything like it. So don't ask me anything about that."
His only breath of air, the grip over the clamber for his own sanity, were Ron and Hermione, often coming over for dinner, imitating normalcy and making him smile and forget a little bit with mundane stories of their time in training, complaining about living with each other with the riveted fondness and amusement of enjoying one another too much anyway, updating him on what they'd heard about their other friends that Harry had yet to catch up to.
He watches his shoes, the way they misplace soil under the nettles of grass. She continues on walking, then, prompting Draco to as well.
That night, Harry woke up gasping again, only this time he couldn't breathe at all. He fumbled out of the sheets, gasping hungrily for air, putting his feet on the ground and folding over. He wanted to stand, go to the bathroom, only he could hardly move, his head dizzy and light.
The room they were in was small, half-crowded with those that Harry loved before the procedure was to start.
Harry yelped, quickly putting his trousers up in front of himself. "What are you—did you just try to take a picture of my—"
Just as he reached the door, however, he heard a voice calling out his name, forcing him and his friends to halt to an abrupt step. Harry had frozen in shock, his heart skipping as if he'd missed three steps altogether when the owner of it registered in his mind.
"So what? Do you want to leave me now, is that it? Had enough of the Death-Eater boy, and now you want to go back to your Weasel girl?"
It feels like starting anew too. Like the things Harry can give him here won’t be secondhand. Like making all those memories with Draco is for him to make, a blank slate.
, was what Hermione would say. It was what Harry said to him too, adrenaline spiking up his system, laced with something icy to the point of burning, something sharp and angry and terrified. "You can't just keep this from him! And you can't ask me to do the same thing!" His brows furrowed to a faint ache in his temples, breaths quick and short. His hands were tight around the arms of the chair. "Merlin, isn't this illegal? Doesn't this go against some
He goes inside his room, stops at the desk. He pushes his trembling fists onto the top of the desk and closes his eyes, breathing through something festering sick in him, something in him rearing ugly and bitter and cold.
Except Malfoy called for him with a quiet, "Potter." And something in his voice made Harry stop before he could move beyond a swift turn of his body, made him look back at Malfoy, who had just stepped up to him, one hand in the pocket of his pressed dark trousers.
When Harry showed up to the gala that evening, it was to a whole host of flashbulbs from metres away, the reporters held back by a transparent barrier. He could only see dark spots and nothing else, blinking hard as he turned and made his way towards the entrance, the loud, distorted chorus of people yelling and speaking over each other from behind him.
Pansy once says, smirking at him, her perfect eyebrow arched. It's been a joke with her, when they were fourteen and fifteen, sixteen, her trying to goad him and rile him into talking about Potter so he wouldn't be so quiet and withdrawn all the time. She looks at him now like she did then, with a sort of shadow of fear and worry in her eyes, silently examining him.
at Hermione, who huffs a half laugh. "Shut up, Gin." He pauses, and then turns to Harry. "Honestly, you know, maybe I don't really want to be an Auror either."
, you know. Make me laugh. I think — I think he was the only one that I wanted around me then. George too, but even he sort of held back, and I didn't want anyone to hold back. I just wanted everything to keep going like it had before so I could just
Harry halts to a stop, turning to him. "Did you see him, Ron? When Smith was shoving at him? And then, last night—"
"I'll take you there one day, if you'd like," Draco said, looking up at her, the camera between his hands. He sounded sincere. Harry knew he was.
"It doesn't make sense..." Harry whispered to him, staring at his profile. "It doesn't make any sense… why this happened."
Draco is passing by his mother's room when he hears the sounds. The sobs muffled behind the closed door.
It was as if he believed he could demand of the bond that they did not need each other, take his life back from it. Still, Draco was smarter than he was angry and terrified and hurting, and it didn't take him all too long to realise that physically pushing him away was hardly worth the trouble. So now they stood whenever needed with their hands on each other, in his stony quiet, cold grey eyes always fixated past Harry.
Draco's spent years watching him with others, observing his goodliness towards people that weren't him. He's spent years seeing that for all the Gryffindor-ness of him, all the stupid and angry and reckless, there is something impossibly, charmingly gentle about his boyish veneer. And to have Potter be that way with him, not unlike he would a friend—
