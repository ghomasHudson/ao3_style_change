“It’s not me you should be apologizing to, Mr. Malfoy,” Soto says shortly. He glances at her, noticing her expression soften when she sees his blush, and he looks away again.
“What do you think we should do now?” Harry asked, after gulping down the drink.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “About my failed experiments?”
Harry picked up the tin with a trembling hand. And there, in Draco’s precise handwriting, was one small addition to the original label. A little arrow between
Draco frowned in confusion at the abrupt subject change. “Well, technically I have not proven that it even works with Potions, yet. All my work is theoretical. But… possibly? Is there something specific you have in mind?”
Draco Malfoy? He didn’t live at the Manor anymore, Harry knew.
“Well,” Blaise said, “at least we won’t be overheard.”
And then his hands were free and he was falling forward into Malfoy.
But Draco was done listening. The words
Draco cocked his head and gazed intently at Harry. The unspoken words shimmered in the air between them.
With that, Pansy sauntered away.
Draco Malfoy not wanting to know something? It was like you were a stranger!”
“Fascinating,” Granger whispered, tapping a finger against her lips. “I mean, if they’re not suppressing you in some way, then there probably isn’t any kind of magical interference happening, but it’s still good to know that the apparition doesn’t show up on the trace. I’m not sure what that means yet, but it must mean
“I had to wait in the garden –
Harry moaned shamelessly, and he felt Draco’s mouth curl into a smile. Draco ground their erections together, thrusting against Harry in a pace more frantic than sensual.
Luna appeared to be directing her side of the game with no regard for strategy or even for the most basic rules of chess. Oddly, her pieces moved without complaint or argument. Harry glowered at the board. He’d been playing with those chess pieces for years now, and they had never once been this obedient to him.
He was afraid.
“I just do,” Malfoy snapped, crossing his arms over his chest.
But what could that thing possibly be? And why was Blaise being so reticent? It wasn’t like him to hesitate. Blaise approached problems the way he moved through crowds, breezing past with a charming smile and a few well-placed nudges of his broad shoulders.
“Have you read that book before?” Harry asked innocently, untucking Draco’s shirt and nuzzling at the pale strip of skin that was revealed.
When Harry finally joined Draco on the sofa, nervousness was pouring off him in obvious waves, but there was a determined glint in his eyes.
“Harry?”
Blaise broke off mid-sentence as Harry approached.
“You’re not getting rid of me that easily, Malfoy,” he said. He rubbed a thumb gently across Draco’s cheekbone, softening the teasing words.
After the meal, Draco had shyly tugged Harry toward the restaurant’s deserted courtyard, his bashfulness fading when Harry gasped appreciatively. With fairy lights twinkling overhead, they had danced to enchanted piano music, Harry botching the steps as Draco led. A hand pressed firmly into Harry’s back, Draco guided his movements and spoke rapturously of an experimental potion he had finally perfected the day before. Harry was fascinated, not only by Draco’s words, but also by the shine of moonlight in his hair, and he gazed up at Draco dreamily while trying not to step on his toes.
Malfoy swallowed hard. “Fourth year – after the Quidditch cup –”
“What did you do?” Draco demanded.
That morning, stirring chocolate into the waffle batter, laughing and barefoot on the sun-warmed tiles with the scent of strawberries sweetening the air, Draco finally admitted, if only to himself, that he was hopelessly, irrevocably in love with Harry Potter.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said again. “I’m so sorry.”
He forced himself to breathe slowly, calming the angry rush of his blood. Closing his eyes, he let go of the dream, loosening the fingers that had been clutching to its fading scraps. And then, as he peeled off his pants, he conjured a new image. Draco at the kitchen counter last night, shoulder muscles straining against deep blue fabric as he’d vigorously whisked the soup, fitted trousers emphasizing the curves of a sinfully gorgeous arse.
The girl flipped to the next page, dragging her finger along the lines of text as she read.
“I watched you too,” Harry whispered, eyes locked on Draco’s for a heated moment before walking away.
“You never come down here before midnight. Are you
Probably it was just a side effect of brooding over Malfoy.
Growing up at the Dursleys, the kitchen had been a place of taunts and reprimands, of hunger and hate-filled stares. He was tolerated there, but never welcome, treated like a servant when he wasn’t simply banished from sight.
Harry’s chest tightened. He’d never heard Malfoy say his name before.
“No, Malfoy, it’s ok,” Harry reassured him. “It was bad, but it’s over really quick. As soon as I pull my magic back into myself, I can’t feel the residue anymore. I’ve gotten a lot better at it.”
“Those monies are invested in such a way that the organization will be self-supporting for decades, if not longer. Mr. Zabini handled all of the financial arrangements, which I believe is how he was promoted so quickly to the top of his firm. I understand it is not typical for nineteen-year-old interns to waltz into their superior’s office with a proposal for a multibillion-Galleon charity project.”
Harry sighed. Scraping his fingertips against the rough grit of the walkway, he tried to convince himself that bacon sandwiches were all the company he’d need.
“It’s pretty,” Ginny cut in, standing to examine the lights more closely. She brought her face uncomfortably close to Draco’s and poked a finger into his ice blue halo. “Like a Christmas tree.”
Harry noted that the few couples strolling the paths of the garden seemed to be giving Malfoy a wide berth, but the man did not seem troubled to be alone. His face was relaxed as he ran his fingers over the vines tangled through the ornate bench.
Draco smirked back at him. “Probably.”
“You can stay if you want,” he said casually, facing away from Harry as he folded the collared shirt he’d been wearing and placed it inside his wardrobe.
Draco dipped his head and suddenly his tongue was teasing Harry’s collarbone, and Harry succumbed to the pleasure. He threw his head back and moaned shamelessly, letting himself be swept out to sea.
you look, after you run.”
Draco let out a tiny sob as he wiggled out of his pants, dropping them to the floor beside his jumper. Harry pulled off his shirt, but when he tried to stand to take off his boxers, Draco pushed him back down. All at once, Draco was desperately impatient, blood on fire as he reached into Harry’s boxers and pulled out his cock. Harry cried out, thrusting up into Draco’s fist. He was so thick, his flesh hot and slick with pre-come. Draco moaned and wanked him faster, reveling in the feeling of Harry heavy in his hand.
“No, Blaise,” Draco said, cutting him off. “You knew how I felt about him.” Draco’s voice broke, as if finally acknowledging out loud what Blaise had always known had shattered something inside him. “How I have
This was about as far as the thoughts usually got before Harry would forcibly splinter them, uncomfortable with his renewed fixation on Malfoy. He had burned through almost forty hours of podcasts in the past week, as well as embarking on several home improvement projects.
Healer Tahlyn was an imposing woman, tall with broad shoulders and a stern mouth, but she listened intently to Harry’s explanation about the vicious residue they were fighting. Eyes bright and discerning, Tahlyn nodded sharply as he spoke, her black curls bouncing almost impatiently on her shoulders.
It was not something it was possible to regret, and so Harry had pushed the momentary guilt aside and smiled reassuringly at McGonagall. And when Draco began his gleeful explanation of destroying the hooks, Harry had joined in eagerly.
it behave?” Harry asked, when the silence had stretched on for several minutes and Malfoy gave no sign that he meant to continue.
Then he clapped Draco on the shoulder, grinned at Harry, and offered his hand to Hermione. The two said goodnight and wandered off to bed.
Harry spared one moment to thank the universe for the miracle that was Draco Malfoy – that this part of him had survived, that he had not been crushed beneath the weight of family and war.
It was not something Harry had ever expected to want. And perhaps that’s why he had needed Hermione’s help to see it.
Harry raised his eyebrows, but quickly relented. “Goodnight, Ron,” he said teasingly.
Harry held Malfoy’s gaze for another moment, then nodded at him. Malfoy blanched, but quickly recovered himself. He stepped forward and opened the door.
, he told it sternly.
“I added some honey and cinnamon to the butter before making the toast. I thought you could use the sugar.”
Malfoy smirked and chucked the apple at Harry before hurtling away.
“So what do we do now?” Harry asked. “How do we figure out what kind of magic feels like frozen hooks?”
“Yes,” Hermione said, nodding enthusiastically. “The book was quite definitive, and it referenced multiple sources. And once I had that piece of information, everything started to make sense.”
“I won’t,” Harry promised.
The rest of the week passed quickly, now that Harry and Malfoy were speaking again. With Malfoy by his side, chattering enthusiastically to Neville about the effect of herb categorization on distilling efficiency, Harry didn’t even mind the discomforts of the stifling hot classroom.
But there he’d stood, self-possessed and smirking in Harry’s kitchen, exuding an almost haughty confidence as he asked Harry to walk him home. It had been almost ridiculous, the arrogant manner clashing sharply with his threadbare pajama bottoms and the pale white of his bare feet splayed against the wooded floor. Still though, Harry had welcomed the echo of the boy Draco had once been. Harry liked the un-gelled hair and the new softness in his eyes, but a Draco Malfoy without a bite was just plain wrong.
“No?”
“You must really love it.”
Malfoy had hesitantly approached Neville only a few hours into the first class. Harry couldn’t quite hear what he said, but it seemed like he was asking Neville a question.
“Apparently.” Draco rolled his eyes and huffed in disgust. “Un-fucking-believable.”
Draco had scoffed when she said it, but perhaps one tiny part of him had believed in it, after all, one tiny sliver of his soul that thought maybe, just maybe, he and Harry were meant to be.
He let himself drip onto the bath mat for a moment, not wanting to track the damp onto the floor of his bedroom. But before he could take a single step, he heard a loud crack.
And well… walking into a forest to willingly die.
Draco crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows at her. The blatant attempt to bait him was unworthy of a response. But Maeve ignored his posturing.
“Do you have anything –” Mr. Zobinski lowered his voice and leaned over the counter toward Draco –
“Is this not what you were expecting?” she prodded, when George didn’t say anything.
Throat dry, Harry swallowed uncomfortably. The need to help Malfoy was nearly overwhelming, but Malfoy looked uneasy, almost… frightened, and the last thing Harry wanted was to scare him away.
“That’s sensible of you,” Draco said, mild tone at war with the pleased flush of his cheeks.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed out.
“N-no reason,” Draco said, self-consciously twirling the silver ring on his finger.
“Hello, Potter. Any luck with this yet?”
Pansy’s eyes narrowed, heavy eyeliner sharpening the glints of gold in her brown irises. She looked armed, almost dangerous, and it taunted Harry, made him want to draw his wand and fight. But that was an old reflex, one he no longer had patience for, and the urge stuttered out like a spark that refuses to catch.
Dazed, Draco blinked at the fire, the afterimage of Hermione’s face shimmering behind his eyelids. He shook his head and turned to Harry.
Harry nodded to himself. They had enough privacy, and this just might work.
“Malfoy!” Harry snapped.
“Sorry,” he mumbled. After a few more steadying breaths, he forced himself to walk back over to the table and sit down. “You know Ginny broke up with
His hand involuntarily strayed to his cock, gripping the base. He was already far too close.
Draco took a step back, surveying the shelf from more of a distance. He nodded to himself and turned to lean against the wall, arms crossed and a crooked little smirk aimed at Harry. The self-satisfied expression was so charming, and at such odds with the uncertainty in Draco’s eyes, that Harry’s head swam dizzily.
“Hello, Malfoy.”
may be unforgivably plain, and he may have almost burned down the shop while inventing it, but there was a part of Draco that would always love it too. It was the first thing he had ever made without magic, the first gasp of fresh air after clawing his way through the grief drowning him, the first time he let himself get really, properly curious about anything since the war. That had been a triumph in of itself, however unimpressive the flavor.
– a crisp green blend, with strong notes of basil and mint. He returned to the table and refilled his and Harry’s glasses. “I’m probably boring you.”
“I was reading them all morning, and I guess I just got overwhelmed. It was the same thing, over and over. All these people wanting a piece of Harry Potter, offering me things I didn’t earn, invasive questions, demands, guilt trips.” Harry sighed.
“Then the flowers aren’t evil at all!” Malfoy cut in, before Harry could even finish explaining.
The question shocked Harry into silence. Is that really what Malfoy thought? That Harry would only talk to him because he suspected something evil? The idea made him feel surprisingly sad.
Draco looked at Harry’s hand as if he had never seen it before. When he spoke, his voice was rough with emotion. “I never thought I’d have a choice. I knew I’d be lucky to be offered even one apprenticeship. But if I could have chosen anywhere, it would have been Hogwarts.” He looked up and touched Harry’s cheek hesitantly. “And if I could have chosen anyone, it would have been you.”
Draco’s fingers stilled, but he did not look up.
“Oh, hello Potter. Nice trousers, or whatever.”
“I wasn’t,” Harry insisted. “Are you going to sit down?”
“Mmm,” Draco breathed. “I like that it’s simple, in a way. The minions of the Dark Lord, they’re not human. They were created, bred from the evils of the world, specifically to serve the darkness. It’s easy to root against them – without having to wonder what hurts they have at home.”
Harry looked up, and Draco hesitated before setting the book down on the table next to him. He ran anxious fingers over the shaved side of his head, then folded his hands into his lap as if to stop himself from fidgeting.
“Draco?” he gasped.
Harry poured himself a glass of pumpkin juice and tucked in, content to simply listen as McGonagall and Draco chatted about the techniques Jaffey and Dahnroe had been using to study the residue on the grounds. Draco eventually admitted that he and Harry had briefly spied on the two Ministry employees, and then he looked on in astonishment as McGonagall chuckled.
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut. Tilting his chin, he pressed his lips to Draco’s palm. He worshipped the skin there, working his way down in a series of wet, open-mouthed kisses, lavishing attention on all the tiny bones of Draco’s wrist.
Harry sucked Draco in earnest now, hollowing his cheeks and bobbing his head to meet the hand that was stroking the base. Draco moaned wantonly and Harry felt a light tug as Draco tangled his fingers into his hair.
“It was the flowers,” Draco answered. There was a hint of wonder in his voice, the faintest brushstroke of color shining through the pain. “They were beautiful, Potter, just like the ones in the courtyard. I woke up covered in them. The vines were wrapped around my arms and there was blood everywhere, but the wounds were already closed.”
“Had an owl from George,” said Ron. “Want to try out his latest?” He held out a clear packet full of shiny hard candies. They were faceted like jewels.
Snapping out of his daze, Draco blushed, then tried to hide it with an exaggerated eye roll. “No, Potter, I think we have bigger problems right now.”
Harry inhaled sharply. Draco had called him by his
The glass doors to the display case shuddered in their frames, the sound familiar enough to grate on Draco, threatening his very tenuous grip on control. Maeve would be loading all the baked goods onto the trays inside the case, where they’d keep fresh as they awaited tomorrow’s morning rush. How many more nights did they have like this, chatting idly through the comfortable rhythms of closing up the shop? Draco pushed the thought away before his mind could begin the count.
“Did he apologize though?” Harry asked after a pause, not entirely convinced he wanted to know.
Draco nodded curtly, sunken eyes still fixed on Luna’s face. Harry thought she looked almost otherworldly laid out across the starched white sheets of the hospital bed, like an elusive creature you could never be sure you hadn’t dreamed. He was suddenly terrified she would fade away, dissolving before their eyes, insubstantial as mist.
McGonagall pressed a hand to her chest as her face went pale. “You cannot possibly be suggesting that these wands are – horcruxes?”
“I can’t believe I did that to you,” Harry choked out. “Malfoy, I am so sor–”
Lightning shot through Harry’s body as Malfoy caught him, lasting one blissful second before Malfoy grinned and shoved him backward into the tree.
. He didn’t want it to bite into his magic and freeze his blood. This was supposed to be harmless. Nothing more than an intellectual curiosity. A chance to wrap himself in color and beauty and the light of Malfoy’s eyes.
liked Malfoy’s waistcoat, not that he should have
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, the years you spent at Hogwarts were not kind to you, and I realize you did not often find allies among the staff.”
At the mention of the Department of Mysteries, Draco perked up, resurfacing from his mental fog. He frowned, but after a few seconds of rewinding the conversation in his head, he seemed to share Harry’s relief.
Harry shook his head. He finished the slice of toast, then wriggled a little deeper into the sofa. He huffed grumpily as his neck bent in an unpleasant angle.
Harry could see the vulnerability beneath Malfoy’s angry stance, and he softened slightly.
Malfoy looked up and frowned in confusion, but then he seemed to understand what Harry was offering. His face softened.
Harry sat up, disentangling his limbs from Draco’s. “The joke doesn’t matter, Draco,” he said seriously.
Draco’s eyes grew distant, so Harry kept quiet as they finished the tea. Draco delicately stirred the sliced cherries into the metal container. Lifting the mixture to his face, he inhaled deeply before adding a tiny pinch of a spice Harry didn’t recognize. Apparently satisfied, Draco popped the container into a larger metal box that Harry assumed must somehow dry the tea.
Just then, Draco dipped a pinkie into a cauldron that was peach-colored and glistening. He brought the damp fingertip to his mouth and lightly sucked. Harry almost knocked over the rack of vials. He swallowed hard, desperate to moisten his suddenly dry throat. He had a vague idea that tasting potions wasn’t entirely safe, but he brushed it aside. Draco knew what he was doing.
“Why do you think the Room of Requirement showed us all the bonds between us? If the apparition was only interacting with the life-debts, why not only show us those colors?”
Maeve sighed, dropping the sponge into her bucket with a wet plop.
They weren’t exactly
“Honestly?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
It was slow at first, Draco lifting up and sinking back down, watching Harry’s fluttering eyelids, following all the tiny muscle movements of his face. Harry was so beautiful, and his cock stretched Draco perfectly, filling him up, making him whole.
“Maybe,” he said with a frown.
“Yes,” Draco said, looking mildly exasperated. “I couldn’t
But now, Harry felt a twinge of regret. He wanted to go to Malfoy and take his hand, soothe the ache with gentle fingers.
“You did,” Harry insisted, but Draco ignored him.
“Alright then.” Harry nodded agreeably and took another forkful of pie.
“Hi,” Harry whispered against Draco’s mouth. “I missed you.”
“I may already be working on something like that,” Draco confided, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck.
His voice was a whisper, the last word as brittle as aged parchment.
“So hard for you, Harry.”
Harry remembered then, what it had been like watching Draco those first few weeks of school. He’d kept to himself, seeming almost fearful of the other eighth years, but he’d also been – settled. At peace with himself and his future in a way that Harry had envied, even if he hadn’t understood it at the time.
Draco picked at the remnants of his sandwich, pulling out a strip of bacon. He nibbled on it before responding grudgingly. “Yes.”
Harry must have dozed off, because the next thing he knew, Ron was kicking at his ankle and asking him for a game of chess.
Harry had reached the gate to the road before he realized Draco was no longer behind him. Turning back, he found Draco spinning in a slow circle, gaze locked on the greenery around him. His hair gleamed in the sunlight and an unconscious smile lit up his face.
Harry stared at him.
“No.” Harry put a hand to his temple, struggling to remember. “No, but the feeling was the same, in my chest. It felt empty – so empty it hurt.”
“Oi! Is this a thing then?” He was standing over Harry and Draco, gesturing between them. “You two?”
But anything Harry asked for would be too much, for it would mean far more to Harry than it possibly could to Malfoy. Harry couldn’t risk that, not when every touch – every glance, really – made Harry’s longing that much worse.
“She was so kind to me when I started coming to the shop. I thought she didn’t know who I was, what I’d done.” An expression of self-disgust marred Draco’s face, and he pulled his hands from Harry’s grasp. He rubbed at his eyes, almost as if he was trying to physically erase the moment of bitterness.
“Yes, Draco, it
Harry barked out a laugh, then let himself fall into the tub. He reclined next to Draco, legs hanging over the edge and arms behind his head.
, Potter!”
Draco clutched onto Maeve, hands tangling in her apron strings as he sobbed against her shoulder. It hurt his back to hunch into her like this, but he didn’t care. The cloth of her purple dress was soft against his cheek and she smelled of raspberry jam and vanilla.
The room was warm and cozy. Harry had slept in Malfoy’s bed every night for a week now, and every day a new comfort had appeared – a shaggy grey rug, thick and luxurious under his feet in the morning chill; an extra hook by the door where he could hang his robes; a second stool at the lab table; a larger wardrobe with several additional drawers; and most notably, a gorgeous red and gold blanket folded neatly on the foot of the bed.
Harry’s pulse thundered in his ears. “Yeah?” he managed, voice a rough croak.
“Cooking reminds me of what it feels like to brew,” he whispered, flexing his fingers. The bones actually ached, longing to grip his wand or a stirring rod.
Draco closed his eyes again, tilting his head up to catch the breeze. Outside the window, a squirrel chittered, and a corner of Draco’s mouth quirked at the noise.
“Yeah, but all physical. You attack and defend with your body instead of magic. I joined a Muggle club in Brixton.”
Draco’s gaze swept around the room with mild distaste. “If I remember correctly, your bathroom is much better equipped than mine, is it not?”
Draco kissed back hungrily and hooked his legs around Harry’s thighs. Harry rutted against him in an erratic rhythm – once, twice, three times, and then Draco began to tremble. He arched his back and cried out.
“Yes,” Draco said, seeming surprised that Harry had noticed. His fingers twitched toward his pocket, but he did not take out the notebook. Instead, he moved his hand to rest on Harry’s knee. “I’m sorry I’ve been so busy,” he said, giving Harry a little squeeze. “How’s your dueling?”
Harry dug the heels of his hands into his eyes and shook his head wildly, trying to clear it.
But why should he be afraid? Harry had been calling him Draco for weeks now.
Pansy shifted on the bench and adjusted her skirt unnecessarily. Harry’s lack of antagonism seemed to be unnerving her. With a quick glance to see if anyone was listening, she leaned toward him and hissed, “It was months ago, Potter! I was terrified.”
Guilt snaked its way across Harry, wrapping him in spiky tendrils. “I maybe shouldn’t have built it up so much.”
But then he waved instead, and turned his back on Harry to escape through the fire.
Harry mumbled something unintelligible and curled into himself tightly.
she mouthed to herself before turning back to Draco. Her eyes narrowed, coolly considering, but the corners of her lips turned up with a hint of approval.
“Hmm?”
Draco was stunned. He blinked at her before saying, slowly and deliberately, “I hardly think you, of all people, owe me any kind of apology about anything.”
“No, it’s brilliant,” Draco said. “I mean, I think it is. I haven’t tried any because it still needs to be dried.”
Draco hummed in thanks and began to clean his equipment by hand, washing rods and small bowls in the table’s built-in sink. Harry grinned (it was hours earlier than Draco normally finished) and reached for a cloth to help dry.
The air was cold enough to bite at their exposed skin, so Harry kept them sheltered with warming charms. Every so often, Draco’s foot would brush against Harry’s ankle or calf and he’d have to suppress a happy little shiver.
“And if the residue hurts you –” he started.
Hermione’s response was lost in a loud shriek of laughter from the sofa, but Draco was certain she was bubbling over with questions. And honestly, if he wasn’t so content to be half-dozing atop Harry, he’d likely be bursting at the seams with questions too.
This one's a bit of an emotional whirlwind. Please read with care, and check the end notes for content warnings and potential triggers.
This was about protecting his friends, he realized belatedly, and nothing more. It didn’t have to be another exploit for the aurors to fawn over.
The food smelled divine, perfectly seared steaks with a fragrant butter herb sauce and crispy potatoes. Harry must have used a stasis charm because everything was still steaming.
“Yes, but –” Draco attempted.
Words failed him then, so Harry clasped Draco’s hand and moved it to the crease of his arse.
The intensity of Draco’s thought seemed to coalesce into a living, breathing thing, hovering in the air around him. His fingers twitched at his sides as his eyes darted around the board, identifying and rejecting countless strategies before every move. Harry watched as the question of how to salvage Luna’s game set Draco’s blood on fire, and he marveled at the fierce beauty of this man he had once despised.
Malfoy gave him an incredulous look, but there was no anger in it.
“Not going well, I take it?”
“I felt – I felt like it was hopeless. That I’ll never escape the person I had to be to win the war, never be allowed to be something other than Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world.” Harry sketched air quotes with his fingers. “The letters make everything feel – I don’t know –
Maeve spoke quietly to Draco for a time, rubbing a hand soothingly up and down his arm. Draco was paler than normal and his eyes looked glassy, but he nodded along with what Maeve was saying, and he even huffed out a laugh or two. Finally, Maeve caught him up in a hug. They rocked back and forth for a moment before Maeve took Draco’s head in her hands. She smiled at him, kissed his forehead, and turned to step into the fireplace, dragging her magically lightened traveling trunk behind her.
in making me drink a cup of tea through the fire.”
and Harry pushed harder, almost daring to hope –
“Best place for it.” Draco shrugged, then added, “you can sit if you’d like.”
“Yeah,” Harry grumbled, “but that doesn’t make any sense! And what does that have to do with –”
“Ron!” Hermione scolded. She had picked up the spoon and was now brushing sugar off her blouse.
“And my sentence is seven,” Draco said firmly.
“Yes,” Draco answered nonchalantly.
“McGonagall got in touch with a few research institutes,” Harry added. “A bunch of books and scrolls should be arriving tomorrow.”
crushing the flower in his fist, but somehow it didn’t look like anger. No, Malfoy was clutching the bloom against his chest almost protectively, like he was afraid someone might try to take it away from him.
“Potter, why would one of these glass flowers grow at the Manor? There was no selflessness there, no acts of noble sacrifice.” Draco shook his head in irritation. “The book can’t be right.”
Draco was so bloody proud of him he almost burst. He might even have said so, if Harry had not continued.
It didn’t seem like Draco would be emerging anytime soon, so Harry strode off to the bedroom without a word. He returned with the pot that held the glass flower. Setting it prominently on the table, he settled in to wait.
“Yeah, so? For all we know there are flowers like this everywhere!”
“I asked you to,” Harry reminded him. “I didn’t know how to let you stay. Not yet.”
Draco could see the argument brewing in the slant of Potter’s mouth.
and yet at the same time miss his own mother so intensely that his skin actually burned. He thumbed at his ring and sighed.
“No, Draco,” Harry said quietly. “That’s all you.”
Draco cupped Harry’s face in his palms and kissed him tenderly. “Thank you,” he murmured. “This is a lovely first date.”
After a brief exchange in which Harry convinced Lavender to join the Brixton Kickboxing Club rather than relying solely on Harry to train her, Lavender hugged them both goodbye and rushed off to meet Parvati Patil for a late breakfast. Draco had been so shocked by the embrace that he stumbled and almost fell when Harry gently tugged him toward the door. Harry had laughed and kissed Draco’s cheek before twining their fingers together. They were outside and down the street before Draco even realized they had left the building.
“What?” Harry exclaimed. “But you were hurt!”
But Harry couldn’t settle. Something was bothering him, chipping away at the coziness around him until he could ignore it no longer.
and was part of the scheme. He wanted to drink tea with him in the morning and trace pathways of desire over his skin at night and while away their days with silly arguments.
“It’s not the potion,” Harry assured him, sitting up. “I’ve wanted it for a long time. I just didn’t know how to ask.”
Draco dropped his gaze as his cheeks heated. He quickly schooled his expression, but it was not enough to deter Blaise.
Harry thought again.
“Not that I’m not
“Well –” Harry hedged, as he felt his face heat – “I just assumed the Ministry took the Malfoy fortune.”
Without being asked, Harry grabbed a towel and spray bottle from the sink and cleaned the cherry juice from the counter. It would have been quicker with magic, but Draco had not used magic at any point while making the tea (not to mention his odd avoidance of healing spells) and Harry did not want to disrespect his process.
McGonagall stared down at them from the lectern, as stern and imposing as she had ever been, but as he and his classmates murmured their assents, Harry knew that he wasn’t the only one who felt bolstered by her belief in them; they all knew that the speech came from a place of sorrow and love.
Looking extremely flustered, Draco stuttered his thanks.
“You don’t owe that to anyone, Harry,” Draco said. “Not even war orphans.”
Draco shrugged. “Fine. But what about the Manor?”
“I didn’t think you had, Potter,” Draco scoffed, but the way he shook his head looked amused. He got to his feet and began to clear the table. “What were you planning to do about it?” he asked, looking over his shoulder as he dropped the plates into the sink. “Before I – when it was just you, I mean.”
As the kiss deepened, Harry slipped his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, fingers caressing the smooth skin over his spine. Draco lifted his arms, hips already moving in tiny thrusts, and Harry dragged the thin cotton over his head, tossing it aside before scrambling for the hem of his own shirt. Draco helped him tear it off, and then they were crashing back together, a desperate mess of hands and tongues and teeth.
Draco forced himself to take a full breath, and slowly, oh so slowly, he relaxed every muscle. He had fought against this for so long that it was almost impossible to surrender to it. But Draco allowed his eyelids to flutter open, and he settled his gaze on Harry.
Seeing the tired lines of McGonagall’s face, Harry felt a flash of guilt, and he had briefly wondered if they should have come to the Headmistress immediately after destroying those first few hooks.
“I probably should have talked to the healer more, about – about my nightmares and my childhood and stuff, but –” Harry broke off with a shrug. “Anyway, the point is, last night – well, I know what to do when I feel like that. I should have taken a few minutes to myself to calm down, and then we could have talked about it. But I let myself get out of control, and I was awful to you.”
“Yes, those fireworks! And so much
still reeling from the fact that Ron wasn’t all that bothered about Harry spending time with Malfoy. But aside from that, everything Luna and Hermione had said felt like a natural extension of the Malfoy Harry had been getting to know for weeks.
Despite the lengthy argument Harry had instigated last night, Draco had been adamant that Harry would stay behind at Hogwarts.
. I don’t want to hurt people for no reason, or to – to kill when I don’t have to. But if I can
, perhaps?”
“Hey,” Harry said softly. “You ok?”
Harry’s eyes were still on Draco, his face falling into shadow. He knew what Draco was thinking, and it was clear he no longer knew how to reassure him.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I can’t imagine how that felt.”
Harry moved his hands back to Draco’s hips to steady him and nodded. “Whatever you need,” he reminded him softly.
Draco smiled toothily. He lunged forward and kissed Harry smack on the lips, then launched in immediately. “We’re clearly not dealing with naturally occurring residue here. Everything that has happened contradicts what is recorded in Dark Magic books. But what if the Death Eaters
oh so slowly,
Weeks ago, when Draco had finally decided to submit the appeal application, he had told himself that it was ok, because he wanted to use his magic to do good. He would help people, invent new potions, put healing into the world instead of suffering, for once.
Draco looked windswept, everything about him carefully scrubbed away until he resembled a porcelain doll. Striking. Cold. Breakable.
“Why didn’t you send it?” Draco asked breathlessly.
“Almost,” Harry whispered, so as not to startle Draco.
Harry groaned softly, tugging at a particularly stubborn knot, and Draco’s pulse quickened. He imagined coming up behind Harry, running his hands over those toned thighs, lingering a moment on Harry’s arse, then continuing up his spine toward broad shoulders, mouthing at the back of Harry’s neck, feeling the heat of him through the thin cotton of his shirt.
“Alright,” Harry called, raising his voice to be heard above the din of the children. “Grab your broom and line up right here.” He gestured in front of himself. “No flying!” he added firmly when three of the larger kids hopped back on the frozen brooms. “Just walk over here, please. If you don’t follow my directions, you’ll have to sit out.”
“Ok, martial arts,” Draco said, the words sounding strange in a pure-blood’s mouth. Releasing Harry’s knee, he brushed the hair out of his eyes and smiled. “Would you be interested in learning more about martial arts? Its history, how it is used in different cultures, maybe different time periods even?” Draco’s words came faster, tone laced with excitement. “When you learn more about something, it opens pathways into other subjects, other things that might inspire you, and when you follow the research like that, you can find all these new things to be passionate about, things that give you new ideas and shift your perspective.”
Harry had been a breath away from kissing him, and Draco had ruined it. And Harry was still here, not bitter or hurt or angry, willing to give Draco anything he needed, without ever demanding anything in return, without ever taking more than Draco was ready to give. Harry was so
“Here,” the Unspeakable called back.
“Draco?”
Not that his life has changed all that much. Harry was slowly coming around to the idea that Hermione may have had a point, and that maybe he wasn’t quite as heartbroken as he should have been.
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably, then crossed the room to fetch a plate from one of the cabinets.
Hermione’s reply came so quickly Draco had trouble believing she’d even had time to register the question.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, voice soft and wavering. “That was unnecessary. I just – I don’t know what you want me to say.”
“Draco,” she asked, eyes sparkling, “is this your young man?”
“Sorry, what?” Harry said, scrubbing a hand through his hair.
Harry knew that if he wanted to excel at the Auror Academy, this was the type of coursework he should pursue in the coming terms. He even had a vague idea about focusing his interdisciplinary project on developing not-Aperiomancy as an intelligence gathering tactic.
Harry passed obligingly through the door and found himself in a meticulously organized storeroom. High shelves ran along the walls, each stacked with labeled wooden crates. Light spilled through another open door in the back corner, and Harry could hear the sound of a running faucet. He made his way toward it, grimacing slightly as his bare feet scraped against the cement floor.
Draco had done his best to meet Harry’s gaze without fear, his own feeble reassurance for his brash and beautiful Gryffindor, for he knew that Harry deserved far better than to be constantly at war against Draco’s many doubts.
Malfoy had gone right back to dueling, as if the interruption was hardly worth noting, but Harry had felt a warm pang in his chest, and his attacks weren’t quite so pointed after that.
The conversation was a good distraction. It repurposed Harry’s mouth, drowned out the echoes of his moans in Draco’s ears.
“No,” Maeve said cheerfully, eyes amused as she beamed up at him. She offered no further explanation.
Draco pulled his knees into his chest, resting his chin atop them as he gazed out across the garden. His lips were slightly parted, and though he was completely still, his entire body seemed to quiver on the edge of motion, as if his thoughts were racing through him, sparking in his veins. He was glowing with potential, a heartbeat away from discovery, a heartbeat away from bursting into flame.
motion.
“I led a flying lesson. It was a disaster at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quick.”
McGonagall looked directly at the few returning Slytherins as she continued. “And every single person in this room has done something good for our community.” McGonagall nodded once, formally acknowledging Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zabini, then swept her eyes across the rest of the room. “If I did not believe you deserved a place here, if I did not respect the decisions you have made in these past few months, then you would not be here. And so, this year, you will put aside your differences and work together. You will take care of each other. You will learn from each other. And you will set an example for the younger students of this school. You are the generation that will re-build the British wizarding world. I intend to make very certain that you are all up to the challenge. Am I understood?”
“It was hard,” Draco said haltingly. “In some ways, it was harder than the war. It was – nothingness, instead of something actively hurting me. Harder to brace for, you know?”
It troubled Harry though, that Draco had not told him. And he couldn’t ask him about it, not without betraying McGonagall.
Harry and Ron shared a long, wide eyed look. Ron broke first, lunging for the discarded sweets packet. As soon as he snatched it up, the wrapper transformed. Golden script unfurled across the newly vibrant packaging, jaunty letters proclaiming the candies to be “Mad-Eye Moodies.”
Draco shrugged again. “I deserve worse.”
If it hadn’t been for his Sentiomancy, Harry might have thought they were dealing with nothing more than a rather boring haunting, carried out by a mischievous (if uninspired) ghost.
Draco had been doing this a lot lately, when it came to Harry Potter – plunging heedlessly into seas he did not know how to cross. The shimmering water was a lure he could not resist, even knowing he would not allow himself to reach the beauty of the far shores.
That had been hours ago, hadn’t it? It was hard to gauge in the perpetual twilight of the common room, but Harry felt like a lot of time had passed. He must have fallen asleep. There was a book digging painfully into his neck and he felt groggy, almost drugged. Sleeping during the day was never a good idea for him.
By the time they started actually performing spells, Harry was cobbling together the most bizarre answers possible, trying to trick the professor into admitting Harry was incorrect.
As Ron plopped down next to him, Harry tossed a rock at the lake’s nearest ice floe and swore under his breath when he missed. (again.) Ron scooped a small stone from the pile Harry had gathered and pegged the ice floe dead center on his first shot. Harry scowled at him.
Then—
Harry’s bed wasn’t made to be slept in alone.
You can think of it sort of like a backwards memory charm.”
Draco Malfoy. Not that one. Anyone but that one.
He flips the larger of the two books open, settling into the armchair and balancing the book on his lap. The first few pages are an introduction, followed by the first chapter, which covers the alphabet, and Draco finds the chart for left-handed learners. He tries his best to mimic the pictures and memorize each sign, occasionally jotting down notes and reminders in the margins.
They’ve probably just gone back to sleep.
Draco Malfoy. Not
The screams go hoarse, no longer even words, before they’re gone completely. The potions from the broken vials mix and spread across the floor, until he’s standing in a small puddle, the acrid smell of it reaching his nose.
After what feels like hours of struggling to hold a conversation with Draco, Filius finally gives up trying to get names out of people (Cuthbert, as he does every year, is the only one who broke) and deems it an appropriate time for gifts.
He swallows and sits up, rubbing his neck where the warmth hasn’t quite faded yet. “Yes, quite.”
Even though he isn’t hungry, he slowly eats his breakfast, trying to delay the inevitable “conversation” with Agnes. He can’t imagine how any discussion can be had when one participant can’t understand the other. Nevertheless, when his tray is mostly empty, and he’s changed into fresh robes, he makes his way over to Agnes’s bed, diagonal from his own.
they need a partner.
After showering and dressing, he steps out of the bathroom to complete silence. He realises that Isabelle evidently won’t visit him with any of Draco’s belongings this morning. No clinking sounds, no soft pattering of her paws on the floor, and no purring.
Despite the pleasant warmth of the fire, the blurriness of the room and lack of a certain affectionate cat make him feel lonely all over again.
“Ready? Let’s go together, on three.”
“I don’t quite know what I want. But I’ll give it some thought and discuss it with Narcissa today,” he concedes, offering Soto a smile for her honest yet kind words.
brings him to full consciousness quickly, and a nagging thought that this has happened before.
, for no reason that he can even think of. Maybe it was his nerves finally catching up to him?
“Draco looks nice, don’t you think?” Neville asks with a smirk. Harry wants to scowl at him, and just barely refrains.
“The audacity you both have to suggest that a conversation with
And it’s that realisation that makes him wonder what’s stopping him from actually saying something to Draco. From everything Neville and Rosmerta say, and from Harry’s own tentative observations on it, Draco might even feel the same.
“Draco, I hate to break it to you, but your hands are so sweaty that it would be impossible for me not to feel them.”
“What’s the bad news?” he asks hesitantly. Bryn’s expression turns sympathetic. They put the chart aside and lean forward ever-so-slightly, as if wanting to reach out to Draco. The dread he’s been feeling since the beginning of the meeting peaks.
He glances around his study, at the roaring fire, the shadows thrown over the bookshelves and the armchairs. This evening’s tea is still on the coffee table. He’ll have to take the tray back to the kitchens later, but for now, he casts a few simple charms to do most of the cleaning. His company won’t mind.
Agnes shoots him a concerned look, and he smiles weakly at her in response, but doesn’t stop or say anything. He only wants to lay down and take a nap.
He rinses the shampoo from his hair and forces himself to think of nothing else for the rest of the shower, even when his fingertips accidentally catch over the jagged scars on his chest, and he scrubs his left forearm so hard it’s painful.
“I told her I’d think about it and discuss it with you,” he says slowly. “Should I have agreed?”
“Add three sugars,” Narcissa says immediately. Agnes laughs again, and he’s sure that she’s thinking something sarcastic.
Everyone’s curtains are closed, and Gileroy’s snoring is just audible over the rain. The rest of the ward is silent, even the newcomer, and Draco wonders if everyone else feels a heaviness in their chests too.
“In his shed. ‘Last-minute Christmas presents’, he said,” Ron says, nodding his head in Narcissa and Draco’s direction. Harry hums in understanding.
Potter snorts. “Yeah, sure.”
“Are those snitches?” Draco asks, squinting, and Harry rolls his eyes.
He’s reminded that part of the reason he became a teacher was to get away from the curious eyes of the public. He’d much rather have teenagers gossip about him with their friends than journalists write terribly invasive articles about his love life.
“You’ve got another shot when he leaves the room, at least,” he says, and Harry grimaces.
“Yes, it has,” Narcissa says softly. She hesitates before placing a hand on his shoulder briefly, her touch barely there before moving away. With one last smile and goodbye, she leaves him alone in his cubicle.
He eyes his journal with a frown, unfortunately still curious about the rest of it, but opts not to open it again. He’s seen enough. Too much, really.
He slips out of bed, sliding his feet into his slippers, and bends to scratch Isabelle’s chin as she drops the bag by his feet. Her fur is soft beneath his fingers.
Well into the evening, after taking dinner in his room and changing into his pajamas, Draco knocks on his door. Because of course he does. Harry stares at him when he answers the door, afraid that he might actually be gaping. Draco is still wearing his robes, lips pink.
The day was warm, and winds were prosy—
them before, but he puts them on anyway, and emerges from his bedroom to find Draco waiting by the fireplace with the jar of Floo powder.
A mistake is a mistake, Draco wasn’t even hurt by the potion, and Soto is certainly
He flips to a new page on his notepad, reaches for his quill, and starts writing a letter to Narcissa. He tries not to focus on how formal or informal he sounds, and very nearly writes “Narcissa” instead of “mother” at the beginning of the letter, but it’s not a disaster.
“I’m afraid that there’s little-to-no hope of regaining anything. The problem lies with the condition your brain is in. It’s very likely that you’ve undergone prolonged exposure to ill-intending magic. It’s caused permanent damage that will make it nearly impossible to reverse the charm. I’m truly sorry, Draco,” Bryn says, voice solemn.
“Harry. Hi,” Draco greets. Harry freezes, eyes widening.
Draco swallows roughly. Potter looks for all the world like this is exactly where he belongs, level-headed in the face of the crisis, guiding the others through it.
— and Harry shares a look of surprise with Draco.
— and pats Draco’s shoulder before heading back to the bar, likely to get his usual.
He draws his legs beneath him, cradling his steaming mug and sinking into the cushions, and Harry worries at his lower lip at the action. He looks so small, curled up that way, and Harry’s chest tightens with affection.
denser than the papers make him out to be.
“Harry?” Draco's voice is gentle, a little concerned, and Harry swallows roughly. He turns his gaze to the floor.
He squints through the soft light to see Isabelle, dragging a bag almost as large as she is through the door with her mouth. Her legs are on either side of the knobbly velvet sack, her gait awkward and adorable as she pulls it towards Harry. He chuckles at the sight.
“Sign language?” she asks, and Agnes nods enthusiastically. Draco makes a mental note to ask Narcissa about that later.
“Oh, a couple of games—”
There are still healers walking about the cafeteria, but none of them are even looking in Draco’s direction. He slips past the door, turning as he slowly pulls it closed.
He thinks about Potter's expressions, the tension in his posture, the way his eyes seem to burn any time Draco opens his mouth… No, definitely not cordial, he thinks, but maybe they
seen him eat — and Neville’s eyebrows are high when Harry sits beside him.
“Looking for the pointy blond one?” someone asks in his ear, and Harry jumps, turning to see George leaning against the railing and smirking.
He carefully rips the paper from the notepad and folds it, setting everything on the bedside table. He’ll give the letter to Soto later, when she brings lunch by. There’s not much else he can do about this until he gets a response from Narcissa.
And then, there’s the casual mention of whoever Gawain is. It seems like they used to be friends or at least friendly with each other, and Narcissa has to know who he is too.
Why would he send Narcissa a list of potion ingredients? He wanted her to give the list back to him eventually—but why? There’s something he should know about those ingredients, and for whatever reason, he didn’t find it necessary to include in the letter.
be, in time. They are “stuck” together, after all.
“That
Potter raises an eyebrow, aloof. “No.”
here.
, Agnes writes.
“Is that making sense?” Bryn asks gently, and Draco only nods in response. “This spell may take a while to gather all of that data. Probably ten or so minutes. You may feel a warm sensation in your head and neck, and that is completely normal, but please let me know if you feel any pain, alright?”
When they arrive at his quarters, Draco sets about making tea with such familiarity that it’s like he lives there. Harry doesn’t keep tea leaves like Draco — and certainly not as much of a variety — but Draco begins to make two cups of black tea without commenting on it.
“Yes,” he replies.
Draco eyes widen. “Yes, of course. But how? And what do you mean by ‘view’?”
“How do you feel?” Bryn asks, a note of concern in their voice. Draco tugs on the sleeve of his robes and looks away, because truthfully, his thoughts keep going back to Potter—his ever-unruly hair, his concern for Rose, the gleam in his eye as they fought side-by-side as teens…
Harry loves Draco.
Soto’s office door is closed, so Draco turns to take a seat on the sofa across the room, and—even though he knows she’s there—startles at the sight of Rue. She’s pressed into the corner of the sofa, knees drawn up to her chest, looking incredibly small as she stares at Draco. Her eyes are glassy and far away, and Draco tenses as he sits with as much distance between them as possible.
“We’ve missed you too, mate,” Ron says sincerely, eyebrows furrowed a bit. Hermione sets aside her book, slipping her bookmark in before turning to face Harry, eyes curious. It’s the same look she gets when a theory is turning in her mind.
Their voices grow too soft to hear from across the ward, and Draco mulls over what he
Well into the evening, once lunch has been eaten and dinner is prepared, the beginnings of a headache creeps up on Harry, and he retreats to the garden. He sits on the porch steps, casting warming charms to melt the snow, and relishes the quiet.
the letters embossed in tight cursive. The lip of the lid is decorated with shimmering leaves.
He looks around his small cubicle at the off-white curtains and walls, his green armchair, neatly-made bed, and the hundred-or-so newspapers on the floor. It’s all very neat and clean, and could certainly pass whatever standards Narcissa might have.
“Yes. This batch of Skele-Gro is almost done brewing.” He has a slight smile on his face, and it makes Harry want to smile, too.
He runs over the words he wrote, processing them, trying to line up the events in the journal with the little information he’s learned from old
she writes carefully.
It’s all very strange, but Draco tries to push aside any awkwardness that he might find because of it. She looks up when Draco nears her bed, brown eyes brightening and whiskers twitching in recognition, her mouth curving into an almost-smile. It’s difficult to tell for sure, but Draco gives her a small smile in response.
Gilderoy was admitted before any of them, all the way back in 1993, and it doesn’t surprise Draco that Gilderoy took his own memories by accident. He tries to tell himself not to discredit Gilderoy over his
The files are sorted by surnames, and fortunately, Draco knows everyone’s apart from Rue’s. It’s a little frustrating that he won’t be able to find hers with the amount of time he has, but he focuses instead of the ones he
The snake continues to hiss and writhe. The burning intensifies until Draco’s vision starts to blur from his tears. He clutches his wrist, willing it to stop,
“Happy Christmas, Ron.”
“Maybe,” she says vaguely. “Your mother is visiting today, yes?”
Bryn sighs softly.
Fucking hell.
Potter sucks in a breath.
“Go talk to Agnes. She’s very sweet if you look past the fur,” Soto advises, not unkindly, making her leave once Draco concedes to go talk to Agnes.
His loneliness ebbs and flows in his chest, needing something to do with his hands to distract himself from it. Not wanting to go to breakfast like this, he begins to clean his quarters by hand — the way Draco sometimes does when he has something on his mind.
Finally. He was getting impatient.
Draco raises his eyebrows—Agnes can leave the ward if she wants to. He wonders if she knows that. It seemed, at least to him, that no one could leave the ward.
Hands shaking slightly, he unties the leather cord, lets it fall onto his lap, and opens the journal to the first page.
He thinks for a moment, fiddling with a loose thread on the sleeve of his robes. Based on everything he’s learned about who he was, he’s not even sure he actually
Rosmerta cackles —
The complicated mix of feelings he’s had about his name dissipate upon hearing it spoken by Potter—like he never needed to worry about whether he’s Draco

His curtains rustle, drawing him from his thoughts as Healer Soto steps in with a tray of food. She eyes the stacks of newspapers on his bedside table with pursed lips, but doesn’t mention anything about the mess as she places the tray on Draco’s bed.
, he can’t even pretend that his feelings for Draco are just platonic anymore.
He has a distinct feeling that she didn't.
Their lips brush. Draco’s short breaths come quick over Harry’s cheek. Until —
“Help!” someone in the ward screams, the sound horrible and agonized and pleading, jolting Draco from sleep with a gasp.
“No, no, that’s for Percy,” he explains, easing back into the seat and pulling off his gloves. Neville lets out a relieved sigh, and Harry gives him a significant look with his next words. “Anyway, you aren’t supposed to know that I drew Draco’s name, remember? Filius would have our heads if he knew I told you… and who knows, he could have spies on us
“Are you okay?” Potter asks, hands still outstretched slightly, as though afraid Draco might stumble again.
If you would like to avoid the (somewhat) graphic vomiting scene in this chapter, skip about six to eight paragraphs once Draco enters the bathroom. It's essential to know that it happens, but this doesn't spoil anything. :)
“I’m trying.” Draco says. He hears Potter’s sigh, and it sets him off laughing again, trying to stifle the sound with his free hand—until Potter is laughing too, and between the two of them, they could wake the entire ward.
that Draco Malfoy,” the green-eyed man says. “Look at your arm if you don’t believe me. You’ll see, the Dark Mark will be right there.”
Potter raises his eyebrows, incredulous. “You’re actually bringing that up right now? You’re more stubborn than I thought.” He almost sounds impressed. “It was a calming spell.”
“Oh yes, just put them on my desk, love,” she says quickly, waving her wand towards her office. Her hand is shaking violently, making the door swing open faster than necessary, and Draco frowns. He doesn’t ask about it, though, just letting out a relieved breath that Soto didn’t hesitate to allow him inside her office.
“Ferret,” he mutters under his breath.
“I can assure you, it was,” Potter replies, tone oddly restrained. Draco eyes him suspiciously—and now
“What’s with the robes? You never wear anything like this,” Hermione says, peering over her book and eyeing him appreciatively. Harry clears his throat.
Draco listens as Lockhart talks to Agnes beyond his curtains, the words lost on him, but he lets out a grateful sigh when she finally stops barking. Gilderoy isn’t all that bad, at least.
Draco stares at Potter, eyes wide, until the memory fades into nothingness. He recalls Potter’s words about them being stuck together, and it sends him reeling.
It would be easy to keep reading through newspaper after newspaper, trying to trigger memories and regain his old life.
Seeing the little tea shop inspires a few less-than-fond memories of his fifth year, but it was ages ago, and he’s since made better memories of the place with Draco.
“Do you happen to have any books on sign language?” he asks, knowing that’s not what Narcissa was thinking of when she offered her help, but curious enough to ask anyways. She just an eyebrow, looking amused.
“I’ve been worried about her lately. I think she could do well to be around people this Christmas,” he says.
“Draco, are you working in your lab today?” Neville asks, voice light. Harry leans in curiously for Draco’s response, momentarily taken from his offence at Neville’s scolding.
He sighs and turns his focus to washing his hair. He tries not to think about anything except what he’s doing as he soaps up.
“I’ll pencil it in,” he says sarcastically, and Potter grimaces. Really, he wears everything on his sleeve.
Draco’s name on his lips, Draco’s hair in his hands, Draco’s face buried in his neck.
“Thank you,” he says, leaning closer to the bed to get a better look at the tray. To his disappointment, it’s only a simple sandwich and chips. They’re probably not even salted, because they never are—and they didn’t provide any on the side this time, either. Draco deflates, shoulders slumping.
Harry’s lip quirks. “From?”
“I’m perfectly serious. But I can’t give it to you until I know what you’re doing to do with it,” she says. Draco licks his lips.
Draco tries to scoop everything back into the bin as quickly as possible, the contents mostly candy wrappers and broken quills, but a crumpled up piece of parchment grabs his attention.

I said ”Twill keep’—
Potter leads him to one of the small rooms near the staircase that Draco noticed a few days before. The plaque beside the door is labelled 4B, he notes, and Potter knocks before he pushes the door open. Potter gestures for Draco to enter, and he does, nervously.
important.
The next two days bring rain and listlessness as Draco waits for Narcissa’s response to arrive, spending his time going over sign language and the case. His mood is worsened by the fact that he hasn’t really interacted with anyone since Potter became his healer, and he’s starting to miss the friendly banter with Agnes and Gilderoy.
“Where did you get that?” Potter asks, voice low and suspicious. Draco resists rolling his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Saturday. Christmas morning.
He obliges Narcissa, adding three sugar cubes, already liking it more just from its scent. He sips it, feeling the warmth of it in his chest and smiles.
Harry falls asleep easily tonight.
Bryn grins. “Glad to hear it. It’s quite a show to see it in use, and I think you’ll like it. If you will, lay back on the table, and we can begin.”
“Draco, I’ve seen your pants — I know what’s on them. So you can’t even
Minerva, who’s three drinks deep already. She’s flushed, and her eyes are a little glassy, but otherwise, she holds herself pretty well. She keeps trying to nudge Harry in Draco’s direction, and Draco notices almost as soon as she starts doing it, so Harry makes his escape quickly.
“You don’t remember me, do you?” Potter asks softly, and the unexpectedness of the question startles Draco into meeting his eyes.
The Three Broomsticks hasn’t changed much since Harry was a student. It’s still smoky, frequented by the same patrons — Harry, Neville, and Draco now part of that group, he thinks with a smile — and Madam Rosmerta is still running the place. She smiles at him from behind the counter, and they nod to each other by way of greeting.
Realizing they’ve been staring at each other for entirely too long, he says the first thing that comes to mind: “Hi, Narcissa.”
Whatever the case, it won’t hurt to ask Narcissa if she knows the significance of the potion ingredients. Maybe he could ask to borrow a potions book, as well, and pass it off with Soto as trying to spark a few memories.
With a sigh, he folds the letter up and tucks it under the stack of newspapers. On the top of the stack is the next issue of the
Once Isabelle leaves him, everything is quiet and empty. He misses the soft sound of her paws pattering on the floor the second she’s gone.
The corners of Potter’s lips turn down. After an uncomfortable moment, he lets out a breath.

The curtains are pulled aside, Agnes' fluffy face and brown eyes coming into view, and she lets out a loud, happy bark upon seeing him.
Something dawns on him, slowly, a realisation that's been coming on for years, and — maybe, he’s never understood what all those looks have meant, until now. He may not be the best at romance or feelings, but neither is Draco, and something tells him that maybe he’s not the only one who’s been yearning all this time.
He stares for a moment at the off-white curtains around his bed, trying to recall anything about what happened and why he’s here. He’s only able to conjure up hazy memories of hurriedly scrawling his name at the end of a short note, sending it off with an owl during a storm, and a grim-looking man in red.
. Tell me you didn’t get him a
Draco walks along the opposite wall from Wagner’s office as he nears the entrance of the ward, practically pressing his body against the wall, nervous that Wagner will somehow see him leave. The glass in the office doors are opaque and lettered with the healers’ names, and he knows from Soto’s office that they’re not easy to see through, but he doesn’t want to push it.
this and not get caught. He has around ten minutes until the trainee healers will enter the ward and poke through everyone’s curtains to make sure no one is dying—and then Healer Parson will arrive and make her rounds around the ward.
He’s interrupted by a sharp knock on his curtains. Draco sets the book aside and glances at the clock—lunch time—and knows it’s undoubtedly Potter on the other side of his curtains.
The fire casts shadows over Draco’s face, throws his eyes into darkness, and Harry wishes he could see them. But then again, he’s not sure he could handle whatever look is in them right now.
exactly did he let himself do that?
I know this chapter was kind of different, but I hope it was enjoyable anyways! (Also yes I know this was kind of early to post, but it's 12am where I live so it's TECHNICALLY Monday. No complaints!! Only hugs.)
Agnes grins, stepping aside and gesturing for him to enter. He does, but stops when he sees an unfamiliar person sitting beside Agnes’s bed, dark hair and a gaunt face, eyeing him suspiciously. It’s clearly the new patient.
He takes a moment to think over their words. He doesn’t understand how the spell
Draco frowns, shakes the thought away, and tries to focus on the book on his lap. He’s still trying to learn how to sign the letter K, even though it’s not necessary to know at the moment. It really only bothers him because his hand doesn’t want to move that way.
I held a Jewel in my fingers—
So, of course, Draco rips off his sheets to remake his bed.
The breath leaves Draco’s chest. He never thought he’d have to
He dresses with unhurried movements. Isabelle, a ragdoll cat that isn’t his, watches him with narrowed, keen eyes.
Draco frowns. This close, he can see just how thin Potter is under his hand-me-downs, to the point that it’s concerning, and he’s very nervous. It makes Draco’s stomach turn over; he has of course read mentions about Potter’s childhood in
For a moment, Draco almost doesn’t want to remember that, thoughts darkening when he considers what must’ve happened to him.
“Mr. Malfoy?” the trainee asks through the door. “Are you okay?”
“Now, off with you,” he says affectionately. She hoots and spreads her wings, launching off her perch. She lands on his shoulder for a brief moment, then flies off into the storm.
Draco pretends to think about it as Soto regards him with an amused expression.
Draco stares at them in amazement. That’s
It’s dangerous, surrounded by potential enemies, not knowing who's an ally, and not even having a wand. Draco doesn’t know why or how he’s going to do it, but he will.
“Harry! Ferret-face!” Fred greets, throwing his arms wide. George rolls his eyes, and Draco scowls when Harry laughs at the name.
“Oh, right,” he starts. “The memory specialist will be here around five. I’m staying overnight, so I’ll be here to introduce you to them.”
He raps softly on the pole holding Agnes’s curtains when he reaches her cubicle.
He blinks, almost wondering if he’s hallucinating. He finally decides that no, he isn’t, and it would be rude to ignore her. So he smiles gently at her, before stepping up to the doors.
“Potter. This child was caught in the fire,” memory-Draco says, voice carrying over the shouts in the room. Potter turns his sharp gaze upon memory-Draco and the child, and his eyes widen. His composure breaks.
But Potter doesn’t reply, and the question hangs between them, heavy and painful. He looks Draco up and down—at Draco’s hair, which probably doesn’t look combed, to his dirtied slippers, to the wrinkles he didn’t manage to smooth out on his robes.
— because it seems that he’s trying to subtly put ideas in Harry’s head. Or maybe even Draco’s.
Harry’s stomach does strange things at Draco winking at him, and he pinches the bridge of his nose just to have an excuse to close his eyes.
“What did you do to poor Draco?” Neville mutters, and Harry laughs, but he’s a little concerned, once Draco takes a spoonful of porridge that he didn’t even add any sugar to.
Bryn smiles and tilts their head. “Of course. I’m not going to do anything that you’re uncomfortable with. If you asked me not to, then we would skip to the next step of today’s meeting.”
Harry licks his lips and turns his eyes to Draco’s forehead.
He opens his mouth to ask if Draco wants another cup, but the words die in his mouth when he sees that Draco is asleep, chin resting on his hand. Warmth floods through Harry at the sight, and the simple fact that Draco could even fall asleep like that in front of
It's calming—just him, and the rain—and things don’t seem
Draco doesn’t try to eat his breakfast when it comes. He leaves the tray on his bed, taking a set of fresh robes before stepping outside of his cubicle. He looks out the large window for a few minutes, the early morning light soft and grey, dark clouds forming and a few droplets of rain randomly hitting the glass.
“I’m taking over as your healer,” Potter repeats, and Draco scowls at the hard tone of his voice.
“N—Mother, this Agnes. Agnes, this is my mother,” he says. Narcissa smiles gently at Agnes, and it occurs to Draco that they’re likely near the same age.
And despite the way his chest tightens at the thought of potentially uncovering more about his past, he supposes he’ll have to start asking questions eventually.
The smile falls from Draco’s face when he unfolds it to see a familiar spiky script, reading:
An unfamiliar mix of feelings swirls in Draco’s chest, and for once while thinking about Potter, he smiles.
“How black and white,” he mutters, tone venomous. Potter’s nostrils flare.
Hmm. Yes, he must have been.
Draco’s stomach turns over. He has to turn his gaze away, unable to stand the sight of that wizard. He knows the only person that can be is Lord Voldemort, despite the fact that there weren’t any pictures of him in the
Draco closed his eyes and imagined constellations spinning above him, their ethereal light infecting him with a longing he could not shake.
Draco had more of a sweet tooth than he ever would admit, and Harry longed to indulge him. All week, he’d been daydreaming of the holidays. It was only mid-November, but their prolonged battle with the hooks had taken its toll. Harry was more than ready to spend a few carefree weeks plying Draco with sugar and seeker games and sex. He didn’t know if Draco would want to spend the school break together, but he hoped. He played with recipes that would tempt Draco’s palate, and he hoped.
George and Ginny glared at each other a moment longer, George throwing a pointed look over his shoulder at Harry that made Ginny bristle. Harry found that – unsettling, to say the least, and was just trying to figure out if he should somehow intervene when Arthur burst into the room.
“Does your mother use magic for everything she makes?” he asked breathily. “Does she have any of her own special cooking spells? Does she do anything purely by hand?”
“I understand,” Draco murmured. His shoulders were hunched and he had lowered his head. “You were angry. You needed space.”
And when Harry leaned forward to kiss him, Draco smiled against his lips.
“No more heartache, ok?” Harry whispered.
But when he reached the back door of the cottage, he found Ginny sitting on the steps, hat damp with rain, her cheeks flushed from the cold.
“Ah,” Potter said, a grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Is it poisoned?”
I’m not certain why.”
It was over in seconds.
Harry supposed they shouldn’t have been surprised. What they were attempting – well, it wasn’t how the Room normally worked. Served them right to get a weird, horror movie-esque experience in response. He huffed out a laugh at that, and Draco gave him a strange look.
Harry stared up at the shelf for a long moment, eyes flickering between the three books at its center. “Draco, are you trying to
A wave of heat rushed over Harry as his temper flared. For one wild moment, all he could see was the sneering face of Lucius Malfoy, a man who had poisoned his son’s future so thoroughly that he may as well have salted the earth.
Draco looked more flustered than Harry had ever seen him, but he swallowed hard and said hoarsely, “My hair, huh?”
Malfoy’s shoulders stiffened, but he did not stop, and he did not look back.
“You haven’t seen him kickbox before, then?”
“Lube,” Harry said miserably. “In that drawer.” He pointed without looking up.
“Er – yeah,” Harry said, almost entirely distracted by Draco’s glancing touches. “It’s a kind of martial arts, I guess.”
“Has all of this meant nothing to you?” he asked in disbelief.
“I knew Evan,” Draco said quietly, spinning his silver ring. “How is he?”
“Something like that,” Blaise replied breezily, brushing off the implication, but Draco noticed his eye twitch, an intriguing little tell.
And Harry unfroze.
“They’re going to be just fine,” she assured them. “There is extensive damage to their cores, but that we can heal.”
Draco stiffened, crushing the scone he was holding. Trust Maeve to instinctively know that his aching face was not the part of his misadventure that weighed most heavily. Wincing slightly, he attempted to re-shape the damaged scone. “Not – not exactly.”
Harry and Draco had waited too, their own silent vigil for the flowers - though the loud and frantic theorizing of the Ministry team infringed upon their grief. To Harry, it had felt as if the harried shouts were desecrating a grave.
Harry peppered kisses along Draco’s cheekbones until he went still. Then Harry thrust twice more and came, his orgasm shuddering through him so forcefully it almost hurt.
“Ok?” Harry asked.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but didn’t otherwise press him. He scrubbed at a ladle that looked unpleasantly sticky and simply waited for Harry to be ready to continue.
There was a pause.
“No, it’s ok. I –” Harry shook his head incredulously. Relief danced in the tips of his fingers. “I’m just surprised. It seems a bit fast, but –” he trailed off.
“– don’t have much time before my next meeting, but I wanted to stop by with a quick update. My research has yielded several promising new leads.”
After a few minutes, when Harry’s skin was no longer damp, Draco wrestled off his own jumper and threw it at Harry. He quickly made sure his shirtsleeves were buttoned, then fetched the blanket he’d been using and wrapped it snugly around Harry’s legs.
There was a stunned silence. Draco hugged his arms to himself so tightly that it made his stomach hurt.
Malfoy shrugged. “I was annoyed you could do it and I couldn’t,” he admitted. “You didn’t even understand Aperiomancy this morning! It was infuriating.”
Despite everything he knew about Lucius Malfoy, Harry was shocked. “That’s horrible.”
Harry felt tears rise in his throat. “Malfoy –” he said thickly.
Biting back the impulse to argue, he took a minute to think about that, to really think about what Ginny was saying. And then he realized – he had run into Draco exactly four times between speaking at his trial and the first apparition incident, and he could vividly recall the details of them all. Thirty second interactions, if that, every one, and yet Harry remembered the lines of Draco’s face, the subtlest shifts of expression, the color tie he’d been wearing, the flash of his eyes as he’d nodded hello.
“There’s a spell he uses to visualize the physical effects of his products,” Harry said. “It shows what’s going on inside the body, I think. It’s usually used for healing.”
Across the room, Harry could see several confused stares from the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. And Parkinson was glaring at him, looking murderous. Zabini, on the other hand, appeared to be delighted. He was beaming and elbowing Parkinson wildly.
The tension snapped, and Harry didn’t answer for a moment, unsettled by the abrupt shift. He felt shaken by the entire encounter. But then he shook his head. “I feel like we’re doing this backwards,” he groaned. “Can you explain the resonance thing again?”
The words seemed to take on a life of their own, clamoring around Draco, clawing at his face, making him want to mask himself in indifference – a bitter, if necessary, armor. But Draco resisted the impulse, knowing Harry would never shame him for his pain.
“Fuck,” Harry said emphatically. “I can’t believe I haven’t told you!” He shook his head, furious with himself. He’d been trying so hard not to think about the darkness at the center of the flowers, and what it might be doing to his friends, that he had forgotten about the one genuinely good thing he hadn’t yet shared with Malfoy.
There was a heavy pause. Harry kicked at a clump of dirt by his feet.
Why treat Malfoy like that, if it wasn’t about the war? The war was supposed to be
hurts.
Draco chortled, the laugh bubbling up from deep in his belly. “I can imagine.”
His heart clenched at the sight of the shutters, piercingly blue against the warm grey wood they had agreed on for the outside. Draco had insisted on the bright azure, arguing that they’d always have a bit of their own clear sky on cloudy days.
“You are an extraordinary person, Draco Malfoy. And I am not the only one who sees that.” Maeve reached out and clasped his hand in both her own. “There is more in this world for you than tea and regret. Don’t you ever forget that.”
But Draco could not keep living like this. He was tired,
Harry gasped and bolted upright.
Hermione’s head whipped up. “Harry,” she demanded, “the night of your dream – was that the first bad dream you had since Ginny left?”
When he looked back up, Ron was watching him with a sly smile. “Besides, didn’t Ginny break up with
“Sorry,” Harry said again, shying away from Draco’s fierce expression. “I can go.”
Concerned, Harry moved toward Draco, only to stutter to a shocked halt when he caught a glimpse of what lay beyond the rocky ledge. White nothingness stretched in all directions, the cave and its cliffside floating in an otherwise blank canvas, the painting unfinished. In the distance, darkness seethed, a tiny spot threatening to grow. Harry knew that in the center of it, there would be a dead body, drenched in blood.
“Because you knew I wouldn’t let you do it alone, no matter how I felt about it,” Draco said, still more question than statement, even though he was nodding.
Harry shrugged. “Unless you’d rather see if Maeve could set up a three-way fire-call for us.”
McGonagall gave him a long, appraising look. “That’s very interesting, Mr. Potter,” she said. She stood and began ushering them out. “You might consider becoming a Hogwarts teaching fellow next year. An innovative curriculum proposal is part of the application.”
“Probably,” Draco said, laughing. “There isn’t anything that woman can’t do.”
Draco fidgeted with his ring as one of the club’s employees addressed the crowd, explaining that the final match of the day would highlight one of their adult students. He went on to speak about their adult program, and how one-on-one work with a trainer could challenge and support adult beginners.
“It doesn’t,” Harry assured him. “Is that what that notebook is for?” he asked, nodding toward Draco’s pocket. “To write down experiences?”
Harry flushed, with irritation rather than embarrassment for once. “Believe me? Malfoy, you ran away!”
Blaise withered at that. He was twice the size of Draco, but he suddenly seemed small. It was almost enough to make Draco relent. Almost.
McGonagall’s gaze rested on Harry when she said that last bit, and maybe he should have felt slighted or singled out, but all he felt was
They were well and truly tangled up in this thing, and the taste of Harry’s name on his tongue could hardly make the inevitable loss any
Harry cracked first. “I’m sorry,” he offered, not meeting Malfoy’s eyes.
There was a loud thump, and Harry clapped a hand to his forehead, cursing at the sudden burst of pain. He looked up and saw that he had collided with the corner of his wardrobe.
“I just wish I had understood,” Harry sobbed brokenly, struggling to gulp back the tears. “You needed help. I wish I had seen that. I wish I had seen
But Draco didn’t seem happy. His eyes were bright with discovery, but there was something dark and wary beneath. He looked haunted, despite his growing hope.
George cleared his throat. “I did think we might get a glimpse of the life-debts, and I was pretty sure I could untangle the potion residue from them, if we were right about that being the problem. But this?” He paused to wave a hand between Harry and Draco. “I don’t even know where to start.”
Draco gasped, and his hips jerked. He tilted his head back, exposing the pale white of his throat. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, struggling to form words.
“Look, Malfoy, I know you don’t want to talk about the Manor –” Draco’s shoulders tensed and he started to pull away. Harry tightened his grip and hurriedly continued - “and I’m not asking you to. But I – I know terrible things happened to you there. I know you were trapped and forced to do things you didn’t want to do, and I know you were around Dark Magic all the time. I didn’t want to do that to you again. I didn’t want you anywhere near those spells.”
to forgive myself? You saved the entire fucking world, and you
A sick fear skittered across Harry’s body, slicing through him like dead leaves scraping harshly against the pavement. He felt goosebumps rise on his arms in the sudden chill.
Potter frowned, unconvinced, but he nodded reluctantly. “I really am sorry.”
“Sometimes the simple things are the hardest to master,” Draco retorted. “I’ve never managed to cook steak half so well as this.”
Harry cried out, unconsciously spreading his legs wider. Draco hummed against his mouth before breaking the kiss. He pulled away, gaze locked on Harry’s face as he pushed just the tip of his finger inside.
Harry finished, nodding excitedly.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “Me neither.”
Harry ached to stand up for Malfoy, but he wasn’t sure Malfoy would appreciate the gesture. Harry had been watching him, and his approach to conflict seemed to be to disengage. Malfoy accepted the sneers thrown his way and moved on, head down. He was polite and quiet and did not stand up to anyone (though thankfully, there wasn’t much need for that among the eighth years, who seemed content to leave Malfoy alone).
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, as Draco was crawling back into bed.
Harry was standing at the edge of the mat, pulling on his gloves. He caught Draco’s eye and beamed up at him, radiant as the sun. Draco gave him a little wave and Harry winked, before turning back to his trainer, who seemed to be offering some last-minute advice.
The word crystalized against Draco’s lips like sugar, sparkling in the intensity of his awe. His mouth had fallen slightly open and there was a dark flush high in his cheeks.
“It was like your guard was down, you know?” Harry added. “Like I could see
“Huh,” Maeve said casually. “I’m not sure that would work.”
Harry shivered, silently wishing for another chance to see Malfoy in a suit and waistcoat, fantasizing vaguely about what it would be like to slip his hands beneath the jacket and draw it off Malfoy’s shoulders.
Malfoy had risen during his tirade and was now looking around himself almost self-consciously. He huffed out a breath upon seeing they were still alone, and then began storming away toward the castle.
“Oh really?” The grin Blaise gave Draco then had something peculiarly close to triumph in its edges. Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“I’m fine, Professor,” Harry assured her, ignoring Draco grumbling obscenities at his side. He brushed some snow off his sleeves. “No harm done.”
Their eyes met then, and Harry’s shy smile was so at odds with the wild, debauched look of the rest of him, that Draco could not help the breathless laugh that escaped. Eyes sparkling like the sun, Harry collapsed backward, pulling Draco with him until they were cuddled together in a tangled, sated heap.
The caution and uncertainty in his voice went straight to Harry’s heart. Pushing himself off the doorframe, Harry moved to Draco and caught him by his elbows, tugging him gently forward.
“I don’t think it’s anything you did, Harry,” Hermione said gently.
“Professor Lupin, actually. Remus.”
Harry was kneeling in front of him.
Harry looked away, overwhelmed for a moment by a pang of sadness. He found himself wondering if this was who Malfoy was supposed to be, who he could have been, were it not for Voldemort. And then Harry remembered sixth year, when Malfoy had devoted his mind to darkness instead of flowers. He remembered the vanishing cabinet, and Death Eaters in the castle, and… and then he stopped. They had all made choices, both good and bad. Malfoy was no exception.
It was a display of raw, unfettered Hogwarts magic the likes of which they had never seen. It should have been beautiful, wondrous even. But it wasn’t.
Draco’s tears stopped, giving way to a series of quiet moans. His legs trembled, his hands and toes curling up tightly. Harry saw the moment when the darkness let Draco go. He arched his back, and the lines of his face softened as he opened his eyes and stared up at Harry, the deep grey pools reflecting nothing but trust and love.
A beleaguered sigh escaped Harry, but then he nodded and closed his eyes, muscles gradually relaxing as Draco rubbed soothing circles into his head and neck.
Neither spoke.
The sky blue light was their love, written on the air. It was beautiful.
“We are having a seeker game, right now,” Malfoy announced. “Fetch your broom, Potter.”
Harry blanched, horrified at the implication. “No! Professor, no, not like that,” he rushed to correct her. “It’s not his soul, just an echo of his magic. Like his own residue.”
Harry grinned crookedly. “Yeah?”
“Yes,” Harry whispered intimately, stroking Draco’s cheek.
But Harry caught his hand and spun him around for one final kiss.
Hermione brushed back her hair, eyes thoughtful. “You should go ask him.”
Quite unexpectedly, Harry’s heart fluttered.
But it was not a rainy morning.
punishment. McGonagall told me because she was worried I’d show up at the Ministry for you, scream at some people. Get you in trouble.”
“Right. Bugger this,” Harry said aloud. He threw on a jumper and strode from the room.
“But what about those colored lights?” Draco muttered to himself, one foot tapping against the cracked sidewalk as he began to spin his ring.
As the fire popped and crackled, Draco had taken Harry apart, worshipped him with lips and tongue and clever fingers, whispering
Heart fluttering erratically in his chest, breath ragged and quick, Harry practically tore his clothes off. Unable to wait a second longer, he stumbled forward into the bath, the water splashing the tiles as he surged toward Draco.
Struggling to regain his composure, Draco sat up a little straighter and took a deep breath. He looked down his nose at Harry and arranged his features into a smirk of his own.
“Harry,” Draco called softly. “Come here a moment?”
They locked eyes, sharing a warm rush of affection for Maeve. Draco looked away first, shrouded once more in sorrow.
Potter.”
Harry looked away from Malfoy’s challenging stare and tugged anxiously at the hem of his jumper, unsure how to respond.
“No one’s in love,” Draco said dismissively. He clenched his teeth as his heart wriggled unhappily. Despite being perfectly true, the statement felt like a lie. Somehow, Draco managed to toss his head unconcernedly. “And you know quite well that there are no ancient pure-blood marriage spells that would function for a same-sex couple.”
Because he and Malfoy were on the seventh floor, across from the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy.
Draco shifted uncomfortably on the sofa, earning a bemused look from Hermione.
It had only been a few days since their first kiss, but while they had talked through the Floo several times, they had not seen each other in person. Every morning now, when Harry woke, he allowed himself to float peacefully for a few minutes in bed, remembering all the small details of waking up next to Draco.
Malfoy’s smile immediately dropped away and he met Harry’s eyes with a glare. “Is this an interrogation, Potter?”
Draco didn’t seem to notice. His hand had inched across the table until it was almost touching Harry’s and his brow was furrowed in concern.
Blaise nodded eagerly, obviously waiting for more.
to the Dark Lord – how can you tell
“I think so,” Harry said.
Draco took a bite of the meat and marveled at its tenderness. “This is delicious, Harry. Thank you.”
Draco whimpered, pressing closer to Harry. Every place they touched seemed to light up, as if magic was skating along their nerve endings, wrapping them in sunshine and wildflowers.
“Yes,” Draco said, as his heart swelled. “It really is.”
A young man? Surely she couldn’t mean…
Sixth year schoolboy grudges were one thing, and heroic, empathetic testimonies were quite another. But distracted musings about Malfoy’s oddly diverse spice purchases
Harry thought Draco did not want him, and it was shredding Harry to pieces.
Harry ran a thumb lovingly along Draco’s jaw. “Because of you, sweetheart.”
A growl rumbled low in Harry’s throat and he surged forward, capturing Draco’s lips. Draco met him with surprising fervor, kissing back desperately for one, two, three blissful seconds. Then he broke away, leaving Harry reeling.
He collapsed on top of Draco and nuzzled into his neck. Draco wrapped his arms around him and sighed contentedly.
“Not that that excuses my actions,” Draco added, misinterpreting Harry’s silence, “which were unconscionable.”
“Besides,” Malfoy continued, and Harry knew he was smirking without even having to turn around. “You were starting to look like a caged animal in here, Potter.”
, Potter.”
“Wait,” Draco said, lifting his head to eye Harry. “Did you
There was a pause.
Hermione’s eyes filled with pity, and Harry suddenly felt so drained that he couldn’t even be angry about it. Ron tensed when Hermione nudged him, but then stood and busied himself clearing the table. Spoons clinked metallically against the sink as he started the washing up.
Harry sat up, disentangling himself from Draco’s grip.
Harry suddenly gasped and choked a bit on his food. “That –” he coughed roughly and paused for a sip of water – “that happened to me the first time – er, sort of. I got dizzy and it was hard to walk, like there was a barrier trying to push me the other way. Toward
Harry froze, hardly daring to believe this was happening.
He leaned back on his hands, stalling.
When his eyes snapped open, Draco found himself atop soft green bedclothes, staring down at a very flushed, very naked Harry Potter.
Harry frowned. Absently, he began to slide his container of cumin back and forth along the excess space on the spice rack. Was that what he wanted? To be friends with Draco Malfoy?
“Are you alright?” he demanded, gnawing on his lip worriedly.
“Why is it a surprise?” he asked, affecting a lightness he did not feel. “I do live here, you know.”
“Right,” Harry said. “Yeah, that would be – yeah, let’s do that.”
Harry shuddered and bowed his head.
Draco just shook his head.
“Thank you,” Draco said, “for speaking at my trial.”
Harry felt his hands start to clench at the thought of the war, but then let out a measured exhale and forcibly relaxed his fingers. He wiped his hands on his trousers and tilted his head back to look at the canopy of blooms above. The buds glimmered almost like fairy lights, and Harry found himself wondering if they had been enchanted. He looked at Malfoy then, meaning to ask if he knew anything about these strange flowers, but the words caught in his throat.
Harry shook his head. “It’s ok if you’re scared,” he attempted. He wasn’t sure if that was the problem, but it seemed a reasonable place to start. “No one’s going to force you to apparate.”
“Well, obviously,” he managed a moment later. Thankfully, the words were only slightly wobbly.
McGonagall focused her gaze on Draco, brow furrowed in obvious concern. When she spoke again, it was in a gentle, hushed tone. “She collapsed, and there appears to be damage to her core.” McGonagall took a shaky breath. “Her magic is bleeding out of her.”
Just when Harry thought Draco might be dropping off to sleep, his eyes opened. He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco rasped. He jerked Harry upright and crushed Harry’s face into his chest. “You fucking
The words were like a balm to Draco’s heart. The promise of them took root inside of him, like a wildflower springing up at his very core.
Harry laughed helplessly and scooped Draco up in a hug. “The date hasn’t even happened yet, you berk,” he cried. Setting Draco back down on his feet, he grabbed his wrist and said, “Now will you please come on?”
Losing that belief now was shockingly unbearable.
“That makes sense.”
Harry looked over his shoulder just in time to see Draco take one tiny step backward, the movement so negligible that anyone else would have dismissed it as a meaningless fidget, if they noticed at all. Harry though, he understood Draco, and he saw the action for what it was – a crack. One that would spread to shatter Draco’s fragile, carefully constructed composure.
“I’ll try,” Draco whispered, wiping the back of his free hand across his eyes. “I’m just really going to miss you.”
He liked this, he realized. He liked doing this.
“I promise.”
“That’s why I told George,” Ginny said, as she returned to the table. She rested a hand against Harry’s shoulder. “After what you said, I knew I had to. Malfoy –
Harry thought again of the hidden letter he had found in Draco’s kitchen, and wondered how many other opportunities Draco had denied himself out of guilt.
“The reading I did on the Room of Requirement suggests that its magic can supersede other magical processes, even complex ones. It may have taken over the life-debt bond in some way, and activated in your moment of greatest need.”
Harry turned his head away and Malfoy pulled back. He coughed awkwardly.
He was
“Thank you.” Draco sighed in relief and collapsed forward, all the air rushing out of him at once. He looked like a puppet with its strings cut, as if the need to resolve this conflict had been the only thing holding him up.
The common room had emptied out some, but when Harry’s eyes darted to the corner, he saw that Draco Malfoy still occupied the same chair.
Weasley huffed out a laugh. “That’s not what I meant when I said prove it.”
Like telling your boyhood rival that you
He closed the gap between them, until his shoulder was brushing Harry’s.
Harry sucked in a startled breath and then choked on it. Luna patted him on the back while he coughed, a bit pathetically, into the sleeve of his jumper.
They finished their tea in comfortable silence, gazing up at the sky as the first stars appeared out of the darkness.
“Yeah,” Ginny said. Her laces had come undone beneath her restless fingers, and she bent to retie them, moving very slowly, almost like she was avoiding looking at Harry. “But what does that have to do with anything?”
Did you never once consider that your professors might be able to help?”
Harry goggled at him.
Draco’s hands roved over Harry’s chest and arms, seeking reassurance that he was safe and whole. “What were you thinking?” he whispered.
“No,” Draco whispered. “That was hot.”
Harry frowned and pushed his chair away from the table, its legs scraping roughly against the tile floor. He cringed at the sound, then allowed himself to droop. Resting his elbows against his thighs, he tangled his fingers into his hair. “What – Hermione, I don’t understand.”
Pointing at the arc of dark blue that cut through Harry’s throat, she addressed him directly. “This is the life-debt you owe to Draco.”
“No, Draco, it’s ok,” Harry cut in. “I wasn’t fine. Not really. I’m still not. But I think I need to accept that, and think about – all this, if I want to actually be fine someday.” He took a steadying breath. “So please don’t apologize.”
All of this, combined with the relief of sharing the flower problem with McGonagall, had properly relaxed Harry for the first time in weeks – so much so that he had been able to spend a pleasant hour discussing Quidditch with Ron and Seamus. Blaise Zabini had even offered a few humorous remarks about the new season that were surprisingly insightful.
Draco went willingly, straddling Harry and throwing his head back as their cocks brushed together. Harry kissed his way down Draco’s neck and chest, pausing to flick his tongue over one of Draco’s nipples. Draco hissed, grinding up against Harry as Harry continued to lave his nipple.
And maybe Harry should have given Draco more than two days before showing up unannounced at his job… but he couldn’t help it. He missed Draco. And Harry didn’t want Draco getting so tangled up in his thoughts that he somehow convinced himself to actively work against his own happiness. Harry Potter refused to be another thing Draco Malfoy tortured himself with, thank you very much. So here he was.
worse.”
Harry released a long breath. “Draco – I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I saw the letter. But I knew you didn’t want to talk about it, and I didn’t want to push you.”
“Never been sh-shoved up against the stone –
“Yeah,” Harry said, unable to keep the pride from his voice. “He did.”
“What?” Draco asked, apparently genuinely confused.
“I know,” Blaise sighed. “Hermione thinks the magic got tangled into your life-debts, and now you’re stuck.”
Especially since he wasn’t actually there.
Draco shot upright so violently that Harry fell off him in an ungainly sprawl. “But you hadn’t taken the potion yet!” he shouted.
. Eyes still clenched tight, he cast a soft but steady
This morning, Harry had walked with Draco into Hogsmeade, and when they arrived, he couldn’t stop himself from making one last plea.
That same memory bolstered Harry’s resolve now.
He squeezed his eyes tightly shut and took a steadying breath, grounding himself before the unavoidable encounter. With hands jammed beneath his thighs, a precaution against trembling fingers, Draco turned to face Harry Potter.
“Thank you, Luna,” Harry replied. He risked a glance at Draco, and found that he had gone unnaturally still.
Hermione looked up from the papers she was shuffling through. She had offered to read through Draco’s notes, in case something stood out to her that he and Harry had overlooked.
Malfoy frowned. “Correction, I said it was
Struggling to sit up, Draco looked across the bed at Harry. He was sitting cross-legged at the head of the bed, leaning against the wall. Even in rumpled pajamas and with matted hair, he was breathtaking.
Draco’s eyes cleared and he let his arms drop away from his chest. He shifted slightly closer to Harry. “I hated the flowers at first,” he admitted. “It felt so unfair, that they couldn’t just let me – die. I cried and ripped them off me. I – I tried again, but I couldn’t reopen the wounds.” Draco looked down at his hands helplessly.
“Do you want to go up to bed?”
“This is Malfoy, we’re talking about.
“I want to know more about your life,” Draco confessed. “The spells you invented, how you learned it all.” He averted his eyes. In a quiet voice, he added, “I can’t believe I never asked.”
Harry was tangled in vines, hands strung up above his head, tied securely to a large tree branch. Wand in the dirt at his feet, he was completely at Malfoy’s mercy.
“You always know best,” Draco said, smiling up at her.
Malfoy frowned. “You didn’t know?”
“It seemed like it had stopped,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “And – well, I may be avoiding her?”
“So Malfoy, huh?” she shot back, mouth an amused curve.
“Draco, stop,” Harry said, cutting into Draco’s unraveling thoughts. “It’s ok, I promise. There’s no way Hermione believed for a second that I was going to take notes.”
“I’ve been doing some research into our little flower problem, though I haven’t had much luck,” Malfoy explained. His mouth twisted wryly.
“I’m so glad you could join us, Draco,” Molly said warmly. “You’re the only thing our Harry’s been able to talk about lately.”
“Thank you, Professor, but no. I can’t do any Aperiomancy at all,” Harry said. “Malfoy had to explain the theory to me about a dozen times, and I still couldn’t figure it out. I don’t really know what I’m doing with my magic when I track the residue, but it’s not Aperiomancy.”
The comment should not have affected Draco as much as it did. Harry had said as much before, and Draco was even beginning to believe him. But Draco froze all the same, his blood turning to ice. Hope was a dangerous thing; it walked hand-in-hand with fear.
At which point, Draco, wearing a comically shocked expression, had spluttered and choked on his mouthful of cheese. Harry beamed delightedly at Hermione, telling her to help herself to tea while he thumped a rapidly reddening Draco on the back.
“Yes, detectives! Fascinating,” Draco sighed dreamily. He ran a reverent finger down the spine of the book, eyes gone glassy and distant. Then he jumped slightly and shook free of his reverie. He cocked his head at Harry. “Why do you read these stories if you don’t want to be an Auror?”
“Yeah.”
Malfoy started, as if he had just realized he was still hovering over Harry like a disapproving schoolmarm. He sank hastily to the ground, knocking his knee into Harry’s thigh. Malfoy looked horrified and scooted backward, hugging his arms to his chest and training his gaze on the far shore of the lake.
Almost before she finished speaking, platters began to appear on her desk, covered in eggs and toast and pastries. She gestured for them to help themselves.
been deliberately focusing on needing a dinner guest, after all. He frowned, unnerved by how unpleasant it felt to even skirt the truth while speaking to Potter. He imagined his younger self laughing at him. The frown deepened.
Either way, he couldn’t think of anywhere else he’d rather be, so he lay down in the grass and brooded. But after a time, he found that he wasn’t quite as miserable as he expected to be.
Harry collapsed to the floor and felt it give slightly beneath him. With a wide grin of satisfaction, he wiped the sweat from his brow and took a healthy gulp from a water bottle. His permanent cushioning charms were functioning perfectly. Anyone could fall from the rafters in this room now and suffer nothing more serious than a bruise.
Harry sprang to his feet, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Oh, ok – er, were you busy? Sorry, I should have asked instead of doing the shelf.” He gnawed on his lip and shuffled awkwardly in place, unsure why he had stood up. “I guess I’m kind of getting used to the apparition thing.”
“'Course not,” said Harry. “I spent most of my time at Hogwarts spying like this.”
Malfoy didn’t move, but Harry could tell he had his attention. A taunt line of tension hung between them.
“I’m lying down this time, though,” Malfoy continued, seemingly unperturbed by Harry’s silence. He tossed a pillow to Harry and snuggled into the blankets. “My neck still aches.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “you could say that.” His voice was a hoarse croak. Grimacing, he took a swig from his water bottle.
“Is he still all – formal about it?” Harry asked, suddenly curious about this other side of Malfoy.
Luna squeezed his hands. “It’s alright, Harry. He’ll forgive you.”
“Well what are you still doing here, then?” Maeve cried. “Don’t you keep that young man waiting, Draco.”
At the time, those words had slipped quietly inside Draco’s skin, heating his whole body with the allure of possibility. But even that had been much easier to dismiss than the expression on Harry’s face yesterday, when he pressed his foot to Draco’s after they’d spoken of the darkness in their dreams.
It felt good, to laugh like this with Ginny. Harry had missed her, even if he hadn’t missed their relationship. Months without her had left a hole in his life, in his family, that was now filled.
Draco’s breath hitched, and a splotchy redness spread from his cheeks to his neck. He was still in pajamas, and his white t-shirt was so thin that Harry could see the outline of his nipples, hard in the chill morning air. The waistband of his boxers peeked out of pajama bottoms that clung enough to expose the shape of his cock.
“Who puts a bed beneath the stairs?” he said, frowning in distaste.
“Will that help you brew an antidote?” Harry asked in excitement.
Draco clasped Harry’s hand and kissed his palm. A smile quirked the corner of Harry’s mouth.
Without really thinking about it, Harry plucked a book from the shelf and dropped into the armchair in the corner of the room.
Luna, Neville, and Hannah had been discharged just a few days after Draco’s potion was administered. None were strong enough to use their magic yet, but Tahlyn had cleared them to resume all other activities. Blaise though, was still bedridden. The hooks had managed to burrow fully through his core before he’d been put into stasis, which made his case significantly more serious than the others. He’d been in the hospital wing for a week now, and Tahlyn expected it would be a week more before he fully recovered.
And still, Draco Malfoy outshone it all.
“I had to find you,” he whispered.
“Does he know how to fix us?”
stemmed from the negative influences of ‘Gnashing Termites.’ They’re attracted to green clothes and like to hide in blond hair.”
Harry groaned and collapsed forward, scrubbing his fingers through his hair.
“It isn’t even lunch time, Potter,” he’d complained, as prickly as ever.
“I don’t want to leave you, you know,” Maeve said. She pulled a biscuit tray toward them, full of the discards, all the odd shapes and broken pieces.
“Yes,” Draco panted. “But not like this.”
When he reached the doorway, Harry rapped his knuckles awkwardly against the frame. Malfoy was standing on the far side of the room, hunched over a sink. He stiffened at the sound, but did not look up.
Draco hesitated, then sped up as well, matching his strides to Harry’s. In a carefully neutral tone, he asked, “Do you think you might enjoy teaching?”
Muscles burning, Harry feigned concentration and dove toward the center goal post, hoping Malfoy would follow. As Harry pulled out of the dive, his broom dropped abruptly, leaving him several meters below where he had meant to be. He shook his head, annoyed that he had let himself get so out of practice, before sweeping in a long arc to the opposite end of the Pitch, intending to leave Malfoy far behind.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
Outside, a family passed by, the little boy happily splashing through the puddles with his neon green boots. Draco and Maeve shared a smile at the boy’s shriek of laughter.
“Er – type of clues?” Harry repeated.
Harry greeted him with a smirk, tugging playfully at the front pocket of the hoodie. “You look good in my colors, sweetheart.”
Harry cocked his head. “You’re kind of crap at pillow talk.”
Hermione gave a soft, thoughtful hum. “I believe there are many subjects I would enjoy discussing with you, Draco Malfoy. I do hope you won’t be a stranger.”
“Right,” Harry agreed. “Ok, get the spell ready, but wait for me to tell you when. I need a minute to collect the different magics.”
Draco glanced up at Harry, soft and open and entirely vulnerable. Then he blinked away his daze and scowled. “Not like Weasley left you much choice,” he grumbled. “Always knew he was a busybody. The man’s got no class.”
“I forgot where I was. And Lavender, she had been apparating all over, keeping me off balance, and right then she apparated onto the tree limb above me. I heard the crack, and I was so relieved. I looked up, expecting to see you.” Harry opened his eyes, tilting his head toward Draco with a chagrined smile. “But it wasn’t you, and I felt – lost.”
“Kickboxing,” Harry corrected with an amused snort.
“The dehydrator is at maximum capacity,” he answered, “so I’m actually free at the moment. I’ll have everything restocked for you tomorrow though.”
“I want you to stay on at Hogwarts, of course,” McGonagall said matter-of-factly, as if this should have been obvious to Draco.
Harry stood so swiftly that his chair clattered to the ground. He swept Draco into his arms, lifting him off his feet and kissing him until they were both breathless.
towards Luna and Neville, Hannah and Blaise.
They’d talked themselves hoarse, and there had been silence for a few minutes now, McGonagall simply watching them with that almost smile on her face.
with a Hogwarts apprenticeship, because I
“It’s such a pleasant surprise to see you,” Luna said, perching on the arm of the sofa. She seemed to have at least a dozen colorful scarves wrapped around her neck and shoulders. There was even a thin pink and green one tying back her long waves of blonde hair. Looking at the pale gold locks made Harry wistful. He suppressed a groan.
Draco accepted the cup, looking down at it with a puzzled frown. “Hot chocolate?”
“Fancy a break?” Harry attempted. Malfoy shifted in his chair and scowled at him, but Harry soldiered ahead anyway. Fighting against blushing, Harry looked away from Malfoy and addressed his question to the floor. “Thought I’d take a walk, if you – er, maybe wanted to come?”
When his breathing slowed, he darted a glance at Hermione, but she didn’t seem to have noticed. Ron was slumped in the chair on Harry’s other side, still half asleep, so no trouble there. Harry rubbed a hand across his face self-consciously, and then… his thoughts inevitably strayed back to Malfoy. Malfoy, who was now over five minutes late for their first day.
Harry believed in Malfoy,
For one long moment, they stared at each other in awe. And then Draco tackled Harry.
Draco bit his lip and nodded, eyes darting away.
Eventually, the music stopped, and Malfoy angled his body toward Harry.
But then Harry asked Draco to move in, and Draco had said no.
“You were stunning,” Draco breathed, the words far too honest with Weasley standing right there. Draco’s face burned, and Harry’s eyes flickered to his mouth.
Thoroughly confused, Harry tugged at the collar of his t-shirt.
going to be a part of it.
Harry blinked at him innocently, and then hid his smile behind his menu. Draco grumbled a bit, but settled in to pore over his own menu enthusiastically enough.
There was another pause. Harry kicked off his trainers and moved to sit cross-legged. He sighed and rested his elbow against the arm of the sofa, propping his head in his hand.
“Yes, of course,” Malfoy replied matter-of-factly.
Harry nodded. “Is Blaise going to tell Draco?”
“Oh.” Draco’s breath left him in a rush, like Weasley had punched him in the stomach.
“But I – I mean, no, that’s not –” Harry stuttered to a stop.
“Ready, Professor,” Harry said.
, the first one,” Harry muttered. “Not maybe not. Maybe
It was quite pleasant, sitting quietly with Draco and looking out over the sculpted grounds of Hogwarts, though there wasn’t much worth spying on. The Unspeakable shifted around enough for them to see that she wasn’t in any type of uniform, just inconspicuous black robes, but there was still no magic that they could discern, even when Harry reached out with Sentiomancy. She appeared to be doing no more than intensely observing the flowers.
Harry set down the knife. “I don’t know.”
Draco trembled and slowly lowered his arm. Pupils blown wide, irises the color of a storm-tossed sea, he fixed his gaze on Harry. Without breaking eye contact, Harry brought his hand to Draco’s cock and began to pump. Draco’s eyes fluttered closed then, so Harry lowered his head and enveloped him once more in his mouth.
That was probably more of the war trauma, he supposed, like Hermione was always going on about. But Harry didn’t see the point in dwelling on darkness. Voldemort had taken up quite enough of his life, thank you very much, and Harry was more than ready to just get on with things.
“Draco,” Harry gasped, pulling at Draco’s sleeve. “Look.”
doesn’t mean it’s not there!”
Harry sucked in a painful breath and shifted along the wall toward the center of the bed, a foot closer to Malfoy.
“That’s lovely.” Luna smiled.
“I know,” Harry whispered, fingers twitching slightly against his jeans. “The Room.”
“I imagine I’ll see him quite soon,” Draco admitted. The repetitive motions of forming the biscuits helped to keep his breathing calm. “We’re having a bit of trouble, with some sort of bond or life-debt. We’re not quite sure what it is, actually, but it seems to be forcing us to apparate to each other’s sides whenever one of us needs something.”
Jaw clenched, Harry settled into the rhythms of his intangible game of catch and continued raking through his memories. He was desperate to dig up something, anything, some clue, from when McGonagall’s use of the Death Eater wands had unleashed more of the hooked residue.
And then Harry leaned over Draco and brought his lips to the marred skin, fluttering tender kisses across the length of each and every scar.
“I do not change the names of my teas, Potter,” Draco huffed, but his eyes were suspiciously shiny as he wriggled out of Harry’s arms, and Harry knew that he’d said the right thing.
was as much admission as Draco could make in that moment. As close as he could come to saying that he
Harry bristled at that, but Hermione was having none of it.
Draco hummed in contentment, but then his brow furrowed. “Why? What were you doing?”
Maeve pressed the bandages into his hands. “I’m sure you are,” she said. She smiled encouragingly at Harry, but there was something melancholy in her eyes. “It would be better if you didn’t offer. It’ll ease my mind if you’ll help him with the bandages, though. He won’t get them tight enough on his own.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, shivering even more now that his body was starting to warm. “That’s why I came too, sort of. I wanted to – to feel you, at least, if I couldn’t find you.”
Draco dropped his head to Harry’s shoulder and groaned.
Draco drew in a stuttering breath and released it slowly, curling into Harry and resting his head against his chest.
He handed one of the plates to Harry and they both sat down on the sofa. Draco kicked off his shoes and curled his legs beneath him. Completely ignoring his own food, he stared pointedly at Harry’s until Harry took the hint and began to eat. It was a decadent dish, the sauce thick and rich over creamy cheese and perfectly seasoned meat. Harry moaned appreciatively and took another forkful.
Harry flushed and looked away, feeling slightly ashamed. Malfoy had been sacrificing sleep for a week, struggling to find a solution in the magical theory books they had checked out of the library. He had even written to his mother and requested some volumes from his father’s old Dark Arts collection. Harry should have helped more.
Classes would continue on a modified (and reduced) schedule for all years, focusing on history and theory for the time being. The eighth years had already been scheduled for an Arithmancy/Divination workshop (and wasn’t that an odd blend? Hermione was furious.) beginning Monday, which conveniently did not require spells.
Without bothering to answer Draco, Harry strode across the room and threw open the door of the cupboard under the stairs. His hand tightened on the doorknob. The miniscule room was exactly as he remembered, right down to a spider scuttling across a discarded sock.
“He helped you, when you were trapped in the Manor?” Harry asked. He looked at her tentatively, not sure if she’d want to talk about it.
But now that the adrenaline was leaving his system, Harry felt drained and sick. In the wake of their mock battle on the grounds, Harry could not as easily ignore the unease that was growing in him. Thoughts of the Auror Academy, and of a veiled threat at Hogwarts, crowded into Harry’s mind, eclipsing the joys brought by the physical challenge of an honest fight.
the magic of the flowers. He cradled it reverently, guiding it slowly,
“Draco,” Harry whispered, and it sounded like his entire heart was in his throat.
Malfoy swatted him away. “Stop breathing on me, Potter. This is very delicate work.”
They both went very still, united in their misery, and silence descended over the room, as if even the sounds of nature shied away from intruding upon them. Draco looked out the window, seeking starlight, but the comforting lights of the heavens were hidden by clouds. Draco sighed, fighting off the irrational desire to slump forward and rest his head in Harry’s lap.
never been able to take his eyes off Draco on the Pitch, and maybe there had been more to that than just beating him to the Snitch…
– and whispered, “You don’t have to be here.”
Harry was lying on the shore of the lake, hovering just on the edge of sleep, when Malfoy’s voice cut into his reverie.
“Hmm?”
He bent his knees, propping an ankle against his thigh. Absently, he began to move his foot in slow, restless circles.
Malfoy blinked once, looking almost dazed, then frowned at Harry. For a moment, Harry thought Malfoy was going to walk away, but instead Malfoy spoke. “Why did you ask me about it then?”
As they walked along the lake, a tentacle emerged lazily from the water and swiped the stones off the top of the ice floes. Ron nattered on about the desserts he wanted his mum to bake over Christmas and matched his pace to Harry’s.
“Yeah? When can I taste it?”
“Fuck you, Potter.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco breathed, running his hands up and down Harry’s arms. “I shouldn’t have doubted you. You’ve never given me any reason to doubt you. I love you. I’m sorry.”
“Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed.
Harry jerked back. “Wh-what?”
certain, which is why it had taken him nearly three weeks to decide to speak to McGonagall. But every time he told himself he should respect Draco’s choices, Harry found himself thinking of that leather notebook full of calculations, and of the lie in Draco’s eyes when he had dismissed it as
Wand floating in the air beside him, its tip casting light over the grass, Harry was standing between two wooden posts that had not been there on Draco’s previous visit. Harry did not seem to have heard the crack of apparition. His back to Draco, he remained absorbed in untangling a pile of ropes.
Maeve chuckled and patted Draco’s back until he released her.
“Yes,” Draco said, clutching at the arm Harry had wrapped around his waist. “Please don’t leave.”
He stood in the doorway, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. His bemused expression did little to hide the tired lines of his face or the deep circles under his eyes. His glasses were perched on his nose, but he was still shirtless, revealing muscular shoulders and toned abs. His sweatpants hung low enough that sharp hip bones peeked out, two tantalizing lines drawing the eye downward. Draco’s throat, already dry, tightened further and he had to quickly look away. The silence buzzed in his ears as Potter stared at him, clearly at a loss for what to say.
, and as he lowered his wand, he saw that his school robes had been transfigured into a Muggle suit with a fitted green waistcoat.
Draco remembered Harry calling him – had no need to size each other up after months of daily bouts.
Inhaling deeply, Draco let the comforting scent of his spices and tea leaves loosen his tense muscles. By the time the chimes of the door signaled Mrs. Peakwright’s departure, he had calmed enough to sit down at his desk and plan his afternoon. But just as he began reviewing the week’s receipts, gauging which blends he’d need to replenish, Maeve’s voice shattered his hard-won focus.
Harry cringed. He’d suspected as much, but it still hurt to have it confirmed. “I never wanted her to feel that way,” he said dejectedly.
Harry couldn’t leave it.
Harry felt a hysterical laugh begin to build in his chest. He hugged his arms into himself, trying to trap it inside. “No, I – er, actually, I – I’m pretty confused.”
The fact that Harry was voluntarily seeking him out sent a shiver of pleasure up Draco’s spine. He straightened his tie and moved closer to the fire.
His gaze bored into Draco, but the green irises looked strangely vulnerable, shedding the strength of emeralds for the fragility of hand-blown glass. Potter was hunched into himself, knees drawn up to his chest and hands balled into fists. Shaking, Potter gasped in a breath.
If Malfoy hadn’t been bleeding, Harry might have found some excuse to leave. He still wasn’t sure exactly what he had walked in on here, but this shop was clearly more than a job to Malfoy. Seeing him now, standing protectively at the center of this obviously beloved workspace, Harry could tell that this was Malfoy at his most vulnerable. He felt as though he had elbowed his way straight into the chambers of Malfoy’s still-beating heart, and he was wary of leaving a bruise.
Harry paused. The words were coming more easily than he expected.
Draco’s hand flew up to cover his eye. He bit back a yelp of pain and blushed, embarrassed by the involuntary reaction. In a belated attempt to mask the motion, he brushed back his hair. “He did not
Harry prodded, following Ginny’s gaze.
really fucking wow.”
A smile spread across Draco’s face even as his brow wrinkled in confusion.
Draco raised his eyebrows.
Harry swatted at Malfoy’s hands, already mourning the loss of their heated moment outside.
Harry didn’t know whether to be encouraged or discouraged by that. He floundered for a moment, then shut the door. “Why
such an athlete. And he –” Draco cut himself off, taking a shaky breath.
Outwardly at least, Draco appeared entirely unruffled. He was dressed smartly in fitted grey trousers and a deep blue dress shirt that made his eyes sparkle. (It had taken Harry all morning to convince him to forgo the tie.) No hint of a blush nor any sweat at his temples marred Draco’s cool composure. The side of his head was freshly shaved, but he hadn’t styled the longer half, and the fine blond strands tumbled around his face in a way Harry found softly beautiful. It lent Draco a warmth, an openness his younger self had lacked, and Harry could tell that Draco was anxious to make a good impression on Harry’s family – to let them in and show them kindness and learn to know them.
“That’s not true,” he argued. He felt Draco’s eyes on him and his voice grew stronger. “Professor, it’s the most useful thing I’ve learned this year! It lets you gather information, and the more information you have, the better equipped you are to act.” Harry paused as he warmed to the idea, the possibilities beginning to take shape in his mind. “Imagine if we started practicing it in first year! What if we learned to sense different kinds of magic
“How does it work then?” Granger asked.
Afterward, McGonagall had required another explanation, insisting they go through it all calmly and without speaking over one another.
The scruffy wizard manning the desk in the club’s foyer waved them on without even glancing at their membership passes, too absorbed in his magazine to bother with regular customers. Lavender dumped her bag into an empty cubby, then placed her palm against it to lock it with her magical signature. Harry threw his wallet into one of the smaller cubicles and after a moment of indecision, rid himself of his hoodie as well. The air was always unpleasantly cold in here, the bare concrete walls providing little insulation, but he knew he’d work up a sweat soon enough.
Their mouths moved chastely, seeking comfort more than anything else. The kiss tasted like an oasis, the relief of a spring in the desert, life-giving water, fresh and cold. Draco soon grew breathless, and he broke away to rest his forehead against Harry’s.
“But I didn’t do anything,” Draco protested, wriggling slightly away from Harry. “It was all Maeve.”
There was a pause.
Harry considered that as he ran a hand through his sleep-mussed hair. He rolled his shoulders and rubbed at a crick in his neck. “Better,” he said finally. “You didn’t have to stay.”
a year ago. I had just lost my magic, I hated myself more than ever, and I –” Draco shook his head. “I would not have been the best role model.”
“Potter?” Draco’s anxious voice cut into Harry’s whirring thoughts. He turned to find Draco clambering off the ladder and into the loft. “What happened? I heard you cry out.”
Draco immediately clapped a hand over his mouth, eyes wide and horrified. McGonagall blinked at him, but Harry noticed that her mouth had adopted that amused slant again.
“Do you think it’s because I didn’t go into Auror training?” Harry tugged at the collar of his t-shirt, then dropped his hand back to his lap. “Or – or because I didn’t sit for my NEWTs?”
Harry squinted through the glass lid on the pan and spoke without thinking. “This is a lasagna.”
Draco doesn’t even understand the kinds of magic described in the journal—magic that a 14-year-old is supposed to be able to know.

“Oh, right,” Draco says. “Isabelle took them.”

And as he watches, the mark starts to burn slightly, the pain steadily growing with each passing second, and Draco gasps. It darkens until it’s pitch black against his skin, the snake slithering through the skull with a soundless hiss.
And now, an Amethyst remembrance
“It’s a choice you have to make. You can’t have both, not if you choose your memories first. You know that darling,” Narcissa replies, eyes and voice softening. She reaches over to him and places her hand over Draco’s, a warm, steady thing to calm his worries.
He settles further into his pillows as he opens the paper. He’s interested to see whether or not this Rita Skeeter character considered him fit for society after being released from Azkaban.
Draco gets the impression that he’s a terrible liar, and he’s not sure whether to be annoyed that Potter is clearly lying, or smug that he can tell. Certainly curious about why he’s lying, at least.
Thankfully, Potter largely avoids Draco, save for daily check-ins and lunch-bringing, and Draco is torn between relief and annoyance. On one hand, they aren’t exactly on good terms with each other, and he doesn’t particularly
Draco furrows his eyebrows, remembering the note he sent off into the storm. That must’ve been for Narcissa. Caught between wanting to know what he wrote and why she suddenly brings it up, he decides on a neutral response. “I don’t know what was in it, but I remember sending it.”
Draco tilts his head in confusion. He figures that Ron and George must be related to Rose in some way, maybe caught in the fire.
To say he’s nervous would be an understatement. He has no idea what to expect from the healer, or the meeting. Narcissa’s warning not to see a brain specialist weighs on him, but he reasons that there must be a difference between a memory and a brain specialist, right?
Harry Potter, who he’s read so much about.
Harry wakes to Draco, and the sun.
things, for once.”
” Saul Croaker groans from across the ward. Draco chuckles as he closes his curtains behind him, intending to pick up the paper about his trial again. He stops when he notices a folded piece of parchment on his bed.
“Thank you, Isabelle,” he murmurs, setting the vials on his bedside table in favour of scratching behind her ear. She trills happily.
“That’s all up to you,” she says, eyes widening as the drink hits her. “You know that boy’s pride will stop him from saying anything first.”
“What?” He tries not to snap at her. He’s just
. Without opening his eyes, he runs his fingers over the raised scars that cross over the crook of his neck, down to just below his navel. He doesn’t know how he got them, or how old they are, and can only assume it’s from the Aurors or the war. The first time he saw them, he couldn’t tear his eyes away—and much the same with his Dark Mark, which still mars his skin even though it’s faded.
— Draco is beautiful. Hair mussed, falling out of the bun, the strands blowing against his neck in the breeze.
“I’m aware,” he replies flatly, Potter’s expression souring further. He lays back onto his bed with a small sigh, shifting a bit to get comfortable. “Get it over with, then.”
“I got lost on the way here,” he jokes. Agnes breathes a laugh, but something about it doesn’t quite feel the same as usual, and the smile drops from his face.
He knows what she looks like from photographs, and corresponded with her through letters, but it’s different in person. She seems more real. More human.
“Soto,” Draco finally settles on. Potter raises his eyebrows, eyes darkening, before he sighs heavily.
Draco flinches, tries to cover it up with a smile, and puts his hands over his ears. So much for the quiet greeting he was expecting.

“Harry, where are your glasses?” Neville asks as they approach the table. Harry feels the eyes of a few of the students turn to him. Their stares usually don’t bother him, but today, he feels bashful under their gazes.
written by Skeeter—and almost accidentally knocks one of Soto’s mugs off his bedside table.
“Sorry,” he murmurs. He’s mortified when he feels a flush creep up his neck, though he’s not quite sure why or how to stop it.
Harry rolls his eyes and flips George off as he climbs the steps, the redhead’s laughter following him up. When he’s out of George’s sight, though, he casts a few freshening charms on himself in embarrassment. It’s entirely possible George was pulling his leg — but it’s equally likely that he wasn’t. He’d rather not take that risk.

The corners of her lips pull down slightly, but the frown dissipates quickly, replaced by a sympathetic smile. “It’s okay, love. You’re in St. Mungo’s. Can you tell me the last thing you remember?”
Draco falls silent at that, and Harry wishes he could see Draco’s expression clearer, worried he said something he shouldn’t have. The space between them feels like a chasm.
He steps away from the desk with a heavy sigh, accidentally kicking the trash bin as he does, wincing at the loud clang it makes when it tips over. He hopes no one heard that.
It’s then that Draco finds Potter—in the arms of an impossibly large, hairy man—arms hanging limp. Draco lips tighten, and he can't look at Potter, either.
Draco edges towards his curtains, pulling them aside slightly so he can peer out into the ward. He notes, with a small shake of his head, that Agnes and Gilderoy are doing the same, both from her cubicle. He’s startled to see an unfamiliar face with them, a wizard with a gaunt face and dark hair, before he realizes it must be the new patient.

As he stands there, barely holding himself together, he’s distinctly aware of one thing:
It’s like Bryn said: he changed.
Christmas Eve has finally arrived, along with the party.
And so far, Potter is the only person Draco knows he has a history with, apart from Narcissa. He hasn’t heard a single thing from or about any friends, so naturally has to assume that he didn’t even have any. But he knows about Potter—and Potter clearly knows about
“Everyone makes mistakes,” Draco says defensively. He’s not quite sure why he’s defending her, considering he barely knows her—though if he’s honest, it’s probably because he just doesn’t want to agree with Potter.
Blaise hums, glancing to see if Neville is gone before he pulls a cigarette from his coat and ducks outside, Harry following. “I’m doing great, thanks. How about you? I take it Draco still hasn’t shagged you, then?”
Draco plucked it from the shelf and found that it was as unhelpful as all the rest.
Draco Malfoy was worth the effort.
Nerves fraying more with every second, Harry rose from the sofa and threw open the windows. Draco closed his eyes and leaned back, inhaling deeply as the scents of cornflowers and sun-warmed apples spilled into the room. A faint smile crossed his face.
Harry did not answer, but his jaw worked, as if he were chewing on a response. Not wanting to rush him, Draco averted his eyes and gazed out the open windows. The afternoon light was fading and the tree branches cast long, twining shadows over Harry’s garden. It was seeped of color, only a few wildflowers still catching the last rays of the sun. The effect was almost eerie, and it was hauntingly beautiful. Draco wondered what it would be like to hold Harry’s hand in that garden, to lose themselves in each other’s arms as the sunset painted over color with gradual darkness. Draco’s hands trembled, and he was relieved when Harry finally spoke.
In the ensuing silence, McGonagall’s voice washed over them, brittle as old parchment. “Stand aside please, Poppy. Let them in.”
“I do.”
They stood like that for what felt like a long time, Harry rubbing a hand up and down Draco’s back. Finally, Draco tore himself away, the movement violent in its suddenness. With his back to Harry, he scrubbed a sleeve roughly across his eyes and sniffed a few times, before visibly shaking off his despair. He rolled his neck and squared his shoulders, then opened the oven to check on the lasagna.
Harry knew he shouldn’t have said those things to him this morning. All he wanted was to run to Malfoy and melt at his feet. He wanted to take it all back, but he didn’t know how. He didn’t think Malfoy would want to see him.
Harry trailed after Draco as he walked toward his workshop. “I didn’t.”
“Aperio means ‘to reveal.’ Sentio means ‘to feel.’” Malfoy shrugged.
, and
Stifling his laughter, Harry nodded his head imploringly toward the gate, but Draco didn’t budge.
Harry broke the silence. “Malfoy?”
“I thought you were asleep,” he said with a fond smile.
Blaise was telling the truth. Of course it had not been like that. Draco knew that as surely as he knew his own name. But
Harry’s heart sank, but he refused to let the dismay touch his face. Bad enough that Draco had endured Azkaban at all, without feeling like he had failed at his self-appointed mission.
Draco stared at him, mouth slightly open.
“You are my family too,” Maeve growled, as if she were daring him to deny it.
Harry touched Draco’s wrists, his spine, his cheeks, and then he buried his head in Draco’s shoulder and let out one broken sob.
“Please answer my questions,” Hermione begged, trailing after Maeve as she stumped across the shop toward the counter.
“Gold, blood red, royal blue,” she listed off impatiently. Then she smirked and shot a pointed look at his eyes. “Emerald green,” she purred suggestively. “Make sure they’re tight. Especially on your biceps.”
. It was everything they used to be, but without the pain. Harry wanted Malfoy to push him, and he wanted to push back, just so long as they weren’t out for blood. They had hurt each other enough.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry said softly. “I was looking at your cookbooks and it fell out.”
“Did you just –” Draco tapped a finger against the edge of the counter as he struggled to find the right word.
“Merlin, Malfoy! Are you –” Harry trailed off, finally taking in their surroundings.
“Oh,” Harry said, the sound more strangled wheeze than word. His mind whirled backward, spinning through the past few weeks as every detail, every inexplicable emotion, every wandering thought, suddenly clicked into place. He fell forward, letting his forehead smack into the table. “Oh,
“Oh,” Harry said, a bit embarrassed he hadn’t thought of that himself. Sweeping his wand in a wide arc, he created a soft barrier around them, ensuring that the children could not wander or fly away.
of all things. Well, I never.”
Harry jumped as a crackling sensation coursed through him. He stared down at his hands in amazement as whorls of midnight blue ink seemed to pool under his skin. The color spread, and bright flashes of lightning sparked across Harry’s palms, as if a thunderstorm were raging beneath the surface. It didn’t hurt, but he could feel the buzz of the lightning and the rumbles of the thunder over his whole body.
“He was wrong. All my life he taught me the wrong things. I needed him to know that I would never stand behind his filth and his lies ever again.”
, the day Harry looked up from the wreckage of the war and no longer needed her. But she had been the one to look up, and all she felt was mild exasperation.
Draco swallowed the words, tongue plundering Harry’s mouth. His fingers roved across Harry’s chest, moving downward to toy with the hem of his t-shirt, little bursts of flame igniting in Harry’s veins where Draco’s skin brushed his.
And Harry realized that maybe it was ok to be vulnerable in this moment, with this version of Malfoy. Maybe he didn’t need Malfoy to say anything; maybe having him there next to him, close enough to touch, was reassurance enough.
“I have no idea,” Harry said, chuckling. “So, how
Harry wasn’t sure where Malfoy was going with this, but he listened patiently. Because it felt like Malfoy was offering him something.
Draco snorted. He busied himself with the biscuits when McGonagall glanced at him sharply. Harry wondered if the derision was meant for him or for Driffield.
Draco snorted, shaking his head at himself. Letting just anyone in was exactly what Maeve had done when she hired him.
Draco looked up and seemed startled by Harry’s stricken expression. He brushed the bread crumbs from his hands with a sigh. “Yes, well – I could not imagine anything worse at the time, but now I find the idea rather comforting.”
“Ok,” Harry said, “but once Hermione knew, why did she tell us all those things about the Room of Requirement and how life-debts work? Why not just come clean at that point?”
Harry stumbled back against a doorframe, blinking to clear his vision after the disorienting whirl of apparition. When his eyes opened, he saw that he was in Draco’s bathroom, and that he had just narrowly avoided tripping into the numerous glass bottles spread across the floor. Draco was kneeling in the bathtub, biting his lip and looking up sheepishly at Harry.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. “Of course I do.”
and this wasn’t happening,
They’d had a quiet morning, sharing toast slathered with jam from the pot Harry smuggled out of the castle. And Harry had taken every opportunity to use Draco’s given name.
The hooks shuddered
Draco inhaled shakily and began to fiddle with that dry tea bag again, fingers tugging at it almost violently. After a moment, the filter paper tore, scattering dried leaves across the table. Harry wanted to stop and ask Draco what was wrong, but he was sure Draco wouldn’t thank him for drawing Hermione’s attention to his unease.
visits over the next year, Maeve had promised them. And Draco had almost immediately settled, losing some of the tension he had carried for months, as if all he had needed was something concrete to count down to.
Ron sputtered in feigned outrage and Harry laughed, finally beginning to unwind. Hermione rolled her eyes at them fondly and hefted a sheaf of parchment out of her bag. In between Harry’s Cannons insults and Ron’s attempts to defend his beloved team’s (mediocre, at best) players, Hermione told them about her progress learning to draft legislation. She was only an intern at the Department of International Magical Cooperation and wouldn’t be in a position to propose new laws for years, but Hermione always had believed in being prepared. Besides, she would likely die of boredom without an intricate research project to consume her free time. Harry found himself smiling softly at the thought, grateful that his clever friend now had the time to pursue subjects of her own choosing, rather than scrambling for miracles to save Harry from Voldemort’s latest plot.
Harry raised his eyebrows, and Draco looked away sheepishly.
“Magic feels differently to everyone,” McGonagall explained. “Advanced Aperiomancy is so individualized that no one can be taught the meaning of what they sense. They have to discover it for themselves. And once they do, there is no concrete way for them to discuss it with other people, at least not in a way that aids magical collaboration.”
Draco let his hand fall back to his lap, feeling a pang of loss as he studied the crisscrossed beams of light.  The orange was everywhere, and Draco could not help but worry over it.
“Right,” Blaise said with a tight-lipped smile. “Like I said, can I buy you a cup of coffee?”
Their voices overlapped, and Harry was relieved to hear that Draco’s was steady.
Malfoy rushed forward and dropped to his knees, reaching out to cup the bud in one gentle palm. The petals shivered, and all at once, the flower bloomed.
“Let’s eat on the sofa,” he suggested. “It’ll be more comfortable.”
“Nothing is wrong with you,” Draco said.
“Potter –” Draco said gently. But Harry wasn’t finished.
“Yes,” Draco answered breezily, turning another. fucking. page. “It’s
Malfoy stretched, grimacing as he rolled his neck, then caught sight of Harry.
. And in all those weeks, did it never once occur to you that this is a
Draco’s body was alive with contradiction, dappled in a strange mix of cheerful yellows and seductive moonlight. Outside, tree branches swayed in the breeze, fracturing the sunlight. Shifting hues swirled across Draco’s skin, as if he were lying at the bottom of a clear pool. His hair shone alluringly, almost pearlescent in the strange light. It was pricked with gold at the edges, a treasure to tempt men down to the watery depths.
“Will you go to the hospital wing?” Draco asked softly. “Make sure they’re still stable?” He ducked his head, eyes downcast and unsure.
frustrated with the lack of progress on his new tea–
Draco’s nostrils flared and his hands clenched into fists. “You’ve gone to the Forbidden Forest to practice Dark Magic
Draco looked over at him in surprise, his fingers brushing against Harry’s as he accepted the unexpected token. He breathed in the scent of it and tucked it delicately into his hair. When he took Harry’s hand, his smile was as sweet as the sunrise.
who has you distracted.”
Harry steeled himself and cautiously extended his magic into the delicate buds on the vine above his head. The icy shock bit into him, but he didn’t let it consume him this time. He took a steadying breath and waited for his body to adjust to the cold. Then he
Harry gasped again. “Draco!”
Harry pushed himself into a sitting position, but before he could climb out of bed, Malfoy’s eyes opened. Harry hastily pulled a blanket into his lap, covering his obvious erection.
“Ah, I see you discovered Tolkien while I was asleep,” Draco said, shifting closer to Harry.
There had been that one moment though, when Harry’s Knee-knocker Jinx had gone wide, and Malfoy had hastily thrown up a Shield Charm in front of the passing Hannah Abbot and Justin Finch-Fletchley. Justin scowled in Harry’s direction before the two scurried off.
At that, tiny goosebumps erupted across Draco’s skin. Swallowing hard, he ignored the feeling and got Harry set up with a knife and cutting board.
Draco shouted, and his cock pulsed into Harry’s mouth. Harry sucked gently until Draco went soft, then looked up at him. Draco’s eyes were closed, a blissed out smile on his face. He slid his fingers into Harry’s mop of hair and caressed his head tenderly.
“Or my groom,” Harry countered.
“So eloquent,” Draco joked, kissing Harry on the brow.
The trees blurred past, the sounds of birds and the lapping waters of the lakeshore receding as blood rushed in his ears. His breathing grew more and more labored. This wasn’t right. He could normally run three or four laps of this trail without getting winded.
“Right. Er, sorry Malfoy. Could I sit down?” Harry felt the back of his neck growing hot, and reached his hand up to grip onto the hair there. He twisted the strands anxiously between his fingers.
It did hurt, for a time, a fiery stretch that stole Harry’s breath. But never once did he want to stop. The pain was nothing more than a brittle shell. It cracked open like a fancy chocolate, pleasure oozing out and coating all his nerves in caramel.
He suddenly gripped his left forearm, and started to run his thumb up and down over the spot where Harry knew his Mark would be. When Malfoy caught Harry staring, he stopped immediately and crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco touched the doorknob now, remembering Harry’s bewildered response.
They crashed together, tossing clothes haphazardly to the floor, until they tumbled onto their sides, skin to skin and everywhere slick and hot and gleaming.
“But instead you chose to do something you knew would hurt me,” Draco said derisively, “just to impress your new girlfriend.”
Draco cleared his throat, surprised to find himself standing upright rather than reduced to a melted puddle at Harry’s feet. “You want me to come over?”
Harry heard Draco’s breath hitch. He brought his hands to cradle Draco’s arse, running his thumbs over his hip bones. The touch was as soothing as it was provocative, and though Draco bit his lip and flushed prettily, he also relaxed, muscles surrendering to Harry’s ministrations.
Draco watched Harry work, an unreadable expression on his face.
“Good.” Harry smiled, still caressing his cheek. “So… yes?”
His hands shook. Slowly, Harry removed them from Draco’s body and hugged them into himself. He started to shiver.
“Because you were a child,” Harry cried. “Because you had no good choices. Because you did what you had to do to
When Harry did not continue, Malfoy sighed and hunched into himself a little further.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, looking decidedly unsteady. “On our… date?” he asked, the word catching in his throat.
ok? You’re clever and inventive and I want to know every bizarre idea that bounces around your brain. And you care, so much. When you’re invested in something, you give it
“I’m fine,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow.
McGonagall’s eyes widened. “You finished a potion?” she cried. “When?”
They lapsed into silence. For a moment, their humor had brightened the room, almost as if Luna’s ineffable spirit had descended, brushing away their worries as easily as cobwebs. But in the wake of their laughter, the darkness rushed back in, crushing Harry and Malfoy under its weight.
“Everyone thought I did it in exchange for leniency. They were wrong.” Malfoy’s voice was sharp as the edge of a knife, his eyes glinting with the same steel. “My testimony was not a condition of my release. And I would have testified against that bastard even if they threw me in Azkaban for it.”
Headmistress. I have notes, I did trial batches, I ran the diagnostics and calculated the transference slippage. It was all fine! It’s ready, it’s safe – and I – I have a prior case!”
“You said that when it worked the first time, you were not thinking about the duel. You reacted instinctively. Physically. As a kickboxer.” Draco paused, tapping a finger against his breastbone. “You were too focused on the magic this morning, too in your head. You needed to trust your body, to settle into the kickboxing. You needed to let the magic come unconsciously. That’s when you do your best spellwork.” Belatedly realizing that he was worrying at the spot where his own magic was hidden away, Draco quickly let his hand fall. “So I helped you to forget the duel.”
Ginny and Ron followed, already arguing about who could eat the most cake.
“I wasn’t snooping, I swear!” Harry blurted. “He was in the other room to get dessert ready, and I was just looking at some books when the letter fell out of one.” Harry swallowed hard. Despite his good intentions, telling McGonagall this felt like betraying Draco. “It was from the Ministry.”
When Draco looked back at him in confusion, Potter stared pointedly at the plate and jerked his chin toward Draco’s hand. Understanding dawned, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh. Astonishing even himself, Draco selected a biscuit and “clinked” it against Potter’s in a mocking little toast.
“Do you always wear such nice clothes when you cook?”
Harry’s breath hitched. He cupped Draco’s face in his palms and gazed at him with such obvious love that tears pricked at Draco's eyes. Harry’s mouth moved over Draco’s then, so slowly and so thoroughly that it felt like worship.
As he watched Malfoy’s careful movements, Harry’s dueling high began to fade.
When McGonagall began to clear away the tea things, Harry stood up gratefully. He was more than ready to drag Draco to the Great Hall for a late breakfast.
Beneath the sharpness of the hooks, Harry had found the magic of the flowers. It was like dipping his fingers into the tin of balm that had once soothed his Quidditch injuries. Laughing aloud in relief, Harry armored himself in it. The hooks retreated, the pain fading away.
Harry had expected a snarky comeback, something light and playful, but a strange tension overtook Malfoy. He was quiet for a moment, then said, “No, I’m afraid that honor belongs to Granger.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said, blinking rapidly. “That sounds lovely.”
“No, it didn’t hurt,” Harry assured him. “The barrier was still there though.” He hesitated before adding, “I was stuck on your doorstep for a while.”
Harry read aloud.
“Yeah,” Harry said, kicking off his trainers and making his way across the flat.
Draco shifted, lifting his head to look up at Harry.
“That sounds really cool,” Harry said.
“Yeah.” Harry blushed, then waved his fingers in a weak imitation of confetti. “Surprise?”
“I know,” Harry said. He did know. He wasn’t quite sure what he was saying.
Head still reeling, Draco found himself struggling to absorb everything that had happened. But then his mind blanked out, because Harry was on the floor in front of Draco’s chair, pulling Draco down beside him.
“Alright, Weasley?” he asked.
Draco looked affronted. “No, he most decidedly did
Harry perked up at that. “Yeah,” he said, his sudden grin practically blinding. “Sounds good.” He wiped his hands on a dish cloth and grabbed a jar of Floo powder to offer to Draco.
was elbowed earlier.
Draco wishes he could remember more than fragments. If he did, a lot of this would make more sense.
Draco, thankfully, isn’t looking at him. His eyes are focused on Isabelle in his lap, who’s kneading his leg and purring so loudly that Harry can hear it a few feet away. It brings a smile to his face.
Neat, purposeful, stylistic cursive. The loops on his R and O curl elegantly. The green ink shines in the light of the fire before it dries, color lightening slightly. He skims over the letter once more, making sure it sounds how he wants it to.
What she said
So, as he always does, he watches Draco. It would be simple to say that he fell for Draco because of his looks — the curve of his neck as he turns his gaze towards the sky, the snowflakes on his eyelashes, or his too-pointy chin and nose.
nothing. A gross abuse of power, or there’s a mistake, but it’s nothing valid.
His patience snaps, and he scowls in Agnes’s direction, roughly jerking his curtain back further as he abandons the paper and stomps to her bed. How is he supposed to learn anything about who he is if he can’t even hear himself think?
, says with a bashful smile. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Draco—can I call you Draco?”
Draco wipes his lipstick off with a napkin.
Merlin, he’s missed them all.
The short witch working with memory-Draco gives Potter a smile and tells him she’ll be with him in a minute.
and the plot thickens. 👀 Who knows what's going to happen next! Definitely not me.

Draco raises his eyebrows. He
Draco does so, shifting on the narrow bed to get comfortable. He doesn’t exactly know what they mean by a “show,” and he watches curiously. Bryn clears their throat and gives him a reassuring smile before they roll up their sleeves, raising their wand.
Bryn’s expression is one of understanding and kindness.
He glances from the right to the left, trying to decide which direction to go. He has no idea where the potions storeroom is, though he imagines that it’s close by, considering that each ward has its own storeroom.
“I’ve missed you,” Harry says, laughter fading.
He rolls his eyes, but ducks back into his curtains anyway. Wagner can get strict about patient confidentiality, so he probably wouldn’t take kindly to someone spying on them.
Draco laughs, and they talk a little while longer before he leaves Agnes to herself. He glances at the clock out of habit once he steps out into the ward. Four-twenty. He could theoretically wander around the hospital for three hours until the end of Wagner’s shift, if he felt like it.
“While I can help you adjust to life without those memories and be here for emergencies, I can’t prevent further damage if I don’t know what caused it in the first place.”
“Blaise, what?” a light voice comes from behind Harry, and he freezes.
