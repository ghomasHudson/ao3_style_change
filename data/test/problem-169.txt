He gave a shy smile and brought my hand lower, hovering over his erect member. I swallowed, glancing back at him, unsure of his intentions here. "Can you deny what you do to me?" he asked quieter.
"I don't know..." He huffed, crossing his arms. "I mean, I do hope I could be a good Father one day. And I do want lots of kids; I don't care about the 'one Malfoy heir' rule, I want lots!" Draco seemed to get over zealous about it all which made Blaise laugh.
To his complete horror, Draco found that with each breath all the negativity and stress he had started to fade away. His hands unclenched and the tremors he got in them still started to relax as well. He even got a soft smile on his face as he closed his eyes, his mind clearing as every thought just drifted away. He was empty, he was calm, he was at peace...
For some reason, I felt like giving him a little smirk. So I did. "This is turning out to be quite a mystery, Malfoy."
"Harry is not gay and neither am I! I should know seeing as I'm his lover!" Draco practically shouted gaining the entire Hall's attention. Blaise and Pansy shared a look as he cursed under his breath.  They didn't exactly go over how they were planning on coming out as a couple, but it definitely wasn't like this.
"I wonder what he was talking about," he said over the top of his drink he was sipping. All the Gryffindors at the table went back to their eating or looked away from his glance; Harry could tell that none were willing to give him the information or knew of it. So he read the headline himself. He didn't even finish reading it when he burst out laughing.
"I know that too, but it's hilarious Dray." Draco gave in and read it. Unlike Harry, he read the whole thing without stopping to laugh. He shared a few glances and a smile with Harry but nothing more until he finished.
"Let's go find out," he answered, scrambling up off me without brushing himself off. I grinned after him.
List?" I couldn't help it, the chuckles just flew out of my mouth. But the poor guy just stood there, a slightly amused scowl on his face and hands on his hips, tapping his feet away until I stopped and wiped my tears away.
"Fifteen's a good number," he agreed, melting into another kiss...or fifteen.  After all, there was an eternity of fifteens to be had now.
"Harry!" He whispered, delighted, spinning around to actually see him and then kissing him passionately.
"You know," Seamus began. "The funny thing is is that Harry basically said the same things before he admitted to being gay by..."
Potter must have leaned in to whisper because Draco felt his breath on his ears and neck as he spoke. "Dumbledore wants us to be lovers, not friends." He leaned back in time not to get whiplash from Draco's snap of the eyes and swivel of the head.
"It's Harry, Pans. Draco's all friends with him now and he's obviously taking him being a recluse badly." Blaise spoke for Draco. "Stop playing with your soup, Draco. I'm sure Harry will be down tomorrow."
Draco, who did not want to have a debt unfulfilled with Potter and saw this, jumped in the way yelling, "Potter!"
"It's an old sheet of parchment paper that had a sort of glow about it. And when I got the courage to finally peek at it, I discovered that it listed everyone's name under the section of Naughty or Nice. At first, it was just something to laugh at. Some people were still switching sides, you know," he paused a moment to share with me a conspiratorial grin. "And then I saw my name at the very bottom of...thenicelist."
Tight green shirt and black trousers. I could see the outline of his nipples and...other anatomy. I felt a shiver of arousal shake me and the elbows I held myself up on wavered. This was definitely the oddest thing I had ever gotten myself into.
naked and so unashamed. He raised an eyebrow at my looking and I flushed away. I imagined that he must have softened because he became so gentle with me in every way.
"I know what doesn't tickle..." Draco murmured smugly, before kissing him gently and slowly. Harry sighed. "And I know something else that doesn't tickle," Draco began before pulling out a black velvet box, hands shaking only slightly from both his old tremor and nerves . Harry gasped. "Will you marry me?"
He gave me a look but I just shrugged. I wanted to hear it out of his mouth I guess. "You are the first one under the Nice List. Actually, why don't you see for yourself," the grin he gave kinda scared me a bit. No, just made me apprehensive. Really apprehensive.
About a week into the school year, Draco accepted Harry's 'truce' and Hermione hooked up with Ron finally. The boys gave the school one month of being civil and friendly, before they went and did all the things that were normal to them. The Gryffindors and Slytherins quickly followed the leads of their most popular respective members and gave up overtly trying to be enemies; instead they also were mostly civil, because they either got one of the two threatening and screaming at them no matter the House, or both would descend upon them and hex them until they were scarred into compliance. And slumber parties at random Houses also became regular occurrence thanks to the dynamic duo. But Harry had to go and ruin all that they had finally accomplished as normal.
"Ugh, just get out of here before you incur 'Mione's wrath." Most of the boys, even Ron, left at that but Seamus was on a roll today for annoying the Boy-Who-Lived.
"Merlin's bloody staff!" he yelled, but kind of quiet because it was past curfew and he was sneaking around, while I laughed at how he jumped. "I think that takes care of our Life-Debt," he grumbled only a moment later, probably meaning that I had scared him half to death.
It was the night of the final battle--(not that Voldemort knew and the Light could only hope for at the moment)--and the great Dark Lord decided to call all his minions to witness the Malfoy heir officially join their side. Many of them were eagerly waiting for the signature blonds to appear, it had been a long time since any had to do initiation and many were looking forward to seeing the Malfoy brat cry. Then, finally, the family apparated in. Lucius got down on his knees as soon as he was there, his son following only a moment later.
"I thought you said-" I couldn't finish. My heart was beating way too fast now and oxygen seemed to be thinning out.
Draco sighed through his nose as he lowered the article. So much for discretion. He risked a glance at Potter, catching those impossibly-green eyes of his once-lover, and noted the concerned expression in them. He shook his head with the simplest of smiles and Harry continued his enthusiastic conversation with his Trio. It wasn't like he could say no to him. Not any more. He'd just have to hope few people took Skeeter at her word anymore and deal with the fallout later.
“Don’t think he’s been sleepin’ too well, Hermione,” Ron muttered, his mouth full of breakfast, “It’s been nonstop tossin’ and turnin’ for the past several nights.”
Draco felt dejected, but desperately wanted to keep Harry from having a panic attack. So he lied, “It must have been the adrenaline.”
“Well you assumed wrong Potter,” Draco drawled, his smirk back in place, “It’s much more fun to keep at this game.”
A small smile spread itself against Draco’s mouth despite himself. Even though he’d been so firm with Potter the other night in the tower, he couldn’t help but feel giddy at the prospect of meeting him alone once again. But, the ‘Room of Requirement’, what and where was that? Draco thought properly for a moment, and was able to deduce that it must have been where he caught Potter sneaking off to, where those silly meetings of his were held. Yes. Yes he’d meet Potter there tonight. He’d accept Potter’s invitation. It was as though he was taking steps towards a world he knew nothing about. An exciting, exhilarating world, but unfamiliar nonetheless.
“It definitely wasn’t just you, Ron,” Hermione replied cooly, crisply contained irritation evident in her voice, “He’s becoming insufferable, and Snape’s even worse!”
He breathed out curtly through his nose, trying to bring himself back into the moment at hand. Right. He had been walking with his friends, but it appeared as though he’d lagged behind whilst in thought. His friends weren’t anywhere in sight.
“Yeah you bloody well look it,” Ron bit back gently, sniggering softly between the two of them. Harry couldn’t help the small smile that formed on his lips. He appreciated his friends to no end. He just wished he could vent to them about this entire Malfoy nonsense. But it was better kept as a secret. No public outcry in a secret.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize my concern for you was so amusing,” Hermione barked, flushing with frustration.
“I woke up,” she said matter-of-factly, still looking into the fire. “I woke up with a strange feeling in my stomach, and thought the best thing for myself was to come down here.”
The lesson ended shortly thereafter and the students around him stood in a buzz, anxious to leave the room. Chief among them were his friends, who were already talking about what their plans were for winter break.
Draco worked him slowly, teasingly deliberately, drinking in the moans and gasps that Harry produced with relish. Never in his wildest dreams did he think he would be hearing these noises. He reminded himself briefly to never forget them, because he’d probably never hear them again.
“What the fuck, Potter?!” Draco groaned, clutching his ribcage where Potter had grabbed him. He glared at the dark haired boy, confusion written on his face. Potter matched his expression.
“I said,” Draco started, “Goodbye, Potter.” He spat the surname of his nemesis with venom, his expression hardening into one of frightened hatred. What if someone had seen them? Potter was entirely too careless. Disgraceful.
“Sleep well Harry,” she mirrored, returning her gaze once more into the fire. Sometimes Harry wondered what all went on in his friend’s head. What did Hermione think about in moments such as this, staring fervently into the fire? He would have asked her, had it not been for his bed calling his name.
Once Ron managed to calm down, he helped Harry up and they made their way to the infirmary, just to make sure it was nothing serious. Madame Pomfrey gave them a solemn stare as they explained what happened.
Draco’s breathing became heavy, the lust and tentative euphoria he normally withheld taking control of him. “I won’t,” he promised before pressing his lips into Harry’s.
“I’m not gay, Draco!” Harry shouted exasperatedly, looking at him with an urgency Draco couldn’t place. But his heart did stutter when Harry said his first name.
“I can still remember it clearly, fifth year, autumn, the room of requirement.” They both chuckled softly at that.
“That’s not exactly what I meant,” Ron mumbled, fiddling with a loose string on the cuff of his shirt, “What I meant was that you’ve been off the last couple of days. Like you’re not you or something. I mean bloody hell, you ran into a pretty large column like it was nothing! Is there anything bothering you?”
She smiled, “Lysandra.” The moment the word left her lips, the time surrounding the dream stopped. Draco felt his heart beat rapidly, so loud it was pounding through his blood. Lysandra. He suddenly felt sorrow envelope his entire being, a mourning of something or someone he didn’t even know yet. He felt wettness on his cheeks, but he didn’t even care. He just stared blankly ahead.
Draco, as well as the rest of the class jumped, startled as Potter and the Weasel entered the room. The Slytherin’s heart leapt as well, but for different reasons. It always did that when Draco saw Potter, even though he’d tried not to think about him since that night in the Astronomy tower. Avoiding thoughts of Potter was impossible for Draco. He mentally sighed, dejectedly turning around when Potter’s eyes met his. None of that, now.
Potter. After cleaning himself up, Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror, staring into stormy grey eyes. His eyes looked like the smoke from a house on fire. The impossibility of his feelings hit him full force and he trembled ever so slightly. ‘It… it isn’t so bad,’ Draco tried to convince himself, rubbing a hand down his face. At least he had these fantasies, these private moments with just himself.
He had to stop himself from sighing dejectedly at the thought. It just wasn’t worth it. Nothing was worth it. Christmas was fast approaching, and Draco felt as though nothing would be the same after the break. He had a gut feeling that something was going to happen that would change things. He had to nip whatever this was with Potter in the bud. Before they did something irreversible.
Wordlessly, Malfoy got up and walked over to Harry, grabbing his shoulders. Harry just looked at the ground, concentration and frustration written in his entire body.
“I’d drag you down with me, Malfoy, don’t think I wouldn’t,” Harry bit back, his wild, shaggy black hair falling back into place as the wind died down. He cut his eyes to Malfoy, who was still staring at him. For some reason, this encounter didn’t feel like any other one Harry faced with Malfoy. There didn’t seem to be any malicious intent. But Harry didn’t let his guard down.
Anxiety and self-doubt started to cloud Harry’s mind. He was so stupid. Malfoy wasn’t coming. He ran a hand through his hair, effectively disheveling it. He really didn’t need this added stress.
“Don’t do that ever again,” Harry gasped delicately as he felt one of Draco’s cold hands grip his hip, touching the small strip of skin showing between his blazer and trousers.
“Then why…” Harry started, blinking quickly to prevent tears, “Why were you up there?” He realized how shaky and pathetic his voice sounded. It sounded like he would shatter. Draco’s face morphed into one of severe concern as he saw how shaken up Harry was.
“I don’t see how it could have gone any other way, Draco,” Harry mumbled, remorse in his eyes as he stared up at the man above him.
Still, it was fun to think about from time to time; Malfoy’s hair, his hands, his lips, they were all there in the recesses of Harry’s consciousness. He needed to talk to him, and for this, a plan was needed.
Neville sighed before speaking, “It’s nothing serious. I just think Harry should know that earlier tonight, Malfoy was watching the quidditch team practicing. Specifically you, Harry.”
“Thank you,” a delicate pause, “For helping me. I guess. I’m not gay but… well I know I’m not straight now, don’t I?”
Harry looked at him with pleading eyes, desperate for some sort of answer, “Malfoy wait!” The Gryffindor grabbed a hold of Draco’s wrist before he could truly leave. Draco looked down at Harry’s hand with nervous agitation, his brows furrowing. Back to ‘Malfoy’ huh? So soon? He almost chuckled darkly.
“It… it’s ok, Harry,” Draco spoke softly, so softly that it was almost a whisper. “I know you didn’t mean to.” He couldn’t stop the hurt from leaking into his voice.
Harry looked at him with a sort of fascination. Malfoy didn’t look so snide and evil today. What changed? Harry took care to notice the sharp point of Malfoy’s nose, and the way part of his blond hair fell over his forehead. His skin was very pale and smooth, almost as if it was porcelain. Strange how Harry had never really bothered to look at Malfoy with anything more than contempt before now.
Harry blinked, not sure if the interaction he’d just had with Malfoy was real. He felt like he’d done something wrong, even though every logical part of his brain told him otherwise. He’d never had a reason to trust Malfoy before, so why let himself be tricked into starting now?  No, this whole thing was a touch too unbearable for Harry’s taste. Still, there was something that was bothering Harry that he couldn’t quite place. It was as if he was forgetting something that he didn’t even know about.
Feeling either brave or careless, Draco hopped onto the railing and sat, one arm wrapped around a post for security as his feet dangled more than a hundred feet above the ground. He didn’t look down though, only up. It was a new moon this night, so the stars had ample opportunity to shine. He smiled to himself, letting his mind wander back to Harry.
Still, Harry owed it to Draco to at least say something on the matter. He cleared his throat, feeling still grey eyes on him as he spoke:
So, much to Draco’s chagrin, this was the perfect time to address the issue causing his stomach to flip. Harry fucking Potter. ‘Why does it always have to be about Potter?’ Draco thought with a moan, taking another bite of apple.
“For FUCK’S sake, Potter!” Draco threw his hands up in exasperation, causing Harry to take up a defensive stance whilst reaching for his wand.
Ron and Hermione exchanged understanding looks, and turned back to Harry, sympathy on their faces. Harry felt quite uncomfortable. If there was one thing he couldn’t stand, it was pity.
Malfoy glared at Harry, until realization slowly overcame his visage. He sighed, chuckling darkly as he shook his head.
Draco sighed dramatically, “I don’t think I’ll tell you, Pansy.” He was good at this game because he played it quite frequently. He always seemed to be fishing for his friends’ curiosity.
With his confidant mood diminished, Draco sat up, masking his unease with a calculating snarl. “Are you quite finished?”
“Why on earth would I be in love with Potter of all people? I despise him, and I thought that much was obvious.”
He took this moment to soak up details of Potter’s sleeing figure. His features were much softer as he slept, unable to glare bitterly at Draco. Potter snored lightly again. His hair was always such a mess. Draco wondered if the boy even owned a comb or a brush. Probably not.
So preoccupied with his thoughts was he, that he didn’t see the column directly in front of him. He walked into it full force, successfully banging his nose into stone with full force.
Harry finally turned to face his rival, making the other boy jump slightly. He was too tired to deal with Malfoy and his mind games. “So is this it then? Your grand plan? To toss me over the breeze way? I have to say, Malfoy, I’m a little disappointed. I was expecting something far more creative.”
He hated to admit it, but he was slowly starting to consider Malfoy a begrudging acquaintance. Not much, but still leaps and bounds better than mortal nemeses.
“Seems like an awful lot of trouble for the infamous Harry Potter to go through all on his own. And just think of the mess! I’m not sure your eyes would be able to handle that much blood.”
“Miss Granger,” Snape whirled around to stare directly at Hermione, “If you deem it necessary to disrupt my class with your chatter then you may excuse yourself. Ten points from Gryffindor.” Hermione fumed silently after that, nearly breaking her quill as she returned to her notes.
“You? Best me?” Potter’s laughter rolled off of his tongue as he looked at Draco with mischevious eyes, like that of a cat about to tackle its mate, “I’d like to see you try.” Draco almost felt as if the room was closing in around him. He didn’t like this feeling, but at the same time he was addicted to it. Why did this feel so strange? Did Potter know?? How could he possibly know? Nothing made sense but everything made sense. Draco started to breath a bit faster.
“I’ve missed you too.” Harry had never seen this girl in his life. He knew he hadn’t. But still, she looked so familiar, and at the same time, he knew her very very well.
Draco bit his lip, concern etched onto every feature of his face. He backed away from Harry slowly, silently collecting himself.
“That’s why I’m here too. Far too many distractions in the Slytherin dorm for my taste.” Malfoy began to spread some papers out along with the books he’d slammed down to wake Harry up.
“It’s… it’s shit like this… with you… god, it’s burning me up,” the boy panted, taking off his glasses and setting them on a side table.
“Try to ignore them Harry,” she whispered good naturedly, “If they manage to get a rise out of you they’ll never stop.”
Draco’s warm, happy demeanor melted away into a calloused, calculating one as he remembered himself.
Draco rolled his eyes, smirking in his signature fashion, “Are you really that surprised that I found where you and your lot disappear to, Potter?” Draco had drawn his wand as well, readying it in case Potter struck.
Yes, there was absolutely no way that these conditions were caused by Malfoy, unless he hexed Harry or something. Maybe he’d stop by the medical wing and see if he’d contracted some sort of illness. There was one thing that Harry knew, and that was that he didn’t feel good.
“Look, Harry,” there was a serious tone to his voice that Harry had never heard before, “I know you’re confused. Probably scared. Fuck, so am I. But, I enjoyed this. Before we started talking at least. And I know you did too.” Harry’s mouth started to tug into a grin, but he withheld it.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose in an exasperated manner, groaning. “If I’m always plotting something, then why would I feel the express need to give you a note about it on this certain instance?”
“Fine Potter. Enjoy your paranoia,” Draco turned briskly on his heels and strode down the breezeway and back inside the doors of Hogwarts.
The dream ended the second Potter’s lips had touched his, and Draco awoke with a start. His eyes were brimming with tears, and he quietly fumbled around for a scrap of parchment and a quill. He had to remember her. He had to find a way to remind himself.
He’d been planning this really ever since the night at the Astronomy tower with Malfoy. The blond git was going to help him whether he wanted to or not. But still, would he even come? Would he show up? Why would he? He hated Harry. The more Harry thought about these questions, the more he reminded himself that it was Malfoy who had initiated the kiss, not Harry.
Draco thought about all the intimate situations that he had been in with Potter over the term so far, and blushed. He forgot that he was still staring at the object of his affection, and when Potter turned to face him, Draco immediately turned away, as if he’d been burned. Great. Now he was giving the Gryffindor unnecessary ideas. Just great.
“What’s wrong, Neville?” she asked, causing the boy to look at her instead. Harry’s attention turned towards the both of them as Seamus rambled on.
Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Harry looked around, trying to gather his bearings and remember where he was. Ah, the library. Suddenly Harry remembered Malfoy, and he jerked his head to the side, but Malfoy was no longer there. How many hours had Harry been sleeping?
“My friends wouldn’t lie to me, Malfoy. They’re not like yours.” Potter was slowly walking closer to Draco, who was hyper aware of the other boy’s movements.
After about ten minutes of contentedness, they put their clothes back on, fumbling as they did so. The fire had receded down to mere embers as they sat on the loveseat, a glass of cognac in Draco’s hand. Harry was resting his head on Draco’s lap, enjoying the feeling of the other’s slender fingers combing through his hair.
“Malfoy weasled his way into the Room of Requirement last night,” Harry whispered as the conversation started to come to a lull. His friends stopped, staring at him with gaping mouths, concern written sloppily across both of their faces.
The frizzy haired girl opened her mouth, looking as if she wanted to say something, but closed it instead. Finally, she sighed, “It wouldn’t have hurt to let either Ron or me know, Harry.”
Hermione sniffed, outwardly disapproving of Ron’s table manners, or rather, lack there of. “Well obviously he’s been having trouble sleeping. Do you see how out of it he is? He looks like a ghoul.”
“I miss you more, Lys.” He gave her an affectionate eskimo kiss, from which she giggled delightedly.
“What do you want?” The words were cold but tired, dry like a stone. Potter was no doubt grateful when Draco leaned against the table and lowered the impaling brightness that his wand exuded.
Feeling himself getting hard, Harry growled, taking control as he flipped Draco onto his back, straddling him. He left the blond’s lips and started trailing wet kisses along his jaw and down his neck, slowly grinding against Draco’s steadily growing erection.
Zoo Whee Momma. Have y'all tried the new(ish) orange/vanilla coke? I like it. Anyway, here's the next chapter. Spice at the end. Enjoy perhaps. Yes?
Potions class was near misery. Harry could hardly concentrate thanks to the pair of stormy grey eyes watching him from the back of the class. Malfoy and several of his lot had been chattering lowly for a while, Snape conveniently managing to ignore them.
“Feeling bold are you? Are you finished?” Draco’s words were solid and stone, excluding as much emotion as he could. He almost always did it well.
“Must’ve been someone else the idiot mistook for me. I’m not the only blond Slytherin, you know,” Draco sniffed, successfully covering up his panic. This is something that could never be discovered. Not by anyone, but especially not by someone like Longbottom.
Dejected, the blond stepped back. He realized that there wasn’t any real way that he could get through to Potter without time. He really wasn’t planning on telling Umbridge anything, but obviously Potter would rather excessively worry than believe him. Brilliant.
even though I’ve told him numerous times to stop, he just won’t! I told him, the next time he did, I’d go straight to Robards.”
“Jeez, guys, you know I’m not the one to ask about this kind of thing…” He looked between his two friends. “Ron, I don’t think ‘eating for two’ is a thing, coz your baby is still so small. You can’t make her eat if she doesn’t want to. That said… Mione, maybe have a bit of toast and egg..? Are you still feeling sick?”
“Of course not.” Harry stood and wrapped Luna in a hug. “Thanks. For being you.” She immediately snuggled into his arms, holding him back just as tightly.
He’d be working from prickly square one again, but that was okay. Harry had all the time in the world, and this time he would be easing the way past Draco’s defenses with courting gifts and grand gestures. “Is that Draco’s newest letter?” Just like Molly, she was. It was terrifying, really.
“Yeah. My core is a magic heart. Is it… Does that mean that something could hurt it? Can I get, like, a core attack, or something?” Minerva looked a bit surprised, like she hadn’t expected Harry to ask a medical question.
Tonight is the night of the full moon. I feel more confident about this one, particularly because I’ve managed to brew and take a dose of my own potion. It doesn’t ever end up tasting much better, but knowing that I made it myself, I feel much more at ease. Hopefully by the time you get this there’s still time before daylight. It’s silly, I know, but… I would prefer if I knew that you were going to be transformed as well, during the moon. It would comfort me.
it mean? All that was coming to mind were thoughts of being Draco’s perfect match, running with him during the moons and caring for him afterwards. A mate was a partner, weren’t they? And that was exactly what Harry wanted to be for Draco. Which meant—
bad idea." Ah, Ron. He was so wonderfully predictable. It was a little sad. Honestly, it irked Harry just a little bit.
Oh. Oh, he loved it. It had a nice walk-in shower in one corner of the room, toilet on the other side with sink and cabinets nearby, and there, in the middle of the room, was a
One, he knew that Helena’s mother's diadem was in his Room of Lost Things. It was placed high atop a wardrobe, crowning a mannequin head with a musty wig. It marked the spot of a few treasures-- most notably a ratty old potions book.
“She liked to write the dates on all her pictures.” Narcissa turned the picture around and pointed. “There we are. ‘1967, summer.’”
“When I find him, I’ll be bringing him back, that’s for sure.” Draco continued to amaze and terrify Harry. Even he would never run from the hospital with a werewolf bite. Taking a look around the room, Harry noted how everything was clean and tidy, and none of Draco’s personal effects were left in the room. He’d definitely left of his own will.
Harry nodded and finished off his sandwich. It would be nice getting home at a reasonable hour, maybe be able to push the paperwork until tomorrow morning… he could already imagine the little lie-in he'd have… Now the raid just had to go right. Right. Cause everything was just that easy for Harry bloody Potter.
Thank you for keeping mother company. You know well by now that the days since the war haven’t been kind to her. I hadn’t thought about what my leaving will do to her, but I dread what my return will entail. This is what’s best, right now. It has to be.
“I’m sure I would. You’ll have to bring her to visit someday. Then you and I can laugh over Devin making the crude jokes and October giving everyone far too much wine.”
"Oh yes, that's mostly what I do now. Complex charms, but very satisfying work. I do love seeing young people in love," she mused, smiling at him. "Are you interested in bonding jewelry, Draco?"
Leesy approached her Master and Mistress, holding out the small bag containing their belongings. “Here, Mistress-- Leesy has done the collecting.” Narcissa thanked the elf and tucked the bag inside another of her hidden pockets. The elf nervously wrung its hands as Lucius accepted the portkey-- a broken men's wristwatch-- from the green flames in the hearth. “Will Master and Mistress be returning?”
“I think you like him a lot more than you’re letting on,” Sapphire said, brow arched like she was daring Draco to challenge her. “I think you quite like him, even if he’s terrible with paperwork and all.”
I would love to make up for those things, yes. I heard the rumors about your childhood… Not so good, I take it?
"Oh, no no. Not Blaise. We're much better off friends. He's got his eye on a pair anyway, though he won't admit. He claims he enjoys the life of a bachelor."
“All my friends thought the same, at the time. I thought he was incredibly sweet.” Molly smiled at Harry. “So? What do you plan to get her?”
"I think it's part of why we didn't work out, you know? Charlie and I used to date—" A low unhappy grumble from the dragon. "—but we ended it on good terms. He loves his dragons, and I'm too busy building my career and pining after Malfoy." He laughed a little, shaking his head.
“You want me to sit there?” he asked incredulously. This had quickly moved from simply being on the top 10 list of strangest interactions he’d had with wild creatures to being the strangest encounter. The dragon looked at him as if Harry was the one that was crazy, as if to say, you wanted to sit down—so I made you a place to sit. What’s so hard to understand about that?
Okay love. You want to talk about kids? We’ll talk about kids. Yes, Teddy knows I am his godfather. He’s a bright little thing, turning 6 in April. So far, no shifts. I think you’re right about the Metamorphmagus abilities canceling out wolf genes… however, he’s what I’ve been calling moon-sensitive. He’s tired and cranky and emotional nearer to the full, and less so as it wanes. I think being around you would be good for him, he can see that he isn’t alone. And neither are you, don’t you forget. (I wonder if wolfsbane might help with those symptoms… professional wolf potioneer opinion?)
Harry had been her first client, which set her shop firmly on the map of Diagon Alley in the best way possible. Not that she’d ever use his name in advertising, but when asked where he got his tattoos, Harry always gave her name and address. Euthymia Baxter, 73 Diagon Alley, Queen of Wands Tattoo Parlour, established 1998.
Sensing the sudden change in mood, Harry wrapped his arm around her and pulled Narcissa in closer, so she could rest against him. “...he’s never not going to need you, you know. He talks about you all the time, and it’s always with the sweetest tone I’ve ever heard him use.” He rested his right hand on top of her left. “He loves you so much, you’re the one he loves most. Please don’t doubt that.”
"We aren't staying on very long. We change lines in a few stops. Besides… it's fun to stand up. When Tristan is with me, I have to sit down or he'll topple over like you did."
“So, dear… I’ve made a few changes to the upstairs bedroom.” Oh, right. Narcissa had put herself in the upstairs.
“Yes, ma’am.” She let him go and walked him to the door. Halfway down the wide gravel path, he focused hard on Pansy Parkinson’s lovely little house by the sea in Brighton. A moment and a pop later, he found himself striding up to her front door.
“No way to tell for sure. I tried to get close, the thing looked at me and it was scared, but then…” The older man shook his head. “I don’t know. It’s like he recognized me—definitely male. He really looked at me, and decided just like that that he
As was the case with most things, the grand plan to nominate Harry for Queer Eye had gotten easier once Ron’s lovely wife got involved. Being a relatively high-ranking Ministry official made her investigation easier when paired with her natural determination and desire to help her friends. Only a month after Ron’s brilliant idea, Hermione Jean Granger-Weasley sat her husband and sister-in-law down at her kitchen table, laptop open, parchments spread, and hair frizzy in excitement.
“If this is a holiday for you, then indulge just a bit.” She put a hand on her hip and fixed him with a look. “Come along, Mr. Auror, let your auntie give you sweets for breakfast.” A gorgeous tower of crêpes floated over, one at a time, and layered themselves on Draco’s plate. “I have a terrible sweet tooth, myself… are you the same?”
Harry missed him. His mother had brought out the baby pictures. They had both viewed Harry's memory of Lupin's shift. He groaned and covered his face with his hands. They weren't making it easy to stay away, and that wasn't even taking into account the fact that his mother had made up a room at Grimmauld Place for him… which was right next to Harry's. That was absolutely a courting step, and his mother knew it.
“...Is that it?” He wasn’t quite sure if he liked this duplicate, yet, or not. Bas laughed and shook his head just a bit.
“Oh- Oh, of course, my apologies.” Draco turned towards the rest of them, giving them a weak smile. “Hello.” Merlin, strike him down there. He looked over the rest of the family seated around the table. Two brown-haired cousins about his own age, a man and a woman, he assumed they were siblings. Two women in the kitchen one, tall and pale and the other more curved and tanned, bringing over plates and bowls of food— perhaps his father’s age, maybe older? October, of course, poured Draco a glass of wine and sat beside him. And, of course, the young woman with the nearly-purple braid who’d let him in sat opposite him. Wow. This was his family? Draco finally allowed himself to truly smile, shaking his head slightly. “I’m sorry, it seems you have me at a disadvantage.”
Yet again, Harry James Potter, you surprise me. Here I was, expecting you to be ready to play hardball, and now it seems that
allow it to be a garish travesty upon which I must suffer daily. Maybe when I come back, we can go to the shop and decide together.
Malfoy's light grey eyes stared up at the ceiling, terror clutching at his chest as hot tears slid down his sharp cheeks. He was dying. He would die on the floor of this bathroom, not at the hands of the Dark Lord for failing to complete his unwanted mission. But he was still scared, he didn't want to die… He didn't want to die.
The healer nodded, looking down at her clipboard. “She was contacted just before we checked on him this morning, though she was informed our visiting ours aren’t for another few hours. We haven’t told her yet of his absence.”
Overall, the situation had been handled both gracefully and callously. Myrtle Warren had been buried quietly and her Muggle parents Obliviated to think their poor daughter had died in a car wreck. The students were told it was suicide.
He followed her out the door and walked beside her, noticing that she kept walking past perfectly fine Apparition points. And they hadn’t taken the Floo network either. “How… are we going to be getting there, exactly?”
“But I’m gonna have to deal with Harry talking about him more than he already does, and he’ll probably start bringing him round for dinner with the family-”
“Yeah. Yeah, I think he’d like that, wouldn’t he? Probably wouldn’t be happy until he has a rose and lavender bath drawn for himself…” Fuck, he loved that brat. Narcissa laughed quietly, as if hiding giggles into her hand.
I am so excited for this fic! I hope you are too! That being said, please continue to send me your thoughts and support in the comments. I will be trying my hardest to keep all HP characters and Queer Eye gentlemen as true to themselves as I possibly can.
The thought of him taking notes and doodling in the same room that Remus taught almost brought me to tears. He belongs there, just like we do. We'll make it our home as much as Grimmauld is, I promise.
What Harry didn't see was the damage his spell had done. Large cuts had appeared on Malfoy's chest and torso, like he’d been flayed open with a sword, and he was bleeding. He lay on the flooding floor of the toilets, choking as he began to bleed out. His shirt became a frightening ruby red, and his blood tainted the water around him.
I’m glad they approve. I did like the pictures I saw that depicted it. Are there any others I need to be made aware of? I think I need a couple pictures from the front, just to be sure.
"Well, I'm learning to not care what anyone has to say." He didn't have many role models to disappoint, and his friends didn't tend to do the whole 'judge you' thing, besides Hermione. Harry, for the most part, knew what he wanted and did what he pleased. "Oh-- And I'll pop by the Ministry this week, fill in the vacation forms so Draco and I aren't blatantly skipping work."
joyful) from your mum, that's on me. Sorry love! They think the two of us raising Teddy is a wonderful idea. We'll have to ask Minerva about Teddy staying at Hogwarts with us… I'm sure it will be fine.
"Hoho! The boy knows his wine!" Remy was obviously very pleased. "Yes, Pinot gris. French this time, too."
"You're many things, ma'am, but an old woman isn't one of them." And even if she was, he wasn't bloody likely to agree with her. "I'll gather them for you, though. I'd like to help."
-Antoni getting on really well with Molly? "Why are you so skinny holy sh*t?" Bobby looking at Grimmauld Place like omg the House elf heads?? are not decor??
Draco felt a blooming warmth in his chest. He didn’t recognize it for what it was, but its presence fueled him to push further.
Harry looked apologetically at Hermione before his thoughts were brought back to Malfoy by something fluttering over to his desk. It was a paper crane. He looked back to see Malfoy looking at him out of the corner of his eyes, a calculating look on his pale face. The chattering amongst his group had diminished as Harry turned back around. He unfolded the crane to see a note:
Harry wanted to talk to Malfoy again. He didn’t need to – not really; the Slytherin watching him play quidditch wasn’t really a valid reason to accost Malfoy. But Harry being Harry saw no other option than to figure out some way of forcing Malfoy’s attention. ‘It’s logic,’ he’d tell himself as he ignored whatever lesson he was in.
Draco sat up, away from Harry as the boy recovered. When Harry came back to himself, he hastily pulled his underwear and trousers up, only now feeling the twinge of embarrassment. Did that just happen?
Slowly, as if testing the hot water of a bath, Malfoy brushed his lips against Harry’s. Harry, being rather impatient with things, grabbed a hold of the back of Malfoy’s head and forced him to deepen the kiss. Their lips locked and tangled in a mess of panting and saliva.
Harry stared blankly ahead, consumed with thoughts of a particular someone with wicked blond hair and a sharp glare. It had been exactly three days since the astronomy tower incident. Three days of madness for Harry.
“Well obviously not, mate. Out with it,” Ron spoke up, apparently having lost interest in Seamus’ riveting tale about Charms girl.
However, there were always moments where the memory of Malfoy, of that night would creep into his consciousness. They typically came, as one would predict, whilst he was trying to sleep.
Harry knitted his eyebrows together as he stared ahead, a coil of fear winding its way through his insides. “Yeah, you’re right. We’ll stop now.” Draco knew this was coming, he knew it was the only logical way this could go, but it still hurt. He refused to show any emotion to Potter, and arose from the couch swiftly, brushing himself off as if nothing happened.
At that, the girl gasped in an offended manner, holding a hand to her chest. They proceeded to bicker back and forth, effectively forgetting that Draco was there. ‘All the better,’ Draco thought bemusedly, returning to his work.
Draco wanted to scream. He wanted to scream so loudly that he’d never be able to speak again. Fucking Harry fucking Potter. Draco had never wanted to punch the glasses off of someone’s face more.
“You fucking weasel,” Potter hissed, “I would never imagine that even you would work for Dolores Umbridge. Although I can’t say I'm all that surprised.” Harry stealthily cast the disarming spell, which Draco blocked in the nick of time.
Pride swelled within Harry’s chest as he thought about how the banter between the two had gone. He’d actually managed to win a conversation with the Slytherin king himself. It was such a moment of secret happiness, that Harry almost forgot about Malfoy casually calling him by his first name. Strangely, he didn’t mind it.
They sat in charged silence, staring at each other with an unspoken challenge between the two. The tension in the air was a different kind, one that neither boy had ever felt, much less understood. All of this was so foreign to Harry, and so unobtainable to Draco, that it seemed as if this was just a fever dream. Draco sighed, resigning to be the one to break the silence:
Harry watched as the flames flickered and danced, alight with movement and life. How could something so beautiful be so destructive? When it was contained, it was so enjoyable it was almost holy; but a fire unfettered was a danger unlike anything else. ‘But still holy in a different aspect,’ Harry thought mirthlessly to himself.
Harry was having trouble finding the words to direct back at Malfoy, every comeback getting stuck in his throat as if it was too large. He tried to swallow, but found that his mouth was exceptionally dry. Since the only light in the room came from Malfoy’s wand, the shadows on the blond’s face were especially harsh and made it seem as though Harry was looking into the grey, steely eyes of a predator. Backing up still, he was suddenly stopped and realized that he’d hit the wall. No where else to run.
“I suppose, as far as my eyes handling blood goes, it’s all a matter of who the blood’s coming from. From you Malfoy? My eyes would have no problem handling it.”
Draco barked out a laughter so powerful that Harry jumped, expecting almost anything but this. After several moments of Draco not ceasing to shake with laughter, Harry started to get irritated.
For some reason, Draco thought this was obscenely funny, and let out a tilted, piercing laugh that no doubt disrupted the entire library. He caught himself and quickly covered his mouth with his hands, trying hard to subdue his laughter.
When Draco didn’t get the attention he so sought, he remarked, “I could help you get closer to whatever it is you’re admiring. I could just shove you over and you’d be all that much nearer.” He paused, giving time for Potter to react, which he did not, “It would be easy, Potter. No one would know.”
Tapping his foot impatiently, his mind raced with scenarios of how another conversation between Potter and himself would unfold. There were none that seemed to come easy. Why was it that any time Potter was involved, things became messy? Draco groaned softly, immensely grateful that he was alone.
The dark haired boy suddenly froze. Timidly, he raised his face to look into Draco’s eyes. Harry had a look of terror and panic on his face. Draco felt a pang in his heart.
Draco’s teeth were clenched, annoyance evident on his face, “Like you really don’t know, Potter. Perfect Potter, always the golden boy.”
“What are you doing up at this hour? You need to get all the sleep you can,” she softly scolded him as she moved around to sit down as well.
Rubbing one out was more difficult than one would think at Hogwarts, especially since no one got their own private room. Draco realized this was the first time he’d done this in a while. He breathed slowly, trying to control the shake in his intakes and exhales. After a moment of gentle ecstasy, the come-down of an orgasm, Draco cleaned himself off and tucked himself back into his pants. He rearranged his clothing and hair to look presentable, like he hadn’t just come harder than he ever had thanks to thoughts of Potter.
“I wish I could say I’m surprised,” Snape drawled from the front of the class, “20 points from Gryffindor, and do be seated, before I get angry.”
‘Well isn’t this rich?’ Draco thought, a small sneer on his face. Potter asking him for help? The very notion almost made him bark with harsh laughter. But he didn’t. He blew up, making his hair fall away from his eyes, if only for a moment. What could he do? What could he possibly do to help Potter?
Draco walked briskly through the corridors, heading towards the boys’ bathroom on the second floor. It was the same floor as Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, so typically people forgot about it. And Draco needed to be alone.
“He wasn’t by the field. He was sitting on a bench near the Herbology classroom, which is how I saw him. You can only see the quidditch players when they soar high from there though. So it’s probably nothing, but it’s Malfoy. So I just thought you should know,” Neville finished hurriedly, leaning towards Harry so he wouldn’t have to raise his voice.
Harry stared up at Malfoy, nervous self-doubt in his eyes, “I wanted, er, needed to speak with you.” He looked down, fiddling with his hands, “About that night we were in the Astronomy tower.”
Harry and Ron looked at one another, shrugging. Ron looked agitated and uncomfortable, the anxiety of the situation undoubtedly making him feel sick. In moments such as theseHarry was glad that he wasn’t Ron.
It had been several days since the conversation between Harry and Malfoy on the breezeway, and Harry was too busy with the DA meetings as well as homework to really remember the exchange at all. The only time he would allow his mind to go there was when he was trying to sleep at night. He didn’t enjoy this in the slightest. Often, the anxiety of the whole situation would keep him up at night, and he’d only manage to get 2-3 hours of sleep. It wasn’t ideal, but really, what did he expect?
Ron knitted his eyebrows together in a contemplative look. After a moment of thought, he spoke, “I suppose… especially if that’s what you think is best.”
Leaves fell around him like gentle rain. He was in a forest, but at the same time it wasn’t a forest. He walked forward, leaves catching in his hair and a chilly breeze kissing his face. The eyes of the trees blinked at him, warm and watchful like a caregiver.
“Ah, I suppose that’d do the trick,” she sighed, stretching and scooting closer to the fire, “But I wouldn’t be worried about Malfoy. He still hasn’t said a word to Umbridge about the Room of Requirement, and if he hasn’t now, then I don’t think he will.”
Rolling his eyes, Draco replied, “Oh please, don’t be so dramatic. It’s not as if you were asleep for more than 24 hours. It was a cat nap, you’re fine.”
“Yes you’re truly the worst at it. Which is why I’m not going to tell you a single thing. This is something that absolutely mustn’t be spread about.” Draco seemed to be quite pleased with himself. Until Blaise spoke,
“Don’t stop,” Harry whispered, “Almost… Draco I’m almost….” He came with a soft gasp, releasing into Malfoy’s hand. The blond made a tut of disgruntlement at this before bending down and picking up his wand to perform a quick cleaning spell.
His eyes followed Potter throughout their entire practice. He didn’t even realise he was staring for so long. The breezed rolled easily against his skin, tingeing his cheeks pink.
“I could go on with that for quite a while,” Pansy smiled deviously at the blond, “But for your sake I’ll say that I’m done.”
Gasping, he stood up and laughed as much as he could have, aiming his wand directly at Harry, “You dense-headed prick, should’ve finished me while you could have. But that’s a gryffindor for you, always have to have the last word.”
He yawned, just in time to see Malfoy coming out from behind a bookcase, flipping through a thick looking book.
“Oh no, we really must insist. We wouldn’t want to have the great Harry Potter kept waiting in St. Mungo’s.”
“There’s a chance he’d go to his mother.” That momma’s boy. “That’s the first place I can think of.” If he was with Narcissa, Harry would be bringing him straight back here. “Thank you so much for saving him… he scared me so much.”
“Leesy,” Narcissa spoke, closing her eyes. “The Manor is lost and we won’t be returning. Please, pack our things… and Draco’s… and bring them here. Make sure you aren’t caught. Quickly!” And the elf Disapperated with a crack. Lucius was already kneeling by the fireplace, calling in favors and throwing his name around to get a Portkey ready for them. The Manor was not an option, and they weren’t sure which Death Eater would think to look for them in France. It was too risky. He stood shakily and brushed the soot from his trouser knees.
"If my theory is correct, this just means you have more magical power to manipulate into your Animagus form. Assuming you learn how to reshape your core, the transformation should be incredibly easy for you. It might even take less time than the average witch or wizard."
That does sound lovely, when I eventually come home. Taking time for myself right now feels as though it's helping me in ways I didn't know I needed. Let's go back to that earlier bit, though...
"Oi, that's a bit inaccurate, I think. I think of myself as a 'knight in swirling robes', as should you," he joked, referencing a common phrase in Teddy's story books. And if anyone looked like a prince, it was definitely Draco. And faerie prince, at that.
“But it’s the only good one I’ve got!” He whined playfully, grinning at his wife. He made eye contact with Draco and gave him a little nod, like he was acknowledging that Draco was upset. "It's a good story, babe, why don't you let me tell people how we fell in love? Do I
“She would be, yes.” She sounded a bit lost in thought. “Very good, Harry, dear.” She read the letter and sniffed once or twice. If this letter, and this woman, were to be believed, then her son was in safe and loving hands.
And she was right. Harry was tired of apologies, by now. He was tired of people he barely knew saying they were so sorry for everything he had to go through, right before they practically threw themselves at his feet. He was tired of the people who’d stayed so firmly in the middle give half-arsed apologies to try to win their way into his good graces. But most of all… He was tired. He said nothing in response, and after a while, McGonagall simply nodded once and changed the subject, saying he was welcome to stay for tea, if he desired, but their lesson was finished for the day.
Harry hummed around his bite of sandwich. As much as he hated to admit it, the whole pureblood culture and traditions around marriage, the courting and the alliances, fascinated him. Odds were, his own father hadn't done much of it, because his mother wouldn't have known about it. "So my question is… why now? Why wait six years after Voldemort is dead to try this? Shouldn't they have, you know, joined up when they could?"
“Oh no, dear, Charms are just fine for me, though I could use a slight hand with the pixies.” The… Oh, she picked
Usually, Harry Potter began his day with a coffee and pastry from the little café around the corner from his office. Usually, he would spend an hour or so looking over the latest academic findings of other magizoologist researchers, or peruse a few of the new articles in
“Indeed it is. Your eyes, they have a golden shine to them they did not have a few days ago.” She wiped a few tears from his face using her thumbs. When had he started crying? “This will be your first change?”
"...it's really not as bad as he makes it seem. I do eat, you know." Mimsy placed the bowl of golden soup in front of Harry and he almost immediately began to drool.
Okay, so no magic in the first gift. Had to be visible, to show people they were in the process of being courted. Hm. “...what did he give you? If I’m allowed to ask?”
"The context is kind of a long story…" The two of them sat down, and Harry proceeded to tell her what had happened in the last month, give or take a few days.
“For the record, I was fine with him keeping his own last name, but he absolutely insisted. It took quite a bit of
Don’t worry, I’ll have Pans send you a couple of her books. She’ll be pleased to know that you’re finally turning over to the dark side, she’s been going on to me for ages about her dalliances. You know, she’s looking for husband number three, right now? If you have anyone in mind you aren’t particularly fond of, I can send them her way for you.
Speaking of clothing, you're not getting your pants or your shirt back. I've been wearing them to bed, they're incredibly comfortable.
“There was a Yule Ball, in our fourth year, and… He’s always the type to never put much thought into his hair, or his clothes, but… Watching him dance in his dress robes with that smile… It made me see him differently.” Draco had been struck speechless at the sight of Harry in his emerald dress robes, standing on the dance floor, surrounded by the wintry paradise that the Great Hall had become, faux snowflakes finding a place of rest in his dark curls. Even now, the memory made him blush and smile. “Of course, I’m fairly certain he hardly even noticed me. He was far too focused on some floozie a year above us.”
think it’s a little fast but — you weren’t the only one to have thought of it. I think you would do much better to remain Harry Potter-Malfoy, personally. It does sound pleasant, doesn’t it?
What on Earth and between these worlds has been going on? Draco speaks of you so fondly, and looks so absolutely stricken whenever he reads a letter from you, and yet he seems to believe the situation hopeless, and that there’s no chance of the two of you becoming an item together.
The thing about war is that a lot of people are lost… and when people are lost, those that remain feel the need to remember, which to a lot of young witches and wizards meant getting a tattoo, despite the negative stigma of the Dark Mark (which was much more a brand than ink, ask any magical tattooist.)
“Silver Prince it is, then. I'll pass the word. We'll have you spooking the students in no time, boy.”
This was just getting stranger and stranger by the second. A dragon Charlie had never seen before hating him on sight? There was a reason he was ‘The Dragon Charmer.’ Dragons seemed to instinctively love him. “Glad he didn’t. How are you feeling, by the way?”
He fucking hoped they had. That might make it all worth it, if his parents made it out of this war unharmed, alive, and out of the Dark Lord's clutches. He can only hope that's the case.
He gave a small sigh, nodding his head as best he could. “Yes, I’m fine.” She gently rubbed over his cheekbones with her thumbs, trying to comfort and soothe him.
He stayed and chatted with the pair of them for the duration of Draco's appointment, witnessing the tattoo form over that pale skin. When Euthymia was done and the dragon moved for the first time, coiling around Draco's bicep and fluttering its wings, Harry gasped and Draco grinned.
“I will. I’m so used to talking with him, even letters. And I want to keep making sure he’s alright. Especially so close to the full moons.”
Harry sighed, leaning back in his seat and sipping from his tea. “Not so good. Draco’s left the country.” To Harry’s surprise, Luna didn’t seem very shocked. She just sipped her tea and nodded, almost sage-like.
“Yes. I think I’d like that.” Bas patted him on the shoulder and headed back out to find him a pair. Valerie handed him the next item of clothing, which was a soft tshirt with grey sleeves and a heathered blue torso. Draco held the fabric in his hands gently. “Oh.” It was very soft fabric, though not quite as soft as Harry’s maroon shirt. It would only get softer with wear and washes.  Valerie forcibly spun him and pushed him back into the changing room.
“Wynter, what are you doing here?” Taking the letter from her leg, he stared for a moment. His mother. He had been expecting a letter from her, now.
I’m mailing you to tell you that Draco has been residing with me since just before the full moon. Yes, I know of his condition, and I am doing what I can to help him through it. I’ve already sworn myself to secrecy for him, no worries. I already adore him as if he were my own, of course. And that brings me to asking.
weird, even by Harry’s standards. He nodded slowly, taking another step closer. “Okay. Alright. I can take it off.” The look that Draco shot him was somewhere between hopeful and so distrusting. That dragon had really been him the whole time? Draco didn’t turn around, he remained facing Harry, which meant Harry would have to put his arms around Draco’s neck to get the collar off of him. Right.
“It is, yes. Sirius was… He was a fire, ever burning, and consuming anyone in his path.” Before Harry had realized it, he’d teared up, watching the photo loop a few times. He took off his glasses and wiped his eyes, sighing shakily.
Leesy did not like this one bit. Malevolent magic seemed to seep from the walls and foundation and all manner of undesirable characters roamed its halls. It was despicable what these evil people had done to her Master and Mistress’ home! These evil people probably killed young master Draco… The elf worked quickly to shrink and pack all the valuables and clothes her Mistress had asked. Young master Draco's was the easiest-- Leesy cleared the entire room. Satisfied, the elf Disapperated from the cursed manor with a crack.
Draco smiled at her. “I realized it when we were both still in school together.” She reached over and gently held his hand in hers, giving it a comforting squeeze.
“Oh my, that won’t do at all. I have plenty of rooms here, you know, please come and stay. We can put up wards around your room, if you’d like—”
“You mean the kissing? Oh, you get used to it, I promise. It startled me, the first hundred times or so, especially when friends of friends would do it when they met you. But it’s… nice. In comparison, English greetings seem a bit… stuffy, don’t they?”
The corridors were all blessedly empty, the students all in their afternoon classes. Minerva lead them to the Headmaster's office. The stone gryphon leapt away from the entryway, but Minerva stopped them.
I kissed him. I kissed him, and I put my hands at his waist and shoulder, and I wanted to do more. But he didn’t respond. He kissed me back for all of two seconds before he went stiff as a board against me. We pulled away, and he ran out the door and Disapparated before I could ask what was wrong.
That was an intense wank session you instigated in your last letter. Not even laid a finger on me yet, but you already know how I tick and what I like. I really wish I could include the sound in the photos, too. I wonder if it would make you melt easier, to hear my voice lull you to sleep, to hear the pet names in person, to hear all the naughty talk in person (of sorts).
They had just finished the “Make Ted Great Again” episode and, amongst the anguish of running out of new episodes, Ronald Billius Weasley had a genius idea. He’d turned to his younger sister, who had gotten up and taken the empty popcorn bowl with her.
I had no idea there were other Malfoys, as Draco told me a number of times that he was one of the last. I’m glad to know that this is not the case. How did he find you? How was his transformation? Was he in a lot of pain? His mother and I worry for him every day, so news that he’s being cared for by family is the best news I could get. Thank you for keeping his, ah, condition a secret.
Gwen hummed a bit and collected the empty wine bottles from around the room. “Mm, that’s good. Did you have an alright night, my dear? All things considered?”
What was- Oh. Oh, that was… That was nice. She was combing his hair back for him. Maybe Harry might have understood a little bit why Draco always ran to his mum whenever anything was wrong- Okay, no. He needed to
Netflix was a glorious muggle invention and the Weasleys had absolutely become obsessed when Hermione had off-handedly introduced it to them. Molly was a huge fan of competitive cooking shows, whereas Arthur was very much fond of the American version of The Office. Percy was a closet Sherlock fan while publicly binging The Crown and Reign. Bill and Fleur didn't watch much, but they did appreciate the foreign film section occasionally. George liked to have Friends on in the background while he worked on things for the shop, and it was all over once Charlie discovered the How to Train Your Dragon films.
colorful. It was bright pink with a multitude of swirls, sleeveless, and went to just above her knees. Harry imagined Luna would feel at home in it.
Opening the door with a smirk fixed on his face, he let one arm hand at his side while his other hand was tucked into one of the pockets. “Well?”
basic, but they made it clear I’d need a lot more training to be on the same level.” Alright, he had his bag, he just needed to reach in and grab the collar. That would be easy. Reaching slowly into his bag, he kept talking.
“Is there… more wine?” Miranda chuckled and popped the second bottle of that gorgeous sweet-bitter white wine.
Colin Creevy is the unfortunate soul that finds Draco Malfoy's corpse. His pale skin has taken on a grey tone and his eyes are frozen open. There is blood at his lips, much like there is everywhere else in the tiled room. Creevy's first instinct is to snap a photograph, but he thinks better of it, running off in terror to find Mcgonagall, to find Pomfrey, to find any teacher that can help… Because Draco Malfoy has been murdered in the 6th floor toilets.
“How are you doing? Are you holding up alright? I don’t use that salve much. Is it working pretty good for you?” The dragon snorted, smoke billowing out of its nostrils. He took that as an affirmative. Actually, it was pretty strange, this dragon seemed to be giving him real responses.
“I… Yes. I believe I did,” he finally decided upon after a moment of thought. She seemed pleased by this and nodded.
“That was many years ago. I only remember that I had numbing spells on me, and it lasted around six hours.” Wow, six hours. And then, baby Draco.
“Precisely lad! Supposedly the first Animagus was an Ýdr'yiòs descendant that skipped the dragon gene, but still learned to control the transformation, see?” As much as Harry hated to admit it, that made quite a bit of sense.
"On one condition," she interrupted with the ghost of a smirk. Harry stilled and raised an eyebrow. Oh this came with fine print?
He felt the hairs pushing up through his skin, and his teeth changing and reforming in his mouth, and he hated every moment of it.
Harry chuckled to himself and nodded. "Of course, dear. Back in a tick." And with that, he swept down the hall to his best friend's new office.
"He might not have… and that's okay." Remy gave him a smile. "Would you have been ready for him to return your attentions then?"
“Is everyone else here, yet, I’m starved,” Draco’s inked twin remarked as October handed him a glass of wine.
I'm glad the moon went well for you. Your best one yet, was it? That's good news for when you come home. Hopefully, it will be even easier for you then. Teddy was fine, just a bit achy and tired on the day of the moon. It was a bit hard for him to fall asleep until I curled up with him in his bed. (Wolves apparently make great body pillows for toddlers.) I doubt that he'll eventually shift himself, so it looks like he'll just have a bit of pain potion if he needs it. Maybe you two can cuddle for hours the morning after the full.
“Andromeda. She would say the camera loved her, but I think she loved the camera far more.” The photo showed a young girl, perhaps between her 3rd and 4th years of Hogwarts, dark curls pulled back into a low ponytail with a large bow. Her heart-shaped face and dark eyes made the foundation for woman Harry knew as his godson's grandmother, but what made him look for longer was her smile.
that animal. The first few serious attempts will feel like learning to Apparate, from my experience."
“Alright, then.” Though… Maybe it would be a better idea to go in with her. He didn't appreciate some of the looks being thrown his way. He shuffled into the shop after Valerie. The shop itself was… intimidating, but not scary. He definitely noticed the loud metallic buzzing noise before he noticed anything else. There was a man — in his 30s probably — lying on his back on the covered leather table near the back of the room, a woman hunched over and seated on a rolling stool beside him. Black gloves on and device in hand, it appeared she was laying out the outline for a larger piece.
He saw it before any of them did. Though the twins and the ministry worker Weasley were fighting valiantly, they hadn't seen Dolohov Apperate in behind Pius Thicknesse.
I originally wanted this to be longer, but I figured chapter 4 could be a nice mix of perspectives instead.
“Go ahead, I won’t keep you from your breakfast, Draco,” she teased, picking up her mug of honeyed tea and taking a sip. Her toddler squirmed out of her lap and made his way over to Gwendolyn, holding up his little arms, asking to be picked up. Draco watched as she beamed down at the little one.
“He does quite like them both, though my son has always been partial to a bit of vanilla bubble bath added to an essential oil soak.”
“No, you tell Mione that she’s got to be eating more, cause she’s eating for two, and maybe she’s not hungry, but the baby might be!” Oh jeez. Right in the middle of one of their spats about the pregnancy. Harry sighed and rubbed the back of his neck.
“I do, yes.” Luna spoke with that same cool, serene tone and fuck if that didn't creep him out. Harry gaped like a fish for a solid two seconds before he spluttered and squeezed her shoulders.
a term for a person’s magical core reacting violently to suppression of the person’s magic.” She paused, and Harry noted a look of sadness pass over her face. “When magical children were born into homes or cultures that persecuted magic, they often tried to push it down or bottle it up, and they developed what was called an
“He was my Auror partner. My leaving was… fairly sudden, for him,” he told them, unable to keep his fingers from drifting to his neck. Valerie caught the movement and bit her lip.
“Fine,” she sighed. “Just for his mother.” Right, because really, the person that tolerated Harry wasn’t Narcissa at all, it was Pansy, and probably Blaise too.
“No… I don’t know if I even am, yet. We had an… incident, a little over a year ago.” They both zeroed in on his face, attention solely on Draco and his story.
For years. What a wonder. "One could argue it's against my will," he couldn't stop himself from muttering. The likeness was shocking, though. He wondered if Alistair even realized. To Draco’s surprise, Alistair laughed, apparently having heard his utterance.
“Master and Mistress! Here much earlier than-- oh! Oh! Young master-!” The poor French elf had just noticed Draco, its huge eyes quickly filling with tears. “Oh terrible day! Wretched day!” It wailed, wringing its wrinkled hands as it shook on its bare feet. “Wh-what can Leesy do f-for Master and Mistress?” The elf seemed to remember itself, even amongst the shock.
And it… It was perfect for Draco. There was a four-poster bed with curtains he could draw, a nice plush looking chair next to a dark chestnut desk, a few shelves just waiting to be filled with books, and a wardrobe that Harry was
Narcissa still sobbed over the body of their son, but the two men were silent. Lucius slowly stood and approached his wife and child. Though Draco may not have died at the end of the Dark Lord's wand, he was still responsible for his death.
Draco read over the letter that had come in and had to take more than one calming breath. Something in him ached
Now, with the body of Draco Malfoy under a stasis charm in his office, Albus found himself in quite a similar mess. Minerva and Poppy had been shocked-- horrified-- though the boy had been neither witch's favorite student.
Draco's eagle owl Porthos had delivered the letter and promptly decided on a nap. It wasn't necessarily an easy fly, even for such a large and strong owl. Draco absentmindedly pet the great bird's soft head. Damn… he'd have to reply, wouldn't he? Harry might tear up the world in looking for him. (The stalking never really stopped, had it?) Setting the envelope aside, Draco sighed softly. He would have to reply, but it could wait. Flexing his fingers, he stared down at them. Already, he was feeling different. He didn't like it.
At first, Harry just prattled on about whatever came to mind, trying his best to stick to light, easy topics, not wanting the dragon to sense any tension coming from Harry. He told the dragon about the trip he had taken with Teddy last summer, when they had camped in a clearing a little like this one.
“Since always, I think. But I found out in primary when this girl offered me one. Yeah, I get all… blotchy and red? And my mouth itches and my tongue swells. Spent the rest of the day in the nurse’s office, after she gave me a few epinephrine pills. Not had a strawberry since.”
The dragon was clearly in pain, and Harry was incapable of leaving an animal injured when he knew he could help. But based on his earlier reactions, he wasn’t sure the dragon would let him near enough to heal his wounds.
Sitting on his bed, Auntie Gwen continued to smooth his fur back. “It’s alright, dear. I’ll stay until the morning, if you’ll have me.” He nuzzled more into her hands and whined softly. The ache inside was still there, but at least he wasn’t alone anymore. He could survive the night like this.
If only that had been the end of it. Bas and Val had taken him into shop after shop, and some of them they left empty-handed, but others, such as this one… “I look ridiculous.” He stood in front of the mirror, alone in his little dressing room, new Converse on his feet, light blue denim clinging to his long legs, and a dark “Hawaiian shirt” on his upper half. Bas had told him to cuff his jeans, and to keep the two top buttons of his shirt undone. Draco sighed. They were waiting to see how foolish he looked. Stepping out of the dressing room, he raised his arms at his side before tucking his thumbs back into the pockets.
He would have to make sure his own wolfsbane was strong and perfect, which would take a few tests, and only once it had gone correctly a few times could he even consider going back home. Sure, he and Aunty Gwen had been fine this past moon, but it had been an off-the-shelf potion.
Tears slid down Harry’s face, and he covered his mouth with the hand not holding the letter. Oh… He couldn’t imagine… His friend and partner was all alone, scared, and in pain— Draco had never sent a letter like this before. The raw emotion in it was almost uncharacteristic. “Harry dear, I- What is it? What’s happened? Is it Draco?” Narcissa was immediately on him, looking ready to snatch the letter from his hands.
Also, if I might suggest? Zacharias Smith apparently works for the Prophet now… I wonder if paparazzi make enough money to support their tragically young and beautiful Slytherin widows…
Hermione peeked at him over the rim of her alarmingly huge hand-thrown mug she’d picked up at the Christmas faire. “Of course you can. All we’re saying is you’ve got that look on your face.”
“Oh,” he said faintly, feeling himself balk at the thought. Weasleys. He had discovered the French Weasleys. And they were
He’d come into the purple and gold shop shy as anything, nervous about the process like most people are with tattoos. She’d just smiled and sat him down, asking if he had any ink ideas. He’d produced two letters— nearly 18 years old, and both to a one Padfoot, upon which Euthymia hadn’t commented. He’d shifted in his seat and pointed to where his parents had signed their names…
If you were here, Draco… I'd take care to get your collar on you, make sure it fits nicely but doesn't choke you. I'd make sure the desk wouldn't hurt your knees, and I'd have you kneel on top of it. If you were good, I'd reward you. And if you were naughty, I'd spank you until your arse glows pink. I'd take my time, because you're a gift meant to be savoured. I'd touch you all over, slow and steady. You'd call me a tease, and that would get you another little spank. I can imagine your little gasps already, baby.
“Poor ickle dragon, his fires don't burn so hot now, do they?” Peeves stared at him from the ceiling, grinning like some cat that got the canary. “Our little Slytherin prince has gone all silver!” He cried, and Draco frowned slightly.
"Quite literally, dear, but thank you for noticing," she replied, tucking the necklace-- Harry's necklace-- into a little black box for safekeeping. She attached a note reading 'For Draco's Bonding' to the box and vanished it to their vault.
Just at that moment, as though he'd summoned him, Porthos flew in with a letter from the very same wizard he'd been thinking of.
Harry took the teacup that had filled itself and floated up to him. “He does, I know he does.” Harry took a sip and closed his eyes for a minute. “It looks like I’m going to be stalking him again,” he tried to joke, but the atmosphere was too tense.
You’re such an utter sap. I’m rolling my eyes at you. Can you feel me rolling my eyes at you from that far away? I hope you can. Because it’s entirely deserved. Though I suppose I could be convinced to send just one more picture or two.
"I see," she said primly at the end of it all. "And are you, then, asking for training to achieve an animagus form?"
I completely understand about the complicated feelings over resigning. I'm sure you'd have much rather retired after a few decades on the force, dozens of high profile cases solved and criminals put to justice by your hand. But honestly Draco, you've done so much in such a short time that you shouldn't feel cheated or guilty, at least about this. Robards has extended a near-permanent invitation to tea, by the way. I went to visit the other day and I swear he was a bit teary-eyed.
and… And he felt like he was in pain. Not a pain from the change, but from something else. It felt like he chest
Jeez. McGonagall didn’t pull a single punch, did she? “Yes, ma’am.” If it was for Draco, though, Harry would do anything he had to. Even if McGonagall had him do nothing except sit still and quiet for the entire hour. He would do it for Draco. The key for him was motivation, as it had likely been for his dad and Sirius.
The rumor mills of Hogwarts produced a number of theories, their metaphorical wheels working at a startling pace. It began, as one would think, in the Slytherin common room. After all, prominent students didn’t just up and vanish every day. That really was more of a Gryffindor trait, in their eyes. But that didn't change the fact that Draco Malfoy had vanished from Hogwarts and, after a few days, people were doing more than just wondering why.
However… I might also be taking this fic, once its completed, and reworking it to fit options 1 and 2. (Keep in mind, the plot and ending would not change… it would mostly be specific scenes and various details, and obviously would involve less magic.)
Derrick cleared his throat. “Yeah, I don’t. And neither does Valerie. And four of us married non-magies. But I’ve always thought Ametrine has enough magic for the both of us.”
“I’ve… I’ve got a cousin. He’s six, now. He’s a metamorphmagus. Teddy Tonks. His grandmother was a Black.”
Harry took a deep breath. Easy enough. He just needed to turn in their holiday forms. They both had plenty of time off that was going unused, so much that is was kind of a running joke on the force. He'd filled out a form for each of them, using a spell that duplicated Draco's writing from a test copy. All he needed to do was hand it over to Belinda, and it would all be squared away, and by the time Draco came back, everyone on the squad would be complaining about how long they were away.
Oh, but wouldn’t it be something magnificent if he accomplished it? Such a feat of magic. Such a… romantic gesture. He shook his head and internally scolded himself.
“Oh yes, my mother was very much keeping up with the war— both of them, really. She’s English, as was my father, rest his soul. She had your trial up on the wireless radio, we all celebrated when you were alright.”
-Harry is the same person he is, magical savior, BWL, ya know, but he can't tell the Fab 5 cos they're no-majs
carefully when I got it? Mine practically leapt to attention from the first few words in, and I had an amazing wank session. I was practically seeing stars by the end of it. You’d better make word on every promise you made in that letter, Harry James Potter, or may Merlin help your soul.
“Wonderful! We will see you at seven! Now, what can I get for you? You came here to eat, after all, non?”
Draco woke up on Sunday morning, acutely aware of both the moon and the fact that he would be meeting quite a number of new people that evening. His first shift would be that Wednesday, which made him anxious. He already had his Wolfsbane ready, so now it was just nerves about the transformation.
“Right. So… What’s a core got to do with it?” Jeez, still as harsh as ever, wasn’t she? She reached for her cup of tea and took a sip before looking at him again.
With the moon waning, I’m feeling more and more like myself. Those days of and around the full moon — it felt like someone else was trying to take control. Or maybe some small forgotten part of me that had been shoved away. I didn’t recognize it, if that’s so.
“I look ridiculous,” he repeated. Bas came over and fiddled with Draco’s shirt a bit, undoing a third button and exposing a bit more of his pale chest.
That was completely and utterly unfair. Though you could of course look into a few charms, something similar to a Howler or a Ministry letter? Though I’d prefer not a Howler, as I don’t think the rest of Paris would appreciate anything you’d put in that letter.
You… you do know that Remus was our professor, right? And that he was also a werewolf? And Minerva was totally in favor of him teaching us? She was the one who suggested him to Dumbledore, as she told me yesterday over tea. She says to expect a letter from her, soon, by the way. I’ve learned not to question her. I’m guessing it’s something about the dungeons, or your personal brewing, but I can never be sure.
Harry watched the dark forest form around them and had the briefest thought that this was a bad idea. He had been a scared thirteen-year-old and now he was going to show Narcissa that his favorite professor/pseudo-uncle had nearly killed him? Sure, her cousin/his godfather had saved them, and Snape had also sort of been required to save them…
"He has… almost never seemed shy. Anxious, sure, but I always thought he had a sort of… theatrical personality? I thought he liked being the center of attention."
And so, Harry went around plucking immobilized pixies out of the air and nudging them into the ever expanding cage. Of course, the moment that she opened the wardrobe, more pixies were flooding out. “
on the room. Again, she took his face in her hands and looked into his eyes. After a few moments, she hummed. “Bitten by... a werewolf, my love?”
And if you want to wear your collar out in public, who am I to stop you? But I'd like it just as much if it was kept just between us. Regardless, you deserve something well made and comfortable.
“In other cases, I think you following him would be his goal, Harry,” she added, standing up to get the plum tart from the oven. “It’s just about… knowing what he needs from you.”
, dating is good but--" He cut himself off. "It's clear I'm not going to get that. So I just want him home and safe."
The lycanthropy is not a deal-breaker at all. My own godfather had a close friendship with a werewolf, and they were fine. My godson’s father was that werewolf, too. I am in the process of finding my Animagus form to be with Draco on the full moons. If he ever comes home, that is. It wouldn’t surprise me that he’s doubting himself because of this, as we’ve been sending letters that pretty much confirm it.
With the letter, Draco had also been sent two bars of Honeydukes Reserve 90% Dark Chocolate. Yes, he’d gotten himself chocolate earlier that day, but… But it hadn’t been chocolate from home. The dark purple and bronze foil Honeydukes packaging brought back quite a few happy Hogwarts memories, and the pureness of the cocoa would better aid his magic and soothe the wolf.
“Winnie, m'dear, a pint for the dragon lad!” Doonan cried, before practically dragging Harry to a table, to the amusement of the other pub patrons. For such a thin man, he was quite strong. He fixed Harry with his dark gaze and steepled his long, knobby fingers. “Now, m'lad, what do ye need to know about the dragons?”
“Well, he does say he plans to brew his own. It’ll only be the first time, he uses an over-the-counter potion—“ But he was cut off. Apparently Draco had
"You're an odd thing, aren't you?" Harry asked, continuing to pet the great beast like it was a large cat or a particularly sweet dog. "I mean that in the best way, of course. You're a very good listener. Could talk to you about anything, couldn't I? And who else gets to say they've napped on a dragon and lived to tell the tale? Not bloody many people, that's who." He paused, looking back at the bandaged wing. "...Where did you come from, I wonder?" He hummed a bit, wondering if he should contact a few foreign reserves or dragon ranches. There was no way this dragon didn't grow up around people. He was too… social not to have been.
After a few moments, Harry smiled at her before rising. “Thank you, Headmistress. I… I think I have a few things to think about, right now.”
And so, the Golden Trio once again found themselves at Hogwarts. Neville-- apparently the leader of the student resistance-- welcomed them back with open arms.
Heading down the stairs, Harry looked at Narcissa. “Do you know a Gwendolyn Malfoy?” She put down her book and looked at him.
Who did this woman think she was, telling him this? After only an evening of knowing him? “I harbor no such feelings towards him, and he definitely holds no affections towards me.”
Teddy's seen me transform, now, and at first thought I was a huge, huge puppy. Your mum and Andy had a big laugh over that one. I'm glad he's not frightened of me, I was startled the first time I saw Padfoot. I thought he was a Grim. Plans have been set for Teddy to stay with us at Grimmauld for the moon. (I assume this will be the last moon you and I spend apart.) I've asked him if he'd like to stay at Grimmauld with us, and he's agreed, on the condition that we paint his room 'fun colors'. I haven't asked him to specify yet.
“Oi! Let the boy get a room first, Doonan, before you talk ‘is ear off!” The barwoman said, smacking the man's shoulder with a rag like one would an excited dog. She turned her attention to Harry and raised an eyebrow, appraising him. He unconsciously stood up a little straighter. “Well, I'll eat m'hat if you're a poacher or potioneer, boy, too straight-laced and kind-faced for that.”
“Ridiculous- I will not let my grand-nephew spend his first change in some second-rate hotel room. I won’t allow it. You will stay with me, for the rest of your time in Paris, beginning with tonight.” She took a breath and softened. “Draco, not everyone lives with me now. Only my grand-daughter Valerie and her son. I have plenty of room, and you need to be looked after. Let me do this for you.” He took as best a breath he could, trying to ignore the hiccuping tremor to it as he nodded, his own hands now grasping hers.
And Blaise didn't have to tell me. I saw how you flushed and swooned whenever I did wandless magic, especially when it was more than just summoning a book or something. I'm not quite as unobservant as I seem, my love.
“Yeah? You think so?” His expression was open, vulnerable. He might cry. Narcissa pulled him into a hug and ran her fingers through his curls.
“Oh, my darling, I didn’t expect you to know. Don’t feel bad about it.” She leaned over and gently patted his forearm. “So. I think we need some introductions, hm? Meet your cousins?”
“Oh. I guess that makes sense.” He couldn’t wait for Draco to come home- Home… Huh. He definitely already thought of Grimmauld as their home, especially with Narcissa here. He just hoped that Draco would agree to stay here… that he’d accept his courting gift… which Harry still had no idea what to present to him. He would… that was it. He would ask someone… clever. The person who would give him the
risked what they had when he'd kissed Draco, and when he'd left, neither had brought it up that following Monday. They went about their lives as if that otherwise enjoyable evening hadn't happened.
"Well— erm, when things get busy, it's usually the first thing that slips my mind… I don't mean to forget, you know?"
“Please.” Harry doesn’t beg to anyone but Draco, and he knows this. Harry knows that Draco shirks away from the knowledge, keeps it locked inside his head and never ventures there. He knows what Harry is begging for and the slam of the door is the answer. He sighs and thinks next time, then shuts that part of himself away till Draco drags it back out of him. He walks out of the room, purposefully keeping his eyes ahead of him.
These people, these new and strong and rich, jaded people didn’t deal with money as Draco soon found out, as he would understand with his own tediousness when dealing with it. No, they traded in other things.
It had started so fast, a burning glance or a lingering touch. The desire that evolved so soon between them binds them like twine, wrapping around them until they relish the constriction, the tightness around their hearts that blocks out all the pain and isolation that had overwhelmed them before.
Toward the end of their glorious summer, Draco brings it home, keeping Harry’s questions quiet with his mouth until he could lay his prize on the table.
They portkey back to London, too stoned to apparate, and Draco leaves the apartment for hours on end, leaving Harry there by himself. It goes on for days, weeks, until Draco comes back with more grass and things in vials that Harry won’t bear to ask about. He brings people to the apartment later, people who are quiet and slim, and Harry isn’t sure if he likes it or not, this new turn they’ve taken, these new people in their home.
It’s odd, for both of them are so secretive with everyone else; yet how easily they see through each other’s bullshit.
The summer seems to last forever, and Harry knows it’s partly because of the drugs. Harry loves marijuana so much that his fingers are stained green; he even likes the pills Draco brings home sometimes, tiny tablets that are halved between them on the glass living room table along with the little lines of white that even Harry starts to do more frequently.
He smiles at Hermione and Ron and Jesse, strings pulling taunt, and tries to lighten up … thinks it’s all for the best. He’s always hated feeling content in anything, especially matters concerning his fate.
He wakes up with his whole body cramping, clothes drenched in sweat and stinging the sores on his skin where he clawed. He’s aching and cold on the floor, crawling toward the glass table, anything, anything, Draco, Draco, Draco. Nothing there, no residue, and he cries and pushes the table over, falling over with it. He remembers the warmth of love, curled into himself so close to his own memories, he can imagine the sweet smell of Draco’s breath, warm and laughing and curled toward one another above clean white sheets and smiling and kissing with the sun warm on them.
Remus looks like he’s about to open his mouth and speak for one singular moment but he stops. He rubs one gentle hand over Harry’s head and kisses his forehead over a scar that’s long since faded. Harry watches him turn around, go back the way he came, but he stops, suddenly looking at the wall still stained with Harry’s lipstick. Harry never could get it all off.
“Harry? Harry?” Draco’s voice, godlike and harsh and urgent, is waking him from his exhaustion. He looks toward the fireplace, soot less and empty except for Draco’s floating head and Harry is riddled with confusion for one indescribable moment. “We’ve got a delay here … I’m sorry.” Draco breaks on the last word and Harry reaches for the dry flames to Draco’s turned face.
The first thing out of Draco’s mouth is “Are you still fucking that pathetic squib?” before he squeezes his wrist so hard he’s sure he hears the bones creaking and shifting just to get out the way. Draco guides him to his lap like a lost child, all guileless smiles and sharp eyes. He puts him so his back is against Draco’s chest, cold even though it’s the middle of summer. Harry shivers and places hands palms down on Draco’s thighs, perching between his legs and praying he doesn’t fall because he refuses to put his whole weight down on Draco. For some reason he doesn’t want Draco to know exactly how much he weighs, like it’s vital information. He suspects that Draco has thoughts about throwing him through a window, or at the very least, a wall.
I've passed your sentiments on to your mother, like you asked. (She's been round for tea at Grimmauld twice this week already. I think she'd hoped I had you hidden away in one of my spare bedrooms… I could do, you know. Plenty of room, and it's practically half yours anyway…) If she manages to track you down in France, don't be too surprised. I figure she'd walk the ends of the Earth to find you and make sure you're safe and call you a right idiot for running off. And so would I., Fuck you're such a prat for running away, Malfoy.
Sapphire held up her hands. “Alright, alright. I’ll admit, I don’t know everything, and I have been wrong before. I apologize for overstepping, Draco. I did not mean to upset you.” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes as he only turned back towards his food. He didn’t come here to get interrogated and inspected. He came because… because October hadn’t left him a choice. He was being held hostage by hospitality and niceties. The fiends.
Harry thought about it. “I… don’t know what he needs, though. We’ve been sending letters back and forth, and most of his letters amount to ‘fuck off and leave me alone.’”
“No, no- I don’t want anything to happen, I don’t want anyone to get hurt. It’s safest if I just stay away.”
Two, there was something very wrong with the diadem. Draco detested being near it. It was obviously Dark Magic, though he did not know what kind. Prolonged exposure had him feeling at his worst and lowest point. It felt similar to being in the Manor when the Dark Lord had come to stay. Draco suspected that He had poisoned it-- turned the tiara itself evil, if one could corrupt non-magical objects in such a way…
Draco had no idea where Potter was, no one did. No one paid Draco any attention, as they were all fighting for their lives. There, in the courtyard, he could spy a handful of redheads-- the Weasleys. Though he did not know what compelled him, he quickly moved towards them.
“I’m fine.” Draco said shortly. He wasn’t looking at Harry anymore; his eyes were lowered to the ground and he was shuffling his feet awkwardly, so unlike the confident Draco Harry knew.
“It’s-” Harry sighed and left. There was no hope of winning that battle. There was no stopping Belinda once she had an idea in her head. She was like some… meddling, well-meaning aunt, Harry supposed.
"Of course, I quite enjoyed it, too. And you'll have to come see the watch before I've finished and returned it, it's simply beautiful. Original crystal facing, you know," he added, nudging Draco just a bit.
"I'm sure Uncle October and Aunt Miranda will jump at the chance to show you around. You should come with us in August, though. You can stomp grapes with everyone." Valerie carefully peeled her orange in one long spiral with a short, sharp knife.
With the elf's promise, Narcissa smiled. Lucius cleared his throat and took his wife's hand, her other hand grasping Draco's. The time came for the portkey and Lucius uttered “Thank you, Leesy,” before giving the password. In a gut-twisting pull, the Malfoys were gone from the Chateau, and it was like they'd never even arrived. Tears slipped down the old elf's wrinkled face. Poor, poor Master and Mistress… Poor young master Draco.
tradition, but I think it’s much simpler than anything else.” He hummed, finally looking away from the ring.
[[Enclosed is a sealed box of chocolates, the writing written mostly in French. It’s a variety pack. Included is a picture of Draco laying on a bed in an unfamiliar room, a towel is wrapped around him and his head is hanging off the bed looking at the camera, his hair dripping to the floor. One can assume he’s just come from the shower.]]
Neville lovingly held the leaf before clipping it with a sharp, clean pair of shears. Harry jumped as the Mandrake-- Georgina-- shuddered and let out a short shriek. “No, shh, shh,” Neville immediately hushed. “It’s alright, it’s okay, see? All done.” He held up the leaf for her to see. “That’s it.” She settled, and the plant beside her-- Alfred-- seemed to lean over to comfort her. She seemed to look at the leaf, and then Neville, and nod just a bit.
Draco stared at her before finally raising his brows back at her. “I’m sorry, I don’t think I appreciate what you’re implying.” In love with Potter? In
While I did dip into a bit of my funds, I am not entirely responsible for financing Hermione’s work. Plenty of people during the war were infected, as Greyback got more bloodthirsty and cruel near the end. Quite a few people would benefit from these reforms, including Lavender, Bill Weasley, and my godson Teddy. (Your mum and aunt Andy made contributions from the Black vaults, which I’m sure Sirius would’ve supported wholeheartedly.)
With a bit of strategy, Albus Dumbledore could have two more players on his side in this war-- two more spies with nothing to lose, hell-bent of getting revenge on the man that drove their darling son to suicide. ‘Perhaps,’ Albus thought to himself, ‘The Malfoy boy was worth more dead than alive.’
Neville sighed. “You’re lucky you’re a friend, Harry. Come on.” He followed Neville from the strawberry patch like a little puppy, thanking Neville for helping him, and subsequently inviting him to tea at Grimmauld sometime in thanks. (He was picking up pureblood customs faster than he’d realized.)
to report Draco’s turning and bring him in to be registered. If he was deemed dangerous, they could even brand his registration number into his arm with silver, or even put a tracker on him, like he was a dog.
“My love, you could tell me anything, and it will never leave my lips. I would take an Unbreakable Vow. I do not spill my family’s secrets.”
And as much as Hermione hated to agree… she didn't know if Harry would accept the help unless it was forced on him.
"I'll just get him, you can wait outside if you'd like. You don't have to come in, if you're uncomfortable."
"Me neither. And yet," she gestured to Gwen, who was still holding the sleeping Felix. "Voilà. You can join me, Bas, Val, and Gisele in the singles club. We're thinking of getting jackets made."
“He did, yes. When do you think he found out about His plans to become a Dark Lord? He got information from the Hogwarts library and was recruiting while he was still in school.”
“I’ve a cage set over there, I just need you to round them up, Harry.” There were definitely more pixies in the room than there were when Lockhart let them out of their cage in second year. This was an infestation.
After the two of them were sat down to breakfast, a familiar owl was flying in, with two letters attached. It seemed that Draco had decided to write Harry and Narcissa at the same time, to save everyone time.
“Well, apparently you’re going to be my mother-in-law… so I’m going to try my best. I don’t really have any… any frame of reference so…”
“Oh alright, that’s good.” He had no idea what the fuck a trimester was. Apparently Hermione was out of her first one? He didn’t know. He looked up at Ron and gave him a deprecating smile. “Alright there, mate?”
And the would-be murderer of Fred Weasley fell down dead. He released George's wrist and fled the scene, looking for other foolhardy do-gooders to rescue from his fate. He couldn't bear all the death, couldn't bear the thought of more people becoming like him.
“Yes… Is there any chance I could get you to put it on hold? Just in case.” She raised an eyebrow at him, but opened the case anyway. Without a word, she carefully scooped up the pendant and its chain, carrying it to the counter.
I appreciate your concern. Please tell my mother I am currently in France. Perhaps the Parisians have kinder laws towards those afflicted. I suppose you'll have to find yourself a new partner. Now, for once in your life, please. Leave me alone and fuck off.
“Oh— Of course! I apologize, I’ve overwhelmed you. I will be back, take your time.” There… There were other Malfoys. In France. Alright, then. That was certainly not what he’d been expecting when he went out to lunch… Now he
You plan to have me wear one every day, then? Take me around town and show it off around my neck so everyone knows who I belong to? That’s what you’re looking for? Color me intrigued.
She raised an eyebrow at him and looked back at the shirt. Well it didn't look very delicate. "You should wear it more, it's nice and soft. Maybe your cousins will take you shopping for more like it." She put it back over the back of his chair. "You should wear more casual, comfortable things, my love. Maybe in jewel tones. Although, a nice light blue sweater would look lovely, too."
Molly gave a short little giggle. “No, dear. Bonding jewelry is entirely different. Bonding jewelry, you often put a piece of your own magic into, when you give it to the other person. A courting gift is entirely symbolic.”
"It might not be my place to say this, but you and Tristan are probably much better off without him."
While Harry had heard of Celesti Alley, he hadn’t had much occasion to shop there. It was a bit out of the way, a side street or two off Diagon, and tended to have fancier, more expensive shops. Hermione and Ron had gone to a fancy restaurant there to celebrate their first anniversary, that much Harry remembered. Ah, what had it been called… Sorcery Soiree? Something like that, at least. The shops at least were supposed to have really good quality stuff. Maybe he’d ask around a bit more before popping over there. “Thanks, Molly.”
“Oh.” He said quietly. So… So it was possible. If they’d done anything a little different, he really could have been an Obscurial. He wasn’t entirely sure what to do with that information, only looking to McGonagall. She was Headmistress, she
“I understand, darling, no worries.” For the most part, their soup was had in private, then Narcissa brought out the appetizer and salad together- “So, Harry dear.” He swallowed the (delicious) bite of fried ravioli and turned his attention back to his hostess.
“Just a wrap,” Draco hummed as he looked over the file again. For being such a priss that probably used to love having grand banquets, one of Draco’s favorite lunches seemed to be a chicken wrap.
I think you would have been a great Quidditch player, but ultimately, you’re right. I think you would have gotten bored of it. I saw you, near the end of the academy, though. You’re a brilliant teacher, even to your peers. I think it’ll really do you good.
Harry jumped back and returned his wand to its holster. He put his hand up again, projecting a sense of calm that he did not feel. It seemed like the wand was a no-go.
"Oh, Harry, you are so good. If I were to pass, Draco would be able to live on. He's grown, now. He doesn't need me the same way he used to."
Harry nodded and rolled his shoulders a bit. They'd taken on ten, once, just the pair of them, and it had landed harry in St. Mungo's for a bit. Five between the two of them would be a piece of cake. "You're right about that."
“I know the feeling. I just wanted to remind you about my invitation to come by the store for a tour, if you were still interested? No rush, and Mum has the address, so you can ask her.”
“I suppose so… but don’t be afraid to give yourself time to heal and rest. It takes a lot out of you.” She cupped his face and brushed a bit of hair out of his eyes. “So hard on yourself, Draco… give yourself a break, hm?”
The Manor. His parents. His task… surely He would've known of Draco's death by now. Would the Dark Lord blame Draco for dying without killing Dumbledore? Would his parents suffer since Draco couldn't? Even after death, there was so much uncertainty in Draco's mind.
“Albus--!” She hissed, approaching him as he turned to the Malfoy boy’s body. So young… burdened with a task he was destined to fail… “What are we to do?” She asked again, certain that the Headmaster had changed his plans. And so he had.
“Well I can't right well assassinate Dumbledore if I'm a gh- If I'm dead, can I, Myrtle?” It was hard for him to talk about his spectral state, as it felt somewhat similar to being alive… just less warm, more detached.
taken a potion that wasn’t crafted especially for him, since the moment of his birth, every potion and medicine had been tailored to his needs. No wonder Snape seemed to like Draco so much. He must have known him since we was incredibly small. If Draco had never once had an over-the-counter potion, did that mean he took potions as a baby, too? Did the Wizarding World have anything similar to vaccines? He guessed not, as no Healer had ever brought them up, not even Pomfrey.
The moon went better than it has before. Most likely because I know I’ll be back home soon. My time away has been nice, and Paris has been a breath of fresh air, but I feel as though I’ve got a clean head, and I’m ready to come back.
"That explains it," Ron sighed. "Robards has been asking me about where you two went. Off the record. He hiding out at home, waiting for it to blow over?"
The Crowlins didn't have a huge manor house like the Malfoys did, though it did seem like a large country house. There were no Muggles for miles, another thing to be glad of. Draco made sure no one but he and Harry could Apparate from the grounds, to prevent any escapes, and Harry got a sense of the surrounding area.
The halls were practically deserted, most of the time. The students abandoned the castle each May and returned on September 1st, leaving Hogwarts with precious few residents over the summer. That year, the students and staff seemed to vanish all at once, what with the death of the Headmaster and the infiltration of Death Eaters so close to the end of term. Were he in his usual mind, Draco wouldn't have blamed them at all… however, being freshly murdered and undead weighed heavily upon his psyche.
"...he'd never be like that, you know. And he's got us to support him, remind him… we'll never let it go that far."
"Because he seems to be as reluctant as she is. That, or my poor nephew has terrible luck in finding good men. Or good men without commitment issues."
"Bit of a debrief-slash-planning session with Ron, nothing to worry about. I won't go out there early and on my own." Though he's done it before. Really, Draco is the more responsible one of the pair. "Might get a bite after. Can I bring you back something?"
She finally pulled away, brushing his hair back one more time. “A few of the elves will stay and tend to it.”
Maybe he could even find a place to eat, perhaps somewhere with a nice steak tartare. It was a rumor that werewolves tended to prefer raw or bloody meat, and Draco found it to have a bit of truth. He felt like he could eat three of his usual chicken wraps. Hm, maybe it led to an increase in metabolism, causing him to need to eat more to keep up? That may require further testing…
“Sapphire,” Draco called without turning his head, still envisioning so many different images in his head, all featuring Harry and the gorgeous necklace.
She nodded along. “You think you’ll be able to do it?” Harry nodded, cradling his teacup in both hands.
You shouldn’t have to go through it, either. And I know my mother is firm, but I still want to protect her. She certainly doesn’t deserve any of this.
“I can’t imagine how painful that must’ve been, being branded like that,” she said, beginning the sketch. “You don’t have to worry, this one won’t hurt nearly as much.” She’d had been right; he hadn’t teared up, even during the shading.
“That, or there are more nefarious purposes behind his disappearance. As I said, we were hoping you may be able to determine the intent.” Harry shook his head, hands curling into fists at his sides.
“It runs in the family. That was the first time I’d ever transformed.” Draco said, clearly still uncomfortable talking to Harry about it.
He climbed over a pile of half-broken Edwardian furniture, beginning his climb to claim the horcrux. And Draco Malfoy kept the diadem shining for him, wearing it atop his ghostly head like the silver prince he was, though his visage was hidden inside the mannequin head.
“Oh. Well… Well, if you insist,” he finally agreed. Window shopping might be fun… especially if both he and the clerk knew that he wasn't engaged or on his way to being bonded. “Do you specialize in any particular gems or metals?”
“Um… Madam Malkin’s, actually. He was getting measured for Hogwarts robes and he just… started the conversation. Didn’t ask who I was or anything.” He smiled at the memory. Gods, they’d both been so tiny back then…
Draco slowly walked over to sit, giving her a nod. “Ma’am.” She tipped her head back and laughed, though he didn’t feel like she was laughing
"Well, he's nice. He would've been just as attentive and helpful as I was, would've helped with your wing and everything…" He sighed a little and rubbed the back of his neck. "He puts you guys first, you know? Dragons, I mean. You lot are the loves of his life. Might've broken his heart that you didn't like him." Another huff from the dragon almost sounded like '
Really, Harry, don’t worry so much. Yes, it is quiet, but… I think I needed time to myself. Time without you, or mother, or Blaise or Pansy, or anyone else. Time to reflect.
The spells holding Harry had begun to lose strength, but none of the Death Eaters noticed him as they walked back down the stairs. Harry was still frozen and silent for a good few minutes before the magic broke. He practically saw red as he fled the scene, running after Snape and his gang of murderers.
He knew four things for certain. One, he was dead, and Harry Potter had killed him. He was a ghost. Two, someone had cleared away his things. Three, Albus Dumbledore was also dead. He'd heard that from the portraits. Four, dark things were coming to Hogwarts.
Surprisingly, it didn’t take them long to get there. Though Draco still didn’t think he liked it that much. Off the train and up the stairs they went, emerging into the early spring sunlight. Only a few streets away, they approached a building painted in royal blues and blacks, with a neon sign reading 'Tatouages et piercings' in the window. Ah, so his cousin worked at a tattoo studio. Interesting. Draco’s nose wrinkled. “I see.” Very interesting. At least now they were going to be going back to the wizarding shopping districts.
Derrick shook his head. “Not a bit. Well, not anything I can use to conjure something. I’ve got a great immune system, hardly ever get sick. And the weather, I’m comfortable in all sorts of weather.”
The letter came in the afternoon of the day after full moon, and Harry was, honestly, a bit terrified to read it. But he had to. Draco couldn’t go through this alone.
Any excuse to flee the Manor was a good one. Since his catastrophic failure in the Department of Mysteries-- failure to acquire and deliver the prophecy to the Dark Lord-- life had not been kind to Lucius Malfoy, nor to his wife and child.
Tears began to come to his eyes unbidden. “I- I didn’t come here on holiday. I ran from home. On our latest Auror raid, it all went wrong, and… And I was bitten.”
“I’m willing, I just… don’t want you to think badly of Remus, or of Draco, because of it. Draco will never forget his wolfsbane, so his shifts would never be like this…” He spoke as she led him into the room that had the Pensieve in it.
Harry awoke some hours later, feeling warm and rested,and still very much on a dragon, which was also blinking awake—looks like he'd had a nap, too.
" He didn't understand it. How could she have even known they existed? Draco hadn't learned of them until earlier that same day!
Harry’s eyes widened. “Oh. That’s… That’s a lot.” A core and a half. How much magic did normal cores normally have in them? Hm. That might be a Draco kind of question… He wondered how much magic Draco had. He was typically sensitive to magic, did he know about Harry’s core, too? This was… not really something to ask over pen and paper. That was a face to face conversation.
[[A series of pictures is also enclosed. Draco is on his knees, his head laid down on the bed, his rear facing the camera. The first picture simply has him posing in that position, breathing, his eyes occasionally fluttering shut. The next picture is Draco beginning to circle his fingers around his rim, pushing them in. The pictures continuously get faster and more intense until Draco’s got his wand in one hand, waving it and causing a dildo to start pumping in and out of his arse. His face and chest are red, and his mouth is wide open as it looks as though drool is slowly dripping. There is no picture of him finishing.]]
Harry was surprised and stiff for all of a moment before he pretty much melted into the hug. His eyes closed and he just enjoyed her embrace for a little while. "...I'd be doing this even if I wasn't looking to court him, you know."
When Malfoy didn't show up to classes that day, Harry was certain the blond git was holed up in the hospital wing, moaning about being bruised from Harry's hexes. All in all, Harry was glad not to see him.
Harry Potter did not return to Hogwarts that September. Nor did Ron Weasley or Hermione Granger. Instead, they spent the year on the run from Death Eater and snatchers, all the while hunting for horcruxes. The diary, the ring, and now the locket had been destroyed. The Golden Trio had been captured by snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor.
The waiter seemed to pause, raising an eyebrow and looking him up and down. He seemed to realize himself and blinked rapidly a few times. "Ah, good day. My apologies, you just look
It was awful. I don’t want to have to go through it again, I think I’d rather that wolf had just killed me on the spot. They call it a curse for a reason.
“Oh, don’t worry, I can help teach you. It’s not so difficult, no worries.” She wove her arm through his and led him into the breakfast nook, where Harry had subconsciously laid out Narcissa’s favorite tea and sweets, chocolate-dipped orange madeleines. Narcissa smiled at him. “Harry, darling, you spoil this old woman.”
against her desk as she drummed her fingers. "Ooh! Somewhere fun and exotic, I hope, duck. Get that pasty boy out of his robes and onto a beach!"
She immediately put it back down. "Right, right, good to know," she nodded and hummed a bit, eyes flitting over the rest of the display. "White gold then, perhaps?"
," he shook his head and gestured with his hands at the same time. "It is a list of everyone in this school, including the staff, and it writes them off as either Nice or Naughty in time for Christmas and Yule and the wintery-good-feelings season. I suspect Dumbledore's doing, the old dead coot," he drawled the last part and I half-smiled for a brief second. His death was still fresh.
Ha ha. Ha...ha. Erm, well, it doesn't entirely mean that the whole entire rumour about us wasn't true. In part. A bit. I mean, one doesn't exactly go from being on the
Lumos charm went above his head. "I like the way you think," he purred in a sly tone. Sounded just like his usual self, too. Actually made me more comfortable. "Any boundaries we need to set, then?"
"It's a boy and a girl, twins." Harry smiles back, softer, shyer. "...And they'll be just as beautiful as their Father was."
." Voldemort looked on with glee as Harry was finally stumped. He even gave Harry a few moments to try and block them, but his
"What makes you think that you aren't special?" I countered quietly. I could almost see the whoosh of air that came out of his shocked-'o' mouth.
"You can't even say the word, Ron, and besides I think you are too busy with Hermione to actually notice I'm around. And do I even act like a gay person?"
I blushed. "Stuff it, Finnegan," I mumbled, rubbing the back of my neck. There wasn't any reason for me to deny it since it was pretty obvious and would be more obvious once it was revealed what List-side I was on. And my, what a shock that would be. It was hard keeping the devilish smirk to myself, not to mention stopping myself from snickering.
He shuddered violently at that, brushing against something that filled me with pleasuring warmth. "Merlin's beard!" he exclaimed. "I definitely won't last if you keep saying things like that."
"Harry is too complex to describe in mere fifteen sentences; why, some people even believe he's the center of the universe-not I, though.
"Yeah, how do you figure that we're going to be able to get your name in its 'rightful place'?" I studied his perplexed face for a moment before I continued. "You didn't think I'd just go and leave on my merry way after I saw this, did you? I'm just as much involved as you are now."
The crowd was giving only a quiet murmur; no doubt wondering who was going to be delivering the ceremonial testimony appropriate to all wizard or witch deaths. As per tradition, it was supposed to be given by a close confident or family member, be it kin or in-law. They were expecting Hermione, with her still ever-sharp mind and clever words, or maybe even Ron, the quintessential best friend, to preform such a ceremony. "They" being the majority of the gathering: his fellow Gryffindors. Here and there had some Slytherins, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, though, of course, and even more scattered were people that went to a different school other than Hogwarts and people that Harry deemed worthy of having a presence at his real funeral.  Because, really, after everything, this was Harry Potter.  The Boy Who Lived, The Man Who Defeated Voldemort...silly things like House rivalries mean nothing to him.  Or rather,
In a world without Voldemort, a world with just a normal half blood Tom Riddle, what might his life been life? Naturally, his father would’ve gone to every Quidditch game, with Sirius right beside him. His mum… He had all these different accounts about his dad, and Sirius, and Remus, but there was still so little he knew about his mum, just the fucked-up visions he’d gotten from Snape. He knew that she was wicked smart, very loyal, and didn’t put up with nonsense, but that was about it.
“Anything you’d like in particular?” He shrugged on the jacket and ran a hand through his hair— he’d been using Sleekeazy's more often in the morning, so hair hair was more curls than just a mess. “Somewhere on Diagon?”
Draco frowned, looking down at himself. "I am comfortable." Dressed in black tailored slacks and a light blue button-down shirt that Blaise had recommended, he was dressed much more casually than he normally was. He owned exactly zero tee shirts… except the one that Harry had sent. He didn't see that there was anything wrong with the way he was dressed. He preferred his higher quality materials to those you could get at any shop. Maybe he could find a way out of it.
When you come back, we'll talk with Robards, the two of us. I'm certain they'll still want you, we have the best case stats in the department, after all. Or you could become an Unspeakable? And still work closely with me? Fuck, we'll figure it out. Just come back to England.
"So that's why they want us." Harry was well known for, well, often leaping before he looked. If you were in a rush… you called Potter.
“Oh, no, I’m not at all sure he’d say yes. I’m just… hoping that it goes that far. He doesn’t like to talk about his feelings much. And, heh, you know me, Molly.” He at least had the sense to look sheepish.
“It sounds like Gabriel and Devin in school, doesn’t it? My son used to write almost every week, complaining about this boy in school, for about the first three years… We were quite surprised when Devin started coming by and asking where Gabriel was, once he’d left for Beauxbatons. I think he was heartbroken, really.”
Narcissa nodded. “Alright, then.” That was it? ‘Alright, then?’ He hummed a bit, thinking that she was definitely holding back her thoughts on the matter. The grandfather clock down the hall charmed 11:30, and Harry sat up.
Just imagining it in my mind, I cringe at what that bedroom may look like. Be a lamb, and try to convince him to settle on two colors? I'm thinking purple for the walls, something like a wisteria, gentle and muted, and he can have his Tiffany for the trimmings. Yes, I do know it, however I prefer a soft blue topaz. It brings out my eyes. You'd best warn him, Pansy and Blaise both have attested to the fact I'm a cuddler. I won't let go of him so easily once he's in my grasp.
Queer Eye because the youngest two Weasley’s absolutely shameless pleasure. Multiple episodes had had the pair of them in tears on the Burrow’s couch. Every man (and the lovely lady Miss Tammye) had deserved all the Fab Five had given them and more— confidence, healing, organization, and the tools to take care of themselves.
"Yes, Draco? Found something else you like?" She came closer and hummed when he pointed at the necklace. "Oh! I crafted that one. I envisioned it as a little drop of blood, or a pomegranate seed. Do you like it?"
I'll admit, you calling me Master threw me at first. But that's just what you need, isn't it, love? Like I've said before, you just need a firm hand and love. You're a bit of a brat, but that isn't your fault: you've just not had anyone to set you straight, make sure you're behaving.
“You’ve hardly even touched your plate, stay, eat. Today is a day to celebrate.” He didn't feel much like celebrating, now that both his abysmal love life and his new scars had been brought up. And he'd never much enjoyed dinner parties, though this one was very different from all the others he'd been to. “New family is always a reason to celebrate.”
“Yes, ma'am, thank you,” Harry replied, fishing two galleons out of his pocket in exchange for the key. The wild man by Harry's side seemed beside himself with excitement, eagerly waiting his turn to speak with the newcomer.
"He what?" Narcissa seemed to stare at him another minute before ushering him inside. "Come in, darling, please. What happened to him?"
“We have to explicitly say that they'd be making over a fellow wizard, and therefore the episode wouldn't be going on muggle television.”
Got an idea for a scene with the Fab 5? Drop me a comment or hit me up on tumblr! (Find me at TracerIsAKingsman)
“Well it won’t be completely stiff and proper, cos it’s me doing it, isn’t it?” His laugh was nervous and a bit reedy. “I want him to know I’m serious, and it isn’t just because he’s been turned.”
“No. Dramatic bastard that he is, he’s fled the bloody country,” Harry raged, hands curling into fists. “He’s terrified we’re going to track him down and force him to register and everything he’s worked for will be for nothing.”
Draco hummed, setting his glass down and licking his lips with small dabs of his tongue, like a kitten. "They can still hope, unfortunately."
Slowly, everyone else left, leaving just Draco and Gwen alone in the house with one another. A few flicks of her wand had the plates stacking themselves and floating towards the sink, which had filled itself with hot water and suds. That taken care of, she turned her attention to Draco. “You had quite a bit of wine tonight, young man. How are you feeling?” He’d practically had two gorgeous bottles of white wine to himself, much to October’s delight.
“Alright. Tipsy, but not overly so.” Which was strange, that he didn’t feel drunk. In most situations, it only took him a few glasses to reach ‘drunk’ but it felt like he’d only just begun to reach that state.
“Dragons?! Well I'll tell ye boy, we've seen ‘em—!” A grizzled man suddenly seemed to appear next to Harry, dark eyes wide and sparkling with excitement. He seemed to be missing a tooth or two, and his clothes seemed to reflect a forest camouflage. Harry suspected he didn't bathe often.
He turned his great body to face Harry, and the man was shocked. The emotions on the dragon’s scaly face and in his mercurial eyes was unmistakable. He was hurt and he was betrayed. It was obvious (no matter how crazy and far fetched the idea was) that the dragon believed Harry had only healed his wing and gained his trust to cause him harm, perhaps take him away to a reservation or ranch— or even perhaps turn him into expensive pearly dragonhide boots and gloves. He raised a huge sharp claw and began to scratch and pull at the collar.
Unfortunately, Harry was starting to run out of things to talk about. This was the longest it had ever taken to get an animal to trust him; normally he only needed about 20 minutes worth of material.
Everything is the same except moved up 10 years from canon. The Marauders were born in 1970, and Harry was born in 1990, which puts him at 28 years old, as this fic takes place in May of 2019.
Harry pulled out his field notebook and pencil, ready to document whatever information Doonan could give him. “A friend of mine was out near Salisbury yesterday about a dragon—he's a dragon expert, world-renowned—and it attacked him on sight. I need to know if you've seen it, if it passed this way at any time in the past week.”
Draco smiled at everyone as they all seemed to begin to have their own conversations- “So, Draco!” Oh dear. He’d spoken too soon. October had, once again, turned his sights on Draco. “Tell us some of your Auror tales, I’m sure you have a number of fantastic adventures with Mr. Potter.”
Wait, what? Picking up the tome properly, Harry stared at it. There was… He saw notes sticking out of the books. He… He hadn’t noticed that, before. Looking through the book, his eyes widened when he saw all sorts of notes. Notes from Sirius, and Pettigrew, and… And his dad.
“Right, I guess he was…” He took another deep breath and met her steady gaze. “Any pictures of you in Hogwarts robes, then?” And they turned the page.
If you happen to improve the taste or the effectiveness of the potion, you’d be helping so many people, not just yourself, love. I’ll keep a careful eye on you during the moons to see if anything changes, if you act any different because of the potion. Brilliant ideas, you have, seriously brilliant. We’ll keep a notebook, treat them like proper clinical trials.
That all really does sound lovely, though, and helps to calm my temper down… You’d like if I pulled on your hair, wouldn’t you? Used it to guide you around the room, or up and down the bed. Up and down my cock? Of course, if it pleased you, I’d like the reverse, as well… Would you like that? Having me at your beck and call, then? But you know I’d fight you at every turn… Maybe you’d need to put a little collar and leash on me to prove who I really belonged to?
It’s nice to know that you did it. Believe it or not, that does make me feel better. Like… When I go back, I won’t be alone, even on the moons. I do appreciate the pictures, as well, don’t worry. Especially that second picture. I’ll put it to good use, no worries about that.
“Isn’t it too early for guests?” Charlie responded from where he lay on the bed. Harry winced at the bandages still covering much of Charlie’s body. Even spending a night with the most skilled healers in the UK hadn’t entirely healed him? This dragon attack must have been much worse than usual.
For now, I’ve bought myself an over-the-counter bottle, but soon I will be brewing my own, a practice which in Britain is frowned upon. Yet another reason to stay away.
"Well! I didn't know you owned any casual clothes!" She held it up for him to see. "It's a good color on you. Shall I wash this, too?
“See, a long long time ago, before you or I or even ol’ Winnie were around, this place was special. Lots of magic in the Earth and the trees and the like. Legend has it that a small band of infected wizards migrated from Greece into France, and then from France to right here, during the dark ages. See here boy—it's said they were cursed by the Gods, to become an Ýdra, a sort of dragon, when they reached a certain age—cursed to roam the lands as a terrifying beast. But with their magic, they would learn to control it; they could shift from beast to man at will, if they wished.” Doonan paused, impressively finishing off the rest of his drink.
In all honesty, I didn't think much of becoming a professional Quidditch player… I suppose I thought teams would only want me for the Boy Wonder aspect and not the fact that I was good on a broom… also, now that I think of it, a lot of people pushed me to become an auror… likely for the same reason. (Puts a lot of faith in the Ministry if Harry Potter is chasing bad guys, doesn't it?) Really, it would've been fun for a couple years, and I really do enjoy it, but I think teaching would be a much better fit. Besides, you and I can have seekers' games and teach Teddy to fly. It'll be fine.
You shouldn’t have to go through it, either. And I know my mother is firm, but I still want to protect her. She certainly doesn’t deserve any of this.
"Oh, Harry Potter, you can't fool me, there's more attraction between you and Draco than gold and Nifflers!" She laughed and waved him off. "Enjoy your vacation, love, Merlin knows you to deserve it. Now, shoo!"
"I want him to give me a chance," Harry admitted, after a bit of a pause. "I'd like him to see that I could be just as good of a life partner as I am a work partner-- maybe not life partner
"Only five courses tonight, Harry, I hope that's alright." God, he'd be stuffed by the time he left.
[[Included are two pictures. The first has Harry on his back, legs spread and hips propped up on a pillow, spread out on their bed as he works a nicely sized dildo into himself. He’s flushed all over and isn’t wearing his glasses.
Narcissa put a hand to her head, looking as though she were faint. “My dear, darling Draco. Reduced to
Harry waited until they were seated in the parlour to explain. “The raid, it was to break up the Crowling family. They’re one of those ‘Revive Voldemort’ cults.” Narcissa winced, as Harry suspected she would. It was more than a sore subject. “It was the full moon and, well… We didn’t know one of them was an unregistered werewolf. If I’d known, we wouldn't’ have gone last night, we would’ve waited for the new moon—”
"Hang on, snot, just another minute." She stuck her tongue out at him and grinned, crossing her arms over her chest. Finally, he set down the instrument and Draco realized it had been a needle. "Alright, lemme clean up and we'll get going.” Draco watched as Sebastien quickly cleaned up his station and gently cleaned the large man’s new tattoo with a foaming wash, before wrapping it in clear plastic wrap. He finally turned to them with a grin. "So? Let's go shopping."
“Wait, no, don’t do that— you might hurt yourself”— But the dragon silenced him with a blast of hot air from his snout and a growl that originated in his belly, as if to say
He approached the cot, which was out of immediate sight from the doorway. A simple flourish of his wand removed the cloth that covered Draco's body.
"A review course on core magic seems to be the best course of action for this hour. We can keep that third leaf out of the equation at least until you get home."
He couldn’t help but to laugh at that, trying to keep the bitterness he felt from the sound. “This is a break.” She went up on her toes and kissed his forehead.
required to track him down and register him yourself. Thankfully, you and the law seem to have a very funny relationship."
Harry knocked loudly, and the door opened after a long few moments of him simply waiting there. Pansy, it seemed, had thrown on a lacy satin black robe over herself, maybe hoping to snatch a new toy. “Oh. Potter. What are you doing here?”
"So I don't end up being the Boy Who Lived Thrice," he said, with a wink. He finished his coffee and closed the file. "Right. Six pm, Auror Malfoy." He always liked to tease Draco, calling him that.
Have I ever made you a promise that I haven't kept? Of course I'll make good on everything I've said, in our bed or out of it. (Also I quite liked it when you used my full name.)
Draco quickly shook his head as Valerie handed the letter off. “I haven’t got anything of the sort.”
"I do," she told him, her voice whispersoft. He beamed at her in response, and it seemed to completely light up his face.
“Me?” Harry’s eyes widened as he took a moment to process what she was saying. “But… Why me? How?” He knew that he didn’t have the best childhood, but he didn’t think that he’d ever have been an
He took a few shuddering breaths and wiped his eyes. “I think— it must’ve taken a lot out of him, for him to write this afterwards…” He closed his eyes and offered the letter to her. Narcissa took it and soon had the very same reaction as Harry, slowly sitting herself down.
“That much I already know to be fact.” He smiled, allowing his hand to cover her left. “You would adore my mother.”
“As time passed, the curse began to fade. Not every child was a son, and not every son was cursed. They say the Ýdr’yiós have died out, too much inbreeding and blood dilution, but I say different. I think they've just gotten good at taking other forms!”
"Harry has done things no other Wizard, save Merlin and the Founders perhaps, has ever achieved- and some no Wizard may want to achieve.." A lot of Gryffindors and Slytherins caught this one. "and in such a small amount of time of only nearly eight years; if you are counting how long it took him to achieve these things and not his age when the last major action he did was at the ripeness of 18 years.
"Oh, Merlin, Harry! You're really gone. I miss you, I miss you so much. I can't live without you!" He sobbed, uncaring of how he must look. Hermione made her way over to him and made comforting motions on his back. Ronald also came over, looking very somber.
But he came down on me in a fury that he had to write this; so I conceded, knowing that he would get the job done as it was only the two of us that could really do honor for Harry tomorrow. That was a week ago, and he was still revising and editing and making additions to his words. I was fearful that he might not finish it in time...at least until I hear his quill drop.
. Perhaps you like me too." All of his Death Eaters started to laugh at the joke; the battle had all but stopped at Draco's screaming, both sides at a stalemate with the impending sense of a tipping point just about to crest. a
"If you still believe that Harry does not have these traits, well, there's not much else I can do to cure your stupidity; but since you are so dumb let me use up another sentence to prove it to you:
"Draco.." He whispered. "If you can't handle this, we'll have to escort you..." The threat was enough; Draco fixed his posture and stopped his caterwauling. But the tears still flowed.
Harry twirled his wand in his hands, looking at it as he spoke. "Whatever you want: Truth or Dare, simply asking random questions we've always wanted to know the answers to; I'm up for anything."
"Maybe not so in his earlier years, but with all that the Wizarding World put on his shoulders- which I'm sure he was grateful for his mixed heritage for the reason of getting away from it all by living with muggles; even I don't want to be a pure-blood all the time- he had to grow traits to use to stand up to their expectations and further fall into Dumbledore's manipulations." He treaded carefully with this one, as Dumbledore was still a beloved figure many years after his death, and also because of his own admittance that earned him glares from other pureblooded Slytherins. He glared at them back until they were ashamed. Being old and powerful brought you great amounts of respect.
I ripped off my tie, quickly followed by my shirt and my pants. But I hesitated in taking off my boxers. Biting my lips, I glanced at him. Bad idea. He was naked.
many signs. If only I had listened...wait a minute, this isn't my fault. It's yours!" He spun around to point directly at Potter.
" I must have screamed since he had to cover my mouth with his hand and hissed at me. "Do that again!"
More seriously, I continued. "If you don't mind," I said very quiet. "I'd really like it if you would stay with me. Just for a little bit."
At least I was able to guess at it, since the words did separate a bit the second time around. "You mean, you're on the
"Draco, by standing up and basically telling everyone that you're Harry's lover, it does sound like you are g..." Pansy said soothingly before Draco actually stood up and interrupted her.
He licked his lips and leaned in closer while furiously whispering at an even quieter volume. Like that helped, the prat. "You know, the-nicelist,"
Education never really was that important to me; well, it was important, just, even in the magical world, it was
"Um," he was redder than I had ever seen him, which was saying a lot after tonight, and his voice was tight with embarrassment. He tapped the tips of his fingers together. "From what I hear, it's the same as regular...foreplay and all...just someone tops and someone bottoms, like the girl, you know?"
"Alright," Seamus said. "We all know that Harry has been upstairs hiding away, but we don't know why." Everyone nodded at this, even Ron. "So the plan is this, and I worked all night on it: we march up the stairs and barge into the room demanding what is wrong. Be prepared to use force against him, mainly tickling with this feather." He held up a pink feather for everyone to see.
"I know that too, but it's hilarious Dray." Draco gave in at his real pet name and read it. It was only a little blurb, after all. This once couldn't hurt too badly.
"Aha! You admit to it!" At Harry's perplexed look, he continued. "You said 'people' not 'other women', and you obviously don't care about women at all to have 23 of them and cheat on them with 3
He looked down and kicked at the floor. "Um, I kinda have to get rid of the last scrap of my purity, so...that means...Isortofneedtolosemyvirginity."
"Draco, don't be like that. I know that you have a major headache, and I can see your hands twitch ever so often." Draco turned around to face him.
A tempus charm from my wand revealed that it was exactly 12:00. "Hey, Draco," I mumble, tired now beyond belief. "Merry Christmas,"
"Well, I'm-I was," he stammered and I raised an eyebrow. He was either being so unlike himself or showing me a whole new, realer side to him. Either way, I was impressed by the blush that painted his face. You should have seen how quickly and fully it spread.
We both scanned the glowing document before us, but I saw his name still firmly attached to the Nice List first. In fact, it looked a little more attached now. He kinda slumped in defeat. I nudged him gently. "So, Plan B, then?" I asked.
"And I know something else that doesn't tickle," Draco said, confusing Harry before he saw the black velvet box. He gasped then, almost missing his next words. "Will you marry me?"
It was a pure lucky accident that I happened to catch Malfoy. The poor sod had probably went through so many spells and near heart-attacks just to get to the room where the rough draft of the list was kept. And I didn't help one bit. 'Course, that makes it just a little bit funny. For me. He certainly didn't think so.
"I take offense to that." Potter said somewhat nonchalantly as he studied his nails, sitting on the bed. Draco continued on.
"What has got you so happy?" his wife asked him, immediately suspicious of his happiness. He squashed down the ridiculous grin he must have been sporting. Despite Astoria's rather pleasant and cheerful manner, she was still a Slytherin at heart and had known him too long to not be wary of anything positive in his grim and weary stature outside of his wonderful son. Most times, nothing good ever came out of such moods and she full well knew it. They couldn't afford such things to damage their still precarious reputations.
"Meow." Harry replied, doing his best impression of a cat's purr. Then he leaned over and licked Draco's face.
"I had to," I said, inching closer to him. It felt like a distance had suddenly grown between us and I couldn't bear to let that be true.
"Clearly," he drawled, eyes glued to me. He pushed me to the ground and pressed his lips to my neck.
"What? I-I don't understand-" I stumbled. His playful teasing was so sudden and his coy suggestions completely eluded me.
Draco sighed and rubbed his temples. "Snook-ums, you know Daddy doesn't like being called that name." Harry smiled as he sat by him.
stretching and opening me up. "To think-" he grunted and I shivered as he entered me rather painlessly. "That I could last even
, like spotlights compared to the others, and firmly set like no other was. I almost wondered if someone had simply stamped it on there. It seemed likely since everyone else was moving at least just a little bit. Actually, the closest one in immobility might have been Draco's right at the very bottom. I actually found it a little disorienting. I mean, this was supposed to be Death Eater-scum type of person and here he was defying everything to be apparently one of the nicest people around; a close second to me.
"Here you are." He handed them over with an equally cheerful voice. Draco just glared at him as he downed them in a single swig.
"Geez, Malfoy," I said, pretending to be hurt and placing a hand over my heart. "Anyone would think you don't like me."
Draco glared. "This calls for war," he growled, reaching for the other pillow so he wasn't defenseless. And thus, they started a pillow fight in which Harry would have won had not Madame Pomfrey came in and saw the mess they made with all the feathers and promptly kicked them out.
He took one of my hands in two of his so harshly I sat up in the momentum. He jerked me even closer and pressed my hand flat over his heart. "Can you hear my heart beat in your fingertips?" he asked me. My own quickened as I looked at him.
Before Draco knew what he was doing, he sighed and answered. "I'm hoping to propose to him before the end of the year. But that might not work seeing as he's holding himself up in his room. I have it all planned out...sort of. And I suppose it's all thanks to Dumbledore, he was the one who made us start our friendship in the summer." Then he noticed whom he was talking to. "Finnegan, you better get lost and not tell a word of what I said or it will be your head!" He threatened before ditching the Gryffindor.
A mischievous gleam came into my eyes, I could feel it. "You mean, like this?" I squirmed underneath him and let out a low moan. He stiffened for a second and then growled, slamming into me so hard that I saw stars.
"Many of you will say--former Gryffindors--that Harry's bravery shone out most of all, but this is not true; yes, Harry may have needed this in order to save us all from Lord Voldemort, but it is not his best trait as it makes him prone to rash decisions." He earned a lot of glares for this and gulped.
"Sorry." Harry said with his lopsided grin. "But, do you wanna go for a fly?" He asked, holding up two brooms. Draco smiled in reply.
"Don't be a git," I mumbled. "You know what I meant," I couldn't help the way my cheeks flamed. We were two teenaged boys talking about sex after all. Two teenaged, horny, virgin boys.
"The plan?" he spluttered. I guess he wasn't counting on having a partner-in-crime. Least of all me.
He blushed and ducked his head after awhile, mumbling something and blushing harder. I smiled a little, 'cause it was kinda cute to watch him like this, you've gotta admit. Then I took a deep breath because I'm the Gryffindor here, so I'm the one that has to take the next step. Bridge the gap, so to speak.
"There is another reason that without Harry's love I would not be here..." He choked for a moment, trying to hold in his tears. His fingers clenched tight onto the podium and Draco hunched his shoulders as the wave of pain came back. He took a few seconds to compose himself and manually wiped his tears, stoically. He coughed and massaged his throat before deciding he was ready to continue.
I half-laughed as I stretched, waiting for a slight pop of my joints to declare me alright. "Rain-check on that for right now, but if things don't work out between me and Ginny, I know who to call," I paused and turned towards him. My fingers reached out to pet his. His cat eyes were watching me closely. Like he was questioning my motives and evaluating the right response. Ever the Slytherin. It made me smile.
I didn't need to be some sort of mind reader--not that I am a good one or was reading his mind in that moment--I knew exactly what he was thinking because I was thinking it too. No time to play games. The countdown was ticking. This had to be dirty, rough and quick. Maybe next time we could-
"No, you didn't," he said, laughing in self-mockery. "You could have left me. You had no reason not to, after all the things I've done," he shook his head, refusing to look at me when I reached for his hand.
"Yeah," he croaked awkwardly, twiddling with his fingers. We stood like that, avoiding each others' eyes, in silence.
"The Sorting Hat was half right when it wanted to put Harry in either Slytherin or Gryffindor..." Many gasped at that fact and he grinned evily as he continued on. "- yes, he told me, did you expect him to keep that kind of thing a secret from me?!- Harry held too many traits of each House in him to be in just one or two or even three; Harry was built for all four." They accepted this fact more readily than the previous one.
"Never!" Voldemort growled as he sent red sparks up into the air. Suddenly the atmosphere chilled and the air froze up. Harry laughed, sending out ghostly puffs.
I look up at him, hiding my wince at his now steely gaze. My forehead burns where his sweet lips had dared to touch only moments ago in comparison to him now. "I'm not-" I paused to take a breath and spill it out. "I'm not
"Good, Lord Malfoy." Harry grinned, seeing how Draco suppressed a shiver as he gave his former rival his actual title. "Now, then, I do sincerely offer my apologies towards my previous uncouth behavior and mannerisms to your and your posse. And I'm willing to forgive your un-niceties, as well."
I think this is the first time I had ever seen him smile since then, even just a little. And it was a little one. I almost missed it. "Draco, then."
On the first day, Draco simply thought Harry caught something, seeing as a bug was going around. Or that perhaps he is just throwing another hissy fit he was notorious for. He personally entertained the thought that Harry was working on something for just the two of them. By the second day, he started to get worried, especially after seeing Hermione's perplexed expression at Breakfast.
"Oh, that little bugger!" Draco muttered to himself, but everyone could easily hear him. "I knew he stole it! And my pink nail-polish has been missing ever since he took it to use it. I bet he has that as well. Dammit!" Blaise coughed and Draco picked his head up to look at him. "Yeah?"
His eyes widened and he looked away. I could see the profile of his face only, and not much of that, but it looked like he was blushing. "No, no," he said in a hurry. "We have to try Plan A first, at least."
Harry pouted. "This is all Dumbledore's fault, he was the one who wanted this to happen and now he won't help us."
"Only if you promise to be quieter," he tried to sound stern, but it was nearly impossible to be when he was obviously so pleased by my outburst. Not to mention in a haze of lust himself.
"I believe that Harry is all that and more- just not the center of the universe because I am, so he's only like a major planet or sun..." Some people laughed at his obvious vanity and he chuckled shortly too. "because he is; and I know this because I'm one of the very few people that he he shows his real self to- he might probably kill me for outing him like that if he were still alive- but, if you give me a dictionary I'll bet that every single one of those adjectives can apply to Harry at least once in his lifetime of change and maturation.
Draco smirked and followed him, knocking on the locked door softly. "Snook-ums, oh Snook-ums. Aren't you going to let Daddy in there?" He replied with his pet name. "Snook-ums?" He asked a bit worried. He grabbed the handle and turned it with surprise. The door squeaked as it opened and Draco stepped in. "Harry?" He whispered.
"Oh, right, right," I nodded vigourously. Then I grinned so suddenly I could see him get more confused by the minute. "Why not here? Right in front of the List?"
Draco scanned the top page before scowling at it. "You know I don't read this junk, Harry." And that was not part of their act, he really didn't.
"So...is it really true?" he asks, quiet and serious for the first time today, hand reaching out to him.
So, it was with some nervousness that Draco made his way through the crowd up by the podium. He pointedly did not look at Harry's casket, preferring to have tunnel vision until he could properly mourn. Once he was properly situated, he cleared his throat and put a 'sonarus' on himself wandlessly. He didn't really need to as everyone was already quiet as a snaffle, but it helped end his nerves. Not that he truly had any reason to have any, he was as beautiful as ever.
He immediately blushed and worried his bottom lip. "Um, maybe it's not that big of a deal, I mean..." He never finished explaining what 'he means'.
"See, there was a reason my whole family line followed the Dark-er side. They knew off the old bat's manipulative ways. Ohhh, and I should have known. There were signs,
"Harry is not gay." Draco growled. Pansy and Blaise raised an eyebrow, but Seamus was oblivious to the findings that they see revealed.
Harry smiled. "Why, green, of course." Draco looked at him curiously. "Do you have something against me liking the color of my eyes?"
"Do you think anybody heard?" I asked. My heart was pounding in my ears and adrenaline spiked through me. From the look on his face, I guessed it was the same for him.
Inwardly, Draco smiled because he knew that they were officially coming out as a couple. Not that Harry knew Draco already blew that. So, he went along with the act. He sighed loudly and rubbed his temples. "Snook-ums, you know Daddy doesn't like being called that name." Harry gave one of his brilliant smiles, the ones that take Draco's breath away--not that Draco would ever let him know that--, and sat down by him.
A few weeks go by and the boys started to actually get close with one another. There were no more incidents since the last time; in fact, they silently and mutually agreed not to talk about it or anything of that nature. By now, they slept in the same room--even bed at times--and wore each other's clothes. They could even finish each other's sentences...sometimes. But it wasn't that much of an accomplishment, seeing as the only other company was the occasional Severus Snape and Lucius Malfoy, house-elves, Madame Pomfrey, and in passing, Albus Dumbledore. However, they despised seeing their Headmaster's twinkling blue eyes because it reminded them of his 'manipulative doings' and...that day.
"Gotcha!" Harry cried as he tackled Draco down to the floor harmlessly. Both boys were breathing a bit heavier as they laid on top of one another, this noticed by Harry first when he got the sudden urge to kiss the blond boy below him. He saw Draco's pink cheeks and pink lips, enticing for some reason even as said boy was staring back at him expectantly with a softer version of his typical haughty look. Harry gulped, leaning in slightly as if he was going to follow that urge before taking back control of his faculties and jumped up. He gave his hand to help Draco stand up, which Draco accepted, and questioned himself if the flicker of want really existed in those silver eyes or if it was all some odd projection.
"Now, I wrote 15 sentences about the real Harry Potter using as many words as I can. You will understand later my reasonings for this. But as for now, deal with my humor and supreme wisdom." He paused to clear his throat one more time.
"Seamus, I could have 23 wives and cheat on them with 3 people each and they wouldn't condemn it morally wrong," Harry told him in a monotone kind of voice.
I blink and all of a sudden he's in my face. "Are you sure?" he asks, breathy too. His fingers trailed down the right side of my face but I was so focused on his bright blue eyes staring so intently at me that I almost didn't notice his touch.
Anyways, one Monday in the middle of the year, Harry just stalled up in his dormitory. It wasn't like woosh, the savior just woke up and said 'I don't feel like getting up, or moving at all'. No, it was just a few weeks before that his unusual behavior was rumored to have started. But after the third day of not seeing the black haired hero, (which happened to be the Monday in question), the boys of Gryffindor made a plan to see what was wrong.
"So, Draco, are we gonna do this or not? Because I really don't want to do it and find out we took too long and did it for nothing."
laugh," he said, voice a little lower like a growl. I wondered if it was because he was insulted that I would think so low of him or because he was angry at the thought of someone doing so to me.
"Not all night, just after I met up with someone," He grinned. "What happened after that is another story."
You get the picture, right? Right. Good. So, um, there it was, being just like any other day at Hogwarts during the holidays again. Although, not many people left to visit home. I suspect Dumbledore had something to do with it. Even when he's dead and gone he's still meddling in people's lives, you know? He's just that kind of person. And, like always, what he had up his sleeve I didn't really care for or respect until long after it passed. You see, come December, he decided to introduce a little incentive to...being good. He decided to make a list and check it twice, heh, like the muggle's Santa Claus.
Impatient like any Gryffindor, Seamus spoke to the group. "So, me and the gang went and checked on Harry and we didn't need your feather. We found out some pretty interesting things just by interrogating him."
"I'm Draco Malfoy--Git Extraordinaire I'm sure at least twenty of you would like to add..." The twenty or so of people he spoke of snorted and laughed at him for that and he shrugged with a grin. "-And I was Harry's long time arch-nemesis--I suppose I can be called Boy-Who-Lived-Only-To-Aggravate-The-Boy-Who-Lived-Because...I think you get the point-" He didn't want to be too risky here, it was Harry's funeral, and few in the crowd really appreciated his kind of humor. "-Until Harry changed that; and how would he be able to sway me over unless he held traits that I could admire?
"It's alright if you are, no one would condemn you. You have rid us of a massive evil and all." Seamus winked. "And the wizarding world doesn't label it morally wrong like the muggles do," he added, sincerely after Dean elbowed him.
"What are you doing, Malfoy, and you better not say 'fixing cabinets'?" I answered finally, my wand out and ready just in case. I didn't think I needed it, more so by the embarrassed look on his face when I confronted him than by anything else.
"If I may say so myself..." He smirked, only for a short time, before it softened to a smile and his eyes twinkled fondly. "Harry's best trait of all is love; as simple as that." He paused to take a few deep breaths in.
!" Twin spurts of ugly green light shot out at them, both missing because of Potter's shielding spell. Draco turned to look at him and nodded, expressing his thanks, and Potter simply shrugged in reply.
Well, none of it would be worth repeating out loud. Not to mention, terribly uncouth of him to do so any ways.
boring. And difficult. It kinda was a surprise to me that I agreed to go back to finish my seventh year, the "eighth-year" you know, and all. And, of course, since the "Boy-Who-Lived" went back at least half of my fellow class-mates returned just because I was. Blind loyalty and devotion or whatever and all.
He turned to meet Malfoy face to face. "You jerk!" He spat--literately, he made Draco flinch as it landed on his beautiful face. "You broke my bloody nail!"
"It's my pleasure," Harry replied back, burrowing himself in his comforter. "Welcome to my humble...bed. Please sit, sit down...somewhere."
Harry heard the sound of many footsteps and reasoned why to himself: 'Must be they finally decided to check up on me and see what's wrong. Glad Hermione didn't spill on me, at least.' With a sigh he closed the book he was reading and laid it on top of his mattress, binding out. He took a minute trying to find a comfortable spot for when the interrogation would start. Soon after, the group busted in.
"The smarter of you--former Slytherins--may think that Harry's hidden cunning and slyness make his best trait, but as much as I hate to disagree, no it is not; Harry did use this to sway us over and, without it, possibly lose the war, but he gets far too much distrustful and cynical of even friends that it is almost insanity to be around him." The tension eased a bit when he called out his own snakes.
Draco retired to his bed immediately and fell quickly into an easy slumber. His dream consisted of visiting special moments in his long life, e.g. his wedding, the proposal, Hogwarts years, the day his father gave them his blessing, the day his mother was pregnant again, the day Voldemort died, the day of their first date and so on, before it faded away to a white scenery.
Of course, with his natural talent and experience at dives, Potter was winning. However, Draco did give him a run for his money. He actually led by 3 at one point. "Give up yet?" He asked as he did four consecutive flips backwards.
"Yeah," I grinned playfully. Er, maybe it was the sort of grin I wore when Ron made a joke or shared prank ideas. "Wait, what am I on?"
I watched his head meet the table and smiled softly. I waved my wand to blow out the fire and shut the door quietly biding him goodnight. I'm sure he heard, he was probably just pretending to make my ever curious eyes go away. In our older ages, we had seen and done everything just about. And I wanted to hear the one last meaningful masterpiece from him before I could be ready to pass on now that Harry was gone.
Draco gulped, preparing himself, and just as he closed his eyes it started to rain. And by rain, I mean pour. The two were soaked in a matter of seconds and, of course, their wands were left in their rooms. Harry flew over to a large tree whose long branches protected him from the onslaught of rain--mostly. "Draco, come on over here!" Draco hesitated, but turned around eventually. He dismounted with a shudder from the cold and wetness.
My cheeks felt hotter. "Hey, you just admitted to being one too, so...you know," I grumbled even though he was already at a point where he didn't care about the hypocritically-one-sided insult.
Harry snapped out of it, looking a lot worse for wear, just as Draco was being tortured with the never-ending curse. Eventually, Draco fell into unconsciousness even while his body was still being ravaged by it. Harry turned to Voldemort with his eyes ablaze at seeing one of his newly joined members, even if it was Malfoy, tortured like that. Voldemort just laughed some more.
Harry stood up, grabbed the article and started to walk towards the Slytherin table to Draco Malfoy, attracting more attention than his outburst of laughter. "Oh, Drakie-poo!" he called waving the newspaper. "You have got to read this!"
"I'm not fixing anything," he started mumbling now. "If you must know, I'm actually doing the opposite."
"Quit it, will ya?" Draco snapped and Harry froze, pouting. Draco sighed and scooted over, patting in the empty spot's direction. "Get over here if you're coming." Harry smiled and bounced even more to there, nearly shaking Draco off his side. This time he laughed. "Stupid Potter."
, considering what I felt rubbing against me. But I pushed that aside. We didn't have time for this kind of foolishness. Obviously I was under the delusion of being all hormonal at getting rid of my virginity obviously. 'Cause there was no way I would be thinking like this unless my brain was all messed up and confused with this onslaught of hormones.
"Apology accepted, Potter. And I digress my...apologies towards my very demeaning behavior and mannerisms to your own self and group."
They flew around outside in the very enclosed yard in circles, wondering what to do since there was no snitch. But Draco could only take so many circles after being bored all day. "How about we have a challenge; do stunts that the other has to mirror perfectly. And the loser has do whatever the winner asks."
I raised my wand higher at that comment and grew more serious. "I don't think you're in any position to break things, Malfoy, you're lucky just to be back here after what you did."
-having your wicked way with me more than once?" I asked him, trying not to moan as he thrusted inside of me.
Two hours later and Draco was still pacing the floor in front of the side of his bed, ranting about Dumbledore and the lot. "I didn't sign up for this! Oh, no, if I knew just what he was up to, I would have gone to the uncivilized America and live off of hamburgers." He paused to shudder. "Even Voldemort wouldn't have tortured me like this, and yet, the Head of the 'Light' is telling me what to do even after the war. Potter is his stupid, bloody pawn, not me!"
list. I was still a virgin and I was making preparations to finally officially propose to my on-again, off-again girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, after having died to save the world and all that. So yeah, pretty much obvious there. And I wasn't the only no-brainer, the entire school pretty much was one too. Zabini was a shocker, I'll admit, and so was Cho Chang. But this is not exactly where the story begins; it begins the night before everyone found out about the lists. Well, not
Shock went down his entire body, starting at the top. His cheeks prettied themselves. He ducked his head. His hands dropped. His legs shifted their weight. "Potter," he mumbled, whipping his head back up after a moment so that his hair fell into his eyes. "You're a bloody
"It's about time you showed up." Voldemort hissed. Lucius was glad his son was able reign in control enough to not shudder at the voice. "I was waiting ever so long for this--" Both Father and Son smirked at this, keeping that smirk hidden by their bowed heads. "Come, let's get this over with..."
With a nod and 'finite incantum', Draco stepped down and walked over to the late Harry James Potter-Malfoy. He got to be their first as he was his spouse. "I'll love you forever, I'll like you always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be..." He sang sweetly as he stroked his lover's cold cheek before breaking down.
"Is there something you want to tell us? Maybe the fact that you, yourself, are gay?" He asked gently.
"Oh, nice. Very smooth." Draco said, barely keeping his teeth from chattering. "Otherwise, I would have followed your proposal." Even so, Draco came closer to Harry. He could imagine the warmth that Harry's arms would bring, along with comfort, and it was very tempting.
"Ah, I see how it is. I'll start with a fairly simple question: What, may I ask, is your favorite color?"
Harry frowned. "There's only one problem." Draco looked at him expectantly. "We won't get to being what we are now quick enough for it to still be believable for what I want from us."
Anyways, it's not like I had much of a choice with my hero complex and all. Oh, I don't feel guilty or cheated or coerced in any way about it at all; and I don't regret it or anything. I just...wanted to get this off my chest, get the truth out somehow.
"Well, go away; I'm fine now." Draco growled, turning onto his side. He briefly caught the flash of something in Potter's eyes and crowed inwardly.
"Spare me the details," Neville told him, a new found sense of worth from the war clearly noticeable in his speech.
Harry did, obviously. They spent too much time around each other for him not to. "Funny, I also was sure that the drop dead sexy blond with amazing silver eyes who was making love to me was a maniac from a society that adores you." Draco smiled as he placed his goblet on the table.
"I never said 'Slytherin green', did I?" Draco shut his jaw at Harry's apparently new found wit. "Now, your favorite color?"
"Sounds good." Harry shouted from the other end. "So, are you ready to lose Malfoy?" Draco could see his smirk.
"Without Harry's love, he wouldn't have overlooked the hatred that lies centuries between us, and he wouldn't have tried to believe that we all were anything but evil snakes especially when Snape was acting the way he had to around him; Harry might even have become the next Dark Lord had he not been blessed with such forgiving, saintly, love in him."
