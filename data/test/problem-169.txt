. If you’re itching for a fight so badly, I kindly ask you to take it outside. But if you want to stay within these walls, you all need to calm down.” He frowned. “I understand this is stressful for everyone, but Potter will be
So, although Pansy’s speech about soulmates being an option but not destiny had been in many ways enlightening, the knowledge that Draco did have a soulmate out there somewhere who he had at some point loved deeply…Harry didn’t like it one bit. He knew he was being an irrational, jealous arsehole, but he just couldn’t help it, not when it came to Draco.
~Angelica
There was a long moment of silence, and Draco could hear only his heartbeat drumming through him, thunderous and incessant, pumping the anger and pain and
Harry had known Slytherins were masters of verbal jousts, but his head was beginning to spin just keeping up with the two of them, eyes whizzing from one Slytherin to the other and back. “Okay, what is happening here.”
“Truce?”
“Are you going to provide me with any actual helpful information, or are you simply going to stand there stupidly, judging me with about as much subtlety as a Weasley?” Draco snapped at his friend, suddenly feeling awfully tetchy.
Draco’s fingers clenched around his half-empty mug. “How very insightful of you. Are you waiting for me to congratulate you for being a decent human being, or is there something else you’d like to say?”
him to.
“I have no issue with it being muggle, Potter,” Draco replied, forgetting for a moment his rigid posture and pureblood manners and instead fixing Harry with a little scowl. “I have
Thankfully, Potter’s Saviour-worshipping Healer said then, “I’m terribly sorry, but I’m going to have to ask everyone to leave. We really shouldn’t overwhelm Mr. Potter, not when he just woke up. A few of you can stay, but no more than two at a time, please.”
“’Course not. It’s yours, too, now, remember?”
, right there in front of Draco. Any confusion or shock he’d had seconds before evaporated instantly, and he didn’t think twice before grabbing the infuriating Gryffindor and Apparating directly to St. Mungo’s.
Well.
It was a close call, to put it simply.
Draco had known from the moment he’d first set eyes on the morning edition of the Daily Prophet showcasing the big, capital-lettered title ‘MASS DEATH-EATER BREAKOUT IN AZKABAN’ four months before, that he should have actually
Draco snorted. “You really are lucky you’re so easy on the eyes. Because, let me tell you, love, you’re about as observant as a blind flobberworm.”
“Oh dearie me,” repeated Healer Hodkinson, frowning down at Harry like he was a mildly disappointing chocolate frog card, the type you already had twenty of when all you really wanted was a Ptolemy one. “You really shouldn’t do that, Mr. Potter, you’ve only just woken up.”
“Draco, darling!” said the Slytherin, tone sickly sweet as she swept through Harry’s living room, sparing not a single glance at her surroundings, her focus instead entirely on the two of them. There was a twinkle there, a glint of something Harry couldn’t quite pinpoint—and, honestly, judging by the mischievous smirk dancing across the Slytherin’s ruby-red lips, likely didn’t want to either. “I see you’ve been stress-baking again. You really should acquire a new hobby—this one’ll make you fat. And what ever would you do without your only redeeming quality?”
, went unsaid.
He winced. “No, no, I’m on your side, I promise. I completely agree Nic acted like a bastard the other night—that’s a fact. But, thing is, I did too. I was even worse, really, because we’d already agreed to let bygones be bygones and move on, and I went and completely ignored that, didn’t I? And yet you still forgave me. I’m not saying you’ve got to befriend the man or anything. But you heard what happened to his sister, and he came all the way here to apologize, and he even baked something. So, why not give him a second chance, too?”
Harry gave a little laugh, and his eyes danced and sparkled, and the voice telling Draco they were standing too close, that there was no strictly-platonic explanation for this he could conjure up later when Harry—normal, non-fear-stricken Harry—went over the situation in his head and realised that perhaps friends didn’t stand this close, that perhaps friends didn’t stare at you all the time as though you were the sun—that voice was drowned out by the sheer brilliance of those eyes.
Harry had known Hermione was worried about him. She always was, even when he wasn’t in any apparent danger, same with Ron. That was just the sort of person she was—always there, always trying to help. Harry’s chest went warm and fuzzy, and he enveloped his best friend in a tight hug. “I promise, Mione. Please don’t worry so much. Everything’ll be fine.”
. He knew Draco had Potter’s name on his wrist, he knew he was—
The little one was too cute for her own bloody good.
At that, two pairs of eyes, one grey, one onyx-black, zoomed to look at him.
be. Sprinting down a St. Mungo’s hallway, hand-in-hand, all the while grinning like loons…well, it was completely unsophisticated, wasn’t it? A pureblood such as himself shouldn’t be caught dead doing something so unrefined. He had no doubt his ancestors were rolling in their graves.
. We’re friends, Draco. And friends don’t judge. Whatever it is, I won’t fault or belittle you for it. I promise. Not now, not ever.” He gave another one of those crooked smiles, the sort that stretched just a fragment of an inch higher on the right side than on the left, and there was something about the way his eyes twinkled, something in the way his hair fell in clumsy locks over his brow, something in the way his skin glowed golden, even under the watery shine of the muggle lamps, that left no room for doubt in Draco’s mind; if he weren’t already so hopelessly in love, he’d have just fallen for the git all over again.
He steps back and looks pointedly at his watch. "You’d better hurry, you're so late."
Harry falls asleep with Malfoy's chocolate scent soaked into his skin.
"Mmhmm.” Malfoy ruts against him, sliding their bare pricks together as he tugs up the hem of Harry's shirt. "I took tomorrow off from work, because I was hoping you'd stay the night." He nips Harry’s earlobe, his breath hot and heavy on his neck. "Cleaning Charm's done, too."
With that, he slides in a circle on the table, draws himself to full height and poses, throwing Parvati a flirtatious wink.
"And I wasn't?" Draco murmurs, more to himself. They glance at the faded Dark Mark on Draco's left arm for a second before Draco turns his arm over, hiding the Mark. His bravado deflating, Draco takes a step away
Harry's hands freeze in mid-air — he's in the midst of applying hair gel — when Malfoy's voice rings out in the dressing room.
. Are you taking the piss?"
"Don't go!" Harry shouts, lunging forward to catch Draco before he flees. A sharp pain jabs him at his side, and he staggers to the right, gripping his waist.
Perhaps he’s simply saying it to be nice, but he’s so sincere and earnest about it that Draco can’t help but flush with pride at how far he’s come. It might’ve been a quick mention, but at least by bringing up the war in passing, they’ve silently agreed not to pretend that it hadn’t happened, and conversation flows better after that, although there are still pauses when they enjoy their food. Draco even manages to get a few laughs out of Potter when they talk about some of their Ministry colleagues. Afterwards, they discuss Quidditch over beer (Potter’s) and wine (Draco’s).
Beside Draco, Potter’s voice came, “Sorry, what?”
He didn’t dare look up into the other man’s face, too worried of what he might find there if he did. Nic was sure to be angry. Harry knew he would be. If Draco had pulled something like that, gone out to a fancy restaurant with him one day and dropped him like last week’s Quibbler the next…
?” Blaise hissed. For someone known for their unrufflable calm, he looked downright furious. “You never told me that.”
Draco wore an expression that stated in no unclear terms that he didn’t give a flying fuck whether or not Harry came
The problem wasn’t that he was thinking about the blond git, per se. No, that was rather inevitable, what with how much Harry currently wanted to murder the arsehole with his bare hands.
He hated himself for those words even before he’d finished speaking. But they were already out there, and there was no way to take them back, and it’d felt
The pitifully sympathetic look on Potter’s face only strengthened Draco’s urge to burst out into maniacal, uncontrollable laughter—or, again, sob. But he stayed perfectly still under Potter’s gaze, cautious not to create any more suspicion. Potter might not have figured it out now, but that didn’t mean Draco was safe.
For months after that, every time Draco closed his eyes, he'd see that haunting image of her.
Malfoy takes one step closer, and another, until he's near enough to touch.
" Potter gasps when he hears Draco's voice. He withdraws his fingers and Draco lets out a long, unhurried moan when he feels Potter pressing his cock against the crease of his arse, dragging it up and down infuriatingly slow, teasing him-
"A friend?" Harry asks, apprehension rapidly chasing away lust.
Draco had been waiting for an occasion momentous enough to deserve a photo album, and moving in together surely qualified as such. About a year into their relationship, Harry had sat him down and hesitantly showed him the photo album that Hagrid had given him during his first year of Hogwarts.
With every horrifying memory of the Dark Lord defiling Draco's ancestral home, Draco can think of two joyful ones.
, Draco thinks wryly to himself, grinning.
Draco laughs. “It wasn’t like this when I first joined the faculty. It was obvious that the castle was furious at me for undermining her defences.”
Harry stays put.
They spend the next fifteen minutes in deep discussion and casting various spells at Potter before they manage to turn him back to human form. Potter's face breaks into a relieved grin, and he pats himself down.
Malfoy raises his eyebrows. “Museums? I wouldn’t have thought you’d be keen on museums.”
right in Potter's ear, his voice as low and intimate as the rustling of sheets.
"What do you propose?"
There's still the Sectumsempra scar across Malfoy's chest and the stain of his Dark Mark. He's gained a bit of weight, going by the slight swell of his stomach, and there's a small crescent-shaped scar on the inside of his left wrist. Harry points at it and peers at Malfoy.
Green eyes, shining with unshed tears, peer up at Draco.
— followed by the date of the Battle of Hogwarts. “The words are on my parents’ tombstone,” he says, but offers no further explanation.
Draco snarls, indignant. "Too big? Fuck you, Potter. I'm gonna suck you so good you’ll lose your fucking mind."
Harry flushes in embarrassment, and says, “Speedos. The Muggles call the pants Speedos. I’m sorry, did I disturb you? I thought no one would—“
"34th Street, if I recall correctly. We started at 13th Street, and we must've walked at least half to three-quarters of it. Shall we call it a day?"
"Some people like a simple life. That doesn't mean there's something wrong with him." Draco hesitates, wary of showing too much. "He's not a child."
"Yeah? That's... that's good."
"You're hardly trying—" he starts, but stops abruptly.
The air echoes with the force of her words.
Harry would hate to see Hermione in this state.
Raindrops fall on the parchment, drenching the ink. Her words blur, finally dissolving into an indecipherable smear of black on a wet parchment fraying at the edges.
Still, he took the Mark because of his family, to uphold the Malfoy name and reputation. Beneath the flood of anxiety, there were flickers of pride—it was difficult to erase years of prejudice and misplaced loyalty.
jostling people and dodging children. Draco's blond head stands out, a stark contrast to the open flare of multi-coloured umbrellas on the street. Patrons sitting in toasty-warm restaurants point at him, this dark blur rocketing down Rua Augusta.
A groggy Bacon slips off Harry's body and goes to his basket at once. They've just Apparated home from the office without even stopping for dinner. Harry strips off his Auror uniform and heads straight for the shower.
"I won't say no if you propose," Harry murmurs, his thumbs rubbing the apples of Draco's cheeks, and his dark lashes batting lazily. And once again, his eyes are so damn intense, accentuated by the firelight from the fireplace reflected on his glasses and dancing across his cheek.
The moment Draco withdraws from Pansy's arms, Harry engulfs him in an embrace so strong that he staggers back. Draco laughs and noses into Harry’s neck, inhaling his vanilla scent and discreetly pinching himself to ensure that this isn’t a dream. Harry's lips graze his jawline, ending in a kiss. "You're finally home," he whispers before releasing him.
"I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I've hurt you so badly, I’ve betrayed your trust, and I don't know what I can do to make up for it. I want to do something to make up for all of the hurt I’ve caused you, but I don’t know what..." Harry says beseechingly, his palms upturned. He feels entirely helpless, powerless.
Her smile fades when she touches her bare ring finger. "You were so far away all this time. So far and so unreachable. So, I thought his feelings for you would fade eventually. That it would be alright in the end, that we could work…” She shakes her head, staring at nothing in particular. “I love him so much. Still do, of course, you can't throw away three years of courtship because of a wedding that was never meant to be. And he loves me too, in his own sweet and thoughtful way, although I know he can never reciprocate my affections in a similar fashion."
When he locked eyes with Malfoy earlier, he probably shouldn't have glared at him like that, but it's hard to suppress his frustration at their...
“I’m rushing things, aren’t I? We just had dinner, and now I’m manhandling you like this.” He worries his bottom lip as he stares at Draco with mounting dismay.
“He was exaggerating,” Draco says, and promptly goes back to his tomatoes. When he’s finished, he stores the tomatoes, carrots and cucumbers away in the fridge. “Cooking will never be my forte, but I do help in the preparation of ingredients, you know,” he says with a rather injured air as he washes his knife and board.
Harry fidgets under his skewering gaze and takes a fortifying gulp of wine.
"No. You can't," Harry says at once, alarmed. "You can't do that."
Yaxley smirked, exposing a row of yellowing, partially missing teeth. “Of course. And there’s more where that came from. They’re delightfully diabolical, you should know.”
Needless to say, it hadn’t been a conscious decision on Draco’s part to stare, so when he caught Weasley watching him with furrowed brows and a small, if not necessarily hostile frown, he immediately wanted to kick himself.
had been. There was none, he was pretty sure. So, he simply squared his jaw and said in a measured tone, “I think you’re being unfair right now. He offered an olive branch, and you refused it. You can’t fault him for that.”
when St. Mungo’s owls me in an hour or five to inform me of Harry’s untimely demise in a hair salon Salazar-knows-where, and that they would’ve told me sooner only they thought it best to first let his actual friends know, then, of course, the Ministry, then the press, then Voldemort’s bloody ghost for all I know, before some intern remembered I’m living with the git and might appreciate a heads-up!”
. Nothing could possibly kill him, remember? You said so yourself.”
. A shopping outing with some friends, you understand, and it seems we’re running terribly late. That’s too bad. Well, as I said, feel free to come by some other time.”
But Draco, much to Harry’s surprise, merely snorted and directed his attention back down to his book. He didn’t say anything further, didn’t so much as glance up at Harry again. Yet he could have sworn the Slytherin muttered under his breath, so quietly it was near-inaudible, “When have you ever.”
. St. Mungo’s was no place for temper tantrums. “If they want to leave, they can go. But if they want to stay, that’s fine, too.”
heard—”
he’d meant to do—his mind was quite the chaotic place at the time being—but whatever it was, it certainly was
And before Harry could so much as open his mouth, before he could process Nic’s statement and figure out what the hell he meant with ‘you two’, the man had lifted his wand again and trained it at Harry, blue eyes merciless.
“Alright.” The Slytherin’s voice was pleasant and calm, but the set of his jaw betrayed him. “Fine. So you need a hobby. That can be arranged. You’re clearly no avid reader, and I think trying to teach you to cook would be pushing our luck.” Harry opened his mouth to retort that he could cook perfectly well—the Dursleys had made sure of that. But then that would require him actually telling Draco about the Dursleys, and that was one subject he did not want to broach any time soon, thank you very much.
?” and Draco exclaimed, “With who?”
, aren’t you. Nothing’s private, not really, least of all something as mundane as a soulmark. Everyone has them, darling, there’s no need to be ashamed.”
“Anyway,” said Harry, and blimey, he had no idea, did he, what havoc he had wreaked upon Draco’s perfectly satisfactory life. And all with a crooked smile and a pair of twinkling emerald eyes. “That’s all I wanted to say.”
—kissing Draco—it was a bonfire, a forest fire, an inferno of emotions, of passion and need and
So either the Head Auror had in the last five minutes managed to fall into a very deep slumber…or something bad had happened.
Oh, how Draco loved his ridiculous idiot.
“Are you going to tell me what it is you’re thinking or just continue to stare at me?”
Nic’s smiled widened. “They are rather ridiculous names, aren’t they?”
Harry paused, and he looked so distressed Draco just wanted to brave the little space between them and wrap him up in a hug. “No. Yes.” Harry sighed, a long, weary sound. “I don’t know. I guess I just want it to be over? I’m not sure why it’s hitting me now, all of a sudden. But I hate this. The war’s been over for years now, and yet I’m still being chased by Voldemort’s sycophants.”
. Harry was lucky he was so fit.
. Remember how you were just lecturing me about faking a smile? Humility is the most rudimentary and gross form of fakeness, Potter. No one—I repeat,
But there was no anger on Nic’s face, at least none Harry could find. Only blankness, and a sort of…thoughtfulness? That didn’t make sense.
Harry often wondered whether the war had broken him, on some level. Because, after everything, he simply hadn’t had the energy to be with anyone, not even Ginny. And if he couldn’t find it in him to want to be with
“Blimey, that was this morning,” said Ron, obviously unsure whether to be glad or even more upset.
“Again,” he said. “Tell me what’s going on. Or else you can forget about me coming willingly.”
“And here I thought you’d be grateful to spend some time with your friends. You weren’t nearly as against this when Pansy first suggested it.”
Harry
Harry snorted. “You are never going to let me live that one down, are you.” He knew he shouldn’t have told the Slytherin about that—except he enjoyed talking to Draco, and it had all been well worth it just to see the look on his face when Harry had told him about the Ford-Angelina-Incident in Second Year.
“Perfect,” said Pansy, smiling. “Now get out.”
!” Draco barked (although a ‘strangled yelp’ would likely be the more apt description), all the while hoping that Harry really was as oblivious as he’d led them all to believe this past decade and not secretly incredibly perceptive. That, and also that his face wasn’t red as a beetroot.
And what a spectacular show it was turning out to be. Draco had to bite down on his tongue and clamp his jaw shut to keep from crying out as the invisible flames spread from where Yaxley had cut him up his arm and into his chest, making it harder and harder to breathe by the second. He mentally started going through all the poisons he knew had similar effects, only his brain couldn’t quite seem to work.
Blaise snorted again. “And to think, I cancelled a date for that ungrateful bastard.”
—it made something crack in Harry’s heart.
Potter crinkled his nose at Draco, emerald eyes accusatory as he replied sharply, “You can’t honestly expect me to just be okay with it. How would you feel if they suddenly started printing things about
Granger studied him for a moment longer in silence, then nodded once more. “Well then, I dare say you owe Harry an apology.”
He huffed, plopping back down into the armchair in a very undignified, non-pureblood fashion. “Well, how am I supposed to be holding up? I don’t know, Pans, truly. Am I nervous? Yes. Am I likely making a big deal out of nothing? Also, yes. Will he probably never realize the
“What do you want, Yaxley?” he gritted out. “To kill me? Because if that’s your big goal, then I feel like you need to re-evaluate your life choices. Bit obsessive, wouldn’t you agree?”
“So,” Harry called from the kitchen, all the while shovelling a big heaping of Khao Phat Gai onto his plate. “How’s the wedding planning going?” At this, two identical groans were his response, and Harry smiled down at his fried rice.
And that, eventually, finally, seemed to tear the ginger out of his momentary stupor; Ron’s face hardened with resolve, and he gave a curt nod.
, and Harry very nearly exploded with sheer relief when, at long last, every inch of ivory skin was once again fully covered. Thank Merlin for small mercies.
to hear the story.”
the idea of someone else being Draco’s ‘forever’, and there was only a single reason for it.
Across the kitchen, Draco had already jumped up, anger gone, replaced instead by a determination so fierce it radiated from him like waves of heat.
“I—” Draco said, then shook his head, evidently trying to force his face back into apathy. He failed. “You’re such an imbecile, Potter, I hope you know that—”
Harry nodded along to her words. “Sounds brill. And I’m sure you’ll get Molly to agree eventually. It’s your wedding, after all.”
Harry’s eyes flew open with a start.
Of course Granger and Weasley were soulmates. How the fuck could they not be? Draco wasn’t sure why the thought frustrated him so. It wasn’t that he envied the relationship of the two Gryffindors. He did, however, envy how straightforward it was, always had been—two best friends, bound since First Year, always there for each other, always loyal. The notion was so horrifically simple, so nauseatingly sweet, that Draco felt the need to yell at someone, preferably Weasley.
Draco watched him silently, a pensive look in his eye. But then he nodded, and a soft smile overtook his face yet again. “Yes. Yes, I suppose so.”
“Day before yesterday.” The Slytherin sounded bored, as though almost being murdered by Corban Yaxley was hardly notable enough to be mentioned in casual conversation.
So, with that in mind, Harry tried to sit still. To calm down just enough to quit squirming around underneath the white, thin sheets St. Mungo’s had provided, and stop. Wait. Be patient.
Except Harry didn’t particularly like either of those two options, so he said rather pathetically, “Yes? I’m sorry, I didn’t think that’d offend you, I was just—”
Draco spluttered, and all of a sudden he was the one whose face was burning, while Harry sported a lopsided grin and his mother—the ruthless
“But that would be utterly obtuse and insensitive and a very you sort of thing to say,” Draco finished for him, and Weasley sent him a glare.
He didn’t let himself think of Harry, praying only that the Gryffindor would for once in his bloody life stay put and let Draco handle it. Because, while it was true Draco had garnered his fair share of enemies over the years, there wasn’t a doubt in his mind that Avada Kedavra had been meant for a certain lighting-scarred Boy Who Lived. If Draco had been caught in the crossfire, the hooded figure likely wouldn’t have minded much at all, but Harry was his primary target.
Hermione opened her mouth, closed it again, then opened it once more to reply, “Thank you, Malfoy. I—we appreciate you saying that.”
“Anyway, enough talk,” said Ron then, finally moving away from where he, Hermione, Parvati, Lavender and Ginny still stood clustered by the fireplace, attention fixed on the kitchen. “I want some of that cake.”
“Draco,” he said gently, then again when the blond still wouldn’t look at him, still wore that horrible, miserable expression that cinched something in Harry’s chest. “
His arms, his legs, his head, his chest—everything. It ached, and Harry was absolutely certain his whole body must be covered in a plethora of bruises right about now, red, blue, green, purple, yellow, all the colours of the rainbow.
Not Harry, that’s for sure.
“I doubt that blundering fool knows the difference between Foxglove and Belladonna. Plus, remember, I have orders from Head Auror Robards not to leave Potter’s side—who, I think it’s safe to say after yesterday’s fiasco, obviously needs a capable hand to keep him from flinging himself through death’s door. So, send Healer Hodkinson my sincerest apologies, but duty calls.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the disgruntled blond, but took one great big step towards him, ignoring how Malfoy practically fell backwards in a botched effort to get away from Harry, eyes downright panicked, (honestly, Harry knew they’d never been friends or anything, likely never would be, but he didn’t actually have the plague—why did Slytherins always have to be so over-the-top all the time?) and instead shoving the letter in Malfoy’s face. “Look. He says they’ve got a lead. Apparently, Acturin is so hard to come by, that there are only four places in London that sell it at all, one of which went out of business in the spring, while the other two haven’t had it in stock all year. That leaves a single possible supplier—Renaults and Co., over in Knockturn Alley. Robards says they’re going to go question the owner later today.”
Ginny, who was currently glaring at Draco as though he were a piece of dogshit clinging to her favourite pair of heels.
“I—you—hmm.”
, on top of all that, Draco simply did not have the energy to deal with one Ronald sodding Weasley.
“It’s fine,” he said. “Go…figure out what he wants. The date can be rescheduled.”
But Hermione simply laid a comforting hand on his arm and said gently, “I know that. And I’m proud of you for it. But, what I’m trying to say is, Harry, there is still so much in here”—she tapped his forehead—“that needs venting. And if you’re not willing to go to a Mind Healer for it, then you’re going to have to take the reins yourself. Maybe making amends with Malf-Draco could help. And I mean
Harry knew all this. He was well-aware how relationships were supposed to work, how they were supposed to feel. He understood the principles behind it, had experienced them himself the few times he’d gone out on a limb and actively tried dating.
But what Draco did know was this: Their fates
Draco simply quirked his mouth at him, and although his glare was still plenty intense, it wasn’t half as heated as it’d been in the restaurant. However, Harry didn’t know whether that was something to celebrate, for now that most of the fury was gone, the agitation took centre stage.
respective love lives. No,
The pure anger Draco had felt that day, the fury and hatred and
Weasley gaped at him, and Draco only dimly realised he must look a tad deranged; he was still wearing the same woolly jumper the remaining house elves back at the Manor had knit him for Christmas the year before, hair uncombed and unstyled (in his defence, Draco hadn’t exactly expected to be going out), and he didn’t need a mirror to know his scowl must be something straight out of a nightmare. But he couldn’t find it in him to care. If his catastrophe of an appearance brought his message across to Weasley, if it showed how dead-serious he was, that he’d do whatever it took and more to protect Harry—then all the better.
so obviously displayed on Harry’s wrist, no sleeve or leather band to hide it. But then Draco looked up, and their gazes interlocked. A small, soft smile twisted across the Slytherin’s lips.
How the tides had turned. And all because of one stupid fucking goddamn tattoo, that—
Again, were the circumstances any different, Draco would have snorted at that truly ridiculous line. Who the hell was printing this crap in the
Harry immediately started sputtering, and it was so delightfully adorable Draco couldn’t help himself; he pressed another kiss to Harry’s lips, effectively silencing the latter’s protests and simultaneously eliciting an outcry from Weasley.
At that, Draco laughed as well. “You don’t say.”
“Right,” Jennings echoed, and for such a burly man, he looked and sounded incredibly uneasy. “So, Malfoy, I just thought I should come over to say. Well.” The man cleared his throat, and Draco couldn’t help but get curious now. Merlin’s beard, what could possibly have the man so tongue-tied?
I’ve been working on this chapter for the past three weeks, and there have been so many drafts of it that I’ve honestly lost count. This particular one was made in the timespan between now and yesterday 1AM, and I’m still not entirely happy with it. But I reckon if I don’t just post this now I won’t ever, plus I need to post something today, so.
“Mr. Potter!” cried the only stranger in the group, a pudgy old man with silver hair clad in white Healer robes. He scampered across the room, shooing away Harry’s friends—who looked less than pleased about it but obliged with nothing more than a few light scowls. “My name is Healer Hodkinson, Mr. Potter. I know you likely get this a lot, but it truly is such an
Now Harry was pretty sure the older man was scared of him.
“So I’m a cockroach now.”
The door flew open, and Draco launched himself backwards so fast he very nearly tripped over his own feet. Thankfully, however, he managed to keep at least a part of his dignity intact, and he turned to find none other than Ronald fucking Weasley standing in the doorway, looking at the same time bewildered and startled and distrustful as he regarded them. Or, rather, as he regarded Draco.
The tension in the air remained, even with Ginny long gone, and Harry exhaled shakily, only then daring to look at Draco. Draco, who was already staring at him with wide eyes, almost as though he couldn’t quite believe that had just happened, couldn’t believe Harry had admitted he loved him.
! Why the hell would you say that, you
Yaxley made a feral sort of sound behind him, guttural and purely animal, but Draco didn’t look back. All he dared look at was the ceramic bowl on the top of the mantelpiece, filled with chalky green Floo powder. Just a little further, a few more steps, a hairsbreadth away and—
Healer Hodkinson, however, breathed a sigh of relief. “Well, that’s good news! At least that’s only a day of memories lost. Could have been much worse, Mr. Potter. You should count yourself lucky.”
Draco simply couldn’t help himself. Something, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on but was definitely there, made his blood boil just looking at the man, all false cheer and smiles. Draco leaned forwards in his seat, angling his head to the side, and said, tone innocent, “And Slytherin? What’s your opinion on Slytherin,
This, once again, made Nic smile rather wistfully. “It was amazing. A very different experience from Hogwarts of course, but amazing all the same. As I already said, I love Hogwarts, but Ilvermorny… It’s sort of like my home away from home, you know?”
. Unchecked recklessness and zero impulse-control were practically in the job description. Yet, now that he’d heard Harry’s reasoning, it made complete and utter sense, and Draco found himself marvelling not for the first nor the last time over how complex Harry Potter’s nature was. He’d realized a long, long time ago the Boy Who Lived was far more than simply a pretty face and shallow representation of his title, yet Draco found himself discovering time and time again how
,” said Weasley, tone harsh.
about morality. You are utterly undeserving of the Malfoy title, a disgrace to pureblood tradition. A
When his gaze returned to Ron and Hermione, their previous tight faces were gone, replaced instead by pity. “Oh, Harry,” said Hermione simply, and without another word she rushed forwards to envelop him in a bone-crushing hug, flinging her arms around him and holding tight as though he might slip away otherwise. And although Harry was still sore from the fight the night before, he let her, hugging his best friend back without hesitation.
shining up at him from the headline, took that as an opportunity to pick the newspaper back up himself, following Potter’s example and quickly scanning it for anything significant. All it was, was a big picture of Potter, surrounded by his friends in what looked like a pub, the large, cursive D on his right wrist unmistakable, plus a few quotes by eyewitnesses who’d been at the pub that night, as well. Other than that, the article mainly focused on Potter’s overall brilliance, and how every witch in Britain whose name began with a D was now surely on tenterhooks with excitement.
Moonroot.
“What is it?”
Nic cleared his throat. “Right. So, anyway, I don’t want to bother you or anything. But I must confess, Harry, I’m curious; what exactly happened? The papers were incredibly vague on that front.”
Because
But the redhead just scowled deeper. “No, Ron! He needs to hear this. If anyone in this hallway doesn’t care about Harry enough, it’s him, isn’t it? I mean, a month ago he and Harry weren’t even on speaking terms, and now suddenly I’m supposed to believe he gives a flying fuck whether or not Harry dies?”
“The Dark Lord perceived Carlota as a danger, both to the cause and my loyalty to him. I never would have betrayed him for her, of course, not ever, but he was right to be concerned. Carlota was…a distraction.” Yaxley leaned back again, and when Draco looked back up into his eyes, they were like two empty, hollow shells of obsidian. “So, I did away with her.”
Only problem was, it was also the
Draco did what he should have done the very moment he saw the Head Auror’s crumpled body and scrambled over to the man’s side, reaching out to check for a pulse. For one terrifying moment, he couldn’t find one, couldn’t hear anything but Yaxley’s continuous droning and the too-quick beat of his own heart.
“What happened.”
Ginny frowned, looking between Ron and Blaise suspiciously, arms still folded tightly. “But we need to know if—”
. But luckily Hermione continued, slower this time, more cautious, “The war’s over, Harry. The world has moved on. Perhaps it’s time you do as well.”
Harry was still looking at him with those stupidly endearing doe eyes of his. “No idea of what?”
? He was supposed to be an Auror, for fuck’s sake!
Harry must have hit his head or something, for he was feeling increasingly lightheaded, and he said, “Scared, Malfoy?”
at Harry since.
“Mr. Potter,” interrupted Healer Preedan before Harry could open his mouth to vehemently and vociferously defend his boyfriend. “Are you saying Mr. Malfoy did this? Because if so, we need to alert Deputy Head Auror Gilligan immediately, she should be on her way anyway—”
Harry had the good sense to look slightly embarrassed and take a step back, and although there was still more than enough of it there, Draco could feel the tension in his chest ease a fraction.
to be a snobbish, stuck-up, self-important twat? That I’ve…changed?”
Immediately, Draco’s eyebrows went up. “
to hate you. I
Narcissa might claim she was disappointed, but Draco could find nothing but smug self-satisfaction smeared across his mother’s perfectly wrinkle-free face. And as he finally chanced a glance to where Harry still stood beside him, all hints of the Gryffindor’s previous humiliation gone and replaced instead by a disgustingly endearing beam that only brightened when he caught Draco looking—well.
He was rudely silenced by a pair of warm, soft lips on his. Except Draco really didn’t mind, quite the contrary, and so within a fraction of a second he was kissing back, the words that had been previously on the tip of his tongue vanished into thin air, out of sight and out of mind.
But Yaxley simply snorted and tightened his grip on Draco. “You know what, Mr. Potter, I think I’m going to have to decline. Appreciate your gracious offer as I may, I’d much rather stay and watch you panic. Can’t save everyone, I’m afraid.” He altered his grip on Draco, shifting his hand so it curled directly above the cut, eliciting a pained cry from Draco. “It’s Moonroot, in case you were wondering. Lovely little flower, one of my all-time favourites.”
He only half-listened to the conversation after that, which flowed easily from the topic of wardrobe to Hogwarts to which Celestina Warbeck song was the most excruciating, and then in some bizarre turn of events to which BTS album was the best, at which point Draco completely lost the thread. But watching Harry so vehemently defend Love Yourself: Answer (which Draco had never heard of in his life but figured was a nice enough title), eyes shining with that same fire Draco knew and loved, he didn’t mind not being able to contribute anything to the discussion himself.
This time Hermione answered. “We’re thinking of a spring wedding. Winter’s too cold, obviously, and there's still far too much planning to get through to host it this autumn. Plus, I’d love to hold the ceremony outdoors, so the weather has to be perfect. Perhaps May.”
The Slytherin’s narrowed eyes never left Nic once as he snapped, “He didn’t get any letters because this entire building is
A flicker of something Harry couldn’t place flashed in Draco’s eyes, but then it was gone again, and the Slytherin simply grinned back. “You wish, Potter.”
Draco couldn’t help but stare at Potter incredulously. Because while being compared to Severus Snape could be interpreted in two very conflicting directions, that last part…it had been a
Harry said “No, it’s fine” at the same time as Draco bit out “Yes, that would be lovely”.
this one—‘one great big monumental screwup in all aspects of life’. Yet in reality the most hurtful thing Malfoy had called him so far was an annoying Gryffindork with no style whatsoever, and even that he’d paraphrased.
No one spoke for a long moment. Ron was gaping unabashedly, as was Parvati, if in a slightly less shameless manner. Lavender just looked stunned, and Hermione had the oddest expression on her face, something halfway between shock and very Hermione-esque rumination.
Draco knew he didn’t mean it callously, knew it wasn’t an accusation, knew he was just stating a simple fact, and yet the words still triggered another wave of rage within him.
. You think
Draco shook his head slightly. No, the former. Definitely the former.
It was beautiful, and Harry was touched by the thought that had so obviously flowed into Nic’s choice of eatery. Harry doubted he’d have ever discovered the place alone, doubted any of his friends would frequent such an evidently posh restaurant, save for Draco of cour—
Draco gritted his teeth harder, but with the immense surge of pain currently churning and writhing in his stomach, all he could think was that, for the first time all day, the bastard had a point.
“Well, of course you’re still recovering, silly,” said Luna, but her tone didn’t hold its usual carefree cheer. Nor did her face, Harry was alarmed to see; his friend’s expression was pinched and drawn, none of her usual buoyancy in sight. “You need to rest, Harry. Even the Wrackspurts are keeping well away from you right now, and that’s never a good sign.”
Harry blinked, utterly stunned.
Draco blinked in confusion. It wasn’t that he’d ever thought of Harry as some wild, out-of-control drunk. But…he was a
But the tiring-of-this-whole-bodyguard-business—
That certainly didn’t stop him from cooing, “Oh, look at that. So sorry, I amend my statement; we aren’t going anywhere,
All of a sudden, Harry started to draw back again, panting ever so slightly. And although Draco’s own lungs were screaming for air, chest tight, head a spinning, reeling mess, the abrupt conclusion to their kiss sent a pang of protest through his entire body. His hands reached out before he could even formulate the thought to do so, fisting around the Gryffindor’s shirt and crashing their lips back together.
“You should go to St. Mungo’s,” Jennings said, looking genuinely concerned now, which only vexed Draco further. “Maybe that maniac hit you with a curse after all, and it’s only now taking effect.”
find that so hard to believe?” Malfoy’s lips pursed. “I do possess a shred of human decency, you know, even if it may sometimes be obscured by my pitch-black heart.” He said it with a heavy dose of sarcasm, but Harry for some reason wasn’t bothered.
Draco sent him a deadpan look and said wryly, “Gee, Harry, I don’t know. Make a wild guess, will you?”
“And were there any other escaped convicts tied into this unknown person’s plans? Were you in contact with any of your former associates?”
of you. The two of you have been dancing around each other for ages now, it’s actually rather ridiculous. Harry was borderline obsessed with you for years, Draco. Sixth Year was the worst, he couldn’t stop talking about you. It was always Malfoy this, Malfoy that, and by winter he was practically stalking you—”
It was too much.
Ron, too, winced ever so slightly. But then he nodded, eyes resolutely trained on his clasped hands. “Right, okay. So…Harry. Mate. Look, you should know you’re my best friend. Completely and totally, without a doubt. Honestly, you’re practically family. A brother, if you will.”
Fuck, Pansy was right; he was so smitten, it was downright repulsive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry,” said Weasley, sounding a bit dazed. Merlin and Morgana, had
“Before you ask, no one knows exactly what happened,” came Blaise’s wrongly calm voice, sounding unnaturally disembodied. “He was with at the Weasleys’ shop in Diagon. Weasley—Ronald, that is—had to babysit his nephew seeing as his brother’s wife is currently somewhere in this very hospital giving birth. Apparently, Harry insisted he come along. As per Weasley’s account, he went out to get some fresh air a few minutes after George and Angelina Disapparated.”
“No. Listen.”
It was all very odd indeed.
“Great. Terrific. Fan-fucking-tastic.” He choked out another laugh. “By the way, where’re Weasley and Granger? Don’t tell me you sent them away when Hayes got here? You know, usually I’d say that was incredibly daft of you, seeing as you could’ve been murdered at any given point. But, honestly, it’s rather brilliant, isn’t it, when you think about it? That way, with them gone and me at the Ministry, you finally got to spend some quality alone time with your
Draco only realised he’d been tapping his spoon on the rim of his teacup when Blaise reached across the table for the cup and slowly, cautiously pried it from Draco’s iron grip, gently returning it to its hummingbirds-and-roses-embossed saucer, all the while never breaking eye contact.
So I've been asked a few times how long this fic is going to be. The plan is a total of about 25-30 chapters, probably closer to 30, maybe even a few more. I know this answer is incredibly vague, and I apologise for that, but I just genuinely don't know xD. These characters have a mind of their own, and don't even get me started on the story line...
Now, Harry had always prided himself on his ability to forgive. He had forgiven Dumbledore for always hiding things, for keeping important information from him, for lying, why, even for ‘raising him like a pig for slaughter’, as Snape had once so poetically phrased it. Hell, Harry’d even forgiven
Ron looked at Draco, as though only now noticing his presence, and immediately his eyebrows lifted, whether due to the Slytherin’s casual clothing (a green jumper and trousers, although the trousers were still categorically posh) or just in simple shock of seeing Draco Malfoy sitting at Harry’s kitchen counter with a mug of coffee. And Harry loved his best mate, really, he did, but now was decidedly
a good sign. And the dark spots still wouldn’t leave his vision—as a matter of fact, they might even be multiplying—no matter how often and forcibly he blinked.
“So?” Harry would
Weasley nodded curtly, seemingly satisfied with that answer.
For the millionth time, Draco found himself wondering how a person could look so utterly stunning in a worn t-shirt and a faded, grey pair of sweatpants. Not to mention the state of Harry’s hair; it was, if possible, even more of a mess than usual, looking as though he’d only just rolled out of bed. Which, in all honesty, likely wasn’t far from the truth.
The moment he’d reached the door and stepped outside into the refreshingly cool night air, he nearly collapsed onto the cobbled path of Diagon Alley. There were only a few people still out, none of which, luckily, paid him any attention at all, likely mistaking him for yet another freshly minted adult who’d had just a few pints too many.
Draco blinked, and just like that all his irritation was gone in a puff of smoke. “I sure hope you didn’t just suggest Ginevra Weasley could ever outshine me.”
But Draco was done playing defensive; he hadn’t been second in his training level for nothing.
Harry gaped.
“Shut your mouth, Malfoy,” the She-Weasel growled, and judging by the closeness of the words she was standing right beside him, wand no doubt drawn.
And suddenly Draco was smiling. He was smiling so hard it was more of a beam than anything, the sort that lit up not only his entire face, but the entire room, and it made his eyes twinkle like a million crushed diamonds, making it impossible for Harry to look away even had he wanted to—which he decidedly did not.
at home. And albino ones, too. Honestly, be any more of a pretentious toff, will you?”
The flames reared up one last time before dying down completely, and silence engulfed the flat again, and Harry knew if he went into the living room now, Draco would be long gone.
, with such pure affection it made his heart feel like bursting.
Yes, he fucking was! All the more reason to be the one to destroy Yaxley once and for all!
Suddenly, there was a muffled crash, and Draco whirled around towards the origin of the sound—a door on the far side of the hallway, slightly ajar.
The exhaustion-induced-dream-idea was seeming more and more probable to Harry with every word out of the Slytherin’s mouth, only he was also fairly certain he wasn’t dreaming at all. No, even in sleep, his brain wasn’t near imaginative enough to dream
Hermione was right—no more half-truces.
Three words, one name.
And, lemme tell y'all.
“Surely those can be run at some other time? Mr. Potter looks to be in a good enough state, and if he needs to speak with Auror Malfoy, he should be allowed to, don’t you think? I’m sure it’s urgent.”
The corners of Draco’s mouth twitched ever so slightly, and he shook his head, eyes never leaving Harry’s. “You’re just so bloody beautiful.”
Harry’s eyes widened impossibly, and with his gaping mouth, he knew he was sure to look utterly ridiculous. But he didn’t care. “That really was you, then? You found me?”
? Really? Everything is so…so
“If I’m redirecting the subject, Malfoy, what are
Harry, of course, was the first to break the pregnant silence. “Nic?”
A soft smile reappeared on Blaise’s face. “Yes. Granted, she didn’t stay more than an hour, but were it not for everyone else being here, she’d have remained by your bedside all night. She really loves you, Draco. We all do. And I’m glad you and Potter are getting along, just…be careful, okay?”
“Getting you out of here,” was Draco’s only answer. “Can’t say I didn’t warn you.”
Malfoy didn’t look impressed. He crossed his arms. “Yes. So you said.”
He didn’t miss Blaise frowning slightly from where he still stood by Draco’s bed, dark eyes fixed on the cursive letters peeking out from under the fingers of Draco’s left hand. “He was here, by the way. Potter, I mean. Stayed the entire night in that chair right by the door.” He pointed at a particularly uncomfortable-looking chair, and Draco’s heart missed a beat.
Because if something ever happened to that man, with his soft smiles and twinkling eyes and horrible case of bedhead—Draco would never ever
And so, he swallowed hard, and averted his gaze, and said in a strangled, broken sort of whisper that would have his forefathers turning in their graves, “No, you’re not.”
“Here?” he said, although it came out as more of a squeak than anything, so Draco cleared his throat and tried again. “Harry Potter stayed in that chair…all night?”
Which meant Draco’s goal first and foremost needed to be putting as much distance as at all possible between the attacker and the Boy Who Lived, and who, if Draco had any say in the matter, would
“Oh. Err, yes. Of course,” said Nic, his enthusiasm restricted, to say the least. “Malfoy. Draco. My behaviour was inconsiderate. The things I said… They weren’t fair to you, nor were they true. I, uhm. Well.” He gave a weak little laugh, evidently uncomfortable. Harry couldn’t blame him. “This is awkward. I know this isn’t much of an explanation, and certainly not a good justification. But. It was a hard day for me, Tuesday.”
, no wonder Nic wasn’t glad to see him. Harry felt like facepalming. Draco was right, he truly was a blind, insensitive moron.
as new yet.”
“Well, go on then,” he said. “Off you go. After all, wouldn’t want to keep your
“No, Malfoy, it’s not different at all,” the Gryffindor said heatedly. “I’m allowed to react like this. In fact,
Nic nodded, and although he didn’t look particularly pleased, Harry didn’t get the impression he was incredibly angry either, so he fully counted it as a win.
And so he simply stepped forward and draped his arms around the blond, pulling him into a tight hug. “Whatever happens, we’ll manage. Remember, we endure—you said so yourself. Right?”
Harry smiled at his best mate. God, this was why he loved Ron so much. He was a bloody lifesaver. “It’s fine.
Draco turned the page, not even glancing up at Harry. “Just because you’re about as transparent as an Invisibility Cloak doesn’t mean the rest of us have to be, too. But don’t worry your pretty little head about it—every proper pureblood knows how to fake a smile. It’s a necessary skill. Trust me.”
They stood there for a long, long moment, hands still clasped in between them, Draco’s disaster of a baking attempt in ruins all around them, the flat incredibly silent and still all of a sudden. Harry could hear his own heart beating in his ears, could feel it pick up on speed, and all the while he couldn’t stop staring into Draco’s eyes. He’d always thought they were stormy grey, like his father’s, always clouded with some sort of hateful emotion that could darken them to pitch-black in a split-second if the situation necessitated it. Yet Draco’s eyes were not his father’s at all—they were his own, two rings of the purest molten silver, piercing and radiant and beautiful.
They just stood there in silence for an instant, and as Draco studied Granger closer, as he watched her so resolutely
Draco dropped one hand to the doorknob, the other locked firmly around his wand.
“So, Potter,” said Blaise, and Draco already knew by his smooth tone that whatever came next would not be in his favour. “We’re all curious—the Prophet’s been uncharacteristically sparse about further details on your soulmark, and although I imagine that’s due to the fact that you’ve practically been under house arrest this past week, I can’t help but wonder: any juicy gossip?”
Draco shot him a death-glare. “Not the point. The point is, before I know he feels the same or similar, I can’t and I won’t take any unnecessary risks. I’m not going to ruin this. He needs me.”
The waitress nodded curtly and left to go attend to the next table of customers. Silence fell at their table, and it was only then that Draco realized Harry was staring at him oddly. Or rather, gaping.
“You absolute
He pointed up at his left ear and the diamond therein and grinned even wider when Draco’s eyes followed the direction of his finger, settling on the diamond before he even realised what he was doing, and then promptly looked away again as though burned, all the while scowling.
the bad influence here.”
Draco smirked wider. “Can’t, unfortunately. Head Auror’s orders. Not that I wouldn’t love to leave this Gryffindor-themed hellhole…” He ducked just in time to dodge the grape Potter threw his way.
thing to do—and he just completely lost it. He was mostly angry I was going on a date with you, to be honest, and, well. It just shocked me, I guess. I didn’t expect him to be the homophobic type, you know?”
As always, y'all are amazing. Seriously, thank you so much for sticking by this story; we're almost 100k in, with nearly 400 kudos and 200 comments and almost (almost) 10000 hits. You have no idea how grateful I am for every single one of you, y'all are literally the best.
The sight was such a stark contrast to the other day, when Harry had gone on a date with the man and the latter had looked so healthy and radiant under the soft lighting of the restaurant, that Harry momentarily forgot the fact that Nic still had his wand pointed at him.
Draco blinked. “Salazar.” He shook his head, and his expression was a strange mixture of emotions, none of which Harry could decipher. “Okay. Alright. I’ll just…try to explain it all.” The Slytherin looked back up at Harry, eyes narrowed as he studied him. “And you really know nothing?”
And then the git had just
“Mother!” he hissed, betrayed.
Weasley blinked, as though trying to find the hidden insult in Blaise’s unruffled words. Beside him, Granger repeated, voice far more high-pitched and squeaky than Draco remembered it being, “Where’s Harry? Is he alright? What happened? All the Welcome Witch would tell us is that he was…that he was poisoned.” Her voice cracked at that last word, and Draco felt an unfamiliar surge of empathy for his former muggle-born classmate.
, and dug through his pocket for his wand, heartbeat all the while filling his ears. Finally, Draco found it, and he spelled the door open and stumbled outside and didn’t look back, didn’t glance over his shoulder to see Yaxley watching him with that same deranged, sharp,
An ice-cold shiver ran down the length of Draco’s spine.
Once it was time to finally leave, Harry had said goodbye to his friends, hugging Lavender, Neville and Luna farewell, seeing as all three of them had flights to catch and would likely not manage to return to Britain any time soon. Ron had been busy glowering at Malfoy throughout it all, who, true to his word, had kept his distance, leaving Harry the privacy he’d promised that morning.
. Look at me.”
But before he could, Nic, smiling at Draco as though they were lifelong friends, said merrily, “No problem. We already finished up.”
“My stomach,” he bit out. “Hence why I’m currently hunched over on this bed like Pansy during her period.”
And just like that, Harry found himself promptly reminded why exactly it was he hated the Slytherin’s pointy sodding face.
They stood in a narrow, deserted corridor somewhere on the first floor, and the Slytherin hadn’t seen another person since they’d exited the elevator. And yet it was only then that it hit Draco how very alone they currently were, and he could feel his heartrate speed up despite himself.
Draco promptly stopped worrying about his blush. He tried to suppress his panic but failed. “My—” Fuck, why was his voice suddenly so squeaky? “What about it, Potter? We agreed, no meddling.”
And Draco could simply not allow that.
“Such a shame. Truly.” A pause. “Obliviate.”
And then they were full-out snogging again, just as fiercely, just as spellbindingly as they had the evening before, and it left Draco’s mind a wreck, an unsalvageable, wonderful wreck full of joy and excitement and love—so, so much love, except that was the one thing he couldn’t let Harry see, not yet, not when all of this was so new.
He had
Harry wanted to laugh. What came out instead, however, was more of a smothered choke, and Ron gave him an alarmed look.
, now he’d gone and done it. He’d acted like a moron in front of Potter, blushing and panicking at the slightest hint of trouble, and now Potter fucking
As promised, two chapters today!
Draco brought the steaming mug to his lips and took a long, deep sip of his newly prepared chamomile tea, burning his tongue but not caring in the slightest. He hated the stuff, always had, but his mother used to say chamomile tea helped relieve stress and reduce anxiety, both of which he could really bloody use right about now.
. Give it another two or three days and you might just get your wish after all.”
Harry hated it, because he wanted that ‘someone’ to be
Yaxley ignored this and continued, “You’ve surprised me this past week, and yet I’m almost confident the question you truly want to ask me would not. Think of me what you will, Draco, but the Dark Lord valued me for a reason. I can read people, you know, better than most others, and I have read you, and I think you and I both know what it is I discovered.”
Harry smiled. “Understood.”
All the while, Malfoy had stood a few steps behind Harry, arms crossed, an amused little twinkle in his grey eyes as he’d silently watched Harry be bombarded. Harry had glared at him in response. However, said glare held strong for the totality of about two seconds, before it dissolved at the grin Malfoy shot back.
But, right now, the Healer-in-training didn’t seem to find Draco’s comment at all amusing. As a matter of fact, his expression grew, if possible, even more grave.
“It’s because I cherish it that I’ve had such a hard time telling you what I’m about to say. I don’t want to ruin this—that’s the last thing I want—so this considerably more complicated than I might like.” Draco took a deep breath. Closed his eyes. Exhaled. And when those silver eyes opened again, they were drilling into Harry’s.
Instead, Draco simply planted another kiss on Harry’s mouth. “Of anything, really.”
When a few long seconds later Harry finally noticed they were no longer alone in the kitchen, his eyes went almost as wide as Weasley’s and he gasped and jumped backwards. Or he would have, were his mouth not still pressed against Draco’s and his escape route not effectively blocked by the kitchen counter.
Draco Malfoy was not a morning person. That was a truth one could always rely on, for it was as much a fact of life as the earth orbiting around the sun or eleven-year-old witches and wizards getting their acceptance letters to Hogwarts.
Harry shook his head. “I didn’t, sorry.”
The next time Harry glanced back over at Draco, the blond was no longer smiling.
guard Harry! He’d murder Harry himself before defending him against some bloodthirsty killer.”
Harry sat there, wordlessly watching him, for a long moment, before standing again, picking up the basket of beignets, and taking them into the kitchen. The beignets were perfectly golden, and they smelled divine. Tasted divine, too Harry found once he’d fished one out to try.
And yet, when he awoke on Tuesday morning, he awoke smiling—and that, in all the twenty years of mornings he’d experienced thus far in his life, was a definite first.
Screaming and shrieking and howling like someone had set him on fire, writhing on the floor, face contorted not with rage or hatred, but with pure, utter agony. And all Draco could do was watch, stunned, unable to move as though he were the one bound and trapped.
But Weasley frowned. “You can’t go
It had taken a lot of consideration and weighing up of options, but in the end, Draco had decided he would not hide in the shadows for the rest of his life. It was what the world expected him to do, to lock himself up in Malfoy Manor and be silently grateful he’d escaped the fate of his father. And perhaps he would have, were it not for his mother.
Draco loosened a sigh. “Not any more so than she’s been these past three years, I suppose. She says she’s fine, and that I needn’t worry, that she’d tell me if something were the matter. Only…well, I still worry, don’t I? A part of me feels like I should be at the Manor with her, just in case. But then again, there’s nothing I
“Sir?” he tried one last time, voice rising. “Head Auror Robards?”
“I said we’re
Yes, Harry had invited Ginny. Of course he had. They were still friends after all, even after their breakup. Plus, Ron would have probably murdered him had he not; Ron was a great best mate, yes, but even that wouldn’t save Harry from the wrath of an older brother if Harry decided to completely sever ties with Ginny.
“I really am liking this new Potter,” Pansy said then with a shit-eating grin. “He says what we’re all thinking, only with the added benefit of not getting his head bitten off by Draco dearest when he does.”
Draco held up a hand, effectively silencing the rambling Gryffindor. “It’s fine. No need to explain yourself. Constant vigilance and all that, I understand. Besides—” Draco gave Harry his best Slytherin smirk. “—I happen to like Butterbeer a lot, for your information.”
where there had been nothing but bare skin the day before. And, though unlikely, there were many ways he might accidentally find out Draco sported his name. And, knowing Potter, his reaction to that was bound to be explosive.
Draco came to a staggering stop.
That was certainly an idea.
Blaise’s lips twitched into a frown, and he hesitated before speaking again, as though he couldn’t quite figure out what exactly to say. “No, I don’t mean it like that. I mean—” He gestured vaguely at Draco’s right wrist, hidden as always under the sleeve of his black robes. “—
Draco scowled, any hints of a hypothetical blush gone, thankfully. “Yes. Not that you deserve it, you meddlesome hag.”
“Harry! Oh God, you have no idea how worried we’ve been! I’m so sorry for not having noticed anything at the pub,” she burst out, the bags underneath her eyes visible even with her dark skin. Immediately, she seized his hand, holding it tight as though it were the only thing tethering her to the world. “Had the circumstances been any different, you could have very well died outside in the alley, while we were all inside, chatting like a bunch of oblivious bigmouths, while you were…you were…” She let out a strangled sob, and Harry squeezed her hand as tightly as he could without another fresh wave of pain enveloping him whole.
He looked once more at Yaxley, who was still grinning, and then at Harry—Harry, who was white as a sheet, whose eyes were wider than usual, whose expression was drawn. Draco gritted his teeth.
The others nodded, even Ron. He looked the most confused out of everyone, but still his tone was sincere, if dazed, as he said, “Bloody hell, never thought I’d be saying this, but you really seem like you’ve changed a lot, Malfoy. And in a good way, too. Good on you. I think I’m starting to see why Harry hasn’t hexed you to Scotland and back yet.”
? Did they already lock him up in Azkaban? Or is he at the Ministry, being interrogated?”
Draco scowled, and Harry nearly opened his mouth to admonish the blond. However, he promptly stopped himself. Had Harry gone through with it, that was something neither Draco nor his friends would likely ever let him live down. And he’d survived enough awkwardness for one day, thank you very much.
He regretted it instantly when Blaise’s eyes clouded with pity.
Not that he’d had anything worthwhile to confess.
It wasn’t supposed to have progressed this far already. Merlin’s beard, Harry didn’t even have his full soulmark yet. He didn’t know Draco’s wrist bore his name, didn’t know why it was they were always so in tune with each other’s emotions. It shouldn’t be possible, didn’t make any sense—
“It always has to be a competition with you, doesn’t it?”
,” said Ron, and Harry was glad, if slightly confused, to see the excited twinkle in his best friend’s eyes. “You won’t believe what just happened over at the office. There was a sighting of Yaxley over in Knockturn Alley!”
Draco studied the hand critically for another long moment, and Harry felt tempted to simply seize him by the shoulders and pull him up. But he controlled himself, instead waiting more or less patiently for Draco to take his hand.
!” The sheer exasperation in Draco’s tone and the huff he made promptly thereafter were enough to catch Harry completely off balance. “You don’t think it’s in the least bit odd he sent those ‘apology’ letters not to me, but to you? Or that he wouldn’t have thought to apologize to me in the first place if you hadn’t directly told him to? Or, I don’t know, the fact he was practically
Harry furrowed his brows, confused, and strained his neck to see what the fuss was about—only to do a double-take, blinking repeatedly just to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.
But then all of a sudden she perked up again, eyes bright as they focused on something behind Harry, disgust gone in the blink of an eye as though it had never existed in the first place. “Ooh, is that chocolate?
The Girl-Weasel’s jaw was clenched hard. She looked at him long and hard, all the while silent, and Draco wondered whether he’d done it, whether he’d pushed her so far she’d actually yell at him now in front of her friends.
,” he said again, this time nothing more than a tortured groan. He didn’t dare glance over to where Harry stood, silently watching the scene unfold—probably grinning like a moron.
Why? Relationships were tough—that was the truth, plain and simple. They weren’t always pretty. They were a lot—as in
At this, Draco looked up again, blond eyebrows furrowed. “
He swallowed, and, despite the anger still glinting in Harry’s eyes, took a step forwards, right hand outstretched for the other’s arm. “Harry. Harry,
backwards, because in all his wise foresight, Harry had completely forgotten to put away the rug, as well, and now he was paying the price for it.
The attention was nothing unusual anymore—no, although it still irked him plenty, he’d gotten used to it. But this wasn’t the usual ‘Oh look, it’s Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Savior of the wizarding world’ sort of attention. It was ‘Oh look, it’s Harry Potter, I wonder who his soulmate is’. And for some reason the latter bothered him a lot more than the former.
But he didn’t ask that, because Draco looked genuinely nervous, skin a shade paler than usual, long fingers clutching the coffee mug like a lifeline, eyes trained resolutely on the kitchen counter. And Harry’s heart thawed a bit and he said sincerely, “Of course you can, Draco. I already told you: anything you want to talk about, anything at all, I won’t judge.”
Harry scoffed. “Didn't mean to what? Insulting muggleborns, acting all superior,
Harry blinked. “What?”
But even though silence once again descended upon the two friends, the awkwardness from before was gone, vanished in a puff of smoke as though it had never existed in the first place.
“Mione,” he said. “It’s not your fault, understood? I’m fine. It’s all fine.”
, than betray his master—that was what Draco associated that twisting feeling in his chest with. The anger it accompanied, and the despair, the misery, the
Harry wasn’t so sure about that. He couldn’t be mad at Hermione or fault her for simplifying matters just because her situation had been so, well,
Then the American nodded. “Well, um, good for you, I suppose.”
Potter—who sat on the opposite side of the table, currently busy lathering his own piece of toast with what, at any other point in time, Draco would have called him out for as a truly obtuse amount of jam—shot Draco an alarmed look as the Slytherin proceeded to have a coughing fit nearly as awful as the one Potter had had in that alley the other night. Only, of course, minus the blood.
He turned back to Nic, who was still seated where Harry’d left him moments before, looking a mixture of alarmed, cross and just flat-out confused as he looked from Harry to Draco and back.
“No Thai, then, I take it?”
And that last part reminded Draco so starkly of what Yaxley had said that he felt like sobbing.
Now he rather wished he hadn’t.
Harry whirled around as a crash sounded from the living room, promptly followed by a string of curses much like the ones Draco had been muttering earlier—only the voice muttering them now was a lot higher and feminine.
Draco scowled, mumbling something under his breath. “
stay cooped up in his flat all week, murderer or no. Otherwise, he’d go mad himself. “We’ll both go. With you and the other Aurors right there with me, no one’ll dare attack.”
“That’s why, back when you and Ginny started dating, I was so…reluctant,” Ron continued. “The idea of you, my brother, dating Ginny, my sister, was weird, to put it mildly. You two were good for each other, I suppose, and Ginny really loved you, might even still—”
Silence.
When Draco’s feet launched into what could only be some sort of particularly fast-paced jig—Seamus would have been proud—Harry gave a whistle. “Hell yeah! Rock it, Malfoy!”
“Are you going to ask me your question, Draco?” Yaxley asked, and the mere sound of his voice, the oily, rustling hiss of it, the smile coating his tone thicker even than the chill—well, it made Draco want to do something very, very stupid.
And, okay, Harry probably shouldn’t take so much pleasure in watching Draco splutter, in watching the Slytherin’s usually so composed, pale face go beetroot red, poise and serenity forgotten. But he did. Sue him.
When his hands came away from his mouth, under the silver light of the moon, Harry looked in horror down at the red blood now staining his fingers.
Healer Hodkinson’s mouth thinned into a grim line, and with his lips already being extremely thin as it was, they suddenly looked almost non-existent.
He must have been alerted by Ginny’s shouting. Usually Harry would be grateful for his soulmate’s presence, if only as emotional backup, but all it took was one glance in between the Slytherin and the youngest Weasley and he knew proverbial shit was about to hit the fan. Ginny had never thought very highly of Draco, Harry knew that, and the latter barely ever concealed the particularly strong dislike he in turn harboured for her.
When addressed again by Harry, the man’s humongous grin returned again, which he promptly fixed on Harry and said, “Oh, that’s a hard one. I think I like Hufflepuff a lot. They seem like a nice bunch. Plus, their common rooms are down near the kitchen, which means you can always get a midnight snack should the desire arise. Other than that, though, I think Gryffindor would be cool, too. Don’t think I’m smart enough for Ravenclaw, though.”
For Draco had known from the moment Lucius was found guilty for his crimes and sentenced to a life sentence in Azkaban that the future would not be easy on him, but most of all, it would not be easy on Narcissa. Without his father, the hallways in Malfoy Manor were too quiet, and the whole house was more of a hollow shell than an actual home, unseeable ghosts and memories haunting every nook and cranny. Draco had never in his life known Narcissa Malfoy to be afraid, not of anything—for the longest time, she’d been the bravest person he knew, not even intimidated by Voldemort himself when he was living under her own roof. But now, with Lucius gone and the war having ended so abruptly, she was looking more frazzled every day, the perfectly put-together Lady Malfoy suddenly seeming a lot less unbreakable and a lot more broken.
"And then I'd reward you by fucking you. Fucked you on this sofa that one night. You rode me and I watched that fantastic view of you fucking yourself on my cock, goddamn fuck yes! Touch yourself, yeah, just like what I'm doing..."
"What?"
Quidditch players that Harry didn't even know were gay; and some businessmen that Harry knew by face but not by name. Harry looks towards the stage and squints at the snakes wrapped around the strippers. He recognises all three snakes, according to Bacon's descriptions and what the Aurors have seen during their previous raids.
Malfoy chuckles, a low and throaty sound, eyes glinting at the challenge. "Oh, I will."
Harry shakes himself out of that salacious memory and stares at Pork Chop, incredulous.
Malfoy scowls at Harry, his reticent countenance snapping back into place. "I don't know what you're talking about." Without waiting for Harry to react, he gets up and hurries away.
Potter hushes him. "I'm scared too, silly. I feel so strongly for you, and I…” He sighs. “Don't run away again, if things get difficult. Don't leave me like how you did seven years ago, wondering and worrying about you." He threads his fingers into Draco’s hair. "Is it selfish of me to want to keep you all to myself for summer, shelter you from everyone else, even your mother and Parkinson?" he asks, taking Draco's hand and kissing each knuckle tenderly.
Pride and affection surges through him.
"Harry," Draco whispers, overcome with emotion. Potter's given name feels strange and clunky on his tongue, but maybe, just maybe, he'll have many chances to get used to saying it.
Harry laughs indulgently. "Yeah, you heard right. I love how your mouth looks when it's wrapped around my cock." He repeats again, this time much louder and clearer.
what they want. You'll be dancing with a snake, and what best to have a snake as a coach! When you've improved, I'll dance with you." An encouraging nod accompanies those words. Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, feeling briefly confused when his fingers don't stumble on his glasses like they usually do.
Even though it is Harry's own monotonous voice echoing in the classroom, it doesn't feel as if it's coming from him. He hangs his head in resignation, dull eyes trained on Malfoy's shoes. It’s easier to say this when he’s not looking at his face. He feels numb, as if he’s lost control of everything.
Harry's half-hard cock twitches.
“See ya around,” he replies with an easy smile.
He checks out Nowaki as he walks to Ayumi to order his usual caramel macchiato. He's fit, with a stocky build, strong biceps and well-shaped shoulder blades shifting under his white T-shirt when he rests his arms on the counter.
“Sorry, if I got that wrong,” Harry says.
"Yeah, but when Ron and I are finished with this case and once you're finished with the Anderson deal, things'll be better," Harry points out. Although his tone is matter-of-fact, his hands tighten over Draco's.
“I should go,” Draco mutters. His rational mind finally catching up — there ought to be rules about fraternising within the faculty — he wraps his arms around himself and quickly shuffles away from Potter.
As the kitchens were the warmest rooms in the entire manor, Draco and his mother spent an inordinate amount of time in there, and together, they made proper traditional desserts: buttery scones, bread and butter pudding, sponge cakes and assorted tarts and buns.
"Glad you like it," Draco says with a wry grin. He stands up and begins to clear the table.
"Malfoy..." Potter mutters, his voice low in warning and his hand inching towards his wand.
Potter grabs his hand, and Draco doesn't pull away.
you fucking
All of Harry's warmth vanishes like illusions scattering in a gust of wind.
Harry is left staring at Malfoy's closed door.
Draco had to hold the kitchen counter for support, while beside him, Harry's jaw dropped.
— at him. He knows Harry is close, so close, the tendons on his neck are standing out like cords, his face crumpling with pleasure, his eyes rolling into the back of his head, sweat matting his hair, Draco will never forget this sight for the rest of his life: he was the one who made Harry Potter come without touching his cock. Three more brutal thrusts, and Harry's roaring Draco's name as he comes so
Besides, Harry owes Malfoy breakfast the morning
“You’re his son!” Harry shrieks so loud that his words reverberate around them in the cold night sky and all around the mountains surrounding them. He hangs his head. “How could I… how could we…”
"Er." Harry peers at both ends of the corridor. "I think I'm lost," he says, feeling very much like a first-year.
Harry feels a surge of triumph coursing in him. "I guess I won, didn't I?"
Draco looks up when Potter approaches, his tray of inks floating in the air behind him. He sits down on a wheelie chair and arranges his tattooing paraphernalia—tattoo machines, alcohol wipes, ointments, plastic wrap and other inks—on the table. He pulls on surgical gloves and asks Draco, "How are you feeling?"
Harry blinks. "C'mon. I can't crash the wedding," he says, trying to inject a breezy tone into his voice and failing miserably.
Harry groans and rolls over, away from the window. "Ron... why is it so bloody sunny?"
Potter brightens. "D'you really want that? It'd save me the trouble of telling everyone separately. I could tell my Magpies mates, my Hogwarts friends and the Weasleys together! That'd be brilliant.”
Luckily, Harry is saved from answering when a customer calls for her, and he uses this chance to discreetly shrink his sketchbook and slip it into the back pocket of his jeans. Someone clears his throat beside him — it’s Malfoy. He places an empty wine glass on the bar. “Still here?” He sweeps Harry’s surroundings with a searching eye. “What were you doing? I saw you writing something.”
"Messy?" Draco suggests, gesturing to his chest. His voice is all ragged, and a thrill sparks in Harry when he realises he — or more specifically, his cock — was the one that caused that.
His letter said 7 pm.
Encouraging him to do what, he has no bloody idea.
After a moment, Malfoy finds the spell to put an end to the cloud. Harry looks up.
Malfoy laughs, a thin and reedy sound. "Deciding if I should just vanish off the face of the earth. I never expected to have my sexuality and the tatters of my wedding splashed over the gossip rags." He stiffens. "I have to salvage it.” He picks up a framed photograph of him and Greengrass laughing and grinning, the towering La Sagrada Familia behind them. “I have to go back.”
Despite the painful twinge in his heart, Harry plays his part well, falling into his lines like clockwork. "I hate you more, Malfoy!"
Hermione turns to Parkinson. "Are we going to come up with a plan?"
"Well, it's us," Harry points out, as if that answers everything.
Potter sighs, before visibly collecting himself and grabbing his broom, treading alongside Draco as they make their way to Minerva's chambers. Draco refreshes Potter's warming and drying charms, eliciting a grateful smile. He offers his chips to Potter, who thanks him and grabs a handful. They walk in silence; it's clear Potter is not in the mood for conversation.
He finishes his food, deep in thought. Potter's fantastic in bed, makes a mean breakfast, he's considerate... various adjectives pop up in Draco's mind when he thinks of Potter as a... a what? A... boyfriend? Someone to fuck? Somewhere in between? Before this whole
"Don't worry, I'll get him back," he promises and hurries out. It doesn't take him long to enter the Ministry, ignoring the whispers and stares as he rides the lift up to the Auror offices. With each step, terrible images of Malfoy — Malfoy shivering in Azkaban, all alone without his chocolate; being held in cold, sterile rooms for questioning — tumble through Harry's mind. He has to clear this up, because Malfoy's entirely innocent! With that thought adding fuel to the fire, his footsteps quicken, and he's practically running to Andrew's office. He yanks the door open, sees Andrew and Malfoy together, and before he registers the scene in front of him, he's ranting and raving away-
“Scarhead,” Malfoy whispers affectionately, rolling onto his side to face Harry.
, Potter! I bare my body for strangers to drool over. Hardly a respectable profession for the last Malfoy heir."
Ron pales when Harry confirms his guess. "You can't mean..." He gestures to the table. "Here? Where we eat every day?!”
He hurries towards the dorms, propelled by self-righteous anger and painful heartbreak. Just the thought of parting ways, of not touching Malfoy again, of someone else in bed with him, giving him all the pleasure in the world when his pleasure is only for Harry to give…
," Harry says in disbelief, his eyes round with astonishment. "I can't believe... I didn't know you
Harry is whistling along to the tune, his right foot tapping to the beat of the song while he ferrets around in the fridge. With his arms full of containers and packets of meat, he shuts the door with his hip. Draco watches as he moves around the kitchen with ease, emanating a graceful confidence that Draco hasn’t noticed before. Just watching Harry work in the kitchen is strangely comforting, and if Draco is being honest, it's nice to have someone around.
like a dirty word — "chocolate in here and rub it in your face that he's better than you?!"
Hanging on the walls are eleven completed paintings, and the only human in most of them is a pale, tall and blond man, his face not drawn in sharp focus to conceal his identity.
“I’m so sorry,” she says. She loosens her chignon, letting her curls tumble over her shoulders. She has dressed up not for Draco, but for Weasley. Her engagement ring sparkles on her finger, but what’s the point of proposing if Weasley’s not going to be around anyway?
"Maybe it’s not the right time," Harry continues. "I only see him when I'm home off-season. I should come over more often, help out with the shop, yeah?"
Draco gritted his teeth and inhaled deep. And then he pushed down on the doorknob, wand raised in front of him, and entered the office.
, but either way he should be relatively safe.”
Harry Potter, and how his ten-year-old daughter had a huge crush on Harry despite having never actually met him before.
How was it Harry had gotten to know Draco better over this past week—to the point that it felt like they’d been friends for decades—than he had during six full years of living in the same castle and seeing each other every day?
Before he could ramble on, there was a flash of silver-blond and then Draco’s arms were around him. Unlike Ron’s earlier bear-hug, though, Draco’s hug was gentle, cautious, and yet no less warm, no less affectionate. More so, even, and Harry found himself momentarily unable to breathe at the sheer intensity of
Harry smiled. “I am. I saw your grilled cheese sandwiches, by the way, Mione. They were great, thanks a lot.”
kicking him out. You obviously weren’t going to do it, you’re too kind, and he wasn’t about to leave of his own accord.” He snorted. “Merlin, do you even
, while Parvati’s showed an
Now, after the whole Nic-fiasco, Draco could readily admit he was perhaps just a tad bit protective. He wouldn’t necessarily say he was ‘the jealous type’, but as Harry’s boyfriend—Salazar, the word still felt surreal, even in his head—he reckoned he was allowed at least a little overprotectiveness.
“Yes,” the Slytherin said cautiously, unfurling his legs in a half-hearted effort to look at least partially the dignified Auror he was supposed to be. It sent another surge of pain rolling through him, originating from his stomach-area, but he ignored it and added instead, “Is something the matter?”
Yaxley stopped speaking then.
actually
Harry stopped pacing and looked up at Draco, and the sheer amount of crushing emotion in his green eyes made Draco’s heart twist. “I…,” said the Gryffindor, then hesitated. He shook his head, sending dark curls tumbling into his eyes. “I don’t know.”
what he was to Draco, never would, because even after all this time spent together, even after becoming friends and learning to trust each other, even then Harry couldn’t love him the way Draco wanted—no—
Only, Salazar and Merlin and Morgana, on top of all the stress and dread and tension, Draco simply did not have the
“Best of luck, Mr. Potter. You’ll need it.”
“Oh yes,” Harry said, the reply half-hearted even to his own ears. “That one. Right.”
Draco made to let go of Harry’s hand once he’d gotten up again, lips pursed into that familiar look of poorly-suppressed exasperation. But Harry in turn only gripped the Slytherin’s hand tighter, grinning brightly, and said, “Nope. I thought you’d realised by now, Malfoy; you’re not getting rid of me that easily.”
ought to be the Dark Side; ruling over the galaxy with an iron fist sounds like more of a Slytherin goal.”
“Right,” Draco replied tersely, too drained to muster any sort of cheeriness, fake or not.
A chaotic twenty-something minutes after their arrival at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, Harry stepped outside and took a deep, deep breath, letting his eyes fall shut for an instant as he stood on the cobbled sidewalk outside the shop and enjoyed the calming, soothing feeling of the sun rays on his face.
And with that he half-shooed, half-dragged Nic up from Harry’s armchair and over to the fireplace, where Draco proceeded to more or less gently shove the brunet into the hearth, thrusting a handful of Floo powder into his now-empty hands, all the while still beaming from ear to ear.
Draco lifted an eyebrow. “Is that what you want me to say?”
, even before Blaise spoke again.
Immediately, his mind started racing. There may only be one exit, but if he could get to the fireplace, he might be able to escape the office after all.
“Butterbeer?” he asked. “We’re at a pub, and you’re ordering
Except breathing and everything else suddenly became secondary, trivial, a minor side issue when compared to the situation at hand. When compared to
“I thought you were going to die, you prick,” Draco hissed as he finally drew back again.
Just as Malfoy had promised, Harry was discharged that afternoon. Healer Hodkinson had shoved about ten different potions into his arms before he’d let Harry leave, prattling on and on about how jealous his wife would be when he told her he’d gotten to meet
Harry opened his mouth, still entirely unsure what to say, but certain enough that
And it was all written in the same exact same slanted scrawl of his
Draco went very still indeed. So still, in fact, that he wondered briefly whether his heart was still beating at all. But then there was blood rushing in his ears and the boiling, twisting feeling Draco recognised all too well, recognised it from the day he had stood in front of his father and told him he was done. That he was going to change sides, for he could no longer bare it, fighting for someone who wouldn’t think twice before slaughtering him like an animal, that he was going to defect from the Death Eaters as he should have done from the beginning, that he was leaving, and so was his mother, and Lucius could either join them or stay behind.
Draco’s heart drummed against his ribcage with such urgency he feared it might just burst from the strain. His ears were beginning to ring, and his breath was becoming dangerously sparse. He needed to get out of here, needed to get to Harry, right now, right this instant. That was all he could think, all he could do, and so he staggered to the door, away from Yaxley, away from those
. No need to worry so.”
Likely the most remarkable feature of Head Auror Robards’ office was the fact that it was so utterly unremarkable. It was large, yet cramped; tidy, yet cluttered. The most profound feature of the entire space was the fact that there was not a single personal item in it—no trophies, no souvenirs of long past travels, not even a single picture frame that might indicate the man had a life outside his job.
The sides of Draco’s mouth quirked upwards, which Harry told himself was a good sign. If something had happened between them that he couldn’t remember, something
However, once he’d retrieved the letter, given the barn owl a treat for its troubles, and plopped back down in his armchair, Harry was surprised to find the wax seal of the Head Auror stamped onto the paper, the gold wax catching the sunlight with a twinkle. He was quick to (more or less carefully) open the letter, and once he’d scanned its contents, the day suddenly seemed a lot less boring.
Harry grimaced up at the ceiling, and then immediately felt horrible for doing so.
He sighed to himself and made his way over to the other three Aurors. Potter and he had had to wait at least ten minutes before the other two Aurors arrived—he’d warned Potter his overzealousness would get them exactly nowhere, but had the man listened, bloody Gryffindor that he was? No, of course not!—and when they had arrived a few minutes earlier, it had been Potter and Potter alone they’d approached immediately.
Harry swallowed, mouth feeling strangely dry, and, really, he was just checking to make sure he could have that talk with Draco, the one where he confronted the git for what he’d said, because he was still pissed at him, he was still—
They’d won the war, yes. But, honestly, at what cost?
(See the end of the chapter for
the man, and both those objectives seemed incredibly unmanageable with the pain numbing his brain and the Nic currently looming overhead.
The Slytherin wouldn’t meet his eyes as he spoke, almost as though he was genuinely afraid Harry might be angry at him for keeping it a secret. The notion immediately dispelled whatever small kernel of displeasure Harry might’ve still been holding on to, and he gave Draco’s hand a small reassuring squeeze, smiling gently when their eyes met.
After much protesting, Harry had agreed to stay at the flat—although ‘agreed’ was putting it kindly—safe and secure and watched over by Hermione and Weasley. That was one headache Draco could check off the list.
And then Harry’s world faded to black.
“You? Help me?” The hooded man shook his head. “No, Malfoy, I’m quite sure you’ve done more than enough.”
But now—now, Draco wished he wasn’t. Now he wished he were the worst liar, that he always told the truth, just so he might cling to that hope, just so he wouldn’t have to face the terrifying possibility that Harry might…
But maybe Harry
. I shudder to think how he’ll have influenced you once a full week has passed. Perhaps you’ll be sporting red all the time, hollering Quidditch hymns at the top of your lungs while hanging off the side of the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower.” Blaise sighed dramatically. “If this is how life with a soulmate looks, then count me the hell out.”
Nic laughed, causing a strand of hair to tumble across his forehead, and one moment it was Nic there, with his blue eyes and brown hair and laugh lines, and the next Harry couldn’t help but imagine Draco, sitting across the table in one of his expensive, tailored suits, fitting right in with the remaining clientele, looking regal and elegant with his high cheekbones and charismatic smile and silver twinkling eyes.

kitchen? I thought you said the flat’s as much Draco’s as it is yours. Or did Draco just dream that up?”
the willpower it took him to grit out his next few words. “So, no, she and you don’t fit. Maybe you never did. But Dra—” He stopped midsentence and shook his head, snorting. “Yeah, sorry, nope. Not going to happen. That little ferret will always be Malfoy in my book, even if he is dating my best mate. No offence, of course.”
“Do you believe that?”
“Nothing. He came in, got what he needed, and left.” She cleared her throat and drawled, “Now, that’s really all I can tell you. I’d be glad to offer up my memories of the time frame in question if that’ll get you to leave. As I said, I have customers coming, and I will not have a group of...of
Too. Fucking. Much.
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again, then finally decided on a gentle, cautious, “Everyone dies, Ron.”
Draco chuckled. “Touché. Is that the one, then? Not that I’m not immensely enjoying sitting around with nothing to do, it’s just, you know, I’m really not. And I really did promise Mother—”
A second of silence ticked by, then another. And another, and another.
Enjoy!
The now-youngest Weasley was absolutely adorable. Harry had only briefly met little Roxanne that very morning before she, her mum and her dad left for the Burrow, where Fred had been staying with Molly and Arthur for the past few days. But it hadn’t taken more than a single look at her for Harry’s heart to go warm and his eyes to tear up. And it wasn’t even his fault.
that he’d likely regret it later. And although Pansy and Blaise had helped him through some of the most difficult parts of his life and he was infinitely glad to have them at his side, Draco couldn’t stop thinking that
When Draco stumbled out of the fireplace—not even bothering to dust himself off as he usually would, to righten his tie and smooth out his hair and make sure not to get his dragonhide boots dirty as he stepped over the ashes—the singular, the one and only, the lone most important thought on his mind was of Harry. He needed to see him, to make sure he was alright, to make certain he stayed that way, to—
