A mental image of the severed hand flashes in Harry’s mind. “I can imagine.”
“So other people besides you and your friends had been among those kidnapped?”
“So, what?” Cho says. “We’re just supposed to trust you? After all this?”
“Okay. Then what happened?”
His heartbeat spikes, and his breath catches in his throat as he envisions finally seeing the face attached to the voice that’s antagonized him for so long. But then his traitorous mind pictures the opposite—a situation where Harry’s the one lying defenseless on the ground, and Dracon’s lifting Harry’s mask away.
“Hmm . . . . Well, it certainly is an interesting tactic. And you’re certain that bringing him in will yield the same lack of results as with Blaizing Fire?”
“I heard you talking,” she continued when it became evident Harry would not. “Did you come here to speak to Draco? I often do.”
“What kind of machine?”
A bone-chilling grinding noise comes from behind him.
Thinking about the odd case causes the mechanical arm to drift to the forefront of his mind. Just as he starts wondering if law enforcement handing over that kind of evidence had been tantamount to handing over the entire case to the Hero Order, a memory flashes through him.
you cooperate. So, I’ll ask you again. Would you be willing to help us track down the vampire that bit you?”
The door opens on the third knock, revealing a portly man around Ms. Adams’ height. Sweat decorates his face and mats his black hair to his forehead. “Oh. You’re here.” He blinks at Draco and Potter as though doubting his eyesight. “Come inside, then.”
Dracon is just as Harry remembers him, wearing the same many-pocketed black outfit, paired with two sets of masks.
...............................................
He lets go of Ron without warning and gestures in a placating way when Ginny shouts, “Hey!”
“Well, all right, then.” He leans forward, elbows on his knees. “What would you like to know?”
“Yeah. “Finch-Fletchley bobs his head. “Everything after that went a little crazy. I think attacking the robot made it mad because it then attacked the person who hurt it.”
“Yes. And not flinching away from the sun or anything. Like they—belonged out there.” Potter’s looking at his hands in his lap now, the fingernails longer than Draco remembers them being—before. “I’ve mostly been using Kreacher. To run errands, fetch news, communicate with other people. To tell my friends—or, well, Ron and Hermione. I didn’t want to see them, any of them, after—
............~~*~~..............
“I try to be.” Harry heads for the stairs before the nurse can throw another line at him.
Harry sighs.
“Well, they already broke the Code!” Ron says.
. Pieces torn from the cloth that had covered it stick in its mechanical joints, making it look like a creature dressed in rags.
As much as it’s sure to pain him, Harry powers up. He swallows down his agony and turns his head as much as he can until Paper Dracon is within his sights. “Then why didn’t you?”
As he says it, water pricks at the edges of his eyes, and his mouth stretches in a wide smile that he turns on Paper Dracon.
Stepping out into the pouring rain once more sets a chill deep into his marrow, and he’s nearly overcome with the desire to step back inside. He shakes the feeling off and creeps on his hands and knees to the left side of the roof.
“I didn’t want him to wake up and attack me—which he did! And my second blast hit him accidentally when I was trying to rid myself of his stupid paper swarm,” Harry says.
The Weasley family roof has a small square patio with black rails boxing people in and preventing them from falling. It’s empty when Harry steps out into the night. Stars and a half-moon glitter above in a rare clear sky.
“Yeah. I was hoping to actually get your account of what happened the night of the incident.”
“I’d like to hope not, but you can go check—”
Hermione stills Harry’s jabbing by placing her hand atop his. “Could you tell who he’d been fighting with?”
Harry banishes the thought before it takes root. “You wearing it again?”
look at me! My hands, my teeth, my hair—Merlin only knows what my
an ambush?”
Harry catches the sleeve of his coat—which he must have put on at some point when Harry had been turned away. His periphery vision catches more black further up, and his eyes involuntarily flick up.
The villain tosses back his head, his laugh cruel. He lowers his voice again just so Harry can hear. “You and I both know this is the big leagues. No room for rubbish like you.”
Malfoy’s gaze snapped to Harry.
“Hmm?”
Harry settled on focusing on his eyes, which still sparked with the life of malice, instead of the giant hole at the center of Malfoy’s chest that remained a dark void. “You’re really dead then? S’not some illusionary trick?”
Harry wonders if hallucinations are a part of being concussed. Before he can turn around and head inside, a voice calls out from behind him.
gave him before heading back to the observation room. Taking the first item, the key, firmly in hand, Harry slips it into the lock and slides the door open, shielding the second item in his other hand.
“Yes.” Now Potter’s doing that distinctly Potter-thing of running his hand through his ragged Potter-hair. “I’d made my decision right after you left, actually.”
~~*~~
They both stand before the mansion’s main entrance now.
“I-I didn’t want to! Vol—They had found out about our . . . recent encounters. After the attack on the Hero Order. And they saw it as an opportunity to capture you,” he says quickly. “So, they had me invite you here and used me as a distraction for time.”
“No. I mean, I tried being nice. But he refused when I offered medical help.”
“When did I say it’s my—”
His voice sounding less friendly than a moment ago, Ron says, “As my friend
.” His head shifts so that Harry knows the villain’s looking at him behind his mask. “You already know I’m not
“—can’t believe it took me that long to realize you’d been bribing them,” Harry was saying two minutes before the world tilted on its axis again.
From the start of his patrol at 6:00 pm to the current time of 9:00 pm, Harry’s been run ragged.
“Well, he does. Make me feel at peace. As crazy as that sounds, I’m at peace with him.”
Harry is so wrapped up in his attempt to communicate, he can’t dodge the next fist that ends up striking him on the side of the head. Blindsided by the attack, Harry reels backward and collapses against the little table, knocking some playing cards to the floor as he jars it.
Either his blood is rushing in his ears or the hum of his electricity is so loud he can barely hear the rest of what Mrs. Figg says.
Draco’s not prepared for the look Potter levels at him then; even if he had anything to say in response, that look reached out to Draco and squeezed his throat tight.
Heat floods under his collar, and he tosses the note on the desk he’s working at.
anything to you. I-it's so stupid—But every time you’d call me ‘hero’—even derisively—you’d . . .” His heart’s in his throat, and why—
Ron ran a hand along its arched back and spared Harry a glance. “You sure, Harry?”
Heart pounding in his chest, Harry grips the edge of the crate on either side of him. “There was always one person, right from the beginning, who saw me for who I was trying to be. In accepting the dichotomy of our roles—with you as the villain and me as the poor bastard trying to stop you—you-you recognized me as a hero without me having to
Harry says nothing and continues looking at him through his mask.
“I suggest you stop whatever game you’re playing at,” Hermione says. “You’re forgetting who has the power here to make your stay uncomfortable.”
“Don’t get me wrong,” Harry says as he breaks into a good pattern of increasing the clubs pile and the hearts pile. “I still want to know why you all decided to nab a bunch of hero identities. But we’ll call this new inquiry . . . curiosity.”
“So glad I didn’t knock the humor out of you.”
“I-I don’t—”
cut off your connection, the device continued to run as though powered by you. Further attempts by him to deaden its power were useless. The device—the arm, as you call it—felt the need to release the energy you had given it—”
Of course Dracon understands him! He’s always been clever.
James’s Control over Wind helped them tour the entire country fighting crime—not just in London. Lily’s Control over Sound gave the pair amazing stealth, perfect for hostage situations and gaining the upper hand on foes. The two of them made waves in the Super community—and probably that was why Voldemort (Moldy Wart, as he's called by the Order), the head Supervillain at the Villain Agency at the time, personally tracked them down.
“And on that note,” Alpha Bee breaks in, “I say we take a look at what the law enforcement detectives have dropped off for us to examine.”
“You heard me,” Alpha Bee calls from the corridor. “Come along,
He sighs. “Fear-Near showed up to my flat—rented out for me by my . . . Prancing Peacock—with a list of people they wanted ‘captured.’ Though, ‘abducted’ would be a more accurate word.” Dracon stops limping forward and massages his leg with one hand. “I . . . was eager to please on what felt like a step up the Agency chain. I abducted half the people he wanted and brought them, bound and unconscious, to him. You know, I never asked
“Please,” Malfoy scoffed. “Stop acting as if you have any power over this situation. Now sod off; your bitching is ruining the mood.”
Hands twitching at his sides, Harry decides to cut his losses. “See you around, Nurse Tonks. Nurse Moody.”
He’s almost at the interrogation room before he realizes he’s in a hospital-style gown, the layers thin enough that it’s doubtful it would hold up against his electricity should he power up—but Harry’s too arsed to care at the moment. He has his mask, and that’s all he needs to protect his identity.
“—which he could have gotten from doing anything from then until that fight,” Cho says.
Potter blinks, and Verdimilious shock replaces the Unforgivable anger—scanning Draco’s face for his secrets.
Upon entering the room, the lighting seems much brighter than before, and Harry can’t tell whether that’s the case or if he’s light sensitive due to not feeling up to snuff.
“What?” He yanks his arm out of the villain’s grip. Sure, he had expected as much. But the sting from the admission blindsides him.
Draco had discovered shortly after his passing that his family hadn’t only trafficked in albino peacocks, but had helped sponsor—or perhaps run—Quidditch games in the game’s earlier stages of development. The flock of Golden Snidgets that resided deep in the garden were more than happy to put on a show in the moonlight. For the right price.
!” Ron stumbles to his hands and knees.
A voice hisses next to his ear. “I don’t know what kind of fool you take me for, but you better tell me who the bloody hell you are before it gets a little messy back here.”
“I didn’t say anything.”
near the end of my shift.”
Hermione hums lightly. “No. But you two were gone too long.”
The slight shift in Blaizing Fire’s head provides Harry the only indication that he even glances at the deck.
“What?” Harry shouted, afraid Draco couldn’t hear him, afraid to look away because every second with him counted.
remains silent for a moment. “Hard to say. We may be called the Hero Order, but it’s doubtful we know all the heroes registered in the city—and especially the heroes outside London.”
for explaining how to make hover text appear in ao3.
“What? Next to you?”
“No, no. Well, yeah, I’m glad to hear he’s holding up, but I mean Blaizing Fire.”
While the other heroes filter into the already crowded room, Alpha Bee stops when he spots Harry. “Izulu. You’re up.”
“Acromium . . .” Harry whispers under his breath. Despite the sinking feeling in his chest, he looks up at Mrs. Figg with a light smile. “I do thank you for all of your help, Mrs. Figg. Would you mind if I ask one more thing of you?”
Draco fights his rising flush at the unthinking smile gracing Potter’s lips.
Harry grabs at her ankle—careful to reign in his electricity—as she steps toward Alpha Bee. “You honestly think that seeing him right now, like this, would be more beneficial than harmful?”
It’s said casually enough that Harry has no doubt he’s their prime suspect. “Of course.” He pauses for a long, drawn-out moment. “Sir.”
“Well, one of the arguing voices went up in pitch. I remember that pretty clearly because it matched well with what I had been feeling at the time. The person the machine was now facing ended up backing up into the light cast by an adjacent room in the flat.”
“Piss off, hero.” There’s still something off about Paper Dracon, but Harry can’t quite place it.
“When do we interrogate him about the incident?”
Blaizing Fire, unmasked and smirking at them all, flicks open and closed one of his lighters. “Yeah. I’d say it’s pretty destroyed.”
“Don’t worry about it.” Ron grins. “I know just who to ask to help us out.”
The three of them are only halfway to reaching the entryway to the store when chaos erupts. A loud
In Harry’s case, he heads off to find Ron and Hermione. He’s got a lot on his mind after talking to Finch-Fletchley.
If Dracon’s startled that Harry has become aware of what happened the night he found him in a ditch by North Circular Road, he doesn’t show it. “That night—I had been pestering the older villains for a while to be more involved in professional work. In a way, I got my wish . . . .”
The first time Harry meets Paper Dracon, he’s thirteen and debuting as a hero. He had spent the week hacking into the Villain Agency’s secret radio frequency, aided by his experimental zaps to a junk radio his Aunt and Uncle had given to him two weeks late for his birthday. Through a stroke of luck, he had heard blips of their plans involving a dock by the Thames.
, is that while you’ll go home and take all that off once your play time’s over, I’ll still be here doing this. I’ve trained for this chance my entire life, and some weak little nobody isn’t about to–Ack—!”
, Harry thinks.
Harry taps his foot. He hadn’t exactly counted on law enforcement crawling around this place too. He’d figured they would've already finished investigating and gathering their evidence earlier in the day—preferably before anything could be messed with or knocked askew from the exposure to the elements.
Through the rushing blood in his ears, Harry can hear Dracon and GarGoyle laughing. Frustrated, Harry sends a bolt the villains’ way, and it misses by several meters to the right.
When Malfoy righted himself, he interlocked his fingers over the tabletop, his face a mask of stone. “So. Ground rules?”
brought in. I know the Hero Order has been mainly leaving him to you younger heroes since he appears quite young himself, but this attack was a breaking point, I think.”
Debate rages about how complicit in a crime a group of underage people can be when powerful adults compel and encourage the behavior. What truly throws a wrench into these debates are the particular cases involving the young Supervillains known as Blaizing Fire and Paper Dracon.
“Then how about you tell us why you stole Superheroes’ identities from the government.” Hermione speaks this time, arms across her chest.
injured.”
. Nevertheless, Harry’s breath catches once his brain latches onto the first bit of Dracon’s response, and he tries his best to hide his sudden interest.
Ron grumbles beside Harry. “Wasn’t so helpful, that bloke, was he? For all we know, we’re chasing geese.”
Spinning on his heel, Harry heads the opposite direction. He’s nearly at the mouth of the alleyway when a shout comes from behind him.
. Adrenaline pumping, he bolts forward into the ditch, and his foot catches Dracon’s hand as it closes on the mask.
“Then tell me as much as you can. Anything that could help.”
“Because I felt sorry for him!”
, rocking on his feet and trying to ignore his pounding head and sore limbs.
Blaizing Fire’s odd behavioral shifts suddenly come into perspective for Harry. When he’d found out that Harry had let Paper Dracon go, he’d thought Dracon would inform the Agency of his loose lips. Maybe he thought that clamming up on further information would be some kind of saving grace, but from what Dracon says, the more hardened villains that run the Agency don’t know mercy. Perhaps Blaizing Fire realized that himself and that’s why he readily gave up his identity.
He ushers her back inside the spacious cell, assuming she’ll pass the news around to everyone in there.
to show up to unlock the door. Five minutes seem to pass before they arrive, Alpha Bee pulling a key ring from his starred coat.
“No way,” Ron says at the same time Hermione gasps.
I don’t want—I can’t—Don’t
Harry pretends to consider it, mentioning how he really does need to get back to patrolling and that he shouldn’t encourage them playing out in the road.
Harry hums good-naturedly. “Yeah, I suppose. But, during that latest run-in with him, I recognized a feeling I had in my chest—one that comes before I rush into collapsing buildings or stop a kidnapping. I cared . . . for him. A villain.” Harry laughs even though it’s not funny. “How pathetic is that? But something about him calls out to me, at least since this whole mess started. I look at him, and I see someone as lost as me.”
Harry would feel the sting of the insults had Dracon’s laboured breathing not tipped Harry off to how much the Supervillain probably isn’t up to fighting right now. Instead, with more measured grace than Harry thought he’d have this close to an enemy, Harry says, “You’re going to tell me what you’re plotting with those hero identities.”
............................................
“I—I’m not even certain it was the bartender. We were outside, and suddenly I was flat against the wall, my hands pinned... The creature could’ve swooped in for all I know, but the bartender wasn’t in the alley when the thing left, so I don’t know who else...”
As the door begins to creak to a close, Harry strides swiftly up to it and shoves the notepad into the opening, preventing it shutting all the way. Voldemort may have given him a key, but Harry would be daft to put trust in anything that villain says. For all he knows, it’s a fake, and, once the door shuts, he’d be locked inside with Paper Dracon and unable to escape the
“Hermione, I’ve lived most of my life with ‘the worst case scenario’ hanging over my head. Honestly, with Voldemort gone, this feels like a homecoming.”
“It’s—Well, it seems to be... difficult for you—at points.”
“Yeah. They were placed in a way that you’d almost they think were eyes.” He rubs at his chin. “I don’t remember much of what it did. But, I guess, underneath the fear, I felt really cold. No that’s not quite right. More like my body was going numb—though, that still might have been from the terror.”
“First off, that’s not what I mean. There’s many other names that creature goes by.”
The end result? Harry had been left with a permanent scar on his forehead that would stretch out to his entire body upon using his powers and will send electricity through him like blood through veins—but he doesn’t find that out until his early childhood days are behind him. To date, he is the only known Super who can use his power on himself.
“Likewise,” Harry croaks.
No response came from Malfoy who seemed lost in a world of his own. Harry crept nearer still, and almost jumped out of his skin when a ghost peachick hopped out from under Malfoy’s robe and hissed at him.
They place their clothes just at the alley’s mouth, making sure Hermione sees them from across the street before dashing off to Westminster Palace.
Ron snorts into his drink.
“Again, those pesky friends you’ve been ignoring finally realised they might not be enough to handle this... situation on their own.”
“Come off it. The bastard’s gone—not even enough soul left for a ghost. I know
“You really think I could?”
. Potter would probably take it as some veiled insult, especially having to leave the room while Draco finished up.
His air rushes out of him with a
Their desperation turns the kiss messy. All their angles are off, and Draco cuts his lips against Harry’s fangs more than once. Hands fly from gripping at hips and tearing at backs to tangling in hair and back again in seconds. It’s needy and rushed and very much the best kiss of Draco’s life. Not that he has many to compare it to.
“At least have the bollocks to look me in the eye.”
Flinging out a hand, he catches it in his grasp. The piece of black cloth is hardly larger than a coin. Looking around the immediate vicinity, Harry finds a few smaller pieces that seem to be made of the same material. If he hadn’t been looking, he would've dismissed them as regular rubbish littering the pavement.
“He’s—”
“What’s . . . ?” Her grip tightens around the sheet of paper, and she glances sharply back up at Harry. “Who . . . ?”
Harry’s not really sure who’s doing the avoiding here, but he’s not about to self-reflect. “Well, I was raised in my aunt’s house on my mother’s side; while they weren’t all that flattering about her, they were even less so about my father—when they even bothered to bring him up that is. I’d found some of my Mum’s memorabilia stored away, so I feel like I have a way to hold onto her. But I wanted something that connected me to my father, and “ sort of found that in a postcard in my Mum’s collection—sent to her when he was away from the United Kingdom visiting family.”
Shaking his head, Harry says, “Been out all day.”
.............................................
When she tugs the door open until it catches on the chain, he finds himself shocked by her bravery. Out of the crack, a small sliver of her face peeks through. “Can I help you?”
Not the answer Draco had been hoping for. “Don’t worry. You may be trussed up like an Egyptian mummy, but I still turn heads in my own way out in public.”
“What? You thought I gate-crashed—”
“I think Ron’s right, Harry.”
“Invitation?” Potter’s voice holds all the skepticism of a man who doubts the colour of the sky.
“All right. Is the Villain Agency involved?”
Harry feels grateful to have someone else voicing his desire rather than having to pantomime it again.
“I know you’re in pain, but I’m still handling your bad leg. You sure you want to get smart with me?”
Dracon turns halfway towards him. “Feeling better, hero? That head injury not going to do you in, is it?”
The sound of his voice seems to break some kind of spell as Paper Dracon finally turns his head away. With eye slits facing the far wall, the villain’s chest rises and falls in an erratic fashion.
“NO!” Harry’s movements are swift and somewhat jerky as he makes an aborted attempt to approach Hermione.
“Well, if that’s how you’re thinking about it, Vice-Net shouldn’t have been able to curve the blades like that. But he did.”
Harry turns over in bed after the door closes behind them. If his powers had any latent self-healing ability, now would be a good time for him to discover it.
Harry’s palms become slick with sweat beneath his gloves.
“Now, your friend—coworker—partner—whatever, here,
“That’s . . . so vague. Pointless, almost.”
The sensation of being analyzed is back, but now it feels like one scanning for weakness. In a hospital gown and with his body aching all over, Harry’s never felt weaker in his life. Not even during some of the more intense villain confrontations. But damned if he’ll appear vulnerable in this moment. He tilts his head up and juts out his chin to meet the challenge.
Harry only finds out about that, though, because the officer shouts it to the cop interrogating Harry before dashing inside the building with night stick raised.
“Hmm?” Harry opens his eyes and wonders when he shut them. He sees Justin’s hair standing on end. “Oh! Sorry!” Letting go, Harry steps back. “I forgot myself there.”
“But I know this isn’t your idea of a good time—and why bring me?”
“Draco!” Harry rushed to him and, unaccustomed to his new ghostly body, tackled him to the ground.
“What’s one more hero but a drop in the bucket I have to deal with?” Dracon continues, like Harry’s reaction was encouragement of some kind. He wafts his left hand in a dismissive manner. “Hardly worth noticing.”
Nodding, Draco opens his eyes and fixes his gaze on Potter’s right shoulder. “Yeah. Pulled ‘is test-a-mony too.”
She shakes her head
“Well, that’s your invitation! Get going!”
Ignoring the challenge entirely, Draco holds out the stack of paperwork he’s brought with him. “I’m here to track down the vampire that bit you.”
Harry hums and continues jotting down in his notes.
To the left, Harry finds a lab of some sort, filled with test tubes, strange liquids, and robot parts. To the right, Harry comes across a door part-way to the corridor’s end. It’s locked when Harry presses down on the handle; he looks around for a key along the wall and finds nothing. He heads back to the lab and locates a single key dangling on a hook by the entryway.
“Wow. You really went all out, didn’t you?”
This room doesn’t light up at first when he opens the door, so he stands there, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the darkness. The fabric of Fire’s under-mask certainly doesn’t aid Harry’s visibility.
As Harry and Ron work on cleaning up the plates and saving salvageable leftovers, they hear her climbing upstairs and getting ready for bed.
“What the fuck,” Harry repeated to a chorus of ‘hellos’ and an inhuman shriek from the void-ghost.
it yet.” Draco sucks in a breath and tries not to think how much easier it is to say this to someone he can’t look in the eye. “I’ve always reacted negatively to what makes me uncomfortable—other magical beings, Muggle-borns,
“If it’s not yellow-taped too much, I’ll try to have a look around there too. See what I can find out in daylight.”
“Bloody hell. We’ve got to get on finding GarGoyle.”
Nurse Moody’s gaze hardens. “But he’s still not allowed in like that. We gotta watch our backs, too, after all. And the backs of our patients.”
Harry doesn’t know, but instead he says, “Wow, some faith you have in your friend there.”
He’s just about to Disapparate to Grimmauld when he catches it, the slightest sound of robes rustling on stone. Draco may be wrong, but it’s better than going off of nothing at all. Racing down the corridor to the right of him, he stops by the closed door at the end, all other ones along the way being open to darkened rooms.
Hardly believing his luck, Harry falls into step with Dracon. Their walk is mostly silent, and Harry finds himself having to slow down a few times to keep pace with the villain’s limping speed.
Harry had faced Dementors, Death Eaters, and Voldemort himself, his Gryffindor credentials well earned. So it was not a mark of cowardice from Harry when he spun on his heel and bolted back to his room, locking the door with every legal protection ward known to wizard-kind. No, Harry was just tired; now two months after Voldemort’s demise, he’d had his adventures and didn’t need any new nonsense thrust upon him.
As the days drag on with no hint of where Paper Dracon might be, and several attempts to scout and raid assumed Villain Agency bases that turn up dead ends for both the young villain and the missing heroes, Harry can’t help but think of those final moments before Dracon let him go. The subtle shaking of his hand as he gripped Harry’s arm; the limping gait of his tread as he moved as fast as he could to get Harry to the exit; the way he pulled Harry so close that Harry could count the smallest flecks of silver dotting the white of his dragon skull mask; the whispered words soft as a kiss . . . .
Harry takes his mask out of the hoodie pocket, and Ron retrieves his eye mask from a pocket on the inside of his jacket. A long, orange bandana with holes for his eyes, it wraps around and cover the top half of his head to tie neatly at the back of his neck, making Ron look a tad like Westley from
Draco laughs as he stares up at the drywall ceiling and ignores the wet tracks running down his face and his neck. “It’s
Dracon’s laugh stutters out of him.
“And that cause would be?”
The dwindling pulses of life that came from his unconscious body definitely told Harry that had Paper Dracon stayed in that ditch overnight, he would have succumbed to his wounds.
Alarmed, Harry casts his gaze about and notices sparks coming from some of the
Dracon makes like he’s counting them off on his fingers. “Can control a person’s physical actions, as well as compel speech. Can instigate a pain-response from the body’s pain receptors. Can even instigate a person’s death—either through shutting down internal systems or through closing off the airway.” His hand makes an involuntary move to his own throat. “Basically, he can hack anyone’s brain and have it do what he wants.”
something! About this, their attack. They’ve cried just mentioning it. Me? Merlin. You’d think I’m agitated about it, upset about it—you’d think it’d eat at me. But I’ve just felt... nothing. I’m not—I’m not even
. No, they couldn’t resort to that. No matter how bad things may seem . . . .
With vigor, she set into her spellwork, aiming at the drive’s threshold, the gates, the hedges, and the ground. Over the next hour and a half, Hermione tried a variety of charms, hexes, counter-curses, and jinxes in relative silence apart from occasionally requesting Draco to “try crossing now.”
Harry thinks.
Richard and his horse stop where they are and fall over, pieces breaking off as the statue strikes the ground.
!” Ginny and Cho shout.
Harry stares at his hands. When he looks back up, he hardly knows how much time has passed. “Then what should I have done?”
“Well, now you know.” Harry glances at him and away again. His palms grow sticky with sweat. “I’ve had some time to think long and hard about that, uh,
“Mrs—”
” Mrs. Weasley swoops to embrace Potter.
Bursting into tears, Mrs. Weasley gestures both Draco and Harry toward The Burrow, and she makes several aborted attempts to hug Potter along the way but remembers and pulls herself back each time.
Opening his eyes, Harry sees Fire moving to lie beside his unconscious comrades. For the second time that night, Harry finds himself impelled to speak to the villain. As he opens his mouth, however, Blaizing Fire brings a finger to his lips and darts a pointed glance at the body closest to him. Upon realizing that Fire
Voldemort raises his hands—to either turn their limbs against them, choke them, or kill them—but is too late as the paper lightning bird dives down from the sky and rams the ground where Voldemort stands. Electric bursts run their way down the stairs from the point of impact.
“What? It fits great with my powers, doesn’t it?”
“But what hero lets their partner die? What heroine is so useless, she can’t even use her Control over Water by a
“Are—Are you certain you’re able to fight right now?” She no doubt recalls how the group of escaping heroes had to drag him outside.
“Oh, finally up, are you?”
Harry waves his hand about dismissively at Paper Dracon. “You literally went from stealing important documents from Westminster to common thievery. That’s not cliché; that’s embarrassing.”
Well, Harry
For the first time in their exchange, Draco appeared struck—his outer edges flickered and some of the light in his eyes faded.
“I don’t know.”
Everyone jumps a little when the villain snorts, a deep chuckle rising from the depths of his chest. “Really, now?” Blaizing Fire’s voice comes from the Supervillain. “Well, only if you answer mine. Why are you wasting your time interrogating me about what you already know?” His cuffed, gloved hands lift and stroke the tabletop, and his voice drops an octave. “Your lot did confiscate the file from me.”
He skips over the next door in the corridor as its similar design to the other ballroom door speaks for itself.
Potter’s reply is muffled by the scarf. He takes a step forward and trips slightly over a troll leg in the hall.
!” Dracon rips free and falls anyway.
“I thought you wouldn’t come. Why did you?” The dead tone in which Paper Dracon speaks spooks Harry.
Yet Harry’s limbs disobey his commands to open the door, heart pounding inside his chest.
“Hmm. We’ll see how long that feistiness lasts while the machine drains you dry.”
“But you haven’t restrained me. And I don’t think you’ve ‘captured’ me either.”
When he arrives at the door, it’s locked, and the key is missing from under the mat. He raps the knocker and stomps his feet to bring back some circulation while he waits on the stoop.
hurt you too. But now—”
“Quite the rough night. And you’re sure you saw no other instances of the accomplice in the flat after that? Or indications that he escaped?”
“I—I know, Draco. Believe me, I know.” He glanced at Ron, helpless, before turning back to Draco. “Are you sure you don’t know how you were able to—?”
Still breathing heavily, Paper Dracon lifts a shaking hand and presses it against the wood piece. “Little rough with that, weren’t you?”
He yanks his mind away from that line of thought. No matter how tempting it may seem to gain any kind of reaction from their enemy right now, they can’t—or rather,
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, stepping cautiously closer.
Since Potter appears to be following his lead in all this, Draco grabs the closest rocking chair. Potter then takes the plush armchair by the window; except, rather than sitting down, he leans against the armrest, hands still linked in front.
A sob chokes out from Potter. “I don’t want to bite you.”
Lifting his hand, he places the other object
“But answering law enforcement’s questions were hell.” Ron pipes up. “You’d think
“Mad-Eye? I suppose more shaken up than usual, but I haven’t really had a chance to—”
“Do you think it was some form of Polyjuice, maybe?”
striding toward them, his black coat billowing out behind him like a cape. The light red, skull mask painted to look ablaze glints in the afternoon sunlight as he moves, giving the painted fire a life-like appearance. He glides easily around the mangled car.
“I—I never said—” Mr. Park splutters.
Dracon shrugs. “Villainy.”
That pulls Harry from his thoughts. “Wait. Did you look at the letter?”
“Oh, so I’m being
“Sorry. You caught me preparing my dinner. I’d turn it off, but then the noodles will become too saturated.” He gestures at the kitchen table chairs. “Sit. Sit. I’ll put some tea on for you.”
The whole time? To me?”
Finch-Fletchley doesn’t seem to notice, since he continues anyway. “Then he flings something at the robot at the same time that the robot throws something at him. The machine’s attack causes part of his mask to nearly fall off while also making more slices in his costume. As for the robot? Got one of its arms fully sliced off.”
“Sounds nice,” Potter says around a strained smile.
“B-because!” He makes a frustrated motion with his hands and tugs a bit at his hair. “Just . . . . Just listen for a second, okay?”
“As if I’d ever be
“I’m aiming for the other one.” Ron raises his arm.
worked together and helped people inspired me to become a hero!” He glances down at his sparking hands. “Even though it’s difficult.”
“No!”
Even muffled, Draco can recognise a swear when he hears one.
“Two?”
“If that happens, you’re not fit for the title of Superhero.”
“I-I don’t really know what to say.” Harry clears his throat. “But it’s awful brave of you. To come back after all that. Really reminds me of why I always admired you—eh,
Harry and Ginny are almost at their exit when they’re passing the last crate in their way. Only, this one’s been damaged by the blast. Enough so that a fairly large hole exists in its side.
in person?” He strikes a pose he must think looks dashing rather than preposterous.
Harry automatically goes to speak but realizes what he’s doing at the last second. He shrugs instead. Then he gestures around her toward the window.
Harry asks, “But then why would there only be one attack per day? Isn’t that a little odd? If they auctioned off the hero identities they stole, wouldn’t it just be a whole bunch at once?”
Whipping around, back against the bedroom door, Harry aimed his wand right at Malfoy.
Harry’s mouth opens and shuts several times. Finally, he grabs the pillow off the floor and throws it back at Ron.
“Yeah, everyone’s feeling pretty upbeat about it. While I didn’t doubt that Poppy could do it, I certainly won’t miss the weird tension that’s been in the house.”
Pounded at by the beaks and claws of the stone beasts freed from the parapets, Harry starts sending useless shocks at the ones attacking him while he tries to glimpse Ron dealing with his own swarm. Harry knows that without being able to pinpoint GarGoyle, Ron is defenseless with his power set against the stone beasts.
of bribing them.”
The other MP glances at her colleague. “Please. If they were of any use in this situation, why would they be hiding out behind here with us?”
“O-kay.”
“He seemed pretty upset to find out I let you get away.”
like a vampire!” He turns a charming, normal smile on one of the Aurors. “Surely you can see that, sir.” Then he places his gaze back on the window as if pleading with those on the other side to see the absurdity as well.
Snorting, Malfoy said, “Viscount Archibald III has quite the reputation for being horrendous at gambling and even more horrendous at being able to say no to a round. Who knows how much more he can take on before he becomes a Shade? One almost feels sorry for the bastard.”
But he comes up short when he turns around and is mask to mask with an Agency Villain. Harry registers the white dragon mask right before a sharp blow strikes the side of his head, plunging his world into darkness.
Meanwhile, Draco and Potter watch as Mr. Hendricks’ skin develops a sickly grey quality, his facial features sharpen more, and his blue eyes shift to a burning scarlet. With Mr. Hendricks still staring intensely at him and Potter, Draco feels relieved that the other two victims aren’t in here as even
“Yeah, I know.” Ron trains his one hand on
earlier, wasn’t it?”
The conversation Harry had with
Harry just sits on the counter, back to the one-way glass. He doesn’t look behind him as Hermione gesticulates to the room beyond and the person within it.
As she vaults herself over the rail and runs up the steps, Harry realizes how quiet it’s gotten. He does a slow three-hundred and sixty degree turn and takes in the sight of Superheroes having finished their battles with their villain opponents and the remaining villains surrendering. Harry catches sight of Alpha Bee’s body again as he does, an indescribable ache rising from his stomach and up to his throat to choke him. He tamps down the urge to feel for an electrical pulse of life from Alpha Bee's prone form that Harry knows does not exist.
“Well, if that’s the case, you’re more stupid than we ever gave you credit for.”
—mission came, I thought nothing of it." A shudder passes through her.
“That’s what I said.” Tracey Davis’s gum bubble bursts loudly. Her tongue flicks out to scoop the remnants back into her mouth.
resounds through the air, and, seconds later, the ground shakes where they stand.
Nodding to himself, he darts inside the nearest building and starts to climb the stairs. Once he reaches the roof, albeit rather winded, Harry leans over the edge to peer down at the fight happening below.
Harry immediately sobered; nothing was really funny about this situation. The familiar banter had crafted a careless forgetting. “Sorry. That was over the—”
“Draco?”
Weasley narrows his eyes at that, seeming to analyse Draco.
Ron raises one of his hands high above their heads as though reaching for the ceiling. “My power’s like that, you know. Takes away people’s powers and such. How’s what I do any different from what the Supervillains have done to Finch-Fletchley?”
paperwork! And Har-Izulu’s. And—”
While Harry has been divulging what little he knows of the situation to the one officer, the other one has been asking the teenager more questions whilst a paramedic attends to his head injury.
“Anyway, I think the other hint is that his injuries were still untreated and his outfit unmended the next time we saw him almost a week later.”
The gloved hands placed on the villain’s knees clench into fists. “What do you want from me?!”
In the hospital’s atrium, he finds the front desk. Rapping on the synthetic wood gains the secretary’s attention. “Uh, hullo. I’m here to see some folks that were brought in last night? At the big explosion site several streets down.”
Harry loves being a superhero. He enjoys saving people in wreckages, rescuing cats stuck in trees, and defeating evil. The joy on the faces of the people he helps are worth whatever comes beforehand, or even after. But as Big Ben chimes for nine o’clock, Harry can’t wait to head home.
Harry and Ron have to duck down behind a red pew as the villain
Mr. Dawkins lives in a rented flat above Flourish and Blotts, a place accessible without having to go through the shop. The windows on the door and the side of the building remain covered with curtains that do not stir as Draco’s fist meets the wood.
Potter’s eyes narrow and his foot starts tapping. Even more annoying, the staccato beat isn't even set to the rhythm of the music coming from the sitting room.
“No,” Malfoy said in that voice that sounded like it was drowned again. “No, it wasn’t a dignified death.”
The dust from the debris is so thick—and so many of the lights knocked out—that they can’t distinguish between friend and foe in the chaotic fray before them.
“I think I vaguely remember that.”
Potter shuffles beside Draco, unnoticed. Though, should Potter remove his wrappings, the shop owner would be sure to take notice then. Yet, Potter makes no moves to do so, even in the perfect lighting for his current condition. All he does is cancel the spells creating the parasol effect on Draco’s wand before clearing his throat and passing it back to Draco who pockets it.
While Harry knows he’s probably not the kind of hero his parents expected him to be, he still hopes that they would think he’s a good one.
Hermione hums into her tea cup. “I know that this was a situation none of us have really been in before. Often, we rush in right when an emergency is occurring. There’s no real time to ask questions. We just act based on what information we have to go on at the time. Then once the immediate danger has passed, we’re often thanked for what we’ve done.” She taps the table next to where she’s placed her saucer. “I don’t think we’ve run into any serious problems yet that people haven’t been happy to have us solve.”
official Superheroes in Britain in their records.” She looks back at the file, fingering its pages. “This is way too thin . . . .”
Still, following the theory that it had been a fight to the death, Paper Dracon could've fled from his attacker, just like he had fled from Harry.
Harry knows he certainly doesn’t like the way Voldemort eyes Harry now. A kind of chilling recognition.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “But not sorry enough to not invite him.”
“Well, since he was so keen to give you the lead earlier, why don’t you just ask him?”
Potter comes in alone, the bags under his eyes prominent in the bright lighting. As he walks closer to Draco, Draco hazily remembers how malnourished Potter had looked at the beginning of every school year and how that had paled in comparison to the gaunt lines in his face the first time Draco’d seen it post-vampire attack. But now, stuffed full of Mrs. Weasley’s cooking and his friends’ unconditional love, Potter mostly looks tired.

“Look. If you’re fine with me seeing you, I’m fine the other way around.”
I'd like to thank
The next second, five of the
“Stop!” Harry speaks before he’s aware he planned to.
His gut instinct says the basement, but he doesn’t know where that would be.
“Then what is it?” Her tone was guarded.
he reasons while staring at his ceiling,
She waves Alpha Bee off. “I heard that they’re at it again. That we might be on the verge of catching—”
His friends run towards him, and, before he knows it, they’re rushing him out of the area.
Hoarsely, he replies, “Right-side pocket. Near the waistline.”
Dracon continues hobbling along the alleyway, hand against the bricks.
“Oh, right. So partway through, I think the two masked people started arguing. About what, I couldn’t tell you. But at some point, I think the machine—robot? Thing? —got bored with us and turned to face one of the figures.”
“Yes, I’m certain,” Ms. Adams declares with her back straight and her chin jutting out.
“Yeah.”
Thoughts of a bubble-bath surrounded by cinnamon-scented candles after dinner dash from Harry’s mind when he catches the glint of a familiar-looking mask out of the corner of his eye. He immediately jumps down from the rooftop—taking some unfortunate shingles with him—and into the shadows cast by the darkened building.
Harry huffs a breath into his hands to try to warm them up a little, and he can see it rise through the cracks between his fingers. Flexing them to get the warmed blood flowing, Harry says, “To be fair, this is the first time you’ve asked us to come. Outside of academic work.”
“What the fuck,” Harry said.
Potter’s gaze flicks back to Draco’s face, and his look becomes calculating. “I can feel your heartbeat, you know.”
They stay embraced like that for a while. Only when a particularly nasty explosion occurs do Harry and Dracon break apart.
Harry walks up to the stairway and places a foot on the bottom step. “What’s wrong, Cho?”
“That’s what it sounds like.” Hermione says, “Do you think they have anything to do with why they stole the hero identities and have started capturing different Superheroes?”
“I thought we ‘heard you out’ the last time.” Cho's glare pierces Harry through the eye holes in her mask.
After what feels like running in a vat of gelatin, they reach the door. Harry swings his free arm at it three times before his gloved fingers make purchase on the wood. Yanking it open, he and Dracon hobble through while the notepad Harry stuck in between falls to the floor.
“Say it again.”
Harry stands there for a minute before heading for the door again.
The Hero Order headquarters truly is in shambles. A large portion of it’s torched, and a good half of it is collapsing in on itself. Hermione and a few of the other heroes had managed to save items in the evidence room while the building had been ablaze.
Once she’s beside him, Harry leans up to her ear and whispers, “Superhero Izulu reporting for duty. Can’t stay around to help out. I’ve got another person to set free.”
Once he knows that he’s regained his composure, Harry dashes around the current floor until he finds the stairs again, using the glow from his power to light the way. Before reaching the roof, he cuts off his electricity, fully aware that he’s been powering up and down too much consecutively tonight to be healthy.
“That’s not pathetic.” Cho keeps her head facing the sky, jaw working. “That sounds like the nature of a hero. To care when no one else will.”
“It had been a small explosion at first. Enough that it lit some of the knocked-over furniture on fire.” Finch-Fletchley leans back on the couch. “Looked like some fancy stuff too. But anyway, with the fire, I could see that both the masked figure and the robot were pretty banged-up. Lots of rips in the one bloke’s outfit. Little harder to tell with the robot since I didn’t have a good look at it before the fight started, but it seemed to be sparking in places it hadn’t before.”
Somewhat relieved to know that that’s why
In a tired voice, Harry asks, “And could you see what the mask looked like?”
Harry looked back down at the three mini-graves just ahead of where he still crouched. “Yeah, perhaps not.”
Harry is just about to ask him if he’s all right when Dracon speaks. “You have to leave.”
. “So . . . what was that about. When I walked in?”
Harry bites his tongue. He remembers what Hermione said to him nearly two weeks ago. Taking a calming breath, he lowers the hand holding the kit. “All right.”
Paper Dracon makes a scoffing sound. “The terms of our agreement to meet were that we come alone.”
Harry can hear her swallowing. He wonders if he should put a hand on her arm like he did for Ginny ages ago. Thinking of the shaky ground on which their current relationship stands, he decides against it.
Harry sets his utensils down. “Well, for the most part it was regular patrol stuff. Helped out at some robbery scenes, stopped a Tube derailment, saved some folks.” Harry shrugs. “The usual.”
Forty-five minutes into the endeavor, Harry sat down on the pavement, merely watching Hermione going at it winding him. During one of the few breaks she took, Malfoy cautiously approached the gate.
“You let him get away?!” Blaizing Fire is on his feet, arms stretched over the table where his hands grasp the front of Harry’s costume, flinching only slightly at the sting of electricity. Harry’s neat piles of cards scatter as the table jolts.
“Let’s just say I got tired of you constantly setting my paper on fire.”
“Eh, mostly took over the situation and sent me on my way after asking what I knew.”
“So... why don’t you tell us why you’re sweating so much. Please. We’re here to help you and the vampire’s other victims. Withholding important information could hinder that.”
“Don’t apologize to me.” Dracon drops Harry and strides back to the ledge.
Justin laughs under his breath. “Yeah, okay.”
“Uh. Um. Yeah.”
is the one who arrived on the scene first, saved the people still alive, and fully cooperated with the officer’s demands for information, he’s at least due for some attempt at being treated as an equal. His teeth grind together. It’s his case too. He deserves to learn what happened to the people he’d been unable to save.
“I know you don’t like me,” Harry says into the stillness. “That’s fine. I think I understand why. You feel like I’m putting my own desires before everyone else—”
“Yeah, now that you mention it, those birds sure are corrupt for dead creatures.”
But it also means that Dracon had beaten Harry’s plan to arrive half an hour early by being even earlier himself.
Ron raises an unimpressed eyebrow while Hermione bites her lip.
Harry’s never liked being in Kensington when it’s light out, let alone when it’s dark. Too many paranoid ritzy white women have phoned the cops on “that suspicious black chav” strutting around the neighborhood. While his reputation has improved some in other areas of London, walking the Kensington streets feels like the early days.  After all, he hasn’t been daft enough to patrol here since a year ago when one person had claimed he was there to scout out the neighborhood and loot the houses when people weren’t home. Hermione’s also had her incidents here and in Chelsea, but never tells Ron or Harry about it when they ask.
—what the hell.” Dracon’s hands come up and scrabble at the articles shoved at his face. He goes to lower it once he gets a firm hold of the items, and Harry immediately looks away. “Okay, I get it. You don’t want to look at me for some reason.”
He finds Cho and
,” Ron says. “I gave that to you because, for whatever reason, the relationship between you and that villain has been changing over the month since the incident. While finding out his involvement in that case has affected how you perceive him now, he doesn’t have the same kind of shift on his end. For him, he always knew of his involvement, and the trajectory of your changing relationship has stayed the same for him.”
They stop walking when they hear the sound of hooves galloping on the cobblestone. Looking in the direction of the sound, they see Richard the Lionheart statue racing toward them with sword raised.
. Bloody well foolish to go in there yourself.”
“Okay, that’s all right. Do you recall anyone else being in the room with you besides the other kidnapped people? Like the masked person or any other type of odd item . . . ?”
Draco steps through first, and his eyes dart around the room, trying to locate their hostess. He finally finds her sitting on the far end of her couch at the flat’s center, knees drawn up to her chest and long hair obscuring her face.
“No, I suppose you wouldn’t. In fact, most of society had written him off as having run away. Why else would it have taken so long to find his body on the grounds of his own home?” Her eyes were hard, her voice cold, and her expression rigid. “But, I should thank you—you and your companion. Ill-bred as you both are, you actually bothered to look for him.”
Nodding in approval, the heroine in charge commences to lead the group down the hallway and to the stairs.
Harry feels something loosen in his chest at seeing a smiling face. “Yeah, Nurse Tonks.”
Once he’s focusing on noises not involving the crackling of the flames or his own heartbeat, Harry can also hear other shouting in the distance. He suddenly recalls all the henchmen crawling the dock shed earlier.
When Westminster Palace comes into view, people are still scattered in the streets as they try to run from whatever danger Harry and Ron are about to head towards. Harry recognizes a Member of Parliament as he dashes by the side street they came down. Without thought, he grabs the man by the sleeve. “What’s going—”
Not the set of circumstances in which Draco wanted to hear that last sentence from Potter, Draco thinks in a distant way. Still, his mouth says, “Sure,” before he really thinks of the consequences. But by the time his mind actually catches up, it’s already been said, and Potter seems to relax against the door jam. And if it means he can leave Potter somewhat content after this rough meeting, then he really couldn’t give much of a damn about rules and consequences.
Ron gestures at Cho and Alpha Bee, and then at Harry.
Harry catches the bloke trying to ferret off with an older woman’s purse and nabs him in the alley he bolts down. “Really? You’re actually purse-snatching now?”
“None that's come to mind in a month’s time.”
“True. But you were fine agreeing without the specifics, knowing it’d be a situation out of your comfort zone.” Draco glances back toward the house where Mrs. Weasley is just starting to trek towards them. “There’s still time if you want to leave. She likely doesn’t know it’s you.”
“Hold on,” Harry says as Dracon tries to stand. He unthinkingly grabs the villain’s upper arm when he starts to fall over.
Harry’s head thuds on the table.
Steeling himself one last time, Draco slips up the steps and pushes the trap door open. With the overcast sky outside, the attic is coated in darkness. A few precious seconds pass while his eyes adjust; he’d cast
When he reaches Dracon, he shifts his head to look downward and is alarmed to see a puddle of dried blood at his feet. He opens his mouth to ask if it belongs to Dracon, but swiftly remembers himself.
He tries not to move, but the part where his mask is tied at the back of his head itches like mad. Carefully, so as not to disturb the weeping girl on his shoulder, he scratches at it with his right hand.
“—and that you were bitten with your back to the vampire.”
s Cho thrashed. Reaching out a hand, he yanks what electricity remains in the robots and strikes Voldemort with it.
“No, no. Nothing like that. See, I used to work at this indie film company as their lighting expert, since I was pretty good at Control over Light.”
—don’t—
In spite of himself, Draco can feel his lips twitch a little. The more things change... “Also, Weasley.”
“Yeah.”
Ron clicks his tongue. “Don’t feel too beat up about it, mate. The guy’s always been a tosser. Not really on you for hoping any different.”
Harry does, but he nods his head anyway. His gaze now fixates on the approaching robot. Oddly enough, he expected the thing to be able to glide across to them. Instead, it stumbles in their direction with its arms outstretched, mechanical red eyes aglow, and circular robot mouth gaping like the Pale Man from
“Oh, all right then, hero. Tell me, what cause does the life of a hero serve?”
“We don’t know where they headed off to, mate.”
Harry brings a finger up to where his lips would be under the two masks. Then he beckons her closer.
“Ah-uh. Y-you couldn’t really expect . . .
Harry has to power down for the bats to be willing to touch him. He shouts back, “Paper Dracon helped me get out. We have to go back for him!”
Draco knocks one last time and glares at the door when it refuses to magically open for him before he spins around and pushes past Potter in a huff.
“What does that mean?”
Making a triumphant sound, Dracon moves to release the origami piece in his fist, when Harry says, “What do you mean? ‘After torturing’ Fire?”
“Ah—I see. Well, if you think you’re going to ca—”
“Unfortunately, you won’t be able to.”
Harry brings his right arm before his face and is surprised to see the level of electricity skittering along the sleeve, almost a meter away from the actual fabric. He’d forgotten what it’s like to be powered up without his costume on; without its assistance containing the electricity, Harry couldn’t afford to be unaware of the energy flowing off him.
Harry glanced around, his stomach sinking. He, too, only counted two peachicks fluttering about. Despite all his better judgement, Harry rushed to Draco’s side, crouching down beside him where the ghost had sunk to his knees. He moved his hands against the outline of Draco’s back, swallowing his cry against the biting cold radiating from the incorporeal spirit. “Hey, hey. It’s okay. It probably got left behind at the flat. You know, like last time you did some Ghost Disapparation. We’ll find it, okay?”
“Yes. Yeah, I’m pretty certain of that.”
“Well, there were two explosion-related incidents—a botched robbery at some business and a kidnapping-turned-murder in the residential area—”
“T-thanks.” He takes a minute to regain his composure. “Paper Dracon was involved in the kidnapping case.”
“Yeah, I know. I know.” He lets out a blustery sigh. “That’s not why I came here, though.”
“Hmm, yes,” Hermione says, “that is odd.”
The heroine who led the escape is marching towards them.
to do that? What could any normal person do in the face of-of—
Harry suddenly remembers Dracon’s hurt.
. Sorry. You—I didn’t expect—” He clears his throat into his fist. “Ah, um. I’m preparing some Kimchi for Wednesday, so that's the base for the paste boiling there—the other ingredients are prepared on the counter. My daughter will be coming home for the holiday, and I thought surprising her with her favourite dish would be, well, um. Good. A good fatherly thing to do. Yes.”
Ron looks around in the direction Harry’s facing. “Oi! What’re you three still doing here?!”
“I didn’t know your light sensitivity was so acute.”
“That still doesn’t explain why the Hero Order didn’t give us backup.” Ron’s arms cross his chest.
“Yeah?” Without Harry keeping him at bay, Ron comes within ten centimeters of Blaizing Fire’s masked face. “Want to elaborate on that?”
Harry shakes his head, shifts to face Paper Dracon—who’s slumped against the wall—and tugs him back to a standing position.
He holds his hands before himself. “I didn’t read what the note actually said. But I did check to make sure everything else about it checked out, okay?”
Harry frowns and watches Dracon stagger a bit before his legs remain steady under him. “Hey, my voice is much lower pitched than that.”
Draco’s mouth opened and closed, his pretension seemingly abandoning him at last. “Yet ending your life as you know it for something unknown—something unspeakably dangerous...”
, it reads. On the back is a date and time. Draco marks his calendar.
“But, Hermione, you didn’t see him. He looked to be standing on his last leg.”
Draco thinks back to Ms. Adams and Mr. Park’s testimonies, to their obvious fear at seeing their attacker even with a barrier separating them, and he seethes.
Slowly, the smile fades from Harry’s face; Dracon’s invisible gaze starts to prick Harry’s skin into goose-flesh. He lets out a light laugh. “Though, you know, if I improve the
Harry replied indignantly with a strangled string of syllables. He was still trying to answer her when she grabbed his arm and Disapparated them away from that nightmare of a place.
“. . . No. At least not directly, and probably not on purpose. Mostly it was just collateral from his fight with the robot.”
Harry loosens his grip entirely and backs up.
“Oh, so you meant some minimum wage fare? Like grocery bagger?”
“Get up!” The lead heroine calls above the din. “There’ll be enough time for that later.”
of the Villain Agency.”
She gasps and points at the gentleman second to last on the right—a tall fellow, muscular in build, with a certain sharpness about his features. “Him. That one.”
They spend a half an hour more there while Mr. Park explains meeting his future date at a local bar, and, being a single, divorced parent, getting taken in by the person’s charm. Partway through, he takes the noodles off the stove and sets them aside for later but leaves the Kimchi-paste base still boiling away. He then goes on to tell Draco and Potter about how wonderful the date had been up to the point of the attack. While the vampire hadn’t gotten very far since a bystander had heard Mr. Park’s shouts and intervened, the attack followed the perp’s pattern of pinning the victim’s hands to a wall while going for the back of the neck.
. But saying it now would be to admit he was aware of the innuendo, and therefore would admit to Potter on some level where his thoughts slide sometimes.
The large man howls as he goes down.
He can feel Ron’s gaze on him, even with Ron’s mask shielding his eyes. Harry doesn’t miss the subtle shift where Ron starts to raise his hand in Harry’s direction. Feeling a spike of panic, Harry subtly shakes his head.
Harry tries to power back up but overcompensates, resulting in a brief flare of electricity jumping along the borrowed suit.
“It was a lead.”
He shoves the thought aside as the pain begins to subside. When facing the remaining villains, he’ll have to somehow get away with using much less power than he’s used to. Those knives had sucked more energy from him than he’d counted on, but that was to be expected considering it’s the first time he’s ever used that type of technique.
“I still don’t like it,” Ron says
Her head shifts as she looks at Draco, and he catches a glimpse of more of her face. Her brown eyes have sunken slightly in their sockets. The skin looks drawn and almost translucent, the only splash of colour being the unnatural redness of her lips. A moment later, Draco realises why as he watches one of her small fangs pierce her bottom lip, and blood spreads across it.
“And you wear a mask, so what’s your point?” Moody grunts.
With Dracon’s coat in hand, and, without looking, Harry feels with his free hand for where Paper Dracon’s face would be. He gets as far as touching what must be the joint between shoulder and neck before Dracon yanks away from Harry’s touch. But he now has a good enough estimate.
“—Uh—
Harry knows the question he should ask next, logically speaking. But he decides to hold off on it for now. “So, then what happened?”
“This again?” Paper Dracon lifts the gloved hand not attached to the bin and makes like he’s examining it. “Haven’t you figured out yet that this line of questioning doesn’t work?”
for you? No.”
Slowly, Harry looks back up at him, and, not trusting his voice at the moment, nods.
Ron speaks up after remaining silent for so long. “While I agree it’s good to be wary with so many of our members in danger, it’s prolly not a good idea to turn on each other when our fellow heroes are all we have in this bad situation. What do we have if not trust in one another?”
“Hey, hero.” The villain’s roughened voice stops Harry.
Alpha Bee frowns. “Unfortunately, the detectives are still treating witness testimony as confidential.”
“Hey, don’t look at me like that!”
“You said you were making her her favourite dish. But that doesn’t mean you’d eat it with her.”
“He had stopped laughing after the colleague started attacking the machine. I think he was yelling? I couldn’t see if he was doing more than that, though.”
Shuffling noises can be heard on the other side, so Draco steps back a bit from the door, making sure he’s in perfect viewing range for the peep hole. Silence descends for several minutes, and Draco’s eyes flash to Potter and then to the door and back again.
“Bloody hell,” Ron says. “That’s why they broke into the House of Lords?”
Alpha Bee doesn’t move.  “Ah, so you value honesty?”
here.” Potter sounds farther away than before, as if he’s retreating more to his side of the attic. He backs up far enough that a sliver of light coming from a crack in the roof glances briefly across his face.
Harry tried not to snort at the idea. That sounded like poltergeist work, and no matter how annoying Malfoy’s presence had been thus far, he was no Peeves. Harry doubted Draco even possessed the kind of life energy required to have that sort of physical effect on the living world. Instead, he said, “So what was that whole gambling venture? Would the winner actually get to keep the body parts?”
Sometimes, Harry also hates how much his friends know him. He lets out a long sigh and scrubs a hand down his masked face. “I know. It’s just . . . . Of course, the reason he was injured was due to some nasty situation of his own making. And, damn it all, his nonsense got people killed this time.”
“Can I come in?” Draco asks, feeling ridiculous. As if their entire relationship in the past has ever consisted of asking
flat without his permission and what they were betting
The silence stretches until Harry recognizes that the villain is waiting for him to go on.
Ron snorts.
That would explain why Dracon’s bearing at the beginning of the fight had been different. He’d been favoring one leg, and neither Harry nor Ron could tell from such a distance. Peering closer at the Supervillain, Harry receives another shock. “You still have your other injuries.”
“Quite the bold assumption. Besides, he seemed pretty concerned about
“Oh.” Draco’s grey eyes dart away from Harry’s masked face. “I see.”
Harry sweats.
Harry’s exhaustion disappears, and his heart rate spikes. “We captured one?”
Fire seems to have fallen back into his silence again.
—a hero friend of mine introduced it to me a week ago. Gives me some cool ideas for my powers.” His smirk grows even more. “Besides, couldn’t have you pulling your Houdini act again after another crime.”
“That second one, I can believe. However, the first—”
“I’m back.”
“All right. I don’t particularly recall the incident.”
“I know how tempting revenge may—”
“Harry, you
“Tsk! Potter, do you really know nothing about ghosts? You’ve only lived with one as a House mascot for seven years.” At Harry’s blank look, Draco continued, “It takes time, after death, for a ghost to pull enough energy from the world around us to develop visibility to the living. For the first several weeks, we are nothing but a mere gust of wind, a cold draft of thought, clinging to a world no longer ours.”
—at?” Harry’s coughing only infuriates him further.
His eyebrows raise behind his mask.
Two of the victims that he locates are out cold; he hauls them from the building first. The last one clings to consciousness and Harry’s suit as Harry drags him over the threshold and onto the pavement. His sand-colored hair is matted with blood, and coughs rattle his frame when he tells Harry the situation was originally a kidnapping.
Harry didn’t have a cold enough heart to tell her the truth, so he pointed a little off to her left. “Around there.”
“I believe so,” Hermione says. “Lavender knows her girlfriend well enough to know what to say. Plus, Mr. Patil told me he, Mrs. Patil, and Padma spent the last several days shoving everything remotely metallic out the door. And yes, Harry, it’s still working fine. Your quick-fix should hold until he can get an appointment at the repair shop.”
He strides toward Harry again, but this time, instead of grabbing him and hauling him up, the villain crouches next to Harry. “What kind of game are you playing at, hero?”
They must glance at it because it’s suddenly knocked from his fingers by the villain Harry does not know. “Bullshit you work here! You wouldn’t have tried to run from us if you did.”
Then, Fire removes his identification mask, his outer coat, and his gloves and reaches for his under-mask.
Harry recognizes
Blaizing Fire allows the three other villains to step towards Harry while he hangs back.
Once Dracon pulls back, he says, “All right. You can open your eyes.”
He’s lucky that it catches the villain by surprise and sends him off balance. He’s unlucky that the villain grabs hold of Harry’s wrist and drags Harry with him off the crate. He’s even unluckier that the villain manages to shift their positions midair so that Harry’s the one that breaks the fall.
, but Izulu! You already do that!” She says from behind her hands.
end, Potter. Your answer falls into the purview of
Harry winces. “But I think you’ll all maybe understand in a moment. See, I think that there’s something particularly strange going on in the Villain Agency. Especially with Paper Dracon. Like, maybe a rift of some kind.”
“What was that, Potter?”
“Well, what’s been shared with us is part of that crime scene.”
“For not even a minute did I think you were some lesser hero—for losing your partner and disappearing for so many years. Can’t imagine anyone else would, either."
“Yeah? Well best of luck to him,” Mad-Eye says. “At this rate, we might as well let the little blighter go, for all the help he’s been.” He kicks at a loose chair.
Her finger taps the wooden arm of her chair. “Well . . . . It’s a bit of a family secret, but since you told me who’s responsible for taking it—and I really have no fondness for the scoundrels—I suppose I could tell you a family secret. It’s made from really expensive wood.”
Harry goes to dig his nails into the table, but his gloved hands just slide uselessly against the surface.
Once Harry reaches the girl, she looks up, startled—either because he was conscious or alive, Harry did not know.
, hero.”
“Yes.”
Saturday comes faster than Harry had anticipated—which is odd since the week felt like it had also dragged out for longer than necessary. He stands before the warehouse doors of an old steel plant, his invitation clutched in his gloved hand and his electricity buzzing around him. The paper had shifted its lettering to flash the number of the warehouse Harry was expected to go to when he entered the yard.
Beneath the anger bringing new life to Malfoy’s features, Harry saw the roiling fear lurking in his eyes. He shut his own eyes against the sight, regretting that decision immediately as the memory of Malfoy staring at him through a bathroom mirror with the same expression etched itself on the back of his eyelids. Bloody buggering bastard.
Paper Dracon’s strained laugh comes out bitter. “I-if I didn’t—eheh—know any better, I’d—
He hesitates for a full minute.
“So, the masked person attacked the machine?”
Her white, wrinkled face falls on hearing that Harry had not actually found her boat, but it lifts again when he says the second part. “Okay, then. Out with it! Who stole Mr. and Mrs. Truffles’s favorite play site?”
“Stay back!” The MP tries to jerk away at the accidental shock Harry gives him at his touch, and then tries even harder once he gets a look at Harry.
Upon reaching the main floor of the house, Harry sees the crisp, clean elegance from earlier in shambles. Vases have fallen off their stands to shatter on the floor, crumbled bits of wall crowd the hallway, and dust scatters everywhere. Shouting comes from every direction of the house.
“Hmmm—haha. A lot.”
Harry stops writing as he stares blankly at the page.
“Nothing in life lasts forever. Not countries, not kings; not hope, not freedom; not loss, not fear. Not Harry Potter.” Harry snorted. “But perhaps the bonds we form with other people make the comings and the goings more worthwhile.”
Draco sighs, the air pushing through his teeth in a hiss, and turns fully to face Potter. “Do you really think I couldn’t have a job where my employer doesn’t hold resentment for my past? Because they’re a Knut a dozen. You saw those witches and wizards back in the Owl Emporium; all of them were practically falling over themselves to flatter me, touch me, assure me that
So that means they only lost the one hero, Charity’s Grace, the day after Blaizing Fire had been let go. She’d been ambushed on her walk home in her civilian regalia after a particularly grueling patrol. She’s been missing ever since. Looking back on that night, the heroes that had patrolled with her noted that the harsh night of crime fighting had most likely been orchestrated so that she had been too exhausted to fight back against the Agency kidnappers. The day after the incident, her civilian name had been splashed all over the papers, declaring the University Professor, Charity Burbage, missing.
“We gotta subdue them faster.”
“Fair.”
“Look out!” Ron shoves Harry to the side as the Thatcher statue dives from the upper level of the room.
Dracon’s voice cracks as he tries to speak. He clears his throat and tries again. “Yeah, I hadn’t deluded myself with a future with that hero—never even got to see what color his eyes were. Still . . . .” His voice turns wistful. “It made for such a nice dream. I suppose I should have known I was ruined then.”
you want to go through with this, Harry?”
He tries not to resent that, he really does.
“That . . . that’s it?”
It sounds like acceptance, and Harry feels numb with it.
When Harry reaches the door to the interrogation room, Ron’s got his hand on the handle and is staring it down in frustration. Harry cocks a brow. “Forgot how to turn a knob?”
“Not like that, ya aren’t.”
Taking a breath, Harry works to calm the adrenaline rush so that he can properly power down. Sneaking around while being lit up by his power would be like tailing someone with headlights on.
“New one I’ve been saving up—but fuck it.” He uncurls his hand to reveal a miniature paper swan. As the swan sits on his gloved palm, it starts to shake until its wings beat, and it flies right off the villain’s hand. Only, the bird doesn’t remain small. Instead it grows with each flap.
When Malfoy bent down to reattach one of his big toes, he asked the floorboards, “Why put up with me?”
Both him and his creation are so mesmerizing, Harry isn’t sure which one to watch.
She takes the gesture as an invitation to lay her head on his shoulder, trapping his left arm between them. Well, the odds are pretty good that he’s made some friends out of this ordeal. Saving one another’s lives and whatnot—solid bonding experience.
The door swings open, and Harry’s somehow the last one inside. Everyone except Ron seems to be giving the villain enough space. Both Alpha Bee and Hermione stand against the walls, facing the desk, while Ron leans his hands against it. The door closes behind Harry with an audible
“Bring the trolley inside.”
“So, we’re going
The aging Auror plops two moving pictures on the tabletop—one of Ms. Adams and one of Mr. Park, both before being bitten. “Recognise these folks?”
“Weasley.” He needs to regain control of the situation. Somehow.
“H-he
“I’m not sure about whether I saw this the night I went into the building. Everything seemed to be on fire, and smoke was everywhere. And my main focus was on finding survivors of the explosion,” Harry says, feeling like he’s managed to let his fellow heroes down once again.
No one’s told him what happened or why he was brought back to the interrogation room.”
“And that’s
The weariness rises again inside him, along with a headache, threatening to pull Harry under. He powers through the urge by sheer will. “So many people have been hurt. Who knows who could have died? Why did you leave us on our
“W-we h-
Harry wets his lips and has so many things he wants to say but doesn’t quite have the courage to say them.
“Maybe it’s good for someone like me to feel uncomfortable sometimes.”
But now, the mutilation the mask has suffered threatens the identity of its wearer; one of the white eye patches is completely gone, and a long gash slices diagonally through the fabric covering Dracon’s cheek. It’s barely noticeable with the dark red blood encrusting it. There’s even a large enough tear at the top of his head that a tuft of hair threatens to bust through. But it also must be matted with blood for it to stay in place with the wind snatching at the loose fabric ends.
“Have a seat, if you want,” she says.
“Okay, this way, Miss.” Draco’s supervisor shepherds Ms. Adams to the door opposite the one she came in, signaling to the other Auror in the room to bring in the next person from the corridor.
“You might want to sit down for this.” Harry helps guide Dracon as he slides down the wall until he’s seated on the ground.
Quick as he can manage, Harry picks back up Dracon’s costume pile and shoves it as his face when Harry turns back to face him.
He walks over to Potter who’s fumbling with his own wand. “Here.” Draco holds out the handle of his wand to Potter, his fingers near the tip. “The spells should hold on their own for at least a little while.”
But also . . .
Harry felt uncomfortable at how sad Malfoy seemed at that and hated himself a little for feeling that way. “Where were you before? Maybe I can stop by and see if I can find it?”
“It’s just... not.” Harry had grown up with people telling him it wasn’t his fault his loved ones died because a madman wanted him dead, and he’d never been able to believe that. He never understood how it wasn’t his fault, but maybe if he did, he’d do better by Draco now.
“I’ll give it to them damn villains at the Agency; they sure know how to train their people to shut up tight.”
................................................
“Oh, ‘of course.’” Dracon stuffs his hands into the pockets at his hips. “How could I expect anything else?” He pulls his hands from the pockets and out flies a pair of paper hummingbirds.
So, the bastard had attacked him with the ruined bits that had fallen out of his torn pockets. Pretty slick, for a guy who’s half dead on his feet.
Unlike with the other young villains on trial, these two have Superheroes who testify on their behalf—at least a month and a half of strange behavior hinting at coerced actions. Additionally, the young villains’ assistance the night of the Raid and Rescue mission on the Villain Agency’s main base, along with no past convictions on their criminal records, also helps their cases.
“Whelp, since it’s Friday, and we’ve all had a very stressful evening, I say we deserve to unwind.”
Voldemort lies motionless on the stairway, surrounded by the dying emberous glow of over a thousand paper cranes.
Harry hums in thought and rocks on his feet. “Guilty. Hey, have you ever heard about this cartoon they had over in the States?
Harry sends another shock along the street and this time hits his target.
They follow him in as he walks over to his kitchen where steam puffs out from under several pot lids.
“Not obvious? Haunting you, of course, you dolt.”
“What? Why? That’s too dangerous!”
“Now you’re sure, Ma’am, that the boat’s been gone for over a month?”
The fact that his mother had gotten away should have cheered Draco up, however, the benefits of such news were offset by the disappearance of yet another one of Draco’s peachicks. Together, he and Harry scrounged the garden for it, while the last peachick dozed in Draco’s chest. Failing to uncover where the little thing could have wandered off too, a despondent Draco demanded Harry leave for home and allow him his solitary sulk.
Ginny leans unapologetically atop the glass casement as she peers down at the arm. “It’s fine,
When the people Harry has been keeping an eye on turn away from the building, get knocked out, or turn out to be heroes he hadn’t recognized, he convinces himself he’s overthinking everything.
He bets that Dracon knows that type well.
“Oh.” Malfoy blinked as though awakening from a dream. “They were with me when I—
Ron sighs. “Look, mate. I know you’ve been feeling really strange about him, lately, after you found out about his involvement in the kidnapping-turned-murder case, but—”
~~*~~
Reluctantly, Harry pulls himself away from the hole in the crate and takes back his position with Ginny.  Even as they leave the building, he finds himself looking back. Particularly when he hears the unmistakable sounds of an engine revving.
Harry nods along as he listens, slipping on his hero mask. It’s strange pulling it on after already being charged up. He actually has to tug strands that stick to the inside with static out the opening at the top of his pullover mask. Normally, he’d unknot the string in the back, but he doesn’t trust how steady his hands are at the moment.
He awakens to the smell of smoke and the sensation of extreme heat.  Whatever isn’t blanketed in thick black fumes is covered by a flashing orange. Lolling his head around, Harry can see the shape of bodies in the distance.
“O-oh, I didn’t know you had . . . cats. Yes. That, uh, changes things greatly.” He clears his throat as he faces Tracey again.
The two of them watch as the firemen pour water onto the engulfing flames.
That startles a snort from Harry, and he feels himself power up to respond. “Hullo to you too.”
. Though, for all we know, this thing could have caused the explosion, right? I second
Dracon’s breath comes out in a hiss, making Harry realize he’s probably putting pressure on what must be a broken rib since he tried his best to focus his electricity away from his hands to not zap him. After Harry lets off a little on the force he’s using, Paper Dracon huffs out a few more breaths before replying. “And yet, you forget we’re diametrically opposed, hero.”
When he reaches the building, he stalls before the crime scene tape cordoning off the entire perimeter. Gone is the blaze and smoke creeping out of the hole blown in the side from last night. Now Harry can see the complex's charred carcass.
Dracon releases a string of swears. “Break it again.”
“Oh, you heard about the interrogation?” She pats at her neon pink hair and darts a quick glance at the window. “Or did you want to ask him a few questions?”
Another person grabs the hero and pulls him back. “Sir Cadogan! Please don’t antagonize him!”
says as he steps up beside Nix-Nypmh.
“Can you really guarantee that, though? Yeah, say we get a look under his mask? A name doesn’t come attached with it. Then we’ll be focusing our energy on tracking down his name and address instead of what we should really be spending our time hunting down.” He looks around at his deflating teammates. “Besides, I’d still like to look the other heroes in the eye when we get their information back. And my own in the mirror.”
The words die on Draco’s tongue like a phoenix on burning day as he meets Harry Potter’s Killing Curse green eyes. As the silence lingers, he loses hope of their resurrection.
The breeze turns sharp, and a drop of water splashes onto one of Harry’s eye lenses. Harry curses under his breath. He doesn’t have great control over his powers in the rain.
“Well, s’not like I ask any of the villains for permission before deadening their powers.”
The villain’s weight leaves Harry’s body, and while the pounding in his head makes focusing anywhere difficult, he believes he sees a colony of bats clinging to the many pockets in the bloke’s costume, flying several meters above the ground.
“What more could there be to it?!” His glasses nearly fly off with the emphatic hand movements that come with his statement.
He catches up to Dracon just as he’s leaving the house.
Harry nods his assent, and they begin their box-in approach.
Draco stops when his back brushes against a wall, and he stares defiantly into Potter’s brilliant green eyes. “All right... You willing to be a little uncomfortable with me, Potter?”
follow me out here?”
“Did they say what kind of accident?”
old woman, who wouldn’t accept them for an entire five minutes, Harry reached the scene of what wound up being the kidnapping-turned-murder around 7:45 pm.
Delicately, Potter grasps the frame, arm stretched out and body far from Draco. His movements are calculated and deliberate, and their fingers do not brush. “Crowded, Diagon Alley.”
Being as dignified a gentleman as Harry was, choking on his own spit could have gone worse.
Harry shrugs. Despite taking a long rest after coming home yesterday, his suit feels particularly heavy on his sore body.
“I ran into your villain friend on my patrol.”
“Bullshit.”
“Yeah. I think I can handle it now.” He’s powered up, after all. And with that comes more energy in his limbs. Though, he’ll probably pay for it later once he powers down again and can’t move for a week and a half.
Harry clenches his hands in his lap and shrugs.
The villain remains silent for so long that Harry suspects he hadn’t heard. Just as Harry is about to ask again, he says, “Basically over. After you knocked out Blaise and his squad, most of the Agency felt no need to stay. The rain put the fire out, though it’s much harder to say whether the charred parts will continue holding up.”
Now they both stand there, faces bared.
“Nah. He’ll figure that out when you show up. Plus, if it is a trap, he’ll at least be uncertain about whether you’re actually coming.”
The movement stops.
Harry had sent an electrical shock along the pavement that went just to the right of Blaizing Fire.
“I can’t believe you bloody well lost to that prick,” Ron says for the eightieth time. “I mean, blimey, Harry. You couldn’t have waited until you were better to make that kind of challenge? Now we’ve lost a source of information—granted, he very well sucked at that, but, still.”
While debating what to do, Harry’s eyes become unwittingly drawn back to the top of the mask where the frayed edges of the torn material keep catching in the light breeze. Without truly thinking it over, Harry imagines grabbing at the flicking end and just . . . pulling the mask away.
you understood their pain, Potter. And—and you left the room because you got overwhelmed, didn’t you? Now, and back then, too—at the victims’ homes.”
“Vaguely.” Yes, Harry remembers it.
Ron’s cheeks turn a light pink. “Er . . . . I didn’t pry it open or anything. But I may have held it up to a streetlight to see if I could see inside.”
“Hah. Not in Villain Strip Poker.” He winks. “Though, if you want to bet your trousers in exchange, I won’t complain.”
to get a bad mark on a project we’ve had a
He awakens in the medical ward with
“You asked that I re-break it, and I did. There really isn’t a way to go gently about it.” This time, Harry takes out another piece of wood and some bandage wrap. Balancing the wrap atop the leg, he presses the other wood piece on the opposite side of Dracon’s leg. “Hold that one too.”
as ‘Holy shit, one’s throwing a car right at us!’
Draco’s Adam’s apple bobs as he swallows. “Okay.”
Sliding off the roof, he lands in the nearly empty street. Apparently, he had been the only one not to check the weather report today. That’s fine. If the storm ends up being real blustery, not many folks would want to be out and about, meaning Harry could head home early.
“Paying in advance. And I’m betting on you.”
Numbness floods Harry’s senses. Distantly, he thinks he can hear Dracon’s voice calling out to him, saying something unintelligible.
Harry feels so relieved that he actually powers down without thinking about it.
She turns in Alpha Bee’s embrace.
Surprised, but pleased, Harry smiles at her, and she shyly smiles back. Together, they each throw one of Ron’s arms across their backs.
One of the Aurors’ hair changes from black to a salt and pepper grey while another Auror has age lines crossing her face where before it was smooth. The Auror who cast the spell loses an inch of height and ragged patches in his red Auror robe suddenly stick out in sharp relief.
“What do you mean, ‘you don’t know’? I’d imagine it would be quite the vivid occasion.”
“Doesn’t a good name come with your profession, hero?”
. That could be read as an underhanded slight at Potter’s current condition, and they’ve been getting on
~~*~~
Ron lifts his head up and rests it on his hand. “So, what’d the plonkers do this time?”
“No, they didn’t really go into details. Just said that his ‘sacrifice’ would not be in vain, or something to that effect. Do you notice how all those kinds of folks claim that sort of thing? How someone losing their life won’t be a vain effort, and that it’ll somehow have a positive impact on the future and blah, blah, blah?”
Voldemort and the professional adult villains who partook in the development and creation of the
Potter winces, showing off a fang. “Sorry, Mr. Park. I hadn’t—I didn’t come along to make you feel like your experience should somehow be compared to mine. Not like that. And I—I just thought being upfront about my—er—
Nodding to one another, he and Ron dart completely out from behind the pew. They both have their arms raised but come up short upon seeing the empty House of Lords.
Draco wants to say something, but he’s not entirely sure what about the situation set Potter off—what he could say to make him feel better. So for once in his life, he bites his tongue, and lets Potter talk.
. . . strong enough to cut steel!
It only clicks for Harry when the air surrounding them all turns hazy, yet all the people continue standing out in stark relief.
Reluctantly, he removes one hand from beneath his leg and is satisfied to find it steady. No point now in waiting for the villain to come to his senses on his own, not if he wants to remain part of the living. Harry considers his options before directing his hand in Paper Dracon’s direction. Closing his eyes, he feels out for the electrical pull he’d sensed earlier and startles when finding it even fainter than before.
Potter’s head moves in Draco’s direction then back again. He clears his throat and deliberately lowers his hands to his sides. “Yes.”
“Malfoy.” There’s that Potter glare Draco simultaneously hates and has missed.
“Everybody wants something. Everybody’s after something. Everybody has a price. Even people like you.”
By the time the kitchen door swings open, Draco’s lost count of how many shots he’s had.
Relaxing a little, Harry finally turns his head to face Paper Dracon.
Harry takes a breath that feels more watery than it should be and nods his head. “Yeah. I’d-I’d appreciate that.”
“Oh, all right, all right.” Mr. Fortescue digs around in one of the ice buckets before popping back up with twin servings of ice cream. “For my wonderful customers, braving the cold, you can have my new mixture—Rainbow Swirl—on the house!”
Panting, Harry says, “Not bad.”
Fully out in the corridor, Harry pulls the door shut behind them. He tries the handle and finds it locked; vaguely, Harry can hear the
“Nervous, Potter?”
—properly.”
“Yes, paper.” Harry does jazz hands. “Super scary.”
Potter’s face pinches up. “Look, I don’t—”
The first thing that he sees is the white dragon skull mask, visible like a beacon in the moonlight. He has to strain his eyes to make out the form clad in black sprawled out in the ditch. But when he does, he jolts to his feet and powers up again in a flash. Lightning dances on his fingertips as he prepares for an attack that never comes.
“How ‘bout we call it quits if we continue wandering around without finding anything after another half hour?”
Now Potter’s facial expression is becoming shuttered, and Draco can’t have that. He needs to switch tack. He needs—They’ve never been real gentle with one another, have they?
As his thumb runs back up the crack, Harry’s eyes are drawn back to Dracon’s lovely piano fingers. Involuntarily, he thinks of all the times those same digits would dig into Paper Dracon’s pockets and fling sharp, deadly paper at him . . .
“Er . . . no. Actually, from the robot he and a colleague originally set on the people they kidnapped. Turns out the thing turned on him and attacked him. They got into enough of a fight that it caused the explosion, as well as gave Dracon the injuries I saw him with later.”
“And?”
“First name basis? Why, I should have died sooner!”
Even as Harry finds himself drawing closer to the hospital, he knows by the tight pull at the seams of the suit that he can’t travel by rooftop on the way home. Or get into any fights. He’s already pressing it, being powered up in the compact fabric; he’ll have to dowse it in anti-static spray once he’s finished for the day.
Harry fought back a shudder; how could Malfoy be so blasé about his own passing? “Er, I mean, they would’ve definitely run into your ghost.”
has stopped by a few times to check in on how the injured heroes are recovering. These rare instances allow for even rarer updates about what’s going on outside the world of the Weasley household.
They dive out of the way of the horse as it charges them, and the blade just skims the top of Harry’s hair.
The shouting that had seemed muffled earlier floods him as his electricity suddenly cuts off. He looks up to see Ron holding his palm out to him, and he realizes the numb sensation has taken over the arm he stretched out to the machine. Glancing down at it, he notes it shaking; he lifts his other hand to brace it and doesn’t feel the hand when it latches on. The slight movement makes him lightheaded.
“Thank you, Weasley. I’m glad your Auror Training has sharpened your observation skills to a dull point,” Malfoy snapped.
know that?” Her eyes roll skyward. “I just know that at the end of the last month, her nephew comes along and carts it away.”
hadn’t even been at the scene for as long as
“That’s all right. We’ll add the bartender to our suspect list just in case.”
“Sorry, Harry,” Hermione calls out from Harry’s other side. “Going back now would mean getting captured for sure. We’d be of no help to him like that.”
. He positions himself properly. “Brace yourself.”
’s place of residence.”
“Let’s start with this: why did you lie to me?”
Harry feels the indescribable itch return to his fingertips, and he knows it has nothing to do with the electricity surging through him.
As Harry readies himself for bed, having bid Ron goodnight, he finds his mind drifting to Paper Dracon after having to remove the duffel bag containing his ruined suit from atop his bedspread.
“Who says I only have one?”
Dracon twists his head so he faces forward again and away from Harry. “What’s this about wrapping my leg?”
“Jeeze. Are you and I always this stubborn?” Ron mutters something about understanding Hermione’s frustrations a little better. “I’m saying that you started something with that villain. Your opinion of him didn’t really negatively change when he was involved in the Westminster break-in, or any of the other crimes he was involved in during your other interactions with him. Yet the way he’s interacted with you has steadily changed for the positive since the start of all this over a month ago.”
says, “Please! Forgive his insolent tongue, Voldemort, sir. He’s been in isolation for four days and no doubt has grown restless.”
He gestures at Ron’s arms. “Need help?”
Striking as the beauty around him was, Harry began to feel unnerved with how everything looked not like it should. He stopped moving and tried calling out for Draco. With the third attempt, he got a reply.
“Blaise—Blaizing Fire—” Paper Dracon’s voice is so soft that Harry nearly misses it. “—told me about what you did. How you kept to the Code, even for him.”
“I just wanted to know, uh, if you remember
They continue their search in silence for a while. Finally, Ron asks, “Where exactly do you think it is?”
“I haven’t bitten anyone,” Potter says quickly, voice losing its smooth quality for a moment.
Dracon cocks his head. “Lu-Lu?”
“I suppose. But I still don’t like the idea you’re leaving yourself open to attack.”
“Huh, you know what the strange thing is? It actually had me feeling less fear. Almost like the situation came into better perspective where, yeah, it was clearly bad? But it hadn’t been the mind-numbing fear I felt on first waking up.”
Draco leans forward on the table. The tone he uses next is one he only uses with Mother. “Mr. Park, why are you sweating so severely?”
“Not fond of tea? That’s all right.” Alpha Bee gestures to Hermione who already has her notebook out. A chair materializes on the opposite end of the table, in front of Alpha Bee. He takes it and sits down across from the prisoner. “
“On purpose?!” So many voices shout it that Harry cannot pinpoint the exact sources.
Draco shrugs. He’s never come across it happening before. Vampires tend to use their hypnotic allure to keep their victims pliant. Would Polyjuice affect that?
“Jeeze,” Ron says. “You couldn’t’ve just tapped him on the shoulder or threw a pebble?”
“You struck out some of our key pieces in this battle. I would be remiss to just let you go for that.”
“Didn’t we have this discussion before? It’s nightmares, not dreams.”
part. Back when we first met at Canary Wharf, Ron.”
Patches of what Harry assumes must be skin peek out from multiple tears throughout the costume, noticeable from this distance only for the sharp pale contrast they provide to the surrounding darkness. His long, black trench coat fans out under him like a cape. Little white shreds decorate the ground where any of Paper Dracon’s numerous pockets have also torn.
“...Yes.” Potter seems to realise the ferocity in his movements, glances over at Draco with a look foreign on his face, and sits gently back down in his seat. “I couldn’t stay in my flat after that. I don’t know if my
"I just, you know—” Harry gestures with his hands “—gavehimalightzap.”
“Oh, have you?” Draco says lightly.
"I've never heard of someone with a power that sounds like that."
Harry chuckles. “It’s perfectly fine if you don’t. I’ve certainly aided enough people in my three-year career to know how a lot of it just . . . runs together.”
“Say, mate,” Ron said. “You know how in Auror Training, we’re being expected to pick up a case to try to solve? Why not do Malfoy’s? Sure, it’s a bit of cheating, being able to ask him directly about it, but two birds, eh?”
Several locks spring from their tumblers, and the door opens a crack. A brown eye stares out at the two of them, about the height of Draco’s sternum. Then the door shuts again, and the scurrying of feet can be heard before a melodic voice calls out, “Door’s unlocked. Come in.”
The door slams behind him.
“If he is, he certainly hides it well,” Ron says.
Before Harry could open his mouth, Malfoy was snarling from the gates, “So that’s it, then? Giving up after one little snag? You got what you came for, and you’re just going to leave me here?!”
“Enemy, huh?” Dracon mutters under his breath in the same tone. Then he straightens his torso and adopts a strange, business-like air about him. “So, hero, you’re wondering why I asked you to come here?”
off duty.
Harry takes a breath and focuses on the energy field surrounding the body, rather than the one circulating through it, and speeds it up a small fraction—
“Correct.” He twiddles his thumbs and kicks his legs in the air.
Feeling lighter after having found the Superheroes and passed along the message of escape, Harry continues his walk down the corridor to the far door at the end. As he draws closer, he notes a trolley with a white cloth draped over it pushed off to the side.
“Let me guess. You pulled your little stunt when snarking me earlier, thinking I wouldn’t notice what you’d done.”
storms inside. A slight crackling sound follows as he raises his arms in Harry and Blaizing Fire’s direction. The fabric of Harry’s costume slips from the villain’s grip, and both of them collapse back in their chairs once Alpha Bee completes the motion of tearing them apart.
For several minutes, Dracon doesn’t move. His chest doesn’t even seem to rise and fall with his breathing.
He only wears his under-mask; the identification mask clearly having been stripped from him. Also stripped from him is his costume—swapped out for plain white clothes.
He replays that moment over and over again and wonders why he didn’t take Dracon with him. Why Paper Dracon didn’t try to come with him. As more potential leads come up empty, Harry can’t help but blame himself.
“Hang on, with you having only one regret, why in Merlin’s name would you risk taking on more?”
’s in the middle of saying something to the Supervillain. “—and I know you’re probably very concerned. Being at the mercy of one’s enemy is hardly a comfortable position for anyone. So, it’s best you just tell us what you know.”
Lastly, they clean up the drinks. Ron calls dibs on the shot glasses; Harry grabs the quarter empty bottle of wine and places it on the shelf. Hermione’s always been a lightweight.
Alpha Bee says, “It was what they had found in the rubble in the affected flats. While there is the possibility that it belongs to one of the flat owners, the complexity and damage it’s sustained suggests it had a part to play in the attack that night.”
“There were multiple victims?!” Hermione gasps while Ron mutters, “bastards” under his breath.
“I don’t know what you could possibly have to say that’s so urgent.” He rests his hands at his hips and lets out a long breath as he looks through the window into the interrogation room. “But it seems like they’re just ending things in there; so, I suppose it won’t hurt. We’ll see what the heroes say when they come in.”
Malfoy’s gaze snapped to Harry’s face, his eyes as sharp as when he was alive.
He shrugs. “You don’t expect my paper attacks to work in the rain?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “No. Unless you bit it at this block of flats, I don’t see how you could be here at all. Aren’t ghosts confined to the area of their death?”
Winded and picking himself off the street, Harry chokes out, “Y-you . . . all right?”
Harry hums in agreement and then tunes out the rest of the conversation as it veers towards Acromium and the many questions Hermione has about the metal.
“Foolishness, more like. We, unlike you heroes, know not to grow attached to those who can’t handle themselves in a bad situation.”
His new plan involves climbing atop one of the crates and lying flat on his stomach. He considers it a stroke of luck that most of the men are still preoccupied with stopping the dangling crate from plummeting into the Thames. Harry turns his attention to the one he’s perched upon and fiddles with the latch next to his stomach. He draws up short of opening the lid due to an old-fashioned dial lock holding the flaps in place.
begging Voldemort to spare his son.
,” Dracon says.
Harry grimaces and shrugs his shoulder. “It is what it is. I guess I have to live with it if I want to be the most effective when I get back out in the field.”
Harry pauses a moment. “That was to wake you up.”
Finch-Fletchley stuffs his hands into his jeans pockets and purses his lips. “All right.” He steps aside and motions with his head. “Come on in.”
’s star-studded costume.
him?” Cho asks.
“I mean, I know you said before that it’s not good to be useless with your lot, but—it’s just.” Well, since he already opened his mouth, best to finish the thought. “Why would you come to a battle knowing you’d be deadweight?”
Justin nods and twists his pale hands together in front of him. “All right. So, Hannah, Ernie, and I were going through the park like we normally do on Fridays when a masked figure appeared off to the side. That person must have knocked us out because, the next thing I know, I’m waking up in a darkened room all tied up.”
“Hey, just because I’m a Supervillain doesn’t mean I lie about everything. If I did, it would make it that much harder to trick my enemies, right?”
Once it gets through to Harry what he’d said about Blaizing Fire, he lets go of Dracon’s hand.
“Would you believe me if I said we finally stopped paying taxes, too, and decided we might as well go all in?”
“Why the hell would you use that?”
When he slides the key into the lock of the mystery door, it fits perfectly. Bracing himself for what he might find, Harry shoves the door inward.
“So, you not only let the enemy escape, you
“Goodbye,
Alpha Bee claps his hands. “She’s been on a long trip all these years, and we’re delighted to have her return to us.”
Harry whirls back around to the reception desk. “I’d like to visit with one of the other victims, please.”
He jabs a finger at Harry. “You say that mockingly now, but whenever we’d
’s somewhere nearby!”
Potter somehow manages to draw further in on himself. “I-I didn’t ask—Nobody asked for—” He sounds hoarse and a bit small, yet defiant, and Draco wonders how he ever thought Potter didn’t quite sound like himself.
“Okay,” Harry says, shutting his notepad. “Thank you for taking the time to go over that again for me. Couldn’t have been easy for you, all things considered.”
“The Aurors searched the Manor and its grounds when you failed to appear for your Wizengamot hearing. They would’ve found you,” Harry said.
The Auror that had spoken to Mr. Hendricks before takes out his wand and waves it about, changing the lighting in the room. The effect is not quite what Muggles refer to as Blacklight, but a similar, surrealistic quality befalls the people in the room.
Almost like he’s afraid Harry will snatch the mask away should he move too fast, Paper Dracon slowly reaches out the hand cradled to his chest. Once Dracon’s fingers delicately wrap around the mask’s edge, he whips it back to himself, fast as any of Harry’s lightning bolts.
“Well, there was the occasional scuffle I had to deal with here in Shoreditch, and there was this bloke wearing a Harrow uniform following some ladies home, so I set a fog on him that should be wearing off,” she glances at the clock hanging on the wall, “in five minutes.”
“Local secondary school Superhero. And the London public—though some might say the Hero Order would be more accur—”
“Izulu. A Superhero.” Harry taps at the mask where the nurse’s line of sight is. “Helped out those folks. Before the emergency vehicles arrived.”
It is. Draco saw it when he came in.
“Even though it likely is?”
leaning over him.
Potter whips around so fast, he nearly trips over his own feet. The look in his eyes is wild.
“Just so you know, most of us have lost use of our . . . abilities due to that special device they’ve been perfecting. I hope this—” she waves the folded note “—accounts for that.”
Harry hesitates. As he silently stares into Nurse Tonks’s eyes through his lenses, her face falls. “It—That’s not quite it. I . . . .” He looks down to see his hands have balled into tight fists on the desk’s surface. Loosening his fingers, Harry settles on drumming them on the tabletop instead before glancing back up at the stationed nurses. “Each—Each hero . . . tends to have their own way of . . . protecting their real identity. The most commonly known way is, of course, wearing a mask of some variety—”
Ron’s arm slumps at his side. “All right, then.”
Harry snorts. “If only because they still had the other witnesses to get to. Lots of civilian victims to tell their side of the events.”
The stairs creak beneath his feet as he climbs. All the rooms on the first and second floors are frustratingly empty, and each one comes with an exhausting rush of anticipatory adrenaline that burns out the moment Draco finds them unoccupied. This cycle only adds to the creeping sense of being watched from the shadows. Being on edge means behaving stupidly, and that would put both Draco and the master of the house in more danger than necessary. Draco gives himself a shake as his hand lands on the banister of the final set of stairs which leads to a trap door above. He wars with the sudden reluctance that rises with his certainty.

“Yeah, you heard me. Look at me, you coward.”
“Oh, what could the Ministry want with my quaint old shop?” Mr. Eeylops blinks up at Draco with eyes magnified twenty times their regular size by his glasses.
“. . . Yes,” Harry says. “But before I passed out, I remember some letters on the side of the arm lighting up. They were
He starts to answer, but Harry shakes him a little.
That would put forward the notion that they'd done so before. Yet Harry doesn’t remember coming across any dead people with similar marks.
. We’ll hold off on that until the three of you are well rested.” The ease comes back into his mouth and eyes. “Now go tell the police what you know.”
He scribbles a meeting place and time on the back and sends it off to Potter before he can regret it.
Jolting backwards, Harry asks, “Why?”
thought
Harry’s heart pounds behind his ribcage as he stands just outside the interrogation room in the Hero Order’s main base. The Supervillain captured yesterday resides just on the other side.
As awkwardly phrased as that was, Draco gets it, and he hums his understanding instead of using words that could become twisted in his mouth. And even though he said just as much to Potter in their last meeting, it wouldn’t really be his fault should the vampire decide to go after another victim. Placing his saucer down, he pulls out his notepad and self-inking quill. “All right, Potter. Tell me what happened.”
handed him on the table. “Up for a game of cards?”
“Potter.” Draco takes a step forward, his mind scrambling to fit all these new pieces into the puzzle that appeared when he first interacted with Potter in that attic. “Potter, take my hand.”
Ignoring the curl of disappointment in his chest, Harry shakes his head—he can give Dracon that much.  Then he places the pieces of Paper Dracon’s costume on the floor—deliberately away from the blood puddle—and randomly grabs one of the larger pieces of fabric.
“You’ve felt guilty for so long over what happened to them, but Draco, they’ve been helping you this whole time! They’re trying to tell you it’s okay. It’s okay now. And, this is the last one—you must be close, so close, Draco.”
As Harry crawls to the stairs, trying to remember if he saw a lift anywhere when running around the building earlier, he realizes Dracon really did let him go.
It’s starting to crowd a bit around them as other customers become curious over the commotion. Some even call out their own greetings to Draco. The smile Draco plasters on his face feels more like a grimace the longer they stand there. But if his high society breeding is good for anything, it’s that it ingrained in Draco an ability to bullshit politeness.
Hermione and Ron reluctantly assent to the proposal, and Harry nods, not caring what’s for lunch.
“Besides, I have something special I’ve been saving up for ages.” He pats the pocket over top his heart.
“Which—! The bit where you suffocated me with confetti!”
The nurse on shift eyes Harry up and down. He fixates on Harry’s mask, just below the point where Harry’s eye lenses are located. “And you would be?”
She shakes her head and mutters, “Pass.”
He tells them he arrived after the explosion, rescued the remaining victims, and saw little else in the debris and smoke. Aside from the brief tidbit the injured teenager gave Harry, he has nothing else to provide the police.
’s soft voice whispers as he lifts the mask from Harry’s head.
Draco’s tongue flicks out, wetting his lips. “Dangerous to—” He aborts the thought halfway through, and, instead, jerkily nods before attempting to flee the alcove.
Fire scoffs, waving a hand in the air. “If you’d managed to capture him, I doubt you’d be in here with
She nods, eyes him up some more, and then lets him go. Harry’s glad that he thought to not specify the

As they dive for Harry and Ron, Harry attempts to shoot them with some of his lightning. Yet the birds remain as dexterous as their living forms, dodging each of Harry’s strikes with ease. Although, to be fair, Harry’s aim has never been that great with his own electrical energy. Still, he feels like he’s failed some kind of test when the birds reach him and Ron, driving sharp scrapes into the exposed skin on their faces.
“I know, Hermione. Believe me, I know.”
He struggles against the chains pinning him down for the first time and his right arm breaks free; the Aurors jump back and train their wands on him as his hand rakes desperate claw-marks down the table’s surface, knocking one of the photos onto the floor. “—to help me. Help me. Please, why won’t anyone
Both their heads snap around toward the Palace of Westminster as the flock of gargoyles rise out of the hole the villains entered through and start an arching wave of hell towards them.
anything! I should be able to make my daughter’s favourite dish without—without—” His other hand comes up to his mouth, and his teeth bite at his thumb.
“No! Don’t!”
“Easy there, mate.” Ron lifts his hands in a calming gesture. “We’re not here to hurt you or anyone else. We’re here to help.”
“Like the way you target and charm your victims?”
“Yes, yes. Now, let’s go before your mates are overtaken here.”
As Blaizing Fire stands back up, Harry prays he didn’t go all in on an empty hand.
“Harry?” Just as ghostly as ever and with his last peachick tucked in his chest hole, Draco seemed more real than anything else Harry had seen thus far, floating several meters away.
According to the witness, not everyone in the hostage group made it out. Dead bodies are still inside.
“Wait. Are you saying you missed me so much that you dedicated your ‘free time’ to researching about my alias?”
.............................................
Harry manages to shove the MP out of the way, but as a result, he and Ron don’t escape the full brunt of the car. It flings both of them off their feet as they’re propelled backwards by the force of the blow.
“O-oh?”
“Yeah, what else happened, mate?” Ron asks.
As Harry waits in a darkened room while the hours tic by, he thinks over how he could have behaved differently. Whether he should have taken aim at Prancing Peacock’s group when he had been on the roof. Or whether he should have let the building burn since most of the other heroes had gotten everything important out while the place had still been on fire. A thousand different paths not taken lay themselves at Harry’s feet in the dark, and Harry wonders which ones a good hero would have trod.
Pacing the room one last time, Harry discovers a particularly squeaky floorboard. He rocks on it, then taps it with his foot. Beneath it is some kind of hollow.
“What do you want?”
In the distance, he can hear what sounds like
staring down at him. That’s right, she’s been on the tele a few times.
Four ghosts other than Malfoy and his peachicks sat at Harry’s kitchen table: one, a girl in a Victorian nightgown; another, a pirate with half a beard; third, a giraffe of a man who likely looked more alive as a ghost; and last, a figure that was more amorphous void than ghost. All with various, detached, ghostly body parts floating at the center of the table.
Groaning, Paper Dracon rolls over and struggles to his hands and knees. He goes to lift his mask up—probably to spit out whatever blood’s collected in his mouth—when his head suddenly whips around to face Harry. “Motherfucker.”
Hermione gestures at Ron. “Well, you blowing up at them the last five times didn’t really help.”
Completely aware time is not on his side, he vaults himself atop the crate anyway. He dives for the lock at the same time a miniature paper crane lands delicately on his hand. Harry pauses.
“I told you!” Harry says. “It was just a light one! I didn’t put anything serious behind the first one.”
“Then, thank you for your help. May we meet again under better circumstances.”
In the next moment, the villain disappears from view. Part of Harry knows he should have tried to stop him, but the logical part of Harry knows he can barely lift himself off the ground, let alone fight a Supervillain.
Draco sighs and takes a piece of parchment from his robes’ pockets. “In his statement to the Department, Mr. Park said he had been dining with his attacker at an Italian restaurant before the walk home where the vampire had tried shoving him into a dark alcove.”
......................................................
Draco does his best to tune it out as he continues to pull Potter further into the room.
An echo of a scowl—still too blindsided to muster a real one, Harry supposed—flashed across Malfoy’s face, and he snatched them back to himself. He reconnected his left ring finger and his right ear, the parts merging back with his ghost body as though they had never been torn off.
“Well?” Dracon asks. “You going to sit down?”
“I know,” he repeats as he stares up into her wide eyes. “I know how hard it is to look in a mirror and see nothing.”
, a yell comes from his right. Harry twists his head around to see half a dozen guns pointing at him.
Draco lets go and takes a step back from Potter while they both take in his reflection.
Granger walks up to him and, maintaining eye contact, says, “Hello, Malfoy.”
?! No way would a villain trust his enemy to do that—unless you weren’t an enemy at all.”
“Malfoy did not upset Master Harry, did he?” If the elf had not dropped the honorific, Draco might have been able to dismiss the accusatory light in Kreacher’s eyes as a trick of his paranoia. But of course, just because he’d been allowed easy entry to the home due to ancestral connections did not mean that Potter’s House Elf would not be overprotective. After all, Potter had just been through quite the ordeal.
Draco pulled himself out from under Harry, his eyes not leaving his face the entire time. “Whyever would you do that?”
Potter’s sharp eyes dart back and forth between Draco and Mr. Park. “Malfoy, I don’t understand.”
“As difficult as it might be for you to believe, I didn’t choose to take this case, either.”
If Harry didn’t know any better, he would think the villain had felt uncomfortable with Harry looking at him. “How’s the leg?”
Harry sucked in a sharp breath. “Are those...?”
Dracon cranes his head up, so Harry assumes the prick’s looking at him. “Which bit?” he asks thinly.
Ron’s fist clenches. “Then we’ll just have to find out what they’re planning.” He storms out the door to the corridor.
A sudden thought stills his hands as he nears the top of the break. “That night, when I found you just off of North Circular Road—” the leg tenses beneath his hands “—did you happen to fall off your swan after running away from me?”
“And that’s when you were bitten?” Draco asks gently.
, he must be crying again.
Harry cuts off the thought as he realizes that Paper Dracon doing so would be more of a threat than a sign of relaxation. He wonders if Dracon is purposefully keeping his hands away from his pockets to ease Harry, before cursing himself for thinking it.
. And, yes, it will. What did you think the price of treason was? At least this way, we’ll get to preserve his powers and continue to use them to our ends. After all, it would be such a waste to lose such talent—”
“...Or that one ghost being mostly a black void?” Harry guessed.
“I truly am sorry, Harry,” Hermione said into the stillness.
“Piss off.”
all right?” He’s brought a hand up under his mask, presumably to rub at his face. His shoulders still shake. “Ah-
Shielding his lenses from the rain, he judges the distance between his current roof and the next to not be insurmountable. He takes a running jump, the upper half of his body making the gap perfectly. Latching hold of the slick roof edge, he hauls himself over. No one stands on this roof apart from him. He walks until he stands at the far edge again. Two buildings over—
He swallows as Potter makes eye contact. “You didn’t have control over what happened to you, but you control what happens next, Potter. So, who do you consent to becoming?”
—I took some advice that was given to me by a friend. Basically, I didn’t push it when someone said they didn’t want my help.” He glances down at his hands. “As someone who tries every day to be a good hero, it was hard—not rushing right in and aiding someone. But it was necessary.” Harry lifts his head again. “After I started to leave, I guess he had second thoughts—or maybe realized I meant it? —and called me back.”
