"Of course. If you don't mind, I was hoping I could do the same for you. You did lie to Voldemort about me being dead. If it weren't for that, I think I would actually be dead right now."
"I helped your dad and the others get out of Azkaban. I need them to make sure my plan works. I need to get all of the Death Eaters into Azkaban so I can 'come back to life.' And the only way I can do this is by having your father and Dolores and Yaxley and Fenrir."
I might do a sequel. It won't be coming out now if I do it, but I will possibly work on it if I get a lot of ideas for a sequel and I feel like it. If I decide to do one, I will announce it. So keep and eye out for that because it could happen.
Draco thought of Harry and tried to apparate. He ended up outside of a club in what looked like muggle New York City. Draco saw the sign that said he needed an ID so he made on and quickly got into line.
It had only been few days since I had last seen Draco, but the ministry had finally chose a date for the trial.
"Know what, I don't need to explain myself to you. It's not like I'm asking your permisson to be friends with him. Think what you want, Ron."
Harry, starting to actually get annoyed, stood up and walked into the kitchen. He waved his wand and a kettle filled with water and the stove turned on. As the water started to boil, he heard Draco walk into the kitchen.
He thought about his first, and only, love. He though about all the times his love crossed his mind. He thought about what he would do if anyone found out. What he would if they saw each other. If someone said the name. Mentioned the family. Looked familiar.
I stood up and told my mother that I had somewhere else I needed to be. She understood and didn't stop me from quickly leaving the mannor.
Luna and Neville: I know they weren't mentioned, but they deserve to be. Luna and Neville ended up together! (YAY!) They had four kids, Lillian Longbottom, Lysander Longbottom, Nolan Longbottom, and Nevaeh Longbottom. Lillian is the oldest, being 15 and in her fifth year at Hogwarts. Nolan is second in age and he is 13 and in his third year at Hogwarts. Nevaeh is next in age and is 11, going into her first year of school. Lysander is the youngest, and he is 9, and will enter Hogwarts with Iris Goyle.
"I did. At the family reunion, I tried to find you and I did. It was when Harry was crying and you were trying to help. I heard everything you said to him. I saw you kiss him. I didn't know if you wanted me to know or not, so I decided that since you are an adult, I'd trust you and let you make your own decisions."
"If anything happens to you, I'm going to kill you." Harry threatened once they reached Ron and Hermione.
After a second, Harry had completely gotten the hang of it. Draco, on the other hand, had already fallen.
Draco thought he saw a familiar head of hair leaving the bar. He watched as the head went onto the dance floor and started dancing. He watched as another guy came up next to the head and started dancing with him. He watched as the two started to sexily dance together. Finally, the head turned around and Draco could see his boyfriends face.
One short car ride later, the family arrived at King's Cross, walking quickly through the train station and onto Platfrom 9 3/4.
"It's okay, Cho. It's not your fault. Just go home and lay down and try to relax and figure out if you can peice any of this together. Okay?"
"Okay. The people we just saw were Leta Lestrange and my Granny. Now according to this, my Granny was Late's squib cousin. This means two things, I'm a half-blood and I'm related to the Bellatrix Lestrange. And that means, I'm related to Draco Malfoy!"
"She proposed," Harry started, "that we go back in time to when things were better so we could forget everything for awhile."
"How do you feel about Hermione coming to your family reunion, thing, with us?" Harry asked Draco when he saw him later
Harry pointed in the direction and Draco started walking slowly, making sure Harry was with him the whole time. Once the two got outside, Draco grabbed Harry's hand and apparated them back to his house.
"Well, I love making potions but if I worked at Hogwarts, I'd be away from you almost all year. On the other hand, I really like being a seeker but it seems so grueling."
"I heard what you said. And I saw the way M-Draco handled it. I-I'm sorry for what I said earlier. I just didn't think Draco was capable of feeling emotion. No offence."
Draco pulled away from Harry long enough to push himself inside the younger. Harry whimpered, his ass hurting from Draco pushing into him raw.
"Good. Narcissa, go back home. As for you," the man started, turning back to the escaped convicts. "Back into your hiding spot."
"Ron, you might not like this, but you don't. Hermione doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. She just wants to be friends. You can't try to force her to do otherwwise."
"Hermione, he has to be telling the truth. He would never, ever say he'd use Veritaserum if he didn't mean it." Ron said.
Inside, the boys had no clue they were being watched. They were too busy talking and giving each other occasional kisses.
"Did I miss something? This makes significantly less sense than all the other stuff you usually stay."
"Draco!" Harry half whined half yelled as he started running towards his boyfriend. He shot spells at whatever Death Eater got in his way.
As Harry began washing the dishes, Draco slid his arms around Harry's waist, pulling their bodies close to each other.
Draco sighed and brought his hand to Harry's head and ran his fingers through his hair. He lifted Harry's face enough for him to be able to kiss his forehead. Draco continued to do this until he didn't hear anymore sobs coming from his boyfriend. Slowly, Draco lifted Harry's face all the way up.
Despite this, one thing still tugged at his heart. He couldn't stop thinking about it as he made his way to the Gryffindor Common Room.
"She had one in our third year.She was in too many classes and she couldn't make it to all of them so McGonagall gave her a time-turner so she could get to all of them."
"Good. She's outside that door. You can get to work." Harry started to walk out as Kingsley said, "Ron, you'll be with Ramilda Vane."
Ginny awkwardly laughed, gaining the attention of everyone, including Hermione's, even though she already knew the answer to the question.
The door handle twisted and the door opened. Outside stood my boyfriend. Lots of different looks went across his face when he saw me. Worry, relief, happiness, confusion.
I also feel the need to point out that I did my research. I looked up Water Parks in London and found that so, everything you read is 100% accurate.
"Stupefy!" he yelled when he rounded the corner. Draco flew across the kitchen and slumped against the wall.
"Here is the food Master requested." Kreacher said. "Kreacher has made fresh bread for an appetizer. Salmon, scallop, and lobster scampi for the main course. And a Strawberry cheesecake for dessert."
"Oh, well, no. I haven't visited Lucius recently. No one has brought him up to me ever since the trial. The only time I have really heard anything about him was at the family reunion, when they were asking you about the trials. Other than that, I have nothing else I could tell you."
"I can't anymore! I'm not a mudblood! My grandmother was a squib and related to Leta Lestrange! That means I'm a half-blood and I'm related to Draco! But am I terrible!? Was Tonks terrible!? Was Sirius terrible!?"
"He said he'd use Veritaserum. Why would he say that, knowing that you could very possibly take him up on that offer, if he was lying?"
Harry glanced attentively at Draco's profile. The blond had stopped in front of a stall and pushed the latch of the sliding gate aside so they could enter. Inside the stall was only one pony at the moment. It had a reddish coat and a long mane that was just as red. Harry walked a few steps towards Hetja and stroked her gently across her fluffy neck. The mare snorted softly and nudged Harry with her nose.
By now Harry could admit that he truly liked riding a horse. But riding his scooter through the empty streets in the afternoon sun, feeling Draco's body against his and the wind in his face had something magical about it. Harry rode more carefully than usual, Draco was precious cargo after all and it was doubly worthwhile to pay attention to the traffic rules.
"Fuck," Draco hissed and sat up hastily on his chair. "Just keep your mouths shut, I'll deal with this."
"I never said that," Harry assures them. "I just mean that I could’ve done without the owl on Sunday."
“Where do you want to go? Or are you just living up to the reputation of the broom cupboard again?” asked Ron, who was lying on his bed and watching Harry amusedly. Hermione, who was sitting at the edge of Ron’s bed, was gesticulating in the air to show Harry in which direction he should turn so that she could see him from all angles.
He owes an aborted training and two failed relationships to the dark thoughts of his mind. Well, to be more precise, he owes his aborted training to the nightmares, the breakup with Ginny to his inflexibility and the ruined relationship with Jace to his lack of trust.
Draco suspiciously eyes the book Harry holds out to him as soon as he has resumed his seat. "Faust?"
An indefinable growl, probably Draco, who was inferior to his predator instincts, filled the room and gave Harry goosebumps. Oh god no, he wasn’t allowed to get turned on by
Hermione sighed and touched Harry's arm. "When you talk to him... He's had some bad experiences, it's –"
Harry didn't dare to open his eyes but he could feel Draco's body heat, the hair tickling his cheek as soon as Draco was at eye level with him. Harry's lips found Draco's, he desperately sucked on his tongue, felt his legs tremble with anticipation. Draco's free hand found Harry's cheek, he caressed it soothingly and then Draco pressed a finger against Harry's hole and sank into the depth.
"Let’s do this then," Harry said, plopped the rucksack onto the meadow in front of him and began to look for the necessary tools inside. Out of the corners of his eyes, he could see Draco sitting down on the ground between long blades of grass. "You're not going to help me, are you?"
“Well, it’s a reasonable argument,” Ron remarked, but then he noticed the reproachful look of his girlfriend. “…I would have said, if the situation wasn’t so serious and jokes weren’t completely inappropriate,” the redhead added in a hurry.
There was a hint of reproach in his voice alongside the sneer. I heard myself huff. "A conversation that led nowhere because you refused to answer my questions."
. Quite literally. Only a skin-tight, coarse-meshed net with a diamond-shaped pattern covered or rather exposed the areas that had just been hidden by the shorts.
is a surprise. Harry frowns and continues to stare at the now locked door. He would have placed bets on the fact that Healer Isaksen had set Jimar to keep an eye on Harry and Filly.
Harry shakes his head and shifts uncomfortably in his chair. "That's all I know. But you can ask Jimar about her, he should know her full name. Jimar Waters is one of your men, isn't he?"
That much should already be clear to those present. Harry may have deliberately chosen to portray the conflict as more of a discussion, but he senses that Isaksen sees through his story.
Frustrated, Harry runs a hand through his stubborn hair, kicks the leg of the desk and curses under his breath. The idea was ludicrous anyway, of course, the diary is not lying around unprotected in Jimar's office when not in use. His overacting does not help Malfoy or himself.
"You don't have to like me or trust me. Merlin, you don't even have to exchange a word with me. Just give me –" Harry falters and his gaze darts briefly to the side, where he catches sight of Healer Isaksen out of the corner of his eye. "Just give
He does not want to return to the time when panic attacks and nightmares were part of his everyday life and even the slightest disruption caused him to feel nothing but loss and pain. Leaving the Aurors behind, building his own everyday life – that helped to break free from that time. He had to fight hard for the sense of certainty in which he always seems to float. He cannot risk old times catching up with him.
"He was free. Too free," Draco continues in a low voice, not taking his eyes off Harry. "He thought that no cage could conquer him. All he wanted was freedom and he lost himself in it. Until it was taken from him."
Gingerly, Harry slides his arms under Draco's slender body, which clearly displays signs of lack of movement and physical weakness. He sags limply in Harry's arms, his head sinking weakly against Harry's chest.
Ron joins them in the afternoon. He promptly took care of the ownership of the Cloak of Invisibility and the Stone of Resurrection at the Ministry. All that is needed is a small signature on two documents from Harry and Draco and then Draco is the sole owner of the two Hallows. Harry does not hesitate before signing. Draco follows suit, but only after giving Harry a long, almost questioning look.
"So, I thought you didn't like the idea of people owning house elves?" Draco said once he and Harry had left the kitchen.
Rodolphus' chest burst open and blood started going everywhere. Harry dropped his wand when he realized what he just did. Draco looked at him wide eyed from the ground. Hermione got out of her seat and stood next to him, partially shelding him. Draco stood up and grabbed Harry's wand. He grabbed Harry's wrist and pulled him away from his family, Hermione following right behind them. They returned to their 'hiding spot.'
"Draco, stop apologizing for stupid things you did at school. I understand. We hated each other. Everything is fine."
"I didn't come over because I found out they want to you and your family in Azkaban. I spent the last two weeks trying to get them to reconsider. They didn't agree to not put you in, but they're going to do a trial now. They're still deciding on a date."
Harry quickly brought his fork back to his mouth and tried the food. His eyes widened and he dropped his fork. He heard his boyfriend laughing. Harry shot a glare at him.
The slide continued and there were blue lights all around them. Draco slowly loosened his grip on Harry's hand, starting to enjoy the ride.
Harry and Draco: They got married and they are now Harry Potter-Malfoy and Draco Potter-Malfoy, since neither one wanted to give up their last name. They have three kids, James Sirius Potter-Malfoy, Aurora Lyra Potter-Malfoy, and Lily Alya Potter-Malfoy. James is 13 and in his third year. Aurora is 11 and in her first year. Lily is 8 and can't go to Hogwarts yet.
Harry lifted his head back up to see his boyfriend smiling at him. Harry couldn't help but smile back.
"Draco... You know I'm not at these kinds of things. Please stop being a hard headed prick and accept my apology."
While Harry talked, I saw his sadness disappear. The glimmer in his eyes came back and he started talking with his hands again. I smiled when I saw all of his sadness was gone. And, I may be crazy, but I think he noticed. His smile widened as he held eye contact with me.
"For seven plus years, you've been spending all of your time with us. I think that speaks for itself." Ron spoke up.
"I don't know. Be a seeker but set up a room somewhere in the house for you to brew potions and shit."
Draco put on a grey, fitted, t-shirt button up shirt and black jeans. He put on a basic pair of black shoes to match
"I-I don't know. This all just seems too perfect. Like, the Malfoy's have ties to this. Harry has ties to this. Who ever planned this really did put a lot of effort into this."
"Because, I wanted to take you out on a real date. Not just random things in the muggle world. A date. Where we can be us and as gay and lovey dovey as we want."
At this time, Harry and Hermione were making their way towards Draco's house. Draco was thinking about the last time he saw Hogwarts. These days, this is what Draco did with most of his free time. Although, it wasn't ideal. When he thinks about Hogwarts, he thinks about the Final Battle. When he thinks about the Final Battle, he thinks about Harry defeating Voldemort. When he thinks about that, he can't stop thinking about the green eyed boy he had bullied all through their time at school.
"What? You can't leave! You're all I have left! I lost Corvus, my mother, my father, Newt. I can't lose you to. And you're a-"
"But look at my boyfriend! He's too cute not to cuddle!" Draco whined, causing Harry's face to burn pink.
Without missing a beat, Harry started throwing spell after spell at the Death Eaters. Draco followed in suit, the four of them managing to decrease the number of people they were fighting. Suddenly, Draco heard Harry grunt. He turned his head just in time to see his father desperately trying to hit Harry with the killing curse as Harry rolled out of the way, narrowly missing each spell.
"He usually just tells me about work. He'll make us food and we'll eat it together. We, uh, cuddle on the couch. Sometimes we fall asleep so he'll stay the night."
"You're mom lied. When Voldemort tried to kill me in the Forrbiden Forest, he sent your mom to make sure I was dead. When she felt my heart beating, she asked if you were okay. I told her you were and she told Voldermort I was dead. If it wasn't for that, lets just say things wouldn't have played out the way they did."
Harry quickly showed me how and I think I did what he told me to do. When I was done, I turned around to see him putting bread in the toaster. I went behind him and wrapped my arms around his waist.
I apparated to my house and sat down on the couch, bringing me knees to my chest. I took another deep breath and tried to stop the anxiety building in my chest from bubbling over. Something didn't feel right.
The Golden Trio got to their floor and made their way to Kingsley's office. They found the door already open so they walked right in.
Draco handed Harry one of the plates, smiling sheepishly as Harry took a huge forkful of spaghetti and shoved it in his mouth.
When the boys finally pulled away, they immediately got red, realizing what happened. Although they were embarrassed, they couldn't take their eyes off each other.
"Ron, I don't think we're working out. It's not that I don't like you. I just, don't like you romantically. I preferred it when we were friends."
Harry pulled the towel away from Draco. Draco's length sprung out Harry could feel it hitting his hole. Harry let a muffled moan out into the kiss.
"I don't know. You thought I was lying. I had to do something to show you I wasn't and make you shut up. That was just the first thing that came to mind. Why? Did you not like it? Was it-"
Harry felt his boner grow in her pants and his face got red and Draco just continued to eat. Harry looked down at his boner and his face got even more red. He looked up at Draco to see his eyes already on him and a smirk on his face. Somehow, Harry's face got redder and pants got tighter.
"I'm a prick that you should probably be nice to if you want to get fucked." Draco said, still smirking as he toyed with the zipper of Harry's jeans.
And if this isn't enough, his life was on the line. If Draco hadn't done exactly what he was told, he would've been killed. Now, I don't care what you might think now. I can guarantee if any of you were in Draco's shoes, you would've done exactly what he did. I know I would've. So why exactly is Draco going to be sent to Azkaban, again? He was practically forced against his will. So, we're sending him there because his name just happens to be Malfoy? Really?
Once Harry had finished his tea, he set the cup in the sink. With one last look at Draco, he apparated back to his house. He quickly went into his room and put on clothes that would be normal in the muggle world.
"Clearly, no one filled you in on anything that went on at Hogwarts while Mr. Potter was there." Kingsley said, whisking the girl away.
"I was scared. I didn't know what him, or anyone, was gonna do. That was the first thing I could think of that would scare them off. And then, after I did it, I remembered just how bad it was, the spell. And then, I remembered that I used it on you. I did that to you, Draco. I almost killed you. And, you're here, loving me, and I haven't treated you right. Hermione was right. You shouldn't like me after I did that to you. But you do. And then I used that spell right in front of you and now you probably hate me because you realizing how bad I am for you. I cause trouble everywhere. Fuck, it's my fault the second war even happened. And now I have PTSD and anytime there's any danger I freak out and over react. And-"
"I don't know. I'm sorry, Harry. We shouldn't have told anyone about you and Draco." Hermione responded.
"She is being serious. Harry's dating Draco. They've been together for a decent amount of time, now. They started talking almost directly after the war." Hermione said.
Draco sat around doing for some time, trying to figure out what to do. Draco apparated away and went to all the places he knew Harry like. He didn't find Harry anywhere. He apparated back to Harry's house, hoping he'd be back, and found nothing. Draco had no clue where Harry was. He let his boyfriend leave while he was mad at him and now he couldn't find him. Draco felt dread take over him as he realized how bad the situation was.
"So, you three have different things you need to today. And, to get more done, you will be split from your normal partner or groups so your tasks get done more efficiently." Kingsley Shacklebolt said to the golden trio.
"Nothing much. I've been spending a lot of time at home with my family. We lost Fred and Ron is working now, so I've just been spending as much time as I can with my family."
"Right." Hermione said. "Anyways, we ended up going back in time. Except, it had had been awhile sense I had handled a time-turner."
"Calm down. Just take her to Paris, enter the wizarding world, take her to a café, and don't do anything stupid." Harry said.
It had been a few weeks since Narcissa and Draco had talked about him and Harry. Narcissa was actually very happy for Draco and supported the relationship completely. Draco and Harry had continued to go on their dates in the muggle world.
"I don't think you had anything to do with it! But you just saw you're mom last week and I-I was just wondering if she said anything that could be fishy. O-or if you visited your dad in Azkaban recently and he hinted at something being up?"
Slowly, Draco stared moving his hips in an attempt to loosen his boyfriend. Harry moaned and whined under his boyfriend.
"I'm trying to figure stuff out for work. There has to be something we're missing, but we can't figure it out."
"He's an Animagus, he can escape way too easily. Make sure you get the dementors to put him in an air tight cell, no chance of him escaping." Harry said to the new Auror that was standing next to him.
Finally, Harry decided just to go to a park. They settled on a date a few days from then and Harry left.
"So, you finally got Potter on your side?" my father asked a few minutes after Harry and my mother entered the trial room.
None of them noticed Narcissa Malfoy hiding behind a tree, eyes wide with the information she had just heard.
"Aurora, Iris, c'mon. The train is leaving soon." James said, ushering the two first years foward and onto the train.
Draco quickly spread his boyfriend legs open and lined himself up. Knowing how tight he would be, Draco slowly pushed himself into Harry. Harry couldn't suppress the groan that came out of his mouth. He felt so much pain in his ass, he wasn't sure that he would be able to find it pleasureable.
My jaw clenched, but I only held on to the frame of the closed door to resist the urge to strangle Malfoy. "I didn't say it was for personal reasons. Just that I'm not an Auror. Was that your question?"
"Was it your question whether that was my question?" returned Malfoy dryly, and my fingertips tingled ominously.
A faint laugh from Draco indicated that the question was probably as silly as Harry thought it was. “Of course, Harry. Of course,” Draco replied anyway, even though it was lost in an extensive yawn.
And then Harry kissed Draco's cool fingers, pressed them to his lips, and when he let go, he nodded.
She is not tired, not physically at least. As a Healer at St Mungo's Hospital, she is quite used to such shifts. They may not occur regularly, but frequently enough for her to put up with them from time to time. The only factor that tires her at this point is the hand of the clock refusing to move forward. Or it is the fact that Mr Potter is now sixteen minutes late and she is stuck in a room with Aurors who are about as excited about her presence as the other way around.
After a few rounds of Ginny and Seamus shouting some completely unhelpful comments at him, Draco let Harry ride by himself. It wasn't hard, after all, Hetja only walked and Harry didn't have to do anything except keeping himself on the horseback. Ron seemed to find this more difficult. Baldur was a much smaller and narrower pony than Hetja, the redhead looked more awkward than he actually was. It was funny though, which Ginny especially commented loudly. Maybe it wasn't so bad that there was no actual riding instructor present, with all finger giving.
Quietly they tell each other about long-gone days, ask about trivialities like their favourite kind of tea and indulge in reveries of another life. They refrain from talking much about the future, it seems so far away. Draco only wants to know if Harry plans to ever return to Hogwarts.
"You should leave now," Malfoy said tonelessly, his posture unchanged and tense. "And don't return until you can explain to me why you're the one who gets to decide whether I'm telling the truth or not."
Instead, he looked past Draco and struggled for the right words. “I – listen, I have this insatiable need inside me. My
Draco, like the rest of the group (except for Ron, who had heard this talk enough already), looked at Harry with perplexity but amusement. "I see. Sounds...
had a girlfriend?" Theo asked, impressed, and Ginny laughed out loud for five minutes straight about it. Ron kicked her three times against the shin, but he didn't feel genuinely offended. Especially since Hermione gave him amused looks and then whispered something into his ear that made Ron blush.
Several hours had passed since the obstacle course, which Harry had passed with lunch and lying on the lawn by the paddocks, chatting to Neville, Luna and Ginny. Around late afternoon Pansy had joined him and dragged him to the riding hall. On the way there the young woman had once again convinced him of her eagerness to talk. But it proved to be very enlightening, and Harry had learned the most irrelevant information about Draco within the shortest time. This included his favourite tea (peppermint), his favourite movie genre (arthouse movies, preferably in French. The bloke really couldn't get any more pretentious) and his favourite candy (chocolate, "but not the one with peanuts, unless you’re trying to kill him."). Like a sponge, Harry had absorbed the newly gained information, the walk to the riding hall had felt almost too short. There, Ron, Hermione and Blaise had already been waiting for them. By now all five of them stood behind the fence on the spectator stands of the riding hall and watched what was going on in the arena.
?“ Ron turned his dumbfounded expression from Harry to his girlfriend, who was struggling to keep from laughing. Harry simply hoped it was the comedy of the situation that amused her and not his lack of sex appeal.
He blew his chance with the Ministry when he chose to ignore all the letters and Filly's meaningful glances. The Aurors were after an objective and Harry was a convenient means to an end. They gave him time, more time than they usually would, but Harry did not play along. And now he must pay the price.
Malfoy eyed me, possibly just making sure I was standing firmly on both feet, then he pulled his hand away again and took a step back. "People get older, Potter. This may be news to you, but for some, it actually has the effect of expanding their horizons."
Hermione poked him playfully annoyed in his upper arm. "Don't be mean!" Ron continued to give Harry an uncomprehending look, he had meant the question completely seriously.
But just now Harry wasn’t angry, he had every right to be angry, but he wasn’t. At most he was annoyed that these irritating looks didn’t leave him alone, but he didn’t feel any negative feelings towards Draco. In reality, he was worried. Worried about how he should deal with the Slytherin now and how he could explain to him that they still had to sleep with each other within the next few days.
Draco just grinned contentedly, then turned to go further inside the bathroom. He stopped at a washbasin and opened the tap. Harry watched him, fascinated. How would Draco avoid touching the water? But Draco didn’t seem to intend to transform himself, for he raised one hand and directed it at the jet of water that rushed from the tap. With a flick of his wrist, a bludger-sized bubble of water gathered in the air in front of him, which then glided, following Draco’s hand movement, to a couple of locker-like doors embedded in the tiles. The water bubble enclosed the opener of one of the locker doors, which caused it to open. Harry didn’t recognise the content in detail, catching a glimpse of towels and a toothbrush, which the water bubble had encircled, and brought unerringly to Draco. Careful not to touch the water, Draco held his toothbrush by a small dry portion and let the water bubble pop in the sink in front of him.
The Slytherin Dormitory lay dark in front of him. He could hear the quiet breaths and soft snoring of the others but paid them no attention. Greenish light shone through the round windows of the dormitory, and every now and then a shadow was cast over the room. The lake didn’t sleep at night.
“Wait a minute, what… what are we doing?” Harry asked while he pushed Draco away a bit, breathing heavily.
“You didn’t want to seduce Hermione and Ron, but they tried to seduce you. They were completely devoted to you.” Harry noted and watched Draco’s fingers as they began to gently stroke his own hand.
quickly. This surely had something to do with the fact that he hadn't been attacked from behind and he could actually see what Harry was doing.
"You're here because you're quite a handful to save," Harry replies, achieving what he had hoped for: Draco looks at him.
Draco's eyes found mine. No one had ever looked at me the way Draco did at that moment. Full of affection and sincere vulnerability, Draco bared more than just his body. A smile invaded his lips and he kissed my worries out of my mind.
"Sure. But you'll have to hand me your Herbology essay in return." Malfoy grinned. "I won't do anything without the right payment!"
“It's not polite to stare, Potter,” Draco remarked, his smile resonating in his tone. Harry raised his head; Draco wasn’t even looking at him. How embarrassing.
That night, he was denied an opportunity to find out more about Draco's past and the consequences of that. They found three more sheets of paper with letters written on them, fled the woods bursting with laughter as a deer crossed their path and returned to the farm. The other grouplets were equally as successful and they even found the treasure chest, with an unhealthy amount of sweets in it. Draco was more enthusiastic about it than most, the glow in his eyes gave Harry more than he needed to give Draco more time. Harry would soon learn the truth anyway.
I noticed a swelling bruise on Malfoy's jaw, but he had completely regained his composure and returned my gaze calmly. "My diary. You are in my diary."
Harry's gaze fell on the seductive red lips. The only reason that stopped him from jumping at the blond here and now was the presence of his friends, which couldn't have been more teasing since they had returned from the hayloft to the guesthouse. It was as if the others had mastered the art of mind-reading and knew right away what they had been up to.
Draco also loosened the grip on Harry's upper arm, shoving one hand into the dark, unruly hair instead, the thrusts of his hips became harder and faster, his breathing more irregular. The kiss was long past the point of gentleness, their tongues and mouths almost desperately pressed against each other, begging for redemption that only they could give each other.
Harry looks from her back to Filly. "But this is going to be a one-off, isn't it? I'll go in there, figure out what the curse is and be done with it. Won't I?"
Now that Harry has done exactly what the Aurors hoped he would do, the very thing Harry was afraid of is happening, they consider the purpose of the diary fulfilled. They were never even remotely concerned with discovering anything about Malfoy's condition. But this is not surprising news to Harry.
"I don't know about this. I just can't think of any reason why Malfoy would put all that effort into protecting his diary from everyone, but then just allows Harry to read it. Makes little sense to me." Ron finally voices what has been bugging Harry for the past few days.
As if Harry's lips were a bloody magnet, Draco followed them, also sat up, kept his hands buried in Harry's hair and continued their kisses unhindered. Harry feverishly began fiddling with Draco's shirt buttons, keeping his eyes closed and anxiously hoping Draco wouldn't notice how much his hands were trembling. It took longer than usual to pull the shirt off Draco's shoulders, but when it was finally done, Draco freed his hands from Harry's hair, interrupted the kiss and quickly began unbuttoning Harry's shirt.
Harry frowns, but not a moment later, he realises what is going on. Isaksen has no intention whatsoever of giving up on Jimar. "I take it his state of evidence is sobering?"
"It's not," I interrupted him. "It still won't be enough for them. From the moment I chose not to dance to their tune, I forfeited my influence."
And Draco leaned in, not bothered by the presence of the others and kissed Harry. Gently and lovingly, not in any way impatient. Just grateful and pleased. Harry smiled into the kiss, raised one hand to Draco's cheek and let it rest there. The feeling was intoxicating. There was something overwhelming about opening up and being accepted.
Filly closes the diary, which no one in the room has touched since Harry's return, and pushes it neatly to the edge of the table as he pulls out a black briefcase with the Ministry seal on it, and places it on the table. "Once we know the protection spells are working properly, that can be easily arranged."
Draco became even tenser beside Harry. "No, there’s no time. Potter and I have to mend the fence of the paddock." Harry threw Draco a questioning look, but the blond kept looking at his father as if Harry wasn't even there.
Without opening my eyes, I slumped down on one of the sofas, relaxed against the soft touch of the fabric and enjoyed for a long moment only the memories that this feeling evoked in me. For a moment I heard nothing but the crackling of the fire.
I frowned, my hands in my trouser pockets growing fidgety, so I folded my arms across my chest and held on to my upper arms. "For not giving you the chance to explain yourself. And for being wrong about you."
Draco was the purest temptation and he knew that only too well. Still, he had fallen for Harry at least as much as Harry had fallen for him, so he responded to the friction, rhythmically moving his hips to Harry's lap, while casually conquering Harry's lips and mouth. Harry moaned greedily into the kiss, explored the straps and lace once more with his fingertips and made it his business to touch the skin under the straps.
'," Malfoy explained. "It expresses the idea of being content with what you already have and finding happiness within it. My mother had a habit of saying that and she lives by it like no other. It may not be ... perfect, but she believes in it. So firmly that I was once tempted to believe in it too."
“Well, the rumours about the two of them are still going strong. If you want, I could ask Seamus to –” At this point, Harry interrupted his best friend by shaking his head vehemently. Seamus didn’t need to know about any of this. He should just stay far away. Very far.
Draco opened his mouth to protest – he had just overcome the greatest danger of his life and Edward could think of nothing better than to reproach him!
Theo, Pansy and Blaise were a bit surprised at their appearance, but Blaise moved aside a bit to make room for them. Harry settled down with Ron and hurriedly looked around for Hermione. The brown-haired woman was sitting next to Ginny and Luna on the other side of the room, absorbed in a book. She hadn’t even noticed Harry and Ron's change of location.
Life is not fair. And yet, under these circumstances, Harry is forced to make a choice. He wishes he could muster the selfishness that would take all the blame away if he chose his own happiness. He wishes he could muster the selflessness to forget his own happiness and fight only for others.
I bit my tongue hard and crossed my arms to stop myself from losing my composure. I had not lost this battle yet. "You might tell yourself that, but that doesn't make it any truer. There are hundreds of cases that happened a long time ago that still need clarification. You just don't want to help."
It would have been too much for one person, the fascination took on dimensions that Harry couldn't understand. So Harry's mind did what it did best. It used the jam jar tactic. But in the most pleasant way, because instead of hiding his emotions from the world, his mind used the tactic to notice things about Draco. Things that everyone saw, but Harry
Without stopping the circling movement of his hips, Draco leaned back a little in Harry's lap to take off his shirt. It only increased the pressure on Harry's erection, he gasped in surprise and opened his eyes. Draco's naked chest was a sight worth every bead of sweat, Harry's fingers instinctively trailed to the slender waist, but Draco pushed his hands away impatiently.
Harry growled and bit into Draco's shoulder to hold him accountable for the comment. Only in the process did he notice the milky fluid pouring over his fingers, which still clasped Draco's cock. Pure relief joined the after-effects of his orgasm, although he felt the need to bite Draco again, simply because he managed to make Harry feel insecure like no one else.
Draco, but nice enough. First Harry let himself be persuaded to play basketball with Seamus, Dean and Ginny, later he played a round of chess against Ron, which he, of course, lost miserably. Then he watched Hermione, who tried to beat Ron (she didn't lose miserably, but she didn't win either) and then Harry sat with Luna and Neville in the meadow at the back entrance of the guesthouse and played their favourite songs on the guitar.
Draco sighed, then nodded in the direction of Harry's hands, which still lay motionless on his guitar. "Will you play something for me?"
. But speaking of which, do you think they'll be making purée de pommes de terre for lunch again soon? I could die for –"
"I'd forgotten you purebloods were so helpless," he said cheerfully. "Next time we'll do it together."
Unfortunately, Draco also looked striking as a human. Just as beautiful as he looked in his shiny-glitter form, which caused a strange tingling in Harry's stomach area. Just as he was thinking about subtly escaping the situation, the sound of the water stopped and Draco stepped to the edge of the pool. He wouldn’t –? And he did. The thin towel fell to the ground next to Draco's feet, giving Harry a clear view of Draco Malfoy's buttocks.
Maeve smirked as she entered the noisy kitchen and it only widened when she saw how her relatives stiffened. Though it seemed the daft woman hadn't noticed her brothers predicament. Green eyes twinkled darkly as the beady eyed wrench saw her, she waved mockingly at her.
Deciding that was enough, Maeve stepped in to make her presence known. "Pardon me, but you're in my way." As a Lady, she had to be polite unless, of course, she was provoked. And the idiot looked like someone who didn't know their limits.
Grabbing the books of her choice, she went to check them out before heading to a small secluded area to read undisturbed.
She nodded and did as told, Axehammer began speaking in a language she didn't quite understand and suddenly she was in pain. She tried to stay still and quiet but she couldn't suppress the bloodcurdling scream and soon she began thrashing. The pain was unbearable, never in her life had she felt like this.
Around nine, the Dursleys were finally up and ready. Which was good, she didn't want to punish them so early, wanting to save her energy. Besides, the train will leave around eleven, she'd very much not like to be late.
Finally done with her morning routine, Maeve stepped out with her things securely in her arms. Her eyes widen in surprised, the others were still asleep? Did they all sleep until the sun came up? She shrugged, their problem. She placed her dirty linen in her laundry basket and started on making her bed. Once done, she slipped on her shoes and grabbed her shoulder bag.
Tomorrow she'd see part of the magical community when she goes to pick up her supplies. She'd most definitely grab some extra things for herself. There was no doubt in her mind that she wouldn't practice on her own.
Maeve held her hand out, stopping the girl from rambling further. "First, what I would like to know is who you are and why you assume it is alright to call me by my given name?"
Maeve nodded in appreciation. "As soon as the healers have done their best at ridding everything and ensuring my health I'll reward each goblin who has helped me sixteen galleons. I would also appreciate it if you were able to get me a way to have direct access to my money without having to constantly return. If possible." The two goblins in the rooms mouth had dropped. No witch or wizard, no matter how much they helped, had offered them that much. Yes, Maeve Potter would be a valuable client.
They spoke together, finishing each other's sentences. She was really going to hex them if they continued doing that around her, giving her a bad headache. "Never do that again with me, and good. Where shall we meet when we speak?"
In total the cost would have been nearly two hundred Galleons if Maeve hadn’t casually mentioned the books that were about her and how it would be a shame if she went to this Ministry of Magic and hypothetically sued everyone who wrote about her and those who were selling the books, one of those places conveniently being Flourish and Blotts. Though for a reduced price, Maeve may keep the little bookstore out of the papers. The green eyed girl was going to sue everyone involved and make even more money but she would keep the shop out, it was part of the deal after all.
Maeve sighed, still quite peeved. "The whole little meeting with McGonnagal was a joke. She was merely vexed at the very thought of me supposedly disrespecting her during our first lesson. Brought Dumbledore and Snape, though the nasty git stayed quiet. Dumbledore tried to play his disappointed grandfather card, as if I cared what he or anyone else thought."
"Have a seat boys, we have much to discuss." Draco sat beside Maeve on her left side as he always did with Blaise on her right then Theo in between the twins. She pulled out parchment paper and a quill with color changing ink.
This time Maeve had her hand up, she could never pass up the chance to show off. "Miss Potter, would you be so kind?"
Everyone's eyes were on them. "Must you all stare?" Maeve asked dully, they all snapped their attention away and pretended to be interested in their food or the people around them. "Weasleys, if you'd prefer, you both are more than alright to sit with us." She said heading towards her table.
"What might that be?" Dumbledore asked, leaning slightly forward as though he were going to get an honest answer. He really ought to learn not to put his crooked nose in other people's business, it's awfully rude.
"Now, Ms. Potter, what you are going to do is throw this in and say clearly 'the ministry of magic.'" She nodded as she accepted the powder, he was letting her go first. "When you get there, please do not leave."
Minerva wanted to give her detention for class disruption, but the majority of the Slytherins present have parents on the wizards council and work in the ministry of magic. And they follow Potters lead so clearly that if she asked for one to tell their parents of what occurred in class, they'd have no hesitation in doing so. "Have a seat, Ms. Potter, class is beginning." She'd have to speak to Albus about this, Potter had a look of satisfaction on her face as she sat down. The two snakes gave her appreciative nods which she returned with a pleased grin.
His dark eyes glared hole into her head but she refused to acknowledge his presence anymore, he obviously wasn't worth her attention. He stiffly walked away, handing out the rest of paper before swiftly walking out the Great Hall. He could fell her calculative green eyes on him, they reminded him of the killing curse, the same shade.
No one made a sound, the silence was deafening. She saw how the old man leaned forward with narrowed eyes. Seems he was expecting something different. -Not today, old man- she thought with a smirk. She made her way towards her house table, Malfoy made space for her and gave her a smirk.
She recalled her next period being History of Magic with the Hufflepuffs. Hopefully they were more manageable, Ravenclaw was alright once she got them under her thumb. Hufflepuff might be a good house to snatch as well, they were said to be the most loyal.
Maeve nodded her eyes glinting in the dark cupboard as the light bulb she had went out months ago. Loki with his small size coiled around her arm.
She twirled her finger around her wand, 11" Holly wood and Phoenix feather, she thought back to what had taken place at Gringotts. There was people attempting to control her, and she was some kind of chosen one. Of course, she wouldn't allow it, but the thought of it occurring was amusing.
The teacher nods, her eyes unfocused. Maeve shakes her head in mock disappointment. "Say it, Mrs. Colt, say you understand." She whispers. "I understand." Her voice is almost robotic as she speaks. "Good." Maeve praises before walking back to her desk to get ready to leave.
Eyes narrowed at the minuscule owl, before reaching forward she grabbed the letter removing it from its talons. She unscrolled the parchment paper and carefully read the letter.
Maeve hesitated, she didn't know what to say. But the snake sounded so hopeful. Would the Dursleys be furious or... Wait! They'll be terrified. A smirk appears upon her face.
"Yeah, he works as the head of the misuse of muggle artifacts. Why is that relevant?" Fred responded with furrowed brows.
"We have a Charms next, right? With the Ravenclaws again?" She asked, she already knew the answer but she was getting them used to the need to always be prepared. She wanted them to not rely on a sheet of paper for a simple question.
She rolled onto her side and closed her eyes. Tomorrow was school, the last day till summer vacation. She needed rest as Dudley would soon start his favorite game again- the freak chase- honestly her cousin was horrible at academics and a huge bully.
"Be sure to stay awake. I don't care if this class bores you to sleep, because of Pansy's actions everyone will remain awake and take notes on whatever that ghoul says. Failure to comply and you will very well be standing beside Parkinson during her punishment sharing her pain, understand?"
"Sorry, love, didn't think it'd be this cold." Fred apologized. "Here, take this." He offered his scarf and wrapped it gently around her neck. His freckled face flushed as he realized how close he was to her.
An older man with greying hair stood behind the counter, eyes crinkling as he smiled at her. “Hello miss, how can I help you?”
She hissed with a pout, pink lips pursing in mock sadness, something Loki saw through yet he hissed in humor agreeing to his humans wishes. He agreed, her leaving and being away had drained him far more than it should have, most likely since they were transitioning to familiars rather than just pets and humans. Her lips curled in a soft smile once he nodded his small triangular head.
relatives and I was the only remaining one. Who would've thought I was wrong?" She chuckled, looking at the sky sadly.
"I wouldn't know, headmaster." She gave the fool a tight smile. "And I'm doing perfectly well in Slytherin, I fit in quite nicely. My housemates are very welcoming, so no need to be resorted." Maeve hid the smirk threatening to appear behind her smile, of course her snakes were welcoming. They knew better than to be disrespectful, especially to her.
Malfoy snickered softly, his face settling into a smirk. "That's alright, I wasn't paying much attention either. We should ask Zabini."
"Well Lucifer is a supposed myth, or perhaps people wished him to be a myth. Years after years new generations spoke of him, some with awe and some with fear. After all no self-respected witch or wizard would align themselves with the dark arts." He said the last part with such sarcasm it almost made Maeve laugh, but she was too invested in the story. "He had an affinity for dark magic, much like yourself, yes he could do light, but he was most powerful with dark. And because of that he was feared. The ancient and noble house of Morningstar was fading, Lucifer was the last of his line until he met your parents. James and Lily Potter agreed to let Lucifer blood adopt you to help save the Morningstar house in exchange for your protection. He complied. No one but the goblins and your parents knew what he truly was." Griphook stopped for a dramatic effect and it was working.
Draco sighed, with a small frown. "I hate that you're most likely right, about the majority of the adults here."
"First years, over here! First years!" Her eyes landed on the shouting man, she remembered him as the giant who stood in front of the leaky cauldron. She walked towards him alongside the other first years.
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
"Well, since we've finished eating, why don't we head to Charms?" Daphne said, standing up and smoothing off her skirt.
Flint scoffed as though the mere thought of getting on his knees for her disgusted him. Which thoroughly offended her, Maeve happened to believe she was a delight. Still she was willing to offer a second chance...that is until he opened his mouth once more. "Don't insult me by asking me to join a pathetic half-blood such as yourself." He spat, no one seemed to notice the slight fearful look on her three friends face as he spoke. "Besides, I doubt you'd make a good leader seeing as your father was a blood-traitor and your
Vernon swaddled down the stairs in a hurry as he heard his poor wife yelling at the burden that was left to them. The floor boards creaked loudly as he rushed into the kitchen, only to stop in bewilderment at the sight before him. The freak sat calmly at the table, in his spot, while Petunia glared at her. She glanced at him, her toxic green eyes glowing ominously.
She nodded in affirmative, continuing her walk towards the field. The Weasleys better have food with them, she was not going to starve for them. Loki rested his small head against her inner wrist, listening to her pulsing heartbeat and allowing it to soothe him.
-yeah, like I should be thankful for the stale bread crumbs and water. They say I'm the freak but what they're doing is child abuse and considered abnormal and unlawful. Should the police find out they'd be sent to prison.-
Loki nudged his human awake as he took it upon himself to her alarm, she hummed as she opened her eyes blearily, looking around in the dark room before her gaze fell on her snake. Maeve smiled as she stretched slightly, before her eyes widened and she sat up quickly. Today was the trial and she was going to meet her godfather for the first time in several years.
Her eyes widen as the wall separated, causing an opening to appear. Tom chuckled at the excitement on her face. If she wasn't so in awe she'd have hexed him.
"Did they get the answers they were looking for?" Draco asked as he piled some food on a plate for her. He thought his friend was much too skinny and needed to eat more.
A young girl, seemingly looking no older than 4 years old, sat on her knees in the blistering heat pulling out weeds from the garden in her aunt Petunia's backyard. A sheer, thin layer of sweat coated her forehead, trickling down and stinging her eyes. Thorns stabbing her palms and leaving small scratches behind.
George's eyes were blown wide at that implication. "Are you saying that your relatives, that they abused you?" He lowered his voice towards the end of the question.
§I'll be attending classsesss, would you mind accompanying me? I've been away from you much too long.§
"You're a very beautiful boy. Have you got a letter for me?" She said quietly, mostly speaking to herself as she untied the note and removed the package he carried. "Thank you." She gently patted down his ruffled feathers and handed him a piece of bacon. He hooted softly. Even as she took her mail the owl hadn't left, she shrugged leaving him be. She opened the letter first.
He glanced around as though waiting for her parents to suddenly appear before shaking his head and looking at Maeve. “Five Galleons.” His eyes widened when she pulled out her hard to pay and jaw dropping when she signed her name. “Maeve Potter.” He whispered her name as though she were some type of deity.
Having heard enough, Maeve walks in, stopping just behind Vernon. Petunia's eyes widen at the sight of her furious niece, Vernon hadn't noticed and continued ranting. "Surely you're not daft enough to assume I would be thankful to you lot for treating me like a slave?" She asked rhetorically.
Repeating the same action, she noticed how this stung slightly more then the first time. Lightly glowed once more before settling down. Griphook, who had been standing behind her, reached forward and took the blade from her and the towel that lay on the desk.
It was quite noticeable to all the professors how none of the Syltherins have moved to touch their food, instead opting to wait for their Slytherin queen to arrive. Severus watched with a sharp eye as Maeve sat down along with her friends and only when she gave a nod did everyone else began to eat. It seemed she had already established control, it went far beyond what he had seen in the common room and with her being the one in charge he could not speak to Dumbledore without being a social pariah as she essentially has more power then even him being the head of house.
Braxton hugged his thick wool coat tightly against his body. The night air blew harshly, the trees swaying in the wind. He trudged further and further into the unknown parts of the woods. His heavy breaths filled the silence.
"What has got you troubled, love?" Blaise questioned, concerned, coating his words and brows furrowing.
The library was a few blocks from privet drive, she had books to return and books to check out. She walked up the sidewalk leading to the entrance of the beautiful brick wall building, the cool air caressing her face gently. Smiling, she made her way down her favorite aisle- fantasy.
Maeve  sat beside Draco as per usual, chin resting against her palm as she listened to the ghost drone on about the goblin war. Why hadn't Dumbledore found a more competent teacher? Someone not dead, perhaps? She sighed annoyed and just pulled out the runes book she had checked out, she wanted to see why Blaise was so fascinated by it. So far it was actually interesting, there were runes for nearly everything. Protections, warding, rituals, etc. The list pretty much goes on.
She snapped her head as she heard soft hooting at her window, the owl from before! Loki used his tail to unlock the window, allowing the tawny, petite owl in. Maeve rushed forward, shaking hands approached the awaiting creature.
"Yes." Maeve answered monotonous, she listened as her aunt walked away and into the kitchen. The only things she had that were her own was her school uniform. Aunt Petunia was quite annoyed when she had to buy her a set because she could not wear a pair of Dudleys.
"He was an illegal animagus, his form was a rat. He cut off his finger, caused the explosion and transformed to get away."
She placed Loki gently on his warming stone, he sighed in content which had her smiling. At least he was satisfied, she softly rubbed his small head before walking to her bed. The package wasn't all that big, but she could feel the magic pooling out of it.
"I said stand aside!" She stayed in front of her child hoping, praying for some kind of miracle. She couldn't let her baby die. "Very well, then you shall also die! Avada Kedavra!" Lily Potter fell to the floor, lifeless green eyes staring at the ceiling.
Maeve nodded and waved goodbye, she continued her fruitless search. Where on earth could they be? When she finally found them, they were out in the court.
"Of course, professor." She walked elegantly towards a vacant seat and sat, crossing her ankles in an x motion. Green eyes watched as the other two professors sat as well. "Now, may I know why I was called? I have no memory of doing anything wrong."
She giggled, pushing a loose hair behind her ear, cheeks dusted a light pink. "Don't be silly. We're friends now, aren't we?" She asked bashfully.
"Well, go on. And have fun on you first Hogwarts experience." She waved goodbye as she walked in. Witches and wizards of all kinds just wandering around, they each felt different. Some dark, some light, and some in between.
With that, followed by her friends, she walked off towards the library for some peace and quiet. Or what would've been peace and quiet if they hadn't been intercepted by the Weasley twins, who had such wide grins that it fully disturbed the four first year Slytherins. "Hello love, may we just say that that was quite a show. Didn't know you had it in you to openly voice your distaste for ole Dumbledore." George said, a mischievous glint in his bright eyes. Fred cackled beside him, seeming to find the whole situation to be quite humorous.
The Hufflepuff students were already seated in the right side of the room, sitting together and leaving the left to the snakes. Maeve narrowed her eyes at the feline who was eyeing them as they went to sit, this obviously wasn't a regular cat because no normal animal had such expressive eyes. So, suspecting much she sent a glance to her snakes with a look advising they stay quiet and with a nod back she turned her attention to the cat that was now looking at her with narrowed vertical slit eyes. The green eyed girl merely raised a brow back.
She was so lost in her head she hadn't noticed someone walking her way until Loki hissed quietly, alerting her. Green eyes snapped towards the stranger who was approaching, dark eyebrows furrowed when she noticed it was merely professor Quirrell. He gave her a disarming smile but she could tell he wanted something.
"I'll also need to write about setting up the visit with my godfather, it would be wise to keep him in the loop. And to make sure he will be loyal only to me, I need to get there before Dumbledore does." Maeve said tapping a small pale finger against her chin. "Your father wouldn't be opposed to taking me out again, right?" Her venomous green eyes narrowed in on Draco who flushed at having all her attention on him.
Maeve pulled out her card and allowed the woman to pay, she then signed her name and smirked at the bug-eyed look she received. “This will be the last time I shop here, I very much hate when adults try and patronize me. I do hope you fix your attitude. Have a good day.” Grabbing and her things and walking out the door, it was tiring having to put up with exhausting people.
Maeve laid on the small mattress in her cupboard room. She curled her lips in disgust. -how disgusting that I refer this filth as my room. A person of my abilities should be treated like a queen and nothing less.- Her parasite relatives were fast asleep, she could quite clearly hear her uncle and cousin snore. Its a surprise that the neighbors don't complain. She rolled her eyes, of course they wouldn't complain. No one had a backbone to even bother standing up to Vernon. -disgusting pig. How can I be related to that creature?-
"She won't, if she dares open her mouth and reveal anything, well... Hogwarts will soon find itself with an opening for Head Deputy. I'll talk to her and ensure she stays silent. And as for little Weasley, well for his sake, he had better keep his mouth shut as well, I'm not above making him an example if he ever disobeys.
Several eyes widen at the foreign language she spoke, they all shared a cautious glance. Parseltongue was a very rare language that not many were able to speak, as only direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin. And the most known one was The Dark Lord, which begs the question who exactly was Maeve Potter? Loki bobbed his little head before retreating into the dark sleeves.
"We'll have to verify if your truly who you say you are." He spoke in a gravely voice, she idly wondered if others had tried to scam their way in to cause such procedures. Either way she agreed.
Draco was of course elated at the fact that his father agreed to help a dear friend of his, but he felt conflicted about what Dumbledore could have possibly mentioned to have angered the normally mild tempered girl. He had seen the fire in her eyes when she bought up the old man, he'd hoped nothing would cause her to do anything drastic as they were still on level one. Maeve was powerful and extremely intelligent, but the headmaster was older and more experienced. Draco would hate to have the short dark haired girl get in trouble by something so easily avoidable.
She'll make them pay, make them beg for forgiveness.  She'll have them on their knees, praying for death. But she'll let them live, because death would be mercy.
Professor Flitwick stood outside his classroom door and smiled at each student as he welcomed them in. He positively beamed when Maeve came through, she nodded at him politely and gave him a kind smile. The half-goblin was the one of the only professor's she truly respected, someone she'd defend because she knows he'd do the same thing for her. "Afternoon Miss Potter, please come in and take a seat."
Petunia glared as she marched away, her hand gripping Dudley's meaty arm. Maeve slipped away before Mrs. Colt could notice her. She giggled all the way to the library.
She narrowed her eyes as Maeve smiled innocently while heading to the kitchen. The little brat was up to something, she just knew it. Petunia walked away, she had to wake Vernon, her poor was husband was exhausted. He had to work late and then the freak went and broke her favorite teacup, so he had to punish her.
"Mom!" He wailed, Maeve snorted humorlessly. The fat baby walrus stomped his foot on the ground, the floor shaking slightly. Of course his tiny brain thought a tantrum will get him his way. The dark haired girl sneered in disgust, she was done being pushed around and intimidated. Now it was their turn to beg and scream in fear.
She grabbed books that talked about the Magical Law and Wizarding Government and what it pertains to. Another book about the The Statue of Secrecy detailing the law forbidding the exposure of the existence of magic to the muggles, books on Wizard rights, Traditions, Magical Duels, Crimes and Restrictions, Underage Sorcery, and on Blood Purisms. She would very much like to be prepared.
Draco added a pumpkin pastry to the practically overflowing plate before handing it over to Maeve who smiled sweetly, already used to the pampering the boy always did. "Thank you, Dragon."
Maeve caught on to the fact that he hadn't stuttered through that sentence, it seemed no one else had. Quite odd, indeed.
Daphne nodded. "That seems like the most appropriate thing to do, seeing as we'll be up later we'd need all the rest we can get. We don't want to get behind, after all."
A friend of mine gave me the nickname 'Dragon' for Draco, it seemed fitting for him and I thought it was cute~
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
With that, she walked out and headed to the quidditch field. She was slightly late to her little interrogation from the ginger twins. A hiss captured her attention, Loki poked his head from his space beneath her sleeves.
It was a haunting little poem, showed the threat the goblins possessed should they feel threatened. It was fascinating.
By the end of their first lesson, only Maeve had made an improvement to her match. McGonagall had been reluctantly impressed, she had turned her match into a perfectly silver and emerald lining needle with a sharply pointed end. McGonagall showed it to the class and then asked how she had changed the decor as well.
Maeve woke to harsh tapping on the cupboard door. She held in a growl, they were going to wake Loki up!
"I suppose we'll come along, don't want to give professor Sprout a reason to dislike us even more." Theo said, casually with a devilish smirk.
"Don't worry, we'll talk to pa, make sure he knows what's been going on at your home." George assured with a firm now from Fred.
Once satisfied with her morning routine, she walked back into her shared room. Her knee length socks were neatly laid upon her bed by Loki who rested on his heated rock that she had ordered from magical menagerie. It was good for him because of the cold dampness that surrounded the dungeons. She waved her hand and her bed made itself, honestly, Maeve couldn't understand the use of wands. Her magic responded perfectly to her, was the wand only for help directing the magic? Shrugging to herself, she sat down and pulled on her socks and slipped on her small black shoes.
Before anyone knew what happened, the girl was thrown off the boat with a loud shriek that captured the other first years and the man's attention. Maeve stayed seated, a look of concern plastered over her face. Anyone who bothered to look close enough could see the malicious amusement in her eyes.
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.
"How can you all be so moronic!" She ignored the sound of an insulted gasp. "Obviously there are several light spells that can harm another person. For example, if someone truly wanted you dead easily, all they would need to do was drop you from a high enough place and a simple Wingardium Leviosa! And Splat-'' she once again ignored the gasp that sounded much more frightened. "You're dead."
The green eyed girl admitted relunctantly. She hated revealing anything in fear of seeming weak, but she trusted Loki. He'd been her most faithful companion since the day she brought him home when she was merely six years old.
Her aunt and uncle sat together on the couch looking equally nervous, Petunia was wringing her hands and tapping her foot. "What's going on?" She questioned, her sudden appearance caused the two already nervous couple to practically jumping out of their skin. Maeve raised a delicately arched eyebrow at them and motioned with her hand to get on with it.
A taller boy her age with platinum blonde hair walked by with two large lackeys. She smirked, time to charm some boys. "Excuse me?" She called out to him in a soft voice, though the weight of her words rang loud.
Maeve rolled her eyes, she was quite tired of all these interruptions. Couldn't she have one day to just rest and spend time with her boys? Was that too much to ask for? Apparently so.
He pressed a delicate kiss on her pale knuckles before running his thumb across the smooth skin. "Pleasure."
Once she was done she made her way back to her compartment, where she saw a lanky redhead with a large nose and a face full of freckles. Maeve eyed his clothes, they were clearly hand-me-down. As she got closer she couldn't help but roll her eyes at what he was spitting out his mouth. Obviously this boy couldn't be in anything other than Gryffindor, with his brash and distasteful attitude.
"Why on earth are would Malfoy be sitting with a halfblood?" Oh, the poor girl simply didn't know who she was insulting.
Maeve laughed, before clearing her face of any expression as did the rest of her snakes. They arrived at their next class, they couldn't let the pathetic lions see them showing emotions. It'd give them an advantage. Maeve and her group walked in first as per usual. Professor Quirrell looked quite strange with a purple turban and a black robe with lining similar to the color of his turban, which smelled oddly like onions. Why on earth would he want to smell like garlic?
"Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
Maeve had packed and organized all her things the night before, to anxious to actually get any sleep. She waited impatiently for her relatives to awake so they can leave, she wanted to put as much distance between them as quickly as possible. She dressed in a form fitting pink blouse and washed out jeans, her hair was pulled in a clean ponytail and small feet covered with her white ballet shoes.
Lord Malfoy and Maeve appeared back in the headmasters office, the proud blonde placed his hand on her shoulder to keep her from walking away. He bent down slightly to whisper in her ear, "I've read through your letter and I would be honored to be a proxy for you, I'll be sure to set up the meeting with wizengamot about your proposition. Should you need anything else, please don't hesitate to write." Then he flooed away, leaving her with the old man watching her curiously.
the High Table. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
When professor Flitwick dismissed them with the promise of learning more with hands on activities, Maeve told her group she would meet them at the Great Hall in a few minutes. "I just need to stop by the library to pick up a book with information I need." She waved them off with a reassuring smile that she will be just fine. Goodness, surely they know she didn't need protection from anybody, right?
Maeve sat, looking out the window. While aunt Petunia made Dudley a very large and unhealthy lunch, she got nothing. Because her uncle Vernon claimed that freaks such as herself didn't deserve the good food and should be happy with what she got.
The blonde nodded, she didn't miss the calculative look in his eyes as he took in her words. Good, she wouldn't want an imbecile by her side, no matter how politically powerful they are. The world is a cruel place, weak minded people will never survive.
"If they stand behind you, protect them. if they stand beside you, respect them. If they stand against you, destroy them."
Wandering into the kitchen to look for a snack, Maeve thought of what life had in stored for her. What great adventure would she be on? What type of magic would they teach her? Did they teach mundane studies?
Her uncle swirled around, face red with anger. He lifted his large hand in an attempt to hit her. Maeve narrowed her eyes and watched in cruel amusement as Vernon Dursley slammed against the wall on the other side of the room.
The four drowned out the professor as she lectured of the plants and their uses. Maeve had a fierce frown as she stared the three boys down, challenging them to deny her or oppose her. They did neither.
"My dear girl, you must remember that adults deserve their respect and the manner in which you are speaking to McGonagall is indeed quite rude." Dumbledore said in his disappointed grandfatherly tone.
Maeve watched as Marge glanced around the room frantically, she knew Vernon nor Petunia would step in. They weren't brave enough. She sauntered towards Marge, she stared shrewdly at the unpleasant parasite.
Blaise glanced at Maeve, the girl had such a way with words, it was understandable why she was considered a snake. She had gotten another teacher to look passed the bias ways the school had looked at them and caused her to genuinely like them. Which was a first.
"He was imprisoned for a little more than a decade for a crime he did not commit, he was sentenced without a trial and would've rot had I not requested one."
If you don't believe that type of stuff then that's fine, neither do I but I think it's pretty interesting.
"Wonderful, I want you all to find a subject you excel in and top the class. Study all you can and never fall behind. We need to each have a subject we dominate, for example I am pretty good at transfiguration but I'm also decent at charms from the few things I've tried. So figure it out and get back to me, okay?"
Maeve lit up with an idea. "What if we cut those strings off? Let's be honest, Dumbledore has everyone believing the sun shines out of his arse, but what if they all found out who he truly is?"
Though she would never admit to anyone, Maeve was impressed. As she thought, Malfoy would make a valuable asset, she'll keep him close. She smiled politely and accepted his hand, feigning a blush as he kissed her knuckles lightly. "I do hope we become friends, after all in times like this, we can use all the allies we can gather."
They finally reached the Great Hall where a tall, thin, blonde man stood, a cane in his hand. He looked very similar to her dear friend Draco, she supposed he was quite good looking. Though, she'd always choose Draco.
Maeve led her snakes out the classroom and walked a little further away to ensure no prying ears before stopping and facing the other Slytherins. "After History of Magic, I want everyone in the common rooms including the older years. It's time I show you all exactly what happens if you disobey me, there will be no more private punishments. I didn't know I was being too soft and allowing someone to think they could make a fool of us and humiliate our name. Parkinson, you are lucky we had no class with any other house but you've disrespected Flitwick and I will not have that slide. If you try to make an escape after History of Magic, I'll make you wish you were never born.
Zabini nodded. "Charms is bound to be exciting. I've heard that professor Flitwick is the only one who doesn't discriminate on houses."
Carefully, she unwrapped it. A gasp fell from parted lips. It was a beautiful large, oval locket made of heavy gold with a serpentine 'S' in green jewels. There was a note placed at the bottom of the box, she grabbed it and examined it's written contents.
"Come on, love. We had no idea you were looking for us. We've been here the whole time. Honest." Blaise explained. Maeve eyed him before she sighed and smiled brightly, surprising them.
She smiled, Loki had been her most faithful companion. He had become her best and only friend in just a month. The Dursleys still haven't noticed him, but when they do, he'll be at her side demanding obedience.
'Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principle people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself  at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other Lady, and spent the rest of the evening walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everyone hoped that he would never come there again. Among the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behavior was sharpened into particular resentment, by having slighted one of her daughters.'
Another five minutes passed and Flitwick entered, clapping his hands to gather the attention of every student. "All right, if you all remember Lumos, the Wand-Lighting Charm then it's time to teach you all Nox. Nox is the Wand-Extinguishing Charm, the counter-charm to Lumos. Nox will put out the light Lumos has created from the tip of your wand.
Maeve almost burst out laughing at the look on both her aunt and cousins face. Dudley looked ready to throw a tantrum while her aunt looked like she swallowed a lemon. "How dare you?! Well I ought to get you fired!" She screeched. Maeve giggled as Mrs. Colt rolled her eyes. "Ma'am, it's the start of summer, I dare you to get me fired. I could find a new job away from your brat of a child."
Maeve pursed her lips in annoyance. It was possible, she had seen the Weasley Matriarch and what she assumed as the two youngest were a part of the ones attempting to control her and wealth. She wrote the names of everyone she encountered that could possibly be a problem for her.
Hopefully breakfast was still being served, her stomach ached with hunger. Why does she always wait so late to eat? She smiled at George as he held the door open for her like a true gentleman, guess chivalry wasn't as dead as she first assumed.
She crackles at something she clearly only thought was amusing. "Our blood is pure, yours is tainted by that mudblood of a mother." Pug face sneered.
"It's just, I've lived with my muggle relatives for the majority of my childhood and your father works in the muggle department, surely he'd understand the dangers of a magical child living with magic hating muggles." She was planning on not returning to the Dursleys, and what better way to ensure she doesn't get sent back than to involve the ministry. They certainly wouldn't want their beloved girl who lived to be harmed while living with muggles, right?
Maeve led her snakes back to the dungeons where potions class resided, Snape would have a nasty surprise if he openly showed his dislike towards the young girl. Entering the class, it was no surprise that the greasy haired man was not present, Snape seemed the type to have a dramatic entrance.
"Thank you for helping her, sir. She was far to clumsy, I warned her to stay seated. She just wouldn't listen. Say, what's your name?" Maeve asked, masking her face with a look of innocence.
She wouldn't worry, in a month she will have them kneeling at her feet. Nothing will get in her way. She just giggled at her serpent friend and headed inside.
"Alright, those of you who are still eating have less than ten minutes remaining. I will be heading to Charms already, I trust that no one will be late. And if you are, understand that there will be punishment for any points you lose."
"Dumbledore has been trying to control you?" George asked, looking slightly put-off, he was raised with the thought that that old man was great and powerful. He knew it couldn't all possibly be true but to control someone was beyond mad.
Malfoy scoffed, though there was a quirk of his lips so he wasn't truly upset. "The bangers are good, would you like some?" He offered his plate, she giggled. If he hadn't been offering, she still would have nicked some.
Green eyes scanned the room, it was nearly empty apart from a few older students. "You blondie, what time is it?" Hopefully classes were almost out as she wanted to be near her boys, first she would go and get Loki, heaven knows he gets much too pouty when left alone for far too long.
“First would be Hogwarts robes, I’d like those made with cashmere wool lined with silk. For holidays and special occasions I’d like a specially made silver-grey satin dress, stopping just below the knees with black booties. A gown of emerald silk, floor length with silver flats. Both of those, I'd like to have to resize in any case I suddenly have a growth spurt, please. Three dress robes made with the finest silk and wools you have available in colors of emerald, dark blue, and violet.” Maeve said, she knew she’d be able to afford the clothing items no matter the cost. “Should they be up to standard I may make this my go-to for dress robes and gowns.” Nothing but the best, of course.
Draco noticed her first and swiftly notified the other two boys sitting with him. Together they rushed to her side, Theo scanning her to make sure no harm had befallen her. When he didn't see any signs of injury, he looked at her confused.
"We turned the common room upside down and Minnie just about had a heart attack when she saw ickle Ron flipping with the chair." George finished with a laugh.
She grabbed her uniform, undergarments, hygiene products and walked to the bathroom. Luckily her roommates slept in till their alarm clock woke them, so she had no one to rush her and took her time. She lathered her hair in her favorite shampoo and conditioner and rinsed under the lukewarm water, then proceeded to wash her body with her mint body wash. After a few more minutes under the water and enjoying the quietness of the early morning, Maeve turned the water off and wrapped her body in her soft, fluffy towel.
Marge was either extremely dumb or very clueless. "Magic isn't real, you freak of nature!" She had practically snarled the sentence out.
"Yes, I'm surprised no one had realized how manipulative and conniving he is. I have no doubt that he'll send your brother next after I blew off Granger."
The brunette gasped in fear when her leg cramped and she collapsed on the ground, she looked at her friend tears in her dark eyes. "Please, Liv! Don't do it!" She begged, whimpering as the blonde stepped forward, her face expressionless. "Sorry Audrey." Maeve stared passively as Liv beat Audrey, kicking and punching. The girl screamed in pain, calling out for help, but Maeve made sure no one would be able to hear them.
Add to the fact that by the time she was 3 strange things begin happening. Of course Petunia knew the brat had no clue of what she'd done, but that didn't mean she and Vernon wouldn't put a stop to it while they could. Petunia made sure the girl learned to cook and clean properly because surely the freak would only be useful as a maid than anything else.
Maeve had a free period along with the rest of the Slytherins and she wanted to head to the library with her group to study History of Magic on her own. No one else would be willing to teach her for merely being in Slytherin was considered a bad omen and none wanted to get close. Aside from the two ginger Gryffindors and Ravenclaw house(and they only did it because they didn't want to anger the short fused girl), no other have willingly associated with the snakes.
After rinsing thoroughly, Maeve turned the water off and wrapped herself in her fluffy white towel. Still humming, she dried off her hair before wrapping it in a separate towel. She grabbed her toothbrush and mint toothpaste and began brushing her teeth. Followed by her hydrating face soap and cleanser.
"I'm simply clearing my mind, a lot has changed in the past couple of days since I've been here." She admitted, something about Quirrell seemed almost familiar, like speaking to a part of herself.
They nodded. "You should probably teach him that insulting a Lady could cause a house feud. If I had wanted I could have waged a house war against him for insulting my name." She advised them, not wanting for their houses to start a fight for they were friends.
I would like to request you as my much needed proxy, you see I've just come back to the magical community after being away for  far too long. As my proxy, I'd need you to be able to properly speak on my behalf, there will be no unnecessary added information or comments only just what I say. I'd assume you'd like to know why it is that I need and requested you. Well, for one Draco Malfoy, your son, is a friend I have made and he seems to think you are capable and trustworthy. While I have not yet met you in person to pass judgement, I find Draco to be more than acceptable to clear any fleeting thoughts that you might betray me and that wouldn't look too good on your son if you did so. As for the reason, I'm sure from your time at Hogwarts, you would understand my doubts of Dumbledore, the old nutter, not being very capable of hiring competent help. A professor, I'm quite positive you know of, named Mr. Binns doesn't seem likely to teach us anything. Though this is our first day in class, I've come to be an excellent reader of people and I fully believe that professor Binns will not be able to teach us anything we could not learn from a book. What I'd like for you to do is set up a meeting in the wizengamot and gather a few votes to remove the professor and have someone of higher power provide a more adept teacher. Now, if you choose to refuse help then that'd, of course, be fine. Don't be pressured to help. I'll just ask another housemate, I'm sure they'd oblige. I hope you have a good evening, Lord Malfoy.                                                                                                                                      Kind regards, Maeve Potter.'
Apothecary was next on her list as Potions seemed like an interesting subject. Upon entering it, it looked very grimy. Hopefully the quality in which she buys her ingredients make up for the poor designs. Maeve decided to look around before she would settle upon her potions kit for first year.
"How was it so hard to locate you three? Had no one told you all that I was searching for you?" she asked exasperated as she sat beside Draco. "I had something to show you dolts, but now I'm rethinking my decision."
As though reading his mind, Loki appeared, peaking his head from the sleeves of his new mistress's shirt. Snake eyes glaring as he hissed in warning. The horse faced woman and baby walrus both yelped in fear at the sight of a dangerous creature, the elephant lookalike's face paled rapidly at the freaks companion.
Maeve watched the badgers' excitement dim as they learned they wouldn't be turning furniture into animals anytime soon. She rolled her eyes at the whining, quite immature. Malfoy and Nott were fixated at the prospect of learning magic and Zabini looked bored.
“Assuming you’re a first year, Brass Cauldron’s aren’t necessary for your year and it’s quite expensive, don’t you think?” Though Maeve knew the woman was being polite in the way she spoke it didn’t stop the young girl from disliking the way she was spoken to as though she were a mere child.
Draco looked unamused. "Blank parchment paper? Are you two truly daft to believe that would have any use?"
Her eyes lingered for a moment on a student in the front that Maeve could see trembling, and on the Weasley's still smudged nose. Maeve shifted impatiently on her feet.
They glanced at each other and nodded, agreeing to avoid anything that would cause her to anger. It was only logical. They stopped talking about her when they saw her make her way back to them.
Pushing forward, she hadn't noticed a large family of redheads enter the magical border, the elder woman looking quite distressed. She carefully made her way onto the train, the steps tricky to see as she pulled her trunk up. Frowning she gave on more harsh tug before stopping and instead scanning the area for someone to help her.
Maeve forced a smile upon her face as she gave a short nod, he waved a wrinkly hand towards a chair and motioned for her to take a seat. She refrained from outright groaning, what were the chances that her godfather becomes a free man and he suddenly wants to talk or after Lord Malfoy speaks to her in a seemingly private way? Unbelievable.
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song, Maeve looked around making eye contact with an extremely old man with long pure white hair and a similar beard. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
Loki seemed content with that answer as he laid and rested. His mistress should be fine with whatever she's dealing with. She by far the strongest and smartest human he knew. Granted, Loki didn't know many people.
Malfoy and Zabini stood up along with her, they ignored the curious gaze of their peers. As the self-proclaimed leader, Maeve led the two boys out to the greenhouse behind the castle. They saw plants of all various shapes, sizes, living and non-living.
He didn't continue until they reached her first vault, the Potter one. "He was a fallen angel." His words repeated themselves in her head, like a broken record. She had the blood of a fallen angel running through her veins. What did that make her? "You are the first of your kind, a witch with angel blood. And not just any angel, one of the four archangels and the fabled King of hell. I pity those who threatened harm upon you, for it was said that Lucifer was the most protective and dangerous of all angels."
Blaise Zabini had a good head on him, she nodded approvingly. She'll make sure to help him hone his analytical mind. It'd be very useful. "That's how all the teachers should be. They'll soon learn the errors of their way. After all, a war can only be won by all members of the party."
"Never mind that, my point is, that doddering old fool will have no say in my life. No one controls a Potter."
Shaking her head with a roll of her eyes, she walked in through the double doors. Her classroom was in hall D, number 201. She took her time in getting there, there was no rush as it was quite early.
(Strange wasn't it? How a woman who once adored the parents of the girl whom she was blatantly showing her dislike.
She nodded as they walked out to the greenhouse, the way they were familiar from having to come yesterday. The room was still filled to the brim with plants and colored a forest green hue. They made their way to stand in the back, when the short woman walked in.
The next class they had was Transfiguration with the Hufflepuffs and professor McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor house, was teaching the subject which would most likely set the Slytherins back. She was as prejudiced as any other self-proclaimed light witch and wizard, Maeve would warn her snakes to be on their best behavior because she had no doubts that the old bat would take points off for just breathing wrong. She wouldn't have someone degrade her snakes for being in a house supposedly classified as dark, it wasn't their fault their main attributes were ambition or cleverness.
"Up you go, lass." The giant lifted her up and placed her on ground, the boats having already stopped at the edge of the lake.
"Welcome back," he says, no honest joy in his voice, slamming his comic book shut and rising from his chair. "I'll tell Lucy to notify Healer Isaksen. Auror Filly has already left the building."
you are," Blaise snapped at Draco, his tension had disappeared as well. Only Ron still looked as if he had just seen a ghost. "And you don't have to grin so smugly, Harry. You've
Nellie nods, glances at Harry with absent, dark eyes and lowers her wand. "Yes, that was the name of the bastard who led that pack. That night, no Healer took a break. We saved who we could save." Her expression goes blank. "I lost two of the children I was responsible for."
Inside me, a switch flipped and I lost the last of my self-control at that very moment. "You vile bastard."
Harry broke away from the kiss, gave himself two seconds to control his breath and watch Draco. The colour that had been spread over Harry’s face now adorned Draco's chin, lips and cheeks. Harry sensed that his face couldn’t look any different and suppressed a smile.
Draco snorted annoyed, but his red cheeks betrayed him. "Let’s please consider the fact that you are the one who’s currently rubbing
The being spoke slowly, but Harry didn’t understand. Draco had lied to him? But why? And what kind of cost? It was all a little too cryptic for Harry. “What do you mean by that?” he asked. The being laughed brightly at him before answering.
“Don’t mind him, Harry. He’s trying to be funny,” Hermione interrupted, giving Ron a reproachful look.
Draco tilted his head and looked at Harry thoughtfully for a moment. "And you seem remarkably unconcerned by it."
Harry relaxes his facial muscles that he is suddenly aware are strained, sighs comfortably and lets his head sink back into the pillow. The soft voice informs him that he may now rest a little. Seconds later, Harry drifts into a peaceful slumber.
“Why is Malfoy gawping at you?” Ron whispered in Harry’s direction, which tore him from his thoughts. He raised his head and took a look at the row behind him. Draco had propped his chin onto his palm and seemed clearly bored by the class. As soon as their eyes met, he grinned smugly. That git! He
. Draco's insides. It was so bloody soft, hot and, although Harry's finger had entered him unhindered, hellishly tight.
An uneasy feeling sits in his stomach, the sole reason for his hesitation. After all, he is here for Jimar, to work out a battle plan with his fiancée and does not want to waste any time. His gaze falls on the worn doorbell sign that reads Palmer & Waters. Something is not right here, but Harry can find no rational reason for this hunch.
Harry almost smiled at his own thoughts, but Draco kept looking at him so angrily that he preferred not to.
"We're going for a ride after breakfast," announced Draco, who watched Harry with tired eyes. Before Harry could answer, Draco turned away from him to keep sleeping.
I closed my eyes in agony but tamped down the urge to turn back. Every memory carried meaning and value. Everything had already happened, looking away or skipping memories did not make them undone.
As Ron devotes himself to his work, his mind wanders to his best friend. It is Friday, which leaves Ron with a queasy feeling in his stomach. As far as he knows, the destruction of Malfoy's diary has been put on hold for the time being, at least until the fuss about Viper has died down a bit. It appears to be the right decision to distract Harry this evening and take his mind off things.
With a determined stride, Harry approaches the tomb and sinks onto the damp grass right before the white marble. With the tip of his wand, he taps against the tiny carved
would reach the two-minute mark. In that moment, caught in desire, lust and passion, Harry knew he had done everything right. That he was falling in love with the right man, that he wouldn't let Draco leave again. The irrepressible need to scream it out into the world was building in him.
Harry first noticed it when Draco took Andvari’s halter off, then left the stall and carefully closed the door behind him. Draco's fingers worked with such precision, that Harry couldn't have looked away. He had stopped in the middle of the stable alley, crossed his arms and pierced his teeth in his lower lip while watching Draco. Draco had noticed the look early on, he had given Harry a tiny smile and then had gone about his business seemingly unconcerned. But Harry's gaze was precise enough that he could
The second part was the theory of linking spells and since they had to sit at tables for this part and not, as in the practical part of the lesson, walk around freely in the room, Harry was already looking for a suitable sitting partner. Ron had secured the place next to Hermione faster than Harry could say “snitch” and had then grinned at him triumphantly.
“What… What recent events have changed that keep you coming back here?” he asked hurriedly, to get the topic back on track.
“Okay, that’s a real blow,” Harry replied, lowering his eyes to the closed book and thinking hard about how to make Draco agree to his alternative. The direct truth would probably be the best solution. Like ripping off a band-aid, short and sweet? “All right, let's move on to Plan B then: You need to have sex with someone.”
Harry feels himself nodding and struggles to keep his composure. It merely confirms his suspicions; he had little hope that the Healer would deliver any other news to him. Still, it hurts. It hurts as deeply as his guilt runs.
Harry opened his eyes when he heard Draco’s soft voice. Not half a second later a curtain was pushed aside a little and Draco appeared. Without looking at Harry, Draco climbed onto his bed and closed the curtain again. It was too dark to see anything clearly, so Harry concentrated on his other senses. The movement of the mattress suggested that Draco was making himself comfortable next to him. The blanket was lifted a little and Harry clearly felt a leg brush against his while Draco pulled the blanket over him.
AND there's another incredible artwork drawn by datsiro on Tumblr: https://datsiro.tumblr.com/post/631719148697927680/covid-in-the-back-be-like-am-i-a-joke-to-you
The morning sun rays passed through the thin fabric of the curtains into the room and bathed the room in dim light. Harry blinked, yawned and then looked down at the floor next to his bed. Ron sat up there, rubbing his neck and looking around sleepily.
was all right. I had opened my mind to something that turned out to be nothing but a figment of my imagination. How was I to know that I was not simply fantasising all this? If the book was a Horcrux, it had the power to deceive me. I felt my grip on Malfoy's collar tighten.
Hermione glanced at Harry for a moment, then shrugged. “If you continue to be so pushy, he will eventually have no choice.”
Looking for support, Harry reached for Draco's waist, pulled him closer, deepened the kiss, set fire to the timidity. And Draco responded. He wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, pressed their bodies even closer together, soaking up the new feeling as if his life depended on it. Perhaps it did. Harry sighed into the kiss, unable to explain why he had delayed this moment for so long.
It hurts not being able to tell Draco that he is mistaken. That he is not seeing through Harry. That everything in Harry's life is well and he is fully capable of being an anchor for Draco. Instead, he has to look at Draco and realise that he cannot say these things.
"Maybe someday," Harry replies, and he means it. First, he needs to find something that will offer him a new perspective on the future, something that will provide stability in his life without it being a shaky framework of routine. Before he can return to his past, he must first attend to himself. He will seek something that will drive him forward and not hold him back, but at the same time question his perspective on the past. It will be a long road before he can return to Hogwarts. But it is a path he is willing to tread.
Option number 2: Pet him over the blond hair until he purred and said yes and amen to everything. However, the success rate was not too high, so a plan B would certainly be useful.
"But you have access to his diary?" Ginny inquires with interest. "You can look at his memories, right?"
Harry did not react to Ron's commentary, as his eyes fell on a group of Slytherins who had just entered the library and were chatting merrily. The irrepressible need for something that Harry couldn’t describe was growing in him. All he knew was that it had to do with Malfoy and that it would not disappear anytime soon. Without a thought for consequences, Harry jumped up and went straight for the group that included Draco Malfoy.
"Harry doesn't think that'll do it," Hermione continues quietly, voicing his thoughts. "A simple disarm would work on any other wand, but under these circumstances and with the Elder Wand? The method isn't reliable enough."
Healer Isaksen busies herself with provisionally cleaning her spectacle lenses, not looking at Harry. "Allow me to summarise: You cast a physically injurious curse on Mr Malfoy while he had opened his magical surface using the
to support murder and cruelty. There hasn't been a second in your life when you didn't care only about yourself. You'll never realise you're in the wrong because your horizon is the width of a bloody needle. You've always been a slimy little prick and you always will be!"
"I know," Harry interrupted him. He didn't want Draco to feel he had to open up. "We all have a past."
"It's possible," Anja interrupts Mr Potter briskly. "There is a possibility that he was subject to a forgetfulness charm. Why else would he not have already expressed concern about his physical condition in Azkaban?"
Moreover, Harry appreciates Draco's openness, which only surfaces during these hours of the day. He continues to be reserved with Ron and Hermione, resumes the habit of smoking and spends most of his time in the drawing room on the couch or armchair, brooding as he gazes silently out of the window, or stroking Pup's belly.
I had told him about George and his shop, even about Nellie and her unfortunate lot which had cost her her dream. I had also told him about Luna's travels and Neville's life journey and had proudly raved to him at our last meeting that Hermione and Ron were expecting a child. When he had smirked and then let me know that I talked an awful lot when asked how I was doing, but never actually mentioned anything that was happening in my own life, I had also kept quiet.
Before Draco could even think of shaking his hand, Blaise took Ron's wrist and pushed it out of reach. "
Harry was sure Draco was only sulking for so long because they were a whole five points behind Ginny and Luna's team. It was a completely exaggerated reaction, Harry had already evened out the score in the morning with feeding and a little extra work with Hagrid, but now Draco was sulking out of sheer defiance, which almost made it worse. Harry had a taste of Draco and found that his patience was wearing thin. A kiss in the stable alley, completely inappropriate for the public, had calmed Harry's nerves for the moment. Then they had left for their trip to the lake and Draco had given his attention to Pansy and Theo, who were riding their ponies alongside Draco.
. He has a destination in mind and most people do not question someone who looks like they know where they are going. But eight witches and five wizards turn to look at him. Harry wishes he could just manage to ignore the stares. But he can feel every single one of them, and just as accurately as he counts them, he can interpret how favourable the gazes are towards him.
The trials had gone well, that was definitely due to a lot of corrupt gold that had flowed. Narcissa, as well as Draco, would have been acquitted even without the money, as Harry had made sure that the Wizengamot knew about their help. Harry’s testimony had caused a lot of uproar, but by now few people were interested in what Harry had to do with the Malfoys. Besides, it had really only been the truth, it had not been an act of pity. Draco had never thanked him for it and Harry had never expected a word of gratitude.
That was good enough for me, so I met his eyes. "I don't think you've been a good person. You based your decisions solely on fear, and honestly, I think you still do. If you carry bravery inside you, then you're choosing to disregard it."
A little discussion flared up about who would be Ron's babysitter now that Harry was too busy, Draco followed it amused and after a while turned his head to Harry.
That is absurd to admit to himself, which is why Harry defers the thought to a later time. For such contemplation, he needs the support of Barber and his Adagio for Strings.
Malfoy's expression remained unaffected, he raised his chin a bit and looked past me for a while. I supposed he was pondering my words, which proved to be the case. "Would you then claim about yourself that all your decisions are driven by bravery? And here I'm referring to you the way you currently are, not the person you were when you were forced to save the entire world."
Malfoy, who by now has turned his head towards him and whose long strands of hair fall into his face. His mouth is slightly open, the orb of light casting long shadows of his eyelashes on his closed eyelids. There is something wonderfully peaceful about the sight, Harry memorises every detail, no matter how small.
"It varies," Neville replies, taking a sip of his white coffee. "Initially, it was enough for me to keep myself busy with my plants. When the nightmares worsened, I occasionally used a diary to write down my feelings."
"So you're telling me that Mr Malfoy is going to die from a curse that was cast years ago? More specifically, a curse
His hand expertly gripped my erection, gently running along it and spreading precum on the tip of it with his thumb. I heard myself moan against his lips. My fingers found Draco's arse cheeks, caressed them, explored the soft muscle. We only broke apart to gasp for breath and when I wet my fingers with saliva.
"A concert?" Draco's rage subsided rapidly. Making way for lostness and breaking Harry's heart along with it. "You fucked me for a
But Malfoy seemed to like what he was hearing. A small smile snuck into the right corner of his mouth. "So you're saying you invaded my diary for personal reasons? Now that's heartwarming, Potter. Don't tell me you missed me."
Draco paused, uncertain as to exactly how he should proceed. Harry ran his fingers through his hair reassuringly and waited. It was all he could do anyway.
Draco snorted but seemed visibly relieved that Harry had regained control over his thoughts. “I was quite capable of controlling my emotions, as I recall.”
Well, I did not think of him, as I made an effort to focus my thoughts completely on trivialities like dress robes. I did not anticipate encountering him today – or ever again. If I were in his position, I would not want to talk to me either after all my accusations. Not that the accusations had all been unjustified, but I had gone way too far. I was only too aware of that.
on them and pulled them out of the bathroom by their collars, where they came to their senses as soon as they were back on their feet.
That's what the Healer had said and it had sounded easy to Harry. But now that he was actually where it all had happened… He had thought it would be easier.
It appears to be an unwritten law that people's stories only acquire importance when the respective people are no longer among the living. This is true for remarkable artists and persons of great deeds who, after their death, finally receive the praise they deserved in their lifetime. But it is also true of the cruellest of all people, whose stories inspire sheer horror and not infrequently end up as horror stories told around a campfire in the dark of night.
Gossamer-like lines appeared on the pale skin, connecting barely discernible birthmarks until the constellation of the dragon flickered fully visible over Draco's heart. The lines were only disrupted by the deep cuts of the curse I myself had cast.
The orgasm hit him like cold water, pervaded his entire body with an intensity that almost brought him to his knees. The only thing that saved him was Draco's body, which he clung to desperately. Breathing heavily, Harry gave himself a few seconds to gather himself. Then he withdrew out of Draco, spun the blond, who was still struggling with the after-waves of his own orgasm, around and pulled him into a passionate kiss. Draco let himself sag against Harry's chest, placed lazy kisses on his neck and held onto Harry's upper arms.
In the afternoon, Harry accompanied Hermione to the library, where she immediately began her research on sea creatures. Harry sat down at a table, put an essay on top of it to serve as an alibi, and devoted himself again to his observations of Draco Malfoy, who was conveniently busy with schoolwork just a few tables away. Pansy was sitting next to him, but she didn't notice Harry's look and was absorbed in a Transfiguration book.
At the entrance of the mare-and-gelding stable, the list of the assigned horses was attached to a small notice board. Harry didn’t even attempt to find his name. To push past eleven other participants, some of them much bigger than him, was simply a Mission Impossible for him. Instead, he looked around the stable.
His feet carry him through the usual route to the fourth floor and a little further to the corridors that take him towards the high-security sector. Lucy is sitting in her usual spot behind the small reception desk and gives him a puzzled look, which strikes Harry as odd enough to approach her straight away and to greet her in a friendly manner.
"Come on, fire away," he prompts him. He is wrapped in a bulky jacket like all the others, wears a knitted maroon coloured woollen hat with matching gloves and has a colourful scarf draped around his neck and half his face. "I can tell by the look on your face that something's wrong."
Harry finished his sentence in his mind. He didn’t know why he deserved it or why Draco felt that way about him, but the little selfish part of him was happy about it.
"After my brother died, forcing me to take over the Owl Emporium, I decided to spite my family and immortalise my gratitude to Dumbledore by adding a phoenix to our emblem," Nellie says as she intently levitates the pumpkins into a neat order.
Heart pounding, Harry pushes him down the corridors, past closed doors – it is already idle hours in the hospital. Most of the patients are roaming in a world of dreams, so Harry only encounters a few people. So far, everything is going according to plan, even at the reception desk he only receives a brief, brash glance.
“Stop that now, Potter!” Draco growled as Harry’s hand reached Draco’s waistband and asked to be let in. With a sigh, Harry took his hand away and ran it through Draco’s hair instead. He knew that this was nothing personal, yet it was a shame that he wouldn’t see Draco in pure ecstasy.
“Hell, mate," Ron appeared next to Harry and patted him on the shoulder to instruct him to move away from the fence. The others were already leaving the stands. "You've got it
Less than five minutes later, Harry and Draco left their room with giant strides. Harry with the biggest grin on his lips one could imagine so early in the morning and Draco... well, Draco looked
The lack of response only confirms Draco's assumption. "I'm broken because that's the way I am. It has no relation to you in any way. I know I blamed you, but at that moment I was devastated and so
Voices were the first thing Harry heard, then a very distinct growl, which startled him so much that his head shot up. It took Harry a moment to get his bearings. He was still in the Prefects’ Bathroom and he was lying on the floor, the cold tiles underneath him. His neck ached; however he had slept, it hadn’t been healthy. And not for a minute either. His eyes fell on an empty bottle and the memories shot into his head like lightning. The Sleeping Draught! That stuff seemed strong if it knocked him out like that after just one sip. Harry blinked and straightened up, his limbs aching and his mouth feeling dry. Disgusting stuff, he didn’t feel the need to relive this anytime soon.
Draco whimpered softly, arched his back to take Harry even deeper and pressed his lips pleadingly against Harry's. No matter how big his mouth was, Draco fell for Harry's compliments like decaying bark. Harry gasped, blindly grabbing Draco's hips and thrusting harder, his rhythm remaining firm but steadily accelerating.
Harry's hand now encloses Draco's entirely and he looks him firmly in the eye. "You aren't wrong, and yet that isn't all. People are a lot more than their egocentrism or their misery."
Darkness enveloped the courtyard as the last of them took their horses back to their respective stalls. Harry stayed in Hermione and Ron's room for a while, tiredly exchanged stories about old times, and only retired to his room around midnight, there Draco still occupied the bathroom. Harry took a well-deserved shower later regardless, but then he fell into bed with Draco, completely exhausted, and fell asleep immediately.
"Spectacular," he replies, and indeed all he feels is exhaustion, no discomfort at all. "I remember ... pain, but it's gone now."
That is what drives Harry out of the house on the Sunday right before Halloween and what results in him standing on a stepladder outside Nellie's Eeylops Owl Emporium with a cleaning rag, polishing the shop sign. Nellie is currently busy decorating the shop windows with pumpkins and figurines of ghosts. She does not care much for holidays, least of all those where no gifts are exchanged. But to please her daughter Aurora, who gets excited about those days, as most children do, she dresses the shop windows every year, even if she only leaves the decorations up for a single day.
A sigh escapes the Healer's lips. "Let me know how I can help you. Until then, if it's alright, you're not the only one who wants to share their concerns with me."
"I seem to have expressed myself in a misleading way last time," Malfoy's cool voice rose just inches behind me. "Or you're just daft."
They describe that their plan worked, that Draco gave Harry his final death blow before he lost consciousness. Ron tells that Draco collapsed whimpering only seconds later, that he could barely be calmed down, but Ron was able to succeed in calming him down. Meanwhile, Hermione was already casting the first spells over Harry, stabilising his condition as best she could.
Harry considers his options as he watches Isaksen scribble something with her quill on a piece of parchment. He does not believe that Jimar could harm even a fly – that he would turn out to be an informant of Viper's, he simply cannot imagine. At least he is not alone in his conviction. Isaksen does not believe it either, hence she is currently asking Harry for his help. But where should he start?
In the last week of July, two days before my planned small birthday party, he had pulled me aside after an ordinary Friday evening visit and provided me with seemingly random information about the progress of the cases of the missing persons. I suspected that he was trying to get into my head, but I remained resilient. Even after Filly had reported to me that the wizard who claimed to possess the Elder Wand had revealed himself as
"Speak of the devil!" Ginny grinned amusedly at Draco, who returned the look with a good portion of resentment and an eye roll.
A faint "Oh" sounded next to me, which was only followed by more silence. I could not think of any words I wanted to speak in honour of his father, so I did not. Draco seemed to understand because he did not make me. Instead, he surrendered to his silent grief and I felt like I had never seen him so genuinely forlorn.
, bare skin – and pulled the blond closer. "Don't run," he muttered, holding Draco by his waist with one hand while the other brushed along his cheek.
Jimar sighs and folds his hands in front of him on the desk. "You should know that for some time now the suspicion has been developing that our problem patient is suffering from the same curse as his mother. We both know that Anja is fighting it with all her might, but she's increasingly losing support, even among the other Healers."
"I hope you’re aware that you're mental," was all Harry said, he tightened the grip around Draco's wrist and pulled him forward with a firm step. Draco whimpered, but then he let himself be dragged along. Harry was sure Draco was suffering from delusions. How could anyone
wanted to re-insure. “So there is a way out for Draco? And you guarantee to tell me if I bring you the ring for one night?”
But the glow extinguished by itself, the heat subsided, everything became calm and behind closed eyelids, the picture of a future free from all chains and curses was created. Blood became pure, old magic was extinguished, desires disappeared forever, abilities vanished as if they had never been and something other than magic touched two hearts that night.
"No one could," Ron interrupts him, looking at him intently. "You know, we said goodbye to Harry once before, and we didn't think we'd see him again then. If you think either of us would even consider agreeing to this without being completely sure we'd be able to pull it off without hurting Harry, you're wrong."
Draco gasped perplexed when he was grabbed by the hips and pressed on his back against the mattress. But Harry forgot to apologise for his roughness, pressed his lips against Draco's, as if there was nothing more important, and thrust into the wet tightness that gratefully took him in.
he asked casually as if it wasn't the suggestion of pure suicide. "Galloping bareback is the most liberating feeling imaginable!"
“Yes,” Harry answered honestly, watching closely as Draco’s smile failed to reach his eyes, and struggled not to sigh. “But you have to understand me too. I can’t just let you go; it goes against everything my nature stands for. If I let you go, I’d lose myself.”
Mr Potter closes his eyes briefly, then opens his mouth, but closes it again. Something stops him and Anja can only guess what it is.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but with a glance at Ron’s plate, he realised that he wasn’t the only one who needed to recharge energy. Ron and Hermione had certainly made full use of the empty dormitory, even if Harry didn’t want to think about it. “Yes, I didn’t have any dinner last night,” he explained, which caused Hermione to look at him doubtfully. Even Ron didn’t seem to believe him completely.
Unimpressed by Harry's lack of response, Draco stubs out the cigarette butt, climbs off the windowsill in one fluid motion, shuts the window behind him and strides across the room, stopping in front of the record player. His fingertips skim over the selection of records arranged on the shelf right next to it – a small smile strays onto his lips as soon as he finds what he is looking for.
heals faster when I’m in the water.” Draco exposed his right forearm. The dark wound he had from the night of Harry's rescue looked much better, but it healed slowly. Harry fixed his eyes on it and wondered when the right moment would be to ask Draco what had happened. Maybe never. Draco didn't like to boast about that night, unless it did him some good, like Harry leaving him alone.
