I took my time pulling my jumper over my head while pinching my eyes shut, hoping his gym shirt would be in place by the time I opened them again.
“Professor, is a month really warranted?” I pray internally for him to go easier on me now that it was just us in the room.
“Why would I help you? It’s not like you’d ever help me out of the kindness of your heart.” My skin began to crawl as the space between us continued to shrink. “For years, you actually went out of your way to make my life as difficult as you could. And now you’re asking for help.”
“Correct. I’ll see you both back here at seven. Dismissed.”
“The field lights’ll be turnin’ on any moment here. Besides all I’m havin’ you two do is some weedin’, nothin’ a little darkness would hurt,” he clasped a large hand on Potter’s shoulder as he turned back to him.
out of my head. How dare he speak to me as if I’m someone he can order around? Humiliation and anger coiled around each other in my stomach as I stewed over the incident. I had to do something.
“You’ll what?” he cut me off with a sharp tone. I snapped my jaw shut. “You’re not gonna do anything because you
“Now fieldwork can get a little messy so you two otta change into your gym uniform before we get started,” Hagrid unlocked the door with one of the many keys he wore on his belt.
“Yeah, well-”
I followed closely on his heels until he stopped, my heart still beating fast and hard in my chest the entire way. “You told them?” I spat out the moment he faced me.
“Potter,” I returned, his name tasting vile on my tongue.
Everyone’s perceptions of me remained the same though. Honestly, I didn’t mind. If people thought I was some mean bully, they didn’t pry. Didn’t push me. Because when I was pushed, the old me could still easily find his way out.
I turned the corner, walking down the row where my locker resided. My stomach twisted when I heard Potter's footsteps close behind me. Heat began rising to my cheeks against my will. His locker was only four down from my own.
“Well, I’m done listening to you. You can’t fucking demand things of me in front of a crowd- its-” humiliating was the word on my tongue, but somehow it felt even more degrading to say it out loud. “I’m done.”
Potter sauntered over to the row of plants I was working on. “Help you out, huh?” A slightly amused expression laid over his face. My heart quickened slightly as he neared closer.
I paused. My body was shaking with a violent mixture of anger and humiliation running through my veins. My heart was beating so hard in my chest I thought it might explode. For the first time in my life, I felt utterly powerless against him.
I tried to convince my father to let me switch schools. The answer was a cold hard no. I didn’t have a valid reason to give him after all. The days prior to my return, I spent crying then blowing up on anyone for any reason, then working out to try to calm myself then crying yet again. The thoughts in my head were swirling around each other attacking me at all times.
“Why don’t you try to get some dirt on him?” Theo suggested, slightly out of breath.
I mimicked him pulling a shirt quickly over my head and brushing my fingers through my hair to push it back into place. “Don’t take it as one,” I refuted, pinching my jaw shut tightly.
“Malfoy,” he nodded as he knocked on the heavy wooden door.
“That was more just asking nicely than begging, by the way, but I’ll let it slide this time,” he said as he shoved the weeds into my bag. The way he said ‘this time’ made something tense up in my chest. It didn’t come across as a figure of speech but more as a promise.
“It’s rude to stare, Malfoy,” Potter shouted with his back still facing me.
I managed to get my combination right on my second attempt. With a breath of relief, I slipped off my robes, setting them on the bench behind me. From the corner of my eye, I watched Potter tug on his tie, loosening it enough to slip it off his head without actually untying it. “Who am I covering for anyways?” I questioned while trying to keep my vision straightforward.
“Malfoy?” Pansy appeared in the open doorway of my dorm, “Professor Snape’s requesting you in his office.”
“Seems like a Slytherin thing to do,” my words came from my mouth like vomit.
After a few ominously quiet first days of school, I finally accepted that maybe Potter hadn’t told everyone. At first, I was relieved, but after some more thought, the pieces clicked into place. Potter hadn’t told anyone because then he would no longer have it to hold over my head. He was saving it.
For nearly two years, my karma never came around. That was until this moment, where it was finally served on a giant silver platter. And none other than Harry Potter was here to eat it up.
“Yeah.”
“Ron. He’s gotten in so much trouble already this year I was worried they’d expel him if this was added on top.” He quickly unbuttoned his shirt.
“Listen,” I tried to cover shame that was riddling my body behind a strong voice, “If you tell anyone about this, I’ll-”
He continued walking down the row of plants and I felt something dying inside me. Did he seriously just make me say that and he wasn’t even going to help? My face scrunched tightly with anger. Just as I prepared to shout something sinister at him, I noticed him grab a pair of gloves. He pulled them on as he started back towards me. Immediately, my resentful thoughts dissipated.
“It’s nearly dark,” I complained. The sun had already sunk past the horizon over trees in the distance leaving the sky muted shades of blue and purple.
I felt myself sinking into a sea of bliss.
The man’s mouth pressed into my own. I hungrily pushed my tongue into his, while sliding my hands over his strong frame. I absorbed every aspect of him: his smell, musky and dark, his muscles flexing with each small movement, the hardness growing in his jeans as I rubbed up against him. I savored him while in return pouring myself into him, letting him drink me in.
bedroom”
His cock sliding in and out, pumping deliciously at her, touching that place that sent jolts to her pleasurable body. But he made sure to be careful, not wanting to harm their child. The baby that could complete them.
Harry hummed, continuing to cook their dinner. Draco raised his head and began to pepper soft kisses along Harry’s back, in all of his scars, the marks that tethered Draco to cry in his pillows every second of his absence. Praying he make it out alive, strong, and still brave like his daddy before he left with the determined look to come back with a win.
. Common phrase, never unheard of but it was the promise in his tone that put Draco off. Overwhelmed possibly but still not deterred.
Harry confused of what he heard kept his silence.
“He’s not here all day. What do you think that meant?”
He wasn’t able to focus on his work as midnight rolled around with no single word from his boyfriend. He doesn’t like this. They just patched up an issue recently and have wonderful make up sex. He had just communicated what he feels and now, this is happening.
He grumbled annoyed at the prospect of not being able to tell that story. For now, that is. He giggled, forming a plan in his mind how to best tell the story and exaggerate it a bit.
Draco was beginning to swim in the sensations. His cock desperate for release as it leaked precum to his lower abdomen, thighs trembling. He shivered profusely when Harry suddenly snaked a hand to his stomach down to his pelvis to the tip of his hand,
He found Harry drooling on the couch and for some reason, he found his sleeping form so serene. Almost as if he wasn’t the mood destroyer, destructive threat and just the usual idiot who feeds on annoying him with his mere presence.
“Where are you, Harry?” he murmured to himself as he sat down at the couch restlessly. He continued to toy with his fingers and his eyes kept on looking at the time then to the window to try to get a glimpse outside. His ears are strained enough so he could hear if any little noise roars outside.
Harry blinked, keeping his eyes on the man. He wanted to ask him questions, wanting and needing an answer but he’s not even sure if Malfoy would want to be at least civil with him. Are they still enemies? Are they still fighting? Is Malfoy still going to sneer at him?
“Please don’t say that they are just words” Draco sighed, “Darling, don’t say that, alright?”
He discovered that Harry's bed is in utter chaos because the sheets and the blanket is not in its proper place and a pillow is in the floor. How is Harry sleeping? Eagle? Starfish?
“Oh wow, didn’t expect all the muscles up here” he squeezed his biceps and chuckled.
“Baby boy, can you hear me?”
Draco grumbled in annoyance as he scanned the bookshelves, trying his hardest to look for one certain book he has to study for the upcoming quiz next Monday.
“My name is plastered on that damn tabloid! How can I calm down?!”
He knew he’s such an arsehole for that but he really didn’t give it much thought when he flew away. He was so desperate to get out of there that he completely had forgotten Draco’s feelings on this.
Harry smiled up to him, presenting that small black box and when he opened it, Draco may have exploded right then and there.
Draco is startled to hear Harry’s voice when he arrived. He even thought he was dreaming but when he raised his head to look, he saw emerald eyes staring at him arduously.
He can even smell his scent here. Merlin, so good.
“What do you think? I’ll help you relax those muscles and spoil our little beanie with kisses” he whispered, head leaning down.
Fuck.
“Sergeant Harry Potter, love. I am Sergeant Harry Potter of the Serpent Crew of ‘15” He peck a kiss on his lips, “Remember that name because someday, you’ll have that beside yours”
Draco nodded and Harry allowed himself to let out a small smile before turning it back to what it was seconds ago.
“We have every styles from different brands. We also have the latest editions on display and are all limited edition” The male informed and directed them to heels Dracy found beautiful. However, one pair caught her eyes. But before she could inspect it further, Harry spoke and pointed at a pair of red pumps.
Then he began to walk away again and Harry followed. He noticed they are walking towards the west wing before his eyes kept going downwards again.
Harry have gone fucking commando underneath his jeans.
“We’re not that kind of couple, you dog” Lucius said with a defeated sigh. Turning to look at the Cissy’s cousin who managed to get an appointment with the man he’s talking about.
He sighed and walked downstairs.
He’s never got a flirty customer before and if this escalates worse, he’s afraid to make a scene and cause problems for Harry and his business.
"Mother, father, I don't need an Auror!" He whined and stomped his feet. He doesn't need an auror! He's as fine as he is!
Merlin. If this is his idea of making up to her, he can do whatever he wants.
Stay safe and healthy! I'd be delighted to hear from you! <3
“Oh, hi. Didn’t see you there” Harry mumbled.
“Come on. They’re here”
He made sure to get her and with one promise of a wealthy ease, Dracy happily (or maybe not) accepted his offer.
She hasn’t really been in the public much since Harry took her out to Diagon Alley and she’s not complaining. To stay inside the comfort of Harry’s house is enough for her. She wouldn’t trade it for going out but circumstances have made her compromise.
“P-please” he whispered and Harry smirked.
Harry played with Draco balls. His hands gliding it softly. So smooth and so soft. He groaned and decided to take his trousers off with a wave. He was left on his boxers that had a wet patch onto them, feeling so horny. He wanted his hard cock inside him. Wanted to feel how his hole would clench around his cock and how tight it would feel.
A game that can only end in one possible outcome.
Can he wandlessly cast a holy aguamenti here? Fuck. The image of Draco on his stomach as he massages those thighs, back, shoulder is so sinfully realistic in his mind. It was if it's already happening in front of him.
Lucius didn’t answer immediately so she continued, “You left me with nothing. I had to endure disgusting things to survive while you ran off with someone and enjoying what life can give you”
She smiled, “Yes, please” she quickly answered, questions of what he’s been doing flew out of her mind.
Sirius butted in and gave Harry a wink, “That’s another problem, Moony. How should he approach the kid? How should he open the topic?”
Ginny sighed and pulled away, resting her elbows on the railing as they kept the watch above, “I didn’t”
Dracy extended her hand and offered for Harry to take, “Please, need you”
Walking over and grabbing a handful, Draco went to the counter and began his work. Harry have taught him about flower arrangements and since he’s been helping out here for a month now, Draco already got a hand for it.
He looked at his wrist watch and smiled. About time.
Slowly, Harry lifted the towel off, just enough for them to take a glance. He smiled joyfully at what he saw before returning the towel back to its place. His hand wormed its way around Dracy’s head while the other gently pulled them closer to his.
I have chapter 5 finished which is a lot shorter than this but I'm thinking of editing and adding some stuff in it to set the mood (I have no idea what mood I'm talking about but maybe just for the sentiment haha)
“I guess it’s a success, huh?” Harry smirked as he laughed before rolling off of him.
His emerald eyes were dark, angry, and all things hot. There’s a slight edge into them, a pang of desperation to claim, own, and mark him but there was also a slice of jealousy and doubt. Draco’s heart clenched at the sight as he took a deep breath.
Dracy bucked her hips before she tried to scramble away, unable to carry on even more. Harry noticing the action, pulled back and smiled at her.
He was covered in love bites. A good amount of love bites. He traced the one on his neck to his chest, shivering when bits of what had happened last night came into his mind unintentionally. The way Harry’s mouth sucked and bit on his neck and the way his tongue would lick and roll over to the crevice of his collarbone.
He tried not to say anything else about how his chest thundered when he speaks, to the way how his fingers trembled on their places when Malfoy raised his head and rolled his eyes.
"H-harry!"
Draco watched him suck his own cum off his fingers, rolling his hips in the process and whimpering as Harry sucked hard.
"We're going to the Nott Residence. Do your know where that is?" Draco asked him and felt Harry nodded.
Why didn’t he answer?
He sobbed and mewled, feeling the tightening of his balls to the base of his cock.
He snorted, resting his chin on her shoulder. Before he took the book out of her hands and saw it was one of the five pregnancy books they got to their venture around the bookstore in Diagon Alley.
He gulped.
"If you wish to go somewhere, tell me and I will accompany you. But only within the time frame of 9 in the morning to 6 in the evening. My time onwards will be allotted to my work"
She bit her lips as her eyes begin to travel down her body. It used to look starved and five meals away from giving up but days living with Harry had done her such wonders. She can see how she filled up nicely and it made her breasts perked up more.
“They’ll protect you the same way my necklace protects me from Nargles” she smiled and waved a hand, “I think you’re fine, Pansy. Just needs to eat some pudding”
“Why?” he asked confused even though he felt the flutter in his heart.
“Go pack, sweetling. We’re moving to our place tomorrow”
“My breasts” she whispered shyly, “They’re itchy and heavy”
“Harry, oooh, harder”
“Alright, alright. I apologize, sweet sugar omega. What’s the problem?” he willed himself to be serious and crossed his arms for the effect.
He smelled the whiff of alcohol in Harry’s breath and noticed his rosy cheeks, “You’re drunk” he stated.
Draco downed the glass of alcohol and Harry was quick to catch him when he accidentally slip on his feet. Merlin, he’s as light as a snitch and soft as a marshmallow.
Weeks ago, he was this mysterious, collected man. Now, Dracy sees no one but a man who’s trying to change, trying to sway her off her feet. Beyond every possibility her mind could shape.
“Please,” he begged of something even he cannot specify, “
“They aren’t just words, Harry. Words led me to rebel, words let me take the dark mark, words let me be this way. Words led me be beaten up by hundreds of crucios and canes. Words led me think so badly of myself. Words led me to a certain stage in life where I thought of something harmful”
The two Aurors nodded and moved while Harry turned back to the others, “The rest of you in the conference and wait for me”
“Good morning, baby boy” Harry murmured, his eyes flicking up and smirking as their eyes meet.
The eyes that stare at him, watching every reaction Harry elicits from him. Staring and looking. Almost as if waiting for the right time to pounce and do what he wants to do.
Lily easily putting the puzzles together, looked at her husband with that familiar grin, “You wanna step in, Potter?”
Maybe it also stems as to how Harry literally owns a successful flower shop, dealing with people and assisting them of what they need.
He was right. Something just happened. His breathing grew quite heavy and sweat starts to form in his temple as they stare at one another.
What will he gonna say, anyway? How will he going to open the topic?
“Shut up” he whined and crossed his arms, “What are you actually doing here?”
With the confidence Draco suddenly is feeling, he straightened his posture and smiled, “Are you the dom?”
“H-hello” she said and looked at Harry who smiled at her, “Hermione, Ron, this is Dracy, Dracy, these are my friends” he introduced.
“Ye! Blimey!” Seamus laughed, “Lemme, Gin. Gonna blow shit up” he clapped playfully.
“What something?”
She looked around the room. The style wasn’t at all that elegant but it was nice and simple. There’s a circle table in the center, a bouquet of tulips and a waiter who smiled and bowed his head as a greeting upon their arrival.
“Fuck, I miss you so much” Harry whispered huskily, biting on his earlobe.
He eyed him oddly and frowned. That’s not what he wanted to talk about. Harry needs a fresh perspective here.
"This will be your room, Harry." Draco gestured for him to go inside and this is not the guest room he stayed in last night.
He closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against hers, needing her to cum already as he began to feel that pleasurable feeling in his balls, the tightening, and the faltering of his pace. He needed to cum but would not.
She gulped and toyed with her fingers. There are a lot of possibilities that could happen and she doesn’t think she can handle to be outside with Harry, the whole world to see and newly gossip about.
Unfortunately, little did he know, the time he apparated away was the time Harry arrived in front of the house.
“How’s life with her?”
He was a bit afraid to get too dependent on this strange relationship— is it even okay to call it one?
He cannot stop looking at her breast, the milk sliding down to the side of her breast and it was such a sight that Harry wasn’t able to control himself. He stick his tongue out to catch the milk, gathering it inside his mouth and groaning at the taste.
“Sir Potter, how surprising to see you visit” she spoke kind and not judging. Somehow, it made Dracy feel a bit better.
He knew that. But he was expecting he'll be married to a yummy pureblood wizard. Preferably French or Russian with a thick accent and a good amount of galleons on their vaults.
It didn’t take long until everyone had to go home for the holidays, leaving the Hogwarts all to those who decided to stay. Mostly them and some first years who wondered what Christmas is like in Hogwarts.
“I never thank you” he whispered, “For all the things you did for me. I also never apologized for the things I did to you”
It makes her crave for him more. The way the material hung to him like it belongs there all the time and the way it rightly fit and the good kind overwhelming.
“We will but that’s for later. Don’t worry for now, baby”
It was too much.
Harry chuckled at his winsome trait as he settled his gaze at the ceiling, focusing on something that has been in his mind since his conversation with Luna. It’s been bothering him nonstop throughout the day and no matter how much he brushes it off, he cannot seem to.
Harry sighed. If only it would be that easy to not worry. He’s spent years of his life doing just that, it is not so easy to give up old habits. He was pretty sure he’d also been called
He nodded back and turned back to read at the documents or at least he tried to focus.
He’s got this fiery intensity and not to mention, the ability to drive everyone insane. He got this laid back aura at times but have this clawing hotness often seen at nights when he’s out there, having fun, having to bed every willing omegas out there.
He grabbed Draco’s lacy panties discarded to the side of the couch and put it on his back pocket as he stood up. When Draco cried out, Harry was quick to get to him and turned him around softly. He put a hand under his thighs and upper body and easily carried him to his bedroom.
“Harry” she kissed him on his cheeks and brushed her nose at it after, trying to get his scent to hers. It was intoxicating and addicting, “Harry, please”
"And he cannot come with us. His grandmother is severely sick and she doesn't want him to see her to such state." Mr. Malfoy added to his wife's statement.
He gulped and shook his head. How he wishes it’s one of them but this is ridiculous.
They decided to walk around for the next minutes. Stopping for a second when they find things interesting and laughing when they see something they thought is silly. It was the recollection of some memories they had in their last Hogsmeade trip that had Draco smiling more.
She removed the glasses and gestured towards the path, “I think we missed the carriages. I hope we’ll be on time to have some pudding”
Where is he anyway? After successfully removing the handcuffs, he was quick to take his phone where it’s hiding and saw several missed calls and texts from Harry, not the man of his dreams.
As they fell into a smooth conversation, he completely ignored his boyfriend beside him. Luke knows his way into conversations and Draco found himself giggling and laughing at the jokes thrown over his way.
Wrong in what way?
“Well, as you see, I bumped into Tom while I was finishing up with my jog and luckily for us, he invited me to his place. Nothing suspicions but the surprising amount of bank transfer from various people” he held out a flash drive and smirked, “And I got his schedule in there. He’s pretty busy”
Harry didn’t answer but his eyes flashed something cold before tilting his head, “What’s my lesson?”
to the public. Man, there was a reason he didn’t audition for the Hollywood.
"But you're still visiting your lovely father right?" James faked sob and Sirius followed, "I need an owl everyday, little prongs"
The soft huffs of breaths coming from the man to the way his hands trailed to cup the back of his head to massage his hair, he knew he had lost. There’s something in him Draco cannot quite name. Something in him he longed to have and what is it is the mystery.
Somehow, the idea of being controlled didn't annoy him. In fact, Draco likes it. The thought of being controlled by the Head Auror is turning him on. Because he can very much see how skilled Harry is and how he would love to be manhandled by the experienced. Teach him things guys in Draco's age don't know. Show him things guys in Draco's age are not aware of. And make him feel things guys Draco's age are incapable of.
“You’ve been awfully distracted, mate? Anything happened when you and Malfoy fainted?” Dean asked with a smirk.
“Merlin, look at you” Harry filthily whispered. He loved the way Draco writhed under him but nonetheless, pliant.
“C’mon, talk to me, angel” the tone Harry was using was enough to crumble Draco’s stubbornness down. But no, no. He cannot.
So far he doesn't know a lot of things that can tell him who he is as a man but he learned some things.
He just happily showed them a magic to conclude all of his explanations and the revelations of who he is. James had gone paler and his aristocratic aura had been lessened to that one eating in disbelief and one blink away from fainting.
“That’s… nice” he hesitated, not quite sure how to pay some kindness to the woman he used to call
They’re family. She’s very much contented of what they are having right now. She fully trusts him to take care of her and he’s doing a good job right now.
Her eyes almost popped out of its socket for the sheer surprise it got to her, “AAAAH! NOOO!”
“We’ve been having good time, doll” the patience in this man was astounding. Should he be scared? Or amazed?
Harry looked back and he was the one to raise an eyebrow at Draco this time, “I have rough hands”
“You will,
He bent down, beginning to gently lap on her jawline, tongue sticking out to lick the contour of it as he thrust his hips to Dracy’s clothed core. She trembled in need as her scent brushed up his nostrils and he growled.
Draco pouted, “It’s Saturday”
"This is where the library is. Thousands of books if you want, many of which are from my favorite writer Valsken Vokbin, have you read his new book entitled 'Love between boundaries'?"
It adds up like spices.
He nibbled on his lips as he tried to forget the kiss Harry gave him. He wasn’t sure if it was a deliberate action or something he did absentmindedly. And if it was done consciously, Draco thinks it rouses more suspicions than one might think.
And even when Draco didn’t want to, he salivated at those muscles and that aura to walk out so sexily. It’s no lie that Harry is extremely hot and still a very powerful man under that playboy exterior and just that knowledge is enough to keep Draco in his knees—toes, in his toes.
“How rough you want me to be?” he allowed himself to ask as he put pressure on his palms and pushed it over that petite frame. He can do this in any way or better yet, every way.
“Yes. After all, this gentleman deserves to have some fun” she knew she’s risking it, she knows she’s putting herself to peril, trapping her to what awaits her but she’s enjoying it. Enjoying the way there’s an immediate tick in his sharp jaw and the way his eyes flashed with annoyance, "With me"
Neville shot his hands up and grinned sheepishly, “I’m just reading from the list, Harry”
He knows the kinds of Auror his parents would hire. Strict, stern and balding. Someone who doesn't know fun or enjoyment or parties. Someone that would restrain him the joys of his young life. Someone that would confine him inside the house like he's on house arrest and he wouldn't like someone that's so boring, he'd prefer death to meet.
He just gained another enemy— his mind.
“So, what can I get you? Roses for your girl? Daisies? Sunflowers? Lilies?”
The way he sniffed her isn’t something creepy, it was relaxing. The way those strong arms hugged her securely, pulling her to that rock hard chest, and inhaled the scent Harry released on his own. Providing her what she had provided for him as well.
Would Harry ever give this up or would Draco be the one to let things go? Follow Harry’s way because he’s the one in control? He cannot help but wonder how things are if the two of them settle in peace.
What’s dress up for this little alone time for them both? Have been nothing but perfect. She wanted to thank him but what sincerity will her words hold if she do nothing to prove them?
Not even five years to the marriage and this man is full of secrets already. Well, not like this is something true, right? He grumbled and waited for minutes until the front door opened.
“Harry?”
“Look at you. Such a slut for me. I love you, kitten. Always so eager to have me, so accepting of everything I give you. Always wanting me to make you cum, huh?”
He turned around and impulsively touched him by the chest and pushed him.
His forehead creased and his lips pulled down. Looking away, he met Luna’s eyes who offered another of her dreamy smile.
She breathed deeply before shaking her head as an answer. She looked at him in the eyes when Harry pushed her thighs open, his hand dangerously close to her cunt. Harry pecked her on her lips before finally letting a finger to the center of her pussy covered by the lacy knickers she’s wearing.
He raised his hand, cupping his cheeks before letting it fall down and gripped his neck, “What do you say, kitten?”
“I think you’d be charming” Draco murmured honestly, “I’ll really have my daddy then”
“Good morning!”
He’s beautiful because he have these subtle ways that makes him stand out. He have this poise, elegance that managed to dance with his presence. When he walks into the room, Harry cannot take his eyes off of him.
His lips parted. What?… How?
He just finished changing into some pajamas when the door opened and Harry walked in, strutting with casual expression as he threw his hoodie on his bed, leaving him with his white shirt and some sweatpants.
He rewarded her a passionate kiss, starting the play. His tongue danced with her, coaxing another noise from her before pulling away.
He is officially corrupted by his own mind, of his own sexual urges. Fucking hell! He groaned and stood up.
“But as your amazing godfather, I shall provide help!” Sirius raised his bottle in the air, “Let’s go talk to Re instead!”
Just wanna be filled with his cum then be loved afterwards. But this is as good as the other too.
Draco moaned, hips moving on his own to meet Harry’s thrust.
Harry caught his wrist and stopped him, “It’s late. You’re tired. Let me drive you and I’m off”
Claiming is easy. He can claim her in various ways but if Ron meant claiming her and bond with her is something Harry should ponder seriously. Bonding meant mating and mating meant lifetime.
He’s an Alpha who’s taught how to really be one. He may be domineering in the eyes of others but he will not for someone that would live with him.
Draco scoffed and began to weep and glared at his laptop screen. He’d been crying all day, all night and pretty sure in the upcoming months. Pansy was correct! That bastard is a lying scumbag! How dare him! How dare him!
“It’s fine Dobby” Harry cut him off with a firm tone. Dobby smiled apologetically and got back to cooking.
And that, that unimaginable kind of  an asshole being cheated on him! Why would he? He’s gorgeous, magnificent skin care routine, inspiring diet, nice yoga exercises, sexy body, beautiful blond hair, and overall, one of a kind. He’s a star that should be treated as a universe!
No shit, Sherlock.
Draco gulped, finding himself liking the control Harry was showing. Perhaps this service is going to be worth it after all.
"How long have you been there?" he fake asked.
He was floating. He cannot believe this is how good Harry is with his tongue. Perhaps, from all of his playboy extravaganza, he was able to get techniques and learned how to do things.
“We’re going to get drunk! Come on!” Pansy pulled him roughly inside and Draco’s eyes got blurry with all the lights dancing and all the smell of alcohol and cigarettes and he shook his head with all the memories coming in.
“Like it, baby boy?” Harry pulled away as he saw Draco’s expression.
When his instinct tells him something feels weird, he knew he’s right.
Maybe there was a reason Harry is his superior.
“Good morning, sir” Dobby greeted.
Dreaded upon the realization, Draco didn’t do anything but bury his face in the man’s neck. Even from the beginning he didn’t stand a chance.
“I. . .
“Harry” she whimpered rather than answering his question, “touch me” she shamelessly demanded.
He turned and began to walk away but stopped when he noticed that Harry wasn’t following him.
“Leo” Tom called a little louder and Draco tensed for a bit, relaxing when he felt Harry rubbing his sides gently.
“I’m busy”
“Where are we?” she mumbled, eyes scanning the place in awe.
He didn’t hear Draco answer so he looked at him and there he saw an obvious guilt written on his face. He was fast to straighten immediately but to clarify, not with his sexuality.
All in all, it is nothing but magical. He was right. The man in Harry is so mindblowing. To be able to successfully have him on his bed, Draco wished next to have himself on Harry’s bed where he would be atop him and ride that huge hard cock. Feel those muscles for the second time around and hopefully, have a third time and more times.
He was provided with a warm cup of the tea, his palms holding the cup as he tried to held the man’s gaze. Eyes still begging, pleading not to make him suffer. He remained kneeling in front of him, as he moved to removed the gun holster around him and laying it at the table behind him. The heavy clanking nearly made him jump.
Wow… Oh, wow. Harry suddenly became his own version of Adonis. Albeit a little messy. Overnight, the man managed to transform into a shining shimmering splendid view. His disguise suited him nicely. He went for the bad boy looks. Black jeans, white sando, dog tags, his tattoos peeking out of his chest and biceps, five o’clock shadow and those veins.
Draco gulped and nodded, “Yes, sir”
Harry blinked in confusion before he spoke, “That would be very disrespectful on my hospitality, doll. I should give you at least a blissful stay”
“Want to see the baby, ‘arry. Please” she forced her eyes open and he contemplated for a bit. She clearly needed to rest but he wouldn’t want to forbid her of this moment right now.
Draco discreetly look at his parents, seeing both of them have this surprise look on their faces. Serves them right. Still wanna marry him off to a muggle??
“That’s nice!”  Hermione clapped back.
“Fuck,
He sat there with his jaw on the floor, watching Harry swagger his way out.
Thank you for the kudos and comments! Love you! <3
As he was few feet away from her door, he smelled something so utterly familiar.
And Draco is your princess dairy cream. Bratty. Does nothing but roll his eyes because just the knowledge that Harry is breathing surge annoyance deep within. He can feel that pang of desire to kick the man in the face, bruise him into oblivion and maybe, maybe if he had the chance throw him into the unknown and never let him get back.
Lucius and Narcissa stood in silence. Their eyes hovering over the two figures, one reading a newspaper while the other is drinking a cup of coffee at her hand. Normally, Lucius wouldn’t like this kind of situation. Almost as if they were in some desperate need for protection but he had no choice but to drop his pureblood ego and stomp on it for a while.
“Is Dracy here?”
Perhaps Draco had an impression wrong. He felt like slipping off already and they have not even shared a real kiss yet.
He whined before slowly nodding.
Her mind tried to rear back to the incident yesterday but she did not let it win. She was thoroughly pampered yesterday. Harry, as soon as they came back, immediately reassured her and spoilt her of his attention. He bathed her, helped her slipped into one of his shirts before laying her down on his bed and ate her out, guiding her to relax while murmuring praises after praises.
“Depends on how rough you want to be, daddy” he answered boldly.
“Draco” he begged and Draco sobbed and pouted so adorably, looking at him with those googoo eyes that drove him to be so fucking bad.
He sighed and bit on Draco’s shoulder as he took his time stretching the boy. He murmured some compliments but he wasn’t even aware how it sounded but he made sure to sound saccharine and it did everything to drive Draco insane with need.
"Not particularly, no, I sense more discomfort from you," Harry remarked, sitting back against his chair. Draco narrowed his eyes and cocked his head slightly to the side.
"You look better today." Harry nodded and checked his watch. 20 more minutes. "Do you have plans?" Draco, never missing a beat, asked checking his own watch.
"Could I borrow that book?" Harry suddenly asked, Draco raised an eyebrow then shrugged and handed it over.
Needs- Verzache
"I should go."
Harry pulled his mug up and took a sip of the warm liquid. Why else would two people be married? Harry smiled, making Draco turn back around.
"Oh! You're awake!" Harry nodded and moved over to the island. "How did you sleep?" Harry smiled and straddled a stool.
Somebody That I Used To Know- Goyte
"I'm fine, Draco." Draco slumped against the island.
"I'm telling myself that you are confusing your feelings for me; Harry you hated me now you're actually going to sit there and tell me that you have feelings for me?"
"Because you flinch silly." Then he walked inside, letting the french door slam behind him. Harry stood in the garden for at least another five minutes before finally coming inside.
^*^*^*^*^*^*^
mean they are a
The pale man reached out and took the slip gently from Harry, their fingers momentarily resting on one another's. Unfolding it carefully, he read over what was there.
Pulling his hand down, he removed his ring from his bony finger. Shoving it in his coat pocket, he knocked on the door with convection.
"I'm going to take a shower. I'd take another pain potion if I were you." Then Draco set off down the hall towards their bedroom.
"Have you ever thought of us dating before?" Ron looked confused by Harry's question, "Nevermind, it was silly."
"Fine, Ginny and I are sitting them down on my next meeting with them to see how they want the visitation set up. I think I have a good idea of what they are going to pick." Harry responded, keeping his eyes trained on the other man's coat.
Shaking his head roughly, Draco signed his name, forever staining the page. Flipping the pages back to the first, he stood and stretched. Maybe, he should stay, stay and help, help Harry figure everything out but at what point was enough-enough?
"Well, I can't help I feel the same all the time! I'm just fine. Could I write fine down? I think you would be angrier over that."
This was not the first time this red-head had straddled Harry, smelling and feeling of all the things Harry held dear.
Harry was dressed in his red uniform and sat with his legs spread. He had half considered skipping today's visit, yearning for a shower and his bed.
She would never forgive them.
"I was married twice, yes, but I was going to school for something else before my marriage ended. I had actually meet Theo before then." Draco paused, "I guess I switched because of him."
Draco had first fallen in love with the slightly disproportional, unruly haired prick who hated him. But now, Harry was a very talented and beautiful grown man. If Draco fell in love with that, he could understand anyone falling in love with the man now.
"At Hogwarts." Draco said through a sigh, "I offered to become friends, but I also insulted your only friend as well, so you turned me down. Which is when I began hating you and decided if I couldn't be your friend, I was going to be your enemy, then at least I would be a part of your life."
He nodded then went about writing something, "Most, yes."
Draco didn't speak for a long moment, "Yes." Then the blonde stood and walked over to his desk, grabbing one of the many framed photos sitting there.
"But not really at the same time," Draco continued almost wistfully, "I have a son, he was by the first marriage so I did everything to try to keep us together, to not tear him away from his perfect little family,"
"Why?"
I put that note in the beginning just because I couldn't do the bolding and such here in the notes section, so again, things that are in italic mean they are thoughts, things that are italic and bolded mean they are a memory. Hope you are enjoying it!
"What made you want to become a divorce therapist?" Harry asked, watching Draco carefully. Draco inhaled deeply.
"It's not much, but it's home." He showed Ackley to the guest bedroom where he pulled clean lines down to dress the bed. After that, they went back into the living room where they talked about Purebloods by the fireplace over a bottle of whiskey.
"You look at my pictures every time you come in, look over my bookshelf, what I'm wearing, you ask questions subtle enough that most people wouldn't give another thought to answering them, but are actually prying in their own way."
Later when they were curled up in Harry's bed, catching their breaths Harry thought back to Ron's question. He hadn't even known of Gala.
Sorry for the wait again! But! We've made it!
Harry hummed and moved back into the living room, Draco trialling along after him. Harry plopped down in his armchair and offered Draco to sit. He did and Harry watched him try to figure out what to do with his giraffe legs.
I think that it's pretty sad I know more about the Black and Malfoy family line than I know about my own!
"Alright Harry, slow down!" Draco was standing by the door, trying to take in everything the other man was saying. "You did what now?" Harry took a deep breath and fell back into the leather armchair.
Looking up, Draco took off his reading glasses and looked over Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Draco's voice rang out from the other side Harry entered. Upon walking in he saw a young man sitting in front of Draco. He had the signature Malfoy blonde hair and was lithe just like his father.
He thought about Percy's question for a long while. "You don't have to answer if you don't want to Draco, I just wondered if something had happened."
This is one of Harry, at a promotion or something, he's dressed in red, all red, and there's a guy, standing too close to him smiling.
A few beats of silence, "Are you married still?" God damned Gryffindor courage, always getting in the way of silence Harry thought.
Harry chuckled. When was the last time he did that? "It is what I do for a living after all." Draco smiled and wrote something down.
Harry sighed heavily making Ron turn, "What is it?"
"Content."
Flicking again the stove turned on and water filled the pot. Then it began boiling, moving into the kitchen he pulled a glass down and dropped a teabag into it.
"Well I guess that can only be answered by you, did you take advantage of him or the situation?" Harry shook his head profusely.
"Have you read all those books?" Harry tore his attention to Dracos face, where a small, warming smile sat on his face.
He then dusted his trousers off and walked over to his desk.
Harry sighed into Draco's chest and pulled the man tighter against him. Harry placed a light kiss on Dracos neck then pulled back.
"Your parents and your grandparents were killed because they snitched, they weren't coming after your adoptive parents, they were coming after you."
Slipping under the covers, he felt Harry shift in the bed. Flipping over, Harry buried himself into Draco's arm and promptly fell back to sleep.
'What's that you say? Drarryandmycat finally updated Forgetting the Best? It's only been a year!'
"So they came to kill me?" Harry nodded.
"The people close to me, everyone who has stuck with me through the bad and good days. My children are another." He heard Ackley flip the page to his book.
"Oh, the Bulstrode's." Draco was flipping through each page slowly, licking the tip of his finger before touching the page, "The Nott family as well."
"What do you make of my life then?" Of all the questions he expected Draco to ask, that was not one. Harry took a minute to consider this, then leaned back.
He woke up with a start. Draco had come to bed and was sleeping peacefully beside him. The screaming was back and full fleed now. He didn't want to wake Draco, so he slowly climbed from the bed. Draco flipped over but made no other moves.
Harry sighed heavily and pulled out the same small slip of paper. Draco unfolded it and read through words.
Slinging his coat over the island, he grabbed a glass and began pouring some wine in it. Leaning against the wall, he sipped on the reds and tried to relax. Closing his eyes, he let the blackness take over. The silence of the house echoed around him and made his deep breathing seem loud.
It reminded Harry of the Burrow.
Billion laid kisses to Harry's neck, then hugged him tighter. "I want you to come over again, sometime real soon, alright?" Harry nodded against the man's chest, taking a deep breath of his cologne. Then the man pulled away and was out the door.
Throwing the boy down on the bed he slowly climbed on top, summoning a bottle of lube, he rubbed it between his hands, then, slowly, he stuck a finger into the blonde.
Oh lord! So, here's my excuse for not updating, um, school! We recently started back up again and it has kicked. my. ARSE! If you read Unrequited Love you knew that I was hoping to post today! Well, I did it! I'm not very happy with this chapter but its a chapter. So here, take this little chapter! I will hopefully have some more chapters posted more frequently this week and have more of a schedule!
Once Harry's uniform top had fallen to the ground he busied himself with Draco's trousers. Once he had them undone, Draco did Harry's. Soon enough he was sheathed in Draco.
Much love and happy reading from a fellow Potterhead,
"I have questions for you." Draco smiled and moved to sit beside Harry on the bed.
Harry traced his fingers over the one that ran deeply over Draco's heart. Sighing he ran his hands over the blonde's abdomen, pushing him back against the wall.
Harry made his way up the winding path of his drive, hearing the gravel crunch under his boots. He was beaten and bruised from a last-minute raid, and wanted nothing more than a glass of tea and bed.
"It seems like you're always grading papers." Draco smiled and nodded solemnly.
"I don't' think so, I mean, why? What's the point? ~ I'm going to say it all with them." Ackley smiled and took a sip of tea. "What about you?" Harry asked.
"Draco, I would love to continue, but I think you should slow down. You've only just broken up with Harry after years of marriage. All of the feelings will eventually catch up with you!"
McGonagall as firm as ever had the strict expression on her face and one eyebrow raised. She perused them for a moment, standing in front of them and clearing her throat before speaking, “How are you feeling?”
When he planned for rough, he had not expected this kind of treatment.
Oh, what an adorable boyfriend.
Harry walked out of the house first and Draco followed, "Do you want to go somewhere else?"
Draco whimpered, hands feeling Harry’s rippled biceps. The strong ones that never failed not to show weakness when they are together, holding him up as if he was no heavier than a sack of rice and the ones that held him down when it came too overwhelming.
Dracy looked at her swelling belly. She cannot believe how fast the days are. In the first trimester of her pregnancy, she cannot stop looking at herself in the mirror. Cannot stop staring at her belly and cannot stop talking to their little beanie.
He ignored the coughs and gasps around them and continued walking. Smirking triumphantly when he heard those familiar footsteps.
“Ow! What was that for?” he grumbled. Fuck. That slap is fucking painful. How did Draco manage to have a mark first? Harry expected he gets to have spanking first.
He buried his face in his back and inhaled his scent. He smells of dark chocolates and the strong distinct smell of forest, created by the wars he magnificently faced alone when there was a massacre among the Auror force months ago.
“H-harry” he called, more of an unconscious reaction rather than intentional response.
“’arry, ooh, harder, harder!”
His right hand moved from its position on the wall, fingers skimming along his cheeks, gently and smoothly. He began to trace various shapes as his eyes stared through his. Draco gulped, not having the strength to look away from the intensity those eyes held for him.
Draco looked around the restaurant they are in. The place is actually refreshing with a homey-like interior design with quite a few guests dining in for their lunch as well. When Harry pulled him his seat, he sat down and accepted the menu the waiter handed him.
Just what had he done? AGAIN?!
He took a deep breath, watching the muscles on Harry’s back flex as he moved and grabbed something from the cabinet. The way they danced along his skin on sync, as if there were some guide helping them.
Draco was cut off when the cauldron blasted and hitting the both of them of its contents straight in their faces. It burned as the two of them doubled in pain and complains, crying out loud for some help.
And lastly, Draco who’s obviously the only one dedicated in reviewing.
She hummed silently as she finished making Harry’s morning coffee. She set it on his usual seat whenever they eat and began to cook simple breakfast after. She’s not much of a good cook and even the simple meals she knows how to make had taken her months of practice in order to master at least a tolerable taste.
Magical.
“Fuck, d-daddy” Draco moaned loudly, his hips rolling, feeling Harry’s straining erection over his ass, “Please, please. Need you”
She did.
The hidden meaning and indication that came with those questions is something that tickled Harry's nape. The excitement is building and increasing inside him and what disaster and blessing would it be for the upcoming days he's gonna stay with the Young boy in their Manor.
He didn’t bother to get up, feeling the sting of his sole and the pain around his ankles and the exhaustion, all he wanted to do was to close his eyes and let sleep take over.
It didn’t help that Harry have decided to go for something that catches attention. Simple yet confidently carried. Ripped jeans, fitted Henley shirt. Nice package. Everyone is eyeing him as if he was the last piece of chicken drumsticks on the table and the ice in the middle of the summer.
Draco shook his head before he leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, his left hand untangling from his nape to rub at his chest, “Always you, Harry”
“Ask me” Harry whispered, lips suddenly enclosing around his lobe and prodded at it mockingly.
He was about to turn the door open when he stopped when he heard sobbing.
“Potter where are Granger and the Weasel?” He looked around Potter's shoulder up and down the hallway. “We need to get you to McGonagall, or maybe Pomfrey would be better…”
Harry jolted awake, breathing harshly, his heart beating a mile a minute and his body covered in cold sweat.
Draco was a mess. He’d decided to take a walk around Hogwarts despite the late hour (or was it early?) because he was freaking out inside. He’d been at Hogwarts for weeks already and he had no idea how he was going to fulfill the Dark Lord’s stupid, insane, impossible task.
, not even for the Malfoy title but for
to prove his honesty.
Finally, Draco regained enough control of himself to peel Potter off of him, though when he let go, Potter tried to go in for another hug, so he ended up holding the sniffling Gryffindor at arm’s length by the shoulders.
“You’re alive, you’re alive. Thank god it worked. Draco. My Draco.”
What the hell? Was Potter hugging him? Was this some sort of prank after all?
He shivered in excitement and nerves.
In the secret corners of his soul, he might admit to having the slightest crush on the Gryffindor. Potter was annoyingly sincere and brave in the way story-book heroes were even if that made the two of them clash at every interaction. Plus, he was growing to be surprisingly beautiful for a man. Slim and graceful but still somehow masculine. But he would never in a million years admit to those thoughts. No one, not even Pansy or Blaise had an inkling.
Draco was again in shock at Potter's behavior and Potter's seemingly happy insistence on constant physical contact. He’d been stiffly following along for the sole reason that none of Potter's actions were threatening and he was honestly worrying about the boy’s mental health at this point. But he managed to nod. At the very least, this whole experience would make an interesting story and it was a nice break from the nervous pacing he’d been doing earlier. Just as long as the Dark Snake-face never found out about this.
Meanwhile, Draco wanted to map every corner of Harry’s mouth, he wanted to claim Harry and make him his. This was like his every secret fantasy come true. He had someone who loved him wholly and truly just for him and that person was the lovely Harry Potter, who he’d been trying to convince himself he cared nothing for, for years.
He didn’t go into detail about the ritual he finally found but told Draco that it involved a lot of human sacrifice and he still hadn’t been sure if it would work or if he would just die. He hadn’t cared much anymore and had in fact, considered suicide as a means of joining Draco multiple times over the years of his research.
What… Why…
Harry said that was probably when he broke. He told Draco that he realized he was probably not very stable anymore but he was going to protect Draco this time around.
Harry described his shock and horror at Draco’s death, his breakdown in the middle of Diagon and his screaming at the Order member. The Aurors had to arrest them both because Harry was flinging serious and deadly curses at the man in public. He wanted to hurt the man the way he was hurting and later wished he had simply killed him in retaliation. But Harry admitted that it was probably a good thing he didn’t because his fame might not have kept him out of prison if he had cast an unforgivable and he wouldn’t have been able to come back if he were in prison.
Draco was becoming very concerned about Potter. Someone must have done something, or maybe the stress of the Dark Lord finally made him crack. But Potter wasn’t making much sense and what in Merlin’s name did he mean about loving
No, this must be part of the prank. Or perhaps it was a prank on Potter? That would make much more sense. Some sort of charm making him do embarrassing things like hugging and crying on Draco. But it would be a rather mean-spirited prank. Not something he could see Potter’s friends doing. Not even those infernal Weasley twins would have done something like this…
He could feel Draco’s arms coming around him, patting his back gently and he couldn’t help but sob a bit harder. This Draco wasn’t a figure of his imagination. This Draco was real and could hug him back. He’d do anything for this Draco, anything at all to keep him solid and alive. But first, he needed to explain.
Very soon, Draco was forced to wrap his arms around Potter and stumbled a bit in an effort to stay standing as the sobbing boy leant all his weight on him.
Harry pulled back briefly, just far enough to make eye contact. “I’ll tell you everything, Draco. That way you’ll understand and maybe you’ll love me again.”
“No! You’re not listening, Draco! Just-just come with me.” Potter spun around, taking Draco’s hand in the process and lead him to the nearest empty classroom.
Then he heard the strangest sound. Almost like slapping, or more likely, flesh hitting the ground - feet? It was approaching rapidly.
How the hell was he supposed to kill Dumbledore?
Draco and Harry separated for the first time in hours as Harry sat up and pulled out his wand. Draco tried not to think about how cold he suddenly felt without Harry snuggled up to his side.
But it had worked and he was here and Draco was alive!
He looked around and smiled in the darkness of his bed curtains at Hogwarts.
Harry was so happy. He couldn’t remember the last time he was happy. Probably when Draco was last alive.
Draco didn’t know what to think. Potter was crazy, right? He hoped Potter was crazy.
Then he again took Draco’s hand like he had every right to, lead him over to the teacher’s desk, transfigured it into a soft looking couch and pushed Draco down onto the cushions before joining him, snuggling into Draco’s side with a contented sigh and manually wrapping Draco’s arm around his shoulder.
“I, Harry James Potter, hereby swear on my magic that everything I have told Draco this night has been true to the best of my knowledge. I came back in time after Draco’s death, I love him and I’d do almost anything for him.”
Potter was crying.
Closing the door, Potter whipped out his wand. But before Draco could react and cast a shield, Potter turned away, casting locking and privacy wards.
Then Harry talked about ‘the end of it all’. It started with something so small, someone had spotted them holding hands in muggle London. Then rumors began popping up. Someone followed them home, found out they lived together and virtual hell broke loose in the papers. The public was furious that ‘Death Eater scum’ was tarnishing their savior. They started going out less, Harry hoping to avoid the questions and attention, Draco hoping to avoid the hissed comments and glares. But a couple weeks later they couldn’t stay inside any longer and ventured out to Diagon to pick up some things. People reacted as if the news had just come out. Their weeks of waiting for public excitement to die down were worth nothing. People looked at Harry with pity and Draco with hatred. Finally, towards the end of the trip someone called out to them. Some old Order member was screaming that they would save Harry from corruption and without a second thought to the bystanders or Harry himself holding Draco’s hand, shot the killing curse at Draco.
All of her heat before have been handled with potions to contain in symptoms and lessen the pain she can feel for not having a knot inside her and for not having an Alpha she can mate or bond with.
he needed more.
And it is her fault for rummaging inside her old clothes and saw that thing and decided to try it!
Draco took a peek as he walked out of the room and realized he was in a huge house that is more quiet than silence itself.
“You literally have a problem right now, Mr. Potter”
Draco pouted, “But what if he won’t answer?”
you will, daddy. But touch me, please. Want to feel you already”
There's just no fucking way.
“Kneel” he repeated sternly, glaring at him.
“You do not, do not put use that playboy lines with me, Potter. I am warning you. I don’t care if you’re an Alpha. I will kick you in the balls”
Bloody fuck.
“Safewords, traffic system are important here. What’s your safeword, Draco?”
He sighed, “You’re fired”
“Prepare this bedroom for my omega immediately” Harry pointed at the room just beside his and Wily got into his work.
He shielded her to his back and taking all the eyes to him.
“Hmm. Try to convince yourself that” Harry hummed as he opened the foods he bought and serve Draco his own, not noticing the stares Draco is giving him.
He gulped and stood up. He wished he had a peak hole but no, he has to open the door to see who’s. Taking a deep breath, he willed himself to relax and he was wrong.
, to decorate the tree?” he said, crossing his arms over his chest, glaring at everyone doing anything but the task at hand.
Harry removed Draco’s lacy panties and pried his ass open, exposing the pink pucker that did nothing but wink at him teasingly, calling and enticing him. It looked so small and so tiny but Harry had seen Draco accommodated his whole easily, as if it was its home.
