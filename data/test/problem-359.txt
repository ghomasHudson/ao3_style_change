"Draco cannot continue to study here, so long as Harry Potter is under the same roof. I cannot allow it! Do you know how it feels to have your entire family legacy fragmented by your son? That is precisely what is happening, and I can't let it go any further! I don't know whether this thing he has for the Potter boy is a mutual sentiment, but-"
Harry was beginning to feel indignant, his ears a burning shade of red. "What's gotten you all up in a twist?"
Draco trembled and hastily looked away from the Death Eater, his eyes burning as tears filled them. His throat tightened, and he sobbed lightly. He was in denial. This had to be a nightmare.
Bubo nipped Draco thankfully on the finger and then took off, soaring upwards into the rafters and disappearing into the blue sky.
All Draco could do was nod in understanding. Finally, he stood, the room swaying slightly. He looked down at his hands. They were shaking violently. He felt Harry's hand fall gently on his shoulder, and he closed his eyes, focusing on Harry's reassuring touch.
He remembered how long he had craved this, staring at him from across classrooms, wondering what it would feel like to hold him, touch him, and kiss him. He wondered how it felt to have a conversation with him, one lacking maliciousness and snarling lips. He wondered what it felt like to be the one to make him smile and laugh, and he had been envious (Oh, so envious!) of Ron and Hermione. They had something with Harry that he wanted but thought he would never have.
"I don't bloody know," Draco laughed, "We'll switch partners. Granger likes me enough. I'll take her, and you can have Weasley."
"I love you," Harry said huskily, his throat tight. "I always did, I just. . . I didn't know it." He whispered it again. "I love you, Draco."
It was just his imagination. He was alone. . . Even though he was lying on the floor of a school bathroom, he wanted to enjoy this moment. Something felt perfect about it, though he couldn't put his finger on it. Maybe it was because, for now, he felt weightless, like a cloud drifting pleasantly across the early September sky.
"I love you, sweetheart," Narcissa Malfoy shot her son a troubled, anxious smile before curtly waving him farewell and disappearing as they walked through the brick wall and off of platform 9/3.
Draco squeezed him back with his uninjured arm, and Harry swore he heard him whimper softly into his shoulder. Harry felt something crumple beneath the Slytherin's robe.
Draco was terrified. There was no other word that he could think of that thoroughly described what he was feeling. As he followed Harry closely down the winding hall towards the Headmaster's Office, he could feel his heart jumping into his throat and then plunging into his stomach. It was a horrible, sickening feeling. There was nothing like it.
"There, there," he breathed, closing his eyes and gently rocking the young Gryffindor back and forth where they stood. "I don't know what you saw, but I'm here. I'm never leaving you, okay? You're stuck with me."
"Oh, perk up, Harry! Nothing's changed. He's still staying here." Hermione giggled, noticing Harry's crestfallen expression.
Draco started, quickly tugging down his sleeve as he cast an alarmed, wide-eyed glance over his shoulder.
Draco chuckled and shook his head. "No, it's alright. I deserve that one. Yes, other than myself, Weasley."
kind. He opened his mouth as wide as he could, his eyes burning with tears. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't fucking breathe!
Harry's voice called to him through the piercing sound of the thundering rain, and Draco glanced over his shoulder, losing his balance and stumbling over his own feet, plunging head-first into the muck. He tried desperately to get up, but the ground was slick and damp and cold enough to freeze against his skin.
Suddenly, excited voices stirred below, and Harry whirled around, instantly alert. He saw Draco tumbling down the stairs, his back twisted at an unnatural angle as he went, eyes rolled to the back of his sunken sockets.
Draco reached up with his free hand to gently slide his fingers along Harry's flushed cheek and into his wildly disheveled hair. "Do you know how long I wanted to be close to you like this? It was maddening."
"I'm gay, " he groaned into his pillow. Suddenly, he sat up with a start, his green eyes wide with shock.  "Shit! I'm gay. . . "
Things had been different lately. Voldemort had barely crossed his mind, and although he was aware that nothing had changed, that the Dark Wizard was ever on the move, it somehow felt more distant. . . less dangerous.
Cradling his head against his chest,  Harry folded his legs and pulled Malfoy's body onto his lap. "Draco, I need you to listen to me, okay? You're going to live. You and me both. We're going to live, long, happy lives. . . together. When all of this is over, it'll just be me an' you, forever, okay? We'll get a cottage, or whatever you like, and we'll drink tea and eat crumpets, and have friends over. I'll be an Auror, you'll work with the Ministry, and you can come home and complain about how frightfully boring everyone is, and I'll listen." Harry swallowed hard, waiting for Draco to make a sound. He didn't. Harry continued, "We'll go to stupid work parties and get old and ugly together, okay? You're not going to die yet. I promise. I won't let you."
Draco had nearly made it. He'd almost slipped unnoticed into one of the back compartments when he was interposed by the sound of a Weasley's all-too-familiar voice.
Harry's smile broadened, and he looked down at the floor for a second. "Hey, so, uh, what class d'you have next?"
For a good long minute, they just sat there, Ron giving him a pat or two every so often, and a little squeeze. He stared at the wall over Harry's shoulder and waited, ignoring the fact that it was nearly 10, and soon Neville and Seamus would be heading to bed. God forbid they saw Harry like this! Oh, the ridicule. Those two had been acting distant lately, and Seamus, the more closed-minded of the two, had been making cruel and snippy remarks under his breath lately. He would have a right good laugh at Harry if he saw him like this. Ron knew that Harry had heard all the things that Seamus said, and it made him feel sick to his stomach. Funny how roles had been reversed. Draco was kind-hearted and caring, and Seamus had become sick, twisted, and cruel, leering at Harry every chance he got.
"No, just go on. I think I misplaced my wand." Draco lied, glancing across the room again towards Potter, who was now completely and utterly alone at his table.
Harry's stomach lurched, and he felt his heart begin to beat rapidly inside his chest. He couldn't run now.
"Harry, what the bloody hell is wrong with you?" Ron demanded, immediately joining Harry at his side as they climbed the stone steps. "Why the hell are you worried about Malfoy? I mean, of all people!"
Run huffed and pushed the ball towards Harry, crossing his arms over his chest. "Alright," he grumbled. "Your turn."
"I do," Ron mumbled under his breath. Hermione jabbed him purposefully with her elbow, and he grunted unappreciatively in response.
"Oh, dear," Hermione whispered to Harry over her cauldron, as Draco hastily made his way to his seat. "He looks even worse than usual. I do hope he's been following up with Madame Pomfrey."
"I don't know," Harry lied, shrugging off his friend's belligerent question. "Pity, I guess. I mean, you have looked at him, haven't you? He looks . . . horrible."
Harry felt a sharp pang in his chest, and tears pricked his eyes. He folded his arms on the table and buried his face in them.
Ron opened his mouth to speak but quickly clamped it shut, hurt mingled with confusion and frustration contorting his face. He wordlessly returned to his unfinished plate.
"Draco," Harry said softly, his voice barely audible above the sound of the rain and the shouting. "Are you okay?"
Harry's ears were burning again. "No, okay?! We haven't exactly had that discussion yet. The whole 'love' thing just sort of slipped out."
At dinner, when Draco let go of Harry's hand and began to walk to his table, he felt his heart sink in his chest and ache longingly. He couldn't be away from him - even for a moment.
Narcissa glanced timidly over at her spouse, his lank figure silhouetted against the orange glow emanating from the fireplace. Tears stung her eyes, and her heart swelled with sympathy for her young son. Draco was still so naive. He was still a boy, yet his father had always retained such high expectations for him, assuming that he might become everything he anticipated him to be. Unfortunately for him, Draco was nothing like his father, although he loved him dearly and aspired to be like him. It just wasn't possible. Draco had always been different from him, although he would never admit it. He was born with a conscience and a respect for life, although his tongue had been sharpened over the years. His young mind had been polluted with terrible notions and opinionated ideas, believing the lie that purebloods were better than other half-blood wizarding families. In reality, they were all the same, united by magic.
"True love lasts forever, " Professor Snape continued,  "it's a disease that feeds off of you until there is nothing left."
"Wait, what?" she laughed, crossing her arms in disbelief. "But that's never been done before. Are you sure, Harry?"
Draco nodded and gagged, suddenly throwing his hand over his mouth as the urge to vomit gripped him. Throwing Harry's hands off of him, he stumbled out of his chair and raced out of the classroom before anyone could stop him. He raced to the loo as quickly as he could, dry-heaving into his hand. Finally, he burst into the boys' lavatory and collapsed in front of the toilet, gripping the cold porcelain on either side of the bowl as he heaved, his stomach clenching over and over, his muscles straining.
"Draco, you were very brave," Dumbledore reassured him as he left his desk and approached his students, the hem of his robes trailing on the floor behind him. "Very brave indeed. But you must be careful. Even inside Hogwarts, you are in grave danger. Both of you."
"Hardly!" Draco licked his lips and finally tasted. He wrinkled his nose and pushed his plate as far away from him as possible. "I think that's what they feed the prisoners in Azkaban," he said thickly.
Harry gasped, his lungs deflating from the impact as Draco aggressively shoved him up against the corridor wall and filled the gap between them; Harry's palms pressed flat against the wall as the older boy kissed him roughly.
Draco swallowed hard. "I hate leaving you." he scoffed at how pathetic and whiny he sounded. Ashamed, he turned his back on Harry and retreated miserably to his table, eyes fixed on his black sneakers.  He hated himself. . .
Frowning slightly as he wondered what punishment Snape was silently planning for him, he unfolded Draco's response.
"There you are, you idiot," he breathed, as he gingerly reached out to comb back Draco's wildly strewn blonde hair. It was matted and laying in tangled heaps over the Slytherin's feverish brow, and Harry frowned in concern.
As the carriage jerked suddenly into motion and began to roll down the path towards the castle, the young wizards hushed, no one daring to utter even a single word. Not even Harry seemed to feel up to the challenge as he sat stiffly beside Cho, his expression taut with discomfort.
He must have had another nightmare. Lately, he'd had trouble remembering them at first, but they would come to him gradually in bits and pieces throughout the day. Draco clambered out of bed and threw on his robes.
For a moment,  Ron just stared back at him warily,  his tongue in his cheek as he mulled it over.  He couldn't say no.  They'd been best friends since the first year,  and neither of them was willing to lose each other.
Hermione's agitated voice broke Harry's concentration,  and he jumped a little,  looking at her questioningly over another spoonful of the pie.
Draco felt a small smile spread to his lips, and he gave Harry an affectionate glance and a kiss on the forehead, throwing an arm around his shoulders and pulling him into his side. The Slytherin's hand dangled off of Harry's shoulder, and he reached up to grab it. He beamed up at Dumbledore with a dimpled grin.
Draco sucked in a breath as his heart skipped a beat in his chest,  thoughts of Harry filling his brain.
"Malfoy," he gasped, quickly running down the slippery steps. He shoved an open-mouthed Seamus Finnigan out of his way and then crouched in the mud at Draco's side, his eyebrows furrowed.
"I know. I know, but it will be okay." He gripped the ruff of Draco's robes and drew him closer, giving him a comforting kiss before sliding his hands down Draco's arms and letting him go. "Let's hurry."
Draco grinned and shook his head at himself. "Blimey, I should have been more careful. Out of everyone, you were the last person I wanted to catch on, besides Harry, of course."
Lucius puffed out his chest pompously; his lips curled with malice. "I'm your father. I can do whatever I please," he said. "You are leaving Hogwarts. For good. We are going home, and
"Damn it, Harry!" He swore. He glared at the embarrassed Gryffindor with his icy eyes and huffed. "You're an impossible, git."
The swirling colors, which had been a sunny shade of yellow faded and darkened into a shadowy ashen grey, and Harry felt a shiver run down his spine. The knot in his stomach clenched. As the fog cleared, Harry could see himself clearly.
"It's alright," Draco drawled, yawning. "I deserved it. Although one more, and ya could have killed me. I was a bit delicate."
the Gryffindor tie. But if it meant spending more time with Harry, he could make amends with it. Raking his eyes over his body in the mirror, Draco adjusted his sleeves and loosened his button-down collar before finally meeting his own gaze. The knot in his stomach clenched, and he frowned dismally at his reflection.
Still, seeing the two boys together, he couldn't help but smile. He had never seen Harry so happy in all the years that they had spent together, and Harry's girlish behavior made it all the more golden. Sometimes, he and Hermione shared a private laugh over it, but they had nothing but warm feelings of friendship for Malfoy in the end, despite all of the bad blood between them.
"I mean, I don't see it. I can't pinpoint when it happens, but I think it happens sometime soon. I'm scared, Ron. What am I supposed to do? I can't stop it if I don't know anything. I need to stop it! I can't go through that. I can't live without him. How could I? I just love him so much. He means everything to me. If he dies, I'll . . . I'll . . . ," he cut himself off, biting his lip, his thick eyebrows furrowing in distress. His voice broke, and he finally looked up at Ron again, his expression perfectly mirroring the brokenness he felt inside. "If he dies," he cried, his voice ever so small. "I'll die."
Narcissa's dusky eyes skipped over her son's familiar scrawl, and her expression became softer, unlike her husband's. Lucius rose from his leather-bound chair and leaned against the stone mantle, massaging his temple as if to soothe a migraine.
"Don't be nasty," Zabini joined in, his deep voice sounding threatening. "She treated you very well. You should remember that next time you go off spouting about 'er."
The Divination classroom was wonderfully cool, a drastic but very welcome change for Harry after being cooped up in Snape's stuffy dungeon classroom for over an hour with 30 steaming cauldrons bubbling away in the oppressive heat. Here, the windows were open, the long, velvety curtains fluttering softly in the gentle breeze as the rain fell silently from the pale, grey sky.
Draco's face looked ghostly white against his pillow, and the outline of his frame beneath the sheets seemed so thin Harry wondered whether he actually had any limbs left at all.
Maybe he had just imagined it. . .  Oh,  who was he trying to kid?  No one can imagine feelings as distinct as that.   But then again,  there was no way he could be interested in Malfoy,  was there?   Harry shriveled in his chair and chewed unconsciously at his nails as he stared expressionlessly into the orange flames.
"Lucius, Lucius, you ignorant fool, how can you be so blind? I will not allow one of my students to have their education taken away from them all in the name of family honor. As soon as the Daily Prophet hears that Lucius Malfoy has pulled his son out of Hogwarts, there will be turmoil. Rumors will spread. People will talk. Your reputation and character are at stake no matter what you do. Taking the boy out of school will only draw attention to your family. Is that what you want? I very much doubt that it is."
"You watch yourself," Lucius Malfoy hissed, his voice barely above a whisper, his cold gray eyes staring directly into Draco's soul. The Death Eater proceeded darkly, "Associating with the Dark Lord's one true enemy? Turning your back on your family?" The older man's thin, white lips stretched into a wicked smile. "You may have just sealed your fate, my son."
"You're going to be okay, Draco," he whispered, though his anxiety was plain in his voice. "Everything's going to be alright."
It was the Dark Mark. Ron had tried to mention it to him several times, but Draco would feign ignorance, marking it up as a lingering side-effect of his injury from the Quidditch match that one night, and then walking away or changing the subject.
?" Draco hissed. "If you mean my arm, of course, it is. I practically shattered it. It'll be smarting for weeks."
"No," Draco felt like his cheeks were splitting. He was smiling like a love-struck fool. Could he possibly be any more obvious? What in Salazar's name was wrong with him? He was a down-right git.
"You're right, " he muttered guiltily,  looking from Hermione to Ron,  "I haven't been good to you.  I'm sorry. "
Another peal of thunder tore through the sky, and Draco felt every muscle in his body contract, his face contorting with pain.
Ron spoke up, and this time he sounded frustrated. "C'mon, let's just go, Harry! The train is going to take off again in a few minutes, and I, for one, didn't intend on heading back to London."
Draco looked up at his mother and lied solemnly to her face, "I'm fine, mother. Just fine." The lie was bitter on his tongue.
The two boys sat in silence for a few minutes. Ron stared out the window at the moon as it rose over the trees' dark, skeletal figures. Draco simply focused on Harry, listening to the sound of his steady breathing in the quiet room, watching his eyelids flutter, and his eyebrows twitch. He smoothed Harry's hair and hummed softly to himself, startling Ron from his reverie.
"It's Hermione,"  Hermione replied with a smile. She caught Harry's eye and nodded towards him. Harry blushed and nodded back.
Draco snorted. "Well, it's not like she can turn her nose up at whoever she pleases! She was never very fond of me, that's for sure. If she had it her way, she probably would've let me die."
The portrait of his father that hung above the mantle scowled down at him, slowly sipping a glass of velvety red wine and tapping his long bony fingers against the crystal glass painted in his hand. He looked as if he might speak, but he reserved his sharp words of displeasure. All Lucius could do was grumble and fuss, his pale face growing increasingly red with every passing minute. How could his son's lacking school-boy bewitcheries and protection spells be so efficient?
Harry chuckled. He loved the doodles. Draco was definitely much more infantile than he had thought. Harry could tell from the loopy, nearly lop-sided scribbling that Draco was on the verge of falling asleep. Harry would let him.
"Harry?" Hermione jogged his shoulder roughly.  "Harry,  you have to listen!  I'm trying to help you, so will you please pay me some attention and stop stuffing your face like a Thanksgiving turkey?!"
again? He frowned as his stomach tied itself into knots, a cold, hard lump of dread making his insides curdle. He knew what he would see:
His eyes were swollen and puffy, and his cheeks were dry and chafed as if he'd been crying in his sleep. Had he? He swallowed, and his gaze unwillingly shifted to his injured arm. Slowly, he slipped it out of his sling and lifted the silk-lined sleeve of his robe, his jaw clenching.
The chair Professor Snape had instructed Draco to take extremely uncomfortable, and he shifted uneasily, breathing shakily through his parted lips. Snape sat at his desk facing his student, hands folded in front of him, his oily face filled with self-satisfaction. Draco felt sick with dread. He had a nagging feeling that he knew what he'd been called here for.
"You're too forgiving," Ron mopped the sweat from his brow, shook his head incredulously, and then glared across the room at the blonde Slytherin.
After receiving several derogatory comments from Snape on his potion, after class was finally dismissed, Harry shouldered his book-bag and told Ron and Hermione to go on ahead. They were confused, but they did, so Harry approached the table where Draco was hastily packing up his things.
"Madam Pomfrey!" He shouted loudly, his voice cracking. "Madame Pomfrey?!" His voice boomed in the cavernous room, but no one came.
Ron was curious. "When did. . . when was . . ." he stammered awkwardly. "Um, when did you start feeling things?"
Harry's nose lightly brushed against his, and Draco softly stroked his cheek and then slid his hands into Harry's wind-blown raven black hair. It was coarse and curly but soft all at once. It was exactly how he had imagined it would feel.
The words sounded strange and foreign even to himself, like little white lies. He couldn't believe them no matter how hard he tried. Nothing was going to be alright. Harry had always been Voldemort's sole focus, but now, Draco had thrown himself into the line of fire, and things would soon get much worse. The boy had already been through so much, how could Harry ask anything more of him?
It hurt to walk. He could feel the dwindling muscles in his calves and lower thighs burning as he walked. It took all of his strength just to put one foot in front of the other. He would have to remember to start using his walking stick, he thought, grimacing in pain. Still, following Harry's retreating figure, he limped through the Great Hall. He didn't know what he was expecting, but at the moment, it felt like something was pulling him toward Harry - he
He was older, maybe in his late twenties. He recognized his surroundings. He was in his godfather's gloomy old house, sitting on the sagging sofa, his head resting dejectedly in his hands as he emitted low, guttural sobs that wrecked his body. Harry could almost feel the pain. He realized that what he was seeing was what he had been the most afraid of.
"I think I might be. . . y'know . . . going through something similar," Ron admitted, with a slight cringe.
Ron didn't look convinced, but before he could say anything else (Thank God), Professor Trelawney had finally taken her place in front of the classroom.
"Bloody hell," Ron scoffed, setting the jar aside to glare openly at Malfoy. "C'mon, we both know what I'm talking about!"
Hermione piped up quietly, her voice quivering a little. "I don't think this is a good idea, Ronald. I really don't LIKE THIS-" And she broke her sentence off with a scream as they took off and streaked across the sky towards the castle.
Harry felt a wave of guilt wash over him. Lately, his friendship with Ron had been delicate. If he told him the truth about his relationship with Malfoy, things between them could become even more unstable. On the other hand, he knew that the longer he delayed, the higher the likelihood of the truth completely destroying their friendship. He didn't know what to do.
Draco boards the Hogwarts Express and tries to avoid Harry and his friends, but fails, ending in confrontation.
Draco's eyes followed Harry as the boy turned to leave the room, meeting his gaze one last time before he finally disappeared out the door. Draco exhaled a shaky breath and clutched his robes tightly in his fists, waiting for Snape to break the silence only shattered by the sound of Harry's retreating footsteps.
Hermione glowered at him and turned back to Harry. "Let's go in. If he complains one more time, I swear I'm going to lose my - Harry?"
"Is there somewhere you need to be?" Professor Snape asked coldly, staring the young Slytherin down. "Am I imposing?"
When his eyes fluttered open, his heart leaped in his chest. Draco's forehead was pressed coolly against his, the boy's beautiful eyes locked intently on Harry's face.
Blaise narrowed his eyes at Draco from across the table, "Oh, look, Malfoy's talking to himself now!"
"He's been like this ever since Divination," Ron filled him in quietly, uncertain as to what details he was able to share. "You'll just have to . . . ask him yourself. And please, bloody take him! I'm not used to seeing him like this. Have no idea what I'm 'sposed to be doing."
Draco's blue, sunken eyes slowly and fluttered open, and he spoke. His voice sounded weak and husky, but it was the most beautiful thing Harry had ever heard. "Potter,"
The next morning, before Draco even opened his eyes, he knew he wasn't in the Slytherin dorms. It smelled differently here, like fresh rolls of parchment and ink. The foul stench of murky lake water no longer assaulted his nostrils, and he took a deep breath in as his eyelids languidly fluttered open.
Anxious, Harry inched closer, keeping one eye on Malfoy while he delicately reached for the Slytherin's pale hand. Taking it gently in his, he felt with the other for a pulse.
"What you see today is not absolute, and can change very quickly, which is why I am gifting each of you with your own crystals. You will return them to me at the end of the semester. Depending on your choices in the upcoming months, you could very well change your fate, so think wisely before you act."
Draco jumped back almost as if he had been stupefied, the sudden urge to vomit hitting him. He stiffened instinctively and clenched his hands at his sides as he looked up at Professor Snape, his eyes stinging. He was a fucking idiot. How could he have lowered his guard like that? It was Harry's fucking eyes. That's what it was.
"Alright," Harry nodded and awkwardly pushed up his glasses. "Lead the way, your Majesty." he nudged Draco forward with a grin.
Draco's smile faded noticeably, and a look of disdain and disappointment settled on his pointed features. "Damn it!" he cursed. "You're probably right."
Harry was beet red. He glanced anxiously at Ron and then at Hermione, who was attempting to stifle a laugh.
. "Just don't do it again," Harry chuckled nervously. He frowned and extracted himself from Draco's arms. "What happened anyway?"
As if prompted by Harry's own thoughts, the door squeaked open, and a handsome boy with white-blonde hair slowly walked in, his leather school bag tucked securely under his arm. Harry's eyes followed him longingly as the Slytherin took his seat, whispered a half-hearted greeting to Pansy, and listened attentively as she repeated the class assignment to him. He looked different today - strangely well-rested. The swelling of his eyes seemed to have gone down a little . . . Harry stared. He wasn't thinking. He was just looking. It was innocent, right?
"Should I send it, Bubo?" Draco asked, glancing shortly at his owl, "I'm not confident that my protection spells are going to conceal my identity effectively. Knowing Potter and his retarded friends, they'll probably find some criminal way to break through them."
Harry silently waited for an answer and was thrilled when he felt something fall into his lap. It was a paper bird. He beamed as he unfolded it.
Ron sighed hugely and shut his eyes as if he were making a birthday wish. "Oh,  alright.  Fine,  but you have to start paying less attention to  ferret.  Okay? "
Harry watched helplessly as Draco seized in his arms, the Slytherin making strange gasping sounds as he struggled to breathe. He
"But yes, it's Granger." Ron groaned and tiredly rubbed his eyes. "Bloody hell, why am I telling you this?"
"What the hell?" Ron spat, bits of chicken flying from his mouth and onto the table. Hermione glared at him in disgust. "What does that mean? It seriously has never happened before?"
Ron untangled himself from Harry's tight grasp and shuffled eagerly back to his bed. Draco just stood there awkwardly, a pained expression on his face.
Dumbledore suddenly smiled, the corners of his periwinkle blue eyes crinkling. "That's up to you, Harry."
The hairs on Draco's neck stood up on end, and his skin tingled. Draco had noticed his empty seat at the Gryffindor table and had mentally thanked the stars for his absence. He'd been hoping to delay a public encounter, but as luck would have it, Harry would purposefully instigate one. Who wouldn't enjoy seeing their enemy squirm with humiliation? Harry Potter certainly wouldn't miss out on that opportunity.
Ron snorted at him and shook his head. "Switching partners isn't going to help, Malfoy. Blimey, what you
"No, no, it's fine. I'm just. . . not used to talking about it." Draco swallowed hard and forced himself to look Ron in the eye. He had hated the Weasley boy for so long, and yet here he was, having a casual heart-to-heart with him. Who would have thought? Draco licked his lips and sighed. "I wasn't really studying for Charms before. I skipped dinner to see Snape. I told him about the mark, and he gave me a sort of potion I'm going to have to take, but it will help with the pain, so thank Salazar for that, I guess. It will never fully go away, but it's something."
Draco cleared his throat again and gestured wildly for a moment, struggling to find words, his heart still racing in his chest. "Oh, um, uh," he squeezed his eyes shut and snapped his fingers, concentrating. "Ah, yes! The Pepperup Potion! The bloody Pepperup! Been takin' two spoonfuls every day. Bloody disgusting it is, but it sure as hell does the trick."
Harry chanced one last glance back at Draco slumbering on the bathroom floor before following Ron out into the twisting corridors dimly lit by flickering torches. He kept thinking that he should go back and retrieve his robes, but the more he thought about it, strangely enough, the less he cared. He grinned to himself when he imagined just how confused the chap would be when he finally came to.
Draco stuffed his cauldron into his leather bag and ran his hands through his matted hair. "Oh, well, I'm fine, I guess. Never better."
Harry gulped as he glanced restlessly down the aisle, suspecting to see Percy Weasley or a Professor stamping towards them. But there was no one. He felt resentment, guilt, and uncertainty like a stone in his gut. He should've stayed Ron's hand, but he hadn't.
Draco Malfoy gazed down at his ridiculous love letter with impassioned, tear-filled eyes, his fingers still tightly folded around his quill. His Eagle Owl was perched on the ornate desk beside him; head cocked as it waited quietly for Draco to make up his mind once and for all.
As Draco's lips moved against his, he swore to himself that if this was what love felt like, he would be willing to risk everything to protect it. He would suffer the Cruciatis curse a hundred times if it meant he could relive this moment and relish it forever.
"Harry, what're you doing?" Ron asked shiftily. "Why is Malfoy sleeping on the floor like a vagrant?" He narrowed his eyes. "And why were you-"
"I never thought I'd say this, but I think that crack-pot old fool is growing on me," Draco responded, dissolving into gleeful laughter.
Somehow, Draco still looked beautiful. Harry thought. He wiped his eyes on the sleeve of his robe and then leaned in. He pinched his eyes shut, teardrops falling like rain as Harry tenderly kissed Draco's lips. It hurt. It hurt. They were cold and dead and lifeless, and it hurt. This was not how he had imagined it. He would never have imagined this.
"It'll be okay. I promise." Harry continued. "You won't be expelled, alright? Dumbledore wouldn't let that happen."
Draco carried on. "I mean, look at that. If I didn't have an appetite before, I most certainly do not have one now." he sneered in disgust.
"One moment, guys," Harry waved them on and then wove his way through the students to the Headmaster. "Yes, Professor. . . ? How's Draco?" he asked immediately, hoping for good news.
"I'm tired. I think I'm going to pop into the infirmary and then head off to bed. Goodnight, Hermione."
And they shot skyward, zooming over the Quidditch pitch and into the sky. Draco tightened his grip and rested his head on Harry's shoulder, feeling the cold Autumn air stinging his cheeks and rushing through his now disheveled hair. He couldn't help but smile. He felt light, and happy, and free, like a bird.
"We were getting fitted for robes, first year, at Madame Malkins," Draco laughed. "He walked in, and I don't think I'd ever been more confused in my life. He looked more confused than me, though. Had no idea what he was doing. It was bloody adorable."
Draco's face paled, even more, looking directly into Harry's bewitching, forest-green eyes. "About what?" he whispered.
"Had enough staring at my sickly mug yet, or are you enjoying the view?" Draco snapped, fists clenched at his sides.
It felt real; ultimately, that was what mattered the most. Draco felt happy. He felt perfectly content for the first time in years. He finally had what he had been desperately longing for, and now that he did, all of his previous concerns were melting away like the snow in early spring.
Draco took the last bag and hoisted it over his shoulder before looking up at his father with a wounded expression. "Sorry, father," he whispered, as he submissively raked his fingers through his disheveled silvery blonde hair.
Draco started, lifting his head up from the table with a loud gasp as he filled his lungs with air, his body shaking. His distorted vision cleared, and he looked around in shock, taking in his surroundings.
There was a brief awkward silence in which Draco licked his lips nervously and shifted his book-bag on his shoulder, glancing longingly at the door while looking a bit pale.
"Malfoy, I did it!" He laughed happily, waving the snitch over his head and showing it to Draco proudly. "I almost forgot what it felt like."
"Ah, Draco," Lucius' voice echoed in the empty room, "I meant to ask. Was that your owl I saw flying when I came home?"
Ron watched Draco warily, his eyes wandering to the Slytherin's trembling fingers. Malfoy opened the lid with a loud
If Fred's smile were any wider, Draco swore that his face might have split in two. "Just one quick question before we go."
"Hey, it's okay. It was. . . it was just a dream." He said softly, though he sounded unsure of his own voice.
Draco heaved again, his muscles spasming. He choked, barely able to catch his breath as he clutched at the sink with his cold, clammy hands and prayed for the dry-heaving to end. Nothing was coming up. His stomach was empty. He hadn't eaten since the day before when he'd been force-fed in the hospital wing, and yet he still wasn't hungry. The thought of food made him sick to the stomach.
He was so gorgeous. . . Draco thought wistfully, his heart filling with longing. Harry looked up at him again, and in an instant, their eyes met. This time, Harry didn't glance away, and the air felt as if it came alive between them. Draco held his breath and refused to blink, afraid that when he did, this perfect moment would suddenly end. Harry's gaze was unwavering but soft, non-invasive and gentle, and yet also somehow suddenly shy. His rosy lips were slightly parted, his cheeks were flushed ever so lightly, and his eyes shone like priceless stones in the dimly lit dungeon classroom.
There was a knot in Harry's chest, and it just kept getting tighter. "Shut it, Ron! I don't want to wake him up. Let's get to Potions, okay?"
Harry was speechless. He watched Dumbledore disappear down the corridor and then leaned against the stone wall, pressing his forehead against the cold, frost-coated window pane.
"Erm, it's breakfast time," Ron said, clearing his throat. "We're about to head down if you want to come along."
"Potter," he said cheerfully, and he grimaced. It sounded strange rolling off of his tongue without a sneer.
The ear-piercing sound of a door swinging open on rusty hinges broke Harry's concentration, and he anxiously scrambled to his feet, batting the dust off of his Quidditch robes.
Ronald Weasley watched as Draco tucked his arm back into his sling, a troubled expression on his face as their eyes clashed.
He didn't dare finish his hushed promulgation. He was clinging firmly to denial. His own son, a filthy homophile? He couldn't wrap his head around it. The idea was repulsive and a wicked smear upon the prestigious name of the Malfoy family. His appalled expression abruptly flooded with indignation, and he angrily grabbed his wand from the tea-table beside him and flicked it above the paper. It wouldn't open, and he became more frustrated with every flick of his wand.
Draco nodded dismissively, and the house-elf disapparated, neglecting the boy standing alone in his dark, gloomy bedroom. He looked out the window once more, but his old owl was long gone, and he could only hope that the frail creature made it to Potter before the school year began.
The sheets were coarse against Draco's sensitive skin as he stirred, his ice-blue eyes fluttering open. He squinted into the dazzling morning light, momentarily blinded by the sun as it streamed in through the towering windows of the infirmary. He couldn't help but wonder where he was. What had happened? Wasn't he supposed to be in the Great Hall? He frowned in confusion, searching the vaulted stone ceiling for answers.
"Harry, Draco, what happened? Are you okay?" She babbled, her eyebrows tightly furrowed as she reached out to give Draco a friendly touch on the shoulder. Her dark eyes widened when she saw his arm tucked into the sling.
Positioned stiffly on his stool, elbows on the table, Harry stared blankly at his open Potions book, mind wandering distractedly over the well-worn pages. His eyes flickered across the classroom to Draco's empty seat. The Slytherin was absent again. Harry wondered what his marks were for the class, and he sighed dismally, causing Hermione to glance up at him briefly over her own book.
Snape hummed, staring down at Draco with his dark, beady eyes. "Your father sent me a letter; I will let you know."
Draco tightened his grasp on Harry's hand until his knuckles were white. "No," he said adamantly, an unexpected strength in his voice. "Stay. Please."
The two boys jumped apart, Draco assuming a stiff upright position while Harry tried to shove his hands casually in his pockets.
Draco jerked his arm from her grip and looked up at her with a panicked expression, "You don't understand! I have to go," he yelled, "I have to play this one off, or I'm done for."
Forcing himself to his feet, he stumbled through the crowd, shouldering his way through desperately, feeling like he was drowning in the sea of angrily shouting teenagers.
"Of course!" Draco chuckled. "the two of you just had to tag along, didn't you? Wanted to see me get on my knees and kiss Potter's shiny shoes?"
Harry leaped up and stepped back, trembling as he watched Madame Pomfrey lean over Draco and pull out her wand. It transformed into a sort of stick-like stethoscope, and she placed one end over Draco's chest while she placed the other to her ear.
Lucius looked up with a start. His wife, Narcissa, had come into the study, her long black dress brushing the dark, red carpet as she approached her husband.
"She's such a joke," Draco pierced the egg yolk with the prong of his fork, watching angrily as the yellow puss oozed from the broken skin. "acting all self-righteous! She's not exactly a healthy specimen herself - if you get my meaning."
He wasn't fine. He wasn't fine at all. Tomorrow, he was going back to Hogwarts, and being around Harry was going to be just that much more painful.
Draco swallowed hard, trying to put his anxiety into words. "When. . . you said you loved me in the infirmary." he fidgeted with the flap of Harry's coat pocket nervously. "It's just, you know, I've been thinking about it, and I don't know. It feels weird to say it now."
Hermione laughed at his enthusiasm and then looked down at the yellowed paper, Ron peering over her shoulder with a cynical look on his freckled face. Hermione simply smiled and stammered.
Draco closed his eyes and clutched Harry's robes to his chest, hoping they would make him feel less alone. Somehow, they were comforting. Lying down, still crying softly, loathing himself, he stared at the wall.
Draco's lips twitched, but the ferocious sneer remained, his eyebrows furrowed deeply. He looked like a rabid dog. "I'm not leaving. I'm not moving a fucking muscle. I'm staying here, with Potter, and
"Thank you," he whispered through his chapped lips. He took another sip, his smile broadening despite his vertigo and his nausea.
Draco awoke with a start, his grey eyes snapping open as he gazed blankly into the enclosing darkness.
Harry nodded and hoisted himself out of the sunken armchair before padding back to his dorm.  Silently,  he laid in bed and stared wide awake at the ceiling,  his thoughts still wandering back to Draco.
Students hurried past him without so much as a glance, ignoring him and just chatting excitedly as they walked on by, a blur of familiar faces. Neville Longbottom. Seamus Finnigan. Blaise Zabini. Pansy Parkinson.
They were dry and rough and chapped from the wind, but they were Harry's, and Draco felt as if his heart were soaring above the clouds. This was the first time he'd kissed Harry since that night in the infirmary, and it was everything he'd ever wanted. If he could imagine what perfect was like, this was it. This was most definitely it.
The shrill ringing of the bell broke the tension, and suddenly, it was over. Draco jerked upwards as if he had awoken from a drunken slumber. He swallowed hard and cleared his throat to compose himself as he assembled his things, slamming his book shut and shoving it nervously into his shiny, black leather shoulder bag.
"I love you," Draco breathed hoarsely. "I love you more than anything. I always have. Since I met you."
The bigger boy jumped energetically out of the carriage. "Shove off, Malfoy, or I'll hex you this time." He spat back.
"We'll keep an eye on him, okay?" Ron offered weakly. "We'll keep an eye on 'im and never let him out of our sight. If your busy, I'll stand by him, okay? Keep the bloke outta trouble, so to speak.
Draco snorted and abruptly turned his back on the red-head and his friends. He'd had enough excitement for one night. He wasn't even sure if he could make it through the Sorting Ceremony and Dumbledore's speech. He wasn't hungry, so he was planning on slipping out of the Great Hall during the feast to rest. Merlin only knew he needed it.
"Very good then, " and Snape, his black robes flowing dramatically behind him, led Draco out of the Great Hall.
"Dumbledore moved Draco, so he's out of Slytherin, and he's going to be here now, with me . . . us." Harry gushed, his cheeks flushed as he stared at his friends nervously, hoping that they would be just as thrilled as he was.
"He carried you all the way here, and he waited with you," Madam Pomphrey went on enthusiastically. "It was quite unlike him if I do say so myself! I-"
Sitting out in the corridor, outside the infirmary, Harry fidgeted with his wand and stared blankly at the lamp-lit wall. He watched with tired, listless eyes, hypnotized as the shadows danced, the flame in the firepot crackling softly as it flickered in the dark like a bright, burning beacon of hope.
Harry stormed off, Fred and George following close behind, bellowing the muggle song as loudly as they could. Hermione turned to look at Ron, who was drinking his pumpkin juice and staring blankly into space.
No. Harry couldn't even bring himself to finish the last question, and yet, he still couldn't quiet the tremulous little voices in his head. He was afraid. Maybe he shouldn't look. Perhaps he should ask to go to the loo.
He started scaling the steps when a sudden jolt of pain in his head made him freeze abruptly, a gasp escaping his pale lips. He grabbed the wet stone railing for support, his fingers turning white as he ground his teeth through the pain.
"Not now, Ron!" Harry avoided the Great Hall, turning towards the winding corridor to find the hospital wing. "Get Madame Pomphrey!" He called over his shoulder. "Now! I think he's dying!"
Harry's fingers tickled the back of his hand as it bumped against him and then delicately wove their fingers together in the folds of his robe. He tried to swallow the happy lump in his throat, but he couldn't. He gave Harry a sideways glance, beaming. Harry was smiling the goofiest smile, and that made Draco laugh out loud.
Draco could hear his heart racing in his ears, panic making his blood boil and his stomach curdle. He wanted to scream again, and he felt a distinctive lump rising in his throat, making it difficult to swallow and difficult to speak. His eyes were burning, and he could feel a warm liquid begin to flood them, blurring his vision.
Was he dreaming? Perhaps he'd drifted off on the desk and was currently drooling on his Potions book like a bloody fool in front of the whole class, and more importantly, in front of Harry.
For the past week, he'd been dividing his time between Ron and Hermione and Draco. He was with Hermione and Ron from morning to evening, but he was usually off to the infirmary after dinner in the Great Hall. Harry would even collect Draco's homework from his Professors and then bring it to him at the end of the day. On top of that, he would take as much time as he could before curfew to assist him with it. Most of their time together was spent giggling and ogling at each other. They hardly got anything done, but somehow neither of them cared. Harry felt as if he didn't have a single care in the world. He had never felt so free before, not even on his broom.
His presence was intoxicating. His touch felt enchanting, almost electric. Draco fought the urge to vomit at the sensation; his stomach caught up in knots at Harry's proximity.
Draco jumped slightly at the sound of his name, lifting his head with a start as he looked up in confusion. He shook the thoughts from his head with a toss of his silvery blonde hair. "Sorry, what was that?" he muttered with an apologetic smile.
He turned to walk away, but Harry grabbed his arm. Draco quickly yanked his arm from his grasp as if he had been stung, and Harry looked up at him in wounded confusion.
Suddenly, another jolt of pain made his skull feel as if it were cleft in two. He gasped in pain and bent over the railing, his stomach-churning. He felt cold, hollow, and weak, and he felt his brain slowly splitting. What the hell was wrong with him? Was it the stress? Was it his body's lack of nutrition?
"Oh, water, water! Yes, water." Harry stammered instantly. He pulled out his wand and aimed it towards the pitcher sitting on the bedside table. "Accio!"
"I do hope that you are not relaying any valuable information to your classmates," his father's voice was cold, almost threatening.
Professor Snape stood behind his desk, and Draco watched him with fear as he leaned over the desk towards him, face hard like stone.
"Madam Pomfrey!" He screamed. Somehow, his voice seemed far away and distant, as if it were someone else's.
"Fuck me, fuck me," Draco repeatedly muttered to himself. "Damn it!" He found himself in front of the Slytherin common room, and he rushed in, making a beeline for the dormitories.
A soft whisper just barely reached Draco's ear, and he immediately felt his lungs inflate with air. He gasped, reeling over the sink clutching at his throat. What was that? Was that a spell he'd just heard?!
Butterflies filled Harry's stomach, wings fluttering, making him feel sick in a strange yet wonderful way. Malfoy's lips were soft and warm and tasted distinctly of treacle tart pudding. He could felt his body melting, his heart pounding, skipping beats as it thrummed loudly in his ears. He wanted to capture the moment, live in it, savor it.
He grabbed his wand from off the desk, mumbled another protection spell for extra measure, and then he tensely tucked the envelope into Bubo's snapping beak.
"I don't envy you, Harry," Ron stated as he sat down and began to pile his plate with food. He took a bite of sausage and laughed. "Mr. Flitwick alone gave us enough work to keep us busy 'til Christmas, so you should have a jolly old time."
Draco. Harry raised his eyes to scrutinize Draco's wan, pale face again, but when he turned to look, the boy was gone.
Hermione shook her head, curls flouncing, but she couldn't hide her amused smile. "No, Harry. The rules are quite clear. It says he has to sleep separately, Harry."
It was quiet in the dorm. Classes were still in session, and it was empty. It was peaceful. The green light filtering in through the dungeon windows was oddly comforting. Draco made his way to his bed and sat down on it, dropping his bag dismissively on the floor. He buried his face in his hands, and he had just barely opened his eyes when he caught a glimpse of the dark fold of Harry's robes peeking out from his bag. A tear cascaded down his cheek as he leaned forward and snagged it up, slowly pulling it out into his lap. He looked down at it dismally, feeling his eyes well up again as he remembered Harry being so close, just inches away from him. He could have kissed him. He squeezed his eyes shut and cursed at himself. Not only that, but Harry had said that he was worried about him. Just the thought that the raven-haired boy ever gave him so much as a thought made his heartache longingly. Why did he even care? Harry hates him. He always had, from the moment they met. Was he pretending? But why would he? What would he gain from it? Draco snorted. Nothing. So he wasn't pretending. Back to the first question, then.
Draco and Harry dissolved into giggles as the foursome loped up the moving staircase together, surrounded by their excitedly prattling classmates.
Harry struggled out of his Quidditch robes, doing the only thing he could think of. He wrapped it around Draco's violently shaking body and pulled him close, holding him tightly to his chest.
"Alright then, come 'ere you git," he groaned, pulling Harry into a hug. "Just let it out . . . I guess. That's right."
Harry continued sobbing, and Ron decided he wouldn't try to stop him. Maybe letting him carry on was what he needed right now. He wished Malfoy were here . . . he would do a better job of whatever this was. Somehow, Draco always seemed to know how to handle things like this. Ron sort-of felt like a stand-in. Hesitantly, he inched closer to his friend.
!" Draco finally breathed, letting out a giant gasp of air. "Fuck, fuck, fuck. . ." He'd only just then realized that he had been holding his breath.
Harry froze, his entire body suddenly cold. All the little hairs on his arms and the back of his neck stood up on end, and his heart stopped. "Dementors? But. . . How? I thought Draco was just sick. I mean, he looked better, and then he just. . .  collapsed. . . ."
"Nothing,'" Draco shook his head and turned to look into Harry's eyes as they walked. "You're just. . . gorgeous."
Hermione was growing impatient.  "You'd better hurry it up then because I'm about done trying to help you. Ronald,  too.  You. . . don't even join in on our conversations anymore.  You stare into space like some kind of lunatic."
It was horribly bright. Harry felt blinded the moment he walked into the cavernous room. His eyes burned, and he blinked back tears from the pain as he sat down across from Hermione at the Gryffindor table. The room was nearly empty. Only a few students were scattered at a few tables. Everyone must have been sleeping in.
"He's talking to McGonagall," Hermione surmised, observing the man intently. "Whatever their discussing seems to have aggravated her. She looks worried, doesn't she?"
Taking a deep breath, Draco leaped at the opportunity and shouldered his book-bag, and began to saunter across the aisle towards him slowly, his stomach tangled in knots. He felt wonderfully and horribly sick all at once.
The long-awaited Quidditch match ended shortly after it began, with Harry waving the Golden Snitch over his head in triumph and wearing a dazzling smile on his beaming face. Overflowing with Gryffindors, the stands erupted into cheers, and their screams of "
The Professor's black robes rippled behind him as he slowly circled around the desk and leaned instead against the front of it, staring down at Draco with a menacing glare.
Fighting the urge to look up, Draco smiled down at his book; his pale white cheeks flushed a delicate shade of pink. All of the inky black words were blurred together as he slowly flipped through the pages, blending to form nothing but completely meaningless sentences and phrases. He just smiled. His cheeks began to ache, but he couldn't have cared less. His heartfelt lighter than feathers. He felt like he was soaring through the clouds on his broomstick. Draco wasn't familiar with this feeling. He'd dreamed of this feeling, wondering what it was like, and now that he was experiencing it, it felt like a dizzy dream.
In the back of Draco's mind, he was aware of the brush of fabric over his skin, and he heard a distant voice, but he ignored it.
Honestly, Malfoy was a decent enough bloke underneath it all. His sense of cruelty and satisfaction in the suffering of others was still just as much a part of him as it had been before. But, instead of taking it out on the trio as he had done, he used it to sneer and shout insults at anyone prejudiced enough to comment out loud. The occasional word or two against Harry would spill out of someone's mouth, and no sooner had it rolled off of their tongue than Draco had clocked them squarely in the face or threatened to hex them.
"Good morning, Harry!" Hermione greeted him cheerfully as she looked up from her copy of the Daily Prophet. "Oh, Lord, Harry, did you sleep at all?"
Surprisingly enough, Draco's response lacked malice and seemed rather more timid and fearful than anything. Harry licked his lips. "Nothing. I was just wondering how you were feeling."
"Oh," Goyle squeaked around his strawberry tart, the red jam oozing between his teeth, "Look, look! Says 'ere, the old bohemian wizard-"
Draco grimaced at the sound of his name, and he looked up to see Harry bouncing towards him through the rainy mist, a brilliant smile on his face.
No matter how much Draco puzzled at it, he couldn't fit the pieces together. It didn't make sense. Why hadn't he just let him die?
He felt nothing. Harry's stomach dropped sickeningly. There was no pulse. His skin was ice cold to the touch.
Draco doused his face with the cool water from the leaky faucet, gasping at the shocking sensation as the iciness of it made his cheeks burn. Breathless, he doused himself again, and then he turned the knob and looked up at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. He sighed. He looked hideous! Madame Pomphrey had been right to worry. His marble gray eyes were deeply set and rimmed in an almost velvety purple, while his cheeks were sunken and shallow. He looked almost as ill as the dreaded Hogwarts caretaker, old Mr. Filch. . .
"Nothing," Ron said quickly. He looked back up at Professor Trelawney with a sheepish expression. "Nothing else. That's it."
Voldemort chuckled and glanced once more around the circle before looking back at Draco. "He doesn't seem
Draco heard Harry's hand slip off of the door handle, and he let out a low sigh of relief, shutting his eyes and hoping to hear Harry's voice again.
Draco's smirk transformed into a devilish grin as he turned to look at his ex-arch nemesis with quirked eyebrows. "Well, what d'ya know,"
Draco wanted to defend Harry,  but he bit his tongue and went on. "He's smart, he's witty, he's forgiving and sometimes a little too curious for his own good, but I like that about him. " he paused for a second,  staring blankly at the dungeon floor. "He's . . . gorgeous.  His eyes.. . they're beautiful. " Draco whimpered softly and cradled his head in his hands.  "But now what,  Professor?  Are you going to tell my father? Please don't! "
Draco noticed and smiled in response. "Oh, don't mind this. I only sprained it a bit. It'll heal up right quick,"
Finally, Professor Trelawney instructed them to begin and take turns using the ball on their table. Harry watched Ron curiously, waiting to get some sort of response from his unreadable expression.
Draco wiped his eyes on his sleeve and nodded vigorously, beaming back at Harry. "He said he didn't think it was safe. Says I miffed 'em off when I started loitering about with you and your little friends."
His chest tightened, his breath becoming labored. He forgot about Harry and the joyful celebration happening below him on the pitch. His fingers trembled as he unfastened the buttons at his collar and struggled to breathe, squeezing his eyes shut tight as he fought to drown out the dark, twisted images shooting through his brain faster than he could conjure the ability to think.
he whispered, and immediately the ink began to disappear off of the page, leaving a blank sheet of parchment. Harry smirked and casually dug through his bag for a quill. There was a muted scratching sound as he wrote, but it went unnoticed. His excitement mounted.
Draco's mischievous smirk broadened, "Alright then, guess I'll have a little chat with Dumbledore later."
Draco's eyes twinkled, and he gave Harry a knowing glance. "Well," he said cheerfully. "You tell 'er."
"Who cares," Draco grinned and pulled Harry closer, his heart stuttering as the color in Harry's cheeks deepened even further. Loving the embarrassment in Harry's face, he leaned in to kiss him. Fred and George snickered and began to hum loudly.
"You're running your creepy little hands all over my best mate, so yes, I'd say it is," Ron retorted, narrowing his eyes. "I'm not judging you, Malfoy. I never thought I'd say this to you of all bloody people, but I just want to help, alright'?"
"Harry, I am old. I might not be as strong and youthful as I once was, but I do think myself wiser. I know you have feelings for Draco, and I know he has feelings for you." Dumbledore smiled down at Harry kindly. "I have lived a long time, and although I have never seen an unsuccessful Dementor attack and am completely oblivious as to what it may do to a body, I know from experience, as do you, Harry, that love is the most powerful magic there is. I suggest you use it, Harry." Dumbledore patted Harry on the shoulder and then turned to walk away, his gnarled hands folded behind his back. "Good day, Harry."
"Harry," Draco breathed, weakly reaching out for him, just barely brushing the ends of Harry's robe with his fingertips.
Draco raised his eyebrows at him and smirked. "Oh really? And who is it?" he gasped a little too loudly. "Is it Granger?!"
Harry walked down the east corridor heading to DADA with Hermione and Ron, his eyes red and swollen. Ron and Hermione were chatting excitedly about the upcoming Quidditch game against Hufflepuff, and Harry was trying to seem enthusiastic, but he couldn't.  As they were walking, they spotted Dumbledore standing in front of their classroom.
Hermione finally barked a laugh. "Wait, you say 'I love you,' but you haven't even established your relationship yet?"
Harry readjusted his glasses and looked at the two Weasley twins suspiciously. "Hey," he said warily, "What're you two doing here?"
Harry was curled up on his bed, propped up against his pillows with his covers drawn over his knees. He was gazing intently into his cupped hands where the little crystal ball sat, his face twisting with pain every so often as his eyes glazed over with tears. His lips were pursed and drawn together in a very thin, wavery line as he swallowed the burning urge to cry, a weak little whimper escaping him every now and then as he lost himself in the cloudy scene playing out before him.
Harry met his glare with a grin. "I wouldn't have it any other way," he answered coolly. Draco squeezed his hand tenderly, and Harry felt his chest swell with courage.
The dryness of his mouth,  the unsteady rhythm of his heart,  the fluttering wings in his stomach. . . it wasn't something he was supposed to feel around Malfoy or any other boy.
Harry looked down the field towards her, where she was standing with Ron. He just sighed. "Well, I'm pretty sure she already knows."
Draco Malfoy and Harry were standing in the middle of the Quidditch pitch later that beautiful Saturday afternoon. The sky was big and blue with a few scattered clouds, and the sun was shining down through the stands onto the fading, Autumn grass. It was the perfect day for flying.
The dorms were smaller than the ones in Slytherin, but they were comfortable. Draco snooped around curiously, tracing the markings in the furniture and studying the photographs, posters, and Quidditch flyers cluttering the walls while Harry tidied his corner up a bit.
"Who's there?" he demanded. "H-hello?" he pulled out his wand and held it out in front of him, his hands still shaking from exhaustion. "I know you're in here, dim-wit, whoever you are!"
At the end of the dark platform, Draco froze, his grip on his luggage instinctively tightening. His father had to have jinxed him because his luck was as foul as the weather. There was only one horseless carriage left waiting for him at the platform, and of course, he could see Harry sitting by the door, his Hogwarts robes wrapped tightly around his slender figure. Ron was glaring at him through the misty rain, looking as agitated as ever, while Hermione sat massaging her temples in an attempt to calm herself. She must have been losing her patience with the bloke, and Draco didn't blame her in the least. She always had to rein the stupid Weasley boy in.
It was after midnight. Seamus and Neville were asleep, the curtains drawn shut around their beds, leaving Draco with a sleeping Harry and Ron, sitting sluggishly on his bed staring at the floor, lost deep in thought.
The air was cold. His nose was runny and red, and he could barely breathe. His glasses were fogged up, and he could barely see. . . but he could still feel, and he swore Draco's weak, delicate fingers squeezed his hand.
Harry felt his smile widen gleefully, and he almost jumped out of his seat. Draco had walked into the room and immediately met his gaze. They shared a small smile, and then he began to hurriedly walk over to the empty Slytherin table before he could be seen. Harry watched him longingly.
He would enjoy it. . . because as soon as he wakes up, his nightmare continues - just like it always does.
Harry rolled his eyes, and Draco smiled. "You're cute when you do that," The Slytherin said brazenly.
"And you," he chuckled quietly, looking Harry over with malicious eyes. "you will pay alongside him."
"Hermione is just trying to help you.  You're at your lowest,  Harry.  We both see that.  You're drooling over that twit,  you barely talk to anyone,  you're sneakin' about,  and you don't even care that your best mate just wants you back.  What happened to playing Quidditch together or teasing the first years just for the hell of it? You've been a right royal git,  and until you get your priorities straight. . . "
Harry balanced them out at a slow, steady pace several feet beneath the cloud-line, but it was close enough that Draco thought he could almost reach up and touch them.
Harry shook his head and then let it drop, his eyes fixated on his hands where they lay in his lap. "No," he said tremulously, "He dies."
Harry looked up at Draco for help, but he simply grinned deviously. "Show them the thing, the note."
"Oh," Ron suddenly regretted pulling away, because now Harry was curled up in a ball, hugging his knees to his chest. He looked like a terrified little boy again.
These passions were entirely one-sided. Draco was quite convinced of that. Not once had Harry wavered. Not once had Harry ever given the slightest suspicion of any kind emotion towards Draco other than contempt and raw, smoldering hatred.
"Well, at least I'm being fed," Ron jibed, his eyes narrowed spitefully, "you look like a walking sack of bones."
Hermione handed the note back to Harry and crossed her arms again, straightening her shoulders as she smirked up at Draco. "And Dumbledore is a genius. He probably charmed you without you noticing."
"Fuck, this potion is a mess. Are you sure we got the ingredients right, Potter?" Malfoy asked incredulously, staring down into the contents of their cauldron with a look of disgust on his pale, pointed face.
Draco had known where the Gryffindor Common Room and dorms were, but he had never been inside. The portrait hole was smaller than he had thought it was, but it was still more than large enough to fit through. Legs dangling over the edge of the wall, Draco took in his surroundings.
"Good afternoon, Madame Pomfrey," Professor Dumbledore smiled kindly at the round little witch as he walked into the infirmary, hands folded behind his back, his half-moon spectacles nearly tipping off of his long, narrow nose. "How's our young patient doing?"
Harry fell into step with the Slytherin's elegant, long-legged strides, beaming, his troubled thoughts momentarily forgotten. "You exaggerated a lot, from what I remember. '
Harry grinned as he climbed onto his broom, shaking his head. "Calm down, Malfoy. It's alright. There's no one here except Ron and Hermione, and Ron is a completely clueless bugger, so we'll be perfectly fine."
Pansy dropped her pug-like face to her lap, looking hurt. Draco ignored her. He was baffled by Harry's invisible confrontation. What had he even done it for? What kind of pleasure had he gotten out of it? Certainly none worth the trouble, though it was obviously a poorly made invisibility potion. Knowing Ron's inabilities in Potions class, it wasn't surprising. But what was the point of it?
The Gryffindor common room was still empty.  Dinner hadn't been over when they had left.  Everyone was still eating,  so naturally, the two boys could talk freely. Ron expected an honest answer.
"Oh, Harry, sometimes I'm amazed at how nieve you are. I really am. " Hermione stood up,  grabbed the books she had been reading at the table, and stormed away.
Draco froze, his lungs seizing up as his heart jumped into his throat. "P-professor Snape? " he choked.
Harry, alarmed, followed Draco's gaze unblinkingly. "Fuck," he hissed, squeezing Draco's hand tightly as he pulled the Slytherin protectively into his side.
Harry freed his hand and stretched his cramped fingers, turning to Draco with a concerned expression.
Harry fell to his knees at Draco's side, Ron and Hermione following closely behind him. His throat constricted, and his heart broke seeing Draco like this. He threw the Golden Snitch carelessly aside and lifted Draco's head into his arms as the Slytherin's limp body thrashed against the ground.
Being this close to Harry every day was going to be intoxicating. He wasn't sure if he would be able to control himself. But he grudgingly supposed that he would have to; otherwise, Ron's bulbous head really
Ron watched him a moment, studying him thoughtfully before he stood and quietly approached him. He sat down across from Draco and then glanced down at Harry before a small smile began to form on his lips.
Harry squealed loudly and shoved the note in his pocket before latching onto Draco's arm and practically dragging him down the hall. "This is brilliant!"
Harry reluctantly lifted his head and gave Ron a dreary smile. "Not much," he sighed. "Trelawney hasn't told us what we're doing yet, but it seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?"
Draco looked stupefied. "Well, bloody hell, Harry!" He ranted. "Things coulda been a lot easier for both of us if you had just let it 'appen. But no, the great Harry Potter just had to go and meddle like he always does. Blimey. . . what the hell did you know anyway? Weren't you raised in a cupboard? What did you know about Slytherin? I'll have you know, great wizards have come from Slytherin, and not all of them were dark wizards. . . albeit, most of them were. . . Still, Harry, you could 'ave saved me a lot of misery if you had just kept your pretty little mouth shut."
Draco smirked back at him as he walked over. He braced himself. "Alright, here goes nothing,'" he slowly began to lower himself onto the bed.
Draco didn't care to argue. Instead, he narrowed his eyes at Ron scornfully from beneath his dampened hood.
He knew he shouldn't worry. He kept telling himself that the Slytherin was none of his concern and that he might as well drop his investigation and leave the boy to take care of himself. He could, couldn't he? Harry groaned. He could never forget about Draco as long as he was in this condition. He just couldn't. He was still a human being, not to mention Harry's curiosity was getting the best of him just like it always did. Why was Draco so ill? What had caused all of this? He had to find out.
Secretly, beneath the table, Draco pinched himself. He opened his eyes and chanced a glance across the room only to meet Harry's gaze head-on this time. The boy flushed visibly and glanced away. He was leaning on his elbow, and his head was in his hand. He was fidgeting with his mess of jet-black hair, twirling the tousled curls around his finger as he pretended to read, the torchlight reflecting off of his wire glasses and dancing on the wall.
Draco was almost half-inclined to walk, but he reconsidered when a sudden gust of wind made him shiver through his robes. Reluctantly, he walked down the platform and climbed into the carriage.
Ron swallowed hard, and propped himself up on his elbow, and turned to face his friend. "You have got to stop staring at that thing, mate," he told him. "It's not doing you any favors. And whatever it is you see, it can change. Remember? Whatever it is, it's not absolute."
And then, all of a sudden, the Slytherin's lips twisted into a strangely amused smirk. He lifted his injured arm, grinning. "Sort of takes you on a trip down memory lane, doesn't it?" he joked, the corners of his grey eyes crinkling.
"If it hadn't been for him, you'd most likely be dead. You weren't in the best condition, you know."
Harry walked closely at his side, shoulders ever so delicately brushing. Each time, he felt like he might suffer an aneurysm. Suddenly, in one wonderful moment, calloused fingers brushed against his, and in that instant, he felt as if he were living a dream. Pulse racing, he closed his eyes and licked his lips as he gently brushed back, nudging him slightly with his knuckles, taking a chance.
"You psyched to lose the game tonight?" Harry asked Draco with a teasing grin, quietly admiring how the light caught in the Slytherin's stormy gray eyes. He rested his elbow on the table and propped his chin up in his hand. "I'm going to wipe the drool off your friends' faces with the business end of my broom."
Ron's stomach dropped sickeningly, his dinner churning, and he grimaced again as he felt a shooting pang of regret. "Oh,"
Draco drew an unsteady breath and struggled to remember, furrowing his brow in thought. He couldn't remember much. He remembered boarding the Hogwarts Express, the confrontation with Ron Weasley and Harry Potter, and the uncomfortably awkward ride from the station. Damn it, the butterflies! Being around Harry again was almost unbearable. He felt bitter. He hated how Harry could so easily get in his head; how he could disable him with just a glance and a sultry whisper.
Hermione's shoulders fell, and she released his arm and said sourly,  "Oh, I don't know, Harry. Maybe he actually has a life of his own.  Does that ever cross your mind?  Stop wasting yours by sticking your nose in his. "
Draco brushed a single lonesome tear from his cold cheek and turned to find the house-elf, Wilky, standing timidly in the open doorway. He was frightened of Draco, although he didn't have much of a reason of late. The Malfoy heir had kept mostly to himself over the summer and had, for the most part, been more sympathetic to the Malfoy house-elves than he used to make a habit of.
She smiled tenderly at him, though her anxiety was still visible in every little wrinkle on her kind, motherly face. "You fell last night and hit your head pretty badly. Do you remember anything? Anything at all?"
When he looked at the ball, at first, he thought maybe the crystal was broken. But then he realized what it was. He saw nothing—only darkness. Every witch and wizard knew what that meant.
His fingers trembled a little as he unfolded it, the paper brittle in his fingers, worn from the wind. What was it? Was it from his mother? Father? Was someone hurt? Draco's tongue flicked nervously across his dry lips as his mercury grey eyes finally settled on the tear-stained ink. It was short and abrupt but clear as day.
What if he never became an Auror? What if his life turned out nothing like he hoped it would? What if . . . what if all he saw was nothingness. What if. . . ?
Ron looked untrusting.  "If you're really sorry,  then stop paying any attention to soots like Malfoy.  Pay attention to the people that actually care about you."
"Fine, don't eat that, but please eat something, Malfoy." Harry squeezed Draco's hand beneath the table, and they shared a flushed smile.
Draco sat up and took the cup into his trembling hands. When he tasted it, it was warm and sweet, with a hint of honey and berries. It was nothing like the tea he was accustomed to drinking at home, and for a moment, he felt a smile tugging at his pale lips. It made him feel. . . happy.
Draco Malfoy focused intently on his breakfast, his gaze never wandering from his untouched plate of freshly toasted bread, melted butter, and brilliantly yellow eggs. He wasn't hungry. He felt nauseous, and sitting in the Great Hall was only making it worse. The smell of waffles and buttered English muffins was making his insides curdle. He fought the urge to vomit as he poked and prodded at his food with his metal fork, his lips curling in disgust.
The glass of freshly poured white wine slipped from Lucius' delicate grasp, and his jaws dropped as a rather womanly gasp escaped his throat.
A wide smile broke across Harry's face as his eyes scanned the crumpled parchment and the Headmaster's loopy cursive script. "To Gryffindor!"
Draco still could not compel himself to believe that any of this was real. Was he still unconscious? Was he still dying on a cot in the Hogwarts infirmary? If he was,  he didn't mind. Because here he was, walking side-by-side with Harry Potter himself through the halls of Hogwarts. It didn't matter if any of it was real. It didn't matter if the warmth of Harry's hand was a figment of his imagination because whether or not it was, he was still the one holding it.
Severus Snape glared down his long, hooked nose at Harry with a snarling expression. "Don't you have somewhere to be?"
"He's fine. We can talk about it later," Harry glanced curiously around the room. "The party is still going on? What time is it?"
Fred looked back at him briefly before quickly looking away, a somber expression on his long, pale face before he straightened his robes, glanced strangely at his brother, and left. George's eyes lingered on Draco, however, and the Slytherin stiffly stared back.
All eyes were focused on him, quiet murmurs filling the room, but Harry couldn't have cared less. His heart felt as if it, too, were shattering into a thousand shards.
His pale grey eyes fixed on Harry's broadening shoulders, Draco Malfoy watched the raven-haired boy dreamily as he left the Hall. He smiled to himself, feeling the happiest he'd felt in months. Harry had looked at him:
"Yes, dear?" Professor Trelawney leaned over their table, looking at Ron through her large spectacles. "What do you see? Tell us."
"You're an excellent flyer, Potter," he complimented the Gryffindor, still holding onto him. "You really know your way around a broom."
On Fridays, classes always felt particularly long and dull, but especially on this one. Potions class was quiet, besides the occasional whisper or giggle, which was immediately followed up by a sharp reprimand from Professor Snape. After giving the class that morning a curt greeting and a brief lecture on Pepperup potion, he set them to work on reading, giving direct orders to "stay focused" and not to "bother" him. Upon seeing Harry, he'd given him a strangely melancholy look that had left him feeling unsettled and a little uncomfortable.
Footsteps and voices echoed down the corridor. Harry clutched Draco desperately, gripping his hand so tightly he thought he might have been crushing it. He told himself he was wrong. Draco was alright. Draco was fine. He had to be. Things between them couldn't end. It had only just started. . .
"Stop worrying, Hermione! It's not even mid-year exams yet.  I'll be fine. I need to get to the bottom of-"
"I'm not joking." Draco rebutted, laughing as he turned to walk down the corridor, his mud-covered robes swirling gracefully behind him.
Harry inhaled a sharp breath, and suddenly he felt as if his cousin Dudley were sitting on his chest. His heart felt as if it were being crushed, and he struggled to fill his lungs with air, suffocating as his throat constricted.
"I think Dumbledore knows me well enough to know we won't be paying much attention to the rules, Granger." Draco interrupted Harry, wearing a haughty smirk, and Ron watched uncomfortably as Draco slid his hand down the small of Harry's back.
Harry eagerly grabbed Draco's hand and began to drag him through the Common Room. People were finally beginning to filter out and head to their dorms. Several of Harry's classmates shouted out to him.
The house-elf, Wilky, was standing quietly in the corner, and it was staring at Draco with wide bulbous eyes. Draco felt his stomach churn, and he quelled the rising urge to be sick as the realization of what he was about to do began to hit him. Dumbledore's gaze shifted away from Lucius at last and descended on the two boys lurking in the shadows, his eyes softening. Lucius gradually turned to face them, his jaw set, his expression hard and cold like stone.
Harry laughed happily and smiled his goofy smile, reaching up to hold onto Draco's shoulder for support. "I love you more."
Harry lowered his voice and attempted to pull his hand away. "Maybe I should go," he muttered hesitantly.
"It's very plain," he said gruffly above the crackle of the fire, "Even I can't deny the words. I feel humiliated."
Harry carries Draco to the hospital wing, much to Ron's dismay. Malfoy's mysterious condition piques Harry's curiosity.
Draco met the angry Weasley's glare, but weakly. He attempted to stretch his lips into a challenging sneer, but instead, it looked like a bitter smile. His eyes, instead of surging with rage, were rather sinking with fatigue, rimmed in purple.
Madame Pomfrey was hovering over a cot, wiping a patient's forehead with a damp cloth. She looked up at the Professor for a moment to give him a sad, skeptical look. "There has been no change in his condition as of yet," she sighed. "He hasn't so much as stirred even a little. Sir, I'm worried that he'll never wake up."
Hermione glanced towards the door with a small smile. "Well, Harry, it looks like your new friend is up and about again."
Draco swallowed hard and took a deep breath. "N-no. Um, never mind. . . I think I'm going to be sick."
Suddenly, everything was still, except for the animated chatter of the ogling students, and for a second, Harry's hateful sneer transformed into a confused, half-concerned stare. Ron's bewildered gaze kept shifting between the two boys, and Hermione looked as if she might have been holding her breath. Draco swallowed, but his mouth was dry. He could feel the tears in his eyes threatening to drop, and he clenched his jaw with a weak resolution. He wouldn't break in front of him. He wouldn't give in.
"Oh, piss off, Parkinson!" Draco called after her, sneering at her distastefully before shiftily looking back over at Harry.
Harry's grin broadened, and he swore he saw Draco's blush deepen when he looked back at him. The Slytherin was actually smiling. It wasn't a smirk or a self-righteous crooked twitch of his lips. It was completely and beautifully genuine. It stole Harry's breath away, honestly. Relishing this new-found confidence and feeling that he had a grip on something, Harry wrote another note on the crinkled, tired-looking parchment.
There was a din outside the door of his compartment - feet scuffling hastily by, girls laughing, boys jeering. Draco could hear himself breathing in the dark, quiet space, and for once, he felt nothing. The pain he'd felt beforehand had evaporated with his tears, and he was left feeling deadened inside. He sat there expressionless in the dark, waiting wordlessly for the racket to fade in his ears. After a few minutes, it was soundless, and Draco weakly stood, gripping the window-ledge for support as he helped himself up.
He wasn't sure what he feared the most. Loving someone he wasn't meant to love, or standing, wand-at-the-ready, face to face with Voldemort himself. He had heard the slanders his whole life. Hell, he had even used the slurs himself, calling others by names that now, he could only use when speaking of himself.
"You know what," Draco shakily reached for his letter, folded it, slipped it into an envelope, and sealed it shut, "screw it. I'm sending it! I can't just second guess my spells. They're excellent! Not even stupid Granger could break them."
Harry slowed the broom to a stop until they were hovering over the lake, and he turned his head to meet Draco's worried gaze.
Harry, who had crawled through the portrait hole before him, smiled up at him and offered him a hand. Draco took it and hopped down effortlessly, his hair bouncing.
Lucius Malfoy's narrowed eyes were trained upon the nameless red wax seal. So, the boy wished to remain anonymous, did he? The wicked man smirked slightly, reading the delicately composed inscription on the back of the brittle paper with a curious twitch of his eyebrow.
"Ouch!" He hissed, glaring angrily at the owl. "You are definitely spiteful. Makes sense." He glanced nervously around the room.
"Look, Ron, Malfoy might be a foul, loathsome creature, but he's still a person, and no one should suffer like that. Just look at him! He looks awful."
Draco directed the sneer towards Harry instead, and Harry felt his heart skip a beat. "No, that's repulsive." The sneer changed into an amused smile. "I would rather feed myself to a mountain troll."
"This. This told me everything," Lucius said in his oily voice. "I have to admit. Your charms were pretty good. I had difficulty opening it, but after a while, your protection spells yielded. Not too bad for a 5th year. I was pleasantly surprised," his tone then darkened, and his eyes narrowed into slits, "until I read what you wrote."
When they saw Draco, they began to whisper and mutter suspiciously to each other. He heard a few things that made his skin crawl, and he scoffed loudly, sneering. Whether Harry heard them or not, he didn't know because the Gryffindor kept walking, pulling Draco closely behind him.
Draco tuned him out, squinting into the sunlight as he stared upwards at the familiar owl soaring towards him, dark feathers disheveled from a long, urgent flight.
Draco slowly lifted his eyes from Harry's peaceful face and smiled regretfully across the room at Ron, his heart heavy.
Albus Dumbledore stood against his desk, a calm fury burning in his periwinkle blue eyes like a wildfire. Lucius Malfoy was facing him, back turned to his son, gesticulating frantically while shouting in his most vile, hair-raising voice. It was the voice Draco knew best. He heard it often, as he was a continual disappointment to his father, and the man never neglected to remind him of that fact.
Draco sat alone in the bleachers, grinning as he watched Harry land his broom, only to be swept up off his feet by a swarm of his classmates. As the scene unfolded before him, he couldn't help but feel a slight pang of nostalgia. He remembered observing a moment nearly indistinguishable all but four years ago, with a younger Harry at the center, the starring player.
Harry smiled broadly. He flipped the note over only to discover another juvenile doodle on the backside. This one poorly depicted Harry riding his broomstick into the Whomping Willow, which had been given an evil, laughing face. Harry was a caped stick figure, and the only thing that distinguished him was the huge round glasses and, of course, the lightning scar, which was made out to be much bigger than it really was.
Ron stopped walking and glared over his shoulder at Harry.  "So says you. I think we've done enough talking for one night. "
Ron grimaced. "Well, the stupid thing was wrong then, so who's to say it wouldn't mess it up again? I'm tellin' you; you can't trust these things." He wrinkled his nose and glared at it as if he could make it disappear.
"Are you feeling alright, Draco? Maybe you should lie down through Potions. I'm sure Professor Snape will understand. He likes you after all." Pansy rubbed Draco's arm consolingly.
And then, Draco's smile faltered, and Ron made a note of his whitened knuckles and clenched jaw. It was bothering him again.
A pair of firm, boyish hands gripped his arm, and Draco forced himself to open his eyes through the searing pain.
"Oh,  you heard me," Hermione groaned.  "I was trying to help you with the essay Professor Flitwick gave us,  but. . .  you zoned out. "
Draco felt several conflicting emotions. His cheeks burned with anger and humiliation, but at the same time, his gut was filled with the flittering wings of fairies. He was touched that Harry would have stooped down from his pedestal to save him, but at the same time, he was also ashamed that he'd allowed himself to
Draco's jaw clenched, and he picked at the dried mud on his robes. "It was just. . . I had a . . . seizure of some sort. Madam Pomfrey said my panic brought it on or something. It was fear-induced. In other words, I brought it on myself like a bludgering idiot."
Ron collapsed into one of the armchairs by the fire and pretended to take an interest in a book lying on the side table next to it. "It's just a question, " he replied innocently.
"Hey, mate! Sorry I'm late," Ronald Weasley panted, as he dropped his book bag carelessly on the floor and collapsed beside Harry. "What'd I miss?"
"Scratch that, I don't think we've ever seen him finish his plate," Ron added briefly, slowly chewing on a buttered dinner roll.
Draco smiled back, although it lacked luster. "They aren't my friends, so . . . by all means, go for it! The best of luck to you, though I'm sure you don't need it."
"He might, but it also might make him feel better. He thinks you're replacing him, Harry. If you tell him the truth, he'll know it's . . . different. You understand?"
Ron choked, juice dripping down his chin. He sprang out of his seat and ran through the Hall. Hermione laughed to herself and shook her head.
Draco shook his head violently, his throat constricted. "I don't know," he gasped, panicking. "He shouldn't be here. Something's wrong."
"Have not," A small smirk tugged at Draco's lips, and his eyes twinkled merrily. "I've done nothing but focus on my work, and you should probably do the same."
Lucius smirked coldly and pulled a folded piece of yellowed parchment from the breast-pocket of his waistcoat. He waved it through the air as if to taunt his son.
Draco smirked and turned to catch a glimpse of Ron's hopeful expression. "Sorry to disappoint, Weasley, but I won't be playing. I know you'd love to see me get clobbered, but I can scarcely get on my broom, much less fly it," he then added gloomily, "without smacking into a tree."
Finally, after what felt like an extremely uncomfortable eternity for Ronald, a slender, blonde-headed figure walked into the room his head bowed as he focused on the book he was holding open in his hand. He was eating an apple as he walked, his eyebrows furrowed slightly as he read.
