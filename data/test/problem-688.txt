For a second the boy got anxious, fearing that maybe his father had found out about his rule breaking at hogwarts, but his mother's smile reassuerd him that it was nothing of that sort. As soon as their child set among them, Lucius started talking.
Two days later, when the Dursleys were sure he wouldn't faint again after too much exhaustion, they sent him to buy some groceries at the local supermarket. He finished the shopping as fast as possible and then went through some streets nearby scanning them for a pet store. Just as he was about to go back to Privet Drive (his arms were hurting from carrying the bags and the Dursleys would get suspiscious if he didn't return soon) he saw a sign with brightly coloured paw prints on it. Relieved he entered and grabbed the first bag of bird treats he spotted from the shelf. They were for canaries but that didn't matter.
“Ron's wand is broken, professor. And as he attempted the charm it was off course and it accidentally hit Hermione and, well... you see what it did to her.”
Harry was more than relieved when the first week of school was finally over with. He hadn't really done any schoolwork at all over the summer and now he had a bit of struggle to get back into the rhythm of it. But it was alright, both Hermione and Terry had already offered to help him catch up. But for priorities’ sake Harry's number one thought of the week hadn't been homework. It was the Quidditch tryouts on Saturday. All positions were open so everyone was free to choose which to try out for. Harry was pretty sure he either wanted to go for seeker or for chaser. He didn't really care actually but it would be cool to follow on his fathers legacy as one of the best chasers at Hogwarts ever. Seeker was his backup. He knew he'd have to go against Malfoy who had years of experience on him, but he was total crap at keeper and at the Weasley's the twins had always been the beaters in their little matches so he hadn't really had a chance to see if he would be good at that.
Surprised Draco looked up and saw Harry sitting on his bed, smiling at him, his hair tousled even worse than usual. He realised, he'd never seen Harry waking up before, even though they'd been roommates for months now and his heart warmed at the sight. He felt a light blush crawling up his cheeks and shook his head to get rid of it. His gaze directed to the book he'd just been unwrapping, he finally dared to answer,
The dome shaped ceiling loftily showed a night sky with gleaming stars and constellations and hovered high above their heads.
"Slytherin won fair and square! Then, he first changed the points so that Ravenclaw would've won but no, that's not enough! He had to give stupid Longbottom ten points for his fat arse being in the way of others! He didn't even deserve half of the points and then Ravenclaw would've won! Only because Gryffindor is his favorite. Probably was a stupid Gryffindork himself!"
It was hard to convince himself that the voice in his head was not one of sympathy and after a few more minutes he gave up and just decided to put his brain on off-mode again. When he came back it was because Loony was scrambling off her seat next to him.
There are some things you don't just go through together without developing a friendship afterwards.
After giving Hedwig a sympathetic look he finally went downstairs to get it over with. It went as well as possible in a situation like this. Didn't mean he could avoid doing the chores today but he got away with the less energy draining tasks. Still, when he went to bed this evening, he felt like a horde of trolls had just ran him over.
Gulping down the feeling of desperation Draco stood up from his desk chair and paced around his room. Dobby had been his last resort to find out what had happened to him and the elf had agreed with
Harry’s heart went crazy. He couldn’t have heard that correctly, right? But now it was definitely time for him to say something.
Draco didn't answer. After some more shifting noises an asian girl's head peaked up in the same place where the hair had been before.
“Oh, that sucks. I think all teams should do the tryouts like the Ravenclaw team. Every year for every position except the captain's. That's so much more fair, don't you think.”
"Leave me alone. You don't know anything. Of course, perfect Potter had to be nosy. No, keep your mouth shut. I don't need your opinion. And don't follow me!"
Cho let out a breath and smiled at him. “That's my backup. I really want to get seeker but apparently half the people here want the same thing.”
Draco smirked after the invisible boy knowingly, who's steps could be heard faintly, running down the spinal staircase.
Finally it clicked and Harry followed Ron away from the masses of pupils. They ran up a staircase and along deserted corridors.
When he finally heard the door creak open he sighed in relief and turned over once more to immediately be welcomed by a dreamless slumber.
A chill was suddenly running down his spine. Not many people dared to threaten his father. When Draco finally left the room, carefully closing the door behind him, he came to the conclusion that he needed to find out more about this
He prodded his head towards his two friends. All he received was a shrug before the blonde set off. Actually he felt a bit bad for leaving him alone.
Draco's heart rate doubled when he hastily threw a glance back at his father to check if he had noticed that somehting was off. He hadn't. Quietly he picked up the glasses and held them into the opening of the cabinet. Nothing happened. After another quick glance at his father he dared to whisper something.
When Harry entered the great hall he was greeted by a great feast. In order to make the tables look less empty only the seats near the teachers table were set.
"Longbottom! What is your fat arse doing out here after curfew? Professor Snape will have a field day when I tell him about it and he will take loads of points from Gryffindor for it!"
"Hmmm....very brave....also ambitious....one could find a true friend in you....and you are very eager to learn....very intelligent, in plenty ways....but where to put you? You would fit into all of them. Maybe not Hufflepuff. And it probably wouldn't be wise to put you into Slytherin. Too much pride and prejudice. No, you're full of love. But will it be Ravenclaw or Gryffindor?"
Cursing, he jumped to his feet and hurried over to his dear owl, picking up the cage and holding onto it tightly. Only then he became aware of all those people, who had stopped and stared at them openly and judging. Harry cast a rash glance at Ron who was still groaning on the floor. Wrecking his brain for a credible explanation he cleared his throat and spoke up.
She gave him a nice smile. It was a beautiful smile. Harry smiled back and the two of them kept on talking throughout the feast.
After Norbert had attacked Fang, Hagrid had agreed to let Charlie Weasley escort the dragon to Romania. Then Hermione had started planning. Charlie and a few of his most trusted colleagues would be coming on brooms and arrive at midnight of the following Saturday, on the highest tower, the Astronomy tower. On the grounds they'd be too easy to spot, so they had decided on this location instead. Their only problem now was to walk a literal dragon through the whole school building, up to the tower - unseen!
At 11PM on the appointed day Harry and Hermione were knocking on Hagrids door who opened it teary eyed. Ron had had to stay behind because the cloak would never be able to cover the three of them
This boy was unbelievable! Just leaving him alone in the dark with a cowardish dog to do... what exactly?
The other three looked at him in shock and surprise. And all of them started speaking at the exact same time. Though they talked all at once he could make out Hermione's voice telling him off for entering it because it was forbidden and how stupid he was, Ron saying something about being confused and he could even hear Hagrid saying something like:
The following silence was filled to the brim with tension. Harry was about to strike up a conversation about work or something when Pansy picked up her empty glass with one hand and grasped Luna’s wrist with the other.
And his friends. All people he had known before....they had all been sorted into Slytherin....or were at least going to be. He would be all alone.
This time the silence lasted longer. Harry heard a sob ripping through the loaded air and his eyes wandered from the floating letter to Malfoy.
He carded his hand through his hair, not really caring that his hairdresser had spent an hour taming it earlier. Slowly, Harry let his gaze wander over the people in the room. He had to stay at least for an hour and Hermione had opted out this time. Unwillingly, considering that Ron had caught a dreadful curse two weeks prior and someone had to look after Rose and Hugo while he was at St. Mungos.
During the train ride everything was perfect. Just as it should be. Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, Blaise; and Draco in their center of attention. Nothing to remind him that he wasn't a Slytherin as he was supposed to be. Up until the feast it was like Potter didn't even exist. But as he sat among all those Ravenclaws he became incredibly aware of his absence. His friends weren't around and the Ravenclaws ignored him – not that that wasn't exactly what he wanted, mind you. He just felt his mask slipping away a bit and usually he just had to glare at Potter and let the
“Shut up, number two. You’re not the hero dad made you believe you are. The scars you collect won’t change anything about that.”
The Goyle family arrived soon after and Draco was able to return to his own room with Greg as their fathers had disappeared into Lucius' office to discuss some 'serious matters' and Narcissa had involved Mrs. Goyle in an animated exchange of gossip over a cup of tea. The visitors stayed until after dinner and everything went perfectly well:
He looked small and desperate sitting on the floor and leaning against the wall next to his suitcase.
Pansy smirked like she was competing with the devil while Harry collected his things and shoved them in his bag roughly. Hermione winced. Harry heaved the bag onto his shoulder and went to leave, but not without casually wishing Draco and Pansy a nice day again. This time, Malfoy straight up ignored him.
The next four weeks passed by in a rush and suddenly the holidays arrived. Most of the students left and Christmas Eve came.
"So, the door knocker is going to ask you a riddle every time you wish to enter. You need to answer it correctly before the door opens. Watch!"
In the meantime Harry had gotten himself his quill, ink and a roll of parchment and was getting comfortable on his bed. For a short time it was quiet and he heard the other boys whispering about something. Then, surprisingly, Terry Boot spoke up.
“So, let’s make that clear, once and for all: I am not too good for you. All my family will see is that you make me happy. And besides, I won’t survive another one of Hermione’s choices without you!”
Hedwig almost bit him when he placed the bread in her cage. She hadn't had food since their return from Hogwarts. Harry already had had to put up a big fight that she wouldn't be locked away in the cupboard under the stairs - also known as his former bedroom - with the rest of his wizard stuff. Instead there was now a lock keeping the cage closed so he wouldn't send letters to “other freaks like him“.
Draco nodded but didn't speak, yet, in favor of sorting his thoughts first. He let the events of the summer flash up in front of his eyes and one by one started retelling them. Every now and then he would take a look at the time in order to not be late for class on the first day.
She grabbed her friend's arm and pulled her into a standing position. Harry was now getting a bit nervous and looked at Cho, hoping to receive a logical and truthful answer from her.
When Harry awoke on the next morning it was from the angry knocking on his door. Looked like he had switched his alarm off and fell back asleep.
But on the other hand, people had started to get over it. Draco was working as a healer and many people only saw his face after he had already saved their lives. Things were getting easier again. He was slowly overcoming the guilt that had been eating him up during the first years after The Battle. The past slowly started to become his past and he was instead focusing on turning himself into the best version of Draco Malfoy there could be.
bearing his father’s name. As if it would make ‘Lucius Malfoy’ transform into ‘Harry Potter’ or ‘Albus Dumbledore’ or some other dumbass. Nothing changed. Aggressively he banged the door shut and made his way to Madam Hooch’s office. Maybe she would take them and keep them as school brooms.
Finally everyone who stayed for Christmas was seated and Dumbledore stood up to greet them with one of his weird speeches and open the feast.
And again he hadn't got a destination. This time he just ran for his life. His feet carried him all the way down to the dungeons. He ran and ran until he heard a familiar voice.
He broke the candy in two, almost equal halves and stood up handing Draco one of them. The blonde took it eagerly, not even think about rejecting the offer for a second time. Harry raised his half into the air.
Thankfully it didn't. It only took them a lot of time to drag Norbert up all those stairs. Hagrid had given it something to calm down which caused the dragon to shuffle sleepily all the way. It almost tripped over the last step on the seventh floor's staircase, right under a singing and giggling Peeves who was writing swearwords onto the ceiling in black ink.
And he was just too aware of the angry and confused glares from the Slytherin table and from his childhood friends who weren't sorted yet.
Due to the feast rule Harry couldn't sit with the Weasleys and Hermione, so he sat down next to Malfoy. At first he kind of expected the other boy to insult him and push him away but the blonde only shortly looked up and then turned his gaze back to his empty plate again. Cho had taken the train back home the day before so he had no one to talk to. This made him think of something.
“-be on Sunday morning, 8 AM on the Quidditch pitch. Thank you for your attention, I hope I will see a lot of your faces Sunday! That's it!”
Desperately wanting to look at the beautiful man again, he luckily managed to convince himself to say something before giving in.
“I'm really sorry. We- we were late and running to catch the train and then we lost control over our carts. We'll be more careful now.”
“... but be careful to not let the fame get to your head, Harry. Do you hear me? Don't do any more drastic stunts like the one with the car just to get more of that incredible taste.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Apparently someone here has selective memory loss. But for good measure: I love you.”
This was boring. He hadn’t thought this through properly. He had over an hour to kill. Sitting here with the guy who kept bullying him and that guy’s best friend while the two of them were doing school stuff was not as entertaining as he’d thought it would be. Harry felt incredibly out of place.
his roommates wouldn't quit listening to! And by now they even kept playing over and over inside his head as well! And as he knew them by heart because he'd heard the same stupid songs so often (no he did not like them, thank you very much) he was tempted to
let me finish! Following him around would be too obvious, but we could at least take a look into his office, maybe we'll find something there!"
Just when he was about to leave, he heard a tapping noise, similar to small stones being thrown against the window. He turned around and saw a white figure sitting on the window sill.
Whatever weird thing Pansy and Blaise had been talking about at lunch, Harry had forgotten all about it a few moments later. Draco had already finished eating and had taken out a book to read. Harry decided to check the cafeteria first after he had dropped off Hermione and Ron at their classrooms. Before Ron went inside, he gave Harry a look.
“I didn’t say that!” A shushing noise came from the front desk of the library. Madam Pince was back. “You know what-“
Now Harry reached for Draco’s right wrist and stopped him from doing any more work. “Not a chance. We’re leaving now!”
He ran back to the table to grab his wand and sprinted out of the room and through the corridors while hurriedly eating down his breakfast. When he arrived at the potions classroom, the Hufflepuff girl was already waiting for him. Except for her, the corridor was empty, luckily. She gave him a sceptical glance leaning her brown-haired head to the right.
Gathering his courage he stepped forward, took some of the powder and flung it into the fireplace. He hoped no one saw him wince when the green flames burst out of nowhere. Taking a last deep breath he stepped in. Against his expectations the fire was really cold. When he finally dared to breathe in, in order to say the words, ashes were finding their way into his lungs and the urges to caugh and sneeze were interjecting with his ability to speak properly. What came out was something like:
Curious, Harry walked in and froze as he saw a letter floating mid-air and raging at a completely shocked and helpless-looking Draco Malfoy.
When Harry left the bathroom, with brushed teeth and his pajamas on, all four boys looked up at him and he had the strong suspicion, that Terry, Michael and Anthony had just stopped talking about him. He lay down on his covers and drew the curtains close. As he calmed down the events of the day filled his mind and he doze off with a smile on his lips. Today he'd defeated a mountain troll with his friends.
And he found him! Actually he found four of them sitting together at the other end of the long wooden table. Harry identified them as Ron and his siblings, whom he remembered from the train station.
"Hey, Hagrid. Do you know something about the three headed creature in the corridor on the 3rd floor?"
Heaving his suitcase off the overhead rack he hurried onto the Platform as fast as possible with this extra weight. But he didn't have to carry it for long; his mother had seen him and hurried forward to enclose her son in a tight and loving embrace.
Draco spent Saturday evening and most of Sunday with Pansy, Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle talking about their holidays (Draco didn't utter a word about his own) and insulting some Gryffindorks. Before returning to the Ravenclaw tower on Sunday evening he went to
A few slow steps and then he felt a thin hand wrapping around his upper arm slowly dragging him backwards.
Yes, it was probably about time he started wearing this dress. He looked absolutely fabulous in it after all.
He really hoped it had only been starters luck or so. Otherwise his father would most likely get quite angry.
Percy, the prefect -how could he not remember that he was a prefect as he made it as obvious as possible- and the twins, Fred and George. As the black haired boy walked by, he asked:
“Oh, look, Blaise! Potter is on the floor! Really, the people of this school need to stop littering!”
For a second, Harry was confused what she was talking about. Then he remembered their earlier conversation.
There was a sting somewhere in his chest. It had settled there somewhere around the time he had realized he might never get to see Draco smile or laugh at him again. The worst thing about it was that it was his own fault. And that he couldn’t think of anything that would be able to fix it.
McGonagall's lips were thinner than ever. Harry opened his mouth to explain their situation but was cut off by Hermione.
had read his mind, a steaming mug of hot chocolate appeared on the small table in front of him. He muttered a 'thanks' and took a sip of the sugary substance before he told his story.
for not telling him what that meant - they clearly knew something! - and therefore hadn't been visiting the room since that night. Instead he'd been spending more time with Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy and Blaise and sometimes also could be found reading in his dorm. He would never read in the Ravenclaw common room, the others would probably try and
I’m very sorry for the long wait. If you’ve been following what else I’ve been posting in the past few months, you’ll know I was a bit preoccupied. However, as soon as August comes to an end I will try to get back to some kind of a regular posting rhythm with this fic!
Draco was excited. In two weeks school was starting again and he’d just received his letter with the supply list. This meant he would have to go to Diagon Alley soon. Usually his mother was the one to take him shopping but she just so happened to be busy that day and his father was free from work and still wanted to sell stuff in
Thinking about Harry's laugh, he craved to hear it again. It felt like an eternity since the last time. Maybe if he had went down to breakfast instead he might have heard it floating over from the Gryffindor table where he was probably sitting with Granger and the Weasle Clan. That was the moment when it hit.
Defence Against The Dark Arts was the only subject Potter had outshone him in this year. Draco did not want that to happen again so he would start studying for it early. For the other subjects as well because Granger, a
When he returned to Hogwarts Draco had finally found new confidence and pride in his family name again. That he still couldn't stop thinking about stupid Potter made him really mad but it was nothing that could make him budge again. It kind of helped to rant about it to Dobby. The house elf worked surprisingly well as replacement for
The longer they talked about it, the stranger got the theories. Meanwhile they had started to walk upstairs and came to a halt where they had to part ways.
resonated Mr Malfoys cold voice in his head. And somehow forgetting how Malfoy had treated him in the past few months he wanted to comfort him. To tell him it was going to be alright.
When he returned to his dorm, his relief of having found an ideal storage spot was replaced by annoyance. Well-known chords were seeping through from the other side of the door. Michael Jackson. Not again. Reluctantly he entered the dorm and scowled at the three boys gathered on Goldstein’s bed, before sitting on his own and pulling all the curtains tight around it. He picked a textbook from his bedside table and started doing his homework. And if his toes jiggled to the beat of the music – that wasn’t his fault and nobody ever needed to know about that.
His movements and pronounciation seemed confident enough but then the broken state of his wand messed up everything. Apparently fixing a wand wasn't as simple as wrapping it in obnoxious amounts of spellotape. A light purple streak shot from the point where it was snapped in half rather then from its tip and just about grazed Hermione's shoulder. The girl immediately started sobbing and tears were streaming down her face when she turned around to glare at the redhead.
Hermione let out a long sigh. Then she set her backpack down and started putting away all her books, so she’d have her hands free. How she always managed to fit them all in there was a mystery to Harry.
Harry was very pleased with himself. This was definitely progress. After school he would tell Hermione all about it.  This was amazing.
This time he wasn’t honoured with an answer. At the end of the hour the second glass was empty as well and Harry left the cafeteria with a fuzzy feeling of accomplishment in his stomach. He couldn’t wait for Thursday.
mudblood!) as she came across the Slytherin compartment on the Hogwarts Express. The only thing he felt was disgust and hatred.
it was to see the positive sides when you are locked in your room with bars in front of your window and getting cold soup shoved through a cat-flap once a day?
Pain shot through his head and neck, worse than he was used to from his scar. But this wasn't the scar. His sight blackened in front of him and he just managed to get off the bed before he threw up onto the floor.
The asian girl, Cho, gave him a questioning glance. She surely wanted to know why he was being alone all the time.
After the Potter boy had finished admiring the effects of the cloak, he finally opened Draco's presents.
“No discussion! This is my team! My rules! If you can't deal with that I have no problem disqualifying you. I don't care how great you are, if you don't respect me you will only keep the team from forming a working unit! Does anyone still want to mope about it or can we start now?”
now! He could understand that some business was more important than personal matters. His other side just got even more angry at him.
If only there was someone he could talk to. He felt a lump closing his throat again as a sob welled up inside him. His mother had been the only person he could talk to. And now she wanted to leave him here over Christmas as well!
"Oh... I guess I forgot to tell you. I found it in my bed when we returned form detention on saturday."
Draco sighed in fake exasperation. “In fact, it was about you, yes. But don’t you dare get all braggy about that!”
“That was crazy! Each of your hits was so precise! Why didn't you tell me you were so good at that?”
I mean, you have to see the positive sides: at least now Hermione thought they've been punished enough and was taking to them again.
When Draco awoke on the next morning a new robe was placed upon his dresser. It wasn't a dress robe, it looked more like the robes Lucius was wearing for work. He put it on, knowing that his father would not have him wearing something else, and found that he liked it on himself. It gave him a look of
At lunchtime Pansy, Blaise and Theo arrived - his mother knew he prefered them to stupid Crabbe and Goyle - and Dobby along with two other house elves served them some amazing Fish and Chips.
Ron's face had adapted the colour of tomatoes and he gave an embarrassed nod. Harry felt really sorry for his friend. He knew the Weasleys didn't have the money to buy Ron a new wand just like that. The one he had, hadn't even originally been bought for him but was also a hand-me-down version from one of his older brothers. Harry would immediately offer to give them the money but he knew it was pointless. They would never accept charity, even if Harry didn't mean it as such.
Even though the previous day’s events had exhausted Harry deeply, he was up and about at sunrise – a habit that's harder to get rid of than one might think – and on his way to pay Hagrid a visit. The other boys had all still been asleep when he‘d left the dorm so he didn't get to actually reunite with them, yet, but he'd been glad to see them all back and well.
Of course he would share his sweets with a friend in a situation like this but Potter wasn't his friend. He'd had his chance. And he'd missed it. So what if no one cared about
Gently he placed his hands on Draco’s waist and they easily started dancing to the slow rhythm of the music.
The potions professor returned his embrace and placed a caressing hand on his head. And Draco just blurted out everything while Severus listened patiently.
Draco shook his head, his lips pressed together tightly. He rubbed his wrists together until the usually pale skin there turned bright red in order to stop the urge to cry.
The last question they were now facing was, how they ever would be able to stop Snape from getting that stone. They wrecked their minds over it but Ron was only whining about how he needed food because he would be starving so they called it a day, went to dinner and split up afterwards, everyone heading for their respective common room.
Sorry for the long wait. I hope all of you are staying safe and healthy during this covid-19 outbreak. <3
about the fact that he had to return to the Dursleys soon even though he hadn't wasted a single thought on them in very long.
He wore robes like everybody else. The yellow and black striped tie told them he was a Hufflepuff and he had a badge on his chest which said 'Headboy'.
"Oh, bugger off Malfoy! This is none of your business! Do you even realise that if I lose house points it's also your house that loses the points? Let's just get back to our dorms before we all get caught!"
“I know you like to give everyone makeovers, Pansy, but he’s definitely not worth your time. I’m not even sure he looks at his clothes before he puts them on.”
Instead he opened the one from the Dursleys he was surprised. They had actually sent him a five pound note. That was like the only money he had ever received from them.
Harry didn't seem to notice that Draco had stopped unwrapping his own presents. Neither did he seem to notice that he was watching him all along relishing the warm feeling and tingle in his  stomach he got from seeing Harry smile. Said boy was now unpacking his second large parcel and a silver fabric slipped through his hands and landed on the bed.
Draco snorted and shook his head. Then he abruptly snapped it up to glare at his friend. Because Blaise had said: “Thanks, you too.”
Draco sighed. “You’re an idiot, Potter.” This was a sentence that was not unusual from Draco, even though it did have a bit of a fond ring to it that hadn’t been there before.
Rumours had spread as to why exactly Gryffindor as well as Ravenclaw had lost a total amount of 100 points in one night. The suggestions were wild and not anywhere near the truth but this Friday at the latest they would at least know who was guilty.
on Monday morning. Her disappointed expression made his heart clench but he would NOT budge this time. He wanted to prove that he was the rightful Malfoy heir.
Something about her voice was weird. Harry searched the stands for Ron and found him looking very uncomfortable between Colin and Lockhart.
Both houses seemed to be good choices to him. But he wouldn't really want to spend all his time with this Malfoy guy. He didn't seem very nice. Neither at Madam Malkin's nor on the train.
“Well, what do you expect me to do? Tell my father to return them? Can’t you just accept a present?”
Before he could start thinking about what exactly it had been he put his mind on off-mode until he was in his own compartment again. On the way back Draco caught a glimpse of Harry looking at a picture in this weird photo book he had turned up with a few days ago. His lips were pulled into a soft smile but his eyes were sad. Despite that he somehow looked quite cheerful. It was confusing.
Then he had about one hour to get ready for family dinner. Narcissa and Draco stood at the fireplace waiting only for Lucius to show up. When 30 minutes went by and he hadn't shown up they went on their own.
"Yeah, I mean, we would've outdone them in any challenge. It's not our fault we didn't know about it!",
She was sitting on the floor, books surrounding her, one of them lying open in her lap. Without looking up at the boys she started reading the interesting passage out loud.
He ran up to Hermione, dragged her onto her feet and outside the bathroom, where Ron was already standing, a frightened look on his face. They turned around just in time to see the giant creature crashing onto the ground, face first.
And the time dragged forward slowly and got slower and slower until it seemed to stand still completely and Draco was to await a whole year of this.
Draco jumped and almost fell out of his seat. Lost in his thoughts he hadn't realized that the sorting had started.
He couldn't tell Pansy and Blaise about the dog-creature thing and neither could he mention that he wondered why the Granger girl suddenly started talking to Potter.
Pansy on the other hand threw him a blinding smile that was just as sweet and indigestible as Hagrid’s homemade fudges. ”See you tomorrow, darling!”
His friends could sometimes be quite pesky, especially Crabbe and Goyle, who don't even know what you're talking about after you explained it twice.
A thought crossed Draco's mind: When they were here that meant that his friends had to be back as well. Like this he left the dorm and walked down towards the Slytherin common room, the catchy melody still stuck inside his head.
Again there were some clicking noises before a song started playing. It started off with some weird noises. Then there was a strange instrument playing a melody. Monotonous but somehow really catchy. Soon a voice started singing.
George snorted. “Almost done, lazy ass!” He put away the final box of firecrackers and locked the storage room. After he put his jacket on and grabbed his bag, he joined Fred at the back door.
It had gotten a bit of a habit of Draco's to always keep an eye on Potter. In every situation. If that Scarface was actually poisoning or hexing him, it had to wear off after some time. Then he'd have to renew it and Draco would be watching out for every sign that he tried to do so.
For a moment Harry wasn’t quite sure where this was going, but it became clear quickly as Draco continued talking.
"How dare you leaving the path when Dumbledore told us clearly to stay together! You're loosing enough points during potions. You're dragging our reputation through mud!"
Harry had been sneaking out with his cloak more than once but never for that long. Something felt terribly wrong this time. Something must have happened. Draco wasn't able to close an eye that night because Harry didn't return. At all.
Outrageous, Harry opened his mouth to argue - he hadn't even said a word - but closed it again. This was no good anyways and it would only cost him even more house points.
Then he saw him. He was standing at one of the high tables, chatting with Parkinson and Luna. Of course, the only one of his friends who was here tonight just had to be the one who had made friends with Draco Malfoy.
Harry didn't get a chance to continue this thought because as soon as he reached the Ravenclaw table he was besieged by about a dozen boys and girls of different age shaking his hands. All of whom were cheering and clapping.
The stunning view of the grounds lying still beneath the covers of the night. The sky outside matching the painting on the dome shaped ceiling. Bright stars all over. And the cozy little fire. And the bookshelves. And the calm that was radiating off the colours that could be seen anywhere. Blue and bronze. Only then Harry realized how much he had really missed this place. Taking a final glance at the Rowena statue, he turned towards the staircases. He was home. Enjoying every step, he slowly made his way up to their dormitory which was now bearing the number II instead of the I that had sat there just a few months prior.
“There isn’t. But I promise you, you will like it. And if you don’t, I’ll let you choose for me next time it’s my turn.”
Malfoys didn't do that! He went into the bathroom and when he returned another song was playing from a weird silver box, as he could see from this angle. The three boys sitting around that thing were completely absorbed by their conversation and seemed to still haven't noticed him.
The greasy, small wizard made what some people would call a bow towards each of them and in return received a halfhearted nod from Lucius who still wore a disgusted scowl on his lips.
The following weeks were pretty awkward. Harry tried to talk to Malfoy again but the blonde just got even meaner and more brazen than before.
A single, magical chocolate candy with a cheer-up-potion core. An expensive sweet, customarily used to satisfy crying, bored or lonely children at pureblood-dinner-parties. Draco's mouth watered at the sight of the delicate chocolate. Therefore it took him a bit to realize that Harry was smiling at him knowingly.
Without another word she opened the chest and took out the tiny, golden ball. It stretched it's wings, she let go and it went off. When it had disappeared from sight she blew a whistle and seven teenagers on brooms were in the air.
Since his fourth birthday, when his father had taken him to his first Quidditch match, he'd been in love with the sport and the idea of becoming a professional Quidditch player was stuck inside his head. The match taking place in front of him was quite eventful. Slytherin clearly had the upper hand, they were leading 50 to 10 after ten minutes, but their seeker almost got hit by a bludger, sent from a Weasley, twice. Not long after, unfortunately, Gryffindor caught up and the counter stayed at 60 to 60 for almost an entire hour. Suddenly Flint made a dirty move, knocking Wood off his broom with a bludger causing angry shouts from the Gryffindor stands. After that, the game came to an end very fast. Without the Gryffindor's keeper it was an easy one for Slytherin to score three more times in a row and before Gryffindor had a chance to return the 'favor', the Slytherin seeker caught the snitch. Deafening cheers erupted around Draco and he left his seat exitedly discussing the match with Blaise and Crabbe.
“You say what you’re thinking without a filter and without showing even a teaspoon of empathy. Maybe that makes
They didn't really feel the potion wear off. Completely lost of any sense of time they played in the snow and when they went inside again, fully drenched, the effects of the liquid happiness were all gone. Still they were grinning at each other happily - until Filch came across their way.
Draco stood in front of the door to the Ravenclaw tower, not quite listening to the Door knocker’s riddle. Then he made a hasty spin on his heel and left Ravenclaw tower behind, with hurried steps that his father would definitely scold him for.  Determinedly, he searched for the fastest way back to the broom cupboard with the
“Hey, baby! Nothing to worry over. Just a few minutes. And they wouldn’t care if we were two hours late either.”
Harry’s head shot around to look back at him and Draco noticed how pale he was. The blue moonlight falling onto his features didn’t make it any better. He had some kind of haunted look in his eyes. Draco felt something like concern welling up in his chest... no,
He suddenly felt so light and happy as he flew across the country in a car with three red-headed idiots, his beloved owl finally soaring across the night sky again, right next to them.
The day after, when Draco told his father he hadn't been able to retrieve the books Lucius seemed about to explode but Narcissa gave him a glare and in the end he wrote a letter to
Draco groaned. What had he gotten himself into? “If you insist, Potter. But only after you’ve made me some breakfast.”
She laughed a beautiful laugh before reaching behind her and placing a huge present on his lap. Draco sat up in excitement.
. Somehow he found that fitting and smiled to himself about it. He smiled because soon he would be back at school.
With shaky steps he managed to get to his door, out and across the hallway into the bathroom. With every move the headache got worse again. When he arrived, the room went black and he felt like vomiting again but somehow he managed to calm himself down by gripping onto the sink tightly. The light hurt in his eyes when he looked up again so he pressed them shut. Blindfolded like that he reached for the cabinet door and opened it.
that you don't have orders from my father to fulfil, you will spend on this project. He would be in great danger at Hogwarts. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen to Harry Potter,
Then, Graves switched keepers and the brunette girl Harry had raced during the warm up was now up. He didn't get a single Quaffle in after that. Cho did, once, but Merlin, that girl was good! Harry wasn't surprised when, after the time was up, she got keeper. Cho finally got her cheer and excitement back when she was chosen for chaser along with that good looking guy with the undercut, Calum Williams, who, Harry was pretty sure, had played the same position the year before. The final member of the chaser trio was Luke Chambers. Harry was so happy for Cho that he almost forgot to be disappointed about not getting in himself.
Then there was a much too familiar growl. Draco wanted to scream, he wanted to run, but he found that he coulnd't move.
Draco’s lips twitched into a small smile as well for a moment. “Good morning. Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.”
It sounded a bit forced. Probably one of the other two had told him to make the offer. But he was not going to throw that chance away.
"Yeah, I remember you chasing after birds on your first broom for weeks until we bought you a snitch you could practice with."
Sighing Harry shook his head to get rid off the anger welling up inside him. The git had gotten even more insufferable over the last weeks, though he just couldn't get it over with being offensive to him.
Draco thought. Just as he was about to leave he saw another piece of writing. A short note inside the wooden box.
Harry was ripped from his thoughts when Flitwick instructed them to attempt the tickling charm on their partners. He paired up with Ron while Hermione was stuck with Padma Patil, whose Gryffindor counterpart was already giggling with her best friend Lavender even though neither of them had their wands out, yet.
He would’ve very much liked to repeat it for her, but he was not stupid. He knew she was in power and could throw him off the team whenever she saw fit.
They both groaned as they turned around. It was Colin Creevey. Of course it was. The little wanna-be photographer had been following him around all week, constantly asking for pictures and autographs and while that had been kinda cute in the beginning it was starting to become really annoying.
Draco’s mind was all over the place. Of course, he knew something! But that wasn’t the point, was it? She was still accusing him of something he could never agree to. Well, not anymore.
Luna, who was sitting on Ginny’s lap, asked the highly important question: “Hermione, what movie are we watching tonight?”
First Harry Potter didn't want to be his friend and now this. He belonged to Slytherin! His whole family had always been in Slytherin. This was so so bad!
From now on this story is up to date with wattpad and will therefore always be updated at the same time. This most of the time equals every 2 weeks but sometimes It’ll be faster. Today you’re lucky because I just got the next chapter ready! <3
Draco smiled. He knew exactly which one he wanted to talk about. And he remembered most of it since he had written it down.
The teacher gave him a nod. There was a weird silence in which Harry – for whatever reason - felt as if caught in the act. Maybe it was the stern look that Regulus was giving him. Wait, did he think Harry was skipping school? Shit, he should probably explain himself. Regulus would never report him, but he wasn’t above casually mentioning these things during family dinners and Harry did not want to repeat that. Ever.
. His personal safe house. Home. In a truly desperate moment a nice, brunette girl crossed his mind which made him groan out loud at his own pathetic behaviour. Never again would he talk to that Mudblood Hufflepuff. Langdorn could get lost if she thought otherwise. The basilisk page turned out to be useless. It just didn't really fit all that much and as he'd worked himself through all magical creatures books in their Manor library he had to wait until Hogwarts before he could resume his research. Still, when Draco was packing his things three days early because he didn't have anything better to do, he carefully put the by now creased piece of parchment between the first two pages of
"Where's Ron? He told me that you were staying with his family for the rest of summer. You'll have to tell me everything about what happened later, I'm really -RON!"
Suddenly the letter just ripped itself and tiny pieces of expensive and official looking paper sank to the floor. Harry felt at least as shocked as Malfoy looked like. When he found his voice again, Harry cleared his throat and asked:
They stood up and when they reached the doors of the great hall somebody called for Harry. He turned around to find Hermione and Ron catching up with them.
inside him boil and it was easily back on again. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath! It had to be like this. He was out of danger.
"Good Morning, Mr Malfoy. I'm very honored to have you here. Oh, and as I see you've brought young Mr Malfoy, too. It's a pleasure to meet you, young Sir!"
“Don’t give me that tone, Malfoy. I’ll always call someone to help me after trainings. You were just lucky enough to be the first one.”
“So, if you’re technically done with school for the day and you’re obviously not interested in studying or doing homework while you’re here, why don’t you go home or have a walk around the neighbourhood or something? The weather is nice today.” He said it like it was a genuine question and not like he was trying to get rid of him.
Padma Patil, his potions partner, was sitting huddled in a corner with Parvati, her twin from Gryffindor, and Lavender Brown, Parvati's best friend. As always they were gossiping and giggling about something. To their right there were Anthony, Terry and Michael, working on their assignments but throwing annoyed glances towards the girls group every now and then. Next to them there was a lost looking Gryffindor boy, Harry recognised him as the boy who had lost his toad on the train, Neville Longbottom. According to Ron, he lived with his Grandmother and wasn't a very skilled wizard even though he was a pureblood. There had also been a story about Neville being pushed out of a window by his own grandpa but Harry couldn't quite remember. About two meters further the other two Gryffindor boys were working on their assignment together but were also occasionally making small balls of parchment fly into Professor Sinistra's long curly hair (with a bit of wand work of course) where it looked like snow flakes in that deep black mane. To Harry's left the remaining Ravenclaw girls were working on their sheets pretty eagerly. They were Lisa Turpin, Su Li and Mandy Brocklehurst.
He eagerly changed his pajama top for the new clothing item and found that it fit perfectly. His smile grew even wider. Apart from his school robes he'd never had something fitting perfectly. Harry decided to wear that sweater as often as possible. And he had to show it to Hermione and Ron later.
"Are you crazy? What if he still realises that someone's been in there? And why should he leave an evidence for his attempts to get to the stone lying around in his office without any protections? It's not worth the risk! We should rather get more information on that hooded figure. We have to find out why anyone would be killing unicorns like this!"
Harry laughed and placed a small peck on Draco’s shoulder blade. Then his tone turned soft again. “Are you sure there wasn’t anything else this morning.”
Finally the bell rang and he sprinted all the way down to the great hall for lunch and headed straight for the Gryffindor table. When Ron and Hermione finally joined him he immediately started to tell them everything about Snapes leg. Hermione was the first to see the connection.
He considered telling the shop owner about it but something felt off with the whole thing. And his gut feeling turned out to be correct. When he was close enough he recognised the glasses. How could he not after having to look at them every single day of the previous school year? There were cracks in the lenses but these were unmistakingly Potter's.
“Woah, are you trying out for the Quidditch team, Harry? That's so cool! Can I take pictures of you flying?”
In fourth place, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two points; in third, Gryffindor, with three hundred and seventy-seven; Ravenclaw have three hundred and eighty-one and Slytherin four hundred and forty-two."
at your sorting. I expect you to behave perfectly in front of them and prove, that you still are worthy of the Malfoy name."
The two of them went on like that until they split up at the wing doors of the cafeteria. As usual, Ron would save them a table and Hermione and Harry would wait in line to get food.
Harry found himself searching the room with his eyes for... he didn't even know what he was looking for. Something just felt amiss. He spotted his roommates (apart from Malfoy, obviously) sitting at the Ravenclaw table, talking as if they had never stopped. Soon, Anthony looked into his direction and made a motion to the other two. Terry and Michael turned their heads and sure enough all three of them flashed him bright grins. Harry smiled back and gave a little wave before bringing his gaze back to his plate – which was still empty. How long did he just sit there without eating? Shaking his head, he helped himself to some scrambled eggs and bacon and tucked right in before going back to people watching. Draco Malfoy was actually
When he fell onto his bed in the evening he only just remembered to set an alarm before falling asleep in a matter of seconds. He had done all of these chores for years now but after a year long break it seemed his body and mind weren't used to this daily exhaustion anymore.
“Harry, not everyone has to like you,” Hermione said for the millionth time as she shut her locker door. The number of books she tried to keep steady in her arms would be unsettling to anyone who didn’t know her. They were heading to lunch and she had more books with her than she did in any lesson earlier that day. Harry was used to it by now.
He didn't know anything about trolls but he was pretty sure that screaming and running around madly would NOT help to solve this. Dumbledore raised his voice and asked them to calm down.
"Dobby can't help you answering this question, Sir. Dobby has to get back to the kitchen to prepare dinner, Sir."
When she entered the classroom, Draco was already seated in the front, it seemed like her eyes immediately found him. And – Merlin knows what made him do it – he stared right back, holding her gaze for an achingly long moment until her friend, the Abbott girl, pulled Langdorn along.
And then Dobby showed up, making everything worse. Well, at least now he knew that his friends remembered him! You always have to see the positive sides! Did you know how
A proud bird which's posture really reminded him of the noble Lucius Malfoy. Curious but still happy Draco took the envelope and broke the green wax seal. Slowly he unfolded the expensive parchment holding elegant words written in night black ink.
“See you tomorrow. Then I can start teaching you being nice. Sleep well. Oh and watch out for Nargles!”
Credit for the riddle goes to d.e.a.t.h.l.y_h.a.l.l.o.w.s  on Instagram! I asked them for permission to use them! Amazing person, go check them out, booklovers!
The rest of the lesson passed without special events of any kind, it was almost boring as they started off with a bunch of theory first.
Upon their arrival, they split up. Ron and Colin were heading for the stands, the former who said goodbye to him with a death-glare, whilst Harry joined the crowd of players in the middle of the pitch.
There was no holding back at the Gryffindor table anymore as the great hall was suddenly decorated with Gryffindor banners. Gryffindor had won the house cup. Disappointment could be read in all the faces at the Ravenclaw table. Still, they were all clapping out of respect. With two exceptions: Harry was clapping and cheering very enthusiastically, genuinely happy for his friends; the other was Draco Malfoy who was not clapping at all, looking at least as angry as his Slytherin friends.
"Godric, Hermione! You can't just set a baby dragon free in this area! The creatures in the woods would kill it faster than you can say one of those very complex and long words you love to use. And even if it would survive it will be very dangerous for everyone coming too close. We've got to think of something else."
“Yeah, I know.” Harry’s voice was warm and deep and Draco could feel his chest vibrate softly against his back. He made it very easy for Draco to open up to him.
“Why not?” Harry replied without skipping a beat. It was too late to back out now. And this time it seemed he had at least some of his wits together. “Why do you always have to insult me?”
"Michael got it for Christmas! It would also play wizard-radio but the connection doesn't get through the school wards."
"What if he got bitten by Fluffy as he tried to get past him when everybody was distracted by the troll?"
! A small bell rang to his right. Dinner was ready. Taking a last deep breath Draco left his room and went down a flight of stairs. When he arrived in the dining room his parents were already awaiting him.
When Harry returned, Draco was still in the cafeteria, the same position he had been sitting in half an hour ago. On his own. Neither Pansy, nor Blaise, nor any of Draco’s minions in sight. Something started thrumming beneath his skin at the prospect of having Draco to himself for the whole period.
he shouted. Ron took onto it very fast. He grabbed the biggest splinter of wood he could find and aimed at the troll's head as he threw it.
"I never did anything in Snape's classes that would justify him to take so many points from me, and you know that! Anyway, I wasn't punished for... taking the longer way."
Much love to everyone who has been patiently waiting for an update and generally to everyone who keeps supporting me <3
Harry didn't argue Ron even though he secretly was pretty much looking forward to being back at Hogwarts himself. He couldn't await trying out for the Quidditch team, nor could he await to finally use his wand again. He also missed his Ravenclaw friends, especially his roommates (Draco excluded. Maybe not after today? Ugh, this boy was confusing!) and Cho Chang.
At dinner Draco avoided looking over to the Gryffindor table with all might and concentrated hard on the conversation he was having with his friends, determined to not let his thoughts drift off.
Blaise on the other hand started greeting Harry with a polite smile and a nod every time they crossed paths.
They split up and each of them started searching another corner of the room for any hint that Snape was indeed after the Philosopher's Stone. Minute after minute went by and they weren't able to find anything. Soon Hermione started to get anxious.
Then this Clearwater prefect-girl lead the Ravenclaw first years to their rooms. They went up a lot of stairs and Draco tried not to look impressed by them moving around.
"Oh my god, what did they do to you. You look like they gave you amortentia! Merlin, hopefully they haven't. Come on, lie down a bit. Maybe that'll help."
Harry felt his heart starting to flutter and forced himself to turn away, to look back up towards the podium where a band had just started playing.
A few minutes later Madam Hooch blew her whistle and 14 teenagers soared into the air, seven in green, the other seven in red robes. Now it didn't take long to ban Potter from his mind. This was his passion!
And under this sink cowered the one and only Hermione Granger, trembling and in shock. She looked frightened to death when the troll raised a wooden bat in size of a small tree. Harry did the only thing that came to his mind.
After another ten minutes of silent walking there was a sudden noise to their right. Malfoy jumped and before Harry had registered it the last glimpse of white blonde hair had disappeared in the shadows of the nearby trees, the dog right behind.
they were the only ones who knew and all the teachers seemed to trust their collegue too much. When they had told Hagrid about their theory that Snape was after the Philosopher's stone, he completely overreacted and insisted that Snape would never do that, he had helped to guard it after all. But their research took longer than expected. Hermione was full on in study mode, panicking that every hour she didn't prepare for the examinations would be the one causing her to fail.
At one point they had to go down to find the train, of course, but that was not a big deal. When Ron wanted to drive on top of the railway, Harry interfered.
“... Dobby made sure that Harry couldn't return to school. I don't care for him but that idiot will get himself into trouble again, I just know it, and in this case he wouldn't survive it. I despise his ugly scarface-”,
This is the ending of year one. I struggled a lot to write Dumbledore‘s speech in a way that didn’t sound totally copied but also reflected his character so in the end I decided to just quote it from the original book. In this case I had no chance in doing it better than JKR did. So like, sorry for that? Feel free to comment your opinion on this first part of the book (PLEASE COMMENT I‘M DESPERATE FOR FEEDBACK) and yeah. Thanks for being here peeps!
“Thanks for that input, Granger. It was very enlightening. Now would you please take Potter with you, so Pansy and I can study in peace? This is a library after all.”
Molly didn't seem to have heard him, though. She just continued to brush white ashes off his robes. Mr Weasley meanwhile used this chance to cast
Draco's head snapped around to face a skinny, dark blond Hufflepuff boy, who was almost too tall to be seen as a second year. Zacharias Smith. Pureblood. But with a family that had a long, long line of Hufflepuffs, which was why Draco had never exchanged a word with him before. And why he hadn't planned on doing so.
Harry slowly glanced up at his two best friends. He was pretty sure “dumbfounded” was the perfect word to describe his current state. He blinked.
7:30 am. Way too early to be up and running on a Sunday. Draco frowned. Something about the wand in his hand felt weird. He took a closer look at it and just like that things fell back into place. With a tight throat he put back the wand and turned over.
At least until Aunt Petunia would knock on the door of his cupboard he could pretend to lie in a four poster with blue curtains inside a magical castle.
or reading, always while drinking hot chocolate or tea. His friends weren't around, the other Ravenclaws tolerated him but he didn't dare talking with them more than was necessary, he didn't want his father to dispise him even more. Apart from sending a thank you letter for the presents he hadn't been in contact with his parents; he had nothing he wanted to tell them and he didn't want to ruin their vacation without him. And of course he would never talk to Potter again. That idiot had gotten him into trouble with his stupidity. If his father would ever hear about this...
Draco had spent his evening with Crabbe and Goyle in the Slytherin common room. Maybe they were a bit stupid (
Harry froze. He searched for Draco’s eyes. The expression on his face seemed genuine. Was he actually showing emotion? Did he really just
And somehow he wasn't all that surprised when he arrived there and found none other than Harry Potter sitting on the exact same bed he'd had occupied throughout the previous year. Channeling all the annoyance and hatred he had in him he scoffed and said,
He had so much stuff planned out to annoy all the Gryffindorks and to make fun of others and now he hadn't even got a chance to pull these pranks with his friends because...
The day after his birthday Draco had started his research on the chamber of secrets. It took him a few days until he had found something and his mother was already getting suspicious as to why he spent more time in their library rather than flying on his new broom.
Doing homework with Draco and Pansy was nothing like doing homework with Draco and Blaise. It was like some sort of weird chemical reaction. Harry tried to think of a specific example, but he sucked at chemistry. Draco and Blaise acted like they were better than everyone by ignoring them or by dropping a snide though intelligent comment every now and then. Pansy acted like she was better than everyone by shouting it in their faces – and she pulled Draco along.
When he finally entered the first years' dormitory, he was surprised to see the others sitting around a radio set instead of reading or talking. Not so surprising was the fact that Malfoy was not around. He recognised the song. He'd heared it playing at some public places in the muggle world. Not that this was the kind of music Petunia or Vernon would listen to in their free time, mind you. Trying to start a decent conversation for once he immediately picked up on the topic.
He hated giving speeches. God, he hated it so much. It was probably the worst part of his far-from-glamorous job as the head-auror.
Everything was fine now. Dobby would keep Potter off the train, so that idiot was safe. And he'd be back at Hogwarts soon. Out of his father's eyes and
She was pretty good at Potions, Draco had to admit that, but she was way too nosy. The last time she'd asked him why he was
"I was 5. Mother brought him back to his senses and he never did it again. But what if he will now?! When he finds out I broke the rules... I shouldn't have been following Harry. I knew I shouldn't."
Yawning, Harry opened his eyes and sat up on his four-poster before pushing the curtains aside left-handed.
To find another connection between the stone and Snape, of course. She couldn't believe that all he was after was
As he would have to do this anyway, Harry took some toilet paper, let it soak in some water and went to his knees, cleaning up everything including the ugly leftovers in his bedroom. When he was finished he washed out his feet in the shower and wrapped them in toilet paper to prevent them from starting to bleed again. Then he put on two pairs of Vernon's old socks as cushioning and ate his soup which tasted very boring but he didn't expect anything else.
Ron frantically hit a silver button right where in another car there would've been a radio before pulling the sky blue Ford Anglia up into the clouds. Their journey went without huge struggles.
Not sure how to continue, Harry looked at him and they locked eyes. There were unspoken words of gratitude in the grey ones which were still wide and stirred up.
Then he had to make dinner - here he finally got an acceptable amount of food to himself - and do the dishes again.
He was just about to leave, when a shrill voice called out for him: “Oi, Potter! Don’t you wanna join us?”
and as he was in fact very interested in Dark Arts the Malfoy heir couldn't ever be more curious about a place. As his father's appointment at
“Oh, Hermione dear! It’s so good to see you!” Molly made her way across the small kitchen and gave the girl a warm hug. “You could prepare a salad if you want to. And tell Ronald to bring in some drinks from the garage.”
Draco shot a look towards the window and saw thick snowflakes dancing over the pale sky. Grinning even wider he turned back to Harry.
Draco cleared his throat before refocusing on his book. Harry finished pouring and then started drinking from one of the glasses. Once it was empty, he eyed the other one in fake contemplation.
Instead he found himself in the seventh floor again, after the lesson had ended, knocking on the wooden door across from the tapestry with some stupid dancing trolls. The door swung open soundlessly and Draco entered
They turned their heads and were faced with a young, handsome man, running towards them. He waved with a book. Harry's eyes went wide with shock when he recognised it as one of the books from Lockhart's collection. If the Muggle had seen the title... or even worse, the moving picture on the cover...
“Okay, we’ll fix that later. Seekers you'll start. Easy task: I'll let off one snitch, whoever catches it has the position. If you don't win, feel free to try out for something else.”
How dare that filth stare at him like that? He glared back at her with as much loathing as he could muster before turning his attention back towards Pansy's shrill voice and pointedly avoided looking at the Ravenclaw table for the rest of the meal. By then everyone had, of course, already heard of the crazy stunt Harry and Weaslebee had pulled. Draco had heard a lot of things in his life but two minors flying a charmed muggle vehicle to school – that really was a new one. When Pansy had first mentioned it at lunch, Draco's stomach had lurched in horror. If something had happened to H-
They kept talking about Quidditch and by the time they were send up to bed Harry had found out that Malfoy's favorite team were the
After that, in Draco's opinion, hilarious incident, Charms was over in a swish. As soon as the bell rang he was out of the classroom and rushing down towards the dungeons for potions. After all those weeks he was quite looking forward to brewing something again. He had always found it to be an exciting and likewise meditative praxis.
Slowly he made his way over to the cabinet, taking a look at some interesting objects but mostly faking his interest in them. His mind was completely focused on the weird reflections on the floor right in front of the small open slit of the cabinet door. Reflections such as the ones only produced by curved glass.
He did a final round of checks before he walked out and locked up the dog shelter. Out front Luna and Ginny were already sitting in their car, ready to take off. Automatically he slid into the back seat and ruffled his sister’s hair from behind.
His hands had destroyed his slicked back hair and were now hiding his pointy face. As Harry made a few steps towards him he could hear him whisper something over and over again.
This time more people had stayed behind, Michael and Cho for example. When Harry was in the Ravenclaw tower he would spent his time with them but most of the holidays he was with Hermione and Ron, wondering about what they should do next.
It was perfect. To his surprise she had managed to make his platinum blonde hair look exactly the way he was always wearing it. Not daring to give more of himself away to a muggle-born Hufflepuff, he gave her a grateful smile before facing away. She seemed to understand his intentions, though, because during  the following lesson when he almost ruined the potion due to his fatigue, she took over and finished the potion on her own with perfect precision. From then on it became kind of their thing: Whenever one of them was late or looked tired, the other would ask,
"Mister Potter insisted that he would go to Hogwarts either way but then I made his family angry and they locked him in his room and said that he would never have any contact to wizards ever again."
From that point on he put everything he had into speeding up. The broom was no longer a means to his ends. It became a part of him. His mind could reign over it as if it was physically connected to his muscles. He surpassed a boy who was probably in fourth or fifth year, then he surpassed Cho. He finished lap number six close behind a brunette girl. It took him one more whole round to get past her as well but she caught up to him again. He pulled the broom closer to his chest, lying completely flat on top of it. She mirrored him. For a moment it looked like she would fall behind again but no such luck. The two of them slowly came closer to another player. Harry spared him a small glance before looking ahead again. It was Malfoy.
It was lucky that he'd decided to go this way after Hedwig had settled in the owlery and that he saw the door to the forbidden corridor standing wide open. Malfoy didn't answer at once.
Draco wanted to talk to Lucius about getting a new broom for his birthday - which was the day after, by the way- because he wanted to enter the Quidditch team that year. Seemingly Malfoy senior was not available at the moment. Still his son pushed the door to his office open and immediately froze in his tracks. On the desk there was a dark, wooden box. It was open. And next to it was a diary like book with a black leather cover.
On Friday Hermione came by to give him his homework and to tell him what he’d missed at school. She didn’t say anything about Draco – not even a ‘told you so’ – even though Harry was sure she could guess that something had happened. She was clever like that.
gladly kept silent until it had worked and Draco was able to talk properly again. He thought about what to say and pointedly avoided anything that included Harry's name or that was as direct as: “there will be deaths this year.” Instead he opted for a sentence that he thought summed up the present situation pretty well:
A woman's voice interrupted the rage but it didn't last for more than a second and the cold, emotionless voice carried on.
Then his gaze wandered over to the other bed. He gasped, seeing Harry Potter lying still under white sheets, a bandage was slung around his head. Draco's heart rate picked up a bit as he slowly walked closer. When he saw Harry's chest moving up and down he let out the breath he'd been holding. He was alive.
. He sat through breakfast, eating not that much, and hurriedly finished the dishes so he could leave to his room for a moment before the Dursleys put a bunch of chores under his responsibility.
So, while he told himself that he was glaring at his childhood rival he was actually more drinking in the way the dress was falling around Draco’s form silkily all the way down to his ankles, bringing out his best angles and exposing his right shoulder. In the same silver as the dress, he was wearing elegant high heels.
A lump was sitting high in his throat at the prospect of maybe never being able to return to the wizarding world ever again. The only place he'd ever felt welcomed and at home. He was terrified and sat still like a statue while his least favorite professor was scolding them.
On Monday Harry was reluctant to go to the library. Ron dragged him all the way there, accepting the fact that he would be late for class because of it.
But it was to late. Marietta had already cast the spell and everything inside Harry started to feel all fuzzy. He wanted to glare at her but realised he couldn't take his eyes off Cho. She was just so...
The days were still too long to be able to see the stars at this time of the day so they were still stuck with the theory-bullshit.
With these words he ran downstairs and right through the door out of the common room. He ran and ran until he couldn't feel his feet anymore, hoping everything would fall behind like the stairs and doors and hallways he passed.
. At some point they would have to talk about everything or it would get way too hard to carry on like they did before. Maybe the week of Easter holidays would bring something new.
Harry tried to make up an excuse, but Draco was so damn close and he smelled so nice and Harry’s brain just short-circuited. Without another word, he took one of Draco’s hands and strode towards the exit of the room.
After he was done with the assignment, Draco pushed his schoolwork aside and leaned forward a little. At this point Harry was not yet done processing.
Wow. That had been impressive. The few times Harry had sat on a broom yet had been pretty nice, too, but the Quidditch players on the pitch were just amazing. Wood, the Gryffindor keeper, had made a lot of stunning movements to stop or catch the Quaffle. Before the Slytherin captain had pulled that unfair move, of course. And it looked so impressive how the twins had flown from side to side and hit the Bludgers with every attempt, shooting them towards a Slytherin. Now Harry could understand why Ron was so fascinated by the sport. On the way back to the castle they spotted a huge furr coat in front of them and the letter came to his mind again.
So they began to gather all their things while people around them went back to their own business, hopping on and off trains. Then they pushed their carts towards the exit, desperate to get away from all those Muggles.
“I really need another drink. Come on, Luna. Let’s head over to the bar. It was very nice seeing you, Harry!”
As mentioned, there would be a huge feast for dinner which Harry was getting ready for at the moment.
Well, it wasn't a lie. They didn't really talk. But neither could he say that he still hated Ha-Potter. Actually he never hated him but he would never admit that, not even to himself! Draco looked over to the opposite side of the pitch and eventually spotted the raven-haired boy. Though it was quite chilly outside he suddenly felt himself warm up at the sight. Strange feeling...
The adressed boy ignored him. Maybe this was childish but his mother was right. His birthday meant something to Draco and his father decided that selling some stuff had been more important, not even talking about how he wouldn't even be apologising if it wasn't for his mother.
Well, this was maybe his only chance to find out. As Draco went straight towards the desk he spotted an already opened letter lying next to the book. He  scanned it with his eyes fast without picking it up in order to avoid making Lucius suspicious. The contents made him gulp. It was from a shop owner in Knockturn Alley. Obviously a reply to a former letter sent by his father. It said something about how he would accept the
Draco stepped closer himself now and before Harry had processed what was happening, he was pressed against a wall.
Confused, he pushed the door open and found his three roommates crouched over something on Corner's bed. It seemed they hadn't even heard him entering the dorm.
Ron pressed against the barrier with his right shoulder, testing it. It didn't move a bit. “I don't know, mate. This is bloody scary!”
As the black haired boy turned his head and laid his bespectacled, shining green eyes on him he felt blood shooting into his head, especially his cheeks - in anger of course! When Draco rapidly turned his head down a fuzzy feeling was left behind and he sensed something squirming in his stomach. Maybe he was just getting sick. Similar things had happened a lot recently. Maybe Potter had hexed him. Or slipped him a potion. He should probably go and see Madam Pomfrey about it.
He hadn't. And he didn't give a damn who that guy was anyway. When Severus limped towards them she got silent until he'd passed them and carried on with checking on the others' potions.
The Weasleys were the nicest and most wonderful people Harry had ever met. They all welcomed him wholeheartedly in their midst and made him feel like he was one of their own children. Molly made the best food - except Hogwarts food maybe -, Arthur asked the strangest questions about simple Muggle things but always seemed genuinely interested in what Harry told him and Ginny always acted a bit weird and shy around him but was also super nice and that fierce little girl was definitely not afraid to stand up to her older brothers. Ron claimed she had a crush on him but Harry didn't believe him.
When Narcissa answered she wasn't shouting anymore but she sounded at least twice as dangerous as before.
Then she threw Draco a glance that was surely supposed to mean something, but Harry had never been the best at reading other people. In a matter of seconds Harry was alone with Draco.
at least three times. He could only hope today was bound to be better. When he arrived in front of the classroom door, she was already waiting.
He finished the lawn by midday and right after "lunch" (a plain slice of bread) he was told to clean the kitchen - including scrubbing the floor by hand.
"Well as long as you're not losing points on purpose and try your best to get them back in the other subjects, I see no point in not trying to get to know you."
With a snap the house elf finally disapparated, leaving Draco to himself. It wouldn't take much now to get him to break every promise he made to
Harry smiled sadly at their merry faces. It was nice having something from their past but it also hurt a lot.
When he... she... When the room knew his name, then it surely would also know why he'd entered it in the first place.
Of course this girl knew for sure that he was. She just tried to be polite. Harry gave a  her short nod.
Professor Sinistra glared at them and made a shushing noise. In order not to lose her house points again Hermione stopped talking and instead pulled Harry and Ron's works towards her to finish them as well. Now bored, Harry let his gaze wander over the rest of his classmates.
Harry was so glad that they hadn't been expelled that he didn't take their punishment too bad. Just detention. And they had missed the sorting and weren't allowed to go up to the feast. But nothing could get Harry's spirits down. He'd already seen himself locked up in his bedroom at the Dursley's again or disqualified for the Quidditch tryouts. In his opinion they had gotten away pretty well off. And thanks to his own argument that the school year hadn't even started at the time, there weren't even any house points taken. Although Dumbledore’s disappointed expression had really stung. At that moment Harry decided he would be the perfect student this year and stay out of any kind of trouble. He didn't want to see that look ever again. Naturally, he'd been the first one to be up in the Ravenclaw tower and therefore was to solve the riddle on his own. He struggled for a second but soon he came up with something and was let inside the walls of heaven on earth.
Seemed like he had to take it very slow at first. He waited with the next attempt until dessert. In the meantime he thought about what he could say without offending the silent boy.
Eventually Harry managed to open his mouth. “I’ll see you tomorrow then. Or Thursday at the latest.”
On his way to the vending machine Harry thought about whether that conversation had been progress or a set-back. He eventually settled for progress. For no particular reason apart from the fact that he wanted to have made progress.
"You try and convince him then, 'Mione! You've already read through the whole library twice and couldn't find any new connections anyways."
Draco was shaking like a leaf but this time he wasn't crying. He was sick of tears. He was not weak. And he made a silent vow to himself to never cry again.
“You know, I would offer to teach you how to do it properly, but my rates are probably too high for you. Judging by your clothes at least. Everything from before last season. And you don’t even know how to combine pieces properly.” She faked a shudder, a wide, nasty grin on her face.
Harry smiled. He really liked the gesture of getting something selfmade but he definitely wouldn't risk to try those sweets if his life depended on it. He'd already made bad experiences with Hagrids cooking skills.
It was a disappointment to see that Harry calling him by that name failed to turn the tips of Draco’s ears red at this point. Instead, Draco simply sighed at the interruption and looked up. Okay maybe that was better than seeing him get embarrassed. Harry was proud of the progress he’d made.
. He had an idea. It was an absolute waste of good quality, but it would work for now. He could still re-sell the brooms later but for now the aim was to put them somewhere where no one, especially not Graves, would find them.
"I always get that fuzzy feeling, my face gets very hot and there's something in my stomach. I'm pretty sure it was Potter. It mostly happens around him."
Seeing the darkness in the common room it still must be  nighttime or sometime before dawn. Even though his thoughts were still pretty occupied with what had just happened, he paid attention on his way to the seventh floor. He couldn't be caught out after curfew twice in the same night. He took the silver-grey ring in his left hand and let it fall against the light brown wood of the door. At the collision it opened soundlessly. On the couch table a mug of steaming hot chocolate was awaiting him. He sat down and drank it in silence. Then he placed it back to where it had stood and it vanished.
. Draco hadn't been able to believe his luck when Lucius had mentioned this at breakfast and told him the two of them would be attending to their respective businesses together. His mother had always prohibited going to
Late at night Harry was still lying awake, his brain not letting him sleep, no matter how exhausted he was.
But it was annoying nonetheless and knowing that his father owned objects that he had to sell because they could get them into big trouble with the ministry – It was unsettling. Some days he told himself that he shouldn't be judging his own father's actions, but he cared too much not to. Draco was first in their usual carriage. Sitting down in a seat by the window, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Draco sighed and shook his head. “You are a hopeless case. Just shut up and let me tell you about that dream, alright?”
And both of them sprinted out the dorm and all the way down towards the Entrance hall. All their sorrows were completely forgotten for the moment. And so were the remaining presents.
He raised his glass to each of them, ending with Draco. He almost choked when he looked up at him. He hadn’t counted on him being so damn tall in those heels. And he had been even less prepared for sparkling eyeshadow and rich purple lipstick. Draco smirked. That guy knew exactly what he was doing to Harry!
As soon as he realised his mistake, he turned his head away but Harry seemingly hadn't noticed the use of his first name. He was probably too distracted by the fact that his body was gone.
Before his brain could catch up to what he was actually doing he was standing next to the only other occupied bed in this dorm, two of his own small parcels in his hand and placing them next to Harry's. The small boy stirred in his sleep and Draco got back onto his own bed as fast as somehow possible. When he glanced back and found Harry still sleeping he let out the breath he'd been holding and turned his attention back on his own gifts.
Ron gave him a glance as if he had just seen a giant spider with too many eyes. And maybe that expression was justified because at that same moment Hermione's judging glare found his eyes and her silent scolding was almost as effective as Professor McGonagall's, leaving Harry mumbling a sheepish apology.
Draco jumped to his feet and almost ran Harry over in his hurry to get to the bathroom. Harry slowed him down and wrapped his arms around him to get him to calm down.
A voice in the back of his head wanted to scream back at her that it hadn't been a game of sorts and that
The rest of the holidays were confusing. Most of the time he spent with the Weasleys and Hermione and they had lots of fun. They even sneaked him into the Gryffindor common room a few times. Malfoy kept ignoring him, no matter how often Harry tried to start a conversation. It seemed the Christmas morning had never happened. Like they hadn't had their greatest fun in months playing in the snow together. Like Malfoy had never given him two of his presents. Yeah, that had been pretty obvious. The wrapping had been the same as on the pureblood's presents and Harry didn't know anyone else who would give him something like that. He wondered where Malfoy went all the time. During the day he often disappeared and all the times Harry attempted to find him, he was nowhere to be seen. Not in the grounds, neither in the yard, nor in the library - Hermione could confirm this. She had been spending a great deal of time in there, searching for information on Nicolas Flamel. There was nothing to be found as it seemed. She even urged Harry to enter the restricted section with his invisibility cloak. He had tried but he only managed to escape Filch with a lot of luck and he didn't want to risk another detention too soon.
Draco hummed in content and snuggled a little closer into Harry’s chest. “I did have a dream tonight, though. A good one.”
He didn't ask it though. He didn't dare to remind the other boy of that night, it must've had awoken bad memories or so he guessed from the nightmare his roommate had had afterwards.
Again Draco had lost control over his image. And again it had been Potter's fault. Why was it that those things always happened around
A year ago, after about the third time that Draco had fixed him back up, he’d been able to brush this off as a stupid crush on a very attractive guy. Now it was clearly more than that and it definitely didn’t seem to go away anytime soon. And he was running out of reasons not to ask Draco out.
Keeping this sincere smile on his lips he pushed the window close again and decided to bring Hedwig up to the owlery himself.
The bespectacled boy tore his eyes away when Ron adressed him and suddenly focused on his food, feeling kind of uncomfortable. The question he just answered with a short shrug. Hermione seemed to notice his strange behaviour.
Draco didn’t acknowledge Harry’s presence at all as he sat down next to him, voicing a greeting. He scanned the other boy’s face for any reaction. Any emotion.
Her gaze snapped up to him and he spotted something like fear in her pale blue eyes, but it seemed to ease away a bit at the sight of him.
Luckily yesterday's detention story hadn't spread amongst the students yet and Draco had hopes that it would stay like this. He and his father had always been close and Lucius relied on him. He didn't want to disappoint him any more than he'd already had. Around two hours into the journey they bought a few pumpkin pastries for lunch. They were quite good but nothing against what Dobby would create for him this evening. Maybe he would even get his favorite meal tonight.
The blonde gaped at him and seemed to have totally forgotten about the expensive potions set laying half unwrapped in front of him.
As soon as these words had reached Harry’s ears, his body took over for him. He had no idea what exactly his body was doing, he only knew that Draco’s lips felt amazing on his and that this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
He didn't return the wishes but just took off the robes before joining his father at the door. Then they left for the bookshop where Lucius once again left him in order to buy some quills on the other side of the Alley. Draco wanted to look for a new quill himself after he'd picked up the books but he wasn't prepared for the sheer amount of people waiting at the counter. It was horrible and nothing seemed to be moving. When he saw the sign explaining what was going on he rolled his eyes and went upstairs. This could take ages so he might as well just use the time to do some further research on creatures that could possibly be the inhabitant of the chamber of secrets. In the course of the past three weeks he had narrowed it down to creatures with these attributes:
Draco smirked at him as he surpassed them in full Quidditch gear and with a sleek black-silver broom resting on his right shoulder. Harry was suddenly very aware of the fact that he was wearing an oversized jumper and sweatpants, passed down from his lovely cousin Dudley. Was proper Quidditch gear obligatory for the tryouts?
Doing homework in the library in almost total silence was a far stretch from what Harry would describe as fun and it definitely wasn’t more fun than teasing Draco into smiling or laughing (his lower eyelids – were they called that? – would rise up, turning his irises into tiny suns setting behind equally tiny hills) but he’d prefer it over being harassed by Snape any day.
One side of him wanted to forgive his father, his big idol. After all he'd said sorry - even though Malfoys usually didn't do that - and, as his father had said, he was
Draco walked through the door which the other boy had left open in his hurry and entered the almost deserted common room. He received a few glares for being out that late and risking their well earned house points but he just ignored them and made his way up to their dorm.
When they arrived at Platform 9 ¾  Draco hurriedly said his goodbyes to his parents and disappeared into the crowd. During the summer he had become more and more uneasy around his father. The man that he looked up to had most definitely changed a lot. Lucius almost never left his study and when he did he was either “getting business done” or complaining that he was wasting his time not doing exactly that. Of course Draco understood that his father’s business was important.
"What do you think you are doing?! Do you know how long it takes to clean the floor off your muddy footprints. In my office! Both of you!"
“I know, right? So, you free Sirius and want to go, but I beg you to take me with you. And I end up convincing you to run away with me. As soon as we leave Azkaban Sirius somehow disappears and we are alone. We arrive in some sort of city and walk across a marketplace. I try to get you to hold my hand. And yeah, that’s it.”
Next he opened one of the bigger parcels. In the red wrapping he found a note and a sweater. The sweater was red and beared a big 'H' on the front. The note said that it was a Christmas sweater from Mrs. Weasley.
Proud that he had figured that thing out on his own Draco pushed it open and entered what looked like a living room to him. It was slightly smaller than a classroom and contained a fireplace, a purple couch and a desk. Floor and walls were wooden and right across from him there was a huge window, which didn't show the snowy grounds as expected, but an amazing view of the ocean and the beach, though he knew those had to be hundreds of miles away. A purple carpet and bookshelves made the room look even cozier and completed the image.
Draco was awakened from his stupor by the sound of footsteps approaching the corridor. He closed his gaping mouth and levitated the bundle of brooms into the room in a hurry and as soon as that was done the door fell shut behind him on its own. Draco examined the various hallways of clutter in full concentration in order to remember where he came from. There weren’t many places he could hide the brooms efficiently. Every good spot seemed to be taken already and as hard as it was to find this room in the first place, a lot of people seemed to have done it in the past and he didn’t want to risk anything.
"You're done, Mr Malfoy! Shall I send the bill together with the robes to your father as soon as they are finished?"
Speaking of them, Ron's present had been a package of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans and two chocolate frogs. Hermione had - who would have thought that? - sent him a book.
Harry stood up and left the hall with his fellow Ravenclaws. Out of nowhere there was a hand clasping his wrist and dragging him away.
The most amazing thing, though, was the fact that he finally got to fly on a broom again. Quidditch with Ron and the twins was the best thing ever and he couldn't wait for the school team try outs this September. He just wasn't sure about the position he wanted to play, yet. Keeper definitely wasn't his thing but he loved being seeker and beater equally. And his father had been a chaser so that would be amazing, too. Nevertheless, his decision could wait until his return to school. Now he just wanted to enjoy the time he had with the Weasleys. At the moment he was getting ready to leave the burrow- that's what they had called their house - for Diagon Alley in order to buy various school supplies that were required. Soon all of them were gathered around the fireplace, even though Harry wasn't sure as to why exactly
“That’s actually a good question. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just used to going home with them. We usually spend the afternoon together anyways. It just kind of makes sense to me.”
Malfoy looked up in surprise. He didn't answer immediately. When he nodded eventually it filled Harry with joy. Okay, he already achieved something. Now he had to keep talking before the other one closed up again.
When the blonde sat down at the Slytherin table next to Blaise for breakfast, a black barn owl was waiting for him with a letter. It was his fathers owl, Atticus.
“Okay I didn’t mean to get so depressing. My point was: all of those dreams were weird as it gets. I mean, you and I were always there and I always tried to get you to show me affection of any kind but all the stuff happening around that was just… super weird and totally out of context. I don’t know, that’s probably how dreams are supposed to be when they’re not nightmares.”
He looked over at the Slytherin table. Malfoy seemed happier with his friends around him again. Well at least he talked to
he stilll couldn't get his mind off of what had just happened. This, in fact, distracted him so much, it took him way too long to realise that Hermione Granger was standing right in front of him, greeting him cheerfully. As soon as he caught on, though, he immediately flashed her a smile.
And there was it, the great difference between Draco and Pansy: Pansy had no respect for authority figures whatsoever. She either did everything to get on their good side with whatever means she had, or she treated them like a dictator would peasants. Harry had no struggles imagining her with a bloody crown on her sleek black hair.
"What the hell were you thinking? Or did you even think at all? You're a bloody Ravenclaw, you're supposed to be intelligent enough to not enter a corridor, which, I quote, 'we should not enter if we don't want to die a very painful death'!"
Draco jumped to his feet and his eyes scanned the room anxiously, trying to make out the source of the voice.
Inhaling deeply for a last time, he opened his eyes and put on the mask. His friends should arrive at any moment now.
The cheers exploding around Harry were so loud, he believed his ear-drums were bursting. Who was able to do basic Math -and every Ravenclaw certainly was- knew that Ravenclaw was now placed in first, while Gryffindor was in second place with only four points less. The faces at the Slytherin table looked dangerously angry; they now had no chance left to win the house cup this year. But Dumbledore wasn't finished.
After a while, he dared to pull Draco a little closer. He tried to make it seem like he wasn’t doing it on purpose, but Draco immediately caught onto it. He raised an eyebrow and let his smile grow a little wider, his teeth were sticking out against the deep colour of his lips. The next thing he knew, Draco’s arms were circled around his neck. Harry abruptly stopped dancing. His brain couldn’t process all those sensations at once
Concerned, he waved his gaze over all the students all day long but the blonde didn't show up. Nowhere. Not once.
She turned back to the dissolving crowd. Apparently there was really no one who wanted to be beater.
While he was hearing three boys snoring from the other side of the room, the bed to his left was empty. A short look on uncle Vernon's old watch told him it was not time for breakfast, yet.
Draco loved spending time with his mom on his own but he really wanted his dad to be here. He didn't treat him like a little child like she did. And Draco had heard Blaise talk about how all his grandparents and uncles and aunts were coming for christmas and his birthday. Draco knew his grandparents were all dead except his mother's mother but she was at St. Mungo's and didn't remember anyone who ever visited her. His father had been an only child and his mother's sisters... well, she didn't like to talk about them but he still knew that the oldest one, Bellatrix, was in Azkaban.
Draco wanted to scream at her to just take them but eventually settled for a tight smile and a short “Of course, Ma’am.” Before he left.
"Ronald, don't even finish that sentence! I think it's best to sleep over all of it! Good night, Harry!"
would hardly be anywhere close to quick but he also had a gut feeling that he really ought to get to his dorm.
He had looked at it every night possible and knew the position of every single star within the dragon by heart. He could easily sketch it onto the parchment in the last five minutes if necessary. Yeah, he had loved the stars. He still did. But he hated the theory stuff. And it reminded him of his family and he hated to think about them at the moment. He hated to remember that they didn't want him home anymore. So he had left his assignment unattended and somehow his eyes had automatically landed on H-
“It was one of the ghosts. The orange-y one. I told him he looked funny because I like funny things, but he didn't like that and he swooped right through me.”
A cold and sturdy hand grabbed his own, keeping him in place. Harry looked down at it. The brown of his skin seemed particularly dark with the contrast of Draco’s pale one right on top of it. When Harry inhaled it was all shaky and fragile and that was when he realized that he should’ve listened to Hermione. Because he definitely had a crush. On Draco fucking Malfoy- Jesus Christ, he needed to get out of there.
