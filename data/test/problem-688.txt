"I know. I'm sorry" He mumbled against Harry's greasy brown hair. "I know you can think of something" He encouraged him.
"We already have" Ron glared, before they too realize most of the students in the hall were watching the drama unfold.
He moved his feet closer to his chest to give room for his two friends. "You look... content," Blaise commented. He did, though. He was sitting down with a cup of tea and Harry's quilt that Molly knitted for him as a Christmas present. He looked like a depressed Tumblr girl.
He saw a group of Slytherins cackling like hyenas in front of Hermione. Draco stood a bit far away, observing before he says something dumb that will not help, at all. "You have no proof that we put Harry's name in the goblet" A Slytherin crossed her arm, almost challenging her.
Guess what he wishes for. He wished he had his camera with him so he can capture this and hang it in his closet. To remember the time he decided to step in and lock himself there with Harry being the secret keeper. "What are you doing over there? Still thinking what you're gonna do with your life when I'm dead?"
Draco shook his head. "No, I haven't. Astoria has also been pining me all year — based on what Pansy told me. I think she's just waiting until I finally ask her out"
"To see Harry?" Ron shrugged with a sly smile, attempting to poke fun of his best mate.
"Right. Sorry, Harry" Hermione said which made Ron furrow his brows.
"I can't believe you two went smoking without me," Draco told them, not as offended as he made it sound. Harry furrowed and turned to him, "You smoke?"
Like a wise Victoria Justice once said, I think we ALL are proud of Draco Malfoy.
In which they didn't, he just wanted to invite his lovelies over too.
"Professor," A Ravenclaw started. McGonagall turned to her. She continued, "Aren't you gonna give them detention?"
Draco stayed quiet throughout but agreed eventually. It's probably the adrenaline rush and eagerness to prove something to Potter. So, he suggested, "Your choice"
"To be fair, there aren't exactly other secret places to hide in. We've actually used every hidden place in this castle"
btw, posting this on Hermione's birthday. Happy birthday, baby!
"Sir." He croaked
"At what?"
"So, what are you waiting for?" McGonagall whispered to the man beside him as the two crept from behind the old ancient door. Snape furrowed and turned his hair filled head to her. "Are you encouraging him to kill Malfoy?"
said.
"No blackmail. Just need a little bit convincing" Harry gave a teasing smile at Hermione. "She's a really great convincer. It's in her eyes." Ron pointed at them before a blushing Hermione swatted them away. "And that lip twitch she makes" Harry added with a chuckle. She rolled her eyes with a smile, "Can we not?"
"So I figured you guys knew about it?" Harry asked, now with breath steadied back to normal. Both nodded. "We had a feeling you are," he paused, "Gay. So once Hermione and I thought that maybe you might be into guys, she went searching on how best to support gay friends"
"For fuck sake!" Pansy groaned. All was going so well.
"I think I have a solution to your problem," He smiled. He pulled out a little box from his pocket and handing it to Draco. The latter furrowed but took it anyway. "What is it?"
Draco laughed. "I honestly don't know why I wanted so badly to grab your attention. Even if you hate me afterwards"
Draco can't help the smirk forming on his face as his friends go
"Which is a dumb idea because then he'd be crying and talking about you even more," Lucius said, sipping his tea. Harry laughed with Narcissa as the boy's cheeks redden in embarrassment.
Harry paused before he smiled warily, "Yes. Yes, you are. This is all just a dream" He moved his hands across his face like he's some sort of psychic from his dreams. Draco shook his head and walked up to him, snapping Neville's face back up. "If you dare speak a word of this to anyone—"
"Last year! Before summer break. There! Happy?!" Draco exclaimed after a sigh.
Hermione snapped, "Oh no"
"What is he doing here?"
Draco Malfoy reporting my current state in quarantine.
"Draco" he breathed heavily in surprise, especially after being man-handled like that. Back pushed to the wall with faces inches closer. So gay. "It's not your time to turn me on, Potter." He whispered, rather hotly actually.
"I see why the Raven girl broke up with you. Bit of a shame, isn't it?" The blond crossed his arm, trying to come off as rather superior. Yet only managed to make Harry find him a lot more attractive.
It was weeks after scene two when they were in Hagrid's hut. They continued the days like normal. Draco hangs out with his friends, Harry hangs out with his. And at the end of the day, they would sneak out and spend the rest of the day with each other. Talking about what they did, which mostly started with Draco apologizing over and over again about what
"Your bullshit that I have to deal with all day," She said, snatching it back.
"Wait, I wanna see"
"What are you? His girlfriend?" Another said before the group laughed. "Hey, hey, hey. That's enough!" Draco quickly—and finally—stepped in.
thing. "What the fuck?!" Draco pushed Harry's shoulder lightly. See, now he's not gay. Harry was surprised at first but quickly got the memo. His soft worried look for Draco's well-being quickly changed into this annoyed look. "Hey! I just saved your ass!"
"You were never subtle, Draco Malfoy," Pansy said with a teasing smile. Which, come to think of it, he was pretty dumb for shit-talking him
"Can't we just Wingardium Laviosa ourselves to the top?" Pansy added to the question. Hermione hummed. "Yeah, no. Logically, you'd just fall face forward and ruin your nose"
"It's your mother" Voldemort admitted, sipping his butterbeer. Making him snape his neck again. There's a lot of snapeing happening here.
Draco laughed, "Calm down, hedgehog." He sat down next to him, wrapping his arm around his neck. Harry held his wrapped hand and smiled softly, scooting closer into his arms. "I hate this. I didn't sign up for this. Literally."
. It's not exactly the same suit. But it compliments each other.
Unfortunately for him, this is not much of a celebration.
Hermione reached for his hand, "It's okay. You can tell us anything"
"So, you're with Draco now?" Dean asked as he sat down across Harry in the Gryffindor table. Harry just woke up and took his seat beside his redheaded best friend. The great hall was emptier than usual, even if it was a bit late in the day.
Draco was helping a lot with this tournament—so did Ron and Hermione. They help read books for his task and shit like that. Harry also had no idea why he went to Cedric and told him about the task. What? He's a hot senior in need of help. Harry's gay ass is wheezing.
Hermione smiled widely, pulling his knees up to her chest. Leaving her notes forgotten and scattered on the table, not bothering to fuck with it anymore. Drarry love story >> homework, said Hermione. "That's okay. We have all the time in the world"
"No, you shut up, Malfoy" Pansy smacked his arm playfully. "You're one of the reasons why the Slytherin is evil propaganda is still alive until today. When really, we are just psychologically fucked up kids with rich strict parents" Pansy smiled at the Gryffindors.
"......no" She's bloody right at everything, you know. Hermione chuckled softly, "He'll be fine. Just go to bed, tomorrow will be a long day — especially for you"
"Listen to that, Potter? She's talking about you" Ron turned to Harry who was also gleaming with laughter. "Of course, she is" Harry scoffed sarcastically.
"Yes, in a weird way." Dumbledore nodded and smiled teasingly at Harry and Draco, making sure Snape can see his facial expression. "He's not really... a master at flirting. Unlike you two, per se"
"I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right." Dumbledore nodded, "It is unprofessional. Our deepest apologies—" Then Daddy Voldemort walked in.
Draco smirked, "50 galleons to prove you wrong?"
Harry furrowed. "Who?"
Harry smiled thankfully while Luna smiled softly, "Yeah... But wouldn't it be cute though if they were together?"
"Oh, thank goodness." Voldemort sighed in relief. He's the first person (or monster) who knew about them together. He honestly doesn't mind—especially the making out part. He thinks it's humanly for well, humans, to have a good intimate conversation that doesn't involve a lot of talking. He treasures that ritual and pitied them for not having a place to do so. So, he lets them during detention. It's honestly as productive as helping house elves with the dishes or organizing the books in the library, isn't it?
"Good one, Dumblewhore!" Voldemort cackled, high fiving the headmaster.
"Oh, yeah. About that. I haven't actually told them we were together"
Great, at least he can run to his mother if anything bad happens. "Oh, that's great"
Ron gasped at the accusation. "No, I don't!" Harry chuckled at his mate's reaction. "I just thought — we slept together!" Ron pointed at Harry and him. "In the same bed! I just thought he maybe, somehow, you ever had—"
Either way, they were shook.
sorry shorty.
Everyone quickly ran as fast as they can—also as quiet as they can—inside the closet. "Again?!" Harry had the time to comment while running inside. Draco snorted. "Me." They chuckled as Pansy locked the closet doors with a charm spell she remembered from class. Ron and Blaise stood up with head ducking down a bit so they don't bump the shelf inside the closet. While the rest scrunched themselves into tiny balls. Harry being the smallest, was the easiest to squeeze in.
"So... It's Thursday." Hermione started, "Have you asked anyone to the dance?"
Harry bit his lower lip before rolling his eyes. He sat down as further away from Draco as possible. Not really. He chose the same row, just both very far away. Like a table far. You know, so you're not gay. "Nice to see you too, Malfoy" He greeted with a mild taste of sarcasm.
Fuck. Now that hits home. For me and for Draco. If only my father actually says that bullshit to my face, maybe life wouldn't be a complete arse all the time.
dreams. "What are you two prats doing here?"
"I agree." Ron nodded as if he just got blessed by a priest's sermon. "But now that we know you are gay, be honest with me," He looked at his friend dead in the eye. Harry chuckled, "Okay?"
"They must be"
"Of course not!" He mirrored his expression. "I respect you too much to just bluntly out us," Harry told. Draco nodded. He knew that. He's equally as scared as Harry. This isn't exactly how they want their coming out story to be like. Being pushed by people who are conspiring over their supposed relationship.
stared, trying out figure what the fuck is going on. "Sure." Dumbledore nodded.
"I guess I owe you two an explanation" Draco cut to the chase.
"And end up look like Voldemort" Ron chimed as well. Draco laughed, "It's a bit too late for Potter, isn't it?"
Draco hummed.
," Snape said, before following him out. Having no exact idea of what's going to happen. Title of his sex tape.
"No, I meant like," Harry looked down, "You're getting punished for something you didn't do. Why?"
Harry shot his head up. "Why are you saying his name?"
Snape heard the commotion from his office not so far from the common room and went to check it out. "What the hell's going on here?" In his deep southern Californian accent.
"Only the greatest witch singer of all time!" Ron exclaimed. Harry doesn't know who she is either. "She's famous?"
Draco looked back up and smiled softly, before finally nodding. "Of course, I am. You're right. It's about damn time I walk out there like the gorgeous bitch I am"
Jesus Christ, Harry.
in your eyes for a second there.
"He is a fucking homophobic asshole who doesn't have a fucking life!" He pointed to the ground. His jaw clenched as his soft green emerald dusky eyes turned into a fucking rainstorm—or just a storm in general.
Speaking of something weird,
The four walked to Snape's office. Narcissa smiled widely when she saw her favourite son entering the room. "Draco.." She smiled, pulling him into a hug.
Draco, on the other hand, decided to take it the Slytherin way. "No!" Was Pansy's third answer in the last 5 minutes. Draco's convincing Pansy to go on a date with him, despite it being one of Pansy's way to push Draco to ask Harry out. "I'll pay you 50 galleons, plus you'll get free food" Draco continued trying. "Come on! It'll just be our usual hangout. We can talk about your crush on Granger again..."
last night, Draco flew back to his room and handed him a little box from his mother, wrapped especially for him. Harry untied the little green ribbon on the box and awed at the revealed beautiful suit. It came with a handwritten note.
Ron nodded and cleared his throat. "Thank you"
"Nothing ever will" Harry smiled sheepishly. "What I meant to ask is if my crush would want to go out on a date with me?"
"Yeah, Potter! Not everything revolves around you"
"So, what're we gonna do?"
Have you actually tried asking your crush out?
Harry stepped back, putting his hand up in surrender. Draco rolled his eyes fondly and reminded them, "We have bigger fish to fry" Pointing at the window. Ron turned and quickly calculated his way up the two-story building. He quickly hopped on top of a metal bin and climbed up the roof, stepping and grabbing on bricks and stones. Hermione is shook. Just saying. Harry and Blaise quickly followed behind him—kinda reminding Blaise of the time they snuck out of the Malfoy Manor a few years ago when Voldemort was still the dArK lOrD.
Draco laughed, "What do you want them to do? Run around the hallway freaking out?"
"It's just—my friends. They.. dislike you, in a way" Draco said carefully, stuttering his few words as he goes. Harry already knew that. They blame Harry for the shit that's happening to their family after the events of the war. It caused a bigger pit between Slytherins and other houses—mostly with Gryffindors. It's just a fucked up world and Harry and Draco are the stars of the show.
Hermione nodded, "I felt that. Go on"
"Sure," he replied as he sat down on the old stained couch. He scanned the room, looking at the odd pots and pans, the weird buckets of whatever that is, and the insane amount of dog food in the corner of the hut. The pot sizzled a bit, indicating that it's ready. It's fast because he used magic. "Have you got a date for the Yule Ball yet?" Harry asked, starting the conversation.
"I can't! It's just there! It's in my head now!"
"I mean, I wasn't even sure what I'm feeling. So, one time I was walking back to our dorm when someone pulled me in. It was him and — and he was flirting, like a lot. I obviously was still mad at him. He makes fun of me and he's making me... question things. I hated his guts so much, especially with what they continuously did to other students."
"As if anybody would want to" Draco's mumble triggers the protective sense in Ronald Weasley and Harry was very much aware of this. Not a good start, good to know he was right. "As much I would love to see how this turns out, we really don't have much time" He tried to ease the tension with sarcasm. Snape nodded. "Yes. You have 2 hours before I have to bring you into detention"
The tone sounded more of excitement rather than disappointment. Way different than they expected. Both blushed, not exactly knowing how to react to that comment. They share the same brain cell. And that brain cell keeps telling they're gonna get fucked even more in the teacher's lounge.
"Or a friend even" Ron Weasley wheezed, which made the girl glare.
shenanigan is. But they continuously try to not be too gay. Were they being too gay? Is there even such a thing as being
bad this shit's gonna turn out. He can feel it. "Hello, Harry"
"To make sure they don't look gay," Voldemort said cooly.
"Well, I'm not gay, okay?!" His vision blurred, his head felt numb. He got up and turned to them, "Does that sound pretty clear to you?" His voice was dark and low with a growl. Top!Harry for the win. Hermione couldn't meet his glare and looked down, visibly scared she would say something disrespectful.
Fuck, that's true. "Are you under some kind of love potion?!" Ron turned at him. Harry can't help but laugh.
. At some point, the conversation led to the Triwizard Tournament. He talked about Harry and how amazing he was fighting the dragon. And how he saved Draco from the lake by eating some weird seaweed. And how he became a Dylan O'Brien and then winning the whole thing.
Bro. You've said those words a thousand times.
Not the slightest. You?
Harry bit the inside of his lips, trying to hold back a smile as he felt the boy's smirk climbing up his neck. "Yes," He muttered quietly. "But you're not really that good at being subtle, are you?"
Draco and his friends have been checking up on Thanos, waiting for the boy to come back, well, conscious. Draco was given a week of detention, which he feels like he deserves.
I can confirm to you, Hermione and Ron. He's a very dashing lad. Well, that's bloody British for my Asian ass to say.
Draco nodded and followed him out.
Draco knew Voldemort will be okay with it when he accidentally told him he likes a boy named Harry in a random conversation once with his godfather. That's what pushed Draco to use their time in detention very wisely the second he knew Voldemort's guarding it. "Yeah, but they kinda pushed us—" Harry commented.
"But it's just weird, isn't it?" Ron furrowed, "What if he's just doing that to use you and kill you and feed you to his death eaters—" Ron rambled before Hermione nudged him by the hips once she noticed Harry laughing at his own little prank. Bitch thought he did something.
"But it wasn't his fault," Pansy quickly backed up her homeboy, having to see the whole drama with her own eyes. Blaise jumped in as well, "Yeah! He was insulting him. I think he deserves it"
"I thought I already told you that—"
The father nodded and smiled. "I would give you a hug but—" You don't have to say the words twice, papa. As Draco pulled him into a tight embrace. "Well, alright then"
He obviously chose the second. No way in hell would he take such a risk. What is he? A Gryffindor?
. Hermione said carefully, "I'm aware that we've always been trying to hook you up with a lot of girls lately and we want to apologize"
Hermione giggled. "It's probably just Ginny"
"And super taken," Harry replied, remembering the time they were in the lake. So, the thing is, the Triwizard Tournament ended four days ago and this Friday, they would end the Tournament with the Yule Ball — which includes handing out the prize to the winner of the tournament.
At this point, Lucius was sure that he at least did something right. At least. Not that good since he made his son scared to come out to him, but still. He was proud of him.
"You mean like Bisexual?" Hermione looked at Harry. Sounded more like a question of confirmation, other than genuinely asking. Ron furrowed, "A what?" Ron did not read the gay books Hermione asked him to read.
"It is."
Harry nodded slowly.
He continued, "He's been constantly trying to get my attention — which he honestly didn't have to try." He murmured that last part. "So one day, If I'm not mistaken, we were in the care of magical creatures class and he whispered something to me. Something like, meet me in the Astronomy Tower."
"What rumor?! Can anybody in this table speak bloody English?" Harry wasn't sure that the rumor was between him and Draco or any other girls people think he's fancying. He's pretty sure by now it's not Draco because they've been very public about hating each other. Very public. So he's pretty fucking sure it's not them.
"What?" He
"You wish, Weasel Prat—" He gritted his teeth. Face moving closer as Ron stepped back. He realized Harry was glaring at him and sighed before
So when they shared their last period together—Astronomy—Harry sneakily lent his Invisibility Cloak and a note stuck on to it written,
sorry if it's bad. and sorry if it took me a few days to update, it was my birthday a few days ago and i wanted to spend it by doing absolutely nothing. lmao.
It's been a week since the lake thing. People try not to think about it that much, also seeing that Harry and Draco are back to their supposed rivalry with one in a few times making fun of him in public. So yeah, you can say it's not a big deal.
Draco jolted at the unsuspected deep sexc voice. "Professor Snape!"
"Oh, oh! Can I guess?" Dumbledore exclaimed excitedly. All turning heads at him. McGonagall groaned the fifth time today. "It's Potter and Malfoy, you dumbass idiot"
"But he is a dick!" Ron exclaimed, raising his hand to make a point. Adding to the dramatics of it all. "Even if he doesn't have one"
Blaise laughed lightly and introduced himself to Ron. "I already know Hermione," He turned to her, "We met at the library a few weeks ago"
"Apologies for the interruption" He snapped his head to the seated students. "Carry on now, children. I need to talk with your professor here"
earlier.
All three stopped laughing and looked back at him, realizing he's still in the room with them. Snape looked down as Dumbledore bit his lip, making weird hand gestures. "Well..."
"It is a fact that Severus' quite fond of her," McGonagall told Harry. Snape quickly added, "N–Not in a weird way—"
"But that doesn't mean this is okay!" McGonagall quickly added. "We're still taking away your house points for this. 10 points from both Gryffindor and Slytherin"
"Never hurt you?" Hermione added after Ron. "Do you even realize who you're talking about, mate?" Ron asked.
Huh, morning stroll my ass.
Snape walked in, kicking the door in front of him with his feet. He held the two boys by the back of their collar while the students looked down shyly. Oh, they're so screwed now.
Ron nodded. "Yeah, you got a point" Ugh. Such good friends. The two turned to Harry, waiting for his opinion. Harry eventually smiled, "Thanks, Hermoine. But I think I have someone in mind to take to the ball"
"I know right!" Madam Pomfrey smiled widely, eating another spoonful of it. Hagrid and Flitwick smiled at the review, "Thanks, Malfoy"
The crowd cheered as one by one they emerged to the surface. First being Cedric and his bf. I read it beef, I don't know why.
Malfoy let out a laugh, "I tried. But I'm pretty sure the world couldn't live without me" He said, before flying away. Harry trailing right behind him. "Corrections, the world would be better off without you," Harry said, now flying next to him.
you," Snape said, standing a few feet away from him. "I know" The dark lord smirked and tilted his head.
"Thank you!" Voldemort said, "Now if you'd excuse them, they would like to go back to their dorms, please" He held their shoulders. The headmaster nodded, "Right. You may return to your dorms."
"Dating? What? Are they gay?"
"It's about the dance..." Hermione started.
"I'm talking about you, silly. You wouldn't last a day without me" He teased before fleeing further away from him. He chuckled and caught up with him with ease. "Uh, hell yeah I would"
"Exactly," The two laughed. They walked past the entrance wing towards Hagrid's hut, since it's least likely anyone else would be there. "How about your friends?"
B: "Everybody has a crush on Malfoy. He may be dumb and a self-entitled brat but he's hot. No doubt in that"
Nothing. They continued to do nothing. It's been weeks after the rumor started and Draco was more than scared that his father would hear about it and possibly kick him out of the family tree — or burn the wallpaper with his face on it.
Everybody turned to him and as I said earlier—he runs this precinct. The group watched as Draco walked up to the trio, shooting glares sharper than a mother in laws tongue. "Leave." The bad bitch but kind of a coward said sternly. Harry finds it hot—but don't tell anyone.
Draco chuckled. Zabini agreed, "Yup! You're the type to pull that off"
Ron furrowed, "Who do you think invited you here in the first place?"
"To me! Not to you." Harry said, "At least, since this year. He makes fun of me more than anyone else — or just me. Because I told him if we're gonna make this work, he's gotta stop making fun of others and being a dick"
"Uh..." Harry looked around, trying to subtly cover up his thunderbolt with, I don't know, hope?
"Then what are you gonna name him? Tom?" Sprout asked jokingly, which made the room sink back into laughter. "Oh, shut up." Voldemort waved his hand, the other holding his butterbeer, "I may be different now but I still hated that name. If Tom Riddle sees me making amends with all of you, he would've killed me"
"You don't have to." Draco smirked, "The second you sucked—"
He rolled his eyes, "Get the fuck up here, you sick coward"
"Are they... flirting?" Dumbledore asked from afar.
He lit up when he realized how fucking wrong his assumptions were. He hummed and nodded slowly, "It's not bad. It's actually quite good"
"For anyone who had to deal with you!"
Okay, Harry, calm down. Calm down. He used his wand and went swimming up to the surface. Victor Krum from Durmstrang quickly swam from behind. Well, he assumed it's Victor Krum because he's a shark now. He cut open the rope that's holding his girlfriend down and quickly swam up after Cedric and Harry, followed by Fleur Delacour and her sister.
Oh, yeah, cool. Potter's here again.
"Hey, bro!" He greeted with a wide smile, before dissolving when he saw the small vial in Snape's hand. "It's that time of the month, huh?"
"In our defense, it takes two to play chess," Dumbledore said. He saw Harry and Draco with Snape and he smiled. "Ah, our two beloved students. What have you two rascals done this time?"
The noseless and hairless fluffy monster looked around, seeing that there are still people just standing there and not cower away. "What are you all standing here for? Fuck off!" He waved his arm once before watching as students continued to spill back inside the castle.
Harry furrowed at him, definitely not getting the
"Welcome to this year's Triwizard Tournament's Yule Ball!"
"You and your stupid ways of learning," Pansy and Draco laughed. Blaise rolled his eyes.
All these little things might trigger something in both the boys' hearts. He started to develop what they refer to as feelings. But neither one was a man enough to admit that.
They all stayed quiet before Harry sorta, kinda, allegedly, shoved his boyfriend to step to the front and say something. "It's very very nice to meet you, Madam Thislethorps." He shakingly said, trying to look cool in front of a celebrity. She hums. "What do you want?" Draco opened his mouth. "Do you wanna free ticket for tonight's concert?" She continued before Draco could start. The rest of the kids' eyes twinkle with hope. "Yeah, no. That can't do. I have plenty of bar workers coming here, asking for tickets to give to their family members. But no can do! You have to pay to see the show! These boobs aren't going to be out for free, My Merlin!"
The bet is re-opened since neither one has actually succeeded in their goal. Draco was left with nothing and has accepted the fact that he will lose a bet against his most prestigious rival, Harry Potter. Oh, how he will crumble in die in despair.
drunk and thought they just saw Draco dancing with Harry? They might find that answer in just a bit.
Lucius chuckled quietly and nodded. Looks like Draco's not the only one holding back tears. "Yeah, me neither." He smiled. A smile Draco would kill to see again. "It would probably take me some time, to fully understand everything, but it must be said. You are my son, no matter what. And if children are supposed to be the ones proud of their fathers, well, I am proud to be Draco Malfoy's father"
"There you are, Severus!" He flung open the door. "I've been searching all over for you!" He bellowed excitedly. Snape's face lit up and laughed, walking over to him. "I'm right here! How's the book?"
"Oh yeah, at least my crush liked me back. How about you, Malfoy? Couldn't impress a guy enough for them to take you to Hogsmeade?" He forced down the slight cringe at the irony in his words when he spoke.
"Voldy?" Ron now furrowing at Hermione.
"and this year's Triwizard Tournament champion, Harry fucking Potter!"
Harry smirked.
"Bloody hell" They jolted up when they heard a sudden voice from inside the room. They sighed in relief when they realized what it is. "She's asleep" Blaise whispered, pointing at the lady. She was asleep on her rocking chair, facing out the window on the front side of the room. Only her back was visible from the kids' side.
Harry didn't budge, still locking eyes with the Slytherin. "You've seen me in the field. I'm pretty sure you know what I'm capable of"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well, enjoy the party, lads" He hissed like the Slytherin he is before walking away. Yet, Hermione stopped him by grabbing his arm. "Listen here, you bastard." Hermione glared, "Today's his night. Don't fuck it up for him." Her words threatened him enough for his breath to hitch. He nodded, yanking his arm away from her grip, and walked away.
But before he can answer, the cannon blew up signaling their time to get in the water. The effects of whatever Neville gave him were making it hard for him to swim but he managed. He honestly has no fucking idea what treasure they meant to be looking for.
The dark lord glared at him. "You're not helping, Draco"
"Oh, yeah! He's very nice" Ron agreed enthusiastically. "and he's super cute," She added.
Pansy, being a Drarry shipper, couldn't take it. It's time to cut the crap. "Nope, that's it. He lied. He likes somebody else" Draco turned to her in horror. Did this bitch just—? Pansy turned to the table their group use to sit on and pointed at Hermione, who was staring at them this whole time. "Hey, Mione. I really like you and your gorgeous smile and your intelligence of a bus. Would you go out with me?"
rose up.
"You know I didn't mean that" Draco rolled over to look him in the eye. Both shirtless and sweaty. Harry pulled him down to meet his lips and smiled, "I know. I honestly think it's hot when you diss me"
Oh, wait, That sounded awfully wrong.
He stood up straight across from Dumbledore, looking him dead in the eye. Dumbledore leaned in and whispered, "Harry"
That managed to make the whole table use their brain cells and creative imagination to imagine possible couple moments the two would share if they were to be together. Enemies to lover sort of fanfiction. Yeah, that's cute. Hermione was one to agree first, "He has been quite obsessed with Harry lately" She pointed out with a smirk.
But it was still the best feeling in the world —
Pansy frowned. "Well, damn. No need to be too aggressive" She whispered to the one beside her. "When she said fag, does she mean a cig?"
I'm not gonna tell what I had planned for you, but tell one thing,
gonna pretend you didn't say that"
Ron and Hermione watched as Harry hopped down from where he was sitting, strutting his way over to his supposed bully. "Don't do that to yourself, Malfoy. I swear I saw your face lit up when you saw me" He said with ease. Stopping mid-way with hands crossed over his chest.
Harry rolled his eyes and smiled before turning his heels on Draco's opposite direction. But before he could take another step, Draco tugged his arm and pulled him to another kiss. Harry smiled, kissing him back. He flinched slightly when he felt the blond's hand slipped inside the back pocket of his jeans then patting on what seems to be a note. "See you tonight" Draco winked before walking outside.
Before he realized it was coming from the window next to his bed. He turned around and smiled in surprise, "Draco?"
"What?" Ron turned to her in surprise.
Draco laughed as he held his hand out, helping him mount his broom. "So are you."
Hagrid chuckled and nodded at Harry's statement. "Well, that's for certain. Alright then. I'll see you later, Harry" He said in his thick iconic accent. Harry waved from the sofa with a smile, "Bye, Hagrid!"
"As far as I know, no. They don't know. Probably he already told Blaise or Pansy or both. I don't know. But he agreed to dance with me in the ball." Harry answered the question. She smiled widely, "Oh my god! So this is like your coming out ball!"
He shook his head and turned around, ready to get the fuck out of there. "We're sorry!" Blaise quickly said. Draco stopped in the stairs, his back facing them. "We're sorry for what happened a few days ago. Can we please... talk?" He pleaded, much softer this time.
on his broom. His smile shined brighter than his white-silver hair reflecting the moonlight. Harry looked around and got out his bed, pushing his window open. "What are you doing here?" he whispered, not wanting to wake up the guys in his room. He rested his hands on the window sill, the smile still very visible. "To save your arse from this shit hole." The blond smirked, "Where's your broom, princess?"
"Enough, Ron." Hermione told him before turning to Harry, "So, since when? How did this all come about?"
"Well, you don't have much of a choice do you, Malfoy?" Hermione chimed in, crossing her arms and lips pursed. Their petty conversation
"Who is that? Is that Draco Malfoy?"
to show his white-blond hair. Harry giggled, "Yes, it's perfect"
The complimented boy pushed his blush away with an eye-roll. "How did I even end up with you?"
"Oh. Uh, yeah, sure." Harry replied stupidly.
gonna add wizard or magic to every object in here.
Ronald turned, "How can I be jealous? I'm taking you as my date." He said before skipping a couple of steps and up to his room. Harry chuckled as Hermione rolled her eyes and blushed, "You better get some rest, too." Harry told her.
Professor Sprout chuckles as she spelled the cards back into a pile. "You can't expose him like that, Voldy"
"I mean," Ron stated, "I'm okay with you dating guys. Hell, I'm even okay if you date my father," Harry furrowed. "But Malfoy?! There are billions of other good-looking blokes in this world, Harry!"
She was a bit taken back. Draco doesn't usually refer his friends with their last name, so
Draco walked in and closed the door behind him. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked. Draco shrugged, "I honestly don't know. I was with Blaise and Pansy when I saw you walking down with Hagrid. Thought I'd say hello"
Well, fucking hell mate.
"How did we not notice this?" Hermione asked, mostly to herself. Harry shrugged, "But I went there and we..." They furrow as he watched him do weird gestures with his hands. Ron gaped him in horror. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no—"
"Ew, don't" Draco grimaced, which made the brunette boy laugh. "Where are you going after this?" He asked. The latter shrugged, "If that's an invitation, I'm totally going"
She nodded. "Right. You're gonna go and see Malfoy, aren't you?"
"Fucking hell" Draco rubbed his forehead. And as if he knew his ships are in trouble, Voldemort popped out of nowhere like my pimple. Speaking of pimples, isn't it amazing how all of these hormonal teenagers have clear perfect skin? What type of sorcery shit is this and where can I buy it?
The boy sighed and cleared his throat. The two sat down and wait for this so-call big announcement. "I... I've been thinking about moving into Voldemort's farm this summer"
"Surprise?" Draco smiled nervously, shoulders arching up. Voldemort smiled, "Don't worry, Potter. I love you both just the same. So, what are two doing here?" He asked. Snape answered, "I caught them snogging—"
with truths and advice from Voldemort. Draco was very thankful for that. So the night after, he packed up his courage to go and talk to Narcissa, Draco Malfoy's mother. Which turned out, "Good, actually. Better than any conversations we had"
The trio walked into the hallway for mealtime like they always do, looking around at the students that were filling up the room. "How about Dean? He looks rather charming" Hermione pointed out, all turning their heads to Dean who was sitting with Neville and Seamus, laughing at one of Seamus' dumb stories.
Ron, Hermione, and Harry had just finished class and wouldn't be in one until the next hour. So they decided to sit down and talk in the courtyard, a bit of fresh air after being indoors for so long. They sat down at a lower edge of a stone wall and laughed at something Hermione said.
surprised." Pansy admitted, "Your entire career is talking about Potter this, Potter that. It was bound to happen at some point."
"I knew it started last year when I thought I saw you two under the bleachers." Dumbledore admitted, "But I never thought it was true. Until today"
"I can't swim, Harry. Please don't let me go" He quickly said. Harry nodded and held him tighter, "Yes, yes, love. Calm down, okay. I got you. Come on" He said softly before swimming back to the ground. They all ran up to him. Harry hurriedly let them help Draco up before himself and was quickly given a towel to dry up.
"It's so weird coming from you" Ron laughed, clutching onto his dear life so he doesn't accidentally push himself back and fall like Humpty Dumpty. "Unlike you, I know what I should and should not say" Hermione replied with a chuckle.
Draco couldn't care less about her sitting next to him if it wasn't for her slight bicep massage that made Harry furrow and Pansy ready to slice her throat. Erika then continued to offer Draco her bowl of almond nuts.
Draco coughed heavily and shaking at the cold air touching his skin. Harry reflectively scooted over to Draco, holding his shoulder, trying to help him get warm. "Hey, hey. Are you okay?"
Everyone turned their heads towards the door as Harry lunged himself inside the teacher's common room. "Harry," Dumbledore said, enough to attract Draco's attention and turn around.
"Oh my god! Stop hitting on him" Hermione looked at him as they sat down at an empty space in their table, causing Harry to laugh. "I don't mean me!" He said, "I meant like... Fred or George"
Today's the day bitches. The fucked up day they've all been waiting for. Harry can already imagine how
A: "Why are you describing him like food. Don't tell me you're gay too"
To their surprise, Dumbledore stood up and punched the air in excitement. "WOOHOO!" He exclaimed, face brightly glowing with a smile bigger than Harry's ass. Snape rolled his eyes, rubbing his temple with his hand.
"Harry, you're not allowed here," McGonagall told him. In which Harry just turned to her, face clearly not liking what he just heard. He shook his head, "No, no. I'm pretty sure I have as much involvement in this student drama shit as Malfoy. So can I ask?" Harry turned to the rest of the professors in the room—Snape and Dumbledore. "Whose fault do you think it is?"
on Christmas break when he gets to see them again.
It's not a very Draco thing to do, actually. It's on-brand for a
Good thing Ron was there to the rescue. "Run!" He exclaimed before running outside for his dear life. The people there tried to chase after them out but failed miserably. They have a tight law surrounding underage drinking or even walking into a bar after the minister's son died over alcohol poisoning. Anyway...
McGonagall sighed once more. "It's called snogging, Severus." Which made both Draco and Harry blush uncontrollably. The headmaster laughed at Snape's take on making out. "Not surprised he doesn't know the term snogging. Haven't done that since Lily died" He and McGonagall laughed.
Harry furrowed and looked up to his professors, "Lily? Like—Like my mother?"
"Don't stop now, Malfoy. We have another week to get ourselves — in ourself I meant me — a date. So, rest assured, I will win this bet."
Harry and Draco are known for their petty arguments and bickering.
That bloody bitch knows what he's doing.
Ron gaped at him as if he had just betrayed their 6 years of friendship just like that. Hermione turned to him, "Why didn't you shut the window, Ronald?"
Everyone turned to him and cheered. "Who the hell is that with Harry?" Dean pointed. Hold on to your horses, because shits about to get gay.
"It's the weekend!" Harry turned to the man of his dreams as he drags him by the wrist. "Don't tell me you're scared, Malfoy"
Who could that be? "Draco.." The man started, yet his eyes stared back at the group across him.
The so-called bully blushed at the touch. He looked up and smiled teasingly, "Nah, I don't think so"
"Are they dating?"
. "I guess, that's my cue." He took a deep breath a smiled
Hagrid had told Harry earlier that day about having to leave with Dumbledore on some important business. Harry then offered to take care of his dog, Fang, while he was away. So he did. After class, he quickly changed out of his uniform into a more comfortable muggle shirt and walked down with Hagrid to his hut not far from the castle.
"Still hanging out with these weirdos huh, Potter?" The group turned to see the wonderful and fantabulous Draco Malfoy with his hair glowing brighter than my future and complexion. Differing from my explanation of Malfoy, the group hated his guts. He's a prick with no ounce of kindness in his blood if you asked them.
Which Hermione took to heart. "Honestly, Malfoy. If you aren't dating Harry, I probably wouldn't dare let you go near me"
"When yours do. Oh, wait, my bad. You don't have one."
. Everyone looked stunning in their gowns and robes. Huh, wizards. Making robes look expensive and glamorous.
"Well, is there something more important you should say about them, Headmaster Dumbledore?" She switched the conversation back to their students.
You know what, don't ask Harry.
Pansy stayed quiet at the groan from Draco. She's usually never quiet. Like, never. If it was someone else, I can assure you she would prove to you how much of a Slytherin she is. "Draco, if you could let us talk," Blaise started, standing next to Pansy. "And then what?" His grey eyes storming furiously, "Call me names again?!"
to sneak out at night, but not something Draco has actually attempted to do. Until tonight. Oh, the things he does for Harry. One might think he's some sort of bad boy jock type when
Draco put his hand up and he sat down beside Harry. "Nah, I'm good thanks."
"You blackmailed him, didn't you?" Draco asked. He was impressed, not gonna lie. "Because that's exactly what I would do," Draco said proudly.
"Bloody hell" Ron groaned.
"WTF"
I don't need the term 'trying', Malfoy
"Ew, don't say it like that" Dumbeldore instantly throwing his hands back down. Harry and Draco's cheeks turned visibly pink again in embarrassment. Their teachers knew. Well, that must've summed up something. "Sorry about that," He said that as he sat back down on his chair.
"Hey. How's your first day going?" Harry asked once Draco stopped Harry outside the Great Hall, far away from the crowd.
"Honest to Salazar, Draco," Pansy said, holding his knee. "I am okay with that Yule ball surprise"
Dumbledore threw his head back and laughed at McGonagall's face, well not at her, but like literally in front of her face. She groaned as Dumbledore pointed, "I got you now, Minerva!" But before she could clap back with a sarcastic remark, they heard a knock on the door. "Come in!"
, waving lowly and wished him good luck before turning to walk away.
"No, no, no, no. Hell no. I wasn't even finished you prat" He smacked his arm jokingly, making Draco laugh. "What I'm saying before you blindly interrupted was that... I'm tired of having to hide this relationship for so long. We've been doing this for more than a year and fuck do I want to take you by the hand, steal kisses as we dance like traditional heterosexual couples would do. I want that. A lot. Do you?"
Draco's Slytherin group, who were watching from up the tower, were hella confused when they saw Draco Malfoy emerging with Harry from the lake. "Is that Draco?" Pansy pointed from the highest spot of the water tower. Blaise nodded, "What the absolute fuck is he doing there?"
Blaise nodded, "Exactly. Don't tell me you got no date. You
Harry jolted up. "Shit" He muttered and turned. "Oh, hi. Professor. Sorry" He smiled with tinted cheeks.
"You know me so well" Draco cackled, letting Harry roll his eyes and smile for the fiftieth time today. Fuck, he would kill to have it like this every day. You know what, he probably would.
The whispers went something like this:
"Take it as a compliment" Ron shrugged. Harry arrived later than them because Ron had to go and meet with Hermione in front of her dorm, in which he didn't mind. He found it better to stay and collect himself first away from people, including Ron.
Pansy was first to respond with a smile and a quick shake with her head. "Not at all." She has always had that cold, sassy persona from her. But when in reality she is the friendliest friend one could have. But she's also very opinionated and when she hates it, she would think twice to cut the crap.
"You can sit with us." Harry said, "Come on" He pulled Draco with him back to the hall. Draco stopped him from getting dragged and looked at Harry. "I don't think they want me there. They don't even like me" He shared his concern.
It's Harry's turn to say it. "Oh no"
Harry laughed, both continuing to walk. "Never thought that I'd get the chance to hear you say those words to me"
Harry walked in with a weird vibe surrounding him. It felt as if there's another cover story about him that he didn't know about. There were stares and distinct whispers as he walked towards his usual place at the table, sitting between Ron and Neville, across from Hermione who was talking with Ginny and Luna. Harry couldn't help but ask when he approached his friends. "What's going on?"
"Have you ever feel attracted to me?" Ron asked genuinely.
"You know who else is waiting to be asked out by Draco Malfoy?" Harry smirked as he said that. The latter's blood rushed up to his cheeks as he rolled his eyes, "Oh, shut up"
Harry hates that Draco can easily do that to him. He looked down, trying to brush off the pink tint on his cheeks before turning back to Voldemort. "Thanks again, professor"
there with his possible future hubby. "I love this burst of confidence. It looks good on you" Harry complimented, following Draco's footsteps.
"Choosing—?"
Their bright happy faces turned cold as they all collectively stared at him in agony and annoyance. That is until Harry said this dumb shit, "And who do you think I should hang out with? You?" Not realizing the reaction of his friends.
commented. Harry chuckled, "I'm
remember?"
The latter stopped dead in his tracks. As if his cheeks can get any redder than this. He turned to him and glared, "Don't make me kill you right this instant, Harry"
Draco furrowed in surprise, "What?! You knew about this?"
you're gonna regret ever agreeing to make a bet with me.
"Bisexual." She explained, "It means you like both men and women. I looked it up while I was searching about — well, Ron already told you that"
"Where's your date?" he whispered again. He wasn't sure if his date ended being with Malfoy, which is why he wasn't asking for him. But unlike Albus, Voldemort and Snape already knew. "Where is he?" Voldemort whispered to Snape.
Because of this predicament, the group was given detention for a week—including Draco. Harry knew about this but he needed to see Draco, ask him what exactly happen and why. And possibly to make out with him, both sound as important.
Everyone is super excited about the Triwizard Tournament that is happening here in Hogwarts. It's an inter-school magical competition that consists of three dangerous tasks. Being the main character of the franchise, Harry Potter is obviously going to participate.
"Hello, Hagrid!" Harry smiled as Draco waved lowly. "We just made incredibly delicious stew, by the way," Flitwick told, showing the big pan he was holding. Hagrid handed one of the empty bowls he had on his hand, "Here! Have some!"
"I'm pretty sure you two know why we're here," Harry said. He was sitting down on the red wooly carpet in front of the fireplace. He sat in a circle between Ron and Hermione, knees pressed against his chest, and his hands resting on both knees as he started.
There was also this one time in their eight-year common room when Harry walked in soaking wet with sweat and a bit of rain in the tips of his hair. He was helping Hagrid with a few things before it started pouring cats and dogs outside. From the look of it, it seems that he has missed most of the drops with the help of his vast flying technique yet not vastly enough for an impervius charm.
like that. You know, like if you watch rap battles or dissing battles and then people go oooooh, well that's what they did. "You wish, you pathetic little git!" He snarled.
wherever they are atm.
Draco saw Harry staring at him in awe and decided to flip him off, causing him to laugh and roll his eyes. Followed by Ron and Hermione who stood behind their friend. "Come down here, you punk"
"It's you again" The blond scoffed when he saw the group walking inside the room. He had taken off his rob and was left with just his white shirt and his iconic Slytherin house tie. His hair was glowing for some fucking reason but so are his eyes. It stayed glowing in perfection. He leaned back on his chair, arms crossed and feet resting on the wooden table across him.
It's just the vibe, ya know? He's more... happy. And Narcissa couldn't be happier.
"Harry!" Hermione ran up to him with a wide smile on her face, not noticing Harry's slightly blushing cheeks. Thankfully, she's bringing a good sign with her. Maybe life doesn't hate him that much after all. Thanks, author of his life!
His little micro brain cell just turned on its emergency alarm, which has been ringing loads of times lately. His reaction scared both Ron and Hermione. Afraid that she said something wrong, she opened her mouth to explain, before Harry then cut her off, "Are you two suggesting that I might be gay??"
Hermione, who seems to agree with the redhead, nodded and jumped in, "Well at least he didn't send us owls to mock us every day, did he?" Yeah about that. You see, during summer break, Harry's been receiving mysterious letters addressing to—yeah obviously to him—even when he was staying at the Weasleys. Ron and Hermione were pretty damn sure it was Malfoy, but they honestly couldn't care less.
. He adored Luna in her weird yet unique way of perceiving life. It's a gift, not a lot of people can relate to. "It's okay. I get nervous too, sometimes." Luna told him
"The rumors are true then. I knew something was going on between you two. I just didn't know it was true. S–Since when?"
, "Only you"
The latter jumped slightly before turning back to the girl. "Uh, sorry"
He turned to see what they were all gasping at and was shocked to see Thanos unconscious on the floor. He rushed to him, doing a simple spell to cover the wound on his forehead. "Get him to Madam Pomfrey!" He quickly ordered. The students nodded and helped him out the house. Snape turned around, looking at Draco, who was still in a complete state of shock.
He shoved the nameless bitch up the wall, which gained a few gasps from the students watching. I'm pretty sure there was a crack on the wall for a split second there. "Speak like that about him again and I won't hesitate to ruin that brainless skull of yours"
"Is it even gonna matter if we say no?" Dean shrugged as he replied. Draco smiled widely, "Oh my god! I feel like you've known me forever" He joked tirelessly and pulled Harry by his arm. Very well noticing a couple of non-subtle stares from the kids there. Memories of last night still very fresh in their mind.
"At least I have great taste in men" Harry smirked. Draco grimaced, "Ew. Don't." before pulling him to round two, baby!
Draco laughed and nodded. Holding back a blush is not part of the list of traits Draco has. Harry smiled at his reaction, "I'm ranting a full paragraph here so are you gonna say yes or no?"
And he's out.
Draco turned around and gulped like a fish. "Father."
Ron and Hermione turned around when they heard someone walking towards them. "Hey, mate!" Ron greeted with a smile.
It made the boy's cheek flustered in bright soft red thanks to his very white and pale skin. "How do you feel now that she knows?" Harry asked
"Whatever you say, kid"
"Aw, look at you guys being nice to each other," Harry cooed sarcastically from behind Draco, which led to Blaise and Pansy chuckling. "Really, Potter?"
He swam up to him and held his face closely. His pale face was paler than pale—it's like waking up to a fucking nightmare. He quickly swam to the rope that's holding him down. He saw Cedric Diggory swimming after and with his wand, he cut open the rope. Oh, time to cheat.
"Welcome to task number two of the Triwizard Tournament. I forgot what they exactly say in this scene so just pretend this is accurate. For the second task, we have taken a special something from you. Your job is to find it and get back here before the time runs out. Got it? Yes, please."
Walking together out in the open for the first time is still very new to them. They were used to sneaking around and stealing
Harry notes his voice wasn't his usual teasing manner, yet nor was it pity or worry like he would hear from Hermione and occasionally, Ron.
"Mood."
"At least I have friends. Where's yours?"
Harry could only smile back, hoping the exact same thing. "Don't worry about him, Harry."
So she was so happy to finally get to sit down and talk with Harry. His son's first boyfriend. Harry was obviously different than the others, as cheesy as it sounds but it's true. Other than being a guy—which differentiate a lot from the others—he was also the one Draco was super excited to tell his mother about. To coo on him for his achievements. To show his mom,
Harry sighed, "You're gonna say yourself, aren't you?"
"So?" Harry smirked, tilting his head to the side. Draco shrugged, "I'd say a solid 8 out of ten"
"Is this really the only way up, Malfoy?' Hermione asked the blond boy who was also not liking this plan that might involve ruining his over-priced dressing robe.
Harry furrowed, eyes still ahead. "How's he a replica Voldemort? He has a nose" Both furrowed at his response. "What Ron meant was he's got followers," Hermione explained. "Like Voldy"
"Hermione's just mad because she wasn't prepared for that" Weasley chuckled, turning to his Yule Ball date.
Harry's days were not light and breezy after that. People were speculating and it's killing him—he hates this. Why can't people let him live for once? Shouldn't he be called The Boy Who Lived for a reason?
"Happy" He chuckled at his soppy reply. "You're right. It's nice to finally get it off my chest"
Backing down already, Malfoy?
Oh, the audience is enjoying this. Draco sneered, "If a fight is what you want, then a fight is what you'll get. But I promise no civil hugs once this is over"
Harry shrugged, "Would you like to know"
Draco wheezed. "At least you didn't die a virgin. A thank you for me would be nice"
"I don't dance" Snape answered shortly, not changing his stance. Even if he was shook by what he did. "Neither do I. But we can't
Surprisingly enough, he hasn't done much but good. He continues to be kind and polite to people and eventually made a bond with the professors there. He started gardening with Professor Sprout to keep his mind sane and calm when he's in need to fight. He also started knitting, muggle style, which really helps.
Ron hums, "That's actually nice"
"Way to ruin the moment, mate"
Harry was visibly hurt when Draco came strutting into the great hall with Pansy in his hand — neither looking anything but casual, as if they've done this before. Truth be told, it's true. Harry did his best to conceal it. He congratulated him and moved on to say that a deal's a deal and that he's ready for anything. Not only did he lost to Malfoy, he literally lost Malfoy. But wait a damn minute, didn't Pansy once said she's gay as hell?
The blond chuckled and walked to him and, of course, checking him out as always. "You look better than last night" He smirked.
The water was as clear as my future—not clear at all—and it's making it hard for him to see as if he's not legally blind already. He squinted his eyes when he saw a human body in the middle of the lake, not moving. Why is it not moving? Is it dead? Why is it dead? Is he gonna end up like this lifeless body too? Oh shit, it's Draco!
"Ugh." Harry groaned with a smile he can't seem to wipe off. "I hate these types of flirting"
Draco smiled. He smiled gratefully. "Thanks. Thank you. For saying that." He said slowly, "I really appreciate that. Coming from you"
Hermione noticed that too. "Were you smoking?" She bluntly asked. Pansy turned to her and smirked, "Yes, love. Don't tell me you haven't tried it before"
Harry smiled in relief, watching the love of his depressing life walked towards him. His hair was looking gorgeous, even from afar. He must be from the bathroom. "Hi" Harry smiled, holding his hand.
Harry looked up from his notebook, "I—"
"You're doing great." Draco made sure with a smile.
"But Harry wouldn't look like this if Snape were to have a baby with Lily," Hagrid added, sitting down next to Madam Hooch. "Most of Harry's features were from James"
"And that's your best excuse?"
like that, whispers begin to uprise. He could feel the stares from every part of the room. Pushing away his anxiety to the side for the sake of it all. He took a deep breath before walking towards Hogwarts' Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.
"Okay, come on" Ron pulled her away before dark Hermione appeared. Dancing with her away from Harry and Draco. "But she's right though!" Ron
That is until she was told Draco's allergic to nuts by none other than Harry Potter. "Ah, I wouldn't do that if I were you" The brunette boy commented. "Draco hates nuts. In hate, I meant he will start having somewhat period cramps, red hives, nausea, and intense vomiting. So, unless you want your aspiring future boyfriend to feel such pain, then I suggest you put down your bowl and your boobs away from the man immediately"
"Oh, shut up." Voldemort shushed them, "I want to hear what they say next"
"Well I don't need saving, do I?!" Draco clenched his jaw. This the most public fight ever since all three schools are watching them. "Uh, yeah you do! You were gonna die until I had to save you!"
Harry chuckled and nodded, "Yeah, It was—"
"Did you find anything?" Harry popped up from the side. Draco sighed and shut the book with a bang. "Not a goddamn thing"
Everyone clapped and cheered which Harry can hear from behind the bigass door.
He shrugged with a smile, "Why not? Shall we?" He offered his hand to take. He did. It felt perfect as they made their way out of the school grounds, receiving cheers from their dramatic supportive friends and going wherever their mind and soul takes them — most likely to bed.
Both chuckled. "Then don't imagine it, Ron!" Hermione said.
"Potter."
"Harry Potter gay? Of course not."
because of him. And Harry Potter
"Neither do we, but look." He said walking closer, eyes genuinely sorry. "We're sorry for what happened a few days ago. It's not our right to judge what you... like" He said carefully. Draco looked down at his feet.
"Well, I have someone particular in mind" Draco replied with a smug smile. Harry plopped back down next to him, handing him his cup of tea. Draco muttered thanks before blowing it and taking a sip. "But I'm not sure if he would want to go with me. He's too... famous to go out with someone like me" He said teasingly.
That was before he met with Voldemort while he was going to his dorm and Voldemort invited him to his room. There he
"Just trying to get through your lie, Potter." His voice balancing Potter's, both attempting to intimidate the other.
"It would've been tears of joy"
"Everything" Voldemort replied shortly again.
went to labour. All the straight guys turned gay and all the lesbians turned bi
"Who lives here?" Hermione asked, trying to see if she can find her moving or something. "Madam Smolbum." Draco replied, "She used to be the Black Family's housekeeper until she fell sick. My mom decided to come and take care of her to pay her in return"
Harry laughed and tackled him with a kiss on his neck, making the blond giggle at the touch. "But I'm not pushing you, okay?" Harry suddenly stop to look at Draco, a lot more serious this time. "I'm having trouble dealing with these as well"
"Stop it, Ron!" She slapped his arm with her notes, "Yes, Harry. We get where you're going. Moving on"
"He better not be or you're gonna be next" Ron threatened as he watched hopefully from above the lake. Neville furrowed, "How does that have to do with me?"
Hermione nodded and shrugged. "I think so, yeah."
The golden trio spent the night looking through books in the library and it's killing them that they couldn't find anything. "I'm gonna go check out the books over in the back" Harry got up.
"And instead look like Severus?" McGonagall pointed at him, "Oh, Salazar bless us all" The room laughed. Snape furrowed and pointed at himself, "What's wrong with this?"
If I win, you wouldn't be seen walking properly the following day.
"Watch where I'm going? Watch where you're going!" Draco said as he crouches down to collect his fallen books. That's when Harry subtly pushed the box with his cloak in it towards Malfoy. The boy looked up but before he can say anything, Harry winked and got up, leaving Draco with his rock hard pants. What a fucking git.
Hermione turned hers as well and was a bit surprised that they're learning from the middle of the book, instead of the very beginning, since it was just their first day in his class. Hermione being Hermione, slowly raised her hand, eyes still locked at the book.
"Right," Draco said and nodded lowly. "I'll be right with you!" He told them before they walked inside the great hall.
Harry giggled as he nuzzled his face on Draco's shoulder, feeling the warmth of the boy. "I saw Hermione using this on her face so I thought," He shrugs, "Maybe it can help conceal mark since I'm not really good at spells either. I only remember a few like, Avada Kedavra"
on top of the waves of the wind. "Is that the best you can do?" He laughed and teased.
"Ronald?" She asked from her seat in a croaky voice. It's fucking creepy if you ask me.
"I didn't say I stopped" Harry grinned.
"Sorry..." They all laughed, clutching their stomachs with face stinging cold. "Yeah, you almost got us killed!" Blaise added jokingly.
"It's alright, mate. Any boyfriend of yours is a boyfriend of ours" Ron said with a proud smile. Hermione turned and furrowed. He sighed, "You know what I mean"
good people. So his coping mechanism is bringing down other's self-esteem. That fake persona, bitch, please.
Hermione watches as the two followed them up. Landing and grabbing parts of the walls and roof so they won't fall. She rolled her eyes and looking around her. Being the clever bad bitch she is, she got an idea. With a flick of a wand and a simple spell, she hopped on a big rock and flew herself to the top of the building, landing on the porch with the rest gracefully. Ron gasped as he watched his friend landing beside him without pulling a single muscle. "You're fucked up, Hermione! Why didn't you tell us this before?"
Out of all the attractive men, he fancies him. Why?!
said that he loved him out loud. Wow, who would've thought? Harry giggled and turned back to the marble-like sky. "The view from here is magnificent, innit?"
Draco's eyes were mostly the same as Ron and Hermione's—but more of worry. He knew how dangerous the tournament's going to be. But when he heard the distant chattering and giggles from his table, he knew there's a fucking fish market going around.
. "What took you so long?" Pansy asked, crossing one arm across her chest.
"Trust me, Malfoy. We would happily get away from you if it wasn't for Harry" Hermione stated before throwing Harry his bag. Draco looked at Harry from the other side of the room and asked, "What are you? Their master?"
"But it's working, isn't it?" He grinned like a maniac before widening once he saw the black-haired girl rolling her eyes and agreed.
C: "You're just saying that because you're jealous. You have a crush on Malfoy"
"Fuck off" They both laughed. "I have no idea how to dance, by the way," He finally admitted.
"What is?" Ron looked up with his mouth full of food. Hermione can't fucking stand this. "Swallow before you talk, Ronald!"
angry at Draco. "If you ever think of pulling that shit in front of my face again—"
The boys jolted up in surprise, untangling their arms as fast as their gay-ass can get. Draco looked the other way around—his attempt to hide his face—while Harry quickly stood up, adjusting his shirt. "Neville"
Draco chuckled, pulling his glass close to his lips, "No, I wouldn't" smiling cheekily at Severus and looking at Harry just to make sure he knew he was joking. Every living creature in the room laughed their guts off, clutching their stomach and wiping their tears like they wipe their butts.
Harry Potter being Harry Potter actually won the goddamn life-killing tournament. Not much of a surprise there. But now that he's the winner, picking a date for the ball is a pretty big deal. For they would be the one to start the whole ceremony off with a dance.
Draco noticed that Harry was making an inside joke that only the two of them understood, which caught him off guard. "What?" Was the only little squeak he could make out.
It was indeed a fact. Anyone with eyes and a gaydar would notice.  "Puh-lease!" Draco rolled his eyes, sending Crabbe his bag to catch. "As if you're not the one who can't keep it in your pants" He eyed Harry's pants. "If that's what you call pants"
part. "I'm serious. I can handle this, okay? This is my drama to handle. I'll see you outside. Okay, love?" He said the last words carefully. The Gryffindor calmed himself before nodding. Draco smiled tightly and pecked his adorable little cheek before letting his boy out the door. Draco admitted to being the one responsible for all this. Even if the teachers rooted him standing up for himself and others, it is still against the rules to use hexes and spells to injure fellow students/school staff.
Draco nodded, "Yeah." He smiled, "Yeah, I know. I just can't—my parents aren't really that supportive. Of this" He was quite sure of what he said because of the comment he overheard from his father about one of his far cousins coming out as gay.
The main character chuckled, "Right. So, I was so pissed off, but mostly to myself for even letting it in on that. Mind you, I wasn't even sure I was into blokes. At all. So, I spent my night... crying myself to sleep"
Dumbledore gave a look of—what the bloody fuck is that face—he looked like a fucking predator. Harry grimaced, "I'm sorry?" He didn't mean to make it sound like it was a question, but it did sound like it. Surprisingly, this is what the headmaster said, "Since when?"
"I get where they're coming from though," Seamus said, "One said they heard you talking with Malfoy in the Slytherin dorm room—"
The students that were left nodded in agreement. Very good guys. Well done. "Still. It is in no way stated in the books that you're allowed to use the
Ron was tired as hell. He made himself a very strong coffee with extra caffeine—I don't know how you do that, magic is always an answer in this universe. He yawned as he walked back to his table when he heard Hermione doing a very Hermione thing. "Draco Malfoy!" She came stomping to the table, face furious.
Harry cupped his own beautiful face in defeat, "Oh, fuck! I'm gonna die a closeted gay"
He sat down on his bed, not bothering to get up and tug the curtains shut.
There lived a boy named Harry Potter. He is very well-known in the wizarding world because well, he's The Boy Who Lived—even if he has always been dead inside.
"No, please. Let me finish," Draco said, sitting criss-cross in front of Harry on the carpet. He licked his lips inadvertently before continuing. "I was as surprised as you when your name popped up. I confronted them and it was true, they did put your name in the goblet of fiyah by asking a senior to do it for them. I didn't know why I didn't tell you this to you when we went to see the dragons the other day. I guess, I just didn't want you to stress more of the fact that you're gonna be facing a real-life flaming death threatening dragon, plus a group of pressed teenagers with ex-death eater parents that wants you dead"
"I'm pretty sure he had a better 20 minutes with me than 5 years with you two" The boy shot a smirk. Hermione didn't bother to reply when he noticed Harry's flushed face and not so tidy hair. "Harry, what happened to your face? You look all... flushed."
"Yes." He nodded. "But she's with Snape in the office"
It wasn't long until the cameras were capturing this wtf moment. All jaws dropped.
"Oh, you meant the suit. Draco's mom gave it to me" She did.
Voldemort gasped. "How dare you?! You can't push people out of the closet like that!" Yes, he is the most supportive teacher there, ever. Draco added, "Technically, he pulled us by the collar—"
. Both warming each other's hands off the cold of the night. "This is all thanks to you, by the way. I couldn't have done this without you"
"Just say it's not true, Harry" Ron said, kinda hoping it's not. He doesn't like that Malfoy continues to make fun of his family, so that's understandable. Even though these past few months he's only making fun of Harry specifically, but still.
"Since—" He turned to see a speechless Ron. Jaw dropped like hot potato and eyes wider than the split on the red sea. "Ron? Are you alright?" Harry asked, holding his tiny chuckle. Ron finally blinked. She smiled fondly, "Give him some time to... react"
Where are the teachers here? Why aren't they stopping them? That's because they're watching from above while sipping their freshly brewed cup of tea.
at the clear sky above them. No pollution, unlike the city I live in. Draco stopped next to him. He watched as Harry stared at his view. His view was Malfoy, by the way.
"What"
, that would do the trick.
"Of course not!" Draco said, sounding so obvious. Pansy nodded, "He doesn't even eat candy because he says it's bad for his health!"
"Hey," Hermione smiled as she closed the compartment door behind her. Okay, y'all know who they are so I really don't need to explain.
Blaise and Pansy followed behind them, staring what they think he's staring. Ron squinted and nodded, "Yeah. But I'm pretty sure I just saw someone moving"
Draco arched an eyebrow, "Shameless snogging is your main reason, Potter?" Harry opened his mouth only for it to close again. "If that's the case then count me in. I'm reading to hang a sign; Bitch, I'm gay"
Draco quickly pulled his into a kiss and smiled, "I know. I believe you." He whispered, "Fuck them, Harry. Please. Not literally. But still. They're just trying to take you down because they're fucking jealous they're not the main character of this goddamn series." Harry giggled. "Win this tournament. Show that motherfucker your reverse card. Fucking laugh at their face when you won that cup, okay? You've disarmed the dark lord before! Dragons would be an easy task"
The war wasn't that bad. People overreacted on it but the war that happened far away from a school district filled with underage wizards was actually not that bad. It was like watching American Football, but with magic.
reminder: this whole story is mostly filled with jokes. so, don't take things too seriously.
"So am I. But I'm still not part of the candy family—or any family, really. Because, you know, dead parents... and all..."
But honestly, who could blame him. He's too preoccupied trying not to stare at a certain Slytherin boy through the seas of students. He's glowing, how can he not. Plus, his hair. He
"Don't tell me he's Harry Potter's date"
All three are back in the common room. It's a bit late at night and most of the students are already in their rooms. The three sat down with their textbooks, trying to finish a Charms assignment due tomorrow. In trying he meant, trying to convince Hermione to share her hard work with them.
Draco stepped back and smiled. "Mother, this is—well, you already know who he is"
Granger laughed again,  "Yes, Harry! I won't!" Turning again to Ron, who quickly gaped them. "Of course I won't as well! Unless it's like... Draco Malfoy or something like that," Ron and Hermione chuckled.
, both planting their gaze into each others' eyes. "I'm gonna miss this." He added, brushing the hair from his boyfriend's face with his thumb.
Harry laughed as he punched the air as if it had upset Draco. "Yes! Now that is what I wanna hear!" High fiving him which caused him to smile widely at his reaction. "I will go to the dance with you, Harry Potter" Potter smiled at that. "But in one condition,"
"What?!"
"Well I got cigs," She said, mostly to herself. Pansy walked forward, standing next to Draco. She cleared her throat and took out her pack of cigarettes. "I have some. Would you like one? Or all if you want" She offered, extending her arm. Midna turned to her, eyeing the pack in her hand. So desperate for a smoke right now, she nodded. "Why, yes. That'd honestly be lovely. Thank you so much, dear"
When the last day turned around, both boys met in the courtyard. It was pretty chilly out in late October. Harry only had his thin coat, yet he somehow managed to feel hotter than normal. Draco would agree.
The two continued their bickerings throughout the night before Harry had enough and slammed himself inside his room. He wouldn't admit it but he needed that. That little tight air out of his lungs. It made him realize that most of what he's doing with Draco was merely a rivalry hatred. It was something else. Maybe a distraction? Or some type of familiarity after the events of not knowing what to come. Either way, it was something Harry just couldn't place a finger on.
McGonagall continued, "I thought there was no way you two were together so the three of us made a bet. I obviously lost the moment Snape told us about... well, what just happened. So it's left between these two"
needs to touch that luscious hair goddammit. He pinches his inner lips, trying so damn hard not to smile when Draco made fun of him with silly gestures from across the big hall.
Harry turned around to see Draco walking down the stairs.
The two quickly let go as Voldemort waved his hand, unlocking the door. Both not really noticing when Voldemort locked it. Probably when they were in the middle of lip fucking.
Fucking stinks like The Cursed Child: Part I & II.
"Wonderful!" The dark lord smiled widely at the boy before strutting back to the front of the class. "Okay, children! Turn to page 394!"
"He's asking about you and Draco," Ron told him. His eyes were equally as heavy as Harry. He pushed the food on his plate carelessly—which isn't a very Ron thing to do.
Harry chuckled at the comment, "I've always had it in me"
The poor boy nodded frantically, still standing where he stood. With one last glare, Draco took a step back and turned to Harry. "I don't buy it," He said. "We should just kill him"
Kinda like Romeo and Juliet. Just a lot more, gayer.
Hermione turned to him with a smug smile. "Is that one of the things you concluded from your Viktor Krum obsession?"
"For fuck sake, mate"
"Yes, my boy. And every other day, I suppose. Apparently, a lot of the kids hate me. I mean, I get it. I'm not really as good-looking as you two but I'm not THAT bad" He shared, which made both the boys chuckle. "Dumbledore asked if I can guard detention. Lesser kids would try to break the rules knowing I'm the one in charge. Which come to think of it, I really don't mind. I really have nothing else to do." He shrugged. "Since it's only you two here, just do whatever you want."
Ron rolled his eyes. "Fuck off," in his thick British accent. So it sounded more of a
"And dignity" Blaise chimed in.
The boy arched his neck to the side, seeing the very visibly red mark Snape was talking about. He blushed at the thought of their conversation earlier and quickly flicked his wand for the fifth time. "Lovebitus deletus?"
"Please, you can call me Narcissa—or Draco's mom. Whichever you prefer," She shrugged and smiled. Harry chuckled lightly, "Thank you, Narcissa," He said carefully.
"Hey!" Ron snapped his neck at him. Draco looked around before turning back to him, whispering, "I date Harry, not his friends"
Draco snapped his neck at Harry. "What are you doing? Trying to get us killed?"
"Through Voldemort. He has this weird magical gadget so we can talk face-to-face." He explained.
"So, Harry." Hermione started once she put down her drink. "Do you have anyone to take to the Yule Ball?"
"An idiot to dance with you, that's for sure" He replied, eyes
Hermione was in a beautiful baby blue dress, kinda like Cinderella. Not Belle. Yellow's too bright, even for her liking. Ron helped her out by casting a little twinkle spell to brighten up her look, in which he spent days trying to learn. You know, as a little surprise.
Hermione shook her head with a chuckle. "So?" Ron asked, "I thought we're going to confront him about it?"
Harry gasped and chuckled. "Well in my defence, it is quite cold outside"
"You're going to that weird craft store, aren't you?" He sighed before catching up to her despite the cold snow telling him otherwise. "Why can't we just go to Honeydukes instead?" That was the last strand of complaint they heard from him before he walked away, leaving the two boys walking silently side by side.
Harry turned and furrowed, "Godson?!"
"No, because I look hotter eating an apple rather than a chocolate candy" He stopped and pointed at Ron, who was happily trying a candy sample in front of Honeydukes. "Exhibit A"
, sending Draco back into his mother's womb. Fucking hell, Harry. You did it again.
Harry giggled before he asked, "So, how did it go? With you and your mother" Their conversation a few nights prior somehow pushed him to go and talk to his mother. He doesn't know how but he promised himself to tell them,
He rolled his eyes and flew next to him, who waited and watched. "Of course not. I have it all planned." He waved his hand. "I'm gonna dump your ashes in cookie dough and eat it with my next boyfriend while we're spending all your money"
Hermione sighed, "Carry on, Harry"
"Alright, that's enough" Ron got up, pushing the only textbook he brought inside his bag. "I'm off to bed. I can't deal with all the Malfoy this, Malfoy that"
C: "Stop with the fucking pop culture reference, Sasha!"
"Yes, I wasn't!" She exclaimed with a small smile that she can't keep to herself. "I honestly have no idea how to react to that."
"Oh. You do." The girl stared. Ron smiled widely, "Awesome, mate! Who is it?" Both waiting to see who the secret boy he's been fancying lately. The guy that made Harry lose focus in class, the guy that made him blush madly when they hinted and teased on who it might be, the guy that made them question his sexuality, the guy he
. He watched as the kids and staff danced
"Yo, watch it!" Blaise quickly pulled him away. Most of the Slytherins went quiet while others were pleased.
"What?" Harry turned to him. In his grumpy tired voice, he said, "You said she's 90% correct. The rest is 10%. It's simple math. Please don't start a debate."
Draco snapped his neck. "Don't you fucking dare."
"Even if he's a homophobic piece of shit who deserves nothing but torcher and death?" Pansy asked genuinely.
"No... We're trying to let him know that if he is what we think he is, that we are totally fine with it. But we can't push him to admit that he is or what we
The rest of the boys snickered. I'm pretty sure he lowkey enjoys it.
"I see you haven't made any progress yourself. So, since neither of us has a date? What do you have in mind?" Draco hoping to let this bet go now that he's exposed to be cheating.
happy. Blocking all the negative shit his brain keeps pushing him to worry about. He's here. He's with Harry. Only him. No one else. Not even me. He's
The table roared in laughter. "Scared, Potter?"
Snape and McGonagall jumped a bit at the sudden sound from the back. They let out a breath of relief once they saw it was just the iconic Albus Dumbledore. "Severus' favorite student is bullying your favorite student" She informed the headmaster.
i don't know if you know them, but their names are draco malfoy and harry potter.
Well no shit, Albus. "I'm—" In the corner of his eyes, he saw a worried-looking Hermione, standing in the front row. Ron nods, signalling him to take Hermione since they can't see Draco anywhere. Harry was about to until he heard gasps and whispers from around the room.
. He took off his iconic glasses before he heard a knocking sound. He turned his neck towards the door, waiting for someone to walk in. But nobody did.
He chuckled and looked down, thinking before he spoke. "You're the tournament winner. People are going to be looking at us"
They all laughed as they catch their breath. Hermione breathed and laughed, "We did it"
"I still think he's gay though," Dean said with a smug smile.
"I just didn't want you to worry—"
There was a slight shift of wind in the tip of Draco's finger—he can feel it. Especially after walking in uncomfortable silence. Yeah, he needs to say something. "Is.. mother here?" He said before Lucius can begin to utter a word.
"Why'd you say that?" Draco asked.
He kept his eyes on the floor, shaking his head with a shrug. "He doesn't know that yet," He said. He finally looked up to meet the boys' iconic eyes. Softer he said, "But you'd still be with him, right? Even if he's a big fat coward"
plastered on his face. "Did mother forced you to say this?" He blurted out genuinely.
"Oh! So we're friends then?" Pansy teased. Hermione chuckled, "I mean, sure" She shrugged with a smile. "Except you Draco. We still hate you" Hermione turned to Draco half-heartedly.
Draco told him all about it, in which he was very thankful for. He was low-key already thinking of a backup plan if this all turns to shit—which is the murder of Lucius Malfoy. Thank Merlin he doesn't have to execute that, even though that would be a cool plot to write about. lmao.
Options: A. 2 B. 3 C. 10 D. 825
"Where is he?" McGonagall asked. Harry shook his head and shrugged. "I—I don't know,"
But they weren't the only ones laughing. Draco walked out with his friends, laughing at some stupid joke Pansy told them. The wrinkles by his eyes when he laughs sent butterflies in the pit of Harry's stomach—or it could be the pudding he ate earlier, but still, it's cute.
, not bothering if it made no sense.
The latter couldn't help but smile. "Well, hello to you too, Potter." He paused, "Did you receive my letters?"
So, with that in mind, he simply replied. "No."
"Very witty of you, Malfoy. That must be the reason your crush doesn't like you back" Harry is, again, aware of the irony. Draco just smirked and retorted back. "Continue talking, Potter, then maybe your date might just actually show up"
"Second of all, yes. I understand." Harry said, continuing to play with Malfoy's soft hair. Not a lot of people are allowed to touch his hair. In not a lot he means like, only himself. Harry's an exception because he loves when his hair's being touched. By Harry. Not anyone else.
Harry laughed before slowing down a bit so Draco can catch up. He threw his arms wide open and smiled at the wind.
Hermione sighed. "It's Granger, Professor." He was still trying his best to keep his cool with muggle-borns, even if it means pronouncing their name wrong. Intentionally? We're not sure. But Hermione is okay with it. He's trying and that's what counts. "We'll be waiting outside," She told Harry in which he nodded in response. "Yeah, I'll meet you there. Just need to.. pack"
danced right next to them. "Draco, you son of a —"
He quickly chuckled unevenly, like Harry does when he tries to lie. "S–Snogging? No way. They... dislike each other—"
Draco furrowed, "Wait, so Harry would've been called Harry Snape then? If Professor Snape did marry Lily Evans"
"It's Potter again, is it?" Blaise teased. Draco's blush made him smirk. "As always"
stepping away. "Fine. I'm sorry"
Snape turned to him, "Son, we make bets on every student here. How the hell do you think keeps us entertained in this dark gloomy castle?"
short when they heard Harry's name
Her sentence was stopped by the sudden appearance of none other than Headmaster Dumbledore. "Sorry for the interruption. But I'm gonna need to speak to Professor McGonagall outside"
Harry shook his head as he smiled fondly, "You wish. You should've thanked me as well. It takes two to do the tango"
"Which would most likely turn out to be a guy," Zabini said cooly, in which Draco chuckled in response.
Hermione giggled, "Come on. She must be downstairs" They heard her loud and clear and let her guide them down the stairs. "Wait," Pansy suddenly said.
He hasn't done as much as Harry has done, like winning a war or something courageous along that line, but he is very attractive. He is dashing. He has beautiful silver blond hair, smokey grey eyes, porcelain skin, THAT jawline that even math teachers continuously try so badly not to measure its angle.
Snape shook his head, still watching them from next to Dumbledore. "They honestly have the weirdest relationship"
Harry. She held his shoulder and reminded him, "Stop it, Harry. You're gonna get detention again"
It only took about 10 seconds for Draco to realized he was soaked in salty rainwater. Yet, instead of commenting on how he just ruined his overly-priced trousers, he instead made a different comment. "You're gonna get a bloody cold if you don't decide soon enough to change. Just use one of mine if you're that sad of your closet. I know I am"
"Boring!" Snape retorted, "That lie is as visible as Draco's hickey."
"Aw, that's so sweet!" Hermione cooed next to Ron. He nodded in agreement. "Speaking of Draco..."
Wouldn't dare to consider
"Everything" Voldemort replied shortly, sipping his butterbeer loudly as Snaped gaped him dramatically. Dumbledore turned to Draco and asked, "Would you still snog Harry if he looked more like Snape?"
"Listen to me, Draco. I know that we don't have the best father-son relationship. But I'm gonna try. This is me trying" Draco smiled tightly. "I don't get it, I don't understand. But if that's who you are, if that's what makes you happy, then so be it."
Draco turned around and flicked his wand at the adults chasing them, causing them to levitate off the ground. He sneakered before Harry had to drag that boy out of here. They all successfully ran out of the pub, still well and alive.
"I know." He said coolly, "I'd just probably take a random girl out. There is — undeniably — a large assortment of fit birds who adores me" Draco smirked, teasing the boy in his arms. Harry added, "And fit blokes, too, I'm guessing. Me, being one of them" He muttered confidently, leaving another peck on his lips. "But you have asked one of them?"
"Don't make me regret even thinking of inviting you here!" Hermione scowled the Slytherin.
Hagrid and Flitwick walked in from the other room, assuming it leads to the kitchen. He smiled widely at the sight of Harry and Draco, "Why, hello!"
That's a lie. He has been considering. But after that, he would rather die in a pit.
"You know what else is beautiful?" Draco smiled at Harry.
"I'm going to kill if he is Harry's date"
The main character of the franchise furrowed at them. "Okay, this is all just weird. You guys are our teachers! And you're making a bet on us?"
"Harry! You—You look great!" She complimented, placing a gaze on his suit. Harry looked down and thanked her. As if Hermione herself doesn't look great.
Harry smiled.
Harry can't help but smile, "You idiot! Of course not. I trust him to do the right thing. I hope" He looked back at Neville who was just blinking. He sighed and walked up to him, "Can you please promise not to tell anyone—even Hermione and Ron? We really don't want people to know yet—"
"Saving you, of course," Ron said as if it's the most barbaric question Harry has ever asked. "I hope it wasn't that much of a hell being here with him"
. Well, that went smoothly. "Y-Yeah, it is."
"Suits me. Not much of a healer than it is to a therapist." He could feel Malfoy's slight smirk grazing upon his face. "You're lucky, mate"
. Flying around as if there's no tomorrow.
The time jump here is probably like a two or three days after what happened in the hall. There were little buzzes about those shit but they couldn't give less fuck. It's gonna die down eventually. Harry said it himself, we can't control what other people think of us, just what we think about ourselves.
to have an extremely huge crush on. "Just promise me you guys won't freak out"
"That's bullocks coming from your mouth, Malfoy. He will come to his senses eventually, so will you. He ruined our lives, he wouldn't think twice to ruin yours if it means protecting his precious hero title—"
"No, after Dumbledore retires—yes, now!"
He smiled widely and laughed, "I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. Yeah, you're right. I'm gay. But also not gay. Because I still like girls—"
Pop Quiz! How many boys and girls have rejected Draco Malfoy?
"Yeah, but I'm not the Gryffindor around here. Where's your Gryffindor bravery, Potter? Lost it with your dignity on your way here?" The group just smiled at their new-found entertainment. Harry chuckled. "You're too desperate to win this thing, Malfoy. Pretending to like your friend? That's what a coward does"
"What?"
Hermione looked around and bent closer. "You and Draco"
"You wouldn't have done anything if it weren't for me" Harry replied with a joke. They let go of their hands as the pair continued flying further away from the castle. Draco nodded, "That's true. All the dumb shit I ever did is because of you"
"Yeah."
The storage room they're hiding in is located under the wooden staircase, across the toilets. The bar was situated a few feet beside the toilets, so it's not too far for Harry's poor eyesight. In this case Harry, I feel you. Draco turned and smirked at Harry, in which Harry just stared in obliviousness. "You know how I always get what I want, right Potter?"
He could hear a few laughs in the background as he smirked annoyingly at the nameless bitch. The latter scowled, "What did daddy have to say now that his only heir is gay? Ruining the reputation of the whole generation just like that. Must be a nice story to tell your kid. Oh wait, you wouldn't be able to have any"
McGonagall got up from her seat and walked to them. "Tell us what?"
"What?! Sorry, I can't hear you from all the way here" He teased from afar, even if Harry's 99% sure that Draco can 100% hear him. Harry rolled his eyes, mumbling, "Let's see who's got the bigger mouth after this"
"You're making assumptions, Hermione" Harry stated firmly, "I know who he is. He will never hurt me" You dumbass Harry Potter. Ron and Hermione turned to him and furrowed. "Know who he is?"
"What is it now, Pans?" Blaise turned to him. She turned and groans quietly. "Why didn't anyone close the goddamn window?"
McGonagall furrowed. "See what? Your students are fighting!"
"Don't act that surprised, Malfoy" Ron retorted with a scoff. "That's what most of the Durmstrang kids do anyways"
bumped into Draco on his way out. "Watch where you're going!" Harry was the first to say.
"Unlike me?" Harry smirked. "Are you saying you were prepared?" Harry turned to him with a smile. Draco faked a frown and shrugged, "Possibly"
Without realizing, his obnoxiously loud voice was heard from outside. Professor Snape walked in—or rather pushed over—inside the classroom. He hissed at Dumbledore before turning his attention back to the class. He walked in, face as iconic as ever, over to Dumbledore who was waiting on the other side of the aisle.
GAY THOUGHTS
Granger rolled her eyes and continued to look around the great hall. Scanning through the room, trying to pick out a guy Harry could take to the Yule Ball with him. Her face lit up like Ron's when he sees food. "Oh, how about Cedric?" She suggested, eyeing the Hufflepuff who just walked in with a mate of his.
"Do you have evidence that it's Draco?" Harry arched his eyebrow as if he's challenging her. She pursed her lips. Harry sighed, "I gotta go," he said before he got up and walked away. He couldn't deal with that assumption in his head right now. Their short conversation might have planted a 0.1% possibility in his head, not gonna lie. But he knew better not to let that take over his head. Just as he was about to leave the hall, Hermione's voice bellowed through the walls of the great hall. "I knew it!"
"Without further ado," Fucking hell.
Neville blinked. Draco pointed his wand at him, "Did you hear what he said?!"
Ron mumbled a short apology before the muggle-born turned to Harry, eyes turning softer. "You know you can tell us anything, right?" She said carefully.
"I do but—"
The blond shrugged, "I don't know. Wherever you fools go, I suppose."
C: "What? Be themselves?"
He sat by the window one night in the common room, looking out to the clear lake water. His mind is racing and he can't manage to fall asleep.
Ron and Harry laughed. Hermione turned to Draco. "So, where'd you wanna go?"
"Shoot"
"You caused this?" He asked.
"He's like Hermoine, now?" Ron asked. Hermione glared at him, overhearing their conversation. Harry chuckled and shook his head, "No, Voldemort and the Order agreed to let Voldemort drink A-Reid Bulle. It's some sort of potion to deal with his mental instability. That's what's causing him to be so... nice"
Just two guys casually walking side by side in the cold December winter. They have no idea how this supposed romantic scenario became awfully awkward for them. Draco has put on the coat that his father bought for him last year. He turned to the boy next to him, hands stuffed inside the pockets of his coat as he silently kicked the snow underneath his feet. Harry could feel the stare grazing his cheeks as he looked up to meet them. He blushed with the cold air.
stand there acting like it's nothing! You—You"
"You two are smartasses. Go think of something!" Snape said easily.
Very low coming from you, Malfoy
"And we should've known! You're a dramatic bitch in need of a dramatic entrance for a dramatic reveal!" Pansy managed to make Draco laugh. "So of course you would pull that shit, even to us"
is not that bad when he showed it to Hermione. They spent days trying to tweak it up
and the
"Really? Am I not the type?" Harry asked curiously before Draco shrugged in response. "Yeah, I was meaning to ask. What did you think of me before we dated?" He genuinely wanted to know. Weird he has never asked this before. Draco shrugged, "I don't know really. Well at first I was completely pissed off that you rejected my friend request"
"Alright, that's enough—" Professor McGonagall walked up to them, again, trying to disperse the crowd, again. Seeing that it's not always effective of her just flocking her arms like a bird, Voldemort decided to take this matter into his own crisp hands. Now, this. This is effective as everyone went dead silent.
Noticing the confused lines between his eyebrows eased something out of Hermione as she chuckled. "God, I wish. I'd usually take credit in masterminding plans, but this is all on Ron." She turned and smiled at him. Ron shrugged, "It's easy once you talk to the right person about the right things. Making a deal with him isn't
Okay, that's enough.
at his boyfriend. Who
"You're insufferable, you know that, Potter?" Draco breathed heavily, plopping his back beside Harry. Breathing as heavily, Harry managed to let out a chuckle, "That's not what you said earlier today"
Draco rolled his eyes with a smile and fastening his pace to catch up with him.
"What is going on?!" McGonagall came walking in. The Slytherins looked down and one by one went back to their seat. She turned to the trio for an explanation. Hermione told her what she knew. She sighed and called upon the Slytherins—including Draco—to meet with Dumbledore.
The two spent the entire night talking about mostly random stuff. The silent giggles at night didn't seem to disturb any of the other Slytherin roommates. It was a useless conversation, but they adored each other's company.
"You're in charge of detention today, sir?" Harry asked, arms crossed on the table.
The green-eyed boy looked over his shoulder and smiled as he scanned the loud and fucked up class of his. He would describe it as the visuality of his brain in the middle of the night—being the reason why he can't fall asleep as easily as he used to. "I'm pretty sure they're too preoccupied at the moment"
"No. Fucking. Way."
Do you want the truth or the slightly dumb answer?
"Just tell them you two fought again. See? Easy" Voldemort shrugged, so did the boys. After a quick thank you and apologies, Voldemort walked them outside the room. He closed the door behind him and turned to them. "Now go back to your dorms. It's very late"
"Preposterous! There's obviously," She turned and saw Draco and Harry in the middle of the courtyard, doing their public sermon to the congregation who caught their attention. "Of course, it's them. Why do they have to keep fighting?"
Snape invited everyone for some tea as they talked about life and shit like that. Harry told them about the Triwizard Tournament, and how Draco was behind most of his success—other than Hermione, of course. And Ron. He's like next best thing for moral support.
She took one out from the pack, letting Pansy keep the rest. Midna took out her wand and light it up with the tip, sighing in relief as she took the first blow from the cigarette. "Fuck, I needed this."
These idiots, for fuck sake mate. Speaking of idiots, Harry isn't being so subtle with that lip biting and crinkled eyes, fighting his urge not to smile. Ron furrowed and turned around. "Who's there?"
It isn't Draco Malfoy if he isn't about checking Harry out. He bit his lower lip before commenting, "Oh my! Is it Halloween already?"
" He added.
The old lady stopped snoring and everyone went dead silent. Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Hermione were all just thinking about ways to get out of here if they got caught. While Harry and Ron's mind just went
"It's a long story" Harry started. He chuckled as he watched Ron covering his face with his hands, "Oh my god!" He groaned.
Unlike Hermione, Ron did not buy this bullshit. "What do you mean you're not—"
But as much as they hate to admit it, these two know each other way more than others ever will.  The first time their friends noticed this is when the group — which includes a couple of Gryffindor students, three Slytherins, and a Luna Lovegood — all sat down at a pub in Hogsmeade. How they became friends was no one's idea. Being the only few who got back for their eight-year after the war has forced them into forming somewhat of a friend group.
"That's what I said" Draco shrugged.
"Let's say Potter can't keep it in his pants," Draco said while looking at Harry. Noticing the weird looks on Ron and Hermione, he put back the Hating Malfoy mask and snarled, "Shut it, Malfoy"
Hermione stared at him, "You're kidding me, right?"
However, what he didn't know is that the feeling is mutual. All with the same doubts yet a bit faster in realization. But little did they know, they might just have to admit that out loud.
Draco turned to Ron and smirked "Yeah. He was so loud—" Ron gasped as Hermione glared at him. Harry pursed his lips and smacked his arm, "Stop that! No. We did nothing"
Maybe. I don't know. Possibly.
Ron opened his DADA textbook carelessly from the middle and was visibly surprised when he accidentally opens the exact page asked. He was so shook that he shook Harry's shoulder in shook. "Look! I didn't realize and it just opened to the exact page!"
Both laughed. Harry watched as his boyfriend took off again. His pale white skin matched the glowing bright stars as his hair caresses the wind. It was a very calming view. If only he had a camera with him right now to capture this moment and hang it up across his porta-potty. So he can stare at him while he shits. "Why so slow, Potter?" Draco stopped and shouted from afar, snapping Harry back into reality. Thanks a lot, Draco. "Still thinking what you would do with your life once I'm dead?"
Snape shrugged, "I just have a gaydar"
"Come, sit" Dumbledore offered as he walked back to his table. He waved his hand and the set of wizard's chess closed up, before tidying itself inside one of his cupboards. "This is some serious talk here," He added. Harry and Draco sat across Dumbledore, having no idea where this conversation might carry them. Are they gonna tell everyone? Is this how they're gonna come out?
"Couldn't agree more" He replied, keeping his eyes locked on his book.
So the tournament went on like the movie. Harry fought a dragon that isn't Draco and didn't die since I still need him to be Draco's husband. He smiled widely when he completed his first task. People surprisingly were cheering and congratulating him, when he's sure a few days ago they were booing him. Hm. Hypocrites.
They were on their way to their second task. Cedric paid back the favor by helping Harry with his second task. But even with the help from a hot senior Harry still couldn't figure out the meaning inside that egg shit.
Draco quickly reacted and got off his seat, holding Harry by his shoulder. "Harry, Harry. Listen to me," He searched for his eyes, "Get out" He said sternly, but with a hint of admiration in his voice as his way of appreciating the caring effort.
He smiled softly and kissed him. There's a lot of kissing here in this scene. Sorry. "Harry, you know I can't. I–I still don't know how my friends would react to all this. Hell, being with you"
Is that a threat or a promise, Potter?
then a fuck. Draco laughed, "Good one, wanker!" He said as he walked away, followed by his little Slytherin followers. Granger—that's Hermione's surname if you don't know yet—can't help but rolled her eyes as the blond finally left them. "That disgusting little prat! Why does he keep popping everywhere we go?"
"What?!" Ron turned to him, bulging his eyes out. Like it's the craziest thing he's ever heard. They laughed. "I'm sorry?" Draco chuckled and shrugged. Pansy smiled and pulled the cigarette in between her lips. Not gonna lie, Ron thinks she looks fucking hot like that. Hermione agrees. Wait, what.
Harry's chest eased slightly as he chuckled, "I've said this a billion times. I'm fine with you two going together" After years being the third wheel, he's pretty much used to it.
"You got to be fucking kidding me right, Harry?!" He turned to Harry, both turning to him. "H–He's Draco Malfoy! He's been torturing us for the last five years!"
before taking a step back. He bowed down like a heavenly prince he is, "May I have this dance?"
the one who just got dumped by a Raven girl.
Hermione blinked. Ron sighed, "10%"
Harry walked towards the great hall, per usual like every normal Hogwarts citizen when he heard his name being called. He prayed to fucking Merlin it wasn't some kid who's trying to shut him off with homophobic slurs because it's still 9 AM and he's not ready to kill someone just yet.
They're both seekers for respective house teams, which makes the whole bickering easier to do. The whole school knew about this and found it very entertaining how they would argue about the simplest things. Things like how stupid their hair looked, how their eyes glistened way too loudly, how stupid their choice of outwear they're wearing — that's mostly coming from Draco — and other stuff they might be able to jabber in.
Or because she's actually gay? We don't know.
"Hi, Hagrid!" Hagrid jumped slightly and smiled when he saw Draco suddenly appearing in front of him. Hands tucked behind his back, smile as innocent as it gets. Harry wasn't expecting him to be there and was surprised when he heard a very familiar voice from behind Hagrid's tall figure.
"Draco," Harry reminded, with a low voice that makes his original voice ten times sexier. Draco's jaw clenched as he threatens the poor Gryffindor who also did not sign up for this. Eventually, he stepped back, following Harry's orders. Harry popped up from behind Draco and smiled weakly, "Please. Don't tell anyone."
They two smiled sheepishly, letting the cold act as the reason for their pink tinted cheeks. Forgetting their little audience who tumbled back in happiness when the two most wanted criminals kiss in the middle of the courtyard. "Get it!" Blaise couldn't help but shout from the other end of the yard, followed by a symphony of laughter and blushing boyfriends. "Hm, yes. So you bribed him with a kiss. Classic, Potter"
It didn't take long before Voldemort noticed the hand
"Alright. That's enough from you, Dean Thomas" Seamus got up and pulled him away with him.
The group collectively grimaced. "Oh my dark lord" Ron mumbled in disgust.
"It's not really about us," Ron said. Hermione nodded. Harry has no idea where this shit's going —
It's the weekend, the day after the dance. The night ended with Harry dragging Draco out of that populated hall and fucking him senseless. Just a casual night in Hogwarts. Half of this is caused by the alcohol a kid
"Parkinson."
"Promised Snape?" Blaise furrowed before having to be explained again by Hermione. The group looked back inside the pub. Ronald scratched the back of his head, "How can we get in?"
Hermione nodded, holding his hand and smiled. Ron then continued to ask, "But what are you exactly? You said before you're gay but not gay?"
Harry laughed lightly, face glowing brightly. It makes Draco's heart clench at the sight. Mine too. Harry looked at the red mark he left on his neck earlier and blushed, "Oh. Sorry about that"
"You've been here before?" Harry asked, eyes still looking up.
"Harry Potter" She smiled. "It's very nice to meet you"
But poor Harry is a loser and he has no idea who to take.
, smiling whilst caressing his shoulder. Harry smiled and thanked her before walking down the stairs to meet his friends.
.. slow down?"
Hermione nodded and chuckled, shaking her hand. "Yes, I'm Hermione. Hermione Granger"
"It's okay! Nobody saw me." He looked down at his cloak. "I mean, obviously" He looked back up at him. "I just wanted to check up on you. See if you're okay. After all that..."
"They're not you"
"It's probably just their owl, Giotto." Draco said, "Don't worry, he already knows who I am"
"Harry Potter?!" Another friend gasped, "You shouldn't be here!"
? Called? How?"
Harry laughed again. Hermione shook her head with a small smile on her face. She turned to Harry and asked, "So, what does he think about going? He's okay now? How about his friends? Do they know?"
"It's Hermoine, Professor Voldy—" Harry nudged her. "mort. Professor Voldemort." She quickly corrected herself. "We haven't actually finished chapter fifteen, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation. We can't just skip to page 394"
Harry eventually calmed down and sighed. "Yes, thank you. Don't let the rumor cause you to think like this. I've been your friend for five years, the least you can do is trust me"
Draco also has six senses when it comes to knowing where Harry is. He looked up and saw the boy smiling at him. "Oh, you again." And with a snap of a finger, he was quick to change his whole facade. Harry just stared, putting his smile back behind his head, pulling off that 'annoyed' look once again. "Ever thought of never showing up again, Potter?"
"Me! People—" he paused, "I didn't know who did it, okay? I wasn't the one who put my name in the goblet and I didn't know who did so you can't call me a liar—"
"Are you saying you're embarrassed by me?" Harry asked, making sure he had his teasing mode on so he knows he's not serious about the question. He wouldn't careless if Draco's embarrassed of him. He would too if he had to date himself. As expected, he quickly denied it. "No, no. That's not what I meant. I'm just saying that.. my friends might not react as well as your friends did"
"Harry Snape!" Dumbledore exclaimed before the whole room burst in laughter, including Snape and Harry. "Well, first of all, I wouldn't have named my child Harry," Snape told the room of professors.
Harry whispered back to Dumbledore, leaning his body a tad closer. "Can we just... continue with the reward giving first?" he asked. Everyone
Now, that. Yeah, Nah uh, motherfucker.
"Then, maybe I should show you" His voice gets deeper, both not entirely realizing that they're just inches away from each other.
"See you guys later?"
"Come on guys, we haven't got all day" Harry reminded them, looking through the window. "Why did you have to promise Snape for her autograph anyway?" Blaise finally asked.
Ah, Tumblr girl. What an era.
"Did any of your smart nerd friends found anything?" Draco asked, leaning and resting his one hand on the table Harry's sitting on, looking down at him.
. Everybody clapped and he smiled. "To be honest, I haven't actually prepared a speech for this because in the movie I didn't say shit. First of all, we would like to congratulate our fellow champions. Victor Krum of Durmstrang," Everyone turned to him and clapped. He smiled
to do this"
"Just take it," Harry whispered to his boyfriend. Boyfriend? I really don't now. But it's enough to make Draco obliged and tentatively tries a spoon of the red stew. He's like me, we both wouldn't want to try something that doesn't look visually appealing — Harry being solid proof.
Harry let out a laugh, which always manages to plant a smile on Draco's face. The wind was getting slightly stronger by the minute, so they decided to warm themselves inside the castle. Harry helped him down before walking back to the empty hallway. Well, at least they thought it was empty. "Where do you think you're going, Malfoy?"
leave these idiots alone for one night?"
"Now." He said sternly. Draco turned to Harry who smiled assuringly, "I'll be okay."
"Of course it's not true!" Harry quickly denied. "Why would I be dating that... little... lump" He stuttered a bit, trying to find the right straight words. He got up with a sigh, not even bothering to look at his friends. "I gotta go"
. Draco chased after him but slowed down as he watched the boy
Harry blinked. So, it's true then. People are already noticing how dumb their whole
Well.
A gay joke. Classic. "It's not the homophobia he's worried about" Draco tried to keep his breathing steady as Harry strutted with the most annoying hot smirk Draco has ever seen. Fuck. "So? Just embarrassed to be seen with you?" He was still able to reply.
"Fleur Delacour of Beauxbatons," Everyone clapped once again. She smiled
. He's thinking of his father again, he can sense that. He tried his best to calm him down. He scooted his broom and his butt closer to Malfoy and placed a soft kiss on the back of his hand.
"I thought you already had one this month—" Ron's comment made Hermione glare before Harry realized what he meant and smacked the back of his head. "Ow! What?" Ron looked at them while rubbing the back of his neck.
Harry pulled his head back a bit from the flooding questions. ".....well," He began before he noticed someone standing behind him. He turned around to see Draco in his comfortable muggle clothing. "Yeah, hi." He looked at Harry's friends, "Mind if I steal your friend for a moment?"
The Gryffindor girl shook her head. "Of course not." Though, it's not like she hasn't considered it. By the way, don't smoke, kids. Pansy giggled, walking closing to her. "You're Hermione, aren't you?" She offered her hand, "I'm Pansy. Your friend's boyfriend's friend"
Harry's first step is to start texting Draco. Because, why not?
. "Fucking hell, Draco" he mumbled, head looking around him.
Harry turned and smiled at the Ravenclaw. "Hi, Luna" He greeted
Of course, he was searching for Malfoy. Harry plopped down on the table Draco was standing beside and pulled his hair back in frustration. This is not the first time Harry and Draco spent in the library—sitting five feet apart because they're not gay. They've been trying to figure this out for days—two—and they still found nothing other than their undying love for each other—but that shit's useless at the moment.
"Yeah! That was what I was gonna tell you. My friends and I—Blaise and Pansy—saw dragons being flown in here. I mean, you didn't hear it from me but I have a feeling that has something to do with the tournament"
The commotion was Draco's opportunity to get back to his place next to Blaise, a fellow Slytherin who's as hot as he is. Harry laughed as McGonagall walked in surprised to see a pig in the middle of her class. She sighed, "Of course there's gonna be a pig in my class"
hard"
"Isn't that what you're doing right now? With Harry Potter"
"Not everything is our responsibility" Draco mumbled. Harry nodded, "Yeah. Kinda like right now, really. We can't control what people think of us, just what we think of ourselves"
Harry turned to McGonagall asking her for answers to the visible questions on their faces. She sighed and explained, "We've been keeping an eye on you two since you two got here. Professor Snape and Headmaster Dumbledore made a bet that you two have been.. smooching butts"
Their conversation was overheard by Dean and Seamus — two Gryffindors who are quite close with Harry — sat across him, next to Hermione. "Hey, mate! So? Is it true? About the rumor?"
"Well of course not, Ron." She quickly turned to him. "I'm not bloody stupid. Even a blind man can see him checking out particular boys. Or how his eyes twinkle every time Cedric walks by. Or Malfoy, weirdly"
The ex-Tom Riddle can't help but smile back as he received the vial of potion. "Thank you. I appreciate that. Was I too rude before?" He asked quieter, hoping the students couldn't catch their conversation. Snape chuckled, "Oh, no. You were wonderful" He gave a pat on the back before walking back. "Keep up the good work!" He said one last time and disappearing out of the class.
asking" Draco shook his head with a smile. The pair took Voldemort's and Snape's hand and pulled them into the dance floor.
The class stayed quiet. He furrowed and flopped his arms back down. "Why do you all look so depressed? You know what, I shouldn't have asked" He smiled widely and asked again, "Miss me?" He scanned the room before landing on the golden boy, sitting in between Ron and Hermione. He smirked and walked closer. "How about you, dear? Miss me?"
"Draco?" Both turned, surprised to see Pansy and Blaise standing behind them. "Hey!" Draco smiled brightly. Hermione and Ron walked back and was equally surprised to see them, hoping they're not there to confront them or something. "What are you doing here?" Draco asked, but quickly noticed the muggle cigarette in between her fingers.
"Of course," He said before walking out.
They watched as she took another and another before she realized they were still standing there. "I guess I owe you guys something in return" She sighed and turned to her house-elf, "Give me the tickets for tonight"
Harry nodded, pointing at Pansy. "That, I know"
"I insist," Hagrid said with a smile. Draco shook his head, "N–No, we're—"
Harry blushed, pressing his body closer to Draco. "Ooohhh!" Everyone turned to Voldemort. "Plot Twist!" He said from the audience. Both laughed. Harry shook his head
stopped, only letting the broom carry them
"I'm just gonna pretend you didn't say that"
Pansy and Blaise ran down to Draco and quickly helped him up. He glanced back at Harry. But this time, it's more of a thankful proud smile. Everybody was too busy to notice it. Harry chuckled lightly to himself and smiled subtly before letting Pansy and Blaise help Draco back on the boat, having the relief to know he's fine.
by the way, this shit is also available in Wattpad.
"Wait a damn minute. Are you Harry Potter?" A friend of Minda exclaimed when he noticed the scar on his head. They all stopped. "Oh god"
Malfoy looked around before back to his daddy. "Have you heard?" Draco whispered. Harry nodded, knowing exactly what he's talking about. "Yes. Yes, I've heard. I thought you told them"
Draco holds Harry's hand.
There are no math teachers in Hogwarts, but if there were, he'd already be tackled to the ground.
"Say that one more time and I'm gonna push you off your broom" Draco replied. Harry laughed and flew to the other side of Draco's broom. "So, are you nervous about tomorrow?" He asked.
. It felt like it. He was fucking gorgeous. Unbelievable. Harry's
. Speaking of seeing, he can't see shit. He cleaned his glasses with the shirt under his robe and put it back on. It wouldn't be a problem if everyone wasn't in different coloured outfits. "Harry"
"Please, Draco." Pansy finally said. Draco sighed and turned around. "Fine. But I haven't got all day" He said while leaning against the dungeon walls, hands tucked inside his pockets.
"So. How are you?" Lucius began, both still walking in the same slow pace. The corridors weren't filled with students, since most of them are probably somewhere in their house or out there exploring the grounds like Dora the Explorer. Which is a good thing, I suppose.
Draco nodded. "I'm okay. Thank you" he whispered. He wanted to badly kiss him right now and congratulate him for making him so proud, but then he looked up and wasn't surprised to see people looking at them—all looking either surprised, confused, or gay.
"That's true" Draco mumbled. Everyone turned to him. "What?"
"I will kill you, Draco, if this plan of yours fails" Hermione grunted, following Draco and the others as they snuck their way behind the pub. It was the most disgusting smell ever. It was like an old-beer-like smell, but worse because of the big opened trash bin some idiot just shoves against the wall, letting the melted snow flood the inside of the bin.
Plus the countless irrelevant 1v1 in the most random places that left people watching confused and horny at the same time. This is fucked up, innit?
Draco sighed as he started, "So? How did your friends react to it? To us." He had his hands in the pocket of his black over-priced trousers, not exactly knowing what to do with them. "Kinda like what I expected? I mean," Harry shrugged, "I expected to be more of a dramatic reaction,"
"Of course, I bet you're great at that" Harry snickered.
There are just so many plot holes to their weird rival story. People are conspiring like Tumblr drarries on a Tuesday and it's hurting his head.
"Hypocrite much?"
"The next day, I think he felt awful or as confused as I am and he didn't say a word. He didn't tease anyone. He didn't make fun of me every damn time like he always did. He was just, awfully very quiet. That wasn't until we ran into each other in the hall. He was first to call me and asked if we could talk. We did talk that night, he apologized and shit like that but we didn't talk again after that. He was less rude, but he's still poking around like his usual self. Which I actually felt weird about it"
They both pulled away from the kiss and smiled
B: "It's weird that they are actually friends. Heck, dating each other"
"Yeah, it's not." She agreed, "It's not our problem who you want to take to the dance. If it's a girl or a boy..."
That nameless bitch couldn't care less if the powerful wizard kid is standing right beside him, hence he moved closer. You better not kiss him, you son of a bitch. "I always knew you were gay for this lunatic." He scowled, turning to Harry as he speaks. "Fooking fag—!"
"And all that shit talk you and Potter did lately," Blaise added, "Yeah. That
, catching on to him.
"Weren't you like pining her all summer?" Hermione said, not bothering to ask Ron to stop eating. Since she did that several times and it did nothing, so why bother trying.
The girl deadpanned. "Really? That's your blackmail technique?"
Even if none of them bought it, they decided to shrug it off like they always do. Hermione was the first one to get up, "Well, I need to get going now. I need to prepare for first period"
Harry nodded at the question. "How—?" Neville asked before being cut off by Ginny's little victory squeal, "I knew it!"
"It's Bellatrix, dear," Narcissa told her husband, "Every solution to a problem is killing them" They all nodded and laughed. Until Harry realized she was being literal.
Harry looked back at him, "They will. I did."
The father shrugged, "What?"
"Well don't just stand there, McGonagall. Do something!" Dumbledore stated, which made Snape cackle and McGonagall smacking him harder in the arm. She eventually got out of hiding and walked up to them, waving her hands frantically, trying to disperse the crowd. "Okay, that's enough weird tension for today. Go! Shoo!"
even more. He's kind of used to people talking and whispering behind his back, but this somehow feels different. He keeps acting like this badass bitch who gives zero fucks but honestly that's bullshit. If you ask Harry, he'll say that's false because Draco gives the best fucks.
"Are you two playing wizard's chess without me?" The long-haired professor quickly commented when he saw the wizards chess on Dumbledore's table. His face looked like he just got cheated by Lily with a hot, tall, messy, dense Gryffindor boy.
"The book was incredible!" He smiled, handing over his book. He turned and realized Harry and Draco were sitting behind him. "Would you look at that? My soulmate and godson"
"Unlike you, I told them not to come"
Draco smirked and belted loudly, "Always has!" Looking at Harry while he's at it. The latter rolled his eyes, "Shut it, Malfoy"
Ron and Hermione walked up to him. The three standing as he watched the group walked out of the hall, swaying their butts with grace. "Look at him." Ron said, "He's literally the replica of Voldemort."
"No—" The three bimbos all said collectively, again.
"And what if he has?" Harry said with a fucking hot smirk. The group looked at each other and gasped quietly. Ron Weasley is really enjoying his popcorn. Pansy and a few others cursed when Draco came back with an oblivious remark. "What? Too scared to come out? Tell him, I'm one but not a homophobic lad"
. They turned to see McGonagall walking towards them. "Off you go, Harry." Hermione's voice turned softer before she tears her eyes away and glares back at his boyfriend.
Harry got down from the table and straightened his messed up shirt Draco has been tugging the whole time—Draco doing the same with his and his hair. Harry shot them a smile when he saw Ron and Hermione walking in, both just in their white uniforms as well. "Uh, hey. What are you guys doing here?"
Narcissa then moved on to talk about their family and pretty embarrassing stories of Draco pre-Hogwarts—which Harry clearly enjoys listening. Teasing Draco once in awhile. "Draco actually talks a lot about you," Lucius finally added. Draco turned to him, "Father!"
Hermione turned around, "Shut up, Harry! This isn't about you"
"Where's your date? Who is your date?" Pansy asked again, sipping into her glass of orange wizard punch. I'm
"What are you talking about?" Harry questioned his sudden change of topic.
"He's actually a good man if you get to know him." Voldemort said, "He's funny, he's kind, he an easy-going man, he's stylish," He chuckled, which Harry couldn't react to that yet. "But out of all of that. I have to admit, there's one thing he's still trying to perfect. And that's being a good father"
Hermione nudged his arm, forcing him to stop mid-sentence. "Right. We're sorry. We shouldn't have assumed." She said softly.
making Harry shiver into his touch.
"Which is very understandable." Blaise nodded. "We're sorry for putting that thought in you and lashing out on you like that"
"Just to remind everybody again, he is our teacher," Ron said before earning chuckles from his friends. Draco sighed and took off his coat, levitating it with a spell and letting it drape over the railings of the porch. He turned to Pansy who just shrugged and started climbing the two-story building.
Harry smiled softly and understanding, "I understand. Not that I understand fully, since my parents are well, dead," Draco chuckled. "But yeah, I get it." He smiled before pulling him into a chaste kiss, one filled with hope that maybe one day this could happen outside their little rendezvouses. They let go after a minute, resting their foreheads on each other as Malfoy whispered with a smile. "Dick"
"Judgemental," Pansy tried to finish his sentence. Draco nodded, "Yeah, exactly!" He leaned back. "But come to think of it, I should've just told you guys sooner"
Draco nodded slowly. "So I guess we're even then?" He pursed his lips. Harry shrugged, "Yeah." he paused, "But I don't want this to go on,"
The Slytherin hummed. "Coming from a Gryffindor. That must mean something"
He rolled his eyes, but even with that, he can't hide the blush on his cheeks. Harry planted another longing kiss as if he hasn't done it in the past hour or so. "Draco..."
The excitement Draco has while talking about Harry warms Narcissa's heart. Like every good mother, they always want the best for their children.
A: "That's one toxic relationship. I bet all they do is make fun of each other"
Voldemort, who has been watching their conversation, decided to jump in. "You two aren't supposed to be here. Ms. Gracely. Mr. Weasley"
The six listened to the agonising rage of a voice, possibly coming from downstairs. The man by the closet doors mumbled to himself, being heard clearly by the group inside the closet. "Dear Salazar," He shouted back, "Coming mother!"
Draco looked back at the redhead sitting on the wall. "Huh! Would you look at that? I think you got yourself a new boyfriend" His comment made his friends laugh, bringing other people's attention to them again.
. Then he talks again —
"That's exactly the answer I was looking for" She smiled as she walked ahead of them. "Come on, Ron. I know exactly where to go"
Both turned and watched Ron walk up the stairs to his room. "Are you jealous, Ronald Weasley?" Hermione teased from her seat with a smile.
"Okay, okay. I get it." Draco said, "I'm sorry. I
if you can't tell, i am a procrastinator
"You two have been fighting again, haven't you?" Ron speculated, arms in both of his pockets. Harry rubbed his neck, "Maybe?"
"I wouldn't buy it" Harry chuckled. Draco laughed lightly, "I was panicking, alright?" Harry just laughed, letting Draco rest his head on his shoulder as they stared at the fire and letting time guide their conversation.
Just a theory, Harry. Maybe if you stop procrastinating, maybe you'll actually find a solution to your deadly quandary. Just saying.
Also, there's one time Harry finally broke up with this Ravenclaw girl from Ginny and Luna's year. He was hurt and angry and was this close to hurting someone real bad. Anger has been something Harry has continuously tried to dealt with after the war and it seemed to not tune down any less, even after the muggle therapy Hermione suggested.
"I'm not even allowed there!" Harry quickly denied. Hm, yes. But you went there anyway, you Draco simp. Dean nodded and swallowed his food, "Then last week. You saved Malfoy out of the lake. People came out with their loved ones and you came out with Malfoy!"
"I'm literally shaking for you, Harry." She said genuinely. Ron joined Harry and looked up. "It's Thursday and you have nobody to take." Harry and Ron stayed quiet. "You're gonna embarrass yourself in front of millions of people. I mean, I get it if you don't want to take me. But take Ron instead,"
Draco knew about this and crossed his fingers hoping that his gay best friend would somewhat take control of her actions. Especially when Lavender came whispering to them how her cousin has been fancying Draco, like a lot. "That blond guy over there looks smashing hot, don't you think?"
"Look at you two coming out of the closet again" Pansy cackled at the pair. The group walked down quietly to attract no attention. Seeing the bar being packed with wizards, even in broad daylight, they quickly hid inside a storage room, way bigger than the closet. "Oh! I know that guy!" Draco pointed at the bartender behind the bar, serving a man a shot of some type of magic wizard shit. Firewhiskey? Maybe. I don't know. "What now?" Harry asked, peeking behind the wooden door and into the bar area.
The pure-blood chuckled, "Fuck off"
"Were you blackmailed?"
"Harry Potter is with Draco Malfoy?!" Some random kid I don't know the name of said. Everyone in the room turned to him, so did Draco and Harry. Draco smirked and with all the ounce of confidence in him, he pulled Harry by his waist. "I know. Hot, innit?"
Snape nodded and smiled softly. "Yes." He handed him the vial. "But don't worry, we made it extra sweet, just the way you requested it" He ended the sentence with a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
He can do this. This shouldn't be a problem.
"Good" She smiled before hugging him again. "Try not to die again, okay?"
"Now we have two Hermiones!" Ron noticing the weird reality glitch.
"Why didn't you think of it before?" Hermione said, putting back her wand. Pansy chuckled and pointed, "I like her"
spilt inside the punch, Draco's tight and beautiful suit, and Harry's weird dream he had the night before.
"What?!"
"We?! All of you did this?!" Hermione glared at them. A couple of Gryffindors walked up to them, trying to back up Hermione, seeing that it's one against many.
The guy he has been thinking of naming his kid after. lmao. dumb bitch.
Hermione glared, "Shut up, Harry"
The pair sat on a ruined wall outside of the castle and chose to stay there for a little while—or forever, possibly. Harry brought them to a lighter conversation which made Draco almost completely forget about the hell they decide to call "school".
Harry shook his head and chuckled. It's Ron's turn now. "How about a Weasley?" He suggested.
"You're right" Dumbledore stood up, "My apologies. Harry. Draco. We promise to be more... professional when it comes to confronting student drama"
Draco couldn't help but snicker at the professor. Who would've thought he'd be this soft and nice. Something Harry actually thought about him—something he wouldn't want to admit. Harry was making himself comfortable by tucking his bag by his side when he heard a loud sound getting closer to him. He turned around and saw Draco dragging his chair like dragging Harry in the Great Hall earlier that day.
Leaving his two superior friends looking back at each other with a mirrored expression. Ron turned to Hermione once Harry was out of his sight, face still confused. "And you just believe him? As simple as that?"
Draco smiled
"I have no idea"
Which was true by the way. They ended the night with a kiss as the sun
Everywhere he'd go, people would ask to take a picture or ask for an autograph from the golden boy. Except for when he's at school. Everyone knows him, but not everyone is as big of a fan compared to the people outside the walls of Hogwarts. In their eyes, he's still one of them. He's pretty much a loser. Especially to the eyes of a particular young wizard, Draco Malfoy.
Hermione furrowed, "More clearer?!" Disappointed, but not surprised is Hermione's one true life motto.
Harry walked out. Not bothered by the sound of his rather empty stomach as he tried to walk past the stares and whispers from the irrelevant characters. He turned to walk to his dorm when he felt a rather strong thug, pulling him into a dark corner. The dark gay corner.
"Oh, so would you, darling. I'm pretty sure no woman — or man — would ever want to spend a night with someone like you" Draco tucked back his smirk before walking towards the nameless bitch. "Listen here, you piece of shit. Your words mean nothing to me!" He spat, taking his time at every. goddamn. word. "Fucking git"
