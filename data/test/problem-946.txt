“I don’t get to have nice things.”
Draco closes up for the day without a glimpse of the Chosen One and hopes that he hasn’t forgotten to lock something important. He’s never lingered in a glimpse so long before, and for just a moment, the words of the Curse flit across his mind’s eye. “
Big brown eyes drift open and look up. There’s no recognition behind them, no hero worship or familiarity. It’s why Harry’d wanted to intern here. No one went to pieces or asked for autographs or went to the Prophet if the Chosen One was their healer. “Hey Viola,” Harry whispers, because there’s not time for many more words. “I’m Harry.”
“No,” he gasps. “I’m fine—I—I just—Draco, you’re vicious. You—scared that woman. You should’ve seen her face—” Harry knows he’s being ridiculous. Draco’s face tells him exactly how unimpressive he’s being. But it’s as if a damn has burst and five years’ worth of laughter is rushing out. “You terrified—she was running—actually running—”
He’d told Hermione. It was a secret that was elusive when it came to articulation—he just didn’t know how to say out loud the thing that he was so sure was true.
He’d been so lost in the sting streaking through his toes, that Harry’d almost missed the gate swinging gently open.
“That’s disgusting, is what that is.” Ron said, shaking his head. “I honestly don’t know why you’re bothering at that place. Doctors are just men with knives and apparently fridges full of blood.” Harry had bit his tongue and wrestled  the hot rage back into his chest. Wizards, even good ones like Ron, we so removed from Muggle culture. Too removed to understand or to care about the magnificence of modern medicine and too arrogant to appreciate how the nurses washed the dead. Handled with care, even on their way out of this world.
“I think?” Harry says. “Dunno. I just…”
Bella is curled up in his lap, snuggled into a mangey throw blanket, still strangely affectionate. “Did you hear that?” he asks her, and she opens one massive eyeball lazily. The pounding sounds again, much louder, as if the meaty part of a fist is bashing against his front door, but that’s not possible, because he isn’t expecting anyone—
Harry stumbles out of Trauma Bay 4, jotting notes and admission orders onto Viola’s chart. The Emergency room is still squirming and alive, crisis after crisis unfolding in the partitioned rooms. Catastrophe in miniature. Contained and sterile and tragic.
And a stalker was made.
A heavy door slammed and the sound bounced off the snowdrifts. “Draco?”
“Oh, come on. I know you’re secretly dying to hear those Spicey Girls again. I know how you look up to the Posh one.”
Harry fusses with the interface of the mobile, trying to update the contact information.
“Have you not been paying attention?”
“I liked that one a lot, actually,” Harry says, looking down at Draco’s lips. “Cause you were actually in my dreams. Every universe that Pansy gave me felt so familiar, I’m sure I dreamed all of them.”
The mystery is peeling away and Harry says the thing he always says when the world feels out of order. “I need to tell Hermione.”
“You’re supposed to hate me,” Draco said, more to himself, as he walked around the truck, hopped up onto the seat, and slammed the door.
Mike’s got a grin that feels earnest in that I’d-take-you-home-and-feed-you-supper kind of way and for a moment, the person and the patient starts to blur. Harry shakes his head, flips through the chart. Bloodwork, Oxygen levels, and heartrate monitors and still, no one can figure out what’s wrong.
“It’s not—It’s not just that. It’s also—” Draco pauses. “I need you to promise not to laugh.”
For now, though, Harry’s content to rub Draco’s shampoo into his hair and drown in the smell of citrus and spice. To rinse the evidence of a thousand emergencies down the drain and to cover himself up in Draco’s towels and then his clothes and to hold on to this moment where it’s alright.
Typing…
“I don’t care about the mark.”
“Oh,” Pansy says, abandoning her groceries and hurrying to his side. “Oh, you’ve gone and caught feelings, haven’t you?” She pulls Draco’s head into her lap and begins stroking his hair. The feel of Pansy’s hands is a secret comfort that he guards jealously.
, he thinks.
Hermione’s campaign to Get Harry Out of the House had been in full swing. She and Ron were somewhere in the mess of bodies. They’d abandoned him and were probably in a corner somewhere, making out, but not before Ron had clapped him on the back and shouted, “Go find a nice looking witch!”
“In one universe,” Draco says, “I fall to my death.” There’s no answer. Just the sounds of a city at night.
“Wouldn’t have pictured you as the straight from the bottle type,” Harry says.
A part of Draco had given into the fantasy that Potter had wanted him, had chased that attention to a hot release in a tight fist. In person, though, Draco’d had no delusions when he stared back into those green eyes. It had been loathing, suspicion, hatred. It had never been lust or anything softer. Nothing like love.
* * *
“If you say so,” Hermione said, and shared a private smile with her muffin.
“I just wanted to give it back—” Potter starts to say, but is cut off. It’s a noise that stops Draco’s heart. Like the last of the water sucked down the drain, of a lung collapsing or a heel crushing a windpipe. Potter drops his face into his hands and starts to shake.
, he thought, weakly.
she says, stepping towards him on the platform. Her hair was blonde-white, or was it red? Every angle cast a different face, and Harry couldn’t pin her down.
The air is sticky and wet on his skin and Draco leans into it, accepts the dusting of moisture on his nose and his cheeks in the same way he accepts the pull of his wand as it takes him to Harry.
Harry should be responding. He should be producing words. But he’s still not quite accepted that, after years of searching, Malfoy has just dropped into his lap.
The candles have burned low by the time he’s done.
“Cop also said you fell, but onto the sidewalk and not into the street a hundred feet below. And that you cracked your head on the way down.”
“Different universe, different rules,” Draco says.
“Wine,” Draco says, making his way to the kitchen. Tonight requires his most bowl-sized wine glass.
“You slept together?”
But a part of Harry knows that anything so direct would be a gunshot in a field of birds. They’re still dancing, Harry knows. And it’s better than fighting.
“It would all stop. All of it. I’d stop failing. Stop letting them all down.”
<3 I think it might add to the experience, but that's just me.
“Have you only just realized you’ve committed to a length-yet-to-be-determined road trip with a Death Eater?” Draco tries for humour, but it falls flat.
“I—” Draco says, and Harry’s entire world is cropped down to a single moment. This moment. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“You’re really not gonna believe this,” and Harry tells her. About that first day in A&E and about the way Draco moved, in and out of a crisis as if he was built for it.
At first, he was sure he would wait until morning. Enough havoc had been wrought and Harry was dead on his feet. The box, though, seemed to call to him. The mystery of the vials inside whispered his name, and Harry knew that he wouldn’t wait. That he had to know.
It is. Of course it is.
But then Draco is panicking and the truck is stopping, Draco is fleeing and Harry following him outside.
“Okay.” John rubs his hands through his thick brown hair in a way that reminds Draco of Potter.
On the cool tile, with the memories of Draco Malfoy whispering into his ear—
Long legs. Sharp angles.
“I’m not a stranger!” Potter shouted, and it was all very loud inside the bench of the front seat.
“Fucking Malfoy,” Harry growls, and pads towards the bathroom to shower off the mess he’s left in his pants.
A gash of white-blonde hair.
* * *
A part of him tries to acknowledge that the…date…hadn’t been
“She can help,” Harry says. The details of how Hermione figures things out have always felt vague, a secret plucked out of a book somewhere at the last possible moment, but he knows she’ll come through in the same way that he knows the sun will rise tomorrow. “We have to get him back.”
“You,” Harry says, lip quirking in the way that Draco loves to bite. “
Harry rummages around in his scrubs for something to write with.
“You noticed?” Draco says.
he remembers thinking.
“Don’t worry,” Ron says, throwing him a knowing look Harry’s missed so much it’s ike a physical ache in his chest. “She’ll wanna be here for this.”
“—it doesn’t—”
“I—” Harry starts, but then it hits him. Blue lips, blonde hair. The sound of the dead breathing the same air. “Oh god.”
Harry thinks. “And Draco gets sucked into these universes?”
“Not yet—” he starts to shout, but the nurse on triage is suddenly plopped in front of him.
“Maybe. But not anymore.” The weight of one childhood grudge seems to crumble.
“I’m not worried about that,” Robertson says, giving Harry a look that’s half intrigue, half recognition, although Harry’s sure he’s never met him. “I can find titles to appease any customer. But first, I would like to know what’s got your face looking like an overripe turnip.”
Harry could see him swallow as the stranger started to kiss him there, could see his Adam’s apple bob under a pair of lips.
Pansy’s grin is wicked. “True,” she says, “but I don’t actually care about your choice of venue.” She tucks a strand of orange-kissed hair behind one ear. “If we’re not celebrating your brush with an extended stay in Azkaban, why are we here?”
There are two conversations Harry wants to have; he chooses the safer of the two.
Draco takes a deep breath, swallows. “Another universe. I was pulled into….another universe.”
Something is off.
“It’s not that it’s
“You were in every universe,” Pansy says.
For a split second, Pansy’s face twists in agony. Pain on his behalf. But she has always known what he needs, and he’s never needed her pity.
“Yes.” Draco tried very hard not to appear afraid.
“And you haven’t said a word about it.”
Everything about Malfoy is so tangled, Harry can’t figure out where he stands. Malfoy was a bully and a coward, and then he was a victim and that would have been confusing enough, but now Draco was grown up and working with Muggles and so fucking fit Harry thinks he might die.
“Not safe?” Draco says, picturing his flat and all of the throw blankets he planned to wrap himself in once he stumbled through the front door.
“You don’t?”
“You want to give me free labour?” Robertson had said, white hair crackling with the humidity. The man cast an imposing figure. He was tall and broad as a battle axe, but with the mania of those professor types who are always on the brink of the next discovery that will change the world.
The moon bulges above them and Harry looks up. There’s comfort in the lidless dilation and he’s calm as Hermione’s spell swells in his chest.
“I want you,” Harry says, his whole world at a boiling point. “All of you.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, breathing slowly through his teeth.
“Stupid chickens,” someone else says, and Harry hurries away.
“I’m not disturbed!”
“Because…” Honesty was a knot; Harry had the end and he’d pulled. “Because I’ve done things. Horrible things. And I don’t get to just move on. The villains don’t get a happily ever after.”
Arrow after arrow crashes into Draco’s back, but he doesn’t look up. Looking at it will only make it worse. Of course Potter is here. Was there anyone Draco had hurt more than Harry Potter? It made sense that he would want to see their old rivalry finally set to rest.
Most of the people have stopped shuffling, most bodies have found their seats, when a gavel snaps the room to attention.
“I found myself very low one night,” Draco says, so soft that Harry is shifting closer to him, breaching the middle cushion.  “And I made some rather…erratic choices.”
“So, you’ll dream of him and that will establish a link. We’re hoping it’s strong enough that we can perform this variation of a summoning charm.” Hermione is holding a heavy purple book, gold letters peeling on the spine.
that it makes Harry want to hold, to force him to stay. But the room is empty.
“NO!”
Harry hears Ron tell him. The laughter boils in his chest, bubbling over and he can’t help himself. Harry barely recognizes the sound, it’s been so long.
“Don’t call him that!” Ron had said, leaping to his defence.
“I was wrong. I didn’t believe you. I’m—” For a moment, Harry chokes on it.
And then he turns around.
“Harry Potter!” Harry roars, wishing just this once that the power of his name would make everything work out. “I’m a resident. I work with Draco.”
Harry follows the ink with his tongue. A stem, petals, delicate leaves. “Flowers,” he whispers.
“Did you smear blood on my balcony?” Draco drawls as he surveys his surroundings. “That’s practically medieval. Pansy, how did you let this happen?”
Pansy elbows him in the ribs. “Would you fuck off with the wallowing for two seconds? I think you just put them under your tongue, but I’ll text Angelica to confirm. She’s quite shady. Perhaps we should set her up with sketchy Greg. She’ll definitely know what to do.”
“I should’ve known,” Draco whispers. The fury is violent, Harry’s ears are ringing with it. He’s not supposed to hear this, Harry knows, but he does. Draco mutters under his breath and Harry hears him say, “You’ll never love me in this universe.”
“Wha—” The words feel blocky and Harry struggles to process.
“Hello!” Harry shouted, knowing it was stupid and that this was why he would make a terrible Auror. The need to know pounded in his ears. “Is anyone still here?”
“I would remind you that you are a dirty liar, Pansy Parkinson, and that Jesus would not approve of this harassment.”
Also, this chapter's a meaty one! Strap in, friends <3
“Idiots,” Pansy mutters just as Hermione says, “Blind, aren’t they?”
“Naw,” Harry answers, but picks up the Yeats and starts to page through it.
Draco hates how calm the words are, when he feels hot all over. Potter, in his stupid shaggy jeans and a shirt that hangs like a tent flap. And he’s just staring at Draco without any of the fire that used to be there.
“It’s—” The Auror tightens his jaw, the first hint that there might be feeling beneath the stern visage. “I didn’t expect to be the one to tell you—this was just one of the Malfoy properties that we were dispatched to. You weren’t here and so I—”
Harry thinks,
It’s fortunate, then, that closed doors can’t keep out ghostly intruders. Harry passes through the heavy wood without a second thought and finds Draco, splayed open on the floor.
“We can’t dance
There are (at least) two nods to absolutely breathtaking fics in this chapter.
“I believe that,” John says. “Cops can be a bit shit when it comes to mental health.”
“Draco!” Robertson returns from the backrooms in a burst of energy, still cradling his cabbage with tender loving care. “Are you fraternizing with the customers?”
“What! No! I—”
Finally,
Narcissa stops, bracketed by smooth lawns on either side of her slim shoulders. “Draco,” she says, and her voice wobbles. “We’re …we’re going to be…”
. Pansy had come with him to the Muggle shop, had said she felt like a Mr. Bond from the film they’d watched a few weeks ago when they’d purchased the camera. “For surveillance,” Pansy had whispered, looking scandalized. It had all felt exciting at first.
“What!”
“But—” Harry remembers the last time he saw Draco, remembers the blood and the white-blonde hair and the words, aimed to hurt, to harm, to bleed. “I fucked up. So badly. I’m so—”
“He sang this,” Pansy insists, panting and flushed, as she collapses back into her chair next to them. “When he was pining after you!”
“Your scrubs.” Draco reaches out and touches his sleeve.
“That’s really not the solution I was hoping for—”
universe?” She does not look impressed.
“Oh my god! Those gamers really mean business.”
Harry has a moment of genuine self-hatred. He’s angry at the wet mess in his boxers. Furious at how he’s half hard just remembering it. Livid that it’s been five years and he still dreams about Draco bloody Malfoy.
Draco’s rage is a rash, and the only way to scratch is to scream and scream, but he can’t because there are a thousand eyes on him and he’s supposed to be deferent. Licking the boots of the fucking Hero, come to save the day. Again.
(See the end of the chapter for

This is the moment Draco looks forward to, the one that is both a gift and a curse. Because Draco knows Harry’s face, has come to know it intimately. He has run his fingers over those cheekbones and has kissed those bright eyes closed. Draco
“Yes, you do,” Harry’s closer.
he thinks, to assume that Draco was going to stick to his side all night. Malfoy isn’t his babysitter. It was fine, really. He can leave whenever he wants.
“And you listened?”
Emma’s sweet features were all scowl and Harry scuttled away before she could say anything else. Away from everything that was blond and distracting and who fucked him in his dreams at least twice a month.
“Fuck, Draco, fuck.”
“Nope. You don’t get to come into my house and judge me,” Harry says, leaning against the wall in the entranceway. “Say whatever you came to say, Malfoy, and leave. You’re good at that.”
“Oh?” Robertson eyes him suspiciously. “Well, I’m the proprietor of this establishment, so I’m sure you’d be receptive to my suggestions?”
“It’s just a collection of potentially observable universes that represent every possible future in every possible world. It’s nothing, really.”
The shock rushes through Mike’s body, and his eyes fly open. “Sweet merciful Jesus!” he yelps, and a few laughs stutter out. Tears are streaming down Frieda’s face as she smiles at her husband. “I felt that go through me. Down to my toes, I felt it!”
“Let me,” Granger says, and before Draco can do anything, there’s magic washing all over him. It’s pathetic, but Draco sighs into the spells.
“I will ruin you next time, weasel,” Draco had promised, wine glass sloshing as Ron snorted violent good humour. “I was going easy on you. For Potter’s sake, obviously. How callous would it be to trounce his best mate so thoroughly? No. I’ll get you next time,” Draco had promised, two spots of red glowing on his cheeks.
“A bit?”
“Is it?” Draco’s voice is a shrill.
transformed the old Black home into a museum
John leans back in his plastic hospital chair and cracks his neck. “Not exactly shy, are you?”
“It was nothing.”
Draco pushes his hair off his forehead and Harry wants to press him thumb over the worry lines. “If they’re going to invade our personal lives, they should at least strive for originality. Confunded? What a bore.”
“Thank Merlin,” Potter says. There’s a touch of mania in his voice and it’s so stark a difference from the relaxed posture and easy silences of this world that it startles Draco.
“Draco!” Harry shouts, because the quiet feels like an ending. “Draco, I’m sorry.”
“—and then I went and fucked it worse?” Harry takes another long swallow of his rum drink, because this barely counts as cocoa anymore.
“You should be ashamed of yourselves,” Hermione Granger says from somewhere above him.
Pansy snorts. “You’ve been cagey as a Hufflepuff with a hidden agenda since we walked in. You,” Pansy says, poking him in the chest, “have a secret. So spill.”
When Draco had arrived at the restaurant, the idiot had looked up at him with interest. With something heated and filled with potential and Draco had thought, this might not have been a bad idea after all.
Behind them, the party hums, something gentle and acoustic. “So, you’re—”
“You’re so dramatic.”
into the tile.
The whole dream disaster had started around the day of Malfoy’s trial. Harry’d half-suspected Malfoy cast a spell on him, but there’d not been time and there were far too many witnesses. Someone would’ve seen.
Harry jumps.
“You can fucking take him. I don’t need another rich kid to babysit.”
“There’s a mental health patient waiting for assessment,” she (Megan?) (all of the nurses here seem to be named Megan) says, and Harry tries to nod, but someone
“You just can’t help it can you?” Draco says, and the words are sharpened, aimed to hurt. “You have to save everyone. You can’t just leave well enough alone.”
“He came back from the dead! A perfect person who was noble and good in the face of impossible odds. He sacrificed himself for the whole world—”
The smell of a million printed letters floats with the dust motes, light filtering through the thick scent of a story. If the display looked cramped and haphazard, the interior is disorder magnified by a factor of ten.
The night ends with Pansy on top of the table, beer bottle doubling as a microphone. Her feet are spread in what Harry privately thinks is an excellent duelling stance, the muscles in her throat flexing as she tries to match Celine’s superior French vocal range. “ALL BY MYSELF!” The table shakes under her furious attempt at the high note.
, Harry thinks as scrawls his mobile number onto a post it that’s crumpled from several weeks spent in a pocket.
They were terrifying, the two of them.
Draco clawed at his wits, willing them to come back to him. “Because it’s your name?”
“I have no idea how to answer that.”
The wind rolls across the canola. For a moment, Draco contemplates wading out into the yellow sea and drowning in the blooms.
His mind goes to jelly.
“How am I going to do that?” Harry yelled and his words were threaded with a secret terror. The strobe lights looked a lot like curses and they were making him dizzy.
hair. You know, most people think that
“Look, Malfoy—”
The strings of his heart are suddenly taught. “Yes,” Draco answers, because it’s true. In every universe so far, most details varied wildly—from winter wastelands to nipple pasties. One thing, though, remained steadfast. Harry Potter, not-always-the-saviour-of-the-world, the boy who lived in every timeline, was always there.
The Emergency Room is squirmy and Harry’s adrift in the trauma.
“I was busy, Ronald,” Hermione says.
It’s muscle memory, more than anything else that brings him back to Archway Bridge.
This is my first Drarry and I'm just dazzled by the folks reading so far. Thank you so very very much <3
“Are you sleeping in your bed?”
“I don’t run—”
, he thinks idly.
Amber does not sound like she knows what placate means. “Thank you for your commitment to excellence. You’re doing great work. Honestly. I’ll take think about what you’ve said.”
“Ron!” Hermione punches his shoulder and hot mint tea spills over the rim. “Is your first question really going to be about sex?”
A&E is on wheels, the kind of night where everything walking through the door is an anomaly, and the department is riding a collective caffeine fix.
“—Harry—”
Convincing Mr. Robertson, the owner of the shop, had been far less straightforward.
Whatever confession Potter was gearing up to, Draco was suddenly sure that he did not want to hear it.
“Draco?”
“—curse,” Draco mutters.
“No.” It was one word and it punctuated the moment.
“I’ll read the note, thanks!”
Malfoy raises the wine bottle in greeting, fingers still wrapped around the neck; he doesn’t let go of Harry.
Draco tries for confidence, standing straight and stern.
Harry doesn’t care. Harry slams his front door and settles into a brutal pace.
“Help me get her on a stretcher!” Harry shouts at the same time the waifish figure standing behind the seizing child lets out a single terrified scream.
Draco’s not sure how long he’s lingered here, chasing the horizon, as if the highway is the stray end of a cassette tape that needed to be rewound.
The word feels artificial.
“I said stop.”
” says Pansy, doing her best to sound dignified. “It’s just that it’s…it’s so bad.”
“Draco, I swear if you force me to listen another Space Girl song—”
They were on the wrong side of the road and Potter had an accent and it was all building to a very large panic in Draco’s chest.
success.
“And how much are you sleeping?”
he thinks, holding his mother tight.
“Ginny?” Harry shrugs. “It was fine while it lasted, I guess.”
“In what universe, Harry?” Draco asks, because he needs to hear it.
he’d thought, for the first time, but not the last.
Harry thinks, absently.
“Well, that’s ridiculously cryptic.”
“Fine! Just need to…” Draco reached for an excuse that made more sense than
* * *
“That was rude?” Harry thinks out loud, and starts to track a path across the labyrinth of Royal London Hospital.
, Harry thinks, green flames licking his skin.
“I can’t decide what’s more unlikely,” Pansy says, nose scrunched in concertation, dabbing at her baby toe. “You dancing burlesque or Potter loving you.”
“And you expect me to welcome this criminal element into my shop without knowing you personally, vetting your credentials, or surrendering to my preconceived notions of you felonious types?”
The word resists him. It’s such a strange concept.
Harry hadn’t believed him. No one would just leave the magical world behind. Especially not someone like Malfoy, who had lived his entire life steeped in pure blood traditions and the mantra of magical superiority. Harry had let him go.
“Propositioning me is quite a hopeless venture these days,” Draco goes on, undeterred. “Unless you have a secret dick somewhere—”
“Close. Harry, so close.”
she says and Harry realizes that she knows exactly where this place is and what it means.
“He asked me,” Harry says on a heavy exhale, too tired to feel stupid for missing all of the signs, “if I could see him. Always seemed surprised.”
“I’m so sorry. I’m just going to back slowly out of the shop now and never talk to you again. Which is a fucking shame, really, because I’ve been working myself up to come in here for weeks to talk to you and now I’ve gone and fucked it.” The strange man turns to leave.
“It’s in poor taste to insult your host, Weasel,” Pansy says, and proceeds to flay Ron with her sharp tongue. Harry briefly wonders if she’d learned from Draco or if he’d learned from her.
Robertson harumphs in his direction. “It’s less about fondness and more about the world’s slow descent into lazy diction. In my day, a suitor would have come prepared, armed with the words of his better—poets and philosophers. He would have spread his dreams beneath your feet. He would have romanced you in several different languages.”
The draft nips at his bare chest, and Harry almost crawls back into bed because Draco won’t be long and he could just wait for him to return. But the need to hold, to be held, drags him up and out of the bed, through every room in the flat.
This chapter is a shameless nod to one of the best fics I've ever read.
“Nothing,” Harry lies, stomping to the stove and ladling Hermione a massive bowl of soup. Harry likes soup. It warms you on the inside. It was the first thing he’d done after he woke up and his brain still itched.
Harry turns over, hand searching for contact, but there’s nothing.
“What on earth has you in such a tizzy?” she says, brushing soot from her shoulders and dumping her ostentatiously large bag on his countertop. Bella sluices out from beneath a piece of furniture—Harry has no idea where she hides, but suspects that it’s some kind of high powered cat-lair, where she plots how to best make him miserable—and hops into Hermione’s lap.
This universe has left them both scarred, Harry realizes as he follows the memory up the stairs. Draco’s body is twisted with the white brands of dangerous days—a raised ugly thing above his heart, nicks all over Draco’s hands and two angry looking tears across each of his shoulders. This older version of himself is no better, mangled by what his healer training tells him are dark curses designed to wound with permanency.
“I know that Justin Timberlake is outrageously handsome, but this is a step too far.”
He’d tried to take his time. With shaking fingers, Harry had opened the box and laid every vial on his bed. There were sixty-one, and each had a date scrawled onto a paper label.
“No use pretending this is anything else.” John has smile lines—wrinkles around the edges of his eyes. “I’m not really that kind of counsellor. There’s too much bullshit in the world already.”
The night ends six hours later with a body, naked and cold on a stretcher. One of the nurses is washing him, handling his limbs gently as they move cloth over skin. “I’m lifting up your arm now, Michael. Not to worry.” Not everyone talks to the bodies as they’re cleaning them, getting them ready for transport to the morgue. It’s a kindness, to wash the bodies.
Harry smiles, and it’s a gentle thing. There’s comfort in knowing that no matter where he goes, the world will be in motion.
, Harry thinks,
A waifish woman stumbles into the hallway, her sharp bob streaked with premature grey. “Congratulations on an—an excellent performance review, Draco,” she says, a bit uneven on her feet.
Draco wondered.
“You disappeared.”
For nearly five minutes, Harry hunts for his pants in the dark. It would be undignified to wander around Draco’s flat in the nude. Harry’s sure of it.
“You have to breathe in,” Draco whispers. Harry’s lips part, and he feels the ghost of Malfoy’s mouth, and he breathes.
Harry’s not sure if she walks or glides—does ancient magic have ten toes?—or if the platform just rearranges it’s atoms to accommodate her, but he blinks and she’s in front of him. The touch, when it’s on him again, is soft.
Draco snaps his chin up and faces her. “If I go to Azkaban?” His words are still shrill, but the edges are sharp. Like glass in a shattered window. “If all of the wizarding world takes one look at me and what I’ve done and realizes that I
“You’re depressed, Harry,” Hermione had said, pushing a mound of takeaway containers onto the floor and settling next to him.
“My wand,” Draco says. The world where he’d yearned for this moment when Potter would finally return it to him feels like a carbon copy of the horror he’s living now.
Confused clicks into comprehension and Harry says, “Draco.” Places his hands on Draco’s shoulders and turns him, gently. “I want them to.”
Draco had known from the very start how he wanted to spend his community service hours.
On instinct, he’d started to run, tucking Malfoy’s wand under one arm, and he hadn’t stopped until he was at the front entrance, panting and scrubbing melted snow from his face.
It takes three days before Harry breaks.
, Harry reminded himself.
Harry accepts the mug because there’s nothing else to do. The ceramic is warm between his hands and Harry readies himself for Pansy’s wrath.
“They’re too tight!” Harry whines as they walk up the lane.
“Put that down,” Pansy snaps, dumping her purse on the floor and standing over him, pointy elbows on hips.
“Quit deflecting!”
“Don’t leave,” Harry says. “Not again.”
The universe where Harry finds Draco is based on one of the most stunning fics in this fandom.
I've described a few universes in this chapter (which are sly references to brilliant fics you should absolutely read if you haven't already).
“I don’t want to make you feel stupid. Honestly, I don’t.”
Draco looks at John, notices something warm in his fingertips, and realizes that he can feel the curse, curling her hands between his.
“Look,” says Draco, hands tightening. “I can explain.”
Potter’s still talking. Insisting that Draco saved his life at the manor by refusing to identify him. It’s true, but Draco hasn’t told anyone that, and he wants to scream, wants to pin Potter to the ground and force him to explain how the fuck he knows. Who does he think he is, spouting opinions about Draco’s innocence and guilt?
The magic vibrates though the station and when she meets his eyes, they’re grey.
Draco can’t speak and so he cranes his neck, sipping the air and staring up at the sky.
“Fuck, he did, didn’t he?” Harry had forgotten how many ways Malfoy had hurt them. The rest of the war had diluted the harms—made them feel like teenage problems, when they’d hurt each other with an abandon that should never really’ve been allowed.
Draco eventually maneuvers Harry into a large group of people, makes sure that Harry’s inserted into conversation. It’s only once Harry settles in that Malfoy disappears.
Draco finds Harry’s eyes and stares, not casual or polite. That look is what it’s always been: it’s intense and demanding, it’s animosity and gravity, it’s an obsession that finally tipped into pleasure. Draco stares as he pulls his shirt over his head. Keeps staring as he nudges Harry’s knees apart. His hands roam across Harry’s ribs and he’s still staring.
“No.” Harry has no idea why Draco is here, but he refuses to let him further into his life. And if there are no flat surfaces, Harry won’t be tempted to push Draco against them and—
The sound that comes out of Draco then could break your heart. A keen and a sob, a sound that wants but is ashamed to want.
“We were supposed to live,” he says, closes his eyes and lifts his head to the sky. Those moments after the trial, when he’d held her and said “we’re going to live” and she’d wiped her cheeks and said that she supposed that they would. Draco feels his grief and guilt stream down his cheeks. “But that future’s gone now.”
Harry lets him.
Harry hadn’t. He hadn’t known.
Pansy had wanted a piece of him almost immediately. Had fire called and owled and—in a truly tenacious act that Draco was sure she’d seen in a Muggle Rom-Com—had shown up at the manor’s gate holding a giant handwritten sign that read ANSWER ME YOU TWAT!!! in all caps.
as well as some eccentric role-playing game called
“At least I don’t run away!” Harry roars back, because this is what they’re good at. Hurting each other.
“When the wizarding world didn’t want you—”
“Are you or are you not a wizard, who also happened to slay the dark lord?”
The night is a blood blister ready to burst. Harry feels the air pulse with the sheer anxious potential of it—the dark on the edge of rupture. His heart is in his throat.
, Draco thinks,
There must be hundreds of people crowding into the pews. Hundreds and hundreds, and more coming all the time. Draco feels them. Their hatred is thick in the air.
“You will be moving,” his mother says, not a request. “Permanently.”
“The day before his trial.”
“Obviously.”
“Erratic choices?”
“But what if I want to wallow?” says Harry, moping and pacing.
Harry apparates into Draco’s flat, prepared for the angry end of a wand or the violent end of a fist. He finds neither.
“Fuck off.”
The sigh feels like he’s spitting out his insides. “If I’m good, if I’m bad? It doesn’t matter, Pans. Nothing changes.”
“You couldn’t have fixed my hair too?” Harry says, running his hands through the forest of jet black. A navy long-sleeve clings to Harry’s biceps—everything Malfoy had put on him was a size smaller than he normally wore—and he feels a bit exposed.
“I…” Draco tries. He does. But the words don’t want to come. It’s such an enormous thing, his grief. Catastrophic in the sheer size, like he’s swallowed the entire countryside and is trying to contain it in his guts. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes. And…” Draco’s throat is closing. “And someone I loved…they got hurt. Permanently.”
, he thinks, and the fear is a cold companion.
“I don’t understand—” Harry’s seen every memory and knows, in an academic sense, that this is true but…
“You have my word.”
“You brought her back from the dead!” Draco explodes.
“No,” Harry says, and not knowing is the scariest feeling in the world. “But I’m working hard to—”
A warning for this chapter: there is some medical trauma (similar to Chapter 2), but with fairly overt descriptions of death.
“Stop laughing at me this instant,” says Draco and Harry is howling into his arms. “Harry, I swear to god, I will peel your fingernails off.”
Potter waits for the doors to close and stands.
Come find me on tumblr!
“Looks like you’re having the shittiest day if your life,” John says, treating his tears as if they’re invisible.
, Harry thinks as he watches hopefully-Megan push the medication.
and Draco must have died, infinite possibilities be dammed, because there was no world in which Harry Potter ever did
“If you’re gonna go home and try and die, I’d rather you stay here.”
Malfoy shook his head. “Need another drink.”
Potter’s face is stern in a haggard sort of way. He looks so calm, staring down a court full of the most powerful witches and wizards in Britain, but his magic betrays him. Draco wonders if anyone else can feel it, if anyone else realizes that Potter is a massive cumulous cloud rubbing static into the air.
“The one where you lament about things I can’t talk about and I apologize for being the most catastrophic kind of arsehole. And you ask me several intrusive questions that will inevitably be some variation of ‘What is Malfoy up to?’ I just…” Malfoy takes a shaky breath. “I can’t. At least, not sober.”
A gentle laugh muffled by an open mouth.
Ron snorts. “As excuses go, it’s pretty bad.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco is lost in the multiverse and Harry is going to find him—even if it costs everything he has and is and was.
“Doesn’t it? You’d have to be daft, really have to make an effort at idiocy to turn down something that improves patient care
Curses fly overhead, but all Draco can think about is skulls and snakes. Bile in his throat, he looks down at his clothes and nearly sobs in relief. His robes are forest green and his arm is clear. Unmarked.
“Harry?”
“We shagged. I asked you not to leave. You left.  Simple, even for me.”
“Right, so we’re carpooling,” Draco said, trying for small talk. Anything that would remove that horrible look from Harry’s face. “I knew that, obviously. How much longer have we got?”
“I would never!”
Draco faces his future with Harry Potter holding on to him, refusing to let go.
“Fucking mental,” Megan mutters (Harry’s sure that this one is actually named Megan). They’re all clustered around the nursing station.
They danced around each other with more grace than Harry’d managed with anyone else.
“He’s not a killer,” Potter says, and Draco is desperate for cross examination.
Harry jolts into awareness, sticky and confused and delirious with want.
It starts small. Hovering around Draco’s office. For just a couple of hours. Not long. Five days after Draco has disappeared, Harry wanders down to community health and
A spot on Harry’s countertop is suddenly very interesting.  “I can’t—” because he couldn’t. This want was too old.
“A raging, mindless, hateful mob!”
The silence hangs like someone awkward at a party.
, Draco thinks.
Black meant that she was dead.
The canola fields sway in the afternoon wind and Draco stands at the edge. Behind him, a 2002 Renault Mégane coupé is parked on the side of the road, with this universe’s Potter asleep in the passenger seat.
“You noticed me, yes?”
The moment before catastrophe is still breakable.
“What’s wrong with you?” Draco says, and his face narrows in concern. “Has someone cursed you? Is that why you’re like—”
Age is difficult to obscure in hands. They’re soft with wrinkles and wear. There’s age in his hand, hidden so well in the thundering tones and confident posture.
Two Malfoys stride up the path to the manor, backs perpendicular to fields of green. Neither has said a word since apparating from the ministry.
“—what?” Harry would be flummoxed if he weren’t so tired.
“Save it, Potter,” Pansy snaps from an armchair, her small body swaddled in an enormous jean jacket. She looks so Muggle that Harry struggles to process—she’s got pink elbow patches, for fuck’s sakes. “While you’ve been doddling, we’ve been hard at work.”
Harry had said when he’d finally held Draco in his hands.
“Oi!” Harry yelps, watching the cup shatter into a thousand tiny pieces.
Except that she hadn’t.
Harry relaxed his throat, the weight of Draco heavy on his tongue, saliva dripping from the edges of his lips, and had pushed. Draco had wanted more. Harry had given it to him.
Back when she’d called him depressed, Harry hadn’t listened, rolling away from her concern as if it was optional. Back then, he hadn’t wanted a lesson in the ways in which he was broken. In her infinite Hermione-ness—because wisdom and Hermione were synonyms—she’d changed her tactics. Diagnostic language disappeared from her vocabulary—words like depressive episodes and behavioural activation and therapy. Rather, she was bringing her friend back to life. Simple as that.
“Look, I’m not sure why I’m telling…just please don’t mention it to anyone.”
“Uh…”
One good turn, Draco thinks, certainly deserves another, and gives himself up to the universe that could have been but never was.
Draco thinks, still caught in the momentum of a universe that’s not his own.
“Recent history would disagree,” Draco replies, half-heartedly.
“Fuck you. Also, in an effort to be less evil—”
Because Harry had tried. As he sat next to the living-corpse that had once been Narcissa Malfoy, waiting for her son to arrive at St. Mungo’s, Harry had gone over what he would say. How he would apologize. And then Malfoy had shown up and they hadn’t spoken, not really. Everything had blown up in a fit of rage and a sadness so raw that the world curdled around it. They had never used their words to treat each other kindly.
and the shame of it was septic.
, and then opens his eyes.
Harry whimpers, “Yes,” and Draco chases it.
“Just need to use the facilities.”
All these years later, Harry thinks that’s what did it. His need to play the hero and save the day had dragged Narcissa Malfoy out of the grave, and he would have rejoiced if she had returned to the world as she’d once been.
“Wha—”
“Draco—”
. “Yes!”
“Not relevant. Anyways, the officer was a bit…rough with me. Long story mercifully short, I landed in A&E and face to face with John.”
“We’ll have her body cleaned and transferred back to the Manor,” a nurse had said, later. Hours had passed. The logistics of death stripped him clean, his chest cavity was bleached bones. Draco could see the daylight high in the sky out one of the windows.
“Draco!”
“Of course you have,” Hermione sighs into her cup.
“It sounds like something worth doing,” Hermione says, inspecting a chickpea bobbing lazily on her spoon. “And I bet it’s quite the story.”
Pansy had said.
“I’m not working with her,” Harry snaps, petulantly.
Harry’s magic crackles under his skin, restless and keen to jump into the fray.
“What day—”
Also, gentle warning for suicdality, which will feature briefly in this chapter.
“In which case, I need to revisit the meaning of this entire song. As a metaphorical conceit, it may be rather brilliant. Let’s listen to it one more time—”
“Oh fuck off,” Draco says, rolling into the pathetic excuse for a pillow. “Why am I here? Wait.” Draco tries to scowl, but finds his face rather soggy. “A better question. Why are you here.”
* * *
“Come here,” Harry says, the words involuntary.
“John,” the man says, grinning. “They told me you were posh. I didn’t realize quite how posh.”
* * *
It seems a reasonable conclusion to think that he is stuck in some other world, that the curse dropped him somewhere on their way back and hasn’t yet noticed that she lost her passenger.
“Oh Harry,” Hermione had said, patting the top of his head.  “C’mon Ron. Let’s get to work.”
“No, don’t!” Draco barks out. “It’s fine. You’re fine.”
Maybe this is the scales of justice, some karmic balancing act.
The rapid change of tack startles Draco into honesty. “Daniel wasn’t…he’s not the same. He’s not…”
“It’s such a waste,” Hermione had said, sighing into her coffee cup. Harry was sitting across from her, nibbling on a piece of toast. He’d graduated from the couch to the kitchen on occasion and Hermione marked this a victory.
“Lucy,” Malfoy says, striding into the middle of the group, “has auditory and tactile hallucinations. Do you know what that means?”
“Well, since I am the authority on Shakespearian tragedies, I assure you, this cabbage is the spitting image of Yorick.” Robertson grabs hold of the cabbage and lifts it up to his nose, as if attempting to make eye contact. “I was tempted to recite Hamlet’s speech, when he seizes upon the skull of a man he’d once known and reflects deeply on the inevitability of life and death. Upon how we all go to rot, king or jester, nobility or peasant. Of how death will come for every man. There is no escaping it.”
A pinch of floo powder and Harry’s head is in Ron and Hermione’s fireplace.
The curse had tugged him loose from a pile of sweaty limbs and cloudy breaths stuck against the windows.
Harry looks at the vial and then the time on the mantle. 2:07 pm. The night had melted into morning and then into afternoon and still, Harry hadn’t been able to stop.
Draco is nowhere to be found.
“I’m very good,” she says, giving him a wicked grin and Harry decides that he’s going to like maybe-Megan. “IV’s in.”
“Granger?” Pansy asks, downing the dregs of her cocoa in a single swallow.
“I thought we were celebrating your escape from Ministry clutches,” Pansy says, sipping her cooler. “Not criticizing my
Harry thinks, as he babbles “I want” and presses back into Draco’s erection (“I need,”), writhes against the hands that won’t give him an inch (“More”), that hold him and Harry knows will pull every pleasure out of the places he’s never shown anyone else.
“You’re in love,” Robertson says. “It’s written all over your face.”
“Proximity to the source of the spell may improve the strength of the summoning charm,” Hermione says. “He’s been gone a long time Harry. He might not be able to—I can’t promise that it will work.”
animal rescue. Harry knows there’s more to her than she’s letting on.)
“He’s a death eater miss,” someone finally says, but they sound afraid.
“Thank you, Darwin. You’re an absolute doll.”
“Someone told me…to come to you with the words of my betters?” A tiny grin crooks the corner of Harry’s lip. “To come with poets and other people with nice words.”
“I don’t get to have nice things.”
“We will get through this,” Pansy had said, squeezing his hand as they left Malfoy Manor behind—Pansy had made arrangements for a caretaker until Draco chose to return. “We’ll be okay.”
“Go away,” is all Harry says after a long silence. The line of his shoulders is so straight, so tight.
Smooth skin, sweaty and heavy. Hands that searched and touched him just there. How Draco had pressed him into the sheets, had moved so slow at first, so careful. Until he wasn’t and Harry had arched into it, had begged—
“Alright,” Horwood has said, slowly.
Self-loathing curls tight in Harry guts. Because he likes the dreams. Which was something he could deal with—privately, in the shower and under the covers, where no one else could see.
“I’ve found Jesus!” says Draco, with a bit more gusto than usual, his nerves still on edge.
Harry is unfazed. The task of acquiring several pints of human blood had fallen to him, and he’d agreed easily enough.
and the other half is reliving a dream where Malfoy’d pinned him in place and fucked him—
“Looks like an ear infection to me, Mr. Trembelt. Take these.” Harry tears the paper from the prescription pad and scratches his name across the bottom. “Twice a day for seven days and then come back to see me.”
“Isn’t it?” Draco says.
“Don’t,” Draco says, weary. “I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop apologizing if you do. So please…just don’t.”
, the sign reads. Harry can’t remember the last time he read a Muggle novel, and yet something about the store calls to him. The entire building could be under a cheering charm and the haphazard piles in the display window remind him of Hermione’s table at the library during exams. The sight makes him grin and he’s inside before he has a chance to think twice.
“What?” Ron says, not at all sheepish.
“I’m not going to try and…” Draco struggles for the words. “I’m not going to kill myself.”
“Faster. Yes.”
Draco thinks.
Hermione had swished her wand and vanished the pizza boxes. Harry felt a pang of loss. He’d grown quite fond of those pizza boxes. “You,” Hermione said, poking his cheek. “Shower. You smell like cheese.”
“What is it?”
Draco shrugs, breathing into his tea. He hasn’t removed his hand. Circle after circle, like a balm, as if that point of contact will hold this moment together. “You’ve been kind to me. Like when you spoke at my trial. I thought you hated me, and then there you were.”
It startles Draco, how quickly his shock can turn to fury.
A soft scuffle disturbs the quiet. Leather shoes on flooring. As Draco creeps down the hall, the warmth of a fresh fire casts long shadows out into the dark.
“I know. It didn’t exactly have the desired effect.”
The wounds are red as sirens. Harry can’t help him here, can only watch this older version of himself cast entry level healing spells that sew up the skin and ease the swelling.
“I’ll be the pinnacle of decency in no time. My purity will be unimpeachable.”
It was easy enough, to joke about how terrible he’d been. Pansy was a good sort, and would tease him until he felt normal again.
“Mmm,” Malfoy says, rising from his stool and bending down to collect Harry’s fallen papers. “Wrap this up by ten and then we’ll go.”
world,
The telltale pressure squeezes nausea from his pores, and Draco holds on, fingers tights in Harry’s. His feet clatter against industrial tile and Draco focuses on the hand that’s holding him, presses his chest into Harry’s spine.
“Real.”
“Yeah.” Harry flashes his ID badge. “I’m a resident.”
“You refuse to speak for nearly two hours,” a voice said and then Draco was looking up into those stupid green eyes that could only ever belong to one person. “And
And Harry goes a bit mad.
Of course there would. While the St. Mungo’s graduation celebration for newly minted healers was not a socially significant affair, the saviour of the wizarding world was attending a public event for the first time in years. High society would be chomping at the bit for a ticket. Every important ministry official would be in attendance.
The tension swells as they cross the threshold and it’s all Harry can do to stand in the enormous entrance hall and close his eyes. He wonders if houses remember. Magical dwellings had always felt more alive than Muggle, and Harry knows that Malfoy Manor has suffered wound after wound. The pain pushes behind his eyes, as if the house is trying to show him just how much it has endured, how desperately these festering hurts need to be lanced.
“I dreamt about you,” Harry whispers, much much later, pushing his face into Draco’s chest. It feels like a safe place to leave a confession, pressing the secret words onto Draco’s skin.
“What? No!” Harry scrambles to fix whatever he’s broken. His words, as always, are blunt objects. “I just…when I picture it. You with a kid.” Harry smiles. “It’s just unexpected.”
Draco tells Pansy that it was like fate had wrapped herself around him, slipped her fingers between his, and
“Your pen,” Harry says, curiously. “If I had pens like that, I wouldn’t hate charting as much.”
“Then?” Draco takes a breath to prepare for the plunge. “Then, I was in a pick-up truck driving across the Tundra with Harry fucking Potter.”
“—that this version of me is the worst version. I am the darkest timeline.” Draco can’t look at her. Not when he’s being this pathetic.
“Obviously,” Pansy says.
Dancing. They’d been dancing and Harry hadn’t realized how alive he’d felt until the music stopped.
Beside him, Harry makes a soft sound in his sleep and shuffles closer, pressing his sweaty heat to Draco’s chest.
. Draco’s conscious enough to know. Pain splinters and punches its greedy fingers through flesh and bone and Draco feels it at the centre of him.
“What is it with ancient family death curses and their refusal to just arrive at the point?”
“Pickup lines are blasé, my boy, and you deserve better.”
It’s only once Harry’s decided that no clues to Draco’s whereabouts can be found at the hospital (approximately seven days post fight) that Harry starts to apparate to the street in front of Draco’s flat. It’s not really that bad, Harry convinces himself, because it’s what an auror would do. And Draco’s essentially a missing person. Harry’s just a concerned citizen. What he’s doing is a public service, if nothing else.
“Thank you.”
Draco Malfoy had been missing for almost five years and Harry would know, because he had been looking for him.
“Because…because I’ve done things. Horrible things. And I don’t get to just move on. The villains don’t get a happily ever after.”
“What were you in the last one again?” says Pansy.
Powerful magic rends the air. Draco can feel the anger in it—he can taste the rage as it mingles with the blood in his mouth.
“—would I still have turned out to be so…” Draco doesn’t have the words.
He’s still drunk, he realizes, when the curse slips her fingers between his and spirits him away.
The chatter fades to static as Harry lolls his head back, drifts off into the memory of another world, another channel with a slightly different frequency, thinks of the way Draco had looked at him.
* * *
There’s a long moment, where Robertson just looks at Harry as if he’s only just realized that he’s there. There’s a story in his eyes, folded between smile lines.
Harry’s hands moved to his shoulders. A firm grip turned him, forced him to look straight into the sun.
For a moment, Harry almost retreats. It’s the look on Malfoy’s face that pulls him back. Grey eyes stare at the ceiling, vacant and sad. Almost like Malfoy has slipped out of focus, onto another track, into another world.
It’s been five years chasing the ghost of a snitch he’d never hoped to catch and here Harry is, at an anticlimax.
“You’re Harry Potter,” Ron had said. “Just introduce yourself and the work is done!”
It was a future they would never have and it was because of him, the result of choices Harry’d made that he’s still not sure were the right ones.
“He asked me not to,” Hermione said, avoiding his eyes.
“There,” Draco says, leaning back, but the space between them is infinitesimal, barely exists.
“What kind of spell!” Pansy yelps, far too loud. Several heads turn to look, and for a moment, Pansy seems a touch concerned that she’s breached the International Statute of Secrecy.
“The reason you were walking the line between life and death?”
“We do?”
“Er—right,” Harry answers and hangs up abruptly before he can make a mess of himself.
“Harry found her like that.”
“Hey,” says Harry, his eyes stuck to Malfoy, and dumps a half dozen charts onto the counter. His despair at the prospect of more charting is heavy, but not as heavy as the silence. Malfoy hasn’t acknowledged him—is still staring at the ceiling.
“Er,” Harry says, at a total loss. “Do you have a bag?” This seems to startle Robertson out of his musings. “CRADLE THE WORDS IN YOUR ARMS!” he bellows. “Treat them with dignity! REVERENCE!”
Draco is still panting. He may have lost a button or two from the strain.
“No,” Harry gasped, crossing the enormous room in a few hurried steps. “No no no.”
“I don’t know what I was thinking alright!” Draco says, waving his hands in protest.
“And I thought…” Draco tries to push on, but vulnerability has never come easily. “I thought it may show me if…if I’m irredeemably evil?”
sent my favourite slow acting death curse flying
Hermione jabbed him in the spine. “Sit up. You’re depressed and we need to do something about it.”
Harry can’t laugh, not quite, but his lips twitch. “Yeah, actually.”
“Right,” Harry said, worry lines still nudging his expression. “You remember it’s minus forty, yeah?”
, he thought,
“Harry?” Hermione says as he lands in the middle of the living room. It looks like a library threw up all over Draco’s fastidious decorating. “Harry is that you?” She’s papered over with dozens of stray parchments.
The seconds measure in the drip drip onto the pavement. Harry’s eyes flit from the crime scene on the steps to the door as it flies open.
“Ron, you stand there, and Pansy you—”
“Sing or pine?” Harry whispers, and Draco is as red as Ron’s hair.
“Don’t mistake the cocoa as kindness, Potter. If your pitiful little story doesn’t end with a detailed description of where you’ve taken Draco—”
“I agree Harry, but—”
“This is your fault, really,” Pansy says as the Spice Girls start to blare overhead.
“Draco—”
Harry thought about it sometimes, the way that Malfoy’s face had looked. He’s thinking about it now, as he stands in front of an office announcing the presence of a man he had never expected to find.
The end is approaching. I'm not ready <3
The gate clatters shut behind him. “Probation,” Draco says, again, as they walk up the lane.
“I didn’t try to die,” Draco snaps, because it really hadn’t been his plan as he wandered the streets towards Archway Bridge. Feelings swirl in his exploding skull—blonde hair dipped in blood, full lips kissing his neck, strong shoulders looking out over that hundred-foot drop, a boot on his neck and the wind in his air as it screamed across the Tundra. Stepping off into something else, something easier. “It was more complicated than that,” Draco whispers.
The metaphors dance with the dust motes, but the questions are as irresistible as the shop had been. “It’s…there’s this bloke.”
Indecision hovers like the stale smell of smoke. Harry shreds his cuticles.
A thread that resisted divergence, twisted tight around Draco, tying their lives into tandem. With love. Because Harry always loved him. With anger sometimes, and reluctance, and passion and something unfaltering. Harry Potter loved him.
“You’re an idiot,” the other Harry says, pained. “One day, you’re going to show up and I’m not going to be able to—”
“Fucking psycho,” Katie says, and Harry’s starting to get angry. Because can’t anyone see that Malfoy is standing right there, next to the wall of charts? His grey eyes are churning and Harry can feel a storm coming, but no one else seems to notice him, which is bizarre really. Because someone else is agreeing—
Harry’s kneeling next to an older man, the hard plastic of the clipboard pressed against his knees. He’s shirtless and Harry’s eyes drift over the loose folds of aging skin.
“We did,” Draco says, picking at his sleeves. “You wanted me there?”
“It’s Harry!”
Harry’s stomach lurches, and he leans back, feeling more like a nineteen-year-old who can’t handle his liquor and less like a twenty-two-year-old slayer of dark lords.
“What then?” Harry asks, stepping closer, wondering briefly what would happen if he were to reach out and touch. “Try being direct. I’ve heard it’s quite a concept in the modern world.”
“Don’t,” Harry says, and Draco sees that famous temper flash, “make me ask you again.”
Each iteration of his name lands with more force than the next, waves gathering strength as they are sucked back to sea.  “
“I fail to see how.”
“Stop it! Right this instant!” a voice says, slicing through the din and the pain.
Draco looks at him, admires the planes of his shoulders, the brown of his skin against the deep green fabric, and has to ball his fingers into fists to stop himself from tearing the clothes to pieces. Arriving with the buttons in tatters, the jacket wrinkled, the trousers damp would be well worth it, probably.
It’s magic at first. A stinging hex blooms across his cheek, something hot blisters up his back. The pain swaddles him and Draco doesn’t resist. For the first time in months, he knows how to handle something. There’d been pain at the manor. So much—
“What comparison?”
“You are Draco’s constant,” Hermione adds.
She raises two very stern eyebrow at him.
“What?” Granger says, clearly expecting him to say something else. “Why?”
Emotions
“But my scrubs—”
Harry smiles, picturing Malfoy on the balcony, wrapped up in the moonlight, all mystery and pent-up rage, black denim and unknowable tattoos.
“Not where people can see,” he’d said. Malfoy had recoiled as if slapped. “Not where people can see.”
“Yeah?” he says, and sees that she has a clipboard in her hands.
“It doesn’t feel real,” Draco says.
“That’s when Draco cast the spell.”
“Uh, yeah?”
“Sometimes,” Draco says as Harry gets to his feet, “I’m not sure that you’re actually here.”
“Oh, I was never worried,” Draco lies shamelessly.
“No!” Harry know just how messy it is to bleed; the body is just a walking juice box. The punctures spurt and pool, and the stone steps are quickly painted red.
“No.” The healer had been unequivocal. “It’s not her anymore.”
The shelves on the walls were filled decades ago, and stacks of books have started to climb next to them on the floor. It’s the room of requirement, but in the imagination of a bibliophile. The footpath from Historical Fiction to Life and Leisure is so obscured by titles, it’s barely wide enough for a single foot. Two people walking abreast would surely result in an avalanche of verbiage.
As soon as the verdict had come down, Narcissa spirited Draco out of the room. “To the apparition point,” she had said. “Quickly now.”
“Probation,” she says, and it feels like a question, a statement, and an exclamation all at once.
As if Draco doesn’t matter at all. It makes him want to lunge, grab Potter’s shoulders and shake him until he remembers that he used to care about what Draco was up to. That he used to look at Draco with something more than pity.
“Oh?”
“I know I know!” Harry says, searching for the source of the noise, but only because it rings again and again and again.
Draco considered locking the honesty away, but he was so cold and Potter’s voice was so earnest. Eighteen years of pure blood breeding and Potter still—always—had him undone.
Until he’d watched himself flicker out of existence—it was a rather bleak thing to witness, knowing that one day he would stop coming back.
“Course he has,” Ron says. “We all have.”
“No shit, Sherlock,” Pansy says, strutting back into the living room with a cup in each hand. “I’ve become quite the expert in Muggle sayings, by the way.”
“Right,” Draco says. “Could you come and whisper at it until the cash drawer opens?”
Relief is a momentary rush, and Harry’s grateful.
* * *
“I wanted to—”
“What the fuck is wrong with you two!” Harry says, trying not to let his temper flare.
But the blood was everywhere, pooling around her head, sprayed on stone. They’d used it as ink to write on the walls.
“I find that I agree with Miss Parkinson,” Narcissa says and Draco’s blood runs cold.
“I’d like to volunteer,” he’d finally squawked, his arms full of Marlowe and Dickens. “I’ve got some community service hours and I’d like to do them at your shop.”
“Why are you being so nice to me?” Harry asks, because this is not how it’s supposed to work. Malfoy is a slur in Harry’s mouth, they talk with curses, not words. They cut each other open; they don’t put each other back together.
“What—”
“I’m not pining!” But it was futile, arguing with Pansy, because she was right.
the curse had said and Draco had known that each universe would cost him.
Nothing.
The scene that meets his eyes fills him with terror.
“Obviously,” Harry says, and means it.
“Draco Malfoy is probably going to spend the next five to ten years in Azkaban,” Hermione said, looking down at the article, her sharp eyes flying across the newsprint.
“I—” Harry opened his mouth and found that he didn’t know the answer to that.
“That Muggles cram live horses into the boot of their car-thingers?”
If the silence is listening, it does not answer him.
The look that blooms across Pansy’s features is kaleidoscopic—horror and excitement and ravenous for more.
“Reminiscent of a teenage rivalry.”
Harry has pressed play and the story must continue, moving forward into the things that happen next when someone is dying.
she says.
“I’m occasionally quite callous,” Draco says, dabbing the single ply slip of tissue under his eyes. “It’s not one of my better qualities.”
Pansy had said.
The halls were silent, the portraits had fled from their frames. Everything was quiet and Harry realized that, whatever had happened, he was too late.
He was not going in there. “Or are you just going to stand there, staring at the crisis worker?”
“He must’ve gotten dragged into another universe,” Pansy says, the words still floating. “Fuck. He’s never been gone this long. Never.”
Those angry green eyes stretch wide, the fury in them blinks out, and Harry Potter is suddenly soft. His lips—that have kissed Draco until his cheeks were raw from the stubble—fall open. Draco hadn’t known this look for what it was—not at first—but he’d learned.
And suddenly he’s tired. He’s so tired. Their words were sandpaper on skin. Everything was edges with Draco—sharper but beautiful too—and Harry couldn’t sand him down, could only make him bleed.
“I have no idea what that means,” he says.
Draco had lied. To himself and the curse. But she knew. Draco didn’t understand it—the hows of it were made of magic—but he knew that the curse could feel the want still thrumming in Draco’s blood.
Ron’s face matches his hair. “Harry! Why didn’t you get food?” he wails. “I can’t take her without food.”
this box contains. It could explode at any moment—they both know it.
“Do you have anything meaningful to contribute?” says Pansy, but she’s too sad to be properly angry.
“Did I answer?” Draco asked and he found that he really wanted to know.
* * *
“What time is it,” Pansy asks as they spill, messy and tired, into their flat.
The air is even cooler, the wind blowing his hair across his forehead. He feels the strands catch in his lips.
The strings of light turned black.
“I do.” That face. Draco knows that face and yet—
Harry wanted to write it off as a fucked up fantasy gone wrong—would’ve done, if that was all that it had been. Except that the dreams weren’t just sex. Not by a long shot.
“We’re in a truck.” Draco was confused and facts had babbled out of his mouth.
“We’re still not sure how they breached the wards,” one of the aurors goes on. There’s blood, dried in a strange shape across Potter’s chest. As if he’d pressed something tight against and refused to let go.
Robertson seems to sense this. “What’s troubling you. What stress is wriggling beneath that brow?”
“Ah. I suppose that would do it.”
, Harry thinks, and the need to know is a wild animal. Question after question expands in his chest, a thousand conversations he can’t wait until his next shift to have, but that he knows he must endure because he has stalked Malfoy before and knows the signs.
“Well, it was quite awkward.” There’s a smiley face pressed into a few of the tablets, a garish promise for later. Draco thinks it’s a bit tacky.
“—I’m so tired of fucking idiots—”
“I’m fine,” Harry had grumbled and rolled away from her, pressing his face into a crusty cushion.
Those eyes, green as a killing curse and a summer afternoon, look at Draco in the mirror’s reflection. Draco’s grateful he’s not taking the full blast, grateful that it’s only a reflection because his knees are already weak. “So do you.”
And those fucking grey eyes looking across the room at the person on the stretcher—the attention is singular, focused, as if this patient is the only person in the world who matters.
* * *
The day moves slow, a road trip to nowhere, and the combination of a serious lack of sleep and a  marathon of reality television melts the finer points into mush. Which may help explain why it takes him so long to notice the persistent thumping coming from the hall.
cuts costs.” That smart mouth is cutting poor Amber apart.
“You idiots. You fucking idiots,” Pansy says, and she rounds on him fully then. Black circles, smudged eyeliner, panic cast in brown irises and Harry can’t look away. “Listen to what I’m telling you. Draco is cursed.”
“I’ve given you no reason to find me sinister,” Draco says, but Robertson’s in a bluster and doesn’t hear him.
“I suppose being the Chosen One affords you advantages the rest of us can only dream of.” Each word is a tiny cut. “One call to Shacklebolt and I’m sure you could have had any job you wanted.”
The room is dark but for the orange glow of the streetlamp, but Harry can see. He can see Draco let his joggers slip down past his hips. Egyptian cotton is a soft caress as his shoulder blades sink into the sheets.
But Draco is already moving slowly towards the boom box, creeping on his tip toes, lest he startle it into explosions. He jabs at the next song button.
“—for our sins! The similarities are honestly quite stunning. If he’s not a Christ rip off, he’s at least Christ-like.”
she says.
Bella swaggers across the counter and sniffs at Draco’s plate, nose held high in something that approaches feline elegance. Draco feeds her the corners of his toast.
Or not.
Except there are so many faces. The whispers fall like arrows
Something crackles under his skin as he steps up onto the bridge—something like destiny, although Draco has no idea what it means. The traffic rumbles beneath them and Draco can’t help his shudder as he thinks about the metal monsters flying through the night, separated from him by a piece of concrete and a Muggle engineering.
There’d been no avoiding it. To transfer the portion of the Malfoy fortune required by the Ministry and fulfill the terms of Narcissa’s sentence, she had to sign. In person. Goblins were old fashioned like that—refused to accept anything less.
“What the fuck does that mean?” Harry says, but they’re not listening.
It’s not that Draco wanted to marry Potter. Make violent love to him? Maybe. Wrap him up in warm blankets and push his hair back from his forehead and whisper sweet nothings into his ear? Perhaps. But marriage? That, Draco thought, was a step too far.
, you idiot!”
“I didn’t mean to stomp,” Potter says, and his voice is gravel and sleepless nights.
“You’re terrible,” says Ron, but takes his Breezer, looking at it as if it’s a revelation. “You know, this tastes too good to be alcoholic.”
“He did,” Draco says, sombre, their heads barely an inch apart. They’re both grinning. “So, obviously, the comparison has to be made.”
Draco’s head is on a swivel, taking everything in. There are men in dark cloaks—
Draco looks up for the half-dozen multi-coloured tablets he’s just poured onto the plastic top of his record player. “It’s not candy,” Draco says. “I don’t think.”
“I hate you,” Draco whispers and if Robertson hears him, he doesn’t let on.
“Doesn’t want you?” For a moment, Malfoy looks at Harry like he’s a math problem. “Potter, are you trying to tell me you fancy Emma?”
“This is what a thousand eyes feels like,” Draco mutters.
“I’m here for their trial,” he Potter, his voice unapologetic and clear.
is talking.
“Potter?”
“Don’t,” Draco says, the single word quiet. Sharp.
“Neither of you have much experience being kind to one another,” Hermione says through a long yawn. “But I think you can salvage this.”
“If this isn’t life or death, I will spell you flaccid,” Hermione says, rubbing her eyes, not realizing that Harry’s head hovering in the flames beneath their mantle until he snorts with laughter.
. “What is at the centre of your distress?” he asks, not unkindly. “If I were to pare it down, boil all of the dramatics to a single urgent need. What is the X that marks the spot?”
“Draco?” Harry says, and it hurts to look at him. The green suit had been a terrible idea, because his love for this man is seeping from his retinas and it hurts, to love like this.
Draco had never let himself consider it, had never thought about what it must’ve been like, to be Harry Potter, capital ‘C’ chosen one, with the weight of the wizarding world literally on these trembling shoulders. It had never occurred to him to consider Harry’s fragility, because he’d always seen him as unbreakable. Even with the Dark Lord living in his home, Draco had always expected Potter to come through. It was just something Harry did. Overcame.
They’re inside the Fiendfyre and everything is burning. Draco feels his rage lashing out in fire and fists. “Why is it always you?” Draco's hands are flailing, his whole body curdled with violence. He’s hitting something. Harry.
“Hold still.” Draco knows that it’s not Harry, that it’s
Pleasure swirls around them and Harry’s drunk on it as Draco moves up his body, holds himself above him, forearms bracketing Harry’s face. He traces the tip of one finger down Harry’s nose.
okay?” Pansy is a sneaky sort, moving softly through the flat. Draco suspects she’s spent however many days since the funeral walking on the tips of her socked toes, treating Draco much like she would his old boom box, easily startled into explosions. Until she’d spoken, Draco hadn’t known she was there.
Draco’s emotional free fall finds something solid in Potter’s face. He knows this face as well as he knows his own. Draco has traced his fingertips along the bridge of this nose, has pushed confessions between these lips, has watched these same eyes soften from Avada Kedavra to a summer afternoon. This world is real because Draco has seen love move across this face and knows that
“Respect the craft!!”
.” Potter’s voice washes over him and Draco gives in.
“No.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re breaking and entering!”
“A hearty yes, my young felon.”
“I don’t…where? I don’t understand…”
No one’s moving, a thousand breaths trapped in a thousand chests. Purple robes frozen, slack jaws hanging in stasis. The silence is unnatural—this many people shouldn’t be so still.
Harry stops, and there it is.
“Draco, you know that I haven’t,” says Amber.
Slipping into the memory feels like stepping into someone else’s shoes. Harry shivers as he sees the cab of the truck, and then laughs as he sees Draco’s confused face shift to abject horror.
“I was at the market, and I came upon these lovely cabbages. And as I was picking them up, examining each one for that special something that will turn an average borcht into an exquisite one, I couldn’t help but to think about Hamlet’s musings once confronted with the skull of Yorick.”
Harry throws the door open.
“It’s not like people haven’t died before,” Harry finally says. “I’ve seen it. I see it. All the time.”
It’s fun, at first. Squished in between the windshield and the clutch, Harry smiles as Draco stutters his way through social interaction.
And then, “Have you thought of healing?” Hermione had said, offhand. Harry had seized the idea with single-minded attention, had sunk his teeth into the concept. Healing was the first thing since Malfoy’s trial that had made him feel alive.
he thinks.
“I’m coming!” Harry shouts, scrambling for an undershirt. He needs to hurry, because if he doesn’t, the demon cat will not be happy, and when she’s unhappy…Harry shudders and hurries down the stairs to the kitchen.
They’re both yelling now. They always escalate. Always heat so fast. Too hot to touch, too hot to soothe. “And what about when I tried to explain!”
“Why do Slytherins have to be so cryptic?” Harry mutters and Bella howls in agreement. The mistress of evil has been curled around Harry’s feet ever since he stumbled back through the floo, box in hand, patted down by Pansy’s assurances that he will understand everything as soon as he watches these memories.
“I didn’t run away! I’m trying to tell you—”
“I came to find you,” Harry says, stepping onto the gravel shoulder, closing the distance.
, Draco thinks, staring up at the sky as if the condensation is a personal slight.
Harry thinks.
A man in his late twenties sits, one leg crossed over the other, a light blue dress shirt tucked into his jeans. “Who are you?” Draco asks, squinting against the florescent light currently burning his retinas to a crisp.
She’s been calling to him.
“—attention seeking horseshit—”
The calamity was stale.
“What then?” Draco says, voice unrecognizable. “Do you enjoy seeing me low, Potter? Suffering for my sins?”
“Obviously?”
“Once we start the incantation, we can’t stop. Not until he’s back. Not for anything—”
“Have you uncovered any sinister plots? Why did he vanish? Is he actually living as a Muggle?”
It hadn’t worked. Hysterical “Harry Potters!” would greet him at every door, followed by either clingy fans or bitter looks at Harry and his train of admirers.
Harry flings his ballpoint pen across the table, shouting, “don’t look at me like that. I’ll get to you later!” at his documentation before slamming the door behind him. It was a stroll. A casual jaunt through the hospital to clear his head. It has noting to do with Malfoy.
Names dance behind Draco’s eyes, unzipping into letters. It’s a beautiful blur and, for a moment, Draco doesn’t think about last night. Pansy Parkinson was a menace—filled with optimism and terrible plots to improve his mood—and Draco would not wallow in self pity. He wouldn’t.
“You sound ridiculous when you appropriate Muggle slang,” he says, trying for a joke.
“I shouldn’t have said any of that shit.” The words feel like an epilogue that he’s not ready to write, but he presses on. “I didn’t mean half of it.”
“Didn’t really think it through and now the consequences are a touch more…enormous? than I originally anticipated.”
“They take their strange form of entertainment very seriously,” Pansy says, eyes glinting as Hermione settles next to her—it’s a hungry look and Harry reminds himself to warn Ron of the dangerous and effective sexual wiles of Pansy Parkinson, which he has now seen first-hand. She’s relentless.
“What gave that away?” Draco asks, sarcastically.
“I don’t know—” Harry spins in place, gasping. There are books and antique lamps, throws and plants, shoes and Harry’s spinning, the air is coming, faster and faster. He can’t breathe, his head is white noise and panic. Because he’d only just started to know him, and now he’s gone again.
Ropson had said. What was her crime? Loving the wrong man? Taking the wrong side?
Harry can feel his pulse in his throat. Malfoy knows his schedule. Which means he sought it out, which means he was thinking about him—the mobile pings and Harry can’t look at it quickly enough.
and it became a post war anthem. Anger was in the water and the temperature of the entire world was set blood to boil.
Harry visits sixty one new universes while Hermione and Pansy plot their way into oblivion. In the middle of this madness, the cheeky owner of an old bookstore teaches Harry how to properly woo the object of his affections.
The man in front of him is built like a pit bull and is looking at Harry like he’s the world’s biggest joke. “Are you sure? Cause I’ve talked to my friend who’s a chiropractor and she said—”
In the four months since he cast the spell, the curse had come for him a half-dozen times. When he considered it logically, Draco knew that the fingers that slipped between his and tugged him into another version of his life couldn’t be real—were just an expression of a spell in physical elements. Still, the touch felt kind, delicate. The curse talked to him and Draco could feel the honesty in the words—it was a magic that didn’t know how to lie. Draco squeezed her hand when she pulled him into other worlds and he went home with her when the story was done.
“No,” Harry says, and he won’t stop looking at him.
“I don’t see how this is helping—"
Harry lingers in the shower long after he’s finished washing. As steam chokes the air, Harry breathes deep into the damp, lets the water pressure pound his shoulders.
“AND!” Pansy says, lifting her finger in delight. “He used to think boom boxes would explode!”
It’s been four days since he’d apparated into Draco—and apparently Pansy’s—flat and he’s not slept more than a few hours since then. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t pull himself away from the memories, pouring bottle after bottle into the pensieve.
Draco snorts—it’s undignified and wonderful. “Hair should not be orange,” Draco says, and he’s smiling at her. “And frosted tips will never be cool. Just wait. Future decades will laugh at you.”
“Why are you looking at that candy like it contains the meaning of life?”
And when Not-Potter had pressed his lips to Draco’s ear and said, “Let’s take this somewhere else,” Draco went. Because the last time he’d thought about his dick was after a jaunt with Potter across the Alaskan Tundra and he needed to wash that down with something else. Tequilla. A cheap Potter knock off. Anything.
The desire for sleep presses heavy on his eyelids, but Harry knows the wounds will fester. Years ago, he’d have let them, but he’s not seventeen anymore.
“You came back with books and not food?” Ron howls, sounding a lot like Bella. Harry shrugs, dumping his purchases into the squishy accent chair he’s claimed as his own in the disaster area that Pansy and Hermione have created. The living room looks much less like Draco’s clean modern lines and more like the inside of Hermione’s brain. Harry is briefly relieved that these two were never forced together at Hogwarts, before Ron drags him back.
, not for Harry, but he could pretend. “Stop lying.”
All Harry’s ever wanted was to fix things. The breeze filters through the sheer white drapes; Harry can smell lemons in the air. He feels lighter.
“No one does a Power Ballad quite like you,” Draco says as Celine’s voice fills the flat. It’s soothing, in the way that only strong French Canadian vocal cords can be.
, five Slytherins united against a world that may not want them anymore.
“It would be so simple,” Harry says, and his voice loses its focus, goes dreamy and listless. “One foot, and then another, and then you just let it all go.”
“Can she feel anything?” Draco remembers asking.
The end of Harry’s sentence was cut off by the wind searing the world clean.
“I’ve even drafted you a summary of the potential savings for the hospital in that lovely report I placed it in your mailbox three weeks ago. Have you had a chance to review it?”
Bodies are everywhere. Dead eyes staring up at him in the Great Hall, corpses on the Quidditch pitch, Dumbledore broken at the bottom of the Astronomy tower and Dobby limp in his arms. White blonde hair covered in blood, pale lips blue. Bodies cold on a stretcher, bodies twisted by curses, bodies covered in angry gashes gorging into flesh. A body living in his chest, cold and sick and dormant.
It was complicated. It was so very very complicated.
“Wait.” Pansy’s attention sharpens. “You and Draco? In
The feelings froth and bottleneck and somehow, their bodies have figured it out. Forgiveness and desire overflow.
* * *
“Me neither.” Draco closes his eyes and he can almost feel the heat of Potter’s body, the smell of old leather, the stubble scratching against his cheek. “Me neither.”
The whispers, though, fall upon him like arrows.
“But I love him,” Draco says as the world starts to slip between his fingers. “I love him.”
Harry comes with Draco Malfoy inside of him, green eyes meeting grey, pinned in place by desire that’s raw and desperate and
Those tight knuckles release and Draco flexes his fingers. “You’re a horrible host,” he says, brushing rain from his shoulders. “Can we sit?”
He’s panting now. Letting the sombre lyrics wash over him.
“Well,” Draco says, wishing that he could turn away, but those green eyes pin him in place. “What if I’ve made my peace with oblivion? What if I’d rather live a hundred lives where I get—”
Harry hadn’t.
The angry itch flares and Draco is on his feet. Potter’s just so fucking close.
Feverish simmers and Draco moves slow, coaxes Harry’s body to the edge of reason and leaves him boneless. Fingers stretching him open. The pressure drives him wild, and Draco is so purposeful about it, so intensely focused. Harry’s mouth is open, the touch both too much and not enough.
“The whole thing is a metal contraption!”
The words swim on the screen and Harry has no idea what to make of them. Text messages offer very little context, Harry thinks. It’s impossible to tell if Malfoy is being playful or nasty.
“Shit.”
“You landed pretty hard, I heard,” a voice says, but Draco has no time for anyone else. Not now. Not when his head is has decided to go supernova.
In the days and weeks after the war had shuddered to a halt, Harry felt his insides start to decay. He didn’t want or hate, he didn’t care or breathe. He’d left a part of him behind at King’s Cross.
“Yeah. Royal London Hospital.”
“I’m not the one who insisted on Muggle fashion.”
Draco forces his key into the lock, trying to forget that his shoes are currently the consistency of soggy bread.
is all he has time to think before he looks up.
“It feels a bit like breaking and entering,” Ron says, whispering too.
was a wound that would never heal, penance that Draco would carry for the rest of his life, because happy endings were earned.  In this universe, Draco knew, the door to this one possibility (at least with Potter) was closed.
“What?”
“S’alright,” Harry said, not ready to explain the circulatory system and blood draws to two pure blood wizards. “I can get the blood.”
“That all sounds lovely—”
“You were…” Harry struggles for the words, they’re so ridiculous. “Pulled into another universe? Really Malfoy? Couldn’t come up with anything else?”
“How pedestrian,” Blaise said, and licked the salt off Pany’s skin with a wry smile.
“I can’t speak multiple languages.”
“Stupid,” Draco says to his empty flat. The disappointment tastes bitter on his tongue.
“In A&E. You saw me? I wasn’t imagining it?”
“I mean. The last name business is a bit childish,” Harry says.
“You’re positive that we’re not disturbing anyone?” Hermione whispers.
What had been confusion this morning and shame this afternoon has matured to something angrier.
Harry does his best not to slam the soup bowl. “I’m fine.”
“I came here to try and talk to you!” There’s mania in Draco’s eyes, but Harry’s too angry to care.
do. But he’s got his mobile out and that’s where the bad choices lay in wait.
“—clever, witty, devilishly handsome—”
Draco looks down at his robes, notices that they’re different than the ones he would normally wear. The material is heavier, and now that there aren’t a dozen curses flying above his head, Draco can feel subtle spellwork woven into the threads. Anti-inflammatory spells, water resistant material, spells to resist stains and blemishes—Draco chuckles at his vanity, but isn’t surprised. He checks his pockets. Dragon leather gloves and sprigs of sage and rosemary.
“Depends?” Draco says, and he does not like the way not-Potter is looking at him. The glint in his eye is suspicious.
she says.
“Hate crime—”
“It’s not that,” Draco said, Harry still behind him, his touch still and steady.
“Potter are you still asleep?” Pansy says.
The smells hit him first, bright smells—fresh basil and mint leaves and maybe parsley? Harry’s never really been on first name terms with herbs, but he would bury his face in whatever that smell is—
“More help?”
For a long moment that could only have been a few seconds but that feels like forever, the words hang in the air between them. The sincerity in Draco’s voice, in the way that he’s looking at Harry, almost convinces him. Almost. “Are you fucking joking?”
Potter’s close. It’s uncanny, but Draco can feel Potter’s eyes. He’s always known when Harry Potter was looking at him.
“I could just apparate into his flat,” Harry says to an imaginary audience. “I mean, he’s invited me before. And he could be in trouble.” Deep in his guts, Harry knows it’s wrong, understands that he’s blasting a giant selfish hole in Draco’s boundaries, recognizes that he’s reverted fully to the obsessive behaviours of sixth year, but he can’t find it within himself to care.
Pansy fixes him with her most solemn gaze. “Cross my heart.”
And they’d disappeared back inside.
“No. I don’t think I will, thanks. Draco, look at me.”
“Um!” Harry jerks away, stumbling into a very dead potted plant.
Ron scrambles up from a stiff-backed wooden chair and crosses the room in a few lanky strides. “What’re you doing here? It’s late, isn’it?”
“Oh?”
“What’s wrong with you? Of course I noticed. We came together.”
They fold back into the house, slipping from room to room. Draco moves between groups, chattering nonsense. At some point, he presses a drink into Harry’s hands. The world feels pliable, off kilter.
“It’s not! You’re all so—” Pansy stands beneath the massive front door, mouthing insults into the dark. “So Gryffindor!” she says, finally. “Stop it with the needless dramatics and get the fuck inside.”
The streets of Diagon are bright against the afternoon, sunlight glancing off windowpanes. People are bustling in a way they hadn’t during the war—the world is learning how to move again. Draco swallows hard and resists the urge to take his mother’s hand.
“I arranged the purchase in case you wanted to take a break from the…” Narcissa considers her words, “the judgement of the post war reckoning. Until today, I hadn’t thought…I didn’t think…it would be necessary.”
“Stop!” Harry says, and Bella meows and Harry finally finds the device causing the commotion in a drawer in his entranceway.
“I like the air,” Malfoy says, leaning his head back against the house and taking a long swallow.
Draco thought.
“I’m fine,” Draco says, staring down at his next bad decision and first foray into mind altering substances. Robertson would have cause to call him a deviant now.
Firm hands take him by the shoulders, haul him up from the ground, steady him. “I’m sorry,” Harry says, brushing some of the dirt off of Draco’s robes. His hands are too big for it.
Harry thinks as he stares at Malfoy brushing hair from his eyes. But they come anyways. The memories always have, with Malfoy.
“Did you want to talk about it?” John asks, tilting his head to the side and meeting Draco’s eyes in a way that is so much like Potter that Draco wants to punch something.
“Yeah,” Harry says, realizing that he
“You’re a menace,” Draco says, but goes. His heart is pounding and there’s sweat dripping down his back.
“Or is this some return to your repressed teenage stalker phrase? Figuring out what the evil Mafloy is up to?”
For a moment, Harry is frozen in place, filled with a violent urge to grab hold of Draco and just hold him still. Under Harry’s hands, where he can make sense of him. But Malfoy is moving into the warmth and Harry, helpless and confused and chasing the heat of Draco’s lips, follows.
“From a friend. A curse? Maybe fate?” Harry’s brow squiggles, puzzled. “I dunno what she was, but she took me by the hand and—”
The bartender lines up six shot glasses and starts to pour. The wooden countertop is filthy, varnished with the sticky remnants of shots mishandled. “Race you,” Pansy cackles, downing shot after shot with the confidence of someone practiced.
. Resistance, he knew, was futile.
There’s an inch between them—maybe less—and Harry closes it, leaves his lips there for Draco to take. The listless fields sway as the sun melts off the sky, and Draco buries his fingers in the neck of Harry’s shirt. Pushes back into Harry’s space. Bends over him, their chins touching, and holds on, possessive and urgent and almost but not quite there.
The concern is sincere and unexpected, and it knocks Draco off kilter. “I had no idea you cared.”
” Draco had said, when Harry’d growled about the upcoming end to his residency at Royal London Hospital.
Pansy nods. “The one who washes windows at the intersection in front of Robertson’s shop?”
“Why not?” Harry hears himself say and, god, is he desperate to hear the answer.
“It tomorrow, and we haven’t talked about what could happen if—”
Draco stares until he finds whatever he’d been looking for, and then stands. He does not let go of Harry’s hand.
“If you don’t all leave this instant, I will report each and every one of you to the Ministry and have you brought up on charges of assault, creating a public disturbance, and hate crimes.”
The night had started to tilt after that—everything felt like it was one of those Muggle records (Draco needed to buy some of those) spinning and spinning. There’d been eyes on him all night. Angry ones, but others too. Eyes that were hungry and black and, fuck, it had been so nice to have someone look at him with something other than disgust.
, Harry thinks, and then
Harry rolls his eyes and herds them towards a smaller wooden table, tucked in the far back corner.
, Harry thinks as he pushes his feelings out into sweat and heat and screaming muscles.
Harry hadn’t been able to explain it, not even to himself. When Ron would give him that funny look or Hermione would pat him on the shoulder and sigh, Harry would remind them that Malfoy was a missing person—Harry had made sure of it, reporting Malfoy’s absence to the Ministry himself, although the Aurours never did much about it. “He could have been murdered!” Harry would insist and Ron and Hermione would exchange a look—the same look, every time—and would let the matter drop.
He doesn’t.
“Given the circumstances, I’m guessing you didn’t get laid?” Dark eyes dusted with blue eye shadow gleam at him from behind a box of Museli.
“Just to clarify,” Draco had said. “That’s a yes?”
This Potter is weary, chapped around the edges, hungry for home. Draco is too.
Draco thinks, and barely resists making a public display, internal logistics of the universe be dammed. But he doesn’t, instead forcing himself to be content in the delicious red flush up that long neck.
“What? What happened? Where is she?” Draco needs to find her, needs to make sure that she’s alright.
“I like Muggle fashion. Muggle face paint. You like the weird thinky types.”
“I highly doubt that,” says Pansy, and Draco can’t bear the concern that twists on her lovely face.
“Draco, about that night at the manor. I’m—”
“I’m going to take you to bed,” Draco says, and Harry’s in his pants and a single sock, somehow, and he knows he doesn’t stand a chance. That he was lost the moment he apparated away from those restless automatic doors.
Narcissa is standing in the doorway to the sitting room. She’s carrying a tray of biscuits and a pot of tea in her hands.
Harry had never been a very good dancer. Parvati Patil had given an in-depth interview to
“Sounds fake,” Pansy says.
The lines of Malfoy’s neck slip under Harry’s skin. The balcony is a metal cage of wrought iron twisting like cursive. Harry leans against the railing, close to Malfoy.
“It’s not that,” Draco says, and Harry can’t stop staring, because this isn’t how it’s supposed to be.
For a moment, Harry can’t breathe. A small panic is brewing in his chest, but he needs to reply, because if he leaves it too long, Draco will know and that thought makes the small panic feel much bigger.
“You’re the one who disappeared,” Harry says.
“Would I have been different? Better? If things had been different. If I’d been brave, just once. If I’d made one good decision, been kind instead of selfish. If I’d been born in a Hobbit hole under a mountain and no wizards ever came to bother me—”
It’s cumulative, the pain in his chest. The weight of his mother’s body, lowered into the ground and of the feet kicking him in front of Gringotts, of a thousand futures he will never have and one pair of green eyes that will never look with love. The scars on his chest will never fade and the pitch of his soul will never lighten. And right now, the white lights flying by feel less like dying and more like flying.
. Unless it’s a metaphor—”
“After the trial,” Harry tries again. “You just…” A fern spills out of its hanging pot, dripping onto Harry’s fingers.
The world squeezes, makes sausage of him, until his feet collide with something solid, and Harry remembers that he has a body made of flesh and parts that have a place. He’s never gotten used to apparating.
“Maybe that’s why I’m being
“It’s 360 miles from Anchorage to Fairbanks. Take your complaints up with geography.”
Diagon is humming with energy and September is the worst month for this, Draco realizes. All of the children who are returning to Hogwarts will be shopping for their supplies.
Handover in A&E is at 5:00pm and Harry’s watch tells him he has forty minutes until he needs to be back in Emerg.
“You okay, mate?” It’s Ron.
“You’re clearly upset,” Hermione says, scratching Bella under the chin.
“I know enough,” Pansy says.
It was as his mind self-flagellated and his tear ducts refused to release that the curse came for him.
February is melting into March, but the night still bites at his neck, nips the tips of his fingers. The tight leather coat he’d worn because Pansy insisted it made him look “tragic and fuckable” was not at all warm.
“Sit.” Pansy is stern and Harry is afraid and so he rises from the floor and collapses onto the sofa without protest. The shock of Pansy’s appearance mingles with the panic and Harry feels weak, like all his bones have gone soft.
, for some reason, you wouldn’t have fared any better,” Draco huffs. “He’s worn me down with his persistence. That’s all.”
“Hmm,” Draco says, looking at his desk. Nothing about the office is ostentatious, not in the way that Harry had expected it to be.
“He did not,” Draco breathes. It wasn’t possible. Robertson couldn’t have—
Draco caresses the ledge, presses his palms flat against the concrete railing. “I don’t want to die,” he says, and the crisp winter air balloons from his lips in a smoky puff. Pansy would call him a dramatic little shit, because of course he would narrate his own descent into despair.
“I don’t think a
dramatic,” he says after a moment.
Potter is ragged, like a messy draft of the person Draco used to know. His edges are scribbles and there are dark smudges under his eyes.
Harry stops in front of him and stands there. Just stands there.
“I did not!”
Draco rolled his eyes and then realized that Harry couldn’t see him. “I’m not nice, Potter,” he said, distilling his look into words.
“Please,” he says, and again, “Please,” but the word stutters on the pleasure, it’s so intense. He’s sweating and squirming. Draco kisses the inside of his thighs, and Harry has never been kissed there before.
, he was going to say, but doesn’t.
he wants to asks,
Draco remembers holding her hand, as they removed the stasis charm, as his mother slipped slowly back into death.
Harry’d wanted to scream. But he hadn’t. He’d just stopped going to parties.
“Not sure how that’s relevant right now.”
Later, he wasn’t sure if he’d woken up or come back. The logistics felt wobbly.
the way Harry looks at him. The universes are different, the context wild and varied, but that look…it does not change or falter.
“I can’t—” but Draco’s words dissolve into a strangled sound.
There is a long silence, in which Draco collects himself from the floor with as much dignity as he can manage—not very much—and Robertson levels him with one of his serious looks. “Draco. Why don’t you tell me what’s actually ailing you? Rather than your failure to engage in what the bard would call the beast with two backs.”
“I came to return your wand,” Harry says weakly, answering the words Draco hadn’t quite managed. He lifts one hand and gestures to a box, a deep walnut with images of whimsy carved into the top.
Robertson grunts, and it’s got the vocal range of a
“If you want to get your medical advice from your friend, be my guest,” Harry says, itching to get the man out of his office. This is his morning appointment and there’s a chance that Draco’s in his office and it’s easy enough to just walk over there. Harry knows where it is. There’s nothing weird about taking a stroll.
“Direct instruction is woefully underrated,” Draco agrees.
he’d thought then, and he thinks the same thing now.
Five years, and Harry had finally found him, hadn’t expected to find him working in A&E.
“Do you remember sketchy Greg?” Draco asks, trying to keep his voice light and this conversation as far away from the grief that’s writhing at the centre of him.
Draco’s knuckles look like they’re about to burst through his skin. “I know it looks bad,” Draco says, the words tight through clenched teeth.
“Mine,” Harry says against Draco’s lips, into his mouth, out of his mind. “Mine.”
Draco snorts, but lets her lead him inside. It looks like he may have to tell Pansy about the curse after all.
“Oh.” The moment right before catastrophe always feels breakable.
“Can’t believe,” Draco drops his gaze, tastes his neck. “We shouldn’t—”
“Dr. Potter?” A voice says—
. Draco supposes she hadn’t been wrong—not exactly.
It’s 1998, and Draco's busy wooing the owner of his favourite with his favourite Muggle bookshop with wily felonious charm. However, everything is not so rosy as regular employment with musty novels. Draco is somehow much less charming when he runs into what Pansy calls “A raging, mindless, hateful mob!” (We’re with you on that one, Pansy)
It’s too much, seeing Potter like this. Still trying to save the world—one rotten death eater soul at a time.
“Right.” Malfoy’s eyes are all over his face. Harry’s cheeks go up in flames. “There’s really no need to run away from me.”
Except there is no Harry Potter trailing behind him. “Not in this universe,” Draco slurs, eyes still closed, chin still tipped to the big black sky. “There’s no one coming for me.”
* * *
Alcohol had made things much easier. Pansy insisted on this ghastly clear liquid called tequila.
“What do you mean?”
It’s all a dizzy mess, when the Wizengamot opens the proceedings. Draco's crimes are described in that horrible kind of detail that looks too close, and everything is huge and ugly.
“What on earth are you talking about?”
Pansy snorts and Draco throws a pillow at her. “I’ll have you know, I was brilliant.”
Robertson fixes the cabbage with a serious look. “I believe I am. Now, if you’ll excuse me. Solemn introspection on vast philosophical ideals is best processed in private.”
Bewildered but obedient, the foot releases him.
On his way back to the fireplace he finds a note taped to the top of the hearth, written in a hurry.
“But I need to know if he’s alright!” Harry shouts from the doorway to Amber’s office.
,” Draco had whispered when Harry crawled into his arms after a ten-year-old had died, his limp heart in Harry’s hands.
As his feet clack against the industrial tile, it occurs to Harry that he may be slipping back into dangerous patterns. The rationale for discovering what Malfoy is up to is much thinner at twenty-three than it was at sixteen. But Harry’s feet have carried him to the correct wing of the hospital and it would be a waste to stop now.
“What?” The gravity of all that’s happened pulls the syllable loose.
Harry thinks, but the circles don’t stop and Harry holds onto the feeling of someone touching him in kindness.
—“Absolute nutter!—”
“You’re unbelievable.” Pansy strides into the flat, four-inch heels clacking on the hardwood. “Both of you.”
“Merlin, Potter, are you trying to rough me up or help me?” Draco says, knows that that easy blush will light up Potter’s skin.
Her slim shoulders, straight-backed and resilient as the Wizengamot looked down from on high. The blonde hair swaddled in blood and the blue lips—and Harry loses his grip. The war was over and no one else was supposed to die. He’d saved them, he’d tried to save them, and the story still ended with bodies and hate written in blood.
“Excuse me?” Draco’s face is flushed.
“We’re not sixteen anymore,” Hermione adds sagely, and Harry can’t help but agree.
“In every universe,” Draco says, teeth biting down on Harry’s bottom lip and sucking it into his mouth.
“Are you fucking serious!”
Harry knew what that meant.
was defined under subsection e. of the list of appropriate activities for rehabilitative interventions and so Draco’s form outlining the hours and duties was approved without further scrutiny.
“But…why?”
Draco’s door.
Harry snorts—actually snorts—and collapses into the chair across from Draco’s desk.
, Harry thinks absently. But they’re both close enough to Malfoy now that Harry’s name must have slipped through the open door. Or maybe they had always been so caught up in each other’s gravity that Harry’s proximity was enough.
Harry sees something in his own face, a little greyer, a little harder, but stilll there. And then hears it in words that are as unlikely as they are inevitable. “I love you,” this other Harry says, and takes Draco to his bed.
But no Draco. None of it explains why Harry is here and Draco is gone.
“There was an attack,” someone behind Draco says. “A group of extremists. We’ve been following their movements for months.”
“There were sixty-one of them!” Harry manages a soft roar this time, the indignity of it all.
He pawed at her broken limbs, barely touching, not sure what his hands were supposed to be doing. Her thin lips were blue.
“What are you on about?”
The sound of metal cracking into brick almost sent Harry spiralling again.
The problem was, Harry had known he was broken. But it wasn’t in a way that could be fixed—not even by someone as clever as Hermione. The parts of him that should be alive—the insides, where he was supposed to feel all of those vibrant things that had been there before he’d wandered into that forest—were dead. They were dead and they weren’t coming back.
“But—” Harry can’t seem to line his words up. “But that’s gotta be dangerous! Like, time turners are usually bad enough. This is the whole universe! That’s gotta be worse.”
. The cab was far too small. Draco could feel the heat of his thighs where they’re pressed to the ancient leather. Warm air wheezed through the vents and Draco was far too hot.
Harry has nothing left and so lets the words fall away. He drifts into sleep with Draco Malfoy wrapped around him and for that tiny slice of his life, and for the first time in forever, everything is alright.
him, Harry realizes, as he inches forward and leans in close. An older version of himself, all muscle and hard weather. “Don’t you fucking dare.” Dream Harry pulls the broken pieces of Draco into his arms and carries him inside, slamming the door hard enough to shake the hinges.
Before regret can start to sour, Draco’s texted back.
“Oh,” Pansy and Hermione say in unison, their mouths one long syllable.
It’s 2003, but Harry can’t help but feel like he’s back in 1998. Harry hadn’t asked for much—just that Draco stay this time. Of course, when has anything they've done ever gone to plan?
Harry thumbs at his keyboard, blinking furiously as the numbers swim in and out of focus. “I hate texting,” Harry says and the automatic doors slide open in answer.
Harry wonders for the thousandth time since Draco Malfoy had reappeared in his life.
The words reverberate through what’s left of him, strumming strong and deep.
The weight is friendly as he grips it in the pocket of his robes. Ten inches, hawthorn, a unicorn hair at the centre. As he casts the tracking spell, Draco feels his magic come home.
later. For now, what do we do with this?”
“Definitely not.”
Malfoy stands at the centre of everyone’s attention and does not flinch. Megan’s not looking at him.
“No, Draco. I’ve inquired about all alternative options,” Narcissa said. “I know how distasteful wizarding society finds our family. I would have avoided this were it possible.”
“I know it’s not,” Draco says, peeling the label of his cooler.
“I thought it was entrepreneurial, but I see your point. After this miraculous virgin birth, enter Jesus. Who grows up, performs miracles and, I think he threw some gamblers out of a church? But I’m definitely playing fast a loose with the source material. Robertson would know.”
The sky has started to spit, messy drops of rain turning the pavement dark, when he finally sees him. Draco would never mistake those shoulders, that shock of dark hair. There’s a bridge up ahead; Harry’s heading straight for it and Draco follows.
“You were lonely,” Hermione said, kissing him on the cheek. She came for lunch twice a week. Always had since the war. Harry depended on it. “You needed someone to take care of.”
“The party,” Harry says, but Draco looks no less baffled.
“I was at the market!” he bellows, a stray orange dropping from the paper bag with a pathetic thump.
“What is this place?” Ron asks, when Harry pushes through the heavy front door and in from the December frost.
The smell of sweat had hit him as they stepped in from the cold. It’d been loud; Draco could feel his eardrums vibrating.
“It was like my ears popped,” Draco says, looking up at Pansy, who is hanging on his every word. “Like when you’re flying and you drop too fast, and your ears pop and you can suddenly hear and you had no idea you couldn’t until that very moment. It was like that, but with my whole body.”
Pansy was right about the direction of Draco’s thoughts—which were Potter, always Potter—but she was wrong about the depth, of how deeply Harry Potter cut into him. More permanent than the Sectumsempra scars he wore on his chest. The spell was going to kill him, but he would go willingly if it meant he could have Potter.
“Fuck.”
Harry is standing on the edge of the road, skin slick and dusty, with that same solitary hole in the toe of his trainers. Draco wants to shake him, because even when presented with an infinite number of clothing options, Potter still insists on scruffy disaster. His jeans are worn and his shirt is loose in the breeze and Draco barely registers any of that because his face—
Draco’s hand drops. “You should shower it off. C’mon.”
“It’s okay if you don’t—I mean, I figured it was a long shot, look at you—” And Draco was going to die.
“What’s the point of going home?” Draco’s been skittering from universe to universe, a rock skipping on a smooth lake, jumping and jumping and never sinking.
“He’ll be back,” Harry says to one of the larger plants, retreating to the bedroom and crawling back under the covers.
“Of course,” Amber says, but her eyes glaze over again. “Who did you say you were looking for?”
“Well, yes. All good ideas come from me. But still,” Pansy shivers, and while it could’ve been the cold October wind, Harry knows it isn’t.
“I don’t bite.”

“Musical adjustments?” Draco says, looking at the shot glasses sitting between himself and Pansy.
“Potter was tricked. Everyone knows—”
“Lilly Potter was
“Hey!” Harry says, hoping that he’s not too late and that one of his best friends will still be awake.
“That barely counted as cocoa,” Harry says, some of the anger seeping out of him.
“Draco!” Pansy’s voice is watery and unguarded in its relief.
“No,” Draco whispered, and the wind picked up the word and whisked it away.
“I don’t want to need you,” Draco says, as he settles into the sheets, and Harry’s transported back in time, in the middle of the Wizengamot and beneath the glare of a thousand angry faces. “But here we are.”
Potter flinches. He looks…sad. But he doesn’t say anything.
“Hi Harry the resident,” the blonde girl says, giggling. Harry giggles too, basking in the anonymity like he’s sunbathing on a beach. It’s intoxicating.
“But nothing! This is so stupid.” Harry yanked the magazine out of Hermione’s hands and tore it in half. Let the glossy paper fall onto the checkered tile. “So stupid,” he said again, softer this time.
“Why else would you stick around, waiting for me to find—” The words are brittle. “To see—” So brittle that they crack.
,” he insisted, when Draco had wept himself dry after a jeweller had gone to the Witch Weekly about a ring he’d purchased. “
For three consecutive days, Draco had wandered into Robertson's and purchased a truly obscene number of Muggle classics.
“Doesn’t it?” Draco choked.
Harry nods and turns to leave.
“I told you, years ago. I’d been having dreams—”
The tears sting; it’s the only reason he knows they’re there. “This is the only world where he can’t love me,” Draco gasps. “He can’t. I’m so awful that he can’t.”
“Fuck!”
“Draco Malfoy?” The voice calls, louder this time.
“I can’t convince you to do anything. That’s always gonna be on you.”
“Right. The curse I cast may or may not open up the…uh…the multi-verse? Plunging me headlong into different various worlds, wherein I live as myself until the curse decides it’s done with me and sends me home again. It’s no big deal.”
“Diagnostic spell,” he said, blinking too quickly. Harry flicked his wand and cast, not needing the words to channel the magic; it was keen to obey.
“You were up to something!” Harry’s anger is an open flame; he hasn’t felt this much of anything in months. “And I didn’t stalk!”
The possibilities, the depth of his potential, is bittersweet .
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice clatters, soft ice cubes in a glass. “You don’t have to rationalize what—who you want. You can have it. You can just have it.”
“You know, you could call me Harry,” Harry says. The railing is digging into his spine.
He’d been fine, really. Completely fine. Until—
” All of Draco’s long lines shiver. “See!” Harry says, triumphant. “It’s weird.”
The cracked tile of Grimmauld sags around him, mould creeping in the caulking, faucet sniffling into the sink. Harry’s not sure why he thought that his kitchen would feel less empty. Grimmauld has never warmed to him, as if the transfer of ownership resisted, refused to take.
“I mean, chasing Malfoy has always been this...” Hermione takes a deep breath, arranging her words with care before saying, “this existential goal of yours. He goes and you follow. What are you going to do now that you’ve finally caught up?”
“Possible,” Pansy says, her voice stretching thin like the rest of her. “Possible.”
Exhaustion wraps around Harry like a lover. It knows him, stays with him after the sixteen-hour overnight, holds him close as he does his rounds and scratches away at his documentation. The light filtering through the curtains of Grimmauld is bleary and overcast. Harry narrows his eyes at the sharp lines of his digital alarm clock. 3:13pm. Great. He’s woken up before his alarm.
“I’m leaving, Potter,” was what Draco had finally said, because it was the truth for every version of his question. “And I’m never coming back.”
Harry’s willpower nearly dissolves into giggles at the thought, and so he looks up and tries to focus on anything else. Draco’s desk is made of cheap particle board. The computer looks geriatric and is making strange whirring noises. There’s a small window, with several colourful cactuses on the sill.
It’s never happened again—not since he’d stood on the edge of a field of yellow and Harry had come for him, but Draco’s sure that she’s been back. Sure that he’s felt the cool fingers on his forehead, the touch tender as his mother’s, sure that he’s heard the soft whisper as he drifts into sleep.
“—What’s a Hobbit?—"
“It—” Draco is still stunned. “It was direct?”
“We were supposed to live,” he says. He’s inside out. The tender parts screaming, the pretences shoved away.
“Hello Viola—”
All of Daniel’s features are twisted in confusion, but he gives Draco a little wave and turns to face Robertson, who is still holding his cabbage.
They were gone before the stands could empty. Before he could find Potter and do…he’s honestly not sure.

“You fucking lied to me. You’re such a fucking liar.”
Draco thinks, certain in a way that has started to feel natural to him.
“He seemed nice—”
“Draco?” Robertson says, emerging from some hidden corner of the shop, light on his feet as he approaches Draco’s exertion. “Are you abusing my register?”
“It was actually meant to reveal the true nature of my soul, Pans. Do keep up,” Draco says, congested in that weepy sort of way.
“The war is over,” she says. “And this is a pathetic display of violence that you will probably pretend was justice. But at the end of the day, you are really just a mob of angry people attacking an unarmed man.”
He had. Merlin, he had, and he desperately needed to talk to Pansy about it.
, Harry thinks as he sits in Draco’s horrible spiny chair and chases the smell of him.
“What about the solicitor? Couldn’t he do it on your behalf?”
. This was the earliest time stamp and he picks up the vial and peers through the clear liquid. As he stares at the faded ink, Harry realizes that he knows this date. It was the day of Malfoy’s trial.
“I should’ve brought it back ages ago,” Harry said, shame deepening the blush on his snow-scrubbed cheeks.
“We’ll go to Malfoy Manner,” Pansy says. “Draco gave me access to the wards after—” she trails off. “I can get us in.”
“No,” Harry chokes, really chokes, because he can’t breathe. “Oh no.” Vials and dirt and air. Harry doesn’t know how he gets to the floor, but his hands are pushing soil around, trying to scoop the plant back into the pot.
, Draco thinks. “Wait,” he says, just as not-Potter reaches the door. “It’s really fine.”
“Excuse me?” Draco does not think he’s ever been more confused, and Robertson is a very confusing person.
After a moment, and with very clear sinuses, Harry says, “I think we were actually good. For about a day, and then he went and fucked it—”
“Hey.” Harry’s voice cracks on the way out and he realizes his words, ever the blunt objects, aren’t enough. Slowly, as their friends fuss above them, Harry lowers the hand that’s buried up the back of Draco’s shirt and twines their fingers together. Holds on and squeezes tight.

“Get off him,” Harry says, his rage on a leash. For now.
“I’m going to die,” Draco said, out loud again because he’s an idiot. But he was trapped in the cramped cab of a fucking pickup truck with The Boy Who Lived and what else was he supposed to say?
“She was talking to the wall with her ass cheeks hanging out when I got here,” Megan says, nibbling at the paper rim of her coffee cup. “We get all sorts, don’t we?”
“You’re so earnest. Always have been,” Draco says, fixing him with that look. It’s not gentle or kind. It won’t let him go.
“I found an old spell in one of great great uncle Cassius’s journals. It’s a family spell, I think, but it wasn’t copied into any of our official ledgers.”
particular way...
Draco has had some strange entrances into other universes—he once nearly bled out on Harry Potter’s doorstep. It was always a little disorienting at first, but Draco’s improved at finding his bearings. He’s proud of his new ability to react on the spot.
“So.” Draco looks at Harry and smiles. It’s devastating. “
“I’d kill for a glimpse at the stars above Alaska right now,” Draco says to the street.
. You won't regret it.
Harry taps his fingers together, finger to thumb, finger to thumb, and forces the anxious magic back down.
Draco approaches the contraption and digs his fingernails into the drawer. “You will open,” he says through gritted teeth, “because I say that you will, and that’s” he yanks and strains, “final!” He lifts one leg up to the counter for leverage and pulls and pulls and—
“Your turn,” the man said.
“What is?” said Harry.
It hadn’t been what he’d meant, when he’d asked to hang out. A dozen invitations had died as drafts, never to be sent to their destination. Harry’s two days off had passed, and he’d not found the courage. Here, as the day ebbs away the midnight sky blinks down at him, Harry finally asks for what he needs.
There are a thousand words crowding in Draco’s throat, countless replies and yet they all feel inadequate. So Draco says nothing. He hopes the silence is a gift rather than a cruelty.
Potter is not at the Black House, nor is he at the ministry or the pub. The tracking magic tugs him out of Wizarding London and deeper and deeper into the Muggle world. Not for the first time, Draco is struck by how large the Muggle world is. He has lived for months with Muggles and there are still so many streets he doesn’t know, so many neighbourhoods he’s never seen and places he hasn’t heard of.
“How can you know! How can you and saint Potter be so goddamn certain that I deserve the benefit of so much doubt?”
she says.
Potter doesn’t love him. Draco is home. And his mother is dead.
Draco doesn’t know when he lost Pansy. The memories started to blur like watercolour paint as they’d tripped out of the flat and smudged their evening into Muggle London. It’s been hours—Draco can feel the time ticking in the sweat turning cold down his back, the ache in his feet from dancing to the tune of his desperation. At some point, he’d stumbled out of the club, buzzed and dizzy and craving air.
Draco breathes in the smell of the world around him and pushes the memories away. Used books and damp umbrellas. The wizarding world may not want him but “I’m here,” Draco whispers. “I’m still here.”
Slowly, in the middle of confusion and chaos, Harry sees him, and the look does not disappoint.
Harry loses himself in the moments—his leg over Draco’s shoulder, the way Draco bites his bottom lip as he moves, slow and determinedly. Harry wants to look everywhere at once but he can’t and he wants to cry because it’s all happening at once and he can’t hold on.
Bella’s purrs are a concerto of contentment. Harry buries his face in his mug and breathes in the smell of coffee.
he realizes.
The slip into his last name seems to stun Draco; Harry watches him flinch and then scramble to recover. “Harry,” he says, in the same voice he’d used last night. “I can explain.”
“Draco,” his mother says, and her hands are all over him. Long cool fingers, exploring the parts of him that hurt.
“Do you have a mobile?” Draco asks instead, and then looks desperate to snatch the question back.
“Oh, for fuck sakes,” Harry says, shredding the letter, turning on his heel, and apparating away.
that she died?” Draco asks, as they step out of the lift.
He’d tried to tell Hermione too with, somehow,
Harry’d grinned, lips stretching. He’d been hungry, so hungry, and all he wanted was Draco. Without preamble, Harry swallowed him all the way down.
“Honestly, yes,” Hermione says. “Maybe the smartest in our year after…”
“I know,” Draco says, his lips moving against Harry’s ear.
“He’s changed,” Harry says.
“You needed it,” says Robertson, shifting away from the windowsill he’d been perusing and leading Harry towards another towering mess of books. “Now, let’s find you some reading materials to assist in your efforts.”
They stayed until the gaming café closed, dizzy with vodka coolers and drunk on a good mood. Pansy flirted shamelessly, and Draco was sure he would die at the hands of a brutish looking man, who reminded him forcibly of Goyle.
“I’d stop being the broken half of a prophesy that’ll never come true—”
“Don’t wanna be, ALL BY MYSELF!” Draco belts the chorus out into his empty flat, but it’s not enough.
“Okay,” Hermione said slowly. “It would take something fairly dramatic to keep the Malfoys out of prison. Lucius was already sentenced—”
,” Draco had said, even though he agreed.
, Pansy had said.
But most of Harry’s mind isn’t thinking at all. His thoughts are blank, a pure white haze, like tinnitus after an explosion. The aftershocks curl, ashes falling from the sky, and Harry just stands until his toes feel like ice cubes, eyes drifting in and out of focus.
