Ginny sighs, pulling on her sweater, “alright then,” she says finally agreeing to drop it, “I won’t pester you then,” she says looking back at Harry, “Luna and I are getting engaged,” she says softly.
Blaise does as he’s told, reminding himself to let loose. Draco smiles, tipping his head back slightly, “blonde?” he asks.
This shocked Harry, he felt like someone had just poured a bucket of ice water over his head, his body went rigid, “You were hooking up with Oliver,” he says trying to keep his voice even.
“You become weaker every day,” Draco says, “After one day you become hypersensitive to stimuli, you lose the ability to retract your fangs, your sense of smell increases, your pupils dilate, and you get what they call ‘hunter eyes,’”
“Sorry Professor McGonagall,” Draco says, glancing over at her for a brief moment before he turns around walking off in the direction of the library.
When Draco put it that way, Blaise could say that he might lower his standards for that, “fine,” he says, before taking Draco’s hand, spinning him around.
Harry looks up at Draco, losing his grip, but not letting him go, “Sometimes people just need hugs, and you don’t always have to ask for one.”
Draco watches her for another moment, “I am not a vampire,” he insists, but he also noticed the way that horrible metallic taste in his mouth seems to lessen as he watches the blood drain, and rather quickly from the blood bag.
Harry smiles, “Okay,” he says, leaving it at that, “well enjoy your meal,” Harry says, and then, “Oh that is weird.” And Draco laughs.
“So, just because you’re a vampire doesn’t mean you’re not normal,” Harry says, “It just means that your normal has changed, I don’t think you’ve done anything abnormal for a vampire, because that’s what you are now, a vampire, but that certainly doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you,” Harry says looking at Draco, “You’re still Draco, who you are as a person hasn’t changed.”
Draco shakes his head, “Tired,” he says, looking down at his watch, it was nearing five am, “I want to go to bed.”
“You know who I am,” Draco says regaining control over his emotions, “You’ve known who I was since we were eleven, yes I’ve grown since then, and so have you,” he continues, “my opinions have changed, and so have yours, I realized I was gay, I became a vampire against my will, I’ve had some terrible dates, some drunken hookups I’d rather not speak of,” Draco says looking back at Harry, “but I don’t need a babysitter, I don’t need a boyfriend, especially one who wants me to be something I’m not.”
Harry walks over, gently placing his hand on his lover’s waist, and is immediately lost in the gorgeous silver eyes.
Sitting here at his table eating this icy sorbet Zella had made specially for him, Draco Malfoy was in absolute heaven. He never wanted this to end.
Draco sighs dramatically, standing in his closet staring at his clothes, “I’m getting dressed,” Draco says, annoyance clear in his voice.
“Draco Malfoy,” he says forcing himself to tear his eyes away from her body and look at her face. She had high cheekbones, and she wore red blush and had dark eyeliner on, and her eyes, they were piercing blue, and Draco wanted to taste her lips that were bright red and had just a bit of sparkle. The way she smiled had Draco’s heartbeat increasing.
Draco looks over his shoulder, looking at Blaise who was now snogging Mandy, “No, he’s definitely not my boyfriend,” he says.
“It’s alright,” Harry says quickly, “I can’t imagine what you must be feeling,” he mutters, “I was the one who interrupted your morning.”
“Sorry,” Harry says again, “it’s just after everything last year,” he says shaking his head, “sometimes- “
Harry looks at Draco for a long moment, letting the air settle between them, “What is normal?” Harry asks.
“I know it’s not the highlight of your life or anything, and I’m so sorry it’s happened to you, but I think that becoming a vampire has changed you, and changed the way you see the world, and I like that part of you,” Harry says looking back at Draco.
Harry can’t help himself, he seems mesmerized by blood that stain’s Draco’s lips red and drips slowly down the side of his chin. Draco’s middle finger wipes at the blood that seemed to escape his mouth. Harry lets his eyes wander back to Draco’s lips, it’s only at that moment when he sees Draco’s lips begin to move, that he realizes Draco’s talking again.
Blaise sips on a firewhiskey, watching Imogen talk to a very pretty blonde witch, in a very short red dress.
“You gonna let her get all that attention?” Draco teases, “I’d be a little jealous if my boyfriend was getting looks like that.”
His left cheek was still bruised but just barely, he looks at his shirtless torso, the bruises on his body were almost gone, it made him happy to finally see his body start to look like himself again. Draco looks at himself in the mirror, he can feel the tingling in his mouth as he opens his mouth slightly to see his fangs. From what Draco knew about vampires, they could control whether they wanted to show or hide their fangs, and the fact that his fangs had been on pure instinct for him since he was turned, he started to wonder if this meant he was gaining control over his vampire senses. There was only one way to find out.
Draco turns around opening the cabinet, taking out one of the extra toothbrushes, he meets Harry’s eyes, in the mirror, “Thank you.”
Draco looks curiously at Harry for a moment before he crawls up onto the bed, sitting on his knees, and facing away from Harry.
“I-I” Harry stammers, “That’s not what I meant Malfoy,” he says, “sorry, I didn’t mean it to come out like that,” he sighs, “I just didn’t realize there were other guys here,” he says stopping himself, “I’m sorry.”
Draco watches the other vampires feed for another moment, before he nods, “alright,” he agrees, “I’ll give it a try.”
“What do you want me to say?” Draco snaps, startling Harry, “Do you want me to say that I feel fucking isolated being a vampire, an outcast of a Wizard, that I have no one, that I can’t stand the presence of most of my friends for an extended period of time?” he snaps, “But that I watch you spend hours, days even, fucking days with your friends, and you never seem unhappy around them,” Draco says glaring back at Harry, “Do you want me to say that I only ever feel that way when I’m around you, that you’re the only person I can stand to be around for extended periods of time, and not complain?”
Harry was put off by this question, this was his job he wasn’t going to stop doing his job just because he had personal issues with the victim, “Well it happened in my district, while I was on duty, therefore it’s my case.”
“The last thing I want is to live in a tiny one bedroom flat, with horrible neighbors, with noisy children and barking animals,” Draco says rolling his eyes.
Harry watches Luna for a long moment before he reaches over, giving her a hug, “congratulations,” he says, “I’m really happy for you and Luna,” he says, starting to wonder if he could ever have that with Draco, then he tosses the thought from his head, this was not the time for that, “and I swear I won’t say anything to anyone,” he says forcing a smile as he releases her.
“They’re hardly worth my time,” Astoria says, and Draco can’t say he blamed her, he was honestly thinking about giving up dating altogether, though he might change his mind for one wizard, but he knew how likely that was, and he wasn’t going to hold his fucking breath.
Harry eats a piece of fruit from his plate, looking over at Draco through his eyelashes. Draco can see Harry watching him, but he doesn’t say anything, he was going to make Harry ask him.
Harry can’t help but smile, “You’re not an asshole,” Harry murmurs, “you have one of the biggest hearts I’ve ever seen, and you’ve changed so much it actually amazes me, I see so much more to you than that person you were,” Harry says.
Draco nods, “yes,” he says softly, looking down at Harry, his core buzzing with desire, as Harry slides the zipper of his trousers down. Draco bites his lower lip to stop himself from whining in desperation.
Draco groans softly, against Harry’s skin, he can hear his heart beating loud in his ear as his heart rate increases. Draco can feel Harry’s muscles, squeeze around his cock, and Draco is sure he won’t be able to last very long. He watches Harry’s cock twitch between their bodies, dripping with precome, and Draco brings his hand between them, beginning to stroke Harry’s cock, rubbing the sticky fluid over the head of his cock causing Harry to cry out in pure ecstasy.
Draco was lucky enough to own the ground floor unit, he had a large chef’s kitchen, a moderately sized study, grand master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, bathtub large enough to fit four, walk-in shower where Draco could see himself spending hours of his day, two large walk-in closets, and two separate sitting areas. The penthouse also had a smaller princess suite, and one guest bedroom, and off of the main living area, a large guest bathroom. Each penthouse came with their very own house-elf, and Draco had never felt more at home.
Draco watches Harry, his mouth going dry as he tries not to roll his hips in desperation. Draco doesn’t speak, he’s not sure he could say anything.
Harry shrugs, “I want it to be more than just what it is now, but there is still so much we have to work through before we can get to that point, and I just don’t want to spoil anything,” he says.
Draco lowers his pants, stepping out of them on the floor, and blonde hair is Harry’s first thought, beautiful blonde hair, that sat below Draco’s hip but absolutely nothing was going to distract Harry from what he truly wanted.
It’s before sunset when Harry arrives at Draco’s fireplace, “Draco,” he calls out, wondering if he was even awake yet.
“Punishment,” Draco says, “a vampire who is caught hurting someone on purpose, will be defanged and when a fang is pulled out, it takes a hundred years for it to grow back,” he says.
Draco thinks for a moment, sitting on the arm of the sofa, “I don’t have anything else planned, so I guess that’d be alright.
“Thanks,” Draco says watching Harry, “Oh, and Potter,” he says, and Harry meets his eyes, “I think you’re quite fit yourself.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “C’mon, I want to see that film about the witch and the kneazle that scares off all her dates,”
Because Harry was different. Even through all of his anger Draco knew Harry was different, and that only made him angrier.
Harry smiles, thinking that he may have tormented Draco enough for the moment, “Okay,” he says, leaning over, kissing Draco’s cheek.
Draco notices what Harry was doing, and can’t help but laugh, “If you think you’re going to get me on that sofa, you’ve got another thing coming,” he says, “I need proper back support for what I plan on doing with you,” he smirks.
Harry can completely believe that’s how Draco would pick a guy to date. If a guy had the bollocks to stand up to Draco Malfoy, then Draco would at least give him the time of day. Draco enjoyed that guys seemed to be afraid to talk to him, and he had respect for those who had enough courage to challenge him.
This makes Draco angry, “This isn’t a joke, and it’s not funny,” he snarls, “I broke up with Astoria because I’m gay, I was planning on coming out that night, and needed to tell her first, that’s why we were alone that night.”
Draco looks in the mirror for another minute before he wanders back to his bedroom, putting on some clothes.
Harry looks at Draco, he was starting to feel sorry for him again, “They’re not erased, they’re just taking time to come back to you, you remembered about Oliver, and Astoria, that’s a start.”
Blaise ignores Draco and shoves the shoes at him. Draco sighs, sitting down to put on the boots. And damn it if he didn’t look great. Looking in the mirror Draco stood there looking at himself, and damn if he didn’t want to fuck himself. He would definitely get himself laid tonight.
“Whatever,” Draco says again, pouring his blood into a mug, before he frowns, “Zella,” he calls, “I have no idea what I’m doing, can you warm this for me?” he asks when she appears.
Draco checks himself into a hotel that night, figuring he would sort out where he was going to stay the following night. He still wasn’t used to this whole night time schedule yet. When Draco gets into his hotel room the first thing he does is empty his shoulder bag, taking out three pouches of blood, laying them on the desk in the room. Draco decided to grab a glass this time, that had gone over well earlier when he had his first bag.
Draco smiles, “Blaise, isn’t my boyfriend,” he says, looking over his shoulder at Blaise, “he’s single.”
Toby nods, leaning in kissing Draco once more, pulling Draco’s leg over his lap. Draco leans into Toby, kissing him faster, letting Toby’s hands rest on his waist, and find a tiny bit of exposed skin at his hips.
While getting ready to come to this event, his lover said something Harry had never expected, and as much as Harry had thought about it before, he never actually thought the idea would come to life, and never in such a public setting. Harry was thoroughly enjoying their little game, but it was making it extremely hard for him to focus on talking to any Ministry officials.
“Unless it’s human-borne, there’s no risk so long as the bite has healed,” Draco says, “feeders at blood banks, and through ordering services, are tested twice a month for these diseases and pathogens.”
“He is my date for this evening,” Draco confirms, “I don’t know if I would go as far as to say we’re dating.”
“Is this okay?” Draco pauses to ask, trying to wrack his brain for even a scrap of the control he so desperately needed to have.
Camilla had red hair that fell almost to her waist, her hair is straight, and it falls over her shoulders, she’s wearing a blue dress that sparkled in the light, it fell all the way to the floor, but it had a slit up the side of the dress all the way to her mid-thigh. She also had on a pair of white high heels, and she had Draco questioning his sexuality.
“So, you’ll have more control if I’m closer to you,” she says, “It makes it easier for new vampires if you’re sitting in their lap, and it allows you to feel other pulse points.”
This snaps Draco out of his thoughts, as he turns to Neil, a look of curiosity on his face. Neil raises an eyebrow, and gestures to his left, when Draco looks over Neil’s shoulder, he saw a blonde woman, sinking her fangs into a very handsome wizard’s neck, and his jaw drops slightly, as he realizes he’s surrounded by vampires feeding.
Draco smirks slightly, “So what did your date dress as?” he asks, wondering what crazy costume idea Luna had come up with.
“I don’t care about our family name!” Narcissa says that wasn’t true though, she cared very much about the way people saw her. She came from wizarding royalty, and there was a certain level of prestige she was expected to have, and that did not include a vampire for a son.
Meghan laughs again, “Yeah, I needed a dance break,” she says looking back at Draco, “Do you have anyone to drink?” she asks curiously.
Harry’s jaw drops, “What is it?” he asks, licking his lips slightly, finding his mouth suddenly as dry as the Sahara Desert.
“What I see is a complete git,” Draco says, and Harry rolls his eyes, “why are you even trying to be nice to me? We’re not friends, we’re too different.”
“Hey,” he says softly, “It’s alright,” he says quietly trying to coax Draco back to him, “It’s okay Malfoy.”
It takes every ounce of self-control Harry Potter possessed not to rip all the clothes off his boyfriend right then and there.  Draco was not only wearing a black lace bra, but he was wearing a matching black lace thong. This undergarment had little bits of lace around the waist, which next to Draco’s fair skin, made the color pop. Harry imagined a similar piece of lace was sat between Draco’s pert cheeks; he did have every intention of finding out if this was the case.
Draco walks into the library looking around for an empty table, and he rolls his eyes because of course, everyone had decided that now was a good time to study. He walks between a row of books, and he sees Harry Potter sitting at a table by himself, and his first thought is to roll his eyes, but he doesn’t. Draco remembers what happened last year, and walks over to one of the empty seats, “Mind if I sit here Potter?” he asks pulling out the seat across from Harry, sitting down before Harry’s answer.
Harry pulls up a chair and sits down, “I’m not going anywhere until we’ve figured out who did this to you,” he says.
Draco narrows his eyes, he knew that voice, “Potter?” he asks slightly shocked, “The hell are you doing here?”
“I don’t want to continue seeing you under any capacity, goodnight and have a great life, without me in it.”
“Learn to follow directions Mister Malfoy,” she says simply, “we’re going to run a series of tests now, and then you can go back to sleep.”
Harry nods, “yeah, it’s not one of my prouder moments,” he says, “I was very drunk, but I remember he tasted like cinnamon.”
After a moment Draco brings the blood bag back to his mouth starting to suck again, this time trying to be more controlled with his drinking. With no success, blood filled his mouth too quickly and spilled over the sides of his mouth again. Draco swallows quickly, panting slightly as he tries to regain control over himself. Draco can feel the fangs in his mouth beginning to tingle, he decides to finish off the bag completely. This time he wasn’t going to stop, he was making too much of a mess.
Harry lets out a soft whimper, as Draco’s arms wrap around his waist, “Draco,” Harry murmurs as he moves his hips slightly, hyper-aware of every inch of Draco’s cock pressing against the inside of his body, and that thought, is enough to bring Harry to his climax.
“Because,” she snaps back at him, “you honestly thought that you being anything but straight would make us love you any less,” she says harshly, “Harry,” she says regaining control over her voice, “if anyone deserves to be happy, it’s you, and if you’ve found someone who makes you happy, whether that person is a girl or a boy, it doesn’t change the way we see you,” Hermione says softly.
Draco glances down, he could see the vein in her wrist, and he could hear her pulse from where he was standing, he traced her vein all the way through her arm, and he watches her pulse in her neck for a moment, and he did want to taste her.
“We have reason to believe that you may have gone there after leaving the pub,” he says looking at Draco.
When Hermione and Ginny leave, Harry has this heavy feeling in his chest, he sort of just wants to go back to bed, and stay forever, but he knows if he doesn’t go and see Draco tonight, he’ll never know if he can truly be with him.
Harry’s eyes slip shut, as Draco’s lips meet his, Harry melts into the kiss, Draco’s lips are soft, and gentle against Harry’s. Draco’s tongue slips past Harry’s lips, and Harry moans softly, as Draco kisses him. Draco pulls back a moment later, letting their lips linger, just out of reach of the other’s, for just one silent moment.
Draco scoffs, “fine then,” he says, sitting down on the plush ottoman, waiting for Blaise to bring him clothes.
Draco doesn’t bother cleaning himself up, he decided he’d take a shower, and just wash it off in there. Draco walks into the ensuite turning the light on, walking to the walk-in shower, turning it on. It’s this moment that Draco really sees himself. He’d been avoiding mirrors since he got out of the hospital, but he didn’t want to avoid the mirror anymore.  Draco stands in front of the mirror, he had two black eyes, his cheeks were sunken, and bruised, the bruises yellowing on his pale skin.
Draco reaches out, grasping Harry’s bicep, making him stay and talk to him. Draco can’t help but notice the defined muscle under his fingertips, that he never remembers seeing before.
Draco loses his entire sense of what little control he had when he came in here, and his fingers leave Harry, and he’s pulling Harry’s hips down, pushing his legs further apart on either side of his thighs as he lines himself up.
“Thank you, Zella,” he says when she sets the warm mug in front of Draco, followed by a tray of sandwiches.
Harry looks back at Draco trying to figure out what he was talking about, “What does that mean?” Harry asks, “Why did you break up with Astoria? And why would it make you leave with Oliver, someone you barely know?” he asks.
Draco was beyond frustrated as he watches Anthony step into the Floo. He wanted to scream, and a tiny part of him was sad, but he had to bury that under his anger for now. Draco changes out of his costume, and into his pajamas, and he wants to go straight to bed when he hears the fireplace in the other room.
“It can attach to both human and vampire cells, the human is simply the carrier, the disease is not active in a human body, only when the dormant pathogen comes into contact with vampiric cells through the fangs, does the illness present in the vampire,” Draco says.
The corner of Harry’s mouth twitches, “I think it’s harder because I still don’t know what I am” he says quietly.
Draco gets up on Saturday evening, wandering into his bathroom to take a shower. Draco takes a quick shower, only half an hour. When Draco steps out of the shower, he stands in front of the mirror for a moment, the bruises on his face were mostly gone, for which he was glad, and the bruises on his body were slowly fading away. Draco gasps, as the audible click sounds in his ears, and his fangs appear. Draco was aware of how thirsty he was in that moment. He doesn’t move just yet instead, he takes this moment to inspect his fangs for the first time. He had four, he hadn’t expected to see four long fangs. Draco gently touches his bottom left fang and accidentally pierces his finger.
“I don’t remember,” Draco says looking over at Harry, he can’t help but notice the way Harry’s heartbeat seems to grow louder in his ear, he watches Harry shift in the chair, but all Draco can focus on is the vein in Harry’s neck, he can hear the flow of liquid as it runs through his veins, and the next thing Draco knows, he has a pair of long sharp fangs, protruding from his mouth, with a very audible click.
“Well I’m glad I don’t have to deal with that,” Draco says, stepping out of the closet a minute later, fully dressed.
“Oh, I spend hours in front of the mirror daily,” Draco says, “So I know, I have cheekbones to kill, but why do you think I’m attractive, I’m not even your type.”
Harry leans over closing the space between them, pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s. Draco gasps, he hadn’t expected this. Draco had wanted this, Harry’s soft warm lips against his kissing him, in his fantasy there was quite a bit of tongue, and Draco had complete control, but somehow this is better. It’s better because it’s real.
Draco walks down the hall sitting down on the sofa inside the small bedroom, where he had kept his two feeders for his vampire friends, trying not to glare angrily into his half-empty glass of mead.
“I care about you, I want you to be happy, doing things that you clearly hate, even pretending you enjoy it a tiny bit, simply because I like it, are all ways of saying, and more importantly
Kingsley blinks back at Harry, for a moment, and Harry can see him putting puzzle pieces together in his mind, “I did not realize you two were here together,” Kingsley says, as calmly as ever, “Glad to see you have interests outside the Ministry, Potter,” he says with a friendly smile before turning to Harry’s date, “Enjoy the rest of your evening, Mister Malfoy.”
Draco scoffs, “I don’t want to go there Potter,” he says, “neither of us were very good to the other, but let’s just let it stay in the past. I should be going,” he says sitting up straighter, trying his very best to hide his erection under his robes, as he stands up.
Harry dresses in his pajamas, before walking back to the common room. He sits down by the fireplace, using his wand to light the fire, before curling up on the sofa, pulling his knees close to his chest, as his mind begins to wander.
Blaise nods, “Astoria came back, she tried to hide the fact that she was upset, and she talked to Daphne and they both left together after about an hour.”
Two weeks after Draco’s birthday, and Harry was still arguing with Ginny about her not telling anyone he was dating Draco.
Harry walks into the prefect’s bathroom, he’d had three exams today, and the entire time he could only think of one thing. One thing that he was going to end up taking care of by himself, but he couldn’t think of a better way to end such a stressful day.
Draco watches Harry for a second longer before he leans down, grasping the side of Harry’s face, kissing him hard on the mouth. This Harry had not expected, he feels Draco’s thumb gently stroking his cheek before breaking the kiss, and Harry just blinks back at Draco, waiting for an explanation.
Harry gets up looking back at Ginny, “I have to go now,” he says, “but you know where to find me,” he says before disapparating away.
Harry stares at Draco, Draco had a way of bottling all of his feelings and thoughts up, and letting them all out at once, and only ever when prodded. Harry, of course, knew that Draco had sensitivities about Harry’s close friendships because Draco was sort of jealous he never had those, but Draco was wrong, he had that closeness with Harry, even if he didn’t know it, Harry knew it. Harry always hated Draco growing up, but he never truly
“Pansy Parkinson,” Harry says shocked, he hadn’t heard a single thing about Pansy Parkinson since they left school.
“Draco, please,” Harry pants, he was sure he was going to lose it at any moment, Draco’s graceful hand movements, and perfect placement of his fingers pressing against the underside of his cock, “I-I’m cl-close,” he stammers.
“Hmm,” she mumbles, crossing her legs under the table, “well that explains why you’re here on a Saturday alone,” she says.
“Luna wants to do it three months from now, so maybe then you’ll bring your mystery man with you,” she says smiling.
“Thank you,” Harry says nodding at the house-elf before she retreats. Harry helps himself to the tea, stirring in a spoonful of sugar.
“I need to drink,” Draco says so quietly it’s almost a whisper, “so why don’t you come back tomorrow if you want.”
Draco looks back at Harry, they had spoken briefly about this but had never really revisited it. Draco had been thinking a lot about this recently, especially since they were getting rather serious in their relationship. Harry practically lived with him and they had sort of agreed to further their relationship, and this was something Draco had wanted to bring up eventually.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, “I’ve only been a vampire for two months, and I’ve never added a relationship to that equation.”
Harry can feel his chest tighten as Draco speaks to him, and he can’t bring himself to say anything.
Harry looks at Draco, “Do vampires really live that long?” Harry asks, having read that the vampire in question was nearly three hundred.
Cami smiles, leaning over pressing a gentle kiss to Draco’s cheek, “Happy Birthday,” she says when Harry sits down on Draco’s other side, before getting up walking over to sit beside his friend Morgana who was a beautiful dark skinned vampire, with a head of large long dark curls on her head, she was wearing a red dress tonight, and Cami leans over giving her a gentle kiss on the lips.
“Okay,” Draco says, watching Camilla move to sit on his lap, and he instinctually lets his hand rest on her knee, as he uses his other hand to brush her long hair away from her neck.
Draco nods, “Vampires just age differently, the oldest is said to have lived to be over a thousand,” Draco says, “but most live to be somewhere around six hundred give or take a few years.”
This was something Draco had not foreseen happening during their exchange. Draco lets Harry savor his post-orgasm state of mind, and he thinks that it might be alright if he let his hand gently brush the hair back and tuck it behind Harry’s ear.
“What in the name of Merlin-“ Draco stops himself, quickly looking down at Harry who had his hands wrapped around Draco’s.
“Was important enough to bring it up,” he murmurs, deciding to let it go if Harry wasn’t going to say anything to him about it this time.
Harry finishes his breakfast setting his bowl on the table, as Ginny comes out of the kitchen, “What do you guys want?” he asks curiously.
him, he was always masking something underneath his outward interactions with Draco, which was most likely a deeply, deeply hidden attraction to something Draco had that Harry didn’t, a sense of self. Draco Malfoy knew exactly who he was, what he wanted when he wanted it, and why he wanted it. Which is why Harry
“Apparently new vampires, tend to be sloppy drinkers, so they go through a lot more than older vampires.”
“Nevermind,” Blaise says feeling like he’d rather not share, “Let’s go for butterbeers tomorrow after class,” he says, since the eighth-years were all of age, they were permitted out every weekend if they so wished, and tomorrow was Friday night.
“Draco” Harry’s voice quivers, as Draco grabs onto him keeping him from fleeing like he so desperately wanted to.
Draco turns over on his bed, “Have I overslept?” he asks sleepily, pushing himself up on the bed, letting out a long yawn.
“If I didn’t like it, I would ask you to stop doing it, but I want you to keep doing exactly what you’re doing,” Draco says.
Draco stares back at Harry, “You’re asking me to marry you, and somewhere along the way turn you into a vampire,” he says.
“I don’t know you, but I understand why you feel the way you do,” he says looking back at Draco, “I only want to help find out who did this to you and why so that you can be truly Draco Malfoy.”
Harry shrugs, “you also saved my life,” he says, “we had differences, but I don’t think any of those are relevant at this point in our lives,” Harry says looking at Draco.
Harry isn’t sure how it happens, but his instincts have him dropping to his knees, and he can’t help but stare, yes, he does stare at Draco Malfoy’s cock, he wants it. Harry’s eyes close, and he presses his nose against the skin where Draco’s thigh meets his groin and inhales his scent.
Harry nods, swallowing down the lump in his throat, “You shouldn’t be sorry for saying how you feel,” Harry says, “I’ll be fine,” he insists, “and this probably won’t be the last time one of us ends up with hurt feelings.”
“You’re always going out at nights now,” Hermione says, “what are you doing at all hours of the night?”
Harry nods, “It was maybe five when we got back here,” he says, “I gave you a glass of water, and then told you it was time for bed,” he says, “You were such a snob,” Harry laughs, “saying you needed your pajamas, but you didn’t want to wear any of mine, so you pouted and got into bed naked,” he smiles.
Harry’s breath hitches, as Draco begins to guide his cock into him, and Harry groans as he feels himself stretch around Draco.
Harry rolls his eyes, “I was thinking you might want to spend time with the person that you’re dating, but why would you want to do that,” Harry says.
Harry thinks for a moment, “It was probably a month ago, I went out with Ron and got very drunk,” he says, “I ended up hooking up with this guy in the loo.”
Harry laughs because it was funny that Ron thought Draco could be any more spoiled than he already was, “He’s my boyfriend, and it’s his birthday,” Harry says, “I’ve thrown you plenty of parties.”
“I know that you’re angry and that you have every right to be, but I also know that you’re in a state where you may do something that you’ll later regret.”
Harry leads Draco further into the lake until they’re both no longer standing but floating in the water.
Thank you all so much for sticking around and reading! It means a lot :) I hope you continue to enjoy reading this series! Thanks again so much! <3
“Well that’s not my problem,” Draco says, “I can’t survive without blood, and if you have a problem with it, then we’ll just go our separate ways right now.”
Tracey looks up at Draco, starting to dance in front of him, and Draco decides to let loose, taking Tracey’s hand and spinning her around. Tracey grins, as she dances with Draco.
Harry could understand how a vampire might get something from a human, through drinking blood but, “How can a vampire pass something to another vampire? Vampires don’t drink from each other.”
Ginny smiles, slipping on her sweater, she looked beautiful wearing a red and white sleeveless dress that stopped at her mid-thigh, and the red sweater was perfect for the dress.
Harry can say he honestly did not expect to find himself underneath Draco Malfoy tonight, not that he hadn’t thought about this many times before, but this is absolutely nothing like his fantasies, but he doesn’t have it in him to complain about that.
Harry reaches down, gently slipping his hand against Draco’s, letting his fingers lace between Draco’s, a heavy sigh leaving his chest.
Ten minutes later Draco is finally ready to go, he slips his wand into the inside of his blazer pocket, “let’s go then,” he says.
“Mister Malfoy,” the matron says entering the room, “Are you alright?” Tilly asks moving to get a closer look, “Oh dear,” she mutters.
Draco nods, “That’s how they say Luci Reinfield lived to be a thousand,” he says, “she was said to be a carrier for four human-borne vampiric diseases when she was turned by her lover in the fifth century.”
“There’s a spell for that,” Draco says with a smile, seeing the desire in Harry’s eyes as he watches him, makes this all worth it.
Just like that, Lucius changed from shouting angrily to cheering happily for his son had finally found what he had always been searching for. Love.
The spiders were still crawling around him, atop him. The crippling feeling in his skin was still there. And he knew that somewhere the Dark Potioneer he had been hunting was watching him, waiting for the poison to set in properly, to finally kill Harry Potter off.
Not until then did Harry realise he still held the blade in his hand. Without hesitation, he handed the sword to the guard before pleading tumult — yeah, actually
“Aah, yes, I can feel the power rushing through my veins!” he yelled, raising his tensed arms into the air in a victorious post.
“Yeah sure, old man, you know as well as I do that I don’t stand a chance against you in a boxing match. I had another idea in mind.” Harry took an effortless jump towards the man only to then dodge back and manuouver to the guard. Swiftly, he drew the sword from its sheath, and turned back to his opponent. “I was thinking you and I could have a little fencing match.”
I introduce: the world of the Hogwarts Eighth Year world from Ron's perspective. And a lot of thoughts.
The day had already displayed several surprises for Draco, so perhaps he shouldn’t have been that surprised when he was woken up by a small pair of hands, gently shaking him. But he was. Because it wasn’t Scorpius pale hands that shook him, and it wasn’t a question of a glass of water that brought this to happen. It was Albus Potter that stood beside his bed, and he was crying. Tears slowly streamed down his colored cheeks, and to be honest, that scared Draco a bit.
As Lucius set of with an angry rant about trusting Jafar with the role of Royal Vizier and that the cunt had paid him back by controlling him,
I clench my fist firmly around my wand – the wand that I would’ve willingly given to Harry had he been alive – and I march up the stairs, away from the dungeons. Away from his body. Away from my saviour, towards the voices of my nightmares.
“Prince Draco!” the first guard cried out. “My apologies, your highness. We did not know it was thee who were hidden beneath that hood.”
After that Granger ignores my protests and promptly heals the wounds she can, before sending me off to St. Mungo’s.
.” It causes my smirk to grow even wider. Draco only calls me that when I’m really getting on his nerves. “I will go. Soon. When things have settled down a bit.”
It’s snowing, the ground is covered with thick layers of white dust, but I don’t mind. Snow is nice. Snow covers up. It makes it a little bit easier to live through the pain. The pain. It’s hard to think of the few weeks left until Christmas, because… the pain. Who would ever have thought that Christmas, the one holiday I have always loved, would come to hurt me this much? The pain.
“Well, look who we’ve got here,” the guard smiled ruefully. “If it isn’t the infamous street rat, Harry Potter!”
“But, we’ve kinda… kept quiet about it. Don’t want it to be a big deal. Not even Ron knows. Oh, Merlin, Dray is gonna kill me when he realises I’ve told you.”
“Ten thousand years,” the man stated, his voice on the verge of being shrill. “It surely gives you a crick in your neck.” He continued before he seemed to notice the small crowd that was watching him. “Hello there, what’s your name?” he asked Harry.
Cautiously, he brought out the monkey who still was on the verge between the states of sleeping and being awake.
At last, the stairs leading up to the entrance became visible, but something about them seemed wrong. When they got closer, Harry realised why. They were falling apart. Giant holes in the sand showed them to be extremely frail and anyone who’d try to take a step on the was obviously mental.
“You know why!” Draco was quickly losing the little patience he had left. “Because you want to marry me off to some stupid princess! How many times do I have to tell you that I won’t have that either? First of all, I’m
In the beginning, I didn’t cry. I couldn’t quite comprehend that he was on the verge of dying, that he wasn’t going to suddenly sit up and hug me tightly, saying he had just taken a little nap but had missed me too much to stay asleep.
“That’s what he says as well. But I’m not gonna fight you about it. I said we should talk, so Imma talk. And you should at least wait and listen to me, even if you don’t want to talk to me.”
Abu chattered a rather long rant, to which Harry nodded along with a serious expression, until Abu got silent and he smiled a cheeky grin at the monkey.
Clawing at his skin, trying to get rid of the itching sensation, pain suddenly shot through his arm. He welcomed it. It was something that grounded him. It was something he was comfortable with. He was used to it.
“Oh, for the love of Salazar, you’re hopeless!” Draco clamours and throws his arms into the air. “Just go talk to him. Tell him. Just, cross this damn room and proclaim your undying love for the stupid weasel. Or I’m going to do it for you.”
He was back. Back where it all started, where he talked to a murderer. Back when he realised he had a connection to a madman and he was blamed for those who turned to stone. Back when he first had to wield his power to the world and it hated him for it.
should be the one to tell him. It’s my duty to provide him the truth. I will do it tomorrow, I promise.”
It was a grand display, for sure. It felt strange to have so many people staring at him without actually knowing who he was. It felt strange to look down on people. Harry wasn’t really sure if he liked it, but he reminded himself that this was for Prince Draco.
He could feel the heat from the fire get warmer and warmer, and he closed his eyes, not daring to see what was going to be his end. This was cruel. The man had given him back his hope, given him the belief that not only was he not going to die, but he was also going to get enough money to never have to worry about food again. The man had given him hope to survive and live, only to throw Harry to his death anyway.
“Come on,” Harry called out softly. “I ain’t gonna hurt you, I swear.” From behind a glorious full-length mirror, he noticed a small movement and he slowly crept closer. “It’s okay, I’m not dangerous. You can come on out.”
The moment it hit the sand, the ground started to shake and all of a sudden there was a giant tiger’s head made of sand sitting in front of it.
“Because we need to. About Draco.” I make sure that my tone is matter-of-factly, leaving no room for discussion.
“’M sorry My Lord, the Boy Who Lived tricked me. When I got down to his cell he pretended to be dead. When I went to check his pulse, he attacked me. But he was weak. I merely threw a
Then Draco whispered, “don’t you dare do that ever again, promise me,” and even though they had been fighting about Lucius and war and all the shit he had thrown in Draco’s face, they both knew Draco wasn’t referencing to that. It was about the past months, it was about his death(s).
“Perhaps it is love?” Jafar said. “Isn’t that what all the fairytales are about? How love is the most powerful weapon? Draco! Come here!” he demanded and yanked the chains so that the prince stumbled towards him. “What do you say? I could release you from your slaving duty if you only agree to love me. Marry me.”
Harry continued to whisper reassuring words until Abu had fallen asleep, and even after that he continued in the hope of also making himself believe his words. The longer time that went by, though, it got harder to believe. It was strange how much easier it was to give up hope on surviving than it was to give up hope about some day actually visiting the palace for real.
“Come here,” Harry said, leading the man to the window where they sit down on the windowsill. He points to the palace. “You see over there? The palace? That’s my dream. To live there. It must be really nice to not have to fight for a loaf of bread if you want to eat something that day. Don’t you think?”
“I’ve actually been working on an invisibility potion, and tomorrow will be time to add the Erumpent tail,” he says.
Harry isn’t quite sure he would have used that analogy but, “I know, I’m sorry,” Harry says softly, “I didn’t mean to embarrass you, and I really wish I hadn’t told Ginny we were dating,” he says.
Thanks for sticking around! I hope you continue to enjoy this series, as we grow nearer to the end :)
Blaise sees her, dark hair, dyed with highlights, and she is very pretty, “alright,” he says, eyeing her full breasts in that dress.
“Fuck off,” Draco spat, “You don’t know what I need right now. You know nothing about me, you think you know so much, but you know nothing.”
Glaring at Harry, Draco stands up from his seat, he couldn’t believe Harry had just said that, and in front of his friends, Draco couldn’t be more embarrassed if he tried.
Harry watches Draco looking for a hint of deceit, but he couldn’t find one, “you swear?” Harry asks.
Harry frowns thinking to himself, he didn’t actually know any vampires, he had no idea what to say, “I, um, I’m not sure,” Harry mutters before getting up, “I’ll get the healer.”
Harry sits on the edge of the bed, watching Draco take a drink of blood from the glass. He can’t help but notice the dribble that escapes Draco’s mouth.
“I’ve honestly never thought about it before,” Draco says, “and that may have more to do with me trying to figure my own sexuality.”
Draco looks at Harry, wondering if they really were “together”, “Somewhere our worlds overlapped,” he says.
Harry stares back at Draco, he is three hundred percent sure he misheard Draco, there was absolutely no way Draco had said what he thought he said, because Draco only ever said those words in his dreams, and Harry was pretty sure he wasn’t dreaming right now. He’s sure he’s standing in Draco’s flat, and that he’s awake and sober, and that he is one hundred percent hearing things.
Harry looks down at his lap before looking back up at Draco, “you promise you won’t need to be talked down again?” he asks.
Harry swallows and nods, he honestly keeps forgetting the fact that Draco could actually kill him if he wasn’t careful. One of them had to be aware of exactly what they were doing and considering Harry had never been fed on by a vampire, he really had no idea what he was doing, he was going to be relying on Draco.
I meant to have this up yesterday, but life sort of happened. Sorry about that guys, but I hope you enjoy this chapter anyway!
“Surprised by what?” Draco asks, “two obviously drunk blokes snogging in a club? No, I’ve seen that a hundred times.”
Draco is exceptionally quiet, and it makes Harry wonder if he’s not quite getting it right. Harry was enjoying himself more than he’d willingly admit out loud, but he wasn’t sure if Draco was, he feels Draco’s body go rigid as he reluctantly pulls back to check in with him.
Harry nods and smiles, “That’s just something you’re going to have to deal with from time to time,” he says, reaching for Draco’s hand, pressing a gentle kiss against the back of his hand.
Draco’s only response is to pull the thin sheet over his body, keeping his back turned toward his mother. He only wanted her to take care of him, but the fact that she was so horrified by what he now was, hurt him in a way he couldn’t explain or understand.
Standing in front of the mirror, Draco traces the bruises over his chest and arms, letting his fingers trail over the bruises on his stomach, and down his thighs. Draco closes his eyes a minute later, pulling his pants down, leaving them on the floor before stepping into the shower. Draco stands under the water spray, letting the water run through his hair and down his body.
Harry doesn’t mean to, but he does stare as Draco opens his textbook, looking deep into the pages. Harry watches a lock of blonde hair fall over Draco’s forehead, he wants to reach over and brush it back, putting it back in place but he doesn’t.
Draco shrugs, “Why not,” he says, letting Tracey take him out to the dancefloor, Draco hears Blaise say to Imogen, “he’s a sodding nightmare, he never knows what to wear to these things,” and Draco grins to himself.
Harry’s eyes drift upwards as he notices the portrait hole opening, he smiles seeing Ron and Ginny walking through the entrance.
“Well we could definitely get you drunk enough to make some bad decisions if that’s really what you want,” Harry says laughing, “nice little thing like you won’t have any problems finding a bloke to take you up on any offer you propose.”
“Well I just sort of asked around, Astoria said you’d seen her only about an hour ago, and I just went from there,” he says shrugging.
Draco smiles, a gentle smile back at Harry, “Kiss me,” he says, “Kiss me, right here, like you mean it.”
Draco is pretty sure he knew what Harry meant, “No, I haven’t, I don’t think I’m ready for that, I think maybe mastering the completely not alive bag might need to come first, I mean I’ve been using glasses all my life, and those are suddenly a problem, I don’t think a human,” Draco says realizing for the first time, he can’t really consider himself a human anymore, “will be any easier.”
Draco watches Harry, “thanks for the lollie,” he says, and Harry can’t help but notice the curl at the corner of Draco’s mouth, it’s definitely a smile.
Harry shakes his head, leave it up to Draco to go there, “Well, I’ll leave you then, and maybe I’ll have something else to tell you tomorrow,” he says.
Draco smiles, “girls like watching two guys together,” he says into Blaise’s ear, “and girls like guys who are comfortable in their own sexuality,” he says, placing his free hand on Blaise’s hip, pressing his body flush against Blaise’s, “now loosen up,” Draco says.
“And you are?” He asks looking her up and down, seeing Luna wearing golden jewelry all over her body, golden watches, necklaces, rings, and bracelets hanging everywhere on her.
Draco smiles, “I’ll be there in a minute,” he says signaling it was time for Harry to go back into the other room.
“We talked to Astoria yesterday, she confirmed you two had a talk, and that you left on your own, but told no one where you were going,” Harry says.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you so very much for reading this chapter, reading this series. You are amazing :) I thoroughly hope you enjoyed this chapter, as we move into the final installment of this series, which will be up next Friday. Once again, thank you so very much for sticking around, it was a fairly long chapter, a fairly long series I'm aware. The fact that you've stuck around means more to me than I can say! Thank you so very much! <3
Draco shrugs, “force of habit I suppose,” he says, “you spend five years being quiet with it, and it just sort of starts to stick.”
Harry reaches down, taking hold of Draco’s hand, moving closer to him, “You went through that transformation all on your own, with no one, for months, you just had to compartmentalize, and internalize all of that, I can’t imagine how scared you were, and completely alone,” Harry says softly, “No one deserves to go through what you went through,” he says, “and no one deserves to go through it with no support system.”
Draco wants to growl, all he wanted was to get off, but he realized that this was their first time and he needed to cut Harry some slack.
“No, it’s fine,” she insists, “You probably could have continued drinking if you needed to, I’ve learned how to slow my heart rate to allow for longer drinking periods.”
Before he could do or say anything else, Harry can feel Draco coming in his mouth. Harry whimpers softly as he pulls back slightly, so he doesn’t choke himself, sucking slightly harder as Draco’s cock twitches ever so slightly as he orgasms. Harry quickly rubs the head of his cock, his own orgasm was near.
Harry shakes his head, as he feels his chest tighten, and his abdomen contract, Harry was too far gone. “Fuck Draco,” he groans, as he comes, spilling over his hand with a forceful moan.
Harry smiles, leaning in, kissing Draco’s lips, pulling him flush against his body, “shoes,” Harry mumbles, against Draco’s lips.
On Sunday evening Draco assumes it would be safe to have a day to himself at home. Draco thinks about inviting some friends over later, a small dinner party after a relaxing today. Unfortunately for Draco, he wouldn’t be spending the day alone after all.
Much to his astonishment, Lucius had kept up his end of their deal, and paid for everything that Draco would need to remain comfortable, so long as their only son never came back home. Draco had no issues with this now, it was clear that he wasn’t going to suffer poverty due to his new condition, and he had less resentment for his parents, he still had no respect for his father, after what he did and after he kicked him out of their house, but he could live with this.
Draco runs over every single bad thing that could happen by saying anything right now, and then he meets Harry’s eyes for a brief moment, “I’m gay.”
Draco leads them to the ground, Harry laying back in the grass, a soft moan escaping his lips as Draco’s fingers trail over his inner thigh.
The thought of Draco entering his body in any capacity has Harry desperate to come, he wants more than anything Draco’s cock filling him and making him scream. Harry’s hips thrust up instinctively as his orgasm seizes him and he comes, spilling over his hand, breathing heavily.
Luna smiles, “My boyfriend dressed as a Pygmy Puff,” she says pointing at the young man dressed as a pink puffball.
“I know what I’ve been told, and what I’ve read, and as far as the vampire life cycle goes, I’ve only been a vampire for six months,” he says, “there’s plenty I still don’t know.”
“Ah,” Draco yelps, quickly pulling his hand back. That’s when he notices the sliver of daylight, that has landed on the bedsheets, coming through the parted curtains. Draco looks down at his hand, it was reddened, and slightly blistered, where the sunlight met his skin. Draco, quickly scrambles to the other side of the bed, trying to stay out of the line of the sunlight.
Harry doesn’t feel like he’s just walked in on Draco feeding, what he saw looked like much more than that.
Harry smiles, watching Draco. His blonde hair is a mess, and his eyes are so gentle, it makes Harry want to sweep him into his arms and kiss him. Draco looks so different in the privacy of his own bedroom, in his own bed, and Harry thinks he might love this man.
“No, if it’s passed from vampire to vampire, it can’t attach to human cells and is only in the bloodstream until the magic clears it, and heals the bite,” Draco explains.
Harry wouldn’t let up until Draco agreed to do it again, proving that he had more control than he was willing to admit to himself. After that Draco began to feel like he was exploiting Harry because he loved the taste of his blood. Draco compromised with himself, by never once asking Harry to let him feed on him, but only doing so when Harry offered himself to Draco. And Harry often offered himself to Draco, letting it slip once that it made him happy that he could provide Draco with blood he needed to survive, and the fact that Draco actually enjoyed it, made it easier for Harry to put up with the discomfort of being bitten and having his blood drain into Draco’s mouth.
“It was Pansy,” Blaise says casually, “She’s always been jealous of Draco, and she can’t stand when anyone else is happy and she’s not. Though I doubt that bitch has never been happy in her entire life.”
Harry smiles talking to Ron always made him feel better, “I was going to do some reading,” he says, “but I never actually got my book from the shelf,” he says.
Harry looks back at Draco, “I’m not going anywhere,” Harry says, “You’re in no condition to be on your own right now.”
“Ronald would never let that happen, Harry,” she says, “You’re his best friend, he would die without you, Harry.”
Draco rolls his eyes, leave it up to Potter to use a word like that, “I haven’t had a desire for human flesh if that’s what you’re asking.”
Draco walks into the living room, “You’re early,” Draco says, “It’s Jamie, right?” he says trying to remember his name. Draco decided if he was going to start using feeders more often that he should at least try to remember their names.
Harry smiles, walking into the closet, “Well look at you,” he says, unable to stop himself looking at Draco’s very naked bum.
Draco smiles, “Alright, I’ll help you find a girl to talk to,” he says, just as Tracey hands him a glass of mead. Draco smiles, taking a sip of his mead, “Come dance with me,” he says, holding his hand out for Blaise.
Harry looks over his shoulder at Draco, a coy smile on his lips, Draco can’t help but stare at Harry’s arse as he walks away, he wanted him. Draco follows Harry out of the lake, walking with him to the edge of the forest, before he grabs onto Harry’s wrist stopping him, “Don’t go,” he says.
It’s three days later that Draco finds himself pacing around his living room, impatiently waiting for the green fire to signal the arrival of his guest, at his newly connected Floo fireplace.
“I hate you,” Draco says, “I’ve always hated you, I spent my entire life hating you, picking on you, being an asshole,” he says.
Draco’s voice is gentle as he speaks to Harry. It only drives Harry’s desire to please Draco, give him what he wants, make Draco happy.
When Harry comes, sweat coats his body, and he can’t see anything but white sparks in front of his eyelids, and he screams fucking screams as his come spurts hot and fast from his leaking cock, all over his stomach, and chest. And he can’t remember his goddamn name. Draco’s hips still as he comes seconds later, a loud moan erupting from within him that he had absolutely zero control over.
“Pardon me, Minister, do you mind if I borrow my date?” That cheeky smile was going to cause Harry so much trouble.
Draco plunges the spoon into the bowl, spooning the icy red blood dessert into his mouth, “This is amazing,” he mumbles, shoveling more into his mouth, trying to savor every single bite.
Harry steps from the fireplace, walking into the kitchen, seeing Zella making some hot tea, “Good morning Zella,” he says pleasantly.
Draco finds himself at a party and having to confront things about his new condition that he hadn't thought about, and then he has a little fun afterward.
“Because it’s not the kind of thing you hear from another person, it’s something you sort on your own.”
Harry sighs heavily, running his hands through his hair, “ugh, fuck me,” he sighs, pulling slightly at his hair, “Sorry Malfoy” he says, starting to walk off.
be Harry’s friend, that would be too difficult. And it was easier to hate him and continue to suppress his true feelings.
“Aren’t you afraid of touching the gay?” Draco says. Ever since he’d come out people had been treating him differently, and not in a good way. People were always assuming he wanted to sleep with any and every guy he ran into.
Coming out as Bisexual was not something Harry ever intended to do, he’d just liked to admire the male figure, and the sharp lines of their bodies, and chiseled jawlines sometimes a little stubble. He hadn’t been with many men, but those he had been with, had been only average lovers. None of them had been as wild or adventurous as Ginny had been with him, but that’s what you’d expect when you looked at her. However, when Harry had seen his new lover as even more adventurous as his past lovers, he’d decided it was just the Purebloods repression of sexual expression and freedom, that made them such damn good lovers.
“I don’t know what to say,” Draco says, “I don’t know what that’s like, it’s like you’ve been pulled out of the closet, but you’re trying so hard to go back,” he says, “I never thought of myself as in the closet, I knew that I liked guys and I just sort of let that be. When I decided to come out, it was more just to make it official I guess. I’m not ashamed that I like men, maybe ashamed of some of the men I’ve decided to go out with,” he says shaking his head, “but It’s simply just part of me.”
Harry looks back at Draco, “well,” he says pausing for a few long moments, “it doesn’t bother me,” he decides.
“We went to the Gargoyle’s Hideout, I figured you were going to need a drink after talking to Astoria,” Blaise explains, “You said it had to be that night, you couldn’t wait anymore to tell her, and you made me promise to make you do it, you don’t remember that?”
After class the following afternoon, Draco decided to take a shower, before he went out with Blaise for the evening. He walks up to the prefect’s bathroom, he can’t say he wasn’t taken back with surprise when Harry walks out, and they’re standing practically nose to nose. Harry is staring back into those beautiful silver eyes, and he’s suddenly at a loss for words.
Draco shrugs, “Probably, I’m going to look for my own place tomorrow, might as well stay in London.”
“See you in the morning,” Draco mutters, turning the lamp out before closing the curtains around his own bed, slipping his wand underneath his pillow, as he settles into bed letting sleep overcome him.
Draco gave Harry a nasty look and simply said, "I'd be careful if I was you, Potter. Hanging around riffraff like Weasley and Hagrid and the likes.. It'll rub off on you. C'mon boys". The three left without futher incident.
Harry gets roped in a duel set by Draco and Ron, but gets intercepted by Hermione. The four of them then find why the 3rd floor is forbidden.
McGonagall, however, still had her stern as ever expression, "thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley. Perhaps it would be more useful if I were to Transfigure Mr Potter and yourself into a pocket watch? That way, one of you might be on time."
Not having any breakfast, Harry leaped up and checked out what type of candies she had and bought a bit of everything off the trolley. Ron stared at Harry when he brought it all back to their compartment.
Harry was confused, as the Slytherin common room was in the dungeon, but he thought maybe there was a secret passage way for the students to use. Harry then suddenly remembered, and grabbed Draco and Ron and snuck away from the groups.
Then Harry did something very brave and very stupid: he jumped on the club and once he was over its head, Harry let go of the club and ended up on the troll's shoulders and held on its head. The troll tried to shake Harry off, but Harry then stuck his wand up its noise. Draco, Ron, and Hermione gave a sound of disgust. The troll was having enough and grabbed Harry by the ankle and pulled him off, and hanged him upside down.
Harry's mouth fell open, the dishes in front of the students with many food that Harry would like to eat on one table. Harry got a bit of everything and began eating. As they were eating, ghost appeared and introduced themselves to their houses. The Slytherin got The Bloody Baron. As the feast went on, the students began to talk about their families and Harry heard about how their families are "All pureblood".
"Everyone in?", Hagrid shouted who had a boat to himself. Once he saw everyone was in, he finished, "Right then-- FOWARD!"
To Harry, those words might as well fallen on deaf ears as he was too much in wonderment and excitement as he took in the sights of Diagon Alley. As Hagrid took him down the shops, pointing out each of them for Harry, Harry attention turned to a group of kids as they talk excitedly about a "Nimbus 2000" and how it's the fastest model yet. Shaking off his wonderment for a brief period, Harry looked at Hagrid and asked, "But Hagrid, how am I supposed to pay for all of this? I don't have any money".
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry and practically dragged him out of the common room. Harry whined as they started to walk towards the trophy room. He really wasn't in the mood to duel, regardless of who it's between. They made their way to the third floor, without running into Filch and into the trophy room. They were the only ones there and so they waited. Harry was slowly falling back to sleep when he heard two familiar voices:
After charms, defense against the dark Arts came, and at first everyone was looking forward to this class, however it turned out to be a bit of a joke. For one, the class smelled like garlic and when asked how he got rid of a zombie, all Quirrell did was go pink and talk about the weather.
The first week of Hogwarts didn't really start well for Harry, seeing how the perception of Slytherin wasn't good.
Harry was starting to hate when Draco used his first name like. He knew when Draco did that, he was serious. Hoping to cheer him up, Harry said, “ok. How about this? Since we have flying lessons, me and you partner up and after that, we can hang out. That sound good?"
The three boys were speechless. Never in a million years had they expected Hermione Granger to lie to a teacher. While McGonagall was shocked, she then said, Well -- in that case... Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own? 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment." She then looked at the three boys and said, "As for you three. I hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many First year students could take on a full grown troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points... Will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck."
Once everyone was ready, she then said, "When I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground hard. Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet, then come back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle-- three-- two".
There was a bit of an uncomfortable silence for both boys before Harry found the courage to speak up.
"Double Potions With the Gryffindors. Taught by Snape. Heard he favors us over any other of the houses, so it should be extremely easy."
Harry then said, “Just because I’ve been talking to Ron doesn’t mean I stopped talking to you, you know.”
Also sorry about the long wait. I would've put this up yesterday, but I was on a call with my dad with the DC fandome live stream, and oh my god... THE BATMAN, SNYDER CUT
Draco scowled, "Yes... Me and Wesley are purebloods." His voice was laced with venom, as if he hated that fact. He continued, "but with the fact that their father interacts with muggles, their entire family are blood traitors, which is just as bad as being a Mudblood."
"But we don't feel like leaving, do we boys? You see, we ate our food, and you still seem to have som-"
Harry and Ron were quickly becoming best friends. Even some of the Gryffindors had to admit that Harry didn’t seem that bad. Still, there was more than half of them convinced that he was playing an act and will strike, but Harry ignored them. Ron even tried to introduce Harry to Fred and George, to which Harry wasn’t sure he was ready for. To his surprise, the twins were welcoming to Harry and made him laugh with their stories and jokes. While they were friendly, to say his Slytherin roommates weren’t exactly pleased with his choice of Gryffindor friends, especially Draco. Harry did feel bad as he thought Draco felt abandoned by him. Harry saw Draco walking towards the Great Hall and sped up to catch him.
Harry and Ron changed in silence. Well, Ron tried to give reassurances that he'll be great in Hogwarts, regardless of what background he comes from, which Harry was thankful for. Harry's mind, however, turned to which house he'll be in. While he's gotten good marks before, he didn't think he would be Ravenclaw worthy. He was hard working, but that's because his uncle and aunt made him do all the work. He's definitely had his brave moments, standing up to his cousin and his gang, and he's definitely gotten out of trouble before by fast talking his way out, so for Harry it could be only Slytherin or Gryffindor.
Harry's heart did somersaults, as he heard murmurs and whispers at first, but then the Slytherin table did the loudest cheer as Harry walked down to the table, avoiding the gaze of stunted and shocked students from the other tables, most notably Gryffindor. Some of the other Slytherin students began chanting, "WE GOT POTTER, WE GOT POTTER" as Harry sat near Draco, who looked more than happy to have Harry join him. As the sorting resumed and finished, Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He beamed at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more to see them.
The woman then said, "Ohhhh, I'm sorry George". She then motioned George to go through the platform. George walked up to the mother and smiled and said, "I'm only joking, I am Fred!" And went through the platforms with George following right behind him. This made Harry giggle and start to walk up to the woman and the youngest boy.
correctly. The class tried to make their feathers float, but nobody was making theirs float. Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
Hermione, on the other hand, wanted NOTHING to do with whatever was under the trap door. She refused to speak to any of them, however Ron found this as a positive. He explained how much of a bossy know-it-all, both inside and outside the classrooms. Harry and Draco could only imagine how bad is out of the classrooms. As the school year progressed, Harry felt more and home at Hogwarts than Privet Drive. The lessons were becoming more and more interesting now that he learned the basics. He felt like he actually had a family with Draco and Ron and his family.
"Sorry", he said tearfully, "but have you seen a toad?" Both Harry and Ron shook their heads and then the boy wailed.
As the boys played Exploding Snap, their conversation went back to what would be under the trap door.
Harry then said, "Hagrid! This break in happened on my birthday! It might've happens while we we're there!"
The boy was about to comment, but then his attention was directed to the front window, "I say, look at that man!"
Harry then pushed his trolley to the barrier. It looked very solid. He then walked faster to the platforms. He was going to crash and be in so much trouble. Breaking into a run now, he closed his eyes and prepared for the crash... But it never came. Harry then opened his eyes and saw a platform packed with people. A scarlet steam engine with a overhead sign that read "Hogwarts Express". Harry smiled. He done it.
When Harry was brought to the back of the shop, he was placed on a stool next to a boy with a pale pointed face.
Harry would've assumed this was because the fact that he was head of Slytherin, but McGonagall was the head of griffindors and she didn't do any favors. Mail was then dropped off. To Harry's surprise, Hedwig dropped off a note in front of Harry. He opened the letter and saw it was Hagrid, who invited him to tea at 3. Harry wrote a response and sent Hedwig off. With a promised class that should be easy and a afternoon to see Hagrid, Friday should be a nice and simple day.
"Fine!" Draco thought for a moment and then said, "Crabbe.  Midnight, all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room, it's always unlocked."
Harry wanted to ask what a Mudblood was, but he decided against it, seeing how angry Draco was getting. As their desserts came, Harry looked up at the high table to see Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, hooked nose, and shallow skin. When the hooked nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban and straight into Harry's eyes, a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on his forehead.
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song while the hat bowed to each four tables and then became quite still again.
"Hmmm, difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent... Oh my. And a nice thirst to prove yourself. Now.. Where to put you...", The hat spoke to him, each word making Harry's heart go by faster.
"Oh, c'mon Harry. There's no way I'd be mad at you for that. Yeah, I'm surprised, no doubt. But mad? No way."
Harry just nodded. And Draco continued, "Purebloods are families with no muggles or muggle-born in their families."
The redhead then asked, "Anyone sitting in here? Everyone else is full". To which Harry shook his head and jestered at the seat across from him.
No sooner than Hooch left, Draco then laughed, "Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lard given this a squeeze" Draco had Neville's Remembrall in his hand as he continued, "He would remembered to land on his fat ass."
Harry sighed and slumped back in his seat, "Ron, I'm really.. Really sorry about that. I didn't know he would..." Actually, Harry had some idea Draco would say something nasty. He just hopped Draco didn't.
He spoke, "Welcome! To a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you"!
Harry, Draco, and Ron couldn't believe it. They were awarded house points without any of them getting into more trouble. The teachers then told them all to return to their room as soon as possible. As they did, Draco said to Harry, "you do know you climbing on the troll's back was a extremely dumb thing to do, right?"
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was started to see she was in tears.
Ron pulled out his very battered looking wand and raised it when the compartment door slid open again. It wasn't the toadless boy this time, but this time a girl with lost of bushy hair and was already in her New Hogwarts robes.
The pain had come and gone quickly, but the feeling that look he gotten from the teacher didn't shake off. He gotten the impression that the teacher didn't like him, for some odd reason.
Harry shrugged, "I know. Still had to help. She wouldn't be in that situation if we didn't make fun of her."
Harry couldn't believe it. It was just his first week and already lost a house point. He waa taught two things already; Snape clearly didn't favor him just because he was in Slytherin, and that assessment when he first saw Snape about not liking him? That was wrong because he was sure Snape hated him. The lesson didn't improve for Harry, save for Draco, who Snape clearly favored over them all. After the class, Harry was in very low spirits. He didn't even know why Snape hated him so much.
Ron gave Harry a comforting smile, "Relax Harry. Like I said, Fred likes to joke like that. I'm sure it won't be that bad".
Draco jumped down from the footstool and looked at Harry, "Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts Harry. Maybe we'll be sorted into Slytherin."
"What on earth were you thinking?" She began, her voice cold with fury. Harry wished he could come up with something to keep them out of trouble, but couldn't find the words. He also wished Ron would put his wand down. McGonagall then continued, "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why weren't the four of you in your dormitories?"
The four held their breath for a while, Ron still having his wand still raised high. It was Hermione that spoke first.
Snape then continued, "tell me, what would I get if added powdered root of Asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Walking through the crowds, Harry saw the first few carriages filled with students, some talking to families through the windows, some fighting over seats, Harry even heard a older lady sighing to a boy that had lost his toad. Harry went through the crowds before finding a empty compartment near the end of the train. Putting Hedwig inside first, but had trouble heaving his trunk towards the train door.
Harry looked at Ron, and began to introduce him, "Ron, this is Draco Malfoy. Draco this is-". A snicker that was poorly hidden by a cough escaped Ron, which made Draco go Red.
Draco, Harry, and Ron couldn't stop talking to each other after their adventure. They grew closer as they theorized what could be under the trap door. Harry filled them what he knew already and the three of them were already looking forward to another adventure. Draco and Ron, while not friendly friendly, were on better terms than how they started. For one, they discovered they like the same Quidditch teams, but even with that they still argue about what other teams are better than the other. For Harry, he rather them argue and bicker about which is better than them actually fighting.
The boy didn't seem to notice as he continued, "My father's next door buying my books and my mother is up the street looking at wands. Then I'll drag them to look at the racing brooms".
"Sit down", Snape snapped at Hermione. "For your information Potter, Asphodel and Wormwood make a sleeping so powerful, it is known as the Draught of the Living Death. A Bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and will save you from most poisons. As for Monkshood and Wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which goes by the name Aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
“I’m saying that you have to prove yourself! If you happen to have these powers, then why don’t you go on and get all of us out of here? I bet you can’t do it!”
Mere seconds later was he free and mounted on Carpet with Abu in his arms. Harry listened intently to Abu’s tale about how Jafar had stormed into Harry’s room, trashed the entire place in his hunt for the golden lamp. Terrified, Abu and Carpet had fled the scene unseen, and when they finally found the courage to come back, Harry had been gone, Jafar ruled with magic and Draco was imprisoned.
What  met him upon his arrival wasn’t an unusual view per se, but there was one significant difference. There was a large man who had taken possession of a much smaller person who he probably planned to perform his needs on. Only, usually that happened to the petite girls in town. And this person was… well, ‘petite’ certainly was the right word, but ‘girl’ was not. In the hands of the large man was another smaller, hooded man who furiously kicked about, trying to get free.
“Speak with me about what?” came a dark, booming voice from the other side of the hallway. A man, about the same height as Draco’s father, stepped closer to them. He was clad in mostly black clothes, except for the sangria red decorations and his many rings and jewels placed on his hands and head. “Is anything the matter, Lucius?”
Still, it refused to listen and in his desperate state with too many strong feelings mixed up within him, Harry found himself crying. He was scared. He was so scared. Scared of the fire, scared of dying — no, he wasn’t scared of dying, he was scared of not having lived a full life before dying — and he was scared of losing his best friend.
“It’s okay, thank you, Genie.” Harry said. “But we have to get back to the palace. I must speak with Draco, because I’m fairly sure of who did this!”
I can’t bear it either, but I’d rather watch him like this for the rest of my life than not see him at all.
“On whose request comes this order?” the stranger asked, stepping up in between the guards and Harry.
“No!” Weasley whispers. “No, it can’t be! He can’t be!” With each word, his voice grows louder and louder until at last he shouts: “NO! HARRY CAN’T BE DEAD!”
I see Draco open his mouth, and since he’s my best friend I know he’s going to say something incredibly bad, no matter what it is. So I hurry to cut in before him, not thinking about what I’m about to say. “That I like you!”
When they finally were able to stand again, they went back out of the room. They had only gotten a few metres when they heard a loud crash coming from the main entrance hall. Hurriedly, they made their way there. In the hallway stood Jafar, proudly holding the lamp in his hands. In front of him stood Lucius, looking absolutely furious.
experience, and there are times that it hurts too much for him, but at least he is not broken. And he is as whole as anyone could be after going through that. And I think that you should acknowledge that. You should go talk to him. Get to know him. Leave all of that stupid rivalry behind you and maybe try to become his friend. He might not say it, but I know that he wants it, he wants to be with you. And Salazar knows he deserves that. And–”
Everything is white. The walls. The floors. The ceilings. The windowsills. The curtains. The bedsheets. White, white and more white. Occasionally, the white is disturbed by some steely grey, such as the bedposts and the buttons on the beeping machines that stand beside the one occupied bed. The grey doesn’t bring any comfort at all. It makes everything seem even more washed out. Lifeless.
And so it continued. Praise after praise, compliment after compliment. All Harry could do was smile, continue giving money and think of what lay ahead: the Palace!
Draco hadn’t even seen the prince who had called for his presence. He hadn’t needed to. It was just another prince who wished to marry him, to follow the constitution. It had angered him to no end that they just didn’t seem to understand that there were more important things than the laws of marriage for royalty. It had angered him so much he couldn’t even appreciate that at least it had been a prince this time and not a princess.
“Of course, Draco, my starling. I’d do anything for you. Let’s get on to plan the wedding. We’ll have it tomorrow at the time that the sun sets!”
Hand in hand, they went through the palace, whispering happily to each other. All thoughts about what had happened earlier had escaped Harry’s mind — it was too full of Draco. Until they arrived to the dining hall, that was. For inside the grand room stood the man that Harry believed had tried to, once again, have him killed.
“Yes. You are the one that got me out of the lamp, and so I am required to grant you three wishes, just like any other genie.”
The man looked curiously upon Harry with an unwavering gaze, yet it didn’t make Harry uncomfortable. He liked being watched by this man.
Each breath began to hurt, the foul air frying his trachea, eating is lungs. He welcomed the pain. He stopped trembling. He didn’t know if it was because his body couldn’t move anymore, that he was incapacitated, or if he just... let everything go. Let the darkness embrace him.
There was no loud bang this time. Just the silent clatter of metal falling onto marble, as Genie’s wristbands unlocked and fell to the floor.
“Carpet, where’s Abu? Did he fall too? We have to save him!” The mat didn’t seem to listen to him, and Harry grew more and more frantic. “Come on! Let’s go find him! Come on, come on, come on!”
As yet another pillow hits me in the head, I decide to give up and wait until tomorrow to finish up my gift shopping. I set down my catalogues, half-filled parchment and quill and carefully put some protection charms over them. I wouldn’t really want anything to be destroyed by the ongoing chaos. Looking up, I see that Draco has already done the same and he is currently calmly just watching the ruckus. More often than not, I notice his eyes flicker to – and occasionally linger on – one Gryffindor in particular. I smile.
This far, it hasn’t. But I’m not giving up. It’s all I can do. Every night, I let the tones sound through the hospital room. And every morning, I go quiet, since the rising sun reminds me that yet another day has started, and I’m still on my own. And I cry again.
He drove Draco to and past his breaking point within a week. He made Draco lose his perfect composure, his stoic lift of his chin.
All I can do is whisper out, “I’m sorry… I wanted to save him… but I was too late… I’m sorry… I… Iov… I’m sooo sorry.”
It had all been very well throughout the day. The boys had stayed in Scorpius’ room most of the time, except when they surprised Draco and came to help him set the table for dinner. It seemed Potter’s son had some rather good influence on Scorpius, Draco thought while the two boys chatted in low voices, and he smiled fondly at them.
Harry had always known that Draco was fair,  that was essentially the only thing that everyone and anyone knew about him. Harry had also heard that he was fierce, that he threw tantrums whenever he didn’t get what he wanted. But after meeting the man, he had a hard time believing that rumour was true. The prince had shown that he could be demanding, for sure, but he had only shown that side of himself when other people needed it — he never used it for himself.
He kept watch and let the taste of salt be the guide to his best decision yet. He would stay, as long as he could, so he could keep Draco away from those tears. He would be better. He would be what Draco deserved. Or at least, he was going to try to be what Draco deserved. He didn’t have too much belief in himself, but fuck all, he was Harry Potter, the youngest Commander Auror ever, and even though he couldn’t handle a bunch of spiders, he would give his everything to save Draco from the pain.
You feel quite offended by his demand to invade your personal space and decide to repay him by stepping upon his feet.
You realise you’re better off wasting your time elsewhere. Though he evidently has his rather (unintentional) hilarious moments, there are better places to be. Like, in your room in your hotel. You turn around to leave.
I flinch at the name, but quickly collect myself. “I don’t care. It’s not worth living if he’s not here. I don’t want to live without him.”
“Harry?” Draco whispered a while later. They had been quiet for quite a long time, just enjoying the warmth of the other person. “This is really lovely, but… you know we have to go back right?”
Panic rising in his chest, Harry once again ran around the room, looking under every cloth he could see. His best friend was nowhere to be seen. Harry felt his heart ache so much he found it hard to breathe, and he didn’t know what to do. His pulse began to race and soon his entire body was shaking. Then Draco was there by his side, holding him firmly. Consistently, he worked to calm Harry down, petting his hair softly and mumbling reassuring words into Harry’s ear. He didn’t know if it was the words or the vibration they sent through Harry’s skin that did the wonder, but nonetheless, it worked. Fairly soon were they both sitting on the floor, breathing normally again, no more trembles rushing through their hands.
She’s the one that brings me Harry’s clothes. She always brings two sets; one for Harry, one for me. I can’t stand wearing my own clothes anymore. I crave the soft fabrics of Harry’s jumpers, the soft scent of cinnamon that always clings to his shirts.
Time goes by, but I don’t know how much. Maybe it’s mere minutes, maybe it’s whole days. I have no clue really. But it doesn’t matter. Because I have made up my mind. Harry Potter had been my last hope. He had been my life line, my ticket out of this hell. He was the one that was supposed to fix this. And he was gone.
When they got out of the dungeon, Harry was surprised to see that it was dark outside, the air frilly. Why would he be executed in the darkness of the night? It didn’t make any sense. He didn’t ask any questions though. Not even when the man asked him to mount a horse or when they set course straight out into the empty desert.
“You are. I promise. I’ve seen enough of that today.” A faint smile crossed Harry’s face, and it once again made Draco’s heart ache. “Hey, how about you stay here tonight? Then you’ll be here when he wakes up. And you can talk about… whatever you need to talk about?”
“Oh, I will be sure to be that now. I’m the Sultan of Agrabah, the most powerful sorcerer in the world and the most powerful genie in the world. You can do
Genie winked before snapping his fingers and then he disappeared, leaving Harry to stare into the thin air with a heavy feeling in his chest.
“Wrong,” Genie said, and when Harry raised his eyebrows at him he explained. “You are not falling in love with him because you
Naturally, I’m very happy for Draco, he deserves a break from all the evil in his life and it’s very evident that Harry grants him that opportunity. During the times that they aren’t trying to show off their relationship to me, and actually are just…
Ron entered next, broad shoulders, jaw set in a proud stance. Eyes burning equally as much as Draco’s did.
Then I began to sing. Rarely any words, just melodies that came into my mind, hoping the sounds would bring Harry back.
Amidst his brooding, Harry noticed the faint sound of footsteps closing in. Hurriedly, he hid the sleeping Abu under his vest. Could he not save his own life, he was going to do anything in his power to save Abu’s.
While travelling along the sand dunes, Harry let himself close his eyes and rest. He let himself daydream. He dreamt about his time as one of the best thieves in Agrabah, and he dreamt about his childhood with Abu and the old man, who had given him his first golden coin. No, he wasn’t dreaming, Harry suddenly realised. He was
Just as the stranger seemed to becoming completely relaxed, and he lifted his hands to draw back the hood, there was a loud bang coming from outside the doorway. A moment later, the room was invaded by at least a dozen palace guards, all of them with swords drawn as they surrounded the two men. In an instant Abu was sitting on Harry’s shoulder, chattering agitatedly.
Ron comes by at least once every day. He can’t stay very long most times, too much to do as a single dad since he and Hermione got divorced. But sometimes he stays the entire afternoon. He doesn’t talk, but his presence is somehow more consoling in silence than it would’ve if he tried to comfort me.
He’s sprawled on the ground suspiciously close to Malfoy and they are whispering to each other. Probably bickering again, as usual. On the other side of him, Dean and Seamus lie, and they too are murmuring, facing one another. I smile. The two of them might not be officially together yet, but I’m sure it’ll happen soon rather than later. If it doesn’t, the world will probably stop spinning.
The sun had been down for over an hour, and the rising moon found a view of Draco Malfoy sitting on the border of Scorpius’ bed, passionately reading a bedtime story. Tonight, though, the bed wasn’t just occupied by Draco’s only child. There was an additional person sharing Scorpius space: Albus Potter. The two boys' friendship had flourished into something rather beautiful and Draco was more than happy to provide all the comfort he could for them during their sleepovers.
He didn’t answer because he couldn’t lie to Draco. And if he answered, he knew his words would be lies. He couldn’t promise that.
“Oh, that’s my amazing thieving best friend!” Harry cried out and once again hugged Abu to his chest, before taking the lamp and examining it. “I wonder what the man wanted this for? It’s clearly not very valuable. Look at how dirty it is! But what, I think there’s anything written there. I can’t quite make it out.”
They flew over Agrabah, away from all their responsibilities. They flew over the desert and oases, saw humans and animals. They flew and flew as time went by. They flew until the sun started to set and it painted the world in orange, purple and indigo. They flew until the sky was black and white, stars blinking down on them. They flew until the sun once again was peeking over the horizon.
Though the ride was quite long, it still wasn’t quite long enough. Harry found that the rush of flying was a better relief than anything he’d ever done before — even better than jumping down from rooftops and between houses — and the carpet turned out to be excellent company to keep Harry and Abu’s excitement on top. Harry would’ve loved to just stay in the cave, flying with Abu and Carpet forever. But he remembered the promise he had made the man above the cave, and he was determined to fulfill that quest.
“It’s like a whole new world!” Draco exclaimed, and Harry could only agree. Yet, Harry wasn’t only looking at the scenery around them; he was watching the man beside him.
“Uh, I don’t think I’m powerful enough to do that, because that’d mean I need to change the past, but I can however make you
Potter blushes. He’s quite cute when he does that. Takes away the killed-an-Evil-Dark-Lord-vibe a bit.
The man starts to pack down is little collection of junk. Just as you’re about to turn and walk away, you see the moonlight reflect on the man’s skin and you see that it has a tint of blue. You stop in your tracks and look at him more intently, before making up your mind.
“I hardly think so. I’m Prince Harry Alibabwa, I come from far away. Further away than you have ever been. I highly doubt that you have had the luck to meet such grandeur as me.”
“Oh, Prince Harry, forgive us if we have trespassed, but he was very cute,” the youngest servant said, bowing when she saw who Abu had went to.
of them sit down on the loveseat instead of one of them sitting there and the other next to me on the sofa. I furrow my brows as I ponder that a bit, but my thoughts are quickly discarded when I’m distracted by the card that Harry pulls out from inside his robes. It’s one I haven’t seen before. Admittedly, it’s very pretty. It’s made of silver cardboard, and on it there’s an enchanted play of snow falling on the ground and there are green letters spelling out
“Aw, Abu, are you sad? But I’ll get out of this, I promise! Prince Draco promised me that he’d talk to the palace staff and that should get me out of here. He asked me if I trusted him, and I do. I really do. And you trust me, don’t you?”
“Harry, I was in the middle of a nap, did you real—” Genie stopped mid-sentence when he realised it wasn’t Harry who was holding the lamp. “What is going on here?” he asked warily.
“Thank you,” he whispered through tears and the widest smile Harry had ever seen. “Thank you so much, Harry. You truly are a diamond.”
“I, Harry Potter, am disturbing you, for I wish to enter the Cave of Wonders,” he said sternly. Immediately, the tiger opened its mouth, allowing an opening to appear. After just a tint of hesitation, Harry determinedly made his way towards the tiger’s mouth. Just as he entered the cave, he felt something sting him in the neck. He threw a hand to see if there was an insect, but there was nothing there. He shook his head and thought to himself how the dungeon must’ve made him crazy.
“It’s okay,” Potter mutters. “I’m here, I found you. We’re okay.” Another light kiss on Draco’s cheek. It’s extremely intimate, but I can’t find it in myself to look away. “Look, Draco, I found a freckle,” Harry whispers and places a kiss higher on Draco’s face. “It’s very small. Almost invisible. But beautiful. And I found it.” Kiss. “Another here. I can count them. Hmmm… seven on this side.” Now, Potter just lets his thumb run across Draco’s skin, ever so gently. “And let’s see… eight on this side. They’re so beautiful. I found them. I found them and I found you. It’s okay. You’re okay. I love you.”
That night was the first of many that Harry and Albus stayed over at the Malfoy’s together. On the anniversary of that first night, one year later, Draco asked them to move in. Harry reminded him about the other two children he had at home, but Draco just smiled. They would never be a problem, no matter how much problem they’d ever stir up.
The boy relaxed into the bedlinings, and finally looked content to be where he was. Even when Draco was sure that the boy had fallen asleep, he kept singing. It was something about the song that made him feel like he had to finish it.
At that Harry quickly looked down on his feet, suddenly very interested in the layers of dust that covered them. But, for some reason he yet didn’t know, he wanted this stranger to trust him. So he swallowed hard a couple of times before hoarsely answering.
Potter’s grin widens and his eyes darken with devilish determination. It’s not hard to see why he’s the one that vanquished the Dark Lord when he looks like that. I feel a shiver run down my spine and pray to my ancestors that Potter won’t notice it.
Naturally, the monkey didn’t listen. Instead, he jumped onto Harry’s shoulder and the two sped off down the street — towards the tumult Harry had heard a few moments earlier and away from the swearing salesman.
to serve until someone wishes them to be free. You are trapped within your own powers, Jafar. It’s over!”
“No, I still have three wishes,” Harry said. “I never actually wished for you to get us free, you did that on your own.”
When they found the place where the lamp was, Harry was instantly reminded of the man’s warning for traps. The lamp was placed on the top of a mountain which was surrounded by a lake of lava. He asked Carpet to stay back and keep an eye on Abu while he himself made his way towards the lamp. Carefully, he approached the lamp and lifted it from its pedestal with a tender, yet firm hold on it. Nothing happened, and Harry let out a breath of relief. Now it was only to get back to stable ground and then fly all the way back to the cave’s opening and then he’d be free!
He was back. Back where it all started. Back where Lily and James died protecting him. Back where their screams filled his ears.
“No, you’re not,” Genie cut in. “You are a hero and a diamond. You are no longer just a diamond in the rough; you’ve gone past that. And I promise that you’ll be just fine. Do you trust me?”
be something. His eyes fell upon a palace guard standing just outside the circle of people surrounding the scene, talking animatedly with a woman. Harry let a smirk spread onto his face before he told Abu to take off to their home and that he’d meet him there.
“Don’t worry, it was no big deal. They couldn’t have caught me, I promise. It’s not like there were a hundred bad guys with swords… only ten guards with swords! I’m sorry for worrying you, but I do have something to make it up for you.”
“Genie!” Jafar suddenly called out, causing both Genie and Harry to stiffen, afraid that he might had caught them. “Help me out here. I want to know how I can get even more power. How I could possibly become the most powerful man in the world, ever! More powerful than anyone in the past, present and
“You…” he began, letting his left hand brush over his beard. “You are a lot smaller than my last master. Or perhaps my memory has gotten worse.”
“Indeed, it is me,” Harry answered hurriedly. “And if you don’t mind, I have to get out of here to help this man to somewhere safe! Before that gora over there is gonna kill both of us.”
Another laugh escaped the man’s obnoxious mouth and he tightened his grip even more. He let the bag drop to the ground and he moved to place his hand upon the smaller man’s shoulder, threatening to take off his hood.
“Look at this, yes combination hookah and coffee maker, also makes Julienne Fries. It will not break, it will no — it broke…
I can see that obviously, Draco is trying his hardest to look bored, uninterested, in all that’s happening, but the small tinge of pink on his cheeks proves that he’s not completely focused on the snow falling outside. I smile lightly to myself. Who would’ve thought that someone like
“But I know he wouldn’t want another soul die. Especially not you. Especially not the one who killed Voldemort.”
“Thank you,” he says. “You don’t have to pay for it, I give it to you for free. After all, that’s the least I can do for a diamond in the rough.”
A tad reluctantly, I do raise my gaze from his body and let myself finally watch his face, bracing myself against whatever sort of rejection I will see in his blue eyes. Except, it isn’t there. Instead I’m met with a blinding smile, and I take in a sharp breath.
“Wait! Don’t go!” the man shouts. “I can see you’re only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, that you’d be the most rewarded to consider this.”
“Yes! Exactly. But when you’re… poor… like me, you don’t really have many options, do you? It’s all about getting through the day, earning your daily bread if you can. Dreams stay dreams. But dreams are still important. They are what keep you alive, so that you don’t just survive.”
He had entered the Palace trying to act as he thought royals acted. He had asked to see Prince Draco, had explained his mission was to ask him to marry him. It was as he had been talking about this that Draco had arrived, and he heard only the part about the marriage. He didn’t hear the part where Harry explained that he had met Draco once before, and that he hadn’t been able to think about anything but that meeting since. He had explained that with every second that went by had him falling deeper in love with him. But Draco only heard the question about marriage, and then he stormed out of the room.
He was still crying when he felt the carpet stop. He was still crying, hiding his face in his hands, when the carpet rolled him down onto a protrusion of the caves stone walls. He was still crying when he heard a very worried chatter and felt a hesitant pat on his shoulder by a very small hand. And then he was crying of fear and relief instead of fear and grief, all the while hugging his best friend closely to his chest. Then he was hugging the magic carpet, and they were all hugging each other, but he didn’t stop crying. Not until the fire burned out beneath them.
“This cave can only be entered by one person, and I am not that person. You are. You are, shall we call it a diamond in the rough.”
Abu nodded, but his eyes still betrayed his sorrowful feelings so Harry lifted him off the ground and placed him in his lap.
Hesitantly, he went to the glassdoors of his room and sneaked a look out over the garden. Down by Draco’s favourite fountain he could see the prince, sitting with a defeated posture while talking to the man by his side and… Abu! It
“Uh, I don’t know.” Harry said as he started to walk to the silhouette of Agrabah that he could see towering up by the horizon. “It’s quite a lot, to ask someone to wish for three things that could be anything, wish for any dream to come true. What would you wish for, Genie?”
If his touch grounded me, calmed me, before, this was the opposite. The moment our lips press against the other’s, the world starts to spin. Every inch of my body that meets his is on fire. It burns, but I love it. Kissing him seems to let his life force seep into me, and I feel more alive than ever. It ends too soon, yet I’m all out of breath when we part. Bloody menace of a Gryffindor!
From the left pocket of his trousers, Harry pulled out a freshly baked, still warm loaf of bread which he quickly broke into two equally big pieces and he handed one of them to Abu. Just as he was about to dig his teeth in to his part though, Harry noticed something in the corner of his eye: two children, about half his age, longingly eyeing the small piece of food. They wore clothes just as ragged as his, but unlike him, they didn’t have a light in their eyes, they had no hope for what happiness would come upon them in the future. It reminded him of how he himself had looked when he was younger, just after his parents had passed away and his aunt and uncle had thrown him out onto the street.
close to me, his body casting a deep shadow over me. Damn it, he’s tall. And handsome. A chill runs down my back and I swallow hard, completely ignoring how his close presence makes my trousers suddenly very ill fitting. It’s not
night, but I know it’s bad, and he only goes here when he's living through his worst memories or doubting himself more than usual.
I shouldn’t be here. This is their moment, and now I know my best friend is fine. I turn to leave, but–
. The green is a tad darker than the usual Christmas shade, but it’s definitely the right color for that card. It’s surprisingly elegant, to be something of Harry’s making.
The carpet instantly threw itself into an animated version of telling the man several stories through its limited access to sign language. The man followed all of it with copious interest. Not until Carpet was done did he let his concentration go back to Harry. He looked at Harry, inspecting him from head to toe.
The very moment his dead body falls to the floor, I am hauled back by strong arms, flung to the floor and then I receive kick after kick, hex after hex, curse after curse. But I don’t care. I did it. Nothing else matter than that I made Harry Potter’s dream come true. I close my eyes and take every punch, patiently waiting for the end to come. Maybe I’ll meet Harry there. If this could ever make up for my sins, maybe I will.
Hagrid led them down to what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. Slipping and stumbling, the first years followed. It was so dark on either side that Harry thought must be thick trees there. Finally, Hagrid called over his shoulder, "Ye' all get her firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec, just 'round this bend."
Hermione huffed and continued, “It was standing on a trapdoor, which means it wasn’t there by accident. It’s guarding something.”
Sorting happens and Harry wonders if he's in the right house. The boy who lived who stopped the darkest Wizard lord of all time sorted into the same house as him? Not a good sign.
This actually sparked some interest for Harry to try to keep the conversation going, "You mean like the Nimbus 2000?"
Harry quickly looked again to see McGonagall placing a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool, was a pointed wizard's hat that was very frayed, patched, and dirty. Harry thought they would have to try and pull a rabbit out of it. Then a rip near the brim opened while like a mouth and began to sing:
Just then, Neville shouted, "Trevor!" And there the toad was: by McGonagall's feet as Neville ran up the stairs to pick up Trevor. Neville then sheepishly looked up to the stern face of McGonagall, to which he blushed and sheepishly said, "Sorry" and slinked back to the group while the first years tried to hold back laugher.
"Hello, Hogwarts dear?" She said, before Harry even had a chance to speak. "Get the lot here, another young man being fitted up just now".
A pink faced girl with blonde put on the hat and after a moments pause, she was sorted into Hufflepuff. As each student was sorted into their respected houses, earning cheers from the houses they were placed in, McGonagall then reached Hermione who was placed in Gryffindor, to which Ron groaned. After more sorts, Draco was called and the hat barley touched his head before it called, "SLYTHERIN!" Draco joined his friends at the table, but not before smirking at Harry, who for all intents and purposes, was happy than Draco did get his wish. When Ron got called, he was also sorted in Gryffindor and joined his brothers.
Harry and Ron told them about their lessons, more specifically how Snape seemed to hate Harry, but like Ron, he told Harry doesn't like any student much, but Harry took note about how Hagrid couldn't seem to look him in the eyes as he told him that. Hagrid then talked to Ron about his brother, Charlie and again, Harry couldn't help but wonder if he did that on purpose. Harry then noticed a piece of paper lying of the table. He grabbed it and saw it was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:
Already on edge and getting annoyed with Peeves, Ron snapped at Peeves, “Get out of the way!” He swiped at Peeves, which was a big mistake.
Draco gulped, but did not obey. He knew that he’d eventually have to have this argument, with his father being so deeply entrenched in the ranks of that madman. He’d just thought he’d have more time. A year was not long enough to make the arrangements necessary for him to safely refuse to take the Mark. He needed to gradually withdraw from his Gringotts account, find a place to stay, a job…
He was laughing as left the room for the fireplace, sending her a quick mental message before using the Floo:
6) Severus is a deeply complex person, but every choice he's made leading up to Chapter One has been for his children. Remember that, even if it doesn't seem obvious.
“I can’t just bring her there, Minnie,” Severus countered. “Albus told me I need permission, and I'm not stupid enough to publicly stand up to Albus.”
of ephemeral magic is beyond me, but I suppose if my only exposure to divination was Sybill Trelawney I’d be a bit skeptical myself.”
For a moment, everything was quiet, peaceful even, but Draco knew his mother, and he could recognize that calculating look in her eye. He sat up straight, wary and careful. This was not peace. This was the calm before the storm.
“I won’t be cross with you,” Rose assured him quickly, reaching over to take his hand, weaving their fingers together. “You’re doing what you have to do to stay safe and I will
“We’ll do our work in the study tomorrow, then,” Draco offered. “You can completely control the wards and monitoring charms in there, right Severus? Then we’ll have zero distractions,
“You showed him that you have all the power,” Rose gasped, realizating dawning on her, turning towards her dad. “You showed him that he’s living on your good will, not the other way around. But if anyone says that––”
Rose gasped at her father's retort, placing a hand to her chest dramatically in mock alarm, inwardly cackling at all the shocked looks thrown their way.
Draco sighed dramatically and proceeded to heave himself on the cushion next to Rose, who tried very hard not to look at him. He was making the kicked kitten face and Rose could never stay annoyed when he pulled the kicked kitten face. Draco, of course, knew this all too well, the manipulative menace that he was.
“I give, I give!” Draco gasped not three seconds in, but not before he let out a rather undignified shriek. “Mercy, mercy!”
“He told you that,” Minerva replied, her smile mischievous and a bit worrisome, if Rose was being honest. The professor had never looked so feline. “But he didn’t say anything to
“Not a lot of families in Northern Europe still have their Gift,” Rose mused, leaning back into the couch again, grateful for the opportunity to discuss some magical theory with someone who wasn’t either related to her or as good as. “Either the Gifts weren’t Centralized correctly, if at all, or those that were Centralized were ripped apart until they fizzled out of the bloodline completely. My dad says that only the only Northern European Gifts still intact are the Prince, the Agard, and the Vitkus Gifts, and the Prince Gift is the only one left in the UK.”
was far far away and certainly not sitting across from her and glowering at her like she was evil incarnate, yeah, yeah that checked out) back into the parlor where he and Harry had been napping and allowed Rose five
Rose knew intellectually that Draco didn’t believe most of the anti-Muggle crap he spouted, not since 1993, at least, that it was a mask just as effective as her dad’s. But Rose didn’t know if she could handle her best friend calling anyone a Mudblood, even if she knew he didn’t believe it.
“Jonny, Mummy has to tell you something,” she tried to comfort him, sounding less and less like herself as she frantically tried to explain. Tried to make something right. “Papa wasn’t here. Papa left with Rosie to keep us safe. Papa loves you. Oh, God, honey, Papa loves you. And Rosie misses you. It’s my fault, baby. I couldn’t leave. I wasn't brave enough. I’m so sorry we couldn’t be a family. I’m so, so sorry, lovey.”
“I knew you’d worry,” she confessed, blushing a little as she bit her lip. “And that you’d do something stupid like try to stop me.”
She choked back a sob, remembering her arms were only half full. They were supposed to be a family. They were supposed to be okay. They were supposed to be at the cottage, cooing over their precious children, sharing soft, secret smiles.

She needed to let the truth pass her lips before there wasn’t a chance. She had kept too much from the people who loved her. Good Lord, James had died for a son who wasn’t his, a wife who had never loved him the way he had thought.
feeling guilty. Especially when her dad was involved–– hurting him was like hurting a small, disgruntled kitten, and to make matters worse he
Lily remembered their plans. How she was going to be in his House, and when that didn’t work out, how the two of them would beat the odds. And they had, in a way. She just had to hold their son to her breast to feel that fact stir in her bones.
His mother laughed loudly and leaned forward conspiratorially, her eyes bright. “It’s not cheating if you don’t get caught.”
“What you should do is take your seat back and let me give the bloody vision before I have to hex you,” Rose cut him off. Her dad glared at her, but took his seat back with surprisingly good grace as she stood back up, only jostling a still groggy Fletcher a little. Taking pity on him, she sighed.
“It’s not broken,” Snape cut them both off, studying Harry’s ankle carefully. “Badly sprained, but we are wizards for a reason.
“I could scarcely believe it when it first happened,” her voice had taken on an almost hypnotic tone, as if this was a sort of bedtime story Narcissa concocted to cheer him up and Draco was six again, crying into his pillow because Daddy had missed another family dinner. “This little first year won all of Lucius’ allowance in one night of poker after having gone through the entire House. It was madness–– no one could believe it. They all thought he was cheating–– he must have been, Lucius and Bast were the best card players in the House. But the anti-cheating charms didn’t detect a thing, so by two in the morning he’d very happily marched up to the Owlery and sent the 500 Galleons he’d won to his mum. But here’s the problem,” she lowered her voice. “Everyone expected him to be using magic to cheat. But Severus was much too clever. He knew magic would get him caught, and besides he was only eleven–– what magic did he know? He counted cards.”
Sirius couldn’t think of anything to say to that, it was obvious. Harry was going to go back upstairs (after a quick prayer for his godfather’s soul) when Kreacher appeared right next to him and scared him out of his wits.
When Harry entered the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, he hadn’t been expecting to see Molly Weasley and Severus Snape of all people in a heated argument. Sirius and Snape would argue all the time, Hermione had said, but even Ron had forlornly admitted that the git treated Mrs. Weasley with a strange amount of courtesy, even having gone so far as to make grocery runs when she asked. But it seemed that the peace of the last couple weeks had shattered as the two sniped at one another.
“Potter,” he spat out, venom laced in his words. Harry turned to look right into the man’s dark eyes, not allowing himself to be cowed. “Do tell your beloved
know I love you, though,” he murmured. Rose’s hand stopped its ministrations on his mop of hair. “Right, Rose?”
“Severus is right,” Draco sighed, ignoring both his mother’s indignant scoffing and his godfather’s self-satisfied smirk. “Jews don’t have godparents, so Mum can’t be Rose’s godmother. But there’s no reason that she can’t be referred to as Rose’s aunt or something because we are family, blood or no, and if Severus’ only argument is that the name
visions? Are they more reliable? Because let me tell you, I don’t like to insult professors as a general rule, but I do wonder what exactly the Headmaster was thinking hiring
“You’ve come all this way, Ms. Snape, it seems a shame that your father looks ready to whisk you away so soon,” he said mildly. “Perhaps you should stay a bit and meet your new schoolmates. I’m sure that Severus can see himself home.”
Rose was so caught up in the whirlwind of yelling, the smile Fred was shooting her, the way George’s hair curled at the base of his neck, and how utterly
“She looks pale,” Rose’s dad groused, throwing off Minerva’s hand and tipping Rose’s head up by crooking a finger under her chin and surveying her. “And she never remembers to take the draught.”
Draco snorted, eyes gleaming, and Rose knew that the joke had been the right move. “All’s well, my lady,” he replied in mock-graveness. “I have vanquished the Black King, as the prophecy had foreseen.”
“If I’ve told you once,” Severus sniped at Draco’s mother while she glared murderously at him over Rose’s head. “I’ve told you a thousand times. You can’t be Rose’s godmother. Jews don’t
NOTE II: To my US readers-- this is going to be rough few weeks for us. I don't think there's anything particularly comforting I can say at this juncture, but as a Jewish person I can say this: Some days, the fascists do win. But their victories are
Draco watched in a kind of morbid fascination as Lucius nodded. This man was his father, the man who had been his hero not too long ago. He had been Draco's everything, and now? Now he was simply an obstacle to be surmounted.
“I’m going to tell Severus you cheat at cards,” he finally muttered petulantly, absentmindedly fiddling with the teaspoon.
“I don’t know what to say to that,” the professor finally said stonily, but much more levelly than Harry had anticipated. “Other than this. Rose is a good girl with her head on straight. She likes crappy music and cooking breakfast at ungodly hours of the night and she has more raw power in her little finger than you and I have combined. You do a disservice to yourself and to everyone here to bar her from coming to visit. But it’s your house, Black. Your house, indeed.”
“Harry,” Mrs. Weasley sighed, looking into Harry's eyes tiredly. “You don’t know everything about Severus. I doubt you know much at all.”
He brandished his wand and time seemed meaningless, lights too bright and sounds too loud as she began to grovel, shielding her son with her arms, hoping that mercy was possible, that somehow her perfect boy would live. Lily’s blood roared in her ears.
“It’s not great,” Draco told Rose honestly. “I-- I don’t like the person I have to be in public, Rose, and I don’t believe that sort of thing anymore, I promise. But it’s-- you’re going to be cross at me and I won’t be able to avoid it.”
I am so sorry for the late update! I just started college, and it's been beyond crazy.I'll try to be a bit more regular now that things have settled.
Blocking out the flurry of mutters that erupted after she mentioned her rather infamous grandmother, Rose snuck a look at Jonathan again, pleased to see that he looked more interested than he had before, but that was probably only because his friend was whispering rapidly in his ear. The two taller boys, however, were still looking at her. The one who had stopped her before, the one with the tiny scar on his eyebrow (the only difference she could spot between the two) gave her a discreet thumbs up. With that Rose rallied, finally turning to look at Black. For a moment, Rose was terrified. The man had clearly aged, but he looked similar enough to the man in her father’s Pensieve that Rose felt an intrinsic urge to run. It took her a second or two to swallow her fear, but when she did, her voice came out clear and true, and she felt her father’s quiet pride like a warm blanket covering her.
To be fair, he never was. But whenever Draco came back from the Snapes’ Cottage, he found himself brooding for hours afterwards. His godfather’s family was small and the cottage was the opposite of luxurious--- but to Draco, who had grown up surrounded in stark white wealth and dozens of tight-lipped relatives, it was surprisingly close to heaven. Severus and Rose made Draco feel like he was better, like he had something inside him worth loving.
“That’s just it,” she told everyone, tearing her gaze away from her brother, blinking hard to keep herself from tearing up. “I don’t know.”
“No,” he declared, his heart leaping to his throat as he tried to keep his eyes from watering. He bumped his forehead against Narcissa's. “I’m lucky to be
“Family Gifts are real,” Rose told the other girl firmly, her tone brooking no argument. “I should know. I’m the current recipient of the Prince Family Gift, and will be until I die. And when I die, another member of my family will receive it, just like I received it after my great-great-grandfather died, and so on and so forth until there is either no one left with enough Prince blood for the magic to be recognized or we lose access to the Gift in its entirety.”
She muffled a shriek as she heard doors slamming downstairs, Voldemort searching the kitchen and guest rooms. Fat, hot tears ran down her cheeks, causing her son to whimper as she pressed his face against hers. She kissed his forehead, his little button nose, and his fluttering eyelids, breathing in his perfect softness.
“Me too,” Draco said around a yawn. “But we’ll be fine, Snappy, promise. We’ll be together, won’t we?”
“Draco has been awfully quiet on the subject,” Rose cut in loftily before his mother could continue her tirade, smirking at him as both adults turned their heads to look at him because Rose was the kind of girl who just wanted to watch the world burn. “Perhaps we might get a third opinion?”
The four of them spent the rest of the evening in relative peace, Severus strong-arming Draco into accompanying Rose so that she could sing for them. He always got a wistful, far-away look in his eye when Rose performed, but Draco understood. Severus was notoriously close-lipped on the subject of Rose’s mother outside of the bare bones information (an auburn-haired French witch who suffered from a blood disorder that had infected about a third of Parisian wizards in the 80’s and 90’s and caused complications during Rose’s birth, resulting in her death three days later) but the one thing that Draco had managed to wheedle out of his godfather over the years was that the woman had had a lovely singing voice, one that his daughter had inherited.
Hermione: “So tell me about this Royal Sight, then. I have read that Gifts are extremely concentrated wells of magic, so does that mean you have more visions?
In which Draco angsts, Narcissa and Severus make a nuisance of themselves, and Rose is a little shit.
“I’ll try to do it when you’re out of earshot,” Draco promised. “I know it really upsets you to hear the sorts of things I’ll have to say. I don’t want to be the reason you’re sad, not when this year is already going to be so stressful.”
“If you don’t mind, Mr. Black,” Rose kept her voice polite and cheerful, though she wanted to strangle the man. “I really should give this vision now, if I can. It might be urgent.”
a fully-functioning adult, Severus Snape, you would not be skin and bones! I hope to Merlin that at least that girl of yours is getting fed because otherwise--- ”
“One,” Rosaline Snape began, counting on her fingers. “My favorite food is pasta with vodka sauce with cheese from the Robin Hood's Bay farmers market. Two,” she paused, considering. Harry watched as she finally made eye contact with her father, who was beginning to look murderous, but instead of crying and running for her life, as Harry was almost wont to do, even after all these years, the damn girl only grinned more widely as she cheekily continued.
“I would've liked to see him try,” his mum retorted archly and Draco laughed before his mother sobered. “It’s probably because of his father. The man was a scoundrel, and drank far too much and too often. I don’t blame him for being worried, even if I know he’d never turn out that way.”
“Then please, O Glorious One, share your wisdom,” Remus drawled as he chucked the magazine at Harry’s godfather’s head. “Leave not a word unspoken.”
“Oh, I know that,” Minerva smirked, her tone a bit more light-hearted. “And I think it was marvelously done. But Sirius is one of Albus’ favorites, Severus. Honestly, that was a very fine line you just walked.”
She suppressed a sob as a door down the hall was slammed, the house quivering from the magic. Her son sensed her distress, his smile melting away as he began to scream.
“That I’m not an important part of Rose’s life, that I’ve just been pushing my nose in where it doesn’t belong--”
Rose let her shoulders drop a little as she slowly relaxed and leaned back against the couch cushions.
Dumbledore’s eyes turned sad as he looked at Rose, nodding again. Then, his visage brightened considerably as a mischievous smirk spread across his face and he eyed her father and Black both.
2) Internalized homophobia is a thing that Draco, a product of an aristocratic, traditional community would most likely need to work through. If you're into an InstantlyComfortableWithHisSexuality!Malfoy, please look elsewhere. There are some awesome eighth year fics with that trope.
Rose, but this knee-jerk distaste, this instinctive callousness was all too reminiscent of the many memories her father thought he’d hidden from her. Rose’s stomach twisted painfully, and she felt wretched in her unhappiness. She wanted to let it all pour out of her, wanted to say
He ended up falling down the last few stairs rather spectacularly, much to his embarrassment. His ankle immediately began to throb. Sirius and Snape both simultaneously drew their wands at the sound and rushed over. At seeing him, Sirius sighed and pocketed his wand once more.
“I mean you can’t go, love, that’s all,” her dad replied, calmly using magic to transfer spaghetti into her waiting bowl. Usually such an action would make her smile, since it was only something he did when he was impatient to eat, which Rose always encouraged. But she was too furious to soften even a little. She huffed loudly and glared daggers at him.
“Yes, yes, you’ve all sorts of accolades, Dad, and dueling awards galore,” Rosaline waved her hand distractedly as she nabbed her father’s chair out from under him and stretched out her legs. “But I do actually have some news for the Order, you know.”
But Harry had also never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, so he let Ron drag him in after her.
“And?” She asked, gesturing to the two taller boys. “These two, at least, look older than me, and I’ve been formerly inducted into the Order. And Harry Potter--” her voice caught for a moment as she used her brother’s false name, but she rallied quickly, “Is literally one of You-Know-Who’s main targets. Shouldn’t he, at the absolute least, know as much information as he can? I mean, do you
After dismissing Winny, one of Lucius’ favorite (read: most bruised) house elves with a smile he hoped looked sincere, Draco heaved himself onto his bed and held the letter up towards the ceiling to read it.
“Albus, you can’t really be expecting us to decide our strategies based on a teenager’s ‘visions,’” Black whined, turning to the headmaster. “For all we know, telling tall tales runs in the family.”
he was, to keep looking at Harry and pretending he wasn’t Jonathan day in and day out. It made her want to run all the way back to the cottage and crush him into a hug, but now wasn’t the time. Jonathan needed protecting, and Rose--
Lily gazed, frozen, at the door to the nursery. She had bolted it shut, but any idiot could tell it would only buy her a few seconds once Voldemort climbed the stairway. But when she looked at her baby, her beautiful boy, Lily realized that’s all she really needed. Just another moment. Just another breath.
Harry noticed the teachers smiles had become fixed while the who school sang the school song, each with varying tones and times they sang. The song finally ended, as Dumbledore clapped the loudest.
Friday came, and Harry was able to get to the great hall without getting lost. He joined Draco and the rest of the Slytherin table for breakfast.
"Its fine, nobody really knows what house they'll be in. Me? I hope Slytherin. All my family have been in there. Just imagine being in Hufflepuff or even worse, Gryffindor! I'd just leave, wouldn't you?"
Harry then stood between Draco and Ron, "GUYS! Stop it! Look, Draco... What you said to Ron was totally uncalled for. Ron, I know you're mad about what he said.. But trying to fight before we've even made it to school? Look, Draco. Just apologize to Ron, please?"
As grateful as Harry was that Ron tried to calm him down, it was next to impossible with his nerves in overdrive. His eyes have been fixed on the door, waiting for McGonagall to come back and lead him to his doom.
"Back, Fang. Back." Hagrid opened the door and let them in. There was only one room with ham and pheasants hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle boiling on a open fire, and a bed with a patchwork quilt over it. Fang, the dog, was not as fierce as he looked as he started to lick Ron's ears.
Hermione got her breath back and bad temper, “You don’t use your eyes, do you? Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”
Ron rubbed the back of his neck, "Yeah, it's pretty cool. We.. Uh.. Thought you would've been sorted into it as well, though."
Draco looked at his hand and saw the ball was gone. He looked all around the ground, but could not find the ball. Ron was confused as well, but when he looked at Harry, Harry pulled out the Remembrall silently out of his pocket before putting it back in his pocket. Ron was stunned. When and how did Harry take it without either of them knowing? Ron was about to question Harry when Hooch came back and the class then went from fighting to back to paying attention.  When the lesson continued, it was clear to everyone that Harry was the best flyer. Everyone was a bit jealous on how good he was, especially for a first year. The lesson then ended, leaving Harry in high spirits.. Until he saw Ron and Draco fighting again.
Harry, Ron, and Draco went pale as they heard the petrified scream. They rushed in the bathroom to see Hermione shrinking against the opposite wall, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll knocked down all the stalls and most of the sinks as it advanced to her. Thinking quickly, Harry a piece of debris and shouted at Ron and Draco to distract it by throwing objects at it. The boys were throwing objects as hard as they could, but the troll barley noticed and started to raise its club to strike down at Hermione.
She said, "when I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted. Abbott, Hannah!"
The moment Harry dreaded came when McGonagall called his name, and he grew even more antsy when the students, both the first years and the older ones began whispering and muttering. Once Harry sat, the hat dropped over his eyes and he thankfully couldn't see the peoole craning to get a good look at him.
At last, the desserts disappeared and Dumbledore rose again. The hall fell silent as he spoke, "a few words now that we are all fed. The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Our caretaker, Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds, to everyone who does not wish a die a most painful death."
While Diagon Alley was definitely welcoming, Harry knew as soon as they stepped into Gringotts that this place isn't really one to joke around with, especially with Hagrid explaining how goblins aren't the most friendly of sorts. He and Hagrid then were on a very odd sort of track system as they went to Harry's vault. Once there, the goblin opened up the vault and Harry could not believe his eyes: His parents left him a small fortune! Once he gotten enough for his school supplies, Harry and Hagrid left Gringotts with Harry noting Hagrid looking slightly sickly. Harry entered the robe shop alone while Hagrid went back to the Leaky Cauldron for a pick-me-up.
As the boy sat, Harry noticed that he still had the black mark on his nose and snuck a look at his head, before looking outside the window.
Draco interrupted, "didn't you say you didn't care which house you got put in? I thought you'd fit in no matter what."
With that, she Began walking back to the Gryffindor Dormitory . As she walked, Ron just looked at Harry and Draco and simply said, “She really needs to sort out her priorities.” With that, he quickly joined Hermione. Harry and Draco had to agree with Ron and quickly made their way back to their Dormitory. Harry though, finally knew where that package Hagrid brought from that vault was now. He still just didn’t know what exactly it was.
Ron hissed, "Percy!" Ron pulled Harry and Draco behind a large stone Griffin. Peering around it, however, they didn't see Percy, but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.
Harry really didn't have any counter argument. The silence is what he needed. So far Slytherin DID seem like the worst house and the other houses seem better, but what if it wasn't? What if he gets into Slytherin? He did say to Draco that no matter what house he's in, he would try to fit in no matter what. Harry looked out the window, wondering where his place is in this world.
The other twin then said, "Oh, by the way, we didn't introduce, did we Harry? Fred and George Weasley. And this here is Ron. See you later then." The twins then left and Ron looked at Harry.
The boy's face softened up and actually had a soft smile, "Its alright. I get that. I'm Draco Malfoy, you?"
"Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick."
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?"
Harry tilted his head, "But won't the school eventually find it or even worse discover it at first?"
Now Harry had to know what was the problem the houses had with each other. Was it wizarding sports rivalry, or something deeper than that.
This made Harry pause and look down at his feet. While he didn't want to answer due to his fear that the boy might say something that will set him off, he didn't to appear rude.
Harry couldn't be more grateful to Ron if he had tried. As he told Ron how lost he was trying to find his next class which was Transfiguation, Ron told Harry that was his next class as well and he was lost as well. They spent a rather long time tying to find this bloody class before they ended up finding the right direction, however they were very late. They ran to Transfiguation class, hoping that McGonagall wasn't there. When they entered the class, the rest of the class was already hard at work writing down whatever the assignment is. Harry and Ron hurriedly walked in, relived that the professor wasn't there, but some cat on her desk.
Ron then began to explain, "well, Slytherin is where all the bad wizards go. Even You-Know-Who went there!"
Harry groaned as the class began to fight. He really wished his fellow Slytherins didn't act like this, trying to provoke the other students. Especially Gryffindor. As if things couldn't get worse, Ron marched to Draco, very mad.
The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. They heard Peeves and Filch argue, Peeves refusing to tell Filch anything and making fun of him for it. They then heard Filch curse and seemingly walk away. They also heard Peeves whooshing away. The first years finally gave a breath of relief.
Snape continued, "Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to NOT PAY ATTENTION."
The boy nodded, "Yeah, but I still can't believe why first years can't have their own. Perhaps I'll bully father into getting me one and smuggle it in somehow".
Harry sighed in relief as the two walked to the Great Hall for breakfast. Draco was boosting to Harry how good he was a flying and Harry just listened. Flying was the lesson he wss looking forward to the most. It seemed the most fun. Draco kept boosting to Harry as they entered the Hall, overhearing a small commotion over at the Gryffindor table.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," Began McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin".
They again ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked. They tried helplessly to open the door.
He finally slowed so Harry could keep up, “Why would I be? You seem to enjoy to be talking to your Griffindor friend, so why should I be”?
The Prefect then said, "Welcome to the Slytherin common room. Boys dormitoies to your left. Girls, to your right. As before, never share the password to anyone. The password changes frequently, so they will be posted on the notice board. Do travel in pairs, as the other houses aren't on good terms with us. Now, off to bed you lot."
The boats then moved all at once, gliding across the lake. Harry's eyes never left the castle as it drew nearer and nearer. He never heard Ron whisper "Wicked" in pure excitement. They were carried along a dark tunnel that seemed to be taking them along dark tunnel, which was underneath the castle. They then reached a underground harbor to which the boats stopped and they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. Hagrid then led them to a huge oak door.
As if Uncle Vernon's snide comment about having a good term at school and leaving him at this train station wasn't bad enough, Harry trying to find the bloody platform 9 3/4 was a nightmare. Even the train guard thought he was trying to be funny when Harry asked. He was about to give up when he heard..
Draco dropped the ball back on the Gryffindor table and said while scowling, "Just looking, professor." He then joined the rest of the Slytherin table. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and quietly said sorry to both Ron and Neville. As he joined the Slytherins, he started to grow concern about the fact that Ron ans Draco might push each other to the point and get into an actual physical fight and they might force him to choose who to side with. He made a mental note to talk to Draco and try to have him easy up on him picking on other people.
Harry read that the break in happened at July 31 and it was believed to be dark witches or wizards unknown. The goblins, however, insisted nothing was actually taken and the vault was emptied out earlier that day.
Ron whispered to Harry, "So we've just got to try that on! I'll kill Fred! He was going on about wrestling a troll."
Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt, "A test??? In front of the whole school? I don't know any magic... What on earth would we have to do?"
Harry then blushed and looked away, speaking lowly, "I WAS going to tell you back in the shop, y'know... Who's those two?"
Harry turned to see a family of 6 red hair people, the boys all with the same luggage as Harry. Harry then followed them as they stopped at a wall between 10 and 9.
Draco wanted to argue, but it was late enough already and all he wanted was to sleep. The next day, Harry, Ron, Draco, and Hermione bumped into each other while going for breakfast. There was a long, embarrassing silence before all 4 said ,"Thanks" quickly and ate at their tables. What they didn't expect, however, is that Hermione became friends with them. It seems that surviving dangers together does bring people closer together.
Harry just looked stumped as he caught Hermione's hand shoot up in the air from the corner of his eye. He just shook his head at Snape, unsure of what to say.
There was a loud "Ooooohh" as the path opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrents and towers.
McGonagall then returned to her desk as Harry and Ron both sat at the only empty desk. They were able to finish the rest of the class without much trouble. The next class was charms, to which was taught by a Professor Flitwick, a tiny Wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of his class he took roll call, and when he reach Harry's name, he gave a excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
Ron and to Harry's surprise, Hermione was with him, looking very cross. Draco, however, was very amused.
Hermione, on the other hand, just signed and said, “Oh move over!” She pulled her wand out from her robes and said, “
"You... Alright then." Ron then cleared his throat, "sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow". With a wave of his wand.... Nothing happened. Scabbers didn't even wake up.
The girl continued, "I've tried a few simple spells". She pulled out her wand and pointed it at Harry's glasses. "For example.
Ron nodded and the two boys left the castle and into the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forest. Harry knocked on the door, and they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several barks.
The feeling of annoyance slowly turned into embarrassment as the twins gawked at him. Harry began turning red when the call of their mother came to his rescue. The twins looked at Harry one last time and hopped off the train. With a sigh of relief, he sat down next to the window, half hiding himself. He then eavesdroped, sort of, on a conversation with the red haired family, mostly about how Fred and George not causing trouble, sending the sister a toilet seat, messing with the oldest brother Percy and something about being a prefect, and of course, meeting Harry Potter. The mother, however, came to his defense by saying he not something to be goggled at. After that, the boys then climbed on thr train and waved their goodbyes as the train began to depart.
Ron had to agree, "Yeah... I really can't talk too much. This here is named Scabbers." Ron pointed at the rat sleeping on his lap. He continued, "He might be dead and you wouldn't know the difference. I tried to turn him yellow with a spell, but it didn't work. Wanna see"?
Dumbledore, however, just simply bellowed, "SILENCE"! The students went silent and looked at Dumbledore. He then said, "Prefects, lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately."
"Us Slytherins stick together, Harry. You'll see. Now go to bed, for Merlin's sake. We have classes and I don't fancy being tired for them".
"Gryffindor, Mum and dad were in it. I guess the only house I wouldn't want to be in is Slytherin. Can you imagine if I was?"
"Oh, not to worry dear. All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between thw platforms. Best to get a running start if you're nervous. Go before Ron"
The boys walked to their side of the dormitory, and changed into their pyjamas without much talk, due to how tired they were and fell asleep rather quickly. Harry however, didn't. He kept staring at the ceiling, feeling uneasy. He didn't forget how quiet it was when he was sorted into Slytherin, or the whispers about him being in Slytherin was unexpected. The hat told him that he had traits of two rival houses, and he wondered what the second house was. Unless... Was it Gryffindor? Was he meant to be in Gryffindor? Harry sat up, thinking. He was lost in thoughts before a tired whisper made him break his train of thought.
Once breakfast was done, The Slytherin class was then joined by the Gryffindors outside for their flying lesson. The broomsticks were already lying on the ground besides the students. Then their teacher, Madam Hooch arrived. She had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk.
"UP!", everyone shouted. Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but he was one of th few that did. Hermione's broom just rolled over, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. And Ron's? His just hit him in the face, which caused Harry to laugh and get told to Shut up by Ron. Once all the class got their broomsticks in their hands, Hooch showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off and walked up and down the road correcting their grips. Ron seemed delighted that Draco had been doing it wrong for years.
The boy gave Harry an annoyed look and replied, "Yes exactly. He's a bit of a savage, isn't he? Living in a hut on the school grounds, getting drunk and setting his bed on fire.
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor, and Harry could hear the drones of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right. The rest of the school must be here already. McGonagall then showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. The children crowded in, standing rather closer than they would've done.
Hagrid just simply pointed, "Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard bank. Ain't no safer place besides Hogwarts."
"It's a Remembrall! Gran knows I forget things..". Neville's face fell when the Remembrall then was filled with red smoke. Neville seemed to have forgotten something. As he tried to remember what it was, Draco then snatched the ball out of his hand. Ron jumped to his feet, half hoping for a reason to fight Draco and Harry was more than prepared to jump between them. Professor McGonagall, however was able to spot trouble faster than any other teacher, was there in a flash.
Hermione didn't show up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. Draco and Harry and the rest of the Slytherin joined the other houses in the Great Hall for the Halloween feast. Harry noticed that Hermione wasn't in with the Gryffindor group and when asked, Ron told him he overheard that she was crying in the bathroom. And even though he tried to hide it, Ron was ashamed of himself for making her cry. Once they entered the great Hall, the Halloween decorations put her out of the boys minds. The students were enjoying the Halloween feast when Quirrell came sprinting into the Hall with a terrified look on his face.
Harry looked out the windows and watched as the houses flash by, excitement rising in him, as he wondered what he would do, but it would be better than what he had. It was then his compartment door slid open that pulled him from his thoughts. Harry turned to see the youngest red haired boy from the family peak his head in.
"Stop, Stop. You're going to take someone's eye out". Snapped Hermione. "Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's
The boy just stared at Harry, "You don't know what Quidditch is??? It's the best sport in the wizarding world! If I ever get a chance to play Quidditch, I hope it's with the house I'm in. It'll be a crime if I'm not. Know what house you'll be in?"
Draco looked at Hermione as if she was mad, “We weren’t looking at its feet! It’s heads took up more of our attention, or maybe you didn’t notice THREE of it?”
Ron, now starting to get annoyed, just said, "We've already told him we haven't seen it". This fell on deaf ears as the girl was looking at the wand in his hand.
The three boys looked at each other, hoping the other would be the one who could explain this without being in any trouble. Then, out of left field, Hermione spoke up, "It was my fault Professor. They were looking for me. I went looking for the troll myself. I read all about them. If Harry, Ron, and Draco hadn't found me... I'd probably be dead..".
Harry looked and saw Hagrid, who was holding two large ice creams, which made Harry smile and say, "That's Hagrid, he works at Hogwarts.
Now Harry was getting a bit angry with this boy. Sure, the boy wasn't too bad at first besides some of the things he said, but now this was getting out of hand.
Said Ron, walking with Harry and Draco, making them laugh. "She's a nightmare, honestly. It's no wonder why she doesn't have any friends."
Harry was shocked at this. He looked at Ron and Draco who both looked like they were about ready to fight. Before Harry could do anything to try to calm the situation down, Ron got up.
Harry then said, “Well, maybe if the two of you didn’t challenge each other to a wizard’s duel, we wouldn’t be in this mess!”
"You don't know? Well. Let's try again. Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a Bezoar?"
Harry did have to admit, having Draco here did make him feel better and not as alone. But he still had some reservations about his sorting.
Ron looked at Harry as if he had another head, "Are you mad?! The Malfoys are the worst! Their whole family were dark wizards! You really shouldn't hang around him, he might corrupt you!"
Harry began to ponder and go back to what Draco had said about him wanting to go to Slytherin. He definitely didn't want Draco to go to Slytherin if that ment he'd lose a friend. Maybe not everyone who goes to Slytherin is bad? Before Harry had a chance to ask Ron about Gryffindor, the door slid open AGAIN.
Harry had never seen such strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that floated midair over four long table, where the rest of the students sat. The tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where sitting, to which McGonagall led the first years up there. Harry heard Hermione whisper "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History".
Harry's glasses suddenly where fixed, much to Harry's surprise and gratitude. Realization came to the girl and she said, "Holt Cricket! You're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger". Hermione then turned to Ron who was still stuffing his face with candy, "and you are?"
Harry felt nervous as he entered the shop alone, but thankfully he didn't have to wait long as the shop keeper, Madam Malkin, noticed him.
Some people laughed, mainly from the Gryffindors, much to Harry's horror, as he wasn't trying to be funny.
They crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. Harry wondered why Snape was going into the 3rd floor, but hearing a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet made him, Draco, and Ron turn their attention to the troll, who was making its way into the girls' bathroom.
"Think my name is funny, do you? Potter doesn't need to tell me your name. Red hair, and hand-me-down clothes? You must be a Weasley. More children than they can afford."
As if on cue, the cat leapt from the desk and transformed into McGonagall, shocking the two boys. She looked at them with her signature stern expression.
The Gryffindor students were trying to tell Neville that they weren't supposed to take off yet and Hooch was trying to calm Neville down before he could get any higher. This didn't work as he rose twelve feet-- twenty feet. Neville was begging his broom to go back down as the broom then was spinning him around. It then was able to to spin him off and make him fall off with a nasty thud and crack as he laid facedown on the grass. Hooch ran to Neville, and her face is as white as Neville's was.
The student said, "Oh, that's Professor Snape. Our head of house. He teaches Potions, but everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after Quirrell's job for years."
Peeves just cackled, “Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty.”
A sudden rummaging for parchment and quills began as Snape said over the noise, "A point from Slytherin for your classmate's cheek."
Harry then said, "What if the house made a mistake? You saw the looks the rest of the school gave me."
The Slytherin first years followed their Prefect through the crowd and out of the great hall and down a flight of stairs. The Slytherins were led down to what looked like a dark dungeon.
"Hey... Maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I'm just.. Nervous about all of this. I really don't fancy making a bad impression of myself, y'know?"
Ron then said, "Made it! Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if she knew we were late?"
"Don't the three of you care about your hoises?", said Hermione. She then looked at Harry, who still would rather be in bed, and said, "I thought you would be the one who would talk Malfoy out of this."
Harry walked up to them, again ready to split them apart if need be. They seemed not to notice him as they continued.
"Oh, oh, oh dear. Broken wrist. Come on. Up you get". Hooch gently picked up a whimpering Neville, making sure she didn't hurt his already broken wrist even more. She then spoke to the class, "Everyone is to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing. If I catch a signal broomstick in the air, the one riding it will be thrown out of Hogwarts before they can say Quidditch."
“I... AM AN EOD AGENT. EPP IT UP.” I found my old Xbox that still works and I’ve been playing true crime streets of LA xD
Hermione glared at Ron and simply rolled up her sleeves and spoke the incantation. She made her feather float every easily. Ron was in a very fowl mood after the class was over.
Ron agreed to this and went off to join the other Gryffindors. Harry really couldn't believe his "Luck" sometimes. He tries to defuse a situation and another one comes up.
Harry couldn't help but feel some of this was his fault. True, he didn't want his friends to fight in the first place, but he didn't necessarily talk Draco out of it.
"Anything!" Shouted Harry, as he dodged another club swing. Thinking quickly, Ron pulled out his and pointed it the club. With encouragement from Hermione and Draco, Ron was able to levitate the club from the troll's hand. The troll was stunned to see the club not in his hand when it tried to swing at Harry once again. It dropped Harry, who scrambled to put some distance and watched with the other three as the troll looked up at its club and watched it fall on its head. The troll wobbled a bit, and fell down.
