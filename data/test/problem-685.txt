“Mom!” Scorpius comes running back and throws himself in Draco’s lap. “Grandpa and I fed the peacocks. I-,” He notices Potter and his eyes widen. He quickly scrambles and sits himself tucked into Draco’s side, eyeing Potter out of the corner of his eye.
Draco runs his hand through Scorp’s blonde locks affectionately. “Sorry. Scorpius is shy around strangers.”
He’s suddenly self conscious about his appearance. He’s thrown on a black fitted turtle neck and a pair of light gray chinos. His hair is in slight disarray – due to Scorpius throwing a minor tantrum before he left – and he’s wearing a simple pair of black and white Chuck Taylors. He tosses the magazine to the side table and stands to his feet smoothing out his turtle neck before extending a hand. “It’s good to see you again. It’s been awhile, hasn’t it?”
It’s about a fifteen minute walk from Draco’s flat to the park they’re going to. Teddy and Scorpius are walking side by side, the older boy bent down talking animatedly to the small blonde. Draco insisted on beanie and gloves for the both of them.
“Uh-huh,” He can practically see Scorpius nodding. “They will. They keep him warm. Grandma and Grandpa say his heart is too cold… it’s-,”
“Scorpius told me to make sure to hug you this morning.” He murmurs, lips brushing against Draco’s shoulder blade. “He says it’s a matter of life or death.” There’s no humor when he says it and Draco is so scared that he
.” He says the last word breathlessly and it has Draco’s heart thudding against his chest. “He’s so ruddy brilliant it’s unfair, he’s so kind and gentle, but he’s strong too.”
“It’s okay. Mom just needs to get warmed up.” He puts his small hand in Draco’s and winces slightly at the freezing temperature. Draco tries to withdraw but Scorpius gives him a hard look and fuck does Draco wish he could blame that look on someone other than himself. He lets his son lead him to the fire and once he’s close enough to the flames, he feels himself start to warm. When his limbs reawaken, he scoops up Scorpius and holds him on his hip, the small child wrapping his arms tightly around his neck.
Draco huffs and sinks into the couch. “Just get me whatever you’re having and fill me in on what’s going on in this plotless, mildly horrifying cartoon Christmas movie.”
“Touch him again and I won’t bother using a spell. I’ll transfigure into a fucking wolf and tear you limb from limb.”
“Oh, ‘Mione. It isn’t like that.” He reaches out and gives her a tentative pat on the shoulder. When she doesn’t bite his head off, he takes a step forward and envelopes her in a gentle hug. “I was just helping Malfoy out, okay?”
“I know something is up, Draco.” The blonde nearly snaps his neck and drops his French fry back on the plate. Harry brings his fourth beer to his lips, and that’s when Draco notices his slightly flushed cheeks, his body languid and relaxed with alcohol. “There’s something you’re not telling me. They didn’t just make me Head Auror because I defeated Voldemort, Draco. I’m actually very good at what I do.” He chugs the last of his beer and places it on the coffee table in front of him. “You really think I wouldn’t notice that you’re always cold – almost hypothermic, and that I wouldn’t circle back to the day you nearly fainted in Diagon Alley?”
He winces as he straightens up. “It’s nothing. Really, it’s nothing. I need to,” He takes a deep breath. “I need to go back to the manor.” He’s suddenly aware of Potter’s grip on his bicep. “I need to apparate-,”
Draco’s heart is thudding in his chest, the feeling raw and uncomfortable because this is exactly why he froze it over in the first place. His skin feels eerily cold and he hopes to any higher power that he doesn’t pass out in front of McLaggen. He’d rather die than let the boring bloke play hero for him.
“-of course, I could have played professionally. But, I find that the real money comes in sports management. Besides,” Cormac leans forward and gestures to his face. “Wouldn’t want to take a bludger to this beauty now would we?” Draco inwardly groans. Merlin, how long have they been here? He glances at his watch. Only an hour! Thank Merlin it’s almost nightfall. As if sensing his thoughts Cormac glances at his own watch. “Blimey! Already six, is it? It’ll be dark soon. We really should get going.” He stands to his feet and stretches out his limbs.
Scorpius gives him a proud look. “Because he does mom things.” He holds out his hand to count them off. “He tucks me in at night and reads me stories, he kisses my owies, he fixes my hair and makes me wear fancy clothes, he gives me snacks and he gives me baths… and he’s pretty.”
Draco can feel the heat rise to his cheek and he clears his throat heading down the hall. He stops at the door and clears his throat. He straightens out his black knitted V neck jumper with a cream and maroon colored border around the neck and bottom. He’s wearing blue grid chinos and all black trainers. Blaise’s melodious voice filters in from the other side of the door. “Come in.” He calls gently.
She raises a perfectly plucked eyebrow. “Honestly Draco, I’ve perfected lying to the opposite sex and I can tell that you’re lying to me. So tell me what happened.” Draco looks down at his hands folded in his lap. “The way Blaise says it, he wanted to get back together with you and you said no.”
He feels a weight lifted off his chest and even though the intimate touches – last night, the hug – Harry’s closeness is really fucking confusing… if Draco is going to die in two weeks, he’s going to enjoy what he can from Boy Wonder while he can. Harry drops his hands from his shoulders and Draco turns to stir his coffee before grabbing it in both hands. When he turns around, he nearly drops it because suddenly Harry is right there. Hands on either side of Draco’s hips on the counter, his body pressed so close to Draco’s, they’re barely a breath away. “I’ve got one more issue with you.”
The walls are painted a stone gray and besides a few black filing cabinets, the black desk he’s sitting on and one black waiting chair the office is cold and uninviting. “Nice office…” He mutters against the rim of his disposable coffee cup.
“Say, Draco?” He looks over at Cormac. The broader man is giving him an appraising look and he plasters on what Draco imagines he intends to be a sultry look. “Fancy grabbing dinner?”
Harry’s heart is beating in his throat and hugs Scorpius close to his chest. “I believe you, Scorp.” He plants a soft reassuring kiss to his head. “I’m going to find your mom. I promise.”
A mental picture of a young Malfoy pops in his head and he blushes. “Yeah, sometimes I miss it, and sometimes-,” He holds his beer, poised at his lips and a mental picture of kissing Draco Malfoy sitting by the lake pops into his head and he smiles. “-sometimes I wish I had done things differently.”
He smirks and the line cuts out, Draco’s heart warming with affection. He starts for the kitchen and then stutters to a halt. His chest has never felt this way. He genuinely feels…
“Are you kidding?!” He stands up and begins pacing the room, running his hand through his hair. “How can you say that? He was so terrible to you – to Ron – to everyone-,”
Harry bumps his nose with Draco’s and steps away, giving him a quick scan. “There. You look so much better in something Gryffindor.”
He hears a trollish groan on Pansy’s side of the phone before Goyle appears behind her, not wearing a shirt – mind you – hair sticking up on one side. “Merlin, I can’t wait until the two of you start fucking. You guys are ridiculous.” He studies Harry a moment and adds, “Wear that leather jacket you wore a few weeks ago for your interview in the Quibbler. He practically drooled on the fucking magazine.”
They learned right off the bat that the more physical contact Draco had, the warmer he felt. He gives Scorp a grateful kiss on the side of his head and smiles at Harry, readjusting his son on his hip. “Hello Harry.” Harry seems to want to press on what happened, but he shifts his gaze to the boy standing beside him. “And you must be Teddy.” He holds out his hand. “Draco Malfoy. Pleasure to meet you cousin.”
Dean and Seamus shift uncomfortably in their seats, casting each other furtive glances and Harry ignores it, pulling out his phone again.
my weekend.” He places his elbows on the table and folds his hands together. “Of course, you know that.” He winks.
Draco can’t break anymore than he already has. He drinks the small bottle in one gulp. Draco Lucius Malfoy freezes his heart from everyone around him.
It takes a good half hour for Draco to feel a little more confident, only slipping occasionally. The breeze bites at his nose and ears, but Draco still feels happy and warm beside Potter. He’s skating freely now, and Harry’s arm is at his side, no longer worried about Draco falling – although he nearly does when he realizes that their hands are interlaced and they’ve skated a few rounds around the rink. His cheeks dust pink and he decides not to say anything. A moment of silence lapses and he watches Scorpius let go of Teddy’s hand and begin skating on his own.
Her eyes widen slightly, recognition dawning her features when she catches his eye. “I have not. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter.” She shakes his hand and gives him a kind smile. “Draco, run along and have lunch now, dear. I’ve got it from here.” She winks at the blonde. “Looks to me like you’ve got a snack to get to.”
She shrugs and looks away. “You were still trying to piece yourself back together, and we didn’t want to say anything to remind you of – well everything.” He sits back on the couch trying to process her words. “Harry, he sent me a gift – that knitted blanket that Rose always has a death grip on. And just the other day well… I-I guess you mentioned something to him about how I’m still feeling ill and he concocted a morning sickness potion - it’s why I feel so much better.” There’s a long drawn out pause before she adds, “I’m just saying. Draco really is different. It wouldn’t be impossible for you to fall in love with him. And it’s unfair to say you haven’t known each other long enough. I mean - you’ve been obsessed with each other for over a decade.”
“He’s alright.” Harry runs a thumb underneath Draco’s eye. “He’s with Hermione at my place. He’s safe. I promise. I will never let anything happen to him, Draco. Or you-,” He pulls Draco closer to him. “I’m going to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
after this one is born.” Harry chuckles affectionately, glancing at the clock above his fireplace for the fifth time. “You know, if you’d like me to leave, you can just tell me. You have somewhere to be?” She asks coyly.
He starts down the stairs, running a hand through his slightly damp hair. Shit, Scorpius is gonna be so disappointed when he explains how horrible his date went.
Lucius swoops him up and puts him on his hip. “Good boy, Scorp. Let’s let mom talk to the doctor. How about we get some coffee for him, hm?”
Harry just rolls his eyes and takes a bite out of his donut, following Blaise into his office. “Exactly,” He starts with his mouthful. “Which means I should know what I’m talking about when I say Ireland is a better team.”
“No. I’m Harry fucking Potter, Head Auror and you’re under arrest.” There’s a loud crash of spells and Draco hears two bodies drop to the cement. He opens his eyes, his vision blurry in the streetlight be he registers someone dropping heavily to their knees beside him. “Ron. I need you to summon some men from the office to pick up these two criminals. I’ll fill you in as soon as possible. I’ll send you the location.” A hand touches his shoulder and Draco curls in on himself. “Shhh, Draco. It’s okay. It’s me, it’s Harry.” Draco tries again to open his eyes and abruptly shuts them to block out the streetlight. “Shit. Hang on, let me fix you up as best as I can and we’ll take you to St. Mungo’s.” There’s a hand on his face and a quick hiss. “
The boys burst into a fit of laughter and Draco feels himself warm at his son’s smile. Harry clear his throat and gestures to the front door. “Shall we?”
Potter rises with him and shoots him a small smile. “I never thought I’d say this, but,” He gives Draco an indecipherable look. “I had fun today, Malfoy. Can we – can we maybe do this again?”
He takes a deep breath before glancing at the address. He was surprised when Malfoy sent it to him at how close it was to Grimmuald place. He exits the building, the spell wards popping up and hiding its location. He starts the short walk, just a few blocks away.
He winces down in pain, the hard cement floor digging into his skin. Fuck, Scorpius. He feebly reaches for the cuff around his wrist and pulls it to his chest. He’s leaving his son fatherless, but maybe it’s better this way. He shivers and his body drops ten degrees again.
Draco turns away. His eyes straying to the window above the sink overlooking the albino peacocks. He can’t deny the tug in his gut for Potter. The man is ridiculously handsome… kind… generous… he puts so much effort into Scorpius. A small twinge of hope blossoms and he thinks that maybe – just maybe Harry
He looks down at his tiny chubby hands squeezing Harry’s index fingers. “My mom says you’re a hero… that you’re a really good person. He says you were a good person when he was – he was a bad one.” He looks up at Harry again. “People hurt my mom some times.” He scowls – a look that is so Malfoy. “They even pretend to like him before they hurt him…” His eyes water and he buries his face in Harry’s arm. “Please don’t do that to my mom.” His voice breaks and he squeezes onto Harry tighter.
Draco often wonders how he gets himself into these situations. He likes to think that despite the war, he’s been a good man, a good father, a good friend, a good citizen. He takes another blow to the face and his head spins all over again.
Scorpius gives him a serious look and brings a hand to his forehead in a solute. “Aye Aye Captain Mom!” He glances at Harry and gives him a little nudge with his elbow. “You gotsa do it to!” He says out of the corner of his mouth.
,” Draco said, dragging Harry with him, “let’s see our room and if the bed is suitable for our needs.”
“I’ll show you casual, Potter,” Draco sneers behind him. “I’ll fuck you so un-casually that you’ll forget that tart ever existed.”
He stills, stroking the hair out of your face and tilting your chin up to make you look at him, blinking.
Nüwa said while Malfoy rose as well. Potter smiled at him and reached his hand out to stroke Malfoy’s arm soothingly.
Tonight for instance, I found him in the kitchen, slumped over the table with a cup of warm milk still clutched in his hand. I didn’t want to wake him so I had to carefully carry him back to his room. I didn’t levitate him because if he’d woken up I think it would’ve reminded him of
You get up, tasting blood in your mouth, and stumble out through the door, catching a glimpse of someone rounding the corner further down the corridor. You hope that whoever it was didn’t hear what was said between you, or Harry’s safety will be jeopardised.
“It’s a Muggle video game,” Harry tried to explain. “It’s… It must’ve been weeks ago, months maybe. We passed a Muggle second-hand store and I saw this and I… I made some throwaway comment about how Dudley used to have one of these but I was never allowed to play.” He stroked his thumb over the white letters forming the words “Mega Drive SEGA”, while memories of how he’d desperately wanted to play resurfaced in his mind. This console, like so many others before and after it, had not lasted long in the Dursley household. Before Harry had had any chance at trying it out, Dudley had stomped on it after the umpteenth attempt of getting past Dr. Eggman in the Oil Ocean Zone.
“It’s fine, you get used to it, working at a place like this,” the wizard said, smiling even brighter. “Love is in the air!”
I can’t stress enough how lucky I am to have him as a friend now. It still feels a bit strange that my former school nemesis (oh come on, past Harry, what eleven year old boy has a
“And did it work?” Draco pants, snapping Harry back to reality. His smugness is back, but he also obviously wants to know.
She rolled her eyes. Really, humans were so stiff sometimes, rigid in their way of thinking. Even if she told him, she doubted he’d understand that she’d been so bored that now she absolutely
On Whit Sunday, the Prior asks you for a private word in his study. He looks at you serenely over his spectacles, but you get the feeling there is a grim reason he wanted to speak with you, because he looks like a snake ready to attack.
When we were in school, he probably would’ve thought I loved this kind of attention, but since we became flatmates he’s learned to read me better I think, and he was actually the one who offered to help me with the interviews and official statements a few months ago.
“What the fuck!” Harry shouted once back in the confines of their room. “Obedience training through bond legilimency? Are you kidding me?”
And there are so many things Harry wants to ask, so many things he needs to understand, but for now it’s enough that Draco is lying next to him, steadily getting stronger underneath Harry’s hands and his breathing getting steadier. They have time, he thinks as Draco presses himself impossibly closer. They have so much time now.
). It feels nice, it’s cooling him off slightly, but it’s not helping his swirling mind, nor the heat in his body.
Harry gives him a quick kiss before he leaves, pausing a bit because Draco tastes sweet and heavy, like… like flowers.
A week later, Harry was accompanied by Ron and Hermione to the Marathon, as well as loads of reporters who wanted to document every single step of the way, a “perk” he had to endure since he was the defending champion of the race. Ron tried to calm him down by making jokes at the expense of the nosiest reporters, while Hermione took the lead and wove her way through the crowd to where Harry’s group was supposed to start. Reluctantly, Harry waved them off when they got there, but luckily, the reporters weren’t allowed in here either, and Harry took the opportunity to close his eyes and try to find his focus, to try to conjure a mental image of running with calm, deliberate steps and measured breathing.
Fortunately that got Harry’s attention and he cast several detection spells around the room. The floor immediately began to thrum under their feet, and the couple, already back at their lovemaking, appeared to be enjoying it. Thoroughly.
You walk carefully in the dark for a while, feeling your way ahead, not daring to light the torch you’ve brought for fear that someone will see it from the monastery. It takes you longer than usual to reach the spot where you know you’re not in the line of sight anymore, but when you finally do you take out your firestriker and start hitting it against the stone you brought. The flame of the torch is a comfort: as long as you have it you’ll know where you are and where you’re heading, and you’ll be able to scare off wild animals. At least you hope you will.
The bell above the door jingles merrily as Harry walks into their usual café with a groan. “Fuck, this day has been a complete nightmare,” he sighs, slumping into one of the seats. “Please remind me why I decided that opening a broom shop was a good idea.”
You’ve particularly fallen for tending the gardens. It’s become your own solace, watching the seeds sprout and grow into plants, digging up the earth, and watering the soil so it can blossom and nourish new life. It’s comforting in a way that you haven’t known before. You let yourself believe that the touch of the tiny leaves is the touch of another human being, your skin so depraved of contact that you can easily envision someone stroking your neck as you stretch to reach the top shelf and the lavender tickles you behind your ear. And sometimes, sometimes, when you’re alone and no one is watching, you let your hands wander over your own skin, tickling the fair hairs on your forearms, let your palm rest on your cheek and warm it, and imagine it’s the touch of another human, of someone you could love.
- like this. At least not without retaliation. He narrowed his eyes at Malfoy, who was strutting out of the kitchen and onto the patio, hips swaying as he went.
Harry doesn’t know why he’s disappointed. This was what he expected, after all. “Right, I forgot I’m with Mr Heaven-forbid-I’d-let-my-casually-exclusive-fuckbuddy-stay-over. So sorry for forgetting.” Out of anger he gets up quicker than he means to and his head spins a bit before he gets the dizziness under control so he can start getting dressed.
Harry nods slowly, feigning agreement. Luna has no idea what she’s talking about. There’s no way Harry would come out unscathed if he told Draco he’d be interested in anything more than being fuckbuddies, or even hint at it. He’s not even sure that’s what
“The two of you… you had something. Something special,” Matthew continues, tentatively. “And I don’t care — I mean I will not judge you if you did… something you shouldn’t have, but regardless, I… I could feel you were connected. Deeply. On a spiritual level.”
“What took you so long? I don’t care about your situation, you still have to do your jobs. Now, debrief me and make it quick. I have to present to the board in 2 hours.”
have you rip them off with your teeth”), after Draco had straddled his hips and taken them both in hand, after they had both come all over Harry’s stomach and after Harry had marvelled at seeing Draco’s breath stuttering as he reached his peak, when they were lying together naked and spent, Harry laughed quietly to himself while drawing patterns on Draco’s back with his fingers, making Draco look up at him.
I suggested we try Backgammon again but Draco just sniffed and told me it was an uncouth form of socialising, and then went back to reading his latest book for
“Fuck, yes,” Harry whispers into the sheets, and then he arches his back on a moan because Draco is rubbing his cock along his crack, nudging slightly at his hole. He’s not prepared, not even with a spell, but he doesn’t want to ask for it. He likes Draco claiming him like this, and the tiny part of him that is still conscious files the information that Draco is quite possessive away for future reference. Maybe he can use this later, to goad Draco into fucking him rougher. Maybe he can use it now?
The door to the bathroom opened and Harry’s jaw dropped, because out stepped Malfoy in a cloud of vapour, skin still damp from the shower, and with a towel wrapped around his waist. Harry choked as Malfoy let out a little sigh of contentment and flicked his hair, little droplets of water hitting Harry on the face. Suddenly, Harry’s trousers felt tight, and he sensed heat rising up on his neck, probably caused by the steam from the shower. He cleared his throat and Malfoy turned to him, looking surprised.
Harry shifted on the rock, reaching out as if to take Draco’s hand, but drew back again. “That’s a cruel thing to do, don’t you think?”
He shot up from his seat, ignored the startled outcries from the others, wrenched free of Granger trying to take hold of his arm, then promptly stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind him.
“I think my students are an excellent example of people moving on after the war, putting old prejudices behind them, and working for a new and better world. They don’t care what you did when you were their age, they care what you do now.” Harry brushed his lips against Draco’s cheek, it tickled when he spoke again, but the words warmed Draco like melted honey. “And the best thing you do now is make me a very happy husband, which makes me a better professor for them.”
“You should be acting like a man who can’t keep his hands off of the object of his desires.” Harry’s breath tickled the back of Draco’s neck, and the shiver went straight to his cock. Harry’s hand traced its way around the side of Draco’s back and came to rest on his hip, gripping it tight through the layers of fabric.
And this thing they have, even without the emotional intimacy, is still amazing, Harry thinks as Draco caresses his clothes off, kissing every inch of his skin. It’s like they know instinctively how the other wants it, they’re so in tune with each other in a way that Harry has never experienced.
“Yes, well, I’m terribly sorry but I’m afraid I’ve remembered I have places to be now,” Draco repeats, and he’s almost able to hide the way his voice trembles, but Harry hears, and he wants to make it better, but he feels rejected and shut out.
He got up and started to look for his wand. He must’ve dropped it at some point in the frenzy of undressing each other yesterday. But before he found it, there was a loud knock on the door to Draco’s rooms.
“Stop crowding me, Malfoy!” Harry snapped, planting his feet firmer into the ground and bracing himself to keep from falling over as Malfoy pressed the entire length of his body against Harry’s.
“At least we won’t have to rush inside if it starts to rain!” Ebba said with a laugh, beckoning them to sit down and help themselves.
Draco freezes, and for once the air caught in his lungs is not because there’s no room for it. “You told them?”
“Although I assume I’ll be wearing the clothes I’ll pass away in, are you sure you want a ghost dressed in a hospital gown following you around?”
Harry didn’t answer, he was too busy trying to hide the way his cock had swelled while witnessing Malfoy’s little show. What the fuck was wrong with him?
And now, here he was, standing with his pressed linen trousers, entirely out of place among all the surfing shorts and tank tops, and apparently he was supposed to share a room with
“That night, at Luna’s art opening, I thought… I thought you did it to mock me. And that’s why I ran away.”
It takes Draco a few moments to draw enough air to say anything, to even be able to take control of his vocal chords. “I do believe that was one the rules we stated, yes,” he forces out.
It was so beautiful, and even though it had a happy ending the tune was a bit sad and I could somehow
“Well, according to the tests and the diagnostic spells we ran, this is a rare case of the Hanahaki Disease where the infatuation has roots too deep to be operated on. I’m afraid that if we proceed with surgery, you run an extremely high risk of not surviving the operation.”
Sheila Allen heaved a deep sigh and pinched the bridge of her nose. This was unbearable. She was too fucking old for this shit. She was too fucking
Lilies. Fucking lilies again. If he didn’t hurt so much he’d scoff at them, because the symbolism is honestly getting a little tiresome.
The next day he’s a little more spirited when you arrive, his skin a more lively colour instead of tinted grey. Your fingers tremble when you untie his undertunic at the collar to take off the wrappings and check his wounds, but his eyes are closed, so you hope that he doesn’t notice.
“I er… I asked Ron and Hermione about… about that thing… when you cough up flowers?” he says eventually.
“So,” Draco said, his voice a higher pitch than usual and he cleared his throat. “Sorry. Strutty’s missing, and I’m guessing you want us to help you search for him?”
Noticing Harry’s reverie, Draco’s eyes soften, his features smoothing out. He strokes Harry’s hair gently, his fingers catching on some of the strands, but it feels good, it’s grounding, and Harry leans into his touch as Draco’s hand travels down to cup his cheek.
Draco nods and starts by trying to get his arm out, but when he shifts it only makes Harry latch on tighter to him, and he looks up at Goodwin with fond exasperation. Normally he’d be embarrassed to have this intimate moment play out in front of another person, who he doesn’t even know that well, but he finds it hard to care when he’s so thoroughly pleased.
I have to say it feels a bit weird to write into the void, but I’m getting used to it. It’s also comforting in a way I guess, to write to no one in particular. So once again, Hermione was right. I’ll never tell her though, she doesn’t need to get more smug than she already is.
You’re out in the garden shed the first time it happens. It’s innocent enough: you’re stowing away rakes and shovels after the day’s work, the worn down wood smooth against your blistered hand, and you can feel how it’s still warm from his hand holding it. Then, when you step up on a stool to hang up the spades, you lose your balance and you tumble backwards, arms flailing to try to hold onto something to keep from falling. And then he’s there, his strong arms catching you, and your stomach drops out for entirely different reasons. You don’t dare turn around, you know your eyes would betray you if you did, and yet, he’s still holding you, even though you’ve planted your feet on the ground and you’re no longer in any danger of falling.
It does hurt, a bit, but in a good way, in a way that sends sparks of desire through your entire body. The stretch as he’s edging himself inside you, bit by bit, the way your body opens up for him, willingly taking the entire length of him in, the way you have to bite your fist to keep from screaming out, afraid that if you do he’ll stop this slow enjoyable torture.
“Well, you have to confront him about it then,” Hermione said, shaking Harry out of his thoughts. “He should at least have the decency to throw up some privacy charms; even a
“That depends on what you mean by “waited”. As far as you’ve told us, Mr Malfoy, your symptoms started getting very severe about a month ago?”
Harry was sitting on the sofa, reading up on spell damage and the proper diagnostic procedures for it. It had been a long day, he had just started a new intense course and he was knackered, but he still needed to read for tomorrow’s test.
The first time it happens it takes Draco completely by surprise, if he’d even dare to admit what’s going on.
“Well I… At the Manor… And now… I mean…” He’d never been expected to learn how to cook. He’d been expected to live at the Manor for the rest of his life, inheriting the house elves and never having to cook for himself. And when he’d decided to move into his own apartment with Pansy, she had done most of the cooking, while he had resorted to pay for takeout.
Harry looks around, startled. “Ginny! Hi! I was, er… I was on a date actually, sort of,” he says, scratching his neck. He’s not keen on opening up this particular can of worms by telling Ginny who this date was with.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but just then, a new song started, and Ebba grabbed Harry and Draco’s hands.
himself. She didn’t know much about the mating habits of humans, but she got the distinct impression that his behaviour had something to do with it, because his hands, that were folded neatly onto the table top, tensed slightly at Potter’s words, his thighs pressing together faintly.
Harry stared at him, horrified. “You wish, Malfoy,” he hissed, ignoring the look of hurt that flickered across Malfoy’s face at his words. He grabbed his water bottle and squeezed past Ms Allen, thinking that he couldn’t get away from there fast enough.
“Can you tell me about yourself, Draco?” he asks, startling you from your examination of the cuts on his shoulder.
“I wasn’t —” he starts, but stops when he looks at you. “Yes, I was, I was listening because I knew it had to have something to do with us. And I heard my name, and —”
Draco sighs, and even though Harry can’t see it he knows Draco is rolling his eyes. “Yes, Harry, I’ll marry you so you can keep fucking this glorious arse of mine. Once in a while.”
“How can you come in here for less than twenty minutes, eat only appetizers, and then leave for the night? I don’t think I’ve seen that couple come in for breakfast either.”
“Of course we’re fucking having this conversation now! Or do you have another suggestion for passing the time?” Harry says irritably. He draws a few calming breaths before continuing. “Why didn’t you tell me it was your first time?”
Tears start sliding down his cheeks and he lets them come. He knows he should stop talking but he can’t, it’s like the dams have been opened and every frustrated feeling he’s ever had about Draco and their relationship and the end drawing near comes welling out of him. He lets his head fall forwards to hide his face, because he can’t bear to see the pity Draco must feel for Harry right now.
“Granger, Weasley, I was unaware you had graced us with your presence,” Malfoy said, quickly regaining his usual haughty tones.
“Hi, er…” Potter says, scratching his neck and Draco refuses to admit he finds it adorable. “Ginny told me that you were here, and… I was… I wanted to…” He sighs. “Can I come in?”
Harry growled, kissing Draco hard while he started walking him back to the bed, unbuttoning his shirt.
He knew it was the raw magic and emotion from the process spilling over, but he felt as if he’d been slapped, and he shouted, “I’m trying to help! Do you think this is fun for me? It’s not. But I’m trying to help catch those bastards too. I’m sorry I’m the unspeakable with the right training and family history to pose as the awful fucking person that would drug a person in order to force a bond. But I am.”
He turned around and bolted for the door, but with the reflexes of a seeker, Harry apparated into the hallway, right in front of the stairs.
I think it was the nightmares that brought us together. Sometimes we’d find ourselves in the kitchen at the same time, drinking tea to soothe our nerves after a particularly bad dream. We never mentioned it, because it wasn’t needed, we just…
Just like when he had the latest attack, there’s some sort of calm settling over him. Now that he’s nearing the end, it’s like there are few things that matter now.
Draco lifts his head to look at him, his lips swollen and shiny, eyes blown so wide with lust they’re almost black. He scoots up and lets his mouth glide along Harry’s lower lip, fingers grazing over his rapidly beating pulse.
It was a bit awkward again after, but then he chuckled and told me it was nice and that maybe we could do it again sometime, what would the harm be? And I agreed, because we’re both single, we’re both horny, and we both know that this won’t lead anywhere because we’re both straight, but why not give a friend a helping hand? (Pun definitely intended.)
If she could have scoffed, she would have. Instead, she uncoiled her body and slowly slithered over the table towards the other man, who startled and said something to Potter, that sounded like he was asking what was happening. He drew himself backwards on his chair, a tinge of panic mixing with the general scent of him. Nüwa stopped with a distance near enough to smell him, but far enough to calm him down, but he was still tense and glanced over to Potter.
“I’m not sure that’s doable, Daphne’s cunt was pretty memorable,” he pants, already turned on beyond belief.
“Have you been thinking about me today?” Draco says, cocking his head to the side, his smile turning wider, a predatory glint in his eyes. “Have you been thinking about what you want to do to me?” He pushes himself up from the back of the sofa, sliding to sit on the edge of it. “Tell me, Harry,” he murmurs into Harry’s ear, sliding his hands along Harry’s back to let them rest on his arse, pressing it to make Harry rise up so that his cock is level to the sofa. Squeezing lightly, Draco pushes himself closer to Harry, and when his crotch comes into sharp contact with Harry’s aching cock, Harry can’t help but gasp at the sensation, unbelievably turned on. Draco chuckles, a low and guttural sound deep in his throat. “So hard for me, aren’t you, Harry?”
“Oh no, my dear, I’m quite rational. Why do you think it took me so long to get you here? I had to be absolutely certain my methods were sound before I’d risk your safety. Besides, you can hardly claim not to see the appeal. After all, you signed up for our little program here with the ‘boy wonder’. You know what it’s like to set your eyes on someone who thinks they are too good for you, otherwise you would have gotten him without our help.” He smirked as if he’d won. “I do applaud the choice by the way. Unfortunately, I can’t let you have him. You,” he pointed at Draco, “Are for me, my darling.”
“The bond,” Draco said with a tone of forced patience. “Remember they put us under a temporary bond when we got here? It must have begun to solidify when you saved me.”
Ron gave him a reproachful look. “Mate. Come on. Ask anyone from our year, or hell, ask anyone who went to school with us.”
The wood creaks as your feet hit the porch. It’s miniscule, clearly built for one person to fit under the leaking roof, and Harry presses close to you as you try the handle, and to your relief, the door opens to a small cabin. There’s nothing more than one room, but at least you’ll be dry and safe from the lightning. You step inside, Harry closing the door behind you, the sound of the rain subsiding into a gentle tapping through the ceiling.
“Are you an angel?” he sighs, almost reverent before he closes those beautiful eyes again. “Am I in heaven?”
Harry snorts. “Takes one to know one.” He ducks from Draco’s hand trying to slap him, and grabs Draco’s thighs to heave himself up so that their faces are level. “Now, do you want me to keep casually sucking you off, or would you be so kind as to casually put that gorgeous dick up my arse?”
The night of the party came, and the common room was buzzing with excitement. Paper streamers had been hung up, jack lanterns were suspended above their heads, and an assortment of food and drinks had been brought up earlier by the house elves, not to mention the Firewhiskey snuck in by some of the older students. The wireless blasted The Weird Sisters, and some of the Muggleborns were teaching the others Muggle party games. Draco managed to be left alone for the most part, sipping his glass of pumpkin juice spiked with the contraband Firewhiskey while he watched the party from the same windowsill Potter had haunted earlier that week.
“I have a cousin, back in Italy,” he began. “My family lives in this old estate, just outside of Turin. It’s gorgeous there. The mountains rise up around the valley, making you feel like you’re in the lap of the gods with the blue sky stretching above you like a canopy. In the summer, the air smells of sunlight and freshly tilled earth.
Draco looked up at Harry. Harry’s gaze was gentle, but the set of his jaw was firm. He tapped the marks with two fingers. It was getting hard to breathe around the lump in Draco’s throat.
Teddy shrugged and sat down at the kitchen counter. Outside, Harry supervised as their three kids flew around on child-safe brooms. The summer sun blazed through the cottage’s open windows, filling the low-ceilinged kitchen with golden light and the smell of growing things, warm earth and green leaves. Teddy was only visiting for a few weeks before returning to his grandmother’s for the last week of the summer holidays. Then, he and Harry would be going back to Hogwarts for the beginning of the school year, leaving Draco to look after the children.
Harry undid the fastening of Draco’s jeans so slowly, fingers brushing his erection straining through his pants, that Draco groaned, in pleasure or in exasperation he didn’t know.
defence,” he said, “you were the one who didn’t tell your mother you were bringing your boyfriend to Christmas breakfast.”
But instead of laughter, he felt Draco’s hand on his shoulder, up against the curve of his neck, his other hand gently nudging Harry’s chin up to look at him. His grey eyes were soft as they searched Harry’s face. He bit his lip, and Harry’s eyes followed the movement, watched white teeth nip into pale pink skin. Harry’s breath caught in his chest.
“There’s something else,” Teddy whispered. Draco looked up from adding the tomatoes to the salad, drying his hands on a kitchen towel. Teddy wrung his hands as he leaned on his elbows, worrying his lip between his teeth. “But it’s… harder to explain.”
When Harry landed back in the kitchen, it was to the smell of butter and onions sauteing on the range. Winded and reeling, he looked around. Draco stood at the counter, chopping up vegetables and stirring the onions in the pan from time to time. Soft jazz played on the wireless. He glanced at Harry over his shoulder before returning to his cooking, adding garlic to the pan.
“We’re not going to make it to the bed at this rate,” he pointed out. Harry shrugged. Draco let out a theatrical gasp. “But it was your idea!”
Harry stared at the words on the page as he listened to the flurry of French coming out of Malfoy’s mouth. He tried to hold onto the few phrases he recognised, but quickly found himself lost. He set his book on his bedside table and sat up, shifting his legs off the bed, to watch Malfoy. The other boy continued to pace, but he was now gesturing wildly, and every so often his stream of words would stop to listen to the other person. More than once he let out a sharp exhale of air, a little ‘poof’, puffing out his cheeks comically as he did so.
Harry really wished he could Apparate out of the offices, but there were wards in place against that. Ron looked like he could hit Harry. Based on his clenched, white-knuckled fists, he was considering it. The entire department had gone quiet, watching the two of them. Harry could feel his ears burning.
Dumbledore considered him over his half-moon spectacles. “You have piqued my curiosity,” he said, his blue eyes twinkling. “Very well. Send in this mystery person.”
“It’s easier than I thought it would be,” he said. He pulled his pyjama shirt over his head. “Although, I guess this was just one day. And he was very well-behaved.”
“If they do,” said Ron, making both of them turn in surprise, “they’ll have to get through me first.”
“I know that there are all of these security measures in place,” said Malfoy slowly, never taking his eyes off the hinges. “Logically and objectively, I know this. But I just….” He bit his lip. Then he rolled his shoulders back and looked up at a point somewhere past Harry’s shoulder. “Never mind, it was stupid,” he mumbled. He tried to push past Harry, but Harry grabbed his arm, holding him in place.
“I mean, I can get away with it, I’m Harry Potter, but what ever would they say if Draco Malfoy was not a hundred percent presentable in public?”
Harry let out a long breath through his nose before answering. “Ron, come on, Hermione’s right. He has changed a lot over the past ten years.”
Harry nodded, his bruised and bitten lips quirking into a vulnerable smile. “Yeah, I’m sure,” he said softly. “I want you. All of you.”
But that night, as he fell into a restless sleep, he dreamed of green eyes and summer-coloured skin, and he knew that Blaise was right.
Harry snorted into his coffee. “Well, I figured Teddy would be a good litmus test, you know, if he didn’t like him then that would be the final word on that.”
There was a loud bang and everyone fell silent. Harry was standing in front of his desk in full duelling pose, wand in hand and so much power radiating from him that it stole Draco’s breath from his lungs. Judging by the stillness in the classroom, as if the students were collectively holding their breath, he wasn’t the only one affected by Harry’s authority. But in an instant, Harry’s stern countenance was replaced by a friendly smile, everyone relaxed back into their seats, and Draco felt his own shoulders drop a fraction.
Harry laughs again, and Draco doesn’t mind so much that the flowers are expanding inside his chest because of Harry’s presence, if it means he’ll perish faster he’ll accept it, just to be with Harry like this, making him laugh like this.
“Thank you,” he said eventually. “I’ll let you know what I think of it.” Then he disappeared into the bathroom, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
The next day you wake up to the sound of birds chirping and the sun peeking in through the stained windows. You keep your eyes closed, trying to stay in the illusion that this is something normal, something you could have every day, to be waking up with Harry in your arms, warm and comforting.
“But I do have to thank you, love. What you did made me realise that you weren’t the only one too stubborn for his own good. Witches and Wizards throughout Britain were stubbornly refusing to accept the help and care of intelligent, sophisticated pureblooded individuals such as myself. Can you believe it? Wizards just like me, all over the country being rejected by people too stupid to understand what they were being offered. It’s because of you my love, that I developed this little program, as a means to help guide them into true happiness.”
Nüwa turned her head slightly to regard the man sitting next to Potter. She found him better looking, even for a human, more sharp edges and piercing eyes. But there was something off about him, and that piqued her interest. Slowly, she looked between him and Potter.
And at the other end of the pub, Malfoy catches Harry’s eye once again, his mouth quirking up at one corner in a smirk. As if he’s noticed that Harry’s been watching him all night.
“Tell me what you’ve been imagining doing with these knickers today.” Draco leans in towards Harry’s ear, his breath tickling the sensitive skin just behind it. “Do you want to slip them down before you eat me out? Or do you want them around my thighs while you slide your cock between my buttocks?”
Harry felt his cheeks heating, fully aware that this was not something you were supposed to say to your strictly professional partner slash friend. He cleared his throat, and he tried to look completely unaware of what he’d said as he met Draco’s gaze. “What?”
“Mother?” he asks, voice dry and weak again. He doesn’t ask about his father because he’s not sure that he’d even want him there, or if Lucius would dignify Draco with a visit, if he were even allowed a furlough from Azkaban.
The initial amusement of Draco conjuring up flowers had been replaced with fear when Harry realised they came from his body rather than him creating them with magic. The attack Draco had the other day scared him half senseless, and now Harry’s starting to suspect that something is very
Not knowing what to do, and afraid of waking Draco up, Harry lay down again on his back, staring at the ceiling, while images of the previous night swam through his mind. So apparently it had all really happened, it hadn’t just been a product of Harry’s imagination.
Harry folded his arms across his chest, glaring at Malfoy. “ Well, I didn’t realise it was story time. Why don’t you tell me all about Little Red Riding Hood as well?”
Draco told me to stop the other day. Or to be fair, his exact words were “do you want me to leave the two of you alone?” and when I asked who this other person was he looked pointedly at my hand. It was a bit embarrassing, we were watching Baywatch (because it’s brainless and entertaining with attractive people in it) and that bloke Matt Brody was on the screen. He didn’t make any remark about me being turned on by a man, thankfully. I mean, not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just that I’m straight as a nail. But I guess this lockdown is getting to me in weird ways.
There’s a fireplace in the middle of the wall to your left, and a little table with one stool right in front of you. You peer around to your right and find a bed shoved into an alcove.
into the touch. “So did you like it a lot because you loooooove me?” Harry mumbles into Draco’s ear, laughing when Draco kicks him in the shin for the third time. He really does have impeccable aim.
You make a noise of consent, and then you drop your forehead down onto the cool wood, focusing on breathing, on relaxing, on letting him in.
their longing for each other as Draco sang, like, the longing was in his voice in some way. I can’t really explain it. I never knew he could sing like that, or at all, really. I guess there’s something new to learn about a person everyday, even when you think you know all there is to know about them.
“You know, Draco, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were jealous,” he says with a slow smile.
Harry chuckled, feeling giddy but still surprised that this was finally happening. “Make me,” he whispered, tilting his head to the side and parting his lips, heart pounding violently against his ribcage. When Draco brought his hand into Harry’s hair and his mouth found Harry’s, Harry was seriously afraid that his heart would beat out of his chest.
Potter looks at him disbelievingly, and Draco recognises that face. It’s the one he makes when he’s tired of Draco evading his attempts to talk, or when he’s keeping things from him. But then he shrugs with a small exasperated sigh. “Fine, don’t tell me then. Actually, when I was a kid, there was this saying: ‘a magician never reveals his secrets’. Obviously that was before I found out I was a real wizard.”
“Thanks,” Harry mumbled, looking down and shuffling his feet. “I owe some of it to the other git who lives here, though.”
Draco pants from the exertion of the latest attack. The last flower was an amaryllis, and the size of it was excruciating even for Harry who only had to witness it from the sidelines. Draco’s forehead is sweaty, and Harry sweeps his matted hair from his face, letting his hand linger on Draco’s cheek, his thumb stroking his eyebrow. It’s dangerous, he knows, it’s more intimate than he could strictly get away with, but he tells himself that it’s Draco that needs this, and not him. Draco’s eyes are shiny with the strain, but when he gives Harry a shaky smile, Harry’s heart can’t take it anymore.
“I want you to lay me on my back and press your cock deep inside me, and I want you to be wearing those while you do it.”
Draco shrugged one shoulder, biting his lip. “As far as I knew, you and Ginny were still together.” He didn’t dare to admit that the real reason he’d thought Harry was playing a joke at his expense, was that some part of him thought he deserved it.
Harry felt like he was watching a ping pong match, his mind reeling at all this information. Draco’d had a crush on him at Hogwarts? And now he was in
And that’s when I think we both realised what we were doing because I tensed up, and so did he, and I might have sort of panicked a bit. I told him I had to make dinner and quickly went out into the kitchen (even made some lame joke about how I wouldn’t set the kitchen on fire this time). And when it was time to eat he said he wanted to do it in his room, and then he disappeared in there for the rest of the night.
“Why yes, I always wear short shorts when I do yoga,” Harry said, making his smile even sweeter. “I find it allows for maximum mobility.”
Now he’s back, waiting for the results of the tests they ran, and Pansy has graciously agreed to come with him as moral support. She sits beside him in one of the hard wooden chairs in the waiting room of the specialist ward for Magical Maladies. Her back is ramrod straight, gaze kept straight in front of her. Her lips are impeccably painted ruby red and her eyeliner sharp enough to stab someone. Draco knows this is her way of coping, of keeping some sense of control in an uncontrollable situation. She looks collected, fierce even, but if one were to look closer they would see the subtle trembling of her hands, as if she’s ready to snap in half at any given moment.
“All right, Auror Potter, we have everything we need from you,” Auror Silverling said while slinging her bag full of Harry’s recordings over her shoulder. “Will you be taking the same portkey as us?”
started kissing me. I just… I’ve never seen him so intense about anything before, it was like he was devouring me. And he grabbed my hair (like he did that first time I had my mouth on him) and used it to keep me in place and I… well I really
“I think you’re a bit too comfortable,” Draco says, trying to push Potter away, but he only snorts and clings to Draco even harder, leeching on and absolutely refusing to let go. Draco tries again, and when that fails he digs his fingers in between Potter’s ribs, which only makes him tickle Draco back, and suddenly they’re wrestling. Draco can’t decide if it’s all play or if they’re seriously fighting, it’s hard to tell with the both of them, it’s like they’re falling back into comfortable patterns of constantly trying to one up each other. But both of them are laughing, even more so when Potter almost falls out of bed.
And if you sometimes think about how your existence could have been in another time, in another life? You quickly shove it away and don’t allow yourself to dwell on such thoughts.
“I’m sorry it took me so long to realise,” you whisper, feeling tears of your own forming in your eyes. “But I do love you, Harry.”
Draco pointedly did not move towards Harry, and, after a silent conversation threatening murder took place, Draco motioned for Harry to throw the parchment over. He took it with a sharp smile and blatantly ignored the smirk that was shot his way.
I don’t know what to do to fix this thing with Draco. He’s still acting weird around me, and I think I’m acting weird around him too. We haven’t even had sex for about a week now because things have been so awkward, and while I kind of miss that, I know I can live without it, if I could just be with Draco like we were before. I miss him. Or what we had, how he used to be around me. I can’t believe I let sex come between me and a friend, and never in my life would I have thought that I’d let it happen with a male friend.
There’s a longer moment of silence and Draco fumbles in his head for a way to explain what just happened when suddenly his stomach lets out a loud rumble. Harry cocks an eyebrow in his direction. “Didn’t you just have dinner?”
Malfoy. He shivers involuntarily against the cold sweeping through his veins and he shakes his head.
He smiles tentatively at the receptionist at the CB office, giving her a quick salute before striding back to Blaise’s office.
The tall dark wizard throws his head back and laughs. “Bulgaria’s seeker is still a strong player. I thought you of all people
Draco snorts. “Come on Blaise…” He sighs heavily and slouches deeper into the armchair. “Pansy, I can’t - I can’t go down that road again.”
He rips open his drawer again and rummages for a scrap of parchment and a quill. He writes a rather long letter to Slughorn and details all of Draco’s symptoms and some of Harry’s theories, of course leaving out the blonde’s name, and heads to the reception desk with the Auror’s Owl, Heliador. He sends off the letter and tucks the case folder under his arm and heads to The Curse Breaker’s floor.
“Mom! You’re back!” He vaults himself onto the couch crawling into Draco’s lap squeezing his cheeks giving him a serious look. “Are you okay?”
The truth is, no one will ever want to be with a death eater. He’s unlovable. And quite possibly doesn’t know how to love. He pulls his knees up to his chest. He wishes he didn’t feel this way. Wishes he didn’t
Scorpius has his arms wrapped around Harry’s own and he’s looking up at him with silver questioning eyes. “What’s up Scorp?”
“Right, right… let me get that for you.” He starts rummaging through the drawers and Harry glances around the room, sipping idly on his coffee.
it’s ready. It’s cold in the small bottle in his hand and he clenches it tightly, a small flicker of doubt.
It takes two weeks to brew, and he works tirelessly – hiding the concoction in his room. Finally, on December 1
Draco looks up at them and shoots them a dreamy smile. “Come on you two! Let’s grab a bite to eat.” Harry scoops up Scorpius and puts him on his shoulders causing the child to squeal excitedly. When they reach the counter, Harry bends his knees as Scorpius reaches out to Malfoy. The blonde rests his son on his hip and smiles at Scorpius. “Did you have fun with Mr. Potter?”
2. I wanted to give Harry an ethnicity. I know a lot of people go with Indian, but I chose latin/spanish/hispanic. Mostly because I watched American Dad and Roger talks about his Enrique Iglesias poster. "He's latin and he has green eyes! I need it!"
Blaise shakes his hand. “You’re quite right – two years maybe?” He releases his hand and furrows his eyebrows in thought. “Pansy’s birthday, I think. How are you, Draco? What are you doing here?”
During the month of December, the ministry workers get half days and at the end of the year, Harry is so grateful for the extra time. Harry’s sitting at the coffee shop in the large atrium flipping through a prophet while he waits for Ron and Hermione to finish up. He’s halfway through an article on new uses for dragon blood when a pair of familiar voices hits his ears and he’s suddenly much more interested in what they’re saying.
He doesn’t get a text back right away and he fidgets uncomfortably before flagging down the bartender for another beer.
Harry chuckles, eyes sympathetic. “Been there.” He winces slightly and clears his throat before scooting over on the couch. “You – uh – wanna talk about it?” He pats the couch beside him.
The brunette rubs the back of his neck shyly. “Really, it was no trouble Mrs. Malfoy. I probably should get going…”
Harry nods seriously. “Yes. She’s going to take good care of you, okay?” He rises to his feet and places the cuff on his wrist. It burns his skin and vibrates violently.
“I’m fine mother, really.” He waves her off and gives her a pointed look. “I got a little dizzy in Diagon Alley, but I’m fine. Potter helped me back.” He pulls away from Potter and tries to give his mom a reassuring smile.
“Yes.” He clears his throat to hide the fact that he agreed a little too quickly. “Er – um – I’d like that.”
Draco rolls his eyes and feels himself warm slightly at the sound of Potter calling him love. “Alright, we’ll be on our way. Let me say a quick goodbye to Cormac.”
Draco places his hands on Scorpius’ cheeks, bringing their forehead together. “Yes, I am. Everything will be fine.”
When they arrive at the Manor, Scorpius is quick to grab Teddy’s hand and introduce him to Narcissa and Lucius. When he spots Andromeda, he hides slightly behind Teddy when he spots her, and Harry is quick to scoop him up and attach him to his hip. “Andromeda, this is my best friend, Scorpius.”
Scorpius looks at him before mimicking Teddy’s pose. It’s hard to take him seriously in his brown chinos, his checkered button up and pale blue bowtie and navy suspenders, but Merlin does he look so cute scowling down at Draco and Harry. “What do we have here?” He repeats.
Harry snorts. “Such a Slytherin to be so unfucking grateful.” Draco straightens out and Harry winces slightly.
He presses his phone against his chest and gives Cormac and apologetic look. “Sorry about that. We really should be going.”
Of course, he did. Harry fiddles with his Gryffindor ring on his middle finger. Because he’s bloody perfect, and kind, and sweet, and beautiful, and unfairly sexy –
“It’s complicated.” Harry rises to his feet. “Thank you for your help, mate. Lucius,” the blonde stand as well. “Are you guys finished here? Would you fancy grabbing lunch?”
Harry’s eyes widen and he looks at Blaise, finding the wizard leaning forward with rapt attention. “Draco’s here?”
He straightens out his clothes, taking deep breaths to steady himself. He’s freezing still, but he’s determined to make it by the fire. He’d try a warming charm, but they seem to just bounce off him. He tucks his wand into the holster on his hip and jogs down the stairs trying to catch some warmth. He sees Scorpius zooming around Teddy chattering animatedly before leaping up into Harry’s arms, the raven haired man catching him just in time and ruffling his hair. He turns his body and lands his gaze on Draco.
He chuckles. “Alright, alright. Let me say hi to your mom.” He gently squeezes the small blonde’s hand and lets himself be guided to the front desk. Malfoy is already waiting for him leaning over the counter. He’s wearing a steel gray jumper and black jeans and he stretches himself over the front desk, arms tucked underneath his torso and he looks up at Harry through a curtain of silvery locks.
Draco ruffles his hair and lifts him up to his hip, kissing the top of his head softly. “Something smells lovely. Would that be your doing?”
Narcissa floats elegantly in the room and takes a seat beside Lucius. “I think it’s good for his education to learn about muggles before he heads off to Hogwarts. He loves that school anyway.”
“Hello Harry,” She points her wand upstairs. “Teddy is packing his things right now, he’ll be down in a second.” She sits back in her kitchen chair and closes her magazine. “How are you, dear? Enjoy your weekend?” He thinks about Malfoy framed perfectly in the light from the window in bookstore, his hand tossing back his curtain of blonde hair and his silver eyes gleaming in the afternoon sun. “Apparently good, judging by the look on your face.”
There’s a tense moment of silence as it takes a second to register to the other three men before they’re throwing out congratulations and an indignant-
Of course, a deeper level of himself knows that he deserves this – knows that this is justified. He gets what’s meant to come to him. There’s a warm sensation on his face and he distantly acknowledges that he must be bleeding from not only his nose but some sort of legion on his forehead. His heart clenches and he feels himself grow colder, near freezing.
“Andromeda.” Her mouth snaps shut. “I think it’s a great idea.” He can’t help the smile on his face.
His eyes widen as she reaches over and delicately plucks his hands away from his lap to stop his nervous fidgeting. “Harry, it’s – it’s not as crazy as you think -,”
McLaggen glances at their sons, both of whom are staring wistfully at the playground against a darkening sky before stepping closer. “I was
Harry’s not exactly his number one fan right now. He huffs indignantly and rises to his feet. Maybe he won’t be in his office and he can just drop the damn thing on his desk and be on his way. He scrubs his hands down his face and sighs before flopping back into his chair.
He pulls away from Draco placing his tiny palms on his father’s cheeks. “Very much so.” He squints. “Are you okay?” He asks very seriously.
There’s a long drawn out silence and Draco presses himself against the wall, head tilted towards the door. Fuck if that’s a loaded question. There’s a small part of him that thanks Merlin that Scorpius asked Harry instead of him. “Well, we were enemies. We didn’t really like each other very much.”
to love and be loved. Didn’t want that warm feeling of affection. He wiggles his bare toes, slightly numb from the cold and it hits him.
Ten minutes later, Draco stands at the opening to the ice uncertainly. “Look mom!” He looks up and watches Scorpius let go of the wall, both arms wrapped tightly around Teddy’s as he skates beside him.
Harry scowls. “Oh, be quiet, Ted. I’m just eager is all.” His phone chimes and he nearly jumps out of his chair.
pregnant, it’s impossible to get a good night’s sleep.” She props her feet up on his table. “Besides, Ron gets you for drinks every Tuesday. I should be allowed to have you once a week too. He can watch the child –
He knows that voice. He shuts the magazine and uncrosses his legs, looking up to see beautiful perfect Blaise Zabini looking down at him. He’s wearing a crisp navy blue suit with a deep forest green tie and a white button up. He’s got a matching pocket square and glimmering silver cuff links, his slacks form fitting and his brown dress shoes as pristine as ever.
“-Narcissa. Thank you.” He holds up the small Tupperware of extra sandwiches. “This was lovely…” He winces. “Weird, but lovely all the same.”
“No.” He sighs. “I’m actually glad you’re here.” He admits. He bites his lip before deciding he needs to tell
He hesitantly returns the smile. “Okay.” He sighs and runs a hand through his messy hair. “Alright, I better go. I’ve gotta do some Christmas shopping in Diagon Alley.”
“I-,” Potter rubs the back of his neck. “-a little bit.” He admits before sitting back down. Draco takes the seat across from him.
They continue small talk to the outskirts of the park and Draco’s eyes widen. It’s been quite awhile since he’s been to the park, at least four months or so and he had no idea it could like this. There are white round lights strung up between the trees and little stalls scattered around with sweet treats and vendors. There’s a live band playing on a small stage and a manmade ice skating rink. He lets out a small gasp, Christmas music flooding his ears.
Mr. Griffin scans over the sheet in front of him. He’s got dark hair peppered with gray and he’s wearing a black shirt. “Mr. Malfoy there is a solution. You need someone to warm your heart.”
His son squeezes his cheeks and forces Draco’s attention back to him. “He was here when I woke up. Asleep on the couch. I thought you were still away.” His eyes look glassy but he smiles anyway. “Mr. Harry said we should cook you breakfast. He says you were home… early.” He gives Draco and accusatory look and Draco just rolls his eyes.
He leans back in his chair. “No, it’s not that… I just – I’ve been at it for almost ten years now, you know? Can’t help but feel like maybe I need something a little less…
Draco sighs heavily suddenly wracked with guilt. He should probably put a stop to this. He reaches for the door and freezes when Harry speaks again. “Scorpius your mom is – well he’s the - he’s the smartest wizard I know. Scorpius, your mom was a scared kid who made a lot of stupid decisions.” Draco closes his eyes tightly, because – isn’t that the fucking truth? “But so was I.” His eyes snap open. “Your mom is – Scorpius your mom is….
There’s a slightly breathless laugh. “Sort of the opposite actually. Here let me take this.” There’s a sizzling sound and Draco can only assume that Harry’s dumped the batter into a waffle maker. “Where are the glasses Scorpius?”
He learns that Draco’s parents have plenty of money left in the Malfoy accounts to avoid working and travel instead.
“Well,” She turns her focus to Potter and grabs one of his hands in both of hers. “It seems like I’m in you debt again. Thank you for bringing Draco home safe. Sit and have some tea, Mr. Potter.”
“Hello, mate.” He locks eyes with Blaise. “Sorry to barge in. Just wanted to give you my report.” He tosses the folder on Blaise’s desk. The Slytherin abruptly rising to his feet, slightly panicked, eyes darting between Lucius and Harry because – oh right, they hate each other.
The raven rubs the back of his neck bashfully. “Actually, Teddy and I live on the other side of the park.” He nods his head in the direction their headed. “About a thirty minute walk past the park and you’d be there.”
Draco’s throat runs dry and he’s saved the chance to respond when a waiter clears their dishes. He clears his throat. “Um. Thank you for lunch.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Fine, but you have to put on one of my aprons.” He gestures to the aprons hanging on the hook and Harry puts on an emerald green apron splattered with golden snitches.
Well if it wasn’t obvious where the posh way that Draco carries himself comes from, it is now. “If my son hasn’t shared what’s going on with you. I will not disrespect him by going against his wishes as well.” Harry deflates. “However,” He places his glass back on the table. “I also know you’re the only one who can save my son.”
When Draco’s eyes finally flutter open, he realizes that he’s lying in his own bed curled tight in cotton sheets. He’s still in his clothes from the night before, and he pushes his face into his pillow – a smile curling at the corners of his lips because this means that Harry
Merlin, he wonders if he was this dramatic as a child. A voice in his head sounding surprisingly a lot like Potters responds with a
He sways and Potter steadies him. “Come on, Malfoy. Let me help you inside.” He grabs Draco’s arm and throws it over his shoulder wrapping a warm calloused hand on Draco’s waist.
When the green flames subside, it reveals a wide eyed and soot covered Scorpius. Harry cocks an eyebrow “Scorpius?”
Draco clears his throat and removes his hands from Harry’s, instantly missing the warmth. “Yes, I’m – I’m alright. I’m sorry.”
“Yup.” He winks. “To win Draco, I’m gonna win over Scorpius. I want to make sure Draco knows that I want both Malfoy boys – I’m not just in it for now, I’m ready to be in it for the long run.” He clears his throat. “So, I’m gonna need to talk to Andromeda, Narcissa and even fucking Lucius.”
The rest of their lunch goes with small talk about work, Scorpius, Draco, marriage and fuck it’s weird to hear Lucius talk so beautifully about his wife.
Their aprons are gone, and they’ve just finished packing the last of the pastries – Harry’s at the sink washing his hands and Draco calls out for the kids to come down. “Hey, Potter. Hand me the – shit!” Draco takes a step forward, the bottom of his shoe slipping on spilled raw egg causing him to launch forward. Harry’s arms wrap around him and his back hits the floor, Draco sprawled out above him. They both groan and Harry sits back on his knees, straddling Harry’s waist. “Fuck! Harry, are you okay?”
Harry looks back at Hermione’s worried expression before looking back at Scorpius. “Listen, kiddo. I gotta go find your mom and I need you stay with my best friend Hermione.” Scorpius peaks out from Harry, frowning. “She’s like my sister, Scorpius. I promise she’s really nice and she’ll take good care of you.”
He blushes and takes a sip of his orange juice. “If it did… would that -,” He looks up and meets Teddy’s eyes. “-would that be a problem?”
Scorpius removes the cuff and holds it out to Harry. “This will tell you where he is. Mom says it’ll apparate him straight to me when I’m in trouble.”
She plays with a loose thread on his blanket. “He wrote a letter a few years ago, a long and detailed letter about how sorry he was for everything and he didn’t expect my forgiveness. He didn’t make excuses, or try to explain himself, he just – apologized.”
Harry’s head lifts up, his voice clear in Draco’s ear. “You’re not a coward.” He says vehemently. “You are one of the bravest men I know.” There’s a pause. “I know you knew who I was back at the Manor. You could have easily turned me in… but you chose not to.” His arms tighten around his waist, and he drops his head back to Draco’s shoulder. “Draco,” Goosebumps break across the blonde’s skin at the sound of his name on Harry’s lips. “You are so brave.”
Draco tosses back his hair and spins around patting Harry on the cheek a few times. “Yes, he quite is, isn’t he?”
Draco’s definitely not storing the small fact that Potter is into men and taller men for later use. Nope, not at all.
Draco chuckles, not bothering to fight the smile on his cheeks. “Very, Scorpius.” He reaches down and taps him on the tip of his nose. “Are you excited to meet your cousin Teddy?”
Potter’s right. Draco presses his hands harder into his eyes. No. He’ll beat this. He’ll figure this out. He
Teddy looks thoughtful for a moment as he winces taking a bite of burnt bacon. “Do you know if Draco enjoys cooking?”
The curse breaker sits in his desk, an ankle crossed over the opposite knee and fingers interlaced behind his head. “The hot blonde?” He chuckles. “Sorry mate, you’re gonna have to be a bit more
A moment later, Draco is staring at a way too close up version of Dean, Seamus, Ron and Neville. They blink several times at each other.
“Draco.” Harry let’s out a desperate laugh and Draco frowns reaching out and weakly brushing his fingertips against his cheeks. “Are you crying?”
and grabs a mug from the cupboard. Harry Potter is in his fucking kitchen, making waffles. He keeps his back to Harry, busying himself in the fridge searching for creamer. He’s standing at the counter, the silence between the two of them… comfortable when he feels too arms wrap around his middle and a forehead rest on his shoulder. He tenses instantly, clutching the mug in one hand, the handle of the stirring spoon in the other. He holds his breath.
like yourself do his own paperwork. The Great Harry Potter, reduced to menial tasks.” He crosses an ankle to his knee and leans further into his seat.
When Lucius finds the four of them in a tight huddle, his panic subsides and he spends the rest of brunch shooting knowing looks at Harry finally acknowledging that if anyone can save his son – it’s going to be Harry fucking Potter.
Draco takes a deep bracing breath. He’s been putting this off for far too long. He’s going to need to find someone or some sort of – counter curse to get rid of this and if he – if he can’t… he needs to set up a back up plan for Scorpius. Yes, his parents would be more than willing to take care of Scorp, but –
The phone rings a second later and Scorpius reaches out pressing the screen when Potter’s face appears in frame. Draco’s heart thuds. He can see him and Scorpius a dark blur in the setting sunlight. He grabs his wand and illuminates their faces with a quick lumos. “Mr. Harry!” Scorpius squeals.
The brunette rises to his feet, wand clutched in his hand. His dad’s fists are clenched at his sides and he gives Scorpius a squeeze because… this could end extremely bad. “Hey Scorpius, why don’t you go wash up for tea, okay?”
“Boring.” Harry finishes. He fishes out his wand conjuring a menu catalog. “Let’s get something to eat then.”
Draco blushes furiously as he sets the oven mitts down. “Oh ha, ha, Potter. We’ll see who’s laughing when you have a taste. I’m kind of an amazing baker.”
She huffs impatiently. “Okay… maybe when you were kids, but can you honestly tell me that it’s hatred now?”
The two boys let out small giggles and he fights his own smile when he sees Scorpius laugh into his hand. Teddy smirks. “Harry’s quite the gentleman, dontcha think?”
“Draco?” He snaps his gaze to Harry. The brunette gently removes the beer from his grip and takes his hands. “Breathe,” He squeezes. “Come on.” Draco nods and they let out a few breaths in and out together. “There we go.” He rubs a thumb over the inside of Draco’s wrist. “I lost you there for a second. Are you alright?”
He opens the door, the magic yielding to Draco’s appearance. His mother’s voice floats in from the kitchen. “Draco dear, is that you?” She emerges from the kitchen smiling gently. “I’ve prepared tea and biscuits. I want to hear all about-,” She stops and let’s go of the tray suspending it in the air before rushing over. She glances at Potter before turning to Draco. “What happened? Are you alright? Is it-,”
“Right,” Potter sighed, “I think it’ll be too risky to have you use a charm for chopping onions, I can show you how to do it the Muggle way.”
Shit, what if he noticed what I was thinking? It doesn’t even make sense that I’d want to kiss him because I’m straight, and so is he. I mean the sex is one thing, we’re both pretty desperate because of the lockdown and lack of other options. But kissing? Cuddling? I don’t know, it feels like that’s crossing some kind of line.
question. He looked up to the sky, wishing that he could travel there, go to the moon or visit some distant star. Just get away from everyone.
“Can I go play?” He points to the playground and Draco nods. “Yes, but stay where I can see you.” He reaches into his pocket and clasps a small bracelet around Scorp’s wrist. It’s one of his own inventions – something that alerts him if Scorpius is afraid or if he strays too far away.
Dean lets out a huff of laughter and runs a reassuring hand down Seamus’ back. “I think they got it, Shae.”
He squeezes his eyes tightly and takes a breath. “Alright, I’ll have my mother watch him.” He gently pulls away and follows in Mr. Griffin.
“Pansy… I know.” He swallows thickly and rises to his feet, her hand slipping away. “I want to do my best for Scorpius, but I can’t – I can’t trust Blaise.” He walks to the table where his potions are set up and turns around leaning against it. “Pansy, I need someone who’s in it for me
“Ah, we should be going.” He holds out his free hand. “It was nice seeing you, Cormac.” He puts a hand on Scorp’s shoulder. “Come along now, Darling. Let’s not keep Harry waiting.”
Quintin throws himself in the chair across from Blaise’s desk and flashes a teasing smirk. “You also didn’t tell me you were seeing that hot little blonde again.” Harry cocks an eyebrow and looks at Blaise.
Well, whatever it is, he’s sure to find out at dinner. Hopefully, it’s interesting. He runs a hand through his hair, slightly musing it.
Draco can’t help the goofy grin on his face because Merlin, it makes him so happy to see Scorpius so proud of himself. “You ready, Draco?” Harry steps out onto the ice and skates around to face Draco, reaching a hand out. “Do you trust me?”
The blonde clears his throat. “Yes, well. Sometime soon then?” He takes the call of speaker phone and holds it to his ear. “So, can I ask why you called?”
“It’s proper first date etiquette to order something cheap if your date insists on paying. A salad is modest, it’s proper, it’s -,”
Harry spun back and forth on his chair as he read his letter and couldn’t help but slightly preen at the fact that Lucius was impressed by him. He stopped spinning. Well, Merlin, if that wasn’t so fucked up wanting
Draco lets out a shuttering sigh because he’s still so effing cold, but – “Pan, I’m fine.” He gives her a weary smile. “It’s good to see you.”
He clears his throat and blushes furiously, the image of a perfect Draco Malfoy seared into his brain. “N-nothing. Nothing it’s fine.”
“Careful now.” He hears Harry help Scorpius off whatever he’s standing on and he can hear the small child reaching for utensils. “Mr. Harry? What’s the opposite of friends?”
“You let me go on and on about Ireland that day at tea and didn’t bother to tell me you owned the team!” Lucius lets out a boisterous and extremely out of character laugh and Harry fumbles indignantly. “I mean to tell you at brunch the other day, but what the actual hell, Lucius?!” He lets out a light laugh.
Andrew Wright. He’s a squib, mildly part of the Wizarding World, but ultimately he’s been raised in the muggle world. Perfect candidate for Draco. He won’t have to hide being a wizard, and someone who isn’t exactly versed in wizarding politics. He’ll have no reason to hate him, and he’s a –
Saturday mornings tend to be Harry’s favorite part of the week. He’s up early, the wireless playing while he cooks breakfast with his wand, washing the dishes as he goes. Teddy shuffles sleepily into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes tiredly.
“I-,” He looks at Hermione. “I don’t know how I feel about him now.” A smile tugs at his lips. “I definitely don’t hate him…”
The four of them in a tight huddle, and Draco feels himself warming slightly, the cold drifting a way.
So, he does. He spends the next year in a secret relationship with Balise Zabini. They have nice dinners, go to loud clubs, and he spends the night at Blaise’s flat once or twice a week while his parents watch Scorpius. It’s on their one year anniversary of hasty blow jobs, nights in bed, grinding in clubs that he decides he wants to take a step further with Blaise. They’re heading to a new posh restaurant in Diagon Alley when he decides it. He’s going to ask for him and Scorpius to move in with Blaise. His boyfriend is still getting used to his son, but he figures that perhaps longer exposure to each other could help the process.
Draco opens the door and sees Blaise gathering his belongings into his bags. “Hello, Dray. It’s good to see you.” He smiles as he adjusts his leather briefcase in his hand, coming around the desk. “You look-,” His smile falls a bit. “-casual?” Draco frowns. “It’s not bad!” Blaise amends. “IT’s just different than what I’m used to.” He opens the door gesturing for Draco to leave ahead of him. “Shall we?”
Draco is in the process of pulling something out of the oven when the floo chimes. “Scorpius!” He calls out. “Make sure it’s Harry before you answer!”
“Aye, aye Captain Mom.” He starts to move and stops suddenly, running over to Harry and motioning him down to his level, whispering in his ear.
She throws her head back and laughs slapping lightly on his arm. She looks up and catches Draco, “Oh hello again, Mr. Malfoy. Did you have another appointment today?”
Harry grasps Draco’s hand and helps him onto the ice. He slides a bit and Harry grabs his hand tighter. “Woah, steady. We’ll take it slow, okay?”
He opens the door to see Andromeda flicking her wand, washing dishes and having them put themselves away. She sitting at the kitchen table thumbing through Witch Weekly. There’s a cup of tea in front of her and she’s munching on some flakey biscuits. “Hello Andy,” They hug and she sets herself back in her chair.
Draco lets Harry’s warmth consume him as he’s pressed against his chest on a dirty alley floor before his eyes slip shut and the exhaustion settles in.
Ron cocks an eyebrow. “Are you dating a muggle? Is that who’s got all your attention in that box? What’s she like? Is she hot?”
For a moment Draco thinks he’s going to rip his shirt off and he’s unsurprised to find himself more than willing to let him. “Oh?” He feels a warm tingle go up his spine and can feel magic licking at his skin.
It’s good that he’s alone. It’s good that he keeps to himself. A sharp pain in his chest has him doubling over, hand clenching the table.
Draco laughs and pulls Scorpius away holding his cheeks in return. “I’m okay.” He bumps their foreheads together. “Did you have fun with grandma and grandpa?”
She gives him a small hug. “Any time, Harry. Come back soon.” Lucius nods to him as Narcissa loops her arm through his and sweeps him into the house with her, leaving Malfoy and Scorpius at the doorstep with him. Harry squats down and taps Scorpius on the nose. “Thank you, Scorp.” He lifts up the small tentacula succulent. “This is the
That’s the last straw for Harry. He slides out of his chair and walks purposefully over to their table. “Hello.” He offers casually before spinning around a free chair and taking a seat, arms crossed on the back of the chair.
“Draco?” He turns his head noticing his mother slumped in a chair. When she locks eyes with him and straightens up. “Oh Draco!” She reaches out and grips his hand gently. “You’re awake.”
couch, casually drinking a beer while he watches – he frowns – some kind of cheesy Christmas special.. He realizes his mouth is open and he snaps it shut, clearing his throat feeling suddenly very exposed without his waist coat. “Um – I – where’s Pansy?”
But he’s pretty sure he’d prefer to take on Voldemort an eighth time if it was between that and Hermione’s pregnant wrath. She’s brandishing her wand in one hand a rolled up Daily Prophet in the other. Despite her belly, she moves swiftly, smacking him on the back of his head.
Quintin laughs. “You scoundrel! I knew you were sleeping with him. No, I’m talking about the one from like five years ago. You were super secretive about it. Pale skin… platinum hair… the Death Eater – fuck what was his name again?”
He exits the restaurant, waiting for the safety of the outside to lean against the wall taking deep bracing breaths. “Shit.” He murmurs. Merlin, that was so much fucking harder than he thought it would be. He just needs to apparate to the manor and pick up Scorp and head home. He clutches his chest, there’s a fierce pain in his heart and his breath stutters. He’s growing dizzy and his mind is fuzzy.
He looks up and nods solemnly. “Alright, mom.” He holds out a small chubby hand. “It was nice to meet you, Mr. Harry.”
“Right. Sorry,” Harry shakes his head and turns away. “I spaced out for a second.” He clears his throat. “So I take it you like the burger?”
“Um – yeah,” Draco turns down the heat and starts washing his hands. “I’m cooking dinner, gimme a sec to wash my hands.”
Pansy shakes her head. “No, he’s less of a prick than that. He’s got a couple of dates I’ve set him up on over the next month to sort of feel him out so I guess we’ll see what he’s into. In fact,” She furrows her eyebrows and taps her disposable coffee cup thoughtfully. “In fact, I rather think he might fancy someone.”
“Yeah.” She frowns. “He’s always on that muggle cell phone of his, and he’s always smiling. He seems lighter than he used to be, but at the pace Draco moves – Merlin knows if he’ll ever make a move.”
But no. Draco is nothing. He works at a muggle/wizard bookstore, runs an at home apothecary to hide the Malfoy name… he was on the wrong side of the war. There’s no way someone like Harry fucking Potter could –
The address Malfoy gives him is one for a small bookstore. In fact, Harry is pretty sure he’s passed the place a few times. It takes him fifteen minutes to get there and he stands outside the door, peeking in. It’s gloomy and chilly so the bookstore is relatively empty. Right at the check counter he sees Malfoy, typing away at the computer in front of him and Scorpius is sitting on the counter, legs swinging as he thumbs through a picture book.
Draco smiles and watches him leave. The doctor pulls up a chair and the blonde schools his features.
“Are you serious?” The older woman studies him and he smiles happily at her. It’s nice having a mother and a grandmother figure in his life for Teddy.
Pansy seems to shrug as she picks at one of her false nails. “I don’t know. Draco seems to not want to go down that road again, and I don’t blame him.” Seeming to find no imperfections in her nails, she resumes her coffee. “Can’t really see Blaise playing a father figure role, can you?” She snorts. “Can you imagine him going to Scorpius’ muggle school for silly little plays and weird muggle sports game?”
Pansy is oddly quiet and he flicks his gaze up to see a torn expression on her face. Her voice drops significantly and if Harry wasn’t giving his undivided attention to them then he wouldn’t have caught it. “Because he doesn’t have much time, Theo.” Nott looks down solemnly. “Even though he has impossibly high standards – tall (
Draco leans forward and Harry places a hand on his chest to stop him. “Teddy will make sure he’s okay. I promise.” He leans forward a bit and adds, “Plus I’ve put a balancing charm on his skates like I did for Teddy when he was learning.”
“Walking?” Draco sets Scorpius down, kneeling down and buttoning up his son’s peacoat. “From here?” He rises to his feet and is surprised when he sees Harry standing behind him, his own black peacoat held open for him. He fights a blush and clears his throat, sliding into his winter coat. “Thank you, Harry.”
Harry grabs his beer and takes a chug, swallowing hard. “It’s not a muggle. Stop asking about it. What were you saying?”
Potter lets out a nervous laugh. “This is weird. It’s been so long. You look-,” Draco sees a thousand small flickers of emotion dance across Potter’s eyes. “-you look good. I can’t believe we haven’t seen each other in ten years.”
Scorpius nods against him, and a throat clearing catches their attention. A tall lean doctor with strawberry blonde hair adjusts his glasses as he looks over his clipboard. “Hello, Mr. Malfoy. Can I have a word with you in private?” He looks up.
He can tell Potter is talking loudly above a bar, but probably also so McLaggen can hear him – which is seeming to work as Cormac looks on in surprise.
