Both of his friends were still bickering a moment, but Hermione noticed that he had stopped.
—are you fucking with me? How is what Snape did supposed to have any influence on whether or not Blaise and I are going to stab you in the back? I get that Snape doing this is fucking with your head but I will fuck with your head harder the second I can lay my hands on you if you ever insult me like that again.”
If there are any questions, please ask!!
Back in the room, Bill stepped forward, hand off of his wand now. “Mrs. Malfoy,” he said gently. “I can go ahead and remove the Deathly Hallows from Draco and then Snape will bring him down to the casket. Would you like to stay with him while we do this, or would you like to wait and have us call you in once he is in the casket?”
One of his hands moved to cover his mouth and he was so fucked out on this realization that he gave no consideration to the man sitting across from him.
Draco remained silent even as the pause became longer and longer until the Dark Lord said, “That is correct, yes, Mr. Malfoy? You are going to do everything in your power to fix this? To make it up to your Lord? For your dear mother?”
He stopped and crouched down. Part of him didn’t want to reach his hand out to touch what he knew was in front of him—didn’t want to feel it confirmed. But there was another part of him that hoped he would reach out in this spot he knew to have left Draco and would touch nothing but dirt and leaves. That perhaps Draco had gotten up and walked away, alive and unharmed. Maybe he had just gotten lost in the forest, trying to find his way back to Hogwarts. Maybe he was disoriented, maybe his amnesia came back.
“Draco!” Harry whispered, coming up and embracing him immediately, feeling intense pain in his heart. At least when he died, his doing so would make everyone he loved safer.
And now no one from the Order can find him or contact him. We don’t know what’s going on. McGonagall says that nothing is wrong and that Harry is with her. And I’m sick and tired of everyone telling me just to blindly trust when it’s going against what is right in front of my eyes! Snape killed Dumbledore and we thought we were supposed to trust him. And you two have openly admitted that you’re only in this for Draco, so how am I supposed to trust you right now? I think that you need to get out of here and right now.”
“Of course. If I get him to date me and into wherever that may lead us, I will make sure you are never forced to sit next to Pansy Parkinson. It’s a reasonable enough request, I suppose.”
Moving closer, Bill dropped the invisibility cloak to the side and held his hand just below Draco’s nose.
if i have them say things that they already said but they say them as if its new info to draco i promise i just really have no idea whats going on okay its fine
For a moment, the conversation lulled and neither quite knew what to do. It was the first pause, the first time either truly stopped to think about what was happening. Were they sitting and sharing a drink? Catching up on the past like they were old friends?
Harry nodded, standing. Then, he walked downstairs.
At least they were supportive of him, right?
:::::PLEASE READ:::::CONTENT WARNING::::: So I wouldn’t say “graphic” depictions of violence because it is told in a very factual way in the aftermath, but a Slytherin student is physically assaulted in this chapter. See end notes for more information.
what he had pictured.
Draco gladly offered him the broom and Harry climbed on, intending to fly around in circles a few moments, but he wasn’t able to get off the ground for more than a few seconds.
Blinking, Bill withdrew his hand. Then, before saying anything, he checked again.
“No, wait, what did you mean?” Draco ran a little to catch up with him, finding Harry blushing and sputtering.
“Do you need anything?"
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry called after him. The blonde arched an eyebrow over his shoulder. “Tell me how the interview goes, yeah?”
Reaching a hand up, Draco ran his fingers along the scars across his chest, looking at them in the mirror past his open shirt. Bellatrix had been in his mind again, looking for this memory, but it was washed away with the obliviate. So instead, she gave him scenario after scenario, putting into his head exactly how Harry Potter would have torn him open, flayed him alive. And then she told him it was time to go take his revenge.
See you later?
Slinking out of bed, he grabbed a jumper from the chair by the door and threw it on before making his way to the small kitchen. He threw open a few cabinet doors, grabbing a glass out of the first before pausing, trying to decide if he would need it or not. Eventually, he decided that foregoing the glass would mean he may have to consider admitting that he may be an alcoholic so he shut the door and moved over to grab a drink.
Harry nodded, knowing he didn’t have to say anything for Draco to know he understood.
The next chapter is the last chapter!!!! (21 will be an epilogue)
“Mr. Malfoy, I was not aware that you were so skilled at Occlumency. Please refrain from using such a skill this next time so I may assess the damage of the obliviation. Ligili—“
Harry shrugged. “I hadn’t really decided yet at the time. She’s been offering it for years; still can’t find anyone to take it for more than a year. I’ve been trying to throw myself into the aurors but, honestly, I find less reasons to stay each day.”
Only, that meant that there was always the occasional gossip of ‘look, it’s Harry Potter!’ from a random corner of the establishment and he wasn’t exactly in the mood to smile and sign some bullshit dedicated ‘with love, Harry Potter.’ But he didn’t exactly want to go to a muggle place, either, because he didn’t trust himself to do anything but floo home afterwards.
“You’ll see him in just a moment, dear,” Narcissa assured him. “How are you feeling?”
Harry sighed. “I’m not coming on to you or anything. Just...unbutton your shirt. Take a look at your chest.”
Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair. “Yeah. Let’s not. Let’s just stay right here for a while.”
OH!!! and this chapter is taking place about three weeks from the last chapter. it is important to note the parchment has been hanging in the Slytherin common room for about three weeks
The glass hit the counter and the small
Harry Potter looked his way and Draco became a coward.
“I—it’s fine,” Malfoy said, but his voice was a tad raw. He cleared his throat and looked up to Harry. “I’m sorry, did you say Ginny is dating
GO TF OFF DRACO
He hadn’t been in the area in years. What could he possibly be doing at the
“Damn, Draco, how much clearer can I make it? I want to make things right between us. Possibly even be…” There was a very long hesitation before Harry settled on “friends.”
“Why don’t you come with me? Let’s go sit in another room and you can say goodbye to Draco at the funeral.”
Whelp, folks, this is it!!! The last chapter!! (Well, okay, there’s also an Epilogue coming after this but this is the last official chapter)
Draco reached to catch one of Harry’s hands in his own but quickly drew it back before it got there. “Tell me what happened.”
He started to slip past everyone, despite how much they kept asking what the letter said. Instead, he went upstairs. It was only eight pm but Harry knew he likely wouldn’t get much sleep tonight, worrying about Draco. Between that and the fact that everyone seemed to want to be asking him questions, Harry decided to just go to sleep. He would go to Madam Malkins in the morning.
“So do I. But you first.”
Suddenly, everything was blindingly bright.
Well, yes, actually Harry had wondered about that. “Yeah, what is that reason?”
Now, none of this was including the fact that he had run into Rita Skeeter on his way into work—which he was running late to, might he add. By ten am, he was saddled with talking to a group of new auror recruits about inspiring them. That was, of course, before he had to go and investigate a domestic call that should have been routed to a different department. Oh, and during that house call he had been drenched head-to-toe when a vengeful six year old had dumped an entire bucket of ice cold water on him (that offer from Minerva was looking more and more appealing every day). This was all not to mention that he had his monthly ‘checkup meeting’ with that piece of shit ‘therapist’ who was insistent on digging into his life and that she had ‘challenged him’ to ‘find closure’ with the Dursleys.
i made it a ravenclaw student cause i figured it would be too cliche to play off of the slytherin gryffindor rivalry cause this is so much more than that and also, i mean, i wouldn't do that to a hufflepuff
The redhead—Ron—spotted him first, his hand reaching out to tap the girl on the arm. Their attention caused the third—injured, glorious—man to turn as well.
Unable to take it any longer, Draco ran to him and threw his arms around Harry, sobbing immediately.
oh poor harry......
(one final thing: if you start to experience anxiety while reading this chapter abt certain things pls check end notes or send a comment real quick but i don't want to say anything here bc i don't want to give spoilers for whats ahead)
Harry grinned. “Seeker. Youngest seeker in a century, actually. Started as a first year.”
She stopped struggling, still fuming in Ron’s direction and then she just began yelling. “How many times do we have to fucking say it, Weasley? Just because we aren’t best friends doesn’t mean that we want to see Voldemort
the Elder wand?
It was shaping up to be a rather lonely year.
Harry buried his head in his hands as he continued. “I’m so worried about him. And I just want…”
When Harry finished his impromptu little speech, both of them quickly realized exactly how they were standing and Harry pulled back quickly, clearing his throat in the awkwardness. Both avoided each other’s eyes for a moment, not really sure what to say or do about that. Draco was sure that there was a blush rising on his cheeks.
draco is RIGHT. abt what, you ask? well draco is right abt many things in this chapter take your pick
And sure enough, Draco’s eyes opened.
“Hey.” Harry reached out and put a hand on top of Draco’s. “We’ve hurt each other. And that can be who we were not who are.”
that man’s muscles—was wearing that almost too tight shirt that showcases his torso so well that Draco’s mouth went dry.
“Around 24 hours,” Draco responded.
Beginning to sob, Harry held his best friend closer. “I died,” he whispered.
The only one left was the Elder wand. And Harry had to master the Elder wand. He couldn’t just find it in his possession, he had to be able to have some sort of power over it.
So, he broke the silence first. “Care to sit, Malfoy?”
“Listen, I would bet ten galleons that before he was obliviated, he knew mine. That’s just the way we are with each other.”
“Don’t ever sit me next to Parkinson at any gathering of any sort. Not at the wedding or the reception or any children’s birthday parties or anything like that. I don’t want to be near Parkinson, alright? Got me?”
“Right now, yeah,” Ron said.
best friend. Meanwhile mine is in a house of Death Eaters being a
Draco was crouched behind a tree in the Forbidden Forest and he could see Harry making his way closer and closer. He had to wait—he knew he had to wait—until the time was right. He had to lure Harry close enough for the ambush. And then he could run to him and embrace him before everything came together because Draco wasn’t sure where all of this would leave them.
But then, Draco blinked, releasing a single tear to roll down his face. Quietly, he spoke, his voice raw. “It’s not just me that needs help. It’s my family. He threatened my family.”
“If you would recall,” Dumbledore continued. “I told you that the true master of death is someone who does not seek to run away from death, but accepts that he must die and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”
Welcome to another chapter featuring Harry "Trainwreck" Potter
Being busy with Death Eater business was one thing, but for this long? To not respond to an
__________
She smiled. “Well done, Draco.”
TW PLEASE READ::: they talk about depression a lot and harry may be like borderline suicidal not like actively but draco may be actively suicidal like listen just know that it is a sensitive topic that this fic def covers
“Hey!” Harry called over to her. “Is that for me?”
When Voldemort appeared, Harry left his hands hanging at his sides, his wand still tucked away. He had accepted that he was going to die. More importantly, he had accepted that in order to stop Voldemort, he would have to die with or without the Deathly Hallows. And since he could see no way of obtaining the Elder Wand, Harry had already accepted within his heart that he was going to die today—soon—and he was going to stay dead. Forever.
He shrugged. “Now no one can touch him until the three days are up. You can’t take the stasis charm off unless he wakes up and no one can remove the Deathly Hallows. For three days. And no one can try and put him in that casket yet, either. You’re giving him those three days. He deserves that much.”
“…Friends?”
He landed softly, pulling Draco off of the broom.
But no. He had said three days. And he was sure his friends were going to do something about it soon.
. And I just want to tell him before it’s all over, before it’s too late.”
Grimacing, Harry squirmed a tad. “I don’t know. Lots of things. Paperwork is boring, being in duels gives me war flashbacks, I hate the Ministry....Things like that.”
“You know, I was thinking,” Harry began. “It’s kind of a shame neither of us are on our house teams anymore. I’m pretty sure you and I have some kind of Quidditch rivalry to settle.” He extended the broom. “Maybe once and for all?”
So Draco had taken to hanging out around the Quidditch field.
“Nothing it's just...” Oh, Harry felt like putting his head in his hands. Why was he so damn awkward? “When you sat down, things about you felt so different. Like the way you sat and the way you just....I don’t know! And then just like that,” Harry snapped. “It was back to the old Malfoy.” He shrugged. “I don’t know, not that that’s bad. It just....I’m going to stop talking.”
? Where had he learned that? It would explain why he had such a reaction to someone being in his mind if he had had someone in there before. The only question was...who? Draco shuddered to think that it could have been
__________
They each held the gaze of the other. It was like old habits were resurfacing. These days, Harry found that he was less and less competitive. He just didn’t see why it mattered anymore and to tell the truth, he kind of missed that in himself. It was like he could feel himself growing up and it was quite offputting.
pansy is inappropriate ik but like i mean?? bro i was like that when i was sixteen? and i knew ppl who were like that at sixteen? and we all know her favorite thing about it is how uncomfortable it makes ron lmaoo
Harry Potter?”
Anyway, sorry if this chapter feels a little rushed? Love you all!!!
He cast a quick glance around before getting out of bed and starting to creep over to the door. He would just have to sneak off to the owlery and—
Brutally, his aunt had pulled up every memory she could find. She began with the most recent and started working her way backwards, finding a small gap from the past year and then able to pull up memories from his fifth year. From there, she continued moving back through Draco’s life, pulling up memory after memory. It was so painful, but he could access them all. Every memory that was moved away from Draco’s access by the head trauma was now found. They were raw like fresh burns, but he could touch them. He could remember them. She had only stopped when she found the extent of the damage, back just before he began at Hogwarts.
“Draco, there’s one more thing.”
Insulting them? Why would Draco do such a thing? What had he done? What had he said?
Thank you all so so so much for this incredible journey and all of the kudos and comments that so many of you have left over the last couple of years.

AAAAAHHHH
The group all looked to Hermione, not needing to consult anyone else.
“It’s fine; we had only been dating for about a year this time and it clearly wasn’t going to work out. Should have remembered why we broke up the first time.” Harry looked up, running a tough hand over his face. “Really, it’s whatever. Not like she broke up with me to date Pansy Parkinson or anything.”
“Harry has been spending the last few weeks getting some things taken care of. No one will tell me what, exactly, but between McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore, one of them was with Harry and making sure he was safe at all times. Besides them, I don’t think anyone else knows what exactly is going on with Harry. And—”
Wonderful. It was strangely comforting to know this was normal-Draco and not just fearing-for-his-life-at-every-turn Draco.
Both of his friends were quiet for a moment, trying to figure out how to talk him down from this through his grief.
“And I...” Draco could barely get the words out. “I make fun of you?”
It had been almost thirteen hours since Harry had died. And he insisted on coming out to the forest to search for Draco. He had told his friends and other concerned parties that he simply wanted to recover Draco’s body—it had been well established that the Deathly Hallows were bullshit and weren’t going to help Draco so Harry had said that it was because, with everyone he lost, there were too many times where he never got to give them proper burials.
Coming out from underneath the invisibility cloak, Harry noted that it had started to rain.
, sorry I know he’s your head of house. I just hate him. And he used to teach potions and now he’s teaching my favorite subject, defense, and— Why are you laughing?”
WARNING:: second-hand embarrassment lmaooooo get rekt Harry
Oh, and another thing—the mirror had broken.
Harry was aware that he was sitting with both of his arms out and his eyes wide, staring off into the distance like he was absolute batshit high but this was a game changer. This was a bring-the-train-to-a-full-stop kind of situation because that was the most unbelievable realization that Harry had made ever since he learned he was a fucking wizard.
So, anyway. The first draft was /much/ better and I tried to write in as much as I remembered from it and because of that the writing might seem a little clunky or forced so forgive me but I've written this chapter twice in the last week and my brain is SHOT but it's FINE so please have a little forgiveness about this chapter.
Harry had already put the invisibility cloak over them.
Draco crossed his arms. “Shitty olive branch.”
“I knew I should have mentioned it earlier, but I didn’t know how.”
“Mother, what is happening?”
She said that he would be able to relate to the struggles of the Slytherin students in a way that other teachers could not provide. Most of them were stereotyped for their house. McGonagall even said that every year at Sorting, the first year Slytherins would cry and none of the older Slytherins would cheer. It was heartbreaking.
lmao ngl i started writing about hermione being pissed about the ministry not doing anything to protect the school when their lives were being threatened and like,,,,,HEEEE, i live in america and my brain was like 'fuck this is--this is--how yours truly feels about gUNS' like i didn't intend it that way i was in the middle of writing and i was like fyUCK
But, for now, he reached into his private potions cabinet and picked out a bottle of dreamless sleep, of which he had many. Without a second more to consider it, he took it and promptly went to bed.
these particular anonymous love notes weren't in the books cause they weren't relevant to harrys journey
mouth hasn’t been about Harry! Draco is my
But it was so much more to think that Harry was also going to be working at Hogwarts next year.
—talk that Snape had given Harry in regards to Dumbledore’s death about how Snape and Dumbledore had planned the entire thing so that Voldemort would not kill Dumbledore and therefore master the Elder wand and so Snape currently apparently was the master of the Elder wand? But then…then somehow…Voldemort was the one currently in
But Draco was sucking in shallow breaths right after one another. He had no visual memory of seeing the Dark Lord, but the rest of him did. Something visceral that brought up this panic inside of him that he never knew existed.
Despite the nice tone of the night so far, Draco could feel it getting worse by the moment and while he was sort of hoping that he could fall asleep and dream about a certain pair of green eyes, he was a little afraid that a pair of red ones would creep up and cause him to wake up screaming so he stood and crossed the room.
But the Dark Lord had looked at Draco and when he expected pain, none came. Instead, the Dark Lord spoke to him.
Draco smiled. “I think I’d like that very much, yes.”
He didn’t lift his eyes as he spoke. “What kind of person am I?”
“If it takes you three times to get every charm right, I’d say you need to work on listening.”
Silence hung heavy for a moment.
im...cryen, draco, that was beautiful
Harry burst through the door, sufficiently startling both of his friends. “Breaking news!” He yelled.
Without waiting for his response, Pomfrey turned and left him alone with his thoughts. While it was very kind of her to give him the option of writing to St. Mungo’s about the whole thing, he wasn’t quite sure he wanted the business about him being an occlumens to be put down on paper. Something told him it was definitely a secret. He supposed he could ask Harry later what he thinks he should do.
“Want to be friends?”
Pansy came into the room quite quickly, Blaise closing the door behind them.
“No,” Draco interrupted. “Ms. Topfeld, I understand that this would be the only way to assess the damage. But I am not having anyone in my mind. If you attempt a ligilimens again, I will throw you out again and I expect more violently this time. If that’s the only way you can assess the damage, then so be it, I will just have to not know. You are not going into my mind, do you understand me, Ms. Topfeld? Thank you greatly for your coming all the way out here, but if you can do nothing else then you should be on your way, yes?”
He had already known she was the one posing as the specialist from St. Mungo’s back when this all began. But now he also knew why: originally, it had been Draco tasked with killing Dumbledore. After the accident, it had been reported to Lucius and Draco’s father had taken it to the Dark Lord who immediately wanted an assessment of his asset at Hogwarts. He had wanted Bellatrix to do what was she doing then—dig up all of his memories so that he could continue serving the Dark Lord unimpaired. The intention was that any memories possible would be recovered, he would be briefed on the situation, and then he would once more continue the work that the Dark Lord had for him.
He lifted up the corner of the invisibility cloak and once his eyes landed on Draco he jerked back, bursting into tears—the reality of seeing it was too much.
Leaving Harry behind, Draco emerged out into the alley and quickly began walking towards Knockturn. It wasn’t until he reached the end of Knockturn that he found his aunt waiting for him.
Draco got on the broom and gave chase and soon they were far from the Quidditch field, racing away and off Hogwarts grounds. Eventually, Harry slowed and hovered in place, long stretches above the ground and Draco was able to catch up.
Malfoy put a hand out, his brows knit together in confusion. “I never dated Pansy.”
“Harry, I have no idea who I am or what I have done.”
In a few simple movements, Bill removed the charm and everyone in the room held their breath, waiting beyond hope for something to happen.
,” before Draco was able to even react.
“Firstly, we have a student watch going on. They’re monitoring everything that is coming on or off the grounds of Hogwarts through some heavily modified copies I made of the Marauder’s Map.”
“Well, um....Actually, no.”
pansy Really Just Loves saying the sentence "im draco malfoys best friend" huh
Which left Harry wondering why he hadn’t said anything.
And then the Dark Lord entered.
??updates??
Malfoy seemed to think about it for a moment and while he did, Harry took note of the ways his face was more...open these days. Like he had actively been trying over the past couple of years to show more emotion. Be more human.
harry, staring at pansy confused because didn't he already know that draco found that parseltongue stuff hot? draco, panicking because There Is More To It Pansy Has All The Secrets
“No,” Harry rushed. “That’s not necessary.” But his two friends were already planning. Oh, he shouldn’t have gotten them involved, should he have? They were well meaning, but they would likely go overboard.
Standing up, Draco knew one thing: he needed to look at himself in a mirror. He needed to know who he was.
"Shit," he muttered under his breath. The dreamless sleep wasn't working anymore. He had been taking it too often, building up a resistance. When this had happened in the past, he would simply brew a stronger batch, but if he did that again it would be dangerous. Which meant that he would now have to wean himself off of it and that was going to be hell.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait, Draco!” Harry called, lunging forward, arm outstretched.
Harry shrugged one shoulder. “He just hates me cause I look like my dad. Next question.”
Sitting back down, he folded his hands in his lap. He supposed he would just have to wait because he couldn’t do
this is dumbledore hate hour on this fic whoops sorry not sorry
lmaooo harry is just a uh mess
Harry stood frozen for half a second too long as Voldemort screamed, his anger ruffling through the entire forest. Wandlessly, Voldemort disarmed Snape from next to him—Snape clearly distracted as he tried to mentally recalculate his own useless plan to get the Elder Wand to Harry—and before anyone could do anything, Voldemort yelled, “Avada kedavra!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry tried again. “Why don’t you come with me into another room? It can be just the two of us and then you can give me that note in private.” Without waiting for a response from the owl, Harry turned and walked into another room. None of the Order members objected to the strange situation when the owl flew in after him.
Her eyes filled with tears as she smoothed her son’s hair back. “Everything is going to be fine. Stay silent, agree to do what they tell you, and don’t look anyone in the eyes. Unless he commands it.”
“Oh, I am going to hex you so fucking hard the
He climbed aboard the firebolt and held out a hand to Draco. Hovering there. Just like—
That thought brought him back around. Harry.
It was then that the door creeped open and a familiar face slipped in, coming to Draco’s side with a blinding smile. Harry was back.
He spoke in the voice that still felt too foreign and new. It was too deep. How old was he? "The last thing I remember is packing for Hogwarts."
Pansy and Blaise exchanged a look, wondering what then everyone was crying about. If Potter was fine, then—
Closing his textbook, Draco began packing up his things quickly. It would probably be wise to get out of the area before Potter spotted him and assumed he was spying on him or up to something. Draco thought
Moving carefully, Ron attempted to take his and Hermione’s wand out of Harry’s hand, and for a moment, Harry let him.
“Walking?”
Before either of his friends could respond, Pansy walked back into the room with Blaise following. “Potter,” she started. “There’s an owl downstairs going crazy. She’s got some note and refuses to give it to anyone. But it’s got your name on it. I suggest you go downstairs and try and get it from her.”
“Harry, what the hell?” Ron said. “We’re eating dinner!”
oooooohhhh
“I have feelings for Draco Malfoy.”
“So...teaching?”
also i don't have my copy of sorcerers stone so if the quote isn't perfect (although i doubt that i don't have it memorized) then thats why bc i couldn't look it up
Harry wasn’t near as drunk as he had expected to be at this time so he grabbed his coat and headed outside to an apparition point. From there, he took a moment to visualize in his mind the front door to his best friends’ flat and next thing he knew he was standing there.
Harry nodded, stopping where he was for a moment as Draco went off ahead of him. Then, he blinked harshly, snapping himself out of the trance he was in. What was he doing? He couldn’t let him just walk away.
“It’s
“Sorry?”
Bisexuality. What an amazing gig.
i promise they're gonna be professors in like 2 chapters lol finally gonna deliver on my tags fowfscsoiesgfkzj
He let out a sharp gasp, his hands flying up to his mouth. “Wha—How—I—“ He stumbles over his words, not knowing what to say or how to react. There were two thick scars bisecting his chest. They were about half as thick as his finger, white and scraggly against his pale skin. “What?” He sobbed, his fingers coming down to lightly touch them. He felt nothing.
Malfoy’s eyes didn’t leave Harry’s as he wrapped his fingers around the drink, his body turning so that he faced Harry. Regarding him for only a moment, he left the counter and walked across the room, stopping only when he was a few feet from Harry’s table.
But, of course, his thoughts now were stuck. On Potter. The little git couldn't get out of his head, could he? Not since he was eleven years old had he once been free from the plague that was Harry Potter.
i really wanted to leave this off at a little slice of life-type scene so sorry if you feel like its not a good ending i like it
After a small silence, Dumbledore spoke. “Are you quite done, Mr. Potter?”
(seriously you guys there was so so much more in that chapter that was so necessary that i just lost and i may end up brining it up awkwardly in later chapters if i remember but AHAHA its ok ig)
Draco was silent a moment, breathing deep like speaking was difficult. “I remember…Bellatrix. Gave me the memories back. And then…Harry. It was a trap. And then. I took the Dark Lord’s wand. And after that…Nothing. How did I get here?”
Draco watched in helpless horror as the Dark Lord sprung his trap.
“There was one time not too long ago when Draco called me on the mirror. It was our last time talking. And he talked really quickly about desperately wanting to tell me how much I mean to him. He said that he has had feelings for me for a very long time—strong feelings—and I wasn’t able to tell him that I feel the same. My whole life, I’ve never been able to really say goodbye to the people that I love. I wasn’t able to say goodbye to my parents, and just when I got Sirius in my life, he died and it was so sudden. He was just gone and I didn’t get to say goodbye. I know that I’ll be able to say goodbye to you and to the rest of the Weasleys, but Draco’s the only person I’ve ever really liked
Standing up, Harry was brushing off his clothes of dirt and grass. “Well, yeah, what did you think I was going to do? Make you get back on the broom with me? Cmon, up, let’s go.”
He had been expecting a scowl, a scoff, but instead Draco laughed. “No, really,” he said.
and one of the only people I have in the whole world.
Holy fucking mother of Merlin.
The upside, Draco supposed, was that he had his memories back. But really, there was no upside. He had his aunt digging through his mind for hours with the Dark Lord and several Death Eaters watching over it happening. He had spent the last hour alone just recovering from the ordeal his body had been through.
“Harry, I—” Draco began and Harry cut him off with a kiss.
After taking a moment to recover, Draco reached for his wand and cast a tempus. He didn’t have to be up for another two hours, but after the dreams he had had tonight? He particularly didn’t feel like risking it right now.
The date had gone well (up until that last no-kiss bit), Draco would admit. He even made Harry laugh a couple of times. Most of the time it felt good, but there were a couple of moments when that same guilt would creep in and seeing Harry happy would hurt. Not because he wanted him to be anything but happy, but because he felt like it was his fault that this hadn't all happened sooner. It was like after the war everyone had to train themselves to be normal again.
His face must have given away that he heard because Harry gave Hermione a scathing look. “I do
He glanced over across the table to Ron, trying to gauge where he was with all of this. His best friend was sitting there, staring intently into space. Clearly processing, but his face was blank. Almost like he was so utterly befuddled with the situation that he didn’t have anything to think about it. It just wasn’t possible for him to consider this as a possibility.
Did I ever mention that I LOVE Ron Weasley (AKA Best Friend Ever AKA The Samwise Gamgee of This Series AKA Our King) SO MUCH
Not anymore.
“Not as often anymore. Just after the war ended, it was really bad. I mean, multiple a day. Now I’m down to three or four a week. And it feels…terrible that I still have them that often, but I can deal with them better and anticipate them now and I’m confident that they’ll continue to get less and less frequent as time goes on. And I keep working on things.”
“So you understand,” Snape said. “Why we need to prepare Harry before bringing him in here and do it very carefully. We’re not really sure about his mental state right now.”
“Now, what I’m going to say initially is going to
Draco had been brought to a room full of Death Eaters. And instead of standing off to the side, he was sat down at the table. Every single second made this walking nightmare worse and worse until he was certain he was beyond hell.
! I’m so fucking sick of you thinking you have some moral superiority because of your
It took a few minutes for them to pull apart, both of them knowing that Draco couldn’t stay long and they needed to get on with the conversation. So pulled tight against each other in an alley, they got to talking.
He just couldn’t help it; the questions were burning his tongue as he tried to hold them in. And something about Malfoy...always got the better of Harry, didn’t he?
Her face turned worrisome. "Well, Draco. This isn't exactly an easy thing to tell a person but, you've been obliviated." Draco's eyes went wide. He— what? "Now, I know this can be a lot, but not to worry. It didn't seem to be too bad. While we unfortunately believe you will not able to regain the memories you lost, it is a bit spotty and we can't be sure. We believe you should still have your general memories— for example, being at Hogwarts and knowing who people are, things like that— but may be missing some details. Some obliviated patients find a total wipe of the memories while others find it much more touch and go. But, we'll see how it is in the coming days."
“Oh, no,” Draco waved a hand. “I am leaving, after all. Don’t you think there’s a reason for that?”
The room silently sighed in relief, knowing that Draco did not once again have amnesia.
also, please see this post i made that i call
“Don’t take the invisibility cloak off of him. It’s one of the Deathly Hallows. He needs it. Don’t touch it.”
So, a sixth year Slytherin perfect student is beat up by ten Gryffindor students. He has a broken nose, jaw, and rib as well as a lot bruises. His little sister sees him like this and there’s quite a bit of blood on him.
It would be more difficult later in the semester when it got too cold to be sitting outside all the time without a warming charm, but for now, it was pleasant and he would spend the afternoons and evenings either here or in the kitchens, depending on when the teams were practicing. And the only person who knew he was here was Pansy.
Sitting in the parlor at the Manor, Bill Weasley sighed. “He really hasn’t come out? In two whole days?”
So Draco was to finish the vanishing cabinet.
Like, fuck, Draco just walked in the damn front door while everyone was in class.
Forgetting everything he was supposed to be telling Harry, Draco kissed him back.
Then, he would lure Harry to Hogwarts—it would be easy enough to get him to come alone because Harry would think that no harm would come to him at Hogwarts. He thought the school was a fortress and he was surrounded by friends here. Everyone agreed he would readily come alone. And then the Death Eaters would come through the vanishing cabinet, able to ambush the Order allies that controlled the school and the Dark Lord would show up and he would kill Harry Potter.
Hermione smiled. “I’ll tell you about it later. Essentially, the goal was to watch out for anything suspicious and let the students feel like they’re doing something useful because right now we all feel like we’re waiting around to watch our loved ones die. Mr. Lupin, I get the sense that no one from the Order is being to forthcoming about sharing information so I was thinking we could go to the students who have been on the watch recently and see if Harry has been showing up as coming on and off the grounds. Maybe we might be able to find him that way. If he’s at Hogwarts, we should be able to find him through the Marauder’s Map and we also might be able to figure out if there’s any information that might be useful to figure out what happened with Dumbledore’s death.”
Startled, it took Draco a moment to kiss back and, even then, it was a quick kiss before he pulled away.
“Deny it,” she countered.
“Nox,”
“Shut it,” Harry laughed. Then, he sighed. “Well, I guess we’ll have to fly back on mine. It’s kind of too far to walk.”
oh NO!!!! whaaaat did i possibly? continue the suspense of the last chapter by not getting back to the great hall and the ten pairs of shoes w blood on them on ten students' empty PLATES hmm?? oh nooOOOooo :))))))
“Honestly, I have ever since Fudge was still Minister.” He shrugged. “Just not sure I believe in their competence. Sorry, I know that you, uh—“
“Wait,” Harry said. Something had just occurred to him. “You don’t think he’s dating someone already, do you?”
and he has
“Hey, sleepyhead,” Harry said, a smile on his face. “Welcome back to the land of the living. You know, I think you and I took different routes back.”
“What did I say about the initial thing sounding like the news but not actually being the important thing?” Harry asked, exasperated.
“Sounded a lot like how we usually talk. But, let’s go back. You remember him threatening your mother?”
Instead of Pomfrey answering it was the man. "Sixteen. You're barely a month older than me."
And since there was no way for Harry to be able to get his hands on the Elder Wand, he was going to die for certain. For good.
“Don’t take the cloak off,” Draco insisted. “We can’t be too careful.”
After a fucking day like today, didn’t he deserve one?
awww they gonna go get a house together and get married!!! what cuties!! and we love that they waited and had a healthy relationship uwu!!!
“It’s nothing,” he said. “We can, uh. We can talk about it later?”
His and the wediwitch's attention were both drawn away as the door burst open and three teenagers barreled in, one slung between the other two. Two were in deep maroon, Gryffindor quidditch gear, the other was a girl of the same age. But Draco's eyes were immediately drawn to the one in the center.
It was only now that everyone calmed down enough to look around the room that they were in. It was an uninhabited sitting room and they all took seats around the room, Remus the only one to stay standing as he paced in front of them as he began to explain.
“Okay,” Harry whispered. Then, he stood.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “So, uh...how’s Ginny?”
“I’m off the clock, so consider it the polite question of a civilian that you’re technically having drinks with.” Merlin, this man.
“It’s Dumbledore,” Remus said. “He’s dead.”
Oh my gosh!! If y'all would have asked me last week when I updated, I would have told you this fic doesn't have a planned ending. But then I wrote this chapter and it was like....shit we're really almost at the end, aren't we?? So...there's probably only gonna be a few more chapters (and yes this has to do with the fact that I have another long multichap drarry fic that I just started writing today and already wrote 2 1/2 chapters in because gUYS im so excited abt that one please uhh stay tuned flkajflka)
harry's uh...speech? lowkey made me tear up a lil...
Draco’s mind was so overrun with fear that he barely was listening to what was being said. Until, that is, the attention of the Dark Lord was on him.
In shock, she looked behind her to see Harry holding his wand, hers, and Ron’s. His eyes were cold. “Get away from him.”
Ron blinked a couple of times. “Harry, why would I hit you?”
After closing the door, the owl finally landed and held out her leg to him. Sure enough, Pansy had been right and there was his name on the front of the note.
After it seemed to stabilize after a moment, they both silently decided it was time to land, the broom giving a scary couple of drops on the way down.
For a moment, Harry just stared at the invisible spot on the bed as his eyes filled with tears. Narcissa had her hand underneath the invisibility cloak, likely holding her son’s hand.
oop…uhhh….heh heh… don’t be mad?
ok ill ask yall since readers of one of my other fics did not respond: do i sound too much like a Poetic Bitch when i write or are y'all cool w it lmao
But even thinking about the manor set a cold feeling in his bones; there was this
“I’m Draco Malfoy.”
He felt her beginning to push into his mind and his arms came up as if to fight to her off. But what could he do? He had no idea how to defend from her invasion. All he knew was that he wanted her
“It was just…it was the…” He took a deep breath, knowing Harry was opening his mouth to say he didn’t have to tell him. “Fiendfyre,” he finished.
THANK YOU all for not pointing out the plot hole that in chapter ten, snape tells draco that narcissa can't know. we're just gonna assume that that whole conversation happened off-screen because it is now Very Pertinent That She Know
“It’s not Harry,” Hermione said.

PLEASE READ::: TIMELINE::: I just want y'all to be aware that we're jumping back a little bit. Remember like 2 chapters ago when Snape went to talk to Narcissa and then Narcissa walked to Draco's room and just as she got there Bellatrix was also getting there? That's where we're picking up for this chapter.
Draco blinked. “I’m sorry that was a lot to process. First, you’re a parseltongue? Second, what do you mean there was a basilisk in the school second year? What? Third, a second year brewing a polyjuice? Damn. She sounds smarter than me.”
Malfoy smiled. “Yes, thank you for offering.” He slid into the chair across from Harry, leaning back, sitting casually. Much less refined that Harry remembered him being. To think that Malfoy would lean like so, his spine not perfectly straight, was almost making Harry uncomfortable. Maybe in these years since school he had changed. One can never tell for sure.
Now, Ron’s eyes lit up and he pointed at Hermione excitedly. “Holy shit, you’re right! We had all these theories about Quidditch players but in actuality he just had a few crushes.” Ron crashed back in his chair and muttered, “Holy shit, that makes so much sense.”
Were his parents dead?
So, yeah, Harry was fucking screwed.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “We already did that.”

Inside, he found Draco in the back, carefully keeping himself in the corners and shadows.
Once they were in a room upstairs with the door closed behind them, Ron, Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise all looked expectantly at Remus. He was the adult here, after all, and he was really the only one with any kind of access to what the Order knew about.
Now, Harry’s hands moved upwards, grabbing at the sides of Draco’s face, all while staring intensely in his eyes. “You’re Draco Malfoy. You’re a bit of a git, but you’re not evil. What you’ve done because

oooh what an interesting note to leave off on….for the this chapter and the last….i wonder what it could mean (((((((:
Harry laughed, but it was cut off just as Draco’s broom began to drop.
(See the end of the chapter for
Because at the end of this, through all of it, they were still Harry and Draco. And that didn’t even consider everything that was going to happen when the goddamn press found out.
“What?” Draco asked, but Harry was already pulling further from him, walking around him, as if he knew exactly where the trap was supposed to be.
While it was unorthodox for a new teacher to be head of house, they didn't have anyone else for Slytherin house. Apparently, McGonagall had been stepping in for the last two years and she desperately needed someone. When the potions job became open, she said that she immediately thought of him for multiple reasons.
Draco had assumed she meant his potions ability and the fact that he was a Slytherin, but there was more to it than that, as she had said. And what McGonagall told him was actually what made him take the job in the first place.
Their eyes met. “It’s the result of years of the two of us crossing lines. But,” he wiped his face on his sleeve. “This year was by far the worst. It started out and I kind of was...eavesdropping on you and your friends on the train underneath my invisibility cloak and you realized I was there and you petrified me and then stepped on my face and broke my nose and covered me with the invisibility cloak and left me there, hoping I would get taken all the way back to London.” He sniffed.
Draco began to tear up. “You know Bellatrix has desperately been trying to get in my mind. She wanted to see the extent of the obliviate so that the Dark Lord could send me back to the work I was doing sixth year as his insider at Hogwarts. The Dark Lord convened a meeting and everyone just sat there as he commanded me to look into her eyes and she tore my mind apart. It was all I could do to not let her know about Snape and Pansy polyjuicing into me. So I had to feed her something that she thought I was hiding in order to trick her. And I gave her you and the mirror and me reporting on the Death Eaters to you.”
__________
To the surprise of everyone in the room, Draco wasn’t pale. His lips were a healthy pink and his skin had a living flush to it.
hmm seems hermione may be?? onto something??
Time hung heavy in the air, palpable, before Draco smiled and said, “Sure, Potter. Owl me,” and turned to continue on his way.
There were a few whispers as he began to sit up.
so what was the point?
Sorry this took so long lol I was having major writer's block with this chapter for some reason :/
“Wonderful.” Harry smiled and Draco found himself…smiling back.
“Fine. If you won’t, I will—hand the mirror over.”
“You said every other fifth year would have joined and not snitched. Even you?”
Silence hung heavy in the room as both women at the foot of the bed stared at him in incredulity. Eventually, however, Ms. Topfeld righted herself and straightened her jacket. Without a word, she turned and headed back in the direction of the floo. Ms. Pomfrey shot him a bit of a glare before running off after her.
It was the man who had been injured that spoke first. He cleared his throat and addressed Draco. "Hey, uh...how are you?" It was asked tentatively, questioningly. Draco didn't know how to answer, but luckily the mediwitch jumped in for him.
The fear was mounting now and he couldn't stand not knowing any longer. "How old am I?"
PLEASE READ:: TW::
“But hey,” Harry started. “This gives us a better opportunity to talk, right?”
Bill nodded. “I mean, Harry’s been through a lot in his life. He’s had a lot of trauma and been asked to do things that no one his age should have to do. And we still don’t really know how dying and coming back to life affected him. There’s a potential that this could have broken him. It could be just from the act of dying or the way that he walked into the situation willing to die or just a combination of this happening at the same time he lost Draco. Possibly even just a culmination of all of the trauma of his life. Harry might just have reached a breaking point. The problem is—like Hermione said—what are we doing to do when tomorrow comes around and Harry can’t move on? He said three days, but the chances of him letting it go after three are incredibly slim.”
Eyes lighting up, Harry launched into telling him all about Gryffindor tower. He sounded like he loved it.
At that moment, the world seemed to end for Draco.
He looked sleepy and weak, but his eyes found his mothers. “Mum?” He looked around the room, not even lifting his head with how weak he looked. “Mum, what happened? I don’t remember.”
But here he was, sitting across from Draco Malfoy, neither of them wanting to be the first to speak, the first to break eye contact, the first to leave. Like a third year game of chicken.
fasfjaofjajJ!!!!! HARRY

Harry laughed. “Well, it seems you succeeded, doesn’t it? I’m here. I’m dead. And there’s no Deathly Hallows. And the thing is, Dumbledore? I walked into that forest knowing it was a trap; I walked in there knowing that I was going to die and there was nothing I could ever do about it. And I did it anyway because it was the right thing to do. So I’m here. And I accepted my death and I didn’t even try to fight it. So, congratulations, Dumbledore. All your hard work to craft a seventeen-year-old martyr worked.”
Ron sat down on the side of the bed as Hermione walked in. Harry sat up again and his two friends hugged him, not needing to say anything but knowing that what Harry needed right now was just to be held.
But he could also overhear more discussion. “We need to let him rest, we can’t all just go barging in there.” “But, please, can’t we just see him?” “We need to wait for him to be cleared by a mediwitch so that we can be sure—”
Not hours later, Draco jolted awake in a panic, fear gripping his chest. He flailed, grabbing at what he could until he realized he was in his room, in his flat, in his bed. He was safe.
“This is how I walk! Is that a crime now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
As she turned, Draco breathed a sigh of relief. So she didn’t know he had snuck out and he hadn’t missed the expert. Thank Merlin. He would have killed Harry if either of those things had happened.
“What is it, Mrs. Malfoy?” Bill asked.
Draco pulled back, looking Harry in the eyes. “The Dark Lord’s wand? Why?”
THIS is what domestic fluff IS babey
Hermione put her hand on his back. “Just want what, Harry?”
Blinking, Draco leaned away from Harry, eyes wide as he jerked his hand back. “I beg your pardon?”
Pomfrey gave him a stern glare that said he shouldn't be interfering but he didn't seem deterred. They both looked to Draco for the answer.
“Draco—”
He had missed his friends. Oh, he had missed them so much.
He was on a pathway out of town when something caught his eye at the edge of a building. It was Draco, and he was walking towards Harry.
But that didn’t exactly mean he could have it.
He buttoned up his shirt and grabbed his wand, ready to set off for Hogwarts once again.
Harry didn’t know. He just knew his fucking brain hurt and he didn’t have the Elder wand and so there was really no way of coming back from the dead.
“I have to go. Don’t worry about me.”
Draco didn’t know what was happening. “Are you challenging me to a seeker’s game, Potter?”
JFLAJFL these notes were on the first draft of the chapter, not this one, but i still feel like y'all would like to see them:
She shook her head. “Nothing. I’m just not ready to leave him yet. You can go ahead.”
“No, Parkinson, I’m fully aware that that was just the beginning of your wrath.”
Draco’s face scrunched up and he turned to look at Harry. “What do you mean you’ve hurt me? I’ve called your friends slurs and—“
If I have continuity errors or have said things twice I apologize but it’s been a minute since this updated lmao
FUCK cormac ok?
He just wanted to focus on his life now, dammit. It was going so well, too. Not only did he have a good paying job lined up, but he had just gone on a date with Harry Potter. And he couldn't take a moment to just be happy about that?
The blonde ordered a drink at the bar and just before the glass was set down in front of him, he cast a glance about the room. His eyes caught Harry and he near did a double take.
“What happened to Potter?” Blaise repeated, starting to feel queasy.
Ah, same old Malfoy.
“He’s arrived,” she said and there was urgency in her tone. “Go, move, quickly.”
And that smile. So casual, so bright. It was like a warm glow set off inside the entire restaurant.

This was all so unfair! He wakes up, finds out that
“I’m over here!” Harry yelled. “Come and fight me! Show yourself!”
And he didn’t even fucking kiss him! Every single part of Harry’s body language was screaming ‘kiss me!’ and Draco did nothing with that information.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Isn’t he hopeless?” He said to Hermione before turning his attention back to his best friend. “I think step one is talking to him, yes? Get together, have a good time, at the end you can arrange to meet again, but this time make clear that it’s a date. That’s all you have to do.”
After a long fifteen minutes, Ron blinked a few times and inhaled sharply before sitting up and glancing around him. “Harry,” he began, seriously. Harry’s heart sped up in his chest. This was too much; he couldn’t do it. He felt like he was going to vomit. “I have one request.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Groaning in frustration, Draco walked back into the hallway and tried again. This time, he opened the door to a large collection of objects and he rolled up his sleeves and set to work.
Tearing up, Draco held Harry so close and so tight, whispering in his ear, “Anything, Harry.”
“Yes, my Lord.”
A dense pause hung in the air. “Mr. Malfoy, please look into my eyes.”
Draco heard a cry as the world righted itself, his consciousness coming back into the hospital wing. Ms. Topfeld has crashed onto the floor and was staggering to her feet, holding her forehead. She glared at him angrily.
Now, Madam Pomfrey appeared again, a stern look ready for Draco. “Mr. Malfoy, that women was an expert at her job and potentially the only person that could help you. Why you would refuse treatment is beyond me. I must also say that your behavior to her was quite rude. But,” she uncrossed her arms, her expression softening. “I understand that a ligilimens is an invasive spell and all patients have the right to refuse treatment. In fact, you were refusing it the first time and her catching you off guard with it was, quite frankly, unprofessional and unethical. So, I am giving you the option of writing to her superiors at St. Mungo’s to report her for such behavior. If you weren’t such a skilled occlumens, she would have invaded your mind without your consent and that is highly unethical.” Madam Pomfrey paused. “I suggest you write. I will sign off on it if you choose to do so, but ultimately it simply an option proposed to you. Now, after that ordeal, I suggest you get some rest.”
“Well, didn’t he say that since the wand wasn’t taken by Voldemort winning some kind of fight that he wasn’t its true master?” Hermione asked.
Ron whirled around to face the Slytherins. “
HEY!!! I am currently looking for a beta reader for another work of mine! Please dm me on my linked tumblr for info! It’s another drarry fic and will be only a little bit longer than this one. I’m not looking for a lot of technical editing, just some content questions.
“Harry, sit down. It’s alright.” Harry sat, moreso falling, still grumbling.
me like Draco does. At least you have plenty of people that are concerned about the safety of
“You really don’t remember anything?” Harry asked. Draco shook his head and something in Harry’s eyes changed. “Well, then. I’m Harry. Harry Potter. Nice to meet you, Draco.”
It took less than a minute for Draco to not be able to breathe. Less than thirty seconds more for Potter to notice.
tw suicidal thoughts
Bill and Snape shared a nod and Bill removed the invisibility cloak from Draco’s body that no one had seen in nearly three days.
In the end, he had to sacrifice himself. He fed Bellatrix pieces of information—mostly true, but containing a few fabrications. He gave her the memories from the hospital wing at Hogwarts. She looked through the memories of him realizing he was a Death Eater, and realizing he was in love with Harry Potter. She saw everything about the mirror and the conversations and Draco deciding he was going to become a spy. But he was able to fabricate a small piece that made her believe he had been feeding Harry the information directly through the mirror, leaving Snape and his mother out of it.
Like that hair. Harry Potter probably had no idea how fucking sexy his hair was. Always looking like he had just rolled out of bed after lazy, Sunday-morning sex or something like that.
sorry this took so long :/
Ron came running around the corner and threw his arms around Harry.
One that Harry knew he was going to lose.

“Sorry?”
“See, I knew it was jinxed,” Draco said once they landed.
jfioajfiojifoej!!! im not DEAD y'all im here and updating and everything
“Yeah, I can’t, Parkinson! It’s broken! It broke, okay? I have no way of contacting him.”
Draco refused. He didn’t know why, but there were alarm bells ringing throughout his brain, telling him that that would
“Ron!" Draco heard Harry yell, joined by a feminine voice saying, "Ronald!" chidingly.
“Well, for the most part I’ve been working for the French Ministry as a liaison.” He made a face. “Didn’t particularly like it, though.”
i apologize in advance for how much back and forth this chapter is, but it's still p easy to follow so y'all should be fine i have faith in you lol
i think it's really funny that this fic is like "harry wasn't able to say that he also has feelings for draco" and then in another fic im writing literally in the last chapter like fjkfjsk they've been dating for a long time and draco wasn't able to say back to harry that he loves him too bc something happened. anyway shameless self plug go read my other drarry WIP same amount of chapters as this one rn Back In Town lmaooo esp if you love slytherin house

“Ha, ha, very funny.” But Potter was smiling. “Now you better get on that broom if you want to catch me,” Harry said before flying off.

When he had paced in front of the door, he had thought of the room full of things, all of them strewn about, but the vanishing cabinet especially. There, waiting for him.
oh my god fjlasjflj y’all that chapter was over 2k longer than all the other chapters aaah
anyway things needed to be said in this chapter so uhhhh,,,,, i love ron. love that boy.
Draco avoided Harry’s eyes, voice quiet. “You have panic attacks, too?”
Narcissa nodded. “Yes, dear, you need your rest. That was a lot to take in. Why don’t you go back to sleep and Snape and Bill can go talk to Harry? I’ll be right here, dear.”
Hermione turned to him, worried. “Harry, what did you just do?”
In the dark of his room, Draco jolted awake. What the fuck was that? What was his subconscious trying to tell him with
Y’all know it really is true that when you leave nice comments about how you love a story, it’s like new chapters magically appear! Anyway, lots of varying emotions in this one sorry but it’s a bit of a roller coaster.
Throat dry, about to pass out, Draco managed to say, “Yes, my Lord.”
“Mrs. Malfoy, he—he’s breathing.”
“What? The man who writes outrageous books about things he definitely never did?”
With that, Harry turned and began to walk away from the place of death, wanting to be as far away as possible.
It meant that there was no hope for Draco.
harry: procrastinating and desperately trying to not ring-up hermione
“Have you had any memories come back to you since then?”
Well, at least they succeeded.
Closing the door behind him so that he wouldn’t be bothered or interfered with, Harry removed the invisibility charm and levitated Draco’s body out. He laid him on the bed, keeping him fully covered with the invisibility cloak. Then, after checking that the other two Deathly Hallows were laid in Draco’s hands, Harry sat down next to Draco’s lying form, his back against the headboard. He was determined to stay there until Draco woke up.
“McGonagall seems to trust him, so I would too,” Hermione insisted.
Wanting just a moment alone, Harry threw the invisibility cloak over them. Just so that he could have a moment to say goodbye to Draco. Because he never got to say goodbye to anyone. Even Sirius’ body vanished the second he died.
Harry didn’t even know how this was all happening, he couldn’t even process. There were horcruxes being brought to him and he was destroying them as they came and there were…there was all that shit about the Deathly Hallows or whatever it was.
“Holy shit," one of the trio mumbled, but Draco couldn't be sure which one.
Harry laughed lightly. “No, it’s a—It’s a muggle saying. Anyway.” He paused and cleared his throat. “Hi. I’m Harry Potter.”
Within minutes, they were creaking open the door and slipping Draco back into bed.
Staring at his own face above the sink, he remembered something—Harry told him about the scars on his chest—he had been having a breakdown in a bathroom when he and Harry had gotten into that fight.
It was then, as he was attempting to get his sobs under control to evade Voldemort’s detection, that Harry realized Draco was the master of the Elder Wand. At least, he had to be, right? He couldn’t make sense of all that Snape had said earlier. But he knew what he just had seen—Draco had disarmed the Elder Wand from Voldemort. And there was a small element of choice in who the wand decided it wanted its allegiance to align with.
is a terrible person with extensive memory loss and then it just gets worse. It was like he got worse in such a small period of time. Like it had happened so quickly and he couldn’t even review the circumstances in which he had become the worst person he knew.
__________
Confused, Draco’s hands still moved to begin undoing buttons, but he kept an eye on Harry’s face as he did so. He was looking elsewhere, avoiding the eye contact and seeming very interested in the far wall.
But Remus put a hand on his shoulder, effectively stopping him. “Let’s all go upstairs, okay? I’ll fill everyone in.”
“Oh. Right, sorry. I just felt like that was important,” Hermione said.
harry never broke the two way mirror and mundungus never got it and sold it to aberforth. harry went and found it after sirius’ death and just carried around both halves and like cried ig
The Dark Lord had made everyone else leave the room so that Bellatrix could give him her report. It was just the three of them. After she had spent nearly another hour giving all of the information to him with Draco slumped over in his chair barely conscious, the Dark Lord made her leave the room as well.
The room stopped, looking at Harry as the owl came to rest atop a bookcase. Harry outstretched his hand to her. “If that’s for me, might I have it?” But the owl didn’t move.

To Harry, things felt strange. But nice.

Working quickly, Bill removed the rest of the Deathly Hallows and set them to the side. Then, he pulled out his wand and ran a quick assessment on Draco.

Quickly, Draco stopped, fisting his hands in the sheets, eyes wide open, and began narrating out loud to himself. "I am in my flat. I am in Hogsmeade. I am in bed. I am safe. I am twenty-four years old. The war is over. I am safe from the feindfyre. I am safe from the feindfyre. The war is over. I am safe from the feindfyre."
Naturally, legilimency can open a two-way street and Draco had tried to use that to the best of his advantage.

His mind kept running circles about this relationship and all of the millions of ways things could end up going. What if it was over before it even began and then they had to work together? What if it was the opposite and they were dating while they were working together. What if—
With a deep breath, Harry steadied himself for the avada. But his concentration was ripped away when he saw the Dark Lord’s wand fly from his hand.
“You're freaking him out, Ron. Just stop. Be nice, would you?"
Draco nodded in response, uncertain to whether Harry was still even there to see it or if he had already turned to walk away. He could only hope that he hadn’t been discovered by Pomfrey.
Draco wondered if bathrooms had always been his first choice of where to have a breakdown, or if that was just a result of living in a house full of Death Eaters.
“What do you mean you stalked me sixth year?”
“When I was eleven," Draco added.
__________
” Ron yelled and silence settled in the room.
It wasn't until Pomfrey had made sure the man was alright—but had told him to stay put for the night that the trio even realized that Draco was there. And the moment they did, it was clear they recognized him.

He placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead, glad that he had gotten that moment to tell Draco that he loved him back.
“He’s awake,” seemed to be what was repeated the most.
” Blaise put his head in his hands, trying not to vomit. “That’s our best friend, Potter,” Pansy continued. “You have no idea how concerned we are for him. You have no

“You hate the Ministry?”
“I love you, too.”
The man shook his head. "I mean, I knew this happened, but I didn't know it was this bad." He met Draco's eyes. "Are you alright?"
Harry took a casual swig of his drink, stopping when he noticed the look on Draco’s face. “What?” Harry asked.
He tried to remember what exactly had woken him up, and it took him a second, the memory foggy in his mind. But after a few moments of struggling he saw it clearly: the fiendfyre.
Draco didn’t know how to respond. He was sitting with tears still streaming down his face, trying to come to terms with who he was.

Bellatrix was suspicious of Snape, but knew nothing and therefore wouldn’t bring it to the Dark Lord unfounded—especially since Snape had apparently just brought the Dark Lord something very special that he wanted after he killed Dumbledore. Fortunately, after seeing everything Bellatrix was no longer suspicious of Draco himself and had full confidence he would cooperate now that he had experienced how helpless he was against her (or so she thought, considering all he was still able to bury from her).
guys i LOVE pansy lmao
There was silence in the room a moment, a lot of people looking awkwardly at the floor or the walls. Ron in particular looked a little chastened.
“Actually,” Harry began. “I just ran into him. We had a drink together—“
“I mean, we did. not. date.”
He felt Harry’s warm hand closing around his right wrist, compelling him to open his eyes. Draco did, meeting Harry’s green ones but still refusing to look down. He couldn’t bear to see that ugly thing marring his skin.
ngl if a man shows up unannounced at 3am he getting that door slammed in his face like who tf do you think you are lmao
Draco glanced down at his hands, unsure of himself. Why was such a cute boy that he had apparently previously bullied being so nice to him? “I always wanted to play quidditch.”
“It’s an olive branch, Draco.”
Draco crashed down in an armchair in his flat, thinking about all of this. Was he really pursuing a...relationship with Harry Potter? Harry James Potter? The same man from his childhood?
As if on cue, the door opened and Remus, Snape, and Bill Weasley all entered the room.
He had a crush on Draco Malfoy.
Harry was sat between Ron and Hermione on a sofa in Grimmauld Place and he was recovering from a hefty cry. They had sat by his side the entire time, comforting him. Well, that was, after the initial anger Ron had exploded with when Harry told them about everything.
“Weasley, what are you talking about?” Blaise asked.
Draco laughed a little as he stood and the two of them began walking.
“What all does he remember?"
He looked the same. Mostly. For the most part. He supposed. Natural signs of age were evident: a more defined facial structure, his hair was slightly different. But that wasn’t the part that made him pause.
“How did you even come to this conclusion? He’s in been in France for the last three years.”
Harry screamed in horror, his body already turning and starting to run as the killing curse hit Draco and he fell.
“I’m not necessarily saying I forgive you for this, especially considering I don’t know the full story,” Draco began slowly. “But, I think I like what you said earlier. How about we let this be who we were and not who we are?”
“Hello, Mr. Malfoy,” she said, her deep voice ringing in the air. “My name is Ms. Topfeld. I understand you have been obliviated and have lost all memory from the past five to six years. Is that correct?”
__________
Immediately, all eyes were back on Pansy.
Now Ron was definitely angry. "He's called my girlfriend a mudblood, Harry, so I will not just be nice. He may not remember, but he's still Malfoy."
In Harry’s situation, this particular day was truly building up a case to be one of the worst in recent memory:
For a moment, the world settled for Harry and he just held his best friend. They didn’t let go of each other as Ron began to whisper, “It’s over, Harry, it’s all over. You-Know-Who’s dead, it’s all over, you’re okay, it’s all over.”
“It’ll be okay, Harry,” Hermione reassured him for the millionth time.
“I think so,” he said, slowly lifting his head to look at Hermione. “If it turns out that he’s moving back around here, then I will ask him out. Especially because I had already decided earlier today—before seeing him—that I was going to take McGonagall’s job offer soon. I wasn’t sure if I would take it for this coming school year or try to make it one more year with the aurors but....I’m not sure anymore.”
Draco could have buried his head in his hands.
“This is breaking news, Ron!”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry said.
“Harry,” Hermione said, standing slowly. “All I’m going to do is move him into the body bag and we’ll take him back to the Manor. Narcissa has already arranged the funeral. Let’s bring him home. To his mum.”
. That doesn’t sound to me like the position that I want to be in, especially considering that if Harry doesn’t get a hold of it, he won’t have all of the Deathly Hallows. So yeah, it sounds really fucking bad to me.”
It seemed like a strange sort of fit, Draco teaching children. Not only that, but there was one other thing that Draco had neglected to mention to anyone else—even Harry on their date: McGonagall wanted him to be head of Slytherin house.
Well, Draco would argue it wasn’t the
“Actually, I’m pretty sure you two are going to be, like Head Boy and Head Girl. You definitely have the best grades in the school.”
as always, i apologize for how quickly they flip moods but lets be real i mean it's these two lol
“Are you ready to go back now, Harry?”
It whipped straight past him.
“I’m…not sure I understand.”
Ron turned to her, his mouth hanging open. “What do you mean you agree?”
He didn't know if he could ever go into that tower again.
“Never mind,” Draco rushed. “You don’t have to answer that. Your friend made it quite clear what kind of person I am. I hurt you and—“
Next, she turned to Pomfrey and began peppering her with questions about the incident. They seemed to come in rapid fire and Ms. Topfeld didn’t take notes.
“And Astoria Greengrass?”
Draco set his glass down, his face becoming unreadable once more. “Potter, you need to understand that a lot of the things you thought were true about me are not. A lot of what I did, I did because I had to do. Except for most of what happened the first couple years. Especially all the remarks about the Weasleys—that was just ignorance. But once we got into the
When you combine sexualities in that way they are mutually exclusive.”
“What are the Gryffindor dorms like?”
So, yes, this was turning out to be a shit fucking day. And all he wanted was to have one motherfucking drink. Alone.
“What about Draco?” Pansy asked.

“I know exactly what you mean.”
Someone was flying.
“Show us the letter, Harry,” Molly said. “We want to make sure it’s safe.”
She took one long look at Ron and then smacked him upside the head. “I wasn’t asking about Potter you idiot! If I wanted to know how Potter was doing—he’s sitting right there—I’d just ask him!” She whirled on Harry. “How’s Draco?”
Harry held him back, tightly. “I know you have your memories back. I knew something was off. Everyone is waiting.”
? I have to get back to the hospital wing. There’s supposed to be an obliviation expert from St. Mungo’s coming today and I hope I haven’t...missed...” Draco trailed off as he turned, looking until he spotted the door and running to it, flinging it open. His entire focus of coming here was to get answers but the expert could potentially give him more answers than Harry Potter.
Pansy looked at him a moment in shock, clearly trying to decide how to respond when Blaise couldn’t hold it anymore and ran to go throw up.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry started. “I just…I really have feelings for you. I might be in love with you. Actually, I’m pretty sure I’m in love with you. And I’m really scared right now and we don’t know what’s going to happen, but I just didn’t want anything to happen to either of us without me telling you first. Now, what were you gonna say?”
