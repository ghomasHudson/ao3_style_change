"Quite alright Mr. Malfoy. Please take a seat we are waiting on one more person before we begin." Headmistress McGonagall said gesturing to an empty seat. Draco quickly sat down and wondered who they were waiting on.
"Get on top and make sure your ass faces me." Harry commanded.
“RIGHT THERE FUCK IT FEELS SO GOOD HARRY! (A/N: haaaiiiRRRyyy baby)” Draco yelled out as Harry rammed into his good spot over and over.
“So, was that everything you were hoping for?” Harry asked wrapping his arms around Draco, who was leaning against him.
“Draco calm down, I canceled class for today, I also took the liberty of calling your friend Blaise and he will be emailing you everything you missed in your classes today. He said he would also cover your shift tonight, he said something about sending him sexy pictures of us together but I’m not sure if he was serious or not. Anyway, just relax, I took care of everything.” Harry said grabbing Draco’s shoulders and getting him to look him in the eyes. Draco took a minute to process everything.
"Draco...that was...I-" Harry was cut off by Draco kissing him deeply.
"Holy shit..."Draco whispered looking over every inch of Harry's amazingly fit body. He focused on one spot in particular and his mouth began to water.
"Merlin's beard!" Draco shouted arching his back. Harry continued to finger Draco's hole, licking here and there. He added a second finger and smirked at the loud moan he got from Draco.
The two spent the next few hours talking and drinking.
“I hate that you came in like five minutes ago and you still look better then me.” Blaise huffed jokingly giving Draco a thumbs up. Draco laughed and grabbed Blaise’s hand. The two made their way into the main part of the club. When they got into the main part, they went to their designated arears. Draco was the bartender and Blaise was serving. S&M (Slave & Master) was a club that allowed people that were into the slave and master kink to come and relax without fear of being judged. It also was a place where people who didn’t have a master/slave could come and maybe find one. Private rooms were provided for those that wanted to form a contract and employees were always available to help if needed, they also had playrooms that could be rented.
"Harry let’s move this to my room." Draco panted holding in a moan. Harry gave one last suck to the nice hickey he was leaving on Draco's neck before replying.
*time skips cause I'm lazy*
“You can borrow something of mine, we’ll wake up early enough that you can go through my entire wardrobe and find something that will work. While you do that, I’ll make us breakfast.” Harry said gently kissing Draco’s forehead.
*A few minutes earlier with Draco and his friends*
"How can you be so fucking sexy." Harry groaned looking over Draco. He leaned forward and kitten licked the ring of muscles and heard Draco gasp. Gaining confidence from that gasp Harry started lapping at the hole getting bolder and bolder the louder Draco got. Harry stopped, he watched as Draco looked back at him and gave him a smirk. He leaned forward and put to fingers against Draco’s lips.
“I will not allow that fag to steal you away from me Harry Potter!” Ginny screeched before wiping her wand out and pointing it at Draco. Before she could utter a word though her wand went flying out of her hand and landed in Headmistresses McGonagall’s.
“Totally,” Harry agreed. “I’ll see you inside?”
When Draco was sure they had spent half of the remaining Malfoy fortune, they stopped for a late lunch at a small cafe. Draco was sipping at a glass of wine and gazing out the window, his thoughts drifting back to the night before and that perfect kiss at the end of the evening, when Narcissa pounced.
Harry wrinkled his brow. “Er, why wouldn’t I be?”
“Alright fine, perhaps I was a
“I was exploring the woods,” she told him. “I’ve been researching the magical creatures of this region, and I was hoping to find signs of Wampus cats. They’re mostly further west, but I’ve heard that some have been spotted out this way.”
“None at all. I’m still pretty shocked, honestly.”
just friends, then?” he asked, sounding hesitant but hopeful.
“What on earth would I be plotting?” Harry asked, both amused and dismayed at how his expression had apparently given him away.
The elimination ceremony was extremely anticlimactic and cheerless.
Draco smiled; he’d suspected that might be the case, but it was both relieving and amusing to have it confirmed. “The same, more or less.”
“Get your head in the game, Malfoy!” Capulet yelled, glaring at him before quickly turning his attention back to preventing the Falcons from increasing their lead. “Find the fucking Snitch and end this thing!”
The amount of fun I had writing this chapter was, frankly, obscene. George/Pansy might be my favorite completely bonkers pairing of all time.
Harry looked at him, surprised. “Oh, come on! That was just an accident!”
“Oh, no, hang on,” Harry said, climbing to his feet from where he’d been sitting with Ron and Hermione, discussing a project that she wanted to embark on and that Ron really wished that she wouldn’t. Frankly, he was happy for the chance to step out of the middle of it. “There are more tucked away in one of the cupboards, I’ll go grab them. Be right back.”
“After Hogwarts,” she clarified, and Harry cursed internally, suddenly feeling very, very sober. He thought back to the drinks he’d consumed and tried to remember if he’d left any of them unattended at any point.
the time, and that it was now safe for him to rise—clambered out of the bed. “Well, I’m just… bathroom,” he said eloquently before sort of run-walking to the en suite and shutting the door tightly behind him. He managed to hold back his groan of embarrassment until he heard the sounds of Draco shuffling out of the room and closing the door quietly behind him. Fucking hell.
(See the end of the chapter for
"…So-" Harry cut Draco off by slamming his lips into the blondes. He swapped his tongue across Draco's lips and groaned when he was allowed in. Their tongues danced and played with each other. Harry backed Draco up and then push him onto the bed climbing on top of him quickly.
"I want to lick you Harry...please let me lick you." Draco begged getting off the bed to kneel in front of Harry. Harry was hung and Draco wanted to suck on it like a lollipop.
“Does my outfit please you?” Draco asked lifting his arms up and doing a spin. Harry felt the air leave his lungs when he saw that Draco’s plump ass was exposed.
“FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” Draco yelled out pulling his mouth away from Harry’s. Harry was all the way inside of him and it felt amazing. Harry laid Draco down on to his back and grabbed on to Draco’s hips lifting them slightly so he could hit Draco’s pleasure spot better.
"Not yet you’re not ready yet." Harry mumbled into Draco's neck licking at the rapid pulse. He tore Draco's  shirt open and made his way down, nipping and sucking at each nipple leaving little red marks all over Draco’s chest. Draco became a moaning mess beneath Harry his eyes wide with lust, lips swollen from hard kisses. He looked down in shock when he felt his pants being undone and pulled down. He watched as Harry not only pulled his pants down but his boxers as well.
"Potter...are you out there?" He heard Draco ask through the door.
“Yes! I’m still here sorry, yeah I can bring you the papers.” Draco said.
It only took a second before Harry started to kiss back. As he grabbed Draco's hips and slipped his tongue into his mouth, he could smell that sweet scent again. Urged on by the smell he broke the kiss and stood up. He quickly tugged off his shirt and Draco gasped. Years of quidditch had done wonders for Harry's body. Harry smirked and unbuckled his belt and sliding his pants down stepping out of them when they pooled around his feet. Draco forgot how to breath. The hard bulge trapped in Harry's tight boxers made Draco's mind race with perverted thoughts. He could feel the slick start to leak down his thighs as he continued to stare at Harry's pelvis.
“No, sorry I didn’t pick up the first time, I was just studying in the library,” Draco rambled finding a bench and sitting down, “Did you need something?” Draco asked setting his stuff to the side.
“Come on I need to talk to Hermione and Ron real fast.” Harry sighed pulling Draco towards the Gryffindor table. Draco glanced over at Pansy and Blaise who were giving him concerned looks, he gave them a little wave to let them know he was okay.
“Yes, things are much better now Mione…that’s why I’m here actually. The other night when I left dinner early, I ran into Draco and we spent the whole night…talking, and we spent a lot of time together yesterday as well. We’ve come to realize our feelings for each other are mutually and have started to date.” Harry said giving his friends a worried look. Draco hadn’t been the nicest person when they were younger, and Harry wasn’t sure how his friends would feel about him dating Draco.
“Let’s change locations.” Harry whispered leading Draco out of his office. They walked up some stairs and into a spacious bedroom before Draco could look around Harry was kissing him again. Draco slowly undressed Harry crouching down to remove Harry’s pants, he mouthed Harry’s crotch through his boxers. He glanced up and was pleased to see Harry looking at him, his usually bright green eyes had darkened with lust. Draco gently pulled Harry’s boxers down, Harry’s semi hard cock flopped out almost hitting Draco in the face. Draco breath in Harry’s heavy scent, drool pooling in is mouth. He wanted to taste Harry’s cock so bad. He looked back up at Harry silently asking for permission. Harry gave a slight nod and Draco opened his mouth and flicked the tip with his tongue, licking off some precum. He wrapped his lips around the tip, hollowing his cheeks he started to bob his head up and down going lower and lower each time. He felt his gag reflex get touched the lower he went and almost gagged a couple of times but was able to stop himself. He reached up and wrapped his fingers around the part he couldn’t reach with his mouth. His hand moved in sync with his mouth. He reached up with his free hand and gently fondled Harry’s balls. He glanced up at Harry and hummed when he saw Harry’s head tilted back with pleasure. He felt Harry tense when he flicked at the tip of his dick with his tongue. Letting Harry’s dick go, he opened his mouth his hand quickly moving up and down Harry’s cock. He rubbed the tip against his tongue and occasionally sucked on it.
*Time skip because this is already 14 pages long*
“Where the bloody hell have you been? We looked everywhere for you! Did you hear about what happened in the Great Hall this morning?” Pansy gasped out when they finely reached him. She really needs to exercise more.
“So, you guys are okay with me dating Harry?” Draco asked looking at his two of his closest friends.
"You have no idea how long I've wanted this. Wanted to touch you. Kiss you." Draco whispered running his hands all over Harry. Peppering kisses all over his face.
“Shall we get started?” Harry asked gesturing to the papers on Draco’s lap.
"Harry!" Draco screamed cumming again.
"There are too many clothes." Harry growled and before Draco knew it his clothes were gone along with Harry's.
"Use this if someone comes quickly cover up and don’t make any noise." Harry whispered. Draco nodded not looking up, but Harry could see blush covering his ears.
"Yes, yes yes cum in me please yes!" Draco chanted over and over cumming untouched onto his and Harry's chest. Harry bite deep into Draco's neck again as he released his seed deep into Draco's abused hole.  They collapsed onto the bed Harry still buried deep in Draco. After a minute or so Harry let go of Draco's neck and licked at the spot his bite was. Draco shivered and clenched around Harry. They stayed like that for a while  both coming down from the high of sex.
“No, I’m fine this all happened years ago…it just gets to me sometimes. You’re quite easy to talk to, it took me a month to talk to my best friend about all this and here I am talking to you about it only a few hours after I met you.” Draco said turning around. He was shocked to see how close Harry was to him, Draco could feel the heat from Harry’s body, see the five o’clock shadow on his chin, see Harry’s chest rise and fall with each breath.
The two talked, they found out that there were only a few years age difference, Draco is 25 and Harry is 28. Draco found out that Harry’s parents had died in a car accident when he was young and that’s where the scar on his forehead came from. He also discovered that Harry was raised by his god fathers, one of which being Remus Lupin one of the most respected professors at Hogwarts University. They found out that Harry’s other godfather, Sirius Black, was Draco’s first cousin once removed, but because he was gay, he had been disowned by his parent’s. Draco said he could relate to that and revealed that he was gay as well and that his father disowned him. His mother soon left his father after that saying she wasn’t going to make the same mistake again.
"God you’re so tight Draco. It feels amazing." Harry panted as he bottomed out on the first thrust. Draco just moaned in response wiggly his hips slightly. Harry smirked and looked down at where he was connected to Draco. He groaned at the sight of Draco's tight hole stretched around him. He pulled out slowly before pushing back in, faster this time. Both moaned at the feeling. Harry kept thrusting, getting faster and faster, he watched as Draco fell apart more and more.
“Look I still think he is a right brat but…I’ll give him a chance for you mate.” Ron mumbled; he didn’t really like the idea of trying to be friends with Malfoy, but he would try for his best friend.
"It’s too bad we didn't do this sooner; I actually find your company quite nice." Draco slurred leaning his head against Harry's shoulder. How they got onto the floor next to each other escaped both.
"That will be all for today." McGonagall said breaking Draco out of his daydream of seeing Harry shirtless. He quickly stood and started to make his way out of the room when McGonagall cleared her throat.
“Round two?” Draco asked spreading his butt cheeks open to show Harry his twitching hole. Harry watched as his cum slowly drippled out of Draco’s hole. He felt his cock harden and smirked.
"I'm going to push in now." Harry said tightening his grip on Draco’s hips, he was close to losing it.
“Professor! I…um…it’s so…interesting to see you again so soon… I need to go now…bye…” Draco said quickly before hurrying away. He went through the club found Blaise, who was flirting with someone grabbed him and ran to the employee only room.
"Harry!" Draco chanted repeatedly his mind having gone blank from all the pleasure. Harry had pushed a finger in, and both moaned at the feeling. Harry quickly added another finger and pumped them in and out.
"Draco...were not done yet." Harry purred into Draco's ear before slowly pushing into Draco. It was so tight and warm inside Draco that Harry almost came right then and there. Thinking of Flinch in a bathing suit stopped that from happening.
Draco swore to himself and hurried down the hallway of his old school. After he became a potion master, he was able to become Hogwarts new potions professor. Merlin knows they needed a new one. Slughorn was getting on in years and of course was more than willing to pass the reins on to Draco and go back to retirement. Draco was organizing his office and classroom when he released, he was going to be late to the sudden meeting Pro...Headmistress McGonagall had called. He quickly said the password to her office and hurried up the spiral staircase.
“Draco calm down! You are Draco Freaking Malfoy, you were voted hottest employee for year, any guy or girl would look at you even if you weren’t dress like this. There is no shame in working at this club and if he is here, he is like us Draco, this club is for those that are into or curious about the BDSM world. Calm down.” Blaise said giving Draco a little shake, “Now let’s fix your eye make up and you get back out there and do your job and while you’re at it flirt those sexy leather booty pants off and show him why you were also voted most wanted employee.” Blaise gently said giving Draco a hug.
"You're so fucking tight…I'm going to cum!" Harry groaned slamming deep into Draco.
'Must be the new DADA professor. Hope it's someone good this school is long overdue for one.’ Draco thought to himself as he greeted all the other professors.
“I’m sorry you felt that you had to give us a break Harry. We should have been paying more attention…we have kind of been stuck in our own world as of late. It doesn’t matter to me who you date Harry as long as you’re happy. If being with Draco makes you happy then I’m all for it.” Hermione beamed at Harry. They both turned and looked at Ron.
“Thanks Blaise.” Draco whispered as Blaise sat him down and got makeup out. Blaise quickly fixed Draco’s makeup and before long Draco was back behind the bar. He looked around and didn’t see Harry, he ignored the little flare of disappointment at the thought that Harry might have found someone to spend the night with and started making drinks and talking/flirting with people.
The four of them talked and joked around for a bit more before it was time for classes. They met Ron and Hermione at the doors, and they all walked to class together. For once Harry was happy most of his classes were with Slytherins.
“Yes and no. When school first started, I eat, and I could taste things but now though…food taste like nothing and I just do it, so people don’t catch on. By the way how did you figure it out?” Harry asked wiping some food off Draco’s lip.
"Oh god Draco...fuck that feels so good. Bloody hell how deep can you take it!" Harry yelled out throwing his head back and bucking his hips up. No one had been able to take him this deep before.
“I knew those two were gay for each other,” Pansy exclaimed interrupting Draco who glared at her, “Sorry continue.”
"Please...j... Just leave me alone." Draco cried backing away from the door and tucking himself between the wall and toilet.
“Harry oh goodness Harry that feels so good!” Draco panted out wrapping his limbs around Harry. Harry tucked his arms around Draco and lifted him up, so Draco was sitting in his lap bouncing on his cock. Harry gripped Draco’s ass in a tight hold helping the blonde move.
"No...this is just a...break I guess you could call it. Usually heats last for a couple of days. The only way I know of to stop one quickly is to have sex with an alpha. A potion can help end it by a day or two but the best way to end it quickly is to uh......yeah..."Draco trailed off turning a bright shade of pink that Harry thought was adorable.
Harry sat watching the doors, waiting for Draco to walk through them. He wishes he could have woken up with Draco, but he didn’t want his friends to worry about him. So, he returned in the middle of night not surprised to find Hermione and Ron waiting for him in the common room. He told them he had been on a walk and lost track of time.
"You are excused for the night Kretcher." Harry hurriedly said dragging Draco into the front room, "sorry about that...he has been serving the Black family for generations I didn't have the heart to make him leave when I inherited this place." He sheepishly said leading Draco to a couch before heading over to a mini bar.
“So, can you eat food?” Draco asked after he had finished everything.
"Draco, oh God Draco you feel amazing and smell so good. I need you. I need to make you mine. Mine mine mine." Harry chanted burying his face into Draco's neck thrusting harder and harder into him. Harry was losing himself. Draco felt so good wrapped around his cock moaning under him.
“Cum with me.” Harry said crushing his lips against Draco’s in a deep kiss. A few more thrusts and Harry was cumming deep inside of Draco, he could feel Draco’s cum spurting out between their bodies. Harry continued to kiss Draco tell he was sure he was done cumming. When he pulled back a string of silva connected their mouths. Draco’s eye’s immediately met Harry’s. Harry smiled, pleased that Draco was still following his order to look at him.
"I want this. I want you. I've wanted you for a while." He moaned as he felt Harry sink in further.  He had waited so long for this. To feel this full.
"Don’t talk with your mouth full." Harry rasped out bucking his hips up to fill more of Draco's mouth. He muttered a cleaning spell and smirked at the surprised squeak Draco let out. He leaned forward and licked at the tight ring of muscle making Draco moan which in turn made him moan from the vibrations. Harry licked at the Draco's hole tell it softened. He then pushed his tongue in and out loving the moans and whimpers that left Draco. At the same time Draco was working his way down Harry’s massive cock. Soon he was able to take all of Harry into his mouth and throat and had set up a good rhythm. Both men were moaning and groaning as they pleasured each other.
"Merlin's beard Draco you feel so good wrapped around my cock." Harry moaned grinding into Draco. He pulled out tell just the tip of his penis was inside before slamming back inside.
“Come.” Harry commanded from behind the doors. Draco slowly pushed open the doors and stood in the doorway for a moment before coming up to Harry who was leaning on the front of his desk. Harry made a small circle with his finger, telling Draco to spin for him. Draco turned in a circle slowly, making sure Harry had plenty of time to look at every side of him.
"That....that was amazing Harry." Draco whispered running his hands through his sweaty hair.
“We couldn’t have done this when I wasn’t basically naked?” Draco asked grabbing the contract and starting to read it.
"Now then," she said well sitting back down in her chair, "There are a few reasons I asked you two to stay," She began glancing at both boys before continuing, " First I don’t want a repeat of your school days. You are both adults now and the war is over. There is no reason you two shouldn't be able to at least be civil to each other. I implore both of you to remember that you are Professors now and role models for the students you will be teaching." McGonagall said with the same look she gave them as students.
“Yes, I left some paperwork in my office and was wondering if you could save me a trip and bring them to me?” Harry asked. Draco froze, Harry wanted him to go and meet him at his place. Dirty images of playrooms and sex toys ran through Draco’s mind.
"Harry, I want…no I need you inside me..." Draco groaned loudly letting go of Harry's dick with a loud pop.
*Time skip brought to you by my laziness!*
“I thought about coming here ngh in a sexy outfit… and being taken by you on your desk and…ahh fuck Harry that feels so good!” Draco moaned when Harry pulled the plug out and started to stretch Draco with his tongue and fingers.
“Harry why haven’t we had a session yet?” Draco asked suddenly putting down the books he had been carrying. He turned so his legs were on either side of Harry’s hips. Harry staired up at Draco’s face for a moment before answering.
"Why?" Harry whispered forcing himself to step away from Draco.
"Come on hurry." He whispered gesturing for Draco to come in. As they were making their way up the stairs, they heard someone coming down. They quickly rushed into Draco's room closing the door quickly. Both boys held their breath as the person walked by the door and down the rest of the stairs. Both relaxed once they couldn't hear anything.
“Never a dull moment with you around…” Draco mumbled as the doors closed. Harry laughed and grabbed Draco’s hand.
“DRACO!” a voice yelled out. Draco looked around and saw Blaise and Pansy running towards him.
“I haven’t eaten since yesterday so I’m a little hungry.” Draco mumbled his face turning bright red.
“Relax love, it’s just lube.” Harry said in a reassuring voice. Draco relaxed and enjoyed the experience of Harry’s fingers inside him. Once Harry believed Draco was ready, he reached over and grabbed the small egg vibrators he had pulled out. He pushed one into Draco and attached the other to the tip of Draco’s cock.
“Good, starting Monday, I’ll be Professor Potters assistant. Can you tie me up?” Draco asked turning his back to Blaise who quickly laced up the corset. He hugged Draco from behind.
"It’s already midnight...I should probably head to my room" Harry sighed running a hand through Draco's surprisingly soft hair.
"Please Harry I need more." Draco moaned grinding his hips up.
“You okay love?” Harry asked sitting down next to Draco and wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist.
Harry thrusted deep inside making both men moan loudly.
“I’m sorry starlight, I very much want to take that step with you, I just wanted to establish this relationship first. Forgive me?” Harry asked lifting Draco’s head from his shoulder. Draco looked into Harry’s emerald  eyes and nodded.
“Harry mate are you listening?” Ron almost yelled snapping Harry from his thoughts. He looked around and discovered that Hermione and Ron had sat down across from him. He also saw that Ginny was sitting extremely close to him.  Ginny had broken up with a few weeks after the war. Harry had discovered her in bed with someone else, she had dumped him right then and there. He had left The Burrow a few days later and traveled around the wizarding world. It was on that trip that he became a vampire. He had met another wizard named Edward and his lover Jacob (A/N: >.>) they hit off and spent the evening drinking. Somehow, they made it back to Harry’s hotel room, at some point Edward revealed that he was a vampire, which amazed Harry because it was his first-time meeting one. Harry couldn’t remember exactly what happened but when he woke up, he was a vampire. Edward apologized profusely and felt horrible, but Harry reassured him he was just as much at fault, and kind of remembers asking to be one. It was then that Harry got to drink from Jacob who was Edwards’s blood donor. Harry contacted McGonagall asking for help. He never returned to The Burrow and instead stayed at 12 Grimmauld Place. He spent the rest of the break cleaning the place up and going through things. Kreacher, who Harry had set free after the war, was more then happy to help Harry and was hired as caretaker.
“You think you are? Or you are?”
“No, stay,” Harry demanded sleepily, holding him even closer.
“What are you—”
want to kiss you. Like, even when you’re pissing me off.” He sighed, frustrated. “Actually,
In an uncharacteristic show of sympathy, Pansy allowed Harry to return to the camp on his day off to actually enjoy the experience he had been promised the day before. He got a bit choked up at the offer, his emotions already all over the place from the past week, but when he tried to thank her, she waved him off, looking bored.
check that out, then,” she said, grinning mischievously.
you?”
Harry smirked. “Because I know all of your weaknesses, and you’re easy to manipulate.”
“Indeed. Well, it’s going to be a busy day, so I’ll let you rest up. See you in the morning, Harry.”
Harry let out a breath. “Alright then.”
“Friends,” Pansy said with a smirk.
“Shut up, Potter.”
“I wouldn’t worry about it. I can barely draw a stick figure.”
Draco felt his chest clench and tried to push it down, knowing that Harry wouldn’t appreciate his pity. But then— “Wait, are you saying you used
“You’re staying?” Harry interrupted, looking shocked. He reached up and removed Draco’s hand from his hair, gripping it tightly, almost hurting Draco’s fingers with the strength of it. His eyes searched Draco’s, obviously not quite believing what he was hearing. “Draco, are you telling me you’re staying?”
Harry was filled with unexpected warmth. “That’s… thank you, Perry. I think I really needed to hear that.” He wasn’t getting rejected again. But he also wasn’t being cornered. He wasn’t sure which was more of a relief. He just knew that he appreciated not having the decision made for him for once.
Harry had very minimal experience with boats, but he was aware enough of how they generally worked to find the Floaterboat mildly disconcerting. Despite its speed, it had no motor, and therefore made no noise other than the
The floo flared, and Harry was gone. Draco sighed. He was utterly, completely fucked.
When Draco found Harry later, he was lying on his back on the balcony of his room—knees bent, hands folded on his stomach, looking at the stars. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been out here, but he supposed it must have been awhile if Draco had come looking.
“Sorry, a what?” Harry asked, lost.
, more panicked whispering, and then Draco was walking toward Harry again, his form melting into visibility as he approached. His face was doing something extremely complicated when he reached Harry; an odd mix of frustration and worry and something like pity that made Harry’s stomach drop. Without fanfare, he told Harry, “Jack’s gone.”
“I was trying to help.” Draco’s voice is small, now, and maybe a little tearful, and Harry has to force himself to breathe again, to calm down.
Draco’s answering smile went quickly from relieved to positively devious. “Glad to hear it.”
Draco shoved him through the door.
“Alright there, Harry?” He leaned against the railing as well, a bit closer than was probably strictly necessary. He was once again shirtless, and Harry couldn’t help but glance at his chiseled abs before meeting his eyes. Cormac looked extremely self satisfied at that, adjusting his position slightly to better show off his musculature.
“Really?” Perry’s face lit up.
He decided to have some lunch first to give himself time to brainstorm; it had been several days since his trip with Teddy, and he was no closer to thinking of anything. Harry had plenty of money, so there was no point in just buying him something expensive to make up for a lack of originality. And besides, he wanted to find a gift that
When the music changed, Dermot tried to claim him, but Harry ducked out of his grasp. He’d already decided that Dermot was going home tonight no matter how pretty he looked in his eyeliner; he had no interest in wasting his own time or leading Dermot on. The look on Dermot's face when Harry allowed his hand to be captured by Leela made it clear that he understood and was less than pleased, but to his credit, he didn’t try to force anything. Instead, he stepped slightly outside of their circle to dance with a handsome dark skinned man in body glitter that had been unsubtly eyeing him.
“Oh, go on, Draco.”
And so, here he was.
heard such a thing, I’d have to say you’re one to talk. Not doing too badly for yourself, are you? Now that you’re not competing against me, I mean.” He grinned mischievously, and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Harry’s right, Draco, darling,” Blaise said, sipping what appeared to be a mimosa. He was leaning against the counter, sporting a simple white sundress that might have been Hermione’s and looking beyond delighted. “It wouldn’t be fair to leave him on his own. You were, after all, the louder party.”
“Could it really have killed me?” Draco mocked, but it didn’t sound like his heart was in it. “Yes, Potter, it could have. I know you’ve always had a death wish, but I’d appreciate it if you didn’t indulge it whilst on my watch—especially for something as stupid as a hot bath.”
“I think I could figure it out,” said Luna contemplatively. Hermione grimaced.
“So a literal spitfire, then,” Draco observed, smirking.
“What are you smiling at?” Blaise asked, peering at him with interest. “You look as though you’re plotting.”
Luna wandered over and dipped a bare toe in. “That is quite chilly,” she said contemplatively, “but I think it will feel rather nice.” Without bothering to remove her dress, she sat on the edge of the boat’s deck and slipped into the water.
The class was for beginners, and Harry wasn't sure whether to be insulted or relieved. “I don’t mind at all,” Perry confessed. “I’ve never cooked a thing in my life.”
Everyone began talking at once, but before the sound could get too cacophonous, Sadiyah clapped her elegant hands together loudly three times. “Alright everyone! Let’s make a plan, shall we? We won’t pull this off if we all scatter in separate directions.”
“I thought it was time for a change of pace,” Narcissa answered blithely. “Your room is just at the top of the stairs. Once you’ve taken your bags up, come down and have a drink with Andromeda and me. Teddy’s staying over at his godfather’s tonight, but you’ll see him tomorrow.”
can convince
people, but certainly not for—
“We’re watching your back. You’re in good hands, I promise.”
He heard Draco’s muffled laugh. “Well, he was being very rude, wasn’t he?”
*****
“I’m not in love with Draco. Why would you think that?”
Sure enough, whatever commentary she’d had on Harry’s suit was dropped with a put-upon sigh in favor of a final rundown on the way the night would progress. Harry had heard it all a hundred times already, but knowing that, downstairs, the cameras were already set up and ready to go made him grateful for the reminder. He knew he was going to make a fool of himself at some point, but he supposed that avoiding it being in the very first episode would be something, anyway.
“You okay?” Harry asked, following her in concern as she backed quickly away from the table they’d been seated at.
“Ah.”
“Let me,” Hermione said, patting Ron sympathetically on the shoulder as she passed him.
“Yeah, right, I get that.” They walked on, but Harry couldn’t let it go. “But I’m asking, right? So it’s not like you’re just trash talking for the sake of it. It’s just that you all see so much more of each other than I see of you. If there are red flags, it would really help to know.”
and why was everyone just—
“Looks great,” came Greg’s contribution. “Wonder what the insurance is on something like this?”
“Oh please.” Narcissa gave a dismissive wave of her hand as Andromeda laughed. “I won’t ask much of you, but I’ll certainly need your help with some aspects.”
“I want to,” he said firmly, “but… not just yet, alright? I need to sort out this shit with my parents and the Greengrasses. Besides,” he smirked, voice going teasing, beginning to move again, skimming his fingers lightly down Harry’s back, “announcing our star-crossed love affair the day after after you started a brawl between our teams doesn’t feel particularly auspicious.”
kids,” she muttered under her breath.
When they parted again, Harry let out a breath, toying with the loose strands of silky hair at the nape of Draco’s neck that had escaped from his bun. “This is going to be all over the press tomorrow. There’s no way I’ll be able to go to your game without getting mobbed.”
“Get the fuck out of the water; Merlin’s fucking balls, how long have you been in there, you idiot?!” Firm, cool hands grasped him under the arms and began to pull him upwards.
“The universe hates me,” Draco declared to Harry’s chest, not moving from his position.
Who said that? They’re fired, whoever they are.”
“Oh. Yeah, okay.” The light dimmed a little, but didn’t disappear. “Want to just take our wine over to the sofa and talk, then?”
“Right.”
Draco cursed himself for getting so intoxicated the night before. Things had been going fairly well with Potter up until that point—the trip to London had been surprisingly nice, and their impromptu coffee had been perfectly pleasant. But then Blaise had had to go and put all sorts of
After watching with crossed arms while Draco stood and went to pull his bathrobe (which was thick and velvety and very much not tartan) out of the wardrobe, he grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the stairs.
that you won’t be the one left standing.
from all the press.”
Draco smiled ruefully, running a hand through his hair. “Apparently not.”
you’re back!” Ginny said, looking over her already-sun-freckled shoulder at them. “This lot is
Harry looked equally confused. “My cousin?” When Draco continued to look at him in bewilderment, realization crossed Harry’s face, and he laughed unhappily. “Shit, you don’t know any of this, do you? I just sort of assume people know my entire life story because of how fucking nosy the papers are.” He cringed. “I must sound so self-involved right now.” He began fidgeting restlessly with a napkin, his cheerful, open mood gone, and Draco impulsively reached out and put a hand over his, desperately wanting it back.
“Well, yeah.” Sullivan looked confused at Harry’s reaction. “He lost, didn’t he? Everything got back on track quickly enough.”
Harry, apparently, agreed. “...I could just Apparate directly from here?”
“Sounds like it. Are you okay?”
“Thanks for that,” he said with a grin once he’d caught his breath. “I feel loads better.”
“Probably off somewhere with your sense of self preservation.”
“To be fair, you absolutely could have cheered me up with poolside cocktails.”
“Harry?” Draco’s voice has gone from a bit shell-shocked to a mix of guilty and concerned.
“I could get used to freshly baked soufflé in bed,” Draco decided after letting another delectable bite dissolve on his tongue.
“Good.” When Draco had thoroughly worked the shampoo through Harry’s locks, he turned him again and made him rinse it out before moving on to his own.
on it,” Teddy told Draco proudly. “They asked him to make it special for Christmas. I watched some but I don’t go to his workshop much because he gets busy and then it's boring. He’s got better toys inside, come look!”
He could feel Harry grin. “Interesting. We’ll come back to that.” He kept moving, easing back on his knees, mouth and hands traveling down Draco’s stomach, causing him to inhale sharply. “Ticklish?” Harry asked, sounding delighted.
Harry was now beginning to look a bit concerned. “Er, because he’s my godson? We spend a lot of time together; I assumed you knew that.”
. It would end, and then it would be awkward, and when I visited again everything would be different and uncomfortable and I don’t want that. I want to be able to have this, sometimes. To come back to. Does that make sense?”
The drain of travel was only one of several reasons that Draco tried to return to England as infrequently as possible. It was certainly the excuse he generally used with his mother—but in reality, it ranked below his other reasons: namely, that he hated the person he had been when he had lived here, and he was reasonably sure that the rest of the wizarding world did, as well. It had been eight years since the war, but Draco doubted that the name “Malfoy” had gotten any more popular in that time, even accounting for his father’s imprisonment and subsequent death and his mother’s endless charitable works.
“That was part of it,” Luna agreed, and Harry wished he could sink through the floor and deep into the ground. In his peripheral vision, he saw Draco squeeze his eyes shut.
Draco was forced to reevaluate his assessment when he woke at an abominably early hour to an enthusiastic and rather heavy whirlwind landing on his stomach.
“Floo powder,” Hermione finished for him. “It tastes like Floo powder.”
“Finding out just how wasted my
Harry’s face burned. “I’m not going to—”
Harry laughs into his shoulder. “No—I don’t, do I? Between the Weasleys and Hermione and Teddy and Andromeda and… and you.”
In response, Draco leaned over and nipped a corner off the piece in Harry’s hand before he could protest. He chewed thoughtfully, licking his lips as he considered. “Perhaps a bit?”
Draco wandered down the main thoroughfare, peering in the window of Gladrags to see the newest robe styles (many hardly distinguishable from Muggle attire these days) and Spintwitches to assess the newest racing brooms (which he didn’t think looked that much better than the old Firebolts, but what did he know?). He had just made the decision to dip into Tomes and Scrolls when a solid form knocked into his shoulder, almost pushing him to the ground. He only managed to stay upright by grabbing onto the window frame of the shop.
Draco squeezed Harry’s arm comfortingly. Harry leaned back into him, still feeling a twinge of guilt.
“Alright, where would you like me to start?”
“The dragons in Teddy’s room,” Draco said, making the connection. “You did those?”
“What does that even mean?”
“I really do hate you both.”
“I suppose it isn’t the worst thing that could have happened,” Draco conceded. “Better than the alternatives.”
Draco’s face went even redder as he waved Harry off. “I’m fine,” he answered hoarsely. “Let’s go. Crew’s waiting.”
Draco reflected on his conversation earlier that night with Blaise on why, exactly, he and Harry were incompatible. “That,” he said, “is deeply ironic.”
Oddly, this course of action seemed to work perfectly well. No one said anything strange to Harry when he entered the kitchen, and no one gave him any knowing looks while he ate breakfast. He was tempted to ask Draco if anyone had seen him as he came downstairs—it hadn’t been particularly early, so he wasn’t sure everyone would still have been asleep—but eventually he decided that “pretend it never happened” would be his best bet to avoid awkward conversations with Draco, as well, so he opted to leave it alone.
Looking over the wine list, Draco tapped his wand against a bottle that looked promising. It promptly appeared on the table, nestled in a bucket of ice. Two glasses popped into existence seconds later. Harry looked startled.
*****
The match dragged on, with the blue team scoring goal after goal over William’s unimpressed head while Cormac continued to knock almost every shot by the red team out of the air. Everyone was beginning to look exhausted, and quite a few players were splattered with dirt or sporting grazes on their exposed arms or legs. The score had reached a depressing 250 to 20 when, from the side where they’d been hovering the entire game, Jack reached out and casually closed their hand around the golden snitch, bringing things to an at least somewhat less embarrassing closing score of 250 to 170.

,” he went on, “that you seem perfectly happy single, and you have an amazing career. It’s not really the same, is it?”
if you want to say hi!
, fine. Would you like to have dinner on Friday?”
Harry nodded. “His school’s mostly Muggle but there are a couple other magical kids there. Jane’s dad runs Scrivenshaft’s.”
“I apparently offended him,” Sullivan told him with a lopsided smile. “No idea what I said.”
I lie down next to him. I don’t say anything. I know, by now, that he’ll tell me what’s on his mind if or when he wants to. He doesn’t wait long, this time.
They found a low sofa in a shaded area nearby and settled in. Jack slung one arm along the back casually, just near enough to Harry’s shoulders for him to be constantly aware of it, and their eyes never wavered from Harry’s as they spoke. It was a bit of a conversational minefield; they talked freely about the traveling they’d done on their motorcycle and the cities they’d visited but they clammed up when Harry asked for details on when and why they’d been in any of them. They had a lot of thoughts on esoteric magical theory that made Harry think of Hermione but wouldn’t talk about how or why they’d gotten into learning about it. Harry tried mentioning a paper that Hermione had published during her graduate work that seemed relevant to their interests, and Jack had smiled knowingly and said they were familiar with it and found her ideas fascinating but wouldn’t elaborate.
Harry grimaced. “I mean I did apparently almost boil myself to death in the hot tub the other day, so.”
“Should I try to dance like you?” she yelled back. Before Harry could answer, she altered her movements into an awkward sort of shuffling dance that had Harry laughing so hard his stomach hurt.
Romilda, that was—”
“That would be lovely, thank you.” She gave him a brilliant smile, and Harry felt a twinge of sadness. She really was lovely, and it was easy to talk to her, but he constantly found himself thinking of her as Fleur’s baby sister rather than as a romantic prospect. Determined to at least try, he grabbed them another drink before sitting back down next to her.
“You’re still great,” Harry told him sincerely. “Not that I particularly remember how you played at school, but the Slytherin team was always our biggest competition.”
“Oh my god, stop!” Harry was giggling uncontrollably now.
. Ugh. It’s ridiculous, to be honest, and I-”
Still, at least he had the evening with his mother and aunt before having to solve that particular quandary. Although Draco had not known his Aunt Andromeda while growing up, he’d developed a pleasant—if infrequent—correspondence with her since she and his mother had reconnected. She greeted him warmly when he returned from unpacking his bags, and the three spent a pleasant hour in front of the fire with glasses of sweet brandy. They chatted amiably about Draco’s work and Teddy’s schooling and the plans for the house, and neither his mother nor his aunt seemed about to try to convince him to move home. For the first time since he had agreed to this visit, Draco felt himself begin to relax. Perhaps this holiday wouldn’t be so bad after all.
“And how are you doing now? Anyone special in your life?”
Harry just sat back, shaking his head and smiling.
Draco allowed himself a smile.
Max’s jaw dropped in shock before snapping angrily shut. “Fuck you, Draco,” he growled, swinging himself out of the bed and grabbing his boxer briefs from the floor, pulling them roughly up his muscular legs. They were
Draco turned to her, intrigued. “Have you been finding a way for them to use email from school, then?”
“Not for twenty minutes,” Draco argued, capturing his lips again.
Draco had apparated back to the house on his own, as Teddy was once again spending the night at Harry’s. He’d parted ways with them as quickly as he could manage, saying nothing but a brief “bye, then” before disappearing. Now it was morning, and he was hiding.
. Almost immediately, however, the world snapped back into motion, and everything descended into chaos. Harry didn’t know who had seen the altercation, but, evidently, somebody had, because they were suddenly surrounded by swearing, scuffling teammates. Harry tried to pull back, to rein in the madness that he’d inadvertently unleashed, but it was too late.
Draco eyed him skeptically. “Are you awake enough to stand upright?”
Harry gave him a thankful look and Hermione’s expression softened. Still, “We would have figured something else out,” she told him seriously.
He pulled back. “Okay, I think Pansy might have a bit of a point?”
“He is,” Draco agreed. “Did you move to Hogsmeade to be nearer to him? I think Andromeda might have said something along those lines.”
,” Draco swore, arching off the bed in surprise. Harry’s snort of laughter vibrated through him, but he didn’t stop, instead sliding slowly back, running his tongue over the underside of Draco’s cock before swirling it around the tip and sinking back down again. Draco groaned and bent his knees to brace his feet on the bed. Harry’s hot, wet mouth continued to move, slow and teasing, forcing Draco higher and higher but never letting him near the precipice. Draco tried to thrust upward, but Harry draped one arm over his hips, holding him in place. “Now who’s a tease?” Draco bit out as Harry did something particularly wicked with his tongue.
“Damn.” Harry tipped his head back, squinting up at the sky. “Rest here for a bit, row to the beach, and Apparate back?”
“Has someone been causing issues?” Harry asked, furrowing his brow. Gabrielle looked uncomfortable.
“You’re going to be even more distracted by each other than usual,” Ron had pointed out, and their protestations had been in vain.
. And Draco... Draco wanted passion. He wanted intensity. He wanted someone who would challenge him, question him, make him work for it. He wanted chemistry so intense that casual touches left goosebumps and sex was something he craved, not just something he used for a quick endorphin boost. He wanted
“You and Draco knew each other prior to the show, yes?”
Blaise laughed. “Well then. We’re down to your top ten suitors. Are you looking forward to your next group date?”
“I know you said you skipped Hogwarts because you were already in a dance program, but I’ve been meaning to ask, how did you end up learning magic? I sort of assumed that you were Muggleborn, at first, but you’re a natural with a wand, and you’re obviously living at least partially in the wizarding world now or you wouldn’t have known about this show or who I am.”
He wasn’t ready to face
At the back of the room, a door was propped open, leading to a space that seemed to be something between a courtyard and an alley; it was well lit and didn’t smell of trash or piss, but it wasn’t particularly welcoming, either, without any sort of tables or places to sit. Harry leaned against the wall, breathing in the cool night air for a moment, before looking down at his companion.
“That is
“For fuck’s sake,” muttered a voice to Harry’s left that he was almost certain belonged to Draco.
The Wasps were struggling, still off-kilter after the fight and subsequent suspensions the day before. Falmouth should have been an easy win for them, as the team was close to last in the current rankings, but—in contrast to the Wasps—they seemed to have taken heart from yesterday’s drama.
Malfoy hummed in agreement, one corner of his mouth twitching upward. “Inconvenient, really. Things sounded so promising, earlier.”
Teddy wanted to go to Diagon Alley for his Christmas shopping, and so Draco found himself back for the second time in four days. Shopping with Teddy was, however, an entirely different experience than shopping with his mother.
“Ron!” Harry cried as soon as his wand dropped, but Parvati was already by his side, countering the spell, and Ron’s body relaxed almost immediately.
Despite the corny line, Harry couldn’t help but feel hopeful as they made their way back toward his temporary home. Maybe he wouldn’t walk away from here single and frustrated after all.
The British Quidditch League was small enough that, in order to keep the stadiums filled, a good number of friendly matches were held between tournament games. These were an opportunity to mix things up a bit—to try new moves, sub in reserve players, and play for the love of playing. Or that was the idea.
He registered a brief flash of surprise on Harry’s face, as though he had been expecting more resistance, but he moved forward without hesitation, cupping a hand behind Draco’s neck and capturing his lips.
“Oh, yeah, Leela and I are quite close. Perry, too. Like I’ve said before, there’s not much for us to do, so we end up spending a lot of time together.”
Harry gave an odd, sideways sort of smile. “Right. Well. See you, then. Bye, Teds!”
Here’s where your E rating comes in, so if you were reading
“Why not?” Teddy asked, interrupting Draco’s spiraling thoughts even as he echoed them.
stop.” Draco closed his eyes for a moment. “I did not need that mental picture even a little bit,” he sighed. Still, he couldn’t help glancing over his shoulder in the direction that the ginger had retreated. George was leaning against the bar, talking animatedly to—
“More or less.” Blaise twinkled a wide, white smile at her. “You’ll all be locked inside the room behind that door—” he gestured toward a heavy wooden door to his left “—where you will find an array of furniture, books, art, and other objects. As you explore, you’ll discover a set of puzzles that need to be solved, as well as a number of clues that will help you solve them. Once you’ve completed them all, the room will unlock. If you can finish within the allotted hour, we have a special treat for you tonight. Everyone clear?”
Harry wanted to laugh, but he didn’t have the energy. With a groan, he let his paddle fall flat across his lap. “I need a break.”
“I won’t let Pansy use that part. We’ll go with the room-breaking-down story and just use footage from the first bit, and then fill the rest in with tonight’s cocktail party.”
Fire, Draco decided over the following week as he and Harry barely left each other’s company outside of their office, came in a great many forms. Sometimes it was the licking, teasing flame of new and interesting places where chocolate could end up on a person’s body. Sometimes it was the red hot blaze of pinning your new boyfriend face down against his own mattress and fucking him torturously slowly until he begged for release. Sometimes it was the warm glow of going flying with your young cousin that you hardly knew, staying close to the ground and watching his godfather pretend to be distracted so that he could catch the practice snitch they’d been chasing, or the bright spark of watching someone else’s excitement as they introduced you to something Muggle that you were unexpectedly delighted by.
“We’re friends,” Harry said defensively. “We hang out on off days every once in a while.”
“I tried,” Harry said, looking down at his hands but not pulling away from Draco. “Unfortunately, that didn’t stop strangers from stopping me in the street to comment on things that they never should have known in the first place. The press doesn't bother me as much now, but it’s only because I make an effort to be as boring as possible.” He finally looked up, his eyes crinkling slightly in the corners as the beginnings of a smile returned to his face. “Also, Hermione threatened to sue them for so much money the paper would fold if they invaded Teddy’s privacy, so they won’t risk coming near me when we’re together anymore. I may be a public figure, but he sure as hell isn’t.”
is how much
Leaning over, he pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple before sitting up completely with a groan. “I should shower.”
“I apologize for wanting to ensure that you didn’t have to scrap an episode,” Draco drawled sardonically at her, but Harry noticed that he was a bit pink in the face.
he thought despondently.
“Mister Harry, will you play dragons with me? Mister Neville does the voices all wrong.”
His mother’s words—her plea that he at least think about the future—followed him constantly. Was ‘content’ enough for him? Would it always be enough? But he wasn’t sure he was ready to think about ‘always’ just yet. Especially when, despite his thoughts on family and friends and community, he was afraid that his reasoning might be clouded by his feelings for Harry.
Harry opened one eye halfway and smirked cheekily. “Can I come?”
“I can grab some beers,” Greg offered.
“Actually, I’m pretty sure you owe them a fruit basket. If they’d kept their mouths shut, Perry never would have convinced me that I had a chance with you.”
Still, the idea of uprooting his life so suddenly was nerve-racking. Draco was not a risk taker; he was a man of routine, of certainty. He’d spent so many years building what he now had. He’d created a space for himself, and he’d done it on his own. He’d learned how to function in a world that wasn’t the one he’d grown up in; he’d worked hard, climbing up the ranks at his job, and he’d saved his money so that he could rent his nice flat and buy his nice suits and forge a life that didn’t rely on inherited wealth or family connections. He didn’t know if he was ready to give that up.
Harry laughed. “Well, my mum’s family came from a pretty disappointingly bland suburban British neighborhood, so I don’t really feel the need to visit there, and the Potters seem to have been here for centuries, from what I could find. But I dunno, India might be cool.”
Malfoy looked him up and down and smirked. “Forget something there, Potter?”
I end up needing far fewer of them than I would have guessed.
“What about the power going out at the club right when Sullivan kissed you, then? And yes, I was watching, and no, I really didn’t want to admit that, but you are extremely hard to get through to so I’m willing to humiliate myself a bit. More. Merlin.”
“And I’m sure you don’t know
“I can do Monday,” Draco agreed.
“That makes sense.”
Draco laughed. “I suppose he is.”
“Well,
“Yes, I’ve been working with them for... seven years, now? I was lucky enough to be recruited while they were on quite a hiring streak, and I turned out to have a knack for it, so here I am.”
Draco smirked. “Don’t worry, you’re not
Draco didn’t answer. Harry watched him, feeling inexplicably hurt.
“Harry,” Perry said, sounding tired. “He wants you. And you want him.” He grimaced. “And I want to commiserate with the rest of this bottle of wine and then maybe have someone modify my memory so that I can at least
“It’s been a minute. I didn’t know you were back in the country.”
“I think we should talk,” Sadiyah told him.
It was Narcissa’s turn to sigh. “Darling. I loved your father, but he was— well, you know how he was. There was no reasoning with him. We did what we had to to stay safe. Nobody blames you for what happened, not anymore. You were a child.”
Draco, who had been heading toward the door, turned back to look at him. “Nothing in particular. Why?”
“Um, wow. Okay,” Harry said, stung.
, and—
He was met with whoops of excitement from the contestants, making him laugh and relax a bit. He let himself be pulled into the group, doing his best to move with the music, unsure if he was managing but supposing that it didn’t matter all that much. Sure, the whole wizarding world would be able to watch his awkward movements repeatedly if they wanted to, but it wasn’t like he was known for being anything approaching graceful. Soon enough, it mattered even less, because he was being passed from partner to partner and was able to move along with them, not needing to figure out the beat of the music himself.
Harry flicked him in the shoulder, but his smile returned. “Eight okay? There’s a place over near that coffee shop I took you that’s pretty good. About half a step up from the Three Broomsticks, I’d say, but they’ve got a pretty decent menu.”
“Oh for—” Draco cut himself off before he swore (he’d gotten more than one lecture from his mother about the language he used in front of Teddy) and let out an exasperated sigh. “I should go deal with that.”
“You can’t call the Master Suite,” Harry said, ignoring the exchange. “First of all, I’m not even sure if there
“Good. Well, enjoy the rest of the party.”
They perused the menu in silence for a few minutes. Despite the exclusivity of the restaurant, the food wasn’t pretentious; Harry had mentioned that he had a wide palate but no patience for the tiny portions and often-bizarre dishes featured at many high-end establishments, so Draco had made sure to take his preferences into account when selecting their venue. His efforts proved worthwhile as he observed the pleased look on Harry’s face. Once they’d made their selections, Draco poured them each a glass of wine before settling back in his chair, contemplating the man seated across from him.
“Shit. Did I hurt you? Are you okay?”
“Hey yourself,” she told him, smiling. “Shall we?”
“What?!” Harry’s mind managed a bizarre double-tracking, one half completely taken aback, the other flashing back to Draco’s earlier teasing.
Putting on his poshest, most dismissive voice, Draco broke the until-now-comfortable post-fuck silence. “Well. It’s been fun, but I think this whole…
Greg settled the peel on the table and turned to give Pansy a disapproving look. She looked studiously away from him. “Pansy Parkinson, I pulled your head back from that fire myself. You apologize to Ron.”
Draco huffed but didn’t say anything else.
“Well, I think I might like to do a bit more hiking,” Hermione said, before biting her lip and adding sheepishly, “well, some walking in the woods, anyway.”
The synchronous movement of half a dozen shocked faces turning in his direction reminded Draco vaguely of a group of flamingos moving in unison. He had to bite his lip not to laugh.
Eschewing caution, he decided to go to the Manor. In a brief moment of foresight, he donned his invisibility cloak before flying toward Wiltshire, letting the cool night air soothe his frazzled nerves. It was well into the evening, so he was hopeful that Draco would have escaped his parents’ clutches by now and returned to his rooms.
“Yes, well, he’s Potter.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, eager for more than Draco’s fingers. “Ready.”
“Yeah.” Harry thought back hazily to his time with Perry. “Yeah, it was good at first. I got to know Perry a bit better. He seems really great.” Remembering their conversation cheered him a little. The day hadn’t been all bad, he supposed.
“Gross,” Harry said, but he was grinning ear to ear.
“I wasn’t! I was… oh.” He looked a bit embarrassed, and Narcissa’s eyes twinkled in a way that Draco thought could almost be called mischievous. “Right. Er, Malfoy, would you mind if I called you Draco?”
“Not a word of it.” Draco took a deep breath and let it out in an audible
“Luna!” Harry wrapped his friend in a tight hug. “I didn’t know you’d be teaching today.” He hadn’t realized just how much he missed his friends, but the sight of Luna—with her paint and glitter streaked dress, floral print wellies, and plethora of paint brushes and pencils sticking out of her thick, frizzy braid—welcomed him like a warm bath on a cold day.
“The elves let you?”
Harry wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs before taking Draco’s hand. “Here we go.”
“What, like one of us drowning in that giant bathtub?”
“Don’t be a stranger,” Blaise told Harry with a wink, biting his lip suggestively. Harry shook his head, laughing as he wandered off toward his friends.
It was awkward at first, but bit by bit, it had all begun to come together. Greg Goyle and Ron had found a mutual love of sport, joining up to learn Muggle football from Dean Thomas and playing with an ever-changing roster on the weekends. Blaise Zabini and Luna Lovegood had formed an odd sort of mutual fondness, their polar-opposite dispositions—Luna’s dreaminess and Blaise’s suave persona, Luna’s disinterest in sex or romance and Blaise’s ability to charm and seduce a new witch or wizard every week—balancing each other somehow. And Harry and Draco… well.
“Harry forgetting doesn’t really surprise me, actually; we all know he hasn’t gotten laid in years,” Pansy opined. Harry gave an inadvertent squawk of protest, but she continued without pause. “Draco, however, is a filthy hypocrite.” She smirked, and he scowled. “Just how many times
“Because, you idiot, he’s the new seeker for the Appleby Arrows!”
When she finally instructed him to break his pose, Harry grabbed the robe off the floor and wrapped it back around himself. He hazarded a glance over at the ‘students’, only to have Jack wink at him. He wondered if it was possible to actually spontaneously combust from embarrassment.
Harry studied the piece, turning it over a few times, pale blue to brown cork to pale blue again, before handing it back. “Why haven’t you done that one yet?”
Harry had reassured him that it wasn’t about him, they’d exchanged a hug that involved the requisite amount of manly back-slapping, and then they’d all headed to the kitchen for food.
“Nope, no more talking for you.” Draco stood, brushing invisible lint off his thighs. “I’ll be off. Enjoy your bath. And Potter?”
Eventually, despite numerous setbacks, they made it to the trail. Harry hadn’t been particularly attracted to the idea of hiking, considering that most of the time he’d spent in woods in his youth he’d been running for his life, but he had to admit that it was beautiful once they got going.
“Because he’s even more of an insecure idiot than you are.” When Harry looked back up at her, she actually looked almost sympathetic, which was a bit of a disturbing expression to see on her usually-smirking face. “Look. Nothing’s ever 100% certain, but I would bet anything that he wants you just as much as you want him. I’d… hell. I’d stake my own relationship on it, and I know you know that I wouldn’t risk Ginny for anything. But you need to do something before he gives up and moves on. No one’s willing to wait forever, not even Draco.”
Draco thought about the Manor, and how hard it had been for his mother to finally let it go, even after everything that had happened there. “Yes, that makes sense.”
She shrugged. “Not much to tell, really. I work in the Muggle Liaison Office at the Ministry; it’s a bit boring, but it pays the bills.”
They walked on stage, making their public debut to a veritable chorus of applause, whistles, and cheering. Harry grinned and ducked his head while Draco smirked beside him, looking extremely pleased with himself. After exchanging handshakes with Blaise—which felt fairly silly to Harry, given how long they’d all known each other—they settled into the leather chairs opposite him.
“I hog the blankets,” Leela told him seriously. Harry snorted.
“Shut up, you know what I mean.” He paused. “Wait, did you just call me impressive?”
“Of course I am!” he answered immediately. “I’ve worked hard for the life I have there.”
“I did.”
You shouldn’t. God, you shouldn’t. There are so many reasons: past, present, and future. Obligations and expectations. Roadblocks and risks and consequences. One wrong step, and it will all come crashing down—and you know, you
“That’s fantastic,” he said, rather than voicing any of those thoughts. “Thank you. I could definitely use some interaction with the outside world.”
Their lips meeting felt like coming home. Harry had thought that he was very out of practice at being kissed, that that was why it felt so odd when Sullivan and Perry had done it. But as Draco made a quiet, pained sort of noise and leaned into him—kissing him harder, more deeply, his hands making their way to Harry’s waist, fingers gripping tightly, pulling him in—Harry knew that practice had nothing to do with it. He slid his hands into Draco’s silky hair, tugging him even closer, opening his mouth to him, inviting him in. Draco’s tongue slipped past his lips, and Harry thought hazily that it felt long, long overdue.
“And,” Perry cut him off, speaking more loudly, “when you were upset, he was always there to comfort you, right? And before you ask how I know that, remember that whole ‘the crew is more gossipy than Rita Skeeter’ thing.”
“I don’t get it,” an extremely intoxicated Ernie MacMillan had told them, squinting at them in confusion.
“Come on.” He guided Harry to his room and helped him get undressed and into a pair of soft pajama bottoms.
Draco looked down again, feeling overwhelmed with emotion. “It’s gorgeous, Harry.” He swallowed thickly. “It’s perfect.” Harry smiled, looking relieved. Draco cleared his throat. “Well, go on, open yours, then.”
“Hmm. I’ll just have to teach you, then, won’t I?” She gave him a flirtatious look, and Harry couldn’t help but notice again how pretty she was, her wide blue eyes glinting in the candlelight.
The next day at work, Draco didn’t so much ask Harry to go out again as tell him that they’d be having dinner the next night. Luckily, Harry didn’t have any plans, and he seemed more amused than anything at Draco’s superior attitude. Ignoring the way he was obviously biting back a smile, Draco told Harry he would pick him up at seven. He refused to tell him where they were going—partially because he knew that Harry loved being surprised, and partially because he was still ironing out the details.
As Draco launched into an explanation of the variations between Muggle and magical pool, Harry found himself zoning out a bit, watching his expressive hand and arm motions. Malfoy was such an animated talker, he thought. He always had been, of course, but now that it wasn’t part of malicious reenactments of Harry’s worst moments, he’d developed a great appreciation for it. There was something captivating about his energy, about the way his long fingers gestured to illustrate his words, almost drawing pictures in the air. His face lit up when he was explaining something, aglow with the pleasure of sharing his expertise. It was beautiful to watch, even if it did sometimes send Harry’s mind spiraling into thoughts of what those hands would be like in other situations. Especially now, when he was fondling that damnable pool cue. Fucking hell, did he even
“And she’s my niece. Sort of.”
“I’m going to murder you,” Draco answered. Harry smirked and kissed him before lining himself up and finally, finally pushing in.
Despite his suspicions, the open declaration made Draco go warm all over. He remembered, for a moment, his own words from earlier in the evening. “You can’t control your feelings, so you might as well enjoy them,” he murmured under his breath, smiling wryly. Fuck it.
Birdsong and a quiet clattering of dishes
And, yes, he still wanted to kiss him, rather a lot if he was honest, but it was fine. He could do this.
“Not what? True? Possible?”
“Yeah, that’s the boathouse.”
“God, seriously. I’m probably one of the only kids who ever saw that as a selling point.” Harry went on to tell her a bit about discussions he and Hermione had had around her own experiences versus his, which segued into their thoughts on Muggleborn integration programs in general, and so forth until he could barely remember where the conversation had started.
“None; although, in my defense, I can’t see why I would have been on the alert. I was a producer, for Merlin’s sake! I just assumed—naively, apparently—that that meant I was in the loop on all of the goings on. But my
“I promised Teddy I’d take him Christmas shopping. And he wants to get something for you, too, so actually you aren’t invited after all.”
"Malfoy...I would like to talk with you do you have some time?" Harry asked squeezing Draco's arm.
“Ginny stop it! I do not want you back. I will never want you back. I realized two things after we broke up. One that I was only with you because that’s what everyone expected from me, and two that I’m gay.” Harry angerly said still trying to pull his arm away. Ginny was really getting on his nerves.
“I wanted to wait tell we were comfortable as just boyfriends before I started our master and slave relationship. I’m sorry love I should have told you I wanted to wait a bit. I’ve made you worry, haven’t I?” Harry asked rubbing up and down Draco’s arms.
"Sorry I'm late!" Potter said in a rushed voice, his hair looked messier then usual and Draco's fingers twitched with a need to fix it.
Harry collapsed onto Draco both panting hard trying to catch their breath. After a few minutes Harry rolled off Draco tell he laid next to him instead. He felt Draco roll and curl into his side. Smiling he wrapped his arms around the pale man and kissed the top of his head.
“Oh, come on Harry, I know you miss me and want me to take you back.” She purred kissing his cheek suddenly.
“I want to get to know my teaching assistant a little bit more, that is if you have the time.” Harry said pouring another cup of tea for them both. He also grabbed a handful of candies and held it out to Draco. Draco took them with a blush his hand felt warm from where Harry’s fingers had brushed his palms.
"I'm not done yet." Harry sighed grabbing Draco's hips and flipping him over. He pulled tell Draco was on his knee’s face down on the bed. He grabbed Draco’s full ass and spread them apart so he could see his tight hole.
"I'm gay?" Draco interrupted raising an eyebrow at the blushing man.
“That was amazing.” Draco whispered, closing his eyes. Harry could feel Draco’s body relax.
"Yes, and you want to know something else?" Draco asked inching his face closer.
“You must be…Draco Malfoy?” Professor Harry asked looking at a sheet in front of him as he stood up from his desk and walked around it.
“Draco I’m close.” Harry grunted out looking down at Draco. He looked so good kneeling in front of him, sucking his cock with such excitement, like he couldn’t wait to taste Harry’s cum. Harry threw his head back and came into Draco’s ready and waiting mouth.
“Yes, your whole day is free to do whatever or whoever you want.” Harry said grabbing some bacon and giving Draco a wink. Draco sat there for a second before flopping back down into the fluffy pillows, almost knocking the tray of food off the bed. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a day to do whatever he wanted.
“Do you mean it?” Harry asked, hoping that Draco did.
“Feeling better?” a deep voice asked, Draco whipped around and there on the other side of the bar was Harry.
“Fuck Draco you feel so fucking tight around my cock. Your slutty little hole is squeezing me so tightly, it’s sucking up my cock so well.” Harry moaned grinding into Draco. Harry pulled out, grabbing Draco’s legs he folded Draco in half and then slammed back in.
“Oh, shut it,” Draco mumbled before continuing, “like I was saying we talked,” Blaise snorted “and we discovered that we both like one another so we started dating and yes Blaise we did fuck are you happy now?” Draco asked as Blaise pushed a finger though the circle his other hand was making.
"You feel so good Draco." Harry whispered pushing all the way in. It didn't take long for Harry to start thrusting. Draco moaned and groaned a mixture of "oh God Harry yes" and "fuck me harder". He let the haze of his heat take over his mind.  He could smell Harry's and his scents mixing and it was driving him further and further into insanity.
He didn't sound fine Harry thought taking a deep breath the sweet scent filling his lungs and clouding his mind.
“You remember.” Harry chuckled, tucking a piece of hair behind Draco’s ear. Draco shivered at the touch, tilting his head slightly to try and feel more of Harry’s hand. He felt Harry’s fingertips trail down his neck before disappearing.
"Lead the way." Draco growled letting Harry pull him up. They quickly made their way up to Harry's room laughing and giggling like schoolboys the whole way. When they finely made it to Harry's room they flopped onto his bed.
“Well why else would you be in this type of club.” Draco said leaning forward on the bar. He smiled when he saw Harry’s eyes flicker to the mirror behind Draco that was showing a perfect reflection of Draco’s ass.
“Its fine why wouldn’t I have lunch with my boyfriend, and after lunch I’ll take you up to my room and have my real lunch.” Harry purred flashing his fangs at Draco, making the pale boy shudder. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand gave Draco a smile and pushed open the doors. A hush fell over the Hall as people noticed them. Draco could hear whispers and could feel people watching them.
“I think that just about covers everything. Think you can handle it?” Harry asked, watching as Draco tucked all his stuff neatly into his bag.
“Wait he pushed her away?” Draco asked looking at Pansy with wide eyes.
“How do I look?” He asked standing up and doing a spin for Blaise.
"Kretcher welcomes Master Potter back home and is pleased to welcome Master Malfoy, Kretcher is always happy to serve a member of the Black family." The house elf growled out bowing to the two men.
".......thank you...." Draco whispered handing Harry's cloak back to him. Harry took it and faintly smelt the scent his mind was quickly recognizing as Draco's.
“We can talk in my office.” Harry said placing a hand on Draco’s lower back and guiding him through the house. On the way to the office Draco was able to get a peek into some rooms. They passed a living room, a kitchen, and a dining room the rest of the way all the doors were closed. They stopped in front of two doors that reminded Draco of the entrance to his father’s office.
“I’ve never wanted anything more.” Draco said pulling Harry’s head down for a kiss. The two kissed as Harry finished pushing into Draco. When he was fully inside, he paused for a moment to give them both time to adjust.
“I..ngh…prepared myself in hopes that my….ngh…confession would be accepted.” Draco moaned out as Harry grabbed the plug and gently pulled. Draco was flipped over, his ass up and his face down in a pillow. Harry kneeled behind him playing with the anal plug that Draco had been so nice to provide.
Suck it continues in this new chapter Bite Me, lets see what happens between Draco and Harry!
They both laughed for a bit before calming down back into silence. Harry looked at Draco and Draco looked at Harry. Their faces slowly got closer together. Then their lips touched softly. Then harder. Draco let out a little moan when he felt Harry's tongue ran across his lips. He opened his mouth and moaned again as Harry's tongue fought with his to see who got to explore first.
"Bloody fucking hell!"
Harry was hungry and the food in front of him wasn't what he wanted. He wanted blood and he wanted it now.
About forty minutes later Draco was on his way to Harrys place. He shifted in his seat, he was starting to get nervous, he was about to go to the living place of the man that had been plaguing his every thought.
"What are you going to do now?" Harry asked taking another step forward.
“No, you’re not, you loved being with me and you want me back just admit it already Harry.” Ginny said turning Harry to look at her and kissing him. It was then that Harry heard Draco. He pushed Ginny away and turned to look the doors. There stood Draco with tears in his eyes, he flipped Harry off and rushed out the doors.
Draco just nodded and put the now empty cup down on the coffee table. He couldn’t believe he told his boss about his family drama but it was interesting to find out that they had a connection before even meeting.
“Oh, I don’t want to take up anymore of your time.” Draco said blushing, he quickly grabbed the pile of wrappers crushing them in his hand. He hadn’t even realized he had eaten all the candies.
"Well since you asked so nicely." Harry began thrusting, trying to find Draco's sweet spot.
Draco slowly woke up, he looked around and was surprised to see that he was in bed. The last thing he remembered was soaking in the bath with Harry after their wonderful session.
“Oh yes, thank you.” Harry said letting go of Draco and going over to his desk. Draco watched as Harry started to look through the papers. He watched as Harry’s glasses slipped down his nose and he watched as Harry absent mindedly pushed them back up. Watched how he ran his hand through his hair. Draco took a deep breath, he wished he had a strong drink, he needed all the help he could get.
“Yes master.” Draco responded following Harry into the room.
“A lot has happened today…I was really hurt by what happened earlier because I could have sworn that before I fell asleep last night you said…you said that you loved me, but then I saw Ginny kissing you and I started to question why you would even consider being with me. I was on the wrong side of the war and I did things that…that I’m not proud of…and I will always have this horrid mark on me so why would the savior of the wizarding world want to be a with a ex death eater?” Draco sighed trying to hold back tears. He did not want to cry in front of Harry.
"Is that right." Harry whispered feeling the blush crawling up his neck.
“WOW!” Harry exclaimed looking around his office. In the few minutes it had taken Harry to rinse the dishes and put them in the dish washer, Draco had picked up all the books and put them away and had cleared his desk off.
"I see...so...is your heat over then?" Harry questioned a blush spreading across his face as he remembered how amazing Draco smelt.
“What was that all about?” Pansy asked as Draco sat down across from her and Blaise.
"Draco...what's wrong?" Speaking of his father.
“Sorry for the mess.” Harry mumbled sheepishly cleaning up the plates and cups, “Have a seat I’ll be right back.” He said as he walked out of the office. Draco looked around and sighed, there was no way he would be able to seat down in this mess. He put his bag down and started to put the books away.
“I was hanging on his every word; my knees were getting weak Blaise. When he tucked my hair behind my ears and lightly touched my cheek, I almost lost it. I’ve never been affected by someone this much Blaise. Even when I first met him his voice gave me goosebumps.” Draco mumbled leaning his head on Blaise’s shoulder. Blaise wrapped his arm around Draco and gave him a squeeze, “What am I going to do Blaise?” Draco asked looking up at his friend. Blaise kissed his forehead and didn’t respond; he wasn’t sure what to tell Draco. He had never felt what Draco was feeling and therefore had no advice. Draco sighed; he was so fucked.
"How will we get there from here without running into anyone?" He asked as Draco gently maneuvered him off his lap.
“You want this?” Harry teased pushing just the tip in. He held Draco’s hips in place so he couldn’t push back.
"What are you doing here Malfoy?" Harry asked stepping closer.
"Oh god Harry yes. I'm yours, I'm all yours." Draco screamed cumming all over his and Harry's chest. Harry lost himself, biting into Draco's neck, emptying himself into Draco's tight hole. Draco laid there stunned mouth wide open but nothing but gasps coming out. He felt so full. He could feel Harry's knot stretching him, feel his teeth sink further into his neck.
"Hermione is with him he'll be fine. Would you like to come over to my place where we can talk privately?" Harry whispered putting his hand on Draco's knee. Draco looked down at the hand and back up at Harry's face. Was Potter flirting with him? He hoped he was. It took a while, but Draco realized years ago that  he never actually hated Potter. He in fact loved him.
"Harry please I can’t take anymore. Move!" Draco begged moving his hips around. Harry groaned shit...he had to keep it together otherwise he was going to come before doing anything.
"God your so fucking sexy." Harry moaned shifting them tell Draco was on his hands and knees with Harry behind him.
“I understand Master.” Draco responded quickly. Soon things got quite again, and all Draco could hear was Harry moving about the room.
“I didn’t know talking was the knew code word for fucking all day.” Blaise joked.
"Oh God Harry fuck ugh ahhh so good!" Draco rambled grabbing Harry's hair, "Please Harry, I need you, please. Please I'm going to cum HARRY I'M CUUUUUUUUMMMMMING!" Draco shouted, cum splattering across his chest a bit even hitting him in the face. He laid there dazed and panting. He could feel Harry moving around on the bed but was too stated to see what he was doing. He then felt a tongue lick up his cheek removing the cum that landed there.
“Harry, mate it would have been awkward but if you had told me Ginny was giving you problems, I would have helped you out somehow. You’re my best mate.” Ron stated reaching over and patting Harry on the shoulder.
Harry stood there shocked. Malfoy had said please, twice, and from what Harry could tell through the door was crying. There was also the fact that he didn't deny being an omega. Harry looked at the stall door and banged his forehead against it. He heard Draco cry harder. He quickly covered his face with his robes and backed away from the stall door finally realizing that not only was Draco Malfoy a omega, but he was also an omega in heat. Harry rushed out of the bathroom taking deep breaths to clear his head. He cast a strong locking spell on the bathroom door. He then leaned against it before sliding down to the floor. Tonight, was going to be a long night.
“Come on love lets go wash up.” Harry said picking Draco up off the bed.
“Does this mean what I think it means?” Harry asked looking Draco over again.
Draco banged his head on his desk. Was he looking too much into their kiss? Was it just a drunken moment never to be repeated? He hoped not...he enjoyed their kiss quite a bit. Maybe he just needed to get laid. He looked at the stack of essays he needed to grade and sighed. Might as well drown himself in work. Just as he was about to start there was a knock on his office door.
"I know, I want to." Harry sighed licking the tip again and tasting precum. He slowly lowered his mouth around Draco's dick. He hallowed his cheeks has he felt Draco's hand run through his hair before grabbing tightly. He moaned at the feeling and started bopping his head. The grip Draco had on Harry's hair tightened and he pulled gently, Harry moaned again and moved faster.
'What the bloody hell happened?' Draco thought to himself trying to shift but discovering his body ached too much to even move. He had never been fucked so hard he passed out.
“I love you.” They whispered together. They then spent the whole day together just messing around. That night they went to the club and for the first time Draco went as a slave not as an employee. He proudly wore his new collar that now had a chain that attached to a matching cuff that was around Harry’s wrist. Letting everyone know that they were Master and Slave.
"WAIT!" Draco yelled panic setting in once again. He knew his heat wasn’t done, that he was just having a break. He didn't know how long this break would last either, “...I...I need your...help. My heat isn't done. It's on a break of sorts. I need to get to my room....can you...can you help me do that? Please...Harry." Draco felt sick...he had only ever asked his father or Snape for help, but they were gone, and Draco was desperate.
He hadn't been a vampire for awfully long and the only other people that knew he was, was McGonagall and Hagrid. She was the one who informed him that he could substitute human blood with animal blood. So, he would go into the dark forest and find a rabbit or something. He would then give the carcasses to Hagrid who would cook them or feed them to one of the magical creatures he took care of. Harry usually went into the forest once or twice a week. He of course would eat what he could at meals, but it was quickly becoming difficult to do so. Everything started to taste of...well nothing. As Harry made his way to the dark forest, he was unaware of the sliver eyes that watched him. Hours had gone by and Harry had only managed to find three rabbits and two mice. They weren't very filling, and he was getting hungrier by the minute. He suddenly smelt blood. It wasn't extraordinarily strong, probably from a scrap or a shallow cut. Someone was in the forest with him, and they smelt delicious. Harry had tried human blood only once. The vampire that changed him accidentally (a story for another time) had a... donor would be the best word for it. A person, usually a witch or wizard but Harry was told it could be anyone willing to do it. Most commonly though it was the vampire’s spouse or lover. As an apology to Harry, he allowed Harry to drink from his donor. Usually, blood was taken from the neck and, he was told, that it tasted best when the vampire and the donor were engaging in sex. Harry chose the wrist and kept his clothes on. The blood still tasted amazing though. This blood though, made Harry’s fangs throb, he had never smelt something so good, so wonderful, he could feel his mouth salivating.
“Yeah, that would be great.”
“Hey,” Draco said, rising from his desk to catch him before he passed by completely. “Haven’t seen you today.”
“Don’t worry, she hasn’t given in entirely to my charms,” George told Draco with a smirk of his own. “Can’t pin this one down, can you? But she’s a hell of a good time.”
“Yeah, of course,” Draco said immediately, and he suddenly felt completely helpless. “Can I—” he hesitated, and then put a tentative hand on Harry’s slumped shoulder. “Do you need anything?”
“My apologies. You are still the poshest of the posh bastards. William Williams III has nothing on you.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Admitting defeat?”
Love is a rollercoaster. Sometimes literally. Featuring a trip to a theme park, Draco having strong opinions on color theory, and the non-sexual kind of water sports.
“And what about you?” Harry asked her.
Andromeda gave a wry smile, immediately surmising what—or who, rather—the interruption had likely been. Her look quickly turned probing, however. “So, you wouldn’t have stopped him?”
Draco looked up at the sky and prayed for patience.
“Not yet. But it’s still early.” Draco’s expression turned serious. “Speaking of, good job on booting Romilda. I’ve already chewed Pansy out for allowing her on the show, so you needn’t repeat the effort if you don’t want to.”
“Your sexual orientation doesn’t prevent you from having children,” Narcissa went on. “Many couples use surrogacy or adoption, you know.” Draco felt his eyebrows rising and tried to school his expression. His mother’s viewpoints on propagation of the bloodline had certainly evolved since he’d been gone. “Societally, things aren’t as they were when you were younger,” she continued, either missing or ignoring his reaction. “The Wizangamot voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriages several years ago. Even the Muggles here have legalized homosexual partnerships to some extent. You could easily find a husband and have a child through less traditional means. It’s not as though I’m asking you to go against your inclinations.”
“I can’t—”
Draco sighed. “I was coming to see if you’d eaten anything. Luna said that you would probably need food after posing for that long. Apparently, it’s harder on your body than one would imagine.” Harry nodded, grimacing at the still-present pain. Draco shot him a disapproving look. “I’ll have the elves send a pain potion up to your room. Can you make it on your own?”
“Hello,” Draco answered bemusedly, rubbing at his shoulder. His assessment of Harry Potter as ‘compact’ had apparently not been unfounded; the man had the density of a rock, if the force of his buffeting was anything to go by. “In a hurry?”
“You doing okay?” Harry asked him anyway, still concerned.
“I mean, I do have a chess set around here somewhere, if you’d prefer,” Harry countered, calling his bluff.
“Your playing has gone downhill since school, Potter,” he taunted ineffectually. “It’s a good thing you can coast by on your name, or you’d have been unemployed ages ago.”
“Of course I do!” Harry was only exaggerating a little bit. He had been kayaking exactly once, several years ago, for a very short amount of time at a free event in London. Still, he knew the basics. “It’s not that hard. You get in, you paddle.”
“Trust me, I’m plenty embarrassed about it,” Perry said with a lopsided smile. He didn’t mention the bit about Harry’s past, for which he was thankful; there had been a few articles over the years where one reporter or another had managed to dig up the dirty details of his upbringing, so they were fairly common knowledge at this point, and he appreciated that Perry didn’t push him on it.
“Mother. I appreciate your wish to see me happy. Truly. But I’m going back to New York in three weeks. I would prefer that you not try to matchmake while I’m home. I’d rather spend the time I have here with you and Andromeda and Teddy. Alright?”
“Sadly, no.” Draco spun in his chair a bit to face him. “Max and I have parted ways. Do put me down for a plus one, though.” Colin gave him a pitying look before making a mark on his clipboard, excusing himself, and heading off to harass the next unsuspecting colleague.
“Yes, I was very adamantly informed that I was not to change,” he answered, smiling.
“I’m not hiding,” Harry said, petulant, but he didn’t sound convincing to even himself, so he was unsurprised by Draco’s disbelieving snort. He sighed. “She wanted to talk about my
“No need, I’ve got it.” Harry smiled again, heading off toward Teddy’s room.
“Yeah.”
Their business apparently concluded for now, the pair spent a few minutes making inconsequential smalltalk before Draco made his way back to his borrowed office. He looked around the space with new eyes as he settled back in front of the computer. Would he want to work here full time? The space was just as nice as the New York office, and he liked the idea of working with Chris again. And London wasn’t all that different from New York, when it came down to it—it was older, and cleaner, but the energy of it was much the same. He’d probably be as comfortable living and working here as he was there.
A whispered question against your ear
“Same to you,” she told him, and left with her head held high.
“Ready?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded.
to be here to watch this place burn to the ground’.” He smiles, thinking fondly of his godfather as he looks around at the ash and brick and empty space. “He would have thought this was hilarious, honestly. He hated it, too. He hated it
Harry shook his head in confusion, but then heard Ron call his name from across the way and got up to go see what he wanted, quickly forgetting the odd moment.
Draco gave a put-upon sigh. “I suppose not. Although I do have a suggestion, should you get the urge to repeat the experience.”
Eventually, everybody returned from their various adventures, and they had a nice dinner together before deciding that they wanted to do one more bonfire before they had to return to reality. They sat around the fire sipping on their last eclectic selection of beers as the sun set, the air cooled, and the chorus of crickets and other nighttime creatures began.
“I guess.” Harry lay in silence for a while. After a few moments, he felt a tentative hand brush a piece of hair off his forehead. The softness of the gesture made him feel like crying.
“Please, sit.” She settled behind her desk and indicated two stylish leather chairs across from her. Draco eased himself into one, coffee still in hand, and crossed one leg over the other. “Calpurnius told me you would be in the country. I suspect that he knew you'd show up here sooner or later. How is your trip going?”
“For fuck’s sake.” Pansy stomped across the room to the wardrobe, from which she pulled something that would have looked like a referee’s outfit, if the referee in question was very proud of his thigh muscles. And arse. And possibly cock. Harry’s eyes went wide.
with one another. He’d even talked at some length with Neville Longbottom about the trials of being the last heir in a long line of purebloods with no interest in reproducing, Neville tipsily admitting that he had never had much interest in romantic relationships and was perfectly happy with his kneazle and his plants, despite his grandmother’s growing frustration.
“I said. Fuck. Off.”
“What, consulted my therapist first?” Harry gave Malfoy a half smile, but he doubted it was particularly convincing. He was already starting to feel embarrassed about his little meltdown, and he winced internally at the thought of how everyone else would react. “Merlin, this is humiliating.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The whole house was hostile towards me.”
“Ah. Thank you for the warning, Luna; I’ll let him know.”
As he walked away, he could hear his father’s voice rising in indignation, followed by his mother’s soothing placation. He didn’t bother to focus on what they were saying. He’d hoped that, after the war, his parents might have reevaluated their priorities, at least somewhat. He sighed—he supposed that had been a bit naive of him. Oh well. If this season went well, and he decided to stay, he would find a place of his own and move out. They could scheme all they liked, he thought wryly, as long as he didn’t have to listen.
“I see that,” Draco mumbled, still trying to get his bearings. Why on earth was Harry Potter standing in his bedroom doorway? “Hello, Edward.” Draco’s head dropped back onto his pillow in resignation as he decided that attempting to understand his current situation was a lost cause. “What time is it?”
The interview continued, but Harry’s mind was elsewhere. He hadn’t honestly spent much time envisioning futures with any of these people, he realized, and he wasn’t really sure what to do about that. Later, as he was drifting off to sleep, he resolved to do some actual thinking on his day off.
“Fuck’s sake, it’s even in the papers here?” Harry complained, dropping the day’s
Rose sniffled into his chest. “Really?”
“Just a date, though,” Potter stated firmly as Draco turned back toward his desk. “This isn’t me signing up for a relationship. One date, just to see how it goes.”
I have no children. I rarely interact with children. I am honestly not at all sure that I can write children. But I love Teddy anyway, so hopefully you will, too!
Andromeda laughed. “Is she really as bad as all that?”
Using what little courage he could muster, he ventured into a Muggle shop and, with the help of a young woman with a pink mohawk and a hoop through her eyebrow, purchased a small jar filled with a vibrant blue.
Shaking his head, Harry lugged his own bag into his room, dropping it heavily onto the floor and looking around appreciatively. The room itself was simple, most of the space taken up by a massive king-sized bed (which Harry grudgingly had to admit
Harry quirked a lopsided smile at her. “Probably for the best, honestly. I have a few friends who aren’t all that interested in Quidditch, and the rest of us drive them barmy when the season gets going. Although, I suppose Hermione appreciates it when we actually play and get Ron out of the house for a while; she can barely ever get one-on-one time with Rose, otherwise. He’s pretty enthusiastic about the whole fatherhood thing.”
All he had to do was convince Potter to date him for real.
“I did not! Where?” Draco leaned closer to the mirror and then turned to Harry. “I didn’t, did I?”
“I can’t argue with that,” Harry sighed. “Let’s head out.” He lowered his voice, leaning closer. “I could really use a drying charm right about now.”
Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder. “We knew it was complicated. We figured you’d let us know when you were ready. Besides,” he added, smiling wryly, “from a professional perspective, it was really better if I didn’t
Bidding the professors farewell, Draco went to check on food levels once more before beginning another lap of the rooms. He’d seen Harry in passing several times, but hadn’t managed to spend any time with him yet, constantly getting pulled into other conversations and looking around to find him gone. He had just made it to the living room when Luna Lovegood appeared at his shoulder. “He’s over by the windows,” she told him, uncannily observant as ever. “You may want to rescue him; I always warn him about the nargles, but he never listens.” She waved her hand toward the upper sash of the window, where a sprig of mistletoe was lying in wait.
Sullivan stepped back. “Alright. I’ll give you a minute. I didn’t mean to—”
“It says here that it adjusts its size depending on how many people are using it,” Pansy said.
When the three of them were settled at the table with breakfast, Harry steeled himself and said: “I need to tell you both something.”
“Don’t mention it.” Sadiyah gave him a wry smile. “Really.”
Pansy ignored the question. “So, you’re going to actually try on all of these dates, yes? You can’t half-arse this on me.”
He could feel Harry’s grimace against the side of his head. “Now-ish?”
“He threw the remote the first time he showed up on screen,” Harry remembered, grinning.
Potter’s eyebrows rose just a fraction, but he didn’t comment, which Draco found himself oddly pleased by. “Okay. It’s a date.”
“I know.”
“What did you get Harry?”
To Harry’s relief, once they got underway, the ride was fairly uneventful. He didn’t often drive at home, and even then, it was on the opposite side of the road and not at nearly the speed that Americans seemed to prefer on the highways. Other than Ginny teasing him over his white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel, Pansy’s whinging about leg room, and Blaise’s constant playing with the radio, however, everything went as smoothly as he could have hoped for.
remember that? You weren’t even there!”
“Thanks,” Harry murmured and felt a light touch on his arm before the footsteps retreated.
By the time the Healers brought Draco back to consciousness, his leg and torso were dressed in some sort of lightweight material and the pain had receded substantially. “Still alive, then?” he asked groggily, directing the question at no one in particular.
