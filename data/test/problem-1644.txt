They attach the letters and send them by owl, hoping they’ll arrive in Zabini’s hands at some point.
Harry’s about to call it off, tell Draco not to worry about it and move on, when Draco starts talking again.
The gate lets Ron and Hermione in, and they make their way back up to the front garden, where Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Charlie, George, Ginny, Bill and Fleur are already waiting - having gotten ready much quicker and let in by the gate.
“I will. Just… not yet. We’ve got a little time left, he’ll probably wake up on his own. And he's not my
“You're- you're tall, you could be intimidating, maybe.” Malfoy says, glancing up at Harry and waving his hands around uselessly. Harry smirks.
“Won’t need it.” Draco says, undoing his trousers. “Though you should take no judgement of my stamina from this.”
“Er, I know how to ride if you’d like me to teach you sometime.” Mr. Weasley offers, scratching behind his ear.
“In their defense, they told me they rarely saw you.” Malfoy says mildly. “But yes, essentially. Ginny is part of my pickup Quidditch group.”
When Harry stops to pick up some shirts, he catches Draco pulling his notebook out of his trouser pocket, then writing something in it. He hadn’t even realised Draco had brought it to begin with.
Harry squirms for a moment, but Draco can see the moment he’s in. He shifts Draco a little to arrange the robe around them as sort of a blanket, then pulls his hard prick out of his pyjama bottoms.
“No, you’re not in trouble.” Harry takes his hand, rubbing. “I’m only concerned for you. I think maybe you can’t remember because your head is full of rules.”
“I may be a sore loser, but you’re a sore winner, which is worse.” Malfoy grumbles, trying to step on the backs of Harry’s trainers as they walk.
“Merlin’s tits, Draco, that was your first blowjob?” Harry asks a while later. Draco nods. “Holy shit.” Harry whispers.
Harry looks between their blurred faces, unable to read their exchanged glances without his glasses on.
“That’s good. Maybe I should do something to help raise awareness. Merlin knows I’m not using my platform for anything worthwhile.”
“I very much doubt McGonagall would take points for late assignments post-war, if Hogwarts is even still standing by then.” Harry points out.
“What- what happened?” Harry stammers, struck dumb as a tall Malfoy strides forward with awkwardly short steps, his short hair falling into his eyes.
“Such a shame, about Fred. Losing a sibling prematurely is so difficult.” Narcissa says, more quietly.
Everyone’s eyes dart to him, and he withers a bit at the sudden attention. Harry takes the hand closest to him.
“From what I understand, there were guards there constantly.” Harry says. “And it’s likely you were in heels.”
“Yeah. Really cute. If I tell you how cute you are, will you eat a little bit more of your breakfast?”
While Mrs. Devoe was calm and easy, nearly everyone else second guessed every one of Draco’s spells, making him explain himself or risk being attacked by St. Mungo’s security.
“I just… for a long time there, even with me, you did things because you thought you had to.” Harry says. “And sometimes, it seems like the decisions you make only hurt you, so I want to remind you that you can make different decisions now.”
“What? Oh, you mean you didn’t get to eat for four years? And you survived that, so why can’t you go a day?” Harry thinks out loud.
Harry wakes to birds chirping outside and sunlight filling the room. He frowns, looking around the unfamiliar room.
“How’s life, Ron?” Draco ignores him, taking a bean from Harry’s box and throwing it. Ron catches it easily, amusement coloring his features.
Malfoy slips the camisole over his arms, having split it down the centre front, then lines it up again and magically puts it back together.
The pulsing violet and magenta lights along with the pounding music keep the energy high in the club. The pleather seats are tacky and the servers are scantily clad, but the atmosphere feels so strange that Harry barely gives them a second glance.
“I imagine it’s hard to remember, it was very dark. But I’ll never forget how excited Charlie got when his little brother asked for his help in smuggling a dragon from Hogwarts.”
So Draco leans in again, holding onto the back of the chair to keep his balance. It’s still strange. He kisses a bit more deeply, and Neville doesn’t object or pull away. Draco runs his tongue along his bottom lip, and Neville doesn’t really react.
"Sure. Alcohol is one, but obviously, as I've been trying to stay away from it, it's not an option for me. Sex is another."
“He got in trouble for using magic, too, so I doubt he would’ve no matter what happened.” Jack says. “And I broke the charm on the ankle band, so he could get it off.”
“I got lunch with her and Teddy a few weeks ago, told her I’d seen you here and she asked how you’ve been.”
“Meredith, looking as stunning as ever.” He compliments her, kissing her hand gallantly. “And it’s good to see you, sir, I’ve heard great things about your work.”
“You’ve spent the better part of two decades avoiding me. Why is that?” Harry asks, setting his hands on the desktop and leaning over the desk.
“Probably. I’m lucky, I was able to defend myself. They shouted at me as I was leaving and I used my real voice to snap back, which just sort of gave credence to what they were calling me. They followed me out to the Apparition point I was going to use, so I jinxed their cocks and Obliviated them before I left.”
“Sit down, Harry.” Ron says with a slightly condescending smile. “Do you remember how things went with Cho?”
Harry laughs again, imagining the toilet walking away when someone goes for a piss, or the sink spraying them in the face.
“There isn’t one. I’m not sure why she wasn’t named after a star. Both her sisters were - Bellatrix, who’s dead now, and Andromeda.”
“Yes.” Draco says, taking out his pen and making a note. “Ron is bigger than me. He could hurt me very badly if he wanted to.”
Eventually, he nods to himself, packs up the record player and levitates it back out of the kitchen and up the stairs. Harry doesn’t follow, but goes up to the bedroom once the kitchen is cleaned up.
Malfoy waves his hands in a strange pattern and the magic keeping him against the wall disperses in a shower of sparks.
that.” He grunts, and Draco smiles, enjoying the feeling of getting Harry riled up for a change. He shifts up, crawling in between Harry’s thighs. He reaches out boldly to rub at the bulge in Harry’s pants.
Draco takes some time, but stops crying eventually, and Harry kisses his forehead and hair as he catches his breath.
potions specifically for your clumsy arse for the next two hours.” Draco says, holding up the ingredients case. “I just bought these with my own money because the reserve budget is a
Harry uses Zeus’s distraction to get closer, then kicks him in the groin as hard as he can. Draco flinches, but Zeus crumples to the floor.
He grabs Harry’s off the bench instead, and Harry half thinks he might be in for a hex by his own wand, but Malfoy only uses spells to clean their utensils.
"Well you are sleeping with multiple other men now so you're at least making some progress." She says. "And you haven't got any heirs so there's another point. You've got a tattoo with their worst nightmare on it, and you're working for society's outcasts here on the reserve."
“I have. Typically, working with couples, the primary focus is the relationship. With you, I am helping you each work through trauma independent of your relationship.”
“If I leave here, one of my bosses might find me and take me back. The house keeps me safe.” Draco parrots what Harry had told him the first few days he’d been here.
She reminds him of Ginny, strangely, with long red hair and freckles. She’s also very sweet and witty with Draco, acting as if she’s known him for ages and not just a few weeks.
Now is a prime example of that, as Draco has gone out of his way to find Potter as if he’s eleven with a mean, snitchy streak a mile wide.
Once the door is shut, the hangings on Dean’s bed open, and Harry makes an annoyed sound when he sees the blurry shapes of Dean and Seamus, Seamus against the headboard and Dead sitting between his legs, back to chest. Both still starkers.
“I have no idea. He’s been… heavily abused though, has a lot of injuries. He’s malnourished, barely been able to keep anything down. I’m bringing him to my private healer tomorrow.”
When Ron gives Harry a questioning look, Harry shrugs, his eyes moving over Ron’s shoulder to see Malfoy already looking at him from the Slytherin table.
“You’ve got my actual cock against your thigh and you think my hand smelling faintly of lube is gross.”
Lightening the touch, Harry uses just his fingertips to trace the outlines of muscle in Malfoy’s back.
Idk, I've always had a soft spot for Charlie/Harry and add in some Harry/Draco bickering,, I might need to put this pairing in a real story
“My favourite thing about Draco and Harry is their love.” Luna says without preamble. Draco grins at Harry, holding out his hands. Harry takes them.
He’s seen how Potter would watch as Draco stretched at the flat. He knows Potter would waste no time in folding Draco in half just to see if he could - which he can.
Harry lifts Draco’s trembling hands to his lips and kisses each knuckle. Draco’s heartbeat gets faster every second that Harry doesn’t
“Oh? What was Friday night? And what did he apologise for?” Blaise asks, running his fingers over Draco’s shirt along the longest scar that cuts across Draco’s left nipple.
Draco breathes out heavily. He's never been able to cast a Patronus, but he doesn't want to get into more trouble.
“The tall bottles are bubble bath, when you use them they’ll make your skin smell nice. I’m really not sure what the bath salts are for, but I think they would also smell nice. I thought since you’ve enjoyed the shower, you may like a few things which will make it more fun.”
“Yeah, I know. But Marion said nothing can go in your arse for six months, and it’s barely been two.”
“Er, fairly strong, why?” He said, trying not to cringe away from where Ashe was clutching his arm where he’d finally relented and put it through Potter’s jumper sleeve.
“How would you know? You’ve kept all your friends, how would you know what Ron and Hermione decided or why?”
Harry is surprised when Memory Draco turns to look at his companion and Memory Harry’s face isn’t washed out like everyone else. If anything, his eyes are brighter green than they are in real life.
Harry pulls the cloak off when they’re only feet behind the back ranks of their side. A second too late, Harry recognises Colin Creevey.
“Potions is the closest subject, I know plants.” Malfoy shrugs, putting far too much sugar into his tea. “It’s only for today, Neville Longbottom will take over tomorrow.”
“Okay. We’ll go to a muggle shop first to get you some pants, then some shops in Diagon Alley to get you some other clothes. Is that okay?”
It’s awkward again, and Harry’s glad they don’t pass anyone either of them know, as he doesn’t really want to explain what’s going on. It would feel insensitive no matter how he worded it.
Lucius deflates a bit, like he’d thought maybe today he would find out what his son got up to all day, but he just nods.
far more powerful than a child should be and given almost free reign over this house… I blame centuries of selective breeding and my parents’ lack of discipline. Anyway, when I was four, my mother hired a classical dance tutor, hoping it would tire me out. It didn’t, so she hired a second tutor, ballet. That wasn’t enough, so she hired more and more until I was nearly always being taught
Without looking back, Draco pulls Harry away, into a different room where they’re alone. Draco turns around, twisting into Harry’s chest and sobs.
“It is. Red Austrian roses, white chrysanthemums, lemon blossoms and ivy.” Draco says, like he wants Harry to remember. Maybe Harry will use the flower book to figure out what Draco’s telling him after all.
I'm so shocked at how well this story has been received! I treasure all your comments, they've been getting me through all the shit going on at work lately and I suspect I would've dropped this story a while ago if I hadn't had all of your constant support. Thank you sincerely :)
“Wouldn’t you if you had tits like this?” He says, cupping them and lifting. Harry’s mouth goes dry. Malfoy laughs again, turning back into the closet.
“Adams, one of the partners, would go anytime they thought he might be difficult. Leo did at first, but he’s a squib, so Adams had to take his place to use some sort of… will-altering spell. Like an Imperius but not illegal.” Jack says. “He wouldn’t do it sometimes. Tried fighting and running from one of the houses, I heard. The bouncers would talk. He was missing from the floor for a long time after that first trip.”
“Potter, surely you know an underage witch or wizard can mask their use of magic if there’s at least one credentialled magic user living there too. I’ve got two credentialled parents, so I could use all the magic I wanted.”
Harry moves closer, sitting uncomfortably across from them. He tells them everything Seamus had said.
Lucius doesn’t make an appearance this time, and Harry sneaks inside to the passageway without seeing anyone.
Draco’s eyebrows lift, and he gently lifts the needle, flips the record and plays it again. He looks at Harry in astonishment.
Harry places the crown on top of Draco’s hair, then wipes the tear from Draco’s cheek. Draco laughs softly, turning to lift the crown he made for Harry.
“I didn’t have my wand ready.” Draco says softly, looking upset. “I can’t get rid of them forever if I don’t use my wand. I only get… confused, but- but more.”
“Gender doesn’t matter to me when I’m dating someone. I could date girls, boys, anything in between or neither.”
Draco, Greg and Astoria went back to their house after dinner, and Astoria proposed an all-night campout in the living room rather than planning on going to bed when they all knew they would stay up talking anyway.
If Draco rides his cock well, he gets to lay with the handsome man on the bed. It’s the warmest Draco gets to be now, and he’s greedy for it.
“Yes. Okay.” Draco says, sitting on the couch and closing his eyes. He inhales deeply for a moment, then blinks them back open. He smiles vaguely at Harry.
“You were worried?” Draco asks. “I was only sitting in a room, I’ve been in far more danger before.”
The song ends to wild applause, and the trio onstage blows kisses into the audience before disappearing offstage. Harry sees Malfoy's eyes land on him and his heart stops at the blond's wink. Goyle in the next seat laughs and elbows Harry's side.
“Yeah, alright.” Harry mutters, heading to the door, where Malfoy backs into the hallway like Harry might change his mind if Malfoy so much as glances away.
“Not typically, but I do welcome the opportunity if it presents itself. I’m very fortunate that two of my best friends are in a very lively open marriage.”
“Do we have a rule that you have to be hard?” Harry takes Draco’s hand, rubbing his knuckles. Draco inhales shakily.
Malfoy exits their room wearing makeup again, which he hasn’t done in a while. Harry pauses the video mid-sentence to see his outfit.
“Yeah, like, if I were to fuck one of my friends, I don’t think I could look her in the face without just remembering what it was like.” Prott explains.
Over the next couple days, Harry graciously ignores the problem, knowing full well Malfoy’s only doing it to get a rise out of Harry.
“Yes, I’m bloody hard, you’re sitting on my lap!” Harry yelps, flushing. With great effort, he keeps himself from flinching away as Draco works.
His head turns towards Harry, and he crosses the small distance, dropping down onto his elbows as he reaches out, his arse high in the air and his hand reaching out. Harry’s breath catches as the cool, delicate fingers brush against his, and he realises with a start that he’s holding out a Galleon as well.
“I’m not sure. It depends. He might be, if his body is able to process it all by then. But he might not want to be touched for a while, we’ll have to see. And even if the drug-induced touch aversion is gone, he might just not want to be touched as much or at all. Everyone reacts differently.”
Draco doesn’t say anything, but evidently he’s snapped out of the trance now that the vision has played out.
“Listen, I moved to Belgium at eighteen for my healer programme.” Draco says, pausing until Potter looks up. “And I didn’t keep in touch with my friends for the first two years. Not even Greg.”
So to preface this - it's all as Draco experienced it as it happened. He doesn't necessarily remember any of it by the time he's with Harry, but he may remember some things here or there.
“Extremely.” Ron says without hesitation. “I’ve hoped every day since the war ended that you’d find your way to being happy.”
“Doesn’t matter. We’re here now, and I love you and by some miracle, you love me. I need nothing else, it’s already more than I could’ve dreamed.”
“Oh. Well you have all these friends you’re close with and sexually compatible with but you haven’t said anything about ever dating anyone.”
The figure twists slightly, setting aside the glass vials and casting a wandless Stasis over everything.
He doesn’t respond to Harry, who pulls him close as usual. Draco misses the feeling of Harry’s skin against his, but feels foolish for wanting to take his shirt off. He’s not an option for Harry, never has been. He should keep his emotions to himself so he doesn’t ruin their friendship.
“I don’t recognise any. In theory, there should be some from the first trip, given they’d be in our year.”
It’s quiet for another beat, and Draco hunches in on himself more, likely feeling anxious about having disrupted the flow of conversation, so Harry jumps in.
“I’d trust him to save my life in an instant. I would not trust him to put me under, or tie me up, I don’t think.”
“In their minds, they have good reason. But my priority is for patients like your husband to make a full recovery.”
“So pathetic. Whining like a little bitch.” Draco hisses. Zeus’s eyes widen. “Oh, nothing? Can’t feel anything anymore?”
Harry hums, holding his arm open when Draco moves to sit beside him. He feels rather smug when Draco rests his head on Harry’s shoulder.
The wand goes flying so far with his and Malfoy’s shared power that the Death Eater only stares after it.
With a sigh, Narcissa Summons the elves back with some fancy tart, and one takes Malfoy’s mostly untouched dinner away and another replaces it with a generous helping.
“Position.” He whispers, nearly crying. His legs are shaking. His shoulders heave with every shuddering breath.
Harry cranes his neck to see the Twins poised to rip off a second piece of paper from a large notepad and Malfoy sitting on top of the table in front of a spread of various rich people snack foods, like grapes and cheese. Harry’s stomach growls.
Draco waits with bated breath, along with everyone else, including Prott, whose cheeks were still stuffed with bread.
“Yes?” Harry asks sarcastically. Draco puts his paw back down, meowing up at Harry but not entering.
“I meant it, though. If you want to stop and never speak of her again… I’d respect that. No questions asked.” Harry says softly.
“I came to be pampered.” Draco shrugs, deciding to let Greg and Astoria share more should they want to.
“You’re always so chatty in here.” Malfoy mutters as they duck into the passageway behind the portrait. “Shush.”
Harry acknowledges him vaguely, resting his head against the back of the sofa and watching the clouds drift across the closest window.
I've noticed while editing these chapters that because of the way Draco talks, there's a ton of really short back-and-forth dialogue, and I've kept tags (Harry said, Draco said, etc) to a minimum. But there's also not a lot of narrative direction (Harry said while chopping carrots, Draco said, sitting and covering himself with the blanket, etc).
“Of course not, no one who’s been hit with it is.” Harry says lightly. “Anyway, you’re not going to go back to… you know, hexing people in the halls and insulting them?”
“Yeah, except I got on the team a whole year before you, and your father bribed Slytherin to let you on.”
They break apart a few moments later, and Meredith/Malfoy hisses at Harry to kiss her hand as is ‘customary,’ and Harry does so, his lips pressing lightly against the ring-clad fingers.
“Do you even have to ask?” Theo says, standing and setting his hot chocolate mug aside with the tea and coffee mugs that had appeared in his hands.
“No. I needed to get things in order, my inherited affairs, and to get things set up so I could live here again. But after that, it was mostly curiosity.”
“This is for comfort. If you’re feeling upset, you can come and sit like this if you like. I won’t let anyone hurt you.” Harry promises. Draco sniffles quietly against his ear, resting his pointy little chin on Harry’s shoulder.
“Your hair’s tickling my chin.” Harry complains, trying to get it to lay flatter against his head and away from Harry’s skin.
“Yeah, sorry. I heard you and Mum made up though, that’s good.” Ron says cheerfully, holding up a mug of coffee to Harry.
Potter’s eyebrows lift, and just when he’s about to say something, Drake comes in whooping with Knox shadowing her.
“He snuck up on me.” Draco says a bit irritably. “I was brewing with my back to the door and he boxed me in at the counter.”
Whoooo... covered a lot in this one, it's a bit on the long side already so another cliffhanger! My sincerest apologies!
Eventually, the night comes to a close and Harry falls asleep in his familiar Grimmauld bedroom, head pounding in the silence.
“You also knew a girl, I never knew if you two were dating or not. Her name is Pansy Parkinson. I’m not sure what’s happened to her, I haven’t seen her since the battle either.”
“If you can make it to England for sex, I think you could add on an hour-long appointment beforehand.”
It was past midnight when Draco appeared in the doorway, clutching at it, smudged with ink and looking terrible.
“Would you like to go to bed? I’ll bring you to a room.” Harry offers, standing. He holds out his hand, which Malfoy stares at for a second before taking it and getting up as well.
“I believe he was under the impression that I intend to steal you away from her with my masculine wiles.”
When he spots Draco, he says something to the auror he’s with, who frowns, but comes up to Harry and Draco.
Today, for example, they were brewing Amortentia in potions. Draco got his done reasonably quickly despite the condition of his hands, and Slughorn praised him soundly, thrilled to have a promising student once more.
It’s… probably not very ethical, but neither is bullying Neville over something small that went wrong in his Transfiguration homework, leaving him with bat-like ears.
He was right, Malfoy isn’t here willingly. He’s drugged, or perhaps under the Imperius curse. Maybe both.
“Meredith made the front page.” He says, dropping the paper on Malfoy’s desk. He takes the offered cup of tea before looking at it.
His cell in particular had a leak. It would flood to his knees if it rained hard enough and wouldn’t drain for days. Days of standing, pressed against the furthest wall from the leak and terrified to sleep lest he drown. He still hasn’t managed to take a bath since he’d been released.
"Alright, mate, you have a lot to tell me about." Neville said as they sat across from each other in a booth.
“I doubt it, I just don’t know anyone who is. Besides, I figured I could trust you. You’re very good at keeping secrets.”
asked me to get in with him, for the record. And nothing sexual has happened between us, I’ve told him several times that it won’t. Unless you count...” Harry trails off, face getting redder.
Harry can’t help but feel a bit better that Malfoy clearly doesn’t prefer being in close quarters with Goyle to Harry.
“Wow, so-” Malfoy gestured vaguely. “In that one alcove, that was your first kiss in what, two years?”
Draco receives a response almost right away, and Harry wonders if Blaise carries parchment and quills around all the time just in case Draco owls him.
It’s overwhelming, honestly. It feels as if someone’s cast a Muffliato on him and there’s buzzing in his ears.
“Do you know how much blood you can lose before you pass out? I do.” Draco says, looking unconcernedly at his arm dripping blood slowly. Harry hates how casual he’s being, how little he cares about himself, his life.
When Mr. Weasley starts talking about some muggle thing or other that he’s been working on, Draco listens with rapt attention.
He seemed like he was everywhere just like he’d been in Fourth year, taunting Harry with those blasted Potter Stinks buttons.
Drake is fed popcorn pieces by each person in the circle and has to say ‘thank you, Daddy,’ after each one.
He’s also unusually clingy for a shower, barely allowing Harry to let go of his hand for a second before taking the other or looking so forlorn that Harry gives up washing himself until Draco’s done.
“Yes. Answer all your questions if I’m comfortable. Don’t wear glamours. Wear clothes around other people. Eat slowly. Don’t jump you. Don’t use magic. Don’t leave the house alone. Tell you ‘I don’t like this’ if I don’t like being touched or talked to a certain way. Tell you if you break the rules. If I’m not in trouble, you hold my hand and rub my knuckles. My punishment is a hit on my wrist. Crying is good. Touching is good. Hugs are good. Tickling is fine.”
"Would you mind never petrifying me again? I have the absolute worst crick in my neck, I can't look left at all. I'm too old to stay in one position for that long."
The man talks the entire time, about how little and pretty Draco is, how he likes the way Draco’s face is smooth and hairless, how he likes to fuck such dainty little babies. When he cups Draco’s cock, the touch feels so, so wrong.
Marion situates Draco to lay on the table, and Harry keeps hold of his hand. Draco’s eyes dart up to him.
“You’re from the states, Prott, so you don’t really understand what a rude question that is.” Brutus says mildly, fumbling the cap to his bottle, which takes everyone’s eyes off Draco for a moment.
That had been a good night - he’d been unbelievably sore for well over a week and wanked to the thought of it frequently for a long time after.
“Your own comfort is not secondary to everyone else’s. You were raised in such a way that you’ve grown to make do with what you have, or what you’ve been given. Take those pages, for example. From everything you’ve told me, I would not be surprised if you’d run out of paper, you would have used a grocery bag or a page from a book.”
Harry’s once again live-streaming, today’s video being about thestrals and how creepy they look, when Malfoy makes a squawking sound from the kitchen.
There are several aurors who look like they’re interested in the answer, but mostly they’re all giving him looks of disdain or open distrust.
“Considering all the incest in your family,” he says as he reads, “it's a bit concerning that you're wanking right after receiving a letter from your father.”
He’s done far sooner than he normally would be given that he hadn’t washed his hair and didn’t have to wait for Draco to pick an outfit, but knowing that Draco wouldn’t be done for awhile, he went outside for a walk around the yard.
“I did not do that on purpose.” Draco mutters, sort of crawling across the circle to where Potter has only gotten more smugly amused.
before, but now I am, thanks.” Draco drops his face into his hands. “I’m afraid... that Harry won’t want to be seen with me anymore.” He admits quietly.
“Remember when the Inquisitorial Squad caught all you Gryffindors? Umbridge was going to use the Cruciatus on you before Granger stopped her.”
“Let me know if it is and I’ll talk to him about it. I should probably get going, I don’t know if he’s okay alone.” Harry rubs the back of his neck.
I like you.” Malfoy finally proclaims, swinging his arms open wide. His voice shakes. “It’s so much more than that. I look at you and... and it terrifies me, what I would do for you. What I
“Yes, and aphrodisiacs, mind- and will-altering drugs, that sort of thing. It’s likely good that most taste bad.”
Ngl not completely satisfied with how this chapter turned out but it is what it is ig lol. this is a sort of ~turning point~ though so we'll see how things go from here!
It’s not immediately clear, because Peeves is flying around overhead throwing dung bombs at him and blowing raspberries.
Pansy disappears into the crowd of mostly Slytherins dancing in the living room, and Harry leans down to talk near Draco’s ear.
“No, it’s not. The one in England’s a house, though. The old Black place, where Sirius grew up, not- not your mum’s.”
“That’s true. Maybe he’s got a new project going. It’s been a few months since the last wrapped up.”
He strokes his fingers along Draco’s hip, and it tickles but he forces himself to stay still. It seems like it takes
Breathing heavily as the adrenaline seeps from his body, Harry leans against the wall and looks at Malfoy, still disguised.
“Why do you hate him?” Malfoy asks sharply, leaning forward in his seat a little. “He’s fine. And anyway, you’re a
“Fuck.” He swallows heavily. “That’s… that’s hot. I- You can’t wear that to the- to the thing, it’s too- it’s too hot.” Harry croaks.
Which is how they found themselves put on the most high profile case Harry’d been privy to in his several years on the force.
Harry’s wandering hands find one nipple and pinches it lightly, sending a jolt of sensation directly into Draco’s spine, and he arches up into the touch.
“I know, darling, but this really won’t take long. And you know you’ll feel better afterward, you always do.”
“Are you familiar with Maledictions?” Draco asks, already knowing the answer. Devoe shakes his head. “It’s a blood curse that not only harms you, but can harm generations down from you. Do you have any children currently?”
“I’ve an idea of how to help you understand yourself better, but I’ve got to do something first. Can you wait here for like… twenty minutes? I’ll be back.” Draco asks.
He pulls on his clothes from before and climbs out the window, suddenly very glad they’re on the first floor.
“I- I suppose, yeah.” Draco agrees. ‘Working the floor’ seems like a weird way to phrase it, but maybe he’s just unused to this sort of place’s customs.
“Of course I do, that’s never stopped me before. Though, this dress is difficult to move quickly in, I might end up just tearing it so I don’t get myself or you killed.” She says.
The patio tables are still empty, and Draco is surprised to see two mugs of coffee with stasis charms already set out across from each other at one of the smaller tables.
"He's never mentioned that to me. Does he write to you about it still? Or was it just the one time and continuing funds on a regular basis?"
“Naturally.” Narcissa says, gathering the fallen hairs from the hairbrush and dropping them into the bin by the sink. “Darling, sink.”
The great doors open then, the sound familiar to Draco, and he stays in his place, relaxed against Harry’s warm, strong body.
“I’d like to know more about Jack.” Harry says. More specifically, if this Jack knew what was going on, why did he never do anything to get Draco out of there? From what he’s heard, Harry understands that Jack wasn’t a part of the cruelty at least. Draco felt safer with him.
“I’ll see you on the other side, my dear.” Draco says dramatically, sweeping Harry into his arms and pressing kisses to his cheeks, forehead and jaw. Harry laughs.
Harry leans against a tree to watch as Malfoy puts his fingers on a toadstool, speaks almost inaudibly, then pulls it from the ground and adds it to his basket.
“I’m glad.” He finally settles on. Draco doesn’t look up, but he doesn’t pull his hand away either. “Did you sleep alright after we got back in bed?”
It’s grown so ridiculous now, with only a small bit of actual mirror to use, that Harry decides he has to retaliate in the best way he knows how: public humiliation.
Crabbe’s parents were either dead or in prison by now. Only two people seemed at all remorseful for his death. No one else knew what he’d done, not really. Except, apparently, whoever moved his coffin.
Malfoy stares at him for a moment, but eventually the brief arrives and they formulate their game plan.
“What are these?” Harry asks, hoping talking about his flowers might help Draco open up more about whatever’s on his mind.
Draco is still reading his when Harry finishes. He folds the letter back up and goes over to the desk to put it in the drawer with his other letters.
It’s Greg who wakes him up, passing a cup of tea into his hands and taking a seat beside Blaise so Draco’s feet are in his lap.
look and directed it at one of Harry’s friends, Harry would indiscreetly start cracking his knuckles with a meaningful glance at Malfoy, who scowled and looked away.
Draco takes a long time, nearly an hour. Harry is glad for the magical water heater which never runs cold.
“But I keep telling them to appeal to a few of the pureblood families who are looking for charities to boost their family names again. Really it’s a perfect opportunity, as the press would talk and a few donations would be able to pay the stipend for freed elves should they want to stay, which most of them probably would.”
“Mhm, brilliant deduction, however did you manage to win a war?” Malfoy says drily, pulling Harry closer and sort of sprawling on top of him. He isn’t hard, but it seems he’s interested, and Harry decides not to comment on that. He's distracted by the feeling of Malfoy's skin against his chest.
The grey eyes hold his longer than before, nothing inside them, but staring at Harry. The hand which had reached out to take the coin hesitates, grasping the Galleon but not releasing Harry’s hand.
Harry recognises the man who had brought Draco to his private room the last night here. Alpha. Harry is glad to see the manacles around his wrists.
Draco wonders briefly if he’d be able to keep up this luck if he’s very good at talking to people. Maybe if he brings in enough business, Greyback will excuse him from a greater portion of his debt.
“But I like this better.” Harry grins, undoing the flannel’s buttons so it hangs open. “Wear it like this.”
“Correct, Potter. I’m making an exception for you because you’re so damn special.” Draco says, leaning in to speak the last few words directly against Potter’s parted lips.
“Let the record show Madam Rosmerta just looked to Mister Malfoy, and Mister Malfoy nodded at her.” Robards describes. Harry rolls his eyes.
“I write to Blaise, Hermione and Molly nearly every day. I write to Ron some days. He takes longer to write back.”
Potter closes the distance between them to pass the breakfast over, and Draco's stomach clenches happily at the sight.
“We’re nearly there.” Harry promises, glancing over at Malfoy, his plaits whipping around in the wind.
me, Potter.” Malfoy finishes, his arms falling limping to his side, chin tilted up as he looks at Harry with the most honest expression Harry’s ever seen on him.
“Merlin, is that the date?” Harry asks in surprise, noticing Neville’s calendar stuck to the refrigerator.
“You’re not taking care of yourself.” Ginny says accusingly, moving behind Harry to pull his chair away from the table.
“Are you waiting for me to walk you back? Because you could just Apparate to your house from here.” Potter says, tossing rubbish into the bag Draco’s holding open for him.
“Hm. I imagine it would be difficult, finding people who see you not as Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived and rather as simply Potter.”
“I hated you because you were spoiled like my cousin.” Potter says. Draco tilts his head. “The muggle one I lived with growing up. He always bullied me, and you reminded me of him. So I didn’t really want to be friends with you.”
“That’s not how we do things, here in- in 2019.” Harry stammers, wondering if duels over someone’s hand are still a thing in the wizarding world and Harry somehow hasn’t heard about it. “He picked me, if you don’t like that, take it up with him.”
The cigarette does burn down before Malfoy finishes, and Harry puts it out on the railing, then tosses it off the tower.
“Draco, you have to stay here. I’ll be running lots of errands today. Plus, I don’t think grocery stores allow animals.” Harry explains, lifting Draco off his shoulders.
“It’ll start getting cold soon.” Harry says. “I don’t mind staying, but you’ll probably be too cold.”
“But- but I just thought- I thought, you can have multiple friends-with-benefits. Right? If he was still- if- it’s not bad because I’m not
Ron and Harry turn to Draco, who has shrunken back into a tight ball against the corner of the sofa.
Harry whispers through his teeth. He hopes his lips don’t move noticeably. Malfoy starts slightly, leaning back to look into Harry’s face. His hips grind down, and Harry closes his eyes with a quiet moan.
boy Saviour. And I cannot see myself dating Potter. Besides that, he’s still part of the Weasleys, and I can’t imagine they’d approve.”
Harry and Draco leave the Manor, Apparating from the doorstep directly to Pansy’s equally large, equally impressive house.
“Huh. And you spent four years in a club.” Harry says. He listens for a moment. “Did they play muggle music at the club?”
He holds out his wrist without even looking, and Harry gently taps it, which seems to pacify Draco ever so slightly, but not for long.
"Well I can’t imagine you’d ask Goyle over last night just to talk about what poor taste I have in beer. Hopefully you also mentioned that my work-related injuries are down by one event a week per my new year’s resolutions. And that I have rather a handsome stag Patronus."
“Yeah. So he’ll need you to testify for him, and Pierson met him too, though he wasn’t fooled by the disguise. But he didn’t give Pierson away, which he would’ve if he’d had any loyalty to the club.”
Harry didn’t get a chance to read it until they were sitting at the table and Hermione and Ron were bickering about Ron wanting to sit with Lavender and Parvati, who hadn’t yet arrived.
An uncountable number of welts ran along Malfoy’s lower back, arse cheeks and the backs of his legs. Bruises were fading, but large and covering much of the back of his thighs. His left thigh has a long, jagged, painful looking horizontal gash just below the crease of his cheek, scabbed over but not healed.
“Not really. There’s still trials and all. But I very much doubt they’ll get off without prison time. They said some incriminating things to Pierson, who’s an auror. He’ll testify against them.” Harry says.
After a moment passes and Draco doesn’t say anything else, Harry cooks them some eggs and sausage, wondering what’s got Draco in such a strange mood.
"He was definitely captured but I couldn't find anything of the event itself. Everything is mixed up and there are large chunks taken out all over."
“Thank you. I hope you two are able to find something you like inside.” He offers, gesturing for them to go in.
“You’re right. It is reasonable. And I’m really sorry I acted like it was only something to be fixed.”
“Okay.” Draco makes a note on Harry’s page. He flips a few pages. “When you said Theo, you were talking about Theodore Nott?”
“Harry, if you’re not going to do something, like tell Malfoy you want to snog him senseless, you can’t complain about him snogging someone else.”
Malfoy grabs it and walks it all the way over to Harry, passing it over while his free hand covers a yawn.
There’s a nagging feeling in the back of Harry’s head that something’s not right, but it seems like even Draco can’t figure out what it is.
“Not yet, I’m not done with you.” He winks, then twists from the bed to get something from the drawer. Draco tries to catch his breath.
“I’m sure there’s some snobby occasion that you can steal the spotlight in this.” Harry suggests. “Probably not the best for working a case, though. But it’s beautiful.”
“No.” Draco says, running a hand through his hair. He follows Harry to the door anyway, standing slightly off to the side.
Memory Harry whizzes by, grinning. Draco’s memory clearly pictures Harry’s face, but his eyes are even brighter than before, shoulders just a little more broad and hair shiny and artfully mussed. Harry’s real hair has never been artful once in his life.
Moving down his torso, Harry sucks and nips at the skin, leaving purplish red marks that would stay for days on Draco’s pale skin. Draco sobs when Harry passes over his cock in favour of sucking his bollocks into his mouth gently, one and then the other.
“I wouldn’t say it’s informal. More… transactionary. You don’t let the crazy mass murderers into the castle to kill me, and I help you bring your mother here where she’ll be safe.”
“He’s been in the shower this whole time? I thought you said you left him after the world’s longest bath.”
“Oh, er… it has a… it has a thing.” He says, gesturing in a cone-shaped manner. “It’s called… oh fuck. I can’t remember what it’s called. I think it’s in Sirius’ room, though. I’ll help you find it.”
“I understand.” Harry says gently. “Don’t pretend with me. You know I have bad days too. If you're not okay, we'll be not okay together. Yeah?”
It only takes a minute of replaying what had just happened in his memory for Harry to bite his lip and try to muffle his cries as he comes into a wad of toilet tissue.
Unsurprisingly, Draco spent the rest of the day gloomy and despondent, frequently reaching out for Harry just to stop himself. His shoulders are near his ears and he was constantly hunched over or curled up on himself, looking especially miserable.
“I think they know. Mrs. Weasley at least, and maybe Mr. Weasley too since he saw us fighting together.”
“So instead of bringing you to the Ministry, he brought you along for his evidence-disposal trips in Knockturn, huh?”
So Draco straddles Neville’s legs, feeling very weird about it. He stays back, closer to his knees than his hips. Neville seems to prefer that. His hands sit uncomfortably on the edge of the seat near his rear.
“I didn’t say that. I’m just trying to understand the goal tonight, like… it’s obviously not orgasm, I assume not even you could get off to just snogging.”
“Well, she’s not very little now, but yeah.” Harry says, glad that Narcissa hadn’t used mudblood at least. “So they’ve got that to look forward to. Ron’s also working with George at
Harry watches with a dopey smile as Draco holds the cup with both hands and holds his face over it between sips. Harry’s not sure if this is to smell it better, or to feel the steam warm up his face, but it’s adorable either way.
Harry covers his mouth with his hand as he starts laughing. Draco smirks as he places it on his head.
"Don't be. Nothing to be sorry for." She says lightly. "Would you rather me be here or would you like a moment alone?"
to, but it wouldn’t be good for us.” Harry says awkwardly. He can feel how hot his face is and is glad Draco doesn’t really read facial cues the same way most people do, Ron would be laughing at him.
“Yes yes, convince me why I should pick you instead.” Malfoy says, turning to look at Theodosii with a false innocence Harry can see through in an instant.
“No, he doesn’t. He doesn’t blame you.” Goyle says from ten feet away, walking backward. He sniffs. “I don’t either. But it’s easier than blaming ourselves.”
day.” Draco hedges, irritable now that Potter has denied him release. “Just since the mail came. My father wrote to me.”
The first chapter is sort of a little prologue to the ~sexytimes~ in this universe (Draco/Blaise/Pansy BDSM) and I'll probably continue to set some of the kinky prompts in this universe:)
For all Draco’s teasing about Potter not being able to handle Draco, it ends up being rather the other way around.
of women’s clothes? Just in case you’re sent on a top secret case to a formal function and you have to be in disguise?”
There are many ways to coax Draco into subspace. It’s not very difficult. But Greg manages to do it better than just about anyone.
“Except you’ll have to compete against them this time.” Harry points out. He vaguely remembers Malfoy being friendly with some of the students back then. “Wait, were you dating any that year?”
With special portkeys, they dispatch the suspects straight to cells at the Ministry, and Harry sends a Patronus to Robards alerting him of the activity.
Is he an absolute disaster twink? Yes. Does he have genuine reasons for royally fucking everything up? Mostly yeah :/
Draco’s state sets him off his guard, and he’s surprised to see Greyback standing with his arms crossed in the middle of the room.
“Gentlemen, may I introduce Asher.” Alpha says, pushing Draco into the circle. They all look at him hungrily. “Asher is very adaptable and obedient, I’m sure you will enjoy him. I will be back to pick him up at the end of the night.”
“No. But sure, George. Decent fellow. One half of a matched set that’ll never be the same. I didn’t kill Fred.” He looks up at Harry.
“Maybe you could tell her that. But in a letter, just in case.” Harry says, and Draco nods seriously.
“Perfectly fine. I’ve just been talking to… a friend. Who is trying to see if they’re into blokes. I’m going to offer to snog them a bit, so they can see if it’s something they like, but just as a favour. But I wanted to make sure you’re okay with that first.”
“Suppose not. You could have all the attention you want, this year. I’m mostly rubbish in everything but DADA, you could be top of the class if you wanted.”
“I don’t give a shit if he thinks I’m a coward.” Harry says, frowning. He crosses his arms, trying to seem imposing, though even with his slight height advantage, Theodosii is more broad.
“You looked so cute and excited opening it up. You folded up the parchment paper wrapping like it was a part of the gift too, like you wanted to keep the whole thing.”
“Hey, hey, can you hear me?” Harry says softly. He strokes his hands. Draco’s eyes are open, but not moving, not watching the room like they usually do.
Still, he’s a little worried Draco has slipped and knocked himself out, so he raps on the door, cracking it open.
“Hm. Well, until you prove otherwise, I’m just going to assume both your Patronus and your Animagus are ferrets.”
“Yeah, this is perfect. You’ll be the talk of the town - Meredith Appleby, the woman who doesn’t exist.”
“There you are, pet.” The Prince says, taking one of Draco’s soft, delicate hands and kissing the knuckles. “I was wondering where you might be.”
“I want to know what to look for.” Harry finds himself saying. He blushes, but he stands his ground.
“Fuck your father. I had a rotten father too, and… and he died, and look at me! I’m okay, and I don’t even have a Storia to keep me company at night!”
“You really should’ve done before they got here. You know, before you basically told him to go find a Durmstrang to shag?”
Pansy sits on Millie’s side to pet Draco’s hair, and he nearly falls asleep before Millie spanks him a bit harder than before.
“Aren’t you supposed to be good at this sort of thing? And why did your accent change?” Harry asks, pulling out his wand.
“He isn’t.” Draco acknowledges. “But… I keep thinking about… It was autumn, the year before Hogwarts, and we were picking crabapples in the garden, and it was so cold I couldn’t feel my fingers. He put up some warming charms when he saw my fingernails were blue. And he took his scarf and wrapped me up in it.
Harry strokes repeatedly by Malfoy’s ribs, under his arm, and Malfoy takes a very large gulp of his drink.
“You want some attention, kitty?” Harry slides down to lay beside Draco, nudging at his hips until he rolls onto his back. “I’ll give you attention. Try to not come.”
What if… what if Malfoy woke up, what if he looked over at Harry’s bed and saw him. Would Malfoy’s eyes be drawn to Harry’s arse the way Harry’s are always drawn to Malfoy’s?
"That's it, baby. Make a mess of yourself for me. Your sweet cum all over your little tummy while I fill you to the brim with mine. Does it feel good? Is it getting to be too much for such a little baby? I'll bet my cock feels even bigger in your tight hole now, doesn't it."
“Likely nothing. Slytherins have excellent taste in quality but very little creativity regarding attire. It took Theo a month to notice when I started wearing eyeliner.”
“Oh. Good.” Harry says, rubbing along Draco’s shoulder, unsure of what prompted the hug. “Everything alright?”
“Okay. Can you tell me what the rules at the club were?” Harry asks. His chest feels like lead and he dreads hearing the answer.
“Potter, why would a child who hates their parents put their own life at risk to be like them? To do what they asked?”
Draco is suddenly immensely grateful for Pansy’s terrible exercise regimen, as it allows him to reach an impressive 76 while Potter is slowing down around 53.
“I was told to shut down any attempt for you to leave this office until McGonagall gets back. Sorry mate.” Ron says apologetically, leaning against the wall.
Have you guys seen those videos on Tiktok about the flats with the kitchen drawer that won't open unless you open the oven door and turn on the stove? Because now I live in one of them, it's like a jigsaw puzzle and it sucks.
“You should order some, I’ll show you what it does.” Harry says, looking across the pillow to where Draco squints.
Hermione whispers, pressing her lips together. “Go.” She tells the girl. She doesn’t have to say it twice.
When he takes Harry’s offered coin, Harry squeezes his hand. Tries to catch his attention. To tell him he
Knox roughly shoves Drake to the floor and takes hold of her chin, looking into her eyes. Drake’s lips fall open and she whimpers.
Harry showered again, if for no other reason than to get some time without worrying what Malfoy might’ve been thinking.
“I never really needed protection. Not from you. But a stupefy cast by Harry Potter is justified. One cast by me is an attack.”
“I sort of doubt it. Well, I think this might be muggle, I’ve heard Sirius listen to stuff like this before.”
“Yeah, don’t worry, not here on official business.” He says. “Just personal curiosity. A hunch, really.”
It gives Harry a funny feeling of relief that Zabini always responds so quickly, like maybe Draco is more important to him than whatever he’s up to at the time.
“Marion is going to help heal your body, she needs to be able to see what she’s doing. She’s only looking so she can help you. Are you still uncomfortable with it?”
“Well.” Greg says, tugging the blankets up a bit higher and setting his big hands on Draco’s shoulders. “You’ve got an immunity built up to being embarrassed around Potter, so it shouldn’t be too bad. And if it is, just move in with me and Astoria and we’ll make sure no Potters come in and taunt you over the terrible jokes we both know you’ll make tomorrow.”
” Malfoy says with a slight huff, tossing a stack of papers down onto Harry’s desk. “If you’re not going to proofread your reports, there’s no point in writing them. A Quick Quill could do a better job.”
“So? You’re going to be noticed either way, might as well make it count.” Harry says. “What’s the other option?”
To be honest, it’s a bit funny to be tapped so gently as a punishment, but Draco takes the rules very seriously, depends on them even, so Harry has to respect them too.
But if Harry’s wrong, and Malfoy truly just wants to get himself off as he’d planned before Harry inserted himself into the flat… Malfoy could and
“That’s alright.” Harry says gently. Draco holds out his hand, and Harry gently taps it. Draco barely reacts, which is concerning.
“I’m done, and I pick Drake.” Draco says, buttoning his sleeve again and looking at his victims. “What’s Knox’s most embarrassing fetish?”
“You look dashing, by the way.” He says, holding Draco at arm’s length to admire him. He’s wearing a posh lavender jacket, brocade with metallic embroidery and shining buttons. His grey slacks fit him perfectly (of course) and he finally agreed to wearing his white shirt half undone over his chest when Harry had agreed to roll up his own jacket sleeves.
Finally, Willows sits up, and Potter’s eyes find Draco’s face just like Draco had done. Draco purposefully licks his lips, and Potter smirks.
At the end, he once again kisses her fingers as she watches with a wide smile. It’s a familiar one, and Harry relaxes a bit when he sees it.
, if Malfoy were to brush against Harry in a corridor, his round little bum not hidden by their dreadful uniform trousers… absolutely
"Alright.” Harry says. “So I’m going to punch you right in your pointy face next time you’re rude. I’ll only mess with your aura if you’re nice to someone."
“He wanted to check that you were arresting the right guys.” Harry explains. “Make sure they didn’t flip the polyjuice thing on us, have you arrest disguised people. Plus, you didn’t know two of their identities, only Thorn and Greyback.”
“Yes, and it all goes to my arse.” Malfoy says brightly, elbows deep in a barrel of taffy. “People always take the pink ones. I had to order a bunch by owl in Fourth year because the Beauxbaton boys took all the pinks.”
Harry had lived well. He was a good auror, a good friend, a good man. Circe, he had given his life for wizardkind!
“My father wanted me to, but I was preoccupied, and my parents respected that. Now, I don’t really need them, as I’ve got the shop and it’s doing well on its own.”
, I think it's like ~1K words long or so, but I enjoyed writing it. If you like soft kink/prince stuff, go check it out!
“Nothing to be sorry for. Would you like to talk about it? Or maybe do something to take your mind off it?”
“Last night drained you more than usual.” Harry says as he rummages around for breakfast making things.
“...alright, so I learned that one from Pansy.” Malfoy admits before putting a large bite into his mouth.
“You sleep now?” Hermione asks, looking surprised. She is well aware of his insomniac habits now after spending months with him on the run. Harry shrugs.
They’d had an easy, casual friendship since, and since Goyle was the only one in his friend group not performing, they’d made plans to sit together.
After dinner, he helps them clean up despite both of their protests, then heads toward the hallway to his room.
The third night Harry’s there, he doesn’t disguise himself. He’s filled out a bit from his Hogwarts days, and hasn’t been in the news for years. His long hair covers his scar, with the back tied into a small knot at the nape of his neck, and he doesn’t wear glasses anymore, so he isn’t spotted on his way in, and though one or two peoples’ eyes linger on him, no one says anything.
“Next, is Miss Triss Knox, and close by her side so you don’t mistake them for gal pals, her girlfriend, Miss Luvenia Drake! Our favourite lesbian duo never fails to bring a good time, despite being the only real couple here tonight!”
He doesn’t seem to care that Harry’s in the room, and Harry supposes it doesn’t much matter given that he’s seen Malfoy naked every night for several days now.
Potter lifts his hand from Draco’s leg with a smirk, and Draco squeaks out a protest as Potter’s silent, wandless Summoning charm brings Draco longest, most devious butt plug straight into Potter’s waiting hand.
“Oh wait, did you still want to sleep here? You can choose. I have other rooms you could stay in. It’s up to you.”
Harry must admit he’s rather excited to see how Malfoy intends to disguise himself and what he’ll look like. He thinks privately that he should be able to spot him quickly despite appearances as he’s very attuned to the way Malfoy carries himself and gesticulates. He’s eager to test the theory.
She also says she’ll ask George to be there, as Draco had specifically wanted to meet him and ask about the prank which got him expelled.
“Switching bodies – when it’s on purpose anyway – is a bit like taking a big jump across a river. But I’ll be able to stick my foot out and make sure I have somewhere to land before taking the leap.” Fred explains. “Don’t worry about me, Harry, I’ll be alright.”
But then Greg started rubbing circles on the back of Draco’s hand, and Astoria ran her fingers through his hair, and Draco slipped right back down again.
“Mister Malfoy, are you and Harry Potter friends now? What do you say about his presence here today.”
“Marion, would you give us a moment?” Harry asks. Marion nods, leaving the room. “Okay, can you tell me why you’re uncomfortable?”
“I wasn’t!” Harry says, wondering why Malfoy’s so touchy. “I just have a hard time imagining what it’s like, I grew up in- well, it wasn’t a suite. My cousin sort of had a suite.”
“Good. Wonderful, Draco. So good.” Harry murmurs, hoping praise will help like it sometimes does. It certainly doesn’t hurt, right now.
Unable to hold off any longer, Harry came over his own fist, muffling his groan with his free hand as he splattered the tiles with cum.
“Mine?” Draco asks. Harry passes it back, and Draco looks at it for a moment before holding it to his chest again.
“Er, sort of. You weren’t bad, I don’t think. The team didn’t play as well when you stopped being the Seeker, so I think you must’ve won other games. But you got very distracted playing against me.”
“Why don’t you go find Ron, I doubt he’s studying.” Draco suggests, and with another noise of complaint, Harry slides off the sofa onto the floor, then gets up. Draco laughs.
“Harry, I-” He says, but doesn’t get to finish as his mouth drops open and he comes all over Harry’s hand and his own chest.
Just when Harry’s about to reprimand him for the Statute and demand he Obliviate her before she says anything, the girl rolls her eyes.
“Jack was nice when no one else was.” Draco continues. “He made things better for me even when he thought I wanted to be there.”
“Can I go to see Blaise?” Draco asks. Harry takes his damp hands, rubbing across his knuckles softly.
This is ridiculous, because Potter broke his arm when he was 12, not to mention coming into Draco’s hospital here with broken bones every couple of weeks.
“Hey, I’m here so we can answer some of Marion’s questions together. Joint effort.” Harry says, hopping up to sit beside Draco on the table.
want to sleep with you.” Draco says, looking at Potter’s face for any reaction. “It’s not like I want to shag you and never speak to you again, though. I think we’ve sort of become friendly.”
“Carry me.” He says, wrapping his limbs around Harry’s body. Harry laughs, but slips his hands under Draco’s arse and pulls them both up.
“I’m leaving for the day.” Draco says mildly. “And so, I’m here to return the favour and fuck up some aspect of your work so you have to redo it when you come back.”
“Your hand smells like latex.” Harry complains, grabbing it and holding it against his chest instead.
“I’ve never been able to. I practise often but I’ve never gotten it.” Malfoy shrugs his exposed shoulders. His red lips purse in displeasure.
“I’ve seen dozens of professional Quidditch games and I’ve never once seen someone stand on their broom.”
“You’re dehydrated. You need to drink as much water as you can. But stop if you think you’ll be sick again.”
It flies into Harry’s hand, and Malfoy releases him so Harry stands facing them with two wands and a deadly expression.
He’s sitting sideways, as he has on every lap so far, but he’s leaning his shoulder into Potter’s chest. It’s absolutely brilliant.
"I think they look cool. And no, they're a special sort of piercing, they put a screw on the inside and the skin kind of heals around it."
Honestly, the easy answer would be Potter, but Draco has very much enjoyed spending time with Crane, Willows himself and Drake. Still.
Obediently, Harry sits down, and Draco immediately takes his hand and rubs his thumb over Harry’s knuckles.
Harry waves lazily as the door closes behind Narcissa and Malfoy. He can faintly hear their footsteps heading back toward Malfoy’s rooms until he falls asleep.
“It’s all in a field in the back.” Harry assures him. “It’s especially pretty in the spring, but we can come back then. I didn’t want to bring you somewhere that would be too loud.”
“I-I’m s-s-sorry-” Draco cries weakly. He’s shaking all over, paler than Harry’s ever seen him and holding the bin like a lifeline.
Draco huffs, feeling rather pleased with himself given that the most recent event had not actually been strictly sexual in nature.
“Azkaban, it’s a prison in the middle of the ocean. Your father will be there for the rest of his life. Your mother may get out early, but it’s difficult to say.”
riding my fingers like that, Draco. I don’t think I’d be able to take it, watching you ride my cock.” He says, and Draco groans loudly. His hips stutter in their rhythm, but he catches up quickly and feels his impending orgasm.
.” Malfoy says mildly. “The entire point of the painting is so you’d be occupied enough to not have me answering questions whilst I try to get things done.”
Summoning the mirror from the dresser and setting it up on Malfoy’s empty chair, Harry prompted Malfoy to look.
I did notice that he’d been drugged, possibly under Imperius or something similar? What would you recommend doing if I
Malfoy flips the camera off, then puts his hand back on his leg, which is currently lifted above his head, though he’s lying flat on his back on the floor.
“About asking me to go home for the holiday? I’ve told you you’re always welcome at the cottage whether or not I’m there.” Harry says.
, after giving both Blaise and Pansy hangover potions. He has to borrow their owl, Pidge (short for Pigeon, which Blaise had found very funny), but he sends a nice note wishing Potter a happy Christmas with all his Weasleys as well.
“Did you eat exactly half just to be bratty?” Harry guesses. Draco looks away, a pouty look on his face.
He’s surprised when Draco hops up onto the stage he used to use, setting down his wand and standing, staring at the pole. He brushes his fingers against it, then grabs on, not hanging, just walking in a circle. Harry wonders what’s going through his mind.
Harry grumbles again, but it’s of no use, so he goes back to his office to have a strong cup of coffee and scream.
“Underage?” Harry gasps dramatically. Malfoy reaches out toward the table, rolling a stray grape around with one finger.
“Pick another one, I’m not drunk enough to hear about your girl friend’s strap on in your mouth or whatever the fuck you got up to last.”
Now that he’s a fairy, the wizarding world is not welcoming. But since he grew up with little exposure to the muggle world, Malfoy doesn’t feel welcome there either. Not to mention he has to hide most aspects of himself whilst in the presence of muggles.
A moment later, Draco’s light footsteps up the hallway, and Draco appears with his towel still in his hands a moment later.
Draco yelps as Harry tosses the lights aside, wondering what's going on. Neville appears in the kitchen doorway a moment later carrying Draco bridal style.
“Nice.” He whispers. Harry nods and continues to scrub. He scratches lightly, which gets another soft noise out of Draco. He doesn’t mention that one.
Still, Draco has no interest explaining how he acquired the injuries, as no one would believe him if he blamed a dragon.
“He was working for Neville off the books, Neville paid him cash.” Harry explains. “But Draco’s been to the Ministry since then, so I think legally, he could get a job but I don’t know for sure. I can ask Hermione about it.”
My lovely Romania readers! If you enjoy a subby and generally cute Draco, BDSM-y elements, and Dom!Harry, I have some good news for you! My latest story, Aura Reader, will be taking Potions Prof's spot in the lineup (Mondays) and it is exactly those things.
It’s just after lunch when several Patronuses bound through the corridors telling all students to report to their assigned battle positions.
“Yeah, when we were eight. You told me you wanted to kiss someone you liked. That was when your parents had started talking about arranging for you to marry one of the Greengrasses. You wanted to kiss a boy before you had to get married to a girl.”
With a smirk and a rather sheepish look, Potter rubs at the black scruff growing in with the back of his coffee-holding hand.
Inside the memory, the first thing Harry notices is his own eyes staring back through round glasses.
Still holding onto Malfoy’s hand tightly, Harry shifts his feet to coax his broom upward several more feet.
“I think he would, especially since we’re together.” Harry says, feeling his ears warm up as even to him, that phrasing was odd. “I mean, since clearly we’ve reconciled.” He amends.
“Yes. It hurts otherwise. I don’t have to if you don’t want me to. I’ll be just as tight either way.” Malfoy says.
Then Hermione is talking about her fight for the house-elves, trying to get the Ministry to really enforce the new policies particularly in wealthy old wizarding families.
“Yeah. He sleeps better when he’s not by himself.” Harry says. Draco's relieved when the whisper hides the strain in his voice.
“Thank you, Potter.” Draco says, glad he doesn’t have to make the distinction himself and therefore end up talking about his sex life anyway.
“I assume I’d only get better with practise.” Draco adds. Harry groans, dropping his head back again.
“Yeah, we’re not married and I doubt either of us would change surnames if we did get married.” Draco agrees.
Things get very fun and sexy and fluffy from here, so I'm excited to see what you all think of this chapter as the rest of the story will be more like this one and less like the beginning (sexiness, anyway).
Harry’s protests are cut off when Malfoy lurches up and grabs hold of one nipple with his teeth, twisting the bar with his tongue.
“Okay.” Harry agrees, slipping the photo out of the album. Draco waves his wand over it and a second photo appears in his hand.
