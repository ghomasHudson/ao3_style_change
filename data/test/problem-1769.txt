"SIRIUS BLACK!" A very loud shout followed by a loud stomping was heard all over the house. Even if it is only in the first floor the intensity, and volume was so high, it reached the third floor where Sirius' and Harry's rooms were located.
"Harry? Why are you calling?" he asked, his tone sounding genuinely happy.
"You know… the night, bed thing…" I elaborated; quite… pathetically.
"What!? How did that happen?" I yelled shooting out of my seat.
"Are you kidding?" Ren asked, a little shocked to what I just told her.
"What favour?"
"Well technically, I think I've been disowned." Harry replied.
We parted when the need for breath arises.
"Thank you. Please come again." The sales lady said behind us.
"What's with the face baby?" Blaise said grabbing Ron from behind, startling me and Hermoine. But Ron looked like he expected it.
"Why, even circus beauties like us needs to go to classes, or else we'd end up like you… beautiful, but with a foul attitude," Ron said pointing at Millicent. "or that woman, who might be absent when the gods showered the human beings beauty, grace and brains." He said pointing at Pansy who fumed with anger and embarrassment. "Let's just go Hannah or the ugliness might rub off." He said as he stood up, turning his back against the two.
"That explains the wig…" They said again, both looking like they wanna puke at the thought of my wig… is it really that bad?
"Well well well…" An annoyingly squeaky voice said from behind me. "look who's back. Isn't it the weirdo duo?" she said in a very mocking tone. "We thought you wouldn't return after what happened last year."
"Say What?"
"Thanks, and I slept in…" I said smiling sheepishly.
"Does that mean anything?"
Tonks had already bought two pairs of tank tops, one electric pink with turquois lining and the words "I'm beautiful" in front, And "Problem?" in the back. The other one was a Green hanging top with a torn arm hole and also a torn plunging neckline, I swear, I can only wear that with an under shirt. She also bought two black tube tops along with it. We also bought five t-shirts and two denims, which I choose.
'OMG!' I thought as I felt those soft lips reach mine. 'Is this really happening?' I asked myself. The kiss went for a while, without it being above pg-13, it was a wholesome kiss that I always see when I
"Why?"
"Uhm… Hi." I said dumbly.
"Then, do you have any ideas what high school girls, this generation wears?" She asked raising an eyebrow.
"You saw this!" I heard a voice, which I'm sure was Parkinson's yell.
"Draco is too proud to stoop so low and volunteer to be an escort of some random bitch."
"Surprise me…" I said with a husky voice.
Millicent just scoffs at her best friend's antics. "She can't Pans, believe me. She's not even his type."
Okay, It has been so long since I updated this story. I believe I last updated this way back in 2012... Yes in 2012, and I posted it here in 2013. My writing style has changed drastically since then. There's still the occasional slip with the tenses, but everything about my writing got better. I was only 16 when I wrote this story. Now I'm 22. I am going to be updating this soon, but I need to edit every single thing first. Since reading some parts of this story makes me cringe like a motherfucker.
"Yes, I just bought something from the convenience store in the other street." Sirius said avoiding Harry's gaze.
"Sadly some assholes interrupted us."

"Oh… fine."
"Just a work with threads." George said.
"Shut up."
She also bought two skirts; one was a violet pleated mini, while the other was a checkered white, red and black. She also bought two sweaters a black and white stripe and a black one, a grey blazer, and a black and pink jacket. Then she bought me four pairs of shoes: a high Heeled wedge shoes, a pair of black ankle length boots for school, a pair of black and light blue running shoes, and floral flats. She bought me two dresses a short beige one with lace sleeves and glittered all-over, and a black long halter gown with crystals on its straps both goes well with the light brown wedge, and a synthetic brown fur white leather jacket.
"So, you look wonderful right now. Hannah." Sirius said smiling at me.
"Did. That. Bitch. SLAPPED ME?" I asked stressing every syllable I could; feeling really annoyed, my anger spilling any second. "NOBODY SLAPS ME!" I shouted as I marched towards the two happy, retreating girls. I turned Millicent around, and the bitch just SMIRKED at me! 'I have an idea how to wipe that smirk off your face.' I thought as I bitch slapped her, left and right, and punched her stomach.
I picked the brown t-shirt that has a black lining and the word
"Oh well, well,well." I heard a really ugly squeaky voice behind me. "Isn't it early for people like both of you to come out?"
"Look at me!" I said with a commanding tone. She immediately shot up and looked at me. I felt my stomach churn at what I saw, her left eye was covered in black, and there's blood dripping from her nose and the left corner of her mouth. "Why did they do this to you?" I said as I wiped the blood and tears with my hanky.
"Sirius!" Harry said as he turned around.
"Well, Sirius and James are best friends right?"
We watched the whole movie quietly, no one making a move until the movie ended. We just sat there ate popcorn share a soda and hold hands the whole time.
"Do you think you can hide things from huh, Hanna? Or is that even your real name?" Draco said with a serious tone of voice, which made me swallow a bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Our next kiss was rougher. There was a hunger I felt deep inside me and I begged her for entrance. She opened her mouth, and the next thing I know we were fighting for dominance, which I naturally won. I explored her mouth thoroughly, and tasted every bit of her. She tastes mostly sweet like strawberry, and a little salty.
"Okay. Love you sweetie." She hanged up…
"My phones are not even in my pockets, they're just in front of my skin!" He read the message and saw Hermoine's commanding tone…
They weren’t dating, but maybe they were just a tiny bit in love with each other anyways.
“Um, yes, this is—Harry. From school.”
“I don’t—” Harry faltered.
“Perhaps it would be unwise to end your sessions completely. We wouldn’t want you slacking, after all.”
Harry couldn’t remember. The last Drarry chapter happened like a month ago, really.
“You know, I don’t think you really needed me at all, Draco. It all went very well.”
Harry remembered the way Tom’s demeanor changed from kind to murderous in the span of less than a second. His eyes became so cold, Harry could almost feel frostbite.
“Get out,” he growled.
One certain James Potter that one certain Sirius Black stared at when he thought no one was looking—that looked heartbroken whenever said James Potter and Lily Evans were together.
“It’s nothing, Harry. Let’s go to the next ride.”
He gave Sirius a hug.
God, Harry could just tell he was feeding his enormous god complex. He was internally rebuking himself for stroking Tom’s huge ego; he probably thought the whole world was in love with him.
Harry sipped his Sprite quietly, still tired from the dance routine, glancing over at Sirius occasionally.
“Even though you have a crush on
“Right, Sirius, do me a favor? Don’t treat me like an idiot.”
“Are you perhaps a masochist?”
“Tom!” Harry laughed while yelling against the wind. “Are you okay?”
Harry gave Draco one of his heart-melting smiles until his scowl gradually faded.
This is, of course, where it all went wrong.
“The two of us. On a date. We could go… I don’t know, to an amusement park?”
Cedric.
It was delicious.
Harry harrumphed, “Bold of you to assume I’m only pretending to be here for the coffee. The mochas are very good, you know.”
Blaise, as it turns out, was not very good at chemistry.
“Don’t look so smug!” Harry cried. “This just means more competition for you, so shouldn’t you be more upset?!”
“I didn’t choose the comedian life, it chose me,” Harry nodded. “Did you know I called Draco Ellen DeGeneres once? It’s up there in my Top 5 Roasts.”
Harry promptly slapped himself in the face with both hands, snapping himself out of it.
“I know.”
Harry stared at the cup of coffee in his hands and thought, “This is it.”
“I think you know the answer to that.”
“I can’t, Draco. I want a family and you don’t. You explicitly told me so. You know about my childhood and you know how important family is to me. You knew when dating me before we bonded that I wanted children and my own family to call my own. You knew and still bonded with me knowing you didn’t want children. Why? Why would you do that to me? I love you and I know you love me but it’s not enough. I want the joys and the sorrow children will bring me. I want the opportunity to give a child the childhood I was denied. I want the laugh and smiles. I want the tears and snot nosed babies keeping me up at night and never-ending feedings. I want to watch my child grow up and become this wonderful witch or wizard I raised it to be. I wanted to do all of those things with you, Draco.”
“There is nothing to talk about, Draco.” I say with resignation.
I whisper in his ear, “I am right here with you, love. We can do this together and it will be worth it. You will love being a father and you will do wonderfully, never doubt that. I love you.” I finish and kiss behind his ear, his favorite spot.
I cannot help myself and bring my hand up to wipe away his tears. I cradle his cheek in my palm and run my thumb under his eye, soothing it.
She's definitely got a HUGE appetite for a girl. Maybe to some guys it might be a turn off; but I actually like girls who eats Lunch, Dinner and breakfast without leaving a single grain of food behind.
Then as the credits rolled, he dragged me outside to the parking lot. There I saw the most beautiful car I've ever seen… again. Draco's Aston Martin.
"Thing." They said at the same time.
"Dray, I love you." I said feeling a little bit uneasy since there seem to be a long pause on the other line.
"D-Dray please, please more!" I screamed as he pushed his fingers deeper.
He just sighed and said. "Those two animals think very highly of themselves because of their parent's money, they think that everything they do is right. Take care of yourself, and the people who matters to you." He said glancing towards the other's direction. "Those two. They'll try destroying you, but remember that only one has strength, and the other only has brains." He said as he opened the door for me. I stood there dumbfounded for a second until I regain my composure, and starred at him.
"At least you got a taste of Draco Malfoy."
As the need for breath arises; both of us let go. This time though I wanted to do something I saw in one of those porn videos I watched earlier.
"That's life for ya…" Harry sighed. "And… how can you even manage drawing in front of the window? Won't the light distract you?"
Malfoy walks in the
"To the mall." She said while checking her nails.
"Tsk tsk tsk…" Tonks said with hand gestures. "Remember, Harry slash Hanna, you are a GIRL, it's fine to like cars but some of us do not act like that over a Porche." She said.
"So… I saved it in the fridge." I just grimaced at the thought of eating frozen shit like that.
-0-0-0-0-0-0-
"Beg harder." He said.
"Uh-oh" Ron and Hermione said in unison, which made me nervous like shit.
These are the words that crushed Harry to pieces
"Hello?"
'What could be very important that we have to go there ASAP?' Harry thought.
"So… uhm." He cleared his throat. "If a student council member volunteered to be an escort for in the pageant… he would automatically be entitled to choose the candidate to escort. So… you don't need to participate to the draw tomorrow." He said looking away from me.
-0-0-0-0-0-
"I don't care… and thank you for not lying to me." He said as he embraced me closer. "Harry."
"Maybe he just has no one to take here."
"Did he just say I'm beautiful?" I asked.
"You're going already?" Remus asked as he entered the room, balancing a tray of iced tea on the left hand, and holding a plate full of home baked donuts on the right. "Won't you at least stay to finish this?" He asked.
"Do you know she's like us?"
"But dear." Lilly interfered. "He did pass, he just ran out of slots, I'm sure we can get him in soon, we just have to enroll him in a different school until a slot is available." She explained, standing between the two men, seems like protecting her son from possible attacks.
'Hmmm… Suspicious, very suspicious. What are those two talking about? Whatever that is it, it can't be good, why not follow them… now I have something exiting to do, and I can't help smirking at the thought.
"Yep."
I figured I'll wear something a little bit boyish. Just to emphasize the fact that I was going to tell him tonight. I picked my beige cargo pants, a blue t-shirt that has an "I'm not bossy; I just have better ideas…" print, and my trusted black and white sneakers.
"D-Draco, p-please stop t-teasing me." I stuttered.
'Oh no!' I thought as his hand moved towards my "Boobs".
"Well thank you your highness."
I moved a little to the right as I heard footsteps going my direction.
"Make noises babe." I said as I bit his nipple, this time he wasn't able to cover his mouth as he screamed my name.
My Sony Ericsson's *Gee* ringtone is at the moment annoying me so I'll answer it.
"What subjects do you excel in?" Ron read the question out loud. "Definitely Arts and P.E."
"He got you hard didn't he?"
"Sorry about that." He said as he moved out making me hiss a little. "I promise it will be better." He said as he slammed back in. he repeated the motion until he hit something inside making me see stars.
My life you came and now you went.
"Hi there."

A few minutes later we heard some hard knocking on the door.
"They always hang pictures of candidates as soon they were announced." Ron said. "So those things were probably there since last night." He said munching on the potato chips I gave him LAST night.
"Fine, but who will come back?"
"B-b-because..."
-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-
Then he licked my stomach. Going up towards my collar bone. He then kissed it, I moaned audibly as he started to suck and bite it, and like on the lake he put a hand on top of my right nipple, making me moan even louder in the process.
"You seem to be in a very good mood today." Ron asked as he sat beside me. "Mind telling me why?"
Sargent at arms: (Hufflepuff Student)
Then I went and reenact the way he played with my nipples. How it pebbled at the touch and attention the blond man gave it. How it never followed my orders, to stay the way it was before he touched them.
"Are you FUCKI'n serious?"
-0-0-0-0-0-
"No buts you'll use it!" Ron said using his "Do it or Die" tone, that even Hermione can't defy.
"The business and sciences department?"
"(sigh) By the way, why didn't you get admitted?" Sirius asked frowning.
(meanwhile)
"YOU!" Millicent said as she tried to wipe cream out of her face. "Both of you are going down!" She said as she ran with Pansy to the nearest bathroom.
Story Trivia:
But when I reached towards her boobs she suddenly pushed me of, away from her.
"Remus…" Harry said looking at the brown haired man.
"So that's it?" Sirius asked.
"No… That's Barbie." I said with false-humor.
"Did you cut your hair?"
(15 minutes left)
Year level Government
"No, we ran for it before they reach us."
"If it's an in campus female competition; another person would be used as a replacement for the records. If it's a mix competition in or out campus, you're real name would be used if it's an out camp." Ron explained. "That is why we cannot join any out campus competitions."
"So that's why I never read anything about cross-dressers in the past records." I said, a little enlightened with the fact that Fred said.
"Mo-more. " I said, wanting the feeling again. He obliged and pulled out and pushed back in hitting my prostate dead on. He did it slow and hard at first, but later took a much faster pace until later all that was heard in the room was flesh hitting flesh and our grunts and moans.
"What?
"Hannah!" I shouted from across the place where she sat. I saw her stood up hastily, but she didn't make any move to run away. And the way she looked when she glanced my way… I really don't know, but something stirred up inside of me… it tells me that; she's the one for me….
I started to feel a little bit uneasy, 'Please don't hurt me evil ghosts!' I thought to myself, but then I heard the sounds of something crashing towards the locker rooms. As I walked towards it I came upon two large boys laughing, high fiving each other. 'Slytherin boys.' I thought as I looked at their uniforms.
"I'm fine, still crazy but fine." Ren smiled. "Oh, by the way, Hermione this dashing lady over here is Hannah Black, and, Hannah this lady over here is Hermione Granger. Our batch's president and she's also a scholar." Ren said. "She's also a Griffindor."
"I don't need your sorry; I need you to repeat what you said!"
(then a sound of a
"No prob." He said without taking his eyes away from me.
"Looks like you don't need hair extensions anymore." Ron said from behind me. "Now you just need mani-pedis. And I'll have a hot oil treatment." She said with a smile.
Yep I think that is.

"You tramp!"

I fixed the other clothes to their proper hangers, and put my stuff in a paper bag before I went out side.
"For the recital in English."
Then I heard some noise behind the trees, I followed it and it led me inside the forest; which I don't know if still a part of Hogwarts. It was dark there. Too dark in fact, it was still early and I'm sure that it's still less than ten minutes since I left the lake. All and all that place is downright freaky.
"Pay attention or get out…" I heard the professor said without looking away from the board. "Ms. Black, I know you feel like an idiot for what happened a while ago, but that doesn't mean that you can space out just like that. If you don't want to listen, feel free to get out." He said.
"You know them; you know them very well. And they want a certain girl out of their way." He said lighting a Marlboro. "The silly children even tried to persuade me to write a dismissal form for the poor girl." He said as he puffed smoke between some words. " If I were you I'll pull out their horns before they hit your property." He said going to the way his "Girlfriend" went, how ironic, the vice and the president together.
(Flashback exactly one month and two weeks ago first day of classes)
Ten minutes after they passed me, I ran towards the direction of the lake, and back to my dorm.
"Yeah… it will make those Slytherin bitches hate and admire you more." He smirked.
"Didn't you know that I like flat chested body builder girls too?" He said.
These thoughts travelled around my head for a little while, until I decided to finally call Draco.
"Then I'll get out!" Remus said as he opened his door and went out.
Then decided to go to another level, I put three fingers inside my mouth. I sucked and rolled my tongue all over each and every one of them. Then when I'm satisfied, I pulled them out. I removed y self from the water for a while as I put the first finger inside my ass hole. I pushed in and out until I almost fell face first because I hit the spot that made me see stars the other night. Then I added another finger and do the exact routine Draco did until the third finger. Until I came, strings after strings of cum, without even touching my cock.
Hogwarts Academy 9:30 am
"That's correct." Remus added. "And keep that thing you are doing up."
It felt a little weird as I felt Draco's finger inside me. I closed my eyes as I tried to hide the uncomfortable feeling which accompanied it. It wasn't really painful, but the feeling was so alien, that I almost pushed his hand away.
"Yea, and marks were still there. But since the products were new the punishment will be different." He explained, as he put the half empty glass on a counter.
"I'm sorry!" she said as she helped me up. She didn't wait for an answer and walked me towards her door.
"Oh, I'm always sure."
"Would both of you, stop talking about sex and go to the stage right now… Both Bones and Granger were already there and we're only waiting for you two." A very cold, angry voice said behind us.
"Because I WASN'T ABLE TO GET INTO HOGWARTS ACADEMY!" Harry shouted eyes closed afraid of what his godfather's reaction might be.
"You really like that drink, don't you?"
"Honestly babe, I don't know what you're talking about." I smirked.
"Shut the hell up." I laughed. "I wonder of your boy toy's hole is even intact, with that appetite of yours.
"But it will be a good beating for the bitch you're going up against. Being second to a cross-dresser would be a big insult to that prideful woman." George said.
"And who did you put as my mum?" Harry asked.
'The head of Slytherin…' Harry thought to himself, as he lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling of his dimly lit room. 'Isn't he one of the two cross-dressers who graduated in Sirius' batch?'
"Well, the news about Draco volunteering to be your escort came out this morning." He said with a smirk.
"Hello there." Harry said as he opened the door.
"Yeah."
"Hmmm… it's called fashion." He said giving me a hand.
"What do you me-"
"You got it girl!" Pansy laughed; completely forgetting Ron, as she high-fived Millicent; while Ron hurriedly ran beside me.
I definitely shivered at what I saw. SHE WILL MAKE ME WEAR THEM…
"No! It suites you perfectly, but something's missing." He said doing a thinking gesture. "I know!" He said as he opened my jewelry box, he pulled out my huge heart shaped pendant and a white satin chocker from her purse. "Here, it goes perfectly together." He said handing me the chocker, which now has the pendant on it. "That chocker is one of a kind, because I made it." He explained. "Wear it with your favorite ring and those diamond tear-drop earrings you made in my design room that time you got bored. Now sit down in front of the mirror." He instructed me, and I complied. He took off my wig and revealed my now almost shoulder length hair; I admit my hair grows long extremely fast. And since it's longer it was tame compared to my short nest-like hair before I came here. Ron pulled my hair in a loose bun using a pair of jade chopsticks that Tonks sent me (which I don't really know how to use), he left the front undone, hanging loosely reaching my chin. "There… Perfect."
I belong in the arts department for my high score in arts. After them, the head master spoke and then the party started. I saw different people, all dressed to impress. We got on our way to the buffet table when a person called…
"Why?"
He came inside me moments later, and then he pulled out and lied beside me. We just laid there him, embracing me as we relish the afterglow of our love making.
"Hi sweety!" my mom is calling?
"(sigh(again)) Okay here is an idea..."
"And you think they will believe it?" Hermione sighed.
"I'm really sorry, but I'm not quite ready for that." she said looking at the floor. "Let's just continue the lessons tomorrow." She said.
"Oh, Harry, Draco, This is Victor Krum. My boyfriend." And there was it, the look of contentment and happiness when she said the word boyfriend, and that look is also seen in Victor as he hears it.
"I... don't really have the slightest idea." Harry said losing his "determined" facial expression.
Since we're only going to the movies I choose to wear only a violet t-shirt with the words "She Will Be Loved" written in front with glittery red ink, I took out my denim pants and my floral flats. I also took out two ponytails from my dresser and tied my hair to two big tails and tucked them under a brown bonnet. I took several silver bracelets and rings and a butterfly necklace. I put two earings on my left ear a gold rose and a small silver circle with a blue stone, and one on my right ear, the rose. I took a body bag out of my cabinet and put my phones powder and a lip gloss in. I clipped my iPod on my shirt and connect it to my earphones and turned it on.
"So Mr. Black I need to talk to you about something if you don't mind." Mr. Weasley said. Sirius there's something I saw in Sirius face for a moment, but I thought it was just my imagination. He looked at me and smiled.
"So what happened?" Sirius asked as he sat on the couch at the left side of the fireplace.
*The SC has a meeting room the size of two classrooms(their office was different). The year level government & House Councils have normal size meeting rooms.
I just smiled and said. "Okay, so… when are we going to start rehearsing?"
"I like wearing the ring you bought me." I said, smiling at her. She smiled back.
"Nice to meet you too." I said.
"And we need to fix your face…" Faith said.
"No one does Harry; it just so happens that Slytherin girls LIKE you very much." Hermione said.

"Okay…" Ron said as he put his snacks down and ran outside.
"Hermione, nice dress!"
"Hey… Chill bro," He said scooting away. "I didn't mean any harm."
"I'm just here to take you to the student affairs office." He said, his eyes never leaving me.
"Really? But…"
"See that guy." Ren said pointing at a tall, dark and handsome guy, wearing a velvet black tux, leather shoes, green tie and gray undershirt, he is also wearing a vintage silver ring with a green stone, which might be jade. His hair is blond almost platinum, which I'm sure feels soft to the touch. His skin is flawlessly fair and those eyes… those captivating silver eyes that-'WHAT!' I thought as I snapped out of my fantasy. 'No fucking way! I didn't just check out a guy! NO! This is wrong!' "Hey Hannah." Ren said as she snapped her fingers in front of me. "You looked like you're gonna be sick." She said with a worried expression. I glanced at Hermoine and saw the same expression.

"You know, if you don't stop being adorable… I'll ravish you and make you moan all night long, I'll leave my marks all over your body and fuck you so hard; you won't be able to stand for a week." I said with a grin, which made him blush harder… this time I let go of control tackled him down my left arm supporting his back and attacked his neck again.
"Well, were the ones who should be saying that since we do not have time for losers like you… come now Pans." Millicent said as she walked pass us, Pansy in tow.
Okay, I'm back. And I'll have to warn you… there will be LEMONS here; so for those who don't like it, please skip that part. And for the pros at writing Lemons, please take it easy with me since this is only my third time in writing M scenes… and I don't have any first-hand experience so; yeah I'm apologizing beforehand.
And man I wasn't wrong… the place look awesome, with the reflection of the moon from the water. The moon's light shining through the trees, hitting the flowers below, the light that surrounds the lake.
"That…" I pointed at him.
Like you would…
"Good, I ordered a whole bottle of white wine."
"Mhmmm." Harry moaned as I kissed his neck, his weak spot. "Stop that!" He said trying to push me away.
"Don't tell me you're having second thoughts, that's a first for the likeness of you…" I heard Blaise said beside me.
Now I'm quite sure why I held on to thee,
"Not that easy."
"Do you
"No, not really… But its close, since being a muse means beautiful…yeah I think he did." He said smirking at me. I couldn't help but smile at that… but the red cheeks won't fade, DAMMIT!
I used the Student council pattern from the high school I came from. In my country Student councils varies from one school to another. But how the members were chosen were my idea…
"I said…" He paused and laughed. "I said, I like flat chested body builder girls too, it doesn't really matter to me, and you're still the same girl I loved." He smiled.
"Yes." She said looking at Ron.
"Easy on the carbs."
"They patterned their children's names with each other, didn't you notice. Potter's son's name is Harry James, while Sirius' daughter's name is Hannah Jennica. Why didn't Sirius named her after himself? I wonder, is James influence to Sirius that strong?" Flitwick explained.
I tried to push them both away from each other, only to get pulled roughly by someone.
who keeps eating 24/7…" I shot back,
PRO: Susan Bones
"Damn, Dray." I heard Blaise behind me. "That is one deep shit you got there oh thee!" I heard him joked with dumbest fake poetic tone ever, as the others laugh, fucking dumbasses.
'What the hell happened?' I thought to myself as I tried solving how many water will spill if I put a gram of Au (gold) in a full glass of salt water. And man! I was thinking about Draco's proposal(?) too much that I forgot the formula of whateverthefuck.
"Harry, but please call me Hannah, Hannah Black." I said with a smile as I shook his hand.
"Asshole."
"Just wait a little while babe, you're not ready yet."
"What a maniac." Draco sighed to himself as he walked towards his dorm room. "But still…" Draco smirked. "such a lovely and intoxicating addition to the already interesting arts department."
each other as we listen to MCR?"
"Hey, what did you say a little while ago about hair extensions?" I asked.
"Now, now; let's stop the behavior shall we?" The councilor interrupted. "Tomorrow, your punishments will start. For now, you're all free to go."
"Hey get out of there," Sirius said as he opened the door.
"I don't have any idea, but if she wants it that bad, the reason is 100% not good." Malfoy said. "Who is this?" He asked looking and pointing at me.
"Nice to meet you." Draco smiled as he reached for Victor's hand.
What does she meant by that?
"It's fine," He smiled. "We'll go to my brothers for help."
And that photo just happened to be just breath taking. Draco just finished drinking from the fountain, still a little parched, but still hot. He is standing by a huge glass window, and as Harry took the shot, a ray of afternoon light came through, making Draco's striking features stand out.
"Am I really going to fucki'n do this?" I asked myself as I walk in full gear down the hallway. If I may say so I look really great as a girl. I still have about thirty minutes before the bell rings so, I took a stroll around the hallways, I took out my Sony Ericsson and plugged in my earphones(since I forgot to recharge my Ipod ). Then a sound distracted me before I even put on the ear phones… and it's not coming from me!
"Please do that again." I asked probably blushing even more than before.
President: (senior)(no other positions) Tom Riddle
"Me neither," Sirius said walking past Harry. "If you break the door you'll pay." He added.
"No little sis. We just planned to trip you; we didn't plan on dumping our precious moochinos on you. But since these two were the victims, it's totally worth it." Fred said.
"Still, you don't have to rub it on my face!" Ron said.
"Fine! Let's find the two goons and were off!"
"Yes, yesterday. Where are you taking me?"
Which is impossible with a capital "I". Because I never settle for second best… and right now the best for me is Hannah. The beautiful and troublesome Hannah, yep I know she won't really be a challenge, but the people around me are challenge enough. And I've never been impressed and glad to meet someone for a long time, and I've been impressed with two other "someones" for a completely different reason. And I don't want to cuddle with those two… I might get an electric shock, a gift box with Poison Ivy inside or a real poisonous substance slipped on my drink.
Something I desired for my dear self only.
"You have your things with you?"
"Why? Because you found every quality you like in that single person." He smiled. "I know that feeling, that's what I felt when I knew I liked Ron."
"Then let's go to my room later, after this." He said before he pushed me off the ground, he smirked as he hovered above me. I stared at him; to be honest I really don't know what the hell is going on, until he kissed me. His lips were still as soft as the last time; the kiss was still sweet hot and passionate even though there is no tongue involved.
"Y-Yes I am." I answered lamely.
"Wow…"
"Great I actually have a s-daughter in first year myself." He gestured to the buffet table. "Ren darling!" He called.
"I won't. Being in the same department isn't an enough reason for me to favor you in this matter. What you are asking is ridiculous. And knowing both of you, you're the one who started the trouble. And that girl doesn't deserve to be expelled, both of you have done much more serious offences and both of you didn't got expelled. And you expected me to write a letter for her expulsion? You got to be deluded."
"Lucky me." I smirked as I flopped down on my chair.
"Are you okay?" He asked me.
"Yeah, it turned out to be more hilarious with those two." George said; coming out the wall with Fred.
"Hello Professor Hagrid." We all greeted back.
"I understand, I do it sometimes to, but you don't look like the type who listens to MCR." Harry said, amused.
"Yep." I replied. I really can't deny the nervousness in my tone. After all this will be the last time I'll see them until a couple of months. After the welcoming party the parents will be chased out… not before they filed the needed documents, they don't, but we will be escorted to our dorms as soon as the parents leaves the ballroom, so yeah.
"That was my twin brothers' stock room?"
I whined a little at this. I really want more. I reached out my arms and pulled him down, I kissed him. He returned the kiss, but he didn't stop fingering my hole, which turned me on even more.
"Wha?"
-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-
"Everything is ruined." She answered between sobs, never changing here position. I took one of the papers on the floor, and saw the most beautiful pink gown I've ever seen. I looked back to her. 'Did she design this?' I asked myself. I took every paper on the floor and saw different types of dresses, which were all equally beautiful, they're not really ruined, and everything's still visible.
"Hey Ren!" I greeted Ron as he stood there beside the fountain of the main hall.
I'll just march down there and say, "I'm a guy!"
"Hey Tonks…" Harry said while in looking in front.
." I grinned.
A little star I tuned out,
"I wonder?" Minerva said as something ring inside her head.
"Yep, it's my mission." I smiled.
"Suck." I ordered him. He quickly obliged as I felt him suck hard on my finger. I looked at him and to be honest it made a quite erotic sight. By the time I pulled out my finger it was perfectly lubricated. "Now, Babe; this will feel a little weird at first, but I promise you it will feel good later." I explained. He nodded his understanding.
I pull back from Draco but do not let him go, afraid I will lose him again.
“You are not your father, Draco. You are kind-hearted and generous. You are comical, witty, and sarcastic. You take care of me when I am sick without complaining and you make me dinner after a long day at the apothecary without complaint. You have the utmost patience with me when I am being bratty and you support me in everything I do even if I am wrong sometimes.” I am now cupping both of his cheeks with my hands now, dashing away the tears that keep coming with a small smile on my face, a genuine smile this time and continue, “You are not your father, Draco. Your father would never do any of those things for your mother and it is a lonely life for the both of them. We have a lively life, full of laughs and smiles and lots of love. You would make a wonderful father and our child would love you, Draco, your heart is so pure and I know you are scared of being your father but you are nothing like him. I do not believe you would ever harm a child and I know you go out of your way to help any child in need. And, I would hex you first before I would ever let you lay a hand on our child, Draco. You don’t have anything to be scared of, love. I’ll be there with you the whole way and we will do this together.” I am crying full blast by this time and Draco brings his hand up to cradle my face also, wiping my tears away with a sad, wishful smile on his face.
“What?” Cedric choked out, eyes wide.
“Why would I be mad, honey?”
Draco (clearly seduced by his award-winning smile, Harry thought) furrowed his eyebrows and frowned.
Blaise flinched, averting his eyes.
“Isn’t that what you’re doing right now…?”
“Great! Let’s go!”
Draco seemed dubious, but agreed nonetheless. Because he was secretly in love with Harry, obviously. Harry, keeping this knowledge to himself so as to not embarrass Draco, led him to the local café. He promptly ordered an Americano. Because Harry was Cool™ and Seductive™ and drank his coffee black. Draco, on the other hand, ordered a vanilla latte.
“Harry?” Sirius said when he was quiet for a bit too long. “What’s up? Is something wrong?”
Harry looked back and promptly saw Draco running towards him. Shoving the rest of his books in his locker, Harry turned to him with a raised eyebrow (courtesy of Tom Riddle).
“I shaved just for you,
Cedric’s brows rose and his mouth gaped, seemingly about to say something but unable to get any words out.
“Boo,” Harry pouted. “It’s not my fault. Malfoy’s in that class! As if I could focus on history when I could stare at his luscious locks instead.”
“You’ll see them back at Hogwarts, yeah?”
“Two days?! Harry, I can’t believe you’re seriously about to audition with absolutely no dance experience.”
“Well, yes, I am aware. Did you know you’re very handsome when you laugh, Siri?”
“You’re so cute,” Harry said incredulously.
“I love you,” he sobbed.
Luckily, the language branch had a convenient tutoring system in which the older students taking higher levels of the class could help the younger ones who were struggling. Harry was most certainly struggling.
Tom’s cheeks lightly flushed. “I’m not. I’m just questioning the purity of your intentions towards me.”
“Right. Well, um, right. Right. Yes—that’s, good. Quite good.”
“Perfect! You can teach me!” Harry announced, smiling smugly when he noticed Sirius’s slight blush. Was he embarrassed by knowing how to dance, or by him sitting in his lap, Harry wondered? Definitely the latter, Harry knew just how good his ass looked in those tights. He squirmed around a bit while Sirius just coughed, flushing.
“Aren’t they expensive? Just because I look posh doesn’t mean I
“Right.”
“Look, Sirius…” Harry said reluctantly.
“Sirius, we’re both underage,” Harry laughed.
Well.
“Well, I mean—it’s not like I was
Cedric rubbed the back of his head bashfully and gave a shy little smile. “I was kind of trying to woo you, actually. Y’know, like, ‘give me a call?’ And then you’d be like, ‘Oh, but I don’t have your number,’ and I’d casually write it down like, ‘Well, you do now,’ or um, something like that.”
five percent.”
Draco sighed.
“You know, Potter, given how clumsy you are, I’m honestly surprised you haven’t offed yourself yet. A man can only dream, I suppose.”
Ah well, Harry certainly didn’t think it was possible to die of self-combustion, but here Sirius Black was proving him wrong.
Tom was panting, hair in disarray, hand gripping his chest like a distressed maiden in a horror flick.
“No-o. I was just wondering if you wouldn’t mind letting me use the Slytherin printer? The one on the Gryffindor floor is broken.”
“Aww, thank you, Siri!” Harry nuzzled deeper into his embrace.
Cedric shrugged. “You’re cute. I like how you come in every day just to see me and pretend like you’re here for the coffee. And the way you glance up at me over the top of your mug when you think I’m not paying attention.”
was sexy.
Catching Snape’s glare from across the room, Harry cleared his throat and got out his notes. “Right, so… lab project?”
“Mom? You aren’t, like, mad?” Draco got out nervously.
After all, no amount of emotional bonding moments would protect them from Snape’s wrath.
Harry beamed, Draco flushed a beautiful shade of red, and even the bitter taste of Americano couldn’t wipe away the taste of Draco’s soft lips.
to say, but kept it to himself. Instead he sat next to Blaise Zabini and coughed.
“Lab project,” Blaise nodded solemnly.
“Mmh?” Harry got out, which was surprisingly literate considering his brain was melting at hearing Tom say his name.
Harry was only one year younger than the boy, but if getting called ‘kid’ was what got Sirius Black into his bedroom, he certainly didn’t mind.
Draco started to tear up a bit.
“Oh, you’re right! Thank you, Siri! I’m going now, everyone!” Harry quickly gave everyone a hug and rushed over to the stage, noticing out of the corner of his eye Sirius and Tom exchanging death glares.
Draco bit his lip.
Lily seemed to be at a loss for words, although her smile was seemingly encouraging.
Tom cleared his throat. “Will you hear me out, Harry?”

as long as the first letter is the same it counts as a nickname srry not srry i didn’t make the rules
Everyone came to see Harry’s audition, including, much to everyone’s surprise, Tom Riddle. Harry practically leaped with joy upon seeing him and promptly rushed into his chest.
“What?!” Blaise laughed outright. “Of course not! My dad’s actually in the FBI. Criminology runs in the family.”
“To be honest, I watched Hannibal recently, and he was kind of hot, so I think my morals have dropped a bit…”
Harry hummed noncommittedly, still confused, but filing the actions away as Sirius’s usual strange antics.
There weren’t actually many tangible differences between the dorm houses, but because the Slytherin one was a bit more expensive to live in, all the posh families tended to send their kids there. And everyone knew the bourgeoisie
“Oh my god, I’m
Forcibly pushing Sirius away, Harry came face to face with a look of hurt that squeezed Harry’s heart.
“Great!” Harry beamed. “I can’t wait!”
“Ah—I know, ballet,” Sirius mumbled out, slightly embarrassed.
Harry had a tutoring session with Tom that day, but he supposed ditching it wouldn’t be so bad. Tom deserved to get ego-check anyways.
the issue, i think, is that time is slowly slipping from my grasp. one day it's october, then suddenly it's 2021 and mr president is getting impeached 2.0. it's like when you read a fanfiction and it's slow paced but they also skip a lot of scenes so then you're like 'huh, did i miss something?' except instead of fanfiction it's real life and what i'm missing is my youth
Harry didn’t quite know what to feel. He found it was easier, in fact, to try not to feel anything at all. It wasn’t that he was
This was, of course, where the issue stemmed from. It was entirely impossible to focus when Tom was tutoring him when he could be staring at his lips instead. Those lips…
“The only thing telling him would make him do is get me locked up in his secret dungeon. He probably has a giant snake down there that he would feed me to.”
Cedric let out a relieved breath, smiling. “You can’t blame me for being nervous! You’re all lovely and sweet, and I’m just… y’know. Even if you liked me at first, that doesn’t mean you still would once you got to know me!”
“Potter!”
Tom’s eyes flashed red. “Not exactly?”
i am particularly grateful to those of you who asked about updates because you convinced my lazy ass to actually write another chapter
Harry sighed.
12:23
“It’s good,” he said again, clearing his throat.
“Draco, I’ve cradled you in my bosom while you sobbed your eyes out; I think you can call me Harry by now.”
“You don’t want to see my search history, Sirius, it would scar even the bravest of warriors,” Harry said solemnly, shaking his head.
tom!!! cmon don’t be like that! you had me do twenty just last week!!
12:06
Sirius looked over at him, took a sip of his Dr. Pepper, and nodded as if deciding something. He leaned over a gave Harry a featherlight kiss on the lips.
Speaking of beautiful alone time, Cedric was making his way over to Harry’s table after the only other customer had left. He sat down in the chair across from him and grinned.
“Anyways! This isn’t about me. This is about you, Draco! Are you ready?”
The Gryffindor printer was not, of course, actually broken. Hermione made sure that everyone was well-informed of proper machine usage the first day they were assigned to their dorms. When Harry was sitting on Draco’s bed, naked from the waist up, waiting for the blonde boy to grab him a spare shirt because he ‘accidentally’ spilled his water bottle all over his front, however, Harry knew his plan was a success.
inviting Draco,” Tom protested. “I’ll go with you.”
“So, does that mean you’re very… flexible?” Harry asked, wagging his eyebrows suggestively.
not all of us can afford to come here by leeching off daddy’s money ;)
“This weekend, preferably. Saturday, maybe?”
“I don’t need a tutor,” Blaise sneered. “I’m not an idiot.”
“Harry! What’s up? I got your text and came as soon as I could! Are you okay?” Hermione gasped, out of breath.
“Right…” Harry drawled. “That makes absolute sense. Not
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not… exactly?”
Harry, feeling tired and rebellious, decided to skimp on the work. When he showed up to his next session with no pages, however, he was met with such a look of disdain that he practically melted to the ground. He was then faced with Tom’s silent treatment for the rest of the session. In fact, he was faced with Tom’s silence for the next two sessions, sometimes accompanied by a raised eyebrow, until Harry finally gave in and wrote the pages.
“That's,” Tom hesitated. “That’s unfortunate, I’m sorry.”
He tasted like vanilla latte.
“Hm?”
“Yes. Well, you’re—you’re, um, not quite so bad yourself, I suppose.”
Draco scowled and didn’t reply.
“I dunno. Maybe it’s… dubious stalking. Dub-Stalk,” Harry snapped his fingers.
“Well, I could hardly miss my darling pupil’s big audition, hm?” Tom purred out, ruffling Harry’s hair. Harry leaned into his touch eagerly, giggling. The rest of the cast watched with surprise, not knowing how close Harry was with the other boy. The two chatted for a while, Harry’s blush gradually deepening, before an arm grasped Harry’s shoulder harshly, pulling him back.
“Well, I’m off then. Thanks for the sweatshirt,” Sirius winked. “I’ll be seeing you around.”
Harry flinched. “I’d rather not talk about it, actually.”
“…We have a dance troupe?” Peter squeaked out meekly, slightly intimidated by Harry’s Gay Aura™.
“Oh, I was waiting for you to ask!” Harry said excitedly, rushing over to his messenger bag and taking out a slightly wrinkled piece of paper, advertising the dance troupe’s upcoming performance. Harry shoved the paper in Sirius’s face, eyes sparkling.
“Could you please not call me that? And I’m not telling you; you always just copy my answers. If you actually paid attention in class, maybe you’d be able to do it yourself?”
“Yes, that—that makes sense. I suppose I’ll just be going then,” Harry frowned, attempting to gather both his things and the remains of his dignity.
Harry nodded. “You don’t have to feel obligated to say anything if you don’t want to, thou—”
Later, when the two of them lied side-by-side on Draco’s bed, ignoring the puffy redness of Draco’s eyes, Harry smiled.
would be the naughty one in this relationship, but oh, how wrong I was.”
Tom hummed. “An amusement park, huh… I’ve never been.”
Even so, when no one else was looking, Draco sometimes flashed him a warm, genuine smile he knew none of his other friends got to see. Somehow, that made it all worth it.
When they sat down, Draco seemed to be hesitant about something, so Harry kicked him under the table until he got it out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not as flexible as you’re going to be after I twist you into a fucking pretzel. Did you drink Viagra for breakfast or something, Harry?”
Draco scoffed.
12:13
“It was fun,” Harry smiled. “Thanks for teaching me, Siri.”
“Harry?” Blaise said, grinning as he saw Harry snap out of his daze. “You there?”
“Listen, Harry. I need your help.”
“It’s what my uncle used to say, you know. Before he beat me. I used to pretend I was straight so he wouldn’t lock me in the cupboard.”
“Mhmm. That tutor of yours still overworking you?”
Harry’s stomach fluttered.
“What? No! How do you know I have a crush on Tom Riddle?” Harry gasped. “Also, he isn’t a serial killer!”
“Nonsense. If you weren’t there to rant at my father, I probably would have broken down and cried.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You two are getting along too well lately,” Snape said. “I don’t like it. You come here to learn, not to have fun.”
The tutoring sessions took place in Tom’s room. Tom’s personal, private room, of course, because as a prefect he apparently got his own bedroom. Which meant that Harry would be all alone with the boy of his dreams in his bedroom.
When Draco reluctantly did so, Harry immediately saved his contact as ‘Posh Twink’ and sent him a winky face. Draco glanced at his phone, frowned, and left him on read.
“Yeah, me neither,” Harry admitted, letting out a soft laugh.
He might have also gotten on his knees and begged for forgiveness.
me at one am: ok but what if harry potter was an unapologetic gay boy just trying his best
“Right, well, now that we’ve gotten all that sorted out, maybe we should get back to tutoring?” Harry said diplomatically, firmly shoving his embarrassment inside the Things We Do Not Talk About section of his mind.
tell me anything you do want to. Look at my cute rainbow pin, doesn’t that just
“But now I see it in an endearing way,” Tom finished calmly. “The fact of the matter still stands, however, that I feel… uncomfortable forming strong relations when I don’t know what my future holds.”
Harry choked on his coffee. “Excuse me?! I wear a dorky rainbow heart pin in my hair and you think I’m
are you ridiculously attractive, but then I find out you’re also kind, and hard-working, and painstakingly genuine. You go out of your way to hold the door open for old grannies!”
12:07
Tom Riddle, two years his senior, was the most attractive person Harry ever met. Yes, even more so than Sirius or Draco. While Sirius had a sort of rugged charm and Draco had an elegant sort of beauty, Tom Riddle could only be described as
“Oh, please,” Tom huffed. “Do you think I don’t notice when you’re on your phone instead of doing the French work I give you? You’re always on that… yellow one.”
Tom, however, was sharper than Harry thought.
Harry shivered.
decide to kill someone, it wouldn’t be him.
lmao no i was in bio club in my old school so i just rushed thru it no biggie. anyways i sent u the doc so feel free to write the intro and conc whenever
jk rowling who?
dark academia. What a fucking e-boy.
Draco grabbed him by the arm and slammed him against the wall.
“Let’s—let’s get started on dancing. I mean, there’s not much we can do in a couple of days, but you can get the foundations down, yeah?”
“You,” Harry got out, wheezing and wiping tears from his eyes, “are adorable.”
“I just think, yeah, if I’m going to be your boyfriend for the day, we might as well make a proper date of it.”
“Than James, I mean. I thought you were similar, in the beginning, but you’re not. There’s hardly a resemblance, really, other than the looks and name. No, even the looks are—you’re smaller. James is more rugged, sporty. You’re… softer.”
Blaise shook his head. “It’s not about Draco. It’s just that…” Blaise broke off, biting his lip harshly.
Tea was a very pleasant affair. Draco’s father seemed a bit shocked at finding out his son was gay, but after being properly chastised by Harry for his poor behavior and offensive language, he seemed to appear properly regretful and promised Draco he would love him no matter what.
“Woah, hey, Sirius!” Harry breathed out, tumbling after him. “At least let me say goodbye to my friends first!”
Harry frowned, and Draco couldn’t seem to be able to meet Harry’s eyes.
“Harry—” Tom began, glaring angrily at Sirius as he did so.
“Hello! What are you reading?” Harry, having interacted with plenty of bookworms during his Tumblr days, knew that the way to this girl’s heart was through copious amounts of literary discussions.
“Oh man, that would suck.”
“I’m not—”
“I always knew you were gay,” he teased.
or anything like that. More like a quick
“Aw, Tom, I’m sorry, that must be har—”
“No, like—like a date. I want to introduce you as my boyfriend.”
hey hoom what pages did we have to do for mcg’s class?? srry i fell asleep lol
What a dilemma.
Harry’s mouth shaped into an ‘o’ of realization. “Oh! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you by making fun of Slytherin, I just—”
Harry smirked. He glanced at Draco, whose cheeks were burning red and who was desperately attempting to avoid looking at Harry.
12:10
(See the end of the chapter for
“You too,” he coughed out, slightly blushing.
Harry sighed and gave Sirius a rueful smile. Harry swore to himself when he came to Hogwarts that he wouldn’t pretend to be anyone else ever again—that no matter what anyone else said, Harry would never be afraid to be Harry.
“Well, is it really stalking if it’s consensual?” Cedric mused.
“You don’t get it at all, Hoom. Texting solidifies friendships. Also, what did you get for the second question?”
Cedric laughed and his eyes wrinkled in such a handsome way that Harry just
Blaise’s eyes met Harry’s hesitantly, and shrugged.
Harry tried to give Sirius a supportive smile, but it came off as more of a grimace.
“Potter?”
12:06
Blaise gave Harry a pat on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, Harry. If you become a mafia wife, I can use my FBI connections to keep you safe.”
Cedric snapped his fingers. “See! I told you so!”
Cedric gave Harry such an earnest and pure smile that Harry couldn’t help but tear up.
Harry introduced him to Hermione, who was pleasantly surprised that Sirius was an avid reader of Dostoyevsky and promptly encouraged Harry to marry him. Sirius, in turn, introduced him to his group of friends.
Harry gasped. His roommate was never a serial killer, he was a fuckboy all along! What a reveal.
“Yes, but I—”
“Oh,” Blaise seemed surprised. “Harry, right? My roommate?”
“You are an absolute butt nugget, do you know that?” Harry
“Draco, your mom just called your dad a boomer,” Harry said, pleasantly surprised.
“Oh yeah, the one where you dove into the Great Lake looking for the Giant Squid? My mates and I did the same thing back in first year, good times. Moony got pinched by a crab.”
“Child protective services…? Is that what you did?”
They decided to end the day on the Ferris-wheel because Harry insisted it would be romantic. They sat on opposite sides until Harry determinedly stood up and sat right next to Tom, snuggling into his side. Tom coughed and wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder. Both of them were flushed red. Panini bread for days.
“BAM!” Harry yelled, dropping to the floor and whipping his short hair around as diva-like as possible.
Harry was now stuck with the difficult decision of deciding whether or not to pursue a crush on a suspected serial killer. One on hand, murder was pretty bad. One the other hand, Blaise had very kissable lips.
After two weeks passed, however, and Harry’s French level was still abysmally low, Tom snapped.
Blaise smiled a bit ruefully. “It’s just that… I was actually meant to live at the Slytherin dorms, at first.”
“Hey Malfoy!”
Once it picked up, Harry screamed with joy and excitement only to look over in the middle of it to see Tom deathly white and looking like his soul was about to slip away from his body.
Harry froze. This wasn’t exactly in the plan. Harry considered himself quite good at being suave, but as the response he usually got to his saucy lines was laughter, he didn’t actually know what to do when someone else instigated the flirting.
He half-heartedly pushed Harry away and started walking away, but before he could make it out his room, Harry flipped him around and hugged him.
12:11
“I practically have a— a— a harem!” Harry screeched.
Harry arrived a bit early, wanting to secure his desired seat on the train, but soon students began filing into the train. He was pleasantly surprised when the first person to sit in his booth was an adorable blonde boy whose entire being screamed ‘posh twink.’ Harry, having made it a goal to become known as a homosexual sex god during high school, was excited at the chance to secure his first conquest via his superior seduction skills. However, just as Harry opened his mouth to woo the boy with his sexy pick-up lines, the blonde twink spoke.
“Yeah, I guess, but—woah!” Harry tripped a bit as he was dragged by Sirius to the door. “Bye, everyone! Thanks for coming! Especially you, Tom! I’ll see you Saturday!” he yelled out before being pulled away to the exit. They ended up not being able to find a nearby coffeeshop, instead settling down on the grass near the vending machine outside.
“You’re very cute, Draco, you know that?”
The heartache was still there, but it was a bit pleasant. He felt sated and bittersweet in a way that he thought quite suited the idea of the Sirius Black Experience.
They weren’t dating, but Harry felt romantic, so he changed Draco’s contact name to ‘Draco <3.’
“Oh, hello!” The girl, who seemed pleasantly shocked by Harry’s emergence, finally looked up from her book. “I’m reading a Russian novel, The Brothers Karamazov. It was Dostoyevsky’s final novel, you see.”
“You know, for someone who copied Ellen DeGeneres’s hairstyle, you sure are surprisingly homophobic.”
huge thanks to everyone who left loving comments on the previous chapters <3 <3
“Here, look!” Harry pointed to a man on the poster, in the middle of some acrobatic move.
12:12
He thought that he was already ahead of the game, knowing fancy French words like ‘bonsoir’ and ‘merci beaucoup.’ Little did he know that
Harry groaned and shielded his eyes. “Stop,” he moaned out.
Ah, yes, the Spilled Drink Method™. Works every time.
Harry took a moment to imagine Sirius in tight ballet pants and discreetly wiped away his drool.
Draco looked so honest, so hopeful and helpless all at once, that Harry couldn’t stop himself from giving him a little kiss on his lips. Just a peck.
The shop was relatively empty; for some reason it was never too busy around the time Harry came in. No, that’s not right, Harry knew the reason why... Fate. The gods were blessing Harry so he could have beautiful alone time with Cedric.
“Perhaps we should rest now, hm?” Sirius whispered after the music ended, seemingly just as caught up in the mood as Harry and unwilling to break the gentle quiet of their breathing.
safe space to you?”
Harry stared at her incredulously. “Because he’s hot? Honestly Hermione, for a so-called ‘straight girl,’ you sure are kind of slow with these things.”
Like most things in Harry’s life, this ended in disaster.
Harry gasped.
Mainly, the fact that he didn’t really need tutoring anymore.
“Right, okay, never-mind. I’m leaving.”
“Once a week, perhaps?” Tom suggested, eyes narrowed with amusement.
12:05
“I- I think it’s cute. Your pin, that is.”
“Clearly because you recognize my advanced level seduction skills. I could write my own WikiHow. Anyways, you didn’t answer my question!” Harry said, wagging his finger menacingly.
Harry gave a pirouette and slammed the door shut.
Harry blinked once, twice, and then spent the rest of the day internally screaming.
my friend: why don't you try writing a fanfic
“Well, no, because Dumbledore is a geezer,” Harry huffed. “But there’s one visiting from out of town! It’s one of those, y’know, traveling ones.”
Harry still sees Tom’s judgmental eyebrow raise in his nightmares.
Harry shrugged and there was a moment of silence before Tom widened his eyes in understanding.
Harry smiled smugly and grabbed Tom’s hand, dragging him to the entrance. Tom gripped his hand firmly and bit his lip, allowing Harry to eventually bring him up to the first ride.
“I’m sorry. God, Harry, I really am sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking. I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea in the first place. You can punch me if you want; I deserve it.”
Harry didn’t know whether to consider his luck incredibly generous or incredibly disastrous when his tutor ended up being a literal angel. Not in terms of personality, of course. He was more like Satan in that regard. But looks wise--- he took Harry’s breath away. Fallen angel indeed.
“I mean, you’re always reading those books! I saw you reading one on medieval torture once!” Harry pouted.
Cedric smiled fondly, “Why do I get the feeling you use the spilling coffee technique often?”
look nice. He was wearing a nicely fit dark green sweater with black dress pants that
“I’m disowning you.”
Harry sat, of course, at the very front of the train. It was important to let his presence be known to everyone who walked in, establishing his place as the alpha lesbian. Hogwarts unfortunately had a dress code consisting of black trousers, a grey cardigan, and a tie, which meant that Harry had to save his gloriously flamboyant fashion for the weekends. However, Harry was sure that the adorable rainbow heart pin he stuck in his hair would be enough to impose his exuberant homosexuality on any and all passerby.
“I’m afraid to say you’re a bit young for my tastes, Harry,” he cooed.
Harry could see Sirius was about to refuse, so he quickly got out his puppy eyes and pout. No one could resist the puppy eyes and pout.
“Yes. I was about to complain to her, actually, given that you have had a considerable lack of progress despite our numerous sessions. Imagine my surprise, however, when before I could even say a word, the teacher promptly gave me a hug and called me a miracle worker.”
“A traveling dance troupe… Like a circus?” Remus asked.
“Malfoy’s a homophobic prick,” Hermione frowned.
Tom got closer to Harry, who was forced to back up even more to the wall. He could feel Tom’s breath on his neck. “And you let him?”
Harry.”
“Shit, I’m so sorry!” Harry cried out, quickly using his own sleeve to attempt to wipe down Sirius’s chest. “Are you okay?”
Draco blushed and scowled. “Christ, were you always this sassy?”
?” Tom hissed.
Harry was out of breath as well, but for other reasons.
Tom growled.
Silence ensued.
Tom huffed. “I would appreciate it if you didn’t share stories of your conquests in front of me, however. I am a jealous man by nature.”
“I assure you I definitely don’t want to murder anyone,” Blaise laughed.
It was when Sirius started hanging out in his dorm room more often, when he started hugging Harry like he never wanted to let go, that he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Oh, right. Well, I mean, you could just call child protective services or something if things get out of hand.”
“I—” Sirius swallowed, looking away. “Yeah, okay,” he sighed, resigned.
“Um, yeah?” Harry squeaked. “What about him?”
“Ugh, what on earth is a

to me,” Blaise hissed. “I’m dropping this class, I don’t understand any of it.”
“Fuck them,” Harry stared into Blaise’s eyes and nodded solemnly.
Wait a minute…
“Oh, I’m sure I know just what kind of dreams you’re having about me,” Harry winked.
Harry wanted to cry, just a bit, but he urged Sirius to continue anyways.
“It’s fine, just—remind me to teach you how social media works when we get back.”
“Aww, Draco, come on. I’m joking. What do you need help with?”
Harry’s heart clenched painfully, jealousy starting to rise in his throat.

“Ow! Violence is never the answer, Siri!”
Sirius Black didn’t notice.
Harry hummed thoughtfully. “Have you considered getting a tutor?”
“Tom, you came!” Harry exclaimed.
“What if we go on a date?” Harry interrupted.
Harry grabbed Draco’s hand firmly, beamed, and led him to the Malfoy Manor. When they reached the house, Harry whistled loudly.
Harry squinted his eyes even more. “Because you’re also a serial killer?”
Draco gaped.
“Don’t tease me!” Cedric harrumphed. “You could’ve liked the bad boy type, or something. And I bet you’re all popular at school, too!”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, trying to figure out what Tom was trying to tell him.
Harry nodded silently and they sat on the floor, backs resting against the wall, eagerly drinking up the water Harry pulled out. Harry was nestled in the nook of Sirius’s arm, both of them reluctant to part. Harry found himself remembering the easy comfort they found in each other’s bodies back when they were ‘dating.’ They had not been in such close contact since Harry confronted Sirius about his feelings, and he forgot just how much he missed being engulfed by the man’s body. Harry nuzzled into Sirius’s torso, deciding to savor the moment while he could.
“It’s—the same vibes. Essentially.”
This time, Draco smiled back.
wink.
“Padfoot can dance!” Peter grinned cheekily, while Sirius groaned.
Harry faltered a bit and blushed, glancing up shyly at Cedric. “You mean it? You’re… interested? Even though I’ve been kind of stalkerish?”
Well, if he had to break the news to Sirius, he may as well be blunt about it.
Sirius chewed on his lip and frowned. After a second, his shoulders slumped.
Cedric shrugged. “I think… I would be honored to be by your side, but if you choose someone else then… That just means they make you happier, and as long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters.”
“There’s no way anyone wouldn’t be scared on this—this—death contraption!” Tom exclaimed angrily as the two of then stumbled out of the ride.
“Yeah! Well, no! It’s complicated!” Harry sighed. “On one hand, it’s embarrassing because he sees me do stupid shit. On the other hand, maybe he thinks that’s endearing and he’ll fall in love with me. It’s anyone’s game at this point, Hermione!”
Sirius Black, who was also on the Gryffindor floor of the dorms, could simply just go to his own room to change. From what Harry had seen of the boy, however, critical thought did not appear to be his strong suit, and he desperately wished he wouldn’t notice.
“Oh yes yes, snakes are better, blah blah, I get it. Can I use your printer or not? It’s for the lab.”
“I can use the internet too,” Tom hissed out angrily. “I know all about your kind. With your—your Tik Toks and Grindrs.”
12:04
The taller boy nuzzled his forehead with his own, kissed his nose, and then got up.
“In a…. ‘I want to go on more dates with you’ way?”
It’s like that, then.
Harry gave Sirius a kiss on the nose, ruffled his hair, and sent him back to his room with the promise that they would still be friends.
Sirius gave him lascivious smirk. “Sure kid, take me away.”
“Some may call me that, yes. I prefer Harry.”
“Thank you. Anyways, the point of the matter is—I’d like you to come with me.”
“Are you sure? They have Tom Riddle, and I know you think he’s a hunk…” Blaise teased.
please excuse me while i eliminate myself from existence
Harry didn’t quite know what to say.
“Harry, what the literal fuck are you doing?” James exclaimed, something all the Marauders were currently wondering. The boys and Lily were sitting around in Remus’s dorm room when Harry burst through the door, wearing yoga pants and a headband (rainbow-colored, of course), and started twirling around haphazardly.
It took a couple of weeks for Tom to break. They had tutoring sessions three times a week, forty-five minutes each. For the first few sessions, Tom was still the epitome of gentle and patient—the perfect honor student.
Cedric squinted. “You can’t tell me you don’t have
“Look, Pads. I know you’re in love with James,” he saw Sirius open his mouth in protest but quickly cut him off. “No, shh, look, you don’t have to argue. I’m not blind. I can hear the tiny violin playing whenever you mope over him and Lily going off on their midnight rendezvous.”
“Please don’t leave me for my ovaries,” Harry muttered in a daze.
Harry tsked. “Don’t be so stubborn. You sound like Draco, and he’s a
At first Harry considered asking Sirius for help. His family was apparently part-French, and it wasn’t as if they were on bad terms after their ‘break up.’ He still hung out with the Marauders regularly and the only time it was awkward was when Sirius shot him these guilty, pitying glances.

Sirius nodded. “Loved it. Especially the sound effects you added—‘wham, bam, shazam!’—it was quite the show.”
“Oh, please,” he sniffed. “We all know you were simply projecting your dirty fantasies onto me.”
“A thot!” Harry exclaimed. “Tom, how do you even know what that means?”
“What!” Harry squawked in outrage. “That’s messed up! Why would they do that?!”
whether Harry's playlist is called 'Delicate Vibes' with a sunflower emoji or 'Delicate Vibes' with (sunflower emoji) typed out is up to interpretation
“Well, you have to stretch, Harry. That’s Dance 101.”
“Christ, you’re so rich, Draco. If you don’t get disowned, maybe you could be, like, my sugar daddy or something.”
Harry was absolutely terrible at French. He signed up for it thinking it would be a powerful asset to add to his seduction arsenal; he would walk up to cute boys and whisper French nothings into their ears. This master plan was greatly flawed, however, in that Harry apparently underestimated how difficult it would be to learn.
The barista—Cedric—widened his eyes in surprise when Harry fell to the ground and quickly sprinted over to him to see what was wrong.
Blaise chuckled, “Yeah, you’re right. Well, maybe we can get to know each other now?” At that, Blaise smiled suavely and winked.
“Wow. Well, that’s, uh, news to me,” Harry said, shifting his eyes around. His eyes firmly landed on a particularly interesting spot on the wall.
Harry smirked. “Maybe.”
Now, Harry did not see his roommate very often. Whenever Harry was in his dorm room, the other boy was either sleeping or off gallivanting who knows where. Harry saw him sometimes in the library reading up on serial killers. Serial killers! As such, Harry speculated that the boy was likely planning a murder and tended to stay away from him.
,” Blaise groaned, smashing his head against the desk for the nth time. Class had ended a few hours ago, but since Blaise was struggling a bit, they decided to finish it up together at their dorm room later that evening. Their progress was… minimal.
Sirius only laughed louder while Lily tried to calm him down. “I didn’t know you could dance, Harry!” she remarked.
Hermione gave up trying to argue and plopped herself down on Harry’s bed.
mind, but not the fact that you’re in love with Prongs. I mind that you’re using me as a replacement.”
“Right.”
i don't know her 💅
The first time Harry met Tom was when the teacher introduced his new tutor. Upon seeing him, Harry choked on his spit and his entire English vocabulary flew out the window. Which was brilliant, really, considering it probably led Tom to believe that Harry was not only hopeless in French, but in his native language as well.
Oh no! Harry was most certainly not expecting to deal with a homophobe right off the bat. He had certainly known he would come across bumps in his homosexual agenda, but it was a bit disheartening to see it happen so soon. Nonetheless, Harry would not be discouraged. He remembered the WikiHow articles he had bookmarked on what to do when encountering douches: stay calm and don’t antagonize them. Harry took a deep breath in and stayed rational.
“Sorry, what?”
“Sure, Draco, I get it. When do you wanna do it?”
“Are you okay?” he asked, eyebrows creased in a beautiful little worried furrow.
“What? What do I have to do with this?
Draco swiftly turned away and started walking towards his dormitory, but when he stopped and glanced back before continuing on, Harry grinned and followed after him.
Harry thought that his scowl looked especially cute today.
“Excuse me?”
“Oh,” the girl’s eyebrows furrowed. “That’s good! I’m straight myself, but I was a proud member of the GSA club at my old school. I’m very much a believer of the gay rights movement.” The girl gave Harry a small, shy smile.
, if, when the time comes that I feel secure in where I am, you and I are still in contact and still feel…
“Come on,” Harry insisted. “Isn’t it romantic? Being whisked away to the traveling dance troupe by a handsome man… It’s like Phantom of the Opera!”
He was just about to leave Tom’s room in a rush when he was stopped by the other boy calling his name.
Harry teared up slightly. “Oh, Tom, that means the world.”
“Fancy seeing you here,” Cedric said with a sly sort of smile.
“Yes, sir."
“Yeah? You didn’t call anyone about it?”
“So,” Tom said coolly, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. “Sirius Black, hm?”
“Right… What am I looking at here, exactly?”
“What?! Why? Why can’t I work with Draco like I usually do?” Harry said in outrage.
Blaise’s shoulders relaxed slightly. “Yeah?” he breathed out, relieved.
“Yes! Just like that.”
“If you won’t leave, then I will,” he muttered quietly.
Tom nodded. “If I am to achieve my plan of world domination, being tech savvy is a must.”
“Yeah.”
Harry hesitated.
Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “And why would an attractive barista like you want my number? I haven’t even gotten to the seduction part of my plans yet! I was going to spill coffee all over my shirt so you’d let me change in the backroom or something, where I’d commence sexily stripping.”
It was comfortable, lying in the silence with Draco. He could hear every breath the blonde took, could see it in the way his chest rose and fell rhythmically.
12:52
Harry’s mouth fell open in shock.
Something flashed in Draco’s eyes and his grip on Harry’s arm left visible nail indents, almost breaking the skin.
“Yeah, well, like you said… he’s practically a serial killer. That lowers his attractiveness by
“Stop! Don’t say anything. I’m moving booths.” Harry got up, slamming his palms on the table in front of him, and started looking for another seat. He would let the blonde prick stew in his embarrassment at having a dubiously lesbian looking haircut and wouldn’t grant him the satisfaction of thinking of a comeback. While most of the train was already moderately filled up, he spotted a girl sitting alone at the very back, immersed in a book. Harry quickly made his way over to her and plopped down across from her seat, placing his bag under the table.
