years are disqualified from engaging in annual Quidditch matches have swept the students up in a frenzy.
Harry spent the next few days poring over and familiarizing with the contents, never expecting another correspondence from the sender.
– never had a statement rung so true for him. Misses all the provocations, thinly veiled insults, the back-and-fro banter and their animosity - now that Draco rescinded their unspoken agreement to constantly be at each other’s throats, Harry feels another part of his identity crumbling from his hold, helpless except to loathe anyone who steals his place, catching the Slytherin’s exclusive attentiveness.
Although prepared to an extent, the surprise and shock still catches them unawares. The map clearly shows majority of Slytherins located in the hospital wing while the remaining ones are cooped up in the Dungeons. Lavender Brown’s report hits truth on the nose then. Alas, the mystery only intensifies the more details slowly trickle out.
Draco doesn’t offer up any personal information nor does he demand anything in return; willing to patiently listen to the golden hero rants and refusing to even provide unsolicited advice in spite of his inner control freak’s ramblings.
The other, sane half berates him thoroughly by explaining, a name and face to his raging jealousy would only do more harm than good.
Harry, however, is back to checking out the opposite table at the interruption – some habits are hard to break than others, not as if he is trying to be honest. Although, he is soon dragged to the present by his best friend’s lecture on ethics and moral grey grounds.
Ron takes this news the hardest while Hermione wasn’t even nonplussed. Being the loyal best friend he was, Ron came around eventually, even started to joke around about
Which is why, Draco no longer pays even a shred of interest towards the trio, at least not in public!
Fear of losing his chance with Malfoy, once their last year at Hogwarts slips by without their paths crossing, should the stubborn git stick to his guns about disregarding Harry – he writes a letter (kinda freaking out the whole time) to Icarus, requesting his counsel.
Well, not really unnamed as the mysterious sender prefers to call himself, Icarus. The significance of the name and its tragic back-story isn’t lost on Harry.
A moment later, regret like nothing he had ever experienced before slammed into him. His emotions took their cue, and piled on top of him one at a time. Draco could only stumble out of the way of the invading Death Eaters, with Bellatrix and Greyback in the lead.
They took turns, mother and her friends, telling him the story of the boy-who-lived and the dark lord who died. Each word out of their mouth was practically inhaled by him; Draco could rarely recall a moment in his childhood when he had sat so still, and paid such close attention. He could not believe that the Potter boy had lived through such a thing in his life. With Potter’s parents dying in their attempt to protect him, leaving one-year-old Potter at the mercy of such a powerful man, the outcome would startle anyone: Potter, a baby who likely couldn’t even walk, defeated the all-powerful dark lord.
He suddenly felt he had a new perception of things, and some part of himself had been let go and replaced with something utterly soothing almost.
Potter had still been beside him. They had even been roomed together, along with two other boys; Terry Boot of Ravenclaw, and Justin Finch-Fletchley of Hufflepuff. Draco had been sure some type of consideration had gone into the four of them being roomed together besides them being from different houses.
He had known that sheer determination and stubbornness would win them nothing as long as they were attempting to go against what had now become Potter’s very nature. Once it was known that a Veela was to have a mate, most people knew to encourage them to quickly find their mate and consummate the bond. While the Veela would not have died if they were unable to find their mate, it had been pretty set in stone that their life would be shrouded in grey, and even mustering up the energy to smile would become a struggle as the days passed.
Draco had been even less enthusiastic about the idea then even Weasley. He had little doubt that he did not deserve to step foot in Hogwarts. No amount of his effort in helping out the light had been enough to completely abate his guilt for being the one to open the door to the Death Eaters. However, his mother had seen it as a major opportunity, and while she had not outright demanded for him to go, he had known she would have been disappointed if he hadn’t.
At that moment, his father had to be away for a longer period of time than usual, which left his mother to watch over him in the meantime. Draco recalled his mother, along with two other women, having tea in the garden during a breezy sunny day. He had been given a rare break from his studies to ride on his trainee broom. They had spent hours, casually and as cunningly as possible, dragging out information from each other, when their gossip had turned towards the dark lord, and his past defeat.
He had brought up the subject much later on that same day, with Potter resting in between his legs, recovering from his orgasm, but Potter had easily diverted his attention by taking Draco’s still swollen cock into his mouth and shoving three of his rectangle-like finger up Draco’s still loose arse.
Neither of them had said a word for the longest time after Potter finally awoke fully. The both of them simply sat and took each other in, as if they were suddenly seeing each other for the first time.
The Order had not been exactly welcoming, even with Potter’s memory to soften the blow. Draco had completely understood that he had put them in a difficult situation. All the same, he had every intention of milking them for every shred of sympathy in order to help his cause. There had even been a vote, which hadn’t been in his favour, but with Potter standing by his side and Ganger and Weasley standing behind him (more out of loyalty), there was little possibility he would be turned away.
On the first night at Hogwarts, Draco had declared himself Potter’s enemy. The thought of making another attempt at gaining Potter’s friendship never once crossed his mind.
But even with all that he put her through, Pansy still had stood strong, and he truly admired her for that. She had been one of the bravest girls Draco had ever met, and no one would have been able to convince him otherwise.
Draco was neck deep in his desperation by then, with little way out of it. His mind had been so jumbled and scattered, he wasn’t sure if he was capable of competent thought any longer. The pressure of his situation was even further heightened by Potter suddenly taking an interest in anything and everything having to do with Draco. Most of his time had been spent between avoiding Potter and stressing over his lack of progress with the vanishing cabinet.
Draco just figured Potter had felt a sort of obligation to him for cutting him open like a gutted pig.
“But I still want to continue our relationship, Draco. Having a mate really just comes down to being in physical touch with them, it does not need to go and will not go further than that, I swear!” Potter had grabbed Draco’s hand, all but clinging to it, as he pleaded.
It had not been like he and Potter were attempting to completely hide their relationship from the public (Potter had wanted to reveal it when everyone had been celebrating of Voldemort’s defeat), it was just the fact that Draco had known the backlash would not have been worth two seconds of triumph. The idea had only been reaffirmed in his head with his status apparently plunged into the very depths of the ocean. While many people had not dared to be blatant about their hatred of his family, especially with Potter always a convenient distance away more often than not, he had known it was still present.
He closed the distance between Draco and himself quickly, casting basic healing spells that immediately got a happy sigh out of Draco’s mouth. Before he could attempt to walk on his legs, Draco found himself suddenly hefted up in strong arms. He managed to not squawk in his surprise, and instead clung tightly onto Potter, nuzzling into his neck.
He would later find out - by Professor Snape in a bid to shake some reason in his stubborn brain - that she suffered the same consequences as he did, the moment he had blacked out.
“Do you regret it?” Potter had asked him as the sun peaked over the horizon, a lighting thin red strands scattered about in his mop of dark hair.
All he knew was that his mother was alive, but nowhere near close to being as safe as he wished her to be.
Lying on cold tile of the bathroom hadn’t been that bad. His body had felt more like a delicate china doll shattered on the floor, pieces scattered around him, big and small, which would never make a complete version of himself again. Draco’s body soon grew cold and numb to the fiery rage of pain it had held only a minute before. It happened much quicker than he had thought it would. His blood had probably cooled him down further, there was simply that much of it around him, leaking out of his body as easily as a steady river.
Draco had been utterly crushed. Potter had the decency to tell him straight away, but the blow had not been softened in the least.
It had been three months into the year when Draco had taken a breather away from his cloudy future to glance Potter’s way.
All the same, some part of him had been a bit alarmed to find Potter suddenly not beside him, and he had been fighting off the urge to search for Potter in between the towering shelves of books, when Potter returned to their table.
With his arms full of books, Draco had shoved out of his seat, completely prepared to walk away from Potter and his annoying friends for good this time. He had helped them out with the war cause as much as he was able, and he had every intention of continuing to do so, but he felt little need to be in close proximity with them any longer. He turned away from Potter, shoving the chair in with his hip, wincing when it screeched back into its place.
Draco knew that while his mother did not have the will at the time to voice her question, it had still been clearly shown in her eyes. For the very first time, he had not been expected to follow her, and by extension his father's, lead. He had a choice.
It seemed better and easier (safer), to just keep things as they were. Even if it meant being reduced to a seahorse, being moved where the ocean saw fit to place him.
In the end, it had been Pansy who managed to convince him. For one, Draco had been almost embarrassingly relieved that he would not be the only 8th year Slytherin present. Mostly though, he had also realized that his situation could have been worse, and while the school year would have likely not been a stroll in a park (Draco had pictured himself standing at the base of a mountain so tall its peak disappeared in the clouds) he had known he had been taking a step forward.
Potter had the oddest expression on his face. His face had been drained of most of its colour, with his wide green eyes standing out in contrast to his pale face. His chest heaved as if he had been running a marathon, while his face said he was a moment away from fainting.
Still, he had been unexpected, and the Order had little choice but to shove him wherever they had the room. The only people who were willing to take him in, were the last people he had expected and wanted.
When the story came to its climax and finally ended, Draco had known the most comical expression was on his face. With his mouth wide open, eyes near ready to pop right out of his skull, and nostrils flaring.
Draco had simply put his wand away and returned his attention to the book in front of him. Potter, the stupid boy, had actually
Potter had then made a frustrated noise in his corner of the room, before he went on a fully fledged rant about Draco. His voice had gone through different octave ranges as he ran out of breath, only to start anew on another topic somehow related to Draco.
The scream that ripped and clawed its way out of his throat was almost as painful as the spell itself. His voice was entirely alien to his own ears. His body twisted and convulsed as thick, powerful magic coursed eagerly through it. Draco could never recall anything afterwards, much less how long he stayed under.
Draco's hands had been pretty interesting to look at then, as Potter seemed to be at a loss between gaping at him and strangling him.
Hogwarts had taken one year to become reopened to the public. New and present students had been fully encouraged to continue where they had left off, with the seventh year students who had been present and not present even given a chance to re-do the year.
Draco had blinked once. “Excuse me?” he rasped out, brows scowling down in an automatic response to Potter speaking to him.
In the room of hidden things, it had been easy to creep away before he was completely noticed and brace himself against a wall behind one of the many towers of who knew what.
Draco prided himself on seeing things in a realistic perspective. At least, he did so once his rose-covered glasses where ripped off his eyes by the Dark Lord. It took only one face-to-face encounter with those reptilian facial features, with those crimson eyes that been bled off its humanity long ago, with the thick presence of magic weighing him down and almost choking him, for Draco to decide
The next moment he had woken up. He was in a bed with his mother hovering over him, worried lines practically carved into her face.
“I know your situation isn’t the best right now, and you mi-might have some regrets for choosing to help us out in the end. I know Hermione and Ron aren’t really helping matters, but that is to be expected when you keep insulting them and stuff, but at least they are still trying! I mean, bloody hell, what am I trying to say!?” Potter had moved around the table and took a few tentative steps closer to Draco.
Potter had visibly wavered. He had likely expected to be screamed at, accused of cheating, or even strangled by Draco over a somewhat rational question.
Draco had realised then that had to be the moment Potter had first came to realise the difference between him and his mate.
“No, no, uh, I-I mean, uh.” Draco had little trouble in picturing Potter in that moment. One of his square hands would be shoved in his hair, pulling at it in slight frustration at not being able to come up with the right words. His chin would be turned down, his green eyes staring at the floor. His cheeks would be flushed with colour as he nibbled on his lower lip in the hopes of bringing words forth.
Draco recalled his head turning so he could watch Potter better as he had walked to his seat, head bent slightly down. When he took his seat next to him, Draco still had not returned his attention to his studies. Instead he became highly aware that something important had taken place while Potter had been away from their table.
Honestly, Draco had no clue how Potter could have had enough energy to even act so utterly childish, but Draco had become fed up. He would have to help Potter from a distance from now on.
The crunch of Potter’s nose beneath the heel of his foot gave Draco too much satisfaction. Some part of him had wondered if simply being in Voldemort’s presence once was enough to completely corrupt him. All the same, it was another moment in time that Draco could not bring himself to regret. For once, he had felt determination like any other coursing through his veins, nearly making him heady with the high of it.
However, raised to be polite to those who were willing to be nice enough back, Draco thanked them. He kept his thoughts on their house, inside and out, to himself. With Weasel and Weaselette just waiting for an opportunity to hex him, he decided not to give them a reason to. Not to mention it was somewhat amusing to see their reaction to him complimenting their home, thanking Mrs. Weasley for her delicious home cooked meals, and even offering to help clean up afterwards.
Draco remained silent as he watched what seemed like a never-ending stream of Death Eaters invading Hogwarts. He knew it wouldn’t be all that long before the Dark Lord would join his followers.
Potter eyebrows had moved up and down in perfect unison. His green eyes seemed almost washed out entirely as they refused to meet Draco's own at the time.
The memory of the rest of that day was entirely absent from his mind. He had little idea what he did after somehow managing not to be marked, and given the chance to salvage his family from Lord Voldemort’s rage. He could recall only one thought whispered in his head with utter determination; he could not fail.
Draco could hardly believe his eyes. Potter was the only one standing in the clearing, staring blankly at the spot ahead of him. Both he and Draco were covered in sweat, dirt, and blood (from their own bodies and others).
“Terry Boot is my mate.” Potter had quickly continued on, as if he was attempting to erase those words with the ones he had said next. As if he had any real say in the matter.
Normally, he always writes a response at the earliest, awaiting for a later date simply to throw Potter off his scent and to convince him, the mysterious Icarus is currently posting messages from across the channel rather than say, a few feet away from their eighth year tower.
None of his Slytherin classmates are dumb enough to not understand the motives behind his decision, even playing along for sake of unity and blending in with the mindless herd.
Icarus never pushed his opinions or obviously superior wisdom on Harry, instead preferring to highlight the pros and cons of the dilemma until Harry has enough to make an informed decision.
Hopefully, they would end up striking a tentative truce or if not, they might decide to part as tolerant acquaintances.
Speaking of Draco, he habitually stares at the farthest table in the room. The platinum blond appears to be caught up in a private conversation with Zabini, huddled close in their own personal bubble of sorts.
A little opportunity at sparring with him ought to lessen Potter’s stress enough to postpone their eventual confrontation till tomorrow. Draco will let himself be caught unawares by Potter in a sufficiently secure location to hash their differences out verbally.
- Draco couldn’t help averting his gaze in wretchedness that threatens to choke him, at the intensity of emotions this person ivokes in Potter and how some stranger’s opinion is worth more than Draco, himself would ever mean to the unruly-haired Gryffindor.
Zabini, of course isn’t content to have Draco’s full focus on him; evidently, also needs affirmation the blond is physically there, as though Zabini hallucinated his presence and has to place his grubby hands over Draco’s shoulders, like he had propriety to do so.
A tentative correspondence begins, Draco slowly realizing this is nothing more than a way for Potter to therapeutically vent his frustrations to a stranger, with no awkward baggage involved.
Hypothetical scenarios aside, Ron’s unwitting remarks are what forces him to confront the depth of his emotions for the Slytherin. Since (ignoring the uncomfortable truth of those statements), Harry doesn’t really hate the thought of everything else the picture presents – namely, he and Draco together, for better or worse like two sides of the same coin.
He mentions about his crush that turned out to be more serious than originally anticipated. Of the guy in question, possibly being in a relationship with another and how little time he has, to convince the object of his affections of his sincerity.
In fact, every Slytherin has the basic common sense and self-preservation instinct to not make serious fun of the other houses and specifically, the Gryffindors anymore.
The Malfoys are more fortunate than most but that doesn’t mean, they are above the resentment of the common man. Keeping his head down is even more essential now compared during the war time. Since, this time around there is no different sides, while everyone is (possibly) united by the hatred towards their family.
There, finally a goal for Harry to work towards and starting today, he will surely begin chipping against Draco’s ceiling high impenetrable walls.
The truly surprising fact is how soon people are able to forget and move on from the atrocities they personally suffered from, as though, it was all a bad dream and in the distant past unlike a mere few months ago. Make no mistake; Harry is not judging other peoples’ coping methods, purely lamenting the lack of his own.
Instead of focusing on the delicious breakfast spread before him, he keeps spacing out. Not even the newly added comfort foods or the trusted toast and bacon combo could garner his interest, since Harry couldn’t stop thrumming in anticipation for a much awaited letter from his new friend.
Much later, after all the Slytherin classes have been canceled for the day and Harry consulted with the Maurders map, the highly troubling case of the missing Slytherins is solved … to an extent
Actually, as long as he’s listing impossible requests – Harry would also prefer it, if Draco could hold his stubborn eye-contact and cease turning temporarily deaf and blind in his vicinity. Or better still, he could halt freaking cuddling with that jerk Zabini in public places … you know what, if Draco completely avoids socializing with the perfect, tanned specimen, that would be amazing!
Neville coughs, gaining their focus. “Er, maybe it is a contagious magical malady situation, the school doesn’t want us to know about?”
Shockingly, the now seventh years and few other classes have also voiced their support in demanding their seniors retain their positions but the school management,
It felt rather anticlimactic to learn he is diagnosed with PTSD and depression, instead of some new horror looming near the corner. Hermione insisted they approach a mind healer when their nightmares frequency skyrocketed and Harry started to develop anxiety attacks at even the thought of social-interactions.
Old habits and especially, self-defensive mechanisms don’t go down without a tough fight and Draco prefers to have decent supervision nearby, lest he challenges Potter during a last minute panic, of finding his fucking eyelashes of all things, irresistible.
He gets rid of the mist of apprehension much like a wet dog shakes off the water droplets and scrunches his nose, intrigued to hear her theory. Besides, Hermione is almost never wrong in her calculations and logical jumps. Except perhaps where Malfoy is involved and Harry’s gut insists on his culpability regardless of any reasonable deductions hinting otherwise.
– the foolish kid, who gets so caught up in the heady sensations of a liberating moment that he loses all common sense and flies too close to the sun, thereby plummeting to his imminent death.
Except, he was bored out of his mind and began randomly collecting historical artifacts to pass time, which kind of lead to cross-referencing data from old newspaper editions. And before Draco knows it; he has a good pile of information relating to the Potters family, carefully categorized and kept aside.
Not so surprisingly, Lucius Malfoy managed to evade serious charges and life-time imprisonment stint at Azkaban after citing mitigating circumstances to his advantage. He later learned, a combination of empathy for their (then) living situation, a recently discovered need for tolerance (owning to the seriously dwindling magical population) and a major role Mr. Malfoy (or rather his unending, deep pockets) played in keeping the Britain economy afloat, helped the senior Death Eater escape due justice.
Not like Harry outgrew his love for Quidditch, doubts if it that’s even possible - merely that, after what they all went through the last few years (the whole being on run from a mad tyrant hell bent on killing him), he isn’t particularly interested in expanding his energies in sports or winning the House cup, as though everything is normal.
On his eighteenth birthday, he received an extremely thoughtful present, alongside a simple note expressing birthday wishes without a sender’s name, which passed the colossal firewall of security the Ministry and Order of Phoenix members personally installed over Harry’s mail, with flying colors. Satisfied the bulky wrapped package contains no threat to his person, Harry opened it only to be flabbergasted with gratitude.
, Icarus clearly has daddy issues and an emotional baggage which is hard to ignore through his periodic melancholic tirades. But except that,
Draco helps Potter navigate an identity crisis (having been there ages in prior to the brunet), along with answering his fears and doubts when the Gryffindor realizes he plays for both teams. Still, Draco doesn’t dare to dream or entertain any hopes this confirmation brings.
So really, facing Draco Malfoy and confessing his love shouldn’t terrify him as much as it does. Even following Hermione’s advice of befriending and then courting the Slytherin stealthily has its merits. Ron’s unhelpful suggestion of planting one to get the point easily across, felt borderline dubious and is clearly given in jest which ultimately makes the tip useless.
Speaking of naïve idiots, Draco is surprised the chosen one is so forward and willingly to pour his heart out to a virtual stranger, seeking their impartial wisdom on confidential matters, no less.
, Draco was by no means subdued or a mere shell of his former self – actually, he stopped bullying Gryffindors or somewhat ceased to pick on students from their sixth year onwards and never resumed (excluding last year due to unreliable narration).
Only Harry seems to genuinely care and grow frustrated by the minute. He forcibly inhales his frustrations, cataloguing the speculations thrown left, right and center.
Jerking up, he allows his eyes to wander past the fixed position and the resulting vestige is extremely damning. Pairs of mistrustful and angry eyes take turns to glare accusingly at … yup, him. There are several brands of hateful stares he had garnered over the years to differentiate instantly when Harry is unwittingly in middle of a coup and when he’s the target of a vicious propaganda. This though? Obviously falls under the latter category. As to be expected, Hermione’s presumption that he happened to be in some manner mixed up in this mess legit seems to be holding water.
Well, that’s what happened. Although, the order of Phoenix – now legally a special unit of defiance (one of the new departments sanctioned by the Ministry) is keeping an eye out on Malfoy, in case he starts dabbing into his old activities. So far, the Malfoys remained squeaky clean; not that Harry is worried, as Lucius Malfoy had to be especially dense to try anything so stupid with the whole Ministry practically breathing down his neck to make one wrong move.
, Draco drew the obvious conclusions; finally believing Potter’s proclamation regarding his godfather’s eternal love for Lily Potter.
Harry wanted to ditch the remainder of breakfast to investigate but a warning glance from Hermione, stealthily slipped without halting her heated argument stops him in his tracks; guilt and annoyance warring for dominance in his chest.
Draco was digging through Severus’s belongings inherited through his god father’s will – mostly books, potions ingredients and more books, when he comes across certain souvenirs which left no doubt regarding their previous ownership.
She is fumbling with a silver fork in hand, lips pulled tight in a small frown. “Did … um, something happen last night after the Quidditch practice?” The quiet tone and tiny creases around her eyes bring attention to the worry scarcely suppressed within the warm browns.
The Slytherins, fortunately, are not intimidated into skipping their Hogwarts education. Their table while not as crowded as the rest, still houses a decent amount of students. As with the case for every house, the Slytherins too lost few students to the battle and the remaining ones, are less boisterous and exuberant compared to their peers.
Fortunately, Draco is feeling less self-destructive these days and listens to the rational tone, keeps his head down and avoids the burning gaze drilling holes from across the room.
“ –But don’t we deserve to play and participate in the Quidditch championship…after all, this is our last year.” Ron insists, amid huge cheers from their house peers.
Except, certain rumors have surfaced over the years rendering his assumptions of Draco and Parkinson’s status as a couple, debatable at best.
Harry racks his brains thinking if perhaps he did, astoundingly managed to piss of the entire Slytherin house without noticing it. Stranger things have surely happened … so, it’s not totally outside the realm of possibility. Yet, what could he possibly have done to ensure this level of sulking from a house that prides itself for their thick skin?
Maybe he is giving the ferret too much credit or maybe it’s his trusted instincts backing the hypothesis, Harry couldn’t help frowning at the blank space which still somehow manages to mock as though Malfoy charmed the specific area into continuing their tradition despite his absence. He’s well habituated to glaring in this direction, that one spot in particular, to stop now or let a simple inconsistency such as Malfoy ditching breakfast to deter him. A quick glimpse reveals Snape is missing in action too. Can’t be a coincidence – ninety percent of Slytherins and their head of house just don’t choose to randomly skip breakfast on the same day at the same time.
Whoever this person is, lucky enough to have won Harry Potter’s unconditional affections and his friends’ approval, Draco is half-dying with curiosity to learn their name.
He cannot walk away from this precious slice of life, Potter unsuspectingly is offering him; having always dreamt of becoming best friends with the Gryffindor and later, wanting more than he could deserve and will never receive in the form of a romantic relationship.
The Malfoy bottomless coffers, their only saving grace, has been keeping them afloat through this turbulent ride.
But for the love of Merlin, he couldn’t bring himself to stop caring for Potter, no matter how hard he tries.
Quite a few of students have turned to Harry for his support in this matter as well. Incidentally, much to his chagrin, Harry’s word (and opinions too) carry a huge sway with the magical population, and as such, is frequently dragged into settling conflicts whether he liked it or not.
Its likely, Icarus has nursed strong feelings for his friend, only to lose out on his chance by waiting too long to confess.
He turns away, as the familiar burn in his chest inches its way out through a heated glare in their direction. Stabbing his fork harder than required on the lone sausage, Harry grits his teeth, fighting to get his control back before anyone notices his preoccupation with Draco Malfoy, again.
Harry pushes his plate away, terminating his act of picking through his food; nerves and anxiety stealing his appetite long before any worry of rejection ever could.
In all their six years at Hogwarts together, Harry doesn’t remember Draco ever allowing anyone in his personal space, other than Parkinson of course.
Neither of their feelings survived once the constant backdrop of threats, petty obstacles and forbidden drama is removed. Besides, he came to learn recently (after Icarus explicitly answered all his queries in detail) his dating pool is only being half-utilized.
Against all odds, the infamous prickly and malicious Slytherin house managed to befriend or perhaps the right term here is, adopted practically a bulk of Hufflepuffs, in some sort of an ancient tradition passing resiliently down from generations. While, the house of spoilt brats are no less mean to the badgers than to the rest of two houses, they still show up to defend their Hufflepuff friends’ honor without fail. They kind of got a ‘grumpy cat bullying a golden retriever’ in the name of friendship and ‘viciously-attacking-anyone-who-offends-their-pet’ weird relationship going on for them.
Meanwhile in Hogwarts, classes have started and with that participation in social activities and current disappointment that 8
At the end of the day, Icarus has never let Harry down yet and he could only pray the guy doesn’t decide to start, now of all times.
Panic, undoubtedly sets in with the realization this isn’t a normal crush or phase, he would invariably grows out of; emphasized more through frustrating corroboration, Draco doesn’t give a damn about him, anymore.
But he does receive a short letter from them, nothing much in the way of identification – merely, a modest dismissal of Harry’s fervent gratefulness.
“Nah, mate. Whatever is going on is strictly under the wraps. We saw few Hufflepuffs approach the second year snakes but they aren’t budging an inch.” Dean’s swift yet negative reply leaves him reeling with more questions.
Draco seems to have plenty of time for Zabini these days, much more than for Parkinson. Yet strangely, the girl appears to not mind this development, at all.
Now though, clearly witnessing Draco blush and titter while Zabini continues to engage him in a conversation, more like feasting on his ears; Harry couldn’t dismiss the uneasiness flooding his system – the probability of truth to the gossip, Draco Malfoy plays for his home team. The information, in itself, is not terrible news if true; except for how Draco probably isn’t single or at least won’t remain so, for long if circling vultures like Zabini had their way…
Maybe not instant life-long friendship or a heart-to-heart exchange but anything … other than being treated as part of the ancient castle’s Victorian décor.
Despite his false bravado, the tiny, pathetic and hopeful part of Draco that refuses to die no matter how hard he squashes it under his heel like a bug, pipes up questioning - whether he may just have gotten Potter’s intentions wrong?
Potter positioned himself at a good distance from Draco and aimed his wand at the blond. Draco couldn’t simply let him go with that. The first time Potter plucked a flower from his skin he had been caught so off guard that he had no reaction. Now, though, Draco had to find a way to retrieve that
Harry quickly climbed the black marble stairs and turned left to the corridor leading to his dormitory. Entering the room, he threw himself on the second bed on the right, where a four-poster bed had crimson curtains pulled back. It was displaying his messy sheets and some scattered clothes.
“Hey,” Longbottom approached too, making Theo’s lips part slightly in surprise. Draco, however, only got a quick nod of recognition from Longbottom; his eyes were locked on Theo, his face reddening. “Want to do it together?”
since he last had an episode. There was nothing that had triggered him today, he was just absorbed in thoughts. Just that.
“You’ve got a good point there, T.” Blaise concurred. “But I’ve had plenty of time to sort things out. You know what gets my blood running cold?” The other Slytherins stared at him with frowns on their faces, waiting for him to continue. “Isn’t that what we did to the Muggle-borns? Made them pay for the Prosecution when they’ve never even lifted a pitchfork themselves?”
During Defence Against the Dark Arts, while they learned counterspells for more obscure spells and hexes, some people attempted gluing Draco’s shoes to the floor. When he stumbled, Potter caught him without batting an eye. Draco had been aware of him sitting closer to his group, but didn’t think Potter had been paying him any attention while the class was going on. Draco mumbled a “Thanks” to him and they focussed back on the Professor.
Potter’s eyebrows went right up, but he said nothing. Draco blinked several times, then returned his eyes to Potter. A rosy colour was spreading at the back of Theo’s neck and up to his ears. Draco bit his tongue to prevent him from saying anything that would make Theo kick him later.
After the Second Wizarding War, it became normal for Harry’s mind to fixate on small things that had happened over the past year. The colour of Ginny’s hair during Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Ron’s brand new scars, Hermione’s “mudblood” one. How Dobby’s voice sounded when he was happy. The Grey Lady’s somber expression while she told him about her tragic story. Fred’s post-mortem smile.
Harry missed the precious oxygen filling his lungs to the limit, then slowly exhaling. It was pleasurable. Never in his life would he have thought he would be so conscious of breathing. Of the pleasure to-
“Draco…” Pansy seemed on the verge of crying, but Draco couldn’t turn to face her and risk breaking down. “You have to try and fight back.”
think he was, at least. My mum thought so too; she did many essays about his beliefs, so that’s how I know of him.”
Draco was trying to hold back tears, but it seemed too much. He felt desperate and resigned at the same moment. “I am tired of trying… Nothing seems to work, anyway.”
“Oi, careful, lad!” The painting of Merlin said, adjusting his pile of books. They had toppled down when Harry had braced his hands on the portrait to soften the collision. “Is there a Grim at your heels?” he chortled.
Harry reached the eighth year tower in record time, practically faceplanting on the portrait that guarded their new common room.
In another section, Lungwort began to discourse about the blooming flowers that would appear in the cursed wizard’s skin. Positive emotions could make the buds, whichever type of flower they might be, to bloom beautifully. As the Curse did not have a cure, it was advised to maintain the curse-bearer loved, well-cared for and protected. The healthier the state of mind, the longer they’d live.
Draco disentangled himself from the towel – Blaise was trying to dry his hair as well as drown out Draco’s complaints the whole time, the wanker – and wrapped it around his waist. Draco saw the way his friends’ smiles and expressions mingled, their eyes lowering to his chest. Draco looked down, seeing the usual tangle of thorns that trailed over his ribcage and to his chest looking raw.
level of power.” Blaise started to gesticulate with his hands, the motions more a way to emphasise his words than a display of his frustration. Only true friends would know that. “Couldn’t match
Two more faces flashed before his mind’s eye. How young Remus was in his last apparition. Sirius, too. How painfully
“I’m alright. I’m marvellous!” He quickly shoved the book under his armpit, walking backwards to try and escape her. “I am totally fine with you lot. Just go kiss and leave me with my book! Quoting you: ‘this is just
,” she explained to him, “I just happened to overhear Sir Nicholas talking to the Grey Lady near my bathroom. Sir Nicholas was saying how strange it was seeing you and Harry Potter not fighting in the hallways. Oh- and that he missed taking the piss over the Baron about Quidditch since you decided to quit.”
Draco was sweating profusely, and from time to time he would shiver from the cold air against his damp skin.
“Alright,” Myrtle said quietly, with an unsure smile. “At least there’s Potions Master and singing, right?”
“No pureblood did what they dared to do,” Blaise pointed out, but he clearly wasn’t happy about admitting that. “I have my pride, but I can’t deny evidence when it’s right in front of my face: we’ve been misjudging them all along. We are not heightening our powers by marrying purebloods. We’re getting weaker.”
after his encounter with death? Was Harry considering that if he didn’t pay enough attention, he’d miss witnessing a good moment or an opportunity to help someone in need? Or was that a side-effect of the potions he took?
Harry felt hot, fat tears trickling down his cheeks. “Remus…” He sobbed, covering his face with his hands. “Ted-” he hiccupped, doubling over until he was in a foetal position. The book became trapped in between his chest and thighs, but Harry was in no condition to care.
come to the library unless you’re plotting something,” Hermione pointed out, an eyebrow rising while her piercing brown eyes followed his hands’ motions.
he cast at the curtains, and heard a surprised yelp from behind them before everything became silent again. “Do I need to spell your fucking curtains for you too, Boot?” His voice rose to the point where Finnegan’s snores became quiet. “Have you got no shame nor respect for insomniacs in this blasted castle?”
“You’d totally cuddle the shit outta that ‘sinister-looking cat’.” Theo laughed, dodging Draco’s punch at his arm.
Harry remembered, then, his parents. The trembling began to diminish. Harry closed his eyes and pictured his mother. The shape of her face, the exact shade of her hair. How his father’s cheeks dimpled when he smiled. How both of their voices sounded while they tried to calm him… The gentleness in how they reassured Harry about accompanying him until the very end. That everything would be alright now that they were finally reunited.
Harry heard footsteps from outside. Panicking, he did the only thing he knew would help him, more than being found in such a state. He wasn’t in the mood to be coddled. He just needed to let it all out and not have somebody looking scared at the way he expressed his grief.
“That’s what Blaise and I always told you two about,” Theo seethed. “To not do or say anything against Muggle-borns and half-bloods! I can’t even count out the times I had to
Draco and Narcissa had also been obligated to wear silver Admonitors on their left wrists. That way, the Ministry could monitor all their magical activities. Even though she had lent her wand to him, Draco’s mother wasn't useless
As soon as Draco had thrown his clothes over the stall walls, Potter discarded Draco’s pyjamas in the laundry basket. The blond knew that from hearing the swishing of fabric as it floated under the noise of falling water from the shower. He also came to realise that Potter did not want him to see blood and risk another panic attack.
Draco had been shedding different flowers, and since he had the book that mentioned the curse memorised, he knew what each petal meant. That’s how he was working on his feelings. Well, he tried. Draco had only ceased to shed a miscellaneous of decrepit petals – deadly nightshades, geraniums, petunias, and marigolds – when Dumbledore fell off the Astronomy Tower.
All four Slytherins looked up; a strong protection shielded them as if it was a translucent wall. That allowed them a clear view of what had exploded: a dung bomb carried out by a conjured bird that vanished with a
“No need.” Two beats passed before Theodore spoke again. “Sometimes I feel grateful that he crossed Macmillan’s path…” Draco saw the tears coming out and trickling down his friend’s cheeks, the tear-tracks connecting some of the moles he had on his left side, under the eye, and close to his mouth and chin. Draco saw Pansy and Blaise fidget, as lost as he was on how to comfort Theo. “But sometimes I just wish he had never come to the Battle, or never answered You-Know-Who’s call.” They all remained silent while Theo poured his heart out and alleviated some of his burdens. “Father did horrible things and he’ll never have to answer for each and every one of them; instead, I’m the one people are pointing at, whispering about and fucking
one could read from the retelling of the Parkinson’s Trials, along with a photo of Pansy sat in a chair, her wrists, ankles, and neck surrounded by tight silver shackles laced with the Magical Annulment Enchantment. ‘
“Pans! Quit that mentality! I am aware it pains you to hear that, but don’t you think this is just you being immature?” Blaise spoke through his teeth, letting go of her hand. “I’ve been told my whole life they’re lesser than us, and yet no pureblood in this century could match
Because of Snape, the world seemed grey nowadays. And Harry wasn’t just thinking about the weather. Before, he could distinguish between good things and bad things, but now, everything seemed quite… morally grey. When his mind wasn’t going mad with so many thoughts and images, he could look at people. Everyone was touched by war. Smiles were there, but not as wide as they had been in the past. Even though people knew there was nothing wrong in trying to heal, laughing sometimes felt like mocking. Like anybody that dared be happy was insulting the lives lost in the war.
Harry had to close the book to ponder on that. His eyes rose on their own volition until they found Malfoy at the Slytherin table. Even from a distance, Harry could see the greyish colour of his skin. The bruise-like bags under his eyes. How his white-blond hair fell dishevelled on his forehead.
In the afternoon, after spending the morning in the Hospital Wing to stop the bleeding of his tattoo, Draco and his little pack of Slytherins could be found lying on a thin picnic blanket by the lake. Pansy had joined them on their way to the Wing. In the distance, Draco could see the Giant Squid’s tentacles protruding from the dark water, its movement sending tiny waves to the shore. Draco was the only one in a sitting position, looking distantly at the rippling surface.
Blaise nodded. From The Fairview's – the Parkinson’s family mansion – basement, many artefacts containing the Zabini family crest had been confiscated. For that, Adalina Zabini had been incarcerated too, but for possessing dark magical artefacts. That earned Blaise an Admonitor, the loss of the Zabini mansion
“And maybe I’d have had more time to live than I seem to now,” Draco exhaled a long sigh. “I just wanted everything to be normal. To have Dumbledore alive and acting again as Headmaster, even though I still think he was becoming senile. No Basilisk nor Sorcerer's Stone. Cedric would still be alive. No Dark Wizard to follow around and to obey his every bidding.” Draco mused. “Just ordinary school years and none of that bullshit.”
“Shh!” Draco flailed his arms, attempting to put his hands over her mouth and toppling forward, passing right through her. “
That horrendous thought made him tremble. Draco felt the bitter taste of bile rise. He had mere seconds to reach the toilet. He gasped desperately for air.
Draco nodded once, looking quite despondent about his career prospects. He looked at her and could see how Myrtle was searching for the right thing to say to break the heavy atmosphere that fell around them. After some time, she must have found it, as she turned to him, wiggling her eyebrows and talking in a very knowing tone: “You and Harry… friends at last, huh?” She let out a high giggle that echoed throughout the empty bathroom. “So
“Fascinating. And this is for me, I presume?” Potter’s hand raised to his face and plucked something from Draco’s cheek with a smug expression. “This way you’ll get me spoiled rotten, Malfoy, giving me flowers every time I do something. It’s a good incentive to make me do more things for you, though, so there’s no need to stop, mind you.”
Only the bedrooms contained their house colours. In his room, Draco could listen to Finnegan’s soft snores, Finch-Fletchley’s incoherent mumbling and Boot’s... quite telling noises. Creaking noises.

they were in possession of the Cloak. Lungwort believed that the Benedictus Curse would be cured if one acted as the third brother had done. By accepting death as a friend, not a foe.
It took a long time, but none of them broke the silence. It seemed all of them were holding their breaths collectively. The Giant Squid floated around, squirting water out in the air. It enjoyed splashing students if they were too close to where it was swimming. Fortunately, it wasn’t swimming close to the bay, for which Draco was immensely grateful.
“I can call any of your friends, if you want,” Potter prompted, to which Draco hummed in agreement. Then, only the pitter-patter of the warm shower water filled his ears. He was left alone.
It took him a bit, but soon enough only the sharp points of the thorns stayed above his skin. Thankfully, they were too thin to do any damage when they were like that. He adjusted his tie and got back to draining his mug.
Draco leaned closer and they shared a long, mind blowing kiss in the middle of the street, not giving a damn if someone would look at them with disapproval.
seemed to have something going on. Something beyond just an ordinary friendship. Harry was almost certain about it, and for some reason it made him feel kind of distressed.
"No", Harry surprised both Draco and himself by saying, holding the other man's gaze in his own. "This time
The next day went by slowly. Harry was unpleasantly aware of the fact that Malfoy must’ve heard about his yesterday's snooping.
"Why?" Theo managed to ask before Draco, looking at his boyfriend with a questioning look on his face.
Harry didn't know what to think. "You treat him badly because he cares about you…? That doesn't make any sense to me."
"You really did", Draco said in a cold tone. Though he was relieved that Harry hadn't been cheating on him, he was still feeling bitter having been treated like that, having been taken for granted for weeks. "Do you have any idea how many nights I cried myself to sleep because of you?"
He had learned that the Slytherin hadn't had an easy childhood. Lucius had been a very strict father and had raised his son in quite a twisted way, and in the end Draco had been forced to get the dark mark and do terrible things that he’d never wanted to do. Harry couldn't forget the way his former enemy had been shaking and even crying in front of the whole court, so afraid that he would be sent straight to Azkaban. Harry had started to feel bad for Malfoy and he was happy to have been able to help him get rid of the charges with his statements. Then, a few days after the trial, he had received a very short letter from his former enemy:
"No", Harry replied, shaking his head. He pressed a quick kiss to the other man's lips before saying: "Merry Christmas, Draco."
"I love you too", Harry whispered back, before they melted into another stupendous, loving kiss. Harry's fingers were wrapped tightly around the Slytherin's waist, pulling him as close as he could, and the other man's hands were tangled in his messy hair, caressing the back of his head. There was a swarm of butterflies in Harry's stomach once again.
From the corner of his eye Harry saw Malfoy walking in without asking for a permission. The next thing he knew, the Slytherin was already strutting around their room, looking all high and mighty, scanning it with his eyes.
Everything really was different now that Voldemort was finally gone. Hogwarts had been rebuilt and they were back for their extra and final year, 8th grade, trying to finish their studies. Not all of them had returned so there were much fewer of them. Harry, Hermione and Ron had skipped the whole last year, so they were back, of course.
"Nothing's wrong, baby", Harry said quietly, gently caressing his hand with his fingers. "Just tired, need to sleep."
His eyes turned to Theodore who was still standing at the same spot. Their eyes met and Theodore opened his mouth to speak, but before he got a word out of his mouth Harry had already attacked the man. He wasn't going to listen another word from Theodore or see another satisfied smile.
“You came, Draco!” Moaning Myrtle said sweetly to him, gliding closer to Draco with her translucent arms open. Draco did the same, and a shiver ran up his spine with the strange sensation he feels while ‘hugging’ her – as if he had plunged into ice-cold water. “I thought you had forgotten about me.”
Potter said, motioning at his own chest. Potter began to fill his lungs slowly, breathing in deeply until he couldn’t bear any more. Draco scrunched up his face in confusion, trying to mimic. Distantly, Draco could make out the gasping wheeze of his own breathing. It was horrible; he sounded completely out of air.
after all was explained. Harry had testified on behalf of Draco and his mother, but some things could not be forgotten. Lucius Malfoy had done enough to disgrace his family’s name to affect his son.
Harry reopened the book, then searched the pocket in his trousers. Harry carefully raised the leaves he had picked up off the Potions room floor. They were quite wrinkled, and some of them were too dry and ended up crumbling inside his pocket. Harry chose the most intact leaf and put it into a red square on the first page of the floriography glossary.
Slughorn began talking at the front, preventing Hermione and Ron from prodding him further. He silently thanked Slughorn for the momentary peace. Harry understood their concern, but really, it’s been
He saw Blaise Zabini, a guy notoriously serious, enchanting the spoons at the table to march to Draco’s plate to prank him. The spoons were trying to steal whatever Malfoy was eating. Right at that moment, Harry saw how Malfoy battled against them by using his fork as a ‘sword’.
Every time Draco remembered his Papi’s or his Grand-père’s deaths – and the look on his father’s face as he took Draco away from Dominus’ mangled body –, a chill never failed to run down his spine. Plus, the feeling of being observed only intensified in those moments.
“Bloody spectacular,” the brunette said sarcastically, mimicking Draco’s position. “It didn’t change anything.” Theo faced the sky, chewing on the inside of his own cheek. “I still see him die over and over and over,” Theo told them in a monotone, looking even more exhausted. “Keep thinking I should’ve done something drastic. Hexed him and
Draco opened his eyes the following morning, immediately realising there was not enough air in his lungs.
Pansy was wearing a long lilac dress with a transparent long-sleeved shirt on top. She was barefoot now, her pair of brogues placed neatly close to the edge of the blanket, along with Draco’s, Blaise’s and Theo’s stylish ankle boots. She was sprawled on top of Blaise, who was lazily caressing her short hair. Blaise was wearing a tight turtleneck and black trousers, while Theo decided on all-white attire – a turtleneck knit top and fashionably-ripped jeans. Draco chose to wear the Slytherin jumper which gave him a sense of comfort paired with tight black jeans; notMuggle though. Despite not vilifying them anymore, Draco was still not there yet – wearing Muggle attire, that is; and Theo too, apparently, but Draco thought it was more for the sake of keeping up appearances.
Soon they were, once again, rubbing against each other, this time with no pants on, simply skin on skin. Malfoy was on top, holding and moving their cocks together with his hand and they were both moaning loudly.
"Yes", Harry answered as confidently as he could, but in reality he was already feeling stressed just thinking about it. "Right after I've left Ginny."
"Ginny's been missing you, you know", Ron suddenly said, breaking the silence. "She's been pretty upset for not hearing anything about you."
Harry was just staring at the other man for a short while until he smashed his mouth against the Slytherin's again and rolled on top of him, kissing him roughly. Was he dreaming again? Malfoy had touched his scar and told him he wanted him... Why the hell did Draco Malfoy want him, Harry Potter, in his bed, of all people? It didn't make any sense to him at the moment – but it didn't matter. Merlin, hearing stuff like that felt so good, so arousing.
"It won't. I mean it, Draco", Harry continued. "As if few old pictures would change my mind. I've already made my decision."
Ron looked glad that at least Harry seemed to believe him. "Well... there was some bed creaking... I also heard some moaning", he said quietly, cheeks reddening. "Then it stopped and I heard Theodore talk."
"Maybe", Theodore said quietly. "Well, in case anyone sees him, I need to talk to him." He left the common room with his head bowed down, heading towards the bedrooms.
They took a very long, relaxing shower together, once again being all over each other: first only washing, then kissing, then groping, and finally masturbating each other under the running hot water.
"You disgust me, Harry! We are SO over!" Ginny snapped and slapped him hard in the face before storming away just like Draco, only in the opposite direction.
"What are you doing here?" Malfoy finally asked instead of answering to Harry's question. Harry noticed that Malfoy sounded very tense, so he slowly pulled his hand away from the other man's shoulder.
Draco had started to pay attention to the fact how Harry's work days as an Auror were slowly becoming longer and longer. Sometimes he would inform him that he would be late, but sometimes not.
It didn't take long before they had changed the position so that Harry was now lying on his back, facing Draco, and their pace was already harder as well. The Slytherin kept pounding into Harry madly by now, the stormy grey eyes boring deep into his own emerald ones, and Harry held onto him tightly, his fingernails sinking deep into the flesh of the other man's back.
Harry lifted his gaze, noticing that Draco was looking at him. His lips curved to another sly smile.
Harry nodded. "Yeah. Only if you want to, of course", he said, babbling. "The place is still a bit disorganized and dusty since I haven't been home a lot and it's
did not kiss her! She was the one who initiated it! When she kissed me in the Great Hall I was shocked, and then I saw you looking at us and wanted to clear things up with her instantly. So I led her to that corridor to tell her that it was over between us, for good." He glanced again at Draco who was still listening to him without one word to him. "I told her that I can't be with her anymore, because I want to be with someone else. She got pissed, told me that
It was almost like another dream. The Slytherin was clutching hard onto Harry's back, his long legs wrapped around his waist, moaning somewhere in between intense pleasure and pain.
Harry lowered his gaze and continued eating though he was feeling kind of sick, not to mention tired.
"I understand", Narcissa said softly. "Your father can be, um... very merciless and... even scary. However, I'm going to go see him as soon as I get out. So if you'd like, I can take care of it for you."
It was already clear to Harry that he and Ginny had never been meant to be together for the rest of their lives. He obviously still cared about Ginny a lot... but only as a friend. He had only been doing what everyone expected of him. He still wished to get married some day, but Ginny wouldn't be the other party.
Later that day Harry cooked another dinner for them. Once again Draco ate everything till the last crumb and Harry smiled by himself. It seemed that he wasn't so bad of a cook at all, after all, since his food was good enough for Draco Malfoy of all people. Well, he had been forced to cook a lot for Dursley's and do all kinds of other housework, so that explained something.
They both gasped as Harry slowly pushed inside, and Draco closed his eyes. Good lord how he had missed this.
He didn't sleep well that night. He kept on tossing and turning, trying to think of Ginny, but instead all he could think about was Malfoy and all the conversations of that day. He hadn't seen the blond after they had separated at the lake, but he knew that sooner or later Malfoy must have gone to sleep in his room. The room that he shared with Theodore.
"Hey, Potter", he suddenly heard the Slytherin speak again after a while of silence between them. "I was thinking…" he paused, clearly hesitating. Harry turned to look at him questioningly. "Would you like to do something tomorrow… like… go flying?"
As they were walking along the hospital corridor, Harry was deep in his thoughts. He had wished to become a father someday because he hadn't had a proper family himself as a child, but he had already accepted the fact that he wouldn't be able to have that with Draco. He had been ready to give up his dream because of Draco, but now that he had heard there actually were possibilities to have children between same sex couples...
No, he hadn't imagined it, Harry was positive about it now. Malfoy was now biting his lower lip and at the same time his eyes were clearly and very shamelessly lingering on Harry's lips… before he lifted his gaze back again, giving Harry an insecure, tentative look. That was when Harry knew that there was no going back now, not this time. This time it was going to happen. Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, was going to kiss his ex-nemesis Draco Malfoy, the man he had been dreaming of for
Even after Ron and Hermione had already gone to sleep, Harry was still there in the common room, still lying on the same couch. He kept staring at the flames of the fireplace, deep in his thoughts. He could clearly picture Malfoy sitting at the pub, sipping his drink, looking at Theodore with his beautiful eyes, smiling… It made Harry's insides hurt.
"I can't believe that we're going back to Hogwarts tomorrow", Draco said while getting up from the bed.
Yeah… Draco Malfoy was always on his mind and today had only made it much, much worse. Just thinking about the blond Slytherin, how he had finally gotten so close to the man and almost kissed him made his stomach flutter. He had wanted to hold the man, he had wanted to touch him so, so bad, and he still did… and Malfoy had wanted it too, he was pretty sure of it after their night at the pub. Malfoy had whispered that he might leave his door open for Harry. Blimey, he still couldn't believe it. Malfoy wanted him, Harry Potter, to go to his room at night and…
Would he be able to sort things out with Ginny this time? Was it even worth it anymore? To tell the truth, he didn't know if their relationship was going to work after all that had happened. Before the war it had all been so different with Ginny: lots of laughing together, lots of snuggling and kissing… It had felt so right. Whereas now… he wasn't so sure anymore. He wasn't sure
Draco didn't have to be told twice. He rolled onto his back, spreading his legs, ready for Harry. Harry always preferred positions where they were facing each other because he wanted to look into Draco's eyes while being inside him.
"You think so?" Harry asked, his lips curving up. Blimey, was Draco already waiting for another round?
Ron sighed too. "No reason to apologize to me. I'm not angry at you, Harry. I know she's not the easiest girl to be around with... But if you leave her, do it quickly and please do it
After they were finally ready and shower fresh they went downstairs to have some breakfast and then finally to the living room, to open their Christmas presents.
Another silence fell over and Harry got up, stretching a bit. From the corner of his eye he saw Malfoy also getting up, grab his schoolcase and the book he had been reading, heading towards the corridor leading to their rooms without another word to him. Harry followed him soon after.
"I am not taking his side", Blaise hurried to say. "I'm just trying to come up with another reasonable explanation to all this... It may not be so black and white!"
"I could stay here, you know", she said casually. Harry shifted, turning to look at his girlfriend. There was a suggestive expression on her beautiful face. "Would you like that, Harry?"
Greg didn't answer anything to Theo yet and Draco found himself just crying against his friend's shoulder, his whole body shaking, wetting Greg's shirt with tears. Greg's hands were gently, comfortingly caressing and tapping his back as Draco sobbed uncontrollably against him.
Yeah, he really couldn't stop thinking about him. He had nearly been able to kiss the Slytherin for the very first time, they had been so close to each other and Malfoy had seemed to be yearning for the kiss too. The look in the Slytherin's grey eyes had been so eager, so full of craving... Harry still couldn't believe it, it was just like a dream come true and then, of course, Hermione had interrupted them. Just at the moment when Harry had been mere millimeters away from kissing the Slytherin... and now...
"Just as I thought", the Slytherin said, letting out a tired yawn. "You think I'm an idiot, do you? I've seen you eye fucking me for
Harry did as he was told, undressing both of Malfoy's pants as fast as he could with his trembling hands. He was desperate to finally see and especially feel all of Malfoy. It was the Slytherin's turn to moan as Harry freed and immediately grabbed his hard member as well, eagerly starting to move his fingers on it. Harry loved the feeling of it in his hand. Malfoy's cock was bigger than in his dreams, nearly as big as his.
"Thanks", Harry answered, already walking towards the door. He was so relieved to finally get to explain everything to Draco.
"I'm not", Harry said. "I'm really, really sorry, Ginny. I don't know how or when it happened, but it did and... I've fallen in love with him."
"You're not fooling me", she said with a sigh. "I don't know if you've noticed but I've been keeping an eye on you and… even if I hadn't… uh… What I mean is, it's pretty clear to me… Especially after I talked with Ginny today…"
He went to lie down again, surprising the Slytherin by wrapping his arm around him and pulling him against his chest. Malfoy didn't seem to mind, although he still had a little cranky expression on his pale face. Harry moved his free hand to Malfoy's hair, caressing the soft platinum locks gently with his fingers.
"Me too", Malfoy said, closing his eyes with a yawn. A wisp of his platinum hair was hanging on his forehead. Harry found himself staring at him. Malfoy's current posture, his eyes closed and his head thrown back... it reminded Harry of his last night's dream. The way he'd been sucking on that neck of his... holding him tight on his lap while... His cheeks started to heat up and he quickly looked away when Malfoy opened his mouth to speak again.
Harry sighed. "It wouldn't have helped anyway", he said. "Let's talk about something else. I don't want to think about those nightmares anymore."
Ron looked a little uneasy. "Yeah, I know...", he said back just as quietly. "I didn't expect her to come either."
Goyle didn't answer. Before the door closed after him, he could see the sceptical look on Goyle's face.
He quickly glanced backwards when he heard Ron burst out laughing again. It was just enough for him to catch Malfoy's eyes looking straight to his direction. Harry quickly turned around again with a tingly feeling in his stomach and a confused little smile on his lips. Taking a swig of his beer again he gathered himself as well as he could, soon strolling back to their table.
"Well, it's become quite obvious to us that she still very much wants to carry on with you", Ron continued before taking another quick sip of his coffee. "So what do you think about
"But some people have also said that I have my mother's benevolence," Harry said, still in the ground. "And her eyes. They were the same green as mine."
Harry, feeling very nervous, did as he was told. He slowly sat on the edge of the bed first and took off his glasses, leaving them on Malfoy's nightstand before finally lying down. He rolled himself next to the Slytherin who was lying on his side again. There was another awkward silence between them.
"Ron, stop it", Hermione laughed, but Harry felt as if someone had just stabbed him. Was Ron on the right track? And why did he even care about that at all?
