Draco froze in the door of the kitchens, then quickly stepped beyond them, pulling her onto the dark stone steps. "Hermione, what has he said? What has he told you about what happened?"
"It is not known how," Remus said gravely. "It is true that some of Voldemort's followers, such as Bellatrix Lestrange, let alone Voldemort himself, are well-versed enough in arcane magic to have discovered the potion independently and made the connection- stop
Draco was never going shopping here by himself again. If only he could have brought Hermione. She would have told that shopgirl exactly what she thought of her, and somehow did it in a way that wouldn't end in Aurors coming to arrest them.

"Be honest. If you didn't know me and you read this article, what would you think of me?"
"Because he wishes it was him," Hermione explained, "And he needs someone to blame-"
If Grindelwald wanted to know who Draco really was... well, Draco would have to figure that out himself first, before he could give any kind of real answer to the second-darkest wizard that ever lived. So far, he liked said wizard better than the first-darkest, though if he kept on being so annoyingly perceptive, that could change.
to say the least, as well as from every other house and year. Draco told himself it was a blessing that everyone correctly assumed the curse came from the Malfoy that Finnigan had just told the school was gay. No one could prove anything, though, so there were no formal repercussions. The school
He expected more kisses then, but-
It felt like winning the Quidditch Cup had in fifth year, felt the same as handing Severus the trophy for it. Even as Severus regarded him more balefully each time he punched the air and crowed in victory. "Yes, yes, yes-"
"But what we heard... Mrs. Weasley said she thought that Dumbledore's been waiting for me to see something like this, that he seemed worried about me. And Moody said everyone knows there's something funny about me... and that it means something that I saw the vision from inside the snake- maybe Voldemort was
, to see suffering and find it unbearable. It means you feel strong connections to other people. Do you understand what I mean?" Draco nodded shakily. "You can't go back and stop what happened to the Longbottoms. All you can do is try to keep something that terrible from happening to anyone else."
Severus's. And yet somehow, Severus was expected to help make the transformation easier for hypocrite Lupin.
They were alone. There was no one there but them, and they didn't see or hear Draco coming in. They were both on their feet in a room Draco had never seen, only a single lantern on the floor casting high shadows up towards the cavernous obsidian ceiling. It was a completely plain room, same for huge tall squared forms that looked not be alive, though who could be sure, indistinguishable but for slight gilded glints off their sides in the dark. Draco could breathe again, even as the wand in his hand pulsed so hard it was nearly painful. They were there, they both looked unhurt, and as they so often did these days, they were arguing.
Remus seemed to sense an awkwardness in the air where Sirius hadn't. "Let me," Remus said. "Get dressed, Gilderoy, and then
Ron was telling the three professors about the raids his father had been conducting on Malfoy Manor. Not that Draco had almost ever noticed, up in his room reading with all kinds of silencing charms. He just stared off into space and tried to calculate how badly he'd just fucked up.
The weeks that followed would have been very lonely if Dobby hadn't arrived at Hogwarts when he had. Draco's old self in the blue loop would have been horrified to see him spending nights in a cold corridor, in the Slytherin labyrinth charmed bright and warm, trying to teach a house elf to play wizard's chess. But efforts to be friendlier with his Slytherin yearmates were accomplished on little more than a surface level. He was sure to be seen with them in public, especially at meals, but nothing else came of it. Dobby always seemed happy to see him, not missing their match every weeknight, while Draco went flying on weekends, but his presence only seemed to put a damper on other Slytherin second-years. The brief spirit of cohesion animating them when they carried Draco from the Quidditch pitch had gone up in smoke, leaving even Pansy cold as ice to him behind closed doors, all for one distinct reason:
"People are
"Purgatory?" Draco echoed reflexively, and was dismayed at what he saw of the man who surely must be Grindelwald, with that canny reaction, and the distant resemblance to the oldest pictures Draco had seen of the man. He tossed his braid behind his back, and Grindelwald's eyes followed the motion like a cat following a new toy, starved of stimulation. "You wouldn't say hell?"
Draco was panting after his successful play to block the Snitch rather than catch it. He still had a vague idea where the Snitch was, with one eye on the haze of gold near the sun where he thought it had flitted off to, and another on the chastened, circling form below him of Summerby. He couldn't afford to focus on the match below, not even when Hufflepuff got two back, as their Beaters took out Pansy and then Theo near the goalhoops and pounced on the turnovers. "New plan!" Millie yelled, after another turnover almost went in. Hufflepuff stands reverberated with excitement, at their probably illusive hope of a comeback, though they groaned when Millie made a fingertip save, snatching it right off the hoop before it went in. "Astoria, Arco Iris!"
"Holy fucking shit," Fred breathed, and then a rather windswept-looking Hermione had sprung up from the pile of golden baubles that had fallen on her, and ran over to him.
"Don't, Theo," Blaise said warily. "It's like he's got a demon inside him. Trust me, you don't want to set him off."
They all fell to chattering then, Draco teasing Luna mercilessly, until finally Hermione noticed a quiet Potter staring off broodingly into nowhere. "Oh, cheer up, Harry!" she said sadly.
. But until that time, it makes more sense to exhaust the resource of the
There was no moat, but with the place itself an island, there was water to protect them. Draco had the time to take a bit of a stroll around the walls and then the castle itself, feeling permitted by Sirius's gratitude to inspect the ancestral holdings. The sun rose higher above them, and made more of the ancient ivy curling around the jagged stone obvious, its green sheen almost swamplike in places. The stone itself was not faded nearly as light a gray as one would have thought, as if there was some magic in it, and also perhaps because a great deal of the stone, unusually, seemed to be obsidian.
"You don't even like us," Vince said sulkily. "Theo's the only one you really talk to. And that's just cause you think he's fit."
"Exactly," Luna beamed, and carefully put both vials aside in her bag. No one could identify them, but they had lots more presents to open. Draco got the twins a book that was much-needed in his opinion, a guide to opening a fiscally stable business, though they booed upon opening it. Hermione's mystery book was a thick illustrated tome called
Draco's confidence in his Slytherin ruthlessness was tested just the next morning, when he looked over and saw Ron and Harry arrive in the Great Hall. It was not the striking dark figure Harry cast to test his resolve, but Ron's pale, queasy one, visibly nauseous from anxiety across the hall. Draco was reaching into his pocket to get a Draught of Peace for Ron before he remembered that Ron was the enemy. It wasn't like he had any badges or songs targeting Ron this time, but he knew from years spent of flying together how Ron's nerves worked on their own, with no need for outside stimulae to begin sabotaging him. Even more years had his instincts telling him to feel bad for Ron, to try and offer him help, rather than take it as the advantage it was.
"No!" he exclaimed. "Liar! Left hand!" He tapped Harry's left hand, and Harry blinked.
"That's okay," Draco lied. "I'm not cold at all. Luna, I just wanted..." He didn't know how to approach this, with an air about her so remote and alien it chilled Draco worse than the wind. "I don't mean to be all overprotective cousin man, but you weren't at any meals, and Dobby said..."
a proper goodbye."
Draco regretted even explaining to Hermione what Occlumency was. The last thing he needed right now was to think of that subject, and be reminded
From Hermione's face as she went to join them in the Gryffindor stands, it seemed Harry had successfully made her think he'd dosed Ron. She still seemed disapproving even after they explained it, seeming to feel it a bit wrong even relying on what she called 'the placebo effect'.
He had the self-defeating satisfaction of not having gratified Potter by witnessing his victory, not that Potter would have noticed his absence. He thought he had dodged the Chosen One's piss-poor attempts at conversation, until the same night of the match. He was in bed, alternating between playing aimlessly with Imoogi and staring aimlessly at his notes on McGonagall's diagram, when Blaise's voice sounded from outside his cocoon. "Draco, if you're in there and you're not dead, you have a visitor. If a Gryffindor counts as one."
Draco took his chance, raising his wand. "Sectum-"
"Azkaban is awful! Would not recommend!" Draco called out helpfully, before a glare from Ron and Potter made him shut his mouth.
"Oh, yes, you
would mind, that boy-crazy bint. "Theo, do you know if mistletoe works on ghosts?"
"Oh, entering Grimmauld? I didn't even think that counted," Draco babbled, "And I mean, what is the line that demarcates what is and is not blood magic, anyway? It's so arbitrary. We're all mammals with blood pumping through our veins, so every spell is technically blood magic..."
magic," Draco finished, and Theo's faint anxiety gave way to arch exasperation.
So Draco indulged him, abandoning himself to whatever Potter wanted, his personal penance for the flying he'd barred Potter from. He regretted everything when he woke up that long-dreaded morning, and found himself panicking about what to wear. He knew Potter knew full well it wasn't a date, and would be horrified at any suggestion it was such. But Draco's some stupid part of his brain wasn't getting that, and had him as anxious as Neville before a Potions final. When Blaise attempted to tease Draco about trying on outfit after outfit, Draco brandished the talon wand at him until he shut his mouth.
The sound of the false name seemed to bring Dantanian back to reality. "You- you've verified, um, what you... wanted to verify," he said feebly, then stood. He looked like he wanted to rub his head, where he'd hit it on purpose like a house elf. "So... that's it."
"Oh, no, Frankenstein, is it that bad?" Hermione wailed. "It can't be! Let me see!"
"I could give you both detention right here and now," Dorian crowed. "So much detention."
"Someone at the Burrow you want to impress?"
"You cared about him," Luna marveled. "Didn't you?"
construction Draco could put on Theo's motives to try and break inside.
"I have it, my lord."
Pansy, Pansy Parkinson! She's our Princess Parkinson!
"Oh, no.
"Ah, your namesake. I have seen the observatory-"
Not that Draco stuck around to watch. His footsteps took him away very quickly, and not from fear of being late to the start of the match. It was a fury that had him picking up pace until he was practically sprinting once he was far enough out of earshot from them. He pocketed the cloak and ran, ran towards the Slytherin dressing room, towards all the emerald green and silver. Real silver sounded like something he would love to press into Remus's skin at the moment. To say nothing of what he would do to the talon brand on Sirius's hand. And Harry...
"Mother!" Draco cried out, and saw a talon-shaped burn had appeared in bright burgundy-red over her delicate white palm. When he picked up his wand from the pavement, though, he found it as cool as ever. He hastily pocketed it, like concealing a bloodied weapon, though this was more like a newly-applied brand. "Did my wand do that to you?" Mother nodded, wincing, and Draco turned to stare at Ollivander at the door pleadingly. "What's going on, sir?"
Potter stepped off, raising his hands and backing away, but not very far, and followed right at Draco's side as Draco started down the next flight of stairs.
Draco was glad to be the convalescing one, and give Ron a good solid whack over the head with a pillow for his stupidity, with Ron unable to retaliate. And he didn't seem to want to. When they finished chess, he and Luna sat on Draco's bed together playing a three-way game of the Weasley twins' personal variation of Exploding Snap that was, well, heavy on the explosions. It decimated the nice bedcovers Severus had gotten for Draco, but Luna magicked them back perfect after.
"Draco, you can't kill him," said Hermione, as he stared down at the body of Theo. "It's not right." The face of the ill-carved statue of Salazar Slytherin stared down at her, wishing her dead along with the helpless pureblood beneath her.
"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. "So me, Harry an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practise now- that's it- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh- so, be careful- let's go."

"Um, okay, probably not three
"No, I don't mean how you
"You would not be taking anything away from Harry," agreed Remus. "He has the Potter fortune and name, while you have- forgive me, but- practically speaking, you have relinquished your claim to the Malfoy-"
He put down the letter from Sirius with a groan, only to pocket it when he heard the others coming into the dorm. The sight of a certain sandy blond head, deep in conversation with Vince about Quidditch, made Draco call out impulsively, "Theo! Theo, you're afraid of me, aren't you?"
to slay a dragon.
"Millie," Ginny pleaded at the same time, "Please don't go," and a shudder went through Millie's solid frame, her gaze darting helplessly between the two claims on her.
of a dark lord. He could comfort Hermione in one sense, telling her Black wouldn't actually curse or hurt Potter, but he'd have to somehow make her believe him.
they kept him alive for," Aberforth put in dryly. "
Draco let the ice fall with enough speed into the bowl that some of it shattered, and he applied a careful slight Reducto to break it into rough cubes. "There, up the Irish."
"Please!" Karkaroff exclaimed suddenly, worn down to the point where his ego yielded. "Please, Draco, let me stay here. Let me stay at Citadelle Xaphan, where I'll be safe from- from your
Ron frowned, turning it in his hand. "What is it?"
"I want you to," Draco blurted, "I want you to adopt me," and then clamped a hand over his mouth, wanting to sink into the floor and disappear. What if this had all been a performance, just a token offer they hadn't thought he'd take? They were going to be horrified to hear him actually say yes-
"What? What do you mean?"
, Wormtail, I swear it, he's alive," Black babbled. Draco almost thought him guilty, then, for how bad a job he was doing. He was falling apart, in a way just an angry old friend should never have made him, falling to pieces like Lupin's righteous fury was about to convince Black himself that he was guilty. "I didn't kill Peter, he staged it, he was the Secret Keeper, we changed it, thought no one would think- he's still alive, he's been hiding as a rat, Remus, it's why I broke out, to find him..."
"A week," Draco said instantly, though he'd planned for longer. "I can't go any shorter than that without defeating the purpose of the gesture." He wanted to say far more, to encourage Millie about her practicing, but it was hard to sound sincere with his curse dripping from her hands.
Maybe he really was mad. It had to be madness, pure and simple, to keep Harry here on his bed, offering himself, no matter how much Draco threw out to try and push him away.
"The Heir of Slytherin," said McGonagall, who was very white, "Left another message. Right underneath the first one. 'Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.'"
than you. If you don't get her something, who else will?" Draco remembered Hermione's neglected twelfth birthday, in much the same situation, and gave her a self-deprecating smile. Luna's thirteenth would not meet the same fate, it seemed, albeit thanks to Hermione.
His fingers passed through, and this young, resolute-faced Severus, who bled insecurity and desperation from every sour pore, poked at the trunk regardless. And the trunk opened for him, the Whomping Willow letting him inside as easily as if its nickname was Weeping instead.
Then finally, the next speedy song came on, imploring all of the 'fellas' to
That hint of disdain hardened Crouch that last bit to action. "I won't have the Dark Mark in my classroom. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" he barked, and tossed it in the air. Draco sprang for it, hoping this meant the end of this farcical scene, only for Crouch to yell, "REDUCTO!" Draco had to jump back from the explosion in the air, and what fell into his hands after was only fine turquoise-colored dust.
"I mean," Draco said, stretching back across the grass with a yawn, "He made a choice, you know? He had the choice of his pride and his revenge, or of
"Show me, then," Harry said challengingly. Draco surged up, straining enough to nearly pull something in his back, and dragged Harry's face back down to his just using his teeth, clamping on to Harry's mouth and not letting it go, the suction a wet pop as it ended. Then Draco licked up into Harry's mouth more slowly, whole mouth swollen and wet now, so sensitive and raw it needed to constantly be touched to be bearable.
Remus lifted his wand, though, and the painting and the flag re-hung themselves. Then the tree righted itself, and the ornaments came back together, unbreaking and going right back into place.
Draco couldn't have done anything in the world that would have made him look guiltier. But it didn't matter. He still found himself running.
Krum stared down at his bloodied hands, brooding and troubled. "Is the headmaster safe coming back to this place, then?"
to my attention."
Draco understood why Luna had been so eager to claim the right to call Remus her uncle.
He made the rope around Phineas gag him too finally. Then both the moonstones on the ground and the charm on his pendant glowed, blue and silver.

Charlie didn't get the chance to answer. "Everything
"To ask you how you died," said Potter.
The rest of the Defense class about Unforgivables was an exercise in breath control, and pretending his eyes could see past the blur of suppressed watering. The minute it was over, Draco jerked his head towards the door, where his classmates all followed him together. Draco led them around the corner and cast a Muffliato, then looked each one of them in the eye and hissed, "No one talks!"
"WHAT?" Ron and Potter bellowed together, earning a disapproving look from Hermione, in between anxiously shoveling chocolate frogs as quickly into her mouth as fast as they would go.
"I am," Draco blurted, "I mean, I'm not, I'm not ready, I don't want to be around the Fiendfyre," and Severus stared at him with a level of surprise unusual on his long sallow face. Draco felt like the worst kind of coward, maybe even disappointing his godfather, but he trusted Severus to judge whether or not the diary was destroyed. And besides, just the flicker of the flames in that moment across Severus's usually familiar face was making him look like a demon, a moment away from his head turning to a dragon or snake or chimera's.
"Are..." Neville breathed, seeming to lose any memory of what their conversation had previously been about. "Are you planning to go to the wedding too, Luna? Are you asking if... if you want you and I to go together? Like a date-"
Sirius opened the box, and the room filled with gasps. Draco hoped that was not for the subpar quality of the ring's craftsmanship. If nothing else, the moonstone from the dagger was beautiful, almost as beautiful as the unconditional devotion in Sirius's eyes. The moonstone of the snowdrop glowed in the dim light, brighter than any of the lights on the tree behind Sirius, the smallest but most brilliant spark of promise.
But he stepped closer to let Draco encircle his fingers over that place on his neck, thumb beside his Adam's Apple with two fingers landing on the pulse point. Draco resisted the urge to poke playfully at that sensitive place, just to see what would happen, and felt Harry's heartbeat. It was a discernible vibration against his fingertips, a soft rhythm that seemed to increase further at the proximity.
"You said we'd talk later," Harry said weakly, and climbed onto the foot of the bed when Draco did nothing to stop him. Draco watched him climb up with a terrible clogging of heat, a swimming conviction that he'd made a mistake giving away his wand. That was what made him feel strong, strong enough to protect himself from the things he wanted.
mirror.
"I think that's more Harry and Ron, they're the ones in her house," Draco hedged.
And Draco found himself still thinking like this, organizing the world around lies to protect Father's secrets. Ron's words had stung, but they were true if Father had still done this. He'd sent a monster after the Muggleborns at Hogwarts, when he knew what Hermione meant to Draco. Maybe this time, he'd even done so partially to target her...
Harry was giving Draco's hand another reverent kiss when Hermione cleared her throat near them. "If you're quite done terrorizing the leader of the wizarding world, there's someone Professor Flitwick wants you to meet."
him?" Potter shrugged weakly. "Potter, we're
None of the mental maps had faded with either an intervening year or the impossible snap backwards into his old body. He could have made his way through the many meandering labyrinthine paths between the dorms and the Potions area in pitch darkness. He did in all but that, dimming his Lumos to the minimum and letting the pathways be lit mostly by the pretty midnight blue glow of the lake, swimming over the walls sometimes from outside, or just the light of memory, his footsteps charmed silent. He tried to focus on the water's glow and not the aura of prolonged pain that felt like it was starting to envelop all around his body like a snare.
Draco pulled himself away from the common room, retreating to his bed as quickly as he could, trying to ignore the smell in his nose like the Room of Requirement burning. Better they follow someone else, and in one fell swoop keep Vince alive to grow to a ripe old age of idiot. Because Vince wasn't anyone important in the scheme of things. He could have lived or died in that room and it wouldn't have made any difference to the outcome of the war, and if the past was changeable, this was the simplest thing in the world to alter. Let Vince live by keeping him away from the boy who had led him to his death.
"A boy," Draco said bluntly, unsure if it was a lie. "And damn what my parents think."
"Yes, but not the Ministry," Draco drawled. Really, this woman was going to be Hogwarts headmaster, for a time. Didn't she know the Hogwarts motto,
"Exactly. If you doubt it, well, that's just showing the incredibly limited nature of your Gryffindor intellect."
"They were found near the library," said McGonagall. "I don't suppose any of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them..." She was holding up a small, circular mirror, and if there was one thing Draco hated in this world or any other, it was mirrors.
"Draco," Granger said, "You had better not be thinking of doing any flying without Madam Hooch's supervision. She quite clearly said-"
When he approached the pitch, there was no sign of enterprising students soaring through the night sky, nor any rattling of Quaffles banging about against hoops or gloves. He feared for a moment that they were simply absent, and that he should have done even a modicum of investigation before tromping all the way out here at this ungodly hour. But then he got close enough to see that the Weasley and companion on show had done as Draco and his Weasley had used to do so many times, and were sitting together on the pitch talking instead of practicing. Ginny's red hair shone out distinctly in the night, with the larger shadow of Millie close beside, reclined back in a pose of surprising naturalness, hands braced behind herself as they both stared up at the night sky.
"No," he said churlishly.
"Theo," Draco whispered frantically, "Theo, you've always been my favorite. If you ever used to be my friend, you will take out that noble wand and cast an Unforgivable on that dwarf," but it was too late. The poor bugger had already burst into song.
He winked as he said dragon. Presumably in reference to Draco's role with the tragically-named Norbert, as if Father wasn't right there watching. Or maybe that was Hagrid's idea of subtlety, and if Father hadn't been around, Hagrid would have shouted,
"Ah, yes, but have you
Draco sprung back as one nearly hit him, with a jarring explosion of honking soon following from not just the one that had almost caught him, but spreading around several nearby. Draco stepped back onto the walkway gingerly, heart pounding at breakneck pace- to think of surviving Voldemort and Azkaban and being killed by a
Ron had come around to believing Potter's version of events, it seemed. It wouldn't be hard, with how ostentatiously Father had looked at Girl Weasley's books, taking and putting them back. Even starting a fight, with what had to be the intention of making it possible in the chaos. Draco wouldn't doubt it in Ron's shoes. Sometimes Father had the subtlety of a Hippogriff in mating season.
It was surely a sight that Lockhart had never thought he would be graced with again: the man he loved. He sank down on the bed again, as if it was that or falling to the floor with his weakened limbs. There was much of the same fixedness that moony stare had used to have on Draco's godfather. But it was the intensity, now, of someone who had climbed out of hell and seen the first real proof he was back among the living again.
Potter wasn't dead, but you wouldn't have known it from the chaos that erupted on that patch of grass, in the midst of the wailings and lamentations of those who genuinely seemed to believe Potter was fallen for good.
"Talk to me, Dante," he whined. He'd started to talk like this as if Dantanian was a person visibly present, just refusing to speak out of spite. The crazy one in that situation would not be the one talking, it would be the silent one, knowing they were seen and yet pretending not to hear. "I know you've helped me. Probably more than I know. Don't you want to brag about it? There's probably times I would have died without you. Or I can talk about how pretty you were. How pretty you
No matter how much you wanted to touch something, it was hard not to hesitate at it, if you thought touching it would wreck it. Draco could empathize with that feeling.
Your behavior surrounding your aunt's wand, along with the untrained and unsupervised practice of dark magic before your departure for Hogwarts, was utterly unacceptable for a Malfoy. Your behavior at Hogwarts has passed beyond unacceptable to shameful upon our name.
He dreaded Defense, remembering how Severus had once read aloud Harry's press clippings about the supposed romantic drama with Hermione, when he found him reading them during class in the blue loop. But Severus made no acknowledgment, and if he was a little harsher on Harry than usual, well, he was always harsh on Harry Potter.
cousin.
It was not a question of possibility, but will, as its burning hovered into being above it, all of its screams and blasts of light silenced, every broken stone erased by a falling shadow. A shadow with vast sweeping wings that erased the ruins where Hagrid's hut and steps to the Great Hall had once been. The shadow had a head so bright, it made the shadow shimmer, like lakelight on the walls of dungeons that might burn with the rest of this place that was once the center of the world.
Immediately, Draco's chest filled with unbelievable confidence, his face breaking into an ear-splitting grin to match Luna's. What had he been worrying about? He was going to be fine, and was surely going to get everything he wanted, when it felt this much like the sun shining into the shed was shining purely for them. "Luna," Draco said, "I have a very good feeling about this."
Draco was grateful from that wording that Wormtail hadn't elected to try and use Draco instead, but maybe the willing part would have been too much of a stretch. It seemed too much for Wormtail, too, as only fear seemed to be moving this least Gryffindor of them all. Draco could not believe Neville had felt himself unworthy of that name, compared to this cringing, half-human creature, who sliced off his own hand at the wrist with an agonized cry, not out of courage but of rank cowardice, for what awaited him should he not complete the mutilation.
Draco made a face when he saw it was Potter.
"Oh," he said, tilting his head with a slow, analytical stare. "That's what you deny? Not the Killing curse? Is it... is it true you were trying to kill the Dark Lord?"
The boys behind Dorian broke out into derisive laughter. "Why are you even talking to him, Dorian?" one of the dark-haired ones cackled, and Dorian's curiosity turned at once to showy contempt.
please
Grindelwald looked thoughtful. "I don't mean to be greedy, but since you'll be out and about in the world, perhaps you could bring us some... choicer comestibles."
and his hand. He painted them thicker and higher until the circle was a true seal, and Harry only a dim figure behind the heart-of-winter blue. Draco had never felt such raw magic course through him, and yet it did not seem to be draining him. It felt completely under his control, like the entire world was under his judgment.
"What's this tooth in between the stones?" Potter asked, and Blaise Zabini looked like Christmas had come again in February.
Draco leaned forward, only more interested given the frantic pitch of Gilderoy's denial. "Research like I asked you? Anything about the Deathly Hallows? You have been keeping an eye out for that, right? And I'd like you to look too, anything about Dantanian Noir-"
"Forget my bloodline-" Draco supposed if all would go well, it would soon count as
None of it dislodged the fragments of nightmare from his mind, so he went up and cast Alohomora, letting himself into Sirius and Remus's bedroom. He had never been inside before, and found it more small and simple than he would have expected, with Remus's favored hard wood floors and navy walls, dominated by a paintings of ocean landscapes and a large photograph of the two with James and Lily Potter. They were in the large bed with its thick blue velvet covers, snugly cuddled asleep.
Scrimgeour's face had gradually gone paler and paler, until he did rather look like a vampire. "Well. It has been a pleasure meeting you both. Perhaps we will speak again, Harry, at another time, when you are not..." He seemed to struggle to find a euphemism for
you!" he snarled, sitting down hard in his chair, before leaning forward to regard Draco with uncertainty still. "Think, Padfoot, think," he said, seemingly to himself. "This isn't a disaster. No, this is an opportunity... but he can use Bella's
spent the summer together without him, while he was just trapped with that awful aunt and uncle of his..."
"Oh, Draco," said Remus, voice choking up. "Draco, I know it's 'normal' to purebloods. Sirius's parents disciplined him in a similar way. He said that if it ever came up, he would prefer for me to tell you, rather than talk about it himself. He is still... reticent to discuss it, with anyone, even me. But he wanted you to know- if you had that experience, that he had shared it, so he knows enough to understand it some. And he agrees with me that the way it's done is vicious and excessive. It's not just child discipline. The use of heavy objects like a stick for beating- the use of dark magic to punish
"Were you really trying to snog Potter?" Theo asked dourly.
That wasn't enough to put the jury out one way or another, though, whether the Seeker was worthy to take Hermione. He would have to keep a close watch on the older boy to make his judgment, and if he proved unworthy, Draco had all sorts of creative ways in mind to ensure he kept his paws off Draco's best friend. If that indelibly altered the blue loop, well, so be it.
"Oh, they don't, and I told them not to try, just- it doesn't matter," Hermione hissed, looking as if it mattered a great deal, and when she slammed
On Mother, he had only seen that look in her eyes when the Dark Lord spoke her name.
"You touched a sleeping child in his bed?" Gilderoy gasped, appalled.
Dobby didn't respond. Draco suddenly realized Dobby was no better-prepared, for this piece of wintry hell, than the addition of an adorable puffy down coat and snow boots, both patterned in turquoise-pink paisley that bore the unmistakable mark of Luna. "Focillo," Draco cast, "Focillo, Focillo," and Dobby seemed grateful, but still shivered. With a shudder, Draco took off the medallion he'd bought in Munich's wizarding street market, a tight spiral of thermal amber and garnet that promised 'a hearth within the heart' in winter. It belonged around Dobby's neck.
"Draco, please, please," Luna kept pleading, and finally, Draco took a deep breath, turned around, and forced a smile.
Draco shrugged. "Well, we do have better hair."
"I would tell you anything," Draco blurted, tears threatening to come despite the warning, if not of panic yet. Almost worse than embarrassing respiratory problems would have been, though, was the awareness that he might be
"Professor Trelawney," Draco said earnestly, "I need your help with something. Please. I know you're always saying how weak the Sight is in me. And you're such an incredible seer, Professor, please, I thought of you right away. If you would just do one thing for me, I'd owe you such a favor. I really would..."
Severus did not tell him that was wrong. But he did put the painting aside, and, of all things, put a thin arm around Draco's shoulders, more weary than angry. "You are taking too many lives, Draco. You have taken too many already. No, Karkaroff will not be held against you either. Another death in combat. But this blood on your hands- it is too much. Not for the sake of the world, my boy, but for you. You should not have to carry the weight of so many dead on your shoulders." He squeezed the shoulders, as if to demonstrate how heavily the weight must press. Draco stared down at his hands, feeling like Severus had just cast Verniculpa on them.
The squash to get all seven of them inside was incredible, but Draco still made sure he was the closest to the receiver. He could have been sick, staring at the Muggle telephone receiver and remembering Harry trying and failing to get him to call him on one over the summer, but he dialed 62442 the same, and the same monotone female voice he remembered from entering for Harry and Sirius's trials rang out. "Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business."
"A hell-puddle," Karkaroff breathed, looking so traumatized he was regretting ever learning the English language.
"And would you consider yourself to have been a close friend of the Potters?"
"Surely," Severus said coolly, "You must see that is impossible, given the circumstances."
"The Sorting Hat said I didn't have the courage," Draco said honestly, and Sirius scoffed.
Potter looked twice as worried as before Draco had answered the question. Draco grabbed him by the tie and hauled him down beside him. Potter let out an indignant squawking noise, arms flailing, so Draco just pulled the tie fully untucked, and tightened his grasp on it until Potter was breathless, staring over with pupils visibly dilating, slow dark orbs expanding in wide lake-green eyes.
"So the Stone's gone?" said Ron finally. "Flamel's just going to die?"
"Not that I wouldn't love that," Dantanian sighed, grabbing at his stomach to hold back more rounds of laughter, "Being called
"Luna," Draco said firmly, tying off her braid. "Look at me. What you are, I am. Whatever it is, we're the same. The exact same. If you're an imposter, I am. But if you're real, then I'm real. You can't have one without the other, we're a set. A pair. Like a mirror. You're my mirror, Luna, and I'm yours. Not the Mirror of Erised. So what should
me?" He put a wobble in his voice, and cast his glance down, to seem childishly hurt rather than vindictive with his words.
"Luna!" Draco shouted, pulling her hands off her face. "Don't you dare. Don't you dare say you're sullied or ruined, you're
Flame appeared between them, a sharp forked blue shine of the burning tongue hissing and hissing like its dead lungs could choke on their own smoke. Smoke was rising everywhere, up from the corpse, from the end of his wand towards it where they were bound by it, the black inky thick evil smoke of the talon wand. But it was cut through everywhere by the moonstone-bright scintillation of the Mirror of Espilce, finally tearing open the scales from beneath and letting up great smoking flickering bursts and pillars of fatal light.
Draco's stomach turned, guilty not to be happy. If he had done badly, he would have been furious. Was he determined to be unhappy no matter what happened?
revolting prospect.
"Your grandmother was right," the mother said fiercely. "You're special. Look, just like the flames in the lanterns... you are a prodigy already, Dantanian. You will be
could be the spy," Black said weakly, and it sounded like a lie even if it probably wasn't. "I'm the one who told James not to tell you. I was an idiot, I know that, and you know that too, I've always been such an idiot- you used to call me the village idiot- you know I would have gotten a Troll on my Potions OWL without you-"
"Let me out," Potter hissed frantically. "While I'm still Nott, before I turn back..."
"NO!"
Draco was left to reflect on the incidental cruelty of that choice of Hermione's, Petrificus Totalus over Stupefy. It would be leaving Periander fully aware and helpless but to wait, as he had to watch Luna give priority to the conjured snakes first. One doubted he would be in superlative spirits once they let him speak again.
plan. And in his defense, it wasn't like he was the only one with nefarious plans surrounding that damned party.
less after all that. That I would have, I don't know, finally
Draco hadn't expected Mr. Granger to accept the letter. Thankfully, he didn't get past peering down, trying to work out how to pronounce Wizengamot, before an eagle-eyed Hermione snatched it away, saving her father. "He wouldn't understand it!" she hissed furiously in his ear. "And even if he did, he still thinks of you as this- this
! You knew something about me- my wand-
The knocker did not disappoint, as the melodic voice asked its riddle for the night. Draco did not think he had to have a persecution complex, to think it might be intimating its opinion on the artist formerly known as Draco Malfoy. "Why is an evil man like a worn-out shoe?"
Even after agreeing, Harry kept giving Draco a wide berth around Grimmauld. It served Hermione well, at least, as she had declared it irresponsible at best to allow this miracle with the Longbottoms to pass without making an earnest attempt to understand it. And so, for the first time in her life, Hermione went through the Black library, along with Draco's growing personal collection, and began to wholeheartedly research dark magic.
"I would have already driven you round the bend," Draco said confidently, forcing himself to look Harry in the eye. Even though Harry taking his hand had brought them very, very close, between rows of battered bookshelves, cracked golden baubles still crunching underfoot. "You'd be begging
"Severus!" Draco exclaimed. "You... you made this for her?"
Potter turned scarlet red when he saw Draco had heard, and Ron just nudged Potter and laughed, "We know, mate. We know."
Hermione looked guiltless. "Well, I had to," she said in a practical tone, "They might not have let me go over and stay at the Manor unsupervised if I hadn't, we are both twelve now, and you are a boy. And they wouldn't have wanted us alone in my room here. They're quite protective, you know. But I told them you only like boys, and they're fine with that, Draco."
get some benefit out of it, other than a place for
giving you-"
"JORDAN!"
Finally, Sirius rose to give a speech of his own, and Draco and Luna both tensed, thinking it might be it then and there. But it turned out to just be a toast of his own to the Order of the Phoenix, calling all the students there honorary members- much to the clear fuming of Mrs. Weasley- and pledging his support as a member of the Order to the Longbottoms, with whatever they needed to get back to their warrior selves. Alice smiled so widely it looked like it hurt, when Sirius spoke the word
. He claimed he didn't know which it had been. But he said he knew it hadn't been
"I ate earlier," Luna said, pulling her knees up tight to her chest, and rested her chin on them to stare out the lake. Her very long hair at least gave her some form of wind shield. She pulled Draco's cloak all about her as another shield, though with how long she could have been sitting out here, he didn't know how much it would help. "Don't worry, Draco. I've just been thinking."
But I fear my mind is not all it used to be, though I hope the sea air will improve it. Speaking of Severus, I was pleased to learn he will be my liaison to Dumbledore at Hogwarts, and to you, to whom I made the Vow. This proximity, I hope, will also allow me to fulfill the last part of the Vow to the fullest. I do believe Severus has kept that part to himself. I will follow his example.
"He didn't do anything, it's not his fault," Draco tried.
"Not a bad answer," Seguinus coached him on, the world's kindest Socratic dialogue between monster and future victim. "But a Muggle one, Gilt. Not a magical one. Did you know that Dante Alighieri was a wizard, and knew of this place when he wrote his Commedia Divina?"
would have been open to discussion, at least as a
? What would be done with the talon wand? Who would get it? What if it was Voldemort who managed to claim it, and in saving Severus, Draco damned the entire world? Then was Draco meant to destroy the wand, raze the last remnants of Dantanian from the earth before he too was erased?
"Eventually, I knew I had to hide it instead, somewhere it would never be found."
Longbottom, apparently, to judge by the faint moan he let out, before clutching onto Potter's sleeve. Draco felt his own unflappability as a distinct contrast, but that was one advantage he hadn't considered of his unique situation. It was easy to seem brave when you already knew everything that was going to happen, and that it would turn out fine if you just followed the script. "It's just the Forbidden Forest, Longbottom," Draco said, with a languid eye-roll he knew would infuriate Filch. "They wouldn't have first-years in there if it was actually life-threatening, whatever he says. And the Forest is rather overrated, anyway. I guarantee that in ten minutes, I could find a half-dozen things more dangerous in Malfoy Manor than the Forest could ever produce, without even having to go
He had no idea what nonsense he was spouting, perhaps being caught by the ears of disgruntled Hufflepuffs filing out, but it made Potter stare at him and turn red, so he didn't stop. He grinned and turned the Snitch in his hand, pressing a kiss to the side of the glittering bird, and couldn't help showboating however much he knew Potter hated it- short-term vs. longterm results, he knew, he tried to remember, but Potter's attention was too addictive.
"If you had any idea," Dantanian countered, "Of the things I mean to do."
"You," Draco hissed at Potter, with every ounce of venom he had ever accumulated towards Potter over the years, "You pathetic, weak-willed do-gooder, you deserve to get burned alive!"
Thankfully, Harry's attention had been caught by their bizarre human protection spell, and he didn't even seemed to have noticed the Snitch had showed itself that one fleeting moment. When Draco looked back, it was gone. So much for using his memory to catch it. If he wanted to beat Harry to it, he would have to do it fair and square.
with you?" Potter gasped.
"Because the results were not worth the cost. Nor would they have been, even if I did upset the entire order and passing of the world."
Draco wasn't sure if he cast wordlessly too, or it was the talon wand itself, throwing up ashield just before the Stunner hit. He cried out in shock, spell striking his shield hard enough to make him stagger back. Luna seized his arm, light eyes huge and fearful.
"Thank you," Hermione said, "But you shouldn't have worried, Draco, you know you blow everyone in our year, everyone in the
you didn't just want the Marauder's Map to help him sneak off with some bloke. What we can't figure out is why you've left us out and won't let us
"What are you talking about? Draco, I can't figure this out myself. You have to do it too."
Draco defended his table at the library like Nagini defending Voldemort, a long narrow chestnut table near the Defense section which even students in upper years learned over time was Draco's. He would stand there still and glowering long enough for anyone who had wandered there by mistake to get the message and leave it to him, and level the same stare at anyone fool enough to try and sit down with him.
"460," he read, voice louder with each one, "461," until he pronounced the three numbers he had come for. "462." The door looked a painting-like cerulean blue, from the flames behind. "Neil Palmer. With my luck, he's dead."
Sirius and Remus have told me much of what I missed in captivity- I do not consider Xaphan captivity- and I have been told you were the impetus behind this reprieve from the start. Second chances are a rare thing, especially to those who have not deserved them. And I know I did not deserve this chance. I will always be in your debt for it.
glad it wasn't, like, a goat or something," Draco said weakly, and went over and offered Harry a hand up. The first sign all was not well was Harry ignoring his hand and getting up on his own.
Instead of trying to walk through, the Death Eaters were soon trying curses and counter-curses, flashing every color of light. The flames repelled it, the air around them simmering with the haze from their brilliance. The dark ceiling above reflected every curse like an eruption of Weasley fireworks. The room itself had become an ice fortress of simmering blue. It was all silver-ice, like Draco's room at Grimmauld, the flames were so high and soaring. When the fireworks went off, it was like New Year's Eve again. He even had Harry by his side.
"I was waiting for you outside Severus's chambers," Luna said, "Even though it's late, because I wanted to ask you about something. But you walked out looking very purposeful and mysterious, so I followed you."
He wasn't sure whether that was by chance, or whether they'd gotten the message Draco was back and cleared out. Maybe to avoid him, maybe to give him space, but either way, Draco was guiltily grateful for the chance to pack up alone. Ravenclaw had been good to
Granger had clearly learned everything she knew about romance in books, and probably Muggle ones at that. "Merlin, Granger, the ideas you get in that head. Don't worry, you couldn't be safer with me, I promise. There is no chance of that ever, ever being an issue between us. I could never fancy
much to you, Draco... if you hold tryouts again, I'll show up and stay this time. I'm not likely to get on the team anyway, I was really more there to see the show. And to watch Pansy fly about in Quidditch robes."
He had expected that group, but he had also invited all the witnesses for the defense from the trial, even Millie and Pansy. Mrs. Weasley had okayed that move, knowing they owed them, though she looked uncomfortable about it. Draco had just told her they would never show up anyway. But to his astonished excitement, they appeared together by their own custom Portkey, looking around as warily as if they expected a chorus of Stupefy to greet their arrival. He was familiar with that feeling of being deep behind the lines in enemy territory, and unable to understand why you had not yet been cast out from their midst. He directed them to the tent with all the refreshments, including the alcoholic ones, and joined them in sneaking some mixed drinks when the dozing bartender had his back turned.
It was a creative construction by any account for Harry to think
The next morning, Severus informed him that, at the cost of Severus's fireplace, the liquid Fiendfyre had finally proved a success, and decimated every trace of the diary for good.
that, right?" Harry breathed. "Fred, George, you shouldn't have done that, though, his hand- and you don't know how long it will last-"
"Harry's opinion doesn't count," he muttered, but wouldn't explain what he meant.
"We know that book," Draco said with a sigh. "We're using it ourselves."
"Alohomora," he said softly, and then louder with an impatient wave of his hand, though his 11-year-old voice sounded ridiculously high and thin.
Draco snorted before Hermione shot him a sharp glance. Draco had been the one bullying other students in the blue line, and even if he hadn't been a Malfoy, the thought of other students trying to bully him? It was pretty hilarious, when the people around him had grown increasingly reluctant to talk about him for fear of their tongues being mutilated. "Uh, no."
It had not been charitable of Draco to blame the unwanted invitations on Mother, using the fact that the invitations were hers as his cover-up. But upon Father's reminder that part of their deal had been not to invite any non-Slytherins to the Manor this year, he'd been backed into a corner. And Father couldn't drag Mother into the dungeons to castigate for it, so it turned out for the best in the end. Probably. Unless you counted the way Mother looked at him afterwards.
It was later the same night, much later, when they were all back at Grimmauld sobered up, that Draco caught his truest glimpse of what freedom meant to Sirius. Gone to stare aimlessly at the Black tapestry, as he did too often, he found Sirius already there, wistfully tracing beside his own blackened name.
"Yes," Lupin interrupted to calm them, "Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it."
"I suppose," Severus intoned from above, "I should be pleased to find you trying to explode a wall, and not
Their staring was punctured by the moment and its terrible context, the reality of the situation of Hogwarts, which Luna began to quickly unfold to him. That was, once the spectacle at their feet was attended to. He got the wand and mirror and dagger out of the way, putting them in his robe pockets first, as if hiding some severed body part from view. Then- "Incendio!" he snapped, and set the bloodied robes alight, turning them and the empty vial quickly to even more of a muddied puddle of black ash. He could feel rather than see Luna flinch at his side, but she didn't say a word as he destroyed the evidence.
"Is this a break-up monologue? Because before you bring this analysis to its natural close, at least consider two relevant pieces of information. One, I don't
"Theo, you'll never accept any apology, nor should you, but at least you should know the truth. Here is an account of the events that unfolded the night of June 21- a pity you ended this one here. Such an account would have been educational for myself as well."
"I'm always helpless," Draco breathed, letting Harry's fingers go with a wet pop. "When it comes to you. You know I'll do whatever you say, don't you?"
getting obsessed with the Deathly Hallows, aren't you?"
"I don't drink," Harry said, who seemed to think it far more festive to sit there alone doing nothing in the dark. "Shouldn't you be out there celebrating with Charlie Weasley?"
"Ooh, did he?" said Luna happily. "Scandalous!"
, though," Dantanian said ferociously. "Don't I." He undid his braid, leaving it a mass of curls around his face, wet and dark as the smoke of Dementors dying. "DON'T I?"
"The results of your assistance." Draco flashed a rakish grin. "Grindelwald."
"And you tried to protect her," Severus observed. "You little fool. Do you not think it vital to know who successfully attacked your little friends? Who is capable of breaching House Black defenses? When the Order's headquarters, where
Draco practically bit through his lip to stop himself crying out again, when they came up to a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. He had hated every step down the tunnel, but now that they had reached its end, he almost wished it could have gone on forever. And Potter had stopped before it, turning to look at Draco, but the words that came out of his mouth were borderline incomprehensible. "Draco, do you remember when you caught the Snitch against Ravenclaw?"
Harry seemed to hate the reminder of his own vulnerability. "You don't think you all could have done that better from here? No, I guess there's only room for one new
from my... talented son." His once-handsome, unshaven face had the strained, shattered quality of Bellatrix's. "You could have joined us. You could have been great. You could have, for your
And he even managed to last a week before telling Hermione about Sirius Black.
The accuracy of her metaphor, literally not a metaphor but a descriptor, made the cold pervade deeper, beneath furs that seemed to have been wildly overpriced. "I care about some things. I cared about the Kingsnakes. I
"Oh, little dragon, you
"Yes, that's what she said," Draco said eagerly, only to pull back as he reached the hard part. "And she said... um... listen, sir, I know you aren't going to like this, and you showed me that memory for a reason, I really do know that, and I don't want to ever, ever do anything that would make you think I'm your enemy-"
up," Harry muttered, "Promise," and Draco couldn't help it. It was stupid, but he handed his wand over to Harry with an indulgent smirk.
"Severus," Draco interrupted, frowning. "Didn't you tell me that the decision was mine? That if Harry was what I truly... that you wouldn't stand in my way?"
thing. "Draco, you can't!"
that! It's everything!" Hermione shrieked, tears falling freely now. Draco had taken her shaking hands and she didn't even seem to feel it. "You trashed the entire Slytherin dressing room after you lost to Harry, and wouldn't speak to him for weeks, and you flirt with Theo Nott all the time even though you don't fancy him, you fancy Harry and we both know it, and just- nothing you do makes any sense! And Luna is worried about you too. She heard Neville talking to his parents. Apparently, he said you offered to let him use the Reductor curse on your wand, just vaporize it, even though you knew it could make you a Squib. What
And there it was, four hundred and seventy-two points. Earlier than the last time, with the twenty points Draco had lost Slytherin helping with that bloody dragon taking Slytherin down this time to only four hundred and fifty-two. He could feel the stares on him aware of him as the root of their loss, though he could have told them it wouldn't have mattered. Any admonitions directed towards Draco, though, were swallowed up by the seismic roar that burst out, not just from Gryffindor but the other two. Would Dumbledore even bother to give that cursory ten final points to Longbottom? Draco had always suspected those had just been token points to dramatically finish with giving Gryffindor the prize.
been overselling his own abilities, hadn't he?
"Who do you think knows more about being possessed by the Dark Lord," Draco drawled. "Him, or
"When did you come back into contact with Mr. Periander?" Hermione asked. Karkaroff's eyes flickered, slow from the drug, a voice being pulled through sludge like boots in knee-deep snow.
"Serpensmorta!" he screamed, with exactly the intricate winding and slashing motion she had once spent three days teaching him to perfection.
"If you keep spying for Dumbledore, you
"Sure," Hermione said, "And if I win, I'll expect twenty-seven from each of you."
"You have completed four years of Hogwarts. In how many of those years have you been officially named as top of your year?"
"And there's the best Defense professor we ever had," Cho went on, "Good old kind Professor Lupin, throwing away his job and his pride for some swaggering murderer-"
"Come off it," Draco snorted. "That's a weak point to try and score off me and you know it. You could have gleaned that I've had
"Dantanian Noir?"
Remus looked back at Sirius, and even if Sirius was to lose, at least Draco had given Sirius this moment. Sirius had once said he could die happy as long as Remus believed in him. And there was no ever questioning it ever again, as Remus raised his chin before the whole court, and said, "Yes. Since the day I met him, Sirius has been my entire life."
"Bombarda!" Despite the unhoned percussive force of the spell, his control was enough so that the shape it blasted in age-old stone was something like a window, albeit a circular one.
He had to wait until the next morning to be filled in, with June dawning bright outside but uncertain within the walls of Hogwarts, the shadow of more than just Harry's dream coming over them now. He knew something was awry when Hermione took him aside to tell him the whole story instead of Harry. He felt like being sick when she narrated Harry's dream about Wormtail and Voldemort, which she had copied down an account of in writing much like he would have. It was nothing new, but it confirmed that the same plan as the blue loop must be in play, unless Draco's magic prevented it. It also confirmed how foolish he had been not to kill Wormtail when he had the chance, though Hermione did not seem overly fond of listening to him express that opinion.
Draco saw his guardians off, and then set at his appointed task. After whining and threatening some form of celebration dinner out of Kreacher, who took the news of Harry's adoption like Great-Aunt Walburga dying all over again, Draco found himself at the tapestry, tracing
The tapestry did not burn, but Draco proved to have been exaggerating in his boasts to it anyway. There was a steep learning curve to the blasted thing, and Hermione, heretofore perhaps the most unathletic friend he had ever had, proved better with it than him. Even if she couldn't hit it with her head like the players did, the way Ian Wright scored a goal days later, called a 'header', to beat the local rival Tottenham in a match called the North London derby.
Draco put Harry off until next Monday, saying he needed to prepare for the dueling lessons, which really meant he needed all the time he could muster to work on his secret potions. Harry agreed, looking happier than Draco had seen him since he survived the Norwegian Ridgeback. Maybe the boy just really enjoyed putting himself in danger. Got off on it, even.
"Scared, Potter?" Draco eyed him up and down. As consummately unhappy as Harry had looked, his green eyes sparked gorgeously at that taunt.
Umbridge took one last shot, give her that, though if she'd had any sense, she'd have been trying to get him off the stand as quick as she could. Bad enough she'd already been laughed off half the way to the Fountain of Magical Brethren. "Can you deny, though, Mr. Malfoy, that you have at your young age earned the reputation of a very dark wizard?"
"Draco Lucius Malfoy," Voldemort said coldly. "It is time. Take out your wand and raise it."
Either Potter didn't know what incendiary meant, or he still didn't take Draco seriously. "The trees are beautiful, aren't they?" he said with a smile, and called "Happy Christmas Eve" again, before giving Draco a little nod and scurrying towards the doors. He executed this maneuver with a carelessness showing disturbingly little fear Draco might hex him in the back.
." Potter had to blink rapidly to absorb that information. "And her name is taken from a very beautiful Korean legend, about a dragon who was born disguised as a girl until her 18th birthday- hey! Stop laughing!"
"It's your Hogwarts letter, Draco," she said excitedly, sounding more carefree than he had ever thought he would hear her again.
"Don't be sad, Cousin." Draco's legs felt almost unused to his weight. He was told he'd grown thinner over nearly a month on his back, like a coma without the mental vacation to recommend it. "You'll be free to have all the fun you want with Neville without me to worry about. Really, you'll be better off without me."
Skeeter's eyes pleaded with him, not seeming to dare to think of going for her wand. "Oh, no," Draco said, with ostentatiously facetious sympathy, sadism foremost in his voice. "Is that not better? Not what you would have preferred? Alright. Finite incantatem." Skeeter fell forward, gasping and clutching at her mouth and chin as he released the curse. "You aren't writing the article on Hagrid. Any questions?" Skeeter shook his head wide-eyed. "Pleasure doing business with you.
Slowly, with shaking hands, Draco carefully ripped open the letter. He remembered tearing it so hard the first time he nearly tore the letter as well. It was intact this time, but the words were no different.
says it," Hermione said, though her voice was weak. "Remus didn't want Draco even to do it. And Remus knows what he's talking about more than anyone-"
When the Assessor warned Draco about the intoxication of fully unleashing his magic, he'd obviously meant it about consequences outside mere exhaustion. But the exhaustion itself, in the days between the Cup and the return to Hogwarts, was enough to make the warning more than apropos. Draco slept through lunch, and found himself unmotivated to drag himself out of bed for supper, even when Mother came to his room personally to take him downstairs. Whatever she saw in her felled son, broken skin prominently on display without even the energy in him to roll over, it made her give permission for him to eat his meal upstairs, summoning elves to bring him food.
"Why not?"
"I think he might have forgiven a little deviation on your part," Draco said as facetiously as he could, but his heart wasn't in it.
what you find interesting about this... situation?" He gave Harry a heavier look through his eyelashes, spreading his legs. Harry's eyes snapped between them, finding Draco aroused and dripping. His hand brushed the inside of Draco's thighs. "Do you want to touch me there?"
"But I know something you don't know!"
"No," Tony explained, "I mean, is it Nott who's trying to let the Death Eaters in?" He smiled at Draco's shocked look. "It stands to reason, doesn't it? Three boys whose fathers are Death Eaters, and it sounds like a complicated thing to do. You wouldn't charge Crabbe or Goyle with that, no offense. Not to mention- he's got a motive to fight for that side, doesn't he?" He paused, assessing in that detached Ravenclaw way. "Why are you keeping this so secret?"
RON, HERMIONE, AND DRACO
Draco was disappointed but not surprised. "You're holding our godfather-godson bonding time as ransom against me?" he pouted. "You don't mean it. You wouldn't really send me away."
He went downwards.
The cabinet looked almost like a varnished black walnut, just like his wand, though there was less brown in it and more dark gray.
Nymphadora's Stunner caught Black square in the face. He crumbled to the ground, with Robards behind her raising his wand over Black-
," Harry said without thinking, and then his face froze. "I mean- God, Draco, I'm sorry..."
Pansy shrank back, nearly falling into her chair. She covered her mouth with a look of real fear in her eyes. Draco remembered those eyes looking back at him after his disastrous first kiss with her, an hour after the end of the Yule Ball. He found he had no space in him for pity.
admirers-"
"Sectilis procella!" Theo yelled. Draco could have reflected back the tiny deadly shots of dark magic that flew through the air at him like small arrowheads, but he absorbed them instead. He couldn't have Theo's arm sliced up. Not before he
Grindelwald laughed and clapped his hands like a child at a country fair as the forms of the helpless Death Eaters soared one by one through the air into the fighting ones from behind, propelled like a series of heavy black-robed bullets.
"No," Draco said, staring down at his hands. He already regretted letting Luna paint his nails yesterday. The black hue looked the dark rusty color of dried blood in the light from McGonagall's tower window.
"No," Severus said flatly, turning to go, before one of the seventh-years called out to him.
"Oh, Harry, I've been so worried! I wish we could have told you everything!" she sniffled, which was exactly what Draco should have started with. Yet the words still just put more irritation on that handsome, implacable visage, the outrage of someone who had decided himself abandoned, and wasn't about to acknowledge anything that would shake his conviction of that. "It's so good to see you! I can't believe that Dementors-"
Slowly, throat catching, Draco shook his head.
sake, they'd let you get away with anything.
? Would an antidote to an existing love potion work, even if the obsession hadn't been engendered by magical means-"
He avoided Gryffindors until their first shared class, Double Potions on Friday morning. He remembered Severus's classes as a highlight of his week, both from the impressiveness of Severus in his brooding theatrical element, mastery of his art apparent for anyone with brains, and from the even higher theater that had been Severus's continuous persecution of brainless Gryffindors. Draco's anticipation was tempered, though, by the realization he would have to spend a considerable time in the same room as Harry Potter. Yes, they had both been in the Great Hall, and with Potter craning his neck in Draco's direction once or twice, but that barely counted. This did, and though Draco timed his arrival to avoid socializing before the start of class, he still felt increased proximity to Potter as an infinitely self-proliferating wound, trapped by late arrival into one of the nearest desks to the Gryffindors, which meant nearer to his least favorite person alive.
"No, I'm sure," Theo said, and Draco got up like he was walking to his execution.
"I can, though," Draco said confidently. He
always calling your father that."
The Black Quill was in the top drawer of her desk, separated from the others, darker and thinner and more sinister-looking. He had thought her too poor to afford more than one of these nasty things- Merlin, was he glad his father had never decided to invest in one- and so it appeared. If she had more or ordered another, he would just break in and curse those too. "Flagrante," he whispered. He put all the force of the talon wand into it, to be sure it would be hard to break. When he put a fingernail to it to test it after, he nearly burned off the entire finger.
fault?" Draco groused, only to stop when they passed the next compartment, throw the door open, throw his arms in the air, and shriek, "COUSIN!"
"I don't have the temperament to be an Auror," Draco scoffed, wiping some wetness from his eyes, he was laughing so hard. "I don't have the temperament to be anything except-"
"Why not?"
Bole looked pained. "I'm not going to say that to
Draco cut out of the feast as soon as it was respectably possible, not wanting to get caught up anywhere near the drama that would be ensuing any minute now in front of Gryffindor Tower. It was a welcome relief, the thought of what seemed the inevitable Halloween chaos not involving him for once. He had his books to scour for any references to the spell he needed. Except he had not even made it back securely into his dorm, before the word started around that they were all to go to the Great Hall.
history." She started to giggle at the cross look he gave her. "Don't worry, I won't remind your parents. Your mother was already shocked to see the bracelet you made me. Why didn't you tell me it was a replica of hers? She went and got the original to show me."
"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position," Lockhart told them all. "On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course."
The sun was shining too brilliantly and the sky was too blue on that brisk September day for what could be the precipitous end to the chances of the forces of light. He had a distinct mortifying memory of Hooch correcting his grip the first time, but after his years as Slytherin seeker, this time she had nothing of his to correct. Otherwise, the memory unfolded as if he was outside himself watching in a Pensieve. There was the crisp hit of the school broomstick against his palm when told
father." Still no laugh. "Of course, Father isn't nearly that adept with hellfire-"
At least Draco'd had the sense not to lead with the bunny ears one this time. "I came here to thank you," he said more seriously, "For all your help, Aberforth. I did- put the letter you gave me to use, and it helped me find the answers I needed. Well- some of them, but- that's not the point. What it is, it's that I owe you a debt, and if you're ever in trouble or need a favor, you know where to find me." Aberforth remained silent. "What?" Draco pouted. "A favor from a wizard as powerful as me is no small thing to-"

"If you don't like it," Draco said with a smirk to himself, "Take it up with Lupin."
"Father's coming tonight," Luna said happily, and Neville nearly jumped out of his skin.
"It's been a while," Harry said softly, "I missed you. We all did."
"Three things, actually," Severus sighed. "That is the first. The second is his complete control over the Dementor he made of young Phineas. The third is his vow that he would burn Hogwarts to the ground." Draco actually cried out then. "Am I mad to think so? Maybe he meant to convert more dragons and humans at the reserve, or maybe just take Astaroth. But he did tell his only two friends in the world to stay away from Hogwarts, and expect him back in England before too long."
Harry was sulky with Draco when he joined them at the Three Broomsticks, even though Draco left out the part where he'd squabbled with his father. He remained so until Draco had to break his own resolution that Monday afternoon, when Draco asked him if the Gryffindors had gotten to the centaur uprisings yet in History of Magic, and Harry snapped at him, "Do your own bloody work, you prick!"
hold it.
"Harry Potter," Draco said, and took his hand, "Will you wear my favor or not?"
Apparently Hagrid and 8-year-old Draco had more in common than he would have thought.
"Because," Draco said calmly, "I told you to."
"Oh, it's one thing to be ostracized when they thought you were the Heir of Slytherin," Luna said happily. "That was terribly unfair. But for love, Draco? Oh, it's so

Harry was already in possession of a decent Protego, though lean into a spell a bit and Draco found himself generally able to break it, casting Expelliarmus or a soft Everte statum. He set Harry to trying to hold his shields as long as possible, time after time. Draco had set an hourglass for two hours, the recommended maximum length of any session in the book. By the time the hourglass was half-done, Harry was drenched in sweat, with Draco immaculate in his Slytherin uniform. "This is like torture," Harry groaned. "Why did I think this would be fun?"
"What's that," Draco sighed, and both her hands shook where they were holding onto the chain, clinging so hard all her knuckles were white.
for me, Harry, you shouldn't have to face the world about all this alone-"
"Is this some kind of trick?" one of the Lestrange men demanded, and Father held up a hand, gaze going greedy. He wanted to believe so badly that he could pull this off, to prove his worth. He wanted to believe he could have his son and his good name and all his power back, and everything would be exactly as he wished, because he was a Malfoy.
Draco considered, then stretched out on his back beside Harry, and began prodding him in the calf with his foot to get his attention. "Here's one, Harry. Can you do a Disillusionment charm?"
"I know you say he couldn't see anything to help in the Pensieve memory, no matter how much he looked. But he must have
Aunt Bella wanting her wand back, which he
"Professor Lupin took out the rat," Hermione said, "And used a spell on him to make him leave his Animagus form." Percy began to write again, but he was redder than his hair.
Vince and Greg exchanged a nervous glance of their own. "Draco wasn't at dinner at all. Like he knew what was coming," Vince said to Greg in the world's worst covert whisper. "Maybe he's the one who let the troll into the dungeons."
Draco could see some of the details cause a nearly imperceptible flicker in the familiar black of Severus's eyes. Maybe he had known some of that already, and Draco's use of real truths from a false source would serve the lie well. "And I told Hermione, and she said..."
"Don't make them disappear, they're such lovely snakes," Luna pleaded. At least she had the virtue of consistency. Draco smiled at her as he pocketed Periander's wand for himself, trying his best to tell Dantanian that he had truly no intent of ever using this one, no melting necessary.
"No!"
"Vipera relashio," Draco kept telling Sirius as they exited their dueling room. "The counter-curse is Vipera relashio,
"Right, er, that's what I said," Gilderoy said valiantly.
He had to defy Severus, which never endeared him to the man, when Severus called him to his rooms late one night and advised him to avoid Lockhart's new Dueling Club. "If you truly wish not to draw attention to yourself."
"Don't worry," Draco said, putting on more confidence than he felt. "I'll swing by the hospital wing on my way to dinner and give Blaise some salutary threats. It will all blow over in no time."
"Um, 21?" Charlie said, face paling, and hurriedly pulled back from Draco's side.

It was his ability to talk anyone he met into helping him try and escape, given enough time with them. And they were

to tell the truth-
Draco gasped theatrically. "Luna! You dirty little cousin, you may not!"
"A plan for our aunt," Luna hissed, in a thankfully low whisper as their steps took them to Hagrid's hut. Draco didn't feel like looking at other Slytherins right now, with the presentiment of their inevitable loss at the Quidditch Cup feeling all the stronger, and it seemed a small comfort at least to hear Hagrid's steady prattle. And he wanted a hug from Imoogi yesterday.
None of them wanted to stick around to witness the Gryffindor pile, as the players all fell on each other, with a sobbing Wood hugging Potter too closely for Draco's liking, and both male and female players making an undignified heap in the mud. There was a pitch invasion like last time, and it was nice in a way, to see that all that hysterical Gryffindor glee hadn't merely been prompted by beating Slytherin on the pitch.
"Don't you dare!" Ron protested, but Draco's taunt had made Potter look back at the carving with new determination. Hissing sounds came out of Potter's mouth, at once turning him from a mere second-year to something eerie and ethereal, even before the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. And then the sink slowly lowered itself down into the floor and beyond the range of sight, showing a pipe with a human-sized opening, which did not at all look like a dignified place for a Malfoy to climb down, but would perhaps have been acceptable to deign to enter in a pinch, if actually saving his cousin.
"It'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view," said Hermione earnestly.
It took Gilderoy an inordinate amount of time to cut, but eventually, enough blond hair landed in the stone. "Make sure none of yours got in," Draco warned. Gilderoy solemnly went through hair by hair, to make sure all of it was white-blond and not faded gold. "Step back. Time to see if I'm worthy of Dantanian's legacy."
pack, at the center of the rough floor, while Gilderoy dropped his load of brooms with a relieved sigh. "Be careful, two of those are Firebolts," Harry cautioned, as if Firebolts had been released before Gilderoy was sucked into his vampiric self-improvement camp of sorts. As it was, Gilderoy just looked very simple in his blinking confusion, blue eyes squinted hard still from the blow of the past wind.
"Yes," she said unhappily. "Except for our Danny- wait- Fred, look at his
Her explanation was delivered at first distrustfully, stilting and cold, but she was fighting back tears by the time she admitted that it was neither certain nor uncertain whether she would end her life as human or animal, or even which kind of animal. "Reptilian, though, surely," Dantanian said, and then brightened. "Lamia, I've always thought dragons were so beautiful. Might you become a dragon?"

Draco had been avoiding looking at Maledictum directly, but he had to once Periander picked her up for the burial. "Um, do you want to say a few words, or..." Draco hoped Periander wouldn't want him to. What was he supposed to say, beyond
Severus was trying and failing to get in a word edgewise against Gilderoy. "Needless to say, I will require the assistance of a powerful wizard to complete Tempus Itinerantur. As well as his expertise in Transfiguration, above any that
If only he had been brave enough to stay and watch the Liquid Fiendfyre.
"So." Draco drew a heavy sigh. "Looks like we know where we're going," and jerked his thumb upwards.

"He was testing him," Grindelwald surmised. "He wanted to see if he was worthy of it, and whether he really was enough of a paragon of heroic virtue to live up to that exalted title. These tests of worthiness do grind my gears, to parrot a more modern expression. But that is very much like Albus. I would have thought him less of an idealist in his elder years. Or at least I would have hoped."
in it..."
Draco told himself Severus didn't mean it, or at least wouldn't after he'd had more time to cool off. But that distance still had him pouting like every bit of the child he looked, when Severus handed him the sign-up list for Christmas and gave him a warning. "Do not expect my rooms to be open for you to come around loitering and whining as you please," he said in a low voice, "Just because it is the holidays. If you expect any coddling, Draco, you would be better served going home for Christmas to your parents."

The boys looked awed and intimidated, though Terry was nodding. "That makes sense, like Xaphan," he said thoughtfully. "That's the legend of Xaphan, right? He was a lesser fallen angel, but he's the one who had the idea to set heaven on fire on their way out of it. So of course those would be angels with
What seemed to soften Ron's jealousy, then, was Draco's invitation to practice with him on his night flights. Upon Draco's ascension to Seeker, Severus had increased his blanket permission to extend from Friday to Sunday. Granted, Ron spent the first night with his wand out half the time, looking convinced Draco would curse him to fall to his death. But by the first Sunday, he was joyfully repelling Draco's poor Quaffle throws with the swagger of sixth-year Weasley vs. Slytherin.
"Of course," Severus said, pinching the bridge of his nose anew. "Of course my godson, in his infinite wisdom, has chosen to trust the most important information he has ever had the misfortune to learn, to Hermione Granger
Draco Black, great dark wizard of his times.
"Ron, Harry, say hello."
"Draco," Severus said, and took the edges of the blanket to wrap it more securely around his godson's trembling form. "Listen to me. I have researched this topic myself, as it happens, and if you trust in my expertise in Potions
12, not 11. Pretty ahead in age for her year, then. That explained some of the precociousness, and why he found her a bit less mind-numbingly childish to talk to than the first-year Slytherins. Draco wished he had known that all those times Father berated him for performing worse than her. Not that Father would have accepted it as an excuse.
to be, if you could step inside the mirror..."
They ran into all of his fellow Slytherins in time. They met Vince and Greg at one of the many buffet tables, this one beside the great moonstone fountain of lychee nectar that Draco had spent half the galas in his childhood sneakily sticking his face right into. Vince and Greg proved civil enough to him and Luna, not even remarking unfavorably when he directed Luna to stick her face under the stream of nectar beside him. That was, once Draco turned a blind eye to them carrying off an entire platter of honeyed macadamia conch shells between them.
get me for Nott, the inquest was formally shut, there's double jeopardy, it's just a bluff-"
"You're going to die, Sirius will die, Severus will die," Draco gasped, tears falling again, feeling he would be sick, as he tried to follow the breaths Remus was directing him in. But they were coming double-time, even at Remus's steady rhythm. "So many people...
"I'm not going to hurt you," Draco sighed. "I don't disapprove of you and Luna, you know that, don't you? If she's decided she wants to date you, then good for her! And needless to say, good for you. You're going out with one of the two prettiest, smartest, most loyal and fearless girls in the entire school- no, the entire
"You are, aren't you-"
Potter only got in a word edgewise when Luna asked about the tent, which he said they had set up themselves. Draco managed to avoid making a face at the mention of manual labor, and almost not to let that cast his mind towards that extra bit more the athlete's muscles in Potter's lean shoulders and biceps had filled out over the summer. "We didn't even have the eldest three to help," Potter said, in what sounded an insecure sort of bragging, and then Luna's giggle and surreptitious look at Draco made him turn to Draco suspiciously in turn. "What? What's so funny?"
"No, I'm not," Draco laughed. "My reflexes are shit, Harry, especially compared to yours."
"What does it look like?" Draco said, and lied with skill, "I'm showing my allegiances, of course." He shot a nasty look in the direction of Diggory to make it clear at whose expense he meant that. His friends tended to believe his lies more when he embellished them with spiteful motives. "
"I don't-"
I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.
Draco cast Theo and his lip-biting out of his mind, but Theo's concern bore unexpected fruit, not that evening but the next. Draco was reclining in his bed, reading the book Hermione had snuck him on wand science without his curtains locked- Severus's express orders, before he was deemed fully recovered. It made it easy for his dormmates to get his attention when they entered in a knot, unusually quiet.
Being found here by Severus or not, it was much of the same, whatever suspicions of plotting it might arouse in Draco's godfather. Because he would not
"Private matters between myself and the Minister are hardly any concern of yours-" Father began. But Draco's resolution to keep his head down this year didn't even last until he got around to writing it down.
"Um, okay, there was the once," he babbled. "But I didn't know what I was getting into, I wasn't told there'd be blood involved. I was coerced, if anything
The feeling of Harry pushing him and sealing their lips sent tremors all through him, stomach full of butterflies at the force. "I hate it," Harry breathed, "When you use Langlock," and kissed Draco so hard, people behind the statue had to hear the sound of their lips pressing together.
We're in the same year at Hogwarts, and I hate to criticize, dear cousin- or should I call you Uncle Sirius? I think that's not uncommon for a first cousin once removed- not to be overly harsh,
"Harry really messes with your head, doesn't he," Ron laughed, diving to grab the Quaffle after Draco just let it hit his arm for a third time rather than catching it. He swooped back up with a cheeky grin. "What were you whispering about over there anyway? I thought you might like Nott these days. Don't tell me you fancy
"Except for my, er, my godfather, 'course," Draco said uneasily, trying to pull his arm away, but the motion just let a very drunken Theo slide his fingers down to intertwine with Draco's.
No, there was no mirror like he remembered from the night the Wizengamot pardoned him. He tried facing himself in other mirrors in various rooms, even his own, and shattering them, but all that gave him was the onerously repetitive task of repairing each mirror in turn, and sometimes his own hands or face from shards that had flown at him. Even independent of the insipid yellow-haired cherub that greeted him each morning as his farcical reflection, he was beginning to nourish an unhealthy hatred of mirrors.
"I'm sorry you had to hear Ron saying those things about your father," Potter said earnestly, green eyes shining at him without looking away, even when McGonagall opened the doors and took over herding them in.
"Quidditch matches are back on!" roared Oliver Wood excitedly from the Gryffindor table, which, could he just
"Tonight," Nissy cried in utter ecstasy, "Hogwarts is falling!"
Draco had a lot of free time to spend lolling about in bed feeling sorry for himself, which meant a lot of time to bellow for Theo to come read to him. They hadn't heard back yet from Charlie, but there was the dark magic tomes to look through. And they happened by chance upon a page, listed after Cadaunuptium in Moste Dark Blood Rituals of the Demon Goddess Hecate, whose name caught Draco's attention: Naufragiam.
"Auntslayer-
"No," Ron said wearily, "Because he's so
Krum could not have looked more baffled. "Vy? Because I am famous at Quidditch?"
"Seen enough bodies with the Dark Mark on them to know it," Bluthers said, eyeing her like he thought her the greatest imbecile he had ever encountered, and he passed his time with corpses.
him back then, not like that," Harry muttered, cheeks going red, "I just thought he was the Heir of Slytherin," but Gilderoy's smile was hardly dented.
Phineas breathed out hard and squirmed, testing his bonds fruitlessly.
Neville Longbottom had been sitting beside Luna, speaking intently in her ear, only to leap to his feet red-faced at the sound of Draco's voice. Luna just looked up and gave her patient smile.
have told me-"
He didn't know how he could ever have thought the red line was purgatory. If this was death that the mirror had sent him to, he couldn't imagine any more perfect image of heaven.
Draco had a spring in his step as he made his way to the dorms. How could the Gryffindors think anyone as wise and beneficent as Severus Snape could possibly be responsible for any wrongdoing?
"Because I'm going to be an Unspeakable." Over and over, until maybe they would get the message, and the first-year Slytherins would do what everyone in all the other houses and years did, and leave the quiet scowling Malfoy boy alone.
"Draco, I also... I haven't told anyone this... but I had this other thought. When we were taking the Portkey. I looked at Dumbledore and I wanted to hurt him. A lot. My scar was burning so hot... I hated him so much, and I wanted my fangs in him..."
Draco to go to Nurmengard.
It wasn't clear what that did to Draco's heart then, how much it was disappointment or relief. "It will be good to see Ron, but- Hermione, does he know?"
was meant to be sat at the center in chains. He saw both Remus and Severus glancing uneasily at that chair as well.
"And what is your cause this time, and should I expect more infractions of the rules to follow?"
"What was that?" Hermione asked, looking impressed. "I didn't know you speak French."
Draco cast Everte statum. It sent Periander crashing into the snow-filled remains of what must have once been a fountain. Indeed, there was ice enough frozen under the snow, making his fall harsher than expected. That attested that, up to recently, there had been running water. There were browned autumn leaves frozen in ice that shattered, as Periander evaded Draco's attempt to catch him with Incarcerous. Then the branches that had dropped those leaves fell too. Periander aimed at the sphinx and shot his next curse too high. Unless he meant to bring
"How noble of you," Draco said caustically, and Grindelwald leaned forward to stare at his watch again. "What is that? Why do you keep checking the time?"
"You'd think they'd make an exception," Luna said cheerfully. "With the darkest wizard in history on your tail, Harry, you think they'd be willing to fudge a few dates to give you the right to Apparate away from him."
!" Draco had to hold Harry back, hugging him around the middle from behind.

"Really?" Hermione asked, looking worried, and Draco shrugged.
"That won't happen," Draco said lightly. "Hermione promised, and she's far too stubborn to be shook loose. And hey, someone's gonna have to stay to look after the less exciting dark wizard we've taken into our captivity." Dobby as well as the others grimaced at the reminder of foul-spirited Karkaroff, who had been moved to the cellars of Xaphan for at least the beginning of Grindelwald's inhabitance of L'Infern. Best to break the Prisoner of Nurmengard gently into the idea of having a roommate.
When Draco stepped out of the passage into the Room of Requirement, he was not alone. The Room had been shaped into the small room with armchairs and a fire that he had used for Occlumency training with Harry, a room that seemed to welcome him still. The once-green chair was blue. And in the Gryffindor-red armchair, Harry was there, his lap piled with homework he was not doing. His glasses had slipped down his face. He'd fallen asleep. And there was a parchment on his lap, in all likelihood better than Draco could have done.
It was appalling selfishness, but it was hard to feel too bad about it, when not only he but Harry seemed happier than he had ever seen him in either timeline. Harry positively glowed every time Draco was in the vicinity, and
"What quills?" went Longbottom, while Finnigan glowered at Draco like a willful saboteur.
"Okay, Ron," Draco said, testing the waters. "I'm going to trust you with something I've never discussed with anyone, even the people it involves. If you tell a single soul, intentionally or not, I'll cast Langlock on you every morning for at least a week. Maybe a month. Depends on my mood at the time. Maybe Oscausi instead! And then it's Verniculpa
"I told you!" Potter exploded, so loud that not just Madam Pince but all the nearby tables shot a menacing look in their direction. "I told you! Didn't I tell you, Ron! I knew you would take her side, Draco! You always do! You would even if it was the other way around!" Hermione felt self-consciously at the new charm on her rapidly expanding bracelet, a pomegranate symbol for the goddess Persephone, and Potter's eyes followed it. "Even if it

Karkaroff gave an almost Severus-like eye roll as he opened the tome, flipping straight to a section near the back. He handled it with a familiarity not even Gilderoy could boast of. "

Draco wouldn't put his name and Wormtail's together on a
Maybe there was something there, and not just on Gilderoy's side.
These lessons will certainly serve him well if our suspicions prove true about Karkaroff. I'm glad Harry has you around him, to protect him if he needs it, and to guide him to become a stronger wizard. You're lucky too, Draco. It's rare for there to be one wizard your age with as much raw magical power and talent as you have, let alone two. Harry being there will help you push yourself in ways you couldn't without him. The two of you complement each other perfectly.

"Mon dieu," Dantanian breathed, and rubbed his eyes like he could not believe what they were seeing. "Mon
his own. But poor Neville and Luna. With effort, a now house-less Draco settled himself beside Luna instead for the rest of the ride.
"I love you, Hermione," he gasped, and her eyes when they went to his were unsettled.
"Well, if that's how you're going to play it," Blaise said sulkily, slinking away, and was civil but short with Draco after that. Nor did he make an effort to walk with Draco to classes anymore.
"Severus," he gasped, stumbling and steadying himself and the shelf before the worst came, though he dropped his wand in the process. Severus picked it up with an unreadable look on his Lumos-shadowed face, clad in the same billowing head-to-toe black robes it seemed he had been born and died in. Draco looked from Severus's face to his wand in Severus's hand and back to each again and knew he should be afraid with this tableau, and yet the most ridiculous urge to hug Severus was the feeling that surged up to dominate in him, the need to seize Severus and scream
"Tomorrow," Draco said, and when Gilderoy looked too anxious to function, took pity on him. "I'll talk to you about it tomorrow. Just to think. To brainstorm ideas." They were too close to the others to say any names, so Draco just lowered his voice to the smallest it could go, and repeated three times in Gilderoy's ear for him to understand:
on them...
Draco thanked him and went to head out. But he hesitated at the door. "Wait, sir- I don't want to impose more, but could I possibly have permission for Thursday night this week? Only this week. It's Hermione Granger's birthday, and we wanted to do something special, because she'll be seventeen- it's her coming of age..."
The light faded, to the sight of Dementors dissipating away in the clearing night air, disentangling from where they had been crouched together ready to feast: the unmoving form of Harry Potter, in robes too darkened by water and mud to tell they were meant to be red.
"Not," Draco drawled, "That I'm not willing to
If he looked around, omitting the matter of a war, things couldn't be better. After a rough start, he had four of the best friends anyone could dream of, one that he loved and was dating, another his genius best friend, another his beloved cousin, and then Ron, one of the funniest, most down-to-earth people he had ever met.
"That the decision remains, in the end, Orpheus's own choice."
Neville tried to buy Luna a yellow rose, and Draco had to shake his confidence by yelling at him. "Yellow roses mean friendship, you uncultured swine!"
"Do you think that could end up happening to you?" she asked with a hitch in her voice, overwrought by everything she had been forced to see without warning. She ran her fingers over the burn where Sirius had once been.
Luna and Draco exchanged blank looks. "Does that mean I'm not allowed to catch snowflakes on my tongue?" Luna asked dubiously. It had begun to snow lightly, and she had indeed been engaging in such a sin for minutes on end.
burned my bridges with Phineas Black abandoning him as I did. But I was distracted soon by the rumors of the Elder Wand, and after I had it, there were
Draco did love Harry. He had tried not to, but almost since he met him, back in the blue loop, it felt like he had. Or at least his waking and sleeping moments both had all been dominated by the awareness that Harry Potter existed in the world. It was a problem he had to try and solve and had not yet to this day managed, like he could not simply carry on being Draco Malfoy unless something was done about Potter. What that something was, he couldn't say. Perhaps the prophecy had some kind of insight for him.
"Yeah. It's the same for you, right? Don't
"Draco? Is that you?" She tilted her head as if expecting someone else using Polyjuice. "You never want to talk to me."
Draco was just making it worse. "I know you've never done anything to make me distrust you, sir- you're my godfather, and I believe you, I'm sorry-" Draco didn't have to lie. It was becoming deadly clear how wrong he had been. He should have followed his instincts from the start to trust Severus. But after that talk with Potter, his mind had been so clouded- "I just couldn't understand why this is happening with the Chamber of Secrets, when the diary should have-"
Draco's forced smile froze on his face. "I don't think so," he had to say, and followed his mother into the growing dusk.
"Do you have an explanation for your spying, Potter, or must I go to my Quidditch captain about this? Or perhaps your Head of House would be gratified to hear you-"
Severus looked at Draco sharply, though at least there was no stab at his mind, then stroked his hair gently, almost tenderly. "My burdensome godson," he said softly. "Worry not after my
called that?"
"Not for long. We'll bring him here once we can make a plan to get past those Muggles-"
Maybe Draco shouldn't have been so smug about the flying lesson. Maybe the past was just harder to avoid than he had thought. Especially if you joked about what you remembered happening, and expected a brainless Gryffindor not to take it as an invitation.
She took his hand and looked up at him as if he was some kind of actual authority. "Do

"Never," Harry gasped, "Never," and kissed him so hard and so long Draco did feel like he was going to stop breathing. He only broke off when he had to, and then it was shallower kisses between gasps, with Harry panting
From Mrs. Weasley, Draco received his first-ever Weasley jumper, an oversized dark green one with a large silver D on the front. Harry gave him an incredibly expensive-looking set of model dragons, enchanted to begin flapping around when touched, letting off small gusts of bluebell flame. It would have been well-calculated to capture the attention, except for then Sirius and Remus brought out their present from another room. Its distinctive shape meant that there would have been no hiding what it was, even wrapped, and they hadn't even tried. There were just two jumbo metallic ribbons tied to it, one emerald and one silver. It was a Firebolt.
"No," Severus sighed. He dropped the painting and sank to sit behind Draco, pinching the bridge of his nose. "There is no practical need. I repeat to you, that is our secret. No one must know the truth of Mr. Nott's death." He hesitated, eyeing Draco with something like sympathy, then of all moments. "Is that why you wished so powerfully to find the Resurrection Stone? To bring back Mr. Nott?"
☒10: Blasting: Finestra, Expulso, Reducto, Bombarda, Bombarda maxima, Confringo
But whatever world of passion Draco read into those firelit green eyes, Harry's words were more circumspect.
"You don't agree with that, do you?" Draco whined. Severus shook him off and stalked away. "Is this for what happened during break?" he called after him. "Are you punishing me?"
Draco might very well lose. His mind had gone to the one place he was almost sure they wouldn't be caught, and forgotten he hadn't stepped foot in it since first year. That had been a major panic attack, which marked it as avoid-at-all-costs thereafter.
Draco felt bewildered tears of his own threaten at the back of his eyes. "No, Harry, I swear, I'll swear on anything, I'll take Veritaserum- I mean, I know I'm an Occlumens, but I can take it anyway, or you can try and look in my head- I mean, I know you can't, but- Harry, just please, I'll tell you anything you want-"
"And what would be the point of that?" Draco challenged. "What would happen if you knew
"Animals," he said, pointing at each of the Grangers in turn. "Filth unworthy to set foot in these ancient halls.
"Fell out of his pocket," he told her, before deciding the ropes were secure enough, and signaling for her to wake their captive. She obeyed and heard his maddened snarl, but her attention went to the vial. Luna peered over and looked puzzled, but Hermione's keen brown eyes widened in recognition just from the smell, not even having to look. Periander's sharp violet gaze went from indignant to stricken at the sight of his captors' discovery and their understanding, and the guilt that Draco had felt was blissfully gone. He had to resist the urge to strike the man across the face, just because, as he asked his first person.
Draco's face lit up. "Will there be a trial, do you think?"
Sweet Salazar, the man had noticed her already? Didn't waste any time in Bulgaria, it seemed. "Yeah,
He was one of the most important followers of the Dark Lord. They were called Death Eaters." She recited merciless facts like nothing but trivia from a book. To her, they still were. "I don't know why."
"You don't think it's special," Draco laughed, "Going out at Madam Puddifoot's, together, you and I, in front of the whole world? My, Chosen One, your standards
"I vould become your enemy," Krum said grimly. "And I have heard vat you do to your enemies. I understand. I could not be cruel to Hermione even if I vanted. I promise you." And then Draco let him at the brooms, and they went out for a very late December flight.
to play with those soul-sucking blots around-"
to die?" Severus's voice was firm as stone. "This changes nothing. You convinced the world and they believed it. Do not waste that. Anyone could have misheard. You are not at fault. Nott was fighting for the Dark Lord. He knew the risks. Have no pity for him or his son."
No, Barty Crouch Jr. had not managed to spoil Hermione's birthday.
But that was the thing. Father couldn't make everything right anymore. Most of the time, all he did was make things worse.
Draco's breakfast of eggs and bacon was unceremoniously taken from him, when it was knocked from his hands by a hurtling Granger. She flung herself into his arms with a garbled shriek. Weasley followed, hovering awkwardly over his sickbed with a hand raised in greeting. "Hey, uh, looks like the bacon stayed on the plate, mate." He picked it up and put it back on the table beside Draco, making a face. "Doesn't look like the eggs survived Hermione, though."
Harry's hands spasmed at his sides, like it was a struggle not to grab Draco again right away. "You tell me, Malfoy."
"When the body was brought to me from Hogwarts. Early morning, June 26th, 1995."
She smiled, as the door closed, and Draco's footsteps came to a halt. She folded her hands, leaned forward, and asked with her askew smile,
Maybe it felt good because it was unequivocally
"You might have to wait a while for your wand or come back tomorrow," Draco said, knowing he should give Potter a reason to go and find his pet giant rather than linger around here, doing incomprehensible things like laughing at Draco's jokes and smiling at him with eyes that hadn't changed at all. "My parents aren't happy about the wand that chose me. They could be in there with Ollivander all night."
Just like Father had always proclaimed the Malfoys descended from the blood of Slytherin. "He just knows there's rumors. Probably from the lot of you writing to
"We should..." Harry licked his lips when Draco undid his tie completely. "What are you going to do about the threat? I wanted to make sure you weren't scared..."
"Where is the lie?" Draco said, throwing his arms out dramatically, and the outrage died on Harry's lips, as the gesture made Harry's eyes drop over Draco's torso. Draco didn't have a shirt on, for one of many hot summer nights in a stuffy old house. Harry seemed suddenly more aware of that fact than before. And Draco was aware of Harry being aware, and this balmy room seemed at once twice as stifling hot.
, from what he wanted.
The Gryffindors caught up to Draco as they were exiting the Hogwarts Express, and Draco fell into step with Hermione, to go back through the barrier together. She linked her arm with his and tried to give him a bit of parchment, which he happily took until she told him it was from Potter. "It's for you," she said. "It's a telephone number. He says after you spent a week with me and my parents, you should know how to work a telephone. He wants us all to call him up, because he can't stand just having those awful relatives of his to speak to. Draco, you should consider it-"
Draco was hustled out along with the others, without time to get dressed, though that did lend more credence to his picture as hapless victim. He only managed to get Luna to put back on her Sleeping Beauty necklace before they were pulling on only their shoes and racing out.
"Okay, okay!" Potter held his hands up. "You wouldn't think I was pathetic with all this stuff about my family? 'I know nothing will hurt me during the Tournament, because they're watching over me...'"
? You know Luna just wants the right to call him Uncle Remus, right?"
Harry was speaking to essentially Dumbledore's murderer here. If he was looking for condemnation, he was barking up the wrong tree. "Oh, definitely flashes from the Dark Lord," Draco yawned, and Harry looked torn between relief and exasperation.
"You will not," Severus groaned, disdain bleeding through more and more clearly as he straightened up, "Suddenly be possessed by someone else's magic or personality through their wand, Draco, however dark they were. If your father has been feeding your mind with such nonsense, speedily disabuse yourself of it. It is the
I'd be happier discussing Arithmancy with Hermione anyway-"
"Then it seems we're at an impasse," Draco gritted out, advancing footsteps closer to Greyback. The thought suddenly came into his head:
Sirius wrote back about magical exhaustion, but neither he or Remus had any more ideas than Severus. He turned down the offer of Fudge's pocket watch, but professed himself very impressed with Draco's betting prowess. The rest of the letter, apart from a few worrisome asides about the difficulty of Remus's most recent transformations, was mere commonplaces, anecdotes about the funny parts of being on the run together with his beloved Remus apart from the werewolf thing. So in all it was a useless letter, but it left Draco feeling very warm.
"Not force him,
"We can still win the cup," Theo said logically. "That's what's important, you know. It's only a fifty-point deficit. If we win our other two games by large enough margins, we could win it the way Gryffindor did in third year, even if they win
"We're going to save him," Draco breathed, as Severus blew the door off the broomshed open with a cursory wave of his wand, and found Draco's Nimbus 2001 and pressed it into his hand. "You're going to take me to him and help me save him. Where is he?"
After that Defense class, he could not have missed their old Defense professor more. In private, his fellow Slytherins had to concur. "Lupin was preparing us for the material we'll be tested on at least. How will torture help us get Os on our OWLs?" Theo asked crossly, as he helped Draco try to scrub off the ink from his wrist.
He made his first appearance at the Halloween Feast in the red line, and was amused to watch all of the Slytherin table seem to relax, seeing him take a seat there. Memories of him loosing the Malfoy family troll in the dungeons two years ago had not faded quickly. "No need for a public service announcement this year, then?" Blaise quipped.
Draco opened his mouth, to say that he'd had to kill Mr. Nott, to save Sirius. But with the regret on her face so matching his own, he felt unable to lie to her. They stared at each other for a long, hopeless moment, and Millie clearly tried to make her face harden. She somewhat succeeded. "You'd better have me good and cursed by tonight," she said menacingly, "Or I'll call up that reporter and tell him-" She seemed to fail at thinking of something sufficiently awful. "I'll tell him you're having an affair with Pansy or something!"
? Loony Lovegood? Are you serious? How many times do I have to tell you-"
be Draco only. The altruistic conclusion he was meant to cede Harry gracefully to Ginny Weasley or the like was a distant memory. And Harry, unlike Draco, had the grace not to make Draco jealous. If he ever had, Draco wouldn't have thrown punches, just curses...
"Oh, no, Uncle Sirius," Draco said weakly, trying to comfort Sirius by acting his old self. He forgot to feign surprise, but Sirius just seemed to take that as shock. "Are you no longer the most famous escaped Prisoner of Azkaban? Are you about to lose your title?"
"No, Viktor, I'm not seeing anyone else," Hermione sighed, and grabbed Draco's hand and squeezed it for courage. "I just... I'm really sorry, Viktor, you're a very nice person, and I really did enjoy going to the Yule Ball with you, it's just... I don't really know if we have very much in common, so I don't think we're very well-suited for each other..."
"You want any other gifts for luck?" Draco teased lightly, and Harry just smiled at him, tension written across his jaw and shoulders.
"I do sometimes," Harry admitted, "But not tonight. It was just this dream I've been having, of this long dark corridor. All the doors are locked, and I need to go further, but I can't. And every time I hit the same dead end, it feels like if I don't get through, I'll have failed, and..."
Draco gave it a thought, looking behind him. He seized on a figure he may have been seen staring at by his housemates before, albeit for worse reasons than they could ever suspect. "Cedric Diggory," he said nonchalantly.
Harry lowered the egg down beneath the bubbles, and there was not the wailing sound that Harry had told Draco to expect. Instead, there was the muffled sound of singing. "You need to put your head under, too," Myrtle added with a superior air. "Go on!"
It turned out, as Draco had feared, that Harry was far better at dueling than Occlumency. All his speed and reflexes did nothing for him, nor even his raw power. It was hard to conceive just how Harry's mind could be so emotional each time he pressed inside it, though Harry sometimes muttered things about Draco making it worse, saying it was just impossible to focus around
." He could have taken Harry to task for having so little trust in him. But given how it had been mere months since Harry found out about the Naufragiam, Draco couldn't exactly demand perfect untainted faith.
"How can you ask me that?" Dantanian spat, eyes huge and swollen already. It was impossible to distinguish the fall of tears from the beating of rain outside, which he made no effort to protect against.
"He taught you those spells?" Harry asked, visibly jealous.
Severus gave them an hour and a half to brew the draught of peace, which all of Draco's friends knew to be one of the anti-anxiety potions Draco regularly took. Once or twice, he had shared a vial with them. At least they didn't all gape at him when it was mentioned. The potion was difficult enough for them to be preoccupied with struggling to make it, and in many cases, failing.
"You have this," said Draco, and handed him a little gold-wrapped package smaller than his palm. Harry opened it, and found a slender golden ring in the shape of a rose. "It's a real rose, from the greenhouses. It was white. I transfigured it, and shrunk it, and covered it in gold. No magic on it but that. But it will look good on your hand, Harry."
cutting off every time he was about to make a useful point. And when they were told to practice the Color Change charm individually on their berets, she seemed to hone in immediately on the two least likely to succeed: Vince and Greg.
Her credulity only seemed to crack when she asked why Black had chosen now, to get out and try and find the living Pettigrew, and Draco drawled, "Well, guess who made the paper with a lottery they won to finance a trip to Egypt? And guess whose rat happens to be missing a finger?"
Harry kissed hard enough to sting, all teeth. Draco sucked back at his mouth, keeping his eyes open to stare right at those green ones. Then Harry's weight fell on his, Harry abandoning himself to the kiss completely, like throwing the last coherent thought out of either of their minds. All Draco could do was shut his eyes. Without Harry's glasses, their noses brushed together, every bit of contact more addictive, harder to talk himself out of, harder not to keep tasting.
"Would we get a reward if we caught him?" asked Ron, and Draco watched Hermione's grip tighten on her bags. He could practically read her mind sometimes, especially in moments like these-
"There's no need," Dantanian cut in, "To dwell on Dorian's stupidity any more than necessary." The closeness of Dorian's guess seemed to put unusual savageness in his voice.
help you? And speak no more of
"There," Potter said, "Just a bit more..."
integrity be questioned?"
"Miss Granger," Black said, though he was kind enough not to get to his feet when he offered her a hand to shake. "I've heard a lot about you."
"You said it already," Draco sighed, "The guards of Azkaban, they're going to be at Hogwarts. They're the most awful creatures in the entire world, I'd have them all killed if I could." He snuggled the covers tighter around himself, to keep insulated in that feeling of temporary warmth. "You don't know what a Dementor is?" Potter would soon find out. Draco would never forget Potter's susceptibility to the creatures the first time around. It had been like Christmas come early. Yes, it had given him material for
P.S. I really can't thank you and Hermione enough for the Wolfsbane Potion. Remus feels the same. We both feel ten years younger, not having had to kick the shit out of each other. Thank Merlin my clever nephew has such clever friends!
"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived tonight... Yes. Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor."
"You're the one who ought to be seeking out his company," Draco said mildly, "Given the number of lessons you'll be needing in defending against
Draco knew what it was, and immediately seized upon it with the instinct to carry it from the Great Hall before opening it, but he pulled too hard and the seal affixing the letter came off. He wasn't even surprised that it was his father's voice yelling, while laughter tittered around the entire hall and children nudged each other at his expense. He just couldn't believe his father would do this so publicly, if only in the name of the Malfoy family name, but he must have thought it would tarnish their name more for him not to make a public show of disapproval. And make it he did, with the blast of air and noise he made as high the darkness had come from his wand at Ollivander's.
"Theodore Nott will be there?" Potter asked, and Draco shrugged languidly.
of you-"
"I don't have to listen to you!" Draco yelled, "You're insane," and began to stalk away.
"Yes," Draco mumbled, shifting uneasily in his seat.
Gilderoy's knees had already been trembling along with his weak lips. Now they folded, taking him the short distance from hunched over down to the tower floor. He fell there, left knee onto a discarded old book that had to be prodding into the side of his leg. He didn't seem to feel it, caught in wordless appeal of supplication to a man he regarded like the personal arbiter of his fate.
"Fine!" Pansy yelled, tears in her voice. "Fine! We'll find Theo without you! Traitor!
He shouldn't have been hovering here, on the Firebolt he'd been prescient or paranoid enough to bring, watching her unseen for this long. She would hate for him to have been analyzing her, perceiving her weakness. She was
"You look so good," Harry breathed, "Your skin with the blue fire, you're like an angel."
Lockhart's hair was a mess, which had to drive him crazy. It took him an entertainingly long time for him to get back on his feet. "Well, there you have it!" he said, tottering back onto the platform. "That was a Disarming Charm- as you see, I've lost my wand- ah, thank you, Miss Brown. Yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy. However, I felt it would be instructive to let them see..."
control or influence over you, the way he may have at one time over Bellatrix Lestrange. There are many superficial similarities between him and you, yes, but the only ones that seem surely through
Oh no. Oh
He sent her several books along with the letter, the ninth and tenth of the summer already, and the fourth of which had been lent or gifted by Severus. Much as it would horrify his godfather to know the uses his thoughtfulness was being co-opted towards. He hesitated over how to react to the last lines in her letter.
"Yes, master... please, master... please..." Wormtail was moaning and writhing, to the point it was a miracle he hadn't passed out already from the pain. If Draco was him, he might have just cut his losses, turned to his Animagus form, and hightailed it out of there, three-footed rat on the go.
"Kiss me," Draco pleaded, poking his fingers at the mask over Harry's lips. Harry stared down at him, seeming unsure, then he leaned down and did as Draco told him, the metal of the stag sliding out of the way of his lips just before they met Draco's.
"I am," he said, and closed his eyes. "And I am trying. I think of the happiest memories I have, and clear my mind, and it's only ever these sparks. Why is it different for you?"
Hermione said talking to Sirius helped calm Harry. That made Draco glad he'd given Potter the two-way mirror, though he missed Sirius and even Remus a bit himself. Everything in the world hinged on the Chosen One making it through these pointlessly dangerous stunts in one piece, and Potter was resistant to even letting Draco help. So all he could do was make sure others helped, when Potter was too proud to show weakness in front of Draco himself.
At least, as the crabby and shabby-looking old man wandered into view from behind some other dilapidated ruins, Draco knew which of his iniquities he would have to answer for.
can't
"I'm putting him on now anyway," Draco said. Sirius looked beseechingly at Remus, who seemed to think for a moment, before nodding.
Severus's lip curled unpleasantly, as if at the suggestion of whom that group could include. "The
"Fine," Pansy hissed. "Just keep it. Do whatever you want with it. Sell it. I don't care!"
wouldn't."
Grimmauld was dark, but at least it was warm, and when Black Apparated to the pavement between 11 and 13, he actually had a smile on his face. "Hello?" he called, looking around in that unsteady, disarmingly friendly way of his that threatened to either remind you of Aunt Bella or make you like him, both of which were dismal prospects. It stabbed Draco with guilt to leave him hanging, but Severus would be along any moment, and he would have far more to occupy him.
Dumbledore did bother. He raised his hand and waited for silence before continuing. "There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom."
many places," Draco complained.
He squared his shoulders, smirked at Theo, and drawled out, "Ready to have your charms look sub-par in comparison to mine, gentlemen?" To his surprise, none of them looked offended or amused, just terrified, even Theo, as if they all took him at his word. And
"Hey, Draco, you're with McGonagall," Millie called, looking over from the notice with a laugh. "Have they
It stuck in Draco's mind, though, over the next few days, in which Remus was kind enough not to press the issue of real Patronus lessons. It stuck in Draco's mind as the Order finally assembled with the mission to remove Harry from the Dursleys, with Mad-Eye Moody's foreboding presence in their mist not enough to keep Draco from hanging around trying to demand to come. The eight volunteers they had, Remus said, were more than enough, but Draco only desisted once Sirius reminded him, none too quietly, of his inability to produce a Patronus, should they run into more Dementors after Harry on their way out.
gifted at your studies... but when you try to plan, you so often fail, reckless as you say, and act often without the calculation and clear thought of Ravenclaw..."
There was just one piece left of stagecraft to execute. Draco went over to the Convent Coven where they were playing in front of the large tower windows, moonlight brilliant behind them, and made his song request. By the time he made it back to his friends, they'd struck up a slow, dreamy, but unmistakable rendition of the 'Tale as Old as Time' song. "Hermione, that's your cue," Draco drawled, eager to get Ron and Hermione at the romantic bit before they could spoil it by actually talking. "Beauty, time to gather your beast."
Dantanian only stopped when he reached the edge of the Manor gardens, no small feat, and any light or music was but an indistinct flicker, against the completeness of the Christmas night and its waning moon. He sat then in the snow, with no care for his plain robes or the cold, and withdrew his wand. "My name is Dantanian Noir," he recited to himself, instead of a spell. "My mother's name was Astarte Noir. She was a painter. She was perfect..."
It was annoying in a way. It had been kind of special for only Mother and Uncle Sirius to bear the mark of the talon wand.
"A wizard can fail to understand the charm. He can be too young or too magically weak to produce the needed force for the enchantment. Clearly, neither of those are your issue. He can be failing to use a strong enough memory of happiness. Often, this can be solved by imagining a memory rather than drawing on a past one. But in your case, I wonder if the issue is not the memory but your relationship to happiness itself... tell me, Draco, do you feel you
about me, like hell-"
"He was charming," Draco tried to excuse himself, since if nothing else Dumbledore had to remember that about the man. "And when I asked him if he regretted the things he did, fighting for wizard supremacy, he said he did." Damn it all, he found himself somehow Grindelwald's advocate, to the man Draco despised but Grindelwald must somehow have still loved, for the last word on his dying lips to have been Albus.
"Granger!" Draco gasped out, holding his stomach from laughing so hard it was beginning to hurt. "You- that's what this is? Bringing me out here?" The isolated location suddenly made sense. She had thought she was being considerate, letting him down gently where no one would have to witness his embarrassment. "You think I gave you that bracelet because I
"The Heir of Slytherin strikes again," Draco quipped, and watched Blaise fight back a smile that gave Vince and Greg permission to laugh at what they had all finally learned to take as a joke. Unfortunately, it made the second-years start whispering to each other,
It was an objectively terrible idea, given Draco's current capabilities at jewelry-making. But Draco heard himself saying, "Fine, let's discuss fees. I am not a
have any chance of moving me, you might as well save your-"
"I still owe you too," Potter said awkwardly. "I'll never not owe you..."
"You shouldn't have to! Dumbledore is asking too much-"
"Mistress Pansy!" Nissy exclaimed, before clamping a hand over her mouth and looking bashful. Wooky took her hand, and they solemnly bowed together, saying "Mistress Pansy, Mistress Pansy," in reverent tones that got the rest of the team's attention.
to protect Severus."
"Draco," Dumbledore said gently, taking him the shoulder and leading him around to their side of the desk. "It must not have escaped your attention that tomorrow is the day of the Second Task, of the Triwizard Tournament. You have been selected to be a part of this task."
Draco had been prepared to threaten Potter and Weasley with a Langlock curse of their own, should they use their own tongues to speak of him, let alone
"Oh, thank you, that's very helpful-"
"No, Aunt Bella deserves
myself to you, or something? But you've made it clear this year too, how much you hate having me around-"
Draco shrugged. "Yeah, it is. I don't happen to be, but it's a real thing. Even if people haven't heard of it, or like to put people in boxes, or claim they're indecisive or lying. It's real."
Ginny grinned despite her wariness. "That's it? That's all it takes?"
Potter was not at Madam Malkin's, nor at Flourish and Blotts. The trip there proved less eventful than last year's, save for Hermione and Ron's purchases of
"Harry or Remus," Sirius said, rolling his eyes, "Are not about to go swanning around in fancy pureblood jewelry the way you or your cousin might, now are they?" Draco wanted to object to that characterization, but since he was currently wearing his very expensive "Astaroth" necklace made of opal, it was a little more difficult. "They don't need it, and it's not like we're going to run out of money and need to sell it anytime soon. Take it, and use whatever you need to make Remus and I a pair of rings I can be proud to give him at Christmas."
"And I won't," Draco said, "Not yet."
"Oh, Luna," said Hermione, and hugged her tightly, looking distressed for her and overwhelmed with care. From Luna's baffled face, it was not the reaction she'd been expecting.
"Here, I popped the trunk, love!" a male voice called, and then a brown-haired Muggle man with a distinct resemblance to Hermione emerged from a door in the machine. "Hello, lad, it's a pleasure to meet you. We've heard all about you, Draco. I'm Wilford Granger." The Muggle extended a hand, which Draco shook with the best appearance of calm he could muster, while the machine-beast still had its jaws ready for him. Would it remain tame in the presence of its Muggle masters? He was starting to be reminded of the Hippogriff Buckbeak in third year, if there had been hundreds of Hippogriffs about. "Nice hoodie. Let me get this for you- oh, it's so light! Haven't you packed anything?" The Muggle kept speaking to him in this inexplicably friendly tone, although they'd only just become acquainted, but Hermione nudged him, so he replied.
could see it, and realize what a mistake he'd made adopting Draco Malfoy-
"Shouldn't you be more focused on your replacement Hogwarts than kicking me out of the real one?" Draco blurted, and saw from Remus's expression that he'd hit at the truth.
The first snag, though, was that Severus had no intention of allowing Draco to duel Potter. He pulled Draco right to Vince, who looked like his life began flashing before his eyes. Draco yelled out to Potter, "What do you say? Fancy a rematch?"
When he made protesting noises, Draco pouted at him. "Harry, don't you
family, Malfoy. Isn't your aunt Bellatrix Lestrange? You've got some relatives that would break the mirror-" He broke off when he saw Draco's face fall. "Er, sorry, I was joking too..."
"Don't say things like that," Luna said calmly, "You could jinx yourself," and Potter just rubbed at his scar, scowling.
"I now pronounce you married. You may kiss."
There was an eruption of consternation and disgust from the Death Eaters. But Draco didn't let their gazes part. And finally, Harry nodded. If he wouldn't have been convinced already, he had to feel the wand that had gone into his pocket. "Alright, Draco. For you."
Dobby walked up to Draco and Theo and the statue, with Nissy the house elf at his side. Draco's mouth opened and no sound came out. Again, he could have fallen to his knees, at the depth of the betrayal. But this time not his own.
, isn't it?" He sugarcoated what he was about to say by finally using Percy's name, as if he was too meaningless to be a proper subject of mockery anymore. "Yes, great man, Mr. Crouch, very on top of things, isn't he? And he has an assistant
a pretty spectacular present..."
- to, ah, help make Mr. and Mrs. Granger happier again..."
From the looks on their faces, that fact had failed to make it any funnier.
. He remembered that back turning after giving him his wand and walking away from him, the day he saw the mirror. Maybe some part of Draco had never forgiven Harry for the pity in his eyes then.
"Damn it, Draco, I thought something was wrong!" Harry yelled, with none of the happiness he had shown before dancing with Ginny still intact. "I thought you'd seen something and were going after your aunt or something! Don't just go off like that, you scared me to death-"
"And then she tried to tell Potter about Black," Draco interrupted, because that was the key information. That was the deviation from the blue loop that they had to bring to Severus's attention, not Draco's weakness.
"Well," Hermione said crisply. "There's never a better time than imminent mortal peril for research."
it had been Theo. The idea of Severus having to put the finishing touches on Sirius's engagement ring presentation did not bode well for Draco's longevity.
There had been the smallest part of himself, in that bleak June he turned 17 mere days after watching Dumbledore fall from the tower, bitter that the birthmark hadn't meant what it should and turned him to a dragon.
Hermione cleared her throat. "'Harry Potter's eyes brim with the ineradicable pain of the loss of his parents, a pain he fights back manfully to proclaim the shocking truth about their murderer...' oh, Harry, don't make that face, we knew what we were getting with Skeeter. And she knows her audience. This stuff works. Come on, just listen. 'The terrible blight upon wizardkind we all thought dead and gone has returned, and the young and brave hero Harry Potter, pride of the wizarding world, has come forward with his boyishly handsome face and haunted green eyes to tell the story of the terrible ordeal he suffered, fighting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named once more...'"
"What interests me most," said Dumbledore gently, "Is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Luna, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania."
"What? Why?" Harry asked, and looked between Draco and the figure in fear, but none of the freezing that Draco tended to have around danger. Even this far past midnight, he was still alert and ready to face any threat. Unless he handed his wand over, willingly.
"Stalwart honor," Hermione said, and the Fat Lady opened for them. "We can wait for him in the common room, he'll probably come right-"
"Sorry!" Harry ran back to get the talon wand. He shrunk back when Draco began to wave his wand and make a humming song over the cut, casting Vulnera Satentur. "What's that?"
"You weren't WHAT?" Hermione shrieked. "Was it Theodore Nott, do you think? But he isn't half as smart as you!"
"At least look at this play I drew up for our Chasers, then," Ron needled, and Draco was guilted into compliance.
Severus turned it over doubtfully in his palm, a simple pale blue canvas ball with the word Anodyne written on it. "A cure for all ills," he mused, and squeezed it upon instruction. It compressed slightly, and more so when he squeezed harder. "Ah. Thank you." He seemed genuinely almost speechless.
"Look at the potion for it, though," Theo said dryly, handing over the book. Its formidable weight barely registered, with the restless buzzing come alive under Draco's skin. "Time-consuming, rare and esoteric ingredients- expensive- and it's for an individual only. Easier to just rely on wards. And Dementors, of course..."
know the truth would bring nothing but more destruction upon him, and want to protect him, every instinct in his body telling him to get out of here, even if it meant running right out over that sheer drop-
When lightning began, Hooch called them down for a time-out. They were only ten points down, 40-30, but they had been up in the air longer than Draco realized, with night approaching fast. "You have to catch the Snitch!" Flint kept saying, actually shaking Draco at one point as if that would make it more likely, and then they played on.
?" Severus's sarcastic voice rose in intensity, leaning over to grip the arms of Draco's chair. "
Potter flushed and let the sword fall to his side. Draco wondered if he expected some kind of congratulations. He had no idea what to say. What could you ever say or do sufficient to requite what Potter had just done?
"Look at this place," Pansy marveled as they walked in, and it was true, between the elves and the third-years, everyone had outdone themselves in decking the room out. No need for the Room of Requirement at all. Everywhere you could see, there were either glitter-embossed silver feathers, or green, blue, silver, and gold balloons, with the piece de resistance courtesy of Neville, who'd decorated the whole long table with a display of Cobra Lilies, all hissing merrily to accompany the sight of Kingsnakes hoodies filing in.
"Oh, so Spain," said Gilderoy.
time I've been besieged by admirers on Valentine's Day..."
"Enough," said Periander. "Now finish it off."
Dinner proved an unqualified success, as both the food and the company were sublime. Harry was rather quiet, as he tended to be these days, but Frank and Alice seemed up to the challenge of being around so many people. Many tearful reunions followed, with McGonagall nearly losing her composure at the sight of her old students restored, and having to leave the room, while Dumbledore drew them aside for a quiet word alone before leading them back to the table. Frank and Alice knew Moody and Shacklebolt, fellow Aurors who greeted them with stoic but heartfelt amazement. The Longbottoms also seemed pleased to meet Tonks and Xenophilius Lovegood for the first time, who were similarly very positive towards them. Xenophilius was not so sanguine with Draco, whom he seemed to regard as having virtually kidnapped his daughter to place her in danger, but you couldn't have everything.
"Don't worry," Draco told him placidly, and could not resist the urge to press his face into Potter's shoulder for just a moment, leaving it there before pulling it away in a nonsensical form of reassurance. "If Black's been playing me this whole time and he really is guilty, I'll kill him before you have the chance."
There was stunned silence before Mrs. Granger rallied. "Where do you teach now, Remus?"
"But what if I freak out?" she breathed, immediately reverting to doubt. "What if all I can do is think of Tom?"
Periander hadn't seemed the Crucio kind, not that Draco had known him well before he 'died'. It seemed Draco's trick with the Sordespiro ritual had not been popular with the undead crowd.
That made Draco stop walking. "Are you not trying out? If it's just your father making you-"
could."
Father barked out a chilling laugh that made it harder to remember the man he had been in Azkaban. "Of course. Not a drop of it. That does not surprise me. What does, Draco, is why in Salazar's name you would protect a house elf." He circled like a hawk homing closer to its prey. "Do you think it will be worse for you, to admit that you used one of our elves- of all the lowest tricks and creatures you could have used, to defy my orders and profane a property I was personally charged with safekeeping-" Father seemed to have lost track of his sentence. "Do you think it will be worse than continuing to lie so brazenly to my face?"
He didn't know the words for Dantanian Noir. He had thought those anomalous words just a designation for mysterious castle-builder Dantanian Black, or else a code for a person possessed by pure and unadulterated evil. The man whose memories Severus had gone to so much trouble to hide from Draco, he seemed to be something else entirely. Which was in its own way more frightening. But Draco would be damned if he would show it hurt him. Whether or not Severus had been in any way right to keep this from him, Draco would
Then Draco could hear Lupin's pleasant voice talking about the awful weather tonight with Hagrid, and some made-up dark creature that could be at fault... Bushwinder eggs really were needed to counteract it... well, if Severus wasn't interested in helping, Lupin would have to deal with it himself, and could Hagrid go back to the dungeons and bring Lupin those eggs after all?
"So you want me to win?" Harry asked shyly, ducking his head as if this was some great gift.
"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Potter, Granger, and Draco covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. "Mummy will never forget you!"
"Yes," Ron said bravely, and threw out the story of his humiliation without a second thought. "Professor Lupin cast a spell on Scabbers and made him turn into his real self. It was crazy. He was this disgusting little man with a missing finger. Just like Scabbers's missing toe."
"'Get it over with'? Like some ordeal? Would you rather have gotten caught with Neville?"
With a vicious, unrecognizable look on his own face, Draco's old self yelled out, "Sectumsempra!"
"I thought I wanted to be like you there too. But it's what

"Accio dagger!"
"No, I didn't," Luna said, blinking guilelessly, "But Draco didn't either, we all saw him not do it, didn't we?" The five of them nodded together, Ron waving his arms in enthusiastic agreement. "So I might as well be arrested with him, since he's no more guilty than I am. And he
"You know what I did, right?" Draco snorted. "I mean, what I really did? In that graveyard?"
Draco had expected possessiveness and remonstration, rebuke at not answering his letters, however 'sick'. But where Harry placed the blame became immediately clear, mouth forming words against Draco's neck, where his face had nosed aside Draco's hair. "It's my fault, isn't it? Whatever I did, I'm sorry. You were upset at the graveyard, you thought your godfather was going to die, and you got angry at me- was I too slow to understand? Did it not seem I was taking it seriously? Or did you think I would be
If Theo would let him. The debt claimed with that dagger was still waiting to be paid...
"Mount your brooms," said Hooch, and it was an effort just to find a secure seat on his Nimbus 2001, so considerable a river seemed to be running over every solid surface, charms or not. Last year's storm had been child's play compared to this one, to the point that Draco worried that the impending presence of Dementors was having some effect already. But he managed to get on, Hooch's whistle sounded, and then they were off.

When he arrived, he had little trouble finding Ron and Hermione, with them sitting with all the other Weasleys and their bright red hair. He yelled over for Luna until she heard and joined them, only to sigh when she realized she'd been summoned so Draco could grip her hand for dear life.
"No!" Draco said hastily. "No! No GIFT-GIVING!" After Gilderoy didn't get progressively more overt hints, Draco was eventually forced to outright tell him, he knew Gilderoy had been the one to give Severus the golden roses and note, asking for a rendezvous back in his time at Hogwarts. And that, in no uncertain terms, Draco did not think it the best idea in the world to attempt either of those actions again. Especially the second.
"In... in what? In what have I pleased you, my lord?"
And it was. They had the joy of the sight of a man otherwise floundering put back thoroughly in his element. What Protego Diabolica had purportedly been to Grindelwald, Obliviate was to Gilderoy Lockhart. He was an artist with it, casting slowly and carefully with pinpoint precision, and causing no pain or surprise or discomfort.
"Tell her
, when there's a creature as exquisite and perfect as Cedric Diggory out there existing in the world?"
"They have Harry, he's at the Department of Mysteries," Draco said, and explained as quickly as he could.
"We've been looking for you since dinner, Draco," Potter called back, with what sounded like real concern, and if Draco got one hint of what could turn out to be pity- "We checked everywhere else and couldn't find you-"
That was a complete lie.
If they wanted to talk after that, they had to whisper. After years of enchanting his curtains to isolate himself from his yearmates, it was an especially disconcerting experience to have so many people about, and yet be expected to sleep. He took a calming draught from his bag, and gave Hermione one when asked, though he refused Ron and Potter. Then it was back to trying to negotiate the shared space between his feet and Potter's excessive hair. Draco finally curled up on his side completely, scooping up higher to rest his face near Hermione's, and begin to whisper to her asking what theories she might have about why Halloween always seemed to go wrong at Hogwarts.
Remus visited Draco every day for the rest of break, something more purposeful in the quiet shows of concern now. It was like his belief in his guardianship of Draco had solidified, if only out of pity. Sirius came by the next day, and attempted the most awkward conversation of Draco's life. He tried to talk about the abuse he had suffered in this very house, at the same ages as Draco, until they were both sweating, pale, and more than happy to promise the other to leave this sort of thing to Remus in the future. And neither said a word to the students, as Ron visited the next day without any pity on his face, and indeed a positive glow of admiration.
It was a grim goodbye with Professor Lupin as the year ended, as it also ended his time as Hogwarts professor. Draco's influence had made Lupin's disgrace that of Sirius's accomplice, not a public exposure as a werewolf. He wondered which one would have been preferable to the man, and decided it would be imprudent to ask. Might give the wrong idea, like he was contemplating exposing him or something. Which he had strictly forbidden his godfather from doing, on pain of being disowned as a godfather.
The black of a massive motionless black dog, as huge as the one Draco had seen on the streets outside Grimmauld Place, like the grim from the sheets for Trelawney's tasseography readings: alone at the top of the stands, with the lightning fading more slowly where it hung around the aura of the dog, the halo seeming instead to turn dark...
It evaporated in the sixth-year boys' dorm, where all five other boys sat together, on a fuzzy white fur rug in front of the unlit fireplace. They were perched whispering fretfully. Draco didn't think it would be paranoia or narcissism to assume at least some of those whispers were about him.
Draco bit his lip, not liking that construction. "I was working on the spell before. This just gave me the chance to test it. I mean, Luna volunteered, but I wasn't about to risk

Dobby flinched. "She and Wooky is kind to Dobby today. But they is never wanting to be seen in public with Dobby. Never."
about him."
Potter led them past the giant snake skin bravely, though Ron kept sneaking glances back at it like he expected it to come to life at any moment. Draco stayed quiet in the tunnel as they went through a great length of wet black walls and bends and shadows, though it just made him more anxious. He would look sometimes down at the distinctive bend of his wand to calm himself, sometimes over at Potter's determined heroic face, and sometimes even at Ron on Potter's other side, who looked somehow even more terrified than Draco felt, and yet whose feet seemed to be having no trouble moving themselves forward.

"I am loyal to Death Eaters," Draco said, the answer forced out of him. "I am loyal to you, my lord. I follow your orders."
Rounding the corner with their wands already raised were Crabbe, Goyle, Avery, Rookwood, Greyback-
Forgiven, at least, if not entirely forgotten. Theo, for one,

"I'll get the headmaster," Luna said, and stopped at the door. "Draco, please don't kill him," she said a last time, before running out as fast as her legs could carry her.
