He just needs to get Potter out of his system. That’s all. Because it’s just the nakedness, and therefore a temporary, fleeting...thing. It would pass.
Harry glances over at the nook, idly touching his earlobe. Malfoy isn’t making a peep but Harry can hear rustling sounds. What is he doing in there? Is he just trying stuff on? Seeing how he looks in Harry’s clothes? And Malfoy will have taken his shirt off. Could be shirtless
He only hesitated for a second, but that was all she needed. Luna’s eyes narrowed immediately. Draco couldn’t stop himself from shooting a worried glance at Potter, who had sat back to watch their interaction. And he was still smiling, the gorgeous wanker.
Ivy poses a theory a few days later as she chooses photos for her exhibition. Draco is sitting next to her in an attempt to offer critical feedback, but the reality of the situation is that he’s actually just muttering into an overpriced takeaway coffee about the oddness of the Potter situation.
[11:58] There’s great time travel film called Primer where they have to lie down in a wooden box thing
First year. Detention in the Forbidden Forest. He’d thought scaring Longbottom would be enough to call it off and do something else - literally
Draco chooses an empty window booth and makes a big show of getting his notebook out as well as a muggle pen as a way of setting the tone for the afternoon.
on the frosted glass. On the other side he can make out blurry burgundy shapes, and a more defined dark blue one that he knows is Esther. She’s not saying anything as the other two shapes shout at each other.
Draco decided he should probably say something, it seemed like the right sort of time after all. But he kept getting distracted by the pad of Harry’s thumb against his skin and the fact that he smelled like chocolate and bonfires so he thought
“It’s closed. The ovens are broken. Or the water’s off. I don’t know.” She shrugs. “You’ll have to go
Not about Cedric, because that was ‘just unfortunate’ - he’d heard one of the sixth years say it, and then suddenly others were saying it too. It was an
The peaches continue to show up in the canteen and Harry continues to vanish them. Still, Malfoy always finds a way of getting one. One time Harry even went into the kitchens to get rid of them at the source, under the pretence of wanting to thank the hardworking staff, and was promptly kicked out by the very same wizard who was fawning all over Malfoy a few days before.
Harry watches his friend search the cafeteria, as if this imaginary not-a-Potter-fan will pop up out of the ground from Ron’s sheer force of will. This enables Harry to get another good look at Malfoy, sitting alone, eating a peach and turning the page of his book. How he’s able to eat it so perfectly Harry doesn’t know, and feels his brows knit together with irritation as he watches Malfoy take another delicate bite. Harry’s peach was too ripe, too sweet, the juice dripping messily down his chin before he gave up and handed it over to Ron.
Harry frowned and then, rather incongruously, huffed out a small laugh. “Um, I don’t think you understa–“
“You look so - it looks good. On you.” Harry can’t stop staring at Malfoy’s reflection. “You look good. Very, uh - Presentable.”
. Is Ron still here? He can’t see this, he’ll nick it. He said he was going to try and get Kettering off my back about doing paperwork for a few days. Is that - how many layers is this cake?” Potter digs a fork in and takes a bite, sighs a little around the mouthful, pulls it possessively closer. “Jesus Fuck. If you see him coming you’ll have to hex him. I am
He nodded, clearing his throat, grateful not to be thinking about Potter’s tongue anymore (well, he was. But just...a bit less).
“I’ve got to go,” he says quickly, more to his now mostly empty plate – thanks to Ron – than his friends.
Harry’s hands reach out of their own volition and start rubbing slowly at Malfoy’s cheeks, squeezing and massaging, his thumbs working their way inwards to spread them slightly apart.
“What is the most rewarding aspect of being an Auror?” Potter asks, when the waitress has left them alone.
He’s been a right useless prick today and all, wanted to be on ‘supervisory duties’ so as not to ‘aggravate’ his injury from Saturday courtesy of your man
. This is how Draco justifies it to himself as he brings himself off once - sometimes twice - a day imagining that beautiful cock and who it’s attached to.
…and that’s that folks! I toyed with the idea of ending this fic on the previous chapter, as it did feel like a good end to this fluffy piece. But I had some notes I wanted to include, some loose ends to tie up…and maybe a hint of a sequel? Watch this space!
The lunch rush at Galen’s is starting to die down when they arrive and Draco holds the door open for Potter, who has donned a buttery-soft looking leather jacket over a dark green shirt.
form-fitting midnight blue robes with a fine brocade woven in that you’d miss if you weren’t looking.
[19:26] I refuse to take criticism from a person who is rude enough to ignore their date in favour of texting a stranger
So if Harry found himself looking forward to those training sessions that Malfoy came along to, or found excuses to visit Malfoy in his laboratory, or just so happened to have lunch at the same time as Malfoy, then that was Harry’s business.
, thinks Draco, already feeling himself blush and smile and fuck, he’s fairly certain his traitorous eyelashes just
It was lit up on the inside, emitting a warm and cosy glow onto the darkened streets. Draco was also quite relieved to see it looking relatively empty for a late Friday afternoon. Maybe he wouldn’t head back to school straight away; maybe he would stay and sit for a little while, read one of the many old tattered books left behind by other customers. He definitely wouldn’t re-read (for the umpteenth time) any of the –
Draco watched as Harry walked across the tile and thumped into some kind of invisible barrier on the far side. But otherwise, nothing.
“I don’t think you need to worry about the attraction being one sided,” he said, brushing his lips against Harry’s, which sent sparks of pleasure along his spine.
. “I always thought it was your destiny, too. I occasionally felt pity over the way Admiral Dumbledore took your unwavering courage and groomed you to be Starfleet’s sacrificial lamb.”
Harry wasn’t an idiot. He knows exactly when he’s done something that will cause nothing but shit. But knowing has never stopped him. “That’s technically not a no.”
“I’m not sure yet,” Harry said. “It’s just, how close are those odds to the odds of a purple kneazle being born? Or a Pygmy troll? Or this two-headed peacock? They’re all possible, but really improbable, right? And yet we keep running into them.”
Draco’s cold fingers were still around his wrist, jaw slacked, eyes wide. “You just proposed to me.”
Harry sighed. In another version of this whole cock-up, Harry gets away with playing it off as a joke, so that he has a better chance, a real chance to tell Draco the way Draco deserved to be told. Instead, he says, “Yeah. I really do love you.”
territory on less than twenty-four hour’s notice. Harry and Draco had dealt with much worse in the past, both together and individually, both as partners and before they were even adults. Harry and Draco were the best Auror team in the Ministry, and a small detour from inside the plane to outside wouldn’t stop them.
“I’m not going to let you saddle yourself with the black mark of being with a Death Eater,” Draco swallowed. He wanted to snarl, to snap, not sputter. “It’d stay with you forever, long after you’re done with me.”
Here, high above the whole world, in the wind and the sun and the ferocity of battle, Draco was the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. Harry wasn’t a dragon, wasn’t good enough for the elegance of Draco, and he really wished he could tell Draco without Draco just punting him right off the wing of the plane. But he could watch, as Draco dodges and disarms and detains. Harry could feel it surging in his veins, the adrenaline probably, pounding through his heart and making his fingers tingle.
Draco sighed. “Between you and me? No, I have no idea. But if this works, we’re telling everyone I had absolute confidence.”
The next morning was another morning of gently shifting around each other in the kitchen as they made tea, after they had carefully skirted each other in the bathroom, making even less eye contact through the shower steam. Only a dozen letters came through the post that morning, and only ten of those were from concerned fans, angry fans, or inquisitive reporters.
“Okay,” Harry nodded. “If we can’t roll again until we step on the orange tile, then I’ll just step on it. And you’ll get us a new roll
He sighed and glanced over at the bed beside his. Draco lay motionless between starched sheets, looking almost angelic in the light filtering in through the curtains. Harry had never seen him this peaceful. It was a good look on him, even if Harry missed his wit and sarcasm.
Malfoy stood waiting for Harry to recover, unimpressed, slick arms folded across his bare chest. Lithe as he was, Harry could still barely see the lines of any bones under his skin; Malfoy was all taut, corded muscle, coiled like a spring around a long, lean frame. “I figured I would stop fighting fair when you gave the command to lock the Holodeck doors,” he said. “I bet there’s even an order that absolutely no recordings be made of what happens here today.”
that’d make you think you weren’t good enough for me. But I did. Even though you’re smart, and generous, and damn funny, and I’m sorry. Because I think I love you too, and I think I ought to be doing whatever I can to deserve your love for me. Starting, probably, with telling every news outlet I can about how I’ll be with you as long as you’ll have me. And that they can fuck right off if they don’t like it.”
And so Harry had to wait, rolling his eyes, while the requisition witch wrote down her Floo address on every one of Draco’s return slips.
Draco was right. At school they had always had strong feelings toward each other if not of an affectionate nature. But growing up and getting a second chance after the trials, Harry had seen Draco make amends for his role in the war and for his old beliefs. It had happened on more than one occasion, after dinners at Andromeda and Teddy’s, that he and Draco found themselves at a local pub, talking long into the night, well after Andromeda had had to shoo them out.
They get to the Floo, Potter with his arm slung across Draco’s shoulders and Draco supporting him around his waist (
“No that’s–” Draco shook his head, feeling as if he’d gotten lost somewhere in their conversation, that somehow things had gotten turned around or backwards or—did Harry not

It makes him feel a bit uneasy and Draco has the brief thought of buying Potter a plant, a photo frame, maybe his own fucking
Harry strokes it back with affection. “You’re so fucking beautiful. I could come just looking at you.”
It doesn’t take long to get to Malfoy’s bedroom. Seconds maybe, Harry isn’t sure. It’s entirely possible they apparated. The room is cast in the warm glow of a bedside lamp. The bed is huge and pleasingly solid-looking with more pillows than one person needs.
“What about me?” Harry watches as Malfoy walks towards him, gestures to the nearest box and blinks innocently at him.
I am absolutely floored by the love this little fic has gotten 🖤 thanks so much for the reads, the comments and the kudos! You’re all so lovely 😊
Draco was pretty certain he had swallowed the remainder of the sugar cube whole as he came to the sudden and abrupt realisation that he was well and truly fucked.
- but no. That useless lumbering oaf Hagrid had stuck him with Potter instead and sent them on their merry way with his equally useless dog.
Alright fine, that was certainly true enough. Draco, in perhaps a slightly melodramatic fashion, had once even referred to Harry as his
Harry’s so caught up in his thoughts that he doesn’t immediately register what’s happened and has, in fact, carried on walking. When he spins on his heel he sees Ron looking almost as red as his hair, and Malfoy’s shirt is soaked through.
Harry was in the middle of saying, “Hey, do you think that —” when there was a pop, and a bit of parchment fluttered into Draco’s hands.
There was a rattle, and the die tipped and bounced around them, over and under the tiled path and back again. When it stopped, only the upward-facing side lit up: Four.
“I dropped out to protect my mother,” Malfoy said softly. A quick suck at Harry’s cock again, and then: “I was worried Voldemort would kill her if I didn’t show how loyal I was. He did anyway, though.”
Potter was sitting on the counter by the sinks, kicking his scuffed shoes, examining the mould on the ceiling, singing. He more or less had the tune, but seemed to have no idea what all the words were, and so would mumble-hum every few bars until he got to a snatch he remembered again. He sang with gusto, though, letting the acoustics of the bathroom reverberate his voice in winding, off-key echoes.
Malfoy walked up to the Holodeck entrance and rapped on the metal, pausing as it slid open. “So now, both of us are an entire lifetime away from the bastard of a man who defined everything we were supposed to be,” he said. “I guess this is probably as good a time as any to figure out who we want to be during that lifetime.”
They both knew it wasn’t. The point had been for Harry to make clear that, as Security Officer, he wouldn’t let someone like Malfoy threaten his ship. The point was to make it clear to Malfoy that he would do whatever it’d take to protect his people. The
The theories were, unsurprisingly, ridiculous: Draco was clearly holding Harry hostage in his own home. Or perhaps Harry needed a Black blood relative as a willing sacrifice to stop Wallaburga’s curse on wizardkind. Or maybe it was a conspiracy, involving frequent visits from both Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley, to go back in time and stop the war before it began by using a former Death Eater’s insider knowledge.
“You know, in Punjabi, my full name means dragon, too,” Jag would say. “They’re prestigious. Around the world, any culture that has dragons reveres them. Knows that dragons are a kind of magic above the rest of the standard breed. Like you and I.”
you’re stuck with here. Your only hope when we get out of here is to tell everyone I’ve tricked you with my Death Eater ways into keeping me company. Or just use your favourite line when people see us: it’s a coincidence! We just ran into each other!”
“Yes, of course we did, they’re your favorite.” Draco said waving a hand in Harry’s direction as he flipped to the next page.
Harry looked over. “Maybe I like your ‘interesting company’. Maybe I don’t really care anymore if my reputation is ruined.”
He trailed off, because it was too late. The invisibility cloak was off, and Draco stood there, clutching it in his hand as he stared at what was underneath.
“Come on, let’s get on the brooms,” Draco said. “When we get to Montreal, we’ll go to dinner and I’ll teach you how to properly woo someone, since you can’t manage it yourself.” He looked over his shoulder and winked at Harry as the whole world stretched out before them. Draco’s grin was crinkling his face, and his hair flopped over his eye, more beautiful than any duel, any dragon. “Race you?”
“You know what,” Draco said, resting his forehead against Harry’s, “I actually have something to do before we complete the bond terminally. I have a letter to compose.”
The ropes that lashed out around the Collector were like the ropes of a standard Incarcerous, but made of branches and and silver and bright red berries. They looked thin and fragile, yet the moment they wrapped around the Collector, their oddly-jointed limbs recoiled and thrashed, yanked into uncomfortable constraints. Harry sucked in a breath past the ichor in his throat and tried to smile. Of course Draco would find strange and rare spells for binding Fae-adjacent creatures.
The truth was, he had been really scared when Draco had passed out like that. Initially because, well, it wasn’t every day someone went out cold like that in front of him. But when Draco hadn’t woken up, Harry had started to panic and called the nurses. Everyone had rushed in, apparently under the impression that Harry was the one in need of help and had been puzzled to find Draco sprawled out on the floor.
enemies. You —” he gasped, as Malfoy slid, slow, back onto Harry, curling his tongue through the precome at the slit. “Your family were Maquis loyalists. You dropped out to join —”
they gave him a window. It was where all the other trainees would gather whenever they wanted to avoid doing their paperwork, collecting doodled artwork and flowers and
“I can see it now,” Draco said. The corners of his mouth were twitching now, more upward than downward, and he didn’t even want to stop them. “The tales would spread far and wide. The Boy Who Lived To Wail Paperwork Into Submission.”
As he passed by them, his mother was fuming, her sense of decorum the only thing keeping her from causing a scene. But when he looked at his father, he was surprised to see what looked like respect in his eyes.
“Oh right,” Harry said, feeling his own cheeks grow hot. “Well, my theory is that it has something to do with the object I touched before my blackout. I’ve extracted the memory of that like I said I would and saved it in a flask.”
was out of his wand before Draco was really aware of it, and Harry floated up and out of danger, settled safely on the other side before Draco could pull a new breath of air into his lungs.
“Correct, but this was poorly made. Soul Beacons are very old, very complicated magic even experts in soulbonding aren’t even sure how some of these things work. From what I can see in the memory, a lot of the runes are slightly off or in some cases poorly translated. Like here, the rune for “draw” was mistaken with “tie”. Tie can mean “to come in even in a competition”. In that sense draw and tie do mean the same thing, however, tie can also mean to connect or link, so can bond.”
And then Malfoy found his prostate, and Harry cried out, shameless and loud. He watched as Malfoy pulled off, grinning viciously in triumph.
“Or we would have finished off Voldemort by third year and finished our schooling in peace,” Harry said. He paused. “Would your mother still be trying to marry you off to Astoria if we had been bonded?”
“I mean, I’d like to do all those things,” Harry said, then frowned at Draco’s stunned expression. “I can also… not do those things, if you’re not, er, interested.”
“That was not nearly enough cheering, you miserable excuse for a partner.” Draco left the bundled-up smugglers and came over to undo Harry’s body bind. But the smile was there, tugging up the edges of Draco’s stern lips, and Harry was forgiven.
“The Ministry can only book a flight back for Monday, so whoever takes the case gets an extra two days in Montreal.”
Healer Stamford left, and Harry turned to Draco, “Well, I suppose that means we need to figure out where we’re headed. Hogwarts is out of the question obviously.... Do you...er... have a flat? Or I still have a home in London, 12 Grimmauld Place.” Harry squirmed in his seat.
“No!” Harry grabbed for the book, flushed and flustered. “Alright, fine. I read them for the trashy bits. I like reading about posh blond snobs falling for boorish commoners. And that bit at the end, with the love confessions and happily ever afters, that’s
But Draco decided that he didn’t want that. Not in this moment, in the middle of the night in an old bathroom with echoing pipes. He didn’t want to be the rival, or the antagonist, or the one who never got invited to pub nights.
“Had many offers to go there from the witches and wizards passing through your office?” Draco asked in return. “Or is it you offering to show them around the chambers?”
“What?” Draco said looking up from the clipboard and over at the staging tables the servers had loaded with food.
“It’s those untedious ones you send invitations to, then?” Harry asked. “Or are they the ones you kidnap?”
’d her before she could try again. “You’re just going to leave me to do all the work, then?” he sighed.
“Hmm?” Harry said, half turning. Draco’s fingers always broke his concentration, but this time, the concentration broke just as Weasley’s card snapped a sharp numbing shock into Harry’s palm.
“How…” Harry swallowed, tried sucking in air once again. “How do you even send it? Do the Fae use owls these days?”
Suddenly a rustle of blankets made Harry look up from his lunch. Draco was stirring, grey eyes blinking up at Harry.
“You… what?” Harry asked, dazed, disoriented at how Malfoy’s tongue tipped back into his slit and curled around the head to tuck under — just a bit — the foreskin. “He threatened your mother? I thought…”
even without his wand, and so he shouted out their words even as the air was whipped out of his mouth. That done, he let Draco handle the rest as he worked his way up to a sitting position and just watched.
They spent their mornings dancing around each other in the bathroom while they took turns showering, following Hogwarts dorm etiquette and averting their gaze, though Harry’s eyes always drifted to the pale skin and toned muscles that peeked out from Draco’s towel. No matter how often he corrected himself and desperately tried to focus on his toothbrush, Harry found himself lingering on the sight of Draco’s collar bones.
What he would always remember, every single day of this possibly endless journey across the stars, was the way Malfoy’s hand felt as it slipped past the waistline of his kisbet and then down. How Malfoy’s fingers, slender and slick, skimmed past the curve of his arse and even further, pressing their bodies so close that Harry could place Malfoy’s every scar by touch alone.
“Finally!” Ron exclaimed, Luna and Ginny nodding vehemently, while Fred and George could be seen behind them, exchanging money; meanwhile, Hermione put Teddy back down so the boy could rush back to them.
“Harry, darling, will you please sit?” Andromeda begged softly, reaching for him when he passed her for the umpteenth time. “You’ll wear a hole in the ground and, to be quite frank, you’re driving me batty.”
In his excitement, Teddy let his hair morph into dark strands that matched Harry’s while listing all the flavours he wanted to eat.
“Yeah, buddy,” Harry replied, smiling wide through his tears as he took Teddy from Andromeda’s arms. “We’ll do that. And we’ll buy you a big ice cream on the way, for being such a good boy.”
Walking along the corridor of the Ministry, he tried remembering the last time he had been this nervous but he honestly couldn’t find any instance. Maybe the final battle with Tom came close but… well. That had been something he’d been working towards for years, his whole life really, instead of mere weeks. He was rather sure he’d been more resolved than nervous in the end.
Nodding at her, she nodded back before they rose as one and entered the room of the Wizengamot. Followed first by the other party, then the listeners. As they sat down, Harry couldn’t help but let his gaze wander over to the other table, the other party. When he saw only two familiar faces, he frowned – until he remembered. The third one wasn’t here as a plaintiff. No.
There had been moments between them… moments Harry could hardly believe had been real now that the other was ready to testify against him. Ready to give a testimony that might not lead to Harry losing this case – but that would surely break his heart.
Harry nodded but didn’t look down the corridor towards where his friends sat, waiting patiently. Some of them were here mainly to lend their support, some were the witnesses needed for this process and Harry couldn’t bear looking at any of their reassuring faces right now. And he sure as hell wouldn’t look in the other direction. The direction where
“Draco Malfoy,” the Wizengamot began after running through all the formalities. “What would you like to say in regards to your father claiming custody over Edward Lupin?”
Out of the blue, Draco’s gaze hardened as he let it wander to where his father sat. “No, I’m sure Teddy knew no sorrow – until my father stepped into his life and made it so he was ripped from his loving family. Even if only temporary. It still shows that he doesn’t have the boy’s best interest at heart, but what to gain from this little farce. For nothing more than a farce it can be. You want my opinion? No one in their right mind would rip Teddy away from such a loving and caring household to have him live with a man who does this for a reason not even
Still. Everyone Harry knew had assured him that there was no way this man could win a case against the godfather, who was the Saviour of the Wizarding world himself, and against the grandmother of the child. Harry may have hated being called the Saviour – however, if it would bring him but one ounce of an advantage in this case, he would forever wear that name with honour.
Everything after that was a blur, really. All Harry could think about was that they had won – and trying to find Draco and kiss him for what he had just done. His testimony was enough reason for the Wizengamot to cut the case short, voting unanimously that Teddy was to stay with Andromeda and Harry – both now officially his legal guardians at last.
Following the small tug of her hand, he sat down next to her. Her hand continued to hold his, gripping it rather tightly.
His first good breath of the day was almost stolen from him as the name of the first witness rang through the room.
“Narcissa?” The question came from Andromeda who had stopped right next to Harry, making their presence known.
Too late Harry realized there were tears in his eyes and they silently fell, Harry not daring to look away from Draco to dry his eyes. There was another pause, one Draco used to still fully, intentionally look at him before letting his gaze wander to his aunt.
But as soon as the verdict was spoken and the case closed, Draco slipped from the room, following his parents in their swift exit. Harry watched him leave, eyes glued to his back as he found himself in Andromeda’s arms; he wanted to hasten after him, talk to him, thank him – but there were other things that came first. The rest of their friends were let in, no longer needed as witnesses, and once they heard the why, a general buzzing of excitement broke loose. It came to a crescendo the moment Teddy was accompanied into the room. Letting go of the court officer’s hand, he ran towards them at full speed right into Andromeda’s arms. He was peppered with kisses that made him giggle and while they all hugged him close he told them how nice the two weeks at the ‘camp’ had been but that he really missed them and wanted to go home now.
Draco looked up from the notes and books Sam Jordan had provided him and Hermione with. Sam looked down at her feet, tears forming in her eyes.
Harry and Draco were seated in their shared hospital room sitting across from each other at a small table covered with the books and notes Draco had been poring over.
Two decades ago, the Maquis were a different kind of rebel force. The kind that, historically, had the sort of ideals Harry might even agree with, or willingly make an alliance with while stranded in the Delta Quadrant. But two decades ago, Admiral Voldemort took over the Maquis.
“Oh, I’m sure,” Draco said. “This one here looks well-read, and it’s bookmarked at chapter fourteen. Is that one of the plotty bits? I’ll just read it and check —”
“Not if I can help it,” Draco said. He turned to Harry. “If it’s all right with you, I’m taking you home.”
.” Draco stared at Harry, aghast. “Pull your stupid, self-sacrificing Gryffindor head out of your arse immediately.”
“It would have been a safer bond, yes,” Draco said softly. “Better. No need for some specific act to seal the bond or the enforced proximity. But then I would have been used as a weapon to make sure you were killed before the war even started.”
A collective groan sounded through the classroom. “Yes, well, life is hard, get over it.” Harry chuckled, remembering those days of essay writing and desperately trying to write bigger to reach the parchment length faster.
Draco knew what his mission was. It was dangerous, and might lead to something that couldn’t be unseen, but it had to be done.
“You found a space with brooms,” Draco said with a laugh. His eyes were disgusting, and he had spilled some whiskey on his pants, but Harry was
“Merlin, I love the sound of that. As to my tongue, I’m sure I can think of more creative things to do with it.”
And so he said, “A voice like yours could never stay a secret. Especially not if you keep planning on blasting it through these poor belaboured pipes.”
Potter blinked, and looked over at the door where Draco was standing. “Malfoy! I didn’t realize you were here. It’s the middle of the night on a Friday. I thought I was the only one around.”
like that, glistening and pale, long lashes brushing the soft blush of his cheeks. He was sinful like that, a breath away from the fabric of Harry’s kisbet, chin tilted with a confidence that burned against the significance of the position he was in.
. Everyone always thought it was your destiny to stop Voldemort,” Malfoy said, dragging the tip of his finger against the nub of Harry’s prostate, over and over again until the electric crackle of it made Harry want to
. I’ve had these books since I was fourteen, and I reckon I’ll be reading these into my old age. Happy?”
Draco smiled, “Ok, well, now it’s different, when you lost your balance, the worst that would have happened would have been maybe you’d have slid off the bed a bit. You weren’t in any danger, I did it to steady you, just to be helpful. It was different.”
“Thank you, Minerva,” Harry mumbled. “And does the bond—?” He turned to Hermione, avoiding eye contact with Draco. “Will the bond be affected if the attraction is only one sided?”
“That child has a very endearingly good ear for gossip. Andromeda taught him well,” Draco said, but he was only half paying attention to the conversation now. He was frowning at the read-outs. He double-checked Harry’s file, then wiped the monitoring spells and cast a fresh set, but the numbers were exactly the same. “Your vitals are peculiarly strong.”
the trashy things that happen between your blond snobs and boorish commoners. Imagine the inspiration we’d have gotten!”
“Wait,” Draco ran his fingers up Harry’s jaw, pulling him around for a kiss. He meant for it to be deep and dirty, but it was somehow still chaste for all its aggressiveness. “Do
Draco and Harry exchanged a look. “Seems simple enough,” Harry shrugged. “Worryingly cryptic, but simple enough. How do we roll the dice?”
“Harry,” he said. “I appreciate that you’re alive and I respect that you’re probably incredibly uncomfortable right now, but if you do that again, I will
“Hey,” Harry said. “You don’t suppose this is some kind of trick, right? A whole path full of orange tiles.”
“It absolutely is, and I guarantee I’m a better singer than you,” Draco agreed. “Mind, a kneazle is a better singer than you, so that’s barely a boast.”
“I mean, you said that, but I thought you were in a snit,” Harry said. “Are you serious? Why wouldn’t we go?”
Harry looked down at his food tray. Shepherd’s pie and pumpkin juice with treacle tart for dessert. It would have been appealing if he hadn’t had some variation of this dish for three days now.
Later, Draco would claim that it was his Healer instinct that pushed him to reach for Harry, an instinct he’d have for any patient in need of help. Deep within him, though, burned the absolute knowledge that Draco’s body moved because it was
“Not even remotely,” Draco said, crumpling the note from his mother in his hand. It was the fourth one he’d gotten this week. He could practically recite them by now.
Goosebumps immediately covered his thighs as the air touched the exposed skin. His cock was already dripping precome, the pearly line of it stretching down from the rigid tip to hang past Malfoy’s chin. The situation was intoxicating, in a way Harry wasn’t able to put words to, and the heady mix of power and deferral and redefined boundaries made his head feel full of gossamer and sparklers.
“You are.” Slowly, Harry reached out and gently stroked the back of Draco’s hand. “I can’t believe I never saw it before.”
And with that, Malfoy sank down with the grace of a falling feather, his back straight and his lips still tilted into a cocksure smirk.
In a series of bright colours that defied both pattern and reasonable aesthetics, the line of square tiles stretched out in front of them, marching into the grey. Each the size of a small table, they made a gaudy path that swerved and twisted and looped far beneath them before swinging up in an arc over their heads and meandering off again.
“Do you think,” Harry said that night, into the dark. “That I was supposed to shake your hand, back when we were eleven? And that’s what our mark’s about?”
“But this doesn’t complete the bond, it’s not at sunset by the Great Lake,” Harry whispered, eyes closed.
As Draco lay panting and satiated in Harry’s arms, the magic of their bond tingling around them, he smiled.
It was Draco who explicitly told Harry that baiting the Collector would be the most imbecillic decision of his soon-to-be-shortened career.
“I got us a reservation,” Harry said, a peace offering. “At that place in Montreal with that chef you like.”
Which is how Harry got to press his nose to the cold airplane window and feel the push against his chest as the plane took off. How he got to feel Draco’s bony fingers clutch at his knee while the engine roared in acceleration. Sense Draco’s shoulders tense as they crushed up against his own. Study Draco’s lips as they twitched in curiosity at ads in the airplane magazines. Hear Draco’s voice roll and lilt through an entire French conversation with a flight attendant.
“Basically. No fighting, no bitterness, and a bond that happens properly, instead of this mess created by that blasted beacon.”
“Also, I’ve read there are magical means of pulling or attracting your soulmate, is that true?” Sam seemed rather serious.
“Um...I suppose so, I’ll need to call in some additional help and it is very last minute, I’ll have to charge extra for that on top of the cost of the new dessert.”
“Harry, wizards all over the country would kill to be in my shoes, but you’re choosing me. Do you have any idea how insane that is to me?” He cupped Harry’s cheek and stroked his hair gently. “I don’t know what I did to deserve you Harry, but I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy.”
“It’s meant to be the most blindingly perfect union two people can share. When soul mates meet and bond, they even have the ability to sense what the other wants and needs by instinct, even from a great distance. That they have the ability to calm and soothe their partner through touch and that they become fiercely driven to protect and care for their match. Why would anyone sever that?” said Rosie, eager for an answer.
Still no yelling. Harry was fine. He figured at most Draco would yell, but not get to the point of yelling and throwing things. “The Department of Transportation is already embarrassed at having to give up the case. Whoever catches these smugglers would really show up the wizards who claimed that ex-Death Eaters could never accomplish anything.”
In reality, Harry and Draco just played a lot of Exploding Snap, because after one disastrous attempt at Wizard’s Chess, Draco refused to play with anyone other than Ron.
sense of romance,” Draco said and gave him a very aggressive kiss on the forehead. “I can’t believe I’m going to marry you.”
He pushed up to his hands and knees, as far as he could manage without letting a sharp whine into his breath. “You shouldn’t even touch a Starfleet uniform. You gave up that right when you dropped out of Hogwarts Academy to become Maquis!”
“Oh, you mean other than the fact that he claims to be the best Chaser in the league, even though his left turns are always sloppy when he flies defence? Or how he practically salivates over you whenever he’s at your charity events?”
“I’m sorry, Professor Potter,” Sam said in a tiny voice. “I just really wanted to find my soulmate.”
“Fine, someday, but not in here,” Draco said. “There’s better places to go in the Ministry in the middle of the night than the bathrooms for a bit of caterwauling. Personally, I prefer the abandoned star charting chambers.”
order, willingly showing Malfoy the effect this whole mess had on him. He could disobey through restraint, refusing to leave, refusing to pull down his kisbet, refusing to give in to everything Malfoy offered there, on his knees with a smirk on his lips.
He hadn’t even finished talking when there was a sudden woosh of sound to their left. One by one, tiles slid through the grey and settled into a new path that branched out from the white tile they were on. It stretched all the way out to a faraway tile that glowed with faint blue letters:
“The subtlety of our friends. And the fact that I actually thought you weren’t that oblivious when you obviously are.”
to be you,” Weasley had said, when they were strategizing. “I can distract him in the common room while you go. Harry only really gets distracted by you behind closed doors, and we both know he won’t take off his clothes in your room, ‘cause he’s scared of Zabini’s hidden recording devices.”
say no when reporters ask if you’re seeing someone.” Draco growled, jumping over the orange tile. “You say you’re ‘waiting until it
“Absolutely nothing. Again my magic was never pulled. You just got lucky, well, relatively speaking. I’m not sure if you would consider this situation lucky. Had I not happened to cross your path, I never would have been aware or felt that anything was wrong with you. I wasn’t in the bond.”
“Then maybe,” Harry said. “Maybe we let them talk? It’ll be loud for a while, but it wouldn’t be so bad.”
It was a little less nice when the plane hiccuped and Harry stumbled and the stiff tug of a body-bind wrapped around his muscles before he got his balance back. Harry grunted as his shoulder landed on the wing of the plane and he slid a bit before the sticking spell snagged him. The smuggler had her wand on him, chanting, but the plane bucked again and she went down hard on her rump — the sharp green light of her spell shooting up, instead of at Harry’s prone body.
When Harry props himself up, his eyes widen as he sees Malfoy in all his naked, post-orgasmic glory. His head is turned away slightly; deep, calming breaths coming from his open mouth, bottom lip plump and pink and wet where he’s been biting it. His hair is...well, it’s a wonderful sex-mess really. Malfoy’s fingers are curled loosely near his head against the bedcovers, like he’s been grabbing at the soft blond strands while Harry made him come. It’s sticking out every which way and there’s one lock of hair that curls adorably at his temple.
angry with Theo and when he next spoke, he could hear the slight wobble in his voice, could feel the prickly heat in his eyes again. “
[09:51] I thought he was asleep last night when I got back from the library and when I left this morning but there is still the same Neville-shaped lump in his bed
He’s going to come. He’s going to come in his pants like a horny teenager. And somewhere the tiny, rational part of his brain that’s hanging on for dear life is shouting
When Kingsley calls the meeting to order, Malfoy gives the man his entire focus, doesn’t even react when Harry lets out a bored little huff and slouches as a heated debate starts up between DMLE and Magical Creatures about budget allocation. It’s only when the meeting stretches into its second hour that there’s a sign that Malfoy
understand.” Draco cut him off again; it was vital that Harry knew how sorry he was, how much he knew he’d fucked up. “
He’s relieved when they arrive at his office and he has something utterly benign to concentrate on like removing the protective wards from the door before he unlocks it.
Draco was on the precipice, Harry’s hands holding his, warm and firm, his massive eyes roaming wildly all over Draco’s face, searching—
, in which case this could all be over. The end was inevitable, after all. Potter would definitely hate him when he found out the truth, that Draco
“You can’t see it anyway.” Draco says this more into his wine glass than to Potter and at first he doesn’t think he’s been heard. He sets the glass down because he realises he’s taken rather a large gulp and that can’t be good when Potter suddenly nudges him in the leg. He looks up, startled. “Sorry, what?”
[13:19] I have it on reasonably good authority that Undesirable No. 1 is a “disgraceful, sweaty young man whose hair defies both logic and gravity”
but they are now a permanent fixture on Draco’s shit list. Possibly on Potter’s too as Draco catches a flash of irritation in his face, but maybe that’s wishful thinking on Draco’s part. Either way, it doesn’t change the fact that Potter is leaving.
when Potter leans up, supporting himself on one elbow, cups Draco’s face to pull him in and kisses him, slow and sweet.
[21:15] So all I need to do is tell you the day I found you slightly less than extremely annoying and I can have my present
Harry barely touches a nipple with the pad of his thumb when he hears a sharp intake of breath from underneath him. He locks eyes with Malfoy and runs his thumb over the nipple again, circling around it with slow, careful consideration. Malfoy’s whole body seems to mutinously arch into Harry’s touch and he flushes, sucking his lower lip into his mouth.
[00:47] One day Erica went out to collect a pail of milk for her father, he told her to come straight home afterwards but she never did. Weeks and weeks went by but there was no trace of her, everyone in the town was looking for her, but it was as if she had just vanished
I toyed with the idea of sending Draco to London on the train but then I thought nah, of course he would fly!
Potter shrugs again and takes a sip and smiles crookedly at Draco like it’s just the most natural thing he’s ever done and –
“That was– You’re so–” Harry doesn’t have the words, just lets himself list sideways, sliding out of Draco awkwardly and pulling him into his arms. “Come here.”
“Of course she did.” Draco’s face is serious when he adds, “it was a rather brilliant piece on humane farming practice actually.”
Then he’s pulling Malfoy after him out of the nook and reluctantly letting go before he opens the door.
Outwardly he appeared friendly enough, but was always a little bit aloof when the others were there. And that was the thing: Draco started to get the feeling that Potter kept trying to get him
But Potter is just...looking at him, this long considered thing that Draco can’t read, and he’s about to say
The door to Puddifoot’s chimed with the sound of a new customer and Draco looked up, his heart sinking as Michael Corner stepped inside and made his way over to Potter.
And with that Potter turns and heads towards the kitchen, shrugging out of his jacket as he does so.
said Draco, trying not to overthink the affectionate little circles Harry’s thumb was making on the inside of his wrist. Jesus. He might be the tiniest bit fucked. “
“Er, yeah.” Potter nodded, and grinned back at her. “Really festive. Thanks Luna, this looks incredible. Doesn’t it Draco?”
Malfoy places his hands on the door either side of Harry’s head, his arms boxing him in. “You’re asking me out on a date?” he asks, planting a chaste kiss on Harry’s lips.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Not all of us need to wave our hand about like we’re the Queen of bloody England.”
It’s frantic and intense and just on the edge of violent. Malfoy catches Harry’s bottom lip between his teeth, bites hard enough that Harry moans, opens his mouth more, Malfoy’s tongue coming up to tangle with his. Harry’s hands slide round Malfoy’s waist to pull him in tight and Harry kisses him harder, his lips and tongue building to a heady cadence.
“Oh. Your, um...your…” Draco waves a hand in Potter’s general direction, already feeling the heat creep up the back of his neck. “You can’t see your – you know, your – your everything.”
But the more Benefits and Galas and Banquets and Charity Balls there were that brought them together, the less absurd Draco thought it was until he finally figured it out: Draco was simply Potter’s escape from the near-constant demand for his attention.
Potter’s nerves calm Draco’s own, and he finds it easier then, easier to set up the first few test shots with Potter standing still. They even
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter started adjusting the cuffs, as if his little outfit wasn’t tailored within an inch to fit him like a dream. Potter gestured at the camera. “Who’s on your hit list tonight?”
By ‘might have’ do you mean ‘definitely did and now I’ve left it too long and it feels really awkward’
Potter yawns, leans on Draco a little heavier. “I’m sure I’ve got a packet of ham in the fridge or something. Will that do, Nurse Malfoy?”
“We just need to find you someone who doesn’t think you’re the best thing since sliced bread,” says Hermione, snapping Harry’s attention back to the table.
Harry laughed softly, running his hands back down to Draco’s, intertwining their fingers and urging him forward until there was very little space between them at all. Harry brushed his lips, so
Potter’s thumb doesn’t even falter, his mouth curves into a devious little grin as he looks at Draco. “Dunno, do you want to take me home Malfoy?”
. Draco caught him looking over a few times, in the time between someone leaving with a hot drink and someone else stepping up.
’ with about as much agreeability as a blast-ended skrewt. The door swings open aggressively and Draco is met with a very red-faced man who gives him a once over, snorts and turns on his heel to storm off down the corridor. Draco watches him go, clutching the strap of his satchel. When he turns back he can see Esther and Potter peering out at him.
? He’d never seen anyone look so terrified and small and lost. Someone had had to prise Potter’s hands from Cedric’s tournament jersey, he couldn’t remember who, but he could remember seeing that one of Potter’s arms was covered in blood.
sorry Malfoy,” says Ron, who is unsuccessfully trying to wipe at Malfoy’s shirt with a flimsy paper napkin while shooting Harry looks that say
“Please say something,” Harry said quickly, suddenly sounding horribly vulnerable. “...preferably not
The question surprises him, but not as much as Potter’s tone; soft and interested. He’s definitely shifted closer to Draco too, there’s a warmth pressed against his right calf and he doesn’t need to look to know it’s Potter’s leg against his.

Harry stopped laughing, but his smile stayed firmly in place as a blush appeared on his cheeks. “I can very much assure you that it
that great, bloody bird away. And Potter. Raven hair wild and windswept from his impromptu flight, cheeks pinked up from the cold, and looking -
Potter was still looking up at Luna, completely innocent, completely unfazed. “Are you working on anything new?”
Draco could scarcely remember the last few days of term. He heard about Professor Moody. Potter was released from the hospital. And then they were all heading home. Without Cedric.
“Well, we obviously can’t stay here,.” Draco said, crumpling up the parchment and tossing it over his shoulder into the void. Then he took a breath and called out, “May I please be presented with the rules of this game, so that I may play it to the best of my ability?”
Draco grabbed another book. “Foreign blond prince travelling as an ambassador to negotiate with an Alpha werewolf?”
“Oh, really?” scoffed Potter, folding his arms and raising his eyebrows. “I’ll only believe that with evidence. One of these nights when we’re both here alone, you’re going to sing for me.”
“As you should,” Draco said, even though his heart wasn’t really in it. He stepped onto the tenth tile.
Draco sighed. “Soul bonds in an arranged marriage are coveted, but not nearly as much as political advantage in a marriage. My mother wants to bring our family back to the brink of respectability and as far away from the war as possible. The Greengrasses are traditional, proper, and completely removed from both wars.”
Draco huffed in aggravation, letting go of Harry’s wrist, flinging his hands up and spinning back to the pile of tied up smugglers, who were still yelling at Draco in French. He reached into his robes, yanked out the Ministry Emergency Apprehension Portkey — a Christmas ornament shaped like a pineapple — activated it and flung it at the smugglers, whipping them off to the Auror’s holding cells and leaving the stretch of wing suddenly empty except for the wind.
Harry leaned against the bare wall, breathless and slick, trying to ignore the tremor under his ribs.
Harry did, sliding his shirt off over toned muscles and bronze skin. Draco was a professional and refused to react, even if Harry was more outrageously fit than strictly necessary. But when Harry twisted to the side to show his back, Draco couldn’t help the sharp inhale.
Catch Draco’s cover as it got blown by a sneeze. Witness Draco’s very clever Apparition that avoided breaking the Statute of Secrecy by getting Harry and all four smugglers out on the wing of the plane while they were all tangled up in the fray.
Across the Eighth Year common room, Ronald Weasley gave him the nod. He was distracting Harry with a new version of Exploding Snap from his brother’s shop, which slowly turned your fingers numb if you missed the cards.
[23:25] How does that work then? How could I possibly stop you from getting murdered over the phone? If anything I’d just be forced to hear your pathetic dying screams, no thank you
It’s Potter’s voice, speaking Draco’s thoughts, sounding far away but so familiar in his head as a cloying stench fills his nostrils.
[13:31] You assume it’s something I did and not that she’s just a horrible person incapable of basic human decency
Why would someone do that?” Why indeed? Harry doesn’t have a clue why he did it in the first place, why he’s carried on doing it. “They must just be...really popular.”
It's implied they're the same age by referencing the text book that they both used, I didn't want to do the whole "oh how old are you...?" thing
And then...well then he was leaning in and taking a small bite of Draco’s crêpe, eyelids fluttering closed, releasing a contented little ‘mm’ sound that Draco found he rather liked.
Harry gently removes his fingers and shifts closer, wrapping a hand around his cock, stroking a layer of lube up his shaft. He presses the head against Malfoy’s entrance, bends at the hip so he’s leaning over Malfoy and propping himself up so he can kiss him, so sweet, so soft.
Malfoy doesn’t help with the boxes at all. In fact, all he does is walk silently behind Harry all the way to the DMLE training rooms, with Sebastian trotting along happily at his side, chattering away and floating the eleven boxes of peaches that Harry is fairly certain he’s been overcharged for.
When Professor Moody (who wasn’t Professor Moody at all, he found out much, much later) turned Draco into a ferret for trying to hex Potter, a mortifying thought flashed through his mind: what if his animagus was a
“Well I don’t know how it works! And I’m interested. Muggles use a darkroom or something like that, don’t they?”
“Hi Luna, sorry I’m a bit late.” Potter moved forward so they stood side-by-side. “This is Draco Malfoy. Don’t mind him, he’s just taken a mysterious vow of silence.”
Draco shivered, letting out a breathy little moan as Harry’s lips and tongue and teeth teased him mercilessly, working over the same spot again and again.
Draco sighed, his shoulders sagging in defeat as he turned around. “Nev, I really don’t want to talk ab-“ He stopped, his body still half-turned as his gaze locked onto a pair of unflinching green eyes staring right back at him in the semi-darkness.
[21:14] I’d be gentle, at first. Pull you close to me, your hand in mine while I cup your cheek with the other. Softly run my thumb over that clever mouth of yours. When I do kiss you, it’d be sweet, my lips on yours, not too much pressure. At first anyway
[19:50] You really didn’t and you’re not selfish, don’t let him make you feel that way because he’s got a bruised ego and some hurt feelings
But then Malfoy was heading back to his lab as if nothing had happened, leaving Harry feeling oddly bereft with nothing but his stupid, sentimental little heart for company.
was Draco’s second thought, his eyes landing feverishly on the taut muscle beneath Harry’s skin before flicking back up to his lovely, smiling face.
Harry is pressed right up against Malfoy on a high-backed bench in meeting room five because they were some of the last to arrive and there’s limited seating. Malfoy, to his credit and Harry’s immense frustration, looks completely at ease as he crosses one long elegant leg over the other and chats amiably to the wizard on his other side. Ron is squashed in on the end, grumbling about the complimentary buffet.
“Oh,” Draco says. “Yes. Ah - Esther told me you were here and I thought - well I thought you might be a bit sick of hospital food.”
And brilliant. Really brilliant. He didn’t want it to end. He wanted Potter’s leg nudging up against him all the time. He wanted to try more of Luna’s weird drinks with Potter. He wanted to spoon and watch bake off. And kiss him, soft and sweet, hard and vicious. He wanted all of it.
, Draco had thought, and had frantically looked for Madam Pomfrey in the crowd before the Slytherin prefects were ushering them back to their dorms.
[20:21] Although he’d have my parents to contend with, so he’d have to attend lots of galas and charity benefits, be able to discuss the FTSE with a measure of enthusiasm and speak french fluently and flawlessly on command
Draco holds up two paper bags, puts them on the table before Potter. “Pierogies and potato pancakes. And some cake.”
I just wondered if that’s something that was stopping you from what is supposed to be a bit of fun on a Saturday afternoon
‘not unattractive’. He’s still slender but has filled out a bit since Hogwarts, particularly in the shoulders. And his hair isn’t slicked back severely anymore but cut into a more fashionable style with a slight quiff at the front. He’s still pale, but has enough colour in his face that makes his hair almost look white. Harry knows it’s got a little natural wave to it as well that he must spell into submission. He knows because one time he popped into Malfoy’s lab to find him all flustered and annoyed with what appeared to be an inanimate golden snitch. Pink-cheeked and hair ruffled, Malfoy hadn’t seen Harry standing by the door for a full glorious minute, Harry wondering what that lovely hair would feel like if he ran a hand through it, maybe tightening his fingers a little. Would Malfoy be into that?
. Being on solid land, with food, is unarguably much better than staying hungry up here. Then we can sort out … all this.”
to keep his expression neutral. “This is a book about a green-eyed pirate stealing away a pale blond noble.”
But he knew that if he stayed, there would be no restraint. There never was, between the two of them. This would just be the culmination of a lifetime of confrontations, of contentions. Harry could choose, and whatever choice he made would redefine the parameters of every moment between them for the next 70,000 lightyears.
“Given my treatment since I became your guest, I think I’ve earned plenty,” Harry said. The pool of ichor he was in had risen up to his collarbones by now, oozing through his skin and seeping deep into his bones. He was immobilized, alone, and at the mercy of a kidnapping, murdering, not-human entity he knew basically nothing about. If he somehow did manage to get out of this, Draco will probably tear him a new one for getting into this mess.
“Oh Mother,” he smiled sweetly. “I don’t think you need to worry about instructing me on decent and respectable. You and I have a very different opinion of what that means. But now that I’m no longer a child, I think I can find my own way. In fact with the Ministry restrictions placed upon father, I am effectively the head of this family, and I think it’s time we start doing things a little differently around here.”
Waiting on the path was a black cube, squirming with excitement, flashing bright white dots on all sides.
“Let’s just finish this and leave,” Draco said, sharp. He waved away the green and black fireflies floating around him. “We’ll get back to the Ministry, mollify Shippertonsmith, and get back to our lives.”
He took half a step forward and threaded his freezing fingers through Harry’s. He was so pale that Harry could see faint blue veins near Draco’s knuckles, and feel the smoothness of his skin. Except for the side of his middle finger and the pad of his thumb — calluses from quills and wandwork. Harry knew they’d be there, even before Draco’s fingers touched his own, and Harry loved him so overwhelmingly much that he couldn’t breathe.
“Oh, that’s not a problem,” Draco smiled sweetly, signing the pages on the clipboard and handing it back to her. He took Harry’s hand and turned to leave, “You can charge them to my mother’s personal account.” And with that he swept out of the room taking Harry with him.
of a vacation is to get out of —” Harry yanked his fingers through his hair. “Ugh, just, never mind. Roll the dice, please!”
“Er,” Harry said. “How mad at me is ’swearing in French’ mad? Is this more mad than when you’re throwing things?”
Draco took a breath, spun back to face Harry, and easily hopped over the hole into nothingness to land on the white tile. He moved across two more tiles, stopping at what he saw.
It was like being back on a dragon, like riding the highest flying broom. They were above the ocean, above even the clouds and too high up to really see anything below the crinkled candy wrapper surface of the bright blue water. Draco was by his side, cracking off perfect curses with a flick of his wand at the overwhelmed smugglers. Harry’s veins were full of adrenaline. His ears were ringing with the shouting and the casting and the noises of the Muggle airplane, and the grin on his face prickled with how hard it pulled his cheeks.
You were trapped in an incomplete bond. A sort of magical feedback loop where your body only knew it was bonded but had nothing to attach to, so you had the symptoms of a newly bonded wizard separated from his mate. Without me to complete it, you likely would have gotten weaker and weaker until you died.” Draco shuddered.
