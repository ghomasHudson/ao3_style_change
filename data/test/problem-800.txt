Harry laughed quietly and sat closer cross-legged. He no longer wore a T-shirt, so Draco had an unobstructed view of tanned abdominal muscles as Harry tied up his black hair. Fuck, he looked damn good.
"Merlin, Malfoy... You are so hot. Your tight wet hole feels so good. So good for me," growled Harry with clenched teeth.
In one jump Draco was on his feet, kneeling in front of the chair. He grabbed the young Auror by the shoulders and shook him.
A throaty moan sounds loud in the small bedroom, as Harry licks a broad stripe over Draco’s puckered hole. He loves being eaten by Harry, the intimacy and filthiness makes him feel so hot and aroused. Harry’s skilled tongue now dances over his tight hole, wetting it and making it twitch with lust. Draco digs his fingers into the ruffled bedsheets and his feet into Harry’s broad shoulders.
"Draco Malfoy! Do you actually have the self-control of a 12-year-old," he scolded himself as his hand set off on its own.
Smirking an evil smile, he looked Draco in in eyes. “I accept your apology, baby.” Draco sighed in relief. “But –“. Draco looked at him with big grey eyes. “But I think you still deserve a little punishment for punching your daddy on the nose, right, baby?”
"I'm relatively sure it was arsenic. It smells pretty characteristic and causes exactly the same symptoms as Potter had. Vomiting, cramps, cold sweats, circulatory failure... If he drank a little more, he would be dead now. I have to go to the lab and see if I'm right. Then I can brew him a matching antidote."
“Pleasure, I’m Draco”, Draco mumbled. He was now awkwardly aware of his hot, gleaming face and the black shirt, clinging to his slender back.
I smirked into his scarf. That might work. “I just want to be in bed and feel your warm, strong body”, I whined.
Ron stared and he quickly covered his glowing red ears. “Lalala, I can’t hear you!”, he sang, and I chuckled.
Harry snorted a chuckle, apparently shooting a bit more blood out of his recently punched nose, judging by Draco’s more than disgusted face. “Whoops, sorry, babe.” He waved his hand quickly to clean Draco’s fingers. “Well, I wasn’t expecting to
The shower was incredibly good. Draco certainly stood motionless under the hot water jet for 5 minutes and washed away the day and the tension. He washed himself and ignored his somehow semi-rigid penis. In front of the mirror he shaved the fine blond stubble on his chin with a spell and creamed his sensitive skin. In the evening he liked to let his hair air dry, so he just rubbed it a little with the towel. He walked into the bedroom with the towel around his hip, but it was empty. Draco could hear quiet noises from the kitchen. He quickly put on fresh trousers and a tight black long-sleeved shirt and went barefoot into the kitchen.
“And with the guys I was with after, it was never a question that I’m the one topping”, Harry continued, looking up to Draco with a sceptical look.
You know, with love and everything."  Harry's voice was soft as he pulled Draco's slender body into an intimate embrace.
Soon as Harry woke up, he knew something was wrong. He certainly wasn't a passionate early riser, but at least he got out of bed a few minutes after the alarm clock and slipped under a hot shower. That morning, however, he hardly got his eyes open. A dull feeling slowly spread to the back of his head and he flinched briefly as he tried to swallow the little spit that had accumulated in his mouth overnight with his dry, rough throat.
Even in the dim light that came out of his apartment, Draco could see the dark rings under Potter's eyes.
He was wearing a pair of worn jeans, a long-sleeved shirt and his leather jacket, that once belonged to his godfather. And his old Gryffindor scarf.
Actually, she was right. It was really silly and only unnecessarily kept up the enmities of school time.
And that was true. Draco didn't see Potter in the E.R. next time - but standing in front of his door. Three days had passed since the night of the panic attacks and Draco was cooking his dinner. He had spent a somewhat hectic 10-hour shift in the E.R., had gone grocery shopping and now wanted to reward himself with a good meal. Fresh salmon was on a board for seasoning, vegetables roasted in a pan and in a small pot Draco had prepared the white wine dill sauce he loved so much. One might wonder why a rich boy, who always had everything precooked by house elves, was so enthusiastic and also good in the kitchen. The fact is that cooking and yoga have a lot in common. Routine, skills, movements, breathing, relaxing, pleasing the soul. And so after Azkaban Draco had discovered that he was a true natural talent in the kitchen!
With a disgusted face Harry swallowed the potion and let himself sink back onto the pillows. Again he wrapped his arms around his narrow chest and trembled violently under the thick blanket.
of a man. Palming his stiffening dick through his jeans, Draco took a deep breath and grabbed a few limes to cut in pieces for tonight’s Cuba Libres and Caipirinhas.
Their cottage was all the way down in Cornwall, standing on the coast of the beautiful countryside, the sea only a few yards away, quite similar to Shell Cottage. It was theirs and theirs alone, a place for peace and nature and intimate togetherness without the stress and the noise of the city and of too much work. They actually had a small apartment in Hackney, London where they both lived most of their weeks, because it was just convenient when they both worked in the city. But the cottage… This was their real home.
Harry seemed to understand me, and he was too impatient himself anyway. I know he finally wanted to taste me. He penetrated me with his tongue and a long scream escaped my throat. He licked the sensitive skin faster and faster, pushed his tongue into the tight hole. I clawed my hands into the bed sheet and breathed shakily, being so heavenly fucked by Harry’s tongue.
But then I heard a soft, rustling sound. I craned my neck to see, what he was doing. And I saw something red and white in his hands. What the hell?
"Not quite, I woke up at 10 am or so and read your message. I'm really sorry I kept you awake so long yesterday, by the way."
Slowly the candy cane pressed inside me. It was not thick, but it was long and started to brush against my prostate. My hard cock twitched again.
“How can I make it up to you, daddy?” Draco’s voice was smooth and dark and full of promises and Harry felt the exciting spark of anticipation twinkling in his stomach, as Draco started the game.
If you want, you can leave a small comment! It's my first fic in english and it would mean the world to me ♥
“Fuck, fuck…”, Draco sobs. He can’t think, can’t talk. He nearly feels overwhelmed and struggles with his breath.
A wolfish grin spread in this gorgeous bearded face. “How can you be sure I’m wearing any?”, Harry said in a low growl and Draco nearly fainted.
Draco took the strong, tanned hands in his and pulled the black haired one up on his feet. Silently he pulled the smaller man towards him and put his arms around him. Just a second later he felt two muscular arms snaking around his middle and Harry laying his head on Draco's shoulder. The blonde felt the warmth and the fast heartbeat of the other. With slow movements he stroked the wide back of the former Gryffindor until his breath had calmed down again.
I heard him whisper another spell and I shouted a muffled scream into his chest. It vibrated. The candy cane fucking vibrated against my swollen prostate. I pressed my mouth into his warm chest, trying to keep quiet, but still some breathy moans escaped me. My heart pounded wildly in my chest.
The auror slipped back until his back hit the couch. Extending and parting his long legs on the floor, he leaned back and watched Draco with dark, lust-blown eyes. Pulling his shirt over his head and sinking to his knees in one motion, Draco came nearer to Harry’s clothed crotch. With deft fingers the blonde opened Harry’s flies with one hand, slightly stroking the firm thighs with the other.
He felt Harry shake his head. "No. It wasn't as bad as before. But somehow... I didn't want to be alone."
“Apology accepted?”, Draco asked and cuddled closer to Harry. He leaned to his muscular boyfriend, shamelessly rubbing his enormous bulge in his jeans against Harry’s hip, clearly begging for some release himself.
Draco smiles happily and presses his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, relishing the tangy, manly smell and the dark beard against his sensitive skin.
"Oh, Merlin, that's in 4 hours! I am so sorry. I really didn't want to be a burden to you! I can... I can also go back to the living room again. Or back home..."
“And weren’t you the one, who begged me on his knees to comply with this weird muggle superstition to spend the last night before the wedding apart from each other, just because you’ve seen this in a movie last month?”
“Don’t worry”, one of the guys, Seamus, answered with a strong Irish accent. “We’re missing a member anyway.”
He pulled me into a tight embrace, his body warmth was seeping through his clothes and started to warm my frozen limbs a bit. But that wouldn’t be enough.
"What are we going to do with him now," Anthony thought. "I think I'll call down one of the colleagues from the curse damage department, maybe they've seen something like this before."
so..." Draco rubbed his neck and let himself sink to the edge of the bed. "Have you slept until now?"
! And what about "Please, Draco stay with me. Don't leave me alone"??? He had clung to his shirt in search of help, had trusted only him, had sought shelter and peace and quiet in Draco’s presence and now he didn't even look at him and sent him away?
And with these words he closed his eyes and leaned forward. Immediately he felt the beard on his chin and directly after a pair of
Draco’s chuckle was drawn into a whine, when he felt Harry ripping his shirt open and sucking on his pink nipple.
While Harry inspected the spice drawer and seasoned his food, Draco set the table. He couldn't believe they had dinner together only once, it felt so familiar to stand in a good smelling kitchen and talk to Harry.
Harry stood at the stove in jeans and a dark blue T-shirt. He turned when he heard the kitchen door.
The blonde healer sighed, "All right... Hermione. What can I do for you?" He pointed to the chair in front of the desk.
"Okay, then I'll make us a little something and maybe... maybe we can talk a bit?" His stomach suddenly felt very weak.
"No, Draco... please... stay here! Draco, please don't go..." he muttered incessantly and tried to cling to his robe.
Harry’s eyes went wide and he sat up again. These were Draco’s safewords for when they play. For when they have one of their scenes with tying up and spanking and Draco begging and crying for release. “Do you think –“ He cleared his throat. “Do you think that’ll be necessary?”
I shrugged, not even bothering to open my eyes. I just felt so warm and comfortable. How should I be in the mood to go out in the fucking snow and the freezing wind, when instead I could cuddle with Harry all day long. Well except for lessons. And meals. And studying time in the library. And when I went to the loo. But else?
Pleasure rose in his groins and he tilted his hips up and down, following Draco’s hand and pressing himself a bit deeper onto his finger. Draco took that as an invitation and started to slowly move his finger in and out, while stroking Harry’s cock.
"So I have to say, otherwise men keep me awake in my bed in other ways," Draco threw in hastily and just couldn't stop looking at Harry's manbun!
after 6 wonderful years of being together, moving in together, building a life together, Harry had proposed to Draco. And tomorrow would be the wedding.
The two men sat across from each other at the kitchen table. They could hardly have looked more different. One was long and slender with neat light blond hair and bright skin, his long fingers interlocked and his back stretched; the other smaller and more muscular with tangled black streaks and a bronze complexion, sunken on his chair, his head lowered.
A head with tangled black hair peeked out of the pillows and blankets and Draco was suddenly relieved and laughed briefly.
After starting the same sentence for the fifth time, he closed the book with a bang, grabbed his coat and left the apartment. A few minutes later he stood in front of the staff entrance, a door invisible to Muggles, and entered St. Mungo.
Arriving at the station, of all people, he ran into Katherine, the obtrusive witch of his class. She had apparently ended up on this ward after her training. Smiling and swaying her red-brown hair, she walked towards him. The young man had to make every effort not to roll his eyes.
He tried to ignore the staring gaze of the redhead, stepped to the white bed and looked into the unusually pale face of his former opponent.
“But something else?!” Stubbornly Draco managed to get his hands free and crossed his arms in front of his naked chest. “So, would you tell me about it?”
Draco hummed understandingly. “And when do we get to the point where your ass comes on stage?”, he asked lightly.
Harry palpated his bleeding nose, twitching a bit, when a small twinge shot through, but all in all he concluded that it wasn’t broken.
"Malfoy..." Potter whispered quietly and pressed his hands on his still aching stomach. "What happened?
Harry could just stare at his long, elegant neck and wonder how it might feel to suck a purple mark in this silky white skin.
And now they stood there, snogging and rubbing against each other like randy teenagers, visible to anyone who would come out of the pub’s back door.
Draco could certainly understand what it was like when the fear was eating you up, when you had pure panic and just wanted to scream. Yes, he knew that feeling, that Potter, no…
"There you are! I hope it was okay that I started already, I didn't know what you wanted to cook, but I wanted to return yesterday's favor".
had been Harry's only salvation. Draco pushed this strange tingling, which now spread to his stomach, aside. Surely he had not eaten enough again.
"How did you know it was poison?" asked one of his colleagues. "At first I thought it was his appendix or something!
"And why did you send me away then?" Draco asked and hoped that his voice sounded as cold and indifferent as he had planned. But he wasn't sure if he succeeded.
If he had been told 10 years ago that he would be in the shower today masturbating to images of his school enemy, he would have declared him crazy. The old Malfoy would probably have jinxed them for this insolence. But now Draco stood under the hot, splashing water and tried to turn off his pushy penis. A voice pierced his head saying he was nuts and it was absolutely ridiculous and needy when he jerked off on two little encounters with Harry, no
While the two men dragged Potter more than he walked himself, the black-haired Auror constantly babbled something in Italian and whimpered softly.
Harry was silent at first, then something seemed to strike him. "Since when do you call Hermione by her first name?," he asked in surprise.
"Well, Harry was free today and we were supposed to meet at his place for breakfast. I flooed to him and everything was normal. We went to the kitchen and he made me a tea. Then he said that a colleague had lent him a book, which I would certainly like, and he went into the living room to get it. He took forever, he's really a bit chaotic. So I quickly went to the toilet and when I came back, he was standing in the kitchen pouring himself a glass of that bottle I had given you. I'm a 100% sure the bottle wasn't on the kitchen counter before! He drank a sip and after a few seconds he collapsed screaming and cramping. He threw up and it was all red and then I grabbed him  and apparated here!"
Harry swirled his hot tongue around his sensitive glans and Draco’s eyes fluttered shut. He let his head drop heavy against the brick wall behind him, scratching his hands against the rough stone in his need for something –
Draco looked down into those beautiful eyes. "I think it would be nice if we could manage to be friends," he replied honestly and saw relief streaming through Harry's face. That nasty little voice in the back of his head, shouting to him that he might want more than just to be Harry's
"Thank you for taking me in tonight." Draco heard that the deep voice was a little sluggish. "I really needed a little distraction."
“You look so hot Draco…” He spread my cheeks now with both hands, clearly staring at my pink hole. “Fuck, your ass looks so delicious…”
They decided that Harry should take the potion here in the E.R. and take him to the ward afterwards as it seemed impossible in his condition to move him out of this room. The two healers didn't want to risk another seizure. After endless persuasion from Draco, Harry finally swallowed the potion and one minute later he slept soundly.
He’s the singer, Draco thought. Fuck. Draco cursed his susceptibility for male singers. He swallowed hard and answered: “Sure, I’ll bring it up right before your gig. Do you guys need anything else?”
“I’m going to fuck you now, baby. Here in this alley, where everyone could see, what a beautiful little slut you are.”
“You want me to fuck you, baby?” He moved away from me and I nearly sobbed out of frustration and the lack of touching.
. His tanned skin glowed in all the stages of the rainbow; the muscles of his arms flexed around the e-guitar he was holding, and even from where Draco was standing, all the way across the pub behind the busy bar, Harry’s eyes seemed to sparkle.
Draco’s voice was a bit breathless when he answered: “You know I am.” He moaned lightly, as Harry sucked on his neck. “And you know, I would never back down…”
When Draco was sure that Harry was finally asleep, he stroked his wet, curly hair one last time and then pulled his hand back. Gently he rose from his uncomfortable kneeling position in front of the bed. He went quietly to the door to make himself something to eat when he heard a soft noise.
Potter nodded and closed his eyes in concentration. As his chest did not lift any further, but remained so, Draco casted his spell and saw with satisfaction that the tense face of the former Gryffindor loosened. Relieved, he let out the air again and puffed deeply once.
And then Harry’s hips came to an abrupt halt, his cock buried deep inside me and he moaned loudly and pumped a full load of hot sperm in my hole.
The warm wet heat around his dick felt so good and Draco’s hips jerked forward, pressing himself even deeper in Harry’s mouth. He was so deep in Harry’s throat and so
The black-haired man spreads Draco’s firm cheeks even more and dives his tongue into his hole. Draco’s eyes fly open. The stubble of the black beard is rough against his sensitive skin but
Harry looked Draco in the eye and nodded. "You've been through a lot, too." His voice was quiet and rough.
“Oh, don’t worry. You must be the missing member of The Deathly Hallows? I guess your mates are already eagerly waiting for you. I’m Draco by the way.”
Gently they rubbed over his rim and through his crack. Draco shivered with tension and lust. A slight electric shock went through him as a finger penetrated him. He moaned and slid down the wall a little and lowered himself even deeper onto the finger, which moved in a slow rhythm.
The young healer bit his lower lip and finally pulled himself together. "If you have no plans, you can stay for dinner." He shrugged his shoulder towards the stove, where his culinary skills had meanwhile become cold. "I can do some more. That is, only if you like."
Slowly he gets up and moves through the hall. His hand already lifted, he takes a deep breath before knocking gently against his guest bedroom’s door. As he hears no answer, he slowly opens the door, pokes his head inside – and stops dead in his tracks.
"Accio Bezoar," Draco shouted and caught the little black stone that flew out of one of the drawers with one hand.
And the sounds he made. Oh my god. He hummed and sighed and together with the filthy slurping sounds his mouth made, it seemed like he just ate the best treacle tart in the world.
When Pansy practically jumped at him, grasping his arm, Draco knew, that Harry had left his place in front of the bar.
The smaller man turned in his arms and pressed his back against Draco's upper body. Carefully the blonde buried his nose in the black hair and took a deep breath of this enchanting scent to calm down.
"The wine is good," the Auror finally broke the silence. "I'd rather drink beer, but it's really delicious."
Draco grinned and patted Harry’s cheek and Harry could throttle him for being such an arrogant git. The blonde seemed to notice the glare he was getting, and his smile turned soft. “It’s just for you to let me know, if you get uncomfortable, all right? I won’t do anything you don’t feel good with, okay?”
unusually cold in there today, wasn't it? Back outside, he inconspicuously enchanted his shopping bags, making them lighter to carry home without much effort. But either he didn't quite manage the magic today, or his sinewy arms were just too weak. Anyway, the way back to the apartment was exhausting, actually everything was exhausting. And these damn headaches were now really pounding in the back of his head.
," Draco exhaled as the two full lips, which could kiss so well, lay around his glans and moved over the shaft up and down faster and faster. Draco's heart was pounding while he could only hear his own blood rushing in his veins and his loud moaning in the quiet apartment.
“Oh my god, what happened?!”, Draco blurted and scrambled forward to the place where Harry sat on the blue carpet.
"Then tell me." The words had left Draco's mouth before he could stop them. Merlin, what had got into him? Why did he offer Potter to pour out his heart?
It had got dark outside and the two men had moved into the living room with two glasses of fire whiskey. Draco had lit the logs in the small fireplace and sat down in his corner of the couch, while Harry had sat down in the armchair, which stood at right angles to the dark grey sofa. Draco was comfortable, the food had been good, the fireplace was burning and the wine and liquor were warming him from the inside. He noticed that he was a bit drunk, but it didn't matter... In fact, it was just very cozy. Yawning, he pulled up his legs and looked into the flames.
“I’ll be back in an hour!”, he shouted over his shoulder to Ron and the other guys and rushed out of the door.
Draco's moaning grew louder as he pressed against this little bundle of nerves up his ass and twitched his hip forward. Quickly he increased the vibrations to a fast and violent rhythm and exhaled a deep growl as the feeling roared like electric shocks through his now sweat-covered body. He turned on his back again and pressed his butt against the mattress to drill the stick even deeper. The noises escaping his mouth increased into a hoarse scream, always to the beat of the buzzing against his already aroused prostate. His hands clawed into the sheets, he bent his back, drilled his heels into the bed and gasped and screamed loudly until he couldn't stand it any longer.
And then it began right away. Draco didn't have a minute to catch his breath in the first three hours. In the emergency room all urgent cases first came together, witches and wizards were treated until they could be handed over to other wards or, in less dramatic cases, sent home. The emergency room was divided into a reception area and 6 small treatment rooms, each staffed with 2 healers working day and night shifts. At the back there was an operating room where urgent operations could be performed if it would have taken too long to send the patients to the appropriate ward.
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy! There you are! We've heard a lot about you. Just don't relax, it's about to start. We'll give you the matching robes for this station and then I'll introduce you to Anthony Young, who will take you under his wing at first, you'll also be divided into the same shifts. By the way, my name is Jones, Margret Jones."
“I can’t believe you’re actually prepared!”, Harry growled back, burying his hand deep in Draco’s pants, feeling the end of a small plug between his cheeks.
“Alright”, Harry smiled, only then realising that the rest of the band already left the pub to enjoy the warm sun. “I’ll see you later, I guess?”
I quickly scrambled to get up and pushed my butt in the air, my hard cock now dangled heavy and red between my legs.
The other man, who introduced himself as Connor Benson, also an Auror and looking also a little wrecked, sighed impatiently.
to! His trembling hand reached for his cock and with only 2, 3 fast pumping movements he fell over the edge and moaned his orgasm out off his lungs. His legs trembled as hot cum shot at his pale chest and the vibrator still twitched in his ass and provoked his over-excited body even more. Draco lasted a few more seconds, then he pulled the vibrator out of his ass with a deep groan. He gasped for air, tried to calm his hammering heart and let the aftershocks of his grandiose orgasm ripple through him.
“Sure”, Harry sighed, scratching the back of his neck. “But don’t expect too much. I guess, it’s far less exciting than you hope for.”
this summer. Like any 15-year-old would do. But of course, I had all this gay porn in mind. And all these asses being fucked. And these guys really seemed to like it.”
Draco shot back up, bumping his head painfully against the countertop and groaning now not only because of Pansy’s unabashed comment. Grabbing his throbbing head, he looked daggers at her. “
The turntable was playing quietly from the living room and Draco was stirring in the pan when the doorbell rang. Annoyed, he rolled his eyes, he had been looking forward to a quiet evening. To be on the safe side he turned the stove down, he had to get rid of the unannounced visit quickly, but his good food shouldn't burn on him!
Harry tried to mask his grin behind an extended yawn. “That’s my good boy. Now I’m going to eat that delicious stew you made for me and we’ll go to bed, okay?”
I shivered, as his cleaning charms washed over me. Then I just cuddled back into his chest and felt my eyes close and soft darkness embraced me.
He let Harry push him against the wall and both groaned simultaneously as their semi-hard erections touched through the fabric. Again they kissed breathlessly, their tongues wrestled and fought with each other. Draco shoved his hands under Harry's shirt and pulled it over his head. His hands felt warm strands of muscle that felt hard and soft at the same time. Harry also took off the blonde's shirt and threw it aside just as carelessly.
So it didn't suit him at all to be ill today. He simply decided to ignore his body. But to be honest, he had already noticed in the last two days that he was not quite fit. At the end of the day he had felt exhausted and yesterday he had had those dull headaches which were now getting worse and worse since waking up. Harry rubbed the cold glass of water over his temples and snuffled before he got up. Maybe a good shower would help. With his eyes closed, he stood under the hot water and let it run down his body. He was still slim, but due to more sport and training not as delicate as in his school days. His cramped neck muscles relaxed a little, but those annoying headaches didn't want to go away.
And Draco just stared. He had completely forgotten the half-filled glass in one hand, the bottle with vodka in the other. Only when the guest in front of him waved his hand in front of his nose, Draco woke up from his temporary paralysis.
So the little healer babbled non-stop until they arrived in the locker room. There she shoved a pile of robes into his hand.
Slowly, agonizingly slowly Harry moves his fingers in and out, pressing hard against Draco’s most sensitive spot every time.
“Oh, Madame Rosmerta is selling mulled wine and mead in front of her pub! Do you guys want some?”, Theo asked.
Pain became pleasure and Draco loved that moment when he forgot everything around him and could lose himself in the deep groan of the man behind him. It just felt incredible. Deep slow thrusts pressed Draco against the cool table top and rubbed his throbbing cock against the smooth wood again and again. Harry's hands on his back were strong and would certainly leave stains on his pale skin, but he didn't care.
Draco sat up and switched on the lamp on the bedside table. The alcohol was still running through his veins and he rubbed his eyes. The young Auror stood in front of him like a picture of misery and trembled slightly in the coolness of the room. He looked quite unfamiliar without glasses and with the loose hair that reached over his shoulders in dark curls.
Sometimes we fell behind a few steps and I gave in to the insane pleasure washing through my body. I gasped and panted, and Harry always smiled sweetly and brushed the sweaty hair out of my forehead.
“Shit, I’m sorry!”, the man said equally startled in a smooth low voice and Draco had to be careful not to drool.
The black haired man raised an eyebrow and his left corner of his mouth raised. Was Draco mistaken or did the other man let his gaze wander over his upper body just as he did over him? But Harry's light smile suddenly collapsed.
“Fuck, that feels amazing, Harry”, he moans and Harry hums against his ass, eliciting another deep groan from Draco.
His eyes fell on the alarm clock on the nightstand. He hadn't slept long, it was just half past midday, but he felt
Draco starred suspiciously at the large clock on the wall. This thing wasn’t working, right? It had to be broken! How else would it be possible for the hands to run in slow motion? It was 3:14 p.m. for at least 20 minutes! Draco supressed an annoyed groan and tried to focus his attention back to the professor down at the foot of the lecture hall talking about round and pointed arches. Normally he loved his architecture studies, but the message he received a few minutes ago set him in a bad mood. Jake, the owner of the Black Lion, a famous punk rock pub, where Draco worked in order to cover his living, once again decided only to show up in the evening and leave the hard work to Draco. That meant, that immediately when the lecture ended at 3:30 p.m. he had to head to Shoreditch to open the club for tonight’s live band and prepare the bar for a busy Friday night.
With a soft crack the broken bone settled back again and Potter moaned softly. No, Draco certainly didn't shiver at that sound!
Ron had come over by now and slumped into an armchair next to us. “There’s a notice on the board, that Hogsmeade will have a Christmas Market on this last weekend before the holidays.”
Draco didn't know what time it was. The alcohol and the stressful shift in St. Mungo had made him sleepy and he must have dozed off on the couch. The soothing crackle from the fireplace was all he could hear on the edge of his consciousness just before he dived into deeper spheres.
"I'm sorry that I sent you away. Especially after everything you had done for me. I know for a fact that you saved me with the bezoar and your antidote. And I also know exactly how you were there for me in my panic attacks and hallucinations."
Draco now appeared in the kitchen door and Harry couldn't help but smile despite his almost bursting head. He actually smiled every time he saw his friend. He wore one of his usual cloth trousers, today in black and a plain white shirt. He always left his working robes in his locker in St. Mungo.
"Well, he is an Auror and hunts black wizards... So it's possible that they were after him", Anthony interjected.
Hermione smiled quietly. When she said goodbye, she turned around at the door and said: "He sends his regards, by the way".
"And then he simply drinks something that suddenly appears in his apartment?" Draco asked mockingly. "I thought the man is an Auror. They are sceptical by nature and always on their guard!"
Harry stood now right in front of the counter. Slightly sweating he rubbed the back of his hand over his forehead and smirked. This fucking smirk.
He finally freed my ear and I shivered as his warm breath washed over my skin. “If you come with me and behave, I might as well do something for you later…” His voice was deep and full of oh so filthy promises.
Harry’s eyes twinkled and he bit his lower lip, as though he was trying to hold back a spontaneous remark. Instead he said: “I just wanted to ask, if I could have a bottle of water for the stage? I always get a dry throat up there.”
The two healers were already on their feet. Anthony prepared a quick calming potion, while Draco stayed with Harry. He tried to calm him down and listen to his vital signs at the same time. Everything was routine and professional, every move was perfect and in the end Anthony and Draco had managed to sedate the black-haired man. Harry's breathing was flat, his eyes flickering back and forth. His lips moved slightly.
The grip of the tanned fingers increased around Draco's hips as Harry withdrew almost completely and then thrusted deep into him again.
She had already hurried back outside and the four healers from treatment room No. 4 ran after her. They heard the hoarse, tortured screams from the waiting area. A deep male voice shouted and moaned apparently in agony. And Draco only needed to take one look at him and knew immediately who they were dealing with.
Draco's heart again made a small hop out of time and he quickly covered his red cheeks with a scornful grin. "That's just the alcohol talking, Potter! Don't get used to it!"
With a flick of his wand, Harry vanished all of their clothes and pressed Draco down on their bed. He lay himself on his slender boyfriend, relishing the slide of his warm, soft skin, feeling the sharp hip bones pressing against his stomach.
There he stood. Still at the beginning of the street, staring up at all the lights and decorations. His big green eyes twinkled.
A soft whisper came out of the young man's mouth. Draco bent down closer, so close that the other's breath tickled his ear.
He set it on a low level and glided over his bulging balls and gasped excitedly as he let the vibrator's tip glide over his glans. A few drops of white already poured out and Draco threw his head back as he grabbed his hard shaft with the other hand and pumped briefly. The vibrator now slipped through his pale cheeks and Draco turned on his stomach with his legs wide apart to ease access.
Completely wrecked and sweaty, the two men collapsed on the tabletop. Draco heard the rapid breathing of the young auror and felt his heart racing against his ribs.
“I know”, Draco mumbles, snuggling closer to Harry’s warm body. After only a few more minutes, he’s fast asleep.
"I don't think much of taking medicine all the time." Harry chuckled briefly when he saw Draco rolling his eyes.
. Slow and sensual. Their moans and movements entangle in one deep, earth-shattering rhythm, which makes them both nearly blind with lust and the essential need to come.
Oh, that felt good. He deepened the intense feeling a little as he massaged his swollen balls with his free hand and his right hand was still running up and down his dripping cock. Once again Draco noticed how much he loved this feeling. He was certainly not prudish. Repeatedly, especially during his apprenticeship, he had spent almost every weekend in muggle clubs in London, picking up guys. He had enjoyed performing differently every evening. Sometimes he played shyly and naively, sometimes dominant and demanding. And every time he got what he wanted at that moment. And that was mostly hard, dirty and just hot. For Draco it didn't really make any difference whether he fucked or was fucked. The most important thing was that he felt this bittersweet feeling of the overwhelming lust rising in his lower stomach, and he reached the climax.
“That’s it!” Harry slammed his flat hand on the table, startling the nearby guests. Heat flooded his limps and brain. He stood up, fumbled for his wallet in the back pocket of his jeans and carelessly flung a few notes onto the table.
Harry sighed and tried again to open his eyes, this time succeeding. Tremendously slow he sat up, wincing at the sparks of pain in his head. After a few calming breaths Harry decided, that he didn’t have to puke. Instead he reached for the bottle of water on his nightstand and drank in greedy gulps. The water refreshed his dry mouth and took the edge off his headache immediately. With a soft satisfied groan, he sank against the headboard of his bed and blinked at the clock on the wall opposite. It was 3:32 p.m. The residual alcohol pumped lazily through his veins and Harry blinked again. FUCK! It was already after 3 p.m.!
Harry put an arm around Draco’s slender shoulders and pressed a kiss in the crook of his neck but flinched when his nose still protested. Right. He nearly forgot in his post-orgasmic bliss.
“Please, he looks like a fucking Calvin Klein model!”, Dean snorted and yelped as Seamus smacks him on the head. “Shay, you know I love you, but you can’t deny it. He’s really good looking.”
"We haven't tried it yet," Benson grumbled. "I was glad we got him here at all! Do you think he'll be all right?", he turned to the two healers with concern.
“Aaaanyway. I did some… research. On my cousin’s computer. When they were out one night. And I found stuff about sexualities and being gay and being bi. And it just fitted? It was like the explanation to my feelings I couldn’t even explain myself.”
Harry's low groaning and my high-pitched screams filled the room and almost drove me into madness of lust. I bit my lower lip to hold back the hot sperm, which was already gathering in my loins. I didn't want to come yet, didn't want it to be over. But I was
Draco rubbed his chin. "I think we can send him up to the ward. I'll try to find out what happened."
“Just relax, baby, I’ll take care of you”, Draco whispered against Harry’s toned abs and the black-haired man chuckled, because Draco used his own lines against him.
Harry just smiled, snaking his arms around Draco’s slender waist and pulled his boyfriend closer to him, while avoiding bumping his nose into the other man’s chest. “I know, baby. But it still hurts
Harry turned on his stomach now, eyes hungrily fixed on Draco’s not-so-soft-anymore cock. “But you like it, when I fuck you, don’t you?”, he growled deep in his throat.
When Harry woke up, he wasn’t quite aware of his current state. He wasn’t aware about the bed he was lying in, about the singing birds outside his window, about the sunlight shining through a big gap in his curtains, about the sweet-sour taste in his mouth… But what he
.”, Draco came in the blink of an eye, biting his own hand to muffle his screaming. He felt Harry’s hot breath in his neck and his own hot cum shooting in thick ropes against the brick wall. After a few more thrusts, Harry’s hips came to a stuttering halt and he buried his head between Draco’s shoulder and neck, breathing heavily through his own orgasm.
Together we strolled through the decorated streets, stopping here and there to buy a few last-minute-gifts for our friends and some snacks for us. The wind grew colder every minute and my feet started freezing like hell. I looked up at Harry, still clad in his leather jacket (which he looked freaking hot in). He simply showed no sign of discomfort or cold whatsoever, that git. Me, on the other hand, really wanted to go home by now. Slip into my warm bed, Harry wrapped around me and his dick preferably in my ass. So, I started to whine.
Harry now lies between his spread legs, his strong hands stroking up and down his thighs. Draco feels breathless, just from looking at the man he loves hungrily staring at his twitching cock. Without any words, Harry guides his legs up and places his feet on is shoulders. Warm breath ghosts over his skin and Harry spreads his cheeks.
Draco felt his ears getting hot and hurried to hide his face under the counter to rummage for a bottle of coke.
Draco writhes and shakes, just half a second away from a breath-taking orgasm. With his pure willpower he forces himself not to come, not to yield the temptation of endless relief.
Seamus pouted playfully. “I’m more into dark, tall guys with short hair and piercings, you know?” Dean flashed him a loving smile. “Maybe I’ll meet someone like that tonight”, Seamus grinned and ducked as Dean threw one of his own drumsticks at him.
“Come!” He took me by the hand and pulled me into a dark alley between two houses. He hastily threw some concealing charms around us, masking us from curious views.
"Draco... Draco... please!" Harry's voice was just a hoarse croak, his big hand groping for the front of Draco's shirt.
The end is near... It's been a bumpy ride and I'm so grateful for each of you who read it and left Kudos or a Comment below :)
"I’m all ears?" Draco's usual snarling had become surprisingly gentle at the sight of the man in front of him.
upstairs. He was struck by an unknown curse that caused seizures and panic attacks," he told her in a matter-of-fact tone. "Do you have a room for him?"
The black-haired man frowned. His eyes twinkled. "But...?" he asked and Draco thought he heard something like hope from his quiet voice.
"Ah, uhng," slipped out of his parted lips. He quickly pushed Harry a few centimeters away, otherwise he couldn't concentrate at all. "What exactly was that for you?"
Stumbling and swearing Harry jumped out of his bed and rushed into the hallway of the small apartment.
"Merlin, you are a pain in the ass!" The blonde swung the door open and stopped in the door frame. "And you look pretty shitty," he remarked.
"Yeah, I have no idea..." Draco mumbled in shame and Harry laughed. Somehow he hadn't thought that far.
“Fucking you outside in the alley, pressing you against the wall and take you from behind”, Harry growled against Draco’s collarbone. “The night we met, I mean…”
With every step we took, the hard, unyielding stick pressed against my balls and prostate in just the right amount of pleasure and pain. I constantly bit my lip, to restrain me from moaning. Harry’s hand in my mine was warm and calm and the only thing that kept me from losing my mind! I wanted to come
He grabbed his college stuff and was just about to open the door, when it was ripped open. Draco startled and let out a high-pitched gasp, which he regretted again a second later when he saw who was now standing in front of him. A man, tall and muscular with tanned skin, his long hair tied up in a loose bun, 5-day stubble, leather jacket and sunglasses. Oh
And I came. I threw my head back and screamed as I pumped a huge load between myself and the mattress without even touching my cock. I saw stars, my vision blurred and my insides were on fire. I came and came and came. Everything spun in my head and I seemed to float on clouds.
Draco quickly went to Potter's other side and slightly bent his knees to put Potter's arm over his shoulders. He felt the warm body hanging close to his own and smelled a tangy perfume (which he liked far too much).
I stepped nearer; my knees were so weak. With shivering fingers, I reached for his jacket and clawed the material, trying to stabilize myself. He pressed my head against his chest, my cheek now lay warm against his hard muscles. He gently massaged my scalp and neck.
Draco wiped sadly over the wet corners of his eyes and went into the bedroom to undress. Now he urgently needed a hot shower. Carelessly he walked past the unmade bed and pulled his shirt over his head. With a rustling sound he threw it into the laundry basket.
Pansy nearly dropped her glass. “Are you blind?”, she screamed and punched him on the arm. “He’s flirting with you all night! He was practically undressing you with his eyes!”
The blonde healer stared at the man in bed for a while, his mouth open, then he closed his jaw, grinding his teeth and lifted his chin.
The first thing he saw was Potter in a half-torn uniform, who had swung his arm around a lanky, dark-skinned man and staggered back and forth.
The tongue moves and moves till he quivers with lust and then disappears. He hears a quick whispered spell, and not even a second later Draco feels Harry’s thick, lubricated fingers against his entrance.
At 6 o'clock in the morning Draco left the St. Mungo and apparated home. A little weary, he unlocked the door to his small apartment. Last week had been exhausting. Every night he and Anthony had been on duty and so he was all the more looking forward to the day off tomorrow. He neatly put his shoes on the shelf and hung the grey cashmere coat on the wardrobe. He decided to take a hot shower before he went to bed. Last night had knocked him out. This strange curse that hit Potter... Hopefully he would be better tomorrow. He knew that he really shouldn't care. That it was none of his business. Normally his work was done as soon as he had transferred a patient to another ward and finished the paperwork, but somehow it was different now.
In the meantime he also knew a bit more about his colleague. Anthony was 31 years old and had attended a school in Canada. After graduating, he moved to Great Britain, where his mother's family originally came from to study healing. Now he had been at St. Mungo for almost 11 years and had of course witnessed Voldemort's rise and fall and the war very closely here in Great Britain. Also he was not unaware of the role the name Malfoy had played in the whole spectacle. Even though Draco didn't talk much about himself, he felt that he had convinced Anthony with his abilities and his polite manner that there was more in him than the former Death Eater and the son of a convicted criminal. They actually got along quite well. Anthony had a somewhat rude sense of humor that Draco didn't always like (and unfortunately settled with nickname "Blondie"), but he was a good healer and a patient teacher. Maybe they wouldn't become friends for life, but it was an advantage to be in a team with this energetic man. He complemented Draco's sensitivity and precision well.
Exhaustion falls over Draco and he feels a content smile spread across his lips. He closes is eyes and hums as Harry’s finger rake pleasantly through his blonde hair.
. That was one of the reasons he loved to work at the pub every fucking weekend (besides of the obscene amount of tips he made). Rock and punk pumping through his veins, flooding his head and making him forget all the stress in university, the pressure he felt because of his parents’ expectations, the strange glances on his tight jeans and the occasional nail polish. And Harry looked so freaking
The next week went quite well. He had settled in a little, knew where everything was by now and got to know his other colleagues slowly. When he handed Anthony the right utensils on Wednesday before he had even asked for them, he was rewarded with an appreciative look.
Hermione, who wasn't at all surprised to see him here, or rather quick-witted enough to know it didn't matter now, pressed a plain glass bottle with a dark red, clear liquid into his hand.
Shortly afterwards he was carefully lowered into the soft bed and let himself sink onto the pillow, completely exhausted.
“I do, fuck yes!” With a last push the candy cane was all the way inside my hole. The curved part snugged tightly around my heavy balls. “I do daddy!”
Harry snatches his wand from the night table. Experienced from years of Auror training and duty, he sneaks to the window, presses himself against the wall next to it and peaks around the corner. The bedside lamp provides only faint light, but Harry detects a hooded figure on the lawn. Another pebble hits the glass and startles Harry. He raises his wand, spells the window open and sticks his head outside, just as the hooded figure makes a swift movement.
Draco’s finger was back at his entrance, gently massaging Harry’s rim. He didn’t even notice that his back and thighs were tense, until they relaxed more and more. He even felt his rim getting softer under Draco’s hands. It definitely felt pleasant.
Warm hands drove over his bottom cheeks and kneaded them tight. Growling, Draco dug his hands back into the hair, the bun half falling apart in the meantime. He felt his zipper open and groaned in relief as pants and underpants were pulled down and his hard cock finally jumped outside.
Draco’s back arched, his legs trembled as hot white lust shot through his veins, pooling in his groins, orgasm building quickly. Harry groaned low and deep in his throat, clawing one big hand in Draco’s hair and pulling his blond head back to ravish his lips in a sloppy kiss.
Harry glanced back to our friends. They were about 50 metres down the road, buying roast chestnuts, obviously not caring about us.
"Well then, come with me before he throws the whole ward into turmoil," the older healer hummed in surprise.
Harry approaches the bed, pulls Draco down with him and covers them both with the blanket. The blonde man immediately snuggles into Harry’s chest and lets out a relieved sigh.
"You know what the best decision I've made in the last few years has been?," Harry asked. His voice was deep and a little hoarse and a warm shiver ran down Draco's spine. "To come here last night, to you..."
Draco panicked, trying to turn around and flee, but Pansy gripped his naked upper arm (at the same spot she had already punched four times this night) and shoved him back.
"Harry Potter? Wow!" With unconcealed curiosity, Katherine looked more closely at the man on the stretcher. "Well, that's a treat..."
Draco lets his hands slip under Harry’s shirt and feels the warm body under his fingertips. He is obsessed with Harry’s back, the golden tanned skin, the strong muscles, flexing when he moves. Feather-light touches make Harry shiver and Draco lets out a soft moan as the black-haired man intensifies his kisses, without losing the tenderness. Their tongues and lips move together in a proficient dance. With his eyes closed, all Draco could feel was Harry – his warm skin, his strong body, his pelvis pressing against his. They moaned simultaneously as their clothed erections touched.
"I think it was supposed to trigger exactly like it did. Disable the Auror for some time, demoralize and eliminate him. The Italian thing you wrote in the file was certainly just a stupid coincidence. But the panic attacks were real. I think he can go home tomorrow morning. When he can go back to work is the other question. He's still pretty whacked out."
They started working again, Harry set up his guitar, the amplifier and the mic on front of the stage. Then he thought of something.
His patient rolled his eyes. With his stool Draco rolled to the other side of the stretcher to look at Potter's back. Involuntarily he whistled quietly through his teeth. Shocked at himself, he opened his eyes, what Potter of course couldn't see.
" You do that, Benson," Anthony agreed, "it's almost morning and there's nothing more you can do here. We will certainly get your colleague back on track!"
" First of all we gave him a sleeping potion, maybe he will recover by himself. Otherwise you'll have to see how he is tomorrow. Maybe one of the mind healers has to come."
Draco’s mouth was hot and wet, and he quickly began to bop his head up and down, taking the big cock up to the back of his throat every time. Harry’s fingers raked in the white-blonde strands and tightened there, holding Draco in place. His eyes flew open as he felt Draco gently massaging and tugging at his swollen balls and he growled at the delicious sight in front of him. Draco’s naked, slender back was bent, showing of his firm little butt in his tight jeans. His right hand held the base of Harry’s cock, moving in time with his head, the left hand pressed now firmly against his balls and his sensitive perineum. And Draco’s face – gosh – his face… Harry moaned low in his throat, feeling lust and endorphins rushing through his body, when he looked down. Tears spilled from Draco’s glinting grey eyes as he choked again and again on Harry’s twitching dick and some drool drippled out of the corner of his mouth, which was stretched so wide around the girth.
“Yeah, hi. I’m Ron. That’s Seamus and Dean.” He introduced the two young men behind him, a tall guy with dark skin, short cut hair and one golden piercing in his ear and another in his nose and a smaller sturdy bloke with sandy brown hair.
Draco bit his lips and pushed his hips back against his husband. The endless pounding against his prostate brought him to the verge of an intense orgasm. So when Harry finally growled in his ear: “
“I thought I told you not to stay out that late”, Ron grumbled in that accusing voice that always reminded Harry of Ron’s mother Molly.
Draco sat up, his hard dick bobbing in his lap. “Okay then.” He nodded repeatedly to assure himself. “We gonna go with green, yellow and red, is that fine for you?”
Draco looked at Harry, and Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him out of the alley onto the dark street, their breathless laughter echoing through the night.
Ron Weasley, the freckled face still as bland and banal as ever, leaned against the wall next to the window.
With a quiet groan Harry straightened up. Little black dots danced promptly in front of his eyes and he swayed slightly while sitting. Oh no. He had certainly only moved too fast. With a deep breath he tried to calm down, which immediately triggered a violent coughing attack.
As Harry was through the door, Draco let himself fall back against the countertop and buried his head in his hands. Holy shit, this guy was everything he ever dreamed of! The tattoos, the beard, the messy hair bun… How could he possibly survive the night, listening to him playing guitar or drums or bass or whatever it was, that he was doing? Draco always had a thing for musicians, the way they seem to feel the music and rhythm, their hands working their instruments. And what if he was the singer? Damn, Draco had always had a special crush on the all the singers’ voices he had heard in his years in the Black Lion. But this one – Harry – was just a
Potter was still lying in the bed Draco had taken him to the night before. He looked up in surprise as he saw the blonde and lifted his eyebrow.
Harry had been looking forward to replanting the balcony, but now he didn't like to dig in the ground bent over all the time. Again and again he had to snuffle and stretch his aching back. He did the cleaning mechanically and without any frills. Again he swayed slightly and had to hold on to the kitchen unit, but blamed the dizziness on the fumes of the cleaning agents. Yes, the boy who lived twice was a stubborn one.
"I'll be right back," he heard Draco's soft voice and felt slender fingers set his glasses down and run through his pitch-black hair.
“Oh, that’s nice! Isn’t this nice, baby?” He was so cute, when he was excited. Just like a little kid.
Draco choked and puffed into his coffee cup. That couldn't be true. He must have misheard himself. But unfortunately he knew the voice that answered far too well.
A little light fell from the hallway into the bedroom and Draco recognized the broad-shouldered figure in front of him.
And they come, only one second apart, and the world seems to slow down. Draco screams, nearly endlessly he shoots ropes of white onto his stomach. His arse clenches around Harry, who throws his head back and comes deep within his lover.
good. The sun shone softly through the dark curtains and Draco cleaned himself and the bed quickly with a flick of his wand. After a short shower, he prepared himself a cup of coffee and some toast and tomatoes, and read a few articles in the daily prophet that the post-owl had brought to his windowsill in the morning.
Harry stopped for a second before pulling out again and thrusting back in. “Sh, baby boy. You know how much I love your filthy mouth, but you have to be silent. Can you do that for me?”
So, Harry sank on his knees in front of his sleeping boyfriend, leaning forward and dipping the couch seat slightly, getting his face closer to Draco’s plump lips. Just as Harry was about to close his eyes, Draco opened his. Grey stared in green – and then Harry heard a loud high-pitched scream and felt a hot pain shooting through his nose. Harry twitched back and landed on his butt on the floor, groaning and pressing his hand on his throbbing nose. Speechless he glared at a gasping Draco.
“Yes, what?”, Draco asked grinning and normally Harry would have spanked him for that cheekiness, but he felt desperate for that feeling again. “Yes, pleaaaaaaaase”, the word drawing into a moan when Draco firmly pressed against his prostate again.
The boys and I moved down the narrow road towards the pub. Then I noticed, that Harry wasn’t next to me. “Harry?” I turned around. “Harry?!”
“Actually wanked me raw that night…”, Draco muttered under his breath. “Oh, don’t give me that look, Potter”, he added, glaring at Harry’s surprised and amused face. “It was just a
A second and quickly a third fingers snake inside him. It’s so much and not nearly enough. Harry still moves in slow, deep thrusts. But fuck, he’s already so close. All his muscles are taut like a wire and he just
I opened the door to our room and my cock twitched inside my pants. And this time not because he has called me baby. Harry was naked. Well except for his black boxer briefs, but with the way he was bent over, that piece of thin fabric didn’t really make a difference. The sight of his muscular thighs and his round, firm ass made me bite my lip.
Draco was really queasy. What had happened to Harry that he was so scared? At least now he spoke English to them again, which they could probably book as progress.
The black-haired man lifted his hips and Draco swiftly jerked his trousers and pants down at one go. Harry’s dick twitched as he saw Draco licking his lips just as though he wanted to devour all of Harry as quick as possible - which would certainly explain the speed with which Draco practically throwed himself on Harry’s cock and takes him into his mouth all the way till his nose pressed in Harry’s black curls. Harry’s eyes fluttered shut and he moaned, groaning as he heard the delicate choking sounds his boyfriends made.
Granger thoughtfully wrinkled her forehead. "It could be that he thought I had brought him the juice. I usually bring him something I made myself. You know: jam, biscuits, cakes... Once I've brought him apple juice from apples from my parents' garden. It wouldn't be far-fetched to assume that he thought the bottle came from me."
Draco didn't move. He stared at the knob, which he was still holding. This guy was really an outrage, by Salazar! Just to show up at his place like that... Where did he get his address from?
Draco continued in a soft voice: "You know, if this was just a one-time thing for you, say it now. I don't feel like falling in love with you even more, just so you break my heart."
year common room. Harry was skimming trough a quidditch magazine, lazily raking his fingers through my hair.
And yet his cock strained so hard between his legs that he could no longer ignore it. Again he grabbed his bobbing erection and moaned softly as he took it in his hand and slowly began to stroke it up and down.
Draco hurried out of the room with his paperwork and withdrew to the nurse's room to be on the safe side. Luckily it was soon the end of work.
Draco was on his feet as well, obviously surprised by the sudden outburst. Harry grabbed Draco’s slender wrist and pulled him close.
Harry’s eyes feel tired and sore, but his mind is awake. He was stirring and twisting around in bed, feeling itchy and too hot, for about 2 hours. Irritated he gives up on moving from side to side and throws the blanket from his shoulders, leaving it pooling around his knees. He just can’t sleep. So, with the help of a few pillows, he props himself up against the headboard and starts reading, even though he has a hard time concentrating. Already after a few pages his thoughts wander back and forth, but mostly to the man he loves. He wishes nothing more than to be with Draco right now. Sighing softly, he turns the page, the rustling of the paper the only sound in the room – except a gentle tock against the window. Harry’s hands stop moving and he tilts his head. Has he misheard? Another tock wakes up his Auror instincts. There is someone outside the window.
"Well, great," Anthony called. "So he does understand us. And apparently the confusion is slowly diminishing if he still knows where he is."
While pulling off the sheets from the bed and putting a new one on, the young Auror noticed how his arms and shoulders began to hurt again. The effect of the warm shower had already diminished. Although it was a mild 17°C outside and Harry was never cold, he wrapped Draco's thick scarf around his neck before leaving the house for the supermarket. Normally he would have been able to enjoy his boyfriend's divine, masculine scent by now, but his damn nose was far too congested. In the supermarket it was uncomfortably bright and the young man hurried through the frozen food section with his eyes pinched, before beginning to tremble with cold. But it
"Do you have pain?" Draco's voice was now honestly worried. He couldn't bear it at all when his beloved was suffering. "Where?"
Draco reached out one arm and put his slender hand on Harry's forearm. The skin was still warm from sleep and somehow an electric crackling seemed to emanate from the touch.
At first the other remained silent, but then he nodded: "Si!" In the meantime he had calmed down a bit and had stopped whimpering.
It wasn't that Harry was forced to do all this. Draco often said he shouldn't spend so much time and have a cleaner come at least once a week, but Harry was stubborn. He enjoyed taking care of his friend, providing him with a nice home when he came from a long shift in the hospital. And besides, unlike Draco, he was more than used to housework and no longer found it exhausting or humiliating. He even did most of it in Muggle style and with Muggle equipment, although he appreciated some of the tricks Molly had shown him in recent years.
"I happen to visit my best friend, who is apparently not well, you idiot," Weasley countered derogatorily.
Master healer Ferguson stepped into the room and smilingly approached the young man. "Congratulations, my boy. An excellent job you did yesterday with Mr. Potter!"
"I don't know..." Harry mumbled into the pillow and allowed his boyfriend to gently pull the sweaty shirt over his head.
, honey!”, Pansy squealed delighted. “You can cut the tension in the air with a knife!” She grinned, waving her hands to cool her face.
Potter tried and promptly coughed again, his face disorted in pain. He pressed his hand against the freshly repaired rib and gasped in pain. Something was stirring in Draco's stomach. A tiny twinkle only... Was that...
Harry felt his orgasm coming closer, lust pooled in his lower stomach and his pulse sped up. The muscles in his thighs and back tensed, Harry’s eyes closed once again and as Draco swirled his tongue around his glans once again, Harry came hard. He groaned long and low and shot his hot cum in Draco’s still eagerly sucking mouth. After what felt like an eternity, Harry loosened his hand in the blond hair and Draco released his now flaccid cock with a wet pop. Unabashedly he wiped the back of his hand over his swollen lips and smirked at Harry, who was still panting.
But the blonde was not stupid. With two big steps of his long legs he was at the former Gryffindor, put an index finger under Harry's chin and looked him in the face.
! I'm cooommmming..." Draco screamed and clung to the tabletop. He pushed his butt back, so that Harry hit his prostate even harder and after only three more deep shocks he spilled his cum on the table top with a husky scream.
And Harry means it. After all these years of enmity in school, they both came back after the war as different persons to go on the 8
Harry nodded shakily. Then he exhaustedly dropped his head back onto the headrest and stared at the ceiling. "I'm so sick of these nightmares," he growled annoyed. "As if the usual ones weren't enough. After this strange spell they have become even worse."
Draco sighed deeply and ran his hand through his fair hair, "We both know what it's like to be scared – scared to death. And I know exactly what it's like when you can't tell anyone, when there's nobody there to listen to you... Well..." He let the word float vaguely in the room.
“By the way”, Draco snarled, now completely missing the tone of worry in his voice, after finding out, that Harry wasn’t seriously injured. “Weren’t you supposed to have better reflexes? I mean – being an
Potter winked at her. "You know I don't feel well if I don't nibble on your wonderful cookies at least once a month, Gladys."
The young healer let the sleeping man float on a mobile stretcher and pushed him through the many hallways and corridors to the ward for curse damage. Draco didn't know why, but somehow he felt he had to take care of Harry himself. How he had clung to him earlier... As if (of all things)
"Okay, Harry. You're doing great," Draco continued calmly, trying to be professional. "Do you know who I am?"
A long-drawn sigh escaped my lips, as Harry pulled out the candy cane. His other hand was firm on my butt, kneading the pale flesh.
He pressed his full lips on my skin and purred like a cat. I winced as he pulled put and slumped next to me, pulling me tight against his body.
“Thanks, baby!” Harry rolled his eyes, which earned him a swat on his chest. “I just wanted to try? Of course, I didn’t know a thing about lube and prepping and stuff. Since you can imagine, I never really had ‘the talk’, especially not about gay sex! So…”
“The guy I nearly ran over?”, Harry called back. “This blonde handsome boy with ridiculously long legs and an arse to
"Great idea", Anthony intervened now. "Draco, you take over from here and I'll go get a nice hot cuppa coffee." With these words he rose.
The healer placed his message next to Harry on the mattress, stroked the black-haired man's head again with a feather-light touch and then hurriedly left the house.
“Yeah… And then when Ginny and I got together, naturally I was the one topping. I liked it, I liked being dominant. But you know Ginny!” Harry chuckled. “She’s definitely
Draco’s heart nearly beat out of his chest. In a last attempt to pull himself together, he reminded himself of his usual flirty posturing and smiled wide, knowing that his grey eyes will flash.
Harry slowly sinks down, his half-hard cock still buried deep in Draco. His breath is fast as he nuzzles in the crook of Draco’s neck.
Draco on him. His fingers, his lips, his tongue made his stomach tingle with lust. Draco had one hand in his cock, slowly massaging the hard flesh and his other hand caressed his balls. Harry hummed as Draco licked his cock, slightly sucking on the head and only flinched a bit, when his lover’s hand moved, and warm fingers brushed his hole.
"And yet you still waited patiently until the end of work," Draco snarled mockingly. " Gee, Potter, that's so gryffindor of you. How noble..."
Panting and trembling Draco wakes up. Harry. Harry. Harry. Just one word floods through his numb brain, still struggling to escape the cold of the nightmare. Harry. Draco curls his slender body like a cat, feels the cold sweat on his chest and neck. Harry. He’s not there. He’s alone. He can’t sleep, when he’s alone. He even has nightmares
With one swift movement Harry was back on his feet, pressing his chest against Draco’s and ravishing his lips in a wild kiss. Draco’s aching cock rubbed against Harrys jeans and he rutted against it, searching for friction.
Finally he tore his gaze back and looked at me. His smile was genuine, and just a tiny bit sad. “Yeah, I’m okay.” His warm hand tenderly cupped my cheek. “You look beautiful, you know that?” And then he kissed me. His lips were so soft and hot and Merlin, I could do this all night long.
, that was the hottest stuff I’ve ever seen. But it was also the summer after Sirius died and – well, let’s say I really had an emotional roller coaster that summer.”
Draco looked down at his chest and knew what Harry meant. He had got used to it long ago and had come to terms with it in the meantime, although they were a painful memento of his past, which he wanted to leave behind forever. But Harry saw these scars for the first time. Although it had been him who had inflicted them in a flooded girls' toilet in 6th grade. Fine white lines were drawn all over Draco's upper body and shimmered slightly in the light.
“Damn, you got me hard all afternoon, baby”, he cooed, pressing the clear evidence of this statement into my thigh.
"By all the gods, what?" Draco's knees trembled as he felt a sassy finger stroke light as a feather over his dripping glans.
Finally, his lecture was over! Draco packed up his notes and his MacBook, said goodbye to Blaise, who just woke up from his dozy mid-lecture-nap and left the building of the Architectural Association School Of Architecture on Bedford Square. He had to hurry, the band would arrive at 4 p.m. and the underground was packed with commuters and tourists.
Draco sensed how good it was for him. His upset heart calmed down and his anger finally ebbed away as he ended his routine with a ten-minute meditation. As the blonde lifted his slender body from the mat again, he reassured himself in a calm voice that Potter was an idiot and he hopefully wouldn't see him again so soon in the emergency room.
Harry’s green eyes are soft, as he leans forward. Draco feels the rough stubble against his chin and then sinfully soft lips on his. Harry’s kiss is sweet, warm and full of love.
“Yes, Si-iiiiiirrr uugghhn!” Draco’s whispered answer turned into a moan, as Harry found his prostate, pressing hard against this little bundle of nerves.
Soon they both stood in the spacious shower cubicle with shaky legs and let warm water run over their bodies. Draco enjoyed the closeness of the other. He ran his hands through Harry's thick hair and pressed a gentle kiss on his mouth. The Auror sighed softly and moved his lips against the Draco's. Tenderly caressing hands stroked over Draco's body, caressing the places they had touched so hard before. A pleasant shiver ran down his back.
We both panted and gasped, completely spent and exhausted. My muscles shivered and I sank down, Harry now on top of me, breathing fast gushs of hot air against my neck.
"So, and now the lungs. They got quite compressed at your fall. I will relieve them again. Just imagine it, like a somewhat limp balloon that you blow up again, yeah?"
When the young healer fetched a coffee in the lounge on Friday afternoon in a quiet moment and allowed himself two minutes of peace, he heard the loud laughter of the reception witch from the reception area.
Draco nodded and caressingly let his fingers glide over Harry’s scalp. The young man closed his eyes. “And I found porn.” Draco’s hand stilled. He could literally see him smirk even with his eyes closed. Harry had introduced Draco to the internet about a year ago. To
He kicked against the back of his sofa and gasped as he felt the stabbing pain in his toe. Growling, he jumped around on one leg until the throbbing had subsided. Then he dropped onto the next chair and stared angrily at the ceiling. Harry,
Draco sat on Potter's hip, one leg on each side and pinned his chest with his forearm to the stretcher. He didn't care that he was in contact with sweat and vomit. His colleagues each took one leg and both arms to keep the Auror calm. Draco himself grabbed Harry's bearded jaw with a firm hand and squeezed to open his mouth. A violent blow to the back almost knocked him forward as Potter tore one leg loose and tried to tear to his chest in his seizure.
And then I didn’t need to wait anymore. I finally felt a new gush of lube wet my loose hole and without warning, Harry shoved two fingers inside me. I screamed at the sudden burning pleasure and threw my head up again. Immediately a hand gripped my blond hair and held me in that position. My head bent back, my back arched, my ass pressed against Harry's hand. Just for a second he gave me time to accustom to his fingers, then he began to thrust relentlessly into my tight hole.
It had not escaped the blonde man's attention that Anthony Young's face darkened briefly at the mention of his surname. But quickly the tall man put on a polite smile and the two shook hands.
that Draco's heart almost stopped. A tingling and crackling seemed to run through all his veins and the blood was rushing in his ears. They didn't move or make any noise, as if they both felt how fragile the whole thing was between them. After what felt like an eternity, perhaps just a few seconds, Harry detached his lips from Dracos and, with his eyes still closed, leaned his forehead against the blonde's.
“Don’t”, Harry panted. “I wanna hear you!” Little kitten licks now danced over my hole and I nearly lost my mind.
"Anyway I only came to you because I wanted to apologize for my behavior the other day. The invitation was your idea," he added with a little grin.
Sniffling loudly Draco rubs his watering eyes and wipes his hair from his sweaty forehead. He tries to take deep breaths to calm himself down, but his clenching heart won’t stop hurting. Slowly Draco sits up and wraps the blanket around himself even though it isn’t cold. The streetlamp down the street outside the high window casts a dim orange light into the room and Draco looks around at the wild and colourful paintings Luna has drawn and the nightstand and bookshelf out of the same dark walnut wood. His clothes lie neatly folded on the comfy leather armchair together with is wand. Draco bites his lips. He thinks about the last conversation he and Harry had, just before he left.
But neither of the two former Hogwarts students wanted to talk about their - how could you put it nicely? - tense relationship. They looked at each other suspiciously.
year of Hogwarts. As McGonagall announced that they had to share a dorm in order to “reinforce inter-house unity”, Harry thought that this was the worst thing that could have happened to him. Until he realised it wasn’t. It was in fact the start of a new beginning, with gently thriving friendships at first, awkward dates after a few months and finally a big declaration of love in the Great Hall near the end of term. The results of this memorable day were a blushing Draco, cheering and whistling students, and a nearly broken ankle, as Harry fell from the table, he was standing on.
They remained silent for a while and Draco was already thinking that Harry would never tell him, when the black-haired guy took a deep breath: "It was an absolutely disgusting feeling. I was clear on one side, I knew I was in St. Mungo and everything, but somehow the other half of my brain was gone. I had these seizures with terrible hallucinations and visions. It was almost worse than back then, you know, at the battle."
Harry had crossed his legs and put his elbow on the armrest. Tiredly, he had supported his head on his hand. One could clearly see that he hadn't slept much the last few nights.
"More, please, more," the blonde gasped and threw his head back when a second finger joined him and pushed him hard. Quickly Harry's fingers fucked him and Draco clung to the shelf next to him, looking for support. It was incredible. He was so painfully hard and thick drops of pre-come trickled to the floor.
"Of course he only comes to visit me," cooed Gladys, the elderly reception witch, cheerfully as she whooshed in that moment and brought Potter's file.
Harry grinned as Draco’s hands run through his black locks and the blonde bend down and tilted his head to press a loving and wet kiss on Harry’s lips without touching his nose. Draco’s body was warm and lithe in his lap and Harry let his hands slip under Draco’s shirt, slowly stroking up and down his back.
"You... so you can remember everything from that night?" he asked and thought with horror about how he had undressed Potter... Harry... and stroked his cheek!
Draco cleared his throat. "I think you were about to explain why you were lying half-naked in my bed again."
Next to healer Jones stood a tall man with broad shoulders and short brown hair. Unlike the Master healer, he wore the emblem of an advanced healer, only a few degrees above Draco, which calmed him down.
With half-opened eyes Draco looked down. What he saw was absolutely divine. Harry Potter kneeled in front of him with dishevelled hair and naked torso, looking at his bobbing member with outrageous enthusiasm.
"Shit, you look hot," the black haired man muttered between the countless kisses he now scattered on Draco's upper body. Red swollen lips left a wet trail across the smooth chest and the slim belly and Draco's breath went faster and faster the deeper the other got.
Draco assisted Anthony all the time, but they didn't talk much to each other. At the end of his first shift, when the two sat in the dressing room, a little exhausted and eagerly drinking water, the blonde man felt that his counterpart was looking at him in mild disdain. That was enough for Draco. Already some time ago he had decided to no longer endure the eternal taunting and the pejorative glances.
The next day at 8 a.m. there was a knock at the door of Treatment Room No. 4, as the two healers had just started working through the pile of paperwork on their desks. A small, plump man with a bushy grey beard stuck his head through the door. Draco immediately recognized the lime green robe and the golden badge on his chest. That was Edward Ferguson, the head healer of the department of poisoning by potions and poisonous plants! Draco's heart gave a jerk.
Pansy rolled her eyes in the exact moment the last song ended with a guitar solo and a loud cheering applause from the crowd.
“Anything for you, daddy”, Draco murmured as he moved his way down Harry’s muscular body. “Just lean back and enjoy.”
That damn stubborn voice in the back of his head, wondering why he was reacting so violently, the blonde just tried to blend out. Potter just knew how to push his buttons, how to get his old rival on the the edge of a tantrum. So he hadn't changed. Draco felt something like regret flooding his stomach and immediately decided to drink a glass of wine even though it was only 4 pm.
The story takes place about 6-7 years after the battle. Draco Malfoy, our favourite Slytherin is 24 years old now and has just finished his training as a healer in St. Mungo. The time after the war was not easy for him. 5 months he had sat in Askaban and waited for his hearing. Meanwhile his father was sentenced. And Draco could not blame the magical society. Even though he had not fought in the end and had remained rather forced in the ranks of the Death Eaters, his deeds had been so severe that he had been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Draco did not miss him very much. The change of heart that had brought him to his senses since he was 17 years old was also accompanied by a strong feeling of aversion to his father and his madness of power, pure blood and black magic.
Harry lowered his gaze and nodded. Again a dizzy feeling went through his aching head and he quickly clung to Draco's broad shoulders.
Rolling is eyes, Draco finally waved his wand, to stop the bleeding and vanish the blood from Harrys face and shirt. Carefully dabbing with his thump, he wiped at the small amount of blood that still clung to Harry’s beard.
"I think you' re also a great benefit to the ER. I congratulated your chief healer Jones directly on her recruitment. Such smart guys are always needed."
Harry still stood in the doorway, staring behind the blond, slender man in these tight jeans who looked so freakishly handsome. Who was that?
Harry pressed a wet kiss against my left ass cheek. “When we come home, you’ll have to be nice and loose and ready for your daddy’s hard cock. Okay, baby?”
A soft smile played around Harry's full lips and he rubbed his bearded chin. "You're probably right."
Brushing his white-blond hair out of his forehead, Draco arrived in front of the Black Lion. A group of 3 guys around 24/25 years packed with instruments, amplifiers and backpacks already waited for him. Draco tried to pull himself together and not show his obvious annoyance.
He had to stick this Bezoar in Harry's throat! Again he leaned on the Auror' s muscular chest, which was already soaked in sweat that and forcibly opened his jaw. With lightning speed Draco stuck the knobbly stone into his mouth and pressed the lips of the other man together again. At first nothing happened. Potter was still trembling and for a moment Draco was afraid he had done something wrong and made a mistake. But then under his body he noticed that the cramps of the dark-haired man subsided. Also the hoarse screaming became less and at the end he only whimpered softly, his eyes closed, his face still pale.
And then the magic started. Without saying another word, Harry hit the strings of his guitar and music vibrated through the pub, making Draco’s hair on his arms lift. It was loud and blasting, full of heavy but melodic guitars, harsh drums and rhythmic bass lines.
Once again wiping the tears from his grey eyes, Draco stands up. His watch on the nightstand shows 1:00 a.m. He feels cold and numb and longing just for one thing. Slowly he gets dressed. The hoodie is way too big for him and smells like Harry. This is no help.
Draco greeted them with a cursory wave and rummaged for the bar’s key. “Sorry for being a bit late, I had a course.”
With one eye looking for his strongest painkillers and one eye on his phone checking Ron’s increasingly annoyed messages, Harry headed to the bathroom.
Draco had finally settled. Sure, he had his bigger and smaller problems with his past every so often, but he had survived. The strict, violent patriarchy of his father, the moods of his aunt Bellatrix, living with Death Eaters and the most powerful black wizard in recent history, and a war that still today frightened him in some nights bathed in sweat.
The rest of tonight’s team arrived in the next half of an hour, Pansy already talking about the good-looking boys she saw outside the pub drinking beer in the moment she joined Draco behind the bar.
“They’re tonight’s band, you say?”, she asked, tapping beer for the first guests who arrived. “My, my, they’re some fine treats!”
Just as he was in the middle of cooking, he heard the soft swooshing in the fireplace, announcing that Draco had flooed to the living room.
Draco could now take a better look at them. In the dim light of the pub he could see something like a big stag on a glade, designed in black and white and geometrical lines. And on the back of his hand there was a delicate lily stretching from his wrist to his fingers. The other things Draco couldn’t see, but in all it looked beautiful.
And then, without a warning, I felt the cane grow. Yes, grow. It fucking expanded in my hole. I moaned. I felt fuller and fuller every second.
Draco feels dizzy and clear at the same time. He sees Harry moving slowly on top of him, feels his cock sliding in and out of him. The pressure against his prostate is back, making him leak precome on his stomach. Green eyes above him, divine smell around him, strong body on top of him… This is just the perfect place to be.
Draco buries his face in Harry’s chest. “I missed you so much”, he mumbles, happily inhaling the familiar smell. “Gosh, you’re so warm.”
Lately he hadn't been able to go out as much because of his new position. And so he had had to help himself from time to time with his own hand - and with the vibrator lying in his bedside drawer. A small stubborn voice in the back of his head kept telling him that these constant one-night stands and the occasional (or frequent) masturbation were not adequate substitutes for closeness and love and could not fill the void Draco felt from time to time. But it was fun anyway.
soft lips. Carefully he moved his mouth. A feeling of happiness flowed through him as he noticed how his kiss was reciprocated. The kiss was slow and gentle and so absolutely
In the locker room, Draco quickly slipped into his new white robes decorated with red darts on the seams, chest, shoulders and back. "It makes me look like a ghost," he thought as he looked at his pale face in the mirror.
(Did you know, that angst is originally a german word? Thanks to my native language for all the pain we feel and the tears we shed... Germany, huh.. A country full of optimists...)
“That’s your punishment for running away, baby!”, Harry laughs, Draco’s delighted squeaking is music to his ears.
Harry hid his face in his hands, his ears glowing out of embarrassment over his juvenile rashness. “I tried it with the handle of my brush. Without preparing or any lube.”
! First, you wouldn't survive 10 minutes in the emergency room and second, you don't have to interfere when I do my job, which I'm
They stood there for a while, gasping for air and trying to calm their pounding hearts. Standing there in the alley behind the pub where they first met, where Harry fell in love with Draco’s eyes and Draco fell in love with Harry’s everything. They slowly got dressed again, smiling lazily, exchanging tender kisses and loving hugs, fully captivated by the situation and the afterglows of a phenomenal orgasm.
And then he screams. His eyes once again fly open by surprise as he feels something tight and wet around his leaking cock. Harry has now buried three fingers inside his slick hole and swallows his rock-hard cock down to the hilt.
“Aww, poor baby”, Draco teased, yelping when Harry poked him in the ribs. “So, you had a rather bad first experience?”
aware of was the pounding headache in his temples. With a groan he tried to open his eyes. He managed to open his right one half. Not bad for the first attempt after a night like this. White stars appeared before his eye and he was quick to close it again. How could that have happened? He only had… 5? Oh, wait!
"At least the Italian is gone", grumbled the Auror Benson, relieved. Until then he had watched helplessly as his colleague was treated. "Should I just come back tomorrow?"
Harry’s mouth is on his slender neck, licking and sucking and biting the soft skin there. “I’m gonna reward you, love. You’ve been so good. You deserve it. You deserve everything in the world.”
“Hi”, he said and his voice was like liquid honey. All the embarrassed awkwardness from a few hours ago was washed away and replaced with a confident white-teethed smile and a flirty look.
Draco's mother was acquitted before the wizard gamot. Harry Potter had testified for her in this lengthy process and told how she had saved his life and lied to Lord Voldemort at the most crucial moment. Draco couldn't help but be eternally grateful to Harry Potter, Harry Potter of all people. In contrast to his father, he loved his mother, who had always been a very gentle and loving woman, who had only got into the wrong circles and the wrong family.
So Draco let the young Auror float on the fresh bed. He hesitated, then he took off his shoes. Harry would surely sleep for a while, then he really didn't have to lie unnecessarily uncomfortable. Actually, patients who couldn't do it themselves were made ready for bed by the nurses and healers in the internship. But it was the middle of the night and the wards were not fully staffed anymore. With a wave of the wand he let Harry float a hand's width over the bed. Draco's slender fingers moved towards Harry's upper body almost by themselves. A little shaky, he shoved the cape of his uniform from the black-haired man's broad shoulders. Then he opened the buttons of his shirt and took it off carefully but routinely. A tight white T-shirt now covered the well-trained chest and Draco noticed to his own horror that he licked his lips involuntarily. But there was nothing to it, was there? He had done that thousands of times during his training... Only the patients he had undressed so far had not been his former enemies from school -
“I love you so much, babe.” Harry’s voice is low and warm. He spreads little kisses over Draco’s thighs, until he twitches impatiently.
me!”, Draco screamed. He gently took Harry’s hand from his nose to take a look at the damage he had caused. Draco gasped as he saw the thick droplets of ruby-coloured liquid dripping out of Harry’s left nostril, running over his upper lip towards his stubbly chin.
"You are such a stubborn git, Potter," Draco grumbled lovingly and dipped the washcloth back into the cold water.
"Potter, shut the fuck up." The words were much softer than Draco had ever said them and before he knew what was happening he felt soft, full lips on his own.
"Change quickly, you can take the empty locker down there on the right. Then come out and I'll take you to Mr. Young, who'll take care of everything else."
Only now had he noticed the brunette young witch in the blue blouse standing by the nurse wringing her hands. A blurred image of a small fist dashing towards his nose suddenly came to Draco's mind. He shook his head. While his three colleagues were taking care of Potter, he quickly turned to Hermine Granger.
The latter shook his head in disbelief. "Merlin, Gryffindor, you're crackers! You belong in bed this instant!"
Draco didn't hear the rest of the conversation, so he didn't know what had happened or where Gladys sent Potter. But when Anthony shouted through the hallway only a minute later: “Hey, Blondie! Come on! There’s work to do”, the former Slytherin already had an unpleasant hunch.
Draco wrapped his lips around Harry’s hard cock and Harry involuntarily lifted his hips. He always had been a sucker for… well… for Draco’s sucking skills. But lithe hands kept him down, pressing his hip and caressing his thighs. They stroked along the side of his ass, under his upper thighs, gently lifting Harry’s legs up, so that he bent his knees and planted his feet left and right from Draco’s shoulders.
After the quill had written the last sentence, Draco grabbed the piece of parchment and quietly opened the bedroom door again. Gentle light came through the thick curtains and Draco saw Harry lying on his stomach, his arms wrapped around the blanket and his head buried in Draco's pillow. Draco stepped closer to the bed. The former Gryffindor looked really beautiful, as peaceful and relaxed as he hadn't seen him in a long time. The long hair fell into his forehead and Draco carefully stroked a strand behind his ear. Harry sighed briefly, but didn't move. He had to be really exhausted. And Draco was glad to see that he apparently got some sleep here.
Ron’s voice yanked me out of my blissful doze. I had my head buried in Harry’s lap, cuddling into the soft fabric of his sweatpants as we were sitting on my favourite couch in the 8
Draco rolled his eyes. "You can see that, Potter. And I see that you still have a penchant to hurt yourself."
"Oh my, chills too," Draco muttered more to himself and laid his slender hand soothingly on Harry's reddened cheek.
“Okay, Harry.” Draco smiled as he saw, how Harry’s eyes lit up, as he heard Draco using his first name. “If you need anything –
Draco woke up way too soon when something touched his arm. He jerked up and his hand twitched to his wand on the bedside table.
“Can you maybe…?” Harry gestured down to his crotch, where his cock has softened a little bit at the unfamiliar intrusion.
“What?! That’s – what?!”, Draco gasped in an embarrassing high-pitched tone. Great, that would already be the second time tonight.
He helped me pull my pants back on and kissed me once again. No need to say that I didn’t feel cold anymore. I felt pretty much on fire.
Draco quickly disappeared into the bathroom and digged a little in his cupboard with the remedies. Triumphantly he pulled a small bottle with light blue contents from a corner and hurried back to Harry, who had started to tremble despite his hot head.
Placing a soft kiss against Draco’s inner thigh, right under his balls, made the blonde’s cock twitch in interest. “Fuck you, Harry. Just tell me!”
"Very quick thinking and good usage of the bezoar! And your potion was really excellent! I was very excited when I examined the antidote this morning. Arsenic is a very special poison, not everyone would have figured it out so quickly."
“Uhm, no, I think, we’re good.” Harry frowned and scratched the back of his neck, flexing his arm muscles and moving the tattoos.
"We should give him something for a dreamless sleep and then just check on him again when he wakes up," the former Slytherin suggested.
Draco’s breath calms down as Harry entirely withdraws his skilled fingers and climbs up the bed, his body pressing hot and strong against Draco’s.
Harry felt something warm and wet on his upper lip and as he took his hand down to look at it, he saw light red blood.
Draco quickly performed a diagnostic spell on Potter's maltreated back, indicating that something was wrong with the left ribs and both lungs.
"I hallucinated that all the people I love would be tortured and tormented until they finally turned against me because Voldemort convinced them that I was to blame for their suffering. And I saw all of their dead or injured bodies, screaming for help."
"Darling, that's all right... I'm with you..." He gently stroked his friend, who only opened his eyes again after a minute.
And in fact, when Draco opened the door to their treatment room, he looked directly into a pair of very familiar green eyes. That was a good thing, because otherwise Draco almost wouldn't have recognized the former Gryffindor sitting on his treatment couch. His black hair was longer than ever and he had loosely tied it to a high bun. In addition, Draco had never seen Potter with a beard. But now his bronze skin was covered in a dark 2-week beard. The dark blue and golden uniform with the emblem of the aurors fitted very tight to his body. His chest had clearly become broader, his arms more muscular. Damn, he could have directly come out of one of those hipster magazines.
– just come to me.” And with a cheeky wink and a slight touch on Harry’s forearm, Draco turned around, heart thumping like crazy.
Angrily he grabbed his coffee cup from the dining table and threw it against the wall, where it burst into a thousand pieces.
Yoga! Yoga and wine would calm his nerves. He poured himself half a glass of chilled Chardonnay and changed his tight cloth trousers and his button-up shirt to a yoga leggings and a soft T-shirt. Routinely he went through his exercises, bent himself, breathed, stretched his back, balanced, relaxed, sweated - and occasionally sipped on his glass.
A finger lay under his pointed chin and gently lifted his head. Draco looked into this beautiful face and tensed his shoulders, getting ready for the inevitable rejection.
Draco's fingers trembled slightly as he put the key into the lock and unlocked it. It was quiet. No sound was heard. He went into the living room - empty. He went into the kitchen. Only a rinsed cup on the draining board of the sink indicated that someone had been there at all. Otherwise no sign of Harry.
"Harry's colleagues are investigating the case, but they don't have much hope of getting any clues about the sender. They found some feathers and see if they can get on with it."
In the afternoon the two got visitors again, who had nothing to do with a medical emergency. At a timid knock, a bushy brown head slid through the door.
She led Draco, who was still pushing Harry in front of him, into a small free room along the corridor and handed him the obligatory paperwork. The blonde Slytherin sighed in relief as a bell rang and a patient from another room demanded Katherine's attention.
"Aargh, fuck, yes," he screamed. Three fingers were now pushing into his wet hole and pushed deeper and deeper until they hit his prostate. Draco closed his eyes and screamed. With fast movements Harry widened Draco's tight hole, who almost lost its mind when he also noticed the black haired guy biting his butt tenderly.
Harry grinned up to him, his teeth glowing white in the dim, filthy alley and Draco was flooded with lust and need, as Harry gripped the base of his rock-hard cock and licked over the shiny head, keeping eye contact with Draco.
Harry’s voice had been low and a tiny bit sad and his hug was so warm and comfy, and Draco had known that nothing in this world could harm him, as long as he has the love of his life with him. But Harry is gone now, and Draco has nightmares and feels miserable and he just wants – no, he
In a flash the collapsed body straightened up and with a gasp Harry opened his eyes at the same time and in panic he looked back and forth with wide eyes.
"It was actually as I had thought. He found the bottle on the kitchen counter, I was in the toilet, he thought I brought the juice, so he drank it."
“Oh, shut up”, Draco grumbled, feeling his cheeks heating up. He took a last glance towards the stage. Harry smiled at him.
Suddenly Harry had got up again and gasped excitedly. Still burying his fingers in Draco's ass, he pushed him by the back to the dining table, which he had freed from plates and glasses with a flick of his wand. A strong hand in Draco's neck pressed him down against the tabletop and Draco howled disappointed as the fingers were pulled out. But what he now felt against his widened hole was better - much better. Slowly a huge, rock-hard cock pushed into him. Draco had the feeling to tear, but at the same time he was more wanton than ever.
Draco grinned. “My boss’s a wanker. So just go ahead and grab a beer or two.” Ron laughed. “I’ll be back around 6 p.m. My colleagues will arrive at 6:30 p.m. and we’ll open at 7 p.m., alright?”
Draco sighed heavily. “If you guys promise me to behave, leave nobody in and don’t plunder the booze rack, then I will leave you alone for a minute to head home to freshen up.”
"Shit," Harry mumbled and stared at the light skin in horror. "Shit Draco, I never wanted that! I'm sorry! I never would have -" He broke off and looked at the blonde man with desperate eyes.
Pansy makes her way back to the bedroom and snatches her muggle mobile phone from the nightstand. She dials Ron’s number, biting her nails while waiting for the redhead to pick up.
"That sounds damn good," Draco replied quietly and kissed Harry's scar on his forehead. "And a little love I can really use right now."
In his bedroom Draco slipped out of his clothes and threw them into the laundry basket next to the dark wardrobe. Naked as he was, he stretched his sinewy muscles a little. He really had to do more sports again. He had neglected that a bit in the last weeks. Believe it or not, Draco Malfoy had discovered
“You know who’s in control, right love?” His question was more of a harsh statement and Draco nodded quickly, closing his eyes as the pain and the pleasure grew
After I found my friends and told them about our plans, I wanted to get dressed and moved to my room. Our room. The place that brought us together, actually. When we came back to our 8
Draco whined a bit when Harry pulled back eventually. He propped himself up against the headboard, long legs crossed. “You wanna tell me now?”
Draco finally found the right key and helped the boys carrying their equipment into the gloomy bar room.
“So, how come that you wanna try it then?”, Harry whispered in Draco’s soft skin and felt the other man’s bollocks tightening against his lips.
Harry's voice was rough and trembled with effort. Even though it didn't seem possible, he took on even more speed and banged me so hard, that his balls beat violently against my firm bottom.
instruments.” Harry rolled his eyes. “And he was actually quite talkative. Until you showed up.” Ron’s eyes were sparkling with amusement. “He just went home to take a shower and eat something before his shift tonight. So tonight, you’ll get a pretty, freshly showered, blonde…”
The blonde got serious again. "If anything is going on, you can always come to me, yeah? And now I really have to sleep, it's quite late."
A spark of anger stirred in Draco. This woman was really unbelievable. It was a miracle that she had passed her exams!
He heard a choking and immediately saw the dark red, foamy vomit on the couch and on Potter's upper body. And then Draco knew what it was. His three colleagues were just trying to give the screaming and groaning auror venous access for a cramp-relieving and pain-relieving potion, but the black haired man trembled so terribly that they had trouble keeping his arm straight.
year, it was horrible at first. I was broken after the war. And so was Harry. But together we somehow managed to pick up the pieces and assemble them. We became friends along the way. And then about 3 weeks ago, the sexual tension between us (that might have actually started about
He stroked his smooth chest, his flat stomach with its many fine scars until his fingers touched the arch of his now semi-erected dick. Pictures of Potter, no Harry, appeared before his inner eye. The tanned skin, the trained upper body, the flexing muscles under this dragon tattoo and what was showing through his shorts. Draco gasped slightly as he felt that he was now getting really hard. His fingers glided briefly over the shiny glans and then pulled his hand away.
The curry Harry had cooked came from a recipe book of his grandmother's that he  found in Godric's Hollow. It tasted delicious, but Draco was somehow too nervous to eat more than a small plate of it.
Draco waved his hand impatiently. Harry shuffled forward and lay down next to his boyfriend, his head placed on his milky white thighs. He felt gentle hands raking through his long black hair where it was not tied up in a bun.
Coughing, he dragged himself up to the second floor of the small multiple dwelling on the outskirts of London and stowed away the groceries, only to march back down to the cellar and hang up the meanwhile clean laundry to dry. Fortunately, none of his neighbors were in the small laundry room, so he could hang the clothes on a leash with the help of his wand. It wasn't as neat as usual, but whatever.
“Don’t know”, I mumbled, trying to hide my head under Harry’s absurdly large hoodie, not wanting to show that I kind of like the idea of me and him, wandering in the snow, holding hands, drinking hot cocoa. I nibbled his soft, tanned skin.
But the Auror was emotionally in a bad condition. He was a nervous wreck and still so anxious that Draco had to send Anthony to get the sleeping potion (which was actually his specialty), because Harry whimpered and trembled even more when the blonde man got up or otherwise moved away from him.
Harry couldn't take it any more either. His legs almost buckled and he clawed his fingernails into Draco's side as he came in with a deep moan in the blonde.
Carefully he tried to squirm out of Harry's grip and slipped smoothly under his arm and leg and hurried into the bathroom. While he was quickly freshening up (there was no time for a shower), he quietly dictated to a quill and a leaf of parchment a message for the sleeping man in his bed.
Draco sighed. “Fine”, he said, like it would be his enormous mercy to drop the subject. He leaned back in his chair, long legs crossed gracefully. He inclined his head to take another sip, eyes still at Harry, full of faked innocence. “Or are you just afraid…”
"Potter, you're glowing!" Draco put his cool hand on the hot, sweaty forehead of his friend. "What do you think you're doing here? Did you still do the whole household?" he asked in a stern voice.
"Since I rescued you and we realized that we were on the same side for good... And don't distract me. I asked you a question."
The young Auror settled down on the sofa and Draco quickly slipped into the bath and then into his bedroom. Merlin, he was tired. It was already half past one in the night and tomorrow he had to be at work again at 9 o'clock. He undressed, slightly stumbling, but stopped at his underpants. Should anything happen during the night, at least he didn't want to be naked. He got into bed yawning and let himself sink into the soft pillows. He had just pulled the blanket up to his chin, when he had already fallen asleep.
He heard a spitting sound and something wet wiping against his fluttering opening. Then he heard Harrys belt and zipper, another spitting sound and finally – finally! – Harry’s huge cock found his way between Draco’s cheeks and in his saliva-lubed hole.
The young Auror opposite him put his water glass, from which he was about to drink, down again and looked straight into his eyes. His gaze was hard to read and Draco had to look aside quickly to avoid getting lost in this bright emerald green.
The brunette witch laughed briefly. "But Harry and Ginny have been separated for over 3 years! Ginny is now with Luna Lovegood and Harry... it's none of your business, but Harry isn't only interested in women anymore..."
He bit his lower lip, letting his gaze wander over the other man’s body. Harry must have taken off his leather jacket, now showing trained, tattooed arms and a broad chest in a grey-black striped T-Shirt. His tight dark jeans were loosely tucked in a pair of worn black DocMartens boots. His gaze just stopped a second on Harrys crotch, wondering if he was really not wearing any pants underneath.
Draco watched the black haired man take off his robe and unbutton his shirt. A tanned, muscular chest was revealed, a light oval was visible in the middle of the smooth skin, where the Horcrux had burned in (of course Draco knew the story, he was not living behind the moon). The young Auror winced a little as he stretched his arms to strip the shirt and again Draco could not help the scornful commentary:
After the meeting, the young healers made their way to their wards. Draco took the elevator down to the ground floor and directly behind the door of the emergency room he was welcomed by a resolute but good-natured looking master healer with short black and white hair.
Harry took his hands down to slap his lover’s arm. “Stop laughing! It was terrible!”, Harry growled.
The blonde cleared his throat. "Um, I was just admiring your bruises, especially here on the left ribs. Very nice pattern."
Draco got up so quickly that his chair fell to the ground behind him, clattering. He threw himself at the smaller one and let their mouths crash against each other. Two hands clawed into the front of his shirt and Draco buried both hands in the black silky waves. Yesterday was nothing compared to today. The passion with which Harry pressed on him and hogged his lips and tongue took Draco's breath away. He gasped and dropped his head backwards and gave a slight groan as he felt Harry kissing his neck and sucking on the sensitive skin.
Draco's heart beat almost out of his chest as he lifted Harry's blanket and moved closer. The smaller man lifted his head and his long black hair tickled Draco's naked arm as he slipped it between his neck and mattress. He felt Harry's big hand on his own ribs and moved his slender fingers onto Harry's back at the same time. Harry now lay a little lower than himself and placed his face against Draco's naked chest. He felt the soft hair of the black beard tickle his skin and hoped that his racing heart would not betray him.
Now the brunette smiled and sat down. "Thank you. So I just wanted to tell you what Harry reported when he woke up."
Draco nodded resignedly, collapsed on his stool and breathed deeply once to return to his usual professionalism.
They both moan as Harry pulls his cock out and waves his hand for a wandless cleaning charm. He shifts the both of them, so that they face each other, legs and arms entangled. His strong hands are on Draco’s cheeks, wiping away the tears that escapes his grey eyes.
This feeling of happiness, rushing through Draco's veins as he pressed his lips firmly against Harry's, was so overwhelmingly beautiful that he never wanted to miss it again. He loved him? Never before had anyone said "I love you" to him... Stealthily the blonde healer wiped a tear out of his eyes and smiled at his counterpart.
Incoherent mumble and pleas fall from Draco’s plump lips. He feels Harry’s thick cock pressing against his lubed hole and his mouth falls open in a silent cry as he gets filled inch by inch.
Despite being warned, the cleaning and lubing charm took him by surprise. He half gasped, half moaned at the new sensation. He felt fresh and warm and wet between his legs. Strange, but not totally unpleasant. And he felt something new. The weird urge to be… touched. Now that he knew that he was prepared, he wanted to
"Fuck it," he gasped. He had worked a lot and had been under a lot of stress, he deserved to relax a bit.
The voice of the healer only reached his mind slowly. By then she had already guided him to a room, misinterpreting his continuous nodding from before.
"I can't even tell when I fell in love with you! For me it feels like my whole life. I have always fancied you. And then the war started and you saved my life - and I saved yours. I thought I would lose you after all and I really tried to forget you, but of course it didn't work with Ginny either. And then I saw you again in St. Mungo and that little flame that was still burning in me suddenly flared up like dragon fire".
With a smacking noise Harry let the almost pulsating cock slide out of his mouth. No! Draco was so close... so fucking close!
The blonde smiled. "And what better distraction could there be than to have dinner with your ex-enemy," he mocked in a soft voice.
"Well," Draco mumbled hesitantly. "I thought they were a couple? Where was she when Potter was poisoned?"
“Aren’t you supposed to sleep at Pansy’s and Hermione’s house tonight?”, Harry asks softly, his amused smile obvious in his voice.
"It's true," the idiot behind him sounded. "That's not your ward, that's none of your business here. You don't even wear a robe! And you are just good enough for the
Draco took a deep breath, then opened the button and zipper of the tight cloth pants with the golden stripes on the side, which was in the same royal blue as the top and cape of the uniform. He pulled on the soft fabric, gradually exposing trained bronze legs with curly dark hair. Draco simply could not prevent his fingers from touching the naked, warm skin and he shuddered at the touch. "Damn it, pull yourself together," he admonished himself, sharply sucking in the air as his gaze fell on the tight black shorts the next moment. What he saw there didn't seem to be very small, even when asleep. Fuck, Malfoy, what's the matter with you? He tore his gaze away, ignored the beginning tension in his groin and let Harry sink back onto the soft mattress and slide the blanket over him. The former Gryffindor sighed softly in his sleep and turned to his side. Draco growled inside as his prick twitched at the sound. Carefully the young healer took off Harry's now crooked glasses and laid them on the bedside table. With a long index finger he gently stroked the temple of the other. The Auror made another small sigh.
It was certainly not easy for him to regain a foothold in the magical community. He was a Malfoy, a former Death Eater, not uninvolved in the suffering of many. But Draco fought. He fought and cried and fought on. It was tiring and exhausting, but in the meantime he had found a second family in St. Mungo. One who loved and admired him for what he did now. For his skill in dealing with patients, his enormous knowledge of healing potions and tinctures, his sensitivity and his charm and wit.
Harry moves his way further down and Draco’s breath hitches as strong hands caress his torso, run over his chest, pinch his nipples until they’re hard. Draco arches his back, trying to press himself even closer to Harry’s teasing touch. Soft whimpers escape his lips, as Harry whispers sweet nothings against his flat stomach. His tongue trails across the fine blonde hairs, leading from his belly button into his sweatpants.
"Well," Potter stammered and blushed slightly under his beard. "It actually went quite well. At least I think I managed to fix the broken rib by myself. I'm learning too, you know. But I think my lungs got something. Breathing is a bit difficult and hurts a lot". Again he coughed rattling and pressed his flat hand against his torso.
They all started their work. Draco checking and refilling the bar and the band setting up their stage. Draco soon started sweating carrying beer crates and bottles of booze in his tight jeans. He felt his face redden with the effort and swiped the back of his hand over his sweat covered forehead. All the while he heard the band arrange the stage, test their instruments and mics and try out the lights of the pub.
"I have no idea! Of course he didn't have a clue what was inside, otherwise he wouldn't have drunk it, would he? So I remember that the window in the kitchen was open... Maybe... Well, maybe he didn't get the bottle until the few minutes we both weren't in the kitchen per owl or something!
"I don't know either. Ron was there and he jumped at you and in front of him I just couldn't admit how much you really helped me.” He grimaced and looked Draco in the eye now. "That was childish of me. I have to apologize to you. And thank you.”
Draco’s silver-grey eyes became soft. “You’re such a sap, Potter”, he said gently, interlacing his fingers with Harry’s just next to the sugar basin. “And you’re changing subjects!”, he accused with his slender finger pointing accusingly at the dark-haired man.
“Oh hell!” Harry looked around, but the other people sitting in the little, cosy café, drinking their cappuccinos and earl greys, seemingly haven’t heard his snarky boyfriend. “Could you
Ron’s shouting voice shook Harry out of his daze. He twitched and took off his sunglasses. His head gladly stopped hurting after two pills of strong painkillers, a cold shower and a bottle of water. But anyway, he felt guilty.
Yawning and mentally cursing her best friend for his tight schedule, Pansy moves through the hall. She knocks on their guest bedroom door. “Rise and shine, blushing bride!”, she shouts through the dark wood. No answer. She knocks again, even louder this time. Still no answer.
"Shh, you don't have to cry." In a soft voice Draco talked to Harry and with his thumbs he wiped away the wet marks on his cheeks. Compassion flooded his stomach and he felt a small sting in his heart. "It's all over."
Harry wrapped his lips around Draco’s cock again and his fingers around the base of his bollocks. He heard Draco’s moan turn into a pained whimper when he increased the pressure and pulled the sensible balls.
Draco tried to recapture his briefly slipped facial features and cleared his throat. "Yes, of course... thank you, Sir."
"And do you know what hit him? I'm – uh, I’m just curious because, frankly, we were a little bit confused!"
“I know, I know. And I’m really sorry. Look, it wasn’t my fault. These Germans were such good drinkers!”
"You can go for a bite to eat, I only need a few minutes of sleep, then I feel better again," whispered the black-haired husky.
“Gods, can’t you just fuck me now?”, I whined. The pressure against my prostate grew and made me slightly desperate.
Shivering, the black haired man let the air out of his lungs and let his head sink back into Draco's hands. The blonde was shocked to see tears spilling from the closed eyes of the other.
The trembling became more and more violent. Now he grabbed his head with a moan, pressing his palms against his forehead and throwing his head back. His whole body began to twitch and he rolled his eyes upwards.
Oh Merlin, everything hurt. All his muscles felt sore, and he had to close his eyes to limit the headaches. Relieved he sighed as he felt something cold and damp on his forehead. Draco was there again. He knelt in front of the bed and carefully washed his shiny forehead with a cold cloth.
Harry laughed bitterly and shrugged his shoulders. "You said yourself, I look like shit. I haven't slept in three days. It's okay during the day, but it still comes back at night." Lost in thought he rubbed his upper arm. "But I think it’s getting better."
With trained and slender hands, he palpated the purple swollen side of his patient and gave a triumphant "Aha!" as Potter flinched and growled at the touch of his fifth rib.
So Draco took a shower and sighed with relief as the hot water ran down his body. Suddenly he remembered that just a few hours ago he had heard a similar sound coming out of Potter's mouth. And again his penis rewarded him with the same reaction, it twitched slightly.
"Everything okay?" Harry asked with a strained, worried voice and spreaded little kisses on Draco's bony spine. His big hands gently stroked the pale skin and soothed the blonde that he soon demanded more.
That's about it... I have another Drarry Fic (way more angsty) about these particular love-birds in line, but it will take a while to translate it... Would you like to read it?
He couldn’t clearly remember how he got home last night. At least it was his own bed, that he was sleeping in.  And apparently, he had managed to get rid of his shoes and jeans. That was a progress. He fumbled blindly to his right and left and felt the mattress empty. Not so much of a progress. But he wasn’t in the state of taking care of guests anyway, was he?
Soon the pub got more and more crowded and Draco simply had no time at all the think about the dark-haired man with the green eyes and the tattoos. He tapped beer, mixed cocktails and long drinks, washed glasses… trying to glimpse Harry in the crowded place.
They ate together and talked, at first a little tense and awkward, but after a while (and a little more wine) more and more relaxed. Draco quickly realized that they both avoided sensitive issues. Most of all they talked about their respective work and the young healer was pleased to notice that Harry seemed really interested. And the end of dinner the entire bottle of his favorite white wine was empty.
The pleasant burn spread through Draco’s limbs, crawling up his spine and numbing his brain. Harry’s breath was hot on his neck and his hands bruising his slender waist.
“On your hands and knees, beautiful.” Harry’s voice warm and soft and dripped like honey from my ears.
Six weeks had passed since Harry Potter's last visit to the ER. It was just half past three in the morning and Draco and Anthony were on duty. Actually it was supposed to be a quiet night. From experience, there was not much going on in the middle of the week, so the ward was only half staffed, but suddenly they heard a little tumult from the reception area. Several people were talking wildly across eachother and Draco didn't understand a single word. Then they heard Gladys calling their names, so that he and his colleague rushed into the corridor in front of the treatment rooms.
I don’t know how I survived the way back to the castle. The candy cane, though it was back to its regular, thin state, flicked against my oversensitive prostate every other step. I just couldn’t think straight. By the time we finally entered our dorm and Harry had casted all privacy charms he could think of, I was exhausted, covered in sweat and rock-hard again. And freezing cold, but Harry lit up our small fireplace so that was okay, I guess.
With faster movements, Draco's breath also got faster. With his left forearm he leaned against the cool tiles in front of him and allowed the water to warm his back, while he sighed and groaned slightly. Finally he felt something hot building up inside him, rushing through his veins, stunning him, and with a loud groan he came into his own hand.
