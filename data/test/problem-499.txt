He was still thinking about his youth, and how different it could have been, when they were walking around after lunch, trying to work off all the food they’d consumed. Since it was too hot in the afternoon sun to walk outside for a long stretch, they kept ducking into hotels they passed, admiring the elaborate decorations and entertaining themes. While most of the group was taking pictures of all the sights, Harry was happy to just hang back and enjoy the view.
“As if that wasted hour wasn’t enough, the amount of paperwork I had to do regarding the accident when I got back was ridiculous. I don’t know who trained these interns, but the dolts disposed of all the potion without taking any samples or running any tests. Thankfully they put it in a bin instead of vanishing it, so we were able to pull it out and separate the components, which gave me more than enough evidence to fire Berntsen. Though now I’m down a senior potioneer. I’ve been reading the applications I have on hand and writing a call for more resumes all day.”
Harry finished his sandwich, and then flipped over the menu and spent the rest of his break scribbling a list of questions he should ask Malfoy. He kept glancing at his list several times in the afternoon, trying to commit his questions to memory until it was finally time to head to the restaurant.
Camilla stared at him for a moment before she started laughing. He wasn't sure what was so funny, but waited patiently for her to apparently regain her sanity.
By the time Head Auror Clearwater came by to give him his lunch break, Scorpius had already made it through half the evidence forms. He was itching to get down to the Aurors’ archives and find the physical pieces of evidence, because Smith had done a horrible job of photographing it all. The photos were blurry, cut off, off centered, or sometimes they weren’t even there. He took a moment to rant about it as they were trading off the emergency watch, fully intending to go down to the archives during his break.
Draco gave a dry laugh. "Yeah, and it's also the second time I'm going to charge you enough to be able to buy Scorpius a top of the line racing broom for his birthday."
“Stop obsessing over Malfoy, mate,” Ron sighed as he plopped a fresh lemonade in front of Harry. It was Harry’s turn to be designated Disapparator, a practice that Ron always insisted on, even though they never really drank enough to impair their ability to use the Floo when it was just the three of them. “Clearly you’re a little lonely if you’re obsessing over your schoolyard crush again. There’s a friendly new Obliviator from Morocco that I could introduce you to if you’re interested—”
"To be fair, I generally favour a darker green, but I appreciate the help, Scorpius," Draco said diplomatically. "I know Harry's buying a new apartment, maybe he can hire you for your decorating services someday too."
“Traditionally, the Gerewhol is also considered a matchmaking ceremony,” Hassan admitted. “Daneri and I, we thought it had been clear that you weren’t there for a bride, but just to participate in the culture. It seems that one of the girls did not understand that, however, and has chosen you as her husband.”
It had been a week since Scorpius had moved into his new flat, and Harry was going spare. The house felt too quiet, and lonely, without his son bustling around in it. Harry’s life had always been calm and peaceful, but now it was just downright depressing.
Harry placed a hand on Draco’s arm, reminding himself that the gesture was to comfort his date, not because his blazer was so soft.
Scorpius had only signed out one piece of evidence from the lockers—his father’s journal. It looked like it had been started about a month before he was arrested, which would have been exactly enough time to brew the polyjuice potion that had been used to murder the Minister. It seemed to be centered around exactly that, and so Scorpius took it back up to his desk.
Draco nodded, taking a seat next to Harry. Scorpius declared that he was going to sit with his "new friend" and ran around the table to clamber up next to Bryan. Harry had to hold back a laugh; Bryan looked incredibly out of his depth dealing with a five year old child. As Draco pulled a bunch of documents and a quill out of his briefcase, Harry made up a plate for Scorpius, who was quick to detail the exact specifications of what type of sandwich and which toppings he liked best.
"Sot gutt," she said, and even though Harry had no idea what it meant, it sounded good, so he smiled back.
Agent Delta pulled out a sheet of parchment and started to write. If there was a way, they knew exactly who would find it.
"Well, that's it then," Draco said, standing up. Harry did the same, and together they walked out into the outer office.
“Oh yes, I will. I really hope I won’t need to actually call for help in the future though. What a cry-werewolf situation this is!”
"Are you all right?" he asked. She smiled coyly, stepping closer and reaching out to cup his face in her hand. Harry barely had time to react before her lips were on his. Oh Merlin, she was kissing him! He pulled back, gasping for breath.
"Of course," Harry smiled, unsure why she was so surprised with a wooden spoon. Suddenly, she turned to her mother, chattering away excitedly and showing her the gift. Her mother's reaction was very similar to Camilla's and soon the two of them were speaking excitedly, and Harry had no idea what could possibly be going on.
“Harree!” she cried happily, pulling him into a tight embrace. Harry returned her hug enthusiastically, before being led down the hall into the sitting room. Sh gestured for him to sit, before yelling something out to the house in general and heading into the open kitchen, from which a delicious smell was emerging. Harry barely had time to wonder what she might be cooking when Camilla wandered in. She paused for a moment, clearly surprised to see Harry, but as he stood up to greet her, she broke into a wide smile.
"Okay, your idea of finding food before your lawyer gets here is getting appealing," Bryan said after a moment. "Maybe we could, um, share the shower? You know, to save time and such."
I must admit that my purpose in writing this letter was two-fold. If, you are as fed up as I think you are, then there is every possibility that you may be amenable to an arrangement that may allow us both to control the narrative while engaging in a bit of journalistic misdirection. Especially since I know how much you loathe Rita Skeeter and I think that being able to get one over on her would be excellent fun.
“You want me to stay for lunch?” Harry blurted. He’d thought that Scorpius only wanted him to check on Draco and heat up the food. He hadn’t realised he’d be having an entire meal with the man.
"Getting an annulment, which is what I had hoped we could do, is going to get a lot more difficult if you did," Draco explained, ignoring his son. "It would be fine if you were muggles, but wizarding law here is even more antiquated and strict, and this is a wizarding marriage certificate."
Draco nodded, seemingly reassured by Teddy’s words. He stood shakily, leaning on Adella’s arm. When he was finally upright, she counted them down and apparated away, leaving Scorpius and Teddy alone in the courtroom.
Harry stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk, causing a handful of people around him to grumble about “inconsiderate pedestrians”. Not paying them any mind, Harry searched his memory for Scorpius’ address. Surely his son had told him at some point where he was living? Had Harry already forgotten? Was he already getting that old?
Draco instantly felt bad for bringing it up. There was guilt written all over Harry’s face, as if he was trying to come up with a plausible reason why he was keeping his meetings with Draco a secret. He was about to spare Harry the embarrassment and say something about it still being early, when he felt it.
“I’ve got to go,” he said, before Potter could reply. “I’ll see you Friday, yeah? And for Salazar’s sake, please register with a General Healer
“I’m well. Lots of Flinitores around tonight, so I’m drinking elderberry lemonade. The lemon wards them off.”
Daneri mumbled something, clearly deep in concentration. He and Harry were sitting in the back of the car while Daneri did his makeup. They’d explained that traditionally men spent the whole morning getting ready, but that they wouldn’t arrive on time for any of that.
“Of course I do, Draco. And honestly, I think I have for a long time. I can’t pinpoint exactly when I broke the habit of wondering what you were up to, but it was pretty early on.”
Scorpius’ face lit up as he realised that his father was going to go into the sandpit for him. Grinning along, Harry led Scorpius to the edge of the sandpit, where they started scanning the mounds of sand while waiting for Draco to be ready. When his father stepped into the pit, Scorpius was ready.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, after yet another minute had passed. “You seem to be having some trouble deciding.”
His mind wandered back to the case file sitting in his desk drawer. It was still full of information he had yet to uncover. He wondered what he would find after reading it all. Would he magically find some evidence that his father was innocent after all? Or would he just confirm what his dad had been saying along?
A single tear ran down the side of Draco’s face, and Scorpius thought it might be from joy. He didn’t blame the man—he’d cry with relief too if he’d had to spend 15 years in Azkaban. He held still as his father reached out with a shaky hand and cupped his cheek.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, I’m saying you should let them choose where they want to go and what they want to do. Within reason of course, but there’s no way Harry’s going to be able to spoil Teddy properly with salmon tartare and flambéed brussel sprouts.”
"Your mouth said those words, but I don't think your heart means it. You are not feeling good about your looks. Participating in the festival will, I think, make you feel more confident. Performing with the others, participating in competitions, and ceremonies, all this will show you that you are a good man."
“We should get you to St. Mungo’s,” Adella pointed out. “I’ll go ahead with Mr. Malfoy, and you two can meet us there. First floor, East wing.”
“I’m always happy to meet former students when the opportunity presents itself,” she said genuinely. “It’s a wonderful feeling to see everything they accomplish. I always feel like a proud parent when I see headlines such as this morning’s.”
Draco nodded, trying and failing to cover another yawn. He still looked a little worried, and Harry could tell he was still thinking about their son.
Scorpius gulped, not having even thought of that. He remembered the sight of his father stumbling as he’d been led into the courtroom earlier, and quickly resolved to keep his hands to himself.
He spent another hour flipping back and forth through it, but found nothing new. He kept pondering the question of why his father would have wanted to develop a potion that was less effective. The only thing he could think of was that Silverthorn’s planned schedule for getting into the Minister’s office and out again must have been tight. But then wouldn’t he have just taken a smaller dose?
Muttering under his breath, Hassan started up the car and drove off, not daring to look back. Harry gave him about ten minutes, to make sure they had gotten far enough away, before he started asking questions.
“It’s been pretty hectic,” Scorpius admitted. “But anyway, don’t worry about cooking for us. Papa needs to be really careful about what he eats anyway, and lentil soups tend to be spicy.”
Draco nodded. “He didn’t have anyone else to go with, so he asked me.” Thankfully she didn’t seem to put two and two together, and realise that being his date was the service that Harry had paid Draco for. Instead, she chose what might have been an even worse line of questioning.
Teddy frowned at him. “Am I cleared to take this home with me? If so I could probably have it ready first thing in the morning.”
I could apologize for showing up unannounced and attracting media attention to us, but neither of us should have to apologize for what that rag writes. You're right in assuming that I know
“You should eat first,” Head Auror Clearwater said sternly. “I told you that case had better not interfere with your work, and I won’t have a drowsy and hungry Auror on emergency duty.”
“Aren’t you bound to secrecy as well?” Harry asked. “Will you get in trouble for telling me all of this?”
“I feel awful for leaving you,” Draco said after a few minutes of silence. “But I really do need to get to the hospital.”
Harry shook his head. “That’s the thing though. I don’t really think you are. To work full time in a stressful job like yours, and then come home and care for an ill parent, that takes a lot out of a person. That’s why Draco and I were talking, and we decided that… he’s going to come stay with me.”
Harry threw his head back with a groan, summoning all his willpower not to start yelling and swearing right there. This
“No. They’re charmed for patient confidentiality, so that only people who need to see what’s written here can.”
And then there was the issue of her parents in the waiting room. The hospital had already been put on a discreet lockdown to keep the press out, with Aurors at every entrance and more patrolling each floor. Having so many watchful eyes around made Draco want to go lock himself in his office, but this was one of the rare instances where he had an actual job to do.
"No, I'm not going back. This time, I'm going to Chad. Apparently it's very hot there, and it's in the desert, so there's lots of sand."
“What’s the stitch, doc?” Teddy teased. Adella rolled her eyes at him and wrapped up her diagnostic spells.
He was relieved when Harry placed a familiar mug of tea in front of him. The set that these mugs came from had been a wedding gift from Molly Weasley. Clearly Harry hadn’t had the heart to replace a gift from his surrogate mother. Draco’s mood dropped as he thought about the fact that they weren’t married anymore. Scorpius’ lawyer had explained to him that Harry had filed for a divorce all those years ago, and since Draco was incarcerated, the court had approved it on his behalf. He couldn’t help wondering if Harry might be open to the idea of getting married again, now that they would be living together.
“Here, try this,” Bryan said suddenly, shoving a spoonful of mousse in front of him. “It’s really light, you’ll enjoy it.”
Harry nodded. “In a way, yeah. I also just needed a break from home. I just got out of a really messy divorce.”
“Glad to see your desk job hasn’t left you out of shape. I’d forgotten how much fun it was to fly so competitively.”
“Okay.” Harry watched as Draco followed his son toward their room. He had just reached the door frame when Harry felt a sudden spark of bravery.
“She’s a great Auror and an even better boss,” Scorpius said loudly. “And yeah, I’ll take that emergency shift, no problem. After all, us Aurors, we’re all a team, and we’ve gotta support each other. In fact, I think I’ll even pop by St. Mungo’s and ask Merle how her spattergroit treatment is coming along.”
At first I thought it might have been because of a time constraint, you know, they had to get in and out pretty quickly. But Silverthorn’s Polyjuice wore off
To that end, I'll attend the Gala with you next weekend. I'm almost scared to ask though - what do you mean we'll have to prepare? It's just going to be another boring event, the only preparation we need to do is to iron the most stuffy dress robes we have and find a way to hide that bottle of Ogden's of yours inside them. Right?
“Don’t laugh! I was right, wasn’t I? You were up to something! Granted, I thought it was something more sinister, like experiments on unsuspecting patients.” He backtracked quickly when Draco gave him a horrified look. “Well I know
to him. Funnily enough, the displays he loved the most were the ones for children’s bedrooms, or kitchens and bathrooms adapted to suit families. He knew it was irrational of him to like those styles—he was a bachelor (or at least he would be once Draco returned) and he should be exploring sleek, modern and practical styles. Most of the sales people showed him rich blues, deep browns and warm reds.
“So, what type of Healing do you do, exactly?” Harry asked. He watched carefully as Malfoy sipped his wine, searching for any hint of a lie, but he was composed as ever.
“He went to the hospital looking for a Healer and left with a date,” Dean deadpanned. “That kind of chaos sounds
“Okay, okay!” Harry laughed, allowing himself to be led to the stairs leading to the top. It was a long climb, but they finally made it to the landing where a lifeguard was waiting at the top of the slide.
"Look Papa! Harry got me a reindeer plushie! He said his friend got to pet a real live one! A real live reindeer, Papa!" Draco smiled down at his son, but the smile was replaced with a frown as Scorpius continued.
“I don’t think I quite understood what your job actually is when you explained it on Friday. You used a lot of words that I didn’t understand, which I’m guessing are healer vocabulary.”
"Uggh!" Camilla yelled in frustration, her father looking smug. "They decided that they want also to eat here now," she explained to Harry. Her tone of voice made it clear that they were here to keep an eye on Harry and Camilla. While his new friend seemed rather irritated by her parents' antics, he couldn't help thinking it was rather sweet. He longed for parents who would be so protective of him, and couldn't help feeling jealous of Camilla. Not wanting his dark thoughts to ruin the evening though, he turned to the host.
“You do know it’s my job to consult with Aurors on potions related cases, right?” he teased. Scorpius shrugged.
Harry nodded. “I’m not sure how much. All I know is that one of his batches of polyjuice was mixed with my hair, and they used that to get into the Minister’s office, and kill him. Sometimes I wonder if I could have forgiven the fact that he was brewing illicit potions. It can be lucrative, and I know living with a limited income was hard for him. I think what really got to me was the fact that he took my hair. There were so many people they could have impersonated to get an appointment with the Minister. So many ways to get into that office. But they chose me. I was friends with the Minister too. The last thing he saw before he died was me, pointing a wand at him and casting the killing curse.”
After giving Draco the details of the hotel, which he'd found on a flyer on the coffee table, Harry ended the call and turned back to Bryan, who was still sitting on the bed, staring at the paper.
“Don’t give me that look,” Agent Eta scolded. “Agent Phi’s partner was compromised. Someone needs to debrief their cases until they get a new partner.”
“Thank you for talking to me, Dad,” he said gently. His dad nodded, pulling the blankets tightly around him and leaning his head against one of the pillows.
“Why don’t I hold that for you?” Harry offered, reaching for the folder. Draco merely shook his head and walked away, leaving Harry to follow after shooting a nasty glare at the cafeteria witch.
“Harry, you need to stop obsessing about this. So he healed a girl. He’s a Healer, that’s his job. There’s nothing untoward about it.”
“Very well. You’ve made a clear and compelling case. My only question, however, is why this evidence was ignored in the first place. Why did the defendant not argue his case with this information during the first trial?”
Scorpius didn’t push the issue, as much as he wanted to. He was starting to understand that loving someone and hating them weren’t mutually exclusive.
has details about what a person was treated for at St Mungo’s. And then you wonder why I don’t trust most Healers.”
Teddy mimed zipping his lips shut, but clearly the Black family dramatics were shining through, because he also vanished his whole mouth.
“Clearly I wasn’t thinking fast enough,” his Papa sighed. “If I hadn’t been such an idiot, I might have… we might not have lost the past fifteen years.” Scorpius was alarmed to see another tear rolling down his cheek, and rushed to comfort him.
“If you’d had any sense, you wouldn’t have been there in the first place! Harry, you know we can’t be spying on departments. Our process has to be as ethical and transparent as we want theirs to be! How does it look if the one department designed to ensure ethical behaviour in the Ministry is sneaking around?”
“Scorpius, stop that,” Draco admonished. “That’s the door that leads to Harry’s room, we don’t want to disturb him.”
who did an amazing job investigating the case and compiling the evidence. I merely had to present it.”
“If you bring back a dragon, you can fly back on it, instead of taking a muggle air-oh-plain,” Scorpius suggested wisely, clearly unaware that the logistics of flying on a dragon were highly flawed. “Papa went on a air-oh-plain this week, and he didn’t like it at all. He got really sick.”
Draco wanted to insist that he was fine, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of the attacker’s magical signature. He was anxious to get home and review the guest list for the night, and letting Harry Apparate him would get him there faster.
“I’m sure he won’t be like that forever,” Harry assured him. “He just wants to know that you’re okay.”
. It wasn’t true, but Harry found he didn’t mind the assumption. Bryan was a great guy, and if he ever found himself in New York, he’d definitely send him an owl. But for now, they were going their separate ways—Bryan was headed home, and Harry had a couple of Malfoys to escort around San Francisco.
She lay on the grass and started to giggle too, both of them laughing and laughing until they wore themselves out. The drink and the kiss and the exhaustion were combining into a soft numbness that was the next best thing to actually feeling good.
“Dear Merlin,” said Draco. His eyes were watering. “All right, so we started on a low note. Potter, you are clearly incapable of taste.”
“I personally very much approve of frills. Especially on lingerie, Susan. You may want to take note.” He winked at her. “But you have to commit to frills, you know? Build an armour of frou-frou. That sad thing looks like she’s just sewn a rag around her neck.”
Harry considered the situation. Reconsidered it. Watched as Blaise shifted his shoulders like he was carrying the heaviest of burdens. “I thought you weren’t serious about Susan.”
“Anyway,” said Draco, beginning to walk again. “I’m now officially no longer the most hated person in the flat. Blaise has been bemoaning Seamus to anyone that will listen, which is
“Hush, child,” she said, holding up a hand. “I’m going to lay some wisdom on you now. The first is this – yes, you totally did fuck him around. And I understand that you’re going through a lot right now, and there’s lots of good, sympathetic reasons why you were saying and doing the things you did – but that doesn’t negate their effect on Dean. Him being the nearest queer person to you does not mean that you can use him to play gay chicken with yourself and see how far could push the envelope of heterosexual bromance without having to admit you weren’t straight, and your internalised homophobia does not actually justify the way you treated him when he came out. I get it, kind of. If he was openly bi and you were into him and you two were friends then maybe you’d end up crossing a line and you wouldn’t be able to take it back. That’s kind of it, right?”
“Then what am I meant to do?” he yelled. “Please tell me, Morag, what I am meant to do. Because the fact that you can name all that doesn’t make it less of a problem, all right? You’re right, I hurt him by pushing him away, and my motivations don’t matter – you’re right. But I cannot. Be. Near. Him. I am working so bloody hard at this, and I can’t – I can’t – “
She found him the next evening, smoking on the patch of grass outside their dorms with Theo. The sun was setting, and the weather chilly, but they’d created a bubble of warming charms around the two of them that had her tugging at her cardigan.
“No one is coming to save you, Michael,” said Blaise. “It’s Knockturn. You could howl all night. Shall we find out if you can do that?”
“It’s an appletini, drink it. Pansy, I assume I don’t have to remind you of the code of Slytherin honour and the heinous penalty that awaits all who break it, do I?”
“Ok,” said Seamus, and that was all  he needed. He pushed through the crowd and found Blaise up against the bar, his head in his hands.
“You’re struggling to think of cons - ? Potter, I realise this is territory I’ve already used for a joke, but
“All right.” Harry picked up the sheet. “Virtue ethics. This one I don’t have a fucking clue about. What virtue?”
haunted. He’d had Hermione and Ron over on separate evenings, back to back, until it became undeniable that they were only coming over because they pitied him.
“Hi,” said Draco, because he was apparently just as stupid as him. “I’m meant to be avoiding you. I’m – angry. Yeah. Angry and stuff. You know.”
“I got this,” said Draco. “Good luck with Corner. Don’t let him read you his poetry. Oh, and thank you for the help, I suppose.”
“I’m not sitting down there,” said Draco, standing opposite Harry, “because this cupboard is filthy, and I’ve already ruined one pair of trousers. So you’ll have to stand.”
It was nice there, in the bubble of Blaise and Susan’s meanness. Harry wanted to stay there forever, but unfortunately nature called, and he stood up to make his way to the bathroom. Or the bathroom queue, anyway. It didn’t seem to be moving at all, and by the time Harry had made his way to the front he was almost crossing his legs and bouncing, and had worked his way up into quite a fury.
“I’ve never been a lesbian,” she said, with breathy wonder. “It sounds lovely. Never having to worry about men.”
Susan snapped up and caught his eye. “Harry! I’ve got to go a big benefit in a month or so, and I’ve managed to repress Sprout teaching us to waltz in fourth year so Blaise here is reminding me.”
“I thought – “ Dean’s voice cracked. “Look, I was beginning to think some things that weren’t true, ok? About – about you and me. About possibilities. And I just realised that I’d been delusional.” He sniffed. “So there you go. There’s your story. Your little fag friend had a crush on you, so of course you had to leave him behind.”
He stalked towards Michael’s table, full of murderous intent that suddenly switched to convivial bonhomie when Michael looked up.
“Let’s all go,” sighed Draco, pulling his hands away from Harry’s. “I’m sure we’ll all be involved anyway. Was Corner a horrible date?”
“I saw the two of you coming back from the pub last night. Don’t worry, Theo’s the only other person and he doesn’t care enough about you to tell anyone. I had to stage a blazing row with him to stall Blaise, otherwise he’d be presenting you with a rainbow-splattered condom and lube welcome basket right now.”
Potter,” hissed Malfoy, who had apparently been standing right beside him. He knew the bartender of course – he had gotten a job here, and it was apparent from their short and sulky conversation that the two of them did not like each other.
Ron was clinging to the edge of the table, rocking back and forth. He’d done the last shot for Draco – something disgusting called a
They were awkward because having Harry around had only made everything worse for their family, and they were too determined to treat him as though it hadn’t.
“Harry,” she said, her voice dangerous calm, “why did you tell Ron that Malfoy fancies me when we both know perfectly well that he’s gay?”
“I heard that this is the most haunted uni in England,” one of the excited freshers was saying to another, as Harry struggled not to smile. “Apparently Thomas Holloway was into black magic and shit. Some say they see him running around the grounds in the form of a devilish black dog.”
“I don’t know who I am outside being clever,” she whispered, “and my parents don’t remember me, and I broke up with Ron, and I’m worried that no one will ever love me once they see what a small thing I am inside. I don’t know who I want, or who I like, or what I want to be. I think I might have to change the world, and I’m not sure the world wants me to change it. And I – I’m not sure
Blaise rolled his eyes, but didn’t cease his frantic pacing. “Harry, you are not actually an Auror, and the Dark Lord is dead. It’s not your job to prevent every bit of dark magic you see.”
“Yes. Next time I have feelings, I will definitely tell you all about them.” God, when had he become such a horrible liar?
The other guy turned around. He was good looking, Harry supposed, if you liked them dark and rumpled. “Do you know this guy, Draco?”
“So can bravery. Dear old Aunt Bella wasn’t scared a day in her life, and I give thanks every day that she’s dead. She was also loyal, so there’s a Hufflepuff value used for the bad side too.”
Draco was laughing so hard he had actual tears in his eyes. “First Ginny, and now this. Are – are you telling me that the only women that the men of the Golden Trio dated immediately came out as lesbians after this – “
“Continuing,” said Draco, “we each get a second. You get three vetoes, and your second can take your shot for you in that case.”
“It’s so typical of Potter,” he said, as he was winding up his monologue. “Invading every corner of my brain, when he hasn’t been remotely invited.”
“You do look pretty good tonight, Potter,” said Draco. Was that his bedroom voice? What was going on?
“Ah, but I had a little conversation with Draco earlier that backed up my cockiness. Is it true that you want to ‘have my ugly babies’?”
“Were you with Seamus?” Dean’s voice was odd. The room was silent. Hannah was looking between Harry and Dean, a little confused.
“I’m not saying I particularly want to be around Sea right now. But doing this is just going to hurt him. What’s he going to do, mope at the side lines until he finally gives in and apologises? That’s pretty cruel.”
“Hey, Harry,” she said. Anthony abandoned the traffic cone and leaned into her, his arm coming up around her shoulders. “House parties are fun, right? Anthony’s been telling me about one in America where he had to escape the Muggle police.”
“We’re in the same block,” said Dean. “We need to have block parties, like, every night. We have to know the guest list.”
And he stormed off towards the house, taking the joint with him. Dean stayed still and unmoving as a statue, until Harry laid a hand on his arm.
“You seemed to like my fumbling about earlier,” said Harry, lining up his cock, and Draco moaned and shifted, glaring at Harry with irritation and fondness and naked, breath-taking want.
“Fuck if I know,” said Ron. He looked angry. “Like, you look at them from afar and wish you could be near them? You desperately miss their voice and their body and their mind? Everything is just this horrible tangle of her, her, her, and it’s beating in your head until you start to go mad, and you wish that you had fallen in love with –“ He stopped short and went white. “Fuck.”
“Good,” said the Seamus in the present. He was plastered along Dean’s front, which was dangerous. He was slightly hard from the memory and the proximity. “Come and dance with me. I’m a good dancer.”
inheriting the Black family madness. “Would you please listen to me. I was not in love with Harry Potter at school!”
“Hermione has dumped Michael Corner,” said Susan, still bright red. “We’re avoiding an awkward situation.”
“I don’t know what there is to say about it,” Dean said. “I loved him. He kissed me. He had a mental breakdown. He’s not here. End of story.”
“I don’t need you to say anything. You’ve clearly got life sorted, all right? You don’t need me anymore, do you?”
She waited another week before ending things with Terry. Luckily, he was a Ravenclaw and therefore far too deep in his studies to ask her on a date. She used the limited time in between to catch up with Draco, who was, a little tentatively, a friend. Or at the very least, friend-adjacent.
Pansy rolled her eyes, but the look she shot Ron was almost fond. On Harry’s other side, Draco was looking between the two of them, something between interest and concern wrinkling his brow.
Hermione slipped away while Draco was pouring them both a glass of wine, and made her way to the kitchen. She could see the back of Anthony’s head. She opened the door and was about to step out when she heard –
“Yes,” he said. “Ok, so sometimes rules that should be broadly followed don’t cover extreme situations. But that’s not a problem with the idea of rules itself. You just need better rules –
“Now, now, Potter, we’re in public. Don’t you remember what I said about not sullying my good name with the likes of you?” He winked, and Harry blinked against the tangle of hurt and confusion and horniness that exploded in his chest. “There’s a little alcove in the back of the garden. Just in case you find someone to take there. Theoretically.”
“She’s a challenge,” said Blaise, apparently deciding to open up. “A puzzle. A conundrum. Normally I could have a girl like her falling at my feet by now, but she seems utterly determined not to take me as anything but a joke.”
“Of course,” said Malfoy, equally nasty. “Can’t have a poofter as the heir to the Malfoy line, can they?”
“God, Potter, look at you. Such a slut. You love this, don’t you?” cooed Draco, which would have been irritating if it wasn’t such a turn-on.
The Last-Hurrah-of-Gryffindor was in a small muggle pub called The London Stone, which Dean had picked at random and which turned out to be a total shithole. Seamus spent over thirty minutes choosing a drink, and probably longer painstakingly counting out the Muggle money for his pint. He paid at least half of it in coppers. The stone-faced Northerner behind the bar looked like he was ready to commit murder.
“She’s great, Harry. I wish you could have stayed that time we ran into you in the pub. She’s really easy to get along with. I think you’ll like her, once you get to know her.”
“You’re right, Nott,” she said, rolling her eyes as she sat. “Let me just pop up to Scotland quickly and grab Macgonagall. Fifty points from Slytherin.”
“It’s fine,” said Seamus. “I’ll go. Maybe you should invite Blaise in here. I’ll put in my earplugs.”
“Fuck you,” said Michael, and Blaise stamped on his leg hard. Something cracked, and Michael howled.
Blaise gave a devilish grin. “My dear, you know me far too well to think that could ever happen. I pick – “
Nott nodded, but Zabini just sniffed. “I don’t think so, Weasley. I didn’t dress this good to be seen by the barkeeps alone. Susan, will you do me the honour?”
“It is, isn’t it? ‘Harder times.’ Oh, you mean two years ago? Yes, it was a bit challenging then, wasn’t it?”
“Luna’s my girlfriend,” she said. “Hermione mentioned something about you thinking it hysterical that all the women the Golden Trio had dated turned lesbo the second they broke up.”
“She was non-evil, at least,” said Hermione, grimacing as she remembered Professor Stone’s lessons. “She was very keen on Harry. He kind of ended up teaching the class a lot.”
“She taught me well. Now, Harry, do you think we could persuade Hermione to put an extension charm on the kitchen below?”
“Um,” said Harry, as Susan walked away. “Not to sound stupid, but what does bisexual mean?” There hadn’t been much sex ed at Hogwarts, and the Dursley’s had treated anything other than being straight as if it was some kind of unmentionable disease. He really hoped it wasn’t another kink thing – he was still trying to bleach his brain after Blaise had explained what a “golden shower” was.
Draco refused to watch him go, as a point of principle. He was an adult man who could survive a few awkward encounters and a broken heart without turning into a teenage girl.
He was excited. University was a time for trying new things, and Harry was sure that he was going to love house parties.
“Am I really frumpy? I mean, I think I am. I know I am. Does knowing make it better? Maybe if I’m self-aware of it I can kind of pull it off in an ironic way.”
thing she’d done was jump out of a third-floor window to catch a perp, and he now thought she was brilliant. He supposed it was nice that Pansy appeared to be making up for her actions, but most of Ron’s stories seemed to revolve around her being a menace to society.
She blinked. “If I wanted to talk about Harry, I’d talk to Harry.” This was, of course, a bald-faced lie. If she wanted to talk about Draco in excruciating detail, she would go to Harry. She imagined the same was true in reverse. She was proved right, of course. In a sense. Draco spent the entire coffee date talking about how he was
Two weeks into his slow descent into insanity, Draco sat up in bed in the middle of the night from a dream where Potter had sliced off his left arm and thought
Draco’s lips were parted. His hair was pushed back in soft waves that Harry wanted to run his fingers through. His eyes were luminous and wild and strange. How had he ever thought you could read them? There were unknown depths you could never finish exploring.
“There, there,” said Blaise, refilling Michael’s glass. He tipped the bottle to his own, but nothing came out. Harry caught his quick wink over the glass. “Tell us all about it.”
“You look fit, Hermione,” Seamus said, slurring over her. Half his beer was seeping into his shirt. “You know, it’s kind of funny remembering I used to have a crush on you.”
“That’s brilliant!” said Harry. He grabbed some snow, held it to his lips. “It’s real! Draco, this is – “
“I hate it, Blaise,” said Draco, after yet another embarrassing failure to pull. “I can’t – I can’t stop thinking about him. It’s like I’m bloody Greengrass or something, mooning over my crush.”
“Yeah! I could be full out going down on an orange in the kitchen – “ They both burst into giggles, and Harry caught Dean before he slipped.
Blaise grinned. “The most attractive person. What a Gordian knot you have put me in – pun not intended. All of my friends are just so beautiful.” He stood up, and began to move slowly round the table. “There’s you, of course – yes, you’re a stringy bean, but you’ve got wonderful cheekbones and those slate grey eyes, that ash-blonde hair – damn. Draco, who might even come in as the next hottest Slytherin. After me. Greg – well. You’ve got nice shoulders.”
“Yes!” said Susan. “Stop shouting. Harry and Draco were having a private conversation, and then Ron and Hermione came to get back together, so Harry and Draco hid, and then me and Blaise came to get together, so they hid, and then Dean and Seamus came to yell at each other, so we hid, and then you two turned up so Dean and Seamus hid, and we should really stop using the courtyard as a place to hold private conversations.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at him when Harry stared at him in mute horror. “What? Oh god, are you pissed off about what happened in the kitchen? Should have known the she-weasel leaving would make you a homophobe.”
“Does it involve nudity?” said Harry, who had heard a great many Blaise stories on the champagne night.
"So what? Those wards mean nothing if he's dead, or crippled. I saw what they've done to him. It's a miracle that Harry is alive. I'm almost entirely sure that his magic is the only thing that keeps him functional. Do you want the memories? I'll gladly give them if it means convincing you to have him removed."
She came to the conclusion that it would have to be a ravenclaw. Someone smart, though reserved and private enough to keep things to themselves. Too studious and hyperfixated on reading to have any curiosity or interest in her asking to borrow an owl.
Later that night, Harry was washing up the dishes in the kitchen. His hands red and pruning from the hot soapy water. He scrubbed at plates, and cookware. Everything had food crusted onto it from use. The load was astronomical since Vernon and Dudley ate enough food for a small family, each (If each member ate second helpings, along with dessert). Tonight's meal was especially difficult, French onion soup. All the cookware and serving vessels had cheese crusted and melted onto it, it loved to cling to the oven-safe ceramic. The brown, beefy broth nearly seared onto the sides of each ramekin. Jammy, caramelized bits of onion and their natural sugars refused to be removed from the large Dutch oven in which they had been cooked to a sweet, flavourful mass.
Even his hair seemed to lose it's attitude, laying across his scalp and on the floor in a more messy and unkempt fashion than his usual handsomely tousled locks. It was greasy, but lacked shine. It's volume was reduced to the point of almost being manageable.
Harry winced as a huge, pudgy hand gripped the top of his head, pressing into the tender side of his cranium. He felt his head being tilted upward to face Vernon more directly. The fat man's face was pink with disproportionate anger.
The boy with messy, dark hair grimaced as he pushed himself to his feet. Limping slightly to the bucket, he picked it up, slowly bending over. He did his best not to agitate his injuries. He looked over the garden and the lawn. He was forced to perform near constant maintenance on the yard, which meant that weeds weren't a huge issue. Though they sprung up all the time regardless. Petunia insisted that herbicides would harm her precious flora.
There were no places for Harry to enter through. Forcing Harry to contemplate a means of getting inside, by creating his own entrance. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't come up with a stealthy way of breaching the fortress. He would have to do this loud and up front. At least his stolen costume would serve a larger purpose.
Though first, he needed to overcome the chain link fence bordering the perimeter of Thornwell. It was topped with razor wire, which eliminated climbing in its entirety. He supposed he would need to bend the fence to accommodate him.
He found that the establishment was run by a man and his wife, both from the colonies. He assumed that at some point they decided to move to the UK from the states, and open a restaurant serving their home cuisine. A lot of it looked very interesting, either cooked on a griddle or fried in hot oil.
"You play beautifully!" Harry said as he hurried away. The man seemed startled, but continued to play his music. As Harry glanced back, he caught the man's eye once more, before turning and rushing to round the corner.
After another breath, she drew out the page therein. It was folded to fit into the envelope, the back facing outward, blank except for a name.
Hours passed before Harry was ready to be up and about, in part due to his aching sore body. The emotional exhaustion made it difficult for him to move whatsoever. Eventually he could walk on his own, however, slowly. A brisk pace was painful, though he could manage it for a few minutes at a time.
He slowly sat up, nausea rushed into him, but it was managable. He took the glass of water, and inspected it. It was crystal clear, pristine. He took a small sip, no abnormal flavours to speak of.
Harry needed to know how this magic worked, he needed to know how it functioned. How best to access it, so that he could use it to achieve his ends.
"Breakfast time." Harry whispered to himself, a hint of excitement in his voice. He was going to have the best breakfast he'd had in his life. There was a place he already had in mind. It was an interesting little restaurant, it served "American food."
The only reason they knew of her at all was because of Delphinium's ability to sense the magics of others. She had found it suspicious that the same magic kept appearing nearby every other day, in the same place and almost at the exact same time. She had heard stories of human magic users that could transform into animals, it was her theory that this cat may be one such magic user. Lending credit to this explanation was the fact that the feline had a much larger magical presence than any normal animal she'd encountered. It came very close to Harry's own presence and power, this cats magic felt like it was fortress. As if the magic were stones in a nigh unbreechable wall, strong and unyeilding. Yet behind that fortress it softened, feeling like the love of a parent.
,' she muttered to herself. "Quite the contrary dear. You are the one who saved the wizarding world, as a babe no less. From He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. The greatest dark wizard of all time. He gave you that scar on your forehead."
The young boy wanted to see if his assailant could be useful before he was absolutely dismantled. So he searched the old man's pockets, hoping to find a wallet, or even some pocket money. He found the former within an interior pocket on the breast of the jacket, along with some curious crumpled documents.
He reached into his magic, and directed it toward the section of the fence in front of him. He twisted his magic until he felt it click, and he willed the steel of the fence to deform and bend. He went as quickly as he could, while making as little noise as he could manage. He stopped when he had just enough clearance to walk through. He was lucky that there was no patrol nearby, he hoped that it would last.
Harry then acted more out of instict than thought. With a few movements of his hands, the entire ceiling collapsed in a strip behind him. A cloud of dust and large hunks of rubble and debris rained onto the floor and walkways. Then a series of cells opened on the opposite side of the curtain of damage. Harry continued to flee toward where he had originally entered, as prisoners spilled out of their cells and made a charge for the platoon.
So Harry stood before the wall, and prepared himself. Steeling his nerves and building up the magic within himself. He aimed his will at his target, and allowed the energy to rush forth with explosive force. It flew away into the hall in a cascade of bricks, shrapnel, and dust. This accompanied by a smattering of twisted metal and other structural elements. The hallway was filled with the echos of collapsing infrastructure, accompanied by screams and yells uttered by the several guards attempting to enter the records room.
There were mainly restaurants and cafés in this town, along with a few petrol stations, and various other service providers. Some flats were also nearby, within walking distance of his alley. A couple of times he stopped by the front windows of shops that sold food, looking longingly at their goods. He hadn't eaten or drank anything since last evening, when he had been drugged. Thinking about it made him nauseous, and he craved to erase the taste of it from his mouth.
Harry thought for a moment. He didn't really know what love entailed. He hadn't ever really experienced it. So, he said what he imagined love to be.
He called quietly into the night, hoping she was awake. Or that she even had the energy to carry out any sort of conversation.
He pushed his glasses up his nose. "Simple really, cease all contact with Harry potter until it comes time for him to start his schooling as Hogwarts."
He headed off on his way, disappearing down the street, humming a meandering tune to himself. Harry knew that man wasn't trust worthy, as kind and eccentric as he seemed, there was some whisper of insincerity that crept through to Harry's intuition. The fact that he was a wizard, and that he was looking for his teacher were also warning signs.
Harry decided he should explore his new environment, a small city that he discovered was a considerable distance from the Dursley residence by way of a map. Said map was appropriated from a small travel shop nearby to his alleyway hideout. Unfortunately Delphinium could not accompany the boy without suspicion or outright causing panic.
Harry narrowed his eyes behind his mask. "Be as quick as possible. Do nothing other than retrieve that list."
Tears came back to his eyes, and he closed them. The tears dripped slowly to the floor of the cupboard. They remained like that for a while, content with each other's presence.
Since he was up, he decided to contemplate his most recent and pressing issue. Uncle Vernon has been looking at him strangely for the last few months, glaring frustrated at Harry when he thought he wasn't aware. The obese man almost looked like he wanted something from Harry, maybe to beat the living hell out of him again. Nevertheless, Harry didn't know how to approach the problem.
"Bollocks! If you were trully concerned about his safety you would have him placed under my care, or under Remus' care even. Give him to someone who could nourish him, give him an environment where he can grow appropriately! If you cared, you'd not leave him in that place. Where they starve and beat him, and Merlin knows what else."
Harry elected to focus on the other items in the sink, such as the plates. His hands were aching from scrubbing though, which turned out to be a massive disadvantage. As he was reaching over to the dish rack, his fingers gave out, while he was holding a plate.
His excuse for classifying the event was that he wanted to prevent panic and hysteria in the wizarding world. Minerva suspected that he was simply trying to preserve his own ego. It had already bean bruised quite heavily within the upper government level, he struggled to maintain his influence. If word reached the public that the Boy Who Lived was missing, Dumbledore's image would be unsalvagable.
The obese man spat the words at Harry, but the tone was different from how he usually addressed the child. There was something about it that utterly terrified Harry, it sounded hungry, lecherous. The man's eyes seemed glazed over with an emotion Harry didn't understand. The boy squirmed, attempting to break his bonds in vain. His struggling got more frantic as Vernon stepped closer, Harry noticed the roll of duct tape grasped in one of those hammy fists.
He finished the entire glass in a series of gulps. He set the glass down and sucked down a few large breaths of air. He looked down at his food, a cold messy casserole made from various leftovers and such. He mechanically spooned some of the slop into his mouth and cringed with each bite. It was disgusting, the flavours mixed in an awful way. All the ingredients were days old. None of that was aided by the fact that it was absolutely frigid. The same bittersweetness lingered in the background.
His knee bobbed with anxiety. More problems seemed to arise with every solution. Harry had to take a moment to comprehend what Delphi suggested next.
"You're very welcome, sir! Might anyone have any money to offer? This show is free, but I'm not very well to do."
He noticed that the man had a few scars on his neck and face. All of them were old and faded, earned years ago. They looked as if he had been clawed by an animal. His hair was light brown and he looked very tired and worn, but played his guitar expertly in spite of this.
He stomped toward the boy, belt still in hand; Harry no longer had the ability to attempt escape. A gigantic hand reached toward the mop of messy noir, and grasped it harshly. Vernon yanked the small boy down the hall to the cupboard, Harry almost screamed, and weakly raised his arms to grip the fatty digits pulling at his hair.
McGonagal leaned back into her chair, her nerves buzzing with relief and elation. Not only was Harry safe, but he was with Remus. That, and now she could operate while leaving Dumbledore unaware of her schemes. She still had to be careful, a single misstep and they could be discovered.
Everything began to rush to him, warped and fragmented flashes of being struck. The panic and fear began to rise up again in his chest. Emerald coloured eyes glazed over, as if he were no longer there. His breathing quickened more, until he was clearly hyperventilating. His hands were shaking visibly. McGonagal quickly realised something bad had happened, she needed to calm Harry down. She grabbed his shoulders gently and made him look at her.
And so, he sat there. Waiting. The world swam around him, his cupboard threatening to atomize and disintegrate. Inside, Harry could hardly muster a thought. Why wasn't he sad? Or angry? Or afraid?
"Lupin... I'll be seeing you, maybe. Have a nice day." Harry waved as he wandered in the general direction of his alley. He looked distractedly through shop windows as he walked, conceptualising new magic tricks for that evening.
"Help me to the front room, please." Harry said, Remus couldn't decipher whether it was a demand or a request. There was a hint of bitterness behind the otherwise neutral tone of his voice. Harry felt humiliated, having to be coddled by some stranger. He didn't want to be saved. He didn't want to place his trust in this man he barely knew.
Looking at price tags, he found he would have to work a little more to be able to comfortably afford an entire outfit. He decided to wait until that evening to put on another show, when the streets were filled with people hurrying home after a busy day. Until that time came, he continued to walk about.
Harry stored this information away for later, rifling through the wallet to find an ID card and about one hundred pounds. He stored the latter away in his pocket, and replaced the wallet with Crocker's ID in the interior breast pocket after wiping his fingerprints from everything he touched. He had heard enough crime shows in the background as he did chores to know about such things.
He quickly ran into the place, searching for anything that could lead him to his goal. On the wall was a directory, he followed it to the records room, in administration. He heard heavy footsteps approaching rapidly. He sprinted off as fast as he could towards the records office.
"Staying silent will not help your case, I'm afraid. So please, speak up. It'd be a shame to lose your job over something so abashedly stupid as not speaking to me, Minerva."
For the next few months the bespectacled boy would have nightmares, awaking every time in cold sweat, panicking wildly. In those nightmares, he dreamt of being abandoned by faceless people he felt he loved and cared for. When they faced him, he had that same crushing feeling as when McGonagal dismissed him. Eventually he became numb to them, waking suddenly, but laying there empty as tears flowed down his pallid cheeks. He continued to train his magic in secret, slowly getting more proficient at doing whatever he could imagine.
Harry, however, almost never needed extra assistance. He would either quickly accomplish a task he was given, or keep trying until it was obvious even to him that he needed Mcgonagall to give him more instruction. Even when it was obvious the he needed help, asking for it was like pulling teeth. It didn't help that he almost always refused offers of assistance. Strangely the raven almost learned magic faster than the average Hogwarts student with a wand. Even more impressive, was his insistence on teaching himself to do most spells non-verbally.
He quickly gathered his composure, as if it hadn't ever broken. "Well, with that, I'll be returning to my other duties." He walked to the door as he said this. As he placed his hand on the doorknob to her classroom, he turned his head back to look at her.
The man hesitated for a moment, before deciding to humor Harry. He began to walk closer. "Come come! Stand before me, and wonder at my magic!"
Harry set his jaw in place, trying not to grind his teeth. His eye twitched slightly. He tried to calm himself, the raven adjusted his stance and drew a few deep breaths. Ok. He threw himself at his task again. He searched inside himself deeper this time. He looked and looked, he felt as deep as he could. Mental tendrils groping around for any trace of that cold raging fire described to him. He began to grow angry again as he found nothing. His frustration boiled like an overfull tea-kettle duct taped shut on an over heating stove. His eyes snapped open and he let out a low growl from deep in his throat, it almost hurt. Something flashed forward within him, he grasped it and let it billow forth like a gale at his target.
“Don’t ask me complicated questions when I’m drunk.” He groaned and moved closer. “Why are we drinking together again?”
There he was, running his hands through Potter’s hair as he laughingly told him the full story of the Polyjuice incident.
“Fine. Why does Malfoy even need a fucking job, anyway? He’s got his manor and his trust fund and – “
“Sure,” he said. He didn’t feel very changed at all, really. He was still just Harry, and he was beginning to worry that might not be enough anymore. “How about your love life?”
“Ok, good. Wait, no. Whatever. Anyway, Lavender was always so pretty and polished and put together. She used three different perfumes, did you know? Applied in three different ways. And I’m – “ She gestured at herself.
“It’s going to be hysterical,” said Morag when Harry found her smoking outside the front gate, and refused to elaborate further.
“It’s going to be all right,” said Ron, when Harry was signing him in at the main office. “I’ll just have a nice talk with Hermione, easy like. Hermione, I’ll say, we’re still mates, and as mates I care about you. I just want to make sure that you make good choices – wait, no. That sounds like I’m telling her her choices aren’t good.  They are good at the moment. I don’t want bad future choices. Unless she’s already shacked up with Malfoy. She hasn’t, has she? Has she, Harry?”
“Well,” said Blaise idly. “I’ve gotten you drunk and been a perfect gentleman. I suppose it’s time for us to have sex now.”
“I’ll win them back,” said Blaise, who was already double-fisting bottles of champagne. “Are we ready for the countdown? Got any new year’s resolutions, lads and ladettes?”
“Wayne Lightfoot, when I first came out,” said Morag, her voice a low growl. “Gave me a long speech about how much he fancied me. He started tearing up. Asked me to just kiss him once, to give him closure. I felt like I was hurting him if I didn’t.”
“Well, that is my type,” he said. “Look, you just looked like you were going to cry, all right? I thought you’d prefer if people didn’t see that.”
“Did you get that from…?” Dean trailed off, looking uncomfortable and fascinated, and Morag laughed.
“Hannah!” Harry jumped out of his seat and hugged her, which was possibly weird to do. Their only major interaction had been her wearing a Potter Stinks badge, after all. “What are you doing here? Sit down, have a drink – “
“I don’t know what I’m going to do,” said Harry eventually, his pint blending with his mood to make him truly sour. “Blaise says to ignore him, Hermione says to ignore him, but I can’t, you know? He’s so –
He’d shrugged, hoping that would put her off, but instead she’d taken that as an opportunity to go through every single course she could find and quiz him on whether he’d ever found that subject interesting.
“Oh my god, seriously?” She practically jumped Parvati, throwing her arms around her. “Wait – I can’t do that, I can’t get something for free from Padma, I know she works so hard – “
Hey! Remember when I was posting this! Well it turns out that writing 30000 words in one night is actually a sign of an impending mental breakdown. All better now!
By the time the lights came on, Harry had to admit defeat. Draco was not anywhere in Eclectic. He apparated back to the edge of the Royal College, and half-jogged all the way to the dorm to find Nott smoking outside.
“Doooon’t.” She buried her face in her hands. “I have nothing to wear. Nothing. Do you think I could just not go?”
“She realised that she much preferred living in the style she was accustomed to and left him for another wealthy geriatric. Anyway, he’s dead now.”
“What’s up?” said Parvati. “We’re out of Chardonnay, or any white, or any wine really, so I’ve stolen a bottle of apple sours. Dean will be too embarrassed about owning it to ask who took it.”
“We didn’t actually get off in the end,” said Harry. “When we got to his room, Seamus was there and – yeah. It wasn’t pretty.”
“Yeah, sorry,” he said, patting her vaguely in the shoulder area. Draco was wearing a three-piece suit. Oh god, Harry was just wearing a blazer again. Couldn’t he have used his sort-of fame to rustle up some nice clothes? Why was he so useless?
Thankfully, Seamus was still on campus, because searching the whole of Windsor Great Park would have been a bitch. She found him sitting on a bridge above the ornamental water feature, throwing stones into the pool, and settled down beside him.
“It’s going to be fun,” said Seamus, when Harry saw him later. He was carrying a box of tinsel. “Absolutely grand. Nice to be invited, this time. Sure nobody is planning to kick me out of the group for hurting Dean’s precious feelings?”
“Jesus Christ,” said Malfoy, turning his face into the pillow. “I knew I was good in the sack, but I had no idea that I would literally fuck your brains out.”
“People only really started trying to kill me when I was eleven,” said Harry. Draco looked astonishingly well put together as always, his grey beanie turning his paleness elfin. It matched his horrible eyes. With his pea-coat and his skinny black trousers he looked like a French art student, or an off duty model. With his eyebrow raised like that he looked – like he was waiting for Harry to finish staring at him like an idiot.
There was a frantic hammering on the door. Harry looked at his watch. It was one in the morning, which meant that this was either Hermione coming to have another mental breakdown, or Draco – no. He clamped down on that hard. It wouldn’t be Draco.
Predictably, the universe shoved him and Malfoy together the next morning. Kind of. It slightly nudged him together. Harry did most of the rest of the work himself.
but the point still stood. And Harry had offered, hadn’t he? Draco knew where to come if he changed his mind. He would have put money that Draco would show up again that night.
“You ask far too many questions. Are you sure you didn’t miss your calling as an auror? Anyway, enough about me. What about you, Harry? Planning anything romantic for Saturday?”
“I was trying to charm her. I try and charm everyone. It’s just my thing. I’m charming.” There was a heavy silence. Blaise peeked out at them from a crack between his fingers. “I’m charming, right lads?”
Draco slammed his book shut. “For god’s sake, Blaise, have you really not learnt your lesson about saying the first thing that comes to mind?”
He looked a little bit lost, and lot bit broken. His face was still so close. There was something extraordinary about his eyes, when they weren’t full of fury – so large and open. Malfoy must have misread Harry’s face, because he bit his lip and moved even closer. “Please, Potter. She’s my Granger.”
whiskey,” said Draco. Pansy gestured to two in the middle. The smell of it made Harry’s stomach want to rebel, but he was
Come on. He was the Boy-Who-Lived, he could think of a great lie. Sure, he’d had a bad run recently, but he could do it now. The trick was just to act natural.
“Susan was just what?” And there she was in the doorway, eyes red. “Susan was pissed off at you, and rightfully so? Susan gave you exactly what you had coming?.”
“I doubt that,” said Harry, thinking of this morning where Draco had fucked him in the shower till he saw stars.
When he was gone, they all stood in a circle around Susan. Hermione felt whited out, blank. Depleted of everything except her anger.
“Mate,” said Ron, through the floo in Harry’s new room, “mate, Harry, mate. I’m having a crisis. I’m having a terrible crisis.”
“Oh I could have done that. ‘Harry now, entering the zone, reaching for the schnapps. His fingers are trembling – will it make it to his mouth?’ Who against?”
“Sitting out half our pub nights and generally wandering around in a daze,” said Susan. Harry had been sitting out a few pub nights, because sometimes just as they were leaving Draco would give him the
Hermione sighed. “What Dean is trying to say, Seamus, is that Ron and I broke up and I might not want to hear about him. But it’s
Harry leant against the wall and considered it. Malfoy was still not looking at him. Maybe he knew about his eyes and how they gave him away. His arms were held stiffly out from his body, his breath fast. He looked like he was bracing for a punch.
“Riiiiight,” said Parvati. “Well, I’m not sure where you got the idea that Morag’s celibate from. She’s almost as bad as Blaise.”
Draco laughed when Harry asked him about the slideshow. “There was only one slide,” he said, and touched his left arm.  “You avoid touching it.”
Harry was so engrossed in the mystery of Malfoy and the ball-point that he watched him make notes for a good twenty minutes, until he remembered that if people were making notes it probably meant the lecture had started. Ah, well. He’d conquered the mysteries of some of the most complex transfigurations, and he’d managed to get his Animagus form in three months. He could definitely follow along with simple right and wrong.
“Well, she shot him down in flames,” he said. “So I imagine she’s looking for a better calibre of person.”
It had been adrenaline. Adrenaline and possibilities that had caused his odd – reaction. That was all.
It didn’t matter, really, that Anthony had called her beautiful. It wouldn’t have mattered if everyone at this party had gotten down on bended knee and sung praises to her radiance, because Parvati didn’t want her. She’d known this, but now she
“All right,” said Harry. “I’ll do – I don’t know, something.” Malfoy nodded and drew away at that, leaving Harry a little bit shaken. “And I’ll talk to Ron, too,” he said quickly. “I mean, he probably already knows. I’m pretty sure they partnered her with him because of it.”
“Sure,” said Harry. In the kitchen, Hannah was standing awkwardly at the edge of the group, looking close to tears.
Hermione roared like a werewolf and lunged across the table. Harry grabbed at her as Draco grabbed at Pansy – who was actually
“Fuck off forever, Potter. Look, I know you can be a bit slow on the uptake, so try this – the closest you’re going to get to not having me here? It’s by
“We were talking,” said Draco. He was standing ramrod stiff, his expression somewhere between furious and scared. “In a heterosexual fashion. Because I’m not gay. Or bisexual.”
“That’ll have to be you, I’m afraid,” said Theo, but she didn’t hear Anthony’s reply. She had thrown herself around Susan’s neck and was holding on too tight to move.
“Potter!” said Blaise, pushing apart the tree they were in. “Are you – oh, no. Absolutely not. Pansy, seriously? Tonight is too important to mess up, so if you two must have life ruining sex – “
“Because you hated me, Harry.” Draco’s voice was soft, his smile uneven. “Well done. You have finally destroyed me.”
And it was at that moment, just as a bouncer hit them all with a body-bind, that Harry saw the flash of a camera going off.
She shook him off. “So if you came to give a big speech, don’t worry about it, because apparently I’m too pathetic to deserve one.”
I was fourteen, for fuck’s sake. He was eighteen. He was just being nice. He’d seen the articles Skeeter put out about me and Harry and he wanted to cheer me up, because he’s a gentle giant. I knew that, I just pretended I didn’t. Only two boys asked me to the Ball, and one was just being kind, and the other had run out of people to go with.”
“No wait, I want to guess. You had such fun guessing about me and Ginny. Did they decide you were as much a disappointment a son as you were a Death Eater? It’s not a good look, Malfoy, incompetent
“At the moment, I’m just waiting for someone,” said Parvati, staring into the hall as Hermione’s hand-gestures got ever more frantic.
“I’m gay,” she said. “Oh fuck, I mean I think I like boys – but not you – I mean I like you – but girls are – they have thighs.”
Draco blushed. That colour contrast – Harry could write poems about the pink and white of Draco’s face. So he did what seemed perfectly natural. He leant forward and kissed him.
“Right, well,” said Harry, a little awkwardly. “I’ll just – um – good luck with the job  hunt then, mate.” He flipped two hasty thumbs-up, and then rushed back over to his seat, feeling curiously hot.
“So he spent the rest of the night running full tilt at the furniture, and Pansy kept pulling it out of the way just in time so he was convinced he’d really passed through. We had to stop when he threw himself at a wall and started screaming.”
As they worked their way through Harry’s attempt at a fry-up – it was passable, even if it had nothing on Molly Weasley’s – he talked through his theory, going into great detail about their conversation last night. Hermione, true to her word, kept up a steady stream of encouraging monosyllables. At last Harry ran out of steam, and looked at her expectantly.
“You played dead,” said Malfoy, his eyes glittering. His lips were curved in something dangerously like a smile. “Pretty cunning of you.”
“You’re not supposed to know about that. And I’m just a fuck, didn’t you know? Harry’s just working out his sexuality. I’m not bitter.” He cracked his can and pushed himself upwards to drink. “I don’t want anything else either. I wanted a friendship, and now I have sex, which I also want. So really, my cup overfloweth.”
She was, he realised, expecting him to ask about the whole giving-him-over-to-Voldemort thing. Even worse, he realised that he had actually been about to ask her that, and had been apparently perfectly prepared to ruin the whole evening just to watch Pansy squirm. “Why did you decide to be an Auror?” he said, instead. That seemed safe.
She slammed the door in his face. From inside, Harry heard the unmistakable sound of vomiting. Harry hummed tunelessly and tapped his foot.
He’d almost decided not to go to university. He’d almost decided not to do anything, or rather decided not to make a decision. Ron had been going into auror training, and Harry had gone to one taster day and then gone back to Hogwarts shaking and thrown up a bit in the loo. Hermione had been ploughing through prospectus after prospectus in a way that seemed designed to stop her thinking about her new single life. Harry had spent most of his time lying on his back in front of the lake, basking in the May sunshine and hoping that McGonagall wouldn’t find him.
“Uh huh. Michael wrote a poem about you in sixth year, actually. Do you remember how you were paired with Oliver Rivers in Charms in Fifth Year? He practically took everyone else out at the knees trying to get the seat next to you.”
Blaise peered at the CD case wearily, and then pulled back, shocked. “Yes. Yes it is. How did you – “
Malfoy waved a hand. “No, no. He called me about an hour ago asking if I wanted a trial shift later today. I’ll have plenty of time to prove my dubious morality to him in person. But thank you, I suppose. For the apology and for the reputation boost.”
“Now that you’re parents have cut you off, you mean,” said Harry, and then resisted the urge to stomp on his own foot. So much for roundabout.
Malfoy get a job in a muggle pub? For some reason, the thought filled Harry with rage. Malfoy had just – he’d stood in a tower with a wand raised at Dumbledore unable to fire, and then he’d barely spoken at his trial and disappeared for eighth year, and now he was here at uni, trying to get a job in a pub as if he was some sort of normal bloke instead of – instead of Malfoy.
He pulled away to take in Draco, flushed and damp. “You love me,” he said, thick with the wonder of it all. Draco’s eyes widened, and –
“Right,” he said, in a very small voice, and Draco flashed him an odd look and went back to the previous silence.
“Because he thinks I’m dating Malfoy, not because he actually respects my humanity and personhood!” She slammed her hand on her desk. “Don’t tell me – he’s going to have a long talk with me at Christmas, and he’s going to try and convince me that all that arguing was just a sign we’re meant to be together, except now it will come with a side-dish of patronising concern because you told him I fancied Malfoy!”
Like, no, Seamus, I’ve spent the last six years constantly worrying about my parent’s reactions and putting up with their shit when I did come out just on a whim.”
“Just, I’ve never had to end things with someone I was only seeing casually before. I wasn’t sure how much was too much, you know? I want to treat this with the appropriate gravitas, but not too much gravitas, otherwise I’m essentially implying that you were far more into me than you were – but you beat me too it, and honestly I’m so glad, there’s so much more for us to explore – “
Draco looked between them all, appealingly. When no help came, he turned to Pansy. “Refuse him, Pans.”
Hermione had hmm’d and left him to it, and then a day later there was a prospectus on his bed open on a page about a new, experimental degree in Teaching Magic, and there was a recommended reading list, and a week later Harry had a future.
“It’s all right. The uni grounds are charmed against Howlers. I might get dive bombed on the next night out though.”
“Oh my god,” said Parvati, struggling to get herself under control. “Ok. Wow. Yeah. So you’re little speech earlier, about how boys just don’t like you because you’re such a special snowflake? Not so much, babe.”
There had to be some way to make this, whatever he’d done, ok. He thought of all those golden moments with Draco, the way they’d twined in bed afterwards and chatted about nothing. That couldn’t be over, could it? Not when Draco was the one who’d pushed him away. He’d pushed him away – and there was the anger, flying with the fear like two Seekers chasing a snitch around his stomach.
“I’ll walk up with you, Harry,” said Dean, and Harry smiled gratefully as they fitted their arms together. A muscle in Seamus’s jaw twitched. They made it up the carpet, Harry’s smile slowly turning into a homicidal grimace, passing Hermione and Parvati who seemed to be stopping at every single reporter and talking about their dresses.
“I honestly care zero percent whether Draco Malfoy lives or dies,” she’d said, “but I’d do what Hermione wants before she has an opportunity to shout at you more. Your girl’s fucking scary.”
And they stayed there, just a little while, until Parvati pulled away with her eyes glistening and announced that Hermione still needed to take her shot of tomato gin.
“If you think learning is the point of the next few years, you’re not doing them right,” said Blaise.
Draco was tight and warm and glorious, and Harry had to grip his hands into fists to stop himself from coming. He thrust in, shallow at first, running his hands gently across Draco’s trembling back.
“A what, Harry,” whispered Draco. His eyes were disappointed, and in that moment Harry hated them. People should be able to hide what they were feeling. It was only good manners.
“I admire her,” said Draco, lying supine after Harry had given him a blowjob worth “five stars,” apparently. “She’s a brilliant witch, and she should know how many options she had. Thank god she didn’t settle down with the weasel and sink into domestic stupefaction.”
"Well- well..." he trailed off, not knowing how to tell her he'd just spent nearly a week unable to move because his violent uncle beat him severely with a belt. His mind suddenly wandered to the memory of it. The ravens breathing became short, the pace of each breath quickening.
Harry twitched, the hair on his neck prickled. He heard heavy, thumping footsteps, accompanied by lighter yet still intimidating ones. Harry turned to veiw the source of his growing dread. Coming toward him was Dudley and his pitiful posse. Harry looked over his cousin with disdain and disgust. He looked at would have been a nice polo shirt, except it bulged with the excessive mass of the child wearing it. Sweat had already begun to darken the creame coloured garnmemt, outlining the gross rolls of Dudley's body. Funny, thought Harry, it isn't that hot out.
Harry was curious, there was a mark? He, Harry Potter, had used magic (unbelivable) to throw his attackers away and carve a mark into the dirt (also unbelievable). Yeah, sure. Magic and talking snakes can't be real.
The wizard looked at her from the corner of his eye. "Hm, I doubt you could. I've just discovered something troubling, just today."
He waited until everyone was definitely in their homes, tucking into bed or eating their dinner, maybe watching the telly. Then he made his way to the costume shop. As he approached the door, he unlocked it with magic, and slipped inside, Delphi trailing behind him.
"Behold, there is no longer a pen! In it's place, a cigar!" Harry declared, lifting his hand to reveal a thick cigar. Now there was a tiny crowd watching his little play. A small chorus of gasps and "oooooooh's" ran through it.
"Deserved to die? What about the officers?" Remus rebuked, his horror intermingling with his own anger.
Harry opened his eyes suddenly, it was the middle of the night. Those faceless people flashed before him again, the crushing weight on his chest. He was ten years old now, he could no longer comfortably sit up in his tiny cupboard. Nor could he lie remotely flat. These days he laid curled up in a ball on his side, hugging his extremities to his body.
The moment it became apparent that something was different, panic set in. It took all of his will to not hyperventilate, images of what Vernon did 4 years ago flashed across his vision. He was reminded of the sense of helplessness, the vulnerability. Why was he here? What did Vernon plan to do to him? Why was he naked?
"Another minute or so, plus a couple more for printing. The list is a couple pages long, or so." The man's voice had calmed down a bit, but it still shook with fear and anxiety. His curiosity was piqued by something about Harry. "How old are you?"
What could he do to treat his wound? How severe was it? Harry had no clue, but it was more important to reach his alley first.
She stayed silent, surprise and fear mixed within her like a clumsy students cauldron. She knew lying would do nothing, she had just been caught in her act. She elected to remain silent, her lips tightened and her eyes steeled over with grim determination.
A small voice whispered, almost being lost among the white noise. The visions continued to warp and shift around him, his head was dunked into a paint mixer of tortures.
Going to the owlry made her nervous, and she didn't have a personal owl. Then an idea occurred to her: why not use a student's owl? But then, who's owl? It had to be a dependable student, one she could trust. Someone smart, but not potentially devious like a slytherin. Bravery wasn't really a necessity, she could simply lie about the contents of the letter, and the likelihood of accidental revelation though lack of care was anxiety inducing. With Gryffindor out, she realised that hufflepuff was a bit too unpredictable, she couldn't be sure their loyalties would lie with her. Her use of their owl could spread through the house.
Harry continued to flee at the maximum speed he could muster. Which wasn't incredibly fast, he was in agony. He limped heavily, and each step was nauseatingly painful. He walked generally in the direction of the city, doing his best not to lose consciousness from pain alone.
After the first twenty minutes of spreading fertilizer over one of the flower beds Harry had made the decision to talk to the mysterious cat that lurked around his reluctant residence. He stopped manipulating the nitrogen enriched mulch and wiped his brow with his shirt. After a quick look at his surroundings, he made off toward the wall where the cat was inconspicuously lazing about with her tail wagging slowly and rythmicly. She startled as she felt him come near, her head snapping up when he approached her for the first time ever. She made no move to run away, he may have thought she was just a friendly stray.
Harry returned to where the blocked door stood. He hadn't taken the time to think of how he would escape the office. He considered that he could simply, remove the wall. The officers would likely be injured in the process. Potentially even killed. Though Harry didn't exactly mind that prospect, they were obstructing him from his ambition.
His eyes sparkled with that familiar cunning. "If you're so concerned about him, as to leave Hogwarts in the middle of lessons, it may actually be worth my direct intervention. I should visit him myself, see what he is getting up to." His tone had just a hint of his self satisfaction.
"I'm sorry to tell you that from this point forward, I will no longer be able to teach you, or interact with you in anyway until it comes time for you to attend Hogwarts. This will be the last time we see each other, I apologize. Goodbye, Harry Potter." With that, she turned and walked away. Her voice had sounded as if she didn't want to be speaking to him.
The womans face fell further. This had gotten way out of hand. Even before he had come to face her, everything was so wrong. He didn't know who he was, what he'd done, where and what he belonged to. Everything he'd ever been fed was lies.
Harry breathed heavily, staring at the desiccated corpse of his uncle. His legs suddenly couldn't take his bodyweight, and he sank to his knees. He slumped down, and barely managed to stay upright. An emotion he couldn't describe rose up into his chest, he let out a guttural and primal scream. It almost felt like his vocal chords were about to tear.
He was glad to have the serpent, she made a good friend, and excellent company when he was lonely. He winced again as he stepped toward the most immediately visible patch of weeds, being sorely reminded of his recent injury. That would be a hindrance.
This turned out to be a mistake, as the moment he moved his injured leg it essentially exploded with pain. Emerald eyes squeezed shut and his jaw clenched, he resisted the urge to cry out. He grunted through gritted teeth and looked at himself. He was naked with the exception of his boxer briefs and a very large T-shirt that he assumed belonged to Remus. It smelled of dog, he picked a long black hair out of the well worn cotton. Delphi seemed only mildly perturbed by these movements.
Harry returned to the alleyway, trying to push the image of the guitarist from his mind. He had an idea for how to make money anyway. He could become a street performer!
She sighed and rested her head in her hands, rubbing her temples. She would have to continue her contemplation later, it was bringing her undue stress. Besides, she needed to finish her grading.
Suddenly the raven became aware of a shifting mass surrounding his body, he remembered that he still had Delphinium. She spoke to him softly.
"Aw, look at Potty, by 'imself in the dirt. Lookin' fer bugs to eat I bet. Like some dirty lil bird!"
Hello, I'd really appreciate if you readers could comment your critiques about the story! Especially for the chapters from this point forward. I need to find my groove again, so the writing may be stylistically different from the previous four.
Instructing Harry turned out to be an amazingly easy task, especially considering he did not have a wand. But outside of teaching him, it was a difficult experience. Scheduling and secrecy were hard to work out. She tried to mostly work with him on weekdays, on account of the other male occupants of the house were at school and work respectively. Meaning that they only had the attention of one person to avoid. But this came with the consequence of needing a decoy to stand in for her at Hogwarts.
"What are you doing?" Inquired Harry, preparing to stop the man from performing some act of treachery. He hissed for Delphinium to strike if necessary, she reared up in response.
It was a good idea, one that he had already thought of. It wasn't lethal, as long as Harry didn't mess about Vernon wouldn't even be harmed in the process.
The next blow followed swiftly, striping across his shoulder and face. Then his legs. The pain made his muscles spasm, he couldn't curl up his body anymore. His torso was exposed, opening him up to a more furious barrage of blows. His cries rang through the whole house, the pale boy tried crawling away. Another mistake, he was slow, and moving on his belly exposed his backside. The mountain of flesh struck him again and again across his back, thighs, and buttocks. Every place he could conceivably be struck with a belt suffered injury.
Delphi responded, her tone matched his own. She was filled with the fear, she couldn't help but think that Harry was going to die.
"Gather around for a little show everyone! I am about to amaze you!" Harry called out to the passers by on the street. Few seemed to take any interest, one or two stopped for a second to look at Harry before continuing on their path. Some seemed to be headed to their flats for dinner.
"Watch as I transform this pen before your very eyes!" He declared, placing the cloth over the pen and slipping his hand between the pen and the cover.
This message must remain a secret, ultimately so. The information I'm about to reveal could prove dangerous to us. It's in regards to Harry: I know he's missing."
His face was wet with tears, and now they flowed forth with increased fervor. She unraveled him from her coils and allowed him to hug her.
Harry abandoned the shadows, and strutted up to the main gate. The guards immediately took notice of the short human being garbed in a completely black plague doctor's outfit. They didn't quite know how to address someone breaking into the prison, and Harry's stature caught them off guard. Cautiously they placed their hands on their firearms.
Now he was standing several feet from the doors, heavy duty, electronically activated. He focused his magic on the door, letting build, and build, and build. He allowed it to feel as if it were about to lose control, before releasing it at the door. The blast was deafening, Harry had to cover his ears. Even still, his ears were left ringing. He looked forward through the doorway, seeing no one injured by his little explosion.
Harry scrutinized Lupin, taking time to observe more of his features. Remus' face was pale, and sagged as though he were a middle aged man. Yet it still seemed supple like that of a gentleman in his 30's. The deep bags beneath his slightly sunken eyes were dark. Sleep was a chaste stranger to him.
He was relieved to find that there didn't seem to be anyone pursuing him. He supposed that all the chaos he had caused had overwhelmed the facility too much for them to immediately dispatch any squads to arrest him. He considered it a blessing, but decided to focus on getting back to his alleyway. He had no idea how to proceed from there.
"Do as you like, I can only advise you. Your authority supersedes my own." She said, a hint of defiance tinted her tone. The Headmaster seemed momentarily taken aback, like he expected her to fight further, and prove his internal hypothesis.
Albus' mouth twitched slightly, she was beginning to irritate him. "I won't have you using that sort of tongue toward me. I am your superior, I won't hesitate to use that against you. I am under the impression that you like your job. It'd be a shame if you lost it, for using inappropriate language toward the headmaster."
He smiled, he'd heard Petunia conversing with one of the neighbours about the steadily declining rodent population. The serpent definitely improved the quality of his cupboard, he no longer woke up to mice and rats scratching in the walls. This, and the rodent feces had disappeared from his space, remaining gone after he had swept it out.
Dumbledore turned in his chair to greet the arriving owl with an expectant look. It grasped a letter in its talons, the seal on it told him it was from the prime minister. Dumbledore took the letter and sent the owl on its way.
He gave in and quenched his dry throat. He didn't realise how thirsty he was until he began drinking. He finished the glass in several large gulps.
He was entering his town, the street lights made his eyes hurt. It was getting harder and harder to breathe, his sight was blurring into blobs and streaks. He stumbled for a few more blocks before collapsing. Near the end of the street he saw a silhouette. He babbled an incoherent stream of noises that were supposed to be a call for help. His vision faded momentarily to black.
The stern faced woman was beginning to lose her patience again. She'd been making perfectly reasonable arguments and requests the entire conversation. The way Tom Riddle had grown to be crossed her mind. She questioned if he really took this seriously, which was pretty fair considering his suspicious willingness to sit idly by and let this child be abused and caged like something feral.
Harry said passively, he didn't mind learning about those. Though he was more interested in defense against the dark arts, because they seemed more interesting and practical, considering who he was.
He woke up to the noise of feet treading the sidewalk down the alley, and grey sunlight filtering down from above. His butt and lower back were killing him. He forgot how he got there, wherever he was. He wondered what happened last night.
"I've been told not to talk to strangers, mister." Harry replied, innocently, but verging on being curt.
"Show me the your records for all child predators in your custody, I want to know where they are. Be quick!" He shouted those last words. He hissed at Delphinium to release, allowing the man to scramble to the records room. Harry followed closely behind, a loud series of banging noises indicated the arrival of a group of officers.
Harry felt panic rising in his chest already. "Uh, yeah, I should be heading home now. I'm very sorry to wake you up, sir."
Harry considered using Remus while he could, exhausting what resources he could before moving on to wherever else he wished.  He couldn't very well stay in this town. Not with both Remus and the authorities attempting to trace him, and very possibly other wizards.
"But fear not, I've found him. He's in poor form, very poor. Though he's alive, and safe, for the time being. He's been through much abuse, at the hands of those who were supposed to protect him. He has surprising control over his magical abilities. I think that Dumbledore is aware of what Harry was suffering, how could he not?"
The game was definitely up now, they both knew for sure of the other. The Cat looked around, making sure those bastard relatives weren't keeping watch. No one was, so she locked eyes with the green ones before her and flicked her tail. A gesture that he took as "follow me."
The witch opened a drawer to her left, removing a sheet of parchment from it. She wrote to Remus, giving him more information on the situation in regards to Dumbledore, and giving more background. She also expressed her gratitude for making the effort to house the child.
Professor McGonagal swallowed, there was no way she could escape this. "Can you grant me one thing, Albus?"
"You seem to underestimate the strength of a mother's love, Minerva." His blue eyes weren't so much as lazily gazing in her direction. Instead, they were staring with scrutiny upon the documents placed in front of him on his desk. He absently made scribbles and notations on the pages.
