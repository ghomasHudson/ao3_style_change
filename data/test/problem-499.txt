“Can I lay with you? Just to sleep. I want to wake up with you in my arms.”
He walked to the Hogwarts gates past the wards and apperated.
Aries finished getting his ingredients and went back to his station. When he got back, he got a look from Draco.
“Yes, Aries? What is it? Are you in pain again?” He worried.
************
Draco nodded and pulled up Harry’s shirt, exposing his stomach. He fired the numbing spells as best as he could. Draco was not trained medically. The only reason he worked as one for Tom was because he was smart and read a lot of medical books. He was the best trained in the room and they couldn’t wait for Poppy to get here.
“Don’t you Dragon me until you have explained. Does Severus know who you are? What would he do if I told him. Not to mention Tom.”
“Severus? What are you doing here? I never thought I would see you sitting courteously with Mr. Potter.” She said when she saw him. She had a warm, inviting smile on her face that screamed, proud mother.
They are almost asleep when Harry whispers, “Don’t forget, you told Lily you would take to get a pet tomorrow. I vote for a snake. Or a crup. Or a kneazle.”
They quickly went into the Ally and started shopping. By the time they needed to meet Ron and Hermione they were finished and Harry was exhausted.
“No, you deserve to be tossed out on your arse. I don’t want to share a dorm, let alone a school with a death eater,” he pointed to Draco, “Or death eater spawn.” He pointed to Harry. Murmurs rose up through the crowd.
“Well, not much to me really. I am Slytherin as they come. My favorite colour is purple. I am obsessed with sweets. Orange chocolate to be exact, but I won’t discriminate against other things. I have a minor obsession with dragons. I am the seeker for my house team even though I would be a much better chaser. That is just about it.”
“Draco, at what point did I stop talking?” Harry said glancing up at the man next to him.
“Oh, I will.”
“They didn’t take my wand this time. Pretend you need to take me upstairs or Lily could get sick from being down here. Take me to Tom.”
“Draco, would you come to the dungeons with us? Mione would you explain to Nev?” They all nodded and set off.
“Harry! We have to get Lily out. Right now! We can’t move you.” Draco and Snape ran to Harry.
“What makes you think we would do that? Who the bloody hell are you?” Vernon replied.
He landed in the cell he had first woken up in. He looked at the girl, his head swimming.
“Dray. Pleas-please hurry. I want you in me.” Harry pants.
“You didn’t have any champagne at the reception either. Are you feeling okay?”
After they all finally calmed down, Harry asked the question they feared answering.
leave his son blind or heal him to where he didn’t need glasses. The choice was obvious. Other than the other minor cuts and bruises, Snape was done. He spelled several blood-replenishing, pain, and general healing potions into his stomach. Now all they could do was wait.
Hermione knelt down and said, “don’t worry Harry we will get you to Madame Pomfrey. Neville has Ron.” She released him from the body bind.
“Three drops lasts an hour. By only taking one we shorten that time frame. It does not lower the potency, just the time frame.” He answered.
“Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? Wait. You’re pregnant? Wow! Come on girls. Give them a few minutes. She’s safe with Mr. Potter.”
Snape looked at him and raised an eyebrow. “You decided to come into my room at one in the morning to eat ice cream?” Harry just nodded again. Snape put his hand to his face and simply said, “Why? Why didn’t you invite me?”
Harry had finally calmed down in his sleep so Draco made to move back to his own bed, when something pulled on his shirt. He looked down to see Harry had latched onto it and didn’t seem to be letting go anytime soon. Draco slid Harry over and crawled into the bed next to him. Harry snuggled close and Draco snuggled back. He laid looking at the beautiful face next to him and it made his heart hurt. He vowed right then and there, that Harry’s child will never know of the pain Harry went through, only happiness. He would protect her as his own.
“Are you okay? Weasley can be a real idiot sometimes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That is fine. Now go tell them.” Snape rolled his eyes.
. Sign now!” Snape said.
“I’m fine. Told him the lie we came up with and he bought it.Was very happy with me. I’ll tell you later. What happened? I got back, both rooms were empty, and I knew to come here.”
“You are right. I’m sorry. You are still just a little girl to me. Yes, Ron hurt me, but we are both fine. Just a little sore.”
He lays next to Harry, who puts his head on his chest.
“I want you to know, no matter what, I am here for you. Night or day. You say the word and I drop everything to be there. I-”
“Well, Tuney, I do believe that is the last we see of that freak.” A large man came down the stairs. He had blood covering his front. Petunia looked at her husband and paled more.
“Wait. Harry’s alive? You lied to me? All I have ever wanted to do is apologise for how I used to treat him, but you told me he died. I could have apologised? Mother, Father you are going to sign those papers. You are going to do it now. I am going to stay with Piers for a few days. I am just glad Dani got out while she still could. I will never forgive you. Please tell Harry how sorry I am. For everything.” With that Dudley turned and left, slamming the door behind him.
“Who is this? I haven’t seen you before. You shouldn’t be with the snakes. They will only infect you.” Ron said with a glance back at Draco.
“He will never see Lily. We will figure something out. Don’t worry. Your boyfriend and child will be safe.” Snape said with a raised eyebrow.
“Tadpole?” Snape chuckled with tears slowly overflowing his eyes.
The trio walked to the Great Hall in time to hear Minerva scream, “Like hell you are. You will be doing no such thing to that boy. Do you understand me?”
“Well if it is anything other than Slytherin, I will be surprised. Mother and Father were both in Slytherin.”
He nodded and said, “Okay, but if anything even questionable happens, we port key right back. Promise?”
Harry nodded and grabbed his Father’s hand. “Do it. Just remember your promise.”
“I love you, Harry.”
“Are you with anyone, and if yes, who?”
“Okay, come inside and we can talk. Tea anyone?” He said with a huge smile on his face.
Thank you for going on this journey with me as I write my first fanfiction. I already have ideas for my next one so stay tuned. I love all of you so much!!
“Ok, rules. Someone will spin the bottle, whoever it lands on has to pick truth or dare. You cannot refuse. When done, that person spins, etc. Who goes first?” Pansy explained.
“Dani? Dani, do you remember me?” Harry asked.
It had shocked everyone when Snape told everyone he was getting married. No one, not even Harry, knew he was dating anybody. Getting to call Remus, Dad, had made Harry happy though. Dani was ecstatic. She had been permanently adopted by the pair earlier that year and loved the attention her two dads gave her. She was a very doting Aunt as well. Lily loved her Aunt almost as much as her Mum and Dad.She is just about to finish her fourth year at Hogwarts. She and Dudley still wrote to each other every now and then, but it was nothing compared to the relationship with Harry.
A group of sixth year Slytherins were in the common room, studying, when Pansy got an idea.
After a few minutes it subsided.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry this one is short. Been busy but will try to get better.
“Well it was when the Dark Lord told you about Tadpole. You had screamed at him when he came in, then he told you. You looked at your stomach. You were about three months along, so I don’t know why we hadn’t connected the dots before. You sat down and didn’t speak again until this morning. Even when you tried, you couldn’t.” Draco told him.
The boy in the doorway looked in, turned and shook his head.
Chapter 3
“Why are you bringing first years into my private chambers, Mr. Potter?” Snape sneered.
Draco laughed at that. “I can’t even imagine. It is weird enough having him married to my Godfather.”
“Me too.” Came another.
“How- How has it been since you got here? Getting to know your parents?”
“Ok, what did Granger do to me at the end of third year?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If Aries is actually gone nothing will happen since we never had more children. If he is, a trail of green smoke will appear next to him. I have to know.”
At this point Lily had stopped moving and Harry was getting very worried. Ron kneeled down on the floor. “I wish you had never come back.” He spit on Harry’s cheek. He reeled his arm back making a fist. Harry knew what was going to happen and prepared. Just as Ron’s fist made contact with Harry’s eye, Ron was thrown off him.
He still hung out in Gryffindor with Hermione, Neville, and Ginny. While Ginny had been absent for the first part of school, she had definitely made up for it. They had charmed the ring, so only those who knew about it could see it. Outside of those who were present, only Hermione knew. They still didn’t know who the spy was, so they didn’t trust anyone one hundred percent. They had tested Hermione under Veritaserum at her insistence. She didn’t want anyone to doubt her. They had also found out she had started dating Luna.
Promises. Looks. Kisses. And finally when Draco loved Harry with everything he had.
“Just answer the question, you insolent brat.” Snape replied. More chuckles filled the room.
YEAR 13: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS), SEVERELY LACERATED SKIN(BACK, CHEST, ARMS, LEGS), DEMENTOR ATTACK, HARD FALL (30+ METERS), CONCUSSION, RIB FRACTURE(LEFT), MAGICAL EXHAUSTION, BRUISED ESOPHAGUS, ANAL TEARING(RAPE, MULTIPLE), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
HOW RARE IS THIS? He wrote.
“Oh will I? You are saving the life of the one person on Earth other than Dumblefuck I want dead. You had better believe I am pissed.” A voice said from outside the room.
“Even though her father is one of the worst living creatures on the planet, she is mine too. She is half of me. I really do hope you are okay with this. After all she is going to need her Grandfather.” Harry had a small smile on his face.
“You can’t hurt me, Tom. Not if you want to save her. You’re done.”
He rolled as best as he could out of his bed and went to the loo. He was on his way back to his bed when a knock sounded at the door. Only a few people knew where his room was, but only he, Draco, and his father knew the password. He went and opened the door.
Draco knew exactly what memory it was. He prayed Harry didn’t finish it. He wouldn’t be able to breathe if Harry did then said no.
“Well, Harry, We need to make plans. I think I want a big house. Merlin knows we can both afford it. I want a lot of kids. I already love Lily, but I want more. We can get married next fall. That is a year away, but it seems too long. I haven’t even asked you yet. I bought a ring though. I keep it in my pocket at all times. I know we haven’t been together long, but it feels like we have. I know we will be together for a long time. It is inevitable. The house though, needs to be near a park. Once Lily gets bigger, I feel like she will love that. We can make picnic lunches, then we can take her to the park. I think we might get a dog, too…”
“You see sir, I came across an old diary of Snape’s last year. In it was a whole entry on Aries and Tom Riddle. I read between the lines. It even mentioned Aries’ birthmark on his knee. A simple unbreakable glamour later and Aries was born, or should I say reborn. They both saw the birthmark and didn’t even question it. Ever since I have been Aries. I would have told you sir, but the less anyone knew, the better.”
It took forever to finish this chapter because it was so hard to write. Please review!!
“Yes, Sev. Why?”
“With my uncle who was not my uncle.” It wasn’t a lie, just not descriptive.
“I want to wake up with you in my arms, too.” Aries whispered.
“Come on, Dragon, or we will be late for charms.” Aries winked again and walked out of the room leaving a shocked Draco behind.
**********
“Well, if you want to be frank, I want to know how you did it? How did you con our beloved potions master into believing you are Aries Snape? Or should I say Riddle?”
“Tom! You-um. Look, I have to save him. I don’t know why. I just feel the overwhelming need to keep him alive. I can’t not help him. Look at his face and tell me you want me to let him die. If you really want him dead, I’ll let him die right now.” Snape demanded.
“Dragon? Where are we going? Are you okay?” Draco just ignores him. He leads him to the bedroom. Without words, he pushes Harry to the bed.
“If you are going to waste kisses, you better use them right.” Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes. He lowered his face to Harry’s. Their lips brushed. Harry pushed forward. Draco pushed right back drawing a small gasp from the other. Draco took that as his opening and pushed his tongue in. There was no burst of passion, no fighting for dominance, no pressure to go further. Just them lost in the moment.
Harry glared at the letter in his hands, then at the bird who had delivered it. He had read it twice just to make sure he had actually comprehended what it had said. He looked at it once more and tears came to his eyes. First he had lost Sirius, now the Weasleys and Hermione. They weren’t dead. No, far from it. They just wished he was.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry made a motion with his hand to signal his last thought.
Loving all the comments!!!! Thank you for so much support!!
“Please, Professor. Mister Snape is my Father. Call me Aries.” He replied with a smirk causing several giggles filled the room.
Several voices rose claiming to be with Harry. A smile grew on his face. Ron’s face on the other hand grew several shades of red.
Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Vincent, Draco, and Aries all sat down in a circle to play. Pansy transfigured an old quill into a bottle.
They both walked to Harry’s dorm. After borrowing some night clothes Draco laid down in Ron’s normal bed.
Harry smiled but nodded.
“Please, sit. Tell me about yourself. Where have you been this whole time?” Draco asked as they sat.
Draco freezes.
“Would you dry my hair? I hate when it is wet.”
Aries nodded and pulled back until he was almost out. He pushed back in roughly. He brushed Draco’s prostate on every brush taking Draco back to the writhing mess he had been. Aries felt the orgasm building. “Come for me Dragon. Come now!” Draco came quickly with a shout. Aries felt the muscles around him clamp down, drawing out his own orgasm.
“Well? You know it is considered rude to not reply when someone asks you a question.” Pansy said.
Harry rushed up the stairs and to his room. It was moments like this he really missed Sirius. Dumbledore told Vernon at the beginning of the summer that his godfather had died and to let him grieve. The only thing that accomplished was they were worse than before.
“There is way too much red in here. How do you come in here and not immediately not want to throw up?” Draco said as he looked around.
“Harry, she is in the girl’s dorm refusing to come out. I can try to get her, but can’t-” Hermione started.
“Harry has decided, since he can’t remember his stay here he wants to keep the child. It is a girl. Very healthy. He is planning to name her after his mudblood mother.” It hurt him to say these things, but knew it was necessary.
With tears in her eyes Petunia signed the papers and handed them to her husband. He looked at them then threw them on the table. “No. I don’t think I will. Dani is my daughter. She may be a freak, but I can still find a use for her.” Vernon said.
“It was fine mostly. Ron showed up and caused problems. I dealt with him though. I did mess with Draco a bit.” Aries proceeded to tell Snape about then train and dinner until curfew. At eleven Aries was sent back to Slytherin.
Several more things flashed through his head when he heard a voice.
YEAR 8: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS AND HANDS), SUICIDE ATTEMPT(RAT POISON INGESTED), FOUR BROKEN FINGERS( LEFT), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“Why, Ginny? I trusted you.” Darkness pulling him in.
He pulled away from him, letting his dick fall from his mouth much to both or their disappointment.
“Someone here about Dani.” He replied.
Aries and Draco spent most of their days of summer together. They talked for hours at end. They went to Diagon Alley to get their supplies together and Aries had Draco ‘show’ him around.
“Aries? Are you awake?” The voice whispered.
Draco was terrified of being called again. They had made up a lie about why he was with Harry, but he was still worried. As they walked to the tower his heart fell when his arm burned. The look on Harry’s face hurt him as he walked away. He had never been a religious man, but prayed that would not be the last look he saw on Harry’s beautiful face.
Draco made quick work of their clothes. He kissed Harry until he was hard and panting. Draco kissed and licked his way down Harry’s torso, pausing to pay attention to Harry’s nipples then continued. When he reached his target, He accioed the lube they kept in the side table.
“Yeah right. We were looking for Harry. You know, the guy that’s going to kill your precious Dark Lord?” Ron replied.
“Come to my room when you get back. Be careful.” Harry said. He had been worried about the inevitable meeting Draco would be called to.
“Sally?” Draco asked.
The next morning got there before anyone would have liked. They all trudged down to breakfast to wake up.
Snape pushed past him and walked to the living room, pulling out his wand. “Here is how this is going to go. I am going to give you a paper that signs Dani’s guardianship over to me. You both are going to sign it. You are not going to argue. You are not going to complain. Break any of these rules and you get hexed.” Snape was calm and focused.
“You really think I don’t know that? Me? I feel I would know more than anyone. You try marrying the asshole and get him to talk about anything else. Yes, he will be pissed, but he will have to get over it.”
********
Harry nodded and wrote in the air, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?
“Who do you have your eye on?”
He repeated Aries’ actions and Aries started on the questions.
Draco hated this plan, but Harry knew what he was doing. They ascended the stairs. Ready for the fight of their lives.
Harry’s heart leapt. Draco had been there from the start and still was here. However, Draco couldn’t look at him. He must have regretted it.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?
“She probably didn’t know how to. It is a rather unique situation.”
Skin rubbed against skin. This time the moan came from Aries as well.
“Draco, we are not going to start a zoo.”
“Harry, if you need anything, remember that you have a room in my quarters. Even if you just need to take a break. I know you love Granger and Draco, but anything at all and I’m there. I got this for you.” He pulled out a silver bracelet. It looked like two twigs intertwined with three emeralds in a line. “Just hit the middle gem three times quickly and it tells me your location. It would just make me feel better if you wore it. It has been charmed so only you can operate it or take it off. You are welcome in our quarters any time day or night. Okay?”
“That you like him.”
Let me know how you are feeling about this so far!! I love hearing from you guys!
Aries nodded and off they went. After a few minutes, they found the room in the space behind Slytherin’s stone head where Sally had come from. They entered a cozy looking room. It looked like a library, but with better furniture. Aries set off to look at the rows upon rows of books. Draco looked at the potion ingredients. I did have to ask Aries one question.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco!” He yelled
Snape smiled back, took the spoon and said, “Scoot over.” With that Snape dug into Harry’s chocolate ice cream.
Draco nodded. “Of course, Harry. Now, I am exhausted. I would be surprised if you aren’t. Let’s go to sleep.”
“Hello, Petunia. Where is that infuriating boy?”
Aries chuckled back and kissed Draco on his forehead.
“He didn’t suspect a thing. He even bad mouthed me to me. It was kind of funny. I am tired though, so I am going to bed. Good night, Mother. Father, you as well.”
“Mister Snape.”
Poppy came in and checked Harry over. He had apparently only been out for an hour, but was full of potions than made him feel better.
Hermione and Draco stare at each other and look to have some silent conversation. They both shrug, nod, and Hermione goes to her trunk to pull out a parchment. She starts writing with Draco looking over her shoulder.
“I am fine. It isn’t labor. My water would have broken by now.” Just as if it was meant to be, as Harry finished saying that, he felt a wetness spread across his crotch. “Ok, yup. I’m in labor. Go tell Draco. Meet me at the hospital wing.”
“Um, truth, I guess.” He was always quiet, even now with no one around.
“Yes! Is it a boy or girl? Is it- Wait, that was plural. Genders?”
“Hold on.” Snape said as he ran from the room. He was back after just a minute. He walked to his husband and pulled a couple hairs from his head.
When they finally pulled away, Harry laid his head on Draco’s chest.
“Okay, I am choosing to believe you, but you had better believe I will be speaking to Sev about this.”
“It’s okay, Harry. If you are happy, so are we. Right, Ron?” Ron nodded but stayed silent.  “Alright, what is the other thing?” She asked. So Harry told them about being taken, how he got out, and the cover story they made for Draco. When he got to the part about Lily he paused unsure of how to say it.
“Well, I grew up with an Uncle, or rather a person I thought was my Uncle. He was a paranoid sort of person. I was never sent to school. He taught me at home, so I do know how to use magic. He never told me anything about my parents. About a week ago, I got curious and went looking in the attic for clues. I found an old journal of his saying he had stolen me from ‘monsters’ and went one to say who they were. I tracked down where my mother lived and ran away from my Uncle. He didn’t believe me at first but I showed him my birthmark on my knee. He apperated us here and showed my father. They ran a test that showed I was their son.” Aries responded.
“Draco, did you kiss me? Was this a memory or something I made up to get through the pain?”
“As it happens he is not dead. He was stolen from us. We found him again only a few days ago. We thought it would be good for you two to meet, seeing as you are only two months difference in age. He will be going to Hogwarts this year and it would be good for him to know someone in his year.”
“Very well, Harry. However if you hear of anything, you come straight to me. Do you understand?”
“Okay, Harry, you were kidnapped approximately six months ago. The Dark Lord had a spy in the school who saw an opportunity to gain level with Him. He has yet to be caught or revealed. I on the other hand revealed myself as a spy to free you. We will find a way to restore your speech. There seems to be no physical reason. Maybe a spell, maybe not. I promise we will find it.”
“It sounds like some kind of spell. You must have undone it without even realizing it. You started screaming last night in your sleep, so I don’t know. Maybe we should go talk to your father about this. Merlin, I never thought I’d hear your voice again.” Draco said, still smiling.
Tom stood and tried to speak calmly and softly. “Harry, this is going to be really difficult to explain. Just let me explain your first questions, then any and all resulting questions. Lucius is here because this is his Manor. I am your Father. We have met but I didn’t know who you were. I am Tom Riddle. I-”
Snape couldn’t believe it. He had always been told Harry was a spoiled child. Had everything he could ask for. The diagnostics test they had run only looked for major injuries, not sickness and minor injuries. Merlin knows what those tests would come up with.
He had invited the Weasley’s excluding Ron, but they never showed. It broke Harry a little inside. He understood though. After Ginny was Kissed, their relationship was kind of strained.
Everyone sat and the sorting started.
Snape saw the ice cream they each had and said, “Nightmare?”
Harry let out a small laugh. “No, her name is going to be Lily.”
To say Harry was terrified would be an understatement. He had studied every male pregnancy book the library had. When he goes into labour it would progress like a normal pregnancy. Contractions, his water breaking, and so on. What doesn’t happen, however, is pushing. The baby has nowhere to go. He would have to get a c-section. If it didn’t happen in time, Lily would die.
Aries was still hidden behind his book, smirked a little and decided to play with Draco a bit. He looked up at both of the newcomers and immediately looked back down.
"Hey, Sev. What’s going on?” Velvet voice asked.
“Since when?” Blaise spoke up.
Draco’s mouth fell open in shock. Aries lost it. His laughter bubbled up and out.
“Fine. However, you are responsible for him when he wakes.”
They got to the dungeon before Hermione knew where they were going.
He suddenly had his arms full of sobbing little girl.
Harry laughed. “Draco, I am not dying. I am going to have this for a while. After about seven more months I am going to need a lot of help.”
The group headed to the Leaky and were escorted to a private room. There they waited.
His thoughts were soon interrupted by the door opening. A man stepped inside. He looked completely normal except for the dark, blood red eyes.
“I think Lily just moved the wrong way. It has been happening all day.”
“Father, this is Dani. Dani Dursley.”
Draco told him every detail of the meeting. Snape was not happy.
“Okay, what just happened?” Harry asked.
“Ugh, fine.” Draco groaned. He had been so close.
“I am fine. I got a shield up in time. Don’t worry. He did get fifty points taken though and I got twenty.” Aries chuckled.
The other three left the room to give them some privacy. After a few minutes Draco laid down next to Harry. Harry soon drifted off in Draco’s arms.
“No, I’m fine with tea.”
“Harry, while I may not like it, you are still her dad. I am here for you. Whatever you need. I just hope she gets your nose.” She finished with a straight face. Harry paused. Then Hermione, Draco, and Harry all busted out laughing.
“Your job from this point is to continue with what you are doing. When the time comes, bring him to me, if you are able. If not, you are to bring me the child. At whatever the cost. Is that clear? My spy will be made aware of the new plan.”
Congrats to SgCuRiAdPePrER for figuring out the spy!! Only a few chapters left. Love the review you guys leave. You are the best!
“Right now. Aries come here please.”
“Duddy, who is it?” A woman asked from another room.
Snape simply nodded.
Aries raised one hand and waved it. A brush of magic swept over them, ridding them of both of their clothes.
“No doubt Dumbledick had something to do with it. Every time I tried to tell him about the abuse, he would either ignore me or act like I was overreacting. That is why I was going to write to you. I wanted you to know I want nothing to do with him. A ceasefire if you will. My friends all just dumped me because my fame wasn’t worth anything to them anymore. Why is it I look so much like James then?”
“What, Miss Granger?” Snape asked with a groan.
“Well, I think what happened was due to the...trauma you suffered, your brain simply wouldn’t allow you to speak. When you wanted to speak badly enough, it let you.” Snape replied.
They played for the next couple of hours. Draco had taken pity on Harry after winning five games and let him win once. If asked he would of course deny it.
“Upstairs.” She said so low Snape almost didn’t hear it. Snape saw the look on each of their faces and understood. He ran up the stairs to the room that was obviously where the blood had come from. It had a bright red handprint in the center and several locks littering the side.
Instead of answering, Aries just gave him his timetable.
“Well there was only slight torture of muggles, but they signed and now I am Dani’s temporary guardian. At least until she decides differently. I did make her father shit himself.” Snape chuckled.
“What the bloody hell is going on?” Harry asked.
Harry looked at his mother and nodded. “Do it.”
“What seems to be the problem, Minnie?” Snape asked in a calm voice.
*************
YEAR 4: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS AND HANDS), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“Ten points to Slytherin. Now, all of you are to start. If you have any problems, please get my attention.”
“What is going on here? Where is everyone?” Aries asked.
“Alright, maybe you should tell me what happened.” Snape said as he waved his wand bringing over the kettle.
“Harry, that is a child of Tom. You have to get rid of it.” Dumbledore replied.
Harry nodded, “yes, Professor. Her name is Lily.”
He had just sat down with a good book and glass of fire whiskey in hand. He wore flannel pajama bottoms and a black tee-shirt. His hair was tied back in a very elegant way.
“Hey, Harry. Draco asked me to come get you for the party.” Hermione said.
With that Jane led the girls out to the common room. Harry approached the little blonde girl he had grown up with.
Harry just shrugged. Harry was all for house pride, but agreed that there was too much red.
He saw a screen and went to the other side. Harry was laying there. A large bruise decorated the side of his face. Draco went to the side of his bed, kneeled down and grabbed Harry’s hand.
“I- I don’t know. I was just thinking how I wished I could explain how I felt about Tadpole, and I didn’t know what to do. Then it just came out.” Harry’s eyes were wide against his tear stained face.
“Draco, stop. I know. I know you would do everything you could for me. Do you remember how I told you every night I get a new memory from my time there?” Draco nodded. His worry sky rocketed. “Well last night, it was actually a good one. I don’t remember Tom leaving or being there, but I remember you coming in. You sat down next to me after healing me. I started to cry. You just held my hand and told me it would be ok. Then you hugged me, promised to get me out.”
“Oh, you are going down, Potter.” Draco said with an eyebrow raised.
Harry’s mind is zooming.
Aries made it back with seconds to spare.
“You have no idea.” Aries pushed his lips against Draco’s, causing another moan. Aries seized the opportunity to push his tongue into the mouth held against his. He lowered his body onto Draco’s and felt a hardness against his own.
“How many did we lose?”
I love the comments you are leaving. They always make my day!!!
With that he turned and swept out of the room, robe flapping behind him.
“Hey Draco. We have been looking for you everywhere.”
He spun the bottle and the game continued.  It lasted about another hour before everyone got tired and headed to bed.
“Good day.” Snape said. He grabbed the papers and apperated straight to Gringotts. After filing the papers, he was granted custody of the first year Gryffindor.
He opened it and saw several girls surrounding one.
Please review. I need to know if you guys are actually liking this.  <3
He held the boy bridal style and walked to the front door. As he approached, the door opened.
Hermione nodded and ran. They start to the hospital wing when Harry has to stop for another contraction. He leaned against the body, but didn’t notice the hand go to the necklace.
“I love you so much. Now I am going to show you.” Draco said.
Harry opened his mouth to respond but no sounds emerged.
Harry started to cry when talking about the rapes his uncle had inflicted upon him. That was when Snape knew Harry was not lying. He knew Harry hated the attention he received from his fame, so he would never make this up to get attention.
“Are you coming or what?” The voice echoed. Smart ass comment it was. Draco groaned, but jumped anyway.
“How old are you?”
“Me too, Harry. You seem to be lacking Nargles. Ron is infested.” Luna said in a sweet voice.
YEAR 14: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS),ANAL TEARING(RAPE, MULTIPLE), MINOR BURNS(DRAGON), CLOSE DROWNING, SEVERE LACERATION(LEFT FOREARM), CRUCIATUS CURSE, MAGICAL EXHAUSTION, BRUISED ESOPHAGUS, MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
He took off in the direction of the Hospital wing. Praying Harry and Lily were both ok and Lily was still in the man.
“Language, Draco, but I agree.” Snape ran a hand through his hair. “I have a class then I will be back with Dani. She is worried.” He stood and walked out.
“Yes.”
Tears poured out of his eyes. His whole body shuddered. He wrapped his arms around his larger than normal stomach, sobbing silently. He sat there crying silently when warm arms went around him. He could smell the trademark oranges that Draco always smelled of. He sobbed wishing as hard as he could that he could talk. That he could tell Draco how he felt about the baby.
Just as Hermione ran into the room out of breath with that look on her face, Draco’s arm burned. His heart fell.
“Great! Another snake Malfoy is dragging down with him. Just wait until you meet my best mate. He is going to chew you up and spit you out.”
He had asked Harry why he didn’t go to Dumbledore. Harry had. Dumbledore turned him away telling him he was being dramatic and that he should be grateful. That was when he knew he had to go to Snape if he wanted help.
They made their way to the castle. At the entrance, Aries was stopped by Professor McGonagall.
He covered his fingers and licked a broad stripe up Harry’s cock causing Harry to moan.  He probes Harry’s hole lightly. He takes Harry into his mouth and pushes in one finger.
Harry had figured out what Tom wanted and he couldn’t let it happen. When He and Draco had sex, it wasn’t planned. Harry just had the thought of what if.
Watery blue eyes looked up. “Harry?”
Vincent spun and landed on Pansy.
Draco, Harry, and Lily welcomed two baby’s into their lives a few months later.
Registering Aries for school had been easy. They simply told Dumbledore that Aries was a cousin who was recently orphaned and Snape had been his godfather. Dumbledore didn’t seem suspicious, but you can never tell with him. Aries had been registered under the name of Snape since they didn’t want to give away anything too soon.
“Of course I will marry you. Nothing would make me happier.” He said softly.
“That is exactly what I was hoping to hear. You have gone above and beyond, young Draco. I only meant for you to protect the child while it was here. Given that is no longer the situation, you took it upon yourself to continue my orders beyond necessary. I do believe that is the best thing you could have done. Then, beyond that you still have managed a bond with that traitor. Oh, with you, as well as my spy, things are going even better than I had planned. Tell me, how is my child?”
“You move fast, don’t you?” Draco asked.
“Calm down you oversized chicken!” Snape yelled.
Aries looked back up then looked back down.
“What? Did something happen? Harry, are you okay?” Snape was immediately worried.
Tears formed in Draco’s eyes. “How much do you remember?”
Sorry about how long it has taken me to get this chapter to you, but I am finally back into the swing of work after COVID. I hope you guys liked this one.
“I have been feeling off, so I went to St. Mungo’s. I have a slight condition.”
Chapter 17
“Oh Merlin. Ok. I am just going to say it. Harry I am completely head over boots in love with you. When we talked in the infirmary and I told you that you weren’t alone, I meant that. I want to consider Lily as my child. I don’t want to be Uncle Draco. I want to be Father or Dad or Papa or whatever she wants to call me. I want to be with you. I want to be with you in every way that matters. I want to wake up in five years with Lily jumping on the bed yelling at her dads to get up. I want everything that you can give.” Draco finished and looked at Harry.
Severus Snape was many things, but he never thought he would be a father. When Harry came to him three years ago on the last day of his fourth year begging for Snape’s help he couldn’t do anything but hear the child out.
His previously curly hair had straightened and turned an even darker shade of black. His eyes were now dark brown. His entire face shape had changed including his nose. It was longer but not unflatteringly so. His freckles disappeared. The biggest difference however, was the lack of scar. Harry Potter was gone and in his place was Aries Tom Riddle.
“Ow! What are you doing?” Tom asked.
“Of course I am, darling. I would voice my opinion if it was otherwise. You both make each other better.”
I have no excuses.... Sorry it is so short, but at least it is here...Finally...
“Harry James Potter. I know we haven’t been together long, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want every moment from now until death to be us. Not just you. Not just me. I love Lily as if she were my own and consider myself her dad already. Will you do me the biggest honor and marry me?”
Draco groaned. “Merlin, Granger. I didn’t need an image of the Weasel’s arse in my mind. I might be bent, but that is too far.”
Aries walked up the stone stairs to the headmaster’s office and said the password. He didn’t even bother knocking, he just opened the door and walked in.
They both laughed. Harry looked up at Draco and said the words Draco had been dying to hear again. “Who needs a knight in shining armour when I have a silver dragon to protect me. I love our tadpole and I love you, my silver dragon.”
Harry cut her off. “Don’t bother. I knew I was going to lose him because of this. I just hoped I was wrong. Draco, can we go back home now? I want to lay down. I’m tired.”
Draco nodded and said, “are you okay?”
“Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something. Father.” Harry’s voice never wavered. At hearing his title his face softened.
Back at Hogwarts Harry and Draco went back to the Gryffindor common room after dinner with Dani in tow. About halfway there, Draco hissed and grabbed his arm. Harry looked worried.
Snape grabbed the man in an embrace and gave him a quick kiss.
Epilogue
Draco motioned for everyone to sit at the table.
“Where is Lily?” He asked.
“I mean yeah. If Snape hadn’t shown up and I still made it, I was going to owl you anyway. This just saves time. That and if I am your kid you aren’t going to kill me right now.”
By the time they arrive at the dungeons Aries is completely lost. Good thing he still had the Marauder’s Map. They all enter and stay in the common room waiting for Snape to come and greet the first years. It honestly didn’t take that long before a snap of his black cape caught their attention.
I love all to positivity that is coming through the comments and Kudos!!
Suddenly Ron pushed back from the table. “You lot are insane. I am not getting anywhere near the spawn of that freak, and I’m not talking about You-Know-Who. Stay away from me. You are disgusting!” With that Ron ran from the room. The three remaining just sat in shock.
“Well, Harry?” Fumbles asked after a moment.
“It would be an honour my Lord.” Ginny bowed.
They walked into the great hall and met the first years. Slowly, one by one, they were sorted. Finally it was Aries' turn.
He cracked his eyes open and took in the sight before him. He was surrounded by black stone walls on four sides, ceiling, and floor. His arms were chained over his head to the wall. His shoulder was obviously dislocated out of the socket. He was further exploring when he noticed his stomach, it was slightly bigger than he remembered. He was already very skinny due to his family’s abuse and starvation. You could see every broken and bruised rib.
Snape told them of what happened at the Dursleys the day before and that he now had temporary custody of Dani until she no longer wanted that. She looked at him with tears in her perfect blue eyes.
Everyone looked at Harry. He sat frozen. With tears in his eyes, he reached forward and grabbed one of Draco’s hands.
“Hello, Dani. You can call me Narcissa. You have the most beautiful blue eyes.”
A little rewind to Draco's meeting.
A smirk appeared on Aries’ face. Time to begin.
“Please call me Narcissa, Harry.”
“Hey, ‘Mione. How did it go?” Harry asked.
“Oh, Harry. Please for all that is good and holy please tell me you aren’t joking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry,
“Dismissed.”
“We can talk about it tomorrow. Snape needs to talk to you and Dani, as well. I finally convinced him to leave and go to bed. He got back right as Hermione brought you in. He has been a mess. Really though, Potter? I leave you alone for a few hours and you almost get yourself killed. What am I going to do with you?”
“Severus, who could this possibly be to get this kind of reaction out of you? The only child I have ever seen you care for is your godson.” Lucius said from the doorway.
“I can’t feel her. I can’t, she isn’t moving. Mione, I can’t lose her. I-” The blackness Harry had grown accustomed to took over.
“To be fair, yes. However, everything after fourth year was fake. You know about my childhood and how anything could have been better. Father is anything I could want in a parent. He only hated me because of James. Well now he IS my father so it would be a little hypocritical to hate me because of my father now.” Harry laughed.
“Now, I know why I couldn’t hug you before you told me. You are huge.” She said out loud this time letting go of him.
“I’m sure he is making it up for attention. Now if you don’t mind, I was reading.”
“Yeah. It just hurt more than I thought it would. Mione, I love you. Sorry about this. I know you have feelings for him, so if you want him, you can go. I didn't want you to have to pick.”
Aries opened the door and saw a beautiful sight.
“Why would you-. You know what? Off topic. Back to your questions. Almost sixteen years ago Sev and I had a son. We had just gotten married when we found out he was pregnant. He was so beautiful. Raven black hair, dark brown eyes, and a birthmark in the shape of a ram on his right knee. That is why we named him Aries.” Harry’s eyes widened at the last one. “At just two months old he was taken from us. I awoke one night and went to check on him. He had usually awoke by that point to get fed and he hadn’t. I entered the room and saw him. I immediately knew something was wrong. He wasn’t moving, breathing. He was blue. And cold. I knew I was too late. Muggles had a term for it. SIDS. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. A blanket term for babies who die with no cause. We never had another child. We couldn’t go through that again.” His tears had come back. Harry just sat there silently.
She was cut off by a loud scream. She froze knowing exactly what it was. By the time she turned around, Draco was already next to Harry across the room. She couldn’t hear what Draco was whispering, but Harry had latched on to Draco’s shirt.
“Potter really killed this thing? How? He was twelve years old!” Draco was in disbelief.
“When are you going to tell Harry?”
“That is what I like to hear, my boy. Now, my spy within the walls of the school has told me you are protecting my slave. That you have grown close to him and he trusts you. That you may be involved with him. Is this true? Remember, I like honesty.”
“I will be there, but don’t wait up. We can talk in the morning.” With that he departed.
He closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the pillow. Harry had never given thoughts to a family. He expected to die when he faces Tom. He immediately knew what to do. He had never had a family to love him, but now he would. He finally had something to live for. He planned to die while trying to kill the now father of his child. Now he had the perfect weapon. Tom wouldn’t fight Harry while he was pregnant with his only heir. He could face Tom before he gave birth and the man would not try to kill him. He knew why Tom had chosen him. He was Harry Potter. One of the most powerful wizards in the world.
“I am going to have a granddaughter named Tadpole?”
Everyone had gone silent. Harry looked around the room with fire in his eyes and said “That means everyone.”
“All right students! If you will all be seated we can commence with the sorting and feast!” Dumbledore’s voice rose above the rest.
“Miss Granger, it is illegal for a teacher to force you to take it. However, I am not going to force you. This is strictly a voluntary activity. You will fail if you do not though. It is up to you. Now gather your ingredients and get started.” Hermione gaped at the man.
“I believe it was your brain trying to process the situation. It deemed you unsafe to talk until you were safe again.”
Draco Malfoy turned around at the words with terror coating his tear-streaked face. Harry, ignoring the words, took five steps to Draco with no emotion on his face.
Sorry this took so long.  Writers block is real!! Thank you so much for the Kudos and Comments!!
“I’ll go dare.” She smirked.
“I want to stay with you and Harry. I lost him once. I can’t lose him again. I do have one question. I know Harry calls you Father, but can I not?”
“Love, you can call me whatever you want. Within reason. You can just call me Severus if you wish. Whatever you are comfortable with. Just make sure it is Professor Snape in lessons. I don’t need students thinking I’m going soft or playing favorites.”
“I thought Father was terrible though? Crucios everyone? Torture?”
They walked around the curtain set to so Harry, Snape, and Dani.
Hermione
They wrapped their arms around each other. Aries’ head on Draco’s chest. He was lulled to sleep by the sound of his boyfriend’s heart beat.
I AM GOING TO KEEP IT. HE MIGHT HAVE MADE IT, BUT IT IS MY BABY. NOT HIS.
“Unfortunately, there isn’t much I can do. According to the rules in place his punishment will have to be minor. He-”
“Yeah, he doesn’t know where I am. I do think he is getting suspicious. He has questioned Mom several times. It is only a matter of time before he questions me.”
“Let’s us continue.” He droned.
“Oh, um, I think you got too many truths out of me in potions a few weeks ago, so dare.”
“Yes. More sure than I have been about a lot of things.” He said with a sigh.
“Dray, if it comes down to it, save Lily.”
“Aries, we don’t hardly know anything about you and you, us. I propose we all play a game of truth or dare.” She looked around the group who all eventually agreed.
“That is insane. I am glad you found them. I hated to see Sev hurting that much. So, Hogwarts? What house do you think you will be in?”
Draco was already having a restless night, but when Harry started screaming, he was on his feet in an instant. He shot over to Harry to see he was still asleep. He picked Harry up and placed him in his lap. Rocking back and forth, he whispered in his ear, “It’s okay Harry, you’re okay.”
“Harry, you are talking. How did you fix it?” Draco wondered.
HARRY JAMES POTTER
“Aries? What the hell?” Draco asked at the blatant disrespect Aries was showing.
Aries ran his tongue along the underside of his dickhead then down the shaft to his balls. He tongued his nuts only for a moment, then ran his tongue back up the shaft. Aries looked up at him and grinned, then took his dick into his mouth and began sucking him.
“Oh, it’s you. What does that brat want?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“My Lord, if-if you don’t mind me asking, who is the spy? I may need help getting Harry or the child out of Hogwarts. It would be helpful to know who I am looking for.”
Harry led Dani over to his friends. “Dani, this is Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, and Draco Malfoy. If you ever need something, these are the people to ask. Guys, this is my cousin Danica, but she likes Dani.”
Harry opened his mouth and simply said, “Ok.”
“Push past me. If you want to help her, push past me and threaten them. I love Dani. I can’t see her hurt.” Dudley whispered.
“It is mostly true, my Lord. I am close with Harry, but not protecting him or involved with him. I am protecting the child you sired. Harry thinks I had helped Snape in his escape. Harry remembers very little of his time here so it was not difficult. Since I was the only one allowed in the room with him other than you, Snape bought it as well. Your original orders were to protect the child. I am only following your orders. As for being involved with him, he has feelings for me. I, however, do not return those and never will.” Draco did his best to keep his voice steady.
YEAR 2: MALNUTRITION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“Move, Dragon.”
“Oh, well. Anyway are you going to introduce us?” Blaise said pointing to Aries.
“Harry! How are you feeling? Do you need anything? I am going to get Pomfrey.”
“He took that better than I thought he would.” Aries said in between laughs.
**********
“Well, I am here if you want to talk. Now, however, It is one minute until eleven and I don't want to give Mother a reason to ground me just yet. Good night, Draco.”
Harry James Potter
“Good night, Draco.”
“Draco, it is very obvious. Not to him, but to everyone else. He likes you too. He just doesn’t think you like him. He is afraid that because of Lily you or anyone else won’t want to be with him. While I am not sure how I feel about you yet, I can tell he likes you. I have been practically his sister since we were eleven and he saved my life.”
“Harry?” Draco broke the silence.
Aries smiled. “Alright, good to know. My favorite colour is silver. I love sweets as well. Chocolate Frogs are probably my favorite. I have a minor obsession with gardening. I am gay. That is just about it for me.”
He used all the pain he had ever felt. His parent’s death. The Dursleys. Sirius. Every detail he remembered from when Lily was created.
“Potter is not my son. My son died. It is just a coincidence.” Tom said in a low voice.
“UM, ok. Narcissa. No offence, but how did you even know I was here?”
Tom sighed and put his face in his hands. “I just got him back. I don’t want to let him go for eight months.”
He sighed and looked at the bird.
“I love you, Dragon.”
“I have to talk to you both if you don’t mind.” Snape said.
Aries nodded and Snape stood. “I shall be back. Don’t go until your father okayes it. He is on the warpath today.”
Thank you so much for the Ideas and reviews!! Loving the love!
“Draco? Dray? Oh Merlin. I broke him.” Harry got his wand and pointed it at Draco’s face. He cast a spell and water shoots out hitting the mark.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dragon, you haven’t stopped talking about this boy since you first met him in Madam Malkins. My Dragon, you may breathe fire, but you have a heart of gold. It was clear in all the letters you sent when you talked about him.”
“Of course you can’t see Harry. You will just take him to the Dark Lord.”
“Ah, young Malfoy. It seems my slave is in labor. You shall go tend to it and get me my heir. Miss Weasley. You have done remarkably. You shall be rewarded. You get the privilege to raise my heir alongside me. A sort of mother if you will. Stay with me until Mr. Malfoy brings her.” A hissing voice said calmly.
Graphic depictions of rape.
Draco nodded and Snape opened the door and allowed both inside.
Harry was sitting in his room while everyone was finishing up decorating for the party. He was excited to see everyone who was coming in for it. Narcissa wouldn’t be able to come because of the spy, but she said she would make up for it. Just as he finished another male pregnancy book, Lily made a move and directly kicked his bladder.
“It isn’t, but it is on the third floor. I may take you some time to get there. Plus, you need to be there when everyone arrives.”
“Is she ok? I miss her. How-”
See beginning of chapter one for notes.
When Draco was satisfied, they went back to the common room. Draco agreed that the less people knew of Aries’ identity, the better.
“Of course she is perfect. The only thing that could make her more perfect would be if Tom didn’t father her. Can I hold her now? I haven’t even seen her.” Harry asked in a small voice.
“I dare you to go knock on Snape’s door and tell him you fancy him.” Vincent said.
“What happened? Where is Harry?”
“No! Drop your wands! Do not hurt my heir!” Tom yelled.
Ginny left out of the big door and Draco turned to Harry. “I don’t trust her. Why is she just now approaching you? I don’t like her.”
“What is the meaning of this Young Malfoy?” Tom hissed.
Chapter 13
“Thank you for your generosity, my Lord.” Draco stood and bowed. Making a quick exit, he apperated back to Hogwarts. Going directly to Harry’s room as it was just after midnight. He knew Harry would still be awake even though he had told him not to be.
The days flew by until the morning of September first. They didn't want to risk putting Harry on the train, so he would stay at the castle with Draco. Hermione was going to portkey to the train as she was headgirl. She also wanted to talk to Ron to see who and what he had told.
I'm sorry, but I'm not. Please review! I need to know your opinions on this twist.
“What are you thinking about?” Draco asked.
They sat and talked about nothing for a while until Snape returned with a young girl.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, it is completely fine. That is why I stayed, remember? In case you needed anything." He paused. "Tadpole?”
“You can call me whatever you want. Be sure in class it is Professor Snape.”
“Oh Merlin, Harry. What is it?”
“I am fine, just sore. Lily is fine as well. My magic protected her.”
“Aries Snape.” Murmurs went up all around them. He walked up and sat on the stool. The hat was then placed on his head.
WHAT ABOUT THE BLEEDING INTO MY STOMACH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALMOST EVERYTHING?
Finally it's Here!!
Sanguis Ingis-Blood on fire
Aries moaned when he bottomed out.
Loving the reviews!! You guys are amazing!!
“Shepherd's pie, boy.”
“Well, he won’t live long past the birth. A girl? I think I shall call her Arnica. I think a poison shall be fitting. He is due soon, yes?”
“Blaise, Pansy, this is Aries Snape. Aries, this is Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson.”
Just as the door shut Draco flopped back onto his bed and thought of nothing other than Aries until he fell asleep.
Harry reacts and meets the mastermind behind his rescue.
After the feast, the students started heading to their common rooms. Harry stayed seated next to Draco worrying about being alone.
“Yes, however, Harry did not lose the child and he only had a few broken bones. I will allow you to be in charge of his detentions if you wish, Severus. It will be a three week duration. He will also lose fifty house points”
!” Not expecting it he fell forward unable to stop his fall. He landed directly on his stomach.
Snape glowered. “You mean like how you hurt Harry?”
CAN YOU PLEASE BRING HIM IN? I REMEMBER NOTHING EXCEPT ONE CONVERSATION WITH TOM RIGHT BEFORE I WAS SAVED. WHO IS IT?
Lucius conjured a mirror and showed him.
They reached the top of the stairs when another contraction hit. Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and covered his mouth to stop the screaming.
He was stopped when Draco’s lips connected with his. The air got thinner.
“Ron, you may not like me or my decisions, but I am still a student here. I deserve to be here just like you.” Harry replied calmly.
She looked at his stomach, then back at his face. “Ok. as long as you are happy. Where are we going?” She held his hand as they made their way to the common room.
“Good night Aries.” Draco said with a blush.
Aries laid awake for a while when he heard it.
After everything that happened at the Ministry, we can no longer be around you. We are sorry you lost Sirius, but if you had just listened to me about rushing , it wouldn’t have happened. A lot wouldn’t have happened. No one would have been hurt. Luna would still be able to walk. Ginny wouldn’t have broken her wand arm. Ron wouldn’t have had a concussion so bad he stutters now. You would still have us. As I said a lot wouldn’t have happened. Neville and I are the only ones who didn’t get physical injuries. Just mental ones. I haven’t been able to sleep without nightmares.
“What about us?” Aries asked.
With that they all headed to their first class of the day.
About ten minutes later there was a knock at the door. Snape opened it and stuck out his wand. Draco was behind him and asked, “What does Weasley call me and why?”
“Your father just said he was married, so who is your mother?”
They all took their seats. Pansy asked about Aries and he told them the story he told Draco. He also told them about what they told Dumbledore.
The three froze and looked up. There stood a tired looking Snape in pajamas.
“Draco! Sit down and shut up! I can handle this. She did not hurt me. It was her brother. We are going to at least hear her out.” Harry interrupted and motioned for Ginny to talk.
“I would like to go home at some point.” Snape said impatiently. Just then a loud thud followed several more that drew his attention.
The comments you leave make  my day so much better!
Harry woke with a startled gasp, tears streaming down his face.
Chapter 6
“I can stay with Harry?” Snape smiled and nodded. “Ok. I don’t want to go back. Does this mean I call you Father, too?” Her little blue eyes sparkled.
“Nothing. Everything. Our wedding mainly.” Harry sighed in reply.
Draco now had his full attention. “Come on, do you really think I am that stupid? First of all, the way you acted with Granger and the Weasel. Second, You may be in Slytherin now, but you are still a Gryffindor. Third, your face may have changed, but your voice is exactly the same. And lastly, I have had a crush on Harry Potter since I met him in the robe shop. Do you really think I wouldn’t catch on? One thing I don’t get is how you conned your way into making my godfather believe you are Aries. How and why?” Draco crossed his arms across his chest and leaned against a desk that was close by.
They set to work on their potion with an almost practiced ease and partnership. They were the first done and had to wait for everyone to finish.
“Oh, Harry! It is so good to hear your voice. What happened? How did you figure it out?” Snape released Harry and looked at Draco who still had not stopped smiling.
They went to the Hospital wing together not knowing the extent of Harry’s damaged body. Snape still remembers every word of the medical report and the tears in Poppy’s eyes when she looked at Harry. She handed the report over to Snape after checking with Harry to make sure it was okay to do so.
“Lumos.” He looked around and saw a small lump in the middle of the floor. He was about to turn and leave when the lump groaned. The tall man leaned down and saw the boy.
He used his wand to cut a long line across Harry’s stomach. Blood ran down the large bump. Harry could still feel it but it was very diluted. More like a pushing against him.
“Well, it’s Luna.” She said softly.
“I will help you. You know I will. Just tell me what is wrong.”
Aries stood. “Aries. I have heard stories about you. Makes me think you don’t really know or care what you are talking about. Please go elsewhere to continue your search for the Golden boy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The first thing he noticed was the coppery smell of blood permenting the dark room.
“Mr. Snape, you are to come with me to sort you into a house. Follow me. You are to be sorted after the first years.”
“Snape is my mother.”
“It’s a birthmark. So?” Snape asked.
Chapter 11
Hope you like the OC I threw in. She is going to become a big part of the story I didn't plan for.
“I am guessing there is some kind of preservation charm on the chamber or some such. It should be decayed, yet it looks like it died minutes ago. I’m sorry you died, Sally.” Aries said as he put his hand on the snake's face between the eyes.
“Is that why you were in my bed this morning? I know I had nightmares, I didn’t mean to wake up. I’m sorry.” Harry put his head in his hands.
Snape walked into the room. “Draco, I wanted to introduce you to someone. As you know my son died just two months after he was born.”
“You’re here about Dani, aren’t you?” The large boy asked.
“Wait. You think I regret it? Harry, The only part of that I regret is not being able to tell you. To look at you everyday and see the person I fell in love with not remember. That you had to be taken and have what happened to, to be able to realize how much you meant to me. I hate that that had to happen for me to open my eyes and get over myself in order to help you. I hate that-”
“All I can tell you is, I did everything I could. Severus told me about the baby, do you know what you are going to do about it?” Draco asked trying to keep the emotion out of his voice.
“Alright, Vinny, truth or dare?” Blaise asked.
He shut the door and Pansy ran back to the circle who were all dying with laughter.
Draco helped Harry to his feet.
“We are both just fine. Lily was a little distressed for a while, but is completely fine.”
“You don’t know that he won’t care, he might-.” His eyes flick over to the sudden movement of the door opening. “Harry, you should not be out of bed.”
“Well, someone is excited.” Draco moaned out.
He pulled at the chains around his wrist. Already bloody and raw from prolonged exposure to the chains. After an hour of no progress he dropped his hands. He felt hopelessness seep in. One thought kept pulling at the back of his brain.
Harry told him everything. The cupboard, the starvation, the forced labor, the abuse, and the rapes. Snape had a hard time believing him at first and thought it was all a Gryffindor prank. Who would seriously lock a child in a broom cupboard? However, Harry would never have told him about the abuse and rapes if he didn’t desperately need help.
Harry was unable to apparate due to Lily, so they all portkeyed to the Leaky Cauldron. Even though Harry’s bump was hidden by thick cloaks and glamours, he still felt like everyone could see it.
“Tell him what exactly?”
Loving all of your comments!! Please continue to review. It lets me know in which way you want the story to go!
“It seems you failed, Slave. You-” Tom froze then screamed until his entire body turned to dust where he stood.
The bird stopped and handed him the crumpled paper in its mouth.
“Harry, I am so sorry. I know you don’t trust me or-” Draco was cut off when Harry wrapped his arms around the trembling frame. The blond man started sobbing into Harry’s chest, returning the hug.
“I ran a spell diagnostic over after I found out. I hadn’t before because a muggle caused the injuries. I didn’t need to. I showed a very powerful glamour. I can either leave it on or remove it. I didn’t want to until you told me to.” Snape said.
“Good. Now you need to rest, so go to sleep. I’ll still be here when you wake up.” Draco replied.
“Well, I shall leave you two. Aries please be kind. I expect you back in your room not later than eleven.” Snape said.
Narcissa stood directly behind her and said, “well, I shall go contact the Aurors.” She walked to the floo, threw powder in and called out. Aurors filed in and took Ginny away to await trial.
“No. You don’t get to get away without an explanation.” She stated.
“Wow. That is- wow? You are right, I wouldn’t believe that. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to believe that you were doing this to spy or something. Yes, I have had a crush on you since first year. It almost broke my heart to give up on the idea of you to pursue feelings for you. Well give up Harry for Aries. Wait, Dumbledore said Harry is in hiding.”
“How did you handle that when you found out?” Blaise asked.
Harry continued. “This is Lily. She is five months along right now. I know how this looks. I am carrying Tom’s child, but I’m not. Lily is mine. Sure I wouldn’t have picked to have a kid right now, but I can’t lose her. She is the only good thing that came out of that place. I have to find the silver lining and she’s it. I understand if you want nothing to do with me, but I would like Lily to know you guys.” By the time he finished, he was shaking.
“We are having a boy. And a girl.”
Snape had gone back to the Dursley’s a few days after Aries had returned. He grabbed all of his son’s things and obliviated the muggles. He made them forget Snape had ever been there and that Harry Potter had just run away.
15 MONTHS: HIT BY KILLING CURSE (FAILED), HYPOTHERMIA, ABANDONMENT
*************
He groaned deeply and his knees seemed to buckle slightly as he grasped a handful of his hair and guided Aries’ head up and down his hard shaft.
Draco pulls out his fingers and Harry whimpers at the empty feeling. He coats his own dick in the lube, knowing how sensitive Harry is. Tom Riddle had done a number on him. It had taken them almost a year to work up to having sex and several failed attepts to find what worked with Harry’s injured system.
Hermione was the first to recover. “Harry, are you sure about this? He has been terrible to you from the moment you walked into his class first year.”
“Promise” Harry rose his pinky in the air. Draco raised one eyebrow. Harry rolled his eyes, grabbed Draco’s hand and intertwined their pinkies.
“Ok, well, I fancy you and wanted to know if you felt the same?”
“Do you have your eye on someone?”
They only had a little while longer before the rest of the students arrived. Harry had a ball of nerves sitting like a rock in his stomach. Not only for the new school year, but for the memory he had last night.
“He-well-he-he is-”
I would like to say I am sorry to write this, but I’m not. I believe it has been a long time coming.
” The hat asked.
“No, I mean I want to call you Daddy. Father is too formal and I don’t like it. My biological father didn’t let me call him that anymore. You wouldn’t be replacing then, just taking over. If we are going to do this, we are going to do it right. Harry is my brother and you are my Daddy.” She said with a smile.
“So, we had dinner before Pomfrey let you leave, now we have free time before bed. What do you want to do?” Draco had taken to becoming Harry’s personal distraction.
“Yes, Neville?” Harry replied.
“What? What is wrong? Is she ok? Please someone talk to me!” Harry was in tears.
“Well sir, I have to ask you something. You see, I have a secret crush on someone and don’t know how to tell them. I was wondering if I could practice with you. I just know you would be honest with me if it isn’t good.” Pansy reasoned.
Most of the next two days were spent in the hospital wing. The day Harry got to leave was one of the best he has had in awhile, or so he was told. The last two days he had spent “talking” to Draco trying to relearn their friendship. What Harry didn’t know was exactly how hard it was for Draco to do this. To start over. To try again. What he couldn’t tell Harry was how in love with him he was. Five months ago if someone had told him he would be in love with Harry Potter, he would have had them checked for hexes.
Snape had pulled him aside a few days ago and told him that Dumblebore was getting suspicious. He had called Snape to his office. Apparently Harry was not in hiding, but missing. Who would have thought? Snape, of course, played it off that he knew nothing about it and had been busy all summer with Aries.
“Since now.” Draco answered. “My turn.”
“What can I do for you, Miss Parkinson?” He asked.
“Yes, my Lord. He is almost at eight months now. After that, for male pregnancy it is a guessing game.”
“Now, Aries. Now!”
Aries lifted his head and tried to keep a straight face. “What you said I wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone else because you want me all to yourself.”
“Okay, my turn.” He spun the bottle and Pansy grabbed it mid spin.
The comments you guys leave are amazing!
Dray quickly pushes in the last finger all while still sucking Harry. He made it a point to miss Harry’s prostate, not wanting him to come until he was inside his husband.
“What are you two of you doing here? Remus and the others said Harry is here. We want to see him. Ready to take him back to You-Know-Who when we leave?” Ron said.
“Sixteen. Same as you.”
“I have taught you well, young padawan. Goodnight son, Lily.” Snape then turned to leave when he heard Harry say, “I should never have let you watch Star Wars.”
“No, Narcissa. You didn’t. I really do appreciate it. It means a lot that you care for Draco that much.”
Finally after another month of planning, Hermione and Draco finalized the baby shower. It was happening in just a few hours. They were worried it would be too late to have as Harry was almost at nine months. For male pregnancy, anywhere after month eight was a due date.
Aries picked up his book and waved his hand. A big gust of wind pushed the redhead onto his arse in the corridor and the compartment door shut and locked.
“Wait. You are having a girl, Harry?” She said in a soft voice.
He crumpled the parchment in his hand and leaned back against the wall. Tears he had been holding back finally escaped.
“My name is Harry Potter. I am not going to hurt her. Plus, carrying this little one would make that hard to do.”
Harry stood up and Draco followed.
Albus sighed but nodded. He then turned and left the hall.
Snape saw it and froze. Lucius who was still in the room got curious and went to look. He looked at the birthmark causing the problems. He froze as well. It was in the shape of a ram. Lucius had only ever seen that birthmark in that place once. Only on, “Aries?”
“I’m not five, don’t treat me like I am. I know Ron Weasley beat you up. That is all anyone can talk about.”
Ginny was covered in dirt and blood. Her eye looked like it had been ripped out. She looked to be missing half of her left arm. Her hair was matted and tangled. She started screaming some more, giving Narcissa the chance to sneak behind her. Ginny was mid sentence when she suddenly froze and fell forward.
“That’s what Tom called her. I didn’t know what he was talking about at the time, but it kinda stuck. I think I’m going to name her Lily. After my mother. Father would like that. He adopted me because he loved her so much. It is one way to pay him back I guess.” Harry said.
They all waved and said Hi.
“Harry, what do you remember?”
Harry can out into the open and said, “we need to talk.”
He takes the order and pulls out until the crown of his dick and slams back in. He sets a fast and heavy pace, knowing they both won’t last long. He hit Harry’s prostate with every thrust, sending Harry into loud moans.  He knows Harry is close when he starts to tense up. Draco reaches down and starts stroking Harry’s cock . He pushes only two more times when Harry yells Draco’s name and comes white ribbons all over his own chest and his husband’s hand. His muscles contract around Draco pulling his orgasm out of him. He empties inside Harry and almost collapses. He catches himself and pulls out.
“Alright, listen because I will not say this more than once. First years, These are the rules. Learn them, live them. First, Do not wander around the castle with any less than three to a group. Slytherins are targets for older students and I don’t want to have to be in the hospital wing more than necessary. Second, don’t get caught. I don’t care what you do, but if you get caught, any punishment you get will be doubled by me. You are supposed to be cunning. Use it. Finally, If you are having any problems, you are to come to a prefect, head of house, or me. My door is always open, however, if I do not answer, I am brewing something that cannot be disrupted or is dangerous. Now all dorm placements are on the board. You are now free to do whatever until curfew. Aries, come with me please.”
“You.” Draco’s face was completely red now.
breath and continued, “and Neville Longbottom.”
“Dray. Inside me. Now.”
“No offense, Mrs.Malfoy-” Harry started.
When Harry woke the next morning he felt someone behind him. He rolled over to see who it was. He looked over Draco’s features wondering how they came to be in the same bed.
Ron was still being a prat, but when wasn’t he. Aries had thought back over their friendship and was surprised he had never noticed before. There had always been signs. The biggest one being after Harry Potter’s name came out of the goblet of fire. Hermione had always gone out of her way to prove she was smarter than everyone else. She tried to be better than everyone. Aries was kicking himself after thinking about his past life.
Chapter 9
(See the end of the chapter for
“Unfortunately, You-Know-Who’s spy within the school reported you had been attacked while Dragon was out yesterday. They had told him all the details they know, which was not a lot. I got free and came immediately. You and Dragon are dating and your Mother is no longer here. I just wished to see you were ok. I know if the roles were reversed, I would only hope Lily would have checked on Dragon. I apologise if I overstepped.”
He neared the large doors and slowed to a stand still. Closing his eyes, he prepared himself for what lay on the other side. He pushed and was greeted by more silence.
“I can’t talk, Draco. You know that. Are you making fun-” Harry’s eyes widened. He looked up at Draco who had a smile stretched across his face.
“Well, you know how my Gryffindor brain works. I saw an opportunity and took it. I can’t stop now though sir. I am in way too deep. If nothing else you have a spy. I think this is the way I can finally finish off the evil bastard.” Aries didn’t say which evil bastard he meant though.
Several groans went up, but they all moved.
Harry sat at the table and replayed the day over in his mind. It was beautiful. It made him think of his own wedding.
Getting a three year old on a sugar high to bed was a challenge. Wedding cake had that effect. Singing had become Lily’s favorite thing to fall asleep to. Harry wasn’t the greatest, but don’t ask Lily. She would stand up for her mum with her entire being. She had definitely inherited her dad’s stubbornness.
“He is calling. He knows. We have to go.”
“Dinner is done, Uncle Vernon.”
Harry got up and headed to the bathroom. They had done cleaning charms on him since he got back because he was too weak to do anything else. Now he was able to shower and he was excited.
“Get lost, Ferret. Take the freak with you.” Ron said. He was standing in front of the group, arms crossed.
Harry gasps and grabs Draco’s hair. Draco hollows out his cheeks making Harry thrust his hips up. He pushes another finger in and starts scissoring them, stretching out the tight ring of muscles.
