Draco headed towards the counter and relaxing back into his armchair’s comfortable cushions, Harry turned to look out of the window and people-watched. He finished Draco’s half-eaten chocolate croissant, brushed a few stray crumbs off his black trousers and reached for the tablet, Draco had propped up against his armchair. A young barista rushed over to take it from him, and he thanked her, then settled back into his seat.
“My precious little prince.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at him, held his gaze, then scoffed.
Draco groaned and whimpered.
“We were running low on milk. I figured since you don’t function well without our morning cappuccino that ensuring your happiness was more important than being stuck in a boring two-hour meeting while the files on my desk continue to pile up until they reach unmanageable proportions.”
“Ron?” he asked.
Draco smiled.
Arthur boldly spun his wife around, and she laughed heartily. Somehow, Fleur had managed to convince her mother-in-law to literally let her hair down, and it whipped through the air as she danced with her husband of forty years. It was their wedding anniversary, and everyone had gathered in the Burrow’s back garden to celebrate the happy occasion.
“You always say that, Weasley,” he drawled, while pretending to inspect his perfectly manicured fingernails, and therefore purposefully leading Ron to believe he didn’t care either way.
“Sir.”
“Just like you keep telling yourself that you’re not obsessed with him? I never did understand what attracted you to him, but you never could resist his pull. Not back then and most definitely not now.”
In response, Draco sucked more of the lollipop into his mouth. His lips were glistening with sticky wetness, and their indecent shape did next to nothing to improve the painfully hard situation in Harry’s trousers.
An odd sensation surged through him, reminding him that caution was necessary and although the bed was big enough and he knew that Scorpius wasn’t in any danger, Draco still waved his hand and wandlessly cast a cushioning charm around the bed, making it extra-safe. When it came to his son, Draco couldn’t help but take extra precautions, even if he knew them to be entirely superfluous. A parent’s desire to keep their child safe was apparently more potent than common sense. Draco had discovered that the moment he’d first laid eyes on Scorpius, some half an hour after he’d been born. Scorpius had spent those thirty minutes―and Draco remembered the moment as though it had only happened yesterday―screaming at the top of his lungs, making his unhappiness with the mediwitches at St. Mungo’s Hospital clearly known.
Draco paused there and smiled fondly.
“Touch me, Sir,” he breathed.
“Yes, she did. Very much so. Unfortunately, I did not. I mean, in the heat of moment I got swept away, but afterwards it was a completely different story. It was an intense scene, completely different from anything we’d ever done before. With all our other scenes, we always started slow and gradually build up intensity, but with this particular scene it was just ‘
“Remind me again, what question was that again? I don’t think you asked properly.”
’ you’d hoped for, that is.”
“Is it going to protect you from all the bad things?”
He could feel the haze threatening to take over his thoughts and shaking his head slightly, he attempted to temporarily keep it at bay.
Closing his eyes, Draco took a deep breath, and clenching his fists so tightly that his own fingernails dug into the flesh of his palms, he dove headfirst into the bright green flames.
Draco shook his head.
“Please don’t, I didn’t bring a change of clothing. Now, out with it. We all knew that you were going to plight Draco your troth sooner rather than later, but why is big bad Charlie to blame?”
“What has you this amused, my little prince?”
Draco couldn’t help but look at Harry, who smiled at him. Feeling his heart flutter with excitement, Draco glanced around. He hadn’t set foot into Ysabeau’s rose garden in years and couldn’t deny that the blooming display of over five-hundred varieties of blooming roses was, truly, an extraordinary sight. They were surrounded by sumptuous pale pink bourbon roses, inspired by the Empress Josephine’s famous garden, and delicate Chinese tea roses in shades of cream, pink and red. Light-crimson and deeply-scented shrubs of Rosa gallica officinalis from Persia, and other prehistoric hybrids made a deliberate and pretentious display of their stunning beauty.
“You know, I highly doubt that. While you might think that me bending you over my knee and smacking your behind a few times is going to make you feel better, I can guarantee you that you’ll feel worse tomorrow morning, and it won’t be because you’ll have to spend the day sitting on two thrumming and throbbing arse cheeks.”
Without an appointment, of course, because if Potter could make unreasonable demands, so could he. They’d met in Potter’s private office at the Ministry―or rather Draco had barged into Potter’s office―and there, though only after glowering at Potter for much longer than strictly necessary (not that it was necessary at all), Draco had procured a quill from a special case in his black leather satchel.
When he pulled away, they both had to take a moment to regulate their breathing and the soft flush that graced Draco’s cheeks did unspeakable things to Harry. For a moment, he wished that they could make a run for it, apparate away from the Burrow and return home to play for a while. But this is was Arthur’s and Molly’s special night, and Harry wasn’t about to disappear on them just to indulge his deviant imagination and have sex with Draco. There would be plenty of time for that later, and Harry had every intention of making sure of that.
Harry wanted to reach out and squeeze his arm to reassure him, just like Caleb had done for him only minutes ago, but Caleb waved him off with a smile.
“Here? Now?” he whispered, his voice shaky and unsteady.
Harry laughed.
Draco reciprocated and entirely free from troubling thoughts about the never-ending stream of work that perpetually cluttered up his desk, Harry allowed himself to relax even further, comfortable with this moment, the here and now. There was no place he’d rather be. Enjoying a peaceful cup of coffee together with the man who had boldly stolen his heart―and several pieces of his sanity―was everything and more. It was perfection. He felt grounded, but most of all, he felt at home, and as though he belonged.
Draco slowly opened his eyes and looked at him through their reflection in the floor-length mirror of their bedroom. His silvery-grey eyes gleamed, and there was a spark of pure joy in his eyes, yet at the same time, Draco also looked incredibly vulnerable. It ignited something fierce inside of Harry and his desire to protect and cherish Draco overruled all others.
I know this is not everyone's cup of tea and not everyone agrees with the way I've portrayed them in this story, but at the end of the day, it's my story and the way I've written all the members of the Weasley family works best for my story, and I hope, that even if you have a different opinion on the characters, you can understand where I'm coming from.
Sure, they’d tried to make time for each other, but Draco had been determined to prove himself as a prosecutor and he, too, had found it difficult to let go of his work in favour of spending more quality time with Malcolm. Their month-long holiday in Hawaii had been Malcolm’s attempt to salvage the relationship, but a few weeks after returning home to London, they’d sat down in Malcolm’s front room for a heart to heart. After a very long chat, they’d come to the conclusion that their relationship had run its course and vowed to be friends for life instead. So far, their friendship had outlasted their love affair, and Draco cherished their easy-going camaraderie. Post-war, he’d purposefully lost touch with his most of his Slytherin housemates and had no idea what the majority of them were up to.
“Please what, Malfoy?”
He hadn’t quite expected to hear that and was a little bit stunned for words. Harry’s squeezed his hand and blinking a few times, Draco considered the offer.
Liam’s devotion to his Master was genuine and strong. It showed in the way he carried himself, and how he walked, talked, and acted.
“Sure. Now, can I have some tea, please? You’re an abysmal host, Potter. You didn’t even offer me a biscuit.”
In his absence, Harry hadn’t moved.
“Seriously though, be good. I can’t be worrying about you too.”
Nevertheless, Harry generally preferred to be in denial about the effect of Draco’s interpersonal skills, though usually only when they were directed at him personally.
Draco slowly turned his head away from the sun and opening his eyes, he blinked a few times, then focused on Harry and smiled.
Draco promptly glared daggers, but Harry remained entirely unfazed.
Those types of orgasms weren’t at all satisfying and Draco dreaded the thought of having one. No orgasms for a whole month was better than a ruined one.
“Soon.”
“I just, erm, thanks for the support. I really do love him, you know.”
He shifted again, pushed his hands an inch or so further into his jeans pockets and watched Draco’s gaze drop down to his hips. Despite all that toothpaste, Harry saw Draco swallowing hard at the unexpected sight of the dark patch of hair at the top of Harry’s jeans. Draco’s eyes lingered for several seconds, but when Harry cleared his throat, they instantly snapped up again. Their eyes met, and without breaking eye contact or turning around, Draco continued to brush his teeth. He bent over the sink, and spit out a mouthful of toothpaste, then let the water run. He cleaned his toothbrush, placed it back in its holder, then rinsed his mouth and washed away the foamy silvery Van Dyke-style toothpaste beard. Straightening back up, Draco turned the tap off, reached for a small face towel and dried first his face, then his hands. He replaced the towel and was about to turn around when Harry shook his head.
Draco spoke, finishing his sentence before Harry managed to pull himself out of his own musings. He dragged his eyes away from Draco’s engagement ring and looked at him, then nodded.
Harry closed his eyes, and a single tear rolled down his cheek.
The dirty smirk that curled around Caleb’s lips was positively devilish.
The cane terrified him and shaking like a leaf in the breeze, he swallowed and blinked slowly.
Knowing that Harry was only teasing him, Draco remained entirely unfazed, and with a mischievous grin, he blew a kiss into Harry’s general direction, then reached for a glass of water and drank at least half of it. After putting the glass back down onto the tray, he momentarily held Harry’s gaze, then smiled and mumbled a quiet ‘
Tilting his head sideways, Draco willingly gave Harry better access and gasped when Harry promptly sank his teeth into his neck and bit him hard.
Even though Teddy went to a Muggle primary school, he’d spent all his life around wizards and witches, and was, therefore, quite familiar with a lot of Magical creatures.
Draco followed his gaze with his own.
“Your efficiency is one of the many reasons why I love you, my little prince.”
He adjusted his stance, and clenching his fists, he pushed them against the outside of his thighs and focused on that pressure instead of what was about to happen. Several seconds of nothing past, then he suddenly felt a tickling sensation around his ankles, and his eyes instantly flew open. He stared down at his legs and the fall of Charlie’s whip. It lay there, snuggly curled around both his ankles and all he’d felt had been a tiny gust of wind and a bit of a tickle.
Narcissa blinked furiously.
“If you say so,” he said with the utmost nonchalance.
Draco inclined his head but not enough to break the eye contact between them.
“Good to know.”
“Do you want me to punish you when we get home tonight?” he asked outright.
George smirked.
For some inexplicable reason, Harry had managed to finish all of his essential paperwork for the week well before five o’clock, which was something that happened once every blue moon. He’d, therefore, decided to take Caleb up on his offer to meet for a couple of post-work drinks to celebrate the start of the weekend.
The small walnut-sized nub instantly reacted to the stimulation, and Draco let his head fall forward.
Harry, seemingly absent-minded, for he was listening to something or other Caleb was saying, drew an intricate pattern on the side of his upper arm, and focusing on the gentle touch, Draco tried his best to allow the warmth of Harry’s body to seep into him and help him relax.
“Yes, Harry? Anything you’d like to tell me?”
“Yes,” he said.
“Fuck, Potter, one of these days your complete confidence in absolutely everything will be the death of me.”
It was the kind of smile that made Draco question absolutely everything.
Harry’s curse-impaired shoulder protests and he winces, but he doesn’t have the heart to pull out of Charlie’s embrace and so he just grinds his teeth together and bears it. Charlie pats him on the back and reassures him that Florin is a decent guy and Harry finds himself agreeing to stay for dinner and meet his blind date, then gingerly rubs his shoulder and casts a wandless numbing spell to stop the pain.
Allowing his shoulders to sag a bit, Draco looked at Potter―stared at him from across the room more likely―and frowned when Potter suddenly flinched and instinctively moved backwards.
Harry chuckled.
This was the kind of outfit; Harry only wore when they played. He didn’t always wear the same one, but whenever he did, Draco’s mind went blank, and he had a hard time concentrating on anything, except perhaps Harry’s orders.
“I’m famished,” he said.
He thumped the ground and glared up at him.
“Exactly how annoyed is Harry over my suggestion to throw an engagement party?” she asked.
A smile forms on his face.
“I get that you’re really private about your relationship and I absolutely respect that, but I’m a bit curious, so if you don’t mind me asking, can I ask why the vehement refusal? You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.”
Love,
With the lunch crowd back at work, the coffee shop was relatively quiet, with only a few regulars lingering behind. Most of the current patrons were either busy with their phones or laptops and otherwise occupied. Some had their noses buried in either a thick book or thought-provoking magazine. Those who visited
“Want to give it a crack?”
“Please what?”
“Draco, dear. I’m so sorry to come by completely unannounced―”
When he’d arrived home around four in the afternoon, he’d found Harry sitting on the sofa in their living room, reading a book. Well, not precisely, Harry had been holding a book, but he certainly hadn’t been reading it. Although he hadn’t actually asked Harry, Draco was quite sure that he hadn’t left the house at all today.
Teddy grinned.
Harry squeezed his wrists tighter still, and humming softly, Draco revelled in the possessive hold, Harry had on him, then whimpered when Harry pressed his lips to the shell of his ear and blew hot air all over it, then nibbled at his earlobe, biting it gently.
“I wouldn’t be so sure of that, brother mine,” he said.
It wasn’t anything fancy.
Draco swallowed again, and Harry gave Draco’s hair a bit of a tug.
“Well, if you wanted to snog me regularly, I most certainly wouldn’t be opposed to the matter.”
Harry grinned.
He handled it with practised ease, though Draco had expected no less, and once he’d found the bight of the rope, he stepped closer.
“Essentially, yes.”
His prostate felt like it was about to explode and his cock was so hard, Draco didn’t think he could stand much more of this overload of sensations.
“What's this?”
“Mummy, mummy, mummy, I want to put it on now!”
“I’m tempted to throw this drink in your face, Reid.”
A shiver trickled down Draco’s spine, and with burning cheeks, he hastily lifted his mug up to his lips and sipped on his hot chocolate, hoping that the cup was concealing at least some of his embarrassment over the fact that he was sat at Molly’s dining table, thinking of Harry and him having wild and unrestrained kitchen sex.
Draco sucked the lollipop into his mouth, then pulled it back, only to push it right back inside. He paused for a few seconds, then let it pop out and swirled his tongue around the very tip. Harry shook his head.
TPE most definitely wasn’t the right kind of relationship for Draco. He understood that, and so did Harry.
Draco surrendered beautifully, gasped and panted, and Harry kissed him, devouring his mouth with wild abandon.
“Handmade, especially for you.”
Harry laughed.
Personally, I share Harry's opinion on "training." It’s an odd word and often confuses newbies to the kink world and it upsets me.
“My perfect, brave little prince, I’m so proud of you.”
Harry smirked.
Harry’s fingers curled inside of him, and rubbed against his prostate, skilfully stimulating him.
“Trespassing onto Government property, impersonating an officer of the Wizengamot, resisting arrest, repeatedly insulting the Head of the Auror Department… My, my, Malfoy, you’ve got yourself in quite a pickle here. Those are some serious charges. Whatever should I do with you, huh?”
Harry laughed.
Harry gave Caleb an awkward chuckle and shrugged his shoulders.
He noted, out of the corner of one eye, that Draco had crossed his arms over his chest and looked rather upset.
With Molly, he was just Harry, a thoroughly ordinary boy. Molly didn’t entertain any of his flights of fancy. He occasionally tried to test her boundaries ― it was somewhat of a tradition among the Weasley offspring, and even Molly’s grandchildren were starting to do the same ― in the end he always backed down and listen to reason. Molly didn’t expect her word to be the golden rule unless it came to house rules and family gatherings.
“Your animal form― What is it now?”
“Meaning?” Caleb asked.
Harry nodded.
“Wonderful, now off you go to your important meeting. If you’re good and get home on time, I might even let you persuade me to do something about that growing problem in your pants.”
Draco was almost sure that Potter’s cheeks had pinked somewhat, that he was blushing, and his reluctance to answer the question without stalling for several minutes only served to convince Draco that he was right. He instinctively filled the information away for future reference but once again didn’t act on it, didn’t taunt Potter, didn’t make fun of him, or make him uncomfortable in another way.
Harry chuckled.
“Change it then, you don’t need my permission to redecorate. Have at it. The only room that’s off-limits is the playroom, but I don’t need to tell you that.”
“You are perfect, my little prince.”
Harry coated his hand with a generous amount of lube, cast a very subtle warming charm on the silky-smooth liquid and wrapping his fingers around Draco’s cock, he slowly stroked it, deliberately keeping his pumps light and teasing.
Over the last week, Draco’s desire to submit every inch of him to Harry had increased tenfold, and he couldn’t see that thrill decrease any time soon. It never really did anyway.
I have a whole bunch of correspondence to catch up, I am aware of that, but after posting this chapter, I'm going to need a bit of a break from the computer (also have a bit of a cold at the moment) and a healthy dose of coffee. I'll write replies later.
He slipped them off his shoulders and folding them neatly, he placed them on one end of the bed. The thought of spending the whole night locked inside this cell briefly crossed his mind, and a small shiver zapped down his spine, though it wasn’t because he felt cold or because he was afraid.
Selly
“Takes one to know one,” Harry said with a shrug.
When he turned around to look at Draco, he found that Draco’s jaw had basically dropped to the ground while his eyeballs threatened to pop out of their sockets. He was still holding on to his wand and Harry smirked deviously.
“I guess I could, but I’m afraid that’s not how it works.”
Potter.”
“Are safe at Hogwarts,” Harry said, finishing the sentence on Draco’s behalf.
Draco nodded and opened his mouth, allowing Harry to feed him.
Potter scoffed but didn’t otherwise acknowledge Draco’s affectionate little dig.
“Nana Cissy?!” she asked, properly cringing at the nickname.
“You know, my little prince,” he said with an air of complete nonchalance, “spanking hurts more with a wet hand.”
Harry didn’t break the kiss for the longest time, but by the time he did, Draco was a breathless, panting mess. His cheeks were flushed, and his eyes were dark with desire. His lips were swollen and wet, and although all they’d done had been to share a passionate snog, Harry couldn’t help but think that Draco looked positively debauched.
Around three o’clock, when Angelina leaves with two very refreshed-looking ginger-haired children in tow, business picks up again. Harry finds himself powering through until nearly seven pm, which is when Rose and Hugo return from the playground and an impromptu shopping trip and demand to be fed.
“Fuck me,” he mumbled.
Draco nodded and turning on his heel, Harry left their bedroom without a backward glance.
Draco and his legal team occupied the three rows of robust wooden benches directly in front of the witness box, and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
A knock on his office door pulled Draco right out of scrutinising a large pile of witness statements in preparation for a new case and lifting his head off the paper, he glanced at the clock on the wall.
Harry shook his head.
“There are days when I’m sick and tired of having to prove myself again and again. Sometimes, it feels like each new case I take on is yet another hurdle I have to master to show everyone that I might be a Malfoy but that I’m not my father. Harry makes those days easier. He doesn’t even need to say or do much. It’s enough for me to know that I have his support, always and without question. The way he loves me means everything to me.”
After the war, Kingsley Shacklebolt had replaced the destroyed fountain with a new statue, one that correctly promoted equality amongst all magical beings. The wizard no longer towered over everyone else but was on par with the witch, the centaur, the goblin, and the house-elf. The broad golden band ran all around the fountain’s low wall, and pictures of various other magical creatures had been etched into it. Draco still fondly remembered the day Harry had brought Teddy to the Ministry. He’d excitedly run over to the fountain and started pointing out all the magical creatures, he already knew.
“Getting old, Sir?”
“Congratulations,” he said.
Only Harry could make him want this with something as simple as a look. Sometimes, a smile or even an innocent touch was all it took to release his burning need to submit.
Still, Harry genuinely appreciated Draco giving him the chance to take the time to regenerate. Now that he knew the reason for his recent depressive mood, dealing with it felt easier and a lot less of a chore. The fact that Draco had made it his mission to help him work through it also made things simpler.
It didn’t take long for him to lose his bearings, shudder and falling forward, he placed his hands on either side of Draco’s head and sinking his teeth into Draco’s left shoulder, he bit him hard.
“Of course, I did, my little prince. Come in, tonight you don’t need to ask for permission.”
Harry laughed.
It was eleven-thirty in the morning, and to his knowledge he wasn’t expecting anyone, but that didn’t have to mean anything. Unannounced visitors were a regular occurrence.
He continued to tease Draco’s cock, toying with his balls, squeezing them very gently, then slipped his lube-coated index finger past them and pressed against Draco’s perineum, stroking the sensitive spot. He circled Draco’s tight and fluttering hole, applied the tiniest amount of pressure, then returned to wank Draco. He pushed him closer and closer to the edge, and when Draco, desperate to come, started begging him, Harry denied him and stopped. He gave Draco a few minutes to calm down, then added more lube and started all over again.
“I love you; you’ll make a brilliant dad.”
The look on Molly’s face changed a little, and she grew a little more thoughtful. There was a sudden air of seriousness about her that Draco hasn’t seen before. Even the first time he’d visited the Burrow when Harry had officially introduced him as his boyfriend, Molly had been relatively relaxed, welcoming him with open arms and insisting on feeding him. Sure, she’d pretended to be a bit of a dragon, spewed a bit of fire, but she hadn’t seriously scared him. It took a bit more than that before Draco ran for the hills.
“Interesting, very interesting.”
His stomach chose precisely that moment to rumble, and when Harry started laughing, he chuckled.
“No, Sir.”
“What potion did you sniff while I was asleep?” Harry asked him, bemused.
Harry had, of course, kept a very close eye on him and checked in every once in a while. He’d certainly allowed Draco to float and dally with subspace, but he’d also made sure that Draco remained coherent enough to, at any given time, be able to tell him what his name was and where they were.
“Yes, please. Will you also bring me back a gift?”
When Harry, who’d entered the house first, after leaving him hanging for several moments, finally turned around to face him, an enormous burst of excitement surged through Draco. It travelled down the entire length of his spine and pooled low in the pit of his groin, subtly lingering there, reminding him of the effects Harry’s dominance had on him. Shifting ever so slightly, Draco idly wondered whether Harry had, somehow, and with a wandless non-verbal spell, managed to turn up the temperature in the house.
“Do you want to give it a go?” Charlie asked, and for a moment Draco struggled to comprehend his question, then he shook his head.
“What can I say you spoil me.”
Draco paused for a short moment and as he fell silent, a wave of applause, led by Harry, who’d stood up and raised his hands above his head to clap, surprised him. He took a tiny step backwards and smiling, Draco patiently waited for his audience to settle down again.
Somehow, his improved sense of smell, his acute hearing, his strength, and the fact that his wolf always had his back, made for a better life experience altogether. He’d become a more sensual type of person, someone who truly valued nature and thrived because of it.
“You two have an odd relationship.”
Harry felt the wisp of magic swish through the air and had just about enough time to thrust his hand out to wandlessly block the stinging hex, Draco had just thrown at him and straightened up.
Draco writhed and thrashed beneath him, moaned and whimpered, and by the time, Harry pushed two well-lubed fingers past the tight ring of muscles around Draco’s entrance, he was a sweaty, incoherent mess, incapable of telling the difference between up and down and left and right.
Draco nodded.
Before the start of the class, Harry collected a bunch of them and transfigured them to look like ordinary wizarding money. On top of that, he cast a jinx on each of the fake coins. It’s a very mild stinging hex. Harry is absolutely confident that the curse won’t do much more than teach those students, who decide to ignore his warnings and immediately reach inside the box, a little lesson.
“I do, Sir.”
Harry smiled.
During the start of a scene, when they slowly worked each other up, it was around this time, that Draco lost the will to resist Harry’s hunger for domination. This time, however, he remained strangely focused, composed, and grounded right there in the moment, letting exhilaration flood through him. His heartbeat quickened, and he felt each and every single word, that fell from his lips, course through his veins. They found each and every single one of the over seven trillion nerves in his body, and together they ignited his magical core, rooting him firmly in the here and now.
Draco shot him a positively murderous glare and thrust a fancy-looking envelope at him. It landed precisely an inch away from the tip of his left Ministry-issued dragonhide boots and briefly glancing at it; Harry arched an eyebrow at his boyfriend. There was no way he was going to bend down and pick up whatever Draco had just tossed at his feet. That was not how their relationship worked. It had never worked like this and Harry wasn’t about to change the rules. Not even in a room full of Weasleys.
What was it that Potter wanted to share with him?
“You love it, really.”
“Use your words, please.”
Draco cursed him some more than breathlessly pleaded with him to
No, he wasn’t going to give in.
He watched, over the mug’s rim, as Molly continued to unpack the hamper, scrutinising every single item with a spark of joy shining in her eyes. She was most definitely enjoying herself; Draco was sure of that.
They finished their meal in silence, and by the time, Harry had cleared his plate and finished his salad, he wasn’t just wholly stuffed but had also managed to convince himself that he’d just fallen in love with Draco all over again. Part of him felt tempted to share that discovery with Draco, but a slightly more prominent part of him decided to keep his thoughts to himself and revel in the flood of warmth that filled and expanded his chest. His mind drifted to a particular small box, which contained a custom-made gift for Draco. He’d hidden it in their playroom on the fourth floor of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, and glancing at Draco’s hands, he visualised the beautiful item in his mind. Harry felt a soft smile curl around the edges of his mouth. He suddenly, and rather fervently, wished that said box was in his possession. This moment seemed perfectly suited to put his suggestion to Draco, and even though the idea also terrified him a little, he couldn’t see Draco turning him down.
Draco smirked.
He finally granted Draco permission, and the second the words left his lips; Draco arched his back, and his hips moved off the mattress. He groaned, gulped down several large mouthfuls of air, and tried to calm himself at least a little bit, but failed epically.
“It’s not made up though.”
“You’ll find―”
Caleb answered his question with a nod.
This was precisely what he wanted.
Behind her, Teddy dragged his feet. He was terribly pale and had turned his hair into an awful shade of mouse-grey. Draco suspected that it had been a burst of uncontrollable underage magic. Teddy was getting better at managing his Metamorphmagus powers, but because of his age, a lot of the changes to his physical appearance were directly connected to his mood and general wellbeing.
Harry placed his hand softly above Draco’s eyes, felt his eyelashes flutter against the palm of his hand, and pressed a kiss to Draco’s collar.
“You’re setting the bar quite high there, Malfoy. Come here then, let’s see what you can do.”
and I think I've managed to include it in the chapter just fine.
He stretched, and unable to resist kissing the back of Draco’s head, he braced his hands on the firm mattress and did just that.
Harry turned around and casually leaning back against the kitchen counter; he inspected the elegant envelope with its familiar writing.
Harry’s soft, teasing chuckle sent a zap of energy shooting down Draco’s spine, and he tried to arch his back but what with Harry holding his arms behind his back, he wasn’t able to do so.
“You wish, Potter,” he spat.
Hermione nodded, then sighed.
“Young man―” Molly started but broke off.
It didn’t take Draco more than a few seconds to work out that Potter was―quite vehemently―trying to resist a shift, was fighting against the wolf inside of him, and desperately clinging on to his human form, unwilling to give it up.
“I’ll give it my best smack, my little prince. And while we’re at it, perhaps also a couple of blows and stings.”
Harry tilted his head ever so slightly to the side and arched an eyebrow at Draco.
He reached out and patted Draco’s back.
“I’ll marry him someday,” he said quietly.
Draco gapped.
“Will you talk to him too? Afterwards I mean? You’re his big brother, and the two of you are so close, I’m sure it would help if you sat him down for a chat.”
He wanted to feel Harry’s scars, wanted to trace them all, wanted to kiss them.
Draco stopped rearranging the clothes he’d already placed inside his suitcase and straightening up, he watched as Scorpius clambered up onto his bed and started jumping up and down. He was already in his pyjamas, but not even that could convince him to settle down for the night. He was a ball of energy and Draco had long since resigned himself to the fact. Scorpius was the perfect distraction that kept his mind from overthinking just about anything, but mostly work-related and Potter-related things.
Potter blinked, then slowly sat up and crossed his arms in front of his chest. He arched his eyebrow in a silent question.
“No matter, I don’t need any biscuits.”
He reached out, curled his fingers around Draco’s wrist and pulled him closer, then leant in to press a kiss to Draco’s lips.
His animal form had once been a stag, now he turned into a wolf.
“Alright,” Harry said, “but you’re in charge of making us some coffee.”
Harry reached for another handful of salted peanuts and stuffing one into his mouth, he slowly chewed on it and watched Caleb pay for their pints of Fuller’s hip new Honey Dew Ale.
A spell of dizziness overwhelmed Draco, and he closed his eyes, swallowed hard, then forced himself to focus back on Harry.
Draco made a soft, keening noise.
“Yours,” Draco replied.
“More like twenty or thirty times,” he said, “poor Nana Tonks.”
Harry’s stomach flipped upside down, and his heart skipped several beats.
“Brat. Like you didn’t just use a roundabout way to tell me that you love me,” he said.
Draco tilted his head a little, giving him better access, and silently inviting him to continue with the kiss. Harry gnawed a little, playfully toying with Draco’s bottom lip, then added a bit of suction, claiming both of Draco’s lips.
“Now, is that more of an incentive for you to tell me the truth, my little prince?”
Draco cried out, begged him not to stop this time, and smiling; Harry pressed a kiss to his cheek.
Harry grinned at him, then turned his attention to Roísín.
“Can you make Spaghetti Bolognese for tea tonight?” he asked, changing the topic yet again.
“Answer my question,” he said, this time with a little more zest to his voice.
“He wouldn’t dare, he actually respects his mentors.”
Draco’s hissed and clenched his butt cheeks, tightly. Harry had struck him harder than he usually did and the belt’s sting made his arse throb.
Draco inclined his head.
Around the time Potter had been bitten, he’d radically overhauled the brewing of Wolfbane Potion.
He wordlessly pulled Draco into a hug, wrapped his arms around his husband and squeezed, holding him tight.
“Please don’t call me your little prince, not right now.”
Meanwhile, Stefan retrieved two matching wooden serving trays, four mugs, six coasters, and four plates for the pastries, Caleb had bought earlier. He took great care in placing the cakes on a large round serving plate, then opened one of the cupboards to take out a French coffee press and a pot for Caleb’s coffee.
Draco smirked.
Harry didn’t think he needed to open the card to understand why Draco was so agitated and furious. He stuffed the card back inside the envelope and turning on the heel of his boot; he faced Molly.
He retrieved Draco’s collar from the right pocket of his jeans, and when the smooth leather wrapped itself around his neck, Draco instantly felt lighter, like a heavy burden had been lifted off his shoulders.
Harry grins.
, he thought and took a deep breath, praying that it would be over soon. He didn’t like that belt, not one bit. Each strike hurt like hell and Draco was sure that the welts across his arse were a deep shade of red, purple, and blue.
“Espresso, huh? Is that a new euphemism for quick, hot, and dirty?”
“Imagine ten-thousand stinging hexes in a single day.”
The look in Draco’s eyes told him everything he needed to know ―
Love,
He resolutely stepped out of that very dark corner of his mind and pulled up a much happier image, the one of his mother and father happily dancing around in circles in front of that stunning tiered stone fountain. They’d looked so happy in that photograph. Happy and carefree and in love. He remembered his mother’s beautiful dark-green velvet hat and how it had complimented her eyes, and he recalled the look of pure and unadulterated adoration in his father’s eyes. Draco looked at him in the same way.
Ron shrugged.
Harry lowered his voice to a husky drawl, and despite looking utterly cross, Draco reluctantly stopped writhing quite as much.
“I’m OK.”
“Make sure to keep an eye on him, just in case. These things occasionally do go pear-shaped.”
Draco moaned and focused on the pain.
“I was,” he said and uncrossing his arms, he dropped them into his lap.
A red ink stamp appeared instantaneously, green-lighting his trip back to the UK, as well as Liam’s, should he need it. As an internationally acclaimed Dragonologist, and considering his senior position here at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary, he didn’t have to deal with any of the red tape that was usually attached to international Portkey travel. Each time he urgently needed to travel by Portkey, Charlie made a point to thank his lucky stars for the privilege that came with his job.
“You sound delightful, my love.”
His heart thumped wildly, expanded, and a breath later, his entire chest cavity felt entirely too small to house all the love he felt for Draco. It was overwhelming, all-consuming, and Harry was nearly dizzy with it. Stars danced in front of his eyes, and he had to blink several times to focus properly. A few deep breaths helped to slow his rapid pulse, and he focused on lovingly stroking Draco’s cheek.
Draco pulled himself out of his own head and focused on Potter.
His hair turned turquoise again, though a quite prominent strand of white-blond stubbornly remained.
Before Harry could respond to that, Teddy piqued up and instead excitedly shared his opinion.
Draco swallowed a sigh.
“I will take you, my little prince, of that you can be sure.”
He took the ring out of the ring box, admired it from several different angles, then allowed his mother to slip it onto the third finger of his left hand. He found it a bit odd that she'd chosen his wedding ring finger instead of his index finger but decided not to point particular minuscule matter out to her.
“Yes, Sir. All green,” he whispered.
Narcissa expertly charmed her husband with another false smile, and practically ran from Lucius’ study. When he tried telling her that he mightn’t be back in time for supper, she merely waved her hand and smoothly reassured him that as the Master of Malfoy Manor, he was a free man and could come and go as he pleased.
Draco whispered his question against his lips.
The tress left his body, and Harry moved.
“Sounds like my two favourite boys had a great time together. Thanks for doing this.”
“As alluring as that thought is, considering that you know exactly how to press my buttons, I am of the opinion that with you, I should avoid any and all temptation.”
His toes and fingers curled and transformed into massive paws, covered with dense, coarse jet-black fur that enveloped every inch of his body. The muscles in his arms and legs burnt, stretched, flexed, and his bones creaked as his entire body shifted and effortlessly changed from human to wolf.
Draco chuckled softly under his breath.
A few students require a bit more help with their spell work and wand movements, and Harry walks around and provides a bit of assistance here and gives a bit of advice there. When it’s finally time for everyone to return to their respective Common Rooms, more than half of the students are reluctant to walk away, but this time, Harry remains strict and shoos them away.
It took him less than a minute to locate Draco in the crowd. Even in the dim blue light of the club’s largest function room, Draco’s platinum-blond hair stood out like a beacon.
“C, do you have a trigger? Like, is there something that makes a drop more probable?”
Draco’s cheeks turned crimson, and he coughed, then cleared his throat.
Harry didn’t need to turn his head to know that the hand that had just grasped his shoulder belonged to Caleb, but he did so anyway, greeting his mentor and friend with a smile.
Draco groaned.
Caleb chuckled.
“Please, Harry,” he whispered.
The old man smiled.
Love,
Draco smiled.
, the video contains a live rigging performance which some people may find triggering, please proceed with caution.
Love,
Post-war, Harry had most definitely become an entirely different kind of man.
Harry whispered the question into the small space between him and Draco.
Draco trailed off and inhaled deeply.
Harry paused for a moment and took another deep breath to handle the onslaught of memories that filled his head, all reminders of the enormous amount of strength Draco had shown and how incredibly supportive he’d been. His chest flooded with a stupendous amount of love for the man he’d asked to marry him and he let it consume him. It flowed freely, coursing through his body with every single beat of his heart. He swallowed past the lump of emotions firmly lodged inside his throat and cleared it with a quiet harrumph.
“I’ve been telling him about Nana Cissy, and he’s rather excited to meet you.”
“Ngh, you’re perfect, my little prince, just perfect. You’re so good for me, letting me have you like this.”
The words gave Draco pause, and staring at Harry, he gulped.
“Smell what?” he asked.
“And you’re telling me all this why?”
Harry rather liked the fact that he had a way of getting under Draco’s skin, that they were that close to each other. It was one of the reasons why their relationship worked and why, despite all their differences, they still somehow complimented each other. They each were a half, a missing piece of a jigsaw that, when put together, slotted into place perfectly and like it two magnets, unable to fight the force that pulled them together.
Draco shuddered.
Harry handed him the packet of biscuits.
Charlie smiled.
Harry smiled and lowered the thick coil of rope in his hand, then casually leant against the side of the desk, and crossed his arms over his chest. He let his eyes slowly trail down the centre of Draco’s bare chest, lingered on the embroidered words written across the waistband of Draco’s boxers, and smirked when his little prince shivered in response to having put himself on display for Harry.
Draco’s bottom lip trembled slightly, though not because he was about to burst into tears but rather because he was a nervous wreck and Harry was thoroughly enjoying himself.
A pleasant shiver surged through Draco, and a smile spread across his lips. Yes, he most definitely could do this. Caleb stepped back, gave him a curt nod, and Draco watched him jump off the stage. He found his seat in the front row, right in front of the stage. Stefan had already taken his seat on a chair to Caleb’s left and Harry, who had thrown one leg thrown over the other and had folded his hands loosely in his lap, occupied a comfortable-looking upholstered chair on his right. Charlie sat next to Harry, and Liam was kneeling on the floor with his side lightly pressed up against Charlie’s leg.
Harry smiled.
“Breathe. Slowly.”
Potter coughed and cleared his throat, then looked away. For a while, his gaze wandered around the room, but eventually, it settled on his and Draco’s Auror Academy certifications. They’d both passed with flying colours, and after they’d moved into this office together, Draco had insisted on framing them and putting them up on the wall. For a while, Potter had repeatedly taken them down. He’d only stopped after Draco had applied a permanent sticking charm to the back of both frames.
The gesture was simple enough, but the message behind it was a powerful one, and Draco truly cherished it.
They walked past the rows of vegetable patches and headed further until they reached a large open space, perfect for wielding whips and other sorts of mischief. An old oak tree grew nearby, and a broad wooden swing hung from its branches, and for a moment, Draco contemplated sharing it together with Harry. It was a childish thought, but it was a fun thought and smiling softly to himself, he pinned the fantasy to a secret wall inside his heart, choosing to keep it close to his chest, instead of allowing it to get lost among the myriad of thoughts that filled his head daily.
Draco’s eyes darkened considerably.
Harry continued to fuck him hard, gripping his hip hard enough to leave a massive bruise behind, and his prostate succumbed to the overload of sensations, and he came, feeling his arse muscles clench around Harry’s cock. His own cock remained hard, for Harry had squeezed the base hard enough to prevent him from spurting his load all over the metal bed, but once the effects of his prostate orgasm subsided, Harry continued to stroke his cock.
He was quite aware that he’d gone a bit over the top with the number of items, he’d chosen, but he’d lost himself in the moment ― shopping occasionally did that to him.
Draco growled and glowered at him, but made no attempt to make any sort of sassy remark, and smiling, Harry carefully helped him up and walked him to the bathroom door.
The inside of Draco’s thighs was a rather sensitive area, and suddenly, Harry couldn’t wait to find out how his little prince might respond to having that particular stretch of his deliciously milky-white skin roughly teased with the help of prickly facial hair, several well-placed bites, and streak after streak of fingernail scratches.
Draco nodded, then shook his head immediately afterwards.
Draco sputtered and went to object, but Harry simply shushed him.
Draco smiled.
Teddy chuckled, then abruptly turned his head and asked a question that had Draco nearly choke on his coffee.
Ron grinned.
For some reason, the fact that he was crying only increased the burn inside his mouth and continuing to fan himself, Harry actually felt his body temperature temporarily rise a degree or two.
“I’m starting to discover that. My respect, Weasley, my respect.”
“How severely?”
His own body came alive, and an abundance of feelings flowed through him. The entire scene, Draco’s submission, and his constant begging had aroused Harry mentally, stimulating him to the point of no return. Now, the physical sensations drove him beyond wild, and soon enough he increased his pace, fucking Draco harder, claiming him over and over again.
While it made sense for Draco to experience sub drop, it didn’t explain Harry’s odd behaviour, not even in the slightest. Charlie knew that Harry was experienced enough to be able to handle any level of sub drop without as much as batting an eyelid.
“What would you like to know?”
Miraculously, and the despite the mess he managed to create in his office at the Ministry or his study at home, he still possessed the ability to get some work done. Despite having known Harry for over two decades hand having dated him for a little over two years, Draco still considered him an amusing conundrum full of unexpected surprises.
“I’m going to make you lose your mind, gorgeous,” he whispered, breathing the words directly into Draco’s ear.
Harry felt a soft shudder slide down the length of his spine, and taking the coffee mug from Draco, he wrapped his hands around it, brought it up to his lips, inhaled deeply, and gently blowing on it, he took a few small sips and smiled quite contentedly.
With that many students, Harry is forced to hold his lecture outside and he takes his students down to the Quidditch pitch where he teaches them two new spells, an offensive and a defensive one, then has them practise in pairs. Teddy refuses to stand by and watch the others and boldly challenges a seventh year Ravenclaw student, who laughs but agrees to practise with him.
“Thank you, my love, I knew you’d understand.”
“I’m an independent advisor, Potter. I work voluntarily, and as such, I pick my cases. You know that just as well as I do, even if you need daily reminders of the fact. But, if I may refresh your memory, it was part of our deal of me joining the DMLE and becoming your partner in the first place.”
Harry growled into his ear, squeezed his hips hard enough to bruise, and then pushed two fingers into his arse, rubbing his prostate.
This time, the smile that curled around Draco’s lips actually made it all the way up to his eyes, and he nodded. An endearing aura of excitement and anticipation surrounded him, and Harry flashed him a cheeky grin, then deviously decided to push Draco towards giving him a proper answer as well as addressing him correctly.
Poorly cast, that spell had the potential to slash through one’s skin, but since being in control came easy to Harry, remaining focused and channelling his magic, even without the use of a wand, wasn’t something Harry struggled with. Draco couldn’t help but admire Harry for that. He supposed that at this stage, he ought to be used to Harry’s skills, but it was moments like this when Harry did things like that and surprised him. Ordinary, the idea of anyone coming anywhere near his skin with the sharp blade of a knife, let alone the powerful, and occasionally volatile, nature of a Severing Charm, made Draco want to run a mile.
Harry wordlessly took Draco’s hands into his own, and squeezing them lightly, he rubbed his thumbs over the back of Draco’s hands, then slowly edged them towards Draco’s wrists. They found Draco’s pulse points and pressing against the sensitive spots, he moved them around in relaxed and unrushed circle.
Teddy pulled a face.
“Will do.”
Yes, those.
Harry hummed softly and drank a bit more.
“You know what, Reid, for once I agree with you.”
“I love having you in my ropes, my little prince. You’re absolutely stunning and so very sexy.”
“How very kind of you, Ronald Weasley, but you’re still truly incorrigible.”
At the moment, Draco was unable to remain still.
Abandoning the idea of attempting to do magic completely, he closed his eyes and rested his forehead lightly against the cold metal bar in front of him.
“How do I look at Harry then?”
Harry reached for his pint and took a sip, then nodded slowly.
“Good, but first, take care of your man. He really needs you right now.”
“You wouldn’t want me any other way.”
“Hm, dinner was great, love, thank you. You know what, I’m feeling a bit tired, today was a bit of a stressful day. I think I’ll just jump into the shower and crawl into bed. I need an early night.”
He heard Charlie chuckle softly and dragging his eyes away from the whip, Draco attempted to concentrate on Charlie.
“You most definitely should. You truly have the most marvellous voice.”
“Hey! Nana Tonks loves me.”
“OK?” he whispered.
Not this time.
With a somewhat wary and quite frankly also perplexed look on his face, a look that he tried his hardest to disguise as an expression of pure nonchalance but was sure he didn’t quite manage, Draco watched as Potter―entirely unfazed about the fact that they barely qualified as friends or even acquaintances―tugged at his button-up shirt.
“I thought you said you’d be busy helping Caleb.”
Harry Potter had become the sort of man who made the rules, not followed them. He liked giving orders, and he certainly enjoyed watching others execute those orders. Harry most definitely wasn’t the type of person who blindly followed instructions just because a book told him to do so and not even something as innocent as a cookbook could convince him otherwise.
Teddy grinned.
Draco swallowed hard.
“I’m beyond happy. Speaking of happiness, you’re probably going to try and kill me for this, but do you and Harry have any plans to make things official?”
“How long have you two been married now?” he asked.
Draco’s breathing was shallow, his nipples erect and his cock was seeping precum again.
“Stop.”
Harry led them quickly to the sitting room. He sat in his favorite chair, one of the only Black antiques he’d kept after having it quadruple-checked for any Dark curses, and gestured for Draco to sit wherever he felt most comfortable. The other man chose the corner of a couch directly next to Harry.
“No, Harry,” Ginny said, and she extracted her hands from his, before scooching away from him towards one end of the sofa.

“Language,” Harry admonished Draco, and pinched his nipple sharply, causing the other to yelp.
“You are such a Hufflepuff, you know that?” Harry said and he pulled the blond towards him before the other man had a chance to mock-react to Harry’s audacity in comparing him to a Hufflepuff. Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s. The kiss was sweet and deep, and when the two released, they felt grounded again, with themselves, with their magic, and with the Earth.
Malfoy offered him a small smile and nodded in gratitude.
“Yeah, we’re STARVED,” Ron added.
The door clicked and the Room swung it’s door open, nice and slow, revealing Draco in all his glory.

Harry exhaled in relief, his face breaking out into a grin. “Really?”

“Harry…She’s never going to love you like I can. I want you
“Harry—”
“Wanted to check out what’s up with that portrait that got you all jumpy and running to the dungeons the other night.”
Harry couldn’t pinpoint exactly how Hermione was feeling. She certainly had every reason to seem perplexed, concerned, and maybe even a bit put out at having waited up for him worrying. But she kept her face placid, looking up at him from the couch expectantly.
“I love how I can undo you with just a simple touch.” Harry smiled, though his partner could not see him, and Draco moaned in reply.
“Yes? Er…Draco?”
“Apparently. Installing plumbing seems to be the only renovation Hogwarts has had in the past 1000 years. It’s almost like a breath of fresh air that things are finally moving around a little bit, even if we’re not sure why.”
” Harry allowed the S’s to hiss out of his mouth in a way he knew Dragana loved. Dragana felt her cheeks start to warm and felt Harry’s body shake as he chuckled.
Harry took a deep breath. He hadn’t told anyone apart from Ron and Hermione this part of the story.
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. “Then do it.”
That did it. Blood rushed to Harry’s cock which twitched with arousal. His cheeks blazing, Harry thought,

“Put it on me,” Draco ordered, and Harry quickly obeyed.
Draco continued, “In her prophetic dream, she saw that this would only foster animosity between magical folk.  She knew that this would lead to an increase in Pureblood supremacy. What’s astounding is she predicted the rise of Lord Voldemort and the final battle here at Hogwarts. Ravenclaw believed that it all stemmed from the founders’ decision to divide young wixen into different Houses.”
not.”
“Will I…?” Draco quirked an eyebrow.
It was that one word—spoken so softly, as a plea —that made Draco stop.

“What was that?”
“Hang on,” Harry said, squinting at the page again. “'Before adopting muggle plumbing methods.’ So wixen
. Draco couldn’t possibly know what he was doing to Harry… could he?
Draco grumbled, “Yes, sir.”
Ginny looked at the tree again and recalled how particularly special this tree was to Ginny and her mother because it was the actual first one, as in, the first of the six Mum had chopped down. Ginny had to grin and let out a laugh. The mental image of her mother swinging an axe and hacking away at her Christmas trees was ridiculous. In fact, Mum had deftly taken her wan and with a masterful swipe had sliced the tree at the perfect height to encourage new magical growth.
Dragana chuckled. “I want to write this down.”
Not trusting himself to speak, Harry readjusted the strap on his school bag (he’d brought the Ravenclaw biography with him, just in case) and closed the distance between them, reaching out to where he guessed Draco’s body to be and felt the velvety cloak and something solid beneath it.
Harry, Ron, and Draco looked quizzically at Seventh-Year Luna Lovegood and fellow Eighth-Year Susan Bones.
Harry laughed lightheartedly, knowing Draco trusted him and didn’t believe Harry would actually cause a scene in front of the muggles. But what in Merlin’s name was an

came Dragana’s heels as she strode across the bedroom and into the bathroom as Harry turned to look at her.
Harry nodded and ruffled Albus’ hair, as messy and out-of-control as his own. “I hear that you’re nervous about making the wrong choice.”
Draco had led them to the Entry Hall and out the main doors into the freezing night air.
“Just… just hold for a second. Please? I’m sorry...”
“You know, this church is considered architect J.B. Fischer’s greatest work,” Draco had explained, “And it’s not too difficult to comprehend why. As you can see—” Draco looked up at the building in awe as he held both arms open, presenting the church to Harry, who bit his lip attempting not to laugh at his lover who was taking his tour very seriously.
“O…kay,” Harry said, his confusion blatant on his face.
After several minutes, Ginny was able to breathe more freely. She grabbed her wand from the table next to the sofa and cast a gentle nasal clearing spell. She took a deep breath, filling her lungs. She expelled the breath.
At the sound of his name, Harry looked up from his mug and met Draco’s eyes. And for a moment, it really felt like Draco was trying to read into his soul. He felt exposed and anxious, but forced himself to keep eye contact. He saw Draco initiate a breath and followed suit. As they both exhaled in a deep sigh, Harry felt him relax into their mutual gaze. And, before he could help himself, he was also trying to read into the other man’s soul.
She and her family had always cherished Christmas. It was such a magical time—and not only just because of its sheer beauty, aesthetic, and joy. Ginny had always felt her
“So…what are you up to?” Draco asked. He remembered his scheme, sure. But he had to lead up to it; it was only logical.
Trying to get the broom from the entry hall to the Room of Requirement without being spotted by teachers was going to be difficult.
“Okay!” Harry said, loudly, cutting Draco off. “I admit that sounds...kinda fucked up...when you put it that way.”
Draco nodded. “That makes sense. Having a sense of identity is crucial. But… I see a lot more in you than just stereotypical Gryffindor bravery. And… well, that’s one reason I fell in love with you.”
When Draco was finished, he collapsed on Harry’s chest. Their hearts pounded against each other, and they both gasped for breath, trying to recover from the intensity of their orgasms.
They were silent for a moment and Draco became highly aware that they were still holding hands — which were growing ever warmer — in front of dozens of strangers, as well as Weasley and Granger. He was also aware of how
“You’re such a good boy for letting me admire you,” Harry said.
Harry chuckled. “You really don’t think I’d deny you on Christmas, do you?”
“It was Winky,” Hermione explained quickly and gave them both a sad smile. “I must admit I started crying as well. Those socks she was wearing? One was mustard yellow and one was violet. Your Christmas gifts to Dobby. And the tea cozy certainly looked like it was one I had knitted back in Fourth Year.”
A robin fluttered from a top branch and landed on one lower to the ground, directly in Draco’s line of sight.

The Room had provided three mirrors for him to admire himself in, something Draco had taken advantage of that morning when he'd been alone. He was grateful for the mirrors now—his nerves threatening to call everything off, change back into his trousers, and just give up the broomstick.
Harry whimpered at the empty sensation, suddenly feeling bereft.
Looking at Draco, Harry noticed the other man's cheeks were also flushed. A lock of Draco’s blond hair had fallen in front of his eyes which were heavily dilated.

Draco wrapped his arms around the slightly shorter man and said, his voice soft, “I’ve got a different plan. One that’s better for you. It’s a plan that won’t include traveling with an unknown Underground in a foreign city.”

of nothing else other than Draco’s lips pressing against his. Slowly, they began to find a rhythm and Harry brought his free hand, shaking slightly, to rest on Draco’s cheek.
“What?” Harry narrowed his eyes in suspicion.
The pounding stopped.
“What are you going to wish for, my love?” Harry asked Draco while readjusting Scorpius’ hat as it was threatening to slip over his eyes.
“Harry.”
“Potter, you haven't even taken one step inside yet. Come, let’s start with a hot chocolate to walk with.”
"You’re so good," Harry complimented. "I’d like to give you a present…”
Hope you enjoyed it! I drew the Ace of Pentacles from my Tarot deck, and took that as inspiration to write about their first year working at Hogwarts together <3
Harry nodded and breathed deeply multiple times getting used to the feeling of Draco’s cock inside of him. Draco made it easier for him to relax by covering his face, neck, and chest with soft kisses.
As they did so, she waved her wand and the classroom door shut and locked itself. “How can I help you Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy? I must say I’m surprised but pleased to see you getting on with each other.”
“No, I’m perfectly Sirius...
“You’re welcome, Harry.” Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry, who closed his eyes and returned the kiss with fervor. After a couple minutes, Harry pulled back slightly, his eyes still shut, and said, “I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
“Well, anyone with half a brain cell should be able to see that--”
Beta 2: DITTO
Draco, as prepared as he had been to receive Harry’s response, looked at him with widened eyes and gaped slightly, but able to form the single word:
Harry scoffed. “Prat.” But there wasn’t any malice behind the word, and Malfoy continued as if Harry hadn’t said anything.
When Draco reached a hand up to cup Harry’s balls, Harry gasped and said, “Merlin, Draco…” His legs were shaking fiercely now and he knew he was closer to coming than he’d like. I don’t know how much longer I can…”
Draco bit his lip. “I’m sure that’s the only reason,” he mumbled. Harry felt his face flush and elbowed him sharply. Draco was deviating from the carefully-curated plan they’d made together that morning.
Harry thought. His blond hair had grown out a little, something the former Slytherin would never have allowed at Hogwarts. Draco took a hand and brushed the hair out of his eyes. The moment was so fluid and flawless…Harry found himself at a loss of words. He couldn’t even ask him what the hell he was doing there.
“There’s more?!” Hermione practically shrieked.
The two of them were quiet for a few moments. Harry, unsure how to break the silence, gazed into the fireplace and began playing with a loose string on his robes, rubbing it in between his thumb and forefinger then tugging it out gently.
“Fuck!” Draco swore, as he felt the pain in his wrists and knees. He was mostly covered by the Cloak, though he was sure his hands and feet were visible. The
“Dray!”
“You said it, Potter. Not me.” Malfoy’s smirk spread into what Harry thought mimicked a real smile quite well.
. Please?”
Ginny nodded slowly as the words traveled across the length of the sofa, twisted into her ears, and the meaning behind them dawned upon her.
… As if Harry’s wish were the Room’s command, a string of (magically lit) multicolored Christmas lights appeared on the table beside him.
It looked as though his boyfriend had just woken up, having had a Sunday lie-in. His hair was sticking up in the back, like Harry’s often did, and he had to smile. But his smile quickly faltered when he noticed Draco looking at the wrapping paper on the couch. He raised an eyebrow in Harry’s direction.
Harry shook his head, but he was grinning from ear to ear. “You’re beautiful, too.”
Harry’s eyes widened in shock once again and raised an eyebrow, “Same old Malfoy, then?”
“Flip towards the back,” Harry suggested.
Harry rolled his eyes but scooched closer to Draco, straining his neck to get a peek at the book. Draco had turned to the same section Hermione had read aloud to them earlier that day, all about Ravenclaws architectural plans which were “too radical” or “unnecessarily problematic.”
. Just. Tell me a lie.”
“I’m sorry, I was just taken aback is all. What did you say?” Harry had definitely forgotten by now.
, Harry thought. “But, Draco…” Harry picked up their conversation about the second surprise from earlier. “There’s just one problem with this second surprise of yours…”
The room had fallen silent, obviously sensing the mood shift and Dragana slowly reached for the ribbons on the Cracker, untying the knot with a gentle tug. In that instant, the paper disappeared—a white Christmas rose was in its place, and at the center of the rose rested a radiant deep blue oval-cut sapphire set in a white gold band. At its appearance, gasps rang out throughout the room, but Dragana’s eyes were fixated on the ring. The jewel was held in a prong setting, encircled by fourteen white round diamonds.
“Hi. Harry,” Draco said, voice slightly shaky and Harry could sense something was amiss as soon as Draco greeted him.
Harry mock-scoffed, “Excuse me? You really think you have a chance against me?”
“Watch these two pages at the same time. Don’t blink, or you might miss it!”
“You just make it so easy,” Draco said, trying to get his laughter under control.

“Fuck,” Harry whispered and quickly brought his hand back to his cock, giving it a firm, long stroke. He moaned again and shut his eyes, again imagining Draco Malfoy… the Slytherin’s lips, curved in a flirtatious smirk, licking his lips tantalizingly slowly, his face flushed with arousal. Harry imagined himself staring deep into Malfoy’s eyes as the other man reached down and removed Harry’s hand, replacing it with his own. Forgetting all about Ron in the next bed, Harry began to stroke himself with vigor, lost in the imaginary touch of Draco Malfoy.
“Now, don’t get cocky,” Harry warned, raising an eyebrow at his blindfolded lover.
“You okay?” Draco smoothed Harry’s hair.
“Can you imagine what amazing magic is hidden in those pages?” Harry asked. “I’ve discovered many of the founders’ objects before, but—”
“We definitely did something right…raising those two,” Draco said as he placed his hand on his lover’s shoulder, squeezing enough to be felt gently beneath Harry’s thick winter coat.
Dragana shivered, a sizzle of Harry’s magic rushing down her spine, as the man’s voice swirled and danced in her head.
“It mimics Greek temple porticos.”
Draco smirked, but nodded once and lowered himself to his knees.
twat.”
Harry pondered this. “I want to be open to anything and everything,” he stated finally. “I feel as if...the world is our oyster now. You know what I mean?”
“Yes, love, what do you want?” Harry said, continuing to ease evenly up and down Draco’s shaft.
Draco and Harry are house-sitting for Bill and Fleur at Shell Cottage throughout December while the other couple is on holiday in France. Whilst Draco is reminiscing about his own Christmases and childhood at his family’s château, he is startled by an eager owl pecking at the glass window. It’s a surprise gift from his mother. And Harry already knows what it is…
Harry mirrored her movements and moved away from her as well, turning his gaze towards the Christmas tree. He hadn’t seen it in all it’s glory yet.
“And I’m sorry I never thanked you. I was...” Malfoy trailed off, and Harry felt the hand on his shoulder disappear, leaving a chill in its wake.
“We’re not going home yet.”
Professor McGonagall gently closed the journal and listened intently as Harry went on.
Dragana’s jaw dropped, all suspicion rushing back instantaneously. “Potter, what have you done?” she asked, trying to mask her horror as their guests laughed at the Christmas drama unraveling in front of them.
This…was just particularly difficult for Harry. This shopping thing. This…Christmas thing. And Harry understood why Draco loved this department store. He could tell that if he were coming at this from Draco's perspective, having grown up in a traditional pureblood family, there was a lot of magic and tradition revolving around Christmas that Harry didn’t understand. Yet, Harry was working on it, because for the first time in his life, he wanted to create his own family traditions.
“Then why would you have any reason to go to the dungeons?”
“What I’m trying to say is—I know you’re still torn up about it not working out with Ginny...”
“Ah…” Harry had remembered those from their trip to Greece, summer of last year. Ever since the beginning of their relationship, Draco had whisked Harry to different holiday destinations—evidently for the sole purpose of admiring the architecture. Draco could be such an insufferable architecture snob when he wanted to be, and Harry loved him dearly for it.
Draco kissed Harry’s neck, nibbling and sucking occasionally, as he made his way up towards Harry’s ear. Finally, he whispered,“You think you’re ready for my cock, Harry?”
“We couldn’t have done it without all your help,” Draco said. “If you want to be involved as this moves forward, we’ll make sure that happens.”
eyes…”
But Draco wasn’t really listening. In fact, he seemed to be contemplating something, and finally he spoke again. “I guess, if you think about it, it’s kind of like Hogwarts is doing those First-Years a favor, messing with them like that. And honestly, I kind of enjoy the fact that the layout of Hogwarts is changing, and the portraits, too. After the Battle, I welcome the change, you know what I mean? Like...we can get away from all that and actually move on.”
“Please do.” Harry felt the wards shudder around him as they dropped briefly to let Draco step over the invisible barrier outside. A few seconds later, there was a knock on the door.
“Oh! Well… I suppose that’s no problem.” Instead of grabbing the book, Hermione pushed it closer to Harry so it was easier for him to take.
All Draco could do was nod. He closed his eyes and opened his mouth obediently, but Harry had other plans. The former Gryffindor took the Room’s Christmas present and unwrapped it from his wrist. Then, very slowly, he tied it around Draco’s eyes. The blond froze for a moment, shocked at the unexpected sensation around his eyes. But the sensation building in his trousers was a lot more distracting in that moment…
to be sleuthing, or have you forgotten?”
“So... I’m assuming you don’t want me to fuck you here,” Draco said. “Any suggestions?”
Ginny sensed the wards around Grimmauld Place respond to Harry’s magical signature and allow him entry.
it was and felt as though  they were in their own private world in the midst of the crowd.
They met with Hermione, Ron, Luna, and Susan that evening in the Room of Requirement to let them know the mystery had been solved. The others listened in stunned silence as they talked about finding the book hidden in the Room of Requirement and the secret enchantments Ravenclaw cast on the castle. When they mentioned they’d brought this information to Professor McGonagall and left the journal with her, Hermione groaned.
“Hmm. Well, either way, it’s incredibly hot,” Draco said as his hand began to sneak its way down Harry’s abdomen.
Harry scoffed. “Could’ve fooled me,
They stood there, feet buried in the snow that was growing ever-higher. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was going to say anything else, so he took the plunge and recited the same words he’d been painstakingly rehearsing since May.
magic was particularly strong during the Advent season. As a child, she used to feel her natural, untrained magic sizzling whenever the temperature finally dropped for good and winter had arrived. Even now, as she listened to the fire crackling in the fireplace, she inhaled the scent of freshly baked gingerbread cookies on the plate next to her, and took in the magnificence of Mum's first homegrown tree. It was clear to Ginny that her magic was in a heightened state this evening, boosted by all the magic of the festive season.
“I’m almost done, I promise,” Dragana kissed the nape of Harry’s neck. “Our song is the gasp that escaped my lips, the day you told me you chose me and our life together over everything you’d ever known and loved and cherished so deeply. I couldn’t believe I was worth it.”
Harry’s left hand was casually extended forward, gripping the exquisite broom handle. The veins in his arm were accentuated by the firelight coming from the lantern they had magically affixed about a foot from the handle’s edge. Harry’s right arm reached around and gently squeezed Dragana’s thigh. Dragana felt her heart begin to hammer in her chest. This had been such a magnificent idea, except…
“You deserve it,” Harry said, utterly unapologetic.
Harry sensed Draco's grin widening as the image was passed to him. He continued to add to the scene, adding the memory of the scent of Evergreen pine...
“I assure you, Harry, I am not.”
“Apologize.” Harry’s order rang out, loud and clear, and Draco did not hesitate. “I’m sorry, sir. I’m sorry for my impatience.” The words came out in a desperate rush.
“You can’t possibly be here for...” Harry trailed off.
“Only one way to find out, isn’t there?” Harry said and reached his hand in to retrieve the book. As soon as he pulled it out, the stones began scraping against one another again until they were back in their original positions. The cubbyhole was nowhere to be seen. Harry gently opened the book to the first page and his jaw dropped. “It
“What do you mean?” he asked.
Draco didn’t know where those cheesy as hell words had come from. But as they fell from his lips, they knew they were true.
“Actually, Hermione—” Harry said, “Can I keep it for a little while?”
, Draco thought, his frustration at Harry peaking.
He took the slightly tangled Christmas lights and found one end. Harry bit his lip, trying to determine what design would make Draco look the most radiant. Inspiration hit him and he got the rahter long, singular string of lights and prepared to bind his lover. It only took about 30 seconds, but Draco was antsy the whole time, and Harry could tell that it took all of his lover’s willpower to keep silent, stay patient.
“I KNOW YOU KNOW I’M HERE, HARRY!” He shouted at the muggle dwellings, Number 12 still hidden behind the wards that
“Draco? Draco’s here?” Harry asked. Though their friendship had grown immensely over the past couple months, Draco had never actually taken him up on any of his invitations to come to Grimmauld Place.
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco continued. “I just want you to…consider that…Harry, she doesn’t even know you! Who was with you through all the turmoil at Hogwarts? At Malfoy Manor? Of course, your best mates, but I’m talking about ME. I was there. You always came to me and I willingly welcomed you into my arms, my life. My

“Malfoy, anyone with eyes can see that something is going on at Hogwarts. Tell me something I don’t know. Like why you’re skulking around in the middle of the night and sneaking off to random parts of the castle. You’re acting just as suspicious as you were in Sixth Year, and we all know how
Harry tilted his head in question.
“Anyways! Harry, do you really think you should oversee the Christmas crackers?”
At hearing that, Harry scoffed and punched the same spot. Not too hard, but hard enough for Draco to stop laughing and scowl at him.
Hearing her own laughter echo in the empty, dreary living room of Grimmauld Place caused Ginny to stop abruptly. She looked back at the tree, with its twinkling lights and magnificent ornamentation, in sudden realization.
Harry looked at his watch. “I suggest we go to bed, as it’s two in the morning.”
Ginny realized that, for the last couple minutes at least, she’d been able to forget. Forget that things were not as perfect as the memories of her childhood Christmases.
“Yes,” Harry said, flipping through to the chapter on upkeep. “That, too. Alright. Here it is: ‘Waste at Hogwarts is most often collected in bins by the students and staff members and later Vanished by the team of House Elves during their clandestine nightly cleanings. The staff and older students who have mastered the Vanishing Spell (

Harry huffed and folded his arms indignantly. Everyone else laughed, and Draco leaned in to kiss Harry’s burning cheek.
“What do you wish to show me?” Professor McGonagall said, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.
that we would stay divided for the next thousand years—”
“I know!” Draco let out a frustrated groan. “Okay. The truth is, it had nothing to do with the portrait.”
thing, well, that I
Harry took a deep breath. “It’s always been really important to me. You know, being a Gryffindor.”
When Malfoy took a step forward to look, Harry did the same, still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak.
“I’m terrible at this,” Ron finally said, “Hermione always says I have the emotional range of a teaspoon. I’ll just shut up now.”
“Harry!” Draco’s frustration was evident in every sound of Harry’s name dropping from the former Slytherin’s lips.
“Are you ready yet?”
“May I take your picture?” Harry asked, “I mean, just for us?”
Draco looked at him questioningly.
Harry cleared his throat and found his voice. “No, no, it’s fine. Please, come in. We can sit in the living room and I can make us some tea.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes but repeated himself. “I said… that the wix in this portrait has gone completely still. Not one miniscule movement. Nada. Zip.” Malfoy gave Harry a curious look. “You don’t know who that wix is, do you?”
“Will we ever have a quiet year at Hogwarts?” Ron asked, rubbing his temples.
McGonagall continued as if Draco had not spoken. “And, as Eighth Years, your priorities should be preparing for your N.E.W.T.s and planning for your future."
It was the young wix with the half-long/half-short hair who had spoken.
Susan shook her head and passed the book back to Hermione, who flipped to the index.
Harry moaned as Draco continued, keeping a slow and steady rhythm. Then, as Harry got used to his finger, Draco pressed it down, then he pressed up, gently massaging Harry in all directions. Soon, Harry found himself moving with Draco, trying to increase the sensations he felt.
Her boyfriend of two years stepped out of the hearth and used his wand to magic away the leftover soot and Floo powder.
“Exactly my point!” Harry said.
lay, undamaged,  a few inches away from Draco, who, with seeker reflexes, reached out and grabbed it just as Potter was approaching. He hopped to his feet, groaning inwardly due to the residual pain from the fall.
Harry shivered, whether from the chilly evening breeze or Dragana’s serpent-like hissing in his ear he wasn’t sure.
Harry watched as realization dawned on Dragana’s face and tears sprang to her eyes. He used the opportunity to get down on one knee.
,” Harry said and opened the door.
“Our relationship has always been about competition.”
Harry looked deep into Draco’s eyes, trying to determine whether he trusted Draco was ready. Finally, he nodded and turned back to the journal.
“Oh!” Luna said, eyes widening in surprise at the offer. “Sure, I will. The house elves were working incredibly hard, bustling about and preparing dinner. One house elf with two adorably mismatched socks and a tea cozy recognized Hermione and immediately burst into tears, the poor thing.”
“No, nothing. I was just thinking…we don’t have a song.”
Draco did not speak. He couldn’t. He could only attempt and fail to stifle a moan, which Harry took as confirmation.
Draco chuckled. “Okay, okay! I know just the place. Did I ever tell you my mother has a Christmas tree garden?”
“Of course not!” said the wix with the buzz cut. “Isn’t it obvious we’re in Gryffindor?” They touched the crest on their robes and pulled it forward for Malfoy to see.
“Mmm... that’s good, Draco.”
“To walk with?! Aren’t they… worried about people spilling on…I dunno, a thousand-Galleon set of robes?”
They had barely shut the door to the Room of Requirement when Draco shoved him playfully against it, leaning close to Harry’s ear.
It was the truth. He honestly couldn’t recall ever having been so taken away by Harry’s beauty before. Of course, at Hogwarts, Draco had always thought Potter was stunning, wicked hot, and breath-takingly sexy depending on the day and his level of arousal. But today…he caught Harry’s eye and the wix stopped laughing with his friends, his eyes widening and jaw dropping in utter surprise.
Summary: When the wards of Grimmauld Place are triggered one evening in December, Harry is shocked to see it is Draco Malfoy.  They have been building their friendship over the past year since Harry’s break-up with Ginny, but he has never been to Harry’s home before--despite numerous invitations. What could be so urgent and making him so nervous that he has to show up now, uninvited at ten past ten on a Monday evening?

“There’s got to be information in here about the castle itself, and her role in making Hogwarts... well, Hogwarts—Aha! Here it is.” Hermione placed the book in the center of the table and they all bent their heads around to read along with her.
“Well, isn’t it obvious?”
Draco inhaled sharply. “You? A Horcrux?”
Harry bit his cheek to keep from laughing, but he couldn’t suppress the smile that tugged on his lips, betraying his amusement. “Come on, Draco. Please. Tell me what’s going on.”
“Luna and I were in the same section,” Susan explained, her voice a little shaky, “looking up some information on Helga Hufflepuff.”
“I ran into Luna and Susan in the library,” Hermione explained.
Harry whimpered and Dragana snickered. She bit his earlobe gently and whispered, her breath warm on Harry’s skin: “Our song is my own incoherent utterings when you take me. When you sslide your hands acrosss my body—when you sslip insside me like that ssneaky Sslytherin we both know you really are…”

“Er—I suppose I’m… going sleuthing?” His words came out sounding like a question.
“The disappearance of your beloved Godric isn’t the only strange thing that seems to be happening to the portraits since the start of term. Have you not noticed?”
“Er...yes,” Harry lied, “Yes, everything’s fine.”
After a few minutes, they separated.
“For you. I’m here for you.”
“I’ll stay. All night. And if in the morning your answer is still no…then I’ll leave. I’ll never darken your doorstep again.
“Well, Ravenclaw was the brightest wix of the age.”
Now that he was inside, he would have to be a lot more cautious. Teachers were about, as well as Mrs. Norris.  Potter had warned him that he suspected the cat could see through the Cloak.

“Well,
Draco nodded. “Long ago. I just…never thought it could ever work. What with, well, everything.”
“Okay.” Draco drifted in midair, presenting his side to the doorway, chin angled over his shoulder.
Draco’s eyes widened, obviously impressed. “You can perform wandless magic?”
“But I’m right here, Weasley, and it’s impolite to talk about people as if they are not there.”
“Fuck,” Harry repeated to himself. W
“So you’ve mentioned, I believe. Once or twice.” Draco winked at Albus Severus, who struggled to wink back, giving an odd quick blink with both eyes. But Draco nodded and put his right thumb and forefinger together. Perfect, he mouthed, and the young Potter’s eyes lit up.
“Not Hufflepuffs?” Malfoy asked, and Harry noticed his deep slate grey eyes were twinkling with curiosity.
Draco nodded quickly and the long ends of the tie swayed back and forth with the bobbling of the former Slytherin’s head.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s. “I can’t either…”
“Oooh hoo hoo!” The wix exclaimed and clapped excitedly. “Congratulations, Mr. Potter.”
Draco felt his cheeks burn.
Harry was trying his hardest to stay in the moment with Draco, but his head was spinning  His heart raced, and he couldn’t see, his eyes blurred by his own tears.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked.
. And I do bet you. I bet you…one wish.”
Next, a sinfully short black leather skirt. He’d decided against any sort of undergarment. Draco slipped it over his skinny hips and, noticing how his cock and balls peeked out, flushed.
Harry is feeling down that his friend Draco can’t make it to the Silver Stag’s Yule Ball. But from the moment the beautiful Dragana walks over to him, he’s enraptured by her confidence and radiant beauty and he soon forgets there’s anyone else at all..
“I love you, Draco,” Harry whispered and inhaled deeply. Draco was wearing a new Christmas jumper from Mrs. Weasley (green and with a cauldron on the front to celebrate his new job). Harry noticed that Draco’s own scent was already emanating from the new jumper—mint, a hint of citrus, and something else—something Harry smelled nowhere else, except when he was lucky enough to be this close to his lover.
copied muggle technology before!”
“How’s that?” Albus frowned at his father.
“Thanks,” Ron mumbled, and tore it open, biting the head clean off.
“Why have we stopped?” Harry asked, his suspicion mounting.
When Malfoy spoke, his tone was gentle. “I know you didn’t defend me for a publicity stunt.”
“Sod off,” Dragana muttered, but she wasn’t irritated in the slightest. Now that she was certain of the
“You’re not Slytherins, are you?” Malfoy asked, and Harry had been thinking the same thing.
“I’ll bet you are… You’re fucking gorgeous when you come.”
However, she was jarred by the sudden soft mechanical whirring of her and Harry’s family clock. The hand with Harry’s face on it had moved to “travel,” and Ginny knew he’d be arriving by Floo any moment.
Harry nodded to show his understanding.
Draco’s hand was shaky as he lifted a finger and pressed the little wooden lever at the back to open the Nutcracker’s mouth.
placed the emerald ring on his finger.
“I’m sorry I said that.”
Draco heaved a sigh. “Potter, just stop being a prat, and give it a fucking chance.”
Harry felt Draco’s chest vibrate as he said, “I do hope these are tears of joy.”

“Obviously, you fucking prat.”
“No, really,” Draco pressed. “What do you mean by ‘but that’s

” Harry asked. “These floor plans were rejected.”
“Well, what?”
Professor McGonagall sighed. “I could have guessed. Mr. Potter, you’ve always had a knack for meddling.” Her eyes twinkled behind her spectacles, and Harry knew she wasn’t as upset as she seemed about his “meddling.”  “And now,” she continued, “you’ve drawn Mr. Malfoy into it, have you?”

“Kreacher!” Harry called out and the house elf appeared instantly at the foot of his bed.

noticed that. But I honestly thought it was some sort of school-wide campaign to increase awareness about healthy meal portions or eating habits or something.” He paused for a moment, as if deliberating what to say next. “It’s certainly been helping me,” Ron admitted and then addressed the non-Gryffindors. “I’ve always had a bit of an… interesting relationship with food. Living with five older brothers I guess I must have—” he broke off and glanced at Hermione who gave him a reassuring smile. “I think that I developed this worry as a child that I wouldn’t get enough to eat… or something.”
“Yes, you have,” Harry said, seriously. “So have I.”
“Yeah… it was.” Harry puckered his lips, too weak to lift his head, and Draco smiled, leaning down to kiss him sweetly. Draco broke the kiss and placed his hand at the base of his cock.
Harry did so, and the sight of Draco’s cock pressed deep inside him, Harry’s own cock hard against his stomach, was so erotic he let out a deep moan of pleasure. “This looks so hot,” he confessed.
Draco’s eyes softened and he immediately looked contrite.
WHAT HAPPENEND? You migtht be asking. I honestly don't know. I’m asking myself the same thing. But I've had this idea swirling in my head and I really wanted to write this story.
“‘The war will rage between pureblood supremacists, encouraged by Salazar’s values and teachings, and the rest of the wizarding population. A dangerous man who calls himself a “lord” will collect followers and lead them in his mission to gain power.’”
“You could go grab another jumper if—”
’s security under Harry’s charms, she pulled her hair loose from her ponytail, her long silver-blonde hair rushing past her shoulders and landing in delicate curls. “Nearly ready.”
Draco loosened his grip on the book, allowing Harry to have a better reading angle.
Harry narrowed his eyes, unsure what Draco was getting at. “Yes, it is an excellent Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said slowly. “Can we go now?”
Draco sat.
Draco knelt on the floor near the center of the room, straddling the broom, and gently lifted off, letting his knees bend softly in mid-flight.  One hand wrapped fingers around the broom handle in front of him suggestively, and he bit his lip at the sight.  Shoulders back, other hand tipping the witch's hat, he hoped he would depict a strong “Yes, I know what I’m doing” when Harry entered the room.
“You can say that again.”
Harry could see that Draco was trying his hardest not to cry at Professor McGonagall’s words.
Harry’s heart was hammering, and his hand that held Draco’s chin was trembling.
“And so am I. And our lives and our love are so complex and I know that…with you I’ll never be bored. You’re witty, clever, humorous, and terribly dirty-minded, I don’t think anyone here knows that, but it is

“Well, one was unintentional—”
“Yes?” Harry brought the corner of his thumbnail to his mouth, biting it nervously. “Who is it?”
He slipped on the expensive black-stiletto shoes with a built-in anti-tripping charm.
I hope you enjoy this final Advent gift from me to all you Drarry fans, everywhere! <3 xo
. His hand was already tracing its way down his body, towards his erection. When his fingers wrapped around his cock, Harry let out a low moan, biting his lip to keep himself from getting too loud. He wiped his thumb over the tip and felt the wetness of precum. Peeking out of the corner of his eye to confirm Ron was still asleep, Harry lifted his thumb to his mouth and licked off the precum, imagining it was Malfoy he was tasting.
Notes: Day 7 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry is a wrap! I honestly was a bit worried going into this today, not sure how inspiration would hit me, or if my low energy and anxiety would make it difficult to create something of substance today. But I am really pleased with how it turned out! Inspired by the Day 7 prompt of the challenge, but also “Isn’t it Romantic?” with Rebel Wilson and “Sleepless in Seattle” with that famous quote spoken by Tom Hanks: “It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together, and I knew it. I knew it the first time I touched her. It was like coming home, only to no home I’d ever known….It was like magic.”

Malfoy let his lips curl into a small grin as he lifted his own hand to shake Hermione’s. “Thank you.” Hermione even returned his smile before letting go.
“Intriguing,” Draco said, his tone light. “Why were you looking for information on Hufflepuff?”
Thank you so much to both my betas, crazybutgood and Vukovich for helping me create the epicness that is this one (two?!) shot (excerpt of a longer fic?!)! <3
“Woah!” Draco said, “This… this is it. This is exactly what’s happening now!”
“Mmm, yes, I see the sculptures you were talking about. It’s beautiful.”
“We don’t doubt that, Professor,” Draco said.
Draco jumped over an icy patch that had almost killed him yesterday morning, and deftly maneuvered his way under the gothic clock tower, which was still ticking steadily along beneath a sheet of ice and snow. He reached the castle without drawing attention. Not that it would matter—Draco was wearing Harry’s Invisibility Cloak, having stolen it last night after their clandestine tryst in the Room of Requirement
The little tyke had certainly put him in his place and Draco nodded seriously.
advertisement for days—the magazine would have been badly crinkled if it hadn’t been printed on smudge and wrinkle resistant paper.
When he sensed they were both finished, Harry asked,“Do you have the radio?”
Either way, Susan took a deep breath and when she spoke again, she seemed to be calmer. “I’m not sure if you know this, but Helga Hufflepuff was exceptionally talented in food-related charms and created many of the recipes that are still used to this day at Hogwarts feasts. She also set up the House Elf contingent here, giving them a safe—well, a

Capitalism at its finest. Harry rolled his eyes.
Potter snorted. “I know, Dray.”
He scooched over to make room for his boyfriend on the couch, and Draco joined him. Harry took a deep breath and revealed the Nutcracker from under his back.
Draco felt his irritation begin to mount—something that always happened around the prat. He just didn’t know how to have a civil conversation.
“How… how is that possible?”

And you’re off stalking that ferret
“Dragana. There are a million reasons why I love you. But I’ve come up with eight. Don’t ask me why eight, that’s just how the math worked out, alright?”
And, of course, those First-Year Gryffinpuffs in the dungeons.”
Soon, Draco laid his head on Harry’s lap, a favorite position of his. He shivered and the Room provided a blanket, covering the both of them in the same moment as it appeared. Draco made himself comfortable, wrapping the blanket tightly and nuzzling closer to Harry, who smiled at the sight.
“Ready?” Draco stood up and held his hand out to help his lover. Harry laced his fingers in Draco’s and the two turned on their heels to make their way into "Ye Olde Drinking Chocolate" where they saw the child from the jumper kiosk getting a new drink with their parents. Harry grinned and he and Draco took their place in line behind the family.
, Ginny thought bitterly, but she bit her tongue again. If they were going to have this conversation, and if they were going to have this conversation on Christmas Eve, it was going to be done as tactfully as possible. Ginny hoped.
When Harry didn’t immediately challenge him, Draco seemed to relax a little, and continued. “It felt like my magic had connected with Hogwarts’ magic or something. So, I’m standing there, and I just feel this inexplicable tug...or force. Like Hogwarts is trying to communicate something to me. I reach out and touch the stone wall.” Draco paused and pressed his palm to the stone floor beneath him. He was biting his lip, brow furrowed in concentration.
“It—it certainly seems that way,” Draco said, turning to meet Harry’s eyes, his face blanched. He did not continue reading, so Harry swallowed hard and continued for him:
“Are you nervous?” Harry asked Albus.
Harry glanced down and noticed his lover’s eyes were closed and his breathing was calm and rhythmic. Not wanting to disturb his peaceful slumber, Harry leant down to give his lover the softest of kisses in the middle of his forehead.
“Of course, I am,” Harry consoled her. “One wish. Okay! I’m with you there. The loser has to grant one wish for the person who’s Christmas cracker is the most marvelous, the most magnificent, most magical—”
“What?” Harry turned carefully over his shoulder, trying not to jostle the two of them.
But he’d gotten this far. And he was…excited. Now to see if Potter would be, too.
“Mostly, we just used tonight to get each other up to speed on what we know,” Malfoy explained. “And now, I suppose it’s time to do some research.”
“Honestly, it’s done wonders for me—smoking pot I mean, not being in public,” Draco clarified, and Harry’s laughter rang in his ears again. It was one of the most amazing sounds Draco had ever heard.
A bit of precum already forming at the tip and threatening to drip down his shaft.
He’d had the idea shortly after Draco had proposed to him. They were already planning on telling everyone about their engagement at their first ever Christmas party as a couple. It was astounding they’d kept the secret this long already—Harry finding it very difficult to remember to remove the ring from his finger whenever he left the house. He’d ended up having to set up an alarm on his wards to remind him to take it off if he stepped outside to work or to visit friends.
Harry took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to release any tension. As he did so, Draco pressed one finger inside him, and Harry gasped at the sensation. He’d touched himself there before but hadn’t yet trusted himself to go much further.
“I thought it might be you.” Draco had vaguely recognized its song. “You’re a little early, aren’t you?”
“She… she’s talking about… about us...” Draco was struggling to speak.
“She—she’s really embraced Dobby’s teachings about freedom and equality.” Hermione sniffed. “She’s actually got an old S.P.E.W. badge—Merlin knows where she found it.”
Look— ‘Private Journal of R. Ravenclaw, Year 990!’”
Draco had sat Harry down, and, in a very Hermione-ish fashion, had offered him a book that perfectly explained the ritual and how they would weave the elemental magic of the Earth with their own. The earliest memory Draco had was of himself standing with his parents in their garden, in front of a bonfire and reaching out as if to touch the strands of golden magic emanating from his mother’s hands. And then, when he was five, he was already able to control the energy of the spell with the support of his parents.
Harry blushed. “Nah…”
“Hi,” the three of them replied in unison.
“What?! We’ll freeze--”
“That’s... that’s…” Draco seemed to be at a loss for words.
It was evident from Harry’s tone that he knew perfectly well that everything was not okay. He knew that something was wrong. And that there was something wrong with them.
Draco’s eyes darkened with lust, locking on Harry’s. He slipped his fingers out of Harry, then summoned a condom.
“Turn around,” Harry asked, but it didn’t sound like a question.
Dragana huffed and put her hands—which were covered in arm-length silver gloves—on her hips.
Harry screamed inwardly. He couldn’t think of anything else he wanted

be? Harry, we definitely don’t have a song. I would remember.”
‘As saddened as I am about this terrible future I have seen, I also have hope. Particularly because of the final bit of wisdom my dream shared with me. Shortly after the war, there will be two young wizards, a Gryffindor and a Slytherin, whose love for Hogwarts and each other will—”
“Yes,
Harry heard the pink-haired wix working the kiosk say: “Happens all the time! Look here—” They took out their wand, made some flourishing swishes and flicks and said, “Schurnulus!” Bright purple strands of magic wound their way around the garment to find the chocolate splashes. It started to glow and hum as the light from the magic banished the chocolate stains, leaving a  fresh lilac scent, wafting off in small puffs of leftover magical energy. Harry thought it looked rather like a muggle iron had just released a bunch of steam over the garment.
Harry wasn’t sure what to do. The Room had obviously set themselves up for a..um..very romantic Christmas evening together. The fireplace was burning, and the magical atmosphere of the room sizzled as Harry took in all the lovely decorations.
Harry’s heart hammered in his chest, but it took only a few seconds for Draco to pull himself together again and adjust his expression into his signature smirk. “Oh,
Draco frowned.
Draco smiled back. “Yes. You dork. Of course, I do. Actually, I’ve…” Draco trailed off.
“Because I—” Draco cut himself off.
Potter paused and Draco felt his heartbeat accelerate once more.
The bird let out a tweet that sounded so sorrowful, Draco shivered.

The two of them had just started their prospective teaching jobs at Hogwarts—Harry in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Draco in Potions. After the war, Harry had been inspired to keep teaching others as opposed to being out on the frontlines like he’d had to be his whole life. Last Autumn, Harry had encouraged his new boyfriend to consider applying for the other open vacancy at Hogwarts—Potions. It was perfect for him, and the former Slytherin only needed a little convincing. Harry knew that Draco had the potential to be a fantastic teacher. Draco
Draco couldn’t help but let out a laugh, partly from nerves, but partly at the absurdity of Potter’s threat.
“Please, what?” Draco asked, and Harry, though his eyes were closed, could hear the grin in the other man’s words.
“I want to touch you,” Draco said. “All of you.”
“Perfect. Tomorrow evening sounds just perfect.”
Draco couldn’t respond, so Harry continued.
And Ginny knew that. She felt it with all her heart. Ginny knew she felt the same for him. But that didn’t make the pain of her potential life with the “love of her life” breaking down and dismantling before her very eyes.
“Born ready.” Suddenly, Draco tugged the Invisibility Cloak clean out from under Harry’s arm.
“WE KNOW!” the two of them shouted back.
The two of them watched in astonishment as the stones next to the door scraped against each other and rearranged themselves, much like the entrance to Diagon Alley through the Leaky Cauldron. After a few seconds, the stones stopped moving. Harry quickly got up to investigate, Draco falling into step behind him.
He held the box in his hand and grinned to himself before standing up again and returning to Draco.
The bird didn’t respond but started singing its springtime melody once more. When it was finished, they stared at each other in silence. Finally, the bird lightly pushed off from the branch and flew away. As Draco watched, he noticed tufts and swirls of snow beginning to fall towards the Earth.
“Yes, you
“Expert Seeker reflexes, my dear Harry.”
Draco gasped. “Harry… you don’t think that’s…?”
“The usual,” Harry repeated and though Draco wasn’t looking at him in that moment, he heard a smile in the former Gryffindor’s voice.
“I think…it’s too early to kiss,” Draco said, quirking an eyebrow. “But I’m here to tell you— I’m definitely feeling the urge.” He winked, and Harry’s expression became even more adorably flustered.
“Do you want me to fuck you?” Draco asked, staying just out of reach of Harry’s frantic hips.
“Yes, what, Harry?” Draco asked.
Draco’s frown morphed into a sly smile.
Harry nodded. “Take all the time you need. We’ve got all night. What else am I going to do but drink this…drink.” He really couldn’t bear to call...
“Oh, yes,” Draco replied, his voice dripping with lust and desire. Harry felt Draco rub against him and moaned loudly.
“Do you want to tell them what we discovered, Luna?” Hermione asked.
“I do,” Harry said.
were approved.”
“Seems we found your prostate, then.” Draco smirked and pushed against it again.
“Do you mind?” Hermione asked gently, pointing towards the book.
“Potter… she’s Rowena Ravenclaw.”
“Sorry,” he apologized, “I just…never thought I’d hear Mal—Draco thanking someone for comparing him to any founder other than Slytherin.”
“Hmm…” Susan was squinting at the author’s photo at the back of the book. Rowan was dressed smartly in dress robes and was posing with their hands on their hips. After a couple moments, Rowan put their hand on their chin in a pensive pose. Apparently, Rowan couldn’t take themselves seriously, and almost immediately burst out in silent laughter, shaking their head and waving their hand dismissively.
“I’m here. You can tell me anything.” Harry squinted, “Everything is okay, isn’t it? You’re not…no one’s hurt or in—in trouble are they?”
At the mention of his ex’s name, Harry’s eyes widened. He honestly hadn’t thought about her for months.
Draco felt tears well up in his eyes as a grin spread across his face. “Too right, Harry…” And he kissed him. Draco gently pulled the other wix closer to him by their entwined hands, and Harry happily obliged, closing the distance between them. Draco was slightly taller, and he relished the fact that he got to enjoy Harry looking up at him in adoration for a brief second before their lips touched.
It's Day 24 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry and I can't believe it! ahhh there is only one more day left. Today's prompt let to this amazing Christmas fluff from Teddy's point of view and it was so fun to explore this family! Hope you enjoyed as wel <3 xo
“Did Professor McGonagall say
Harry’s eyes rolled into the back of his head, his body swimming with pleasure.
“Yes, love,” Draco said and mimicked casting a locking spell on his lips. Or at least, that’s what Harry assumed he was doing. It could have been something very sexual, and Harry had to bite his lip to keep from laughing and stay on topic.
Luckily, Draco had one more trick up his sleeve. He found a secluded corner, empty except for a single suit of armor. Draco stood behind it for cover as he clumsily drew the Marauder’s Map out of his pocket. He felt more than a little guilty, but it would all be worth it. He hoped.
“Why, Draco, how Ravenclaw of you,” Luna said, grinning at him.
Harry was about to lead him back towards Weasley and Granger when Draco said, “Harry?” Draco felt breathless. He was going to say it. And they were still holding hands.
Harry led them towards the Grand Staircase, all the while trying to ignore how being so close to the other man caused Draco’s scent to overwhelm his senses. Fuck, Harry was really falling for Draco. Hard. Feet first. And gathering speed. He couldn’t help but wonder if it really was so sudden...or if it was over seven years in the making.
“I—would love that.” Draco nodded, accepting the invitation.
“So eager…” Harry took his time observing Draco’s beautiful physique. Draco had always been slightly pale, a beautiful contrast to Harry’s darker complexion. The former Slytherin was lean, but fit, having turned his entire attention towards his mental and physical well-being after the war. His abs and, let’s be honest, most of his body were mouthwatering. His biceps…his thighs…his arse, which was currently hidden under those tight briefs… Harry knew he’d be seeing it very soon. But first…
“You love it,” Harry retorted.
,” Ron seethed.
“I have a name, Weasley.”
“Agreed,” Susan said. “Coming to Hogwarts is like stepping back in time. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy the aesthetic—but it is horribly old-fashioned and behind in so many ways.”
Ginny saw Harry attempt to make eye contact with her, but she could tell he had chosen one of her freckles somewhere on her bottom left cheek.
(Picture of the next two pages describing the "Broom Hiding" tradition: Some Scandinavian traditions encourage early preparation for Christmas; the hiding of all cleaning implements is a symbolic act to remind families to rest from work and enjoy the holiday. Alternatively, some versions fo the stories actively suggest placing the brooms outside--so that a passing witch might make use of it to clean up. All non-Scandinavians, however, should bear in mind that Scandinavians love to tell stories so as to confuse gullible foreigners.)
Harry thought.
As his breathing began to slow and his heart rate returned to normal, Harry glanced out the window, surprised to see the blindingly bright moon shining back at him. It was nearly full.
He gestured all around him, the fairy lights still twinkling in the trees above them, and the huts wrapped nice and tight for the night. “

Harry sighed and rolled his eyes. “Dragana, you know very well I am in the
“Once again, your beautiful eye has not failed us in finding the perfect spot, love.” Draco squeezed his lover’s hand.
Harry didn’t say anything. Instead, he turned his gaze to the fireplace, watching the flames lick the wooden logs and stretch up along the stone chimney.
“Thank you so much, Professor,” Draco said.
Though Harry had often thought about Draco Malfoy throughout his Hogwarts days, he’d never realized...he’d never even
“I’m going back to Ginny now. Please, leave. You’re really messing with the wards, and she’s starting to get suspicious about why I’m acting so strangely. And it’s Christmas.”
Harry shouldn’t have been surprised by the question, given their current position, but he stilled.
“Wow,” Harry whispered.
Hermione snorted.
“It turns you on a little, doesn’t it?”
“I’ve really tried, Gin. I have. But. I can’t make it work. I can’t…I don’t…”
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, and his petulance was so cute, Dragana had to bite her lip to stop herself from laughing and swooping around to kiss away his pout.
“I love you so much,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
Harry nodded then said, “Yes. Please do.” He wrapped his arms around Draco’s back for more support.
