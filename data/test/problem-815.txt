The two women were discussing their plans for the garden. Narcissa wanted more roses, while Andromeda loved the idea of growing garden herbs. And Harry bickered with Malfoy. About the latest edition of the Quibbler no less.
The blond looked surprised and like he couldn't quite believe it. Harry wondered if he understood that it was no longer about their bargain. This was about them. It had been about them from the beginning, he realized. He hadn't accepted because he'd been desperate to find out what the other boy was up to. He'd accepted because deep down he'd wanted this, though he'd been too scared to admit it, even to himself.
They made their way back to the street and walked further into the village, with Sirius taking the lead again. All three of them kept glancing around nervously. Darkness had settled over the small village and the street lamps cast eerie shadows, but there was no sign of movement. Maybe it had only been an animal after all. Draco sincerely hoped so. He flinched when Sirius suddenly stopped to stare at something further down the street.
Harry sped up, following Hermione, Ron and Goyle through the billowing smoke, hardly able to breathe. All around them the last objects burned to ash. The heat was getting unbearable and Draco was holding him so tightly it hurt.
Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover. The dragon, obviously sensing freedom, forced its way through the metal doors, spread its wings and launched itself into the sky, with Harry and Draco still clinging to its back. It soared higher and higher, leaving London a mere speck below them.
He was kissing Cho Chang underneath the mistletoe in the room of requirement, absently wondering if it was normal for this to feel so bloody awkward or if there was just something wrong with him.
“I do not want to kill you. I do not want to spill magical blood.” he hissed. “Give me Harry Potter and none shall be harmed. You have until midnight.”
“Ah, doesn’t make much of a difference now.” Sirius claimed. “He was already on his way here. And by now he probably knows we’re after his horcruxes, so he’s going to be pissed enough.”
"I don't like saying this, but Harry is right." Remus said with a sigh. "The risk of the Horcrux getting lost is too high."
Draco wiped his chin with the back of his hand. Then he grabbed his wand from the bedside table and cast a cleaning spell on both of them, before pulling the covers over them and lying down.
“What a mess!” Tonks complained, tossing aside empty vials and gaudy jewellery, accidentally knocking over things and stumbling over others.
They worked in silence, Harry too caught up in his troubles to strike up a conversation and Hermione completely focused on her studies. Harry was a little surprised that even the usually so perceptive girl didn't seem to notice that something was troubling him. He didn't know whether to feel glad that no-one was prodding him for information or saddened by the fact that his two best friends paid so little attention to him these days.
Harry straightened up and looked at him awe. The lilting sound of Draco's voice did funny things to his insides and made his heart beat faster. The Hippogriff however didn't seem to appreciate poetry. It flapped its wings with an angry cry and took a menacing step forward. The blond fell silent.
After a bit of consideration I decided to keep the sex scene (if that even was one) rather vague. I thought I'd leave it up to everyone's imagination to decide what exactly happened between our boys.
So yes, all in all things were good. Usually. But today the Gryffindor was having an exceptionally bad day. It had started during breakfast, when a start-struck second year had spilled juice onto his robes, forcing him to run back to his dormitory and get changed. Of course this had made him late for Herbology and professor Sprout had not only scolded him, but also taken five points from Gryffindor.
Disappointment hit hard. Harry struggled to find words. But what was he even supposed to say? It sounded like Draco had already made up his mind.
“Exactly.” Dean backed him up. “Harry used to be our friend. And now he’s pushing us aside for a bloody death eater. And I’d really love to know why.”
Maybe it was those fears that brought on the nightmare. That made him relive his fight with Ron and Hermione again. He woke to find Draco holding him down, calling his name. This time the blond pulled Harry into his arms without hesitation, already used to comforting him after a nightmare. Harry managed to hold back the tears, but he clung to Draco for a long moment.
“Don't overestimate yourself, Potter. Your mind isn't that interesting. But maybe you actually enjoy your connection to the Dark Lord. Maybe you enjoy being in his head!”
Draco snorted. “You're easily scared then. And I don't need a bodyguard. I've had enough of Crabbe and Goyle following me around. I don't need her to take their place. I can look after myself. And I really need to go now.”
“Do we even have a pensieve?” Hermione wanted to know. Draco was surprised that she’d kept quiet all this time.
“You will be.” Narcissa stated confidently. “Just give yourself time. There is no pressure. You also don't have to talk to me about it. Talk to your friends or a family member. Maybe even a pet. You could also start a diary. Write it down, if you don't feel comfortable saying it out loud. The important thing is that you get it out of your head. That you start dealing with it.”
Harry quietly followed the blond up to the seventh floor, mulling the conversation over in his head. So a few more people knew that he had trouble controlling his magic. Now that his initial panic at that revelation had subsided, he realized that it wasn't so bad. The girls wouldn't tell. And neither would Neville. And with a bit of luck he would learn to stop the outbursts soon enough. So what did it matter?
Harry and Ron had to force the door of the hut open. It was half-overgrown with ivy and the lock was rusted shut. Hermione cast the detection spell, but again there was no greenish glow. They moved around the house next, sticking to the shadows so they wouldn’t be seen and chain-casting the spell at their surroundings. Again nothing.
“Daphne thinks he is. She told me that he looked like he wanted to murder her when he saw her kissing your cheek.”
He left her in the common room and went to fetch his bag from his room. But when he turned around again he suddenly found the exit blocked by Goyle. The larger boy had been giving him weird looks for a few days now, so Draco suspected that Nott had put him up to something. With a sigh he reached for his wand.
He wrapped both arms around Harry and pulled the younger boy close. Harry shook his head, but cuddled against him with a smile.
After a lot of wriggling (from Harry) and even more complaining (from Draco), the younger boy finally landed hard on the other side, stumbling to keep his balance.
Draco hesitated a second. “You wouldn’t have told me the details of what happened in Bathilda’s house.”
I have no idea where Lavender came from. Honestly. The idea of her befriending Harry (along with another idea - you'll see in the next chapter) just popped into my head and I sort of liked it.
"Fine. Be that way. I still don't get why you want to be unhappy for the rest of your life, but it's your decision. If you want to marry the harpy, don't let me stop you."
“I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to worry you...” the blond started to apologize, but she would hear none of it and kept ranting about how worried she'd been and what a thoughtless prick he was. It took Draco about ten minutes and the promise to never run off without telling her again to calm the girl down. To the amusement of the other students gathered in the common room.
She took a seat at the edge of the mattress, casting a glance in Harry’s direction. But the dark-haired boy slept on, completely oblivious to their visitor. Satisfied that she hadn’t woken him she opened the book and handed it to Draco.
They parted ways outside the classroom, all students heading to their common rooms to drop off their stuff and maybe get started on some homework before dinner. Blaise wasn't too pleased that Draco had abandoned him for a bunch of Gryffindors, as he put it.
Draco held out his right hand and Harry grabbed it. The witch twirled her wand in a complicated motion and a white silk rope appeared out of nowhere. It started wrapping itself slowly around their joined hands as they both said their wedding vows.
“He’s right.” Draco said softly, wincing when Remus turned to glare at him. But he held his ground. “You know he’s right.”
"I had a free period. And I thought… well, I haven't seen you at lunch in a while. So I thought maybe you didn't like eating in the Great Hall and … I went to the kitchens and … asked the elves for some food. I thought maybe you'd… maybe we could have lunch. In the room of requirement. If.... if you'd like."
"I don't know. I guess she's disguising herself or using polyjuice. I also think they don't allow mother to leave the manor often."
“You weren’t there, Pans. He looked so scared and helpless. I just had to do something.” Draco defended himself.
When the next letter arrived another four days later, Harry actually smiled and went to open it immediately.
“I sent for her.” Neville admitted, holding up the fake Galleon. “I sent for all of them. We thought... now that you're here... we're going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”
And then Hermione suddenly drew her wand and pointed it at Ron with a wild look in her eyes. “Oppugno!” The little flock of birds sped towards the red-head and started pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. Ron gave a startled yell and ran for it.
Draco laid back against the cushions and jumped in shock when Harry barged into the cubicle. “Draco... are you okay?”
It became immediately apparent that Voldemort hadn’t been trying to trick them. The look of utter shock and disbelief on his face was priceless. He had actually thought he had killed Harry. He looked from the real Harry to the fake one and back several times, as if trying to understand how there could be two of them. Draco wondered the same thing. It had to be a trick of some sort, of course.
"We haven't managed to get out and buy some yet. It's still a bit early for Christmas ornaments." he pointed out.
And before he really knew what was happening, McGonagall had started duelling Snape and the three teenagers had to seek cover from flying spells. Suddenly Flitwick and Sprout joined the fight, with Slughorn merely watching in apprehension. The fight ended as quickly as it had begun. Snape, realizing that he was outmatched, chose to flee through a window.
They hurled Pansy up and dragged her out of the Great Hall, dropping her in a deserted hallway. Draco smirked at the look of naked fear in her eyes as she stared up at him, completely helpless. He bent down and smoothed her hair back.
Draco could not disagree. He’d grown up watching his father treat house-elves like dirt. Not that Lucius had treated people much better. And still Dobby had been kind to Draco, even when Draco had imitated his father’s cruelty.
The dark-haired boy hurried to Gryffindor tower, only taking the time to make sure he didn't run into anyone. Once safely in his dorm he reached for the two-way-mirror and contacted his godfather.
When Draco came to, he was lying on a soft mattress and someone was yelling nearby. He opened his eyes slowly, taking in his surroundings. It took him only a second to realize that he was in the hospital wing. The curtains around his bed were drawn and Millie was sitting in a chair at his bedside. And somewhere outside Harry was yelling at someone at the top of his lungs.
Sorry to everyone who wanted to see Ginny doing something evil again. I felt that her apologizing would be more of a surprise. Did it surprise you?
Harry's hips started moving of their own volition, pushing back, trying to get more of that intense pleasure. His cock was rock-hard, trapped between his body and the mattress. Embarrassing, needy sounds were torn from his throat. Gasps and moans that sounded too loud in the silent room. It felt too good. He wanted “More.”
“Probably. But it would be better not to take any chances. I think you should really learn occlumency.” Draco suggested.
In Charms he managed to set his desk on fire, scaring poor professor Flitwick into giving him another lecture and suggesting a visit to Madam Pomfrey, about those fluctuations in his magic he was obviously experiencing. Harry gritted his teeth and managed to refrain from telling Flitwick where to stick his suggestion.
A pained look crossed his features at the mention of Harry's mother, but he went on regardless. "Bond enaid sanctaidd - that is welsh and means sacred soul bond. The purest of all bonds, it is formed through love. Therefore it is stronger than any other form of magic. Which is also the reason why you both reacted so violently. The bond was fighting the hold Voldemort had over both of you. By acknowledging your feelings for each other and sealing the bond you rid yourselves of him."
Harry was quiet for a long moment, but then he nodded. “I guess you’re right. I still can’t control it. But … what did you have in mind? I mean, the breathing exercises the first healer gave me didn’t work. The techniques your mum showed me help a lot better, but I usually don’t even notice that my powers are about to whack out until it’s too late.”
“Shush.” the blond whispered, claiming his boyfriend's lips in a kiss. Harry immediately stopped arguing and pulled him closer, deepening the kiss.
The blond wavered. “They... they still have to find us.” he said after a moment. “And they won't know where to start looking.”
Draco didn't know what to say. Those other people were probably smart to stay away, but he just couldn't. Not when the younger boy looked so scared and helpless. In the end he settled for claiming: “I'm not scared of you, Potter.”
So... I've been very inspired and managed to get the next chapter done already. Once again my version differs quite a bit from the book, so please let me know what you think. Also there's smut. I hadn't really planned it, but once again the boys had other ideas. And who am I to argue?
Harry read the letter three times and then continued to sit there, lost in thought. He was more than ever wondering who his mystery pen-pal might be. A pureblood, probably around his age. His father was dead and his mother had moved away. He didn't keep track of the wizarding world, so that last fact didn't help much. He was living in a huge house, with a house elf. Not surprising for a pureblood. Harry's thoughts settled on one boy in particular pretty quickly, but he dismissed the idea just as fast. It couldn't be… But why was he still refusing to tell him his name?
He didn't mention that the old headmaster had been rather cross with him, once he'd learned that Harry had told Remus about the Horcruxes. He'd completely forgotten Dumbledore's warning from their first lesson, to confide in no-one but Ron and Hermione. Back then he'd promised to tell no-one but them, even if he had talked it through with Draco shortly after.
Draco nodded, taking deep breath to calm himself. She was right. Harry needed him. He couldn't collapse right now. He nodded and allowed Hermione to drag him towards the castle.
Draco didn't need to ask what Harry was hinting at. He still had a hard time containing his blush sometimes when Sirius looked at him. And he sure as hell wouldn't forget the “Talk” the animagus had given him during the holidays any time soon.
Andromeda's voice had taken on a shrill tone. He only now realized that she had called his name a few times already and that she had backed away from him. And finally he noticed the dark waves of magic rising all around him. It was happening again. He'd been an idiot to think that it wouldn't. The picture frames on the wall rattled and he could still see Andromeda's lips moving, but he couldn't understand a word.
Remus waited for everyone to calm down and take a seat, before launching into an explanation. “It was in this old tome Sirius bought from that hag in Knockturn Alley two days ago. The one that’s written in runes. There’s a whole chapter about horcruxes. It doesn’t say much on how to destroy them, but there’s a lot about creating them. The author warns against using a living being to house the horcrux, because when the person or animal dies, the horcrux dies with them. To prevent that, he suggests extracting the horcrux from the person and placing it in a different container.”
The elf sat up, curled into a ball and began to rock backwards and forwards. But he dutifully began to speak.
But then he remembered something the blond had told him. Harry had been embarrassed by a particularly bad nightmare and hadn’t believed Draco’s assurances that he understood. The blond had confessed that his own nightmares had been a lot worse last year.
The blond got up and took a few steps towards Harry, until they were standing face to face. "No, Harry. We're going to break into Gringott's."
“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we’re in!” she shrieked. She looked frightening, completely mad.
“I have no idea. He wouldn't tell me.” Harry had to admit, still a little angry about Dumbledore's secrecy. “But he said our next meeting would have to wait until after I'd gotten the memory from Slughorn.”
His attempt at joking fell flat. Harry continued to stare straight ahead. But he didn’t really seem angry. He looked more … conflicted for some reason. Like something was bothering him.
Finally she crumbled and sagged against him. “Ron's kissing Lavender Brown. In the middle of the common room.”
It looked like Harry needed a moment to digest this, but finally he nodded and asked, “So what happened when you got home? Did you tell Regulus where you’d been?”
“I'm not trying to make fun of you.” Harry assured. “That poem may not have worked on Wilbur.” He grinned when the blond glared even harder. “But it worked on me.”
“What are you even doing here?” the Slytherin asked, giving up on his appearance in favour of glaring at Ron.
He paused when they reached another juncture and was just about to peer around the corner, when he noticed her looking at him oddly.
The dark-haired boy glanced over at the Slytherin table, where Draco was talking to Pansy. As if sensing Harry's eyes on him, the blond looked up and they shared a smile. Pansy poked Draco in the ribs and said something that made him blush and Harry's smile only got wider.
The blond looked at him with raised eyebrows. “Locking and silencing charms? Why, Harry... are you planning to seduce me?”
“I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually. It is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.”
“All right. Harry, please lie down here on the floor. Good. And Draco, you need to lie down here. No, move a bit closer to Harry, so your arms are touching. Yes, very good. Now I need you both to close your eyes and relax. Take deep breaths. Empty your minds. I know that things might get scary, but try to stay calm and don’t move. You need to trust me. I won’t let anything bad happen to you. … Yes, that’s it. Deep breaths…”
“I dumped her at the party, because I thought she wouldn't make a scene in public.” the Slytherin reasoned.
Harry turned in time to see Draco go into a spectacular dive. He gripped the rail in front of him tightly and held his breath as he watched the blond hurtling towards the ground at top speed. He pulled out of the dive at the last minute, raising back up in the air, the Snitch clutched tightly in his fist. The Slytherins (and assorted Gryffindors) broke into cheers.
“She trained to become a mind healer after graduating from Hogwarts. But when she married father  he forced her to quit. Obviously it's unbecoming for the wife of a Malfoy to work.” he sounded bitter and for a fleeting moment Harry wondered if he even missed his father.
“I'm going to create a temporary bond between Harry and another person. This person will function as a sort of anchor for Harry, to keep his soul and magic safe during the ritual. He’s probably still going to be weak for a couple of days, but there will be no lasting effects. Once I’ve extracted the horcrux, I can put it into another container. One which we can safely destroy.”
The blond nodded and quickly looked away, before he could do something stupid. For a long time they just sat there, holding hands.
“He's made his choices and I made mine.” was all she said. Draco didn't seem overly sad about his father's absence either. Sirius had cleaned up one of the nicer guest-rooms for Narcissa, since it looked like she would be staying for quite a while. Draco got a small room right next to Harry's.
“My friend Lucy, who’s a Gryffindor, said the prefects told them not to bother you. That you want to be left alone and you’d only get angry.” the girl let him know.
“I’ll need at least another day or two to fully recover.” Remus pointed out. “And I’m also not sure if Ron is well enough to apparate yet.”
“So… I guess we should talk?” Harry asked a after a bout of silence. “I mean, I sort of feel like we don’t really need to. But I guess we have to.”
“When you and Remus were here a few days ago, we overheard your talk with Dumbledore.” Sirius chuckled, most likely because he knew they'd been eavesdropping, so Harry quickly went on: “You said something about a prophecy. By Trelawney.”
Of course Draco was late to Arithmancy and lost Slytherin another five points, despite his protest that he'd been held up by Snape. By the time he made it to the Great hall for lunch, Ron had obviously informed Harry, because the dark-haired boy was already waiting for him.
And yes, he had indeed. The first time Draco had thought it was merely a slip. But then Potter had started using his first name frequently. And it felt so natural. Draco thought it should feel just as natural to call Potter Harry instead. And until it did he wouldn't force himself to say it.
“We'll try to find you later.” Hermione promised, dragging Ron away to fulfil their prefect duties. Ginny had already stomped off without a word as soon as they had reached the platform.
“So that's Romilda Vane? There were rumours about you dating her last year.” Draco muttered thoughtfully.
The blond rolled his eyes. “Harry, Andromeda said you can buy him one for Christmas. That's still almost a year away.” he pointed out.
Deciding to throw caution to the wind, Draco just went with it. What good Slytherin would pass up an opportunity like this?
“I wasn't worried.” Blaise let him know. “I told her you were probably shagging Harry somewhere, but she wouldn't listen. She kept ranting about how worried she was, despite the fact that Ron and Luna agreed with me. She even started a search party with Longbottom. And I think they actually searched the castle for you, instead of using the time constructively.”
"A bit of both, actually. But like I said, I'm working things out. It'll be fine." At least he hoped it would.
“I seriously doubt that three mystical items from an old fairy tale are going to help us defeat you-know-who.” Draco agreed with his cousin.
“And he orderer Kreacher … to leave without him. And he told Kreacher … to go home and … never to tell my mistress what he had done… And to destroy the … first locket. And he drank the … potion and Kreacher swapped … the lockets and … watched as… as… Master Regulus was dragged beneath the water...”
He was so preoccupied with the riddle of Dumbledore's odd behaviour, that he nearly forgot about Nott. Therefore he was very surprised when he ducked into a bathroom between classes one day and found the other boy bowed over the sink, in the middle of what looked like a nervous breakdown. His mind flashed back to the Great Hall that morning, where Katie Bell had returned, back in full health but with no recollection of what had happened to her.
Seeing his scowl at the mention of Greengrass, she added: “She’s sorry, you know? For abandoning Draco like that. They were never really close, mind you. Kind of like you and me. But she still feels bad about it. She failed him and she knows it. It’s just… She just did what her parents told her to do. It’s a bad habit she’s trying to break. And… oh, don’t scoff. You grew up with Muggles. You don’t know what it’s like in the old pureblood families. There’s a lot of tradition and .. high expectations. It’s not easy to just dismiss what you’ve been taught all your life. Ask Draco if you don’t believe me.”
Therefore Draco was a bit surprised when Hermione showed up in the afternoon. He was not so surprised to see her carrying a book.
“Aww, poor little Potty.” Draco mocked, earning himself a glare. “Want me to take your mind off of them for a while? I actually came in here to congratulate you on your win, you know.”
He put the two-way-mirror back into his trunk and then he just sat on his bed, staring off into space for what felt like hours. If he was quite honest with himself he'd made his decision long ago. Talking to Sirius had only strengthened his resolve. So why draw out the inevitable?
They still hadn't talked about it. They'd spent a lot of time together over the break and he enjoyed the Slytherin's company, even when it didn't lead to sex. He also knew that they needed to talk about it, but he was scared of bringing it up. Scared that it might change things and that he might lose the blond. Because it had stopped being just sex. At least for Harry.
The man spluttered in indignation and Draco looked at the Gryffindor with new-found respect. By threatening to make him look bad in the press, he left that idiot no choice but to sell Draco what he needed. That was blackmailing worthy of a Slytherin.
January slipped into February and Harry found himself more busy than ever. Lessons were really demanding, though he was getting a lot better at non-verbal spells and even managed to keep up in Potions, thanks to Draco's tutoring. His Quidditch team was shaping up nicely, even with Katie Bell missing and pretty much everyone still avoiding Ginny like the plague. Harry actually felt bad for her, having also seen her sitting by herself in the common room a few times, but couldn't quite bring himself to approach her yet. The image of Draco in the hospital wing was still too vivid in his mind.
And when he'd gone to investigate he'd found Potter, in the middle of a panic attack and unable to control his wild magic. It hadn't been a conscious decision to approach the other boy. Draco hadn't paused to think about what he was doing. He'd seen the look of panic and utter fear on Potter's face and just reacted.
"You should eat, Draco. You missed lunch and dinner yesterday and you're already too skinny. It really isn't an attractive look, you know?"
The days blended together. Harry had no idea how much time had gone by since the fateful revelation, when all of a sudden Remus’ shout rang through the house, startling them all. He had been sitting on the couch with Draco, listening to the blond drone on about something or other without really hearing the words. Now they both jumped up in alarm. Ron came running out of the kitchen, wielding a spatula like a weapon and Sirius thundered down the stairs, wand drawn.
So the six of them dressed in warm clothes, cast a few charms for additional protection from the weather and made their way out into the cold. The walk down to Hogsmeade dragged on endlessly. Draco felt cold despite several warming charms and kept complaining loudly, but Daphne and Lavender were relentless.
"Because your stupid parents want you to marry her, I know. Because the Greengrasses need the money and the Malfoys need to be associated to a family that wasn't in league with the dark lord. Blabla politics. What I don't get is why you go along with it."
And lying here, cuddled together still felt .. nice. Comfortable and safe. The disconcerting realisation made him sit up and grope for his glasses. Once he'd found them on the bedside table and put them on, he hesitantly turned around.
"At all?" Harry inquired slightly worried. After having spent time with them, he did not want this frozen version of his parents, but the lively one. Even if they were a little out of date.
Apparently able to read his patient's face, Harry chuckled. "Yes, … I know, stupid! But we had no chance of knowing that you've already made one. You really should consider labelling your potions, Sir. Anyway, long story short, we needed more than four years to finally find someone who had even the remotest chance of helping you. But once we have enlisted his help, he needed but a few short months to brew the antidote."
"While I agree with Longbottom, I seem to be unable to reveal the passage. The concealment spell is too strong."
I feel like, with this chapter, a more detailed note is necessary. Usually, I try to spare you any chit-chat, since you come here to read a story, and not hear about my private life. If you are interested in me, my projects and my thoughts, find me on tumblr. I'm Anchanee there too and would be delighted to talk to each and every one of you. But I feel the Archive is just for fiction. This chapter, however, needs a little disclaimer.
Once the door had closed behind them, Ron gestured towards the chair, only claiming it at the patient's inviting gesture. His manners seemed to have improved considerably over the last few years. Still, Snape did not care for the idle chit-chat when the red-head started, "I like the new furniture, or the old one, I guess, since Harry said that these are your things from Hogwarts."
Whipping around, wand still in hand, Harry ignored the Lady Malfoy’s flinch when he accused, “You had no right! I made it this way on purpose. She banished Sirus from the family tree, so I thrashed her favourite room. I was about to give it back the moment her son is returned to the family!"
"Again?" Alexander Pince was finally at his wit's end. "By Merlin and Morgana, will somebody fucking tell me what is going on?"
For the next half hour, the raven-haired wizard and his white-haired charge were the centres of attention. Harry did his best not to let the agitated animal escape, while the children tried to offer treats of bread, fruit and chunks of meat they had stolen from the kitchen, irritating the kit further. Surprisingly, it was Draco who put an end to all the commotion.
"And lose others. Everything has a price. No life can be gained without another being lost. Fate always insists on getting its due."
'Oh,' Harry thought, detached, as their spell encompassed the entire British Library. 'There are even more floors below this one. Am I in the middle of the entire structure? That would be good. Wouldn't it? Our spell was meant to spread out from the bottom to the top. Will this work? I should talk to Bill. But now does not seem to be a good time. I am not sure if anybody has mentioned that this would hurt so much. I hope this works. I want to find Madame Pince …"
"Why would you think anything is different now?" The blond asked a little bitter. He had done research, lost sleep and maybe a little bit of his sanity when working on his godfather's potions. Especially considering how chummy he now was with all the Gryffindors in his life. And then that bastard dared to give up before they had explored all venues of what might help his recovery.
"As his friends," Hermione interrupted gently. "It is our duty to support him to the best of our abilities. But we can't educate him on things he does not want to learn."
else. He won't make a move before it's finished, and Severus is simply not the type to make the first step."
“No... I mean,” it’s weird for him to just go up to talk to a worker for no reason right? “Er... yes, what’s your recommendation?” He asks, already knowing Draco’s carefully crafted top ten books, none of which will be offered at this muggle bookstore.
Theodore Nott was holding two coffees, and in one hand he also had a bag, presumably with baked goods inside of it. His eyes flittered between Harry and Draco, his mouth twisted in a scowl.
Draco waited another couple seconds, and began shifting papers awkwardly. Pretty soon the blurriness wouldn't go away and he felt his eyelids lowering slowly. He cleared his throat again, silently panicking.
"Perfectly fine," he says, hoping that the guy doesn't feel the need to prolong the conversation. If he gets straddled with another Spencer he might actually quit this job. He'd be slightly sad to leave Rosie, but he imagines it wouldn't be hard to write her the occasional letter. He could find some other place, another nice and calm library to work at.
I was meaning to wait a week before uploading this but I'm so impatient and I want to know what y'all think. More chapter will take more time so don't expect daily updates Jsjdjs
"Welcome! Take your time!" Rosie says cheerily,  unaware of Dracos near breakdown. Mrs. Jones storms off but Draco can't take his eyes off of their new customer, who is similarly doing a fish impression right at the entrance.
Harry’s heart drops for the second time and he holds Draco a little bit tighter, realizing that he almost didn’t come to see Draco. He can’t imagine what he would’ve done if they had lost Draco again. He doesn’t want to think about it.
“I’ve become to accustomed to seeing you in the morning, I almost couldn’t survive the day,” Theo says dramatically, and Harry rolls his eyes.
Scorp sniffles, he had stopped crying as they made the fort, but his sniffles weren’t stopping, “like a dragon steals them?” He says, and Harry honestly has no idea where his obsession with dragons recently had come from. He thinks of asking Ron, but that might be the wrong Weasley.
They drank their polyjuice potion, and waited for them to take affect. Ron went with a tall man with brown hair, Hermione changed into a short blonde girl, and Harry turned into man with curly hair, dyed red. The three of them had gotten pretty accustomed to drinking polyjuice, for a long time and still occasionally they went out polyjuiced to avoid the media and fans that would swarm them. Harry thought that the fame would've faded away by now, but then again he was famous for the first 11 years of his life without even knowing it.
"That's good, he's not dead, trapped somewhere or run away from us. We can't make drastic moves, if he has forgotten we still don't know why, how, or who would do that to him," Ron says, before Harry can do something crazy like apparate straight there.
Ron had set up a last minute portkey the day previous, that would place them directly outside the town. There was a ten minute walk from where they landed to the library that Draco worked at, and as they walked they went over their admittedly weak plan again. Once they made it to the door, all three of them paused. Hermione sighed and walked in. Ron shrugged and followed after her.
"You're sure it was him?" Harry asks, desperate. He has deep eye bags and hasn't even tried to control his wild hair in months. He's not eating as much, and he barely even paints anymore. It's been four months, even the media had lost interest two months ago (he'd never forget Harry's reaction to the first headline the Prophet had put out when news got around that Draco was missing,
The two men shake their heads no, but the blonde girl smiles and says, "yes, actually. Can you show me the non fiction sections?" She asks, and Rosie internally rolls her eyes. There are signs for a reason.
not to visit Draco again?” Ron says, tone hopeful. He reaches across the table to grab the coffee and stands up, stretching.
Harry doesn’t seem hurt by his words this time, in fact Draco notices him smiling as if this is the best thing he’s ever been told, “list one,” he says, and Draco frowns.
“Um,” Harry hesitated, the silence just long enough for Draco to assume the worst. Once he continued, he sounded confused. “Er, no. They’re fine; mum and baby both. It’s just, Ron didn’t want to leave them, and—”
— indulged him. At Harry’s plea, he entered him, pressing the tip of his tongue inside Harry’s body over and over and over again until Harry shamelessly begged for more.
I will take care of it, I promise. I wouldn’t want to overstay my welcome here, no matter what Molly says. And auror training starts in mid-August anyway, so I figured that’d be as good a time as any to leave for Grimmauld Place. (Even if I don’t look forward to it, like, at all.) But you’re taking the piss, right? You talk about that house as if it were a sentient being or something. You’re seriously expecting me to believe that crap? No, I’m quite sure you just want me to make a fool of myself so you can have a laugh at my expense later, aren’t you? What were you envisioning, really? Me walking around the place trying to talk to it? Maybe caress its walls? Embrace the stair railings? Fondle the doorknobs? Really fucking hilarious, Malfoy. You twat.
Thanks for telling me Andromeda wrote her sister back. When I left her place that weekend, she still hadn’t decided if she would or not. After all, it was the first she’d heard from Narcissa since their parents shunned her, so I totally get if she was feeling wary about accepting the invitation to reconnect. Glad she did, though. I’d like to think the knowledge of you and me having been in touch this entire time encouraged her. Yeah, she knows too. As if I could keep it from her after asking her to play me your
I guess I shouldn’t be mad at you for assuming I would get back together with Ginny, though. Everybody seems to have expected I should. But I haven’t. At least, not yet. Ron still thinks it’d be a great idea, and maybe it would. I mean, we’re practically family already, and unlike most other girls, she knows the real me, the real Harry.
“Because I suck at it. Snape was supposed to teach me in fifth year, but I never got the hang of it. Maybe he never really tried. I don't know.”
Draco arched an eyebrow. “Aren’t you afraid someone might see you following me to my quarters? They might draw the wrong conclusions.”
Finally Draco emerged from the classroom and Harry had to trample down a sudden burst of jealousy when he saw Pansy Parkinson on his arm. This was stupid, he told himself. He couldn't expect the blond to break up with his girlfriend because someone had forced that stupid bond onto them.
Just as they reached the bottom of the stairs, the front-doors flew open and even more gigantic spiders forced their way in. The fighters scattered and started shooting spells at the Acromantulas instead. Harry's eyes widened in horror when Hagrid suddenly appeared, waving his pink umbrella and running right into the midst of the giant spiders, trying to protect the monsters.
But Harry didn't want to give up so quickly and neither did Draco. After some discussion they agreed to give it one last try on the weekend. So when Hermione, Ron and Blaise made their way to Hogsmeade for extra Apparition lessons (since they would be old enough to take the test in April), the two boys went up to the seventh floor.
“Alert professor McGonagall if anything strange happens.” Hermione cautioned, before following Luna and Blaise.
“Sorry. I should have told you that he knows about us. He claims he knew before we did. And he's totally okay with it. I just didn't think he'd do something like that.” Though, knowing his godfather he should probably have seen it coming. He couldn't help but wonder if Remus had been in on the plan. Had the werewolf distracted him on purpose, so Sirius could talk to Draco?
Harry had a few more nightmares about Rookwood and was grateful that Draco was there to comfort him after. The blond had admitted in a quiet voice that Rookwood had loved to stare at him and taunt him, calling him weak and pathetic and threatening him with nasty curses. It had been unnerving, even if he'd never actually dared to hurt Draco. The blond had his fair share of nightmares as well, so there were just as many nights where it was Harry's turn to offer comfort.
Remus was standing at his side. Both men looked battered. They had various cuts and scratches, but from what Draco could see no heavy injuries.
“Yes. No. It’s … he shouldn’t have done that. And I’m still angry at him, too. But it doesn’t mean that everything he did was bad.”
“But it could still be the cloak from the story.” Ron insisted. “That would mean the cloak and the wand are real…”
Draco shrugged. “It's okay. I think Pomfrey gave me a sleeping draught.” He suddenly had trouble keeping his eyes open.
To be fair, Millicent and Neville were just as bad. They kept skirting around each other, meeting in the library to study together, but refusing to take things further. Millie, who usually reminded Harry of a fearless Amazon, with her tall, muscular stature and her death glares that could frighten any guy, suddenly turned into a blushing little girl when confronted with Neville. And the Gryffindor, for all that he'd grown up during the last couple of years, reverted back to his bumbling, first-year persona whenever she looked at him.
Harry and Ron looked shocked, while Hermione couldn't refrain from saying: “I told you so.”, before launching into a tirade about the previous owner.
“Us?” Oh Merlin, was Harry under the impression that Ron and her would move into that dreadful old house with him? Whatever had given him that idea? And how was she supposed to tell him that they wouldn’t move in with him, without setting off his errant magic?
"Good, because I don't either." the blond admitted with a smile. "And now come on. We shouldn't keep Snape waiting."
“Mundungus Fletcher.” the elf croaked suddenly, his eyes still tightly shut. “Fletcher stole it all. Miss Bella and Miss Cissy’s pictures, my mistress’s gloves, the goblets with the family crest and … and … and the locket! Master Regulus’s locket. Kreacher did wrong. Kreacher failed his orders!”
Draco was sitting in the bed next to his. He looked shaken up and very pale, the dark circles beneath his eyes more prominent than ever. Snape was standing next to his bed, his arms crossed over his chest, scowling at nothing in particular. Madam Pomfrey was nowhere to be seen. McGonagall cleared her throat, drawing everyone's attention.
“True. But I think I'll stay out of this one. It's much more fun to watch your mounting frustration while she plays cock-block without even realizing.” Blaise said with a chuckle.
Malfoy didn't look happy with his answer, but Harry cut off his next words by suggesting they get some sleep. He felt like he also hadn't really slept in days.
“Yes, he was. And Lily was hurt. She didn’t talk to Snape again. But she still didn’t stop admonishing you when you played pranks on him.”
An eerie silence descended upon the hall. Every head turned and everyone seemed to stare at Harry. Until Pansy Parkinson rose from the Slytherin table and pointed a shaky hand at him.
It had taken him so long to realize what he was feeling. And now it was too late. He had gotten Harry only to lose him again. He collapsed down next to the cot, fresh tears leaking down his cheeks.
There was a thump from somewhere inside, accompanied by laughter. She frowned, wondering if it would be better to come back later, but then Harry’s voice called out: “Come in!”
Harry was glad that he had agreed to visit Hagrid with Ron and Hermione. He hated not talking to the half-giant and was relieved that they had managed to make up. But he still would have liked to watch the Slytherin try-outs and offer some moral support. Therefore he hurried to catch up to Draco after lunch. They headed outside with Ron, Hermione and Millicent, who by now had become a member of their group. Harry found that he liked the quiet girl.
When Draco slowed down a little he chanced a glance over his shoulder. Unfortunately the blond choose exactly that moment to skid to a halt. Harry noticed too late, crashed into him and sent them both toppling down the slope in a tangle of limbs.
“I've got to head down to the dungeons. I'm still a prefect and I won't give Snape any opportunity to change that.” the blond muttered, though he made no move to leave.
“I'm totally fine with you two dating.” Harry assured. “As long as you don't start snogging in my bed that is.”
“That’s great. Let me know if Ron and I can do something to help, too. You know you can always count on us.”
Harry grinned. “I felt safe.” he whispered then. “Sort of… like you were holding me. Protecting me.”
When he left it again a while later, his good mood had evaporated. He hurried to the library, where Draco, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Millicent, Blaise and Neville were waiting for him. They really were an odd group, he had to admit. But he was glad for his odd group of friends nonetheless. And somehow being able to share his thoughts with all of them made it easier for him. Even if he had to lie to Dumbledore about it.
He was so lost in thought that he didn't notice the portrait of the fat lady swinging open, until a wailing Lavender came barrelling towards him and nearly knocked him over. Harry grabbed the wall for support and shook his head in disbelief when the girl didn't even pause, but instead ran down the corridor and out of sight. He took another step towards the portrait hole and managed to jump out of the way just in time to avoid being run over by Parvati, who was quickly rushing after her friend.
The elf vanished with another loud crack. For a long moment no-one spoke. Draco just stared at the package in his hands, wondering if his mother was okay. She was playing a very dangerous game and he couldn’t help but worry for her safety.
During lunch the blond recounted the details of his duel with Nott to Millie and Blaise. Word of the fight had already gotten around and many people were whispering and casting him curious looks. Nott was once again suspiciously absent. Already back in the room of requirement, Draco suspected.
“I guess he wouldn't show it to everyone. But if he thinks it might get him allies... And in Slytherin it just might.” Draco mused.
He stepped aside and they noticed a pensieve on his desk. Snape was holding a flask that contained what appeared to be silvery vapour. "I don't much like doing this, I must admit. But to fully understand, you need to know everything. I only ask you to watch and try not to judge too harshly." That said he poured the silvery substance into the pensieve.
“You said the wolf and the mutt are alerting McGonagall. I take it you’re planning to secure the castle to keep the dark lord out as long as possible?”
Harry thought he might even be right about that. Mrs. Weasley didn’t have a very high opinion of his godfather. And Sirius, who was endlessly amused by this, didn't exactly do much to change that.
Harry didn’t know what to say. He continued to leaf through the pages. There were more pictures of Sirius as a boy, some with his brother and also two family portraits. The pictures continued seemingly all through his years at Hogwarts and even a bit beyond that. There were also photos of Sirius and James Potter with the Gryffindor Quidditch team and what looked like a few newspaper clippings.
Somewhat reassured Harry allowed Draco to steer him up the stairs. There were people here, too. Mostly students, clad in pyjamas and dressing gowns, huddled together in small groups. They were whispering with each other and staring at Harry, but he was too exhausted to care right now.
“No, we're both naked and actually just about to shag.” Draco claimed and snickered when Ron yelped and jumped back like he'd been hit by a stinging hex.
Longbottom had pulled something silver and gleaming out of the burning object and charged at the surprised Death Eaters. And without thinking about it, Draco uttered a war cry and charged as well. Like a flood the other fighters of Hogwarts followed his lead.
After what felt like hours, but couldn't have been more than a few minutes, Madam Pomfrey finally came out.
They had used Muggle techniques to disguise themselves, hoping that those wouldn't be detected. Remus had dyed his hair grey and was sporting a long beard, which hid half of his face. Sirius was wearing a blond wig, a couple of fake piercings, large, dark-rimmed glasses and a pair of ripped jeans, which he'd found at the back of his wardrobe. He'd bragged for a whole of ten minutes about the fact that they still fit.
“That's true.” Hermione grudgingly agreed. “Mr. Lovegood claimed that those three items – the elder wand, the resurrection stone and the invisibility cloak, the Deathly Hallows as he called them -  really exist and that whoever possessed them would be invincible.” she rolled her eyes. “Like I said, just a load of rubbish. I think he mostly wanted to keep us occupied. Because as it turned out, he had alerted the Death Eaters to our presence.”
“Do you think I don't remember that, you imbecile?!” she screeched. “I thought you would have taken them off, before allowing me to step inside. I clearly need to teach you how to do your job properly!”
“I panicked a bit.” Hermione said sheepishly. “Instead of apparating us here like planned, I took us to Tottenham Court Road. It was the first thing I could think of. And then we had to find a quiet place to disapparate again, since there were a few Muggles around.”
Draco turned to face him and had to fight a smile. Harry’s hair was sticking up in weird angles and he was blushing profusely, looking anywhere but at the blond.
Since they couldn’t solve this riddle either, Harry and Draco told the other two about the locket. As predicted, Hermione was mostly concerned about poor Kreacher and warned Harry to treat him right. Ron on the other hand cheered at the fact that they had obviously discovered the next Horcrux.
Harry grinned at the memory, before going back to opening presents. His pile seemed to grow with each year. Even Millicent had gotten him something and he was glad that he'd remembered to send her that Herbology book Hermione had suggested. A startled exclamation made him look over at his boyfriend again.
Malfoy looked so worn out and tired lately. He was even paler than usual and there were dark circles beneath his eyes. The younger boy had noticed that he couldn't concentrate properly in class. Soon his concentration would lessen even more and he would slip. He would break his pattern. Harry was sure of it.
September went by in a blur of lessons, homework, study sessions in the library and stolen kisses in deserted hallways or empty classrooms. Pansy had taken Draco's threat seriously and stopped bothering him. Nott and his cronies were still mostly ignoring him, aside from a few jibes here and there and Draco almost found himself relaxing. Even if Blaise cautioned time and time again that Nott might be plotting something against him. To him it looked like Theo was busy enough with whatever task Voldemort had set him. He seemed exhausted and stressed out and was likely to snap at anyone who dared to talk to him.
“Yeah, it was always complicated with Albus. I knew my brother. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee. Secrets and lies… that’s how we grew up. And Albus was a natural…” The old man’s eyes travelled to a portrait of a girl over the mantlepiece.  It was the only picture in the room. “Forget my brother and his clever schemes. People had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans.”
Facing the inevitable, the blond finally grabbed his broom and followed Millicent out to the pitch. At least he would be meeting Harry at the room of requirement after practice. Maybe his boyfriend could warm him up again. The thought made him blush and Millie laughed at him, wanting to know what he was thinking of.
The red-head shuffled closer again, peeking through the curtains cautiously. He looked visibly relieved when he found them both dressed and turned to scowl at the Slytherin.
Another shrug had Sirius sighing in frustration. “You know, I can be a stubborn bastard, too. More stubborn than you I’ll bet. So why don’t you save us both some time and tell me what’s wrong already? Otherwise we’ll be sitting here until dinner.” he threatened. “You had a fight with Draco, I take it? Another fight, I should probably say.”
Draco looked at him and finally nodded. Wiping the tears off his face he stumbled to his feet. Yes, he would fight. He would be brave one last time. For Harry. There was still a snake that needed to be killed. Snape was right. Harry would not have died in vain.
“But I actually like Dobby.” Harry protested. “I have no idea how I feel about Kreacher now. I mean, I sort of pity him, after what he told us today. But then he goes and calls Hermione mudblood and stuff like that and I get why Sirius doesn’t like him.”
“Can’t have been. We would have found it earlier.” Sirius reasoned. “Moony and I did a rough sweep of the grounds before we moved in.”
Left alone with his thoughts he could do nothing but wait. Surely they had alerted Voldemort to his capture. Soon he would be here and then … Harry would be dead. Everything would be lost. And it was his fault. All his fault. Because he had been stupid. So incredibly stupid. He should have listened to Hermione.
“You know, for someone who was almost sorted into Slytherin, you sure still have a lot of prejudice against my house.”
And suddenly the younger boy realized that it was his first time as well. No matter how confident he'd been acting. He was just as inexperienced as Harry was. And he realized something else. Malfoy had asked for permission. If he said no, the blond wouldn't go further. Strangely enough, the thought of saying no didn't even occur to him. It felt strangely right. Despite their past. Or maybe because of it. Maybe they had always been destined to end up here. Together.
Today he had allowed Ron and Hermione to drag him off to Hogsmeade. They were really trying to act normal, but he still felt awkward walking next to them while they held hands and swapped heated glances. Which was why he'd told them to go on without him.
Hermione gave him a curious look. “No, he didn't. Out of the whole lot, he's the most responsible one. He would never apparate drunk. You know that. Well, Neville wouldn't either. But it was his stag night, so... Why are you asking?”
“We went to get something that will help us defeat Voldemort.” Harry let her know, before talking about the cave and the potion Dumbledore had drunk, the lake and the Inferi and making their way back to find the Dark Mark hovering in the sky above Hogwarts. “And then Snape... and Nott ... killed him.” he ended his tale.
“No, I don't think so. Thank you for your time, Mr. Potter. Go get some rest now. And you too, Mr. Malfoy.”
Before she could come up with a suitable reply, the door flew open and Lavender barged into the room. So Neville hadn’t been kidding about that. Harry and Malfoy didn’t seem at all bothered by her unexpected entry.
Each word was punctuated by a slash of her wrist, as she sent curses flying at her husband. Lucius stumbled back, too shocked to properly defend himself. He brought up a shield charm, but Narcissa’s curse sliced right through it and hit him full on. He was flung back against the wall, where he crumbled and lay motionless.
“I don’t remember.” Harry admitted. “I only remember pain and panic and … I could feel him in my head. It was … bad. It’s never been that bad.” He shuddered at the memory.
“Please, have a seat boys. You must be wondering why I asked you here today.” Dumbledore spoke up again.
Draco flopped down on the couch with a sigh, glad that the Slytherin common room was mostly deserted this late. Seconds later Pansy was there, curling against his side.
They were joined by Hermione, who looked very pretty in her floaty, lilac-coloured dress and smiled at the compliment Ron paid her.
Sirius looked slightly taken aback by this, but he recovered quickly. "Okay. And I suppose you can tell me where we are supposed to intercept her."
“Harry! Gonna...” was all he managed, before his orgasm ripped through him, leaving him weak in the knees. He slumped further back against the shelf, unable to stay upright on his own.
“Harry, how nice of you to stop by. Teddy is asleep, so why don't you come to the living room with me? I have visitors, I hope you don't mind. But there's actually something I needed to tell you.”
They landed in a small park on a rocky cliff-side. The setting sun was casting eerie shadows across the path and the sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs felt deafening after the long silence down in the dark cells. Mipsy was handing a rucksack and some other things to Draco. Harry only now noticed that the blond already had a rucksack slung over one shoulder.
It was impossible. Nobody had ever known. And yet... could the boy know of the others? The diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What of the others? Did the boy know? Had Dumbledore found out? He must know. He must be sure...
“Yes. You don't have to stop trusting him. Just don't trust him blindly. And if he does something that bothers you, you discuss it with me. Or with Sirius. Okay?”
Draco looked up at Potter's words. The other boy seemed nervous all of a sudden. "I thought we could.. umm… go together? Only if you want, that is. I don't know if you've got plans already or…"
Draco rolled his eyes and finished getting ready while Harry continued to fidget beside him. When they left their room he studiously ignored the blond, staring straight ahead. As soon as they reached the great hall he headed for the Gryffindor table, taking a seat between Neville and Lavender and starting a heated discussion with them.
So he followed Sirius and Tonks to the floo, with Andromeda's words ringing in his head: “You're the level-headed one, Remus." she had said. "The smart one. Make sure you all come back in one piece.”
“Yes, since Christmas eve was yesterday, we're having Christmas lunch today, Harry.” the red-head explained slowly, like talking to a child and then broke into laughter again at the glare the dark-haired boy sent him.
In the end Harry asked Luna to go to the party with him. Just as friends, he felt the need to clarify. Luna smiled that serene smile of hers and assured him:
Draco woke up to find Harry staring at him. When the Gryffindor realized that he'd been caught he blushed profusely and quickly looked away. Draco rolled his eyes. This was getting ridiculous. He sat up and wondered if he should address the matter. Again.
“Good day, little cousin.” the animagus said cheerfully, trying to ruffle his hair in passing and laughing when the blond ducked out of the way. Draco shook his head and sat down next to Harry.
The dark-haired boy rolled his eyes. There was a reason why neither of them had read the Daily Prophet over the summer. Hermione still did however and she had told them the gist of it.
“Not quite as stupid as I thought. Good to know.” he murmured, before turning away abruptly. He started pacing in front of the wall, until a door appeared.
“Come on, Moony. The poor boy is going stir-crazy. And it’s only Grimmauld Place. It’s not that dangerous.”
Plan formed, he jumped to his feet, startling Draco. "I need to check something. I'll be right back, okay? Will you wait here?"
He looked good when he smiled, Harry decided. More human and approachable and … really kind of beautiful. He scooted closer to the blond without thinking. Only to have Draco pull away yet again.
“Finally!” Draco exclaimed. They all turned to look at him, so he shrugged. “What? It's about time, isn't it? They were really starting to grate on my nerves.”
Truth be told, she was still a bit surprised about Harry’s relationship with Malfoy. She usually prided herself on being very observant, but she hadn’t seen this one coming at all. And after all of the bad things he’d done, the insults and jibes, she still had a hard time trusting Malfoy.
“It’s tradition to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age. Usually the parents chose it. But since James and Lily can’t be here...” he trailed off a little awkwardly and Harry got up to give him a hug, trying to convey without words what the gift meant to him. He remembered how emotional Draco had gotten at his own birthday, when Andromeda had delivered the watch his mother had picked for him. Now he understood his boyfriend’s reaction.
His stomach rumbled and he looked at the door longingly. Why the hell had he closed it after stepping out into the back garden? How could he have been stupid enough to lock himself out of his own home?
The kiss grew even more heated and seemed to go on forever. Harry felt breathless when Malfoy's lips left his to trail over his jaw and up to his ear.
“Maybe I need to get out of here for a while, take a vacation. I’ve never been to America. Maybe that’s what I need? Because I need to find a way to forget him again, or this might destroy me.”
“Me neither,” Draco murmured a few steps further up, his eyes dark and dazed as he captured Harry’s lips in a bruising kiss.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Sirius who refused to look his way, instead finding something on the back of Harry’s jacket to brush off with rapt attention.
Harry groaned. He really shouldn’t complain. He’d spent the entire day with the extended Weasley family —
The only thing he remembered. Harry didn’t know what the man looked like, but he knew he’d felt safe and cared for, and as though he’d be willing to die for this person. But then, it was only a dream.
“I do, actually,” Harry said softly, his voice kinder now as it reached out to Draco in the dark. “But you’re not alone; you have Charlie.”
“Draco?” Barely more than a whisper, low and husky, and utterly delicious. Draco’s fists tightened around the bunched-up sheets on either side of his head, clutching the soft cotton for dear life. “Are you—”
I sync my movements with his, carving out a bite of my granita and lifting it to my mouth as he does the same. I pause, though, spoon still waiting in front of my mouth as Harry’s lips close around his, and I stifle a groan as I watch his features turn into an image of pure bliss.
“Harry?” Ginny asked, her voice laced with amused accusation. “Please tell me you’re not doing this again.”
The fox yipped, then puffed up his tail and followed the branch that extended across the room to the window perch where he often liked to sleep.
“Mum, don’t smother him. He’s injured,” Bill admonished, putting his arm around Fleur. Memories of reading about their marriage in
Because they’re both blue. Of course, they are. One light as the sky on a clear summer day, the other rich like precious sapphires gleaming in the light of numerous chandeliers.
“If he had to prove it, he would. Wouldn’t you, Draco dear?” Molly patted Draco on the hand. “You must forgive him, Draco. He’s just a suspicious sort sometimes.” She leaned over with a conspiratorial whisper. “All that business with You-Know-Who.”
Draco shook off the nagging feeling and grabbed his tongs to transfer a cauldron cake — another one of his wizarding additions to the classical coffeeshop assortment — from the glass display case to a waiting plate. As he did, he took a mental note of soon having to restock the House cheesecakes. Again. He wasn’t even sure Greg had more of all four flavours ready in the back yet, but he sure hoped so. The cakes had been far more popular than any one of them had expected, but that’s house pride for you. Anything claiming to be connected to any of the Hogwarts Houses always seemed to bring it out in people, no matter their allegiances.
“Thank you,” Draco said as Harry handed him a pair of light grey joggers and a neutral navy tee Harry wore rarely enough for Teddy not to recognise. He rose from the bed and got dressed while Harry went through their discarded clothing in search of his missing glasses.
“I…” Draco swallowed. “I really don’t think…” Words left him as Potter’s thumbs started rubbing small circles at the nape of his neck.
With a determination he didn’t feel, Draco steeled himself for the worst, summoned his resolve, and lifted his head to meet Potter’s gaze in the mirror.
“Lumos.” The coin gleamed brightly in the dim light from his wand tip, the sight making him smile. “There you are.”
“Er, thank you, Slyvia.” Draco was taken aback, suddenly realising that he probably could consider Slyvia not only a neighbour but a friend. Huh. That thought would take some getting used to. And perhaps it was all the extra Weasley-ness that had rubbed off on him lately, but he stepped forward and put his arms around her, giving her a hug. “Really, thank you. I hope you’re happy, too.” He stepped back. “Happy New Year.”
One year. Can you believe it? It’s weird, sometimes it feels as if it all happened ages ago, to entirely different people in an entirely different lifetime. Other days, it still feels like that night was just yesterday, not only mentally, but physically too. Some days, my body still feels just as exhausted as it did just after it was all over, when the relief finally settled in and let me relax for the first time in what felt like forever. Those days, I wonder if I’ll ever be able to fully recover from the war.
"Do it," Harry growled, suddenly craving the pleasure he knew Draco's touch on his mark would bring. "Please," he added more quietly, and it almost sounded like he was begging. Hell, maybe he was.
This was probably when Draco should have reminded her of the proper way to address one’s boss here in the UK. (She had moved in with her sister and Bill to learn about British culture and customs, after all.) However, as it was, he could but blink at her, amazed by her audacity as she continued unperturbed.
“So, if we’re going to get married, I guess I better introduce myself properly,” Draco started, his voice quiet. “I’m Draco Malfoy, the boy who learnt to hate your family before he even met any one of you; the man who later grew to admire you and has been pining for you ever since.” He sighed and dropped his head into his hands. “I’m sorry, by the way. For everything. For how I’ve treated your family over the years. For the war, for my family’s role in it. Just…everything. I wish I could say I’m a completely different person now, but I doubt it’s true.”
“Well, now you do just what you’ve been doing this far. Have dinner with the family, check in on Charlie, and generally divert attention away from his overall reckless behaviour of battling dragons.” Sirius winked, finished his tea and stood. “Listen, I’ve gotta go, but just trust me, okay?”
“I do not!” Draco huffed into the empty room before he could stop himself. Oh, great. Because talking to oneself has always been such a tell-tale sign of sanity. The phone buzzed again, its vibrations bone-deep as they travelled up Draco’s arm. Cursing his jittery nerves, Draco pressed a palm to his chest and took a deep, calming breath before accepting the call. “Hel—”
PPS I hope the Ministry owl doesn’t call too much attention to itself when it arrives to fetch your letter later today. (Because it should be clever enough not to fly up to Scotland, right?) I’m not sure I’m up for the Weasley Inquisition Squad to pounce on me today.
Harry rolled his eyes. “What, do you think I’m stupid? You’re the most opinionated man I’ve ever met. It would’ve been foolish of me, trying to pick out a ring without you.”
Now it’s Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “I was never your saint, Draco,” he says, pinching that sensitive nipple again for emphasis. Draco instinctively bucks against him, arching his back to meet Harry’s touch. So beautifully responsive.
Harry stepped in, looking around the flat in curiosity. “Nice place. Very posh, sure, but not what I expected.”
PS I called him Tom Riddle, as this was his real name before he came up with that pretentious moniker he liked to intimidate people with.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry whispers, pulling him in for a hug. Draco doesn’t resist, all the emotions he’s been feeling since he woke up in Harry’s-
"Daddy, the food got done cooking. We should eat and wait for papa to get back from work," Scorpius said, putting his hands on either side of Harry's face, squishing his cheeks together.
When he gets there, the library is completely deserted aside from Draco, who seems to be looking stuff up on the computer. He glances up at Harry, who glamoured himself as the same red head as always. Draco nods to him as a hello and continues what he’s doing.
Where on earth could Draco have gone? Without telling anyone? Was he kidnapped, or worse, murdered? Harry's head was spinning. Draco could be anywhere, with anyone.
“Sounds good to me, I’ll talk to you again,” he puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder as he passes, “and you can
“Scorpius, his name is Scorpius. We usually call him Scorp… It was your idea, his name,” Harry responds, using the same gentle tone he used earlier. Draco nods.
,” he hears Ron groan, and he pauses just as he’s about to insult Harry again. Flirting? As if, Harry is being an idiot and twisting his words. He wonders what has happened to the three of them that they all think this is perfectly normal. This strange idea that he and Harry are married that they all have does explain why Hermione hugged him upon meeting, but now he has to find a way out of this situation before it gets impossible. He entertains the thought that maybe Harry is under some love potion, but he hasn’t tried to… kiss Draco or anything, isn't waxing poetic, he’s just stating that the two of them are impossibly married. Plus, that doesn’t explain why Ron and Hermione are in on it. Come to think of it, Neville said something about Harry missing him didn’t he? Something sinister is going on here, Draco is sure of it.
"He doesn't remember?" Harry whispers, running his fingers through his wild hair and letting out a disbelieving breath.
Harry resolved to bring that up the first time he saw Draco next, and began working. After a while his customers did start trickling in, and he  was lost in work.
"Sorry. I'm fine, really. Continue looking around," Draco says before shrugging the hand off. He quickly walks back to the counter, deciding that the re-shelving can be done when his head isn't pounding.
Sorry it took so long, I got a little busy! This is the last chapter I had fully written, so updates will take a bit longer. I honestly wanted to rewrite this chapter because I’m not satisfied with it but I knew if I did that it would take forever. I think the next chapter is definitely looking better :>
Despite himself, Harry laughed. He hugged Scorpius tight, picked him up, and walked over to the kitchen.
"So we just go in, act natural, Hermione will do her best to find out information on his memory loss, and then we leave, okay?" Ron explained, tone authoritative.
"Honestly, the only reason we haven't chased Spencer out of the whole town is he's my cousin, and his parents own this place. Makes him think he can get whatever he wants, Draco included," Rosie sighs as she speaks, and she glances at Draco before turning back to Harry, curious about what his response will be.
When Harry gets home with Scorpius, they both go into the kitchen, Harry to start dinner, and Scorp to write his daily letter. It had taken a week or two for Harry to resume cooking, the two of them had relied on ordered food or whatever the family brought over. They had been visiting a lot more recently, especially Ron, Hermione, and their kids Rose and Hugo. Scorpius had been curious at first but he likes spending time with his friends so he didn't much care for the reason.
"I'm absolutely sure, his coworker even referred to him as Draco. He seemed friendly with her, he referred to her as Rosie," Neville explains, and Ron leans forward in his seat, being the only auror in the room means it's important for him to know all the details.
The man leaves soon after, almost bumping right into Harry as he leaves. Harry watches as Draco turns around and Rosie chucks her coffee into the garbage. He makes eye contact with Draco and suddenly he can't breath. Draco stares at him for a second, eyebrows raised, before he quickly turns around to go help a customer.
, I can't stay long, have an appointment to get to," Theo said, putting his hand on Harry's shoulder as he passed by. Draco definitely glared at that. Harry didn't seem to notice, he simply waved goodbye to his "friend" and put the bag and coffee down on his table.
Harry doesn’t drink the coffee, but he keeps it with him for the whole time he’s there, even when Spencer comes in again to bother Draco. He’s only shown up one other time Harry’s been there, and he had been put off by Harry hanging around with Draco. He didn’t say anything about it but Harry felt smug that Draco didn’t hide from
"I've got to go... restock some shelves or something, find your books and leave as fast as you can," Draco says, crossing his arms and walking away. He cringes when he hears Rosie's shout of "that's no way to talk to customers, Draco!"
“Are you- are you sure?” Harry asks, deciding denial is as good a place as any to live. Theres no fucking way a stunned, unconscious wizard managed to escape a group of trained aurors. Harry won't believe it.
job. It makes something in Harry flutter, but it also makes him feel vaguely like he has to run and get out of there before he does anything stupid.
"Draco I seriously think if we had coffee some time-" Spencer started, but Draco quickly side stepped him and then promptly ran head first into one of the new customers.
The air was cold and crisp, nipping at Harry’s cheeks as he strolled across the snow-covered lawn with a grumbling Malfoy by his side. The others were already approaching the top of the hill, a vibrant splash of colour against the glittering white backdrop.
The dress in question was a black, slinky number that hugged her curves but still looked classy. It was sparkly but didn’t appear to be overly formal.
“So, you’ve had a busy week,” Harry finally said as they stepped out the front doors of the hospital onto the cold, London street.
Fleur leaned back on her hands. “That’s normal. There are a lot of people in this world. The odds of hitting upon the one person meant for you on the first try are pretty high, yes?”
When Harry wakes up after Merlin knows how long, his head is cushioned on something soft and the sweet scent of caramel and orange fills his nostrils as he takes in a deep breath.
Harry can’t help it; his eyes roll of their own accord. They’ve just completed their first ‘inspirational workshop’, a round of indoor mini-golf — a concept Harry wasn’t even aware existed but had ended up enjoying quite a lot — and now the time has apparently come for today’s introductory ‘mini-seminar’.
His trunk was already packed, filled to the brim with his new school robes and textbooks and clothes and as many sweets as he’d been able to sneak out of the pantry without getting caught. He still hadn’t decided whether he should dare to bring Fayette along too. Father had said big boys don’t sleep with plush animals, and Draco really didn’t want to have anyone making fun of him over his ragged green dragon that had surely seen better days, but…
“Why not? We’re friends, aren’t we?” Draco nudges Harry’s shoulder with a loose fist, letting his arm stay on top of the couch’s backrest afterwards. The act leaves his fingertips close enough to graze Harry’s arm through the thin fabric of his t-shirt. Harry tries hard not to notice the subtle touch, but unfortunately, it’s an impossible feat. “Come on, Harry. Who is it?”
. Only a reckless Gryffindor would ever consider drinking on the job when your closest colleagues are seriously dangerous beasts like Daenerys. Draco wanted to smack him over the head and tell him he’d been an irresponsible twat, but he figured it wasn’t his place. Even if their engagement hadn’t been fake, Charlie was a grown man and responsible for his own actions.
willingly; just a lick of tongue across those perfect lips and Harry is invited in, allowed to explore, to taste, to devour. Harry’s every nerve-ending is on fire, revelling in the touch of Draco’s roaming hands, hot and strong and eager over the thin cotton of Harry’s t-shirt. With Harry’s both feet still on the floor, the angle is far from great, so when Draco’s hand presses against Harry’s lower back he takes it as a sign to move closer.
“I was born ready.” Draco grinned, causing Harry’s heart to skip a beat. Seriously. If Draco kept throwing him that smile without warning, Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it would, one day, stop his heart altogether. “You haven’t seen me in the costume yet, but once you do, I’m sure you’ll agree.”
“Okay?” Draco said slowly, trying hard not to let his eyes linger for too long on Harry’s muscular arms, exposed under the short sleeves of his tight-fitting t-shirt. “So, um, what can I do to help? Quiz you? Where’s your textbook?”
“Do you have to bring that animal with you all the time?” Pansy asked, drawing Draco’s attention out from the mountains of boxes around him.
Malfoy snorts, amusement dancing in his eyes. “No, thanks. It’s really not that big a deal; I’ve survived worse. Now, stop distracting me and watch as I show you how to shoot the perfect strike.”
“Hey, wait,” Harry called out, catching up, his breathing steady despite the run with the heavy box. “So where are we going?”
“Oh.” She looked down at his book, then back up, meeting his eyes with a wrinkled brow. “Er, I thought you were doing your whole Malfoy-thing again. Ron said you’ve been muttering about him in your sleep, and that you’re arguing about it with Orion.”
Teddy’s earnest voice filtered through Harry’s thoughts and before he knew it, Harry found himself moving towards the overheard conversation, caught halfway between mortification and curiosity.
Draco didn’t dare move. It couldn’t be Dobby or any of the other elves, or he would’ve heard the crack of Apparition. And his parents never came into his room during the night, except when he was sick enough for them to worry about his health. (Something that hadn’t happened more than a handful of times in his life, as far as Draco could remember.) No, this was someone else.
Still panting, Harry accommodated Draco’s exploration by tilting his head to the side. “Then why…don’t you —
It's exhilarating, more so than flying on his broom. Like this, Harry is completely reliant on Draco, an exposed position he doesn't put himself in often, with anyone. He doesn't have to watch where they're going or pay attention to his height or speed. Instead, he can simply hold on to the man he loves and just
notice. I just don’t know how to do it. I’m not like you, who learned to perfect the patented Malfoy Mask of Indifference long before you even had anything to hide. Unlike you, I’ve always worn my heart on my sleeve, unable to hide anything from anyone, unable to compartmentalise my emotions the way a gifted Occlumens like you can.
Harry’s frown grew deeper, but he took it and turned it over in his hands. “A regular silver Sickle.”
Draco wasn’t sure whether to be amused or annoyed. He settled on exasperated. “I have it on good authority that you and your family hug people all the time. I wouldn’t be surprised if Molly even has a patent out on her style of hugs. So please explain to me why my neighbour — who is nearly twenty years my senior, if you hadn’t noticed — wishing me a happy new year and giving me a hug is suddenly suspect?”
PPS What’s wrong with Lucy? He’s a part of you, after all, and I thought it’d be fitting for him to be named after you. Would you prefer Snuffles? Paw McClaw? Fluffy Meowington?
Draco forced a grateful expression to his face and turned to Molly, patting her hand still wrapped loosely around his arm. “It’s fine, I can manage to make my way home. I was thinking about going for a walk anyway, just to clear my head.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’m sure they do, but you owe it to yourself to do what you love. And anyone with eyes could tell this is something you love.” Draco’s eyes were back on the sculpture now, defenceless against its allure.
Harry’s heart melts just a little at her offer, and his budding irritation evaporates in a flash. “No, thanks, I’m fine. Don’t want to risk it getting too hot for Orion. Now go back to sleep, ‘Mione. Sorry if I woke you.”
Draco let out a breath, cursing the twists of fate that had pulled him into this mess. Sitting up, he folded the blanket on the sofa and straightened his clothing, then turned, hoping to thank Molly and slip out before anybody else woke up. He gathered his things and cradled his new Weasley jumper in his arms. He really did love it.
Now, knowing what he did have to tell me, I almost wish he’d rather gone with any of your stupid suggestions. (But when did any of my wishes ever come true?) No, apparently he’s realised he doesn’t want to become an auror anymore. Apparently, he and George talked a lot over the hols and now Ron has decided to join his brother in the joke shop instead.
Harry can’t help smiling at that. “We’re not enemies anymore, though,” he murmurs. “Haven’t been for a long time.”
“Well, you know, just, because, uh…” Harry looked uncomfortable. “I know the Floo can be nauseating, like, it always makes Hermione nauseous these days and, ah… I just thought I’d help.”
Harry willed his eyes to leave Draco’s pert arse alone, but it was a losing battle. Gorgeous blokes shouldn’t be allowed to bend over like that. Especially not this one. And especially not in Harry’s office, for Circe’s sake. Even with the lab coat covering Draco’s snug trousers, Harry had no trouble imagining that delectable arse all too easily. And that was the real trouble, wasn’t it? Because imagining Draco’s naked arse was the last thing he ought to do. Not here. Not now. Not ever.
Cash changed hands and the elderly couple walked over to their table, leaving Draco to prepare their order in peace. The peace was only superficial, though. Inside, his mind was spinning with all the plausible outcomes of the upcoming evening. He was afraid to hope too much, all but certain he’d read too much into the happenings of the past few days. Yet, he couldn’t deny the spark that had taken root in his core, nor the way it flared hot and bright every time his phone buzzed with another text from the man who once was his enemy but now felt like anything but.
“You alright?” I say softly, barely loud enough to make a sound and still seemingly too loud in the silent room. Your arm is hot under my palm, your bicep tensing only for a fleeting moment before it relaxes again under my light touch.
bed — stripped down to his underwear, thanking the stars Harry wasn’t able to witness the pressing situation in his low-cut, snugger-than-usual, teal hip briefs. This was absolute torture, just lying here at Harry’s mercy, enduring the gentle touches of those smooth fingertips as they glided over his skin, tracing the length of his muscles one after the other, accompanied by the soft murmur of Harry’s voice as he repeated their Latin names to himself as he went.
Under his feet, the stairs are littered with small feathers blown down from above. He’s unable to make out their colours in the darkness, but they remind him of something—something important.
Happy birthday, Draco! I hope your 41st is celebrated properly with your near and dear ones. After all you've been through, you truly deserve it 💙
“So, how did you end up working at the Wheezes? I always thought you’d do something more…”— He looked for a word that wouldn’t come off as offensive, but drew a blank. —“well,
Draco glared at Pansy's expectant smirk. She sat on a table in the middle of the ballroom with her checklist and a quill, her legs crossed and her black hair tucked behind her ear. Clearly, her primary goal in life was to annoy Draco as much as she could. As if that were something new.
Draco looked at the clock. That gave him a little over an hour to finish the muffins he was making and get cleaned up. It would be tight, but he could manage. “That should be fine.”
Harry sat back and sipped his chocolate in silence, only listening with half an ear as Teddy told Draco about his day at the Burrow, about all the people, the delicious food, the many presents… Fortunately, Harry’s full attention wasn’t required for the sake of the conversation. He and Teddy had been together all day, he already knew the gist of the story. And it wasn’t like Teddy seemed to remember Harry was there beside him anyway, focused as he was on their unexpected guest.
“It’s a side effect of a public proposal, Potter. Not everything is about your fame, you idiot. And if you think I’m not aware of what your life is like, you’re daft. Now kiss me again before I have to go and finish this event. I think the price of your sculpture probably just doubled, and I’m going to have to go raise my bid.”
Harry closed the rest of the distance and crushed his mouth to Draco’s, his soft lips pressing and teasing and...well, Draco’s mind shut down.
Harry nods, willing to try anything as long as it means Draco keeps hitting that perfect spot inside him.
There aren’t many things he hates in his life these days, but clothes shopping is definitely one of them. And yet, here he is, closing in on three hours, obediently trying out outfit after outfit, garment after garment, turning this way and that, following Malfoy’s directions as the man hums and sighs, nods and frowns, all the while constantly bringing yet more items to the changing room. Harry is certain he must have tried on every single piece of menswear in Muggle London by now, and his only wish is for this to be over so he’ll never have to set foot in a clothing shop ever again.
Because you’re not really here, are you? Physically, yes, but not mentally. Not emotionally. I haven’t seen you in days, and now that you’re home, instead of watching the show with me like you used to, you’re on the phone. With
No, it wasn’t the young gorgeous Draco that Harry was used to, but it was still Draco, and if Harry had ever doubted whether this was true love or just a crush, he had his answer now. Because he yearned for Draco even now, old and wrinkled as he was. Not because he was attractive, but because he was
Orion butts his head into Harry's hand, urging him to move the petting to the ridge above his eyes. "
Yes, I’m here. Didn’t really know where else to go, to be honest, now that my Hogwarts days are officially over, so I let Ron and Hermione talk me into coming here with them. It’s actually not as bad as I remember it being over Christmas, even if Fred’s absence is still lurking in every other corner. I think it being summer helps, what with the weather allowing for being outside and all. Somehow, it’s easier not to be reminded that someone’s missing when the people who are left are all spread out in every direction. Easier to pretend he just popped inside for a minute instead of having left for good.
Harry tasted of wine and treacle tart, heady and sweet and utterly divine. Draco simply couldn’t get enough. He’d intended for their first kiss to be slow and tender, soft and promising. He should have known better. This was Harry, for Circe’s sake, Harry fucking Potter; nothing between them had ever been short of explosive.
He shook his head. “No, I don’t believe so.” His heartbeat quickened as his mind began to catch up with what had happened back at the Reserve. He looked around. “Charlie. Where is he? I need to see Charlie.”
“Do you need me to help instead of Ron?” Honestly, Harry could be quite daft sometimes. It was kind of interesting, actually, if Draco thought about it much. So he decided he wouldn’t.
“Anyhow,” he said, finally handing her what he hoped was the correct combination of coins, “I’m pleased to hear everyone’s business seems to be booming. I wouldn’t have wanted to be the only one banking a profit tonight,” he added with a wink. “Now, let me fix that pumpkin spice latte for you.”
This morning, though, one hadn’t been enough. Draco had been on his fifth even before the morning rush ebbed away, and the only reason he hadn’t suffered a major caffeine overdose yet was that the last hour’s never-ending line of customers had prevented him from tending to his own needs and cravings. It seemed like every person within a five-mile radius had suddenly decided to frequent Beans & Serendipitea this very afternoon, and Draco honestly couldn’t wait for his shift to end.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Hardly. I mean, I’m no professional or anything. I just work here at the Wheezes, you know?” Draco stared at him, incredulous, and Harry gave another shrug. “Sure, I’d love to branch out and do this a bit more, but it’s not like I’d ever leave them in a lurch. George and Ron count on me.”
want to open up that particular can of flobberworms.) I haven’t really thought about it before, but it’s essentially the same bigotry, the same narrow-mindedness, the same xenophobia — just at opposite ends of the spectrum. The difference between your situation and mine, though, and what probably shaped us so differently despite growing up with such similar parental figures, is that yours loved you whole-heartedly while mine basically hated my guts above everything else in the world.
And they were. Draco looked around the room, each person pulling a jumper down over their heads, thanking Molly and exclaiming their pleasure with the gift. Pulling off the jumper he’d arrived in, leaving him in just a light dress shirt, Draco tugged the new jumper over his head and sighed.
“I-I just don’t want to…” Harry lowers his gaze to find Malfoy’s hand on his own, his pale thumb brushing gently over the darker skin of Harry’s knuckles. He swallows. “…end up alone.”
Right. Well, at least Draco could be honest about this part. “At the Reserve. I work for the foundation that runs it.”
“Draco? You’re a-a Veela?” Draco nods silently, looking defeated. “How could I not know you...? No, please, don’t apologise. Just tell me what’s going on.”
“So,” Harry murmurs, dizzy from the nearness of Draco’s solid body and the spicy scent of his cologne. “I believe I owe you ten Galleons.”
Harry let out a little huff, but he nodded. “I suppose we’ll see you this afternoon, then.” He paused, then added stiffly, “Welcome to the family.”
Anyway, I’m suddenly painfully aware that I never did apologise for what I did to you that day. And maybe I shouldn’t do this in a letter, but since I don’t want to wait until next year to do it, let me just say it now: I’m sorry, Malfoy. I’m so terribly sorry. And believe it or not, I am grateful that you survived. I’m not asking your forgiveness, but I hope you’ll at least accept my long-overdue apology. Otherwise, I fear this friendship will be even weirder than it already is.
Draco grimaced. He figured he’d deserved that. “It’s not all I do,” he bit out, his tone sharp. Too sharp for the innocent question, he realised. He sighed. “I’m sorry. That was rude of me. I generally only work here a day or two per week, taking care of their accounting.”
The mystery was solved on my eleventh birthday when Hagrid barged through the door with a homemade birthday cake — my first ever — and told me I was a wizard. Up ‘til then, wizards were nothing but the stuff of fairy tales, nothing more than characters in the type of books I’d never been allowed to read (because heaven forbid I’d get any ideas). The next morning, he took me to Diagon Alley, introducing me to our world, and that was the day I met you, the very first wix my own age, at Madam Malkin’s.
“I just…” Harry swallowed. “I just don’t want Teddy to walk in on his number one idol defiling me on the kitchen table.”
Harry looked up from his spot under the big cherry tree in the Burrow’s orchard to see Fleur Weasley standing a few yards away, waiting for permission to join him. He’d come to be alone, to think, to work through the confusing mess in his head, the whirlwind of emotions in his chest. But maybe… Well, maybe she could help.
“You wouldn’t…?” Bella’s peal of laughter echoed through the room, making Draco’s hairs stand on end. “As if you had any say in the matter, Cissy. I can do whatever the hell I want.”
Harry groans and turns his gaze to the ceiling, covering his face with his hands. Not that Draco doesn’t know Harry’s bi, but the less the man knows about the object of his affections, the better. Ignoring the fluttery feeling in his stomach, Harry steels himself and pushes his hands through his hair before turning to look at Draco. “…and I’m not going to.”
I hadn’t expected my protective instinct to take over from there, hadn’t expected my stupid, possessive chest monster to force me to come back with you every time since. I tell myself it’s just because I’m a good friend, that I want to be there for you, to support you, to look after you. Truth is, I’d never be able to forgive myself if something ever happened to you on a night like this. Not that you’re not capable of taking care of yourself — I’m fairly sure that you are, you’re a competent wizard, and a powerful one at that — but in a place like this, surrounded by strangers, intoxicated and willingly making yourself vulnerable for people who… I mean, who knows which of these men are trustworthy and not? Who knows which have good intentions and which are only out to use and abuse you? I might not like witnessing what you get up to with them, but at least I’m here if you need me, ready to take you home whenever you decide to call it a night.
“Yes, well.” Hannah gave him a wry smile. “You wouldn’t have to do it without me, would you, since this is all my fault in the first place. Now, go over there and get your man.”
“Which I’m quite grateful for, both as an employer and as the one responsible to pay for the Reserve’s insurance policies.”
Slyvia was… She was well-meaning, if overly boisterous for Draco’s taste, and her ridiculously over-the-top demeanour and style of dress, especially when preparing for one of her shows, tended to embarrass him — which, in turn, only seemed to encourage her flirting. Like now.
Sometimes I wish we weren’t limited to these letters, though. I mean, writing is nice and all, but sometimes I feel like I can’t read you as well as I’d want to. Like in your latest letter, where you first promise me you won’t ridicule my friends anymore, just to go on calling Ron a joke a few paragraphs later? What the hell am I supposed to do with that?
the fire. He chided himself for this fact even as he ran faster, watching the fire die out for several seconds only to return again once the irate dragon had gathered her breath.
He wants to say more. He wants to tell Draco how much he means to him, how much he lo— likes him. He wants to tell Draco how amazing he is and how utterly perfect his glorious body feels against his skin. But his stupid brain refuses to cooperate, muddled as it is from the flood of arousal coursing through his veins. Instead, he takes Draco’s earlobe in his mouth and sucks hard, flicking it with the tip of his tongue as he sinks his fingers into Draco’s locks again and tilts his head up for another desperate kiss.
“Good.” As Harry relaxed, he noticed the unmistakable prickle at the nape of his neck telling him he was being watched. Glancing towards its source, he was unsurprised to find Draco’s warm, grey eyes studying him over thin-rimmed half-moon glasses. Draco raised a bushy white eyebrow in question and Harry gave him a reassuring smile, ignoring the pixies in his stomach as he turned back to Teddy. “Now, do you remember what you had planned to ask Santa for?”
surprising? His narrowed eyes were intent on the screen before him, his fingers flying over the keyboard as he typed. The clenched jaw, currently shadowed by a dark stubble, completed the look of irritation Draco readily recognised from their Hogwarts’ days.
“Yes, well, sorry about that. I don’t know any short but tall, blond but dark, slim but burly men. But if I happen to run into one, I’ll make sure to give them your number,” Draco added with a wink when Harry finally looked up. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco quickly turned his attention back to Molly. “In the meantime, what about Ginny? Don’t you want to find a nice bloke for Ginny?”
“Oh.” Harry looks down on his bare chest where stray droplets of water still cling to his dark curls. “Well, I just came out of the shower.”
Harry had a wistful smile on his face, and Draco’s eyes burned at the realisation that Harry had no memories like that, nothing to hold on to. “It sounds wonderful,” Harry said quietly. “Do you still go?”
And with the Healers’ help, Charlie would hopefully be all right. Draco laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. He, Draco Malfoy, saving Charlie Weasley. Well, he thought wryly, it
PPS I suppose you could technically be considered handsome by some people who care enough to notice. And yes, apparently you’re clever enough to have given Hermione a good run for the top grades all these years. But why should I miss your obnoxious vanity? Why should I long for your ‘brilliant brain’ when I’m best friends with the brightest student of our generation? I simply said I’d have appreciated a rivalling seeker to play with sometimes, and an antagonist to rile up in the corridors when I’m down and in need of an adrenaline boost. If Misinterpretation was a N.E.W.T. subject, you’d ace it.
, Draco thought as he desperately fought the urge to sink into Potter’s touch. “I bet a sledge ride in the fresh air would do you wonders.”
“Oh, shut it, you. Teddy and I did it together, okay, and if you don’t like it, fine, but don’t come here criticising my—”
“Oh, well, in that case. If you’ll excuse us, Mr and Mrs Champon,” Draco said lightly, unsure where the confidence in his voice was coming from. Thank Merlin for years of pure-blood training, he supposed.
Each session will consist of bite-sized, easy-to-digest chunks from both elements, repeated as needed as ‘practice makes perfect’. And, since they have a lot of ground to cover in such a limited time, Malfoy insists Harry makes time to meet with him on a daily basis until the Master deems his Apprentice ready for the ‘real thing’.
“No,” Draco said immediately, shaking his head. “I couldn’t bear to go alone. Maybe someday, when I have someone by my side, I’ll try it again.”
“Good.” Harry patted him on his foot. “Now try to get some sleep. You’ll need all the energy you can get for your big adventure tomorrow.”
be able to produce such a fluttery effect on any young man’s stomach. Harry ought to know. He was a Healer, after all; the body and its reactions were supposed to be his area of expertise. Yet, the number of pixies stirring in his belly as he watched Draco joke with the girls and make them feel comfortable was almost frightening. He’d known Draco was good with Teddy, he’d witnessed it before, but he had no idea Draco’s love for children stretched any further than his own cousin — or why it should in any way matter to Harry.
It still feels like an impossible dream, an idealistic utopia worthy of the silver screen. Yet, here they are, doing it, living it.
I don’t know why I was so surprised by the colour. Not that I don’t like purple (or is it violet?), it’s just… unexpected, I guess. Maybe it shouldn’t be. I do remember you telling me it’s supposed to match the family crest, after all, not any Hogwarts house crest, and yet, for some reason, I’d still imagined my family’s ancestry ink to be scarlet. Yes, I know — and do stop rolling your eyes, Draco; I don’t want to be the reason they get stuck back there one day — but that’s actually how little I know about my heritage.
Draco promptly pushed the thought aside. “Well, if you’re going to wear your coat like that, we should get inside. We can’t have your delicate Gryffindor nature taking a chill.”
“Based on what I’ve heard from my siblings and my new colleagues, I beg to differ. You’ve practically been circling each other since day one, haven’t you?”
It was like nothing he’d ever experienced before, not even from his own mother. It was like everything he missed about his mum wrapped up in one single embrace: her acceptance, her pride, her love, her encouragement.
; the annoying snarky git who’d always had the ability to draw Harry’s attention like no one else ever could.
Draco dropped his head in his hands. Telling Sirius was supposed to help. Why the hell did he feel like things had just gotten worse?
And then, just when Harry's certain it couldn't possibly get any better, it does. Because Draco's wings draw around them both, cocooning Harry in a nest of feathers and caramel and... Draco. Draco's hand lands on Harry's cock, and when one of his shimmering feathers brushes along Harry's soul mark, Harry is…lost.
“But that was all a mistake! You can’t marry Charlie.” Her tone was matter-of-fact and it just pissed him off.
“There you are! Come in, come in,” he said, stepping aside to let Draco into his narrow hallway. “Dinner’s about ready.”
As Draco watched, the girl glanced over to the table where her companion sat waiting for her, a bright-eyed girl with soft honey-coloured curls and a shy smile. She blushed as she noticed Blondie watching her, worrying her bottom lip while absentmindedly straightening her skirt under the table. Blondie clearly couldn’t take her eyes off her, and Draco wouldn’t be surprised if this was their first date. He fought a smile; judging by Blondie’s nervous fiddling, decaf was probably a wise choice.
No, he didn’t hate the manor. But he did hate being back. He hated how being here reminded him of how much had changed. Hated the intangible shift in atmosphere that made him not want to be in his childhood home anymore. Hated how it made him wish he’d been allowed to stay back at Hogwarts for the holidays.
“But that’s all in the past. This is my second chance at life, and I have it because of you. You saved me. It took a coma to wake me up.”
Eager hands venture under the hem of Harry’s t-shirt, setting Harry’s skin on fire wherever they roam. The shirt fabric gets bunched up at Harry’s armpits and although he’s reluctant to break their kiss, Harry makes the sacrifice at the prospect of feeling Draco’s bare chest against his own.
among the spines in the bookshelf. Even the smells: butterbeer, broom polish, exploding snap cards… Draco had to concede it all felt a bit overwhelming.
“Yeah, I did,” Teddy confirmed with a vigorous nod as Draco’s hot breath brushed the shell of Harry’s ear.
He took a deep breath and looked into her hazel, Hufflepuff eyes. “Deal. Thanks, love. I don’t know how I’d do this without you.”
Harry’s mouth waters as he roams his eyes over Draco’s bare torso. He can’t wait to explore every inch of Draco’s gorgeous body, memorising every dip and curve with his lips, tracing every freckle and scar with his tongue. He aches to trail his fingertips over every—
After all this time holding back, this sudden, unexpected nearness is outright intoxicating. Every fibre of Harry’s body is aching to touch, to taste, to feel — but he knows he shouldn’t. Not if it could ruin what they already have; the unlikely friendship they’ve finally found in each other after everything.
She squealed as Sirius carried her into the next room, leaving Draco standing awkwardly by the fireplace in what appeared to be a small sitting room. Molly entered seconds later.
Mouth dry, I take another swig of my ale, only to find my glass empty. I try to act as if it’s not, pretending to savour the taste and swallow as expected, feeling like an utter fool. It’s not the first time I’ve made the same mistake tonight either, but I hope to Merlin you haven’t noticed. If you were to ask the reason for my being so preoccupied, I wouldn’t be able to come up with a reasonable answer.
to. He would make it work. He would make Potter proud of him if it was the last thing he did on this earth.
Generally, the dragons had the run of the nearby mountains, nesting in the caves hidden in the cliffs, but there were always a few that needed extra attention, extra care, and they remained in the paddocks closer to the main camp. Draco walked in that direction, passing the row of keepers’ cabins lined out along the path, most of them empty as their habitants were either working on the grounds or off the Reserve with their families for the holiday.
“Oh, well… Any place that offers high-quality food and a decent wine list, really. Preferably someplace with live music that allows for some post-dinner slow dancing if the mood strikes.” Malfoy’s lips quirk into a dreamy smile. “I’m not saying I need to be taken to The Golden Cauldron or anything. Although, it’s on my bucket list…” He shoots Harry a glance before adding, “Did you know they have a three-month waiting list if you want to book a table?”
Smaug looked up at him from his place on the entryway floor and tilted his head in interest. He may be a three-legged rescue animal, and he may have the imploring eyes of Antonio Banderas’ Puss in Boots, but sometimes, enough is just enough. Especially at late o’clock after a frantic fundraiser night.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, George and Ron named it that. I actually have a workshop on the other side, and the area just sort of took on a cave-like atmosphere after I set it up.” He shrugged. “Come on.”
Harry’s cock sprung free and… damn, Draco’s mouth watered at the mere sight of it. Hard, flushed and leaking, its base surrounded by a patch of dark, curly hair, it seemed to reach for Draco much like a love-sick teen begging to be kissed. Draco happily obliged. Leaning in, he licked the bead of pre-come from the slit and moaned as the erotic taste hit his tongue.
“I need you to be your normal, charming self this weekend to coax all these donors to give up their money. I can’t imagine your current demeanour is going to win us any large donations.”
He groaned and shoved his fists deeper into his coat pockets. This needed to end. It was one thing finding your friend and fellow co-worker hot and fit beyond measure; that didn’t have to mean anything. Falling in love with them, though, without any hope of it ever evolving into anything beyond one-sided pining, was surely nothing but pathetic. If Draco had been interested, he would’ve said something by now, right? Because there was no way the man hadn’t noticed Harry’s swooning every five minutes whenever they happened to be in the same room. No, Draco knew, all right. And he graciously ignored it whenever he caught Harry ogling, or losing his train of thought mid-sentence, or blabbering utter nonsense because he just couldn’t help himself.
“This will be… an everlasting love…” Natalie Cole’s joyful voice suddenly rang through the room. Draco wiped the dough off his hands and covered the bowl with a towel to keep Smaug from sticking his paw into the mix. The little fox watched from his perch on the back of the sofa, feigning disinterest. Draco was not fooled.
All-too-familiar green eyes met his, as if they’d been trained on him this entire time. (And they probably had, judging by the prickle Draco had sensed on his neck while preparing their drinks.) Not that Draco allowed himself to register that nugget of information. He was all too busy averting his gaze and fighting the blush that threatened to overtake his cheeks. It was in moments like this when his pale complexion felt more like a curse than the blessing his father had always insisted it was.
“Oh, I—” She pursed her lips, frowning. “Maybe jam?” she ventured, as if Draco held the answer to her unknown desires. “Or cream cheese? I don’t know, I—”
Draco turned and rolled his eyes at her. He knew she hated when he did that. “Read the invitation, Pans. Charlie Weasley.”
“Me too.” Draco laughed as he wrapped another bulb and placed it next to the others in the box. And if his laugh sounded harsher than usual, well, it was no surprise to either of them. “Honestly, Slyvia, I don’t know how I got myself into that whole mess.”
“I’m sorry, I—” Draco blurted, mortified. “It’s not what you think. I can explain, if you’d just let me—”
“I-I didn’t.” As if Draco still were a naive eleven-year-old. As if he didn’t already know the truth. “Please, Draco, I swear…”
He was unsure what time it was now, however. While the silence of the house suggested it was still nighttime, the smell of fresh coffee coming from the kitchen and Molly’s voice talking quietly made him consider otherwise. He glanced at his watch. Half-past six. He had a nine o’clock meeting with the caterers for the upcoming charity gala to confirm the final menu and headcounts, and then he’d promised Pansy he’d go to the Reserve later in the morning to check in with Ernie.
Draco grasped the coin in his pocket, reminding himself to breathe as he let the pad of his thumb glide over its smooth surface, visualising Potter’s engraved silhouette under his skin.
No sooner has the forbidden thought entered Harry’s mind than he hears the running water being turned off in the bathroom.
He’d been contemplating it for ages, envisioning different scenarios, discarding them one after the other and growing more frustrated with every passing day. When the idea struck him now, though, there was no hesitation. He knew it was right — perfect even — and so he reached for two cups and drew his wand, surreptitiously spelling a message on the inside of one of them in white, water-proof ink.
I have an exam next week, a really important one, and I know I should be studying for it like a maniac, but… I just can’t muster up the energy to care. It’s just so inexplicably boring. Paragraph upon paragraph of rules and regulations, most of which are downright idiotic. Even the dusty tome they’re listed in is boring me half to death. Maybe if I was 100% sure about wanting to become an auror, I would have been able to stomach it as a hurdle towards the main goal, but as it is…
And it held no relevance next to Charlie’s quick grin and crystal blue eyes. He stopped to talk to the intern manning the desk in the next room, smiling, dropping his hand momentarily onto the young woman’s arm before winking and slamming out the door, most likely heading back to his cottage.
I know you don’t open up easily, that exposing your vulnerability is the last thing you want. But if you can only hold on, lose your fear, I’ll try to keep the walls from falling down.
“At work?” Draco cut in, saving Harry’s imminent blunder. “Yes, I— It’s been a looong day…” He grimaced and made a good show of stretching out his spine with one hand on the small of his back. “You know, travelling all over the world in one day really takes its toll on…”
this, ought to be the last thing Draco should do, and even as he revelled in the comfort of Potter’s embrace, he couldn’t help cursing the universe for showing him what he could never have.
The unspoken response travels through Harry’s body like an earthquake, a tremor strong enough to rattle the foundations of his carefully constructed walls.
Intrigued, Harry tries again, this time drawing the entire, raspberry-coloured bud into his mouth, twirling his tongue around it and flicking it back and forth.
“Really?” Harry sounded surprised but then quickly tried to cover it. “I mean, thank you. Can you meet me at the Wheezes at seven?”
.” Draco’s drawn-out s makes the simple word sound like a prayer, a plea. His palms are on Harry’s arse now, pulling him closer, pressing Harry’s raging erection against Draco’s equally hard length.
Her smile was just as jovial as ever, and since Draco was perfectly able to ignore the existence of their unspoken exchange the previous day, he didn’t notice the quizzical quirk of her eyebrow. At least that’s what he told himself. Because why would she look like she was bursting with the need to question him about whether or not he’d done something she’d never proposed he’d do in the first place?
Draco’s chest swelled a little with pride. “Thank you, sir. Although, I just work for the Park Foundation. I wouldn’t say I’m a mastermind behind anything.”
“Just let me give you one last tip,” Draco says softly, the corner of his mouth twitching into a lopsided smile.
“Well, that won’t be a problem, would it, since we’ll not be dating for real? It’s just one friend helping out another. You know what? Go out with me, and I bet you ten Galleons your Valentine’s date will end up better than any other date you’ve ever had.”
“Because, well…” Harry shifted on the bed, moving to loom over Draco, claiming his gaze with those expressive, emerald eyes. When he spoke again, his voice resonated through every fibre of Draco’s body, low and deliciously sexy. “As your personal physiologist-in-training, I feel obliged to prescribe something for all that heaving. I’m thinking cardio,” he added, rocking his hips, rubbing his hardening cock against Draco’s thigh. “Lots and lots of cardio.”
PS No, I don’t actually think you’re useless, Malfoy. I’ve already told you how much that spark of silent defiance meant, not just to me, but to the end of the war.
Still want to go to that quidditch match with you, though. We’ll just have to come up with a way to keep from hexing each other and I’m sure we’ll be fine. Oh, how about we turn it into a challenge? The first one to hex the other pays for drinks at the pub afterwards?
With his eyes fixed on the red velvet above, he goes through each sound, ticking off each one in his mind, as if from a checklist. Neville’s snore, check. Ron’s mumbling, check. Low murmurs from Dean and Seamus’s bed—officially Seamus’s bed, but they’ve hardly slept apart since Fifth Year—check. The brisk wind outside, whipping against the tower’s windows, confirming his place in space and time; Scotland, late November. Check.
“Merlin, I’m going to miss him so much.” Harry’s words had Draco look up from his tea, only to find Harry with his head thrown back, eyes closed, facing the ceiling. Draco watched as Harry rubbed his hands over his face. “Thank the stars Lyra will still be here for another three years. I can’t imagine this house without either of them in it.”
Harry wanted to get closer, wanted to touch, wanted to feel, wanted to inhale the Draco-scented air he knew was lingering only a few steps in front of him. But his knees had gone weak again, turned into jelly by the mere sight of Draco in his home, and so he opted for leaning against the doorframe instead, hopefully looking casual with his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets.
Draco chuckles again. It’s a glorious sound and Harry loves the sensation of it as it rumbles through his body. “I was just about to suggest you could join me, but if you think I’m an evil—”
And speaking of… Yes, Malfoy, I do consider us friends. Don’t you? I mean, we’ve been doing this for over four months now, and I’ve told you stuff I’ve never told anyone else. And unless you’re just keeping this quill-pal thing going as a way to gather information about me to sell to the press at your earliest convenience, I’m pretty sure you’re feeling the same.
“Here. Let me…” Harry’s arm flexed in Draco’s grip and Draco readily obliged, releasing his hold on Harry’s right wrist. Soon, Harry’s hand was snaking its way in between their bodies, his fist wrapping around them both, creating glorious friction for Draco’s aching cock. “Oh fuck, Draco…”
And all right, Harry guessed he did, in a way. Between the Christmas tree in the corner and the yule log crackling merrily in the hearth, a well-dressed Santa Claus could but complete the picture.
They made it inside and Harry even had the awareness to cast a one-way Silencing Charm on the door before returning his attention to his… friend? Guest?
“Pansy—” He really didn’t want to be left to his thoughts. He needed to stay busy. He needed not to think too much.
“Yes, Potter, four. Out of five. Additionally, you spoke with food in your mouth on at least three occasions and checked your watch more times than I could count. You didn’t refill my water glass and there’s a drop of sauce at the corner of your mouth — yes, right there” — Malfoy purses his lips and touches the tip of his index finger against his mouth — “that’s been there for at least fifteen minutes.”
“Yes, well, that’s probably for the best, yes. And I’ll have you know that my arse is perfectly delightful. How dare you not have noticed?” Trying to distract from the blush and not caring that he was playing just a little bit with fire, Draco twirled so his back was to Harry and clenched his arse.
“Do you even go on any dates?” Draco peers at him from the corner of his eye, frowning. He’s still resting his head on top of the couch’s back, a lock of his damp, post-shower hair falling in front of his eyes as he turns to Harry with a faint smile. “You’re quite a catch, you know?”
“Exactly. So, by supplying the wand for the student on their first day of Hogwarts, we ensure that every student has a quality wand and nobody has to be embarrassed or singled out. After all, sometimes it’s not even about economics; some families consider it tradition to use an ancestor’s wand.”
It was adorable, really, the confused hesitation. Draco, who was a decent bloke these days, decided to put the floundering Lord of Ineloquence out of his misery.
“Yes.” Draco took it out and turned it over in his hands, letting it travel between his fingers for a moment before taking the time to actually look at it for the first time in quite a while. It was old and worn now, every sharp ridge smooth after years of apprehensive caresses, every detail blurred from countless worried strokes by the pad of a thumb in search of reassurance. The surface positively gleamed in the soft lamplight, as if polished to perfection and ready to join Mother’s silverware for Christmas dinner. “I got it the evening before my departure for Hogwarts.”
Not that Harry could blame him. He was just as captivated by Draco’s presence as the boy was, albeit for very different reasons. He tried to keep his eyes away — honestly, he did — but they were drawn back to the man, again and again, noticing his rounded belly moving as he laughed, his wrinkled hands cradling the cup, and the sticky foam of melted marshmallows catching in his moustache whenever he took another sip.
Fuck indeed. Draco thrust into Harry’s fist and leaned down to capture another delicious groan from Harry’s lips. He had started to realise turned-on Harry was a veritable buffet of tasty noises, and Merlin help him, but Draco was quickly becoming addicted to them all, feasting on every moan and savouring every whimper like a starving man.
I was a little sceptical about getting a new Head of House, but as things turned out, I couldn’t have wished for a better replacement for McGonagall. Faith Silverberry, the new Potions Professor, is amazing — and not only because she happens to have been good friends with my mum, but because she’s a really good teacher too. She’s patient and kind, and more pedagogic than Snape could ever dream of becoming. And get this: she can explain stuff so it makes sense, not only to me but even to Nev and Seamus. Pretty impressive, huh? Apparently, she and my mum were Potions partners all through school, and so she seems to have an endless supply of stories to tell me about my parents. (Nothing you’d ever need to worry about, right Malfoy, relying on the tales of a stranger to get to know what your parents were like?)
The climax rips through Harry like a Hippogriff's claws across silk sheets. There's nothing smooth about this, and it pulls him to shreds.
The music is loud, its bassline pumping relentlessly from the speakers, pulsing across the sticky floor and reverberating through every fibre of my body. The spotlights cut through the darkness, their beams roaming in unpredictable patterns, splashing light in every colour of the rainbow over the dancing crowd below. It’s enough to make anyone dizzy, even without the aid of any alcohol, and I’m fairly sure that, if it weren’t for the sight of you in the middle of it all — a fixed focal point in the surrounding chaos, something solid to rest my eyes on, grounding me — my head would be spinning out of control.
The pile of fox puke greeting him by the door as he entered his flat was disgusting, and now, it was stuck to the sole of his shoe. His Italian leather shoe.
“So, where to?” Harry asked as the chilly night greeted them outdoors. As usual, it was raining, but the ground seemed cold enough to freeze the gathering puddles, covering the grass in a thin layer of ice that crunched under Draco’s boots.
“He’s amazing, isn’t he?” a familiar voice came from behind Draco, making his stomach flutter most pathetically.
“Shh. He is,” Molly insisted. “And Draco saved him from the dragon. Jumped into the paddock and pulled him out.” She sighed wistfully. “It’s really quite romantic. Can you imagine, saving your fiancé’s life in such a heroic way?”
because this time — maybe it's because Harry has relaxed, or because he's accidentally cast some kind of stretching magic, or maybe it's just because Draco is his, he doesn't know — but this time, Draco's progress isn't impeded and he manages to slide home.
“But it’s really late, darling, and you’re practically asleep already.” Harry combed his fingers through Teddy’s unruly locks, now back to the natural light brown he'd inherited from his father. “Come on, I can carry you if you want…”
Draco must read something in Harry's gaze because he pulls his fingers out, leaving Harry terribly empty, then returns again, this time with what must be another finger.
Pushing off from the counter, Draco took a few steps towards him, searching his face for something Harry didn’t dare put into words. His heart was beating so fast it felt like it was ready to explode, hope surging from his core in a whirlwind he found himself unable to control. “What were you…?”
“What do I do, Smaug? I don’t want to keep leading them on, but I don’t want to disappoint them either.” He glanced at the Christmas tree. “And it would be nice to be part of someone’s Christmas for once.”
Draco needn’t be told twice. As soon as Harry released his hands and straightened up above him, he rolled over in the tight space between Harry’s legs, landing on his back about the same time as Harry’s t-shirt hit the floor. Harry’s bare chest was a sight to behold, toned and tanned with dark pebbled nipples and a perfect dusting of hair — so far from the scrawny frame Draco remembered from their childhood. Draco wasn’t given nearly enough time to admire it, though, as Harry’s distracting hands were soon on him again, roaming over abs and pecs and ribs and shoulders, teasing sensitive nipples and trailing over protruding hip bones along the waistband of Draco’s pants.
Draco pulls back. “Bloody hell, Potter, warn a man before you go around swooning, all right? I almost didn’t catch you in time, and if you had hit your head at my expense, I’m
Draco used his wand to move the eight-foot spruce from one corner to the next. It really would look best near the fireplace, but then he wouldn’t be able to see it from the kitchen. He spent a good deal of his spare time there, trying new recipes, playing with new flavours. And dammit, he wanted to see the tree from where he spent his time chopping, mixing, and experimenting. The glow of the fairy lights was one of the best things about Christmas, after all.
“I’m Edward Remus Lupin, miss,” he said gravely before bowing in a manner that made Harry’s mouth twitch in amusement. He glanced over at Draco to see if he’d noticed the boy’s antics, only to find him smirking back at him over Finch-Fletchley junior’s head as the boy climbed down from his lap.
Oh, and I almost forgot. Guess what happened last week when your letter was delivered to me at Andromeda’s? Andromeda got one too, from her sister…
Worst part was, I couldn’t explain to them why. Not that the explanation I gave them wasn’t the truth. It was. But it was only half of it. I told them I needed some peace and quiet, to be able to think a proper thought from start to finish without being disturbed or interrupted. It’s almost impossible to do that around here, and it’s even worse at the Burrow. People everywhere, moving, talking, doting, caring. Don’t get me wrong, I love them all deeply, but to be honest, I’m still not used to it. Not like Ron and Ginny are. They’ve grown up with it, they take comfort in all the hustling and bustling in a way I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to. I can certainly enjoy it — Who doesn’t love being surrounded by a loving family? — but it usually doesn’t take more than a few days at most before my brain is about ready to explode.
“Right,” Draco muttered, casting a quick cleaning charm at the floor before cautiously stepping out of his shoes. He refused to use magic on the handcrafted footwear, afraid to weaken the natural oils in the material. Which meant he’d have to clean it by hand. He sighed.
“You’re not alone.” Draco gives his hand a light squeeze and Harry looks up into warm, silver-grey eyes. There’s a consoling smile curving his mouth, and Harry’s heart is pounding so hard it hurts.
Draco’s voice is choked, muffled behind his hands. “I’ve tried… Gods, I’ve tried so hard to suppress it, and I’ve managed it until now, but it’s getting to be too much and I’m just not strong enough to hold it in anymore and… I
“Yes, he overheard me or something, but he says I shouldn’t say anything to the others until Charlie wakes up.” He conjured an armchair and slumped into it, dropping his head in his hands. “What do I do, Pans? How did I get into this mess?”
Draco shakes his head slowly, but he doesn’t move away. His eyes, gleaming like molten silver, stay firmly trained on Harry’s as he speaks. “They’re for my mate, Harry. Only my mate can ever touch them.”
Letting out the breath he’d been holding, Draco nodded. “Yes, absolutely. I think I’ll just go upstairs for a bit and have some tea, then.”
lying, and it would have been smarter to just blurt it all out to Harry, to tell him what had happened and find his way out of it. But when had Draco ever been smart when it came to Harry bloody Potter? As always, it felt like this was something Draco had to win, like some sort of competition, ridiculous as it may sound. It brought back an exhilaration that he’d long thought dormant, in more ways than one.
Caring and supportive of the smallest of creatures, while at the same time betraying the trust of a person who had protected him his entire life. Of course, the Potion Master and the infamous Harry Potter had never gotten along. But after speaking so passionately at Severus' posthumous trial, getting the Ministry to award an Order of Merlin Second Class, Draco had assumed the 'Saviour' to have more respect for the man's property. However, maybe he was expecting too much. After all, Potter had him searching for antivenoms. So there had to be an important poison victim somewhere.
Concerned, Leewood inquired, "I know your parselmagic is impressive, but are you sure you can cover such a big area? And your little Malfoy will be right in the middle. What should keep them from sacrificing him anyway?"
Comforting, Harry assured her, "They evacuated the Dursleys in advance. I did not keep in touch, but when I became an Auror, I looked them up. They live in Eastbourne. A city with the lowest wizarding population in England. Of course, most wizards live in their street. First their presence was a safety measure during the war, but they seem to enjoy the city. So three families remained."
Only now did he notice that the werewolf-victim did not even look at him. The scars were evident on William's angry face. Still, he visibly tried to calm himself with even breaths. Smiling down at his wife, he lovingly kissed her forehead, before opening his arms. Draco observed him clenching his fists when stepping up to the sleeping Harry. Carefully reaching out, he brushed a wayward strand of hair out of the younger wizard's face. Despite talking quietly, the fury in his voice was still audible, when he demanded to know, "Have they caught them already?"
Disoriented and aching all over, Hermione stumbled as she was roughly shoved into a dark room. Fortunately, strong arms caught her and gently lowered her to the floor, as if the person knew about her head spinning and her stomach heaving. She could hear an unfamiliar voice, leer, "Don't worry, witch. You'll get out safe and sound after the next eclipse. You're just here because you couldn't keep your nose out of other people's business. But I'm sure your Death Eater whore will make your stay here as comfortable as possible." Then the door slammed shut and was locked audibly.
The two Ministry workers exclaimed at the same time, but the librarian had already started a discussion with Mdm Pince and was ignoring them pointedly. Looking at his fellow colleagues, who smiled before minding their own business, the raven-haired sagged and mumbled, "Alright, Greengrass, let's get you up to speed. It all started with the ritual we did at the British Library."
Looking at his friend's back, who was sorting through the available pizza choices with Hermione, Ron shook his head. "I think he should be sober for this one. Griphook's in his office until seven."
As you might have noticed, I decided on a bi-monthly update schedule. I want to give myself the time to really enjoy working on this story, without having to rush it. Since I'm currently not 100% into writing, I only manage about 1.000 words a week and though I definitely plan to finish this fic, it will take some time. So, have fun :).
"Arthurian Library," Daphne concluded thunderstruck, "Bloody hell, Potter, you really draw in the exotic ones." Glancing over her shoulder, she noticed the Aurors' surprised look.
A few seconds later, a lamp appeared, hovering mid-air. They were halfway through their dinner when in the corner farthest from the door a four-poster-bed appeared. It was only slightly bigger than the beds at Gryffindor tower, but inspecting it, Hermione smiled, "This will certainly do."
"Purity will always conquer?" Harry replied, looking a little proud of himself. "That's the motto of … of your family."
Harry helplessly looked at Neville, quietly wondering what to do now, hating himself for it just the tiniest bit. Where was the 'Saviour', the great leader the entire Wizarding Britain had looked up to?
Neither Neville nor he liked to be thrown out but had relented since all of them even dreamed about books these days. Considering that they did not believe the librarians to be in mortal danger, they did not even sneak out files to work from home. Well, not many at least. Neville had secretly copied the Curriculum Vitae of their victims, and Harry might have gathered a copy of their book-list. Maybe Narcissa could help. But was it worth the risk? The Black sister was not a delicate flower that would wither if she was met with hostility that would inevitably happen at the ministry. But the idea of bringing her in, forcing her to deal with bouts of animosity from all sides, did not sit well with Harry. Better to pick her brain to see if the risk was worth the gain. He could always ask Robarts and Pince if they agreed to bring an independent consultant in. Grinning, Harry pondered. A new concept to ask for permission rather than forgiveness. But for the sake of the Lady Malfoy, he was willing to give it a try.
It was the last comment from the oldest Auror that had the former Lord look up, checking his reflection in one of the windows. True, he did look like a mad-man, hair unkempt and naked save for pants and a slightly too small dressing gown. Yet for the second time in his life, he could not care about appearances. He had to make them understand. Had to make Harry understand! His liege would know what to do, if Lucius could to convince him. "Master," he pleaded, "I'm begging you. You have to believe me! You need to find Draco before sunset. If these cultists can't have me, my son is the next suitable sacrifice available. He's of the same bloodline, pure and strong. Please, my Lord," he whispered desperately, when he saw the doubtful faces of the other Aurors, "save him."
Taking a sip from her cup, decaffeinated tea naturally, Hermione requested, "Would you share the recipe? For the next few months, I am a little restricted on the potions I can take and sometimes … I would really appreciate it."
Leaning back in his chair, Harry starred at their ceiling. There was some glittery residue that reflected the light. Had that always been there?
of May would be upon them. Last year, Harry had drunken that day away, brooding at Severus Snape's bedside. This year, everything was different. Hermione was due in June, adding yet another child to their family to love. Draco was fully immersed in his potion-research. Though he still had nightmares quite frequently, he also had agreed to talk to mind-healer Charles Young. Maybe something would come of it, perhaps not, but Harry considered it a step into the right direction. He did not know what had made the blond finally give in but suspected his godfather of having something to do with it. Though Severus Prince spent less and less time at Grimmauld Place, he still kept his habit of taking a drink in his rooms after dinner, thus making himself available, if either Harry, Draco or both wanted to talk. While the raven-haired secretly worried that the Potion Master would not want to stay long term, it was good to see him engaged in research and developments in his field of expertise. Severus was happier for it, and Harry could not begrudge him that.
"You have so much explaining to do when this is over," his friend mumbled. "Expecto Patronum!" A red panda leapt from his wand and within moments was sent on his way with several messages.
Having gotten used to the addressing, Andromeda did not even raise an eyebrow at the familiarity between the Boy-Who-Lived and his formerly so adverse teacher. She did, however, smile, when the young man in question protested tiredly. "This is your home! I did, …" but fell silent when the Potion Master raised his hand.
"Harry, …" Draco's mother probed gently. When he didn't react but continued to babble nonsense, she used her 'mother−voice'. "Young man, look at me!"
Well, there was nothing to be done now. First, they had to take care of Mr Malfoy. Fortunately, Arnica Montana was very resilient, and despite the less than ideal surroundings, Neville managed to pick a few healthy leaves for Lady Malfoy.
After a few heartbeats, he suggested, "I can change the colour of your night clothes to a hot pink colour, to brighten your complexion. Would you like that, Sir?"
Misguided as he had been, Narcissa had never blamed him for choosing Dark over Light. She too had been seduced by Tom Riddle's promises of greatness for all purebloods. The return to the old ways and a revival of nearly forgotten traditions that had once been the base of their culture … of their magic. The charismatic man had promised them wealth, influence and power and she - like so many other Lords and Ladies - had believed him. They had all been wrong in the end. Yet, thanks to one fearless wizard, they had not paid with their lives for that mistake. Hence, there was only one advice she could offer, having gained some perspective, after having worked as Harry's 'private' secretary for the last few months. Reaching out, she gently touched her husband's clammy hands and offered, "Lucius, Harry does not need you to say sorry. He just needs you to be. Our 'Saviour' has all but the best of intentions, and I think it is time that you understand that, instead of painting the shadow of Voldemort on his shoulder at any given moment."
“Do you hate me? Because I simply can’t let you move on?” With a sigh, the young wizard shook his head, as if to brush off these thoughts. “Anyway, Malfoy Senior did a fine thing today. He helped me with a case and discovered details we need for a conviction. Hermione is ready to worship the ground he walks on, in exchange for his insight. We agreed that Lucius will defend this jerk, while Hermione works on putting him away for good. They can’t actually work together, but since Neville and I have to follow the leads Lucius provides, some of the findings might get shipped to the Department of Law … well, potentially.”
Pulling out his training-wand, Teddy turned to face the carpet, mouthing the words, before nodding determined, "For Harry."
When the blond stumbled after Harry’s house elf, the owner of the house nodded to himself. He knew Draco to be exceptionally skilled with magical artefacts and was aware of his love for books. His current assignment should keep him busy until the situation was resolved, one way or the other. Looking at the clock, Harry stormed up to his room, cast a cleaning charm and threw on some clothes, suitable for a hearing at the Wizengamot.
Much slower was the progress the librarians were able to make with their squibs. Chris Drake had already demanded back his time-turner twice. However, fortunately, both times Draco had been able to come up with new ideas when, yet another rune-potion combination had literally gone up in flames. Drawbacks and unsuccessful developments were the steppingstones of every scientific improvement. Nevertheless, Narcissa was worried about how long the head of the Arthurian Library would remain patient before he took desperate measures. Measures that would draw the wrong kind of attention towards her family. That could make them lose all ground they had gained with the Ministry. Also, Drake was well aware that he could not keep his research team away from their 'day jobs' indefinitely. And once they were gone, progress would be going even slower. Something he seemed determined to avoid at all cost. Case in point, he was currently arguing with Irma Pince in their 'ritual room', where Hogwarts' Librarian was documenting their latest failure.
"They told you …" the man had tapered off, closing his eyes against the humiliating thought of this former pupil learning about him panicking on the staircase.
"Potter … Harry, I …" The usually so composed wizard was at a loss for words. Being a master of a craft meant keeping up with developments in his field. Constant learning, improving oneself was necessary to stay on top of one's game. Severus had always known that he would have a hard time re-joining the potioneers' community after his long absence. Not keeping up for a year was hard but five … there was simply no way he could have gotten up to speed on that. But now, with this, he might have the chance. Looking up at the boy he had hated and belittled during his entire Hogwarts' career, he was able to force but one single word out of his closed-up throat, "Why?"
The Malfoy Family was one of the sacred twenty-eight. From a pureblood's point of view, the conjunction might be beneficial. But from a social one, it could all but destroy Astoria's social standing once and for all. On the other hand, what did she have to lose, widowed with her husband having died under suspicious circumstances? It was all very logical, but Draco felt that there was more to this implied proposal than well thought out aspirations of gaining a pureblood husband on Astoria's part. After all, she has had that until a week ago.
When the couple rose as well, Hermine seemed to want to say something, but Ron simply squeezed Draco's shoulder and then nudged her, with a concerned, "Let's see if there is any pudding left, or if the little pixies had polished off every last crumb."
"Not so abducted after all, as it turned out," Harry sighed. "They have requested Narcissa's expertise. So, we thought it prudent to relocate them to the Manor."
Grumbling, Harry led the way into the garden, where he stopped in front of a worn-down shack Severus had not really noticed before. Strange.
"Fine, so, the truth is: you don't deserve this; any leniency at all. You captured and tortured me, my friends, and probably countless others in service to your Lord. Though we have never been able to prove it, you might have killed innocent people as well. Lucius Malfoy was a bastard who deserved to rot in Azkaban for the rest of his life. Maybe, even receive the Dementor's Kiss." Looking up, Harry noticed that the other man's posture had not changed one bit. His face was frozen, and only the interwoven fingers over his knee betrayed him. He was clutching them so tightly, that his entire hands had gone white. Nevertheless, the young man continued. "Draco's father, however, is another matter entirely. He risked everything to get his family away from Tom Riddle. I doubt that you considered my chances of actually winning very high, so you risked torture or worse, simply by turning away from the future ruler of the wizarding world."
Wolfing down the first bite, he shrugged, “Since sunrise, I guess? Neville brought our latest case files, and I hoped to be able to go over them before we have to leave for the Manor.”
"Isa cannot bring a shower, but me can clean Miss up." With a snap of her fingers, Hermione felt squeaky clean. Even her hair seemed to have been washed. "Isa is returning with tea soon."
Stuffing his mouth desperately, between wetting it with sips of beer right from the bottle, Draco gasped, "By Morgana, my day is hard enough without you trying to poison me with dinner, Potter!"
When the trio merely looked at him, he elaborated, "It was a dreamless sleep potion … a mild one and the three of you shared but one vial." Gazing at Hermione and Ron, he comforted, "It was a mostly herbal remedy with but a hint of magic to back it up. I would not have put your baby at risk … ever!"
"We're there, whenever you need us, Harry. You know that. All you have to do is ask," Hermione assured him before flinching slightly, rubbing her belly. "Ouch. Easy, little fellow."
The knock on the bedroom door was so quiet, that Harry considered it a figment of imagination for a heartbeat, despite having waited for it. But since the only person around would most likely not make himself known a second time, the raven-haired shuffled out of bed. Draco looked tired and unsure, ready to retreat at a moment's notice. So, the young wizard merely nudged the door open all the way and returned to his bed. The blond hesitated for a moment, before following. He slipped between the sheets, unsure of how to act in a 'normal' bed, where the two wizards were not forced into close proximity. After a few minutes, Draco turned, watching the light of the waning moon that fell through the open curtains. Maybe he should not have come. After all, he was a grown man, and the Dark Lord was gone. Harry had not returned to sleep either, his breaths too even and controlled for him to be asleep.
The raven's attention was drawn away when Narcissa briefly squeezed his hand. "We are very glad that you have finally woken. We have, indeed, been quite concerned." From a pureblood and Lady that was practically a declaration of love, so it was now Harry's turn to blush and avoid her gaze.
When he couldn't find Harry in the corridor, he knocked on his study before entering. Finding his godfather sending off an owl, he shared with a delighted smile. "I think he liked it."
Hedwig had done that, but so much more. She had lived with Harry, had listened to his problems. Had offered companionship … friendship even. She had been the one living soul, who had accepted the young wizard for who he was, staying by his side through all hardships. In the end, she had even saved his life. Somehow, Harry doubted that Draco had ever had someone like that in his life.
"Draco," he whispered, slipping onto the bed, closer to the blond. "Draco, look at me, please." When the young man lifted his head anxiously, Harry gently reached for him and brushed away his tears. "I need you to do something for me." At a half−enthusiastic nod, he continued, "You know Occlumency, right? I need you to occlude and push me out with all your strength." Before Draco could work up another panic, when Harry pulled his wand, the raven−haired was already casting, "Legilimens!"
That evening, as Harry came out of the shower, his wand slapped into his hand with no conscious effort. His eyes narrowed, as he recognised Severus sitting in front of one of his windows, illuminated only by the moonlight. Though the raven-haired could not see the Potion Master's face, the tension was palpable in the air. Making a conscious effort to relax, Harry lowered his wand. "Do you think it is smart to ambush an Auror in his own bedroom?"
Choking out a sob, the raven-haired pressed his hands to his mouth to muffle the relieved keen that rose in his throat.
Upper body still mostly inside her trunk, a muffled rebuff was the only answer. "Astoria, I don't have time now. I'll have to leave in about six minutes."
After swallowing an unusually large bite, he was nearly out of time, since Neville wanted to visit Hogwarts this afternoon with Harry's map, of course, the young Auror sighed. "See, that's the thing, none as far as we can tell. Alexander Pince's team, they lead the investigation, went over the entire catalogue of the classified tomes available in each library and all are accounted for! They even went over the Restricted Section yesterday, but every book is where it should be."
Pondering that for a few moments, Lucius wanted to know, "What should I do now? Once upon a time, we were friends."
Once Harry and Draco were alone, the young wizard looked at his companion. Quietly, the blond admitted, "We were … concerned." His pale face and jittery movements proved his frazzled nerves.
Still, sixteen to eighteen hours emerged in potion-journals with little sleep, left Draco to feel as irritable and exhausted as Harry looked. He was well aware that his master staggered through the floo in the middle of the night. Only to get a few hours of sleep, before leaving again after a short shower and an even shorter meal. Secretly, Draco suspected, that it was the only meal Harry got each day, snacks like sandwiches and biscuits not counting. Still, he was working his ass off in the Black Library, studying journals neither he nor Potter had any right to touch. And slowly Draco had the feeling that he was becoming the lead-expert on antidotes, despite being unable to brew a single one of them to test that theory. It was beyond frustrating.
"Agreed." Harry nodded. "And we will give them back. If they are in his room, it can be his decision if he wants us to use them or not."
Awed, the three wizards starred at the vial the blond had placed in the middle of his granite table before Ron exploded.
Slowly turning around, rubbing the back of his head, where he had just hit wood instead of stone, Harry got up in amazement, watching a door shimmering into existence. It was old and discoloured from potion fumes. The handle was matted, but when the raven-haired wizard reached for it, it opened smoothly. "Thank you," Harry whispered, before pushing the door open to Severus Snape's inner sanctum.
At his command, the librarians started to hustle and bustle about. Scrolls and papers were spread over the table. Books were sorted the whole length of the table. White boards were placed on numerous shelves at the side. Narcissa, Neville and Harry, on the other hand, needed a little longer to regain their composure. How could Harry have ever thought that dusting and a coat of varnish could make any difference … counter magic so vile it saturated everything it came in contact with? Even after their cleaning spree, this room had felt dark and claustrophobic. Now, however, Harry barely recognised it. The black wooden appliances seemed lightened to warm mahogany. The floor was gleaming, nearly polished enough to reflect the cream-coloured ceiling and every piece of fabric, be it upholstery or curtains shone as if new. It was still a dark room, but considerably more inviting than before. The three startled, when Thomas Manson straightened his always impeccable robes and indicated a bow, "Lady Malfoy, I have heard a great many things about your family's library and wanted to ask if I may be so bold and request entry?"
For Draco, however, this was about more than loyalty. Harry needed a friend tonight, and he would be damned if he allowed yet another Weasley to share the raven-haired's bed. Rising he requested, "Now, Hermine, Ron, please be so kind to leave and give me a few minutes, to make sure that your friend is halfway decent for Christmas Eve."
Percy froze when he reached the bottom of the chest. There, a long row of rules and regulations lay assorted. A few of them even predated Salem! With an open mouth - not his most attractive look - he gazed at Lucius wide-eyes, who merely tilted his head and offered, "You are welcome."
"Yes. … No!" Harry was torn. "I … maybe it would be better if I waited a few hours. I can't abandon my job every time something comes up at home. And it's nearly 4 p.m.. Not long before we can call it a day."
Surprised, his father inquired, "What's he doing there? Sirius hated his guts. I doubt that that has changed."
Shrugging, the future Lord Malfoy toyed with a frayed ending in the binding of the book. "She is giving me a chance I never thought I could have after … Voldemort. Astoria is a smart and sensible witch. She'll make a good mother. I consider myself honoured by her offer."
"Lord Malfoy," she curtsied before taking the unspoken invitation and claiming a chair in front of the fireplace. If she recognised the similarities to their last encounter, she did not let it show.
With a faint tint of red on his cheeks, the brunet did not protest, merely tilted his head. He really had come a long way from the scared first year to the 'leader' he had become in seventh year, who had worked the Room of Requirement to keep everybody safe. He had stopped downplaying his achievements and accepted praise when it was due. Still, he would probably never feel entirely comfortable being the centre of attention. So, he glossed over the moment by pulling out his wand, casting, "Lumos!" When the light flared up, he gestured at a clearly ancient passage. "Let's go."
"No," Harry assured immediately. Then, as if to probe an aching tooth to see if the pain got worse, he repeated, "What about Peter?"
The Aurors had just reconvened in what seemed like an out-of-use office with boxes lining the walls when the first tendrils of smoke curled up from cracks between floor and wall.
Watching the horizon and the slowly dying fire, the adults vanished the couches and went into the burrow, to collect their children. Once more, they claimed the places, Arthur had invited them to before. When everybody was present, the patriarch reached out to take Lucius and Harry's hand, waiting for the circle to complete.
You always only looked out for yourself! It's what you do, and the rest of the world be damned! You are clearly going behind Harry's back. I heard you! Don't even try to deceive me! I know you, Lucius!" Inari was bounding from the kitchen to the living-room, but Severus had no desire to think of what had roused the fox this time.
Gazing at his friend and partner in the Auror department, the wizard he trusted with his life in any situation, Neville reached out and turned the map upside down, or upside up more accurately.
"It was Surrey, thank you very much." Harry squabbled. "But I was never expected to cook fancy French meals. Lucky me, the Dursleys were content with chicken and potatoes." After a heartbeat, he realised that he had revealed too much with this simple sentence, but when he looked up, Draco merely met his eyes and got up from the sofa. "Let's get down and enjoy French cuisine then. Kreacher is an excellent cook."
"And you have a problem with that, why? My birthday is in September, my parents and I had time to come to terms with me being a witch. An entire year in fact. But what about people like you? Children with birthdays near September 1
"No, he would not, not even when he walked around in fraying second-hand robes," Lucius replied with a small smile. "But he was entirely agreeable to be paid for his work. Headache-cures, Pepper-Up Potions and certain hair products were always in high demand, and with my help he got quite an operation going. Unofficially of course."
"I didn't mean it that way, I just … bollocks," Harry sighed. "This is hard. We want what's best for him but …"
Severus' hand, brushing over his cheek, was soft and gone after a second as if the Potion Master was unsure if the gesture was allowed. "You are welcome."
When the Malfoys entered the kitchen the next morning, Harry was nowhere to be seen. Confused, Lucius asked for his whereabouts. The elf revealed, while serving breakfast, “Sir is in his office.”
Thinking about his former professor that was like … like thinking of his parents having sex. It was just not done! Shaking his head, Harry mumbled, "I can't imagine Professor Snape … I mean he and mum … just no!"
A little girl, with pigtails down to her pink, frilly skirt beamed up at him and at once dug into the paper bag. Giggling already, she replied, “Thank you, Mister Ron. Have a good day.” When she passed Harry, she smiled brightly, revealing a missing front tooth. “You too, Mister Mister-Ron’s-friend.”
Like it had always been in the Great Hall, things just happened. The house elf had to be in a room with a nearly identical setup, because all of a sudden, the furniture was replaced. But not with new, shiny things. The four-poster-bed had apparently been in use before, as had the desk in the corner. The chair, in front of it, looked well loved, but what made Draco understand, where these things had come from, was the armchair that had replaced the one beside the bed. It was black, and the leather was buttery-soft, and the blond would have recognised it anywhere since he had used it countless times in the past. These were …
Completely taken aback by this coherent, yet slightly awkward phrase - up until now, the little elf had but offered two-word sentences - the young wizard nearly missed, her turning around with a confused look. "Serve what … serve what?" She pondered, still clutching her master's trousers. Yet before Kreacher could offer a suggestion, her face lit up, and she beamed at Harry.
Nodding, Harry handed over the last of his juice, for Ron to wash down the sandwich. Once his best friend was finished, he dived behind the counter and produced a jar of rainbow-coloured candy. “Here, try one.”
“Yes, Sir,” Harry confirmed. “As I said: we are stuck anyway. So no matter what Mr Malfoy tells us, it’s a win-win situation.”
wand since I grabbed it from you at the Manor. You used it to curse objects and hurt people, even attempted murder. Your unicorn-core did not like that and shifted allegiance the moment I took it. Without this shift, I would not have been able to master the Elder Wand you won from Dumbledore. In the end, I was only able to defeat Tom, thanks to this.
Hovering protectively, the elf revealed. "At the place of the evil wizards, Kreacher was exploring, felt the dark magic. Her parents were weak. Dark Wizards had drained them. Kept her hidden, unbound but safe. They put Kreacher in the stove. Only room for two."
"But we're so close!" Christopher Pendragon promised. "We just need a few more weeks to stabilise the formula. I know we're on the right track with these new runes. We just need to tweak the potion a little."
Looking at his boss, the injured wizard declared, "I accept this offer of servitude. Draco Malfoy is mine, from this day forth, until I release him from this vow. Is that official enough for you, Sir?"
Reaching for his hand, the Lady squeezed his trembling fingers, admitting sadly, “And you never will.”
Robarts snapped, “And this is of no concern to you why? If he pleads innocent, we will know he has a hidden agenda!”
day. Since Lucius is the head of his family, I believe that the help of his wife and son are implied in his pledge. Have a good day, Auror Jenkins, and thank you for your cooperation.”
"I can't stay here!" Astoria whimpered, curling into herself. "I can't, I can't, I have to go back!"
Throwing a balled-up napkin at his colleague, Neville growled, "Leave him be. He's muggle-raised and at least tries now."
"If you really think so, Christopher Pendragon, you are an even greater fool than Harry and Draco made you out to be."
"What have I done?" A young witch with a pixie-cut and dusty grey robes emerged from between two bookshelves. "Irma, Mdm Pince, is it my turn already?" Then, she spotted the Aurors and groaned, "Not again."
Slowly pushing back her chair, she approached the Auror. He tensed ever so slightly, clutching her wand. Most people tended to forget that she had been raised a warrior in a war against the dark. That she had fought at Harry Potter's side since she had been twelve years old. Her studious ways and unassuming demeanour worked to her advantage most of the time. She would not hide herself today. Head held high, she requested, "With your permission, Auror Goldsmith, I would like to leave now."
Trading a concerned glance with his family, Lucius offered, “If you wish, I could return to the Manor alone and leave you to your work.”
How anybody could achieve such an artfully tousled look was beyond the Auror. Every time he dragged his fingers through his strands, he only messed them up. Hence the hex Nott's assistant had put on him after her employer had declared him ready to go.
Shoving back from the desk, Draco shot to his feet and spat angrily. "If you don't want me to be … stay here, just say so! I might as well leave!"
"Are we discussing my lack of trust issues again?" When the blond put down the volume, Harry wanted to know. "Aren't you interested in this book?"
Well, that was another can of worms Emilia seemed not prepared to open. Hence, she merely encouraged her patient, "If you judge it safe and Mr Malfoy here has tested it already, I see no harm."
Slowly, … reluctantly, the pureblood pulled back his sleeve, displaying his Dark Mark. "I will never
Opening the book, Harry stared down at the very first house one of his Black ancestors had appropriated from the muggle who had built it. "That's a one-storey building. Just one step up from a shed."
"First of all," Astoria lectured, "The topic being unpleasant for you is by no means a reason to forget your manners. Second, I insist on your dining with us. The meal will be served in about twenty minutes."
Unaware of having frightened the animal, that now made a valiant effort of fusing with Harry's stomach, he promised in a whisper, "I'll get some food for him."
more important than his own. Even Draco - who had been subjugated more than most others - showed more sense of self-worth than the 'Boy Who Lived'. A worrisome tendency, if what the boy's parents and the other Marauders had told him was true.
Seemingly unbothered, the wizard in question repaired his bent glasses and straightened his clothes. Draco's eyes were most certainly not drawn to the happy trail, that led from the raven-haired's navel to the waistband of his jeans. He just wanted to change. The only reason for this conversation were his dress-robes, thank you very much!
"As can be expected, considering the circumstances," Emilia shared while serving herself a cup of tea. "He slept about thirteen hours so far; suffered from nightmares. His mind is still not up to par, to deal with the situation. Our young Mr Malfoy came up with a spreadsheet of topics best to avoid."
"Nothing really," the other wizard shrugged. "It's just as I told you: a monitoring spell has been woven in."
"Ahm," George had watched the exchange with quiet delight. Few people were actually willing to call out his 'not-brother' if he was trying. He had had no clue why Hermione had called for him instead of an Auror, but since Lucius was involved, maybe she had been afraid of bias? Not that George wasn't. He had not forgotten how the Malfoy patriarch had looked down on their family or how he had fought with his father in public. And
Closing her eyes, to ponder on how to phrase herself to make it all the clearer to her patient of how astounding his recovery truly was, she detailed, "You are aware, of course, that the typical wizard can live twice as long as the average muggle. At least in theory."
Not pulling back, though he desperately wanted to, because he recognised the significance of the gesture − Neville had taught him well in pureblood etiquette − Harry took a deep breath and assured, "I know, Lucius, you already do."
"Nothing," the blond tried to deflect but pointing at several vials that were neatly laid out on his desk. "I made some muscle strengthening and nutritious potions. But I'm running low on acai seeds and a few other things."
"Declaring our mutual dislike," Emilia shared, turning towards the door. "I will be back in an hour."
"What by Merlin and Morgana is going on here?" Emilia's voice thundered through the room, with her looming imposingly in the doorway. She looked as if she had fallen out of bed recently and raced from the living-room floo right up to the third floor in one go. After taking but a heartbeat to judge the situation, she cast, "Somnis!" Severus instantly fell asleep. Pulling together the robe she had slipped over her pyjamas, she started to cast a preliminary spell, before demanding with a stern gaze, "Gentlemen, there better be an excellent explanation for why you tried to restraint my hysteric patient! I have a strict working schedule and do not appreciate being called out of bed and home at this hour!"
Looking at the three people he had grown up with through six years of Hogwarts, Harry shook his head. "No, this is exactly where we should begin. You all need to understand that this is coming from someone who had been living and breathing wizarding traditions all their lives."
