"You," he hissed as he threw a quick glance over his shoulder. He grabbed Harry's shoulder to pull him further into light. "How did you get here?"
Harry shook his head – lowering his chin to look into his glass. The pulp of the orange juice swirled to the surface as he tipped his glass to the sides.
"Good." The blonde took his time to scan the grounds, see if there would be anyone around to bother, so he could jump out next. A groan escaped his lips as his heels hit the grass.
'I'm coming,' Draco suddenly groaned out loud – burying his hands in Harry his dark-brown hair. 'I want you, Harry,' he gasped. 'I wanted you the entire time already- Now please... Please, end this.' Another groan squeezed out of his throat. 'I love you.'
Harry tried to open his eyes. Though this took great effort, and the lights seemed to burn his pupils,
"Well, you're a prick," Harry snapped as he turned his back on him. "Besides, I didn't ask for any of this."
"Get your head out of your arse, man," Harry scoffed – wiping the drying tears off his chin. "She is my best friend."
The blonde took his space to rub his eyes, and pulled the sheets close to his chest – leaving Harry naked aside, his cheeks flushing bright red. "Don't-" he growled as he managed to grab a corner, if just to cover his parts. "I didn't dress."
Hermione lifted her brows indignantly, and it appeared that Harry was asking for another hit, again.
"You're a fraud, Snape! I know it! I know you're working with him, all the same! Stop pretending. You're a fucking coward!" A certain force swiped him off his feet, causing Harry to land flat on his back – his glasses popping off, disappearing among the shadows of the space between the walls and bookcases stacked in the hall. "Fuck!"
His voice shut down as he grabbed his towel – turning his head over his shoulder to find the blurry shadow from no red-haired boy called a Weasley, but a white-haired tall guy, his skin as pale it made him forget how to breathe.
Draco's voice had never been so dark and raw before. As if he was changing. Taking a whole other form. Harry stumbled on his feet, his chest heavy and his lungs cramping. Why the sudden distance now they seemed to feed on each other's shame? Wasn't this what they were aiming for? Nutrition for their desperate and lost souls? Harry gritted his teeth, shaking his head as he turned his back on him, and scoffed.
"Is it true?" Neville whispered as he bend his head towards the group. "Did you manage to get Malfoy kicked out of school?" His eyes were glistening by utter excitement.
Harry raised his brows, shocked by his friends confession. "Oh, okay. I see..." Awkward conversation. "And when are you planning on telling Hermione? You better not break her heart."
"So are you," Draco sneered before he rubbed his eyes. "You know you're forced to watch my back. Otherwise he'll snap your head right off. You're weak for wanting more. I am the chosen one. Me! And you needed to become second best."
"Good," the blonde replied softly, moving further down his neck while rubbing the tip of his tongue along his pale skin. A sensitive spot. Harry twitched, and he closed his eyes as he dropped his head in his neck –playing the open card. A moan that escaped his throat unknowingly. And he was caught.
"I'm tired," Harry respond, shaking his head. "I can't eat, I can't sleep. I feel ultimately horrible." He pressed his lips, bowing his head to keep his eyes from watering, "I've done some terrible things, Hermione."
The boy remained still. Just a soft noise of breathing came from under the silver-plated layer. Peculiar, how it looked a lot creepier now they were standing alone in a dark corridor. "Funny, how you decided to pop up every now and then, but still don't have the guts to speak to me. Should I be impressed? Take it off."
"Tell me what you want," Draco muttered – titling his head, his shoulder tensed. He was a lion. Harry cleared his throat, suddenly not as cheeky anymore. "I'm going to bed," he simply replied – his voice as light as air, laced by softness. "It's been most fun," he continued – almost sarcastically. Whatever they were doing, they were doing it wrong.
That night the boys slept in the room of requirements as per use. In fact, the boys were meeting up every following night for at least a week or two straight until each and everyone had gotten back from their holiday - so it was no longer safe. Suspicion grew quick between the halls of Hogwarts, no matter how the acts within the castle were a mystery to many all the same. Ronald took great care of keeping an eye on the brunette, and though Hermione could barely stay in the same room with him for longer than an hour, she tried to do so all the same. As if someone told them to. Harry claimed to be clueless about the acts they'd been suspecting him of, yet he feared they already knew. Ginny wouldn't look him in the eye. Even after two weeks of being apart, she kept her distance as if he was a criminal. Could she have told? Would she have told? As soon as every student arrived back at school, it appeared Draco had disappeared again. Like a ghost, he vanished behind the walls, and his touch remained nothing but a pleasant memory. Though the two didn't have many classes left together, he didn't seem to meet him around. Only every now and then Harry claimed to see him walking around in the corridors, heading down to the dungeons to get to the Slytherin's common room. Harry wished to call after him whenever he caught his eye, yet feared he couldn't for many suspected too much already.
“Stop! Just... stop. I am not choosing Draco’s side over you guys! I don’t want to be his friend! I was doing the right thing because he looked scared. I’m done talking about it now let it go!” Harry cut Ron off harshly.
After dressing he picked up a handful of get-well cards he had made for Ron. His favorite of which was titled “Get well, Wanker.” It gave him a good chuckle writing it, something he needed in a time like this. He placed them carefully in his quidditch bag and navigated his flat until he reached the fireplace.
Within the next few hours, Harry would learn of his friend's paralysis from the waist down. Unable to be healed by magic he would not be able to be the team's keeper.
You run so far from the past, while he’s stuck in it. I shouldn’t give away too much. Just read the clipping.
He placed it gently into his hand cart and continued along, Draco had already bought a plethora of cooking supplies. He hadn’t brought much to his flat when he had packed, so he had to buy them now. With the steady income from his shop, it wasn’t like he didn’t have the money.
Harry felt a cold rush of energy as he splashed water on his face and looked up at the mirror. His hair frizzed and messy from sleep, his eyes wet with grief. He grabbed a brush and began to tackle the challenge of getting his hair to seem somewhat managed.
Both of Harry’s friends looked at him as if they had just been kicked. Harry knew he shouldn’t have snapped but he couldn’t take it. He didn’t even talk to Draco and his friends were already upset.
Harry crawled into one of the beds and pulled the blankets over him. He tried to fall asleep, hoping he wouldn’t wake up screaming as he did sometimes.
Draco’s eyes locked onto Harry’s. Harry hadn’t seen the boy since the trials. He had no idea he’d be back at Hogwarts... not so soon at least. His stomach lurched and he struggled to keep down his food. Hermione nudged him gently and he looked away from Malfoy. She rubbed his back gently, “It’ll be ok, Harry.”
Draco sat with his legs crossed, sipping on a mug of coffee as he flipped through the paper. He had been looking for jobs that pay well for a while. Seeing as he was a former death eater, not many would be willing to hire him.
A clean pair of trousers and a sweater awaited him on his bed. His house-elf Nismy did her best to keep his flat in shape, even with Harry being as messy as he was. She was less of a house-elf and more of a friend, seeing as Harry offered her clothes and she had decided to stay and look after Harry. Like the sister he never had.
“Never.” Draco hissed and spun on his heels. He could always get flour some other time, now he just wanted to get the hell out of there. Of course, Harry didn’t follow him, and Draco didn’t look back. Only for a split second did he wish he could find the courage to just speak to him. But not now… not after everything they’d done, all the history between them. they were enemies on opposite ends of a war, there would be no coming back from that.
He abandoned the mirror and walked back to his living room. Unopened boxes still littered the floor. He really needed to get to unpacking those.
Draco pocketed his wand and carefully finished  unbolting his door. He pulled it open and gulped at the sound of his mother gasping, “Oh Draco I didn’t know if you were awake! How is your morning?”
Once they were in and the coast was clear Ron grabbed Harry by the shoulders, “What the bloody hell was that?” He practically shouted the question.
Draco sighed before taking a tender sip of his coffee and setting it down, “Mother without a job I cannot keep my flat. I can’t afford to spend one second not looking.”
The spot on his pale hand where those well tanned fingers had touched, burned. It burned in a way that made him want to stick his hand in cold water and watch it freeze over.
If he wasn’t paying so much attention to the sounds, he wouldn’t have noticed the slight rap on his door that interrupted the soothing pattering on his windows. He wouldn’t have heard a small envelope slip under his door either.
Draco stared at the letter before he frantically tore it to pieces. The last thing he needed was some sappy school peer to try to get back in touch with him. He didn’t care why the mystery person missed him. He wanted all memories of past Draco destroyed. Burned in the grasp of time until he was all but ashes.
Harry was always far too late or far too early… If only Draco had known that sooner. He wouldn’t be sitting in his flat throwing up with fear. He wouldn’t be haunted with visions of his past. Harry could’ve saved him. But it was too late for that. He just wished he’d come same him now. Because he definitely needed it.
Draco, despite his instincts telling him to shut the door and run, stepped aside for his mother to enter. She stepped in and smiled, looking around the neatly decorated flat, “well. It’s much smaller than our Manor, but you’ve decorated well.”
“The hospital. I’m long overdue to visit Ron.” It was true. He hadn’t seen his friend since he was admitted 2 weeks ago. Not being able to bear to see Ron in and out of a magically induced coma, he stayed home. Now that he was out of coma and doing well, he decided to bring him the cards he had made.
Nismy nodded, “Do be back soon.” She turned to walk towards the kitchen. Harry opened his fist and announced his destination, “Saint Merlin’s Hospital for Witches and Wizards.”
The wax sealed letter was accompanied by a newspaper clipping. He lifted both and set the clipping on his kitchen counter before tearing open the letter. The wax cracked and gave way for a small paper to slip out. Draco plucked it up and scanned it over.
Dammit Harry. This was too soon. It would always be too soon. Draco payed for his items and quickly left. He didn’t break down until he had safely apparated home and locked himself in his flat. His damn hand still burned, he ran it under the sink to no avail. Tears rolled down his cheeks making salty streaks. This was a kind of burn that no amount of water could cure. It was much stronger than any 3rd degree. It was the burning feeling of want. The want to touch Harry’s hand once more. He’d had that burning since his first year of hogwarts, and whenever he saw Harry in the paper, it flared up once again. Draco wiped the tears from his face and rubbed his puffy eyes.
Harry’s eyes darted to his shoes, suddenly finding them interesting, “M’sorry, Ron. I should’ve been there.”
Ron opened his mouth to speak but Hermione beat him to speaking, “Yeah Harry! We hate him remember? He always picked fights with us and he joined Voldemort!”
“You’re wondering why I’m here?” His mother guessed, and it was a bloody good guess because she was spot on. Draco response to the question was a short nod.
Draco didn’t expect anyone to treat him with such kindness, especially not Potter. After everything that happened, he expected the boy to hate him, and he wouldn’t blame him for it. Draco had been a bit of a prick throughout the years and he could admit it. So why? After all, he did to Potter why did he still show him kindness? It made the blonde’s blood boil as he gripped his wand.
“I don’t want a flat mate mother, I want to be alone.” Draco assured her. They were vile lies. He was so cold and alone here. Just going through the schedule everyday, never doing anything different. Never saying good morning to someone or waving them goodnight before they split off to their rooms.
He rapped on the door before slowly opening it. Hermione and Ginny were already sitting at Ron’s bedside.
The knocking continued, growing slightly louder as time passed. So much for having a nice slow paced morning. Draco rushed to the door and went to undo the locks before freezing. A cold chill ran through his body… a chill that grew from the mark on his arm. His body was frozen stiff and Adrenalin coursed through his veins. The first thing he did was grip his wand in hand, the second was peak through the door.
"Draco," Harry gasped as he took his hand. A noise came from Snape's office, causing Draco to kneel down swiftly – dragging Harry to the side behind the bookcase. His slim index finger pushed against Harry's lips; the touch of the blonde creating a pleasant raise in his heartbeat.
Harry scoffed nervously and glanced at professor Snape who'd been listening all along and appeared to show a new kind of emotion: pity.
"Troubled, you are. A fool too." He grabbed Draco by the collar, pulling him off his stool to drag him out of his storeroom. "One more chance, or I will take my measures."
Harry swore his head was about to explode by all the information dropping in - or it was the wideeye potion being given, again, a bit too much. "Malfoy?" Harry stammered as he grabbed Ron by the arm.
Harry moved closer now, still not getting up, and placed his hands on Draco his hips – staring him straight in his gray bright eyes which shown suspicion.
'Scared, Potter?' Draco smirked as he stroked his thumb along his lower lip to get rid of a smear of Harry's blood. He didn't seem to be disgusted by that.
Harry gritted his teeth, his lips turning into a sour line, and before Draco managed to pass his arm length, he gave him a push – causing Draco to topple over and drop his case in vain.
Ron and Hermione were gathered out of bed that morning. Armed with sweets and presents they sat at the end of the bed, waiting for Madam Pomfrey to do her magic. After a small consumption of the wideye potion Harry gradually opened his eyes - waking in the exact same room as last night, though he had forgotten.
"What's with the long face?" Draco smirked – titling his head to the side. Harry couldn't do anything. With his lips parted, and his lungs out of oxygen, his blood started to circulate much slower. Allowing hands to take his jawline, to enclose his features And then it came. The blinding kiss. The touch of skin to skin. And he couldn't move.
Ron didn't respond, probably way too chicken to tell his friend about his love for her. Ridiculous, really, since it had been obvious for quite some time now. Ron bowed his head, ashamed – knowing he knew too.
Dumbledore nodded in silence, pinching his shoulder a second time, and raised to see the crowd. "I thought so," he replied airily. Without another word, he greeted him, and pointed Harry back to his spot. Nothing to worry about. Dumbledore was a wise man, but also rather unusual, and sometimes hard to understand...
Though Harry felt eager to tell about his experiences, he knew he simply couldn't. He had to sort it all out himself first, and the last four months didn't really seemed to have enlightened him. And so, Harry decided to lie with a dash of truth – knowing it would raise a certain suspicion, but of a whole other sort. Safely for Harry to continue his thoughts, and perhaps figure things out.
It was horrible to see Draco like this. Even though he was crowned as one of his biggest enemies, he never meant for this to happen. Though the reason of the beating was still vivid, Harry wasn't even sure whether he really wanted to know it or not. Did his father find out about their business? About his homosexual activities with the one person he wasn't supposed to spend time with? Though Harry was "praised" as the chosen one, the slumbering burden, he wasn't the only one. Draco was forced by the Dark Lord to complete several tasks, being threatened by the death of his family in case he wouldn't proceed. Draco barely meant to become a spoiled brat, but was simply created to – being a part of a pure-blood family tearing his youth apart. The boy without choices. However, Harry didn't know about this. To Harry he was just a boy, praised and tugged to a certain kind of perfection Harry couldn't put his finger on. Yes, he was attracted to him. Or at least it seemed like it, according to the last several months of spending hours a day thinking about him. Though Draco's leaving was one of his darkest desires about a year ago, he now found it one of his deepest fears – knowing he could be gone and treated like shit once he'd vanished from Hogwarts. Harry didn't like the idea of it. He spend most of his youth in his uncle's house, in a cupboard under the stairs, living with the most foulest people of all, and he couldn't forgive himself wishing it to someone else. Not to Draco, at least – wherever he would end after this.
"I want you to think and believe I am making the right decision." Draco still looked at him, his chest moved smoothly. He seemed calm, and confident. Harry, on the other hand, could hardly breathe – and found it hard to cope with whatever was going on. "What decision?" Harry asked rather confused. He wasn't easily caught off guard, having the history of dealing with great suffering and straitened situations. "This," Draco replied – approaching him full of confidence.
"I want you," Harry stuttered – pulling Draco's roots before he pushed up his hips, allowing Draco to get a glimpse of his physical state. Draco buried his face in his neck, biting his skin before he rubbed tight against his trousers; gasping as he closed his eyes.
"I swear, if you are lying I'll be breaking your freaking arm," Harry dug his nails inside Ronald's flesh.
"Stop it!" Harry yanked his hand away - drawing his wand as he took his position. "I want answers. From you, from Professor Dumbledore..." Harry drew a breath - his eyes glistening with pain and adrenaline. "I don't think I deserve this."
'Fuck,' Harry cursed – biting his lower lip, squeezing out a groan. 'Faster, please... I beg you. We are going to get busted-' A lie, obviously, suddenly blaming the world for the fact Draco had so speed up his pass. The blonde smirked and started to lick the skin even slower now – narrowing his eyes suspiciously as a way of teasing. Harry groaned again and clenched his fingers around the edge of the desk as well now, suddenly realizing why Draco did that before. This all gave such tension, his muscles all started to straighten.
As he put them on again, he glanced around while trying to get on his feet. Curiously he thumbed his eyes along all the strange objects near him, and it didn't take long for him to realize he'd end at the exact same spot like he had years ago. Borgin and Burkes. Harry swiftly moved forward to get out of the store as quickly as possible, knowing he supposed to meet Hermione and Ron in Diagon Alley instead of Knockturn Alley, yet something blocked his way right before he got the change to pop up from behind a storage cabinet. Mr Borgin came out of the room that was attached to the store – probably linking to a space he stayed whenever he had no costumers coming around. He snorted dissatisfied, patting his dirty hands against his trousers, and he glanced through the shop suspiciously since he'd apparently hear Harry shoving over the ground when he got spit out by the flames. This caused Harry to gasp and quickly turn his heels to find a hiding spot elsewhere. Finding – what he thought to be – the same closet he'd seen years ago, he quickly moved towards it and hid himself between the poking brooms to keep Mr. Borgin from finding him. He didn't want the people here to know he was here. No one had to know about his little accident, and he didn't feel like talking to that filthy man of a Borgin.
Draco batted his eyes, holding his arm as if he was afraid it was about to fall off. He shrugged, his lips pressed into a sour line – as if his mommy told him he couldn't get another cookie right before dinner. "Dude, tell me. What happened to you?"
Harry dropped his head, scoffing to himself as he rubbed his hands together – ready to claim his remark on Draco's silence. But then he kissed him, and Harry allowed. Draco dove on top, nailing Harry down to the bed with a slow and steady pace. He loved every single moment of it. Harry longed to ask for more. No matter Draco seemed nearly started with his actions; Harry couldn't wait to ask for more. And so he did. His hands guided down his hips – grabbing the hems of his cardigan so he managed to pull it upwards, removing it from the blonde's body. Draco hesitated. For a second he seemed to be forgotten of what he was doing, yet recharged straight after – helping him all the same by unbuttoning his blouse from the top; giving Harry the opportunity to get rid of his own. Their bodies met. The buttons of their trousers tangled up as Harry pulled him up close – and their lips burst together into a passionate, longing kiss; a rush of adrenaline and arousal fulfilling their bodies, for there was no more trouble to be afraid of.
"When will we tell?" Ron muttered – his white lashes covering his olive eyes. Hermione clacked the heels of her shoes against the tiles, shaking her head – allowing her brown curls to cover her peachy cheeks. "Soon," she replied softly. "Harry will notice, sooner or later."
"I'm perfectly fine," Harry replied after he sighed. He threw her a look. "Don't you have to study?"
Draco didn't reply. He squeezed his eyes together, pensively, until he grabbed the brown-haired boy's cock; enclosing his lips around it. For ten (eternal lasting) seconds he gave him the impression of what giving head felt like, and Harry moaned in return – his body shivering under the blonde's touch.
"Malfoy?" He was clever enough not to call his first name again – knowing he'd rarely (to never) do that. His palms got sweaty, and nervousness caused his heart to go crazy. "Are you sure?"
"I want you to go!" he shouted – his breath irregular. "My father is going to kill me," his voice betrayed his worries. He was scared. If his father found out about this, not only Harry would be dangling on a string, but Draco too. How disgraceful it was to come out defenseless – a shame for his family. His bloodline.
"Most likely," Ronald replied, shaking his head in despair. Hermione grabbed her books, scanning through her finished assignments – ready to deliver, the rush doing her good. Ron looked at her – though staring was a better description. Though Harry opened his mouth, talking about homework and whatnot (something he obviously didn't finish) he noticed his absence.
"So are you," Harry muttered under his breath – watching Ron stuffing his mouth, as usual. Ron barely noticed his presence, creating a heavy feeling within his guts.
Harry grabbed the back of his head, rubbing it as he tried to get up – his spine trembling now he seemed to have hit a nerve. "Fucking piece of-"
~ The door slammed shut. Harry rubbed his left cheek, burning with heat, cursing as he kicked the door.
"I've been working out," Draco replied with a smug smile, fetching something from the deep of his pocket.
"You're at the hospital wing, Harry. You've had a little concussion." Hermione smiled down on him, happy to see him in a better state. He seemed calm now. Secured.
A hitch in Harry's voice got audible, and his cheeks turned red immediately. "What did you just say?" He slowly pulled back and stared at him now, seeing how the familiar cheeky, handsome grin appeared on his face.
"I'm done," Harry muttered – trying to keep his face straight with anger, though his lips started to tremble and his eyes began to water. "I'm done with you." He took a big breath before he turned his back to him, pulling the sheets over his head. "I want you to go," he gritted through his teeth – waiting for the weight to leave the bed. Though a silence fell, he could not feel the blonde leave.
It appeared that even these remarks couldn't bother Harry now. A smirk crossed his blood-drained lips, and he allowed his own hands to discover some parts of Draco's body now. Immediately they slipped under Malfoy's cardigan, and remarkably enough Harry highly seemed to like what he felt there. His fingertips followed the abs that were hidden beneath the cotton of his white shirt. The feeling of a strong, warm, male body made Harry's blood stream quicker through his veins. He was lucky that his nose had stop bleeding already. It hadn't take long. Would it be broken? Or just bruised? The thoughts were quickly lost, though. Before Harry knew so, Malfoy nipped at his collar bone - he'd opened the first three buttons of his shirt already - and another groan escaped his throat as he rushed his hand through Draco's blonde hair. He messed it up, purposely. Softly he pulled his roots, making sure he did not hurt him, and after another brief groan, he pulled back to push his lips onto his now. During biting in Draco's lower lip teasingly, he searched for the first few buttons from his shirt - leaving the tie alone himself. However, soon enough, after kissing Draco's neck repeatedly also, he realized he wasn't as outgoing as he was. He didn't dare to do more. Not yet. He was insecure, or inexperienced - though probably just as much as Draco was. Did this mean after all Draco had more guts than he had? Or was it just in the subject of making-out, snogging, showing off your sexual frustrations, etcetera?
"You're a big boy," Harry stated - pushing himself up from the floor with his elbows. Draco bit down his lower lip, seeming as if he felt rather pissed, yet pulled the brunette up by his arm - pushing him forcefully against the desk. His hands moved further down Harry's hips, and with his mouth closed he touched the edges of his own teeth with his tongue - making sure they all were covered with saliva. "Don't talk," he continued after.
"Off ye' go," Hagrid muttered as he softly pushed them forward. "He'll be fine ye 'no? Nothin' to worry about-"
Draco his smirk faded, and he turned out to be more serious now. In seconds he turned, plucking their jackets and ripped shirts from the ground, and snorted as he straightened his back.
It was obvious. Draco appeared from behind a corner, and seemed to be pretty beaten up. Harry cocked his head, surprised by his finding, and raised his brows – his question stuck to the back of his tongue.
"No, no!" Ronald choked with fear of being misunderstood. He continued about his love for her, as a best friend, some sort of sister and whatnot. Harry was meant to listen, but couldn't. His scar started to sting, giving him a tormenting headache, and he got drawn to the Slytherin table as if something was luring after him. Someone was staring at him.
Harry turned his head, looking back over his shoulder – staring at the blonde spooning him, holding him close. His breathe felt real and pleasantly warm against the skin in his neck. So did his arms around his waist. How couldn't this be real?
Draco looked up, smiling from ear to ear, walking straight up to the brunette; crushing his lips onto his for he seemed to have missed him too. Harry eased under his touch, gently grabbing his face to pull him closer – the taste of him sweet as ever on his tongue. He forgot all about the question, looking Draco straight in the eye once their lips broke, and he smiled. "I've missed you," he confessed. The blonde batted his eyes, a modest, genuine smile crossing his lips as he reached out to hold his hand.
Harry bit his lip, watching the boathouse from afar – for a split second reconsidering his actions. Looking at his feet he realized he didn't have much more to lose. He could either be happy or disappointed for going – and if he wouldn't, he would be so all the same. Harry considered this his last call. At one point he would have to continue living his life anyways. Especially since other danger still played with his life like all was just a game. He couldn't allow this to ruin him before all that even worked out. He was chosen, and probably meant to act that way. Harry growled. The thoughts of letting him go stung his heart. If he only didn't have to...
He thumbed the tip of his tongue along his chapped lips, and looked at his roommates – forcing a smile on his face as he got up from bed. "Excuse me."
'I'll burn down everything you like,' Draco corrected himself while panting now – his cheeks turning even more red.
Draco didn't reply. He could only look at him, full of hatred as the red substance ran down his cheekbone.
He, like the fragrant taste of rain, both destroyed and delighted him. For far too long he hadn't been able to enjoy his presence, yet now he was back everything seemed to be so much different. He took his glasses, rubbing his eyes before he took a rest against the wall – looking outside the window, trying to ease his mind with the view.
Draco dug his nails into his skin, sucking him long and intensely – his tongue flicking gently along his tip; making sure he would feel it in his entire body. Harry groaned, cursing under his breath – his fingers pulling the blonde's roots as the tickles in his stomach grew stronger. Draco knew he wouldn't last for long if he continued. He could taste his pre-cum gradually filling his mouth.
Harry cursed under his breath, yet allowed Draco to open the gate once more. Once entering – with second thoughts – he squeezed his eyes as they entered a dark, cozy room, torches inflaming once their entrance closed.
"Are you alright, Harry?" Luna asked after a long silence. Harry gave her a look, smiling faintly. "You look rather pale. Has it anything to do with Ron and Hermione?"
"You've missed quite a lot of classes. Your roommates have been so kind to inform me that you've been hardly sleeping in your own bed."
"I slept fine," the blonde replied, showing off his gums – no longer wielding the innocence of a child. "Did you?"
Draco chuckled under his breath, looking down at the boy as if he was ridiculing him all along. "Never mind." He walked around the office, grabbing bits of this and that - coming back with a bottle labeled as alcohol.
Draco widened his eyes, cocking his head, frowning after. It was only then that he finally realized how something bumped against the bare skin of his abdomen.
It wasn't until the next morning that Madam Pomfrey decided to wake Harry up again. After a small rain-check they decided it would be best if Harry'd wake up alone - maybe two friends to accompany him while recovering from his head trauma. Truth to be told, the big crowd was never meant to be there. It just happened for them to sneak in anyway. Hogwarts students truly had their own set of rules lined out when it came to friends. Slughorn came in early this morning, accompanied by professor Sprout telling the nurses he brewed a new wideye potion for Harry's concussion. He, however, claimed for them to use the potion with great care and less expanse - knowing it could do more harm than good if used wrongly. Madam Pomfrey made sure to show her disbelieve, unable to accept Slughorn's concern since she'd been a well-known and respected nurse at Hogwarts for years. Slughorn had simply huffed and waved before he shuffled back towards his office. He cared, but not enough to make a great deal about it.
Mr. Borgin slowly sauntered through the shop, looking for the cause of the sounds, and he stood still staring down at the mess in front of the fireplace. Someone came in there through there... Someone who'd disappear just as quick as he or she arrived.
Draco took Harry's hand, slowly dragging him along while he studied him from tip to toe. "Are you all alone?"
Hermione sighed another time, and lowered her book now - gently brushing her fingers along the cover of it because she apparently seemed to care for it, especially after the hits.
"What?" Harry shook his head, his eyes boiling up with tears. An immediate headache causing a lack of breath. "Why the... What about what we said before? What about fuck everyone else! We are who we are right? What fucking changed! What did I do!?"
"Who has seen Draco?" Harry asked as students past by in a rush to get to their class on time. "Draco Malfoy, anyone?"
Draco curled the corner of his mouth, twisting the ring on his index finger – seeming to feel awfully pleasant. "You deserve it. The pain." He paused, looking down at his chosen one. "You started this."
Harry grabbed him by the hair, gently but firm, and made him continue before he closed his eyes to relax. "You take it."
It seemed like the practice was cut off, knowing everybody was a little of guard for whatever reason possible. Harry had his own, resulting for him to wander around the castle with no particular goal ahead. Harry felt disgusted. His breath seemed sour, and he hadn't been shaving for days. His hollowed eyes gave him the impression he hadn't sleep for days. He wanted to visit Professor Snape. Draco's blood was still on his hands, if not under his nails, and he felt sick thinking about it. It was only later that afternoon he found Snape wondering through the halls of the second floor.
Draco bit his lip, staring down his shoes. "I-" he started pensively. He looked up at the ceiling, swallowing away his pride. "I can't do this anymore, Harry. The thought of being pointed at- it..." he took a deep breath, "...it's just too much." Draco looked up, walking a little closer to see the confusion in Harry his eyes.
"Get him out of my face!" Goyle barked as he forced his eyes shut. Harry backed off, pensively scratching the back of his head – hiding his cold hand down the edges of his oversized jumper.
"Don't you tell me this isn't what you've been wanting all along." Wiping his tears he backed off – his face as sour as it could be, no matter the butterflies blooming up in his stomach.
He shouldn’t have come back... but Hogwarts was his home. Even after all that’s happened, he couldn’t bring himself to just leave. So, he picked himself up and he marched through that door. And the moment his eyes met potter’s; he immediately regretted his decision.
Even his own friends stared in shock. Draco seemed to pay no attention to the gesture. They continued eating silently as if not acknowledging each other's presence. As time passed students began to feel more at ease. Some even moved to sit closer. Ron and Hermione took a seat next to Harry. Harry knew his reputation would never recover fully from this action, but Harry didn’t care about his reputation. He cared about doing what was right. Even if that meant making some rude git feel a little bit better. Harry by no means wanted to be the boy's friend. Every bone in his body hated Draco for what he had done but deep-down Harry knew Draco didn’t have much of a choice, and when it came down to it here, they both were. The war was over and Harry was going to make a point of it.
Ron furrowed his brows, “Why are you all acting like I’m dead. I’m right here! Paralyzed yeah, but not dead!” He crossed his arms angrily. His arms and head seemed to be the only thing he could move.
“Draco. You’ve been struggling for so long. I will not sit by and watch your search if you never peruse.  At least audition for this! It could be good for you.”
Draco had always only been a Seeker. In fact, he wasn’t sure if he could be a Keeper. Sure, he’d seen his teammates do it. And while sitting in on many practices he knew the rules and strategies down to the last letter. However, to try out for a professional team was something Draco had never thought of.
“One month, Draco. I will return in a month.” She stood and slowly walked to the door, all while her son stared at her in a mixture of shock and anger. Narcissa sighed and looked back at Draco, “It’s for your own good.”
The houses felt empty and lonely. Every night when Harry returned to the beds, he found himself looking for familiar faces, only to remember that those faces were gone and wouldn’t come back. Not even Ron or Hermione could save him from his night terrors. Visions of the dead haunt him in his sleep. Every night the war replays his mind like a song on repeat. A really filthy song, so loud it drowns out every joy he's ever felt.
“Bloody hell Harry, I’m just taking the piss out’ve you. Anyway, the team and I decided something. As much as I’d love to, I obviously can’t play quidditch anymore...”
Draco was shopping at a wizarding grocer. His hand skimmed a line of spices and herbs as he decided which one to buy. He was never truly into cooking, but there was always time to learn. He settled on a common magical spice known as dragon’s breath. His personal cooks used it often when they cooked for him. It was certainly spicy, but nothing Draco couldn’t handle.
Narcissa looked at the paper before meeting Draco’s eyes, “If such is the case, I have a job to offer you.”
Hermione shrieked from her spot on the bleachers and ran down the stairs and out onto the field. Tears streaked her face as she kneeled to her boyfriend's side, “Ron, get up! Get up!” She clasped his hand in hers.
A slight glimmer caught his eye and he looked towards it. There was the charm, still bright and shining. With a sigh he started towards it and bent over to pick it up. It felt cold in his hands, it was comforting against his bruises. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to remember the past.
The team landed their brooms and crowded around their injured friend, worried he could be paralyzed or worse. Dead. Harry gulped and pushed through the crowd. He held back tears as he looked down at his best friend. The other team bowed their head in condolences as the referee rushed to call a medic.
The wax cracked apart easily as Draco opened the letter. He pulled out the paper and was surprised to find it had been sprayed with cologne. A cologne he recognized all too quick. It smelt like Harry. The thought made him shiver in disgust as he looked down at the beautifully written words. No doubt done in black ink and written by a feathered quill.
Draco shook his head as the burning engulfed his body. Those flames were caused by that bloody man. He quickly turned off the TV and groaned. His daily routine had officially been obliterated. His brain craved structure, the lack of such things made the sick in his stomach grow.
Days have been difficult recently. I, like you, have found myself lost in the world. These letter to you are the only thing grounding my feet to the soil. My head floats higher and higher each day until the fog clogs my head. Anyway, I’ll stop being poetic and just get to the point of this letter.
Draco groaned and kicked his counter. His toes curled in pain so he kicked again and again until he couldn’t feel them anymore. Until that burning pain turned to numbness.
The tv was nothing but background noise as he sat on his couch. What a horrible day. What a disgusting day. He clenched his fist and dug his nails into his palms.
He had traitor hands. Bloody treason. Draco pulled back his hand from his mothers grasp and sighed, “I don’t need one. I’m doing just fine here alone.”
He peeled it open, cracking the wax in the process. Now that it was open he could pull out the delicate paper it contained. His hungry eyes grazed over the paper.
Harry turned around and walked towards the boys sleeping quarters. Ron followed quickly, trying to stop him. Hermione crossed her arms, “Harry you know I’m not supposed to be in the boys sleeping quarters. I can’t follow you.”
Draco had decided today he would unpack. He awoke early in the morning to birds chirping and warm sunshine on his face. After rubbing his hands over his tired eyes and stretching he managed to pull himself out of bed. Once his sheets were thrown off and he stood, the cold air of his flat assaulted him. It made him want to crawl right back into his bed. He shook off the feeling and opened the sliding door of his closet.
It was true. The letter wasn’t worth it, but his mind still floated back to it. Distracting himself by cleaning didn’t work, his house was pretty much spotless anyway. A hot shower didn’t seem to break the stream of thought either.
In which Draco finally comes around to taking care of himself and unpacking. With this new sudden energy he might just come around to opening the next letter.
The subtle thought caught him off guard and he sat upright. His hands searched for the small hand trinket only to find it wasn’t in his pocket. He furrowed his brows and stood up to look for it. Draco checked under his couches and chairs, by his sink and in his backyard. Only to find he hadn’t dropped it anywhere and he had in fact left it on his bedside table.
“Mother?” He asked curiously as he watched her take the paper and fold in gently. She set it on the table before turning towards her son.
Ginny’s eyes welled up with tears, “He’s not my boyfriend. He is no longer the man I fell in love with and it’s your fault. I will never forgive you.”
Your youth was kind to you, Draco. It doesn’t take a detective to see you’ve pushed it so far away. You converse with no one from your childhood, and stray from any reminder of your pain. Can I truly blame you though? If I was in your position, I’d like to forget too. No one saw it that way though, did they? They judged your actions before taking a second to question why you did them.
It was a interview with Harry Potter, of course it was. Today was going so bloody horrible. First his mother, then the letter, now this.
There was no trinket today so he threw it all away and walked to his couch. He wasn’t hungry for lunch… maybe watching TV would give him an appetite. With the remote in hand he flicked it on and the screen turned bright.
And then the doors swung open. Harry’s eyes darted up to the sight as a platinum blonde boy stepped into the hall. He seemed taller, and less pale than the last time Harry had seen him. His fork clattered onto his plate; he didn’t remember dropping it.
Narcissa shook her head, “I simply will not allow it. You will find a flat mate by the end of this month or I am moving in with you.”
And Harry was slowly reestablishing himself in his life... He looked down at his bleeding palms and sighed.
He decided he’d go to bed early today. The sun was still high in the sky but he curled under his sheets anyway. He’d just have to learn to cook some other day. He had plenty of time.
“As much as I appreciate the gesture, Mother. I could not ask such things of you. I would prefer to stand on my own two feet and take care of myself.”
“And as much as that breaks my heart. I will still support the team...” His eyes began to well up with tears and he looked away, unable to speak.
Instead, I offer you information on someone you’ve pushed much too far away. Make sure you read the newspaper clipping that accompanies this letter. It holds that information that I will not disclose in this letter. I fear if I do you’ll stop reading and turn away.
The entire time they sat and ate was filled with uncomfortable silence. Draco didn’t know whether to speak, be angry, or thank Harry. Students' eyes burned holes in the back of Draco’s head and as much as he appreciated Potter’s gesture, he’d rather not have more attention than necessary. So, when the boy finished his food and left, followed by his friends, Draco let out a sigh of relief.
Sadly, I don’t offer you a memory today, though I think you’ll find that a relief. You seem to not be fond of the past. Can I truly blame you?
What the hell was Potter’s problem? He would’ve been fine on his own so why did Potter sit with him? To rub it in? To make him feel guilty. Draco rolled his eyes. He didn’t need the boy's kind gesture; he didn’t care what his motives were.
He made it back to the Slytherin’s quarters and walked to the bathroom. Upon inspecting himself in the mirror, he determined the slap wouldn’t leave a mark. Now all he had to focus on was soothing the pain. He turned on the faucet and let the water turn to a cool but not freezing temperature before soaking a rag in it. He pressed the wet rag against his face and sighed.
“There. Now I won’t loose it and I can move on.” He rolled his eyes and decided it was about time for lunch. His stomach rumbled as if to agree.
He had a sneaking suspicion this wouldn’t be the last of the letters. With a grunt he left his memories on the floor and trudged to bed. Perhaps tomorrow would treat him with more kindness.
“Harry, if you don’t eat your food will get cold.” Hermione waved her hand in front of Harry’s eyes, causing them to flick back his plate.
Draco had never really been fond of the golden couple's relationship. He couldn’t quite understand why. Something about it just didn’t sit right with Draco, though he did nothing to sabotage them. Despite what some of his friends used to think, he wasn’t constantly obsessed with Potter and trying to ruin his life. He had better things to be doing sometimes.
I think you’ll find the contents of the jewelry box to be a nice trip down memory lane. You shouldn’t forget who you were Draco. Don’t abandon him too. Not like everyone else did. I’ve learned to happily embrace the youth we shared. It’s not so bad once you remember it's all in the past. I promise.
“The name he tarnished.” Draco hissed which received a glare from his mother. The harsh look caused Draco to stiffen once more and grow quiet.
“Yeah actually! Living  alone gets boring. I hate to say it but I almost miss the constant sight of people.” Harry’s voice was soft… warm. Draco’s cold hands grabbed at the cloth of his pants for warmth. Narcissa’s words floated back to his memory. Harry needed a roommate…
The boy who lived had been his enemy to the bitter end. The paper he had read last night invoked a thought in him. What if it had been different? What if Harry had taken his hand that day. He had no doubt his life would be much different. Draco rubbed his bruises and sighed. He was tired. Not just a bodily tired, his very soul ached for sleep.
Harry sighed and began to chew the food and swallow it. It felt flavorless and unsatisfying. Just warm lumps of nothingness. It made Harry want to spit the food back up but he forced himself to swallow anyway. He was hungry, After all.
The poor boy hadn’t even noticed Harry was in the same aisle. It was only when Draco got on his tippy toes to reach a bag of flour on the top shelf, that he felt a hand brush his. He quickly pulled back his hand as if he had been burned and turned to complain at the other man, “Watch where your bloody hands go-“ his words snapped off as his eyes fell on curly locks of brown hair and a lighting scar.
He set the rag aside and lied down on the bed. Not bothering to get changed or pull the covers over him. He was far too tired and too stressed for that. Classes would start up again tomorrow. He needed plenty of rest so he could annoy Potter fully and effortlessly.
His dishes were washed and dried before being put away. He currently only had a few dishes out, most of his cabinets were empty due to the lack of unpacking. But today that changed, he set his mind to it.
The Great Hall felt empty with the lack of students. Even when every student showed up to eat it was barely half full. Looking over the empty seats made Harry’s fist tighten around his fork, which was once again picking at his food.
He was so very wrong. Draco awoke with an ache in his back, and wandered to the kitchen for a soothing cup of tea. But as soon as it went down, he ran straight to the bathroom to throw it back up. Maybe he was sick? But he didn’t feel hot. This was a different sick.
Of course, his mother had forgotten to mention one tiny fact. The team contained many of Hogwarts students Draco once knew. One of which includes Harry Potter.
She looked down almost saddened, “But I could help you pay for it, Draco... My money is your money.”
At least he had a job. That seemed to ground him into reality. Draco was the proud owner of a well running potion shop. Even his shifty reputation couldn’t change the fact he was best in the business. Buyers flocked to his shop daily. Between owl orders and custom potion requests Draco always had his hands full.
After about 10 minutes of indecision, Draco was dressed in a loose black tee tucked into black skinny jeans. Nothing super classy, but he still looked presentable. His hair however, was currently not presentable. It took a lot less time to tackle that hurdle and wash his face.
The three looked at each other quietly before Ron spoke again, “I put out an ad for a new keeper already... Lots have applied to audition. Many people would give the world to play with the world's best Seeker.” He was referring to Harry.
There was no use holding grudges over something Harry wanted so desperately to forget. So, he ate until his plate was empty, then he stood once again. This time Draco’s eyes followed him as Harry walked out the door followed by his friends. They walked slowly down the halls until they got to the Gryffindor house.
“Ron, look out!” Ginny cried out a moment too late as the ball collided against Ron’s chest. A blood-curdling howl of pain froze everyone in their tracks as Ron plummeted 15 feet. It didn’t quite register to Harry what had just happened until Ron hit the ground without a cry of protest or pain.
Draco sat on the floor of his flat. It had only been a few days since he’d moved from the Malfoy’s manor. Boxes still laid strewn about the floor where he sat. There were still so many he hadn’t opened yet, and quite frankly Draco didn’t feel like opening them. Unpacking would be equivalent to admitting his youth was over and it was time for a new phase of his life. Draco was stuck in a void. He had shut out his past entirely, yet refused to move on. So where did that leave him? Drifting in nothingness.
It’s reassuring to see you finally leaving your manor behind. This letter has been collecting dust for far too long. It took a few days but as you can see, I found your address easily. Don’t be concerned, for I mean you no harm.
Draco had to admit, although his mother was sweet, she could be terrifying when she tried. He swallowed his pride and nodded, “Very well.”
“No no. I wanted to talk about something else,” Her voice was soft as she set down her purse and gently patted next to her on the couch, “come sit.”
He couldn’t do this anymore. He couldn’t take the pain, or the loneliness. The letters were too much. They grew more painful by the day. His mother was a monster who loomed over him.
A sudden shriek caught his attention. Upon listening closer he realized it had only been Potter’s. The school had been so quiet it would be hard not to hear a scream, even from across campus. Draco almost felt guilty. He too suffered from night terrors from the war. No doubt Harry had gotten the worst of them.
“I wasn’t exactly looking for your forgiveness, Weasley.” Draco couldn’t help but let his voice slip at the end. Not dating? The golden couple had broken up, how was that his fault? “Seems like a personal matter to me, now please leave me alone. I don’t need to know who your snogging and who you’re not.”
Just one last trip. He’d let this mysterious memory writer take him on one last trip down his past before he forgot it all for good. It would hurt, he knew it would.
Without a second thought he slammed his fingers in the register before bending down and picking it up. He didn’t fumble again for the rest of the day.
He grabbed a handful of Floo powder and raised his hand. Nismy looked up at Harry with a tilted head, her flowery dress swished tenderly, “I’m sorry Harry, but Nismy must inquire where you are going before breakfast?”
Draco swiveled towards the door and tilted his head. It was Sunday. There wasn’t post on Sundays. He rose slowly, carefully and approached the envelope. It was crisp white with a red wax seal. He wondered how it didn’t seem to have a single drop of rain on it.
Who would want to reach out to him? How long had they waited? Why him of all people? He shoved the questions to the deepest part of his mind as he rose out of bed. He pulled on a clean white button up and black skinny jeans. Draco wore this outfit so often it was practically his uniform by now.
Also I wrote this chapter on my phone, and autocorrects a bitch. I’ll try my best to proofread but without a beta reader it’s a bit difficult <3
In the kitchen Draco grabbed down a bowl and began to make a fruit salad. He figured it would be enough to satisfy him without angering his stomach. He missed being a boy and not having to worry about what he ate… he shouldn’t think that.
It was when he recycled his last box that the letter slid under his door. Draco froze in his tracks, looking back at the white envelope sealed with red wax. So the mystery writer had struck again? He had no interest in reading it. He picked it up and set it on his kitchen counter before groaning and flopping down on his couch.
He was a lost cause. A broken boy. Joy seemed like a distant memory, always just out of his reach. At least his friends stuck with him. Through his vent sessions and complaints, through all the tears and fits of fear. They were there to remind him to eat when he was lost in thought and scratching his plate with his fork.
Remember soaring on a broom, high above the ground? I think that was my favorite part of quidditch. Not the seeking, the scoring, or the keeping. I loved the flying. The feel of the wind in my face as I race through the pitch. The boots and hollers if the ground as their team scores.
Harry had cried for nights but it had been for the best. Ginny wanted to move on from the War and Harry seemed to always dwell in the past. She had promised they could still be friends, but it was awkward. Harry’s heart still felt as if it had been torn from his chest and it had been months.
It was the first game of the season. The referee held his wand in the air, and with a shout launched a bright flare into the sky, indicating the beginning of the match. The snitch had not yet been released and Harry was circling the arena.
Narcissa cleared her throat as she entered the room. He only visited his mother’s manor very rarely. Seeing as he couldn’t bear to see the house he’d grown up in, but after his father’s death it had become harder to step foot in what once was his home. His mother took the paper from his hands.
That brings me to your next memory. Year two, when you started seeking. How did it feel? Did you do it for fun or just to one up Harry? Was it for the feeling of flight or the thrill of the hunt? How much did it hurt to watch Harry win when all odds were against him?
Draco set down the letter as a tear rolled down his cheek. It had hurt. Draco should’ve won. But he’d been nothing but a blind boy, too caught up on chasing Potter to ever care about any snitch. He’d shut the memory out for so long he’d never truly allowed himself to feel bitter about it.
There was already a line out to the street in front of it. Draco really did need to work on expanding his shop to fit more people, he was sick of seeing lines outside even when he was open.
“Not remotely,” Malfoy frowned at him. “And the first thing you need to do is stop that sort of negative self talk, Potter. I’m no mind Healer, or life coach - I’m not even your friend, although I think that’s something we could change, if we wanted. My point is, I’m neither professionally obliged nor socially obliged to get involved with your sexual identity crisis, let alone be qualified to do so. I’m just a simple merchant,” Harry snorted and Malfoy’s lips quirked briefly. “But I know people, and I know sexuality, and I know
Harry pulled Draco back in for a cuddle. “Give it some time, and I’m sure you’ll soon be wishing you were doing something dangerous instead of this as well.”
Gems rattled into the hourglass, and Draco extracted himself from Potter’s grasp momentarily. From the relative safety of the buffet table, Draco nibbled on a vol-au-vent and watched Potter manipulate his audience. Was that what he was doing to Draco, as well? Potter caught his eye, and winked at Draco. He felt warm, and a little giddy. Perhaps he was manipulating him, but to what end? Potter was neither political nor ambitious, unless he had an incredibly obscure and slow moving plan in action. And should he be appointed by Scrivener as his replacement at some future point, well it was hardly the worst thing that could happen. Frankly, as long as Scrivener was out of the way Draco didn’t give a fuck who he worked for, and he had been silently preparing himself for the prospect of Potter as Undersecretary since his third week in the department.
“I thought you and Ginevra split up.” Malfoy’s voice is tight. He loads another deposit of pumpkin on the duck, and this time gets it into Ted’s mouth in one go.
“So you’re using a veto for Smith?” Harry glared until Draco struck the pen through the name with a dramatic flourish. “Fine, consider him excommunicated.”
He sent the memo fluttering away, and pulled a roll of parchment closer to him. Draft regulations for the proposed national Exploding Snap championships. They promised to be both long and tedious. Draco smiled again, and dipped his quill in green ink. He loved his job.
“I’m sorry,” Draco burst out, rubbing his hands over his eyes. “I don’t know how to do this, alright? I’ve never had to do this before. Never wanted to.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, only slightly hoarsely, as he busied himself taking a set of latex gloves out of a drawer. “You don’t need to stay. It was good of you to make the delivery, but I’d hate to keep you from your plans.”
Harry grasped for his glasses, eyes weary and dry. Once on, he became properly aware of the sheer debauched state of his bedroom. Last night's outfit was piled on the floor in front of the full length mirror, which was spattered with come, no less, and there was a greasy handprint (probably lube) on the glass as well, and quite a bit more of both on the sheets of his bed. The duvet was a mound on the floor. He was nude in his bed, which was not how he normally preferred to sleep - if there was an emergency in the night he had to be ready to leap into action without his bits flying around all over the place and getting in the way. No - he always wore pants, at the very least, and had pyjamas at hand. Sleeping nude felt naughty, especially the sort of nude he was right now. Sticky, and a bit red in places that didn’t bear thinking about. God, if there
“Are you sure?” Blaise eyed off the bags again, clearly desperate to know what was in them. “Rumour has it you’re a bit of a shopping addict.”
"What's the point? I can't get the damned thing out by myself, I don't know how. And I can't go to the infirmary for treatment until it gets infected and swollen and they have to lop off my whole arm. What's the good of you
Malfoy stood beside him, nodding. “Agreed. It’s consistent with the wand movements for the most common spell for these kinds of sex toys - the Muggle sort, I mean. Some customers get off on the novelty of it, the Muggle element is part of their kink. But most want enhancements that are built in with wizarding toys. There’s a standard kit of charms that most vendors will throw in with the purchase of a Muggle toy, for a few extra sickles.” Malfoy’s shoulder was almost touching Harry’s. “That right there, the slightly furry looking bit?” Malfoy ran a fingertip over a grey filament. “I’d wager that’s a Concealment charm of some type. Again, common in the adult market, for obvious reasons. Not everyone is open with their partner about their desires.”
Draco groaned. “Don’t remind me, I’m still upset over it. This is not in that league, thankfully. I think I’m just more morose than usual because of this fucking relentless music.” He pointed his wand at a stack of papers near the corner of Potter’s desk, and they shivered briefly before re-arranging themselves in the correct, neat order. He felt slightly better. “Anyway, I’m just running the numbers for the St. Eligius Cup next May. You remember that Abraxans only drink single malt whiskey? Well, I need to have the proposal done in time for the January budget meeting, but there was an explosion last week at the Penderyn distillery, which is the only single malt manufacturer authorised to officially supply winged horse races in Britain, and now the price per barrel of whiskey has gone up by two hundred percent. If we go ahead with the Cup under these conditions, we either won’t be able to afford any meat to feed the Thestral’s, or we’ll have to divert funds from something else and I can honestly see the Summer Swim program getting the cut.”
in our home all these years. Your ex!” Harry had been so jealous of Alan, it had nearly made him sick.
his cock and balls, and pushed them together and forward, not ungently, until he was sporting a fairly impressive bulge at the front.
Some time later, Draco lifted his head with a small groan and stretched his neck and shoulders. Potter was directly opposite, the Ledger in front of him, and the search queries scrawled in a surprisingly neat script on the open page. A stack of parchment was growing beside it as the query results came in, and Potter was currently frowning down at one as he read, chewing on his lower lip and circling the occasional word or sentence.
It had been a month, now. Every morning, Draco woke at seven, and lay in bed, or sometimes sat in the bath, for another hour, thinking. At just on eight, he would hear Potter rising, and at half eight he would venture out of his own room and head to the kitchen. Potter would have a pot of tea ready, and porridge on the stove, and would probably be wearing his scruffy robe with bare feet. Draco always wore his slippers. The floors were cold, and there was something strangely intimate about seeing another persons' naked foot. As a consequence, he found himself looking at Potter's rather too often.
, Harry couldn’t really say what, exactly, but it made him feel slightly giddy. “That’s the strange part, it looks really familiar,” Malfoy murmured, and Harry started to feel hot again. “I’ve definitely seen this before but I can’t quite place it.” Malfoy’s hair was clipped short at the nape of his neck, but was sort of long at the top, and he wore it flicked off to the right in a kind of deliberately tousled sweep. Harry had spent a lot of time staring at Malfoy during school, but rarely this close. His hair was still the silvery blond that Harry remembered, and his eyebrows were very dark, and thick, as were his lashes. It made Harry wonder what the rest of Malfoy’s hair would be like - his eyes dropped to Malfoy’s hands, one of which he’d raised to his lips and now rubbed his fingers absently against. Harry swallowed. Malfoy had the faintest of fine silver hair on the backs of this hands-
When Harry woke promptly at seven on Sunday, it was to a thumping headache and a mouth that tasted like something low-flying and evil had died and fallen into it overnight, but not before taking an enormous shit on his tongue.
“You’re my best friend, too,” Harry said, his voice a little thick. He looked away, down the length of the dark wood of the bartop, sticky rings of wet and puddles of drink glittering in the light, and the knocks and notches of a hundred years of use, or more. “Don’t tell Ron, though, he’s barely accepted Ginny’s position in the hierarchy and it's been ten years.”
Bad choices. He should never have said it aloud. He’d meant staying out too late, having too many drinks, eating something that would seem like a great idea but would fill him with regret tomorrow. Not
"Soft as a half boiled egg…" Dawlish muttered under his breath, his gazel lurching away to glare at someone else, and the mention of eggs just made the missing of Draco
“Do you like them?” Harry asked nervously. Draco’s eyes were wide, just like his various nieces, nephews and godchildren looked at Christmas or birthdays. Overwhelmed.
Weasley didn’t look even slightly guilty. “I knew you’d be asleep and hungover, didn’t want to risk you snoozing right through. That’s why I phoned you. Only you smashed up the mobile.”
“Oh, the vaults are in very good shape, not to worry,” Harry tried not to smirk. “Although, Draco will kill me when he gets home tonight to find I’ve bought him
“Harry,” Weasley said. “He’s been Bound, so he can’t say anything much about what he does to anyone. Physically can’t.”
“That’s expected of me, though. I’m posh.” Draco levitated his cup wandlessly while he fished for his wand in his coat pocket. Givenchy wasn’t really the most appropriate attire for work. The pockets were too fussy, and his thigh holster was much more convenient. “And it’s hardly head to toe. My socks aren’t cashmere. Neither are my shoes, or my coat.”
Hermione'd very nearly marched him to Oxford St by the ear, and Harry'd returned home with more bags than he'd thought humanly possible. Of these, the black jeans were probably his most extravagant purchase, but they'd remained almost unworn. The rapid addition of muscle Harry’d put on from the punishing Auror training (and the resultant prodigious volume of food he’d begun eating) soon found the trousers fitting a little more snugly around the thighs and arse than Harry normally preferred.
Malfoy wasn’t kidding. Harry looked down between them, where his hips were pressed to Malfoys, and his cock was visibly thick and bulging at the front of his trousers. Harry couldn’t remember what he’d even wanted to ask Malfoy.
“I had no idea,” Potter said, crumbs showering down on his front and onto the orange files. Draco took a deep breath, and resisted the urge to spell them away immediately. “No idea what I was in for. Do you seriously have to deal with all this rubbish all the time?” He set down his tea and picked up a file. “Derek Parker has a grievance concerning the location of his desk, and the fact that he has had to move said desk on three occasions in the last four years, which he feels is excessive and discriminatory, as Marjorie Pierce has been with the department the same length of time and has never had to move her desk at all.” Potter picked up another file. “Lawlor missed out on a slice of cake at the last birthday morning tea, and says it’s the second time it’s happened but nobody has done anything about getting a bigger cake for future birthday teas. Speaking of tea, Wedderburn says somebody keeps drinking all the soy milk which was supplied specifically for him, as he’s lactose intolerant, and now he either has to miss out on tea, or bring his own soy milk and keep it in his office, which he says is very inconvenient. He has tried putting a sign up, but somebody defaced it with a rather crude drawing suggesting Wedderburn suck – well, I’ll leave it to your imagination.” Draco supressed a snort, and Potter waved yet another file at him. “Bryce Gardner has lodged a formal complaint against the afternoon receptionist-”
“What would you know about what people in offices do? You’re an Auror.” Draco waited for Potter to move, and when he did not, pushed past the git with an audible huff.
“I’ve missed you,” Potter said against his mouth. “Nobody argues with me in meetings like you do. And they’re all rubbish at sparring.” He pushed his hips down, and pressed his cock against Draco’s, which was hard between them. “My sheets don’t smell like you anymore, and I hate it.”
“To explain to you exactly what you can expect if you do anything to displease Draco between now and the end of your life.”
hot, how have I not noticed this?” Theo shook himself, then pointed an accusing finger at Draco. “And
“It’s your choice,” Hermione said again firmly, and Harry loved her, very much. “Daft, but entirely yours. You tell me if you need anything, if I can do anything.”
tonight. I’m going to see if he’s up for a little horizontal refreshment, later.” She swirled her butterbeer martini twice, and downed the lot. “You know, see if he’s as long in the front as he is in the-”
, and they were reluctant dormmates at the Auror Academy. A long time ago, now. Many glasses of tap water ago.
He lifted Malfoy's palm to his face, his lips almost brushing the skin. Draco's eyes were wide and scared, and…and maybe a little hopeful. Maybe a little longing. Harry whispered the healing spell against his palm, and the splinter was gone, the flesh repaired. They were so close, he could feel every puff of air as Malfoy breathed in and out - they were sharing the same air, again and again.
, and that means you two knobheads.” Draco twisted his mouth, but managed to keep it shut. “Malfoy, Harry is consulting for tracing and hostage retrieval.
“Bottoms up, Potter.” Malfoy raised his glass and Harry did the same, then lifted it to his lips for a slow sip. The scent of honey filled his senses, and the mead burned down his throat in a hot rush. “If things go well tonight, this might not be the only bottom you find is up for you.” And then, Harry was choking, coughing down the thick liquid as the fumes stung his sinuses. Malfoy was laughing. “Good lord, Potter, relax. I’ve really never seen anyone wound quite so tightly as you.”
T/W- Draco does self harming/punishment in this chapter. He also shows signs of anxiety, though he doesn’t acknowledge it yet.
It was easy to forget the past when he simply had no time to remember it. That all seemed to suddenly change though.
“Son, your hands are cold. They are always cold when you’re lonely.” Well how could she possibly know that? Draco looked down at his pale fingers. Traitors. He’d have to put them back in their place later.
His body felt relieved after moving heavy boxes all morning. He closed his eyes and stretched. Maybe he’d turn on the TV for a bit then go make lunch?
He groaned. Why was he so worried about such a trinket anyway? It shouldn’t matter. Still he couldn’t seem to shake the fear of loosing it. With a sigh of defeat he walked out to his living room and pulled out a small sewing kit he’d stashed in one of his drawers. He looked through the yarn carefully. Nothing seemed to fit his needs so he pulled out a needle and began to sew his own small bracelet.
Harry shrugged off his friend's hands before responding, “Was I supposed to just let him sit alone?”
Harry felt worried, although he wasn’t sure if he was worried about himself or for Draco. Surely everyone would hate the boy. It seemed he was right when Draco made his way to the Slytherin table and the students picked up their things and moved. Draco seemed unphased by the action but Harry couldn’t help but feel bad. His family had been disgraced; his life had been shattered.
“So, if it gets cold, I'm still going to make you eat it.” She crossed her arms stubbornly, which earned a chuckle from Ron who sat beside her.
Rain pattered on Draco’s windows. It was soothing, sitting on the floor and getting lost in the noises of the storm outside. It thundered violently, and if he closed his eyes, he’d find every few moments the bright flash of lightning would seep through his eyelids.
Ginny slammed her hand on the table. Draco looked up to make eye contact with the petite girl. Despite her angry gesture she seemed to tremble with fear before him. It almost made him chuckle. Potter’s pathetic girlfriend came to get mad at him? How idiotic.
Harry bit the inside of his lip, shaking his head - his eyes hurting. Flinching once he saw a group of students walking closer from a distance. Draco turned his head - only a bit - to get a glimpse from within the corners of his eyes and slowly stepped back as he touched the bark of the tree he'd been lingering in.
A soft laughter escaped the shadow its throat, and it seemed to slide something off its neck. "I told you I wanted to speak to you privately."
"As if I'd be interested in any of your fruity activities. Shopping for new pyjamas and picture books so your mommy can read you to sleep."
"There must be some way, right?" Harry looked at the both of them in fear. "I mean, you've said it before. With the Voldemort... There must be some-"
'Will I see you later?' she continued eventually - after cleaning her face from her irritated, indignant expression. Harry nodded, smiling generously, and then lifted his hand.
Draco crushed his lips onto his, his fingers digging deep into the fabric covering his shoulders, and no matter how stupid it could've sound, he deeply wished he could've become him at that very moment. His body shivered under his touch. It seemed all so forced yet felt so right. Harry pulled back eventually, placing his head against his before he closed his eyes and clenched his teeth. His face saddened, his voice now small.
"A group of Slytherins. They are outside. They obviously didn't tell me..." He batted his eyes defeated; knowing no one ever would, and thumbed the tip of his tongue along his chapped lips. "Malfoy seems very confident about it. I shouldn't go if I were you."
Harry wished to reply but couldn't. Not at first. He shook his head once more and turned away - freeing himself from his comforting touch.
Harry's teeth clenched together, sweat nearly dripping down his brows as he stared at the badly erased word – still visible. His stomach was twisting, and though a nauseous fulfilled him, the corners of his mouth curled up a little if just for a split seconds. His palms were sweaty, quickly stuffing the envelope deep into his pocket.
'Don't worry,' Harry repeated again as he pulled back his head for a second – wetting his lips to make it more pleasant, and much easier for himself. Within seconds he took his companion's erection in his mouth again – deeper than he had before – and as he finally started to suck, moving his head slowly up and down, Draco just gave in after another loud grown, and threw his head in his neck by delight. His cheeks fluttered bright red, and loud panting got audible. His hands were sweaty now. His fingertips got pinched against the dark wood of the desk, and his back writhed more at the faster Harry moved.
"Shit," Harry hissed – closing his eyes, hooking his thumbs along the edges of Draco's pants. Are we really going to do this?
"Eh, I think you do. A perfect cocktail. You'll become the silly housewife, and she'll have a fine paying job, granting you diamonds and fortune." Ron hit him in the ribs. "Ouch, damnit."
"I'm sorry," Harry muttered throughout Ronald's story, not even listening anymore. "Draco!" He hurried on his feet, bumping against others – ignoring their cursing and calling. "Draco!" His voice was raw, out of control. The blonde locked his eyes, his attitude calm and motionless, until he rose from his seat – turning his back on him as if he wasn't worthy. "Draco wait!"
Draco hopped away in a rush once Snape released him from his deadly hands. His back was covered in cold sweat, and if he could, he would've vanished from school right away. He wanted to leave. Leave Hogwarts, leave his family. For a single second he wished to change his life for another's. A muggleborn even. Rubbing his arms he thought of those who touched him there. Harry, sleeping against him that night in the room of requirements. His hands were sweaty, and yet if he could, he would've done it all over again. He was crying. His hair was a mess, and his shirt stuck to his sweaty back – leaving him uncomfortable, cold and itchy. Running down the stone steps to reach the Slytherin common room, he cursed under his breath – pulling the roots of his hair. No matter, as a prayer being heard, someone stood waiting down the entrance – sad and defeated. Small.
Harry scoffed softly, looking away as if he tried to find the words. "We haven't been talking for almost a month or two."
Draco lowered his wand, letting go of Harry's collar, and straightened his back as he threw another glance to the front door.
After a minute or ten they were easily settled, yet both sitting at a side of their bed – their backs pointing at each other. Harry rubbed his wrists, summing up his actions, making notes of Draco's actions – if they were handy at all.
He didn't need to go far. The entrance to the room of Requirements was located at the left corridor. Walking closer, he did his former ritual, and the door opened in a flash – as if it was open already. Harry could hear a radio play as he got in. Music echoed among the endless piles of stuff. Someone had to be in here, and when Harry thought of the one thing (or more like person) he thought of Draco, and what happened the other day. Harry flinched as a crowd of woodpeckers rushed through the air – almost attacking him on the head – and he grasped for a vase he almost knocked over doing so. This place was a mess full of forgotten and hidden stuff. Filled with treasures. And Harry searched for his own lost treasure. "Malfoy," he called as he wandered through the "halls" of junk – his voice still low, as if he had to stay quiet in case anyone else peeked around. Maybe, if Malfoy was around, he wasn't alone. Who knew about his business here? Though the music appeared to come closer, a genre containing dramatic piano riffs and crying breaths of violin (something not to Harry's taste), he still couldn't find the source. "Malfoy," he hissed through his teeth, almost annoyed now – his head spinning by nervousness and headache caused by the terrible taste of music. "Where the fuck are you, man?"
Harry scratched the back of his head, hissing by the pain pounding up on a specific area – only now realizing he was totally alone. "Y-yeah," he replied as he turned the shower off at last. "I think I dozed off a little."
Hermione took a breath, rolling her eyes as she made a run for her favourite spot – close to the Professor. Ron and Harry, on the other hand, took a spot in the back – nice and hidden to the left corner, away from the light and any business.
"Dunno," Ron replied, shrugging as he stuck his nose closer to the paper. "They suspect Lucius of using the cruciatus curse. I hope they are saving him a room in Azkaban."
"Is what true, Neville?" Harry raised his brows curiously, pretending to search through the pages of the book he pretended to read. Neville seemed to be out of breath, and steadied himself against Harry's desk, shaking his head as he put his "plant-thing" down.
'I said you look shitty,' Harry quickly corrected himself - wriggling himself quickly out of Draco's awkward embrace while closing the buttons of his cotton shirt. There were spots of blood on it, one button had been apparently pulled off, and he wasn't sure how to fix that all quickly. He snorted after thumbing the back of his hand along his lips, and headed away then, though not leaving the classroom just yet. It appeared that Harry really didn't feel secure about this - though this brief, random, uncommon making-out scene with his enemy hadn't feel bad at all. In fact, it had feel great even.
"Let's deal with this," Harry breathed as he allowed his wand to slide down his sleeve into his hand. He quickly pointed at him, biting his tongue to keep himself from exploding. "Get up," he demanded. "Get up and grab your wand."
Draco shrugged, dropping Harry's hand as he walked away, rubbing his hands together. Harry was right. He would if he knew his son got into trouble, again.
Harry exhaled deeply and wiggled his fingers as he stretched his arms down his sides. "Would Draco Malfoy be able to get into Hogwarts if he wanted to?"
Draco turned his head, Harry getting his fullest attention. A chemistry swung around like radiowaves, ready to be picked up, and their lips burned by their former make out. Draco pushed himself up – his tie hanging back over his shoulder, his hair ruffled and his blouse tugged. He looked sloppy – for the very first time. Harry looked at him, shameless, as if his confession wasn't strange by a bit.
Harry scoffed, leaning back into the seat while watching the movements of his hands. "Snape doesn't feed. Not with food or drinks. But with the eternal suffering of his students."
"Fuck you," Goyle spit as he tried his best to get up on his feet again. "One day I'll dance on your grave."
"Draco?" Harry gulped as his eyes began to burn. The boy behind the mask didn't reply. His hand remained lifted, waiting for the acceptance. "You know I cannot take that," Harry muttered as he stepped back. Peculiar, how everyone danced but no one seemed to notice. "Where were you?"
"Surely," Snape replied, his pointy nose creating more darkness than any of the window blinds. "You should be punished for your lack of self-defence. Look at yourself. Pathetic you are."
"We've searched everywhere! It was Dumbledore easing our minds. Malfoy has been missing too, his father is going to kill him!"
It's funny. No matter how hard you try you never seem to see everything that's going on. Harry would spend hours at night, speculating whether he and Draco would ever end up together, being the couple he wanted to be. Wouldn't it be great if they simply came out together, and made an end to all of this? Harry's thoughts were no longer his own. No longer did he wish to become the greatest wizard so in the end he could kill those that tried to kill him. He wished to become the greatest man. The man Draco would truly fall in love with - blemishing the fear that leaked from his pores; the twitch in his brow and the crack in his grin whenever he pretended to be more than he was. Draco wasn't the only one that wished to be free. Harry dreamed of such life all the same. No matter the fame, feeding him on sober days; he wished he could pass on his scar all the same for he would be granted a normal life.
Harry couldn't breathe. His cheeks fluttered bright red, and his book became of sudden interest. "Sorry, wh-what? Malfoy?" He scoffed, avoiding any eye contact. "What about him?" He couldn't afford it to speak out the word us.
"No, Ron. I bloody thought you two would tell me, instead of nacking on behind my back. I'm your best friend!"
"You know me," she replied, laughing softly as she sat herself down. "I have everything well planned."
"Harry," Hermione called – ashamed by the way he found out. Ron couldn't look at him. Without looking he buried his face deep beneath Hermione's curls, kissing her shoulder in disguise. Hermione shook her head, but couldn't stop smiling - no matter the shame. Harry made his way, his breathing irregular as he rushed down the stairs – back towards the sixth floor, determined at last. Feeling betrayed and left out by the way they decided to keep their love a secret, he wished to seek redemption. Rushing back towards that famous hall – the location of the room of requirements – he closed his eyes. He set his thoughts to whatever he wished, and walked.
Dinnertime. It took Harry way too long to realize he hadn't seen Malfoy all day, and only as he walked into the great hall – meeting the blond halfway as he tried to escape in a hurry – he came to the realisation of missing him. Harry slowed his pass. He wished to talk to him, if just to nag about his absence, but caught something different – resulting for him to stop and stand still. Draco did the exact same, seeing his enemy ahead of him, but seemed too exhausted to give him his usual nasty look. He simply batted his eyes, his face pale by mental destruction, and turned his back on him – taking a second exit to avoid any contact. Harry dropped his tensed shoulders. Disappointment caused his eyes to drop, and he wondered with all he had dear what on earth happened today. For now he felt lost. Though he was meant to eat, his appetite was gone. He felt sick to his stomach knowing something happened with Malfoy. Never did he lose his condescending attitude, until now. Something was wrong, and Harry had to find out.
