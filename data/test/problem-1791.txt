“Who is it this time?” he asked, as if this was a tiresome but familiar game.  “Not Tilda from Accounts again…  He said that he could taste her lipgloss for days.”
“Not on purpose,” Harry clarifies, his smile dim.  “Ron saved me and then he destroyed the first horcrux.  It was the start to the end of the war.”  Shaking his head, he doesn’t dwell on this point.  “He always comes back, Ron, that’s the thing.  He always comes back.”
“– I keep telling you; he’s me,” Ginny’s saying.  “Convinced that he’s the protagonist.”
As January turned into February, 2006, a nightcap at Draco’s flat became practically the only way that any night out would ever end, along with every other social occasion that he and Harry found themselves at together.  Sometimes an actual nightcap of wine or whiskey was involved; sometimes they fucked themselves sober, readying for sleep.  Sometimes they talked, and sometimes they didn’t.  Sometimes they’d been mixing in each other’s company all evening; sometimes Draco had no idea at all where Harry had been, before he arrived.
“Yes I can,” Draco promises darkly, and at once Harry knows where this is going.
Glancing at Hermione and then back at him, Ron’s ears were turning pink.  “I can’t while you’re watching,” he said, which made Harry laugh, most likely too loudly.
Sirius’s expression is unyielding.  “He would have seen you killed, Harry,” he points out, sounding as though he’s been brooding on this for weeks.  “You don’t get to be killed.”
“Now, now, Harry –”
“I don’t know anyone who’s gay,” Harry tells him, disturbed by himself, and Malfoy looks confused.  Harry agrees.  It’s been odd, realising how he looks at men.  The way he must always have looked at them.  “It’s 2020, right?” he tells Malfoy.  “That’s weird.”
“She hates labels,” Malfoy agrees, expression openly amused.  “She’s old-fashioned that way.  But she’s been married to Anya since 2008.  Since it became legal.”  He switches a finger through the air.  “Before they banned it and allowed it again.”
“– but I don’t see why he gets to rummage around…  He could have had any of the spares.  It’s not his
It’s a regret of hers, Harry knows.  She told him about it, on one of the few occasions that he’s spoken to her about his own.
They drift into the Valentine pink hallway, to the bottom of the stairs.  The purple living room’s become their canoodling place, door shut so that Teddy’s not embarrassed.  It’s Tuesday night so he should be asleep, floors away.
It’s not clear who said it, but someone pointed out that they’d always rated Lupin, thought he was a top bloke, but it would be a bit unlucky, wouldn’t it, to have a werewolf at a wedding?
He wanted to say something, but he wasn’t sure what.  Maybe it was time, he thought, to ask Harry whether he had a plan.  Harry always had a plan, after all, mapped out by the possibilities of where he was and what he was carrying with him, if not a real route through the air.  Draco had known this for as long as he’d known the man himself, but he’d been too afraid to ask.
“Dad, you don’t want to do this,” Harry manages, approaching him, letting go of Draco’s hand, and he feels like an idiot, because this is an idiotic thing to say.  “It doesn’t matter,” he tries again.  Because it doesn’t; he can believe that.
The players are landing now, two Potters and a boy exhilarated while one Remus Lupin looks as though he’s had more than enough.
“You…”  The words pour out of Draco like fire.  “You are the most stupid fucking man that I have ever fucking met.”  His mouth tastes like wine; his eyes burn.  “You were stupid as a child, stupid as a teenager and most of all you are stupid as this slovenly fucking arse standing here in number 12, Grimmauld Place.”  He leans hard on his hands, until it hurts.  “You are an
Just the thought of saying these words makes Harry feel like a shit.  Yet he also knows that they would make Draco laugh.
“You should see what I’ve done to the flat,” Draco tells him abruptly, just as Harry’s thinking that he’ll have to say goodbye.
” his dad reads out next, and Harry can hear his indignation.  “What is this?” he demands.
Solid and commanding, Harry’s dad’s pushes himself into the space between them.  “How dare you talk to my son –”
.  Draco could feel him in the house nonetheless, a presence deep in his solar plexus like ancestral fault, original sin.
Kreacher clicks his fingers and the cobwebs are gone, but it’s the magical effort, the emotional labour…  “There were no spiderwebs Kreacher saw.”
The chat with James Potter is postponed, but Draco can’t avoid the summons to breakfast, the Saturday after Lily Potter returns.  He understands why.  He can’t leave Teddy Lupin to meet his father on his own, even if he’s not sure at all what comfort the boy will derive from a formerly estranged cousin.
“Cheese,” says Hermione emphatically, and she pats him on the knee.
No one recognises Harry with his cap and his Barbour, mask now off his face.  Lee Jordan’s drinking inside, but it ends up being Harry who goes to say hello.  It’s nice, even as they stand far apart.
“I thought you liked it,” says Draco, stilling underneath him, suspicious.  His flush is fading to something other than pink.
It’s hilarious, to have him here in Harry’s Hogwarts bed.  Harry kisses his cheek, sloppy and not without oil, taking hold of his fist.  “It’s very unattractive,” Harry insists, pretending to be Draco with that word,
sleep, so they work it through together in the flat’s kitchen with parchment and ink.  For the trickier bits of arithmancy, Harry takes hold of Draco’s hand, because he finds that it helps him concentrate – and Draco calls him a soppy fucker, but he dozes well enough against their wrists on the table, jerking awake after twenty minutes because he thinks that Harry’s forgotten the directional substrate.
Draco huffs air past his teeth, incredulous.  “I only care about whether you’re attracted to me,” he says bluntly, and Harry hopes that he’s lying, even as he finds his gaze dipping to the cut of his trousers.  Draco’s expression is evil when Harry jumps and looks up.
Moony scoffs, as though reasonable is the last thing that anyone could be.  “And
holiday.
Oh, he was a joke, Draco Malfoy.  A joke because he felt relieved, for Pansy if not for himself, if she was happy, if she really was.  A joke because he felt riven with guilt, for all of it since 1996, when his aunt had killed her cousin and his father had taken her place in Azkaban.  He was a joke, he was gay, it was almost 2008 and he loved Harry Potter, a year and a lifetime not enough to occlude the feeling away.  He loved him, he loved him, he loved him, don’t lie.
“It’s Professor Potter, Alfie,” Pansy corrects from behind him.
“What are you
This earns him a sceptical eyebrow.
Once the train has left, Harry and Ginny leave the platform, and after hugging Ron for a squeeze Ginny apparates home, one last time, to pick up her own trunk and depart.
…” he moves into a rant.
Both of these were foolish questions.  Potter’s public behaviour meant for nothing, just like his behaviour with Draco here and now, with whomever else he had on the go.  This was the underworld, the demi-monde, another kingdom and an unspoken place.  It belonged in with death, and Draco had committed himself to the magic of these places.  He knew that he was supposed to accept them.
Aghast, Harry thinks, Moony looks at him.
“The memorial I heard about from Story Greengrass?” Pansy suggests, scoffing as she slops some milk into her tea and stirs.  “To which I would have been invited as
Sara Chaudhury was sitting on the edge of a raised flowerbed, which made up one point of the traffic island.  She was staring into space, spectral white and absently rocking a similarly translucent pushchair, which the muggles clearly couldn’t see, just as they couldn’t see her.  She’d died in her late twenties, early thirties, perhaps, and she wasn’t dressed for the weather, instead for something more like late autumn.
Breathing firmly, Harry ignores the predator prowling with an eye to the door, sitting down at his desk and pulling his speech towards him, forcing himself to untie the ribbon.  He concentrates on the fibres of the parchment, the shade of the ink and the shape of the letters, ignoring the wolf until it goes away.
here!" Potter shouts back.
“That’s what Hermione says, you know, ” Harry muttered hoarsely, wrapped around him like a snake warmed by the sun.  “About how I feel sometimes.”  It was an aside at a moment of pause; he kissed Draco’s neck, stroked his arm and thrust his hips.
There’s a lot of this rubbish.  It goes on until Draco’s rolling his shoulders with the man, and he remembers that he hasn’t had a Defence against the Dark Arts lesson in a very long time, unless one counts the witless ramblings of an off-duty Professor Potter, which Draco does not.  Remus Lupin, Teddy’s father, he died in the Battle of Hogwarts, only he also did not, because he’s currently alive, pending certainty, which no one sensible would ever hold their breath for.
Two roads into town is the skate park.  There are clouds rolling in, looking like rain, and Harry sees how this makes Teddy and his mates reluctant to stay out much longer.  They’re holding a conference, when he passes them by.
James looks up towards the sky.  “Padfoot, how many times have you done the same thing?” he suggests, oddly calm in Sirius’s presence, and Harry doesn’t know him.  “It’s a test,” he states gently, categorically.  “He’s pushing you to see if you’ll leave him.”
Moony looks at him, his amber eyes insolent and the smirk on his face as dark as the sky.  “I owe it all to the Potions Master,” he says, and Harry’s sure that he’s lying.  He’s going to feel badly about it in the morning, when he remembers that he’s nice.  “I applied for Care of Magical Creatures.”  He puts this accusation to Dumbledore, and it might well be true.
He’s approaching the bed, Malfoy, his arms full of books, the stream of things bending around him.  Harry watches, wondering if now is the moment to run.
Because – it’s clear that this isn’t Sirius, not really.  This isn’t Sirius at all  (“You let me call you John.”).
“Harry –” comes a rumbling murmur, because Draco was nearly asleep.
“Yeah, we’re going away till next Saturday,” Harry says, nodding, very cool.  “Draco wants to hire a car, drive around a bit, buy some wine.”
Harry’s never wanted another wand, and his wand’s never wanted another wizard – but he can’t imagine Luna with anything else now than his holly wand’s cherry twin, and she’s only had that for four years.
But there’s also the harbinger of these things, something stilted and ridiculous (“You must be…  You must be
Lupin, after all, quite clearly understands.  He wrinkles his nose, smoke swirling gently from his nostrils.  Black follows it with an absent sort of fascination.
he insists, looking awfully, awfully attractive.
And wasn’t that a fun afternoon?
“Good,” Draco replies shortly, pressing his skull into his hands, fingers over his eyes to block out the light.  “I can’t stand the lot of them.  Bunch of queers.”
That was always the plan and Harry’s sure that it will be fine.  “Yeah,” he says.  “Yeah,” he repeats.
Gradually, Harry’s cuckoo-clock little brain comes to acknowledge that Draco is sitting in a visitor’s chair, not the bed, and in the bed is a man who should by rights be deader than dead.
He hadn’t seen Harry Potter since the turn of August when it came to late November, 2004.  Then, one evening, he was bullied out of Mysteries and into a countryside pub by Granger, because she had just received the offer of a book contract – of course she had – and it was her birthday, or near enough – she’d been busy.  There wouldn’t be a fuss, Granger insisted, but she was going to the pub with her boyfriend and Potter and a few of her other merry Gryffindors, and there was no excuse for him not to come.
“Dad agrees with him,” George finally relents, and that’s always the end of it.  “He reckons that Harry should tell Mum himself,” he adds seriously, making Harry’s stomach invert.
you –?”
And it’s domestic.  But when Harry goes to bed, he goes over things, embraced by the warm yellow walls, the soft cream sheets.  He’s exhausted and stressed and being domestic is stressful because he’s making this up; he’s never had a home like this.  The burn on his arm itches like hell and he wants to sleep – he wants to walk through a door and away.
Meeting his oil-slick eyes, Harry feels struck by intuition.  Because – Kreacher must be the product of his influences, but that isn’t all he is.  “He’s not going to replace you,” Harry tells Kreacher, meaning Moony, his chest bright and his fingers tingling, broom in his hand.
His expression was distraught as he ran out of words – hopefully, Draco hoped, because he could perceive some of Draco’s
“I know,” Lupin says, wiping his eyes, and that seems to be enough.
“You think you’re rather clever, don’t you?” Potter says. He’s poking through the things on the table, lifting the lid on the teapot and then tapping it with his wand so that steam comes out of the spout.  “But I’ve figured you out.  You’re trying to save my mate Padfoot.”  He says it shrewdly, and it’s a surprise.  “Yes?” he demands.  “Why is it a secret?”
“Which isn’t where we should be,” Luna points out, giving it him in the neck.
The money will have come from vaults in his name, because these four are his dependants, foundlings from the snow.  But that doesn’t matter.  Harry didn’t choose to buy this – that’s the point.  He didn’t choose it, but it’s here for him anyway.  It’s his, it belongs to him, or something like that.  He can feel the disappointment of receiving a coat hanger and an angular fifty-pence piece.  He can feel the dashed hope of opening the Firebolt on Christmas morning and being dobbed in by Hermione to McGonagall.
“Ah,” his dad agrees, more shortly.
“Mm.”  Lupin nods, as though this makes sense.  “Most acts of rebellion are.”
Fuck it, Draco thinks, full of some emotion that he knows he shouldn’t feel.  Fuck it all, Harry; don’t you see?  What’s so special about this one rule, when magic ignores so many others?
For a moment, no one says anything, and Harry thinks that he’s made his point, nodding and picking up his wine for a swallow.  There’s the sound of the dishwasher, which is supposedly more water-efficient than spelling the crockery to scrub.  The TV’s quiet, away in the other room.
sometimes.”
There's something on Lupin’s face, as if this is all a complete reversal of the way that things are supposed to be.
Again?”
Draco didn’t reply, uncertain how he felt.  The reading of Mrs Chaudhury’s passage was caught in his hawthorn wand, and he would need to return to his office in order to spin it out and conduct the analysis.
“It’s…  Well, I’ve called it
Because –
He didn’t include Luna, because
He’s wearing proper trousers, like an old man, but that’s what he is now, Harry decides.  He’s forty years old and divorcing.  His body’s a wreck, but his trousers fit, so.  He’s a hipster, ten years too late.
“Meanwhile, going through the shit with me, shoulder to shoulder, putting up tents and doing raids on Gringotts, muddling through this impossible –
Harry smiled at him, a little sad even as he rolled his hips down, making the breath puff out of Draco’s throat.  “But then,” he said, while Draco brought hands up to his shoulders, into thick, dark hair like an animal’s, “I think I’d do whatever it takes to put this look on your face.”
“I can’t fix you being a cliché,” Harry tells him obtusely, smiling at the end of this line.  He drops but also doesn’t drop his eyes.
“I know what an espresso is,” Harry pointed out.  “I don’t like the taste of coffee.”
“And since when are you
He had a point.
“At least until now,” Harry corrects, his own grin edging into his voice.  Sirius Black, his parents and Lupin: Harry Potter in love sounds like some sort of Heldentenor Egyptian sphinx.
Harry’s mum keeps sending him letters.  That Friday night, after a whiskey, he opens one, dreading its questions after his well-being, the pressure of its insistence that everyone’s worried.  The confirmation that his dad’s told her everything, and she thinks –
“Ugh, Dad; just tell me you’re going out,” is Teddy’s response now he’s seen them snogging, and he seems to be coping all right.  He’s texting on his phone.
“Some of it was Frank’s lot,” Lily concedes, sitting up straighter in her chair as the door opens to the conservatory.  “The Order, I mean.  But James was good mates with Alice and Frank as well – weren’t you, James?” she calls over.
“No it isn’t,” Moony agrees, as though he’s not sure what to say.
It’s gratifying, how startled Lupin looks.  He reacts with little more than stillness, but he’s clearly wary, disapproving, even disgusted.
Sirius is cringing, all of him hunched as though he has finally realised that, once upon a time, he was a cock.  He’s pulled his knee to his chest again.  He takes up the joke anyway, plainly lying.  “The fact is that I don’t feel anything,” he says.
With a strange, guarded shrug, Malfoy avoids the question.
It’s never felt like coming home, leaving Ron and Hermione’s for number 12.  Even after they stopped apparating between each other’s houses, Ron and Hermione’s home has always been an extension of Harry’s.  Tonight the air changes, and if he’s not coming home with Draco to arrive in the burnt orange living room then he is definitely getting into bed.  Even as they climb the stairs, the walls pink, Draco’s needling Harry with questions about what would have happened if instead of saying thanks for having them, Harry had kissed his best friends and touched them softly, and Harry doesn’t know where he is.  He’s such a perv, he thinks to himself as he kisses Draco hard and they tumble into mattress and pillows and covers.

“Yeah,” Dean replied, before looking round the group.  “It was about the same time that Sea was getting his first snog off a certain Miss Parkinson…”
, at least, for breaking Harry’s godfather’s heart, for leaving his son –

“I know that the rooms are set up as a flat,” Harry rambled on as they emerged, suburban to the last though he’d said that he had no intention of asking for rent.  Kreacher would be managing expenses, talking to the elves who were looking after the Malfoy estate.  “But we could get our bloke back in.  I don’t know who we were planning on…  It was all Percy – you know Percy.”  Harry continued in an affected voice that Draco knew was supposed to remind him of a Head Boy from many years ago.  Draco had no recollection of what Percy Weasley looked like, but he assumed that the man was ginger.  “
“Oh, stop it!” Hermione spits at him, distracted, her tone laced with guilt.  “You’re always so dismissive of my bisexuality.”  Her tone is also camp and arch, because she doesn’t actually feel resentment over this.
McGonagall is saying, making it difficult for Harry to forget himself.

disappointed.  You were at school together; she started the year before you left on your quest.”
Harry couldn’t sleep, the night before the memorial.
Despite himself, Harry snorts.  “It’s supposed to be the good one,” he explains about the cloak.  “The first brother wants to wield Death’s power, so he gets the wand; the second wants to make Death powerless, so he gets the stone.  The third only wants to put him off for a bit, and that’s why he gets the cloak.  He lives a long life, and when it’s done he greets Death like an old friend.”
Harry’s mother is laughing again.  “Completely up himself,” she suggests, but it isn’t actually an insult.
It makes Harry blink and most of him twitch.
Risking a glance at her face, Harry’s surprised to see that she’s frowning.
“Draco, the drawing room,” Harry commands from the midst of the shouting, dwelling on his own determination.  He has no idea where Draco is.
“Doesn’t he live in your house?” Neville asks now, confused, in an accent which Harry never hears otherwise.
“Anyway,” Harry carries on, as if his spectacular lack of awareness is neither here nor there.  “I keep thinking about what I said, or what I must’ve said, because I was quite drunk and can’t really remember, and I’ve been wanting to say that I was wrong.”
“He’ll be back later,” Ron says, and it takes Harry a moment to realise that he’s talking about Malfoy.  “Always comes back, doesn’t he?  Can’t get rid of him.  I think he fancies you,” Ron pushes, his expression mock-bemused.
The sand dashes into the lines of the map – the lines dash towards it – and there’s an explosion, loud in the night.
,” Hermione concluded anyway.  “You should feel comfortable experiencing sexual attraction in our vicinity.”
Agreeing with every word Ginny said, Harry found himself regretting telling her anything.
, who takes us on a muggle mystery tour of suburbia, all in time for your wand to spontaneously combust – so, what, it can be born again? – and now you give me
“I want what we all want, HP,” Draco says as though he’s confused, frowning, eyes sharp, stepping in close and taking Harry’s jaw and kissing him, even as breath rushes quickly up Harry’s nose.  “Targets rather than conditions and for my investments to net a return.”
“Oh, don’t…”  Harry doesn’t want to think about it.  He knows that he should.
Really, Harry tries not to notice.  “It’s nice when you do it,” he lied at the wedding, drinking a glug of water, which
The view from the mountains is breathtaking, really.  The sky is bright blue and the sea is even bluer.  The bushy flora around them gleams a waxy green and the sandy, rocky path is golden yellow.  Trees jut out from the crags at odd angles, the trunks and branches spiking like lightning bolts.
“No.  This is your fault,” Draco snaps before he can stop himself, realising that it must be true.  Only one of them has come close to bearing the title
When Harry woke up, Draco kept his eyes closed and his muscles limp, and that was easy because he was exhausted.
The faces of this family and its forebears don’t seem strange, as Harry looks between them.  What’s strange is the boy stood in front of them.
of me.”
It’s impossible.  It makes Harry blink.  It renders a particularly stressful time in his life obsolete as a lesson in magic.
It feels important for Harry to give Molly and Arthur their invitation personally, at the Burrow.  He explains before he hands the card over, looking down at
“Kreacher,” Lupin replies awkwardly.
“What are we going to do?” Draco finally manages to ask, looking away.
McGonagall tells Dumbledore more carefully, clacking the sherbet lemon against her teeth.  The portraits are too quiet, Harry thinks, though that may be because Phineas Nigellus isn’t in his frame.
that’ll help; you need to retake your NEWT, little Harry.”
“You thought that everything he played was the most unholy racket.”  Pushing, Sirius’s expression glints with wickedness and he locates this joke’s punchline.  “Completely fucking square,” he accuses.
“Harry, you can’t…”
don’t understand,” Draco tells them, because he sees no other way out.  “New Year’s Eve 2006 is the night that we broke up.”
It’s Draco who snorts, very darkly.
Watching him. Mrs Figg bites her lip as though she doesn’t know whether or not to make a fuss.  She’s been told to keep constant vigilance, Harry imagines, but it’s been several years now, it must have been, since anything’s happened.
“It’s exam term,” Harry jokes, his arm a dead weight and his hand lolling into Draco’s heartbeat, “or I’d lend you Puff to keep you happy.”
He made the mistake of glancing up, and it was all so clearly a lie.  Maybe Granger’s attractive friends were exactly the sort of people whom Potter was supposed to be running after in pub forecourts, but that wasn’t who Draco was, and Potter knew it.
Moony scoffs, glancing at Sirius, and he’s thinking about the time when Snape tried to see him kissed by dementors, Harry’s certain.  Harry tends to think about the time with Hermione and her teeth.
Teddy groans dramatically, tossing his head and rolling his eyes laboriously as he flounces back to the sofa.  “You’re just jealous, Cousin Draco.  I shan’t let you have a go if you’re not more polite.  Grandma says that we’re not to let you pretend.”
“He protected you for being your mother’s son,” Draco argues, his expression unreadable.
The magic wears itself out in an instant, diffusing, but the man remains.  Still in motion, he turns on a heel and hurls a voiceless, much ill-advised
“I need to shrink the veil back down,” he says to no-one, to himself.
Shaking off Lupin’s presence to his right, his mum who’s reaching for him and saying a pet version of his name, Harry stands up.  His fingers feel cold to leave the rosewood broom behind.  “Thank you,” he tells Sirius, as calmly as he’s able to.  “Thanks, Dad,” he adds, looking James in the eye even as the words taste sour on his tongue.
Draco laughs, but it comes out as a cough.  Ugh.  He holds a sleeve in front of his face until he’s recovered.  “Most people let go of these things,” he points out, cheerfully having a go on his cigarette again.  It’s always fun to be right.  “Do you really think that Goyle’s crying himself to sleep at night over what I did to him ten years ago?”  This makes sense too, when he says it.  “He’ll be out of Azkaban by now and well shot of me.  Pansy too, I’m certain, is perfectly all right.”
” Harry said, making Lupin blink.  He opened the book to the correct page and showed him.  “That’s Ron’s wand.  Cricket-bat willow.”  It was upright, tall and wavy – a bit like Ron, really.  There was a sketch.  “Dad’s wand’s mahogany.  They’re sympathetic.  You make stuff out of them.”
, a foot in front of where Draco’s trying to keep tall on his feet, Ron on his right and Hermione on his left.
Scooping up their glasses, a few of the others, Harry heads up the garden to buy them two more pints.  Rosmerta, at least, isn’t making her customers use an app.  The wizarding world has a cure, thanks to Neville and Thompson and the Mungo’s team, and Rosmerta’s happy with orders taken at a window, though she no longer fronts the bar herself.
Ron is immediately chastened, picking up his pint and messing up his swallow.
patronum, you stupid
It sounds utterly self-defeating, Draco thinks, for possibly the first time in his life.  “I imagine that death would be everything of an anti-climax after that.”
“You said that you were proud of me,” Harry tells his dad, to banish him.  “You and Mum, and again at the end, with those two mates of yours.  But you weren’t, were you?” Harry insists, even as hazel eyes stare at him.  This feels right.  “You weren’t even there.  You were nothing but a voice in my head, a face in the glass, a name that everyone said to me.”  Raw arrogance made into an image.  “You don’t know what happened.  And you don’t know anything now.”
“It’s a mess,” Harry tells him, rolling over so that he can take off his own t-shirt and grab his wand to clean them up.  His breath is heavy and his ear feels weird, the spit drying.  He likes it.
James is doing an impression with this word, his tone turning arch and effete, his head lolling with a sigh – but then he cringes as though he regrets bringing up Regulus, and Harry decides not to dwell on it.
The air settles, vivid with tension.  They’re both looking out into the cemetery.  Harry looks at them, and for once outside his dreams he sees cousins, two brothers not of blood.  He doesn’t know who he is, standing in these woods, watching one protect the other by not telling him the truth.  He doesn’t know what he’s looking for, only that he can’t look away.
he offers, dry.
“What conversation?” Harry asks, not sure what’s going on.
Harry flinches, looking away.
“So fuck off, will you?”  He goes on the attack instead, and he hates himself for swearing.
Granger looked at him sharply, as though she was trying to decide something.  “I suppose I’ve never asked you, have I?” she said, and it seemed to be to herself.  “It’s not really any of my business – but you and Harry, Draco,” she began.  “You’re not…”
Beyond that, things get tricky.  The village is near Fort William, maybe.  Lochaber.  Perhaps Inverness, though that would likely take longer from London by train.
He feels like he could go to sleep where he’s standing.
, which made things feel better.
Now seems to be the moment when Lupin’s had enough.  “And some of us are born to be Sirius Black,” he says.  His tone is idle and dangerous, to Harry’s ears.  It’s like a command to stop flirting, but that isn’t quite right.
“Well, it’s not like he’s snogged me,” Harry rebukes her, taking a sip.  “It’s Malfoy,” he tries to protest.
“Why must you be so bull-headed?” Lupin demands.  “What are you afraid of, Prongs?”
she says into the receiver, a little faintly.
“We’ve had this conversation before,” Vespers says, with no allowance for their location, nor for their audience.  “Full agency over the self is an incredibly unfashionable idea.”
“We don’t need to talk about this,” Harry tells Draco, when Draco looks up.  He shouldn’t be putting himself in this danger; they’ll adapt.  “Scorpius can always stay here instead of with your parents –”
“It was the day of your parents’ funeral, when you didn’t go,” Luna reminded him, birdsong all around them.  “We went to the Manor orchard and you led us to the ripest fruit.  I took the branch and Hermione took the tree.  You spat two stones into the earth and we buried them, and then you led us back to the stile.”
“I’ll need to fetch a few supplies from my office,” Draco told her.  Amy was starting to wake up now, fussing, so he got out of the way and stood with one shoe hitched to the flowerbed.  “We can come back after lunch and get you both moved on.”
Harry shook his head.  “That would’ve been the same.”
to do with that,” Harry shouts without meaning to, taking a step forward and raising a fist to his mouth, breathing in.  “Why d’you think –”
Draco couldn’t imagine that this was true, but he didn’t question it.  He was about to ask what the man wanted, but then he spoke up again.
James Potter looks back, singularly unimpressed.  “And I know how his curses feel, when he and his disgusting friends are trying to kill me and the people I care about.”
“You like the idea, then?” Harry asks now, his own voice gone low and rough as he walks Draco back to his bed.  It’s difficult to walk; more like tripping.  “You want me here, saying goodnight?”
“Don’t call James
“There has never been a swimming pool –” says Draco, not getting the hint before Harry kisses him again, elbow round his neck, because it’s been several days.
“No one
James Potter is pouring everyone more tea, concentrating on the task.  He’s not including Draco, because Draco’s not sat down.  “No, I don’t think so,” Potter says easily, then frowns.  “No, hold on, Alice did tell me.  Their first year, first flight sesh.”  He nods, remembering, laughing at himself.  “Skids fluffed the landing and nosedived into half a bath of mud, came off head over heels and yet somehow managed to end up on his feet, the jammy tosser.  He went by Skidsy till Christmas, but Gidsy wouldn’t stick.”
At the age of twenty-five, Harry would not have been proud that Draco Malfoy found him sexually attractive.  At the age of twenty-five, random witches were sending Harry their knickers through the post, which made Hermione despair.  They went straight in the wash, and then Ginny used to wear them, if they fit, insisting that lacy knickers were expensive.
and he wanted to see him
“Who doesn’t play for the league?” Ron agrees, which gets them started on transfers.
“What?” Malfoy demands after Harry’s been thinking for a while, his eyes dry, his colouring bone.
“Looks fairly routine,” he reassures Granger, reading the note that’s flown spontaneously from his pocket in the form of an origami crane.  They’re flash bastards, the aurors, sometimes, for no reason.  “Should be back after lunch; might be later.”  With a reflexive peck on her lips he takes out his wand, transfigures his robes to uniform and disapparates.
“I know, babe,” Sirius interrupts, saying it
He lies there dazed for a second, all over himself, hearing flames.
He was a funny man, Draco’s tutor.  Up from France, and so deep into his books that he apparently hadn’t noticed when the entirety of wizarding Britain had descended into murderous chaos.  Every day he would ask Draco when his parents were going to finish clearing out the dark magic from the Manor, as though they’d simply set off a box of cursed heirlooms in the attic.
“I built a greenhouse,” Harry insists, clawing his perfect muscled legs.  His hands are hot; his balls are hotter; he tastes sweat on his lip with his tongue and Draco’s hand is burning hot.
“What?” Harry asks him, confused, stress lines where he’s squinting, because it’s 2008, and he is almost thirty years old, Harrypopmopheadsausageharryharryharryowl.
“It’s always nice to see you happy, Harry,” Hermione goes further, just being his friend, her eyes a glimpse wet.
“Let’s change the subject,” Andromeda suggests today, putting down her tea, and Harry wonders if he can get away with eating a biscuit.  “I’m thinking of taking Teddy to Ollivander’s,” she tells him forthrightly, her expression clear and her cardigan just like one of Molly Weasley’s, even if it’ll be made out of something lighter than wool for the summer, and her jewellery’s much more glittery.  “It would have been something to consider at Christmas, in any case, but he’s grown up a great deal in the past few months, and it would be good for him to go to Hogwarts with some basics.”
“Come off it, Prongs,” Black scoffs.  “The nights that we weren’t living in sin we might as well have been dead.”
you, Dockers.  Bloody hell,” he says, getting up and making Gary pull away from the fridge, slapping him on the shoulder and seizing his elbow, a greeting which Harry’s come to understand means that they weren’t terribly close, but they knew each other well, and Harry’s dad is fond of him, most certainly.  “This is amazing,” he continues in an unusually sober tone, maybe because he’s still waking up.  “Now I know how people felt when
“Other people are inordinately boring, and
Harry’s never been able to imagine the ritual for making the Marauder’s Map.  Not every step.  Performing it on this beach, he’s certain that he couldn’t replicate it on his own.  Here will be easier, he’s been told, because Ibiza is perfectly plottable, though there are a couple of variables which mean they’ll have to improvise (“Your dad enjoys worrying through details,” explained Sirius, not worried, long-suffering.  “At the end of the day, all cast magic is an art.  It’s a feeling.  We’ll be fine.”).
at the ceiling and lies on his side under the duvet, focused on their gleam in the dark, scattered and flaring.
“Frankly,” says Sirius, as though he’s bored.  He’s crossing his arms.  “I would be disappointed if you didn’t take after all four of us.”  He’s looking at the other two on the bench, and then at Harry, as though he’s being entirely reasonable.  “The last thing that anyone needs is the unadulterated speccy inheritance of James Fleamont Potter.”
“Oh, the tin of beans is a classic,” Lily tells him, a bright grin on her face.  “Everyone has to get a prize,” she explains.  “It’s just that some of them are better than others.”
,” she seems dismayed to have to point out, “that this is
The tone is uncanny, but what is there to say?  “He’s usually worse.”
…  They aren’t a choice, but a clear category difference between those who live in this house and the rest.  Draco doesn’t live here; he lodges.  He lodges where he should never.  “For Granger’s ring.  I shall have to withdraw.  I apologise, but I’m simply too busy with work.  Now, if you’ll excuse me…”
the place that he’d been renting, to a couple of muggles no less, and they’d wanted to live in it themselves.  He’d been given eight weeks to find somewhere else, eight weeks ago, and the easiest alternative had been a fifteenth-century Wiltshire manor house which made him remember wishing that he was dead.
There’s a pause, but somehow, then, with this, Harry’s lost an argument.  “In that case,” Lupin suggests lightly, his tone ever so sly, “one imagines that you might be able to afford a few hundred quid on a painting.”
“He does that,” comes the easy observation.  Then she’s frowning at Draco again.  “Malfoy,” she repeats, and he hopes that she isn’t going to hex him.  “All right.  Whatever happened to Lucius?”
Lupin breathes, wiping his mouth in anticipation of evil.  “I think he died the night that James was killed.”  He says it bluntly, mocking himself.  “And there’s nothing that can fix that.”
Here in Ibiza, the spell seems to work.  Ink crawls into lines, finer and finer, until winking lights begin to glow from the map like stars, dotted in fragmented constellations.  There aren’t too many, because magic can’t map muggles – but this is an island of thousands, and there are at least fifty witches and wizards or so.  Harry’s attention is drawn to three of the lights in particular, grouped together on a northern beach.  He reads the names sketching in underneath them, and his stomach turns over, to see those six words grouped together.
, is it?”
And there, sprawled on the ground underneath the veil’s old wedding arch, visible in the moment that Draco takes a step, is their perfectly preserved specimen, new life.  It’s the stunned form of one Sirius Black.
.  But there’s something else in what she’s saying, Harry’s sure of it.  Nerves kick in.
It never feels like Draco’s stealing Harry's wand, when he takes it.  He stretches to drop it with a clatter on the bedside table, and by the time that Harry’s out of his shorts, he’s found his own hawthorn wand and zapped at their clothes on the carpet.
“Did I tell you?” he breathed through grunts, tightening his grip on Draco’s thighs as he withdrew a little further and pushed back in.  “I snogged her.”
Harry glares at him, clenching his jaw.  “I could so easily hate you,” he says darkly.
Somehow, Luna persuades Harry to spend the night in her spare room, instead of going back to Hogwarts.  He eats a light evening meal with her and Liz, forgetting to take off his sunglasses until he goes to bed, when he sets them on the bedside table.  He casts
He shakes his head, turning away to look at the trees.  Draco kisses him again, quickly, taking the side of his face in his hand so that he turns back, his elbow now gripped by Harry’s grasping hand.  Another kiss, because that is necessary, and Harry’s breathing him in, face flushed, smelling of salt, but Draco doesn’t – he doesn’t…
“Don’t now, now me –”
“But there
Eventually the stag turns to take a different direction, but it’s about to head towards the acromantulae, so Harry has to sprint and shout, “No, not that way!”  It’s instinct; he can’t bear the thought –
Harry feels angry with him in a rush of hot rage.
“I’m coming with you to Puddifoot’s,” Draco insists, twitching as though he’s unsure of his welcome, even now.
,” he added, “I don’t know what…  Or if…”
It seems like a risk, to Draco’s mind, to buy the ring and enchant it all without seeing the thing on Granger’s finger.  It must
Dismissively, George waves a hand.  “Oh, Gin’s fine; she doesn’t care.  Worried that the thing was going to be
“Honoured,” Sirius is insisting, his eyes bright and his mouth twitching because he clearly wants to laugh.  “Excited.
There aren’t many people out.  The country is still under the tier system; Harry and Malfoy might technically be flouting the rules, gadding everywhere together, but they’re a metre apart, most of the time.  It’s not raining at the moment, but the puddles are deep at the side of the road, filling potholes between the tarmac and the hedges.
Harry pressed Draco’s nose again, with more fingers.  His wrist was taken from him forcefully, held to the mattress, and it felt very nice.
” he asks instead.
Draco wonders if he should feel miffed, not to have received such a reaction himself.  Here he is, still clutching a very handsome Honeydukes egg to his chest, wrapped in gold foil and tied up with a green velvet ribbon.  There are some of the shop’s signature honey truffles inside it, for spring.
Harry covers his ears for the end of this.
” he says, and Harry can’t remember what year this was in.
– but already there are other things emerging from the bag, too many things, and they look like books, on first glance, but they aren’t.  The charm is speeding up.
There was, moreover, an issue of use-by dates.  In a clear testament to his upbringing, it seemed that Harry Potter always kept bottles of the Polyjuice Potion in the kitchen of number 12, Grimmauld Place.  It was Granger who brewed the potion, however, and Granger with her boyfriend remained out of the country.  The batch in stock was on the turn by the time that things had been figured out, and nothing had been brewed for July.  Potter had never gained his NEWT in Potions, after everything, a fact that it stunned Draco to learn at the time.
“Let me take care of you.”
Harry loves when he knows exactly what to say.  “It already has?” he spells out.
As for Harry, he swallows, imagining it, still panicking.  He needs to escape, he knows, from all of his thoughts.  “I’m think so,” he says, and he commits himself to walking through a door.
Ginny laughs, and it’s like the sun bursts from clouds across her face.
Part of Harry doesn’t understand.  It’s Sunday; it’s Valentine’s Day.  It’s 2021.  The walls around them are Valentine pink.
Harry has the urge to snap.  He doesn’t know what he’s more annoyed about: the way that Ginny’s talking about Malfoy or the daft way that she’s narrating their conversation for her fiancé, who’s surely capable of picking up these things on his own.  That stupid bloody song that won’t die.
Longbottom stands there on the decking, pouring himself a tall glass of what Granger calls Wizard Pimm's, smelling faintly of HP sauce.  “I’m joking, Malfoy,” he says, his Os long and oop noorth.  “But you can’t hide it from me.  I teach teenagers.  There’s oonly soo many tricks in the book.”
The man jumps up to a slouch over his feet, scrambling on the platform to face Draco in surprise.  He’s a bird in a cage, Draco thinks, floundering and flustered, tousled hair, and Draco thinks that he loves him.
Justin’s undergraduate dissertation, as Harry’s been told, was on nineteenth-century trade law and about as dry as floo powder.  His day-to-day work has something to do with putting things on ships, which Harry doesn’t understand.  He’s not Harry’s type, let’s say.  If it can be said that he has one.
– and digging his elbow straight into Harry, who wasn’t supposed to be there.
All of Harry’s plans for getting over himself and generally acting like a lothario sink away into this moment of weakness and whatever it is, middle-aged metabolism, because he feels the terror of the moment when Draco stops loving him, the moment when he persuades himself of it, and it might only be ten years away.  And then he’s falling asleep.
Neither the insult nor the throw has much heft and the hat spins to the chequerboard floor at Draco’s feet.  With his wand, Draco spells it to a built-in cupboard, full height and not under the stairs.  The door receives it with a satisfied
“OK,” Harry tells him in a panic.
Fuck, Draco thinks, staring at the man.  What the fuck is happening?
he writes.
“Rav?” Sara asked, less amused but clearly not agitated by the thought.  “No – I mean, it’s been
Draco snorts, and he sounds very fond, holding Harry close in the end.  Harry shuts his eyes.  “As our head of house used to say,” Draco tells him, digging fingers into his hair, “she has a lot of good ideas.”  The end of this sentence hangs damningly.
Harry’s not sure how to say that he’s been wanting to
Hermione's certain that she’s the reason why her parents have never come back to Britain, not even to visit.  She made the charm repelling them too strong, she says.  She was trying to protect them.  She was young.
“We’re not dating,” Harry scoffs, putting on his Barbour and hat.  Malfoy’s said that he should be embarrassed to dress this way until he’s walked at least fifty miles of the countryside.  They’ve been exploring Wiltshire; no one’s counting where they’re up to.  “What’s dating?”
“You can stay in our house,” suggests Harry before he can stop himself, making Tone titter brightly.
Bill was on Harry and his dad’s side, at least, as the argument started, because Lupin had been at Bill’s wedding to Fleur.  The Weasleys were on their side in any case, because Bill likes his steaks more blue than pink, as Fleur puts it.  And there’s the principle.
There’ll be a wolf running under the light of this, somewhere, if it hasn’t been locked in a cage.  Maybe that’s the reason why.  “It’s not my problem that you can’t sleep for worrying about –”
“Right,” Potter replies, in a posture of ease at the other end of Draco’s sofa.
James laughs as Sirius sits down, and Harry feels another stab of something sad.  “Changed your mind, then?” he asks lightly.
There in the bed, Malfoy’s sitting up over his knees, under the duvet.  His posture reminds Harry of Sirius, but he’s not laughing or sneering, just staring.  He’s wearing a rumpled black t-shirt, like Sirius, but clothes aren’t clothes when Malfoy wears them, because Harry only sees what’s underneath.
that,” he insists, his mouth still a little full.
Unfortunately, before they can get much further into this conversation – much further into this date, Harry thinks, because they were on a date this morning, maybe – Draco’s phone pings, and when he pulls it free from his pocket, the pocket on his arse, which Harry is watching, he says, “Ah.”
Then he realises abruptly that he hasn’t said
“It’s something that Lily and I are looking into,” James finishes, closing down the conversation.  He doesn’t seem proud; he seems tired.  “Hermione’s chased it all up –”
He finds his toes curling inside his wellington boots, he turns Draco Malfoy so pink.
Annoyed by the ugly, outmoded tent interior, Draco couldn’t comprehend why Harry Potter was there, holding Draco’s arm.  It was inevitable, he supposed, because Potter was always there at times like this, but it shouldn’t – it shouldn’t have been allowed.  He shouldn’t have smelled of sun and the sea, sharp stones.  He shouldn’t have appeared in the closing moments of the war, nor now, not freed the family prisoners nor stolen Draco’s wand, not saved Draco from fire, not now dragged Draco out of the house where his parents
It was a gesture of hope over experience, Draco rather thought, for him, but he was never averse to Harry’s attempts.  “Mm,” he offered in approval, putting his mouth to better use than reminiscences.
It wasn’t late, not yet even midnight, but he was somewhere else, somewhere meditative.  He hadn’t slept in a long time, so this felt more natural.  He could imagine the party that was happening, because he’d received an invitation weeks ago through the owlery at work and he could feel it, how no one was home.  He could imagine Granger and her boyfriend keeping him entertained, while Luna played tricks with his drinks and tried to make him human, or kill him.  He could imagine Harry dancing, on his way to getting lost in a corner with one Ginny Weasley, though he hadn’t seen them together since March and he didn’t want to now, not anymore, though he knew that it was all inevitable.
If it were the afternoon, Moony would be sitting in the shade of an ancient gnarled evergreen olive tree, the trunk huge and twisting, the foliage a heavy crown.  From the glimmer of flame, Harry can see that it’s currently burdened with green fruit.
The look Draco returns suggests that he won’t be happy until Harry carries him home in a sedan.  He hates wearing a mask on the train.  It’s very different from being with Ginny.
“Fuck this Gryffindor shit,” Albus sneers eventually as though life is unfair, looking at Harry, picking up his bag to storm his way out of Minerva’s office.
“And I know that at the end of the day, it’s all a big party,” says Granger’s boyfriend, the romantic, apparently.  “But it’s also important.  Like dying, or being born.”
“I’ll leave him with you,” said Matías, shaking his head, and that was Harry off the Christmas card list, he imagined.  With a slap to Harry’s back, Matías left them to cheers and shouts from a group not far away.
James Potter still doesn’t know, Draco thinks, not for certain.
“Hello Vernon,” says Harry’s dad, crossing the threshold.  He puts his wand away.  “Remember me?  It’s James Potter.”
he hears.
There’s a rush in Harry’s stomach at this, because he thought that the results looked OK, but he wasn’t sure –
“The crunchy-faced bornabee has eyes on the back of its head, did you know?”
“What’re you going to tell your dates?” Teddy demands, wrinkling his nose at Harry’s bacon.  Harry’s rather glad that the house smells like frying pan.  It’s the smell of Teddy’s roots, frying bacon, and he shouldn’t forget it.  “
“You’ve done so much for him,” Granger continues to prod.  “I know that you say you didn’t intend to, but no one else could have given him his parents.  And Remus!  Remus knew Sirius best of anyone, and sometimes I think…  Well, it gives Harry someone to talk to about those years they had.”
“Let me read it, James, and I’ll tell you,” said Harry’s mum, a warning in her tone as she sat up straight, brushed off his arm and held the paper directly in front of her.
Dan used to take his glasses away if they’d been out for a while, telling Harry that it would get him more looks, especially if they went somewhere muggle.  He’d put them in Harry’s pocket and charm them to stick until the end of the night.  Harry used to drink through the headaches, which seems foolish, looking back, but Hermione was never there to point that out to him.  Regulus’s room echoed without any of his stuff in it, so Harry liked to be out; it used to make them all laugh when Harry tripped over things.
A bright gulp of laughter, like a dog.
Draco hadn’t realised that there was a list in his head, but he felt himself cross off
Draco’s tempted to disapparate right there, from inside the boundary, but there are appearances to maintain.  He settles for shoving the table away from him and picking up the chair in his path with all the excess magic in his fingers, all that hawthorn smell of decay, red gleaming gold in the sun as he hurls the chair with deafening prejudice over the railing and into the dining room windows, where it clatters down into the space below by the kitchen with the noise of broken glass.  He stalks through the French doors to the conservatory, their handle too weak underneath his hand.
“He’s fifteen; we’ll forgive him,” James dismisses with a roll of his eyes.  “The facts are these,” he moves on.  “Even if I wouldn’t have castrated you with a big sharp knife from there beyond the veil, the pair of you are too similar and your eyes are turned in other ways.  I don’t know where you go,” he carries on without a breath, “when Moony’s crying
They don’t talk about it.  No one talks about the little adventure they went on, four years ago, which saw Draco’s parents both fall down dead.  Granger and her boyfriend were out of the country, and it was Ministry business, but it isn’t safe – it will never be safe to talk about the stone.
“How are we going to find him in Ibiza?” Harry asks, thinking about Ron and his bank statements.  Not about the drag act, though he supposes that it could be fun to see.
Pansy von Herrschenberg sighs.  “Do you know your boyfriend at
“When I said whatever I said,” Harry goes on with a gesture, “implying like an idiot, I think, that all I’ve ever wanted from you is idle chitchat, forgetting all the times that we would, er, you know…”  He gestures, glasses in hand.
Distracted, finishing his cocktail, Harry tells him bluntly, “Anyone who fucks with my team’ll find themselves in a disciplinary.  I don’t care who they are; I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again.”  There’s a reason why Alleridge is Head Auror.  There’s a reason why Harry and Percy are good friends, besides the kids: Harry had no idea what to do, and Percy set his promotion back by what’s been five years in order to help him.
There’s a note that arrives on his desk, sent through from the owlery.  It’s one sentence long, and he reads it one more time than it deserves, before setting it aside and working on his calculations for the day.
.  Or I mean, um…”
Mildred meows.
Hermione’s still compulsively explaining, tearful.
– but before Ron can speak, Hermione lets out a snort and she’s forcing her mouth closed against titters, her eyes closed and her face increasingly pink as though she can’t get enough air.  “Oh,” she sucks in breath, one hand in a fist, water in her eyes.  “Oh Harry, please,
the mirror agrees.
“Oh, what’s happened this time?” Granger asked, pulling away to sit on the arm of one of the chairs and cross her arms under her chest.  She rolled her eyes at Draco as though her boyfriend had just done something obviously irritating.  “I thought that you were playing giant Jenga with Dean.”
Her relationship with Prince Momtin fell apart.  The common version of the myth says that Momtin went on to marry Veyra’s sister, who was not a knight at all but an octopusherd.  As for Veyra, one day, on a swift current, she left the blue seas with the sunset and was never seen again.  To this day it is said that she tests the dead at Tanemoha’s side, down in the deepest black ocean.
They could do with building a waist-high barrier, he thinks, or something else that leaves the veil open for observation yet offers a modicum of protection against its vertigo.  They could add some blinky lights.
She glances up again, frowning for an instant at the figure now looking at books before hiding her grin in her work.
Accurate or not, he’s hard from the remembered, imagined sensation of Draco lying on top of him and something nebulous happening with anatomy – and Draco’s clambering over him, swearing, “Fuck,” in the pitch dark night.
Lupin is staring, transfixed, as though he wants to throw up.
“No,” Draco bites out, even as he leads the man though to the kitchen.  “You can watch me in the shower and wank.”  He doesn’t care to imagine what Granger’s boyfriend is thinking right now.  He doesn’t care to imagine anything at all.  “They’re under there,” he concedes, waving a hand at the sofa.  “And there’s coffee made.”
Moony is wearing a pair of black trousers and a short-sleeved shirt open at the collar, also black.  He’s wearing sunglasses, no matter that there’s at least an hour until dawn.  His hair looks golden in the firelight, and his face is freckly, more youthful than Harry’s been able to remember.  The set of his jaw is poised and sharp.
“I dunno,” this bruised man said, looking up to the light.  “I mean, I never fancied you in school – or at least I don’t think I did.”
Harry shakes his head, concentrating through the lingering pain.  For a second he was sure that this was both his eyes gone, but the shapes of the room are coming back to him around the bright light.  A breath comes in as a sniff.
The room was a soft and sleepy grey around them, the light outside almost entirely cut by the curtains.  Harry had no idea what time it was, but snapping plainly settled Draco into his skin, which made it the morning.  He revealed himself to be nothing but exhausted and grumpy, out of focus in his rumpled black t-shirt and his fluffy, streaky hair, his skin clean and pale with sleep.  To Harry, he looked like nothing but pure chaos.  Feeling.  Energy, instinct, light.  Fear and the night made him hide it all away; it made him freeze; it made him say horrible things.  It was nice, this fearless version of him.
It’s feeble even when Harry tries it.  He can’t bear to say that he was there as Harry Potter.  “I teach Defence against the Dark Arts…”
Playing his part, Ron shakes his head in mock-exasperation.  “We’re not going to get there until the options are rationalised,” he points out, and Harry nods to agree.  “Besides,” Ron allows.  “Classic wedding sounds a lot like Gin’s.”
“At the start of the year,” he tried again.  “You snuck into my compartment when I was trying to keep Pansy and the rest of them entertained.”
His eyes catch on a blur: bright hair, bright skin and bright eyes, startled and frozen.
He’ll be back soon, Harry tells himself.  He always comes back.
Because it’s funny.  Ginny’s frustrated because James is like her: competitive.  His test marks from first to fourth were all As and Es, because there was no immediate reward.  For OWLs he was aiming for Os, and he and Ginny were playing a game they wanted to win.  The Ministry had promised replacement exams.
“The rest’s up at Hogwarts,” he told Draco over his shoulder.  Another wardrobe of robes and his books, anyway. “My toothbrush and stuff’s in the bathroom downstairs.”  He shut the wardrobe door.  “I’ll get it later.”
Hermione told him all this, he remembers, on the day that he told her that he couldn’t go to his parents’ funeral, that he wouldn’t.  He broke apart in her office, clutching at her desk, and she knew better than to touch him.  Fresh from Cairns she made him tea instead and told him that he would regret it, sending his parents away without a single thing to remember them by.  She said that she would keep it for him if he liked, whatever it was, until the day that he was ready to come back for it, but she wouldn’t let him make the mistake that she nearly did.
” George concludes, nose in the air.  It brings Harry back to things, because it makes him think of Ron and Hermione’s wedding.  “Our Screaming Streamers have won an award.”
,” says Hermione, leaning over the table and gossiping the way she must do with the Gryffindor mums.  Her expression is wicked, glancing at Ron, though her eyes are still a little sad.  “What an adventure.  Are you excited?”  She seems to think that there’s no threat to Ron from Harry at all.
, including himself,” he scoffed dryly, rolling his eyes.  “And Moony was away.  The only thing I heard against him came from He Who Must Not Be Named, and maybe I lost my life – my family’s life – to nothing more than a double bluff.  Reverse psychology.  But I don’t think that he’d turned by that point,” insisted Harry’s dad.
“You should talk to Draco,” Harry points out, and the stag looks up again.  “He used to do this all the time.  He’d turn up in places –”
,” Andromeda scoffs, and she blames them, Harry remembers, for her husband and daughter’s deaths.
Harry can hear it in his head, and it almost makes him laugh.  He’s always liked Bill.
And there’s so much, Harry thinks, that he never caught on about.
” she suggests, looking at Harry wickedly over her teacup.  “It’s the only thing more interesting than your political divisions.”
“I’d rot them to the core,” Draco’s saying, and Harry can’t remember who or what he’s talking about; he’s conjured lube by squeezing his hand to a fist.  “All that flesh and these hard bones.  And
“Sid Vicious threw up in my squat,” insists Gary, still looking like a warm-hearted pirate.  “It was five years before I was there, but he ruined the carpet.”
Lily only sighs passingly, cutting him down, and she’s apparently already back to her writing.  “James, you’re not attractive,” she says, presumably lying.  “You’re speccy.  Your shoulders are narrow.”
“Look,” Potter says, his jaw tight, his dark hair wild as always, and it’s better.  It’s worse.  Twigs crickle-crackle under his feet as he turns and stops in the path.  “I couldn’t be an auror without passing Potions NEWT, all right?  And I couldn’t pass Potions NEWT without going back to Hogwarts.”  He wipes his forehead, again, looking at the ground, rubbing his eyebrow.  “I didn’t
The outburst is unfair, Draco knows.  If anyone understands him out of this lot, then it’s surely Black, who seems to be setting himself up as some sort of bastard uncle that Draco never knew he had.  His face is full of surprise, grey eyes stormy with understanding and deep, clear guilt, of the kind that Draco feels so deeply.
“You and Padfoot,” said his dad, holding his head and vigorously rubbing his back.  “The pair of you – peas in a puffapod.”
Among others, this memorial brings Professor Harry Potter to the village of Hogsmeade – to play the hero, just as he’s played since first stepping foot here.  He’s not usually to be seen in Hogsmeade at the weekend, but he’s a familiar sight as he lives and teaches at the school during the week.
“No, we’ve apparated into your fucking wankbank.”
, he mouths, trying not to roll his eyes because it wouldn’t be appropriate.
“Fine,” he said, moved in, not sure what to do now.  The keying ritual had been for midday with its bright noon-sun energy, surely belonging to Granger’s boyfriend.  Draco thought that he might as well head into the Department, but there was always another option.  “Well, Potter,” he started again, picking up the man’s attention.  “Welcome to my new flat.”
,” he snaps, opening his eyes, feeling angry, the way he always did when he was young.
“What’s that?” Mrs Wood is asking.
Lupin doesn’t raise his voice, but the words are clear.  “I don’t need fucking grounds to fucking tell you to fuck off –”
Harry swallows.
“Get out of my house!” Uncle Vernon instructs in the tone that he gets.
And, oh, look, now Draco’s offending them.  What a surprise.  “You have a streak of inverted snobbery a mile wide,” he says, rummaging through cupboards.  “Just look at the Weasleys.  It was cute when you lived in Slough or wherever it was –”
“What?” demands Harry shortly, conscious of his short greying hair and his robes.
For the final chase they make a good show for all of the crowd, swooping low and whirling round the pitch neck-and-neck, neither succeeding in blocking the other, the sight reminding Harry of the years when it was the pair of them at home, when he would take them out.  The crowd are excited – they stand up when Harry does – and everyone cheers for Albus when he’s victorious.
She’s peeking between her fingers, and Harry feels the urge to hide the whole room in a vortex.  The bed hasn’t been used in a week – it’s perfectly made with fresh linen – and yet Harry’s sure it looks obscene.  It’s the size of it.  All the pillows.  Kreacher’s the only one who’s ever seen it besides Harry and Draco, and Kreacher’s good at keeping secrets.
“Have I heard this story?” Draco asks, looking at him.  Because no one’s ever told him the significance of this place, before it became a retreat from difficult family gatherings.
“It’s only nice according to heteronormative society, Harry!” Hermione declared in their corner of the ball room, her eyes blazing.  “A system in which we all lose!  That’s not nice, is it?  This
“Sirius is here?” Gary asks, turning back to Harry’s dad.  It’s not clear he’s been told that Sirius has come back to life.  Or even that he was dead.  “Your best mate Sirius?  Sirius Black?”
The night when Harry sets his father on fire, Harry thinks about Wormtail, and he wonders if this is how Wormtail felt.  He wonders what the man must have done to begin with – or had done to him – to set him on the path to betraying James Potter.  He wonders if, just like Wormtail, it wouldn’t be better if someone struck down Harry now, just in case.  A plucky child, thirteen years old.
“So, go on, then,” prompts Harry’s dad, attempting to save face.  “How have you been?”
“I don’t see how slapping up a few deeply vapid cuts of meat…” Malfoy complains, picking up his burger and taking a bite.  Adultery only counts when it’s the opposite sex, Harry’s been told.  And there has to be sex.  It’s funny, divorce law.  Malfoy’s munching.  “The need to tolerate their company outside the crucial moment was punishment enough, I assure you.”
In the end there he was, ragged and gone missing, Harry Potter coughing softly as he climbed back up to his feet and pressed fingers to Draco’s face which smelled like late mornings.
It makes Harry laugh, which is entirely inappropriate.  Armed with
with their deaths,” Draco tells Harry Potter, crossing his legs, appealing.  “Cursed by wizards.  Shot with green light that tore them asunder and left them to accept death as the way of things.  The resurrection stone, I am certain, cannot make a person
“You won’t get there,” Draco snaps.  “You’ll be dead.”
This is scratched through as well.
“Yeah, and now I’m a pro.”
They must have fallen asleep, here in late 2006.  If it had happened before, the both of them together, then Draco didn’t know about it.  Maybe that was suprising.  Less surprising was that it had happened now, here in Draco’s flat, where he could feel the prickles somewhere underneath his ribs which told him that Harry was home, just like Granger’s curling vines behind his ears and the sunlit, sounding strength of her boyfriend in his shoulders.  When pushed, Harry said that Draco felt like bitter honey on his tongue, here at home, whatever that meant.  He couldn’t taste it himself.
“Start at the beginning,” he suggests in the end, nodding at the parchment on the table.  If nothing else, they can treat this as an academic exercise.  “Define your scope.”
He narrows his eyes at Harry, who gives him an innocent look.
The thought amuses him, sometimes, if only to imagine whether Harry or Granger would run screaming first.  For some reason, Granger’s boyfriend seems the most likely to go through with acting out.  He’s pragmatic, Draco supposes.  Less concerned with the principles of the thing.  He could shut his eyes, if pushed, lie back to think of England and let come what may.
He should have seen it coming.  It was a joke, the idea that Pansy would have waited on a match that had always been less than perfect.  Draco was nothing in society these days – he had nothing on the go and no means to pursue a worthwhile engagement, nothing that could shake him out of his turpor when it came to the Manor, which had been left under the elves for too many years now.
There are words on the tip of Harry’s tongue to sneer at this, the Potter name.  He doesn’t know where they’ve come from.  He feels hot and embarrassed.
He looks down as the phone pings again.
“Mm,” complains Harry, feeling half-drunk.  He thinks he’s heard a ping, some sort of sting in his ear.
“No,” Harry agrees, loudly.  “This isn’t about any of you.  I’ve had enough of you lot making fun –”
Though it’s nice, Harry tells himself.  It’s nice that they have each other.
Harry and Ginny have made a pact that they won’t let what happened at Christmas happen again.
“What’s the difference?”
He’s paused on the edge of the rug, his eyes cutting and sharp.  This is the truthful inside of him, and Harry stands stock-still to see it.
Long-suffering, Malfoy sighs.  He offers an explanation as though it’s beneath him.  “I looked into your father’s infiltration of my flat.  There is a consistent flaw in your warding technique.”
“She looks beautiful, doesn’t she?” said Harry.
“Solve what?” Harry asks him again, because he hasn’t solved anything.
The house feels different without him.  Emptier.  Wrong.  He and Malfoy should’nt’ve…  Why did he –
.  And when they look at Ginny – when they look at the world.  Because Harry’s not sure that Ginny was ever fine.  It was brutal, what the industry and media did to her, for daring to have a baby at the age of not-quite twenty-three.  At Teddy’s age now.  For doing it again at twenty-five; she never played again.  She earns good money from coaching, but never what she should.
Two days before this, on the second of May, Friday night, exactly ten years on from the war, near drowned by marking, all shoved to the end of the week and to Sunday, it’ll have to be, after the memorial – or Monday morning, next week, some point whenever – Harry leaves Hogwarts for number 12, Grimmauld Place.
from when I was small, like it always was.  I thought that I’d lost it; I didn’t think that I could still…”
“I’m not…”  Something catches, and it starts to feel like panic, but good, and then it feels like something else entirely.
he writes bluntly, passive-aggressively, sitting in the deep teal basement of his house.  There are high windows to the street where the owls fly in.
The muggle coat’s no surprise, also.  Malfoy’s been wearing it for years, though Harry doesn’t know why.
His tone is brutal, hammering out the names of everyone who could have been Harry’s guardian.
.”  His voice pitches, incredulous.  “Three decades, you want gone, and you can’t do it.  You are here
He hadn’t realised that he felt like a butterbeer, he thought, pulling the cork.
The spell’s entirely rubbish, Harry remembers as he watches it in action.  There’s no way that James will keep at the activity for long.  There’s no way that anyone could; it’s frustrating just watching him –
“And it’s not likely Dad can stay.  I know.  If he even…  Merlin,” Harry snaps, sounding entirely like himself for one crystal-clear delayed reaction, while Draco pulls his inner robe over his head.  “Who greets their son with a handshake and an introduction?”
Lupin laughs more loudly this time, and it is not a friendly sound at all.  “Do enlighten me about
Ginny used to enjoy it, Harry remembers.  He’s so sure.  They used to have sex when they came home.  They used to have sex all the time when they were twenty-five.  Maybe they thought that the DMLE do was a good joke.  They used to have a lot of friends in the department, Harry remembers.
that life is the better way.  How can we imagine what it is to feel one’s heart stop, to wake up and be told that one day there’ll be that feeling again?”  He’s running away with himself, but Draco lets the words escape.  He has thought of everything, it feels like sometimes, in the depths of the long, cool night.  “But – can the stone break the Killing Curse?  Pull everything back together and
“And then of course you would follow me and drag me into one of your Harry Potter secret passages that no one else ever knew about and you would snog me silly or what have you.”
,” Black demands with a sneer, always a dog, eyes flat and grey, taller than Harry and burlier.  Draco hears the etymology in his voice,
When Harry thinks of his marriage ending, in the future, he knows that he’ll think of this heat.  He’ll think of the rainstorms which follow.  Violence in America, though that’s always difficult to date.  He’ll think of James Sirius receiving his OWLs, the culmination of his early years at Hogwarts and three months of Ginny teaching him at home in number 12, Grimmauld Place.
“You’d be saying that if things were reversed, eh, Gin?” Ron jokes.  Hermione nudges him in the side, not saying anything.
He’d been on the floor for a while, Draco realised.  He’d been standing against the wall themed on winter, drinking and drinking, and then he’d been throwing up in the toilet, all of him, his head through his throat and his stomach through his ribs, shaking and breaking apart until Luna had found him.  She’d pulled bottles from the cabinet, clattering and banging and trying to make him swallow, but he’d staggered away from her and they’d ended up back in the living room, the seasons of its walls.  Luna had called on the crowned fairy queen and shrieked at her until she’d thrown sparks up his nostrils, which had itched and felt like spring rain.
.  “Half of it’s only because I don’t know where you’ve been.”
And, yes, Harry’s wound up.  “Have you ever gone anywhere and thought, ‘You know, maybe I won’t nick something today?’”  This sounds more than a little hypocritical, to Draco’s ears.  “Like a normal human being?”
“What about Granger and…?”
that this is a shame.
“Oh, for Merlin’s…  We thought that Dumbledore had told you and you didn’t want to talk about it.”
“I told him that the office belonged to Athanasius, and Athanasius needed his space.”  There’s a pause before Sirius clarifies, “Athanasius was my owl.”  He goes on, “And then I told him that I’d get more for renting out his side of the bed – if I wasn’t worried what it would do to my looks, becoming a whore.”
Looking at Harry with too much like something he never felt when they were young, Draco breathes.  “I lied about why I got the phone,” he confesses, and Harry’s certain that it’s enough to get him sacked.  Maybe the thing other than expelled.  The wizarding world tends to extremes.
“I’ve come to take Draco on a walk.”
“Dad,” Teddy’s asking him through the floo one Friday morning, impatient, blue-haired and twenty-two, his eyebrow pierced.  He’s radical, politically, having come out of Hufflepuff – because they’re all radical in Hufflepuff nowadays; who knew?  “Dad, I don’t mean to sound ungrateful…”  His eyes are bright amber and they clash like sunshine with his sky-turquoise hair.  “But are you ever coming home?”
” he addresses them accusingly.
” Harry begs him, pressing forward with every ounce of strength he has left, to escape.
“You can say it,” Harry begs him, looking down at ice-cold eyes.  Promise that you love me, his own voice sounds desperate in his head.  He can never remember how Draco says the words.
This is supposed to be an easy one too, Harry guesses.
Black makes a gesture for him to carry on, and Draco supposes that he wants to know about Harry, just like everybody else.
.  “And he calls him it later too; I saw it.”
this.”
” she shouts, losing control, and it breaks Harry’s heart to see her crying again.
Harry doesn’t know which one of them he ever wanted to be, in his dreams.  He only knows that he doesn’t quite look like any of them.  He knows a boy with dark hair too big for his ears, with eyes wide and curious and startling in colour, almost the age of the boy at the centre of the image.  He would let Harry stand at his shoulder, at least for long enough to take a photograph.  But he would never stand staring for hours, not just to see
“When did that happen?” Teddy’s asking him.  “I mean…”  He blushes, which is always what he does when he fails to sound woke.
“Why have you brought me to the Forest of Dean?” Draco asks, not sure that he wants to know the answer.  He’s supposed to be swearing again –
“Is that…?” he asks, disbelieving.
Ginny is watching, biting her lip.  She’s attracted to Neville acting like a schoolteacher, most likely, nowadays, but she’s not fundamentally changed.  When Neville’s not looking, she leans in towards Harry and Draco and forms a conspiracy, “Did you jinx Oliver?”  Her expression is sharp and alight and amused; Draco seems to be growing in her estimation by the minute.  “That’s hilarious.  He was driving me mental.  Up the wall,” she corrects quickly – and it’s funny, but the kids don’t say it, so.
He doesn’t know where his friends are.  He doesn’t know why they have to be at work, all of them at the Ministry, Ron and Hermione and Draco, abandoning him here with this
Harry looks back at him, wondering if he should have known.  His dad was held captive, like Luna and Ollivander.  Likely tortured.  He doesn’t seem to want to talk about it.
“Hear, hear!” Black barks anyway, his grin like light on his waxen face.  “I like it.  Let the crumpet ones be a
“Ah, yes,” Lupin says, a little surprised, it seems, to find himself holding the still-unpublished book.
Despite himself, Harry laughs.  It’s the scandal in Draco’s voice, which says that part of him loves it.
Harry doesn’t agree in the slightest, and the gesture makes him think of something else.  “He saved you when I –”
pleasant surprise, here in the parlour, and Master Harry’s father, back from the dead – well.  Tonight is surely the night for fillet of beef, and pistachio soufflé.  Kreacher will decant some of the best wine from the cellar.
Oh, Draco’s still thinking.  Because for a moment, just for a moment, his eyes skew when he looks at James Potter, and he doesn’t see what he should be seeing at all.
“Er.”
stopping now.
, Professor Potter,” he says warmly, his eyes dancing.  It makes Harry feel daft.  “Enjoying the summer?”
“I don’t want to do it on my own,” Harry insists, panicking, and Draco pulls tight, “not again, not like that – not with only ghosts to come with me, I can’t…”
“Er,” begins Gary, looking discomforted and wide-eyed.  It’s funny when it’s somebody else.
Harry goes out to the landing, walking himself into yesterday’s jeans.  His dad is clattering down from upstairs.  “You haven’t seen your godfather, have you?” he asks, and he looks almost disturbed.  He doesn’t seem to notice that Harry’s still buttoning.
It’s not quite a dragon that emerges from Draco’s hawthorn wand, but it’s close.  The creature is as large as a Shire horse, with the same power, the same grace.  With two legs and wide, fanned wings, the patronus flies the length of the garden, all sinew and bladed scales like feathers, bright white and shining in the darkness.  Perhaps it’s more translucent than James Potter’s, but the shape is solid enough.  It turns over itself when it reaches the cherry tree, breathing a stream of ice-white fire into the sky from its beaked, serpentine face, casting tree branches in light before it spirals back to meet Draco and Lupin on the decking.
If anyone asked, Harry’s sure he’d say that he wouldn’t want to be involved with someone who’s involved in his work.  Besides the basic ethical problem, his home is a sanctuary, an escape.  There’s no true escape from reality, Harry’s well aware, but he also knows that incompatible ideas can co-exist.
More silence.
But Ginny keeps explaining.  She’s always been more articulate than Harry.
He thinks of his own Gryffindors, reading these essays.  Hermione doesn’t like loose ends and his mum, it turns out, has a slightly twisted sense of humour once you get to know her.  Their plans for Malfoy Manor make a lot of sense.  There’s something that tickles Harry’s mum, Harry’s gathered, reading in-between the lines, about taking Harry’s dad to Voldemort’s bed, and Harry hasn’t asked further about it, because he doesn’t want to know.
With a flick of Draco’s wand and a wrinkle of his nose, the front door’s closed, and Draco’s not snogging him in bushes, he’s kissing him here in the hall, embracing Harry tight as though he thought they’d let each other go.
Facing away from the dancefloor, Granger’s boyfriend swallowed down two cheeks of beer.  “Most of ‘em are in their thirties,” he said, “going on fifty-five.  Us low-rankers get a three-pint limit, because the sobriety potion won’t work on more.”  He shrugged, as though this was an explanation.  “You get used to it.”
“It’s not my fault,” Harry begs him, his muscles quaking.  He knows that he’s lying; he was always a liar.  “I wasn’t made for this – I was only…  I was made for other things.”  For fighting in wars, he wants to say, because it’s true.  His eyes are stinging and he wants to start this dream again.  He wants to react a different way, to be loving and gentle and kind like his mother, when Harry’s not making her shout.
Is that all right?  Harry wonders, because he’s not sure if it’s all right.  He keeps doing it with everyone else and it’s driving him insane.  He’s not even sure what the difference is between Draco his Draco and Malfoy from school.  They’re both as fit as each other, in his head; his memories are all strange and adjusted.  Professor Lupin too, with his butterbeer, the flirt.
“We were
, James, you dingbat –”
Harry shakes his head, not quite ready to speak.
Glancing down to the leather straps and his thumbs, Potter sighs.  “It’s not a…  It’s an Hermione special,” he explains as they continue to walk, his vowels flat and his consonants distant, and it feels as though Draco is being drawn into a confidence.  He loves confidences.  “One handy bag with everything you need to make a hasty escape and otherwise solve a mystery.”  Potter grimaces, mocking himself as he adds, “I’d make them standard issue, for everyone, but no one listens to me, because I –“ And this is the joke, the refrain.  “– I work in Misuse of Muggle Artefacts.”
It’s about then that Draco has an idea for one way to at least take the edge off things.  Andromeda will approve, he thinks.  Maybe there is a reason for him being here after all.
“Ah,” acknowledges Draco, looking to the side.  There’s a reception room there, Harry sees, almost exactly like number 12, Grimmauld Place, though everything in this house is smart.
As a child, Harry is scratching roughly at the crown of his head, and Harry hopes that he doesn’t have lice.
Hidden in the darkness, Harry’s response was prim, even playful.  “I don’t see anyone doing anything,” he rasped.
…  Which seems like an unnecessary set of worries, four years on.  “Dunno,” is what he’s ended up concluding.  “We are where we are,” he points out with a shrug.
Black nudges his head into feathers, and the hippogriff settles back down.
As it is, everywhere seems conspicuously empty.  The house runs quiet with all the sound-proofing, but Harry swings around doorframes quite certain that he cannot be the only one up.  It’s Friday, because of the odd days that term ends, and Ron and Hermione will be going into the Ministry soon, but they’re both still around somewhere for now.
McGonagall is saying.
“How trite,” Draco says, moving to the foot of the bed.  The idea is very funny, for the moment at least.  “Can you see anything?”
“It’ll be me that’s the problem,” his father says ruefully.  “It’ll be just like Dad said – my window will have closed around the age of twenty-three.  These days I’ll be about as virile as a…”  He makes a sound like a splat.
“We offer a very generous returns policy…”
,” Draco goes on, clearly lying.  “But the entire wizarding community…”
“Why didn’t
It strikes Draco, in this moment, that this is why he should be Ron’s best man, and Harry Hermione’s, and that Ron likely knew it all along.  Because he loves Hermione the way that Harry loves Ron.  Her magic is something that he never knew he was missing, and it is precious to him like nothing else.
,” a dream says, there in Draco’s office, too real and too present, warm.  He presses a chaser’s certain hand into Harry’s hair as though his head’s a quaffle, pushing mess away from his forehead, his scar, and it’s too warm, it’s burning, too hot.  “Harry, it was a long time ago; we’re all here.”
“Oh, stop it,” Harry’s mum complains, but she isn’t really complaining.  “I spent ages…”
“I never told anyone, before that wretched boyfriend of yours,” Moony says, in confession, and it leaves Harry surprised, for a moment.  “I wouldn’t have known how to make you the first.  I should have found a way anyway…  Harry, your godfather and I are involved,” he comes out with in one breath.  He says it like bad news.  He breathes as though he wants to be sick.  “We’ve been carrying on for years –”
Harry throws up his hands, and a spark of laughter comes out of him.  “I was thick, OK?” he points out, and it’s funny, really.  “I should’ve guessed about you two…”
Harry swallows the lump in his throat.  Far away he can hear the sound of London’s traffic, picking up with the day.
This bright morning, not quite six, Draco’s lounging next to him with the
“All right,” Harry tells him, and he sees a first year now, more than ever.  A first year in Hufflepuff, trying hard.  “But don’t forget what the man in the shop said.  Take your time learning the easy stuff and it’ll set you up better –”
Ginny shoves him hard.  She talks past him quickly to Draco, het up, defensive, prone to taking things too far, and Harry regrets what he’s said.  “Harry has a weird kink about Ron and Hermione taking him to bed with them,” she tells Draco – and Neville too, who chokes, thank you, Ginny.  “He thinks that they don’t know.”
” Harry casts, disbelieving, his voice cracking as he feels the tears sting his eyes.
Harry’s not sure how to tell him that with the number of times he burned as a child, he’s likely destined for skin problems, no matter what.  He’s a wizard; he’ll get it sorted at St Mungo’s.
It turned out that Liz was joining the WWN as a match commentator.  She could only have been thirty-two, thirty-three by now, so there were still years of quidditch left to play if she wanted them.  But apparently she did not.
” he begs, covering it, desperately trying not to kick his leg, because he doesn’t actually know this at all.
“Getting there isn’t the point.”  Harry’s shielding his eyes, his mouth hard.
It took Draco a long time to come.  That had been true for years now.  It was normal.  It wasn’t why Harry denied himself, the way he did ten times a night.  As far as Draco could tell, it was simply that Harry didn’t like it, the way a soft touch could make him arrive in minutes, seconds flat, and then get him up again barely any time later.
“Well, I’m here to smash the state!” immediately Teddy retorts, affronted, looking between them and blushing again, maybe sussing out why they’re not moving, though Harry hopes not.  His arms tighten across his dressing gown and he’s clutching his phone.  “I was not aware that enfranchisement meant living in some sort of knocking shop!” he finally declares, defaulting to sounding like Andromeda before he sweeps away to dash up the stairs in a clatter.  He sounds quite a lot like Draco’s impression of his mother, just without the voice.
” he mocks them, and he doesn’t care that he sounds deranged.  “I can’t tell if he fancies you –”
Harry’s already written something else, from when he was thinking about it.  Dumbledore and Snape, the reasons for Voldemort’s downfall.  He’s sure that Snape was a hero, though they were never close.  He’s sure that Dumbledore used them both, though it was the only way to win, in the end.  Harry doesn’t like thinking about it; he’s moved on.  It all came to good, so it doesn’t matter, does it?  It makes a good story, the tricks that the three of them played on each other, the strength of Snape’s need for a friend (or whatever), Harry’s need for a grandfather, Dumbledore’s need for redemption.  It’s a story about the power of love, and that’s enough to banish fear and hatred from this world.
He looks at Harry now and he reads something.  “Oh mate,” he says sympathetically, wincing.
“James – James, no, I didn’t mean…”
It didn’t make sense, Harry realised, standing by the table.
And Draco should be leaving, he knows, but his body seems to have excluded itself from his brain’s commands.
It’s Wendy and something, isn’t it?  Wendy and Nathan.  Draco has no idea.  He knows that they’re muggle healers who specialise in teeth.
“What?” Draco asks him, them both tucked up on the comfy playroom sofa, the walls their paint-box lavender hue.  Half-finished beers are in their hands, the empties returned to Harry’s kit in the cellar.  Harry’s sideways: he’s slouched into one of the arms with his feet off the floor, hooked with their socks into Draco’s lap.  The door is ajar to the landing, but Teddy and Kreacher won’t look in.  Teddy’ll just comment.
The next morning, his sons are due in Hogsmeade, where Ginny will be giving them sweets.  Harry tells Ron and Hermione his plans over breakfast, which they acknowledge with little more than a shrug.  He says he can’t promise that he won’t be throwing himself on their mercy by Monday, again, after work, but today he expects Teddy to be out or hungover or busy, whatever; the Ministry wants them to respect the muggle lockdown, so he’s going to spend the weekend in number 12, sort out his and Ginny’s bedroom or decide on another, see if the house needs anything.  He might get called in.
He summoned the duvet to cover them, up to their shoulders.  Harry’s sodden trainers lay left on the floor by the bed.  Draco didn’t sleep, and the first question that rose to the front of his mind was simple.  How many times had Harry’s friends fucking
“You killed my sister!”
Draco’s face is a bright pretty pink when Harry pulls back, his eyes a bright milky blue, his hair as blond as Luna’s.  “You know you’re mine, right?” Harry tells him, feeling up his face, his eyes slipping to his mouth, which is perfect and red.
Summer begins eight weeks later, at the end of June.  The day after returning from Hogwarts, Harry wakes to find Draco lying in the hazy half-light of the morning.  He looks exhausted, like he couldn’t move, but his eyes are open, bleary, tracking Harry’s face and hands.
Draco’s giving him a look, his widow’s peak softened by the cap.  His expression seems certain that there’s a bad smell.
This is something to think about later, Harry decides, though he wonders if his daughter’s eyes might not have opened his own.  Once, James tried to tell his sister that she shouldn’t talk about Luna
Burning, the holly grain is pulling across Harry’s palm, and he cries out, even as he and his dad stumble and slam into the sideboard, rattling the mirrors above it.  The wand pulls free, his leg is burning with pain, and Harry shouts, “
“But then this last year, since we called it quits, it’s been…”  Harry shook his head, waving his hand around in the air, absent circles.  “Just hanging out, or whatever you call it, trading insults.  It’s been fun.”
There was a photo taking up a third of the page, which seemed to delight Harry’s mum.  It had been shot through the coffee-shop window, at the moment when Sirius had reached out to touch Harry’s wrist.  The picture showed Harry’s head flashing up and him blinking, his mouth closed and eyes round in round glasses.  He looked ridiculous; he looked
He didn’t, though.  Instead, Harry settled into a role with which he was comfortable.  “All warding’s the same thing, really,” he explained the overreaching principle, resting his eyes on his drawing, speaking measuredly into cool silence.  “It’s about translating the house into magic, then translating magic into the house.”
It’s all just as he left it.  The outskirts of the room are filled with his conjured explanations, gleaming and rambling in white letters of his handwriting.  His last communications with Black remain there too.
She was around thirty, perhaps, about five years older than they were, and when she looked up Draco was surprised to recognise her as Liz Townsend, star keeper for the Holyhead Harpies, reaching back to the days when he’d kept up with the quidditch leagues.
“I’ve been thinking, since March,” he tells his best friends as he pours, and he doesn’t know what this story is.  “I don’t want to die again without trying the other way.”  He opened a door in his head.  “I’ve never really kissed anyone besides Ginny, you know.  Never gone further.”  He can get in such a panic about it.  It’s like what they say being a teenager’s like.  “The husband of a wife; the dad in a sitcom…  That’s not all I am; I don’t…”
Looking up, Harry finds himself breathing, standing in moonlight, his glasses in his right hand and and his left splayed to express his indignation, his throat moving with no sound as he stares at Sirius in disbelief.
He shrugged into Draco’s hands, and Draco was too far gone to really hear what was being said.  “You’re a fucking cocktease,” was all that came out of him, before the night was on again.
“Yes, but why?”  Draco sees the tears come.  His expression is too sympathetic; it barely suits his face, though he’s frowning.  Harry feels certain that he’ll love him forever, whoever they were in school.
”).  Neville went through the garden and told them what was there (“So you’re saying that
Lupin mutters to himself, exasperated as he directly addresses the cat.
” he quotes the words that Lupin never said.  “
“I’ll get the ones after,” insists Malfoy heroically, committing himself to at least another hour of Harry’s company.  “You always get the bill; I’ll get it tonight; are we going elsewhere?”
“Yes,” agrees Pansy, before looking startled – looking at Luna as though she’s betrayed her.
to your family and your name, and the idea of you
Her fingers were wet, trailing on his face, but she held him on the floor until he fell asleep.  He woke up with her in the spare room, both of them dressed in old training kit for the Holyhead Harpies.
There’s the sound of someone huffing.  “I don’t know where else Padfoot could be.  He’ll be lying in a ditch, sozzled off his face –”
Uncle Moony tells Mrs Figg, forcibly reasonable, rising to his feet.  His eyes are burning.
“Nothing, really,” Harry said, looking at the muffin on the table, reaching to press his fingers to the paper.  Shagging Malfoy was most of the answer, though there’d been a sixteen-month lull on that until yesterday.
to me,” Sirius states categorically, arrogant, as though this is the important point, referring to Moony again.  “He worked himself to the bone to pay halves on our flat when he was there.”  He scoffs, worked up, ranting as though he’s talking to family.  “You know, the first time he went off for Dumbledore, he had the gall to suggest that I could sublet the office.”
“If I can make a suggestion,” Potter says to Draco’s mother, all business, back straight with his thumbs loosely tucked behind the straps of his bag.  “Narcissa,” he adds.  “Might you be willing to break us into your house, so that we can steal whatever it is that they think is a Hallow?”
“What are you scared of me telling him?”
With another loud snort, Hermione’s laughing at him, waving her hands as though she can’t take it.
he was insisting, impatient, absurd.
Well.
.  “And Malfoy doesn’t –”
”).  The replacement is pure white – alabaster – carved so thin that it’s translucent near the rim.  It’s covered in clarifying runes, the memory thin cloud.
This earns him another laugh, deeper in Harry’s throat.  “What is going on with you, Malfoy?” he asks, a peculiar expression on his face.  “What did you two talk about last night?
Boxing Day, 2006, Harry was behaving very oddly.  He appeared in Draco’s bedroom like he was disorientated, and seconds later he was pulling Draco’s book from his hands and snogging him against the headboard.
“Mm,” Harry agreed, and Draco realised that they’d gone off track.
All the same, the fruit punch is light and refreshing, the flavour something of elderflower and spring.  Draco isn’t sure that he’s had it before, and he imagines that Kreacher is spoiling them as a treat for having so many people in the house.
“I wouldn’t phrase it like that,” Hermione suggests, and it’s infuriating, because she knows that Harry won’t say no.  He should have seen this coming; there’s a smile on her face, daring and nerve.  “Ease into it,” she twists the knife.  “Play it by ear.”
Harry wants to tell him.
“Some of us like to know what’s going on, Harry,” she tells him, reproving.
He’s otherwise maps of places that he’ll surely never go, though he’d like to, like Morocco and Mongolia and Mexico, and there are some antiquarian ones, both wizarding and muggle, rolled up in tubes when Harry knows that they should be framed.
And that was why, wasn’t it?  That was why Harry Potter could do what he did, because he knew that he’d be OK.  This mess in an alleyway was a passing cover for the cake and kindness in his soul, just like Granger knew.
Draco wasn’t listening, but there were questions in his head nonetheless.
“What is it, really, that can happen?” Harry asks him, because he doesn’t know the answer.  His fingers are jittering.  He makes fists and wraps his arms around Draco’s back.  “What would staying stop?”
and the earlier sparks.
’s mind has always been filthy, Harry thinks.
Harry steps forward, ready for a fight.
“Don’t call me
“Well, I fancied her at the time,” Harry says, to wind him up, “so that’s how it goes, innit?”
“All day and all night, it seems like,” James replies, leaning into the Leaky’s plum and gold upholstery.  There’s a window behind them, misted up and always smoked glass.  The pub’s quiet; it’s early in the week.  “Him and that Malfoy.  Workaholics, the pair of them.”
know this.  He could have sworn.  It’s been beaten into him by a thousand passing remarks.  It’s just – he never realised…
“Let me try and knock you out,” Harry suggests, abandoning his thoughts to frame Draco’s head with his arm.  He rolls over him as gently as possible, worried about breaking his bones.
There’s light coming in through Harry’s curtains, three sets across grand, tall windows.  It’s chilly outside and threatening a storm; the temperature on Monday's muggle bank holiday will be historically significant.  Nevertheless, Harry finds the bottoms he’s wearing annoying and hot, and with Draco pressed up against him, smiling into kisses, it’s easy to shuffle them off and to take the shirt off too.
Shutting his eyes for a moment, Harry can only think of a time in his life when he accepted that snogging Ginny would be the sum of his whole life’s experience.  “Please,” he admits, and it feels dirty to say it.
Flinching, it’s the tone that makes Harry recoil, as though this is true, must be true, and there’s nothing to be thought about it but
Draco can’t help his blink.
He feels like a perv in the morning.  He just really loves his friends.  The war made him weirdly possessive.
This is how he’ll remember this summer, Harry thinks, shivering to feel the chill of autumn.  More than the heat, he’ll remember the first time he was allowed to visit his Ron and Hermione and sit within the boundary of their house.  How much it felt like breathing, to be near them again and not with his wife.  How much it felt like coming home from work.
There’s something to admire in that, Harry’s sure of it.  The strength of his loyalty, if nothing else.
Harry loves their little gestures; the way that they talk to each other –
they land in the quiet midnight of Little Whinging’s Privet Drive, directly on the pavement in front of number 4.  The air of the first of September is cool, the sky still very dark.  A security light comes on, flaring at them, bold.
Draco doesn’t even know.  From what Draco’s heard, James Potter has been more than matey enough, but maybe that’s the problem.  Fuck, he thinks, watching James Potter’s expression become guarded again, still violent, still full of grief, but unfriendly with it now.  This is a mess.
“He doesn’t deserve you lot having a go at him,” Harry says, swiping his hand under the lenses of his glasses and directing his words to James Potter.  “And you…”  His jaw ticks.  “You couldn’t let him have his flat, could you?” he says, snapping at his father for want of anyone else.  “How hard would it have been for you to just –?”
Harry leaves before he can shout at her.  He’s being punished, he thinks, for all the times when he said the same thing.
Harry Potter was gathering him close into the crook of his neck, an awkward mess of arms and cologne and sweat and sex, Draco’s damp saltwater tears.  He was too many of Draco’s desires, and every one of them felt like shame.  “I want children,” he found himself saying in the Darkness, and he didn’t know why.  His eyes were screwed closed and wet, his breath hitching.  “I do.  I want all of it.  I want a home where we host a hundred on Halloween.  I don’t want – not
Silent for a moment, Draco breathes out, turns his head and opens his eyes one at a time, bleary and careful. “You’re worried about them,” he says in the end, surrounded by pillows.
James Potter finds him a while later, when Harry’s showing off his friends to his mother.
Jittering, Harry tries to get a grip on his dad’s shoulder again.  “I’ll explain things to Dudley,” he says quickly, forgetting that he should keep his mouth shut.  He doesn’t even plan on explaining to Dudley.  He might mention it to Luna.
Harry doesn’t get anything like as much post as his mum.  It’s because he only writes back to people he knows.
“Had to do something while I wasn’t getting Potions NEWT,” Harry told him, climbing up into the main kitchen.  “Runes was something new.”  He shrugged.  “You feel like white flowers and hedgerows,” he continued as an aside, his tone suburban and flat.  “I could go back in time and laugh myself stupid.  Do you really intend to act as a lodger?”
” Harry explains, and it comes out with something like a laugh.  “
Coming back to himself, to the breakfast room, Harry looks at the newspaper, sucking up beans.  None of it matters, in the end.  It doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.  But the line of it has been threatening everyone close to Harry for years.  She’s been playing the long game, Rita Skeeter, Harry thinks sometimes.  She saw her opportunity for two decades of lucrative stories the moment that Harry looked up at her, confused, in the cupboard.
“He’s Skids,” Lily insists, confused, looking up from her list.
my son.”
them, he
Harry feels like liquid in these moments, like he’s trying to put out fires and close wounds.  Heavy, liquid, slow.  He doesn’t feel like himself, and certainly not the way he always felt when people used to corner him, make him talk and dance and laugh even when nothing was funny.  He feels like he knows what he’s doing.
The tent was full of
use a broom; he just doesn’t…”
Watching them fly, Harry’s nerves rush and he swallows – and there are heavier things coming free of the backpack.  Because he’s bought prints and posters at exhibitions before, when he’s been weak.  He’s bought books on photography and Fauvism, a movement he likes.  He’s kept at least twenty of Teddy’s old drawings from school.  They’re forming piles on the floor.
“You don’t need to make excuses.”  For a little while, Draco just kisses him where they’re standing up downstairs.  Harry holds him close, and all he wants is for him to love him forever, the way that he’ll love him.
“That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Harry dismissed.  “The point is to make a show, so that everyone knows where you stand.  It’s about changing the way that other people see you, not the way that you see yourself.”
Friday is Hermione’s birthday, and Harry doesn’t mean to avoid it, but he does.  It’s the first time since they were eleven, he thinks, that he hasn’t seen her for it, and this gives him an inkling that there might be something wrong with him.  In 1998 he forgot the day and he forgot to buy her a present, but she and Ron snuck out to Hogsmeade and apparated in pops to Grimmo for the evening.
Black replies with a scathing wrinkle of his eyebrows and a short shake of his head.
Swallowing his nerves, Harry moves to distraction.  “Why’d you put that one there?” he allows himself to ask.
Shrinking to the shadows, Harry doesn’t know how to leave.
” Draco bellows, half to himself.
It’s enough to make Draco very nervous indeed.  The feeling that he’s being watched is intense, almost overwhelming.  “Mother, what’s going on?”
“Oh, just like that,” Teddy’s dad mocked him, as though they were sharing a joke.  Harry could still feel himself being thrown backwards, the one time when they’d spoken to each other as equals.
Green eyes blink.
Sirius forces hair out of his face, fighting against the wind and still pacing.  “Sirius Black and Remus Lupin,” he declares in a haughty tone of voice, and this seems to be an easy one.
“I’m sorry,” Harry promises, unable to see anything.
Draco nods, content.
Together, the swarm of cats moves into formation, Snowy yawning out some sort of command.  They’re joined by a calico, menacing.
he demands instead.
Malfoy’s pale eyes meet his.  “Potions,” he says with a smirk, and it’s clear that he means nothing legitimate.  “I dosed myself on the Amortentia, and in exchange Astoria took the Polyjuice.  We made a dirty weekend of it.  The idea was to include the exchange in our sex life more generally…”
sure that I want him over someone who’d be cheaper?”
,” the boyfriend insists.  “And with Dominic and Ange down under, there’s only Harry left for the run-up.  Because he might as well be her brother,” he says expansively, to Draco’s surprise, “and I don’t need another one.”
Lupin laughs.
There’s a note in Harry’s voice as if he wants to make the swim.  Even though his security under the lake still rests on nothing more than gillyweed, just as it has for the past three years.  “You realise that they’re concerned about you,” Draco observes in passing, because that also seems very clear.
And Harry worried about this at the time, once he’d come to terms with the fact that he’d had
” he accuses, eyes shut and pressing into Harry’s nose.  He inhales and breathes out cool breath all over Harry’s cheek, making him shiver.  He’s complaining, mostly.
, how dare you
It’s true that Harry likes the chaos of the exhibition, every year.  He likes the different rooms, all painted bright colours and filled to the brim with colourful things to look at, floor to ceiling.  He likes that it’s full of people, and that while a good number of the pictures are large and imposing, a greater number are small and approachable, depicting things that he can recognise or words that he can read, or shapes.  Shapes and colours.
On the same wall, nearer to Humphrey the bear, there’s one of Harry’s charmed mirrors, reflecting for now.  It’s the gilt one, instead of the ash, all pinecones and needles in its filigree.
Granger sighs, eyes on the doorway.  She’s serious now, and she throws Draco an irritated glare.  “Oh, we’ll go after him,” she announces, grabbing her boyfriend by the sleeve.  “Come on, Ron.”
“It’s not unpaid labour,” Harry tuts, picking, quite certain that it’s a kink to indulge him rather than any attempt to fulfil his emotional needs.  Even if it is his birthday.  “It’s paid in strawberries.  They’re cheap.  Who’re you texting?”
“You used to read my mind when I was twelve, and I don’t…”  This is a stupid thing to focus on, Harry knows, but it always comes back to him.  Why did you do that? he thinks.  It happened the first time he entered this room, after arriving with Ron in the car.  “Why did you do that?” he asks out loud, because there’s no one to hear him, even as he turns around.  The sound escapes into nothing, dead with no echo.  This isn’t the reason he’s here.  “And fifth year –”  I don’t know anyone who still believes that you cared about me.
“What is it?” Lupin pushes harder.  “That you’ll have to get by on your own for once?  I can imagine that you find the prospect difficult.”  This is a dig.
him an auror, Harry resists the urge to point out.
Returning to work, Harry has to deal with everything that’s found its way to his desk while he was on sabbatical.  He’s eventually distracted from Malfoy’s sexuality when he learns that Ginny’s renting somewhere in Hogsmeade, which he didn’t know but should have guessed, what with Neville.
Draco says nothing about the fact that it has barely turned April.
we all decided that the man had killed them.”  This is supposed to be a joke.
“Oh, mate, you’ve always been like this,” says Ron abruptly, and it makes Harry jump.
“But in any case,” James goes on, almost awkwardly, making Harry reconsider the man’s blasé attitude.  James is holding his beer, fingers wet with condensation.  “It’s not…”  He seems to make a decision.  “It’s a, ah, muggle treatment,” he succeeds in telling George.  “Lily heard about it from her hairdresser.”
It was instinct, Harry thinks, the first time that he considered Draco Malfoy’s innocence.
With a flick of her wand, she conjures Draco half of a set of earmuffs, to cover up the ear he’s exposed.  The muff is bright pink.
.  “We get on much better now.  She’s a lovely woman,” Malfoy finishes, frowning off towards the downstairs corner.  He sounds as though he’s describing a wallpaper pattern.  “Nothing about her’s my type.”
The feel of him makes Harry feverish.  “You can’t
“What’s going on over here?” Hermione’s voice then demanded, bright in the darkness, brusque and Hermione-like.  “I can see hugging – why is there hugging?”
“Why did you tell Scorpius that we’ve been going to the pub?” Harry demands, hot in his throat, everything returning to him the moment Mopsy leaves.
he writes before thinking.  All-wizarding households are allowed to mix indoors, but the Ministry has been telling employees that they should show solidarity.
With this, some of the wind seems to leave James Potter’s sails.  He grows serious, glancing at Granger and her boyfriend, then his son and Teddy, then Draco there against the wall.  His shoulders twitch, and something like sympathy turns in Draco’s chest, because it’s as though he feels hunted.  He looks very lonely, out of place in the centre of the room.
George accepts this, nodding his head as though he thinks that it’s true.  Harry’s not sure why.  He’s less easy to read than Ron, George, and he’s been quieter ever since Fred, as though he’s forever thinking of jokes instead of making them.  His hair’s thicker than Ron’s and much curlier.  “No Lily?” he asks last, and it’s strange.
“Harry?” Sirius asks him, looking confused.
He has a feeling that Draco’s conclusion has been deduced from no more than half an hour’s surface research and he’s not surprised by the findings; he’s surprised that they’re so very clear.  Maybe Draco’s just good at his job, but the people in this atrium have always told him that they pride themselves on their tact.
“No,” says Sirius simply, still nearly laughing, still scratching his hand.  Harry can hear the lie in his voice, only absent for a second, and James should be picking up on it, he thinks.  “He must have found it easy with Dora,” he carries on quickly, and he’s still
They didn’t snog, they didn’t shag, and they talked about quite a few things, eventually.  Harry never once smelled like sick or someone else, just himself – but he always left quickly in the morning, if he was ever there at all when Draco woke up.
ourselves with honour, in – due credit to our shared name of Lupin.”
“Of course, Master Harry,” Kreacher tells him croaking, affronted, his ears long and withered.  A well-raised house elf never says no.
“Auror Potter, I’ll show you!” Mopsy insists, not seeing Harry’s fingers.
“He kept doing the same thing, as though he expected different results.  Take the Hogwarts Express,” Draco offers, easing himself into the memory, which isn’t easy.  He’s not really answering the question, but that isn’t the point.  “A little slapdash in the execution, but equally obsessive and unnecessary.”  He rolls his eyes again, for effect.  Harry breathes hard down his nose.  Harry hates him, Draco remembers.  He deserves this.  “Extensive stalking.  Every trick of the trade…”
casting a disillusion,” Draco stated, because he was halfway to turned-on himself and he wanted nothing squelching on his head to ruin it.  Part of him remembered his mother, falling to her death as a carpet.
He looks at Harry.
He’s thinking of Draco, in honesty.  Draco’s the exception to many, many rules.
Harry means to call out to them – he knows that he should – but Lupin’s tone is low and scathing and angry, and Harry hesitates to interrupt.
“We’re going to tell him that we miss him, and that we want him to come home,” Hermione says, and Harry’s chest tightens.
Harry works for the Ministry of Magic.  He makes an Unbreakable Vow before Monday morning’s confidential meeting and he enters a room.  He’s briefed and briefs in return before he sets to work with memos, mostly, which magic will always keep more secure than any other form of encryption.  He has a team and he tells them what to do, but mostly he’s working from his office.  Reports flutter in and more meetings are set, the messages for his eyes only, anonymous.  Harry signs the responses
“Change doesn’t happen on its own, Harry,” Hermione’s insisting, and she’s been fired up by all the stuff with Harry’s mum and dad.  “We have to make it happen.  We have to seize every opportunity we can.”
“Git,” Harry tells him, a grin peeling over his face.
“This must be painfully boring for you,” Ron interrupts laconically, leaning towards Matías.  The man laughs as if to say
It happened when Draco was already dozing, a soft touch to his elbow and a whispered, “Don’t panic!” with a sharp C that was straight out of residential Surrey.  It happened when he was eating late-night toast in his kitchen before he turned in, giving him the option of starting a row or sliding into bed to be mauled by a bear in its sleep.
“What?” demands Harry, and it makes Malfoy laugh.
“Didn’t he, um, didn’t he tell you?” Granger asks carefully, as though it could ever be that simple.
Harry hears someone say in his head, and Harry’s not surprised to find out that Blaise Zabini is one of the marks for what he might know, though he’s not directly involved in criminal activity.  Draco won’t go directly to him, either.
“Me,” Potter corrects, looking down.  He doesn’t say anything else, sitting back with his tea.
When Harry goes to bed that night, he lets himself dream.  There’s a future ahead of him, he thinks; he thinks that he sees what it is.  There’s a lot of smut.
“Dad, what –?” Teddy asks him, looking worried and confused.
” James says now, breaking into Harry’s thoughts.  He’s tapping Sirius on the head with his wand.  It’s a gentle wind-up, in keeping with the sober surroundings, but it makes Sirius jump.  “Fancy meeting you here,” James says when Sirius looks up, tucking his wand into the back of his shorts.  He sounds smug, as though he’s solved a puzzle.  His expression says more, cutting and fond.
remains in the air, and for a moment Lupin seems lost behind one of his masks.  Draco knows the feeling.  “We’ll ask at reception, get some tea and – and a biscuit,” he concludes, desperate for a smoke, Draco’s sure.  “And that’ll be fine.”
“When I wasn’t in prison,” Sirius allows, his expression guarded.
This is a mess.
“I mean…”  Hermione’s still finishing her thought, and Harry can’t see it, where it ends.  He doesn’t know when this happened, because it can’t have been in the past couple of weeks.  “You-Know-Who destroyed their house in Godric’s Hollow, so it seems rather nice, doesn’t it?  The idea that your mum and dad should end up reclaiming the house he called his.”
There’s a light on, startling.  There’s Lupin, standing and leaning over Draco’s desk, wheezing a little as he breathes, poring over the forest-green ink of Draco’s thesis on the Killing Curse, taking notes.  His fingers fumble with the quill when Draco appears and he raises his head.
Which means this can’t be the nineties.
my best man.  Harry’s Hermione’s.”
Harry – "Malfoy, why are you doing this?”
“Hello Mopsy,” Harry interrupts, forcing a smile, remembering the message at Christmas.  He doesn’t think they’ve met, but he feels like he knows Mopsy; he’s heard stories and she’s had to deal with dear Spearow the owl.  “Is Draco upstairs?”  He’s been told that the upstairs living room is supposed to be kept smart for guests.
“Everything about you is dangerous to one’s health,” Draco jokes.  Though it’s true, what he says.  Harry has always felt like prickling in his chest, like fire under his ribs.  Even when they hated each other, supposedly.  Courage, in the face of despair, which can be dangerous, and hateful, and many other things too.  It always takes courage to crush oneself down into nothing.
“Let us look to the next ten years with hope and with unity,” he finishes, sounding like the Sorting Hat, by intention, another old scion of Gryffindor who’s neutral these days.  “These things are the essence of peace.  They arise in times of peace and they create it; let them be ours.”
She pauses, having run into dragons.  Draco glances at Granger’s boyfriend, who on the sofa next to her is studiously looking at the ceiling moulds.  He’s thinking about engagement rings again, and children.  The thoughts remarkably never look like fear.
He looks up, down to 3.1.5 in his check.
” Harry tells Hermione, reading her face.
“The bear spent all last night watching us.  Don’t tell me that you didn’t get off on it.”)
Draco’s close to Lupin.  Harry’s seen them together, smoking and saying things in Latin, laughing about the sort of thing Hermione explains earnestly over the course of ten minutes.
Draco laughs in their faces.
“My flat,” says Draco, mustering his deliberation.
” Harry asks, feeling contrary, holding his book, trying to remember if he likes sour beer.  The Leaky Cauldron doesn’t serve it.  “What’s beet?  D’you mean
“D’you think they’ll know, at the desk?”
Harry rolls onto his back and tries to look thoughtful, wearing pyjama bottoms and a quidditch shirt to cover his chest.  “We could go for a walk,” is his suggestion, because he’s actually changing the subject.
“In a
Harry felt his face burn, because this felt like a personal question.  “Well,” he said.  “I thought I’d put Sirius with Hermione.  They’re both fruit-bearing – blackthorn and vine.”
it was too soon,” he finally settles on.  “I should have said something.”
Then the doorbell rings with a short sharp buzz, and it all gets ten times worse.
(“I don’t like the thought of you out in the forest, not without anyone with you,” Hagrid has been telling Harry for years.  He’s the only one who knows that Harry runs.
“And he’s managed it all on his own,” McGonagall humours him, before waving him out of her office.  “At least among those who matter,” she adds like a snob, and Harry assumes that this is a joke, or else that he must have misheard.
Eventually, they go on a walk.  For most of it they’re holding hands.  For the rest of it Harry’s backed against a tree.
“Every student in your year was sent an invitation,” says McGonagall neutrally, and this is the first word that Harry’s heard about it.  He has a feeling that
He lets it go.  The interview continues and Harry relaxes into his answers, most of them practised.  It feels like it’s going well.
Teddy has plans, as he has done nearly all summer, to meet up with AJ, AJ’s brother and a mix of their friends at the skate park.  They’re making the most of the long days and they’re all ten or twelve now, keen to be off on their own.
“Unspeakable
Why the fuck would
From the corner of his eye he catches sight of Harry in his sunglasses and his jacket, which Harry’s still adjusting on his shoulders.
Albus is looking between his sister and his parents, clenching his jaw as though waiting for Lily to be humiliated like he’s been.  But the problem is that Lily never takes things to heart the same way as Albus.  Harry doesn’t know how to shout at her.
“What –?” demands Moony, before he shakes his head.  “Are you alone?” he changes the question.
Harry casts his unicorn to the sand.  It’s familiar; it makes him laugh.  He misses the wolf a little – Harry can see its teeth in the sharpness of the unicorn’s horn, and he was horribly unfair to it, he thinks.  “
“A’ight,” Teddy declares, sounding frustrated but as though he’s going to hold in his tantrum.  “Whatever,” he adds, and Harry thinks that this is because he wants to sound cool.
The man looks at him like he’s falling apart, flapping his arms uselessly.  “Then what?” he demands, with a furious sniff.  “This is some Lord of the Dead rubbish if it’s anything, and I want an answer.  I want to know how long he’s here for.”  He counts on his fingers.  “I want to know why he looks like he’s our age – he died when he was twenty-one, for Merlin’s sake, and was born fifty years ago.  It makes no sense at all.”
“Draco!”  The shout comes from the doorway, just as there’s a shimmer in the air, like heat, sending the gust of sparks into a dust cloud.  Not a second later, Granger has apparated to his left-hand side and is dispelling the sparks into white light.  She’s shouting at Potter, who isn’t Harry but his father, “Are you
It’s true that Harry never saw with his own eyes what happened to Hogwarts in seventh year.  He’s heard plenty.  He treads as carefully as he can.  “If Snape hadn’t been there, the Carrows –”
It’s Vespers Avalorne, his boss.
“I’ve got my Firebolt,” Harry says, feeling the weight of his hands on his knees.  It’s difficult to raise his eyes from the shape of the broomstick.  It’s difficult to speak.
“I know,” George seems to agree with something that James hasn’t said.  He grins, as though this is funny.  “I don’t believe it either.”
“He’s been dithering about proposing for months,” Hermione tells Harry, fondly with a sarcastic look.
,” now Harry’s dad is swearing over Harry’s shoulder, the weight of him heavy and violent, pushing forward, his face all tense muscle, bright, his hand hard and hot on Harry’s fingers, crushing.  “When I’m through with you –”
Draco wonders whether he should have a go at the man about Nymphadora.  She should have been told all of this, if Lupin had any sense of decency.  She didn’t deserve to be –
He likely wouldn’t have been punished so harshly if he’d been able to explain what was going on at home.  He didn’t because he understands the Statute of Secrecy, its importance above all else.
“I don’t at all understand why not,” Draco says, because he doesn’t.
A little more awake, after a shower, he tells himself that he’s sending a card to mess with Draco’s head, actually, and when he’s at the newsagent he buys the most hideous example he can find, all glitter and balloons and kissing bears.  The bears are getting more action than they are, and Harry wonders if he’s being passive aggressive.
The answer was Jägermeister, which was on Harry’s internal list of banned substances.  It was one of Ginny’s favourites.  He had two doubles, one after the other, and they made him feel like he was walking through a forest.
(“He’s mine.”)
And he didn’t say it was Draco, but he confirmed that he’s been seeing someone, because he couldn’t let it go
myself, Harry.”
“A little close to home, no?” Harry’s dad directs at Harry, as though he can’t help interfering.
“What?” Harry asks, not having heard the question.  “Oh,” he says, realising.  “Nah, course not.”
He’s hit with something in the chest, then.  It’s a warm feeling – but it’s also plainly
Instead, he pierces the shell of his new veil with a copper knut, flicking it with his thumb through the cage’s bars.  The coin finds the centre of the sphere and holds there, suspended.  Most importantly, it’s visible.
“What the fuck is going on?” Draco whispers to Harry, looking around them, at the sun.  It was dark when they first came outside.
James makes a face.  “
The feel of Harry’s hand in the Forest of Dean isn’t tentative but knowing, urgent and a little cool but firm enough to make a man wheeze.  He’s pulling and he’s reaching around to grope Draco’s backside, pushing the dressing gown aside, kissing him and kissing him and sucking on his neck and pulling him close on stumbling feet, their shins and calves all wet together, denim rough between their legs, bright sparks across Draco’s skin.
“Does he have experience in the field?” McGonagall maybe rephrases the question, giving Harry a look for being self-deprecating.
“Mother used to have a crup-cross called Barnabas.”  He’s already finishing his paragraph, Malfoy – Harry can see.  He’s casting his eye to the page number.
There isn’t coffee enough for this, Draco thinks as he pours in the milk.  It’s been a very stressful day.
“They’ll have to go back eventually,” Draco agrees, refusing to react though it disturbs him to hear Harry talk about love like this, to really mean it.  To really mean anything, in all honesty.  He keeps his arms under the duvet.  “Death is the end of things.  But it doesn’t mean that they won’t be here for another hundred years.”
The whole evening had been odd.  Harry had popped by Draco’s flat on his way downstairs, told him that there was no such thing as being fashionably late and dragged him to the drawing room before anyone else could arrive.  Granger had been worrying about getting Jools Holland on a screen somewhere.  They’d each tried one of Kreacher’s cocktails, which had tasted like lemons and ginger and treacle, strong enough to cleave one’s gullet in two.  After that, they’d stuck together, and Harry had snickered while Draco had made catty comments about his guests.
“Well, go on then,” Harry allows.
Draco pauses.  “Oh yes?”
Pressure on the two-second bubble is like things coming close to Harry’s body.  It’s just like being in the air.
He wondered, sometimes, if she’d simply never left him, from the day when she’d been dragged through the halls of his parents’ house like a prize, like a girl, like the truth; when she’d looked at him with tears in her glassy eyes, water falling to her cheeks.
,” he says, echoing Granger’s intonation.  “You two, you know my little Harry, and he’s grown up a man.”
And Harry explained, stilted at first.
It was his fault, Draco knew, this situation.  It was his fault, and everyone like him.  Everything that he’d ever wanted to be.
“Harry,” Hermione is warning, sat at the table.
“I’ll have to do some analysis,” Draco tells him shortly, non-verbally ending the charm.  “That much is obvious.”  The ghosts – the muggle ghosts – Draco should have recognised them, but he only knew them on hearing their screams, frightened as though their souls were being sent to torment, the woman surely recognising his face.  Nothing like Sara Chaudhury and her daughter, no matter that they’re safe now, that they’re free.  “I don’t know why they were down here.”
and Harry can see how Minerva feels forced into a corner, because she can’t afford to lose her authority, nor that of her staff.
Draco laughed, at least, which felt like victory.  They talked about the fact that the only good tofu Harry’s ever had was in Japan, and whether saying so made him a nob.  “Yes,” was Draco’s answer.  “But that doesn’t make it less true.  I know a place in Soho; we’ll go there.”
“Well,” says James, mock-sagely, unperturbed by Sirius raising his voice.  “It takes a lot to sate Moony Lupin’s curiosity.”
“I know you have him round when I’m not here,” Teddy says, his amber eyes narrow and shrewd, though really he has missed a lot.  Harry’s not told Ron or Hermione either.  It’s embarrassing; he was lonely last Saturday after their walk and wanted Malfoy to try his next batch of beer, which was better than the first.  “I thought that you were being saddos together,” Teddy goes on.  “Now I’m wondering if you canoodle.”  He makes a noodling gesture with his fingers.
“I’ve never had Dumbledore so angry with me,” Moony’s saying, laconic, his mouth twitching as though he might be proud of the fact.  “No one was supposed to find him.  Not before 1991 and his much anticipated début.”
Remus declares, out of control and sounding like Harry’s dad.  Something dies.
This statement has no bearing on how Lupin continues.  “We know that Lily…”  In an instant Lupin is arch, withdrawn.  “But she died for Harry, James, so that may change things.  And Sirius wasn’t there at all.”
Harry ducks his head and looks away, taking in the room.  Sirius and his dad are having a silent, glancing conversation.  Hermione and Ron look less tired, though Hermione looks – different somehow?  Harry can’t place it.
would never lead a woman on.”  He snorted, to imagine it.  After all, if Harry had been leading Ginny on at Christmas then he’d been leading her on for years, hadn’t he?
”  Harry wants to protect him.  Aunt Petunia makes a sound of outrage, and that’s dangerous.  “Dad, let’s go, it’s not –”
“For now,” Harry told Lupin, “I think that I can set up the four of you as complementary to the four of us.  So you’ll be allowed in and out, not really because you’re part of the house, but because you’re an exception to the rule of what doesn’t belong.  If that makes sense.”
Dismissively, Sirius waves a hand, and that’s much more familiar.  He’s adapting to the idea even as they talk.  He and Harry’s dad are both like that.  “Let me worry about what we do when we get there.  I’m not entirely useless,” he mocks his earlier panic.
The gesture immediately makes Granger drop her spoon with a clatter and cover her face with her hands.  Most of her hair is clipped back, but there’s still a heavy frame of it, bunching over her shoulders.  She breathes heavily.
Harry can’t imagine Ron phrasing it this way, but Hermione does need to be told to leave off sometimes, the same way that Ron needs to be told to pull his finger out.  “OK,” he allows.
He remembers the tension between them, outside the pub.  He told Teddy that he and Draco weren’t serious, but he remembers the counsellor working them through Ginny’s feelings, not too far off a year ago now, them both sat prickling around Ginny’s phone on the table.  He remembers the feeling in his chest, because he knew when she was talking – he just knew.
Draco wrenches himself loose.  “If you’re here for a chinwag,” he says, not really focusing, “I’m afraid that I cannot oblige.”  He gestures dismissively.  “I’ve been quite busy and now…  If you’ll…”
The room went still.  James froze, staring at Sirius, and he looked nothing like himself.  “You’ll do what, Padfoot?”
“I had a godson, once,” Sirius confides.  “He was as bad at this as you.”
Clenching his jaw, Sirius looks over Harry’s shoulder, through the gates.  “He owes Gary and Tone everything,” he says, talking about something that Harry doesn’t understand.  “He made them one promise,” he insists with a finger.  “And he is so
Harry looks around them, at the way back to the castle and the forest, both eerie in moonlight.  There’s the sound of owls hooting, hunting, rustling trees.  “I’m talking to you,” he tells Sirius, because there’s no one else here besides Buckbeak, who’s focused on the grass.
.  “So?” he asks through his toothpaste, shrugging.
“Tell me what’s wrong,” Draco suggests, still holding his leg, his thumb finding the slit of soft skin that remains around the scar, high and hidden near Harry’s groin.
“Yeah, I don’t get it,” Ron’s saying, and Harry finds himself swallowing.  “You broke up with Gin to fuck a bloke,” he tells Harry, when this isn’t what he said; he opened a door; he didn’t…  “It’s been six months and you’ve got a bloke on the line who likes fucking.  I mean, there are more difficult sums.”
Draco doesn’t answer the question.  “I’m very busy.”
“Would you like to go to France?” Draco asks lightly, and Harry loves him again for not commenting on the sad, hidebound nature of Harry’s existence.  His fingers rake into Harry’s hair.
There’s the sound of movement, so Harry pulls away from the wall.  “There’s no need, Hermione,” he says, just as she comes into the hallway.
“Though, wait.”  She looks up, her frown complete.  “The school holidays aren’t till next week.  How –”
“You don’t remember this?” asks Harry’s dad.
Draco assumed that he was drunk, but it was no clear thing.
They’re both useless by the time Ron comes home.
Harry yanks his head out of the pensieve.
“He’s fit,” Harry points out, hoping that he’s getting some sleep in time for tomorrow.
Harry blinks, but he knows what to say, because it’s true.  “It doesn’t matter.”
He wishes that he could learn to drive a car every day.  It’s fun.  “You know, Malfoy,” he says, because he thinks that he can get away with it, here.  “Sometimes it feels weird that I’m in love with you.”
Harry imagines them plotting in their pyjamas every night as they get into bed.  The prospect doesn’t seem unlikely, now that he thinks about it.  It would explain why they never need to catch up over breakfast.
Good, Draco wants to think, the way that he always would have done.
“Er…”
The man starts at the name, turning towards Draco’s voice.  He’s tall enough and straight-backed, more like Draco’s own stature and bearing than those of the man whom he recognises.  His hair is just as wild, but there’s more art to its tweaks and its turns.  There is no familiarity in this man’s expression, no mocking humour or hate but merely raw, easy contempt, a frown which frames cold eyes of some neutral colour that isn’t very interesting.
Harry’s dad cuts over this, incredulous.  “
“He’s still around?” Sirius asks, presumably as someone who only does the crossword.  “What’s he doing these days?”
” he says, the words the beginning of a lecture, his tone tortured.
It’s a cup final, inevitably, and the scores have been close: Gryffindor needs to win by twenty points to take the cup; Slytherin only needs to win.  All Harry wants is for Lily and Albus to both have a good game.
At the memorial, with this in mind, Harry finds another tray and swaps his glass, drinks the next and takes another, holds it to his lips, breathing and feeling the bubbles tingle up his nose.  He doesn’t feel good about himself.  He feels nervous, on edge.
Draco gives him a look.
Harry has three hats now: the original green, one blue and one brown.  This one’s the blue, which is the right colour for Malfoy’s pale complexion, the pink in his cheeks and the deep bottle green of his scarf.
When he appears there, lights are already on.  There’s someone else, snuck in and startled to see him.
Dumbledore tries.
“Eye contact?” Lupin asks.
“Don’t pretend,” he insists, and Draco knows that he’s begging for his friends to back him up.  “Don’t pretend that he hasn’t spent all this time
“Potter –” his mother says next, but it isn’t her, is it?
“So what?” he asked, fingers pressing Draco’s fly down neat.  He sounded content.
he says, perfectly polite as Mrs Figg turns off the television.
There are tears in his voice now, but his glasses obscure them.  “Harry…” Black begins.
Draco shakes his head, feeling love, feeling grief, feeling the cool, damp air that fills the veil room of the Department of Mysteries.  There are tears in his eyes and it’s still raw, after all these years.
One day he’ll listen when Hermione talks about floss, he tells himself, but for now this doesn’t matter – he dashes downstairs, skimming the edges of the treads, hoping that there’s at least
His eyes are wet, green, begging.  Draco’s seen this look on Harry before, and he wonders if this is what Harry’s been meaning to say all along.  Not
“I…”  Harry doesn’t know what to say, besides the part about shaving, which would not be well received.  There are too many thoughts in his head, all half finished, all too complicated to explain.
“Hm,” agreed Harry, not saying anything about Draco’s father.  “Is that the one with the Princes in the Tower?”
“But their little faces when they win…” Harry defends daft fathers everywhere, remembering how easy it was to let himself lose.  “Though, yeah,” he concedes, walking along.  “I’m not sure that Ginny ever found it attractive.”  Ginny likes winning.  This will always be true.  He’d also been blown up by the time that James turned five.
James sighs, sparing a glance at Sirius’s chest, which is essentially exposed to the air.  “I can hardly take you out like that,” he says, and it’s somehow a joke.  He’s pouring himself a cup of tea, which he almost certainly won’t drink.  “You’re barely decent.  My wife won’t stop telling me about the state of the plughole.  It’s been putting her off.”
Lily’s spiteful expression whips between everyone taller than her, blanching white instead of pink.  But then she’s going too.  “
“Granted, it’s never been as strong as the one which sees Padfoot and makes him want to roll over – perish the thought – but it’ll give him a –”
He was getting away with it, but this time, the moment that Harry says Draco’s name, Pansy cringes.
There’s a tremor in his arm, grazed by Draco’s hair, but he can feel the strength returning to it, biting down on his teeth.  Its colour is definitely bronze.  He presses his other hand to Draco’s silvery scarred sternum and it’s heavy, weak.  His fingers are red and hot and Draco feels cold, the way that he must have been when he was near death, his scars then new cuts, pouring out blood.
Granger’s squeezing Harry on the elbow, tutting over the mirror with Ron, who’s soon checking over the drinks bottles and pulling flakes of glass from glass.
After pizza, when they’re all much less sober – Ron got started with the Gryffindor dads – they find themselves on the obvious topic.
“See, when he’s like this, he’s all right,” Harry murmurs ungenerously, barely loud enough to hear, especially with Granger in the background.  He’s got an arm stretched down the back cushions, facing his father, and the tips of his fingers are pulling lightly at the longer strands of Draco’s hair.  They’re not talking about it, and neither of them are leaning away.  Draco’s hoping that no one can see, trying to work out why someone who hates him can sit so very close.  He feels quite tired, and it is certainly the wine.  “You can look at him and think…  But he’s just a man, you know?  He’s my dad, but it doesn’t feel right.” He taps his chest.  “It doesn’t feel like it should.”
Ron’s told Harry that he should be going out with George, if he wants to go out.  “Angelina knows all the best places,” he’s said.  “Always has done.”  Harry never knew.
It’s a feather, long and swooping, all tendrils like chrysanthemum petals – clean, warm white like the heart of a flame.  It’s a phoenix feather, Harry knows, feeling struck, no matter his age.
.  “You are
He doesn’t look like his father at all, now that the man is resting back into the small conservatory sofa.  James Potter occupies the space with one ankle hooked over the other, an arm stretched out to frame his wife’s shoulders.  Harry, meanwhile, is hunching down over his glass, slumped towards the chair arm between him and Draco.
They should have let go, after a few moments, and later on Draco would tell himself that they did.  But there was also a brief exchange beforehand, and Draco found himself staring into green eyes that everybody loved, reminding himself that his feelings were nothing, or at least nothing special.
The expression on his face is wry, accepting, pulling into a smirk.  Harry’s attracted to men, is the thing.  He could be attracted to Ron, if he wanted to.  He doesn’t know why he never realised, before he was locked up in his house.
“Oh, I was being held captive,” says Harry’s dad dismissively, wrinkling his nose and not quite looking at them.  “Only for a couple of weeks.  Twenty-three days.  It was character-building; it doesn’t matter.”  He jokes, his eyes wide, “It wasn’t like I had to cut off a limb.”
“Maybe you should ask him,” his daughter suggests, sounding like a teenage girl, playing with the ear of her pikachu.  “Or Mr Malfoy.”  She widens her eyes and opens her mouth, mockingly, as though shocked by her own burn.  It’s been a few weeks and she’s young, or else someone in the castle has helped her make peace with the future to come.
“He’s still on about Alice,” Lupin confirms, the paper covering half of his face.
“What are you talking about?” asks Draco, with little intonation.
Draco didn’t know what to say, his mind caught on the memory of Harry Potter sucking him down.  “What?” he asked.  “No, Luna,” he said, catching up.  “If you tell me, then it won’t be a secret.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say.  “What?” is all he says.  Lily’s grown up with same-sex marriage quite normal, he supposes.  It’s nice, if confusing right now.  He was expecting his children to call him a liar and a bastard and – gay, if he’s honest.  Everything was gay in Teddy’s primary school, for an odd phase when he was nine or ten.  Not
.  He did his best to keep me good.”
It’s his
”), not Lupin, and this only makes Harry angrier.
Harry finds him when Draco goes home one day to his flat.  It’s past nine in the morning and not yet four: he should have been fine.  He’s annoyed that his calculations aren’t correct, not here and not at work either, and he’s
Harry’s in love with his friends, he sometimes thinks in a panic.  It’s something Ginny used to say as a joke, but sometimes Harry’s sure it must be true.
“What?” Harry demands before he can stop himself.
And he can’t stop his thoughts about beetles, even as his hands dig under t-shirt to skin.  The windows are open behind the curtains, because Harry can’t sleep without fresh air at this time of year, and he’s more than happy to keep Draco warm.  There needs to be some sort of magical window netting, he thinks, built into the wards.
This spell always belonged to that man.
“… The thing is with me and Ginny,” he was saying.  “We were never a thing.  All we did was procrastinate.  She went out with Dean for months, you know, in school.  We snogged
Meeting Harry’s eyes, Draco’s are rimmed red, Harry notices.  His hair is greasy; his skin is pale and dry.  He can’t have got in until four or five, and –
It’s lack of sleep and the clear, if basic, resemblance which makes Draco address him as he does.  “
Draco isn’t sure what he’s looking for when he enters the man’s mind, making eye contact and casting a spell on himself rather than Black.  It’s clear, just from the feel of him, that Black is a reasonably well-practised occlumens, which is a relief, in all honesty.  It shouldn’t be possible for Draco to find anything too embarrassing or unpleasant – which gives him the confidence to root around swiftly for memories of Malfoy,
When he gets back to London, Harry forgets that he’s been asked to stop writing to Malfoy.
“You’re taking a sabbatical, Harry,” Percy tells him, tapping a finger to his desk, a sarcastic git and really one of Harry’s good friends.  For him, the Ministry has only ever worked one way.  “It says so on this form.”
“It’s a hazing thing,” Harry says, eyes shut, wrapping arms around him.  He’s willing his cock to settle under the weight of Draco’s hips, which bring their own jutting pressure.  “We go in and make fun of anyone who shows weakness.”
Things go on like this for a while.
Lupin scoffs, most of his words swallowed by the cigarette in his mouth.  “I lived most my life without my bestest chums.”
Ginny cried when she reported this, so Harry knows that she feels guilt.  She has so much love for their children.  He can’t understand what she was thinking at the time, and this is why they’re getting divorced.
“No,” Draco told him, quite easily, his own body finally warming under the heavy duvet.  “No talking at all, really.”
Disorientated, Harry looks up.  This is November 1981, he knows.  He told his dad that he was fine with it.  The past can’t hurt him.  And it’s fine, it’s –
“You used to tell me,” James begins again.  Sirius cringes, as though expecting to hear something embarrassing.  “You’d tell me that one day, one of his
