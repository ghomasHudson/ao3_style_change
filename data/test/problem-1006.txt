Malfoy only frowned at him. “You’re going to have to be a lot looser than this if you want decent photos, Potter. You look like you’re about to face your boggart. Not very seductive.”
Thankful for the deflection, Harry allowed himself to relish in the warmth seeping through the porcelain. Considering the very real possibility that it could be poisoned, he sipped at the fragrant tea as calmly as he could under the circumstances.
Another sudden round of cheering brought his attention to Neville Longbottom, who (only after the insistence of Harry) had come along. The newly-fit Hogwarts Herbology Professor was over by the counter, bravely planting a drunken kiss square on the barmaid's mouth. The woman was swooning.
Potter, however, was laying flat on his back in a large puddle of bubbling liquid, groaning.
Harry's eyes widened, momentarily thrown. "Er – are you alright?”
Seamus' eyes went impossibly wide, pointing from Harry to the leaving girls. "What was that just then? What did I miss? Harry, I left you alone for ten minutes!"
“Can’t tell you that.” the Minister said gravely. Before Harry could respond, he reached into an upper robe pocket and produced a small piece of parchment, which he held out.
Harry spun on his heel and complied, finding his way to the center of the wall. He pressed his back into the solid surface and, not knowing what to do with his hands, crossed his arms over his chest.
Harry reached for his pocket, plucking out the little dictionary and smiled at her apologetically. He flipped through the pages until he found something he could use, “Er -
"Hurry up," Malfoy snapped.
“You didn’t know I was in Paris?” Harry wanted to clarify. “You had no idea I was going to be in your studio tonight?”
" He threw the pillow down and squinted at the alarm clock in dismay. Almost immediately, he let out a low groan and clutched his aching head.
“Just let me out,” Harry pleaded, unwilling to hear whatever accusations Malfoy would make about his character before tomorrow, when he’d be free to explain. “Please.”
" she intoned sarcastically, throwing her straight black hair over her shoulder and tipping her nose upwards.
The memory of him and Seamus clasping hands in a firm shake swam forward, and he recalled the bright purple light that pulsed from their palms as Harry repeated the oath. What
“What?”
He felt his eyebrows creep up. “Everything?”
“Well,” Potter chuckled, as if something was quaintly amusing. “I don’t know why I said that out loud. I was only thinking it. I missed seeing you around.” He propped himself up on his elbows, fixing Draco with an intense stare as he barrelled on in that serene tone. “It’s usually the highlight of my day, you know. Seeing you in that lab coat with your fancy hair and your perfect face.”
The moment he tumbled into the drawing room of the Manor, Malfoy held out his hand and said “wand.”
Harry grinned. “I like the way you say my name.”
“Here,” Malfoy stepped into Harry’s personal space again, hands finding the knot in his tie. It was tied tight, probably due to the fact that he’d dressed angrily, so he was stuck staring at the blond up close until he finally got it loose.
Even with whatever the hell "boo-dwar" meant. Honestly, he hadn't even been arsed to ask-
"You don't even know what happened!"
are you doing?”
“Er- yeah. Thanks,” he said, blushing.
a romantic interest.
Harry clenched his teeth and reluctantly dropped his wand into Malfoy’s outstretched hand. He felt strange already without it - bare and vulnerable.
Draco chuckled. He’d been on a cloud and Harry was
Harry scowled. “No!”
He scrambled for something to say. “Well, he’s … handsome….”
Her mouth formed a small "o" of surprise as she sat frozen. "I.... I don't know how to dance."
flirting," he said.
Harry scowled at him. “Fine,” he growled and his hands flew to the front of his robes, unfastening the clasp. “Just -- fine.” He shrugged them off, rolled the cloth up into a ball and tossed it at Malfoy, who caught it easily. “Tell me what you want me to do.”
Harry’s jaw dropped. He’d forgotten about that part of the plan entirely. The fact that he’d lost himself so completely was more than a little worrying. “I have to go,” he blurted, brushing past Malfoy and out to the front door. He crossed the lobby in four long steps and tried the door, only to find it locked.

"If I had my glasses on, it would have hit you.”
,” he murmured, flipping through more pages before shrugging helplessly. “Photography studio?”
The blond sighed, retrieved the key to unlock the door, and held it open.
“You don’t know,” the blond repeated, practically tearing himself away as he turned to face the opposite wall, quietly mumbling a stream of French that probably wasn’t very polite. Harry watched him, more than a little curious. The possibility that he could break Malfoy’s composure, even a little bit, was enormously interesting. When Malfoy turned back around, his expression was neutral and he simply lifted his camera, apparently intent on ignoring the lapse in Harry’s sanity. Malfoy leapt back into his work, only now he stuck to ordering Harry around instead of going anywhere near him.
Harry batted Seamus' hand off and held the paper away, grinning. "Nice try."
Harry took it carefully, flipping it over to see a handful of words scrawled in a random, disconnected order.
The other man shook his head from side to side slowly, and gave Harry a reassuring pat on the back. "Yes, absolutely. Which is why you should give me that number so it doesn't go to waste."
Harry blinked.
"I hope I'm not being rude," she began in a clear British accent, white teeth flashing behind red lips. "I couldn’t help but notice that the legendary Harry Potter was sitting over here all alone."
Harry was tempted to roll his eyes, but he barely resisted. Instead, he gave her a tight smile and sent a furtive glance towards the door. "My friend actually just left. He'll be right back.”
"Oof!" Malfoy exclaimed, falling heavily on top of Harry. The camera, thankfully, swung to the side and out of the way and Harry’s hands immediately reached up to find Malfoy’s sides, toying with the bunched fabric of his shirt. "Potter,” he began, lifting himself up onto his elbows.
distracting, and he hadn’t thought his cover story through at all. But Merlin, Harry was suddenly unsure if he'd ever had his hair touched like this before. He was sorely tempted to close his eyes.
was inescapable; the weight and heat of the Auror’s body covered his own from chest to thighs, and he could feel the definition in those muscles that lie hidden from view - the same ones he’d seen once when he’d been called down to the Auror’s training room for work and had thought about for weeks.
to lean in closer to get more of.
Harry waited until the door clicked shut behind them before he took the nearest chair and rolled his shoulders to loosen them. He was hyper-aware of Malfoy moving silently to take the seat next to him, and the air carried over the subtle scent of his cologne - the same scent he’d noticed during their second actual fight that seemed ages ago now, the one where Harry had pinned him to the floor and Malfoy had gotten a fistful of Harry’s hair, nearly pulling it out from the feel of it. Harry had felt a rush of
“And funny?”
“It’s alright, Potter, I’ve no desire to run to the press about you being bent. It’s not like I have room to judge you there.”
“Harry,” Draco meant to say it evenly, but it came out as a sigh.
"This was specifically requested in your owl," Malfoy shrugged. "Grab a towel and cover up, then remove the pants.”
Harry nodded. “We use it for interrogations. Makes it impossible to hide what they’re feeling. The combination must make people . . . verbally wear their heart on their sleeve.”
Harry suddenly thought he now understood what was going on and suppressed a weary groan.
“We accidentally discovered a new potion, so we should name it.”
Harry followed her line of sight and found the small group of people that must have been her friends, standing at the far end of the pub, staring over at them with varied expressions of amusement and doubt.
“If I didn’t believe you, you’d already be out on your arse,” Malfoy told him matter-of-factly, crossing his arms in front of him.
Distantly, there was the sound of the door opening, a gasp, and then a flash of light before the world went dark.
She let out a sudden laugh that ended in a snorting noise, which made her hands fly up to cover her face. "Sorry," she giggled again, glancing over her shoulder for a moment. "I suppose that's true, at least."
It occurred to him that if Malfoy told him to leave, he would be forced to do just that. The spell would undoubtedly be broken. He felt hope bloom in his chest and he chose his next words carefully. “Malfoy . . . if you don’t believe me, you don’t have to accept my business. If you tell me to leave, I won’t blame you.”
Harry then demanded Seamus buy him drinks, and spent the night in a depressed mood, pouring his heart out and lamenting his rotten luck and equally rotten taste in friends.
When he didn’t miraculously wake up in his bed, he sighed, cursing Seamus and his stupid bet. Speaking of which, he’d apparently gone through quite a bit of trouble to set this up. He planned it, paid in advance, and even dressed him for it. Had Seamus known who the photographer was? Because it was almost as if he’d been set up on a-
“Whozzat?” groaned Ron. He had lifted his head and was squinting at the newcomer. “Malfoy?”
“Or maybe you’re just afraid.” The corner of Malfoy’s lips were creeping up minutely. “I’m
The two of them were nearly biting their lips to hide their obvious grins. Before Harry could say anything more, Margie took a deep breath and stood up from the table, politely nodding to Harry. "Well, I must be on my way, Monsieur Potter. I'm glad to 'ave met you, and I 'ope you enjoy your time in Paris. Seamus, would you mind . . . ?"
Malfoy cleared his throat and quickly removed his hands. "Your hair's a nightmare. A glaringly unchanged feature, Potter. I think it’s safe to assume it’s hopeless at this point. Well, out with it! I need to know what sort of photo shoot we’ll be doing."
Harry nodded, clearing his throat awkwardly. When Malfoy had been hired on as an Unspeakable, it had taken them nearly a year to stop hexing each other in the corridors. Twice, their arguments had become physical, and Shacklebolt had been the one to break them up both times. They’d both been suspended. A month later, Harry approached Malfoy to call a truce. He wanted to take his Auror career seriously, and so he needed to let the rivalry go. Malfoy had nodded curtly in agreement, and that was how this awkward not-quite-acquaintanceship had started. Without Malfoy’s sneer and biting words to distract him, Harry began noticing, to his deep consternation, that his heart rate would still spike whenever they were in the same room. His body, it seemed, had not gotten the memo that he no longer wanted to pick a fight with the git every chance he got. Old habits, he guessed.
“Yes, Ron,” Harry muttered, releasing the protective charms on the second drawer of his desk and pulling out the familiar piece of silvery fabric.
“Due to the nature of this assignment, and the magical statutes that protect our way of life and the operation of the Ministry - not to mention the sensitivity of the location,” Shacklebolt was saying as he stood from his chair and walked around the giant desk. He looked down at him from his impressive height and frowned. “I’m afraid there is not much I can tell you about this mission.”
The door slammed shut before he could manage a word.
immune to charm, thank you very much. He was an accomplished Occlumens. He’d never met an
"Yes.
Maybe he'd meant "the camera," but the magic within Harry seemed to be taking him a little more literally than that. Malfoy stood a few paces away, his eyes hidden by the expensive-looking piece of equipment. So Harry felt his gaze rove slowly over the blond (once again) as he worked, from the dark tailored trousers to the narrow waist accentuated with a leather belt. He noticed the way the shirt was beginning to untuck itself from the waistband of the trousers when Malfoy crouched over to choose a different lens from a case by the door. His gaze followed the path of his torso, lingering on the exposed forearms that Harry suddenly had a worrying temptation to touch, and continued up past his shoulders and toward the part of the man's head that he could still see. The hair was just as platinum blond as he remembered, but instead of being gelled back or hanging loosely around his face, it looked soft and was arranged in a way that reminded him of those male fashion models wearing suits that probably cost more than twice his earnings at the Ministry – war hero status or not. It just wasn't fair, and Harry wanted to mess it up. Mentally groaning at his own thoughts, he bit his lower lip in an attempt to keep them to himself. He was very grateful for the concealment charm that kept his interest hidden. Things would have gotten awkward as what was very obviously full-blown attraction made itself known in Harry’s tumultuous thoughts. If he’d been attracted to Malfoy as an adolescent (which he had spent a few eye-opening nights alone discovering), it was nothing compared to how his body reacted to this older, more sophisticated version. “Gladly.” The response had flown from his thoughts to his mouth too quickly for Harry to stop it. His voice had pitched low and traitorously
His heart leapt. “My glasses,” he mumbled, stumbling as he checked under the chaise. Something appeared next to his head and Harry blinked at it. His eyes followed the familiar shape of his thin black frames to the blond man holding them out. “Thanks,” he said, barely above a whisper. He took them and slid them on, watching Draco Malfoy materialize in front of him.
A few moments later, the fog weighing on Harry's consciousness cleared and the pain in his head washed away like rain. "Impressive," he sighed in relief.
His jaw was set and his eyes were wide. “So, about this boyfriend of yours.”
Harry’s hands had pulled the shirt free and were now drawing circles on his skin. Instead of answering, he lifted his head to close the distance and gently brushed his lips against Malfoy’s, marveling in the sparks of sensation that it caused. Though the blond was still, Harry moved his lips lightly, barely making contact against his mouth in a teasing invitation. For added measure, he drove his hips upwards, his erection grinding into Malfoy’s groin through the blanket.
“Better, now that you’re here,” Potter said without hesitation.
. . .” he began, hoping she could understand his probably horrible pronunciation. “
"Non, I live in Lyon, but I visit Paris often. When I 'eard of France 'osting ze World Cup, I could not miss it."
Harry cursed under his breath the moment Malfoy disappeared into another room behind the desk. His feet tingled from the magic that rooted him to the spot, but he glanced at the door longingly. A dreadful thought occurred to him. He was trapped by magic, forced to follow the every command of The Biggest Prat Alive, whose sole ambition in life at one time seemed to be driving him insane - who
“The trousers, too.”
“Ginny’s gotten pretty good,” Harry mumbled innocently enough, nursing his freshly refilled goblet of something French he couldn’t pronounce.
Shacklebolt raised one eyebrow. “Do you refuse? You realize I’ll have no choice but to Obliviate you if you are.”
Malfoy grabbed a miniature snow globe from Harry’s workspace, turning it over in his hands. He leaned against the wooden desk and watched the snow fall. “Because you’re predictable.”
"You only saw her for a few seconds. That taken, were you?" Harry asked with genuine interest.
annoyed. Harry clenched his fists. "Malfoy."
“How do you feel?” he asked.
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy walked in behind them to stand in the corner as Harry -
“That was practically gibberish!” Harry complained. “How am I supposed to get to a place if I’m not allowed to know where it is? And I thought all Time-Turners were ruined in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.”
After what couldn’t have been more than five minutes of walking, the magical force waned, and Harry stumbled as he quickly regained control of his limbs. He had been turned down an alleyway off the main street, but it bore no resemblance to those in Diagon Ally. This one was brightly lit and full of small shops and pots of flowers that lined the brick storefronts, making the alleyway smell like a garden. Most of the windows were shuttered, probably closed for the evening, but very few of the doors were marked. Except for one:
It was Malfoy’s turn to grin. "
Harry sighed helplessly. What was he supposed to say? “You don’t know him.”
he doing? Harry thought frantically. He was acting deranged, as if the past two years without intimacy had waited until this very moment to finally crack him. “I -” Harry cleared his throat to try to shake the raspiness of it. “I don’t know.”
Harry felt his stomach flip again and couldn’t help smiling against the blond’s mouth.
Around half an hour at the most had passed, and Harry was starting to feel much more optimistic in general. The drink, although not very strong, had a calming effect on him. A small group of people had joined their table and were playing some sort of Muggle card game that Harry had stopped trying to follow or understand.
He let out a sigh, chucked the memo in the bin next to his desk, and yanked his Auror robes from the hook by the door.
“Veritaserum, huh?” Harry asked conversationally as they walked out of the infirmity together that night. He seemed
"Sorry?" Harry asked, hopelessly confused. The haze from the alcohol was not helping, either.
The blond dug his fingers into Harry's waist possessively. "I know. I checked.”
He knew
His meeting. At 9:30.
Harry tore his gaze back up to the blond man in surprise, finding him stood a few feet away with a camera pointed straight at him. "What-"
“True.”
The blond moaned, and then lifted up to break the kiss suddenly. “Harry,” he began.
Harry followed numbly behind as Malfoy led them back to the lifts. When they were once again alone, he shakily let out the breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. The sound of it echoed in the small, quiet space.
time! When else? Come on," Seamus dragged out the last word, grinning. He held out his hand for Harry to shake. "Come on."
The tiny French pub was brimming with raucous noise and good cheer in the wake of the Quidditch World Cup that had finally landed England the winner. Many of the inhabitants of this particular pub (Harry included) had had good Galleons placed on England’s success, completely confident in the team’s newest chaser -- Ginny Weasley.
Malfoy heaved a dramatic sigh and moved into the room, carrying a stark white teacup in one hand. With the other, he made a subtle circling motion using his index finger. The small spoon inside began to swirl the contents as if charmed.
pubescent assistants to sabotage all his hard work. He’d left everything pristine before he’d left for vacation, and all it took was
"Harry Potter!" Seamus announced proudly, thumping said hero on the back hard enough to make him choke on his drink. "Sorry, mate."
When the mirror began to fog, he stepped into the shower and sighed as soon as the hot water poured over his head. He felt his muscles begin to loosen and rolled his shoulders. There were very few events he remembered from last night. He remembered Seamus ordering several rounds of Things-He-Couldn't-Pronounce. He had a vague memory of standing on top of a table. Or was that just Seamus? Neville?
It turned out Malfoy had been planning to come back to London for months. There was a gala to be held at a newly-built mansion just outside of Oxford. Harry stared at his invitation numbly. The event was to celebrate the incorporation of several foreign-based entrepreneurs with England’s own in the hopes that it would encourage growth. Malfoy’s name had been at the top of the list, with several merits being awarded to him for business he conducted in photography, fashion, and potion-making.
The first thing Seamus did after mending his bleeding lip was ask how it went.
Draco shot him a sideways glance that he hoped conveyed ‘in what universe is that not a gross oversimplification of what transpired?’ and was satisfied when Harry blushed crimson again.
Harry looked at the redhead curiously. "I think there've been enough bets tonight.”
Harry's eyes bored into him for a few moments. "Seamus, are you jealous?"
“It’s got to be here somewhere,” he was murmuring quietly.
"Margie!" Seamus shouted back with a lopsided grin.
Malfoy dropped his arms quickly and Harry snapped his eyes back up to the other man’s face, cringing internally when he realized he’d been staring. “Oh,
“I’m sorry.” Harry had turned to face Draco fully with a gloomy expression. “I didn’t mean for it to happen that way. It was . . . intense.”
Confused, Harry grabbed at the hood of the robes he was wearing. Then it clicked, “Ah, that. Wait, how did you know I have it here?”
Potter had one hand on a higher shelf and was looking for a foothold. “Getting my potion,” he said simply.
“What about this lover of yours, Potter?" Malfoy was saying as he continued his grooming. "I know it’s not the she-weasel. She’s become a popular topic in the local magazines as of late, and it’s no small issue how she’s taken up with one of the team’s beaters.”
Draco was saying something in French again, and Harry felt the magic in him burst to life once more. He nearly groaned aloud as it spun him back around and brought him up to the counter, bringing Malfoy into clearer view as he spoke, and Harry ignored the strange feeling that washed over him as he watched the man’s lips move around the foreign words that were going in one ear and out the other. He was clearly fluent, and Harry told himself the only reason he felt like he was practically
“Partner?” Harry sputtered, but the Minister began talking quickly over him.
“Hi,” a voice materialized by his ear and Harry jumped and spun around to find Draco Malfoy standing there, looking devilish in a fine Muggle suit rather than wizarding robes.
That meant the session was over.
Then the hands slid down to his hips and pulled them sharply forward to within inches of his own. Harry gasped and hoped it wasn’t as loud as it was in his own ears. Malfoy said nothing, instead removing his right hand and pressing it into Harry’s shoulder to push it back firmly against the wall. They stood like that for a few moments as the blond seemed to be thinking, his hands still practically scorching Harry’s skin wherever they’d touched.
Harry suddenly recalled his reason for coming here. He knew he was blushing fiercely, and he wished the ground would open up and swallow him so he wouldn’t have to go through with it. However, the floor stayed solidly intact and now the magic was swirling to life again and Harry’s mouth snapped open. In the next instance, he was telling him, “Yes, actually. Are you always this forward with your customers?”
Malfoy shut the door to the studio behind them with a snap, breaking Harry from his thoughts.
"I 'ave been looking for you." She slipped into the only vacant chair at the table and stacked her dainty hands atop one another on the wooden surface. Her sparkling green eyes flitted to Harry. "Ah, so zis must be . . ."
The undignified sound coming from Malfoy was worth it, and Harry couldn't help the peals of laughter that followed.
Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically before he fetched his wand and aimed it Harry. "
"Malfoy." He blurted before he really thought about his question.
Seamus shot him a sideways look. "Such cheek! And her name is Alexis, by the way."
The blond popped back into the entryway, sending Harry an impatient, questioning look.
“Let me give you some good advice for the inexperienced model,” Malfoy said. His voice had gone quieter to suit their proximity. Without warning, Malfoy’s hands found the top button of Harry’s shirt and unfastened it. “Trust me.” He moved on to the next and then the next, not meeting Harry’s eyes, but punctuating them with pieces of ‘advice’ that the magic in Harry’s body interpreted as commands, judging by the way it pulsed each time. “Don’t overthink everything. Remember to breathe. And be
Gryffindor."
"I don't joke." Malfoy said seriously before breaking into a genuine smile that made Harry's stomach flip.
Draco shook his head, trying to clear it and calm his racing heart. There’s been a potions accident. He knew there was nothing like Amortenia in his supplies. Still, Potter’s rambling words meant nothing - it was just a fluke.
Malfoy broke the kiss, but didn’t move away.. In a show of impatience, he retrieved his wand once more and simply Vanished the duvet and then his own trousers. The resulting contact of skin on skin made him gasp. Then Malfoy angled his hips and Harry suddenly knew what he’d been wondering about the entire session as their equally hardened cocks grinded together, sending waves of pleasure through him. Malfoy was rambling something in French again, and he punctuated his words with little bites to Harry’s bottom lip, chasing them with a swipe of his tongue as though to sooth it.
Harry could only nod mutely. He wondered just how much Seamus had shelled out for this elaborate joke. He didn’t imagine it was cheap, with Malfoy running it and all.
“And Revelasensum.”
Malfoy nodded, shrugged, and changed the subject, “So, what’s he like?”
She gave him an amused smile, glancing over towards her friends to confirm that they'd seen her dancing like a loon with Harry Potter. She opened her mouth to say something, but seemed to change her mind on the way. Instead, she said "I'll be right back," and slipped out of his arms.
he couldn’t shake off. He hadn’t met the veela he was swayed by. Surely, he could resist the rumored effortless sexuality of Draco Malfoy. But first, he needed to remember how to breathe. With some effort, he tore his eyes away from him as the noise and light of the corridor spilled in, and Harry realized where they were. “This is my floor. I thought we were going to the Atrium?”
“Well, uh. I mean, I-”
“If I’m being honest,” the blond met his eyes evenly. “I won’t deny his little bet helped fulfill some pretty specific fantasies of mine.”
“It’s the principle of the thing, Harry. You’re not Irish - you wouldn’t understand,” Seamus looked away with a sniff, but Harry could tell he wasn’t serious.
“Where ya goin’?” Ron asked, but his head was back down and his eyes closed.
"Mate, you tried." Seamus grinned and spread his arms wide. "But you were no match for an Irishman on holiday."
"Over here," Malfoy instructed, walking behind a curtain to another set-up of what appeared to be a pristine white bathroom outfitted with a clawfoot tub and a tower of fluffy white towels. With a wave of his wand, the lighting dimmed and several candles strategically placed around the area burst to life, adding a flickering glow.
. Often."
The clicking noises stopped. Malfoy seemed frozen, but was upon him again in the next moment, instructing him into a different pose and then another one – all pretty casual compared to the images hung up in the lobby. The man was all business now, guiding him vocally instead of physically, and Harry allowed himself to be ordered around the room – his body sometimes responding even before he could fully process the words – and just listened to Malfoy's voice being strangely devoid of any of the smugness Harry would have expected from him in this situation. Occasionally, Malfoy would give up on explaining and come closer to physically move him or the props around him as if he were a mannequin in a doll house, which he supposed was an appropriate description.
Malfoy crooked a finger. "Come here."
The brunette woman from before was back, placing a torn sheet of paper on the table in front of him. "Just in case. Thanks for the dance, Mr. Potter." She winked and left the pub with her group of friends giggling madly behind her.
But, as a result, ministry offices were always kept clean and conduct remained steadfastly professional - just in case. Harry had always been impressed at the amount of respect the Minister commanded simply by existing in the vicinity.
“Harry! There you are.” Ron beamed. “Seamus told us you would be around here, saying you’d lost a bet or something.”
The Irishman grinned crookedly, his answering nod sarcastic. "Right, 'course. Sleepin' is surely what those newlyweds are up to. At . . ." He checked his watch-less wrist, "night. On holiday in Paris."
Malfoy did look at him then, blinking slowly. The corner of his mouth quirked up, seemingly against his will, and a flash of white peeked through his lazy, crooked grin. After leveling him with an incredulous stare, Malfoy swiped his tongue across the visible row of teeth and rolled his eyes at Harry, turning back to the doors just as they opened again.
“Call me Harry.”
Turning to face the former Slytherin, Harry drained the rest of his tea, his eyes not leaving Malfoy’s from over the rim of the cup.
Harry kept his face carefully blank. “I didn’t know that. I don’t read the papers. But no, of course it’s not her.”
Draco was smiling victoriously. “Actually, he didn’t tell me that. But you just confirmed it.”
“Whatever helps you sleep at night," Malfoy deadpanned.
Harry levelled the Irishman with a stern look. "You want to shout about my sexuality loud enough for all of Paris to hear, or is just this crowd alright? How soon do you think it'd show up in the Prophet? Besides, you didn't earn the number."
Harry shook the woman’s offered hand with a polite smile. "Pleased to meet you."
the former Slytherin had become. One of the last times he’d seen Malfoy in person was at the trails, where he’d looked malnourished and ill. While still lean and pale, he appeared to be in perfect health now.
With a sudden movement, Draco sat up. He was still straddling, and his hand was still wrapped around Harry’s cock, not minding the precum that glistening on his fingers, but his face was serious. “You -- what?”
Harry tore his eyes away from the scene to meet Seamus' curious leer. "Hermione said something about being tired."
Harry shrugged. “Don’t know. Wish me luck,” he threw over his shoulder as he stepped through the door of their shared office. Ron muttered something under his breath, but Harry didn’t catch it.
gossiping - mostly about some fit bloke or another. More than once, though, they’d gone on about Malfoy and swooned over his so-called “devilish charm.” But Harry liked to think he was a decent Auror -
The blond nodded minutely, taking a sip from the wine glass dangling from his fingers. His eyes met Harry’s curiously and his voice lowered so passersby couldn’t hear, “And your boyfriend appreciated them?”
relaxed or used to it. He sighed, attempting to ignore the sound of the camera’s shutter and instead focus on the tea. It was chamomile, impressively flavorful and without any particles of the flower floating in it. He wondered idly what sort of tea Malfoy liked. He looked up curiously.
"Look at me," Malfoy instructed.
Inside the surprisingly large room, there were several areas set up like scenes that distantly reminded him of old television programmes he had caught peeks of when the Dursley's weren’t watching him. In one area was – of course – a grey chaise lounge surrounded by various props; another one at the back of the room held nothing but a pure white bed. Natural sunlight poured in through enchanted, frosted windows, making the lighting soft and warm.
Thankfully, Harry recognized that for the confession it was. And that was how they were caught snogging in the Ministry twice in one day.
He could feel the invisible lines of raised flesh and, before he could properly decide against it, his tongue darted out to outline what he imagined was the curve of the snake’s body.
In a heartbeat, Potter’s hands gripped Draco’s biceps and rolled them with surprising strength until Draco was fully underneath the Auror, his wrists pinned to either side of his head. “Better than alright,” Potter whispered, grinning like the cat that caught the canary.
What felt like buckets of water sluiced over Harry's head and shoulders, and he sputtered. "What the hell was that for?"
Harry braced himself, but landed on something remarkably soft and bouncy. It was the bed. The towel had miraculously stayed wet and stuck to his skin, so he peeled it off, covering himself quickly with the rumpled duvet instead. He swiveled his head back around to watch Malfoy's approach and batted his eyelashes at him coyly. "Going to join me?"
He followed the motion and saw another unnamed shop with a deep, emerald-green door. There was a pristine-looking bicycle leaning against the wall next to it, along with large planters of daffodils on either side. Just as nondescript as the rest of the businesses down this street; he probably would not have picked it as his first guess.
“Going somewhere?” Ron asked distractedly from his desk, clearly absorbed in his case notes.
Malfoy placed both of their wands on the mantel. He reached into his robes for the Port-Key box and opened it to reveal a single unlit match. His hand shook as he held it out in front of him - it was a nearly imperceptible amount, but Harry noticed.
Harry frowned at their backs and looked down at his drink. It must have been barely a whole ten seconds later that he felt another presence fill Seamus' chair. A floral scent washed over him, and he looked up to see a smiling woman. Her honey brown hair curled around her slender shoulders as she placed one arm on the table and leaned very subtly closer to him.
apparently, drove him insane. What had he gotten himself into? He pinched himself on the arm for good measure and winced.
“Has she?” Harry asked, making a conscious effort to keep his voice light.
Just like all the other times the blond had touched him, Harry's pulse leapt and he attempted to pour all of his attention into
He felt himself slowly relax back into his chair as the situation pieced together in his mind. He gave her a tentative smile. "Well, it can't be that hopeless if you're here."
of surprises today.”
Seamus looked offended. "Drinking isn't a game, Harry," he said seriously.
bet.”
“Nice shot.” Malfoy laughed for the first time, and Harry found it was deliciously charming.
“I’m uncomfortable,” Harry complained irritably.
With a broken sound, Malfoy’s resolve crumbled. He took Harry’s face in both hands and deepened the kiss.
“I assume you received your photos?”
She looked back up at him, then, and he could see she was laughing. She raised a hand to press against her reddened cheeks as if to cool them. "Ohh. I'm no good at this, am I?”
Malfoy seemed to hesitate for a moment before running his hands down the front to smooth the fabric of the shirt down, and Harry couldn’t stop the shudder that tore through him at feeling those hands run over the muscles in his abdomen. Malfoy’s eyes flickered up to his in surprise as if caught, but he blinked and stepped back quickly. “There,” Malfoy said slowly. “Stay like this.” And then Malfoy was moving away to grab his camera.
The woman turned around sharply and pinned him with a curious stare, her sky-blue eyes striking against her tanned face. She waited expectantly, her expression one of impatience.
It blew past the blond’s head, missing by a hair.
"Rise and shine, Harry!"
"Do I have to kiss a barmaid?" Harry laughed.
“Full of yourself, as usual,” Malfoy was saying as he stalked forward. “That much hasn’t changed. To answer your question, Potter, no – I don’t follow your every move.”
In the meantime -
Over the next few days, Harry composed a dozen letters to Malfoy, but they all lay crumpled up in the bin. He had no idea what he would say, or even if Draco would be willing to read them. He went back to work on Monday and tried to drown himself in new projects.
It wasn’t until he was lying across the dreaded chaise that he felt properly vulnerable again. He'd already removed his tie and glasses, and was watching a slightly blurry Malfoy step back to look at his handiwork. What felt like too many seconds slipped by, so Harry finally opened his mouth.
for it.”
"Yeah, alright," Harry smiled, sliding back over to their surprisingly untaken table. "So, are you and Margie....?"
“Harry,” Draco said quietly, stepping up to him.
"Wait," Harry sat up suddenly. "I lost the bet? How?"
“Woah.” Harry reflexively cringed. He took a step back, but nothing more seemed to have happened.
The bathroom door swung open and an angry Harry Potter stormed back into the hotel room, clutching a towel around his waist. Seamus' name died on his tongue, however, as he noticed the room was again empty of obnoxious, sneaky gits.
From what he could see around the camera despite his blurry vision, Malfoy's ever-present smirk grew and he rolled his eyes again. "I think you're taking the flirting advice a bit too seriously. You could do with
The spell was broken.
Harry simply gave him an exasperated sigh and a certain hand gesture before clambering uncoordinatedly out of bed and straight into the adjoining shower room, slamming the door with a bang.
Once he was done, the shirt fell open and Harry felt cool air hit his skin.
. “Potter,” he began in weak protest, but he knew without a doubt that he was already lost. “Stop talking.”
A male voice broke the silence, tossing the lilting, melodious noises of the French language at him from somewhere to his right - a place that must contain the front desk and a place which he’d been pointedly ignoring up until now. The voice sounded bored and almost dismissive, but it inflected like a question. Harry turned his head and dragged his eyes up to the person behind the desk. The man didn’t look up from whatever he was doing as he spoke, but his unmistakable platinum blond hair and barely concealed features were all that were necessary for Harry to be sent into a panic.
As though pondering on a riddle, the white-haired lady frowned and shifted her weight in silence for a few moments. She inspected his robes - the typical black “off-duty” set he wore instead of his Auror ones - and his messy black hair and flushed cheeks. She gave him a smirk - not a smile, but a full-on
Malfoy tutted to himself and retrieved his wand from his pocket - obviously enchanted to prevent it from ruining the lines of his clothing - and pointed it straight at Harry’s trousers, muttering a spell. Shimmering, colourless sparks shot out at him.
potion would be there, though, since he’d just brought it over on his last trip.
Malfoy took it and slipped it into a charmed inner pocket where the shape flattened to nothing.
"Well, yeah, the
Groaning, Harry closed the distance between them and Dracos’ world tilted. Harry Potter kissed like his life depended on it, and Draco gladly responded in kind. His hands found their way into Harry’s hair, eliciting another moan that he was quickly becoming fond of. “Harry,” he murmured, just so he could hear it again.
Malfoy only glared at him, touching his hair to be sure it was dry.
. “Everything about you is intense, Harry. It’s one of the many things I like about you.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said more firmly. “I - What are - What are you doing?”
The sounds of the shutter filled the air - the air which was now distinctly different than it had been a few moments ago. It was thicker and warmer, and Harry fought to regain control of his breathing.
Harry found his attention straying around the pub as the two friends continued their banter. Some of the fans from the Isles had left to seek out other entertainment, so the crowd was getting thinner. His eyes widened as he caught sight of Neville and the barmaid in the far corner, both slightly red-faced as they continued their earlier snogging session.
Instead, a neatly pressed set of clothes lay on the bed with a note on top. Harry glanced around the room once more before plucking up the note.
one!" He was beginning to look like a Cheshire cat as he leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially. "A real
His head was spinning, but he inwardly cheered, redoubling his efforts to remove Malfoy’s shirt. This time, the blond cooperated by removing his hands from Harry and unfastening the buttons expertly, their mouths never disconnecting. It was quite an impressive show of core strength, Harry thought. He delighted in the way Malfoy shivered when he ran his hands up his chest, over his shoulders, and down his back. He began fumbling at the leather belt.
Harry frowned, wiping the water from his eyes and clutching onto the towel. He waited patiently under the pretense of posing. Once Malfoy had ventured close enough, he shook his head, flinging water from his hair in every direction.
From anyone else, the question would have seemed innocent enough. As it was, Harry cut his gaze sharply to Malfoy, who simply stared expressionlessly at the closed doors in front of him. It was unclear whether or not the reference to their second year of Hogwarts was intentional. The tension thickened.
“I guess I’m
Malfoy’s right hand fell to the front of his open shirt and slipped under the material to push it to the side, barely skating over Harry’s bared - and suddenly strangely sensitive - skin, who suppressed a shiver and barely managed to control the urge to arch up into the touch. As the blond arranged the fabric, he glanced up as if to check on him.
Harry blinked in surprise.
The kisses soon became heated and Harry lost himself in the sensations, practically crooning with giddiness at every small noise he managed to pull from the normally reserved and unruffled blond. “Draco,” he muttered, drawing the name out when said man reached down to finally grasp Harry’s length in his hand.
“I always like making you blush,” Potter mused, his bright smile reaching his eyes.
, Potter, that I don’t want to let the past control me.”
“Yes,” Draco was smirking. “Even about your hopeless crush on me.”
“A concealment charm,” Malfoy explained, smirking. “Standard procedure.”
The sound of shelves snapping off the wall was deafening and Draco’s heart plummeted at the sound of glass smashing to the ground. He opened his eyes slowly and looked down. Luckily, he’d been standing clear of any impact.
"Why? Am I making you uncomfortable?" Harry asked innocently, rolling over to lie on his stomach and rest his head on top of his crossed arms. He peeked over the top of his bicep at Malfoy, who seemed to have gone completely silent again in favor of attending to his work.
The doors slid open again and Harry hastily stepped out onto plush purple carpet, making a beeline for the giant mahogany door with ‘Minister for Magic’ emblazoned on a gold plaque on the front. Before he had the chance to knock, the door swung open and two of Shacklebolt’s personal assistants ushered him in without a word.
Harry felt his jaw hang loose. “I’ve never worked a Violet before,” he began anxiously. Class Violet, or so he’d heard, was a rarely-used code name for ‘Top Secret and Incredibly Dangerous.’ The last one, he’d also heard, had resulted in two missing Aurors who were simply never heard from again. Some say they’d died, but others insisted they were under “witness protection” (rather obliviated out of their minds and dropped in another country).
He knew in the back of his mind that he must look ridiculous, but he couldn't dredge up the ability to be bothered by it. He'd known his dignity was a lost cause the moment he'd walked in and saw Malfoy. The man was even more stupidly attractive than he'd been at school or even in the occasional photo that had "crossed Harry's path" over the years. He may have been unpopular around the most prejudiced families back in the day, but there was no doubt that Witch Weekly didn't take that view.
Apparently not. Either Seamus was trying to set him up with Malfoy or this was really just a giant joke. Harry rubbed a hand over his face tiredly. Either way, he supposed it was time to have a long, serious chat with Seamus about staying the hell out of his love life.
On the way down to the Atrium, they weren’t alone on the lift. Harry nodded politely at the two other passengers and glanced at Malfoy, whose attention was entirely focused on the glowing dial of his wristwatch. His lips moved silently as though he were counting. The moment the door slid open, Malfoy took long strides that Harry had to hurry to keep up with. When they reached the nearest available floo, he spun around and spoke in a low, rushed voice. “Your place or mine?”
"My specialty."
Malfoy paused at the door and smirked. “Potter and I have fallen madly in love and have decided to elope.”
"I don't think so." Raising his wand again, Malfoy flicked it once and he was dry again. He waved it once more, and Harry was sent flying backwards through the air.
Seamus crossed his arms, looking put out. "I could have."
“I don’t think it’s worth all this celebratin’” Seamus Finnegan groused loudly, his Irish accent made thicker from the several pints he’d already thrown back. “England would have lost if two of our chasers weren’t too sick to aim straight.”
Harry didn’t know quite what to make of her. “Thank you,” he replied uncertainly before stepping towards the green door and clasping the cold, wet door handle.
After a few seconds of baited silence, Malfoy raised the object in his hand – the smirk gone. “Tea,” he said, pressing the warm cup into Harry’s hand.
"Really?" Harry deadpanned, giving the blond a raised eyebrow.
"'Course not! Why pass up the chance to see France get whipped on their own soil?"
Harry gave him a pointed look.
The doors to the lift had not fully closed before they were thrown open again to admit Draco Malfoy as he stepped in, sheathing his wand in his sleeve.
supportive. He'd found himself introduced to dozens of the Irishman's – coincidentally gay – friends, been set up on two blind dates that failed, and had even been "accidentally" trapped in a Ministry broom closet with a sandy-haired Unspeakable that Seamus had once caught him glancing at in the lifts. That had just been more awkward than anything else. But that had been nearly two months ago now, so Harry'd been sure Seamus was over his strange fixation on playing matchmaker.
Malfoy shifted closer until he had one knee planted on either side of Harry's legs, effectively trapping him in place. He was still working the camera, absorbed in his work.
Harry snapped his attention back to the duo, causing his vision to swim slightly. "What?"
They held onto the opposite ends of the delicate object gingerly. A chiming noise rang out from a large grandfather clock that Harry hadn't noticed before.
"Sorry, Margie, Harry here is as bent as they get." Seamus was saying loudly enough to jar Harry from his musings.
” he heard the older woman call out over her shoulder, laughing, as he headed the other way.
"Well, you're mouthy today. What's a matter, Harry? Had a bit too much to drink last night?"
Malfoy stepped closer, shaking his head. “Ha ha,” he intoned sarcastically, but Harry could clearly see the ghost of a small, crooked smile on his face. In the next moment, he reached out and grabbed Harry's wrist, pushing it up and over his head to press into the soft cushion of the chaise.
that could have been rage, but . . . He gripped the wooden arms of the chair tightly.
Harry felt his face heat up, but he said nothing.
most of the spilled potion and broken glass. He pulled out his wand and began administering basic evaluation charms, which came up with nothing concerning. Potter didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger. Maybe none of the potions had come into contact with skin. He dragged his eyes up and noticed Potter staring at him with a relaxed, reverent expression. “Potter, can you hear me?”
Harry thought sarcastically, feeling decidedly
scary. If you wanted to run away now . . .” he nodded in mock sympathy. “I won’t blame you.”
He allowed himself a moment to try to settle the trepidation he found swirling around the pit of his stomach. There were more reasons behind it than Harry had time to straighten out. He took a deep breath. “It’s just another job,” he whispered, and stepped into the fire.
Harry took a deep breath. “Actually, Draco,”
Hours later, Harry realized he had no idea where this so-called photography studio was located in the first place. He was back in the pub from last night – much quieter during the daylight hours – sitting alone at a table, a plate of barely-finished marinated chicken pushed to the side and an empty wine glass beside it. Although his stomach was in knots, he was considerably calmer now. His eyes were glued to the Muggle watch on his wrist, which read 6:59 PM. What would happen if he missed his appointment? Harry had a surge of hope that Seamus had been bluffing, and that he could simply stay here all night. It sounded much better than the vast chasm of the unknown waiting for him out there.
Harry said nothing, his eyes unable to leave the blond’s nimble hands as they worked on the buttons expertly. He could have easily been asked to do this himself, he dimly realized. Undressing models must be something Malfoy was used to. He stamped down on the sudden cheated feeling that intruded at the thought. This was
if you can manage it. These photos are supposed to be romantic, after all.”
"Seamus!" called a feminine voice over the noise of the pub as the tall brunette who owned it approached their table.
Harry stared at him for a moment, something unnamable blooming in his chest. He glanced around at the –thankfully empty – corridor, pulled the blond inside a nearby loo, and closed the door. "You'd better not be joking," Harry warned.
Harry frowned.
Draco arched an eyebrow. “Away. I know. And maybe you’d find the
Malfoy sidled up behind him. “I-”
"Don't look so worried, Harry! Would I ever make you do something dangerous?”
Springing into action, Harry shoved the blond backwards against the door and kissed him, which Draco seemed more than happy to return. "Just so we’re clear," he said, breaking apart momentarily, "I don't have a boyfriend," Harry felt it necessary to mention.
The moment it began, Harry’s hope plummeted. The strange, tingly burst of magic erupted in his chest before it spread, winding snake-like around his limbs. The muscles in his legs twitched as if in warning; he quickly threw some Galleons onto the table - probably too much - and barely had time to grab his robe before he found himself rising jerkily from his chair, which scraped noisily against the wooden floor as he did so. Blood rushed in his ears and dread pooled in the pit of his stomach, but his legs moved him to the door with no hesitation, reaching it in five long steps. He barrelled right into another Englishman - “Oi! What’s the hurry?” - without stopping, and Harry wasn’t sure his breathless “sorry” was audible.
“That’s . . . a surprisingly clever name.”
"'Fraid I can't do that, Harry. You've got a Wizard's Bet to fulfill."
The blonde paused, looking over his shoulder with a quirked eyebrow. “Oh, I’m sorry. Did you prefer a public show?” Without waiting for an answer from a now-pale Harry, he proceeded to lock the exit with a loud clink that caused Harry’s pulse to spike. “Wait out here. Let me get you something for those nerves,” Malfoy drawled, smirking broadly.
Seamus smirked quite devilishly, and Harry was just a little bit too buzzed to remember why seeing that look on this particular man's face was so unnerving.
“You sound almost as if you’ve been harboring a crush on me or something,” he said, half laughing.
"Here, let me help," Harry suggested, stepping forward with his arms outstretched. He could feel water droplets still cascading down his arms and chest.
And now Potter was leaning down to whisper more of those rambling, lusty confessions in his ear, about how he’d
dares?
"Hey, speakin' o' Weasleys, where've Ron and Hermione gotten off to?"
. It won’t work where we’re going anyway. There is a magical field suppressing everything but - but the most powerful magic and artifacts. And your wand carries your magical signature and can be traced back to you. It’s taking a lot of work just to allow for our portkey entry, and we don’t have all the time in the world.” He raised his eyebrows emphatically. “So hand over your wand.”
Instead of replying, Malfoy led him through the maze of employees (which parted rather hastily this time) and back into Harry’s office. He breezed through the door and looked around, his eyes landing on Ron, who was currently asleep at his desk. Malfoy looked at Harry. “Get your cloak.”
“Not recently,” he muttered noncommittally, giving a one-shouldered shrug. “Mostly just at the Burrow for holidays, but she never had much to say to me after . . . “
Harry green eyes widened. “What-”
Draco smirked, leaning back down to place open-mouthed kisses along his jaw. “Harry,” he practically whispered in his ear. “Harry, Harry,”
“You think I do?” Harry demanded, eyebrows knitted together.
“Now.”
Harry ignored the odd feeling in his stomach at those words. “Er - my flat’s being remodeled, so I’m staying at the Burrow.”
Harry grinned, hooking his thumbs in the waistband of the last thing keeping his modesty. "Don’t you want to help me--”
Barely sparing the legendary item a glance, Malfoy set the heavy glass toy back down with a clunk and crossed the room. “Let’s go.”
, Harry thought supportively, feeling just the tiniest bit mopey at the thought of returning to his empty London flat.
Malfoy lowered his camera and smirked. “Good. In here, Potter.” Malfoy gestured widely to the door labelled ‘Studio 1.’
“Potter,” Malfoy gasped again and wrenched his arm away, staring at Harry as if he’d grown a second head. “What are you doing?”
"You've got to be comfortable with the camera. Just try to relax and get used to it."
Harry looked around, but could not see anything that resembled a photography studio. The magic laid unhelpfully dormant.
The first thing Harry did upon returning to London was visit Seamus’s flat and punch him square in the jaw.
“What?” Harry sputtered incredulously. “No!”
Harry looked around. “Um.”
Draco let the door swing shut. “Your last brain cell? Surely you aren’t still looking for it.”
Harry laughed, bumping against Draco’s chest as he did so. “That’s incredibly fucking sexy,” he admitted without an ounce of embarrassment.
"We have to complete the scene." Malfoy said simply, raising his camera.
Seamus held up his hands. "Nope. Just friends." He grinned, and waggled his eyebrows up and down. "Why? You interested?"
Harry froze, his eyes snapping open to stare blindly at the shower wall.
Malfoy flipped open a thick book of forms and handed Harry a peacock feather quill. He proceeded to rattle off what sounded like typical legal jargon. Harry obediently nodded his head rather numbly and signed here and there. Yes, he understood the company was not responsible for lost or stolen objects. Yes, he acknowledged this agreement and its proceedings were completely confidential in the name of privacy.
Rolling his eyes, Harry took the Irishman's hand and gave it a firm shake. "Fine."
The door groaned ominously and a bell rang out as he wrenched it open more firmly than he’d meant to.
Just then, the door beneath the florist sign opened and a bell tinkled as a short, thin woman with white hair waddled out. She was balancing a large wooden crate on her hip.
“That’s enough, gentlemen,” the Minister told his assistants. “Please wait outside.”
The odd phrase turned itself over in his mind. Harry didn't know whether Malfoy was flirting or simply making fun of him. Charms had not been his best subject, after all. His mind settled on the latter, because he didn't think the words 'Malfoy is flirting with Harry Potter' would ever be in the same sentence or even in the same universe.
"You knew I'd lose," Harry suddenly accused. "You knew you could goad me into agreeing to your stupid drinking game and lose!"
“Alright,” Malfoy conceded, raising his hands defensively. “Then who?”
"Would you have fought them if there were?" Harry wanted to know.
“One,” Malfoy answered, expressionless.
As he processed the last three words, smoke began to rise from the edges of the parchment and the corners curled in. It erupted into flames, and Harry gasped, releasing it. It fully disintegrated before the last ash hit the floor.
got a cellphone, so I'll just-"
Clearly hoping for a better reaction, Malfoy raised an eyebrow at Harry.
Despite his reservations, Harry found himself at the mansion at four in the afternoon on a saturday. True to his expectations, he’d been accosted by admirers as soon as he’d entered the ballroom just after the award announcements. His hand felt clammy from the amount of hands he’d shaken while being introduced to several hopeful start-ups. He’d barely had time to scan the crowd for blond heads, but he noticed the place was decorated immaculately. Several tables were set up with dishes originating from various countries and the drink fountain was shaped like a rotating globe.
The blond became utterly still. Slowly, he raised his head and met Harry’s wide-eyed gaze. “Potter,” he said in the familiar drawl Harry was used to. “What are you doing here?” In the next instant, his expression became stony. “Wait. I should have known you’d be here for the Cup. Someone must have told you I was here and now you’ve come to make a mockery of me. Go on, then, Potter, tell me how much-”
Draco was at his side in an instant, waving a hand to
Harry, a wicked smile on his face, raised his knees so that Draco would pitch forward.
Harry blinked. “What?”
At that, Ron tore his gaze up from the parchment. His eyebrows shot up. “Mate, what did you
“I can’t,” Potter whispered. His hands moved to Draco’s face, one burying itself in his hair and the other running along his jawline. He was so close that Draco imagined he could feel sparks traveling the short distance between their lips as he said “Call me Harry.”
Harry felt his face warm, but he couldn’t banish his grin.
Draco sent a furtive glance around them before setting his drink on a passing tray, grabbing Harry’s wrist, and leading them across the room and down a narrow corridor The music in the ballroom had started to grow louder, and it was a steady thumping by the time they were sufficiently alone.
Harry found himself grinning wider, adjusting the towel to drag it down an inch more. “Are you offering?”
The blond blinked slowly in confusion as he lifted himself up on his elbows. “I didn’t mean to.”
