Harry smiled slowly, watching. This was, he realized, a very solid little unit and Harry wasn't sure what Draco would do if they couldn't find a cure... It just firmed his resolve. They had to find a cure.
"Cheat?" he said hopefully. "Couple of cleaning charms and we'll give him a real bath in the morning."
Draco nodded his head, sinking back against the back of the couch and rubbing at his eyes with the back of his hand. "Okay. Can you remember a few things for if I'm not up in the morning?" He gave a small chuckle, the sound not so much humorous as it was emotionally drained. "I think the Gryffindor Golden Boy can remember what a five year old boy needs in the morning." Even if he is on his d-death bed...
The little blonde boy stood innocently at the entrance to the kitchen, silvery eyes wide with wonderment and confusion as he took in his daddy's current state. "Or should I call him papa?" Draco wanted to smack himself in the forehead.
Hermione looked over her shoulder, nibbling on her bottom lip. "He named his stuffed unicorn?" Harry nodded and she sighed heavily, nodding. "Alright, Harry, you win. Let me finish up here and then we'll head there straightaway."
On a moan, Harry managed to press closer as his tongue stole inside, sliding over Draco's with abandon. He had the ridiculous thought of tasting hot and tawdry sunshine before all thoughts skittered away.
Harry sighed quietly. He'd seen how rail thin he'd looked in the tub, but now, with Hermione's time limit in mind, it gave him a pang. He shouldn't be so thin and small... He just shouldn't. He walked in after Draco, settling beside him. He laid a hand on the blonde man's shoulder, squeezing gently. "Who taught you how to get dressed, Scorp?" he teased.
Draco leaned his head in to the touch before he blinked, his eyes meeting those of shocking emerald green. He gasped after a moment, his hand shaking lightly against Harry's hip. "M-My wand?"
The blonde nodded, standing and quickly shuffling Scorpius off his leg who ran towards the bathroom with renewed abandon. "Thanks... Harry." Draco smiled slightly, patting him on the shoulder before walking down the hallway, stripping his shirt of in the process. Inwardly though, Draco gave a small start, a slight tingle working its way up his fingers and through his arm. What the...?
"Thought he was a rather irritating prat, all pale and pointy and bossy." Harry bit into his neck, sucking at the raised skin. "And bloody snarky. I used to want to bite his mouth to shut him up."
Draco gave a small sigh, welcoming the touch as he leaned into it. "Just some ruffian wizard who still had his head back in the war-days. Death Eater scum and all that." He didn't bother mentioning to Harry that the Dark Mark on his arm drove him crazy. He wrapped an arm around Harry's waist so he didn't push the sleeve of his shirt up and itch at the annoying ink.
Harry nodded, gestured with one hand and wondered what he was doing. He bit back the sigh because, well, he did know what he was doing. He'd seen a too-small, too-fragile little boy that looked underfed and unloved and... What Ron labeled as his "saving people thing" had kicked in. And now it was just plain curiosity because he'd taken one look at his former rival and hadn't seen anything to rage against or suspect. He looked a little tired, really, and that alone would've knocked away any urge to fight. "Do you live around here?" he asked, tone casual.
Draco's hand shook almost violently has he reached out, cautiously pausing as his eyes assessed Harry's face, as if he believed the man would offer up the wand just to take it back with a small laugh and an "A-ha, you're not getting it back!"
"I know; I'm still sorry. He's a great kid, y'know. You've managed to do one hell of a job raising him."
The elder blonde blushed, ducking his head as he pulled Scorpius against his leg, gently running his fingers through soft locks that only a child could have. "T-Thank you, Gran... Hermione. I tried." Scorpius smiled, tilting his head up to gaze at his daddy far up above him.
Scorpius smiled quietly. "I know. I had to be brave for daddy. Daddy always told me about how he had to be brave when he was my age and-and-and-" He stood on Draco's lap, wrapping his arms around his father's neck and hugging him tightly. "And I wanna be just like you when I'm older, daddy. I wanna be brave and smart!"
Draco rolled his eyes, sending a small glare over his shoulder that just screamed a sarcastic "Thanks, see if I let you continue to snog me against my kitchen counter." Draco approached the little boy wearily, kneeling down in front of him and running a hand through his own blonde locks.
The blonde gave a small, grateful smile, gathering the tired-eyed boy in to his arms and holding a small cup up to him. "You know the drill, Scorp." He walked further in to the room, sitting on the edge of the bright blue comforter, cradling his son against his chest.
"Oh really, Scorpius?" Draco spoke up from behind the brunette, brushing past him with the simplest of touches.
Scorpius giggled, hands clamping on to Harry's face as he squealed before wrapping around his neck and burrowing against his shoulder. "Ha-arry!" He wiggled his feet. "Food! Can I have pancakes?"
Draco's face flashed with a moment of pain before he dropped Harry's hand and walked in to the room, kneeling down next to the little blonde boy who was attempting to pull on a new shirt but alas, the sleeves and the hole for his bright blonde head had gotten tangled and Scorpius was... well... stuck. Scorpius was bone thin, his ribs poking out from underneath pale, almost translucent flesh. His hip bones were pointy from beneath the edge of his pants and his arms were thin and had almost no muscle tone that a five year old boy, as active as the one before the elder Malfoy, should have.
"Irritating git." But he was smiling as he drew the other man closer. He rested his brow on Draco's, the smile fading into a sincere expression. "I'm getting your wand back today."
Harry laughed, wrapping his arms around Draco, trapping Scorpius between them. They were a beautiful pair that just couldn't be separated. He wouldn't let it happen.
Draco rubbed at the back of his neck, making sure Scorpius was absorbed in his surroundings before allowing his expression to drop slightly. Weariness, exhaustion, an aching sadness - they were all reflected in swimming pools of silver. "We've been to every Healer that will take us, I've read countless books, visited libraries all across the world. There is absolutely nothing."
Scorpius giggled, bobbing his little head before wrapping his lithe, frail arms around Harry's neck. "Okay! Snitchy! Snitchy!"
When he was out of sight, and with the smile still curving his lips, Harry slid a hand into Draco's hair and pressed him close again for a light, brief kiss. "I have things I need to get done, actually, if you want to take Scorpius to the park. I can be back later." He brushed his thumb over the blonde's bottom lip. "If you want me, anyway."
Draco nodded, pressing a lingering kiss to Scorpius's head and closing his eyes, breathing deeply. "I love you, Scorpius. So much." The whisper was soft, almost unheard by the occupant across the room.
He gave a small smile, a small flash of white as his teeth showed. "I know, I went to school with you lot, remember? Hermione Granger." He waved a hand dramatically before it found its way back in to his hair. "The brightest witch of our age."
Draco gave a small sniff, moving to sit up, one of his arms still locked around Harry's waist. "I would of had to find out sooner or later."
"It's Potters you should watch out for," Harry replied, hands sliding down Draco's back to cup his arse. He give it a firm squeeze, biting his lip. "We move quickly when we want something."
Working on instinct, Harry sighed and wrapped his arms around the man. "We're going to do everything we can, Draco. We're not going to let him go. He's your baby. We'll take care of it."
"Wash my hands before making him pancakes, give him a glass of milk with it, give him his vitamins, and have him up by nine. There are more things to remember in the middle of an arrest," Harry assured him. "I can handle it."
Draco let out a strangled moan, rutting up against Harry's hips and pulling him down to devour his lips in a kiss. "I take back - what I said." He nipped harshly at the others lips, hands tugging through straggled strands of brown hair. "You're going to be the death of me, Potter."
She sighed. "Harry, you say no other healers will see them and I haven't heard of this phenomena when I do my necessary rounds at St. Mungo's. This sort of thing is medical gold. You're either being lied to or they were on the wrong side of the war."
"Hang on, hang on." Harry went over to the counter to pick up his wand. "Accio Perry," he summoned and the little unicorn zipped into the room. He held him out to Scorpius, smiling. "There we go."
Draco gave a small chuckle. "Of course, Scorp. Apples." He stood up fully, intent on leaving the park and not looking back for fear of hexing the boys who pushed Scorpius down before he paused. Potter. Shite.
Considering which side of the war the Malfoy family had been on, Harry rather doubted that they'd been to too many healers. "If they don't know what it is, do they at least know a little of what's going on? He's... He looks way too small."
Harry set him down, lifting his wand and tapping it lightly on Draco's lip. "Episkey," he murmured, and let the spell do its work.
Scorpius hiccuped, his eyes watering as he clung to his father. "I still love you daddy! W-Wif or wif out magic! Don't hate me because I'm sick, please! I-I didn't mean to make you los-lose your magic!" The little blonde was stuttering, his words jumbled and lisped as he sobbed quietly against his fathers chest.
The bathroom door was swung open, Draco leaning a hip against the counter as he poked and prodded at his own lip that was split open, blood dripping down his chin and into the sink. "Scorpius doesn't do well with blood when it's coming from other people. His own blood seems to fascinate him." The blonde rose an eyebrow, looking at his face from side to side in the mirror as he wiped away some of the blood with a hiss and a small grimace of pain.
"Good morning, Po- Harry." He nodded once more before looking down at Scorpius and smiling, the little boy breathing heavier than he was when he walked in, his cheeks red with laughter.
"Hermione," he returned. And ignored her sigh, plowing on. "He's five, almost six," he began, knowing that would get her. He was the same age as Hugo.
He grinned, giving a wink of his eye that was suspiciously missing one eyebrow, as he turned back towards his office. "For you, 'Arry? Anythin'."
"Oh, there we go. I was wondering when I'd see the Draco Malfoy I remembered." He turned his head, nipping at the blonde's neck. "He's sexier than I recall."
"He seems to be a very lovely unicorn," Harry praised, laughing softly. "Come on, kiddo. Let's go meet Hermione. I'm sure she'd like to meet Perry there, too."
Harry looked up as footsteps neared and felt something in his world shift. Draco bloody Malfoy. He looked down at the boy still in his lap and the frown tugged at his lips. He should've realized... It was almost like looking at a clone. A rather small, too-light one, but a clone nonetheless. Godric, was Draco even feeding the boy?
"Thought it was too early," Harry reminded him, holding him tightly. "But Teddy was still taking naps at Scorpius's age. Think we can manage that?"
Harry reached out, touching the scars before he realized he'd lifted his hand. But he didn't drop it when he noticed, only lifting his gaze to meet the blonde's, a mute apology in his eyes.
"Her-my-ninny!" Scorpius screamed, wiggling violently to get out of Draco and Harry's grasps before taking off down the hallway, almost running face first in to the wall outside of his bedroom, his socked feet almost not able to turn fast enough.
Draco smiled gently, running his fingers through Scorpius' slightly wet hair, "Okay, Scor, daddy will sleep." He gave Harry a grateful look. "As long as you be nice for Mr. Potter, okay?"
Hermione sank onto the couch, smiling. "I'm very grateful to Scorpius, really. And I'm sorry for just dropping in like this. Hello, Harry."
"Why would they think it was a good idea to take your magic?" Harry asked quietly, trying to hide the venom in his tone. Draco had been raised pure-blood, for Merlin's sake. He didn't have the experience in raising a child without magic, so forcing such a thing on him was irresponsible and potentially even dangerous.
Harry lifted a hand to the one at his face, held it there. "I know I love your son. And I know I've never felt this much or exactly this way with anyone else, never wanted to do more for someone. Ron says I have a saving people complex." He smiled slightly. "But this goes beyond that. I need to help, just to make you happy. If I don't love you, I'm falling fast."
Scorpius continued. "So that means you can be my new papa, right? You make daddy happy, and daddy makes you smile! So you're my new papa." His grin was wide and toothy, his expression one of wonderment at - what he thought was - his wonderful, logical reasoning.
The little boy rolled over with a small yawn, rubbing at his eyes with a small hand. "P-Papa?" His hair was a mess, sticking up at odd angles and falling into his eyes as he clutched Perry to his chest with a small yawn.
Scorpius looked up at Harry worriedly, his big silver eyes wide as his lower lip quivered. "H-Harry- what's wrong?" He clutched Perry even tighter, glancing back at Her-mi-ninny with a scared expression. "Am I sick again?"
"So... so there's... nothing?" Hermione's silence was enough of an answer for Harry, who buried his face in his hands.
"W-What will I do, Potter? What will I do once Scorpius is gone?" His arms slowly wound around his stomach, hunching over as if to be sick, tears dripping down his neck. "What will I tell him? C-Can I even tell him? Oh not my baby boy... H-he's the only thing I have left..."
He moaned as his tongue met Harry's, his thoughts racing with the knowledge that he was finally kissing the man that saved his son- saved him. His hands drifted down, his fingers dancing beneath the hem of Harry's shirt to run across the warm skin beneath.
A blush spread slowly across Draco's cheeks. He coughed awkwardly into his palm as he stood, grabbing Harry's shirt off the counter and flinging it to him, avoiding his gaze and keeping his hands at his side. "W-Well... yes. Okay. Very good, Potter. I-" His shoulders slumped, his heart hammering wildly in his chest as he drop the facade and marched up to Potter- to Harry and kissed him firmly on the lips. "Just hurry back and be careful, you stupid Gryffindor. You have a little boy who would be crushed to see his new hopeful candidate for the position of 'daddy' not come back in one piece."
Draco pulled Harry's bottom lip between his teeth, hands wandering and caressing the supple skin beneath his shirt. His heart thundered in his chest, his thoughts running rampant in his brain. After all the years of wondering, the passing thoughts and the long glances, this is what it was finally like to kiss Harry bloody Potter. A soft moan escaped his lips. Merlin he could get used to it.
Smiling, Harry shook his head. "It's me, Scorpius. Your daddy let me sleepover, and I made you some breakfast."
The two Gryffindors exchanged looks, communicating in a way that betrayed just how close they were. Hermione nodded. "I'll have Ron mention something to Percy tomorrow. We'll try and get that reversed. It's possible that being so close to bound magic is negatively affecting Scorpius's condition." Whatever that may be. She looked at her notes, frowning. The only thing she could see for absolute certainty at this moment was that his body seemed to be collapsing in on himself. At the current rate, she estimated a year, but less time wasn't impossible.
Draco's entire body froze, his breathing practically still as a pregnant pause hung in the air. He stood up, albeit on violently shaky legs, but he steeled himself, swallowing loudly. "M-May I have a moment?" He turned without an answer, walking down the hallway that led to Scorpius's bedroom.
When he was older... Harry looked at Draco, swallowing hard. "Hermione really does need to see him," he said quietly. "Another scan like yesterday."
Draco gave a small, meager shrug, a little smile coming to his face and brightening his eyes as Scorpius climbed down from Harry's lap and plopped in to Draco's, cuddling up to him. "Oof!"
Draco's eyes clenched shut, a swell of emotion twisting in his chest. "Y-Yes..." His fists clenched together, pressing against his legs. "My son is dying, and there is nothing I can do," he muttered as a small plate of apple slices was placed in front of the little blonde boy by a charming waitress. Draco gave a curt smile, the lines of his mouth strained. "Eat slowly, Scorpius. We don't need you upsetting your stomach."
Grabbing Harry's glasses from his face, he dropped them to the kitchen table behind them, leaning forward and smashing their lips together, tongue delving in immediately as he felt his orgasm curling in his stomach. "H-Harry-!" he moaned gutturally, hand moving faster and his grip tightening as his thumb swiped over the head of Harry's cock, his hips jerking forward.
He ruffled the boy's hair before going to the fridge to locate milk. "You're welcome. Did Perry enjoy the ride?"
"I like that you felt the need to check the time." Harry followed, wrapping his arms around Draco from behind. "Going to use your wand like a giddy seventeen year old that just got the Trace taken off?"
Harry hooked his leg around Draco's and curled his fingers into his shirt, pinning him on his back on the bed in one quick flip. He pressed their hips together, his own grinding down, and his teeth went at Draco's neck in quick little nips. "I think I just might be able to."
"HARRY! HARRY!" A voice screamed loudly, feet pounding in to the living room. Scorpius slipped on the carpet, his hands catching him before his was up and running towards the brunette screaming bloody murder in the form of the Boy-Who-Lived's name. "Daddy is b-b-bleeding!"
The blonde let out a small gasp, pressing firmly back against the Gryffindor and lifting his arms to lock around Harry's neck, heart pounding almost violently in his chest as he kissed back, moving their lips together.
"I'll bring you what you need tomorrow afternoon. I'm being sent on maternity leave soon, so I'll be able to focus on him more." She ruffled the boy's hair, smiling. "Draco... You really have done an amazing job with him."
Draco managed to collect himself enough so that could grab Harry's face and devour his mouth with a soft moan.
Draco knocked on Scorpius's door softly, smiling, almost grimacing, at the sight of his son playing in his bright blue room. Draco made sure it was the best when he was born. Bright blue walls splattered with white fluffy clouds and little snitches dashing in and out on the ceiling, the walls. Scorpius adored them when he was a little, as Draco charmed them to move. But, after he lost his magic, Draco made sure to entertain Scorpius with toys. Snitch plushes, broomstick toys, unicorn plushies and toy wands. Anything the child could want, anything that Draco could afford, he got. As Draco and Astoria went through their divorce, Draco mostly kept Scorpius to himself so the little child really had no need for any of the toys as much when his dad played with him 24/7, and now that Draco found out there was little to no hope for his son, that's what he would do.
"Draco..." Harry sighed, tucking his hands in his pockets. "I know this is probably a ridiculous question, so don't take it the wrong way. But do you want me to stay here tonight? I can take care of Scorpius in the morning for you. You can't tell me you're not exhausted."
"M-My s-son has o-one year left?" Draco stood at the entrance to the hallway, his expression one of the utmost heartbreak, his arms around his stomach as if he were going to be sick. His grey eyes were swimming with tears. His face already looking hagged and exhausted but now coupled with the tears, Draco Malfoy looked as if his world was ending, falling down around him.
Hermione shook her head. "What they did with Draco was binding his magic to his wand. If he didn't have his wand, he didn't have magic. A wand will not choose Scorpius until he's older, so there's no way to do that. And removing his magic entirely... That may have worked before he started showing the symptoms, but at this point the strain on his body would kill him immediately."
Draco's breath hitched before he pulled the lobe of Potter's ear between his teeth, grinding his hips against the shorter male's and leaning down to nip and suck at his neck, leaving a few deep red marks in his delicious sun-kissed skin.
He tilted his head slightly, trailed the tip of his tongue teasingly over Draco's lips and shivered. "I did tell you to call me Harry, didn't I?"
"You're excellent at trying, then." She smiled, taking up a bit of floo powder. "And don't break Harry, alright? I'm rather fond of him." And with a laugh, she was gone.
"M-My wand?" Draco swallowed, hands suddenly clammy. He could handle Potter falling in to his life, dragging Gran-Weasley (that would take some getting used to, he told himself) in as well but asking about his wand was something personal. "I don't have it." His voice was calm, clipped, his expression instantly falling back into the Malfoy sneer he harboured years ago.
Scorpius grumbled, copying his father's expression and crossing his arms over his little chest as he was held up in the air. "It was being mean to Mrs. Her-my-ninny. And you always told me to be nice to lady-people so I was teaching him to be nice to Mrs. Her-my-ninny."
Draco chuckled, hair disheveled and falling in to his eyes, a plain grey shirt gripped in his fingers as he walked in to the bathroom and sat on the toilet, coming a hand through Scorpius's hair. He yawned, giving a quick nod before pulling the shirt over his head. "Yeah..." he muttered hesitantly. "Thanks, Potter."
Walking past the slides, teeter-totter, and even the sand pit (his little five year old hated the damn thing), Draco still had not found his own little shock of blonde hair. His heart was quickly exploding in his chest, his grip tightening against the weathered brown strap of his messenger bag. A bright flash of blonde had Draco jerking his head around, a small hiss escaping his lips at the flash of pain.
Draco gasped, a soft string of moans leaving his lips as he ground his hips against the others, hands and lips greedily tracing every inch of skin he could reach as Harry did whatever the fuck it was he was doing, but Merlin it felt wonderful.
"He will," Harry promised. "He'll be fantastic. The professors are bound to adore him - who wouldn't? And everything'll be just fine. He will go to Hogwarts. He has a future."
Harry didn't have breaks often, didn't like to take them. Most liked to say that he enjoyed his job a little too much, but that wasn't a very big concern for the man. He'd learned years ago not to heed the words of others. They were often biased, entirely incorrect, or just skewed enough to cause confusion. Yes, he enjoyed his job. Was it too much? That was a matter of opinion, which was as unreliable as Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill had been when he'd been a confused, angry boy in a tournament.
Draco was awoken quickly by a house-elf shaking his shoulder chanting "Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy!" And before he could bring himself to answer, he heard it - a horrible retching noise echoed across the wing of the Manor he was in, shocking Draco up from his bed and looking over to the other side. Astoria lay asleep, calm and pristine as she normally was when awake. Draco shot out of bed, rushing to the door of his bedroom and flinging it open, not caring about the loud bang! it created as he ran down the hallway. He followed the only light in the hallway, a doorway right at the end, shining bright.
"Still, though." Harry rose, ran a hand through his hair and then gestured to the papers on the coffee table. "Here. Sign those and I'll pick them up in the morning. You should get some sleep."
"No, actually. Hermione came to my house one day and completely chewed me out for the mess. She's bloody terrifying when she rants, I swear. I'm now a clean and orderly citizen."
Harry laughed. "Shouldn't you be using a fork, Scorpius?" He took the boy's hands in his own, let the cleaning spell wash over him.
"It's truly fine, Hermione. My home is now yours for as long as you are helping Scorpius." He met Harry's eyes, holding the gaze as he sat on a small loveseat with Scorpius playing silently at his feet. "And after."
That had been one week before he'd found Scorpius coughing up blood all over his bed. That was a day Draco would never forget...
The blonde gave a small nod, laughing warmly as Scorpius climbed over his chest and plopped to the floor. "Can I help?" He smiled widely, clapping his hands as Draco pulled himself out of the bed, his chest oddly bare. He fell asleep with a shirt on last night but waking up a few hours later had quickly divulged him of that piece of fabric.
The elder Malfoy chuckled, placing the pancake on a plate he grabbed from overhead and allowing Scorpius to drop it on the griddle. "Okay Scorpius, down we go." He grabbed the boy under his arms and placed him on the floor gently, ruffling his hair. "Thank you very much, Scorp."
Sighing, Harry stepped forward and gathered him up. He couldn't very well leave him on the couch all night and have to tiptoe around him when morning came. He carefully lifted Draco, pausing when the man murmured something unintelligible and turned his face into Harry's shirt. The brunette smiled slightly, starting down the hall.
That had been one week before he'd found Scorpius coughing up blood all over his bed. That was a day Draco would never forget...
Draco leaned forward, pressing their lips together, his tongue coming to swipe out against Harry's battered and bruised lips. "Sorry about that. Guess we'll just have to stop if I taste so disgusting then, won't we?"
Draco's face instantly lost any color, his lower lip being sucked in to his mouth and gnawed on by nervous teeth. "Okay, well..." he gripped his hands in his lap, his mask dropping to cool indifference, but anyone could see he was dreadfully worried about the fate of his only son who sat only a few feet away by his feet. "Do you have any guesses as to what may be wrong with him?"
He turned giving a small smile to Scorpius and holding his arms open, the child instantly running in to them with a small, gratified squeak, his little feet carrying him into his daddy's open arms. "D-Daddy! Are you okay? Did the bad man hurt you?"
"N-No he's not! L-Look!" Scorpius pointed a shaky finger at Draco's face, his father looking down at him with a raised eyebrow. "B-B-Blood!" The little child squeaked as if he were about to kneel over.
Harry smiled at the boy as well. "There's still some batter left if you want anything. And I made tea." He gestured with his own cup and chose to ignore the fact that he had things to do today, content to just sit and watch the pair of blondes.
"I know there is, but no one else has been able to find it and no one else will look. No other healers will see them. Come on, Hermione. He's a single father who very obviously loves his son."
Draco tugged at Harry's hair, titling his head at an awkward angle and smashing their lips together, devouring Harry in a kiss as he rutted against the brunette's hand, moaning at the heat of his calloused fist against his cock.
"I love you too, daddy." After a few minutes, Scorpius climbed down from Draco's lap and wobbled out of the room after giving Harry's leg a hug, almost not coming up to Harry's knee.
There was a moments hesitation before Draco leaned forward and sealed there lips together in a kiss that made fire boil through his veins, warming him from head to toe. The kiss left something of a promise on Draco's heart as his lips moved against the brunette's.
Oh, Godric, how was he supposed to explain this and not crush the boy? "It takes... time," he finally decided. "Making each other happy is only part of it. But there are lots of things to do before I would be able to be your papa and those things take a lot of time. Don't they, Draco?"
"Oh, Draco. Once a prat, always a prat." He grinned, fingers curling into the blonde's shirt. "Maybe some of my own sparkling personality will rub off on you. If you're lucky, of course."
He glanced at his feet, shaking his head. "You're right... you're right. What was I thinking?" The last bit was mumbled more to himself than anyone as he leaned down and combed a hand through Scorpius's disheveled locks. "Scorp, can you go play in your room?"
"Because I'd like Harry to be my daddy," the child barreled on, eyes wide and innocent as he gazed at his father, Perry clutched tightly between his thin fingers.
"He can't be a squib and have magic," Harry muttered, in agreement with Malfoy. That was a lazy answer. He looked at the child, pictured Teddy at his age and it just didn't take. Harry simply couldn't get over how small he was, how thin. "It's killing him, isn't it?"
He tilted his head, a small meek smile pushing at his lips. "If I'm lucky?" He pulled the Gryffindor flush against him. "I think I'm lucky enough, thank you."
He summoned the utensil, handed it over. "After you eat, we'll wake your daddy up, alright? I have a few things to do today."
"Anytime he wants a ride, he can have one." Harry smiled, pouring a very small glass of milk for the child. He brought it over, along with the vitamins. "Now you take these while I finish up the pancakes."
He let out a long sigh, his head dropping down against Harry's shoulder- personal space be damned. He was a man in need. "Y-Yeah... I tried my hardest, but having no magic certainly made it an unpleasant experience at times."
She ran a hand through her hair, looking down at her notes even though she didn't need to. She'd spent the entire day pouring over these files, searching for anything that might help. "His magic is like a virus. His body's decided to treat it as a threat, so his immune system has gone on the attack. But it isn't destroying the magic. It's... It's destroying Scorpius. His own immune system is wearing him down."
Harry let out a breathless laugh, teeth latching onto Draco's neck. His hands slid down and beneath the blonde's shirt, moving quickly over the heated skin.
Coughing to clear his throat, Draco nodded. "Yes Scorpius, H-Harry's right." He reached over, rubbing a hand over his son's back soothingly. "But you are right, Harry does make me happy. So maybe he'll be your papa soon." The blush that was evident on Draco's cheeks told that he wouldn't mind the fact of Harry being a father to Scorpius.
Having been gone the better half of an hour, Harry came back to the sight of Draco curled up at the edge of the couch, his arms cushioning his head as he slept deeply. His hair fell in to his eyes, his lips slightly parted as his chest rose and fell with gently breaths. The parchments and quill lay forgotten on the coffee table.
Draco nodded, wiggling his fingers against Scorpius's stomach to get the boy laughing again after a few moments of tense silence. "Yes, of course. Tell her I'll leave the floo open."
Harry's heart fluttered in his chest as he wondered if Draco was going to remain very delightfully shirtless. Abruptly, he turned to go, the tea only remaining in the cup because of a non-spilling spell he was in the habit of employing anytime he had something to drink. "Right, then."
Draco took a few moments to collect himself, taking a few deep breaths as he gently ran his fingers over the wood, breath catching slightly as he ran it over the small, marginal chip right at the bottom of the handle that he made in sixth year. "I... I really do owe you, Potter. Thank you."
Harry laughed, keeping a hold of the child as he wriggled and squealed. He turned a wide smile on Draco and found himself not minding the idea of becoming Scorpius's papa in the slightest.
And Draco hadn't even had his wand. It could've been so much worse. Harry wrapped his arms carefully around the other man. "And you told me to be careful?"
Harry let go of Draco's waist only long enough to drag his own shirt off. Pressing against Draco with that barrier removed had a moan escaping because, fuck, he had nice skin. Smooth and soft and warm. Harry dropped his mouth to Draco's and bit, sucking at the raised skin to mark him.
So Harry walked in and lifted Scorpius, pulling Draco to his feet at the same time. "Come on," he whispered. "Scorpius, Hermione needs to see you for just one second. Okay? I'll take care of Draco."
"Ok, let's go Scorp!" He picked Scorpius up, hands under his arms as he spun the boy around, blowing a raspberry against his stomach and laughing warmly at the boy's excitable giggles.
Draco rolled his eyes, leaning over and pressing his lips to Harry's softly, shuddering at the tingling that found its way up his fingers and down to his toes. "I wouldn't have it any other way." Scorpius's loud cheers rang through the house.
Harry couldn't see a thing beyond Draco's face and was completely and wholeheartedly alright with that. He dragged his teeth over the man's bottom lip. "Close," he gasped. "Merlin, Draco."
"Not on your life, Malfoy. I plan on doing a lot more tasting soon. And a lot more other stuff as well." Harry leaned back against table leg, trailing his fingers over Draco's chest. The shirt was very easily vanished so he could roam over bared flesh, and he wondered why he hadn't thought of that sooner. "You really are gorgeous."
There was a dull thud from within the apartment and a squeal of laughter as a dorm slammed open and there was a padding of feed against the wooden floor.
"You know what the papers are for, right? She wants to take over Scorpius's case entirely, so she needs access to his medical history. And once she gets her teeth into something, she doesn't let go. If anyone can cure him, it'll be her."
Draco instantly leaned in to Harry's arm, his tears dripping against Harry's shirt as his arms wrapped around the Quidditch-toned waist. "P-Please Potter- Harry- please."
With a laugh, Harry gave a nod and swept out. He headed down the hall to his own office, where he could leave by floo. Hopefully, Draco had kept his open. He took a pinch of powder from the little canister on his mantle and tossed it in. "Malfoy Flat," he said clearly and stepped through, coming out with a small stumble into Draco's living room. One of these days, he'd be able to floo perfectly.
"No! You listen here, Potter. It specifically states that you need to have a family relationship to the wand owner to be able to obtain the bloody damn thing!" His finger jammed down on to the piece of paper, signaling a rule written in the massive jumble of text that was supposed to justify his words. "And last time I checked you have no relation to Malfoy!"
The little boy nodded with a wide smile, oblivious to the tense atmosphere of discussing his own death date. "Okay, daddy!" He meandered away after picking Perry up and zooming out of the room.
"I..." Harry swallowed thickly, heart thudding almost painfully against his ribs. "I don't want you to want me out of gratitude. I want you to just... want me," he whispered.
Draco shook his head and laughed warmly as he dropped Harry's hand and rushed in to the room, picking Scorpius up from behind and spinning him around. "And what is the heir of the Malfoy name doing playing with a unicorn?" Draco dropped the expression, adopting one of cool indifference.
"At least..." Harry moaned, hips bucking up into Draco's. "At least we can certainly handle each other."
But then his gaze was caught by a beautiful little blonde boy. He seemed incredibly small, even from his distance, and a bright blue scarf was wrapped around his neck even though it was the middle of August and almost unbearably hot. As Harry watched him glide back and forth on a swing set he began to take in the boy's surroundings and started to walk forward, a frown replacing the smile. He could see it in his mind's eye and wanted to be there in time to stop- damn.
The auror rocked gently, stroking the blonde's back in careful, soothing motions. Otherwise, he let the sobs fill the silence, let Draco cry and cry and didn't stop his easy motions even as the sobs began to subside to sniffles.
Harry set Scorpius down. "You go on to your room, alright? I'll send Perry out when everything's okay again."
Okay, Harry couldn't just let Draco take that on his own. With one little statement, the boy had completely snatched Harry's heart away and was holding it as tightly as he was his unicorn. Harry walked over, squatting down and dragging Scorpius against him. "It's not that easy," Harry murmured.
"Godric, Draco." Harry's shoulders sagged in relief, heart still racing from the momentary panic. "There, Scorpius, see? He's just fine."
Harry let him go, striding to Draco and pressing him close in a tight hug. "Hermione thinks there's something else she can do. She's not giving up. I'm not either. We'll help him fight this, Draco."
The disheveled blonde groaned, leaning forward and pulling Harry's hand closer, taking a small lick of his covered finger before humming in pleasure and leaning forward, leaning over Quidditch toned legs and whispering against Harry's lips. "How do I taste, Potter?"
The boy giggled, the sound muffled by his Slytherin green shirt that was covered in little, baby-like silver coloured snakes. "Daddy-"
Harry carefully worked the shampoo in, tilting Scorpius's head back and letting water flow from his wand to rinse it out. "For someone who doesn't like baths," he remarked, "you're behaving wonderfully."
The little boy leaned down, place Perry's muzzle next to his ear and listened intently before nodding vigorously. "Mmhm! He said it was fun!"
"Yes." Her smile warmed. "Draco, you were always rather good at potions. Are you willing to make some of these yourself?"
"Perry!" Scorpius waved the animal at Harry. "'Arry! 'Arry! T'is is Perry!" He giggled, cuddling the white unicorn to his chest, it's bright blue horn poking himself gently in the shoulder.
His hand closed around the base of the hawthorn wand, a gasp forcibly leaving his chest as the flat practically swooned. It bent under his magic, the wood of his apartment croaking nosily as Draco's hand closed around his wand for the first time in a very long time.
Harry reached out and laid a comforting hand on Draco's shoulder. "Take Scorpius on to bed, alright? We can deal with the fine details after that."
"You know I get the distinct impression that Scorpius is a rather big fan of apples." Harry smiled at the boy, reaching over to ruffle his hair.
"It isn't." He was going through another stint in Azkaban as far as Harry knew. "It... it's Draco Malfoy."
"I will," Harry assured her and tucked Draco closer as she floo'd home. "We're not just going to let him die," he murmured, lips brushing the blonde's ear as he spoke.
Harry smiled at him and Hermione's brows winged up and disappeared beneath her bangs. Well. That explained what they'd been doing. She sent Harry a knowing look just to watch him squirm, and laughed quietly when he did. "There were plenty of colors, yes. No more than yesterday, though."
The little boy giggled, nodded, and ran over to Harry, hugging his leg tightly. "There were so many pretty colours!" Scorpius laughed, dancing around with a finger pointed in the air, making 'swoosh' noises as if to signal a wand casting a spell.
Harry watched Scorpius for a moment, slowly turned his gaze back to Draco. In a moment, the years vanished. This wasn't a former rival; this was a father with a very sick little boy. "Hermione will look at him."
Draco froze, slate grey eyes wide as his mouth seem to run dry. Out of all the people that could of picked his child up, it had to be saint Potter, of course. They hadn't seen each other in years, what was the brunette doing here? "P-Potter?" He stood up taller, a glare coming to his face before it fell, almost immediately, to a look of worry when his eyes locked on to his son cradled in the brunette's arms. He rushed forward. "Scorpius!" He gasped in relief, arms coming out to tug the boy against his chest, his fingers stroking through soft blonde locks as the little boy glanced up at him, wiping the little dribble of blood from his nose with the back of his sleeves.
"Harry..." The blonde groaned, arching his back and not caring about anything but the feeling of that glorious hand on his cock as he watched Harry's fist move up and down along his length, stroking faster and faster.
Harry watched carefully. Draco suddenly looked... sad and that didn't quite fit. Then it dawned on him and his gaze sharpened. The boy was sick, but... With what?
"Oh Scorp..." Draco chuckled softly, a hint of underline sadness evident in his tone to anyone that would listen. Which, at this point in the elder Malfoy's life, was as many people that he could count on one hand.
Scorpius stuck his little pink tongue out in obvious disgust before grabbing Perry with a hurried whisper of "Run Perry, run!" and he zoomed out of the kitchen with sound effects pouring from his lips as he hefted Perry high into the air.
"Maybe I'll show you all the interesting things I can do with my tongue," Harry offered, smile going wry.
And with the Floo flaring behind him, taking the final grin he tossed over his shoulder, Harry was gone.
Draco gave a small start, covering it by nipping at Harry's chin, hands caressing every inch of soft, supple skin his greedy, nimble fingers could reach. "You sure you can even handle the thought, Potter?" he murmured, caressing stomach as he pressed their lips together. "You're shaking at the knees."
Draco's arms almost instinctively wrapped around Harry's torso, head pressed against a muscled stomach. "I-I know... it's just... five years? And only one year of life left? All he wants to do is play Quidditch, g-go to Hogwarts..."
"Don't do too much at once," Harry murmured, reaching out and touching the man's cheek. "You might scare Scorpius."
Draco looked up from tickling his son, a small, warm smile making its way across his lips before he felt warmth spread against his cheeks. Merlin Potter looked practically delicious without a shirt on.
He stopped in shock at the door to his son's large bedroom, gaping. Scorpius lay in bed, a House-elf having turned the lamps on in his room to reveal Scorpius coughing violently, his clean white shirt drenched in a dark liquid.
"Bugger, Draco. If I would've thought for even a second that I could bite at you without getting hexed sideways, I would have done it." He pushed Draco's shirt up, licking at the exposed skin of his back.
Harry walked in and sat beside the child, running his fingers through the soft, pale locks. "Scorpius? It's time to wake up."
His father couldn't help but laugh at that, giving a quick nod of his head. "Okay, Potter. Since Scorpius agrees, why not?" What more dignity do I have to lose? "Lead the way." He hoped the cheers of happiness from Scorpius made this worth it. Why did Harry bloody Potter have to appear at the worst of times? Or... was it the best? He shook his head.
Sinking into the kiss, Harry twined his arms around the blonde and held on. Warmth flooded him, had him moaning softly into Draco's mouth even as his tongue slipped between his lips.
The child nodded happily as he was placed on Draco's hip, the elder Malfoy walking into the kitchen and looking around with a small smirk. "Well, Potter, it looks like you've managed to not destroy my kitchen."
The elder Malfoy smirked as he walked around the bed, pants slung low against his hips. He picked Scorpius up, pecking his forehead. "Let's go make me some pancakes, okay, Scorpius?" The little child cheered, clapping his hands animatedly.
A blush slowly spread its way across the elder Malfoy's cheeks as he pushed away from the brunette and stood, albeit on wobbly legs. "Y-Yes well, what my child does and what I do are very different."
Malfoy licked at his lips, leaning down to nip at Harry's ear, whispering huskily. "I'd be careful, Potter. You never know what might happen when hanging around a Malfoy." His fingers carted lightly under Harry's t-shirt, nails grazing over his back like brushes of air.
Hermione immediately looked irritated and muttered something about lazy, ignorant fools. Harry ignored her and reached out hesitantly. He placed his hands on Draco's shoulders, giving them a squeeze. "We're going to do everything we can, alright? Come on. Sign the things Hermione needs you to sign and we'll get started. You've got a real healer on your side now; everything'll be alright."
Harry was back a few minutes later, watching for a few quiet moments. "Draco? She's in the living room."
His response was a bright grin and an "okay, daddy!" as the little child teetered off to his room with Perry in tow.
"Why not?" Scorpius questioned, arms wrapping almost near-perfect around Harry's neck. "You love daddy, and my daddy loves you-" He looked to Draco for any disagreement. To say Draco was shocked at his own son's words would of been an understatement.
"I'll believe that when the door doesn't swing open tonight while I'm buried inside you." With a rather pleased smile, Harry walked out. His hair and clothes no more rumpled than usual. The little marks on his neck, though... He lifted a hand to them and his smile widened. "Yeah, Hermione?"
"But," Draco smiled softly, poking Scorpius' nose. "You can have one more apple." He felt his heart warm as his son's eyes lit up, a bright, wide smile, looking like it would hurt lit up his face.
Draco called over from the kitchen, a small smile on his lips. "Snitches, Scorpius!" He always tried to get his son to try and speak full sentences, but at that age he didn't seem to mind. Draco shut one of the cabinets, grabbing the small cup of pills and a bottle of warm milk and walked his way down the hallway to Scorpius's room, his heart warming at the sight.
Draco allowed the push, breath hitching in his throat as he was pressed chest to chest with the younger wizard, their breath mingling as they met each others gaze. "Just kiss me and get it over with, Potter." His whispered words were soft, no hint of an accusing tone as his other hand came up to finger the fabric of Harry's shirt, resting his palm against his hip.
Harry smiled at the sound, finishing the dishes and making his way down, a cup of tea in hand. He paused in the doorway, leaning against the jamb. "'Morning, Draco."
"Fuck- Harry!" Draco moaned, pressing into the touch as he leaned down, nipping and sucking at the smooth skin of Harry's neck, hands moving further up his chest as his nails scraped against the sun-kissed skin.
The fingers tracing random patterns over the arm that was locked securely around his waist froze. "L-Love?" His whisper was low, almost a simple breath from between his lips. He truly hoped to Salazar that Harry couldn't feel his heart pounding against his chest.
"Harry," came Hermione's voice. She'd finally managed to stand. "I'm leaving the pages here. Just bring them to me in the morning."
"I've forgotten they were even there," he muttered softly, eyes following the path of Harry's hand to connect with his eyes, warm silver meeting apologetic emerald. "Don't worry your pretty little head over it, Potter." He grabbed the others hand, letting their touch linger for a few seconds before dropping the tan hand in order to pull the pancake bowl closer and help Scorpius pour a lopsided clump of batter on to the griddle.
Draco paused for a moment before he broke out in warm laughter, pulling Scorpius in to his chest and nuzzling his hair. "Haha, oh really?" Scorpius proceeded to regale Draco with tales of how Perry didn't offer Mrs. Her-my-ninny a chair when she floo'd over and how Scorpius was reprimanding him about how she was having a magical baby and her feets would be hurting if she didn't sit. Draco accepted this story with a small smile and fond eyes for his one and only child.
The elder Malfoy smiled warmly, leaning back against the counter with one foot resting up against the boards, his arms crossing over his pale, bare chest as he smiled at the Boy-Who-Lived. "Yeah, yeah. Go throw your name around and have fun. Just come back." It wasn't a question.
Draco stood, moving to kneel in front of Harry's legs, rubbing a soothing hand over Scorpius' back. "We're just trying to figure out what is wrong, okay, Scorp? Harry's right, we wouldn't let anything bad happen."
"Harry!" A voice called from the living room, jerking Draco violently back to reality and jerking out from below the brunette.
"I know." The other man answered blissfully, just finally happy to have his magic back and flowing through his veins, slowly leaking out of its pathetic bind deep inside."O-Oh Harry..." He held his wand tightly, letting out a dreamy sigh. "I can do magic again."
Seamus smiled abashedly, waving a wand-clasped hand from behind his now frozen boss. "H-Hiya Harry! Sorry about him..." He rushed forward, reaching around Hopkins and tugging open a desk drawer with a muttered spell. "Extendable Extension Charm!" he exclaimed, "Hermione's a genius, she is! Here ya go!" A wand was tossed Harry's way. "That's Malfoy's, innit?"
"I guess she's finished reading his files." Grinning, Harry brushed his thumb over Draco's lower lip before getting to his feet.
He gave a quick nod, running his hands through his hair to push it back with a huff. A gasp quickly left his lips, his little body wiggling viciously. "Perry! Perry! I forgot Perry!"
Laughter slipped past his lips as he sat Scorpius on the counter. "Clean and orderly, Harry?" He reached over to the bowl of batter, the lights above catching against the pale skin of his chest revealing long and sinewy scars of a light silvery sheen, running across his chest as he pulled the bowl back towards him, smiling warmly as Scorpius reached a finger inside and swirled the batter around.
Harry slipped a leg between Draco's, thigh pressing into his groin, hands dropping to his waist to somehow try and get him closer.
Draco let out a sardonic laugh. "Let's just get past the next year, alright Potter? I'd like to get past that first before I focus on Hogwarts and classes and books and... crushes. Bloody hell." His head thumped back against Harry's stomach.
"O-Okay, daddy... I..." He wiggled out of Draco's arms, giving him a stern glare (as stern as a five year old who had one year to live could possibly even look) and crossed his arms over his little chest. "I trust you daddy! I know you'll make me better! Hmph."
He nodded eagerly. "Yes, yes. Anything." He looked down at Scorpius, hope beginning to bubble in his chest before it was viciously squashed. No, no. One step at a time, just like Harry said. "I'll need a list of the names and maybe ingredients if you have them. If not, I'll find them."
Draco gave a small sigh, running a hand over his face that was sallow with exhaustion. The blonde allowed his gaze to flicker around the park with a small pang of something keen to longing deep in his chest. Draco Malfoy, once an esteemed (and slightly feared) name, he continued to tell himself as he uncrossed his arms from around his chest - now a single father to an adorable, rambunctious little five year old. The blonde wouldn't have it any other way.
Harry sank down to the floor because standing was suddenly way too much effort and brought Draco with him. Unable to form a complete sentence just yet, he smiled a little devilishly and began sucking Draco's release from his fingers, taking his time and watching the other all the while.
Harry leaned back, beaming. "I'll be back later." He walked out of the kitchen, waved at the boy. "I'll see you later, Scorpius."
Harry tried not to stare at the newly bared back, removing his robes and laying them on the back of the chair before following the excitable child, but it was a losing battle.
"Merlin, yes." Harry snatched up his wand and sent a spell down the hall that would let them both know if Scorpius started their way and put it back away before sliding his hands around Draco's waist. He pressed the heel of one hand against the bulge, scraped his teeth along Draco's spine.
Scorpius shook his little blonde head, big silver eyes were full of laughter as he grabbed the rubber ducky and gave it a squeeze, water coming out of its beak and hitting him in the shoulder. The waters temperature was slightly cold but still warm enough to not get the child sick.
Harry made a sound that was akin to a whimper, dropping one hand to his own jeans, pushing them low on his hips. He grasped his own leaking cock and gasped. "Bloody fuck," he hissed, knees quivering.
He gave a small nod, standing up and resting his chin a top Harry's head, a small chuckle escaping his lips at the awkward height difference. "Okay, okay." Sucking in a shaky breath, he exhaled, his shoulders relaxing slowly. "You really need to stop being my knight in shining armour."
Harry laughed, lowering his head to place a playful kiss on the tip of his tiny nose. "Let's go take your vitamins and then have some delicious pancakes, okay? Or I'll just have to tickle you some more," he threatened teasingly, fingers dancing over the child.
Panting harshly, chest heaving, Draco leaned down and bit harshly against Harry's shoulder, moaning at the small tinge of blood that touched his lips as he dragged his nails lightly over Harry's chest, his hips jerking forward harshly with every ragged breath.
"Hermione's well-aware of my ego, Draco. She's helped perfect it." He ruffled Scorpius's hair, unable to resist it. The little boy was entirely too sweet.
He swallowed, trying to talk past the lump in his throat, and he whispered softly. "O-Oh just shut it, Harry." He leaned forward the rest of the way, a shiver running up his spine as he pressed their lips together, practically melting into the simple touch.
He gave a quick roll of warm silver eyes before standing, pulling himself completely away from the brunette and walking the few feet across the kitchen to grab his wand and re-conjure his shirt, readjusting himself and zipping his trousers back up before sending a small smirk Harry's way. "You might want to dress again before you traumatize my poor innocent five year old."
A blush spread its way across the Irish-man's cheeks, ducking his head as if to hide the tell-tale signs of the redness blooming its way across his cheeks. "I-I will."
Draco took in a shuddering breath, swallowing audibly as he flicked his wand just marginally and the cuppa on the coffee table not even a meter away burst into shards, sending pieces of green glass across the room. Draco gave a small smile.
Quickly, the auror made his way through the kitchen, checking cabinets and drawers and committing the placements of things to memory while simultaneously locating everything he needed for apple pancakes. He generally made blueberry ones for himself on the rare day he had enough time to bother. A glance at the clock told him that it was nearly eight, which gave him plenty of time to get these started before he had to wake the boy up.
A few more tense moments passed as Draco contemplated a few things in his head, sipping his tea periodically. After a moment of consideration he set his cup down on the counter behind him before closing the space between him and Harry, placing a hand gently on the others waist, fingering the fabric that rested against skin below that he had no doubt was taut with muscles and was tan as if kissed by the sun. "No really, Harry," he whispered quietly, throat running dry as his heart clamored in his chest. "Thank you."
He chuckled warmly, crawling forward on hands and knees to lay against Harry's chest, between his legs, head resting right over a sure-beating heart. "I know." He gazed at the both of them, starting from their feet (which we're an odd length apart due to the apparent height difference between the love- dear Merlin. They were lovers, weren't they?) and all the way up to Harry's chin, leaving a small kiss against a stubble-grown feature. "What does this make us?" he muttered quietly after a few tense moments... for himself anyway.
Draco tilted his head to the side, showing an expanse of silky white skin. "Oh really? And what did you think of the so-called 'previous' Draco?" He purred, pushing his hips back against Harry's with a small roll.
The little boy buried his face against his fathers shoulder, Draco nodding his head politely. "Granger. You look well." He took notice of the hand resting against her stomach and offered her a place to sit. "Scorpius, say hi," he chided lightly, a small sense of laughter in his tone.
"Be careful!" Harry called automatically, glancing at Malfoy as they'd spoken simultaneously. The brunette shrugged at the questioning look he received in return. "I spend a lot of time with my godson, Teddy. He's always running after something."
Hermione looked between the two men, nodding carefully. "I see." And she'd have to talk to Harry later. For now, she caught his eye and lifted a brow and his answering smile had her nodding. For now, she was satisfied. "Well, I read through his files and I'm more than willing to help. What I said yesterday, though... I've just about confirmed it."
Hermione sighed quietly. "Draco, if you don't mind, I'd like to take over Scorpius's case. I'll need you to sign a few things so I can have full access to his medical records, but I think I've done everything I can tonight otherwise."
Harry reached out, running his fingers through Scorpius's soft hair. "You're a really brave boy, Scorpius."
Scorpius popped his head out from between the elder wizards' arms, smiling widely and giggling, snuggling up in their arms. Draco smiled at Harry, glancing back down at his son and kissing his head. Draco had never really been optimistic, but maybe now it was the time to turn that around and come out of the metaphorical dungeon that he shoved himself in when he found out his son was sick.
Hermione paused, glancing up at Draco. Harry hadn't told her that Scorpius was unaware of the extent of his condition. Harry jiggled the boy carefully. "You're okay, Scorpius. She's a healer; she just wants to make sure everything's perfectly alright with you. Your dad and I wouldn't let anything bad happen to you, would we?"
When Harry returned, he set his bag on a chair and just watched the man for a few moments. He'd managed to convince himself at home that being attracted to Draco Malfoy wasn't the best of ideas, but now that he was back and looking at the slim, golden-haired man he was back at square one. Emotional attachments were bad ideas, but... It wasn't as though he were on a case.
Dropping his mouth to Draco's shoulder, Harry bit in. A wandless spell slicked his hand, so he was able to grip a little firmer and move a little faster.
He swallowed audibly and groaned, craning his neck back as his lips parted to let out shaky breaths of air. "While you're down there, Potter," he chuckled lowly, moaning enthusiastically. "Mind giving me a hand?" He ground his hips back against Harry's, shuddering at the contact.
Draco chuckled breathlessly, trying to get some semblance of order over his clothes and hair. "Y-Yes, that's what happens when you have a rampant five year old. Be glad he sleeps like a log."
Draco stripped off his water soaked pants as he shut his bedroom door at the end of the hallway, dropping them on the floor and flopping on his bed with a small, blissful sigh. He was out in minutes.
Scorpius nodded enthusiastically, curling back up against Draco's chest as the elder Malfoy followed Harry on the way out of his bedroom, Harry shutting the light off with a flick of his wand.
"Yay!" The little boy wiggled happily, thoughts swarming with little fantasy of all the bright colours that sparked from Mrs. Weasley's wand. "Does that mean daddy is sleeping over again?" The child blushed after a second, silver eyes wide with realization. "I-I mean Mr. Harry."
"Godric, Draco." His hands dug more firmly into the blonde's deliciously pert arse, keeping him as close as possible as he writhed against him as well as he could in this position.
