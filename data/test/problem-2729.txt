That decided Harry, and he slid off Draco's bed with a quick, "Don't move! I'll be right back." He left Draco staring after him as he hurried to retrieve the little package tucked away in a pocket of his robes. He’d bought it for Ginny, but had been forced to keep it when he’d lied to Ron so they could buy the Puffskein.
,” he snarled.
Hermione looked at Harry, her mouth set in a resolute line. “I don’t know,” she said pointedly. “But I’ll bet there’s someone who does.”
Harry sets his mini-packages on the table and, with a tap of his wand, returns them to normal size.  One of them topples over Malfoy's feet and into his lap.  Without pause, he shoves it onto the floor.
'Okay, I'll meet you by the doors.' She put her hand on his arm as she passed. 'You look happy, Harry. I'm glad.'
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Dumbledore. You know, I was with him when he died.' Doge gasped at this, but Harry barreled on. 'That's right. So was Draco, come to think. And do you know what Dumbledore did, with Draco's wand at his throat, when he could barely stand up? He offered Draco a second chance.'
'Perhaps we ought to check on Ron by—' Hermione says, turning to Harry, but as soon as their eyes find Ron, leaning woozily on Gabrielle Delacour's shoulder, he is sick all over her leather pants.
Eventually, Harry catches the Snitch.  The moment after his fingers close around the fluttering little ball, Malfoy slams into him, shouting, 'Fucking school brooms, this hasn't got any fucking brakes—'  He's warm from the sun and his knees are sharp against Harry's thigh when his arms wrap around Harry for balance, and Harry laughs, in spite of himself, in spite of the war and the Horcruxes and all the things to come.
Harry said, 'Michael Corner?'
'Good riddance, I say,' Ron shrugged, biting into a chicken leg with gusto. 'If they don't want to be here, we don't have to put up with them!'
“You shut your mouth,” Draco hissed. He was white with anger, though his cheeks were pink, and his eyes held something dangerous that Harry had never dared acknowledge; he was standing there, glowering, and for the first time in weeks, Harry thought he saw him exactly as he was. A prickle of the familiar loathing began behind his eyes, and it almost relieved him.
“Potter. If I’m not mistaken, that’s my bed.”
There were two more paragraphs, but Harry didn’t feel like reading on. He threw the parchment on Dumbledore’s desk, his anger futile. “Thought you’d make up for all the things you’d done wrong, did you?” he spat.
Harry understood, after a fashion; he had never been the sort to care about expensive tastes, but he knew what it was like to keep up appearances. Malfoy might not be received warmly at Hogwarts, but he would act like he could care less.
'Not very well,' Harry admitted. 'He, um, threw books at me until I left.'
Either way, it goes on under her nose for less than two days, and then she happens to be passing the drawing room just as Ron shoves frogspawn down the back of Malfoy's robes and Malfoy yells.
They stared at each other. Harry had never seen Draco quite so open: he seemed different, less precise, with his hair falling all over, leaning back against the headboard of his bed. Harry thought of the way Draco had looked just before he kissed Harry, laughter in his eyes, leaning down beside him.
"Oh, so now you're proud that you've got people killed? What a hero you are, Potter, sending your family and friends to death."
Perhaps he’d learned something from Snape after all.
“You lent Malfoy money?” Hermione looked incredulous. “Malfoy?”
'What about me?' said someone else, and then the door swung open again and Malfoy stepped into view. He nearly toppled over the umbrella stand made of a troll leg and backed away in horror. 'Sorry, Mother, I lost the address for a moment. What kind of dusty old crypt is this?'
“—get everybody killed—"
'Class was good today,' Harry offered as they sat down, just as Hagrid plunked a plate of lumpy stoat sandwiches in front of them. 'Hermione says we've got wand duels coming up soon.'
Harry felt his face begin to heat up. He wished he hadn’t just grabbed the first shirt he found, a faded white t-shirt Oliver Wood had left behind in the Quidditch lockers after third year that Harry had taken by accident and forgot to return. It was well-worn by now; one of the sleeves had begun to unravel, and it was too small in the shoulders. He rubbed his forehead self-consciously, mumbling an awkward “Thank you” at the two witches who pushed a box of Honeydukes chocolates at him and scurried from the room. When all the rest had gone, he glanced at Lupin, who looked amused.
“Shh,” Hermione hissed, but shook her head. “No, and no giants, either, but Hagrid was right about one thing: the whole town was surrounded by Dementors. Muggles can’t see them, you know, and they were just swooping down on them—" She looked as if she were about to cry. “I just think about my parents, and how they wouldn’t know until the last minute, how they couldn’t even fight back. Oh, Harry, it’s horrible. But really, it could have been worse, couldn’t it have?”
Malfoy looks at him almost curiously, and Harry realizes that he has just spoken to Malfoy like he talks to Ron.  Before he can do anything, correct himself or push on or turn away, Malfoy says, 'Did you find anything?'
'I take it back, I do hate you,' Harry said as he held down a struggling Ron. 'Go the hell away, Malfoy.'
From the way Malfoy's gaze flickered to the cloak in Harry's hand, he found this an offer too tempting to refuse. 'I'm not scared,' he spat.
,” Draco said, something of a whine in his voice. “A willing participant I was not.”
'You'll just have to try harder,' Hermione suggested, infuriatingly calm, as they walked to breakfast. 'Oh, Harry, don't look like that, it's important! I know he's unpleasant, but we've got to—what is it?'
Harry blinked.
“Nott?” Harry exclaimed, a mix between horrified and curious. The news that Draco had kissed another boy made his heart begin pounding double time. “But isn’t he with Padma Patil?”
'Well, he had,' Harry retorted. 'And he was still torturing lots of other families because they were Muggle-born!'
Harry had not forced him into anything. He had come back to Hogwarts of his own accord. He had even said that it was for his mum, not for Harry at all. And if he had to answer for the choices he had made . . .
When Harry emerged from the shop, Malfoy too was nowhere to be seen. Down the street, two witches began to stride towards him with the unmistakable determination of autograph seekers. He quickly ducked away towards the Three Broomsticks, and on homeward.
Harry shrugs.  'I suppose.  What are you doing out here, by yourself?'
“Yeah, and I suppose that’s why you’ve been coming so often,” Harry said sarcastically. He hadn’t seen Cho since the beginning of the year, and after last year’s debacle with Marietta, he hadn’t exactly cared.
'Well, it's obvious, isn't it? You're a great wizard, Harry. I look up to you.'
“Well, your precious Anthony was there, wasn’t he now?” Ron began to say, but Dumbledore stood at that moment, and he quieted rapidly before his voice could carry to the Ravenclaws.
“Well, I
Harry gave her a surprised look. “You want me to tell Dumbledore?” He remembered the strange comment that Professor Kothari had made to him. He wouldn’t be surprised if Dumbledore knew; he seemed to know everything that went on in Hogwarts.
'Try for remorse, that sort of thing?' Malfoy asked sharply, and Harry knew he had been there in the Great Hall with everyone else.
'Oh, please, like you had it so hard, sometimes your
, though when he pulls them back up, they're there. Harry often sits cross-legged just so he can reassure himself that his entire body is present.
'And that's what you came here for,' Malfoy continued, his voice rising in pitch as he kept on. 'You're asking me to return to Hogwarts so I can be the only Slytherin in Slytherin House? Aside from three eleven year olds who are deserting to Hufflepuff?'
But was he right?
'I'll give it back tomorrow, if you behave yourself,' Harry insists.  He feels suddenly like Malfoy's father and has to stifle a laugh.  Half-smirking to himself, he adds, 'But you have to be on your best behavior, Malfoy, no shenanigans from you—'
“If he even knows, I haven’t seen him for ages,” Harry mumbled resentfully, but he turned back to the dueling students.
on her parchment.
“Let me finish.”
Remus was not smiling now. Harry felt as if his insides were crawling with one of Bellatrix’s horrible spells.
,” Harry said again, harder this time. “I didn’t kill him and I can’t do anything about it, all right? Don’t you think I would if I could? Don’t you think my mum and dad would be here right now if I could? Don’t you think—" But his uncle knew nothing about anyone named Cedric Diggory or Sirius Black, and the effort of saying their names was too much for Harry just then.
“All set?” Stan said, winking at Harry. “Good to see you on ‘ere again.”
“Look, I’d put his dad in Azkaban again in an instant and he knows it!”
“Where have you been, Potter?” he hissed, glaring furiously out of the shadows.
'Hey, I like Luna,' Harry protested. 'Besides, she's going with Neville.'
“We’re not friends,” Harry protested, only to be met with her skeptical look. “We’re just. We have an agreement.”
Zacharias chokes.  'Excuse me?'
Were things always this awkward? First she’d been all over him, and now he was sitting here, still aroused despite his embarrassment, and she was offering to talk about Defense. “It’s all right,” he said, hesitantly, still red.
No. No, he shouldn’t wonder. Malfoy had just accused Ron of sleeping with his sister, after all, without a second thought. And this was the boy he wanted to—
Beside them, a portrait let out a loud cough. 'Good sirs,' the man said tremulously. 'Excuse me! G-good sirs!'
'That's disgusting,' Harry says first.  Ron adds, 'Your father is a rotten bastard.'
Harry leaned forward, effectively cutting Draco off mid-sentence. “You know,” he said softly, “I think the lines have kind of been blurring since we started Defense.”
Shouldering his broom, Harry marched out of the changing room just after Ron, followed by the string of Chasers: Ginny and Katie gave Natalie’s arm a quick squeeze before she went and she looked slightly bolstered, though her eyes were still wide and scared.
“One can never be too cautious,” Dumbledore assured him. “But if you are asking me whether dreams can be entirely trustworthy, they cannot. You must continue with your Occlumency, Harry. It is not simply about keeping him from your mind, it concerns whether or not he can ascertain if you are telling him a lie. Someday your life, and the life of your friends, may depend on your abilities.”
Malfoy looks as startled by it as Harry himself is. He says, cautious, ‘Hi, Potter.’
'—but the portrait of Great Great Aunt Theodora—and the rest of Father's books, surely the price they'll fetch won't be worth the—
'I thought you were going to make a bus route to Azkaban,' Harry says with a straight face.
But Draco looked over at him, and blinked sort of slowly, and it was like a secret, really; like the night of Harry’s birthday, like Tonks, but better, because there was something about the curve of Draco’s fingers as they hung at his side, the way he looked up, heavy-lidded as if from sleep.
Harry felt suddenly drained. He couldn’t tell if they were still arguing or not. He looked into the dying fire, its embers barely glowing. “Okay,” he said.

Oh god, Malfoy
Potter,
October 29th
I'm stunned to hear that Ulysses made it all the way to you in Iceland! If I'd known he had to go farther than across the Channel, I'd have hired a transcontinental goose—as I intend to do with this letter. Ulysses is getting older and shouldn't be making such a trip regularly, no matter how much fermented shark waits for him at the end. Thank you for being kind to him; he was my mother's before he was mine.
October 1, 1998
Potter,
.  I was a child.  I had nowhere else to go, and no chance to learn another way of thinking.
Are you shocked?  Or, perhaps, you've always known, and just haven't realized.  I'm rather flaming, in case you hadn't noticed.  I can't advise you on how the Weasleys will react, but at least among Pureblood society, it's considered mostly irrelevant, as long as one does one's duty by the family name.  And, of course, doesn't flaunt it about.  One must keep one's indiscretions discreet, after all.  That said, our opinions aren't the ones you're concerned with, are they?  That's a rhetorical question.
Answering your question about what I'm doing in Iceland is more difficult than I would have imagined. I have my own single room at the hostel, which is an historic century-old bed and breakfast type place, and less the overrun hostel full of near penniless youth one might imagine. The building has the usual large metal sheet siding that most buildings in Iceland need to protect it from the bitter winter winds. It's not ugly at all somehow. Nothing that efficient could be ugly, in my opinion.
And you weren’t there for your mum’s trial,  seeing as hers was before yours, and I’m not sure how much she’s told you about what happened during the battle in the forest. I’ll let her fill you in on the details, if she wants. But if she hadn’t lied to Voldemort’s face, we never would have won. The world owes a debt to you both, if anything.
You thought I was talking about Voldemort.
October 13th, 1998
I have to admit, I'm upset that you won't allow me to help regarding your exile. Of course I won't interfere if that's your wish. I just don't think it's very fair. You aren't an evil person. Even back in school, I didn't think you were. You were mean, but I was mean to you, too. You were ignorant, but so was I. We were children. You don't know this, but I was there on the astronomy tower with you and Snape and Dumbledore that night. (I was under my invisibility cloak, and also petrificus totalas'd, thanks Dumbledore.) Sorry, I know that that might seem like an imposition on your own memory or experiences. To know that I was just secretly there. Actually nevermind, I forgot that you became aware of that during your trial. Gosh okay, moving on.
I don't want this to be necessary, but I believe that it is:  Draco's views on his own mental health do not represent my opinions.  Medications are an important part of mental health for many people, and medicating your mental health problems is not "relying on potions to escape from yourself".
I must warn you, I am quite drunksy. If you are wondering what drunksy means, it's somewhere in between tipsy and drunk. I couldn't hold this quill if I were drunk. An American tourist named Andrew who is here for a week and has become a quick friend coined the term. I laughed overly hard at the use of it, which is how I know I'm at least tipsy.
Merlin I’m sorry, Draco. I’m so sorry he took so much from you and has left you to feel this way. (Voldemort, I mean.) I get it. I do. He took everything from me too and then forced me to give myself up. I think for a long time I subconsciously knew it had to be coming. I subconsciously resented it. I spent years angsting over it, growing more angry, more irritable, more disgusted. More broken-hearted. More resigned. I had to fucking die to make him go away. I didn’t fucking want to. Everyone in the world thinks of me as some martyr, so self-sacrificial. Do you really want to know what it was like walking into that forest? It was a relief. Of course I was happy that it would take him down too, and save everyone else. But I was exhausted, Draco. Emotionally spent. I walked into that forest and I was ready to die. Completely.
I don't entirely remember what I wrote you last night.  I remember enough to think an apology is in order.  Teach me to open a bottle of wine and a letter from you at the same time.  You have this way of totally gutting me—no, I'm sorry, that's wrong.  The problem isn't you.  I don't know how to react to your sincerity, and I end up thinking too much and drinking too much (Mother's not around to share the bottle) and saying too much.  And then somehow it still seems like a good idea to seal the letter and send it.  Couldn't I have at least waited till morning?
he fucking destroyed everything he claimed to care about, the family name, the social order, he fucking tore down the world for
Without debts owed or expected,
What do I DO though. Well. Every morning, I wake up and have a cup of instant coffee, and do my share in cooking breakfast in the communal kitchen with whichever guests happen to have stayed the night before. It's always a different assortment of people, and it's always interesting, learning about where some complete stranger has been, where they are from. I'm going by the name Henry, and I have to say, it's very different relating to people here. Different in a way I don't think I've ever experienced before. I went from no one wanting to talk to me or take any interest in me, to having the entire bleeding world overly concerned about every aspect of my life... to just... being a normal bloke, all of sudden. No one bats an eye when I tell them my scar is from a car crash. No one thinks twice. I don't really know what to do with such normalcy, I guess, because as soon as breakfast is over, I hightail it out of there and start my usual daily walk.
Harry
On this end of the war, I just couldn't go back. Of course, more than anything, I want another year at Hogwarts, a normal year for once. But I'm not a child any longer. It wouldn't feel normal, it would feel wrong. I'd feel overgrown. I don't plan on doing anything that requires NEWTs, so whatever. McGonagal wants me to take some correspondence courses so that I can be her next DADA professor, but GOD. Other than becoming an Auror, which, NO, can you imagine anything more cliche for Harry Potter to be doing?
Château Delanoir, Loire Valley, France
, right now, and figure out what to send later!
Something else I'm doing is thinking of Dumbledore an awful lot. Not missing him, or mourning him, because I've done enough of that, but just thinking through what his actual thought processes must have been, in real time. I can't discuss this with Ron or Hermione or anyone else, because for them, it hasn't been enough time. They can't imagine him in any other way but as a saintly old man who somehow saved us all with his overarching, far-reaching quickwittedness, even from beyond the grave.
Oh, Potter.
First of all, I’m stunned at the fact that your eagle owl found me here, and somehow made a transatlantic flight? I can’t fathom it. Maybe there’s something I don’t know about eagle owls’ stamina. I’m not too familiar with them. Anyways, I’ve insisted he rest here with me for a day or two before he makes the return journey. He’s very sweet, if a little demanding in the treat department. He rather likes fermented shark, just a side note!
I don’t have “something like feelings”, I have full on feelings. I’m here in Iceland, I’m supposed to be looking for something out here, and this happening with you… it’s all part of my time here, my journey towards… um, myself? It’s really surprising and I’m pinching myself constantly, but I’m  here for this.
I'm not only taking sad walks. I'm also spending some time learning how to ride and care for Icelandic horses.  The owner of the hostel has a barn full of them that guests can rent. Lots of them are returning from their yearly trot around the whole of Iceland. Some locals spend their entire summer every year just... riding around the country, while the weather is relatively nice. Another fun fact: once an Icelandic horse leaves the country, whether it's been bought or whatever, it can never return, because it may have regular horse diseases or be pregnant with some other type of horse's baby. Icelandic horses: like Purebloods? Except not at all, because they are lovely innocent horses.
I don't really know who I am, Malfoy. This is the first chance I've had without external threat of death, to try and figure that out. I might be gay. Would you still write to me, if that were the case?
Maybe that's not as funny as I thought.  I'm not far enough from home to be less notorious among wizards, and I couldn't pick up a Muggle.  I'm not even horny, really—not that I'd turn down a tall dark and handsome, but what I really want is just someone to talk to.  Some human contact.  This is an awfully big house to be alone in.  Even if Mother was here, she's never been the physically affectionate one—and she doesn't want to talk.  Not about these kinds of things.  I want—

I know a lot of what you wrote was a result of alcohol, but there’s always truth buried there. Don’t hold back with me. Promise me that? I couldn’t bear it. I don’t do friendships half-heartedly, you see.
Anyway.  I'll send this one expedited; if it does arrive before last night's letter, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the other back unread?  Perhaps that's asking too much.  Transatlantic expedition is hardly a simple business, either, so perhaps it's already arrived by the time you get this.
November 2nd, technically
Malfoy,
When did you realize you were gay? Did you have any crushes at Hogwarts? Have you ever had sex with a man? These are all absurdly big personal questions, but I think I can ask, seeing as we’re friends.
Nothing has been worthwhile at all the past week or two, while I have been sat here wondering if you might hate me again for what I said.
Perhaps I can hope, at least, to over-share on a variety of subjects, rather than just the one.  And you've been kind enough to supply me with topics aplenty.  Surrogacy?

Potter
-Harry
My nightmares are populated with much worse things than Muggles. As are yours, I can only imagine. Let's not talk about it.
Keeping this written here as my official intention, so that everyone knows why I’m in pieces across the Arctic Circle, in case that’s the way this all goes down.
Dear Mr Potter,
Draco Malfoy
Please stop trying to sound American. It's not coming across. But that isn't what concerns me. In fact there are several things that concern me. I'm very concerned. And stalling.
know there are potions that can help with that, too, right?), and so will your notoriety, eventually. You'll never be forgotten by the public, I'm sure, but if you stay out of the public eye, they'll begin to move on to the next shiny new thing.
Definitely nothing wrong with being attracted to someone without being in love. Or being in love without being attracted. I don’t think there’s a wrong way to do it, as long as everyone involved is on board and happy. I just… I just don’t know what’s right for me. I didn’t give it thought, because I didn’t really have time. I’m trying to figure it out. I think I’d want to be in love the next time I do it. Preferably, anyway.
Yours,
I've enclosed some kæstur hákarl, or fermented shark, for Ulysses.
Thanks for listening, Draco.
It's more of an exploration, really. The wilderness here is so vast and ever changing, it never gets boring or repetitive. The hostel in Vik is a 10 minute walk to the black sand beaches of Reynisfjara. If the current isn't too strong and it isn't too cold and windy (not often) I'll walk barefoot through the water, which always feels as cold as ice, in a refreshing way. If the weather is cool and somewhat sunny (the best one can hope for) I'll hike to the top of several different high hills to get a better view of the coastline, the black beaches stretching farther than I'd care to walk in a day. And I say hills, but really, they are incredible, rocky, mountain-like cliffs that seabirds call home. Some of them extend out into the sea a ways, and the waves beat angrily up into the crevices, nearly close enough to touch.
Yes, you told me about the American.  Don't be ridiculous; my American accent is impeccable.  Yes, I'm bent, did you really not know?  You must have been the only person in our year to have missed it.  And yes, it was expected of me that I'd marry a woman—a pureblood witch—and produce an heir.  I've always known I would have to, and while I wouldn't say I was excited about the process, I did always like the idea of having a child.  To recreate the warm and gentle memories my father made with me when I was small, to teach and guide...
Potter, in your entire life, have you ever said anything stupider?
Well, now I'm just making myself sad. I'm really not so sad, it's just another thing to come to terms with in my weird life.
Harry
It's wild here, untamed. But safe enough if one takes the proper precautions. It reminds me a bit of the Forbidden Forest. And there's a cave here, not a proper cave because it doesn't extend very far inwards, but it reminds me of a place Dumbledore took me to once last year. That was a horrible experience, but this place is on the opposite end of the spectrum of caves. Tourists are here, laughing and awestruck and safe, and I can... process, or whatever.
I’m going to send this off and then take the next Portkey to you. I’m— oh my god, why am I still writing? I’ll be there before any Owl.
Yes, you've been wrong about a lot regarding me. I can cook because I was forced to cook for my aunt, uncle, and cousin as a child. Until shortly before Hogwarts, I slept in the cupboard under their stairs. I was never hit or anything, but I wasn't cared for or considered. And you've been ESPECIALLY wrong about me enjoying having any sort of "adoring" public. There's nothing I despise more in the universe than not being free to be myself without everyone else in the fucking world having an opinion.
September 9, 1998
I know what you mean, about finding someone who'd put up with the side effects of a relationship.  Isn't it strange how similar our situations are, each the direct result of playing near opposite roles during the War?  But I'm sure you'll find someone.  It's been less than a year, after all; your night terrors will ease (
the one looking after you now, Anthony and that will leave you alone. They don't want to piss him off, do they? Even they aren't that stupid." He still didn't look convinced, though a soft flush was creeping towards his nose. He also didn't mention that they were the ones to get on the wrong side of Potter. He was a worthy adversary... But Draco shook his head.
They finished their meals and Harry got right back to opening his gifts. Hermione had given him a book about becoming an Auror and other advanced magical careers, which looked really interesting; Ron had given him some new Quidditch goggles with his glasses prescription so he’d be able to see (he assumed Hermione had helped a lot with that one) and a selection of sweets; Tonks had sent him a very fancy shaving set with a note that said
"Malfoy?" He asked, holding the sandwiches and feeling like an idiot. Draco's gaze dropped to the plate, then back up to Harry's face.
. A Muggle book. And Malfoy had said
Chapter 7
"Yeah, but what are we going to do about
“Draco told me, Potter. He told me everything.” He saw a flash of fear in Harry’s eyes, the looks of confusion on his friends’, and everyone else’s, faces. “You’re not getting away with it!” Blaise snarled, pulling out his wand. Instantly, Potter, Granger and Weasley all had their own wands pointing right at him.
mouthing the words and asking Blaise for help every couple of pages.
to do it." He whispered, teeth chattering and lips pale despite the flush in his cheeks. Harry took a deep breath and lay down beside Draco, a little awkward, the blond boy watching him through the silver slits of his almost-closed eyes.
“Shut up,” Harry said tolerantly. “I have another question.”
“Oh,” Harry said. He tried to sound cold out of loyalty to Ron. “That’s nice.”
'Spit in his food,' Ron suggests brightly.
Rita Skeeter's office was clear on the other side of the grand room of cubicles, with glass walls and several photographs of herself, posing with various celebrities. Harry was sickened to see a framed article on himself, from the Triwizard Tournament. The Rita in the photo gave him an exaggerated wink and he turned away.
Her voice softens a bit, but not much. "A secretary came up to my office yesterday, complaining that you and Draco were—that you were in the painting hanging behind her and—" She is embarrassed again. "Oh, Harry, this is the Ministry! I've had complaints all week! Just because you've finally made up doesn't mean you can—you can make everyone else uncomfortable!"
'I said come on,' Harry says impatiently.  'I bet the Apparation wards are still in place here.  We'll have to go out back.'
Just then, Ron rolled over noisily, and Harry froze, one sleeve still on. The last thing he wanted to do was to talk about his evening, even to a half-asleep Ron who would probably be thinking more about the dream he’d just had. But Ron gave a strangled snoring sound and flopped over again, and after a moment, Harry, relieved, pulled off his robe entirely and dropped it on the chair. He just—didn’t want to think about it right then. Or ever, maybe. He was supposed to face Tonks in class. He was supposed to hand in homework to her, and practice Defense with her, and work with her on the DA. And she’d—
'He was just giving an introduction, it was the first class,' Harry suggested, trying in vain to smooth over the situation. 'I'm sure he'll get to all that stuff really soon.'
'I'm fine,' said Ginny.
Hermione raises an eyebrow.  'We'll see.  Oh, George, by the way, how did you hear what I was saying?  I thought only the person in the fireplace could do that.'
Harry blinked. 'Are you jealous?'
Remus took the tray the house elf had brought and set it down on the table. Harry watched him without interest as he squeezed two drops of Veritaserum in one of the mugs and handed it to Draco, then offered another to Harry. Harry took it simply because he didn’t want to go through the effort of declining. He felt very tired, suddenly; trying to wrap his brain around all that had just happened was more of an effort than he had the energy for.
Well, he had thought that once the war ended, he could have what he wanted.
'But—but what if he's trying to gain your trust so he can more easily get to you—so he has more to tell, maybe he's a spy—'
'Hufflepuff?' repeated Malfoy slowly. He sounded half-witted.
Hermione still looked flustered. “She’s seeing Nott,” she explained, shrugging. “They’ve been on and off since the middle of last year.”
Hermione took one look at him, hid her face and whispered, 'The Dementor's Kiss.'
A shadow crossed Malfoy's face and he finally pulled his wrist from Harry's grasp. 'No one wants anything without a price,' he said. 'As if I would have been any less expendable to your side. As if you'd have protected me—or worse, my father!—if it came down to it.'
“Can you what, Potter?” Draco managed to snap amusedly, even out of breath, his cheeks flushed. “You’ll have to be a bit more specific, I’m afraid I haven’t a clue what you’re asking.”
“Poppy?” she called, and Pomfrey came through the door of her office, carrying a large heavy book which she placed carefully on her desk. She looked worried, not even trying to smile at her friend and colleague. McGonagall rushed over to her, and they spoke in hushed, quick whispers. Blaise tried to hear what they were saying, but could only catch a few words: before, fever, blood. McGonagall covered her own mouth, and Pomfrey led her over to the drawn curtains. Blaise only caught a glimpse of what lay beyond the white curtains as they were drawn back, but that was enough. Draco lay on his side in the bed, deathly pale, bruises stark and angry against his skin. His expression was pained, clearly shivering feverishly. The curtain closed again, and Blaise released the breath he hadn’t realised he was holding.
“Draco…do they, um- they don’t force you, do they…?” Harry asked, terrified. Draco smirked coldly, though not with his usual arrogance, and shrugged.
at it, doesn't mean he's innocent." He said, impassioned but not upset, not angry like he was before. He'd got that out and his long walk had helped him sort his chaotic thoughts. Now he was thinking pragmatically, which was not usually his job. He was the impulsive one, the stupid one, the hubristic idiot. Harry and Hermione stood before him in the light drizzle, listening but bashful.
werewolf runt."
He was panting when he realised how much his hand hurt. He looked down and saw his knuckles were bleeding, the skin stinging badly where the lower levels were exposed to the air. “Shit...” He muttered, pulling his jumper to wipe at the blood, but that only hurt more. He didn’t have his wand or anything to wash or heal it, so he sucked on the knuckles, kicking at the coppery taste with slight disgust, but at least it would be clean.
Time passed normally after that, although Harry certainly took more notice of Draco now. He looked sad sometimes, when he wasn’t engaged in conversation or studying, and his friends certainly seemed to care about him which was good to see. Whenever the Malfoy boy looked a little off, one of his friends would gently touch his shoulder and speak to him softly, to which he would smile and nod, his mask of normality sliding into place.
Memory-Draco continued to hold the book tightly in both of his increasingly shaky hands, body tensing with every step of boots on the previously magnificent wooden floor. The house was rotting around them, neglected and filled with darkness, the Manor no longer his home.
'Potter,' Malfoy whined. 'Was it those pictures in the Prophet?'
“How is Colin?” Harry asked.
Harry frowned. So that was what his mother’s owl had said. Feeling suddenly sorry for him, he forgot his trepidation and crossed to sit beside him on the bed. “Well, maybe you can meet Pansy,” he suggested, unsure of what more to say. “Or, er, Blaise, or something.”
. For nearly a year he had run on adrenaline and desperation, on and on through the forests, hunting for Horcruxes and hunted himself, and now, when he had only to sleep and wake up in the morning, eat breakfasts and cheer on the Cannons, the task seemed, at times, insurmountable. If Kingsley had only asked him to help track down the last Death Eaters . . . or perhaps to round up the Dementors still lingering in particularly dismal corners of London . . .
about some things you do, you never even asked me what I thought of you coming back to Hogwarts! You don't include me as part of your life!'
'Good idea, coming back for another year,' Ron said sarcastically at the end of the theory portion of their Transfiguration N.E.W.T. Hermione was feverishly paging through two books at once to check her answers and paid them no mind.
'I wish you'd be a bit more mature about this,' Hermione snaps when he's gone.  'He's like Kreacher, don't you understand?  Malfoy's a product of the world we live in.  He hasn't ever known anything else.  And if we'd all been a bit nicer to Kreacher, maybe he wouldn't have felt so compelled to report to the Malfoys, and maybe—'
At the word
'I'm,' Harry said loudly, 'I'm going to go check for—for the Daily Prophet—'
Hagrid looked guilty at the mention of Sirius’s name, which in turn made Harry feel guilty, as he’d only used it for that very reason. “I don’ know much o’ anythin’,” Hagrid began miserably, but luckily he was saved by the tea kettle, and lumbered about pouring them tea before he could finish his story. When he sat back down, he looked as if he weren’t going to say another word.
They were in the common room now, and several fourth years were sitting by the fire, their eyes on Harry and Ginny.
‘You’re not,’ she said. ‘Or we all are.’
Harry frowned. What was that supposed to mean? He thought of Draco, arms folded, talking imperiously with the portrait of Sirius’s mother as if he owned the House of Black. He thought of him, mouth set stubbornly, casting a hex for the twentieth try, the surety in his glare suddenly giving Harry a chill. He thought of him, kneeling at Harry’s side, eyes dark and unreadable, just after they'd kissed.
Ten minutes later, Harry was still gripping Hermione's hand from the Side-Along Apparition, creeping along beside her down a dark corridor. 'Where are we?' he hissed. 'Is this his house?'
As the days turned colder, Harry found himself wrapped up in the familiar pattern of Hogwarts. By the time October swept through and the leaves began to turn and fall, it was no longer strange to be back. The main reminders of how different this year was were the missing students and the Slytherin table, which was rarely frequented by its four House members. Harry glanced over from time to time, but he always looked away. Why should he care where Malfoy was eating breakfast?
'I don't think you do!'  Neville is glowering at him in a way that Neville never would have challenged Harry Potter as a first-year.  They stare at each other, and Neville says sullenly, 'Why is he even here, anyway?'
'I don't know!' He flattened his hair despairingly. 'Isn't that what you said? That we needed some time to, to think things through?' When she didn't answer, he scowled at the tabletop. 'It shouldn't be this hard, it isn't fair! After everything—'
'I did it too,' Harry said, before Malfoy could get carried away again. 'I'm not proud of it.'
'Not on purpose,' Ginny said impatiently. 'But what if I asked you, what if I said, could you wait a few years, could you
Ron eyed him. 'But you do with Malfoy.'
'Christmas last year was terrible,' Malfoy said an hour later, sprawled on a couch in the drawing room with a half-empty bottle in hand. 'Aunt Bella tried to make me kill someone, and the—the Dark Lord wasn't there but Fenrir Greyback was—'
'I—' Harry begins, then glances down and sees Malfoy's book.  'What are you doing, reading about yourself?'
'You will?  But—'
"Reading my mail, I see, Potter," Draco said icily behind him. Harry whirled around.
, Harry, I'm only suggesting—'
'I thought the two of you were getting along better lately?' she asked. 'Of course, that Parkinson, she's a cow, but at least Malfoy's good at Potions—'
They went.
Draco stared at him. Finally, in a voice tight with disdain, he said, “I don’t take charity, Potter. Haven’t you learned anything?”
Hermione rubbed her hands together in a brisk motion. 'Well, yes, and Malfoy might listen to you. Ron or I wouldn't stand a chance.'
'A few—what?' Harry exclaims.  'Sorry, Professor, but—'
Harry looked at his hands. If possible, he felt even worse than he had when Ron had found out several nights ago. Now he felt as if he should be kicked out of Gryffindor for good. Perhaps the Sorting Hat had been right all along and he did belong in Slytherin. He felt like he was a Slytherin, from the way Ron was staring at him in shock. “Yeah,” he said quietly, unable to meet Ron’s eyes.
! and felt ashamed. Wouldn’t he ever learn? The knowledge that Moody, too, had been fooled was little comfort.
“What?” Harry exclaimed, as if he’d misheard him. “You mean, now?”
Remus, with what sounded like similar amusement, pointed out, “And, Mr. Boot, you might find that a curse of boils is not as effective in a duel as it is in a third year fight. Well done, Hermione.”
Hermione, on the verge of growing more annoyed, realized too, and flushed. “Why, thank you, Ron,” she said, looking rather delighted. Then she added, “But Anthony isn’t ugly! He’s really a nice boy, Ron, I’m sure you’d like him if you gave him a chance.“
Harry dreamt of water. He was under the tree by the lake, watching the lights reflected on the surface, but the sky was a lake too, full of floating stars. The grass was soft against his neck and he was watching stars slip across the sky, tiny swimmers striking out for the horizon, but at the same time he felt a sense of urgency itching against his thoughts, some unsettled feeling in the pit of his stomach. When he heard a noise, he sat up suddenly, and realized why. Wading through the shallows was Malfoy, his pale reflection wavering before him like a reverse shadow.
This wasn’t like kissing in the shed, lazy and tentative in the weak morning light; Harry was gasping up into his mouth, pleasure shooting up his body, and they were kissing sloppily, desperately, a mash of tongues and lips and teeth. Draco bit him too hard, once, and he groaned, “ow,” and Draco licked at it, then kept licking, tongue hot and wet against Harry’s jaw, and he groaned for an entirely different reason.
Malfoy's eyes flared unexpectedly. "Of course I miss him," he snapped. "He's my father! Of course I miss him!" And then, as if to reassure himself, he added, "I’m sure he’s alive. They’re all alive.”
“I didn’t know that,” Harry muttered, a wave of guilt overtaking him. By now, Ginny was staring at him in reproach, and even Hermione looked disappointed.
. ‘Oh,’ is all she says. ‘I see.’
At half past seven that evening, Harry stood outside the gates of Hogwarts, raised his wand, and carefully made a half-turn into thin air. When the decompressed feeling of Apparating dissipated, he found himself standing in a quiet country lane, gasping for breath. As Harry expected, the wrought-iron gate before him twisted into a face, which hissed, 'State your purpose!'
'We need Snape,' Harry says, his voice tight.
'Oh, god,' Harry says.
'Right,' Harry said coldly. 'What's that they all say? Oh, yeah. The time came to fight and Slytherin ran.'
“So they’re all in Wales?” Harry frowned. “But there have been reports of Muggles being killed even in London, haven’t there?”
Harry said, disregarding Ron’s raised eyebrows and Hermione’s tugging him away into the room, “Hi, Cho.”
“Come on, don’t you want to show that prat you’re better than he is?”
'Could you, well, show us the jinx you used sometime? It's really quite a brilliant piece of spellwork.'
,' Ron picks up, 'like Crabbe and Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, even you think she's a—'
He's lounging in the kitchen with Ron, the static of the Wireless in the background, both of their heads slowly drooping towards their books.  'Ow,' Ron says, when he jerks awake for the fifth time and his neck snaps back.  He rubs at it.  'Baiting Malfoy was fun for a while, but now Hermione's got her eye on me all the bloody time—Harry, we've got to find something on R.A.B. before the boredom kills me.'
'Where was there to go?'
Harry looked Draco squarely in the eye and steeled himself not to back down, even when his gaze crashed against those emotionless walls. Voice as steady as he could make it, he said, "Why did you want to be my friend?"
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry said, grinning. Draco smiled before he slipped away.
Lying there with his eyes open, Harry murmured, ‘Breakfast isn’t for hours.’
'You had to have done something in Australia besides read books,' Ron said doubtfully.
“Malfoy!” Harry shouted down the cold stone hall, and the other boy’s steps slowed on his way towards Slytherin. He turned around.
Harry thought for a second of the bruises he saw around Malfoy's wrist in Potions. 'He didn't kill anyone,' he said. 'How can you—it wasn't Draco—'
“Oh,” Harry said, heat rising in his face. He had hoped that, while unlikely, Tonks would never mention it again. “In the, um. With. Yeah.”
Afterwards, maybe, there will be days by the lake and sunlight.
"I suppose." Draco looked thoughtful, glancing down at the pile of gifts beside him.
“Well, Theodore wasn’t,” Hermione said, though she did look away; it had, after all, been Hermione herself who’d Stunned Theodore Nott’s father in the Department of Mysteries. “Besides, Padma says Nott doesn’t know anything. She wouldn’t be with him otherwise. Honestly, Ron, she was in the DA.”
Yeah. He wanted this.
“She’s crazy, Harry,” Ron told him, on the side, “just crazy,” and Harry professed not to understand it either. He still had not told Ron about Tonks.
'I know who you're talking about,' Harry said impatiently. 'But, what d'you—'
“Harry,” Ron called excitedly from across the shop. Harry hurried to where he stood, staring open-mouthed at the selection of brooms.
The next morning, when the post comes, Hermione has a thick scroll in addition to her copy of the
, it's some kind of curse that prevents the speaker from conveying certain information. I tried to write it down, tried to show you the newspaper—'
Hermione
'Oh, Harry,' she fusses just then, pushing a steaming mug towards him, 'don't you want anything else?  Something to eat?  A change of clothes?  We were just at Grimma—at the house, and Hermione said you'd been missing!  You poor boy, out in the rain!  Are you sure you wouldn't like a warm plate of food?'
"It means that I haven't got time to feel responsible for every snotty little child, every stupid imbecile who got himself killed! You hear me, Potter? I refuse to feel responsible! And you, you think you have to take it all on! That's not how you save a world."
Harry was relieved for an interruption, but when Mr. Weasley wasn’t forthcoming about further details and Mrs. Weasley was still bustling around the kitchen, he found he had nothing else to say. “How have you been, Harry?” she prompted again, handing him a tall glass of pumpkin juice. To Harry, every word she spoke was a word she didn’t, which all came down to
'Right.'
“Great,” Harry said, who didn’t care if Ron couldn’t hear him. When Ron looked confused, he shouted flatly, “GREAT, I SAID,” and Ron gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up.
“It was good,” Harry told him. And then, probably because Malfoy was still looking more relaxed than usual, or perhaps because Harry had hit his head recently and wasn't in his right mind, he added quietly, "You miss him, don't you?"
This Christmas, though, was better.
When he reaches the fireplace, he sees Hermione on her knees, leaning towards someone in the fire.  '. . . has got to be an easier way,' she is saying, brow furrowed.  'Polyjuice Potion is just too easy to obtain.  The fake Mad-Eye Moody had us fooled for nearly a year.  I'm still not certain that Harry's himself—'
'He's not a spy!  Look, Neville, I've got it under control, I know what I'm doing!'
'Voldemort wouldn't stick the cup back with somebody else's valuables,' Harry says, speaking up for the first time.  'He put the locket under all those protective spells, too.  It's not like he wants just anybody touching pieces of his soul, does he?  Come on, Hermione.'
'I know you're upset about me and Dean,' Ginny said. 'And maybe you like boys too, which is fine, and it's good that you realized that. But,' she wavered, then pressed on. 'Even Malfoy doesn't deserve to be used for, for sex.'
"Since when have you cared about the rest of the wizarding world?"
'Get—off,' Malfoy huffed, rolling off Harry in a hurry.
"Just answer my questions," Harry muttered. He leaned against the door. "Please.”
“Try again,” Harry said calmly. Scowling, Malfoy did; this time, they snapped upon contact. He kicked at the side of the sofa in irritation.
"Well, I'm not Fudge," Harry retorted. "And I don't plan to kiss any Hufflepuffs any time soon."
“What d’you mean, that’s how it always is?” Harry leaned in closer to him, one hand still fisted in the collar of his robes. Draco pressed back further against the wall, his glare baleful.
“If she does, I didn’t tell her.”
Ron and Hermione both nodded, though Hermione with a bit more enthusiasm, Harry thought.
'Yeah, I can't seem to stop following you around,' Harry said sarcastically. 'What are you talking to him for? Are you—about Remus? And Teddy?'
House,” Ron muttered, but Hermione didn’t hear him. She finished her juice, smiled, and stood up.
Two nights later, Harry opened his eyes to see Malfoy looming above him where he was curled against the stone wall. Malfoy was prodding him with his foot, not gently.
'It's all right, Harry,' Lupin says mildly, smiling at him.  'Draco, I merely thought you might want to speak with your mother.  She has been asking about you.'
Malfoy was still smirking. 'Yes, I expect it's hard for her, being around the stench of—' Malfoy sputtered to a halt, then; Harry had just cast
'Wait,' Malfoy protests.  He glances from Ron to Harry.  'He's—he's hiding under a Fidelius Charm.'
Ron glanced down at his hands, big and freckled, dirt under the nails. 'I've been meaning to go,' he muttered. 'I just haven't got around to it, you know, things have been hectic, haven't they?'
,” Ron exclaimed, wavering a bit. “I’ve only had a little bit, you know, I’m very respin—respensi—I’m fine.”
The old wizard whimpered. 'It was for the greater good, Harry! You must understand!'
It could have been Hagrid’s rocklike biscuits. But somehow, Harry doubted it.
But Harry, stunned, didn’t hear him. He was thinking of the first time since King’s Cross that he had seen Tonks . . . she had been sitting casually on his front stoop, her hair turned brown, as if she wanted to pass easily among Muggles . . .
“It was still made by a Muggle,” Draco sneered.
"Hey," Ron said, tentatively, nudging Harry in the shoulder. He looked almost afraid to disturb him. "Mum says it's nearly dinnertime, if you're, uh, done with that fork there."
Draco opened his mouth, but Harry yelled, “
“I mean,” Harry said pointedly, “why are you here, waiting to drag me into a dark corner?”
She laughed and he remembered that Ginny could be cruel sometimes. 'Well,' she said, still looking at him incredulously, 'I can't believe that you're replacing
“We’re all doing work to prepare ourselves for the exams,” Hermione said briskly. “That’s why every assignment is important. And, Ron, don’t you think this essay is most important of all? We’re starting to study what makes Dark magic what it is. Understanding something is the key to knowing how to defeat it.”
Harry turned the key and climbed off himself, feeling slightly shaky. He wasn’t sure if this was to be attributed to the experience itself, or to Draco.
“Yeah,” Harry said, though he thought it sounded rather halfhearted. What Dumbledore had said about dreams had sobered him; if Harry hadn’t been so foolish and eager to believe what he saw in his head, Sirius would be alive. If not for his “saving-people thing,” as Hermione had said, if not for his belief that he knew where Sirius was, nothing in June would have happened. But Voldemort had suspected that Harry would believe his dreams without question, and Harry had fallen right into the trap. He said, hollowly, “I’ll tell them.”
Ron snorts.  'Oh, that's rich.  He could be planning our deaths, and you want to throw him a birthday party?'
“Are you going to do it?”
'Oh, the two of you, you'll see,' Hermione retorted. She had not touched her food, and now she was tapping the end of her fork agitatedly against the table. 'I swear I've read about another case like this. Three years ago, Nick told us that this has happened before. Was it in sixteen ninety . . . no, that was something else . . . perhaps . . . oh, hang on, I've got to look in the library!'
Harry laughed. 'What are you, jealous? No, I've never been up there with anybody.'
'Anything interesting?' Ron asks, momentarily abandoning his mutterings about Hermione's taste in men.
But Harry wasn’t anywhere to be found at number four, Privet Drive; he’d vacated the house that morning, shortly after Dudley set out with his pals, and had spent the remainder of the day wandering Little Whinging and sitting in the park. And, at this very moment, he was watching the last few older boys and girls tug their younger siblings home for dinner while sitting listlessly on a swing, entirely unaware that a few blocks away his cousin had just shown up at home dead.
'You mean break up?'
Remus gave him an encouraging smile as the room filled with the Quick-Quotes Quill’s furious scratching. “Well, I’m glad to hear it. Where were you after dinner tonight, Draco?”
'She sent you chocolates from France?'
'But I don't want it to be like that,' Harry muttered. 'Politics, I mean.' Too much lately had been wordgames, things that had been said or not been said, false claims, mistakes in the past. He thought of Ginny saying, I don't believe you. You don't act like it.
“I don’t have time for common decency.” He crossed his arms, glaring at Harry challengingly. “That’s the difference between you and me, Potter. You think you’re responsible for the world. I think I’m above it.”
Harry couldn’t believe he’d ever liked her.
Malfoy eyed him with skepticism. 'To start a club you need an advisor.'
'You mean, the way it's corrupt and full of bias?' Harry said at once. 'I think you
“Who else, then?” persisted Harry, trying not to think of Crabbe and Goyle kissing anyone, much less each other.
Ron's gaze switches to Harry.  'What?'
'I have this map,' he explained. 'Here, I'll show you.'
"I never thought that," Harry said fiercely, "and I never told Ron about the quills, so you can stop having a fit about it. And Ron doesn't live in a hole. He has a very nice house."
“Certainly,” said Remus, as Dumbledore set the quill to parchment. “Now. Are you Draco Malfoy?”
'Look,' Harry says awkwardly, 'I did try, you see, it's only that—Voldemort is pretty, uh, powerful—'
"Don't 'sorry, Mum' me!" Mrs. Weasley shrilled. "I know just where you were last night, young lady, and I won't be forgetting it!" Her voice turned gentle, for a moment, and she said, "Harry, dear, I'm sorry about your cousin. You'll have to ask Arthur about that when he gets home, I'm sure he can straighten things out." And with that, she continued indignantly, "Now all four of you finish up your breakfast, and we can start to work on the china cabinets. I know for certain there's some silver that needs polishing, Ron, and that wood could use a good dusting!"
Stumbling inside, Harry almost tripped over Ginny, Ron and George, standing and talking by a display of funny hats. At his clumsy entrance, Ginny glanced over at Harry and grinned.
'I,' Harry said, hollowed out inside. 'It's fine, Ron. She said she wasn't going to wait, I didn't expect anything.'
'Now what did you want to ask us, Harry, dear?' Mrs. Weasley asks, looking at Harry with concern.  Her eyes flicker for a brief second at Malfoy, as if to say,
Harry moved closer to them, fists clenched. “Be careful what you say, Parkinson.”
Harry sat in a daze as 'Alderton, Edgar' and 'Bagnold, Basil' were Sorted, clapping without thinking. He had stood there that morning as the Great Hall filled with sun and it had all seemed so unreal: everyone had wanted to touch him, hug him, whisper his name, and then they had wanted to tell him about the dead, the lost ones. Now, as Flitwick read off the names, it seemed inconceivable that Hogwarts had been a burial ground only months before. Life had gone on, there were funerals and sandwiches and post in the morning . . .
Draco jumped and looked up, eyes darting around searching for the cause of the noise, panicked. Blaise stepped forward and the blond boy instantly relaxed, letting out a shuddering breath of relief.
Then Harry stood up, breathing hard, and slapped Draco hard across the face with the back of his hand. Draco fell into the newly locked door and didn’t have time to stand up properly before Harry was on him again, spinning him round and pressing his face into the cold metal wall. “How fucking dare you.” Harry snarled into his ear, feeling him tense with fear.
“Come with me, Mr Potter, we will collect what you need for the night.” Dumbledore said, heading for the boys’ dormitories.
“Malfoy, for God’s sake…” he muttered, hauling the skinny boy back onto the bed. Draco hissed in discomfort when his bum hit the mattress, making Harry feel a bit bad. “Look, just…stay there, until you feel better…” he said with a sigh. Malfoy glared at him, but obeyed, pushing himself to lie on his side across the bed. “Where are your clothes?” Harry asked him, trying not to look at Malfoy’s arse.
Harry had moments of true anger, where he would snap and say something cruel. Everyone had their limits and his ever present obsession with Malfoy had been a growing concern from the off, though she’d never entertained the idea of it being fuelled by anything other than suspicion. Learning the unspeakable, awful things Harry had done, even if it was under Voldemort's control, had made her realise that she'd always suspected Harry of having a much darker side than he ever showed outwardly. She wasn't afraid of him, she loved him unconditionally as her very best friend, but she knew his darkness may hurt others, and maybe those others deserved it, but not this, not what he did. No-one deserved that.
“Draco? Are you ok? Are you having another attack?” he asked. Even after a good night's sleep and nearly a whole day, he wasn't sure he'd be able to help Draco properly so soon. But Draco was shaking his head, one hand on Harry's arm as the other held onto the bedpost for dear life.
“Dunno, all day probably. And tomorrow if we don’t get it done.” The Monster gave Harry the urge to make sure they had tomorrow with Malfoy as well, but he tried to ignore it. Hermione shook her head.
Legilimens."
“I will ensure you won’t be blamed for this, Harry. It is Voldemort, and Voldemort alone, who is responsible for this. I only ask you continue with your Occlumency lessons and…stay away from Draco Malfoy.” He said the last part with definite pain in his voice, looking away from Harry for the first time. McGonagall was still having trouble meeting his eyes. Harry felt a wave of rage, wanting to shout at them that it wasn’t his fault, to stop making him feel like a rapist, but he forced it down, terrified the Monster would wake up. He wouldn’t put it past Snape to kill him at the moment, if he gave him any opportunity, even in front of Dumbledore.
"H-Harry…!" He gasped, his body writhing and bucking. Harry looked into his misty eyes questioningly, waiting for him to tell him to hurry up and fuck him already, get it over with. Instead, Draco forced himself closer to him and raised a shaking hand to cup the side of Harry's neck. "Kiss me…? Like last time?" He whispered, somehow meek. Harry let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding and nodded, wetting his own lips quickly.
Harry watched Draco’s wide grey eyes trying to look over at Crabbe, like he was begging him to help him. Harry knew, if the spell on Crabbe broke at any moment, he would leap to Draco’s aid, probably kill Harry if he managed to get his huge hands on him…especially after he saw what the Monster had planned.
“Draco?” he asked when he was close enough to see the white gold hair. He had noticed he wasn't in the hall for dinner, had assumed he was eating in his Common Room.
Harry cast Muffliato on them, allowing Ron to go off on one again about Draco still being dangerous.
Crabbe unfroze, experimentally moving his fingers, and his expression looking confused. He saw Draco and seemed to recall what he thought had happened, and stood up, looking out the window and the calming snowfall.
"I've… n-never done it without… feeling like this…" he whispered, tears rolling over his nose. Harry stared at him, stunned.
, pioneering, it's going to change the world of Potions. And he left me the privilege to compile and publish it all posthumously for him." He said, smiling, glancing at Blaise, who squeezed him gently. Draco smiled and kissed his cheek. "Blaise is assisting me, of course. There's a lot to go through and he's
“Look at you!” she cried, grinning. He smiled at her, then glanced at Blaise, who grinned back at him. “What happened?” she asked, piling food onto her own plate.
They arrived at the familiar gargoyle and went up the winding stairway once the password was said, though Harry had no idea what it actually was. His heart was pounding in his ears so loudly he could barely hear their footsteps on the stone.
was his alternative? Die? Watch his family die? He's already been… been hurt so badly… I don't know what I would do in that situation. Yes, he hurt you, Ron. He's hurt all of us, and our friends, and part of me wants to punish him for that, but... his actions were either borne of his family's beliefs, his beliefs, or forced by
The voice boomed out as though amplified by a spell, like the one Mr. Bagman used at the Quidditch World Cup. It seemed to shake the constructed room they were in, the floor rumbling as every bottle and jar rattled.
“Yes...I had fun too. Thank you, Potter...for everything. And, um, keep that coin on hand, alright?” he said. Harry grinned and nodded, holding it up to show him. A ghost of a smile appeared on Draco's pale face, before he turned away quickly to pull his shoes on.
“Hey...” he whispered, eyes barely open and voice thick from sleep, yet he knew to move his hands away. “Another one?” he asked. Draco nodded, trying to get his breath back.
“I haven’t slept that well in a long time…” he admitted softly. Harry grinned.
“I asked Crabbe and Goyle. They woke up in a broom cupboard at 4 in the morning, and you were always skulking arou-” he cut himself off, biting his lip to muffle a moan of pain when he tried to stand a bit taller. Harry helped him quickly into the Common Room, which was just as he remembered it – large, grand, and cold. “Through there…” Draco said, pointing a shaky finger to an ornate black door to the left. Harry nodded and they went over to it, Harry awkwardly opening the door and manoeuvring them both through. Draco pointed to another door and they went in, finding a dormitory with 5 beds. It was very similarly laid out to Harry’s own room, except the reds and golds were replaced with greens and silvers, and it felt much colder in here.
The Slytherins were in their usual formidable nest, blocking everyone else out with their proud backs and unfriendly expressions. Harry summoned every ounce of courage he possessed, which to be fair was a decent sum, and cleared his throat behind Theodore Nott. The gangly boy turned slowly, frowning, perhaps expecting it to be a teacher and followed by some kind of rebuke, but his expression became a sneer when he saw Harry.
“But…why Draco…? And why through me, surely he can do that stuff with his own body…?” Harry asked. The teachers looked uncomfortable, except Dumbledore.
“I just…wanted to make sure you’re ok…” Draco frowned, still staring at him. Harry sighed, deciding Draco would prefer him to be honest. “I was…worried about you. I
Oh. Shit.
“Good answer. It's just gone 10 if you want breakfast, by the way.” He said before leaving. Blaise sighed, breakfast finished at 11 on Sundays. He woke Draco up with reluctance, wanting his friend to get enough sleep just as much as how pleasing he found his sleeping face. The blond looked confused as he blinked himself awake, then he seemed to recall the night's events and looked panicked.
which made him laugh. Fred and George had given him a load of his favourite Wizard Wheezes products; Alistair Moody, he assumed, had sent an unwrapped Sneak-o-Scope. Remus had sent a lovely picture of the Marauders, excluding Wormtail, and his mum, Lily, at some formal shindig where they’re all dressed up, raising  champagne glasses and grinning away, in a nice silver frame. On the back was written
"They've been spending loads of time together."
Harry saw Draco’s hand shakily reach for water jug and, doubting he’d be able to lift it right now, poured a glass out for him. He handed it over before Draco could protest, and Malfoy only gave him a small glare before sitting forward to sip the cool liquid, holding the glass in both hands.
“I'm good, thanks, really good… Getting my life together, which is quite a foreign feeling to be honest.” Harry said with a soft laugh, rubbing his sweaty palms against his thighs nervously. “Do you... live around here?” he asked the both of them, and they nodded, looking at each other and smiling.
Blaise followed Dumbledore and McGonagall up to the Headmaster’s Tower. He could sense Potter behind him but knew that, if he looked back, he’d do something he’d probably regret. They arrived at a large stone gargoyle, and Dumbledore said ‘Caramel Cauldrons’ and the gargoyle began to spin, moving upwards and bringing a spiral staircase with it. Blaise was taken aback, having never visited the Headmaster’s office. Potter, however, didn’t even break stride, passing Blaise as he followed the teachers up the stairs. Blaise clenched his jaw, and followed.
"Tell your mother first then. She can handle Lucius and… and the others. Speak to Potter, tell your mother, and
“Ok, night.” Harry said without really thinking. Draco glared in the vague direction of Harry’s invisible form, and marched off to his dormitory, wearing a huge robe, and barefooted. Harry smirked, and went back up to his own bed in Gryffindor tower.
He barely felt himself climax, a slight clouding of his vision and sense of physical relief as the Monster pressed him balls deep inside Draco, pumping him full of Harry’s seed, laughing in Harry’s head. Harry watched himself slip wetly out of Draco, letting go of him. The blond fell to the bathroom floor, thick pink-tinted liquid oozing from his ravaged hole, letting out shuddering breaths. The Monster gave one last satisfied look down at what it had accomplished and went back to sleep, leaving Harry staring down at Draco, utter horror gripping his heart.
"They're both arseholes!"
“Charlie was exactly the same, darling, thin as a rake when he got home from school – they must not feed you enough! I’ll have to write to Dumbledore.”
Everyone else avoided them that day. Not even well-meaning Neville attempted to distract them with some lesser known herbologist’s theories on why Australian plants tended to have lower voices than European ones, though he was happy to regale Dean and Seamus despite their weary looks.
“Harry? Are you alright? You’re really pale…” Hermione was saying but he just waved a hand vaguely over his shoulder, and went up the stairs. He hardly even registered he was casting a Muffliato spell as he went.
“About 6 o'clock, I believe. Looks it might be a pleasantly balmy Tuesday.” Dumbledore replied, turning slightly to smile at him as they walked. Harry was confused and a little upset about being locked away, being told nothing. Tuesday? Had he really only been in there for two days?  He wanted to know how Draco was, and what was going to happen... He wondered how much the teachers had seen in the Pensive, how much he disgusted them now... Dumbledore was treating him normally enough but the old man had a knack for lying with kindness.
Most people screamed and tried to cover their heads and/or food, grabbing what they could and running for the exit. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, despite being drenched, and nodded to the others, all blinking water out of their eyes. They all rose as a unit, his arms around the quickly weakening Draco to help him up and off the bench. He could walk and stand well enough but he was shaking so badly already, so suddenly, it was a wonder he could move at all. Keeping him close, they were flanked by their respective friends, rushing from the scene now descended in chaos, joining the running crowd.
"Come on then." He said. Harry followed, already regretting this whole thing. The Room was different this time, no rose motifs or giant four-poster bed. Now, it looked like a posh living room, with a sofa before the fireplace, like before, but no inviting rug or dim lighting. There was a writing desk in the corner, stocked with paper and quills, and what looked like a games table too. Draco walked in with a sigh, sweeping a hand through his hair, and he sat down on the sofa, curling his long legs up beneath him. Harry hesitated for a moment, the Malfoy looking over at him expectantly, then moved to join him.
