I turn around to look at him ''Thank you'' I say with a small smile.
He turns me a little to push me into the counter, my ass pressing into the black, marble vanity. His hands grip my hair pulling my head to the side to gain more access to my neck again and I feel him bite down harshly on the same bruise he'd created with his teeth that one night.
There she was, the women from the photo walking slowly towards her with an inviting smile on her face.
''Love you'' I chuckle walking towards the door with Theo.
He sighs and straightens his humoured face into a more relaxed one.
''I need to take out my frustration'' he says looking down at me with a serious expression ''Do you understand that?'' He tilts his head to the side as if he's genuinely asking me if u do.
''Sit with me?'' he asks and I shake my head at him with a scowl ''Oh come on, I'm sorry for yesterday'' he smirks again.
''For being a brat'' I answer sucking a breath in as soon as I feel his finger rest back on my sensitive clit.
I never really noticed Draco in school though, for some reason I never recalled him even being there at the same time, year and house as me. I was far too in my own little world with Theo and Elara and going to classes and back to the dorm. Keeping to myself mostly.
I look down at his hands which are placed on the back of the chair wood still clenched around it and I reach my hand to pick up one of his which he flinches at making me look at him.
My heart feels like it's going to beat out of my chest at the rapid rate it's now going. He isn't even touching my skin, yet I feel the iciness of his hands hovering over my leg as he works on my dress.
I frown at him ''What are you doing?'' I whisper with a humoured smile finding my lips at him kneeling on the floor in his black formal shirt and trousers.
''What?'' I snap at him, feeling aggravated at the way he stares at me from across the room like a pompous idiot.
''Oh come on. Maybe I can help you finish off that letter'' I smile trying to lighten the mood before my face falters back into a frown when I get no answer back,
Obviously I'd feel great about that.
''I'll give you a massage'' he offers making me turn to look at him with a frown.
''I stood up, how does that mean that I'm going to follow you?-''
I wrap my arms around her letting her back rest against my chest as I leave kisses against her neck and shoulder before spinning her around to face me quickly which she gasps at when I pin her up against the cold tiles.
And again and my knees buckle beneath me through my scream, my body almost falling to the floor to the point where he has to grab me by the waist with his one arm in a strong hold to keep me up and pull me against his chest.
''Malfoy?''
''Juliet, is it?'' I heard come from beside me and I stood up immediately to face the women who stood in the entrance way to the dinner hall. My hands placed formally in front of me.
He helped her off the kitchen counter allowing her feet to touch the cold, tiled floor and picking up her panties of her.
''So what have you been doing then? Sitting in your bedroom after a shift and living like a hermit''
''I-I thought this was for you to-fuck-to let out your frustration'' I moan throwing my head back then grabbing onto his arm as he begins to add another finger and pump them inside of my pussy more vigorously.
I really shouldn't answer,
''I told you last week when I came to see you. Everything's going fine'' I smile at the boy over the phone. He truly is very caring.
''Yes alright'' she moaned and Theo stroked her hair to the one side of her shoulder softly.
He then lets his hands off me and comes back up off the floor to sit back down in his seat beside me while I'm still searching for oxygen, pushing his black sleeves of his shirt back up his arm from where they must have fell.
He tuts at his mother then looking back at me again with a stern expression ''Drink, now'' he demands of me, his mother shaking her head to the table and his father sitting there not saying another word ''Carter-''
''Still not found anything?'' Theo asked her as she sighed heavily placing the quill onto the newspaper which sat on her white sheets, shaking her head in defeat.
I spot 'Wuthering Heights' and raise my hand to get that one but he nudges me out of the way and grabs it with a smirk. I turn my body to look at him with my mouth slightly open and my arms crossed in front of me as he smirks down into the book.
His thrusts got deeper and deeper, fucking right into her as her fingers pulled at his hair. He flicked her clit with his finger only making her moan more into his lips.
Please stop talking about this now.
''How's your cramp?'' I ask sarcastically.
''I'm the new maid yes-''
''I can go now?'' I sneer at him from where he stands and he nods back at me swirling his belt back through his trousers to buckle back up.
He leans himself down and pulls my hair to the side again so he can reach my ear, his erection pressing into my ass through his trousers ''Good'' he whispers before pulling back away and unclasping his belt and pull it off his trousers.
''Fucking prick'' I hiss before walking out of his bedroom and going into mine next door.
Perfectly positioned, neat and tidy.
She lowers her head to place a kiss on my jawline making me tilt my head back as she traces them to my neck.
''Darling-''
''You are such a misogynistic pig'' I hiss at him.
''See you later dear'' She smiles towards me and I give her a smile back before she rushes out the front door.
Juliet wasn't working at the moment and was trying to seek a job. She'd search through papers, knock on windows to shops but nothing seemed available. She'd lost her last job being a waitress at a Restaurant in Diagon Alley due to it getting shut down for not having much business.
''Then what?'' I ask looking at how he licks his lips slowly.
My breathing becomes heavy due to how filled with resentment I am right now.
I shake my head.
''Ok'' he breathed out ''Just be careful, especially if you do get the job''
''The cologne'' he says rather quietly.
She swings open the door looking at me with a face full of confusion and now I feel frozen.
''You falter a lot. It's like you lose every bit of strength, even if I'm in the same room as you, you lose your cool'' he says looking deeply at every feature on my face, then brushing my hair behind my head and placing his hands on my shoulders to brush down my arms,
He smirks from behind me devilishly with a tut ''I was hoping you'd say ten'' he lets out a breathily short laugh ''But fine, six it is''
''I understand''
''Oh yeah'' he says before looking out the window with a gritted teeth then back down at me ''Dear-'' he pauses for a second then scratching his head ''Mr Wink-Winkles''
''Wow, thanks I didn't know that. I guess I should I stop then'' he says sarcastically then taking another puff of it and blowing it right into my face which I sneer at him for.
''Then why are you here?'' he asks, not bothering to move his forehead from mine as he pushes a piece of hair behind my ear ''Being nice to me''
''No, I moved in with my friend and his parents and then we-me and my two friends got a flat together when we reached 18'' I reply seeing how Draco tilts his head up to look at me with an annoyed scowl.
******
''I'm joking'' he smiles to what seems to be genuine and pushes himself off the door to walk towards me.
''No Juliet'' he said firmly with a short chuckle ''No'' he repeated more seriously this time looking deeply into his friends eyes.
''I don't care'' he mutters walking over to a drinks tray a couple of steps away from him and pouring himself a drink.
''Yeah, I think you might have to help me to bed'' she says through shaky breath and I nod down at her.
''Or you could come with me?-''
She sat there on her bed flicking through the job vacancy segment of the Daily Prophet, underlining each job she thought suitable to look more into with the point of her quill until her hand slipped due to the sudden crash of someone on the bed beside her making her look up to her dark-haired friend with a tired expression.
I pull her closer into my chest, my hand now playing with the back of her hair as she does with mine.
And again, the belt hits my ass cheek and I feel like I can picture the rush of red that must cover my fair skin right now.
''The maid'' he sneered down at Juliet before taking Astoria's hand in his ''Come now, we don't stand around the inferior'' he said looking back at Juliet before walking into the kitchen to his mother with Astoria hand in hand.
''Ju-Juliet'' she answered breathily and he nodded down at her.
''What? No-''
''And who's this?'' Astoria asked from behind him.
''No, you don't have to move out. We've got this, yeah?'' he said then noticing how Juliet had not replied back to him with anything but a shrug ''Yes?-''
''Yes. Nothing deep, but he's-'' I pause as we continue walking to the bottom of the stairs, her eyes glancing on the side of my face hoping I go on ''He's a little calmer, I guess'' I tilt my head to give her a smile before we reach the last step then walking towards the dining table.
''Because'' she says and I rise my brow at her.
''I'm only down the road'' I whisper down at him watching how he places his hands on either side of my hip with a deep sigh.
I walk around trying to find Mrs Malfoy before hearing voices from the dining room assuming it's her from the female voice.
''You just have to spoil my fun'' he smirks stepping outside the door and closing it.
I inhale and exhale to rid my self of the utter frustration I feel right now towards him.
You can go now? What the fuck?
''You not going to speak to me?'' he asks and I can hear his smirk ''I'm bored-''
I couldn't help but think he was looking at every silver line and every imperfection my body held as I sucked in a shaky breath, wanting to wrap my arms around my body and cover myself back up.
He lowered his face to come near hers, their foreheads almost touching.
''Was I feisty when you fucked me? When you humiliated me afterwards?'' I suddenly say feeling a rush of resentment flow through me at the thought of that night and the way he brushed me off as if I was not worth anything more than a quick fling.
''The way you talk-''
''You want to do something for me?'' he whispers looking at me still with that harsh look on his face, as if his blood is burning.
He brushes his hands through his hair not noticing I'm currently looking at him trying my best not to laugh.
''Oh, sorry-''
''Such a pretty girl'' I whisper while my other hand comes up to squeeze her breast and flick my finger over her nipple allowing her to let out a soft moan.
''Are you sure? I need you to be sure-''
He walks over to me and undoes the buttons to his shirt, pulling it down his arms and throwing it to the floor to reveal his pale, toned chest. He was like a sculpted God. A statue made perfectly for a museum. He wasn't too muscly, nor to slender. He was just perfect.
I chuckle before placing my hand out in front of him with a shrug ''It's my job to help with anything you need''
He made me feel things earlier, things I didn't know I could feel. No-one has ever enticed me as much as him and I hate to even think that. It mentally pains me that such a horrible, callous being could be stuck on my mind right now, thinking of what could have happened if his mother hadn't interrupted.
''I better be off then'' I say standing up from the sofa in the living room of the flat where Theo and Elara sit with me.
''You'd look like a right princess in a manor'' he said with a smile as he watched her reading the advertisement still.
He looks back up at me with a scowl ''Fuck off'' he mutters flicking the cigarette out the open door and closing it.
''Ok?'' he asks looking down at me looking like his eyes were about to clench shut from my tightness around his cock.
''I'm making sure you're actually leaving and not going to follow me-''
''I already know you do anyway. I hear you through the walls'' he says with a smile finding his face and my face drops.
''Ugh, fine. Love you''
I go over to the bed looking down at the very cliche maid outfit placed upon it. A short black dress with a white collar and a pair of black stockings. I pick the outfit up and quickly put it on. I pull the stockings up my leg trying my best not to rip them with how thin the material is.
''Well that's good because I was going to go to my room'' I smile seeing how he rolls his eyes at me and looks to the side with a cheeky smile ''Go on then, I'll see you out-''
He stalls for a moment holding the door as he stands inside the manor as I turn around to look at him from the doorstep.
Ever since that night I had her, that one night with her skin on mine and her body ready for me to take, I've wanted it again. I just want to touch her over and over again. I didn't know you could get so addicted to something after one hit.
I came to the very quick conclusion that if I was to rearrange anything in this room he'd probably happily get my blood on his hands.
NARRATION
''I've missed you too, both of you'' I say looking back at Elara ''Ok, I'm going now. Stop trying to keep me hostage'' he smirk at both of them grabbing my bag off the sofa and placing it over my body.
''I have''
I shake my head at him with a straight face, feeling incredibly uncomfortable right now.
I grab her by the back of her neck and pull her towards my face ''Such a submissive little slut for me'' I smirk whispering almost into her lips as she closes her eyes with her chest pacing up and down.
''Are you always this disgusting?'' she snapped at him, feeling her temper rise.
''You two do make a lovely couple'' Narcissa says looking between them with a smile as I pour some of the wine into Narcissa's glass too noticing how Draco stays exceptionally quiet throughout this whole conversation, his eyes placed down on his empty whisky glass which he seems to find even more interesting.
''I'm not going to drop you'' I mutter.
''You treated me like a prostitute'' I snap and he stops walking and stands in front of me.
''It was nice seeing you again Mrs Malfoy'' he smiled then turned to Juliet with a smile and pinching her cheek making her scrunch her nose up ''I expect to see you next week'' he smirked at her only making her roll her eyes.
He looks back at me flicking his fingers through his hair.
''At the manor?'' he frowns down at me with a swallow.
She unbuckled his trousers with quick pace, then pressing her hands into his boxers as he groaned into her lips, her hand now motioning his cock up and down. His lips lowered to her neck where he placed an array of eager kisses across her porcelain skin.
''You know, you really are the vilest person I've ever met'' I hiss at him and he just looks to the corner of the bathroom away from me again ''You can't just do that and then act as if I'm fucking diseased or something-''
''That'll do''
''Yes'' I breathe out and he smiles down at me.
''Your hand is so cold'' I whisper, trying to mix the warmth of mine with his as I rub his hand with soft strokes with my thumb, finally noticing his hand had now fully relaxed in mine.
''No. I've come to the conclusion that you just must be a terrible kisser'' she smiles biting the inside of her cheek at me only making me chuckle at her.
''Do you want to repeat what you just said?'' I hiss into her ear and she chuckles.
''For 700, sure'' I shrug with a smile up at him.
He lets out a breathily chuckle running his thumb across his bottom lip which I catch instantly.
I let my hair down out of the clip that was holding it up due to the strain it had been pulling on my hair throughout the day.
''You see since the whole Elves rights came into play, we've been without any help in the home for a while now. As long as you can do all those things, then I don't see why you couldn't be fit to work here'' she smiled once again.
''Pretty pretty girl'' he whispers with a smirk and I moan when he slides a finger inside of me, hitting my G-spot instantly beginning to thrust it in and out in moderate pace.
I know he wasn't.
''So you're the new skivvy?'' he says with a slight tilt to his head and I can only notice how his eyes look more grey than in that picture that hangs on the wall right behind him.
''I'm bored'' he sighs looking back in front of him.
He then cracks his neck from side to side with his eyes closed before looking back down at me once again.
''Yes, you too'' I simply say almost through a breathily whisper through my nervousness.
''What do I write?'' I say with a small chuckle and a shake to my head at his concentration span.
''And what did I tell you? I told you not to invite her here-''
He looks back up at me with a sigh ''Do you want more money, is that it?'' he asks and I shake my head at him.
Such a bitch.
''Do you with other girls?'' I hear myself ask him without even realising making him flick his eyes back on mine with an awkward sniffle.
I don't want to sabotage the near kiss, but I feel I have to when my chest begins to clench at the thought.
''Yes, I'm great at those things'' I said as if I wasn't even sure of myself like the idiot I am.
''I don't have a boyfriend-''
''If you want to go for a walk?'' he sneers ''I don't know Carter, maybe it's to ask you, if you want to go for a walk. There's no deep meaning behind it and there's certainly nothing to convey''
''And that, stop that too'' I rush out again and she lets out a breathily laugh at me, pulling her face more towards me and pressing her forehead against mine.
''Maybe you shouldn't stay out all night'' Theo muttered still looking at Juliet in front of him.
I pick up a towel off her bathroom counter and wrap it around her body, tying it at the top.
The woman sat in at the opposite side of the table looking back at me.
I believe that could possibly be something to do with the ghosts of his past.
''Fuck-ah'' he moaned pulling her into him with his arms wrapped around her back kissing her and motioning his tongue with hers, tasting that sweet taste she always held while his spurts of thick, white cum shot up into her filling her up.
His lips places pecks across my neck and nibble and bite down on my skin only making me moan more through the intense euphoria he'd given me.
Bigger than I've ever had and I think he has noticed the way my eyes widen in worry, wondering if he's going to literally tear me a part.
''Yes'' I hear him call from outside the room and I stall, dropping my hand from the handle immediately.
''I just need to let you know that before you begin. He's a nice boy really, just some trauma he hasn't quite gotten through. So if he's ever mean to you, simply ignore him. I can assure you he will never mean it. He's harmless really'' she said, her lips curling back up into somewhat of a sad smile more than anything, her eyes looking lost of hope.
''You know mother, I'm really fucking sick of having you tell me what you believe is best for me'' he hissed at her from across the table as she stood her ground, neither of them noticing that I was there still.
''Nothing'' he breathes out with a shrug looking at me ''There's literally nothing wrong with you'' he says then smiling and picking up his thumb to graze against his lip to which looks like he's trying to cover his smile ''I mean you are really annoying and bratty, but apart from that, nothing I guess''
''I won't hurt you'' I say and he looks back at me with knitted brows ''You said you had cramp, unless you were lying?'' I smirk up at him trying to lighten the mood again.
I go to reach for one of the books but he reaches his hand before me and grabs it opening it in front of him and pretending to read it which I grit my teeth at.
''You just going to lean in front of me all night?'' I ask her watching how she looks down at her hands on my thighs then back at me.
''Believe me, I have no obsession with your pathetic friend''
''I don't know. What do you want me to do?'' he asks allowing for his hand to move to my thigh and trace circles there.
She lets out a loud moan into my shoulder like music to my ears as she tries to surpress it by biting down on my skin, cumming all over my cock which was enough for me to finish.
I yank her head to the side by her chin then standing back up again and grabbing her hair behind her head with my hands.
I rip them out of his hand and begin getting changed.
''Fuck me'' she breathed out ''I want you to fuck me''
''Well, you use my name'' I manage to breath out causing him to tilt his head up to look at me with a sigh and a cheeky smile.
Footsteps come towards us to show Narcissa walking back into the dining room.
''Alright, Merlin'' I sigh and hear him chuckle soon after as I hop back off the dress to notice it's now stuck on a splintered piece of wood on the old desk and I yank the material off it, causing a tear at the bottom of my dress ''Shit''
''I mean. You could just, join me?'' She suddenly says making me suck in my cheek at her.
''Yours are warm'' he breathes out and I look up at him.
It's only now I realise I'm completely frozen as he stands there in nothing but his Grey jogging bottoms and no t-shirt with his hair laying messily with a strand dangling on his forehead. He looks like he'd just only woken up.
Narcissa sits at the end of the table as the chefs bring out the dinner today since I'm not working.
''15? Such a young age. Did you live with family?'' she asks genuinely.
When he reached the bottom of the steps and walked into the living room there she was, sat on the sofa before standing up before him. Astoria Greengrass. Her brown hair was backcombed and she wore a dark green, formal looking dress which reached to her knees as she smiled up at Draco with her hazel eyes.
No answer.
''I'm way more skilled than magic, darling'' he says beginning to push the needle and thread through the tear.
''Better'' he murmurs looking up at me and it's like our eyes are stuck on each others, that is before Astoria nudges him in the side and his eyes fly towards her with a heavy sigh.
''Try not to trip and fall for me again Carter''
She smiles wide down at me before biting at her lip.
''I don't recall you having a say'' his father hisses back at him ''You will do as you're told. Stopping being so ungrateful''
I smirk up at him biting the inside of my cheek to surpress my laughter at him.
''I'm ungrateful'' Draco mutters to himself with a sarcastic tone as he picks up the wine and downs it in quickly, placing the glass back onto the table.
''Fuck off Malfoy-''
''Draco!''
She could smell the mint from his breath through her airways, paired along with the smell of subtle, lavish cologne. She resisted the urge to pick her hand up and rest it on his shoulder. For some reason, her body urged to touch him.
''To the contrary, Mr Malfoy''
''Oh, yeah. Seems it is'' I say walking over to the sofa and sitting beside him to which he tilts his head towards me with a frown ''What? Want me to undo a couple of buttons? Lift my dress a bit higher?'' I raise a brow at him causing him to smirk and tilt his head back to the fire in front of him.
''Yes, what a stupid question'' I mutter looking to the side and I feel her place a kiss on my cheek making me instantly look back forward to her.
''Just sit on my lap'' he asserts as he continues to run his hands through my hair.
I walk into the dining room suddenly stopping still in my tracks as I see the same boy from that photograph leaning over the table. I can only see the back of his head, but his stance is more than powerful as he talks to his mother in a rather aggressive manner.
''You'll have the money put in my bank tomorrow?'' I say in disbelief once again looking at his smug face as I wrap my arms around my figure.
''Why do you think I've brought you up to my bedroom? For a chit chat?'' He mocks me making me scowl at him in disgust.
''Oh right. Would that happen to be the painting on your wall?'' I ask him and he nods down at me.
Narcissa's eyes looked like they began to tear before she looked towards me with wide eyes, picking up her hands to brush away any tears that had nearly fell and giving me a small smile ''Sorry dear was there something you needed?'' she tried her best to make herself look like she wasn't upset but you could clearly see it in her eyes.
''Are you flirting me Malfoy?'' She almost whispers with a smirk and I shoot her one straight back.
''Really Juliet? I recall there being a lot of places to walk around near that manor. Go and have some fresh air'' he tells me and I sigh over the phone to him.
''The right'' he answers with a smirk quickly staring down at me as if he's trying to win a competition of answering back.
I squint my eyes up at him ''What hand do you write with?''
''That one doesn't go there'' he stated looking at her from behind as she turned around to look at him.
"Speaking of Quidditch, are you trying out?"
"At least I'm not in Gryffindor." He mumbled.
They continued to walk through Diagon, they were just getting near Flourish and Botts, when they bumped into Hermione.
"Alright," Harry smiled.
He didn’t know how this would impact the timeline either. There was still the matter of the rat...
Hary looked like he wanted to protest, but Draco started dragging him back to where he thought the exit was, he wanted to get out of this blasted forest already, he hated it here.
"Yes, but, a question, why do you want to break into the room?"
Draco appeared to hesitate for a moment, before looking back at them.
"Oh.. do you not want to talk about it?" Anthony's face turned to one of understanding.
"The one with the broken wing!" Hermione pointed at said key, it wasn't as in rhythm as all the others were.
Draco yelled, standing up. Trelawney opened her mouth but didn't have the chance to say anything.
"Harry, mate are you alright?" Ron asked.
Dobby still looked suspicious, but spoke, "Dobby cannot say, but Harry Potter is in grave danger." Dobby started looking around,
Davies lifted up his own wand.
Potter's voice sounded far away, miles and miles away, Draco didn't care about what he was saying, he only cared about what the mirror was showing him.
, Draco, I certainly didn't expect this from you."
"Mr. Malfoy!"
"Someone's a little starstruck?" Ron teased him, and he
Draco heard a few chuckles around the room. He sent those he could see dirty looks. He didn't take well to people making fun of his friends.
Draco walked into the classroom and sat at her desk, she sat down at the other side, looking at him.
"Now, go back to your dormroom, except Mr.Malfoy, you will be staying with me."
Snape stumbled and held onto a chair, his face draining of colour.
Something changed in Draco's expression and he looked at them, "Where's my stuff?"
"I saw, myself, any my family, happy." Draco stopped at that, there was no reason to elaborate, he would let Potter come to his own conclusions, that would be best.
"Why would you care?"
The old coot better have a good explanation for this or Draco would start wishing he
It looked like a plunge into death. It had an ominous aura around it, but that didn't stop Harry.
"It says that the cry of a rooster can kill it," Hermione said. Draco nodded.
His face was paler than ever. His hair wasn't tied in his normal ponytail, instead being draped on the floor. Everything about him looked dead.
Strangely enough, Nott and a few other Slytherins that were in his year had started talking to him, it wasn't like he talked back much. He spent most of his time with Lovegood nowadays, she didn't care about the gossip that went around the school, and, of course, Tom.
"I have to do something, I'll be right back." Draco smiled at them and left the room with his trunk in hand.
"It's eleven!" He yelled, his eyes going wide and his mouth dropping open, they had missed the bloody train.
Harry collapsed. Ron's eyes widened as he caught him just in time. Harry tried his best to stay quiet but he couldn't. Ron swore under his breath and led them both out of the room. Harry saw Lockhart entering the room through his blurry vision and faintly heard him say, "What did I miss?"
Such a shame that Herbology was one of the only classes that he did have with the Gryffindors.
"Can I see that?" Draco asked.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. He didn't see how he could say no. He didn't even know what she wanted, but from the look on her face, he didn't think it was anything good. But Trelawney was always harder to read than most people. She always looked far away, like Lovegood.
1: Why the fuck did Dumbledore have a Cerberus in a school full of children?
"What are you talking about?" Weasley chimed in.
"Travelling back in time is disturbing the universe itself; maybe the universe is punishing you for travelling back here. I have to ask, Draco, why are you here?"
Draco’s face remained the same amongst the embers.
But before Trelawney could answer, Draco spoke up. "You have the Grim," Draco faced Harry.
can of worms.
Such a sad sight, he hoped the new batch of Ravenclaws would be better than these ones.
"There hasn't been a Male Veela in over a century Mr. Malfoy, you are very lucky to be presenting." Flitwick got a book from his shelf, he breathed out on it and a cloud of dust formed, it looked like a very old book.
McGonagall looked at all of them for a minute, and then, she walked away.
************
Draco was just getting ready to leave when he heard Ron scream in fear, he looked over at him and saw a red envelope in his hand.
Draco mirrored his expression. He remembered his first Hogsmeade. He still blushed from the humiliation.
Draco jumped off the bed and made his way out of the dorm, Flitwick had told him that he didn't need to bring any books, so he didn't, it felt weird not having anything on him, but he also found himself looking foward to the tutoring session. Flitwick had always been praised for his skill in dueling, and now he wanted to teach Draco how to do it, he may  have been sorted into Ravenclaw this time, but nothing could take away his hunger for power, it came with the hunger for knowledge.
"It's not attacking you, only me!" The basilisk leapt towards him once more and Harry fell to the floor, scraping his knee. If he wasn't pumped up on adrenaline, then maybe he would have felt it.
"Don't you two read?" Hermione looked at them as if they were idiots, and Draco couldn't help but feel the same way,
"Now, enough of the Dementor talk. I'm going to get you some nice chocolate cake and you can tell me what you did over the summer, hmm?" Draco started to get off the bed when he noticed Harry wince out of the corner of his eye. Draco turned back to him with a raised eyebrow.
"It looks like there's someone near
Harry didn't want to go, he'd rather stay and see why Snape wanted to keep Malfoy, but when Ron started tugging on his arm, he gave in and left, but he would definitely figure out why Snape was keeping Malfoy, he'll ask him tomorrow.
And what better way to get more data than to recreate past events?
know what it’s like to be hit by an Avada? Do
Ron calmed down a bit at that.
Rage flared once again, but this time, it was Draco's, and this time, he was in control. He looked at Harry, his eyes blazing, and opened his mouth.
"You are, you forgive everyone so quickly, I don't get it."
The door to their cabin was flung open and a cloaked figure swooped into the cabin. Immediately, he felt the effects.
." He ground out, looking at Draco, expecting him to apologize, not like that would do any good, he was going to stand his ground.
"Oh, I'm sorry, do you have your own way of saying hello, do you bow?" Mr Granger did a very sorry excuse for a curtsey.
Harry's mouth opened and then closed before opening again, "Portkey?"
"Thank you!" they both yelled at the same time. Draco shuddered to think what would happen if they teamed up with the Weasley twins. Total anarchy. Anthony and Terry spent their spare time coming up with prank ideas, ‘just in case.’ They had a whole portfolio filled with pages upon pages of pranks. Good thing they were too lazy to actually go through with them.
"But I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances to the future." Hermione was gaping open-mouthed at her now. Both angry and humiliated.
She didn't know how to describe it, but Draco felt wrong. He looked exactly the same, except for the eerie smirk on his face. Like he knew something that Hermione didn't.
He closed his mouth and decided on a neutral answer, he shrugged.
Harry looked over to see Ron lying on the floor, blood littered on his face, his wand, that he had just replaced, was on the floor in pieces. Harry's vision was starting to blur, the venom.
2: Why did he feel worried for Potter?
"Ron Weasley!"
She dropped the hair into the green sludge that was the Polyjuice potion. They had agreed that she would drink the one with Luna's hair, Ron would drink Terry's, and Harry would drink Anthony's.
"I know you are from the future, Draco." She told him, and his mouth opened, how had she known?
know Dobby?" he returned.
His vision was clouded with tears, and Harry was looking at him, mortified.
Draco winced, knowing how right Harry was, for both the past and the future.
There was an ancient language on the top of it, Draco recognized it, and his brain automatically changed it into english, The Mirror of Erised. Potter was still looking at him, all giddy, a huge smile on his face, practically jumping up and down. Draco looked in the mirror.
"But why would the people choose someone like that to be their President."
Draco decided that he liked this Potter.
Terry's eyes widened. "A courting?" he asked. Terry always did catch onto things fast.
But... the thought of being able to fly again. The exhilaration that always came with a good Quidditch match, and this time, his father wouldn't even be the reason he was doing it. It would be his own. Maybe allowing himself this little break wouldn't be so bad. Harry was asking him, after all, and how was he meant to say no when those eyes looked at him so hopefully?
There it was again, the overwhelming need to protect Draco, to make sure he was safe, at first, Harry had thought that he and Draco were just close friends, like Ron and Harry were, but he didn't feel the same way with Ron. Every time Draco complimented him, he felt something bloom in his chest, every single act of staggering genius made Harry bloom.
He wouldn't think like that. He knew he shouldn't judge others for what they couldn’t controll. It was the person that mattered, not what they were. From what he had seen and heard, Lupin was the nicest DADA professor they had had. But... he still couldn't get the image of Greyback out of his head. The way he had stood above the houself as she screamed and begged and he cackled as his teeth sunk into her jugular. When he had seen Draco watching with a look of horror and grinned evilly at him.
"Thank you, Miss Lovegood. Please, step right up." Lupin stood aside.
She winced at the thought of Draco. Guilt still overwhelmed her. She thought she could hear Draco's voice telling her otherwise: he would say that it wasn't her fault, and then blame himself for whatever had happened. She sighed. She had thought that she knew him, she had thought that she was right when she had stopped being Draco's friend.
"What do you want me to say, father? I don't know why I wasn't in Slytherin." He sighed.
"Well, come on, we have to get our books."
"He always keeps secrets from us. Disappearing at weird times of the day. Or we just find him talking with Potter and the others."
Good, no one was going to save him right now.
"My room!" Hermione shrieked.
Draco looked back at his friends and waved them goodbye, he was looking forward to next year, he knew he should be worried that his father might disown him, but he wasn't, he didn't care, if Lucius disowned him, he would figure out what to do.
Lucius bristled, looking at his only son in rage, he opened his mouth, ready to say something when Narcissa interrupted, "Lucius, darling, did you not see Draco's grades this year?" She looked at her husband sweetly.
house Severus, and Flitwick has already agreed to take away 20 points from Ravenclaw for Mr Malfoy's part in this." Snape's eyes darkened, but knowing that this was a battle that he would not win, he reluctantly nodded.
"We're going to get Harry, right?" He turned to Ron.
He jerked his wand up.
That was another thing he had noticed. He had begun to call this Potter, ‘Harry’ unlike all the last timeline. He
"Sorry Harry." Draco scrambled off his lap.
"It's on his trunk, Ron," she said slowly, as if she was speaking to a stupid child. Well, it was Weasley.
"Why do you want us to leave,
"Harry Potter." He breathed out and snatched Harry away from Draco, who didn't even have enough time to comprehend what was happening.
then." She winked at him, she knew he was going to write in his diary again, he tried to smile at her but knew how forced it looked.
"You're serious." Ron's eyes were wide.
Harry stopped in his tracks when he saw Draco standing next to Mrs Norris, the cat wasn't moving, and something was clearly wrong, given how pale his face was. Ron and Hermione stopped when they saw Draco, Hermione was looking at the cat while Ron was looking at Draco with his eyes narrowed.
"Leave." Draco pleaded with them.
Hermione exchanged a look with Ron and Harry and they left the common room, going to meet Dumbledore. This was getting out of hand; if they couldn't talk to Draco, then they would have Dumbledore do it. Maybe Dumbledore already knew, he did seem to know everything…
"Is she--" Ron cut himself off, seemingly unable to finish the sentence.
Draco nodded at her, and they all got under Harry's invisiblity cloak.
That made them both pause. "Didn't Hermione say she was going to study with Draco?" Ron asked, horror slowly creeping into his voice.
"Oh." Ron flushed but unlike all the other times, this was out of embarrassment.
No, he needed to get rid of it-
"No! I just yelled the thing at the same time you did, idiot!"
Almost everyone expected the sorting hat to yell out Slytherin, but strangely, it didn't, it was almost like the hat payed attention to what the young Malfoy was saying, even headmaster Dumbledore seemed stumped, no one knew what was going on inside the young Malfoy's head, what he was saying, but whatever he was saying, the sorting hat was definitely listening to him.
"Tea and biscuits first."
"Shhh!" Draco got up.
"Really?" Potter seemed surprised, why would he think that Draco wouldn't come along?
Some of the people that were in Charms with him, laughed, at least they weren't making fun of him, but he supposed that would stop when the news got over te school that one of the first years performed a non-verbal spell on his first try.
"Hermione?" Ron inquired.
She wanted him to keep it? Just five minutes alone with it had given him such a strong vision. What could prolonged exposure do? Was this dangerous in any way? No, it couldn't be; Professor Trelawney wouldn't give it to him if it was. Well, he always did like a challenge.
When Mom spent a bit too much money on some unknown card, he knew he should visit Miss Catalina next door.
"No, Mr Granger, actually, we curtsey, the boys normally bow like this-" Draco put his hand over his torso and bowed, "and the girls normally bow like this." Draco put his hands where the normal pureblood lady would hold her gown at her hips and bowed.
At that, he looked around again.
Hermione launched into an explanation of the charm and how it affected Dementors. And that was when Draco tuned out.
"Can we actually get this Dragon to the tower now?" Hermione asked him, Hagrid had quieted down now, but only because Hermione had told him to, he still looked like he had a lot to say.
"I got detention." She kept on mumbling over and over.
Narcissa looked at Draco in disappointment, it was clear that she disapproved of his choice in friends, but it looked like she still stood by her sentiments that having her child that far away would be too much for her to bear.
"That's cool!" Harry said gleefully, inching forward.
"Is the image really that bad?" Potter looked down, Draco didn't know what Potter had said, or why whatever Potter had seen in the mirror would cause a reaction like this from Draco, but he didn't care, Potter had asked him a question, and Draco wanted to answer.
"Remember that day we found Draco in the bathroom? When he was flushing something down the toilet?" Hermione looked Ron in the eye.
"Draco," Harry said. His glasses were crooked and his hair was mussed.
"Amazing!" Flitwick looked like he was about to explode from excitement.
Draco made a noise of disgust before quickly vanishing the horrid smelling puke on the floor and backing away. He hit something, or, someone.
say anything towards you, a Malfoy child is expected to act like a brat. I didn't want to compromise anything in case I did get into Slytherin."
It must have been a dream, he thought he had a bad one, something about a cat. Draco looked around the room and was confused when he saw that it had been rearranged and the door was open, had someone come in here while he was sleeping.
He knew some others wondered how he had gotten into Ravenclaw. He wasn't above average when it came to book smarts but he wasn't dumb either. He preferred more practical uses of knowledge because he could see how it would help him. It
"Draco, this is one of the new students, Paulene Terri."
"Yes, Sir." Davies looked like he had given up.
"If you
"Come on, Harry, let's go, we already did what Hagrid wanted us to do, we found the person drinking the Unicorn blood." Firenze winced at the Unicorn blood, Draco felt much the same way and had to steady himself while thinking about it, Unicorns were so pure and light that the mere thought of hurting one made him sick.
"There are certain things that only a Seer can know." She started.
He was so caught up in his own musings that he didn't notice Harry and Hermione and... himself? They seemed to be frozen in fear, unable to back away. He couldn’t get a good look at himself, it was if he was blurred out in a way but he seemed to be doing something.
"Nothing is wrong," she said, reading his thoughts. Wait, could she actually do that?
"Take my hand and stop looking down, you dolt!" Draco's eyes were crossing, he most likely had a concussion but he still managed to insult Harry.
But Lucius wasn't killed by magic, that would elimate any chance of him making it back, but maybe he still found a way, his paranoid mind wouldn't let him be at rest, to many things had come unexpectedly that he couldn't not think of everything.
"Bloody Nott! He ruins everything!" Terry snarled. The magic around him crackled threateningly.
"The keyword in that sentence is 'completely'."
"Look, Snape tried to kill me during the Quidditch match-" Wait, Quidditch match? Had that happened already, he hadn't known, and wait, did he just say that Snape had tried to
"Yes. It seems the vapor was more powerful than I had realized."
"He's not dead," someone drawled.
It was Draco, standing in the mirror, the older Draco. Behind him stood his parents, his mother and his father, Draco's left sleeve was rolled up, and so was his Father's, both their forearms were blank, there was nothing ingraved in them, it was just skin, no dark mark.
"What now?" Ron asked.
"I'm telling you Harry, I've searched the whole library and I can't find a single book that mentions hi-"
Potter turned towards him and whispered in his ear, slowly, Weasley's expression changed, he looked horrified. He looked back at Draco with a look of pity.
Potter's eyes widened, and he looked away almost immediately, the reaction confused him, had he said something wrong. He couldn't think of anything that he had said that would cause Potter to be.. flustered, perhaps Potter saw someone in the mirror that he desired, but he was only eleven, most likely a school boy crush, was Potter already hooked on that Chang girl.
Draco wasn't a fool. He knew that Scabbers was an Animagus. In fact, he knew exactly who Scabbers was: Peter Pettigrew.
Tom continued to compliment him every time he did even the slightest thing right, and Draco found himself growing fond of Tom, he helped him with the homework and they talked, they bantered over points that they disagreed on, and Draco soon learned that Tom was
She flinched back at the rage in his eyes.
"No it isn't! My life is ruined!"
Tom Marvolo Riddle.
. She got the book ready again when Draco's eyes snapped open.
"We don't talk about the incident. Even the whomping willow doesn't talk about the incident."
"Well, there was a bit more to it than that," Draco added at the end but Hermione was grinning while Harry was chuckling, frowning a bit at the mention of Lucius. The wound that Tom Riddle had left on all of them was still a bit fresh, but they were healing, and that was good. It was also good that Ron was finally warming up to him. It looked like he had matured a bit over the summer.
Those sessions normally ended in them bickering.
"Yes, 5 points to Ravenclaw."
"I knew we shouldn't have trusted Malfoy, his dad probably put him up to this!" Ron went on a tangent, his face getting redder by the second. Harry stopped him,
"Hurry, we have to get Draco." Harry chose to ignore Ron's words and continued down the hall. Yes, he was afraid of the basilisk, but that didn't mean he would give up on Draco.
Hermione Granger sat down in the library, silently crying.
Draco did, in fact, get a headache. And Harry, Ron, and Hermione did find him.
for thinking that it was, was that why Hermione had laughed, laughed at him?
"Oh...you want me to come with you?" Draco addressed Anthony.
"One of us has to be calm. Harry'll freak out as well if I start," Hermione whispered back, making sure Harry wasn't able to hear. Draco admitted she was probably doing the right thing and Draco should do the same thing. But he just couldn't fight the sense of foreboding that had seemed to make itself home inside him.
The whole situation had strengthened their bond overall.
Harry stood in front of the sink. He took a deep breath and spoke in parseltongue.
Flowers were often used in the first stage of courting. If someone wanted to express their love anonymously or make the courting a surprise, it was expected for them to leave a flower somewhere the person would notice immediately.
As soon as he entered Herbology, the three of them, Harry, Weasley and Hermione surrounded him. Before he had the chance to say anything, Hermione asked him,
One body lay by his feet, crumpled into a twisted position, wrists unmarked and hands far too small to be an adult’s…
"Fred."
others, it doesn't mean that
sorry for how long this took! My new niece (born on May 31st) has just fallen into my care and she got sick. I've been dealing with her. I didn't mean to be absent for so long. Hopefully, I'll be back more often now!
"Hah! Malfoy? Like he would treat someone like you well." That made her whip around.
"Actually, Draco, I was wondering--" He hesitated again, catching Draco's attention. What could be making him this nervous? "Would you like to go--"
"Yes, Ms. Granger?" McGonagall barely finished her sentence before Hermione blurted out,
Luna didn't even look up from her magazine, but Draco caught the faintest hints of a blush. "The Lovey Doveys tell me I should."
"You crossed the line, Ron." Harry narrowed his eyes.
Wait, what had they been talking about again? Oh yes, Harry had become seeker, he should probably be happy for him.
"You? This is 100% me." He tried to imitate a hair flip.
"I give you no guarantee," Harry smiled.
Draco glanced down at the cup, instantly recognizing his leaves as an Acorn and a Club. When put together, they told of an unexpected attack in the near future. The problem was that the 'near future' was always a bit obscure in Divination. That was the problem with the whole subject; it was obscure in almost every aspect. The 'near future' could be tomorrow or a year later. Technically, it was always the near future for someone; they all had their points in time and Tessomancy almost always told of a fixed point in time. But you could never know what was a fixed point in time.
Potter, but he had come to regret that, and even then he hadn't felt such rage towards him. He had wanted Potter to hurt... but now… he wanted to
"Young master will protect Harry Potter?" Dobby's eyes were clouded with suspicion.
"Password?" The Fat Lady asked in a regal voice.
"Mr. Malfoy! If you could step right up?" Lupin waved towards him.
"Good job with the chess match." Ron preened under the praise and did a little mock bow, laughing.
"We're here!" Luna smiled, looking at the air. It probably wasn't the air, maybe another creature she could see. Draco would have to ask her about that later. Her creatures always fascinated him.
"Young master must stop Harry Potter from going back to school!" Dobby whispered sharply.
"Amazing! I have never met a student, in all my thirty years of teaching, met such a young student who was able to preform a non-verbal spell so easily and on his first try, 50 points to Ravenclaw!"
Draco swallowed, he was just a tad bit afraid, even though he had thought of every scenario and had thought of every appropriate response to it, but he was still nervous, his mind was just like that, starters like
Draco waited until he saw that Seamus was gone. When he was, he closed the door to the room and immediately launched himself towards Hermione's corner, tearing her pillows apart, pulling out drawers, looking in her cupboard and ripping her curtains.
"No!" He heard Tom yell, but it was no use. Harry was closer to whatever it was.
“Hermione!" Ron and Harry rushed up to a frazzled looking Hermione. She had just burst into the Gryffindor common room.
"Than you better change your expectations."
Potter and Weasley both looked like they didn't understand, the truth was that he had arrived here at the worst time, right when his name was called to be sorted. But he supposed he could bullshit his way through this conversation.
I'm not sorry, I love a good bit of Angst, and this year will be full of it.
Draco watched as Weaselbee tugged Potter away, why did Potter help him, oh if only the other Potter could see this, he would drop dead on the spot.
"All good things I hope." Draco glanced at Ron, he really didn't know what he had told them, but at least he hadn't been kicked out...yet.
"Myrtle, please tell me where it is..."
"Hey! Don't think like that. I'm sure whoever sent you this just fell in love with your sarcastic personality. I mean, what's not to love?"
"Stupefy and Protego." Draco looked down, creating the illusion of a scared child.
The dread was still there, but it was bearable, he looked over at Harry and saw him clutching his scar, his eyes wide, something was wrong, something about that
"Oh, I was just looking for some flesh-eating slug repellent," Hagrid said sheepishly.
"No, you said it yourself, Ron, Draco's smarter than Hermione!" That caught Hermione's attention, as she stopped what she was doing and faced Ron.
"But it's impossible!" Ron started. Draco sighed, they were going to get into an argument. He rolled his eyes and turned his attention to Harry who was looking off into the distance. The Dementor attack had left them shaken.
"A week ago, there was an attack on Paulene's village. Blood purists. The majority of Paulene's village is muggle-born and the headmaster at the school there was too." Luna answered for her.
Maybe this Severus wasn't all that different.
Harry put his arms around Draco and rested his head on Draco's hair which was tied up in a ponytail, it was
Was that what Potter was on about that day, he hadn't been listening, he was too busy with his prophesy work.
A strange warmth filled his chest, he always did like when Harry complemented him, but for some reason, his heart sped up when Harry did it, it didn't speed up for anyone else, just Harry, maybe he had a heart condition.
Opening his eyes, he saw the goo on his arm and knew that he had been bit, but looking at the basilisk, he knew that it was dead. Or, at least, close to being dead. The sword was lodged right between its eyes. There was no way it would survive that.
"Because you're crying and, I'm a nice person?" He tilted his head to the left a bit.
His friends were acting weird. Anthony, Terry, and Luna were all giving each other small glances. They were brief but Draco felt like he was missing something. Something important.
Draco yawned; he had had trouble sleeping yesterday. He couldn't help but feel like he was forgetting something. Something important. His memories of the past timeline were a bit harder to access now for some reason. And he hadn't really been privy to the Golden Trio's secrets before, so what he knew was mostly limited to the gossip that went around Hogwarts from time to time and the Daily Prophet.
Draco racked his brain, he couldn't contact him any other way besides owl, Lucius was monitoring him like a hawk and Draco was, for lack of a better word, grounded, he couldn't leave the manor, he couldn't firecall anyone, so that meant that he couldn't firecall the Weasley's, Merlin knows what Lucius would do if he found a Weasley in his fireplace, Draco was already in enough trouble.
"Nott." Draco nodded, he knew Nott would feed off of mean comments, all the more reason not to say any. Being nice to someone when they're being mean to you confuses them, it's much harder to be mean to a nice person unless you're a cruel bastard, and Draco knew that Nott wasn't.
Now he was getting worried; Terry was acting shy, even awkward. That wasn’t like him.
"Eureka!" Draco yelled, and then slapped a hand on his mouth, he couldn't help it, he yelled it out when he got excited, it was an embarassing thing to do, but he just couldn't help it.
This one was different from all the other snippets he had gotten from the stars, this was accompained by some memories, memories that weren't his own, they weren't even like memories, they were more similar to flashes of places and things.
That had always just been a part of Anthony's life. The knowledge that the authorities wouldn't do anything. His parents had tried to keep him away from these types of things. But it was hard when he heard them talking over the phone about the kid they had failed to keep away from the arseholes who were their parents.
" She hissed, and Weasley recoiled, letting go of Harry's arm.
Draco could only mourn the fact that he hadn't paid that much attention to Pettigrew in the old timeline. Most of what he heard of Pettigrew from his father and a few scattered rumours were only about his cowardice and how he was a filthy half-blood. Tolerated, but nowhere near accepted. No one had mourned his death.
"We must be getting close!" Ron smiled, but Draco looked behind him and all the colour drained out of his face as he saw the Hogwarts express right behind them.
- the name Firenze flashed in his head, a small vision, his name must be Firenze, Firenze started walking over to Draco, fascination in his eyes.
*******************
"I see." Dumbledore's voice broke his thoughts.
But it's abnormal-
And then, Tom was no more.
"Um, we're going to break into a room." Draco halted.
"Darn, that means we won't see you for the rest of the day, " Terry whined dramatically.
Fuck.
Harry had grabbed his arm, and was taking a bit of time to let go, Draco tugged his arm a bit, and he let go immediately, looking apologetic.
"You're both brilliant!" Harry hugged Draco and Ron made an offended sound.
"To Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage." Draco zoned out, not wanting to listen to something that he had heard before, he only paid attention when he heard his name again.
The new Ravenclaw got off his stool and made his way to the table, everyone was watching him, as if they expected him to start shouting and throwing a tantrum, but he didn't, instead, he sat down in his seat and politely said hello to the people around him, some even returned his greeting (the previously mentioned muggleborns).
Draco cried out, holding his head in his hands.
"I-" He stopped, really thinking about, Draco always said that he needed to think things through.
But it was working, he had already apologized to Potter and Weasley, Potter had taken it well, Weasley, not so much.
"Malfoy?" Ron had reverted back to using Draco's surname as he looked at Draco with fear.
"Where are you going?" Harry asked.
Draco sat on his bed and opened the book, ready to write in it, but Tom beat him to it,
"Yes! He's friends with a muggle-born, what do you say to that, you said he was just like his father, would his father do that?"
*****************
Draco wasn't backing down either. "Meditate!" he yelled, "Open your Inner Eye. Ask Professor Trelawney! You're treating her like a
"Nott." Harry had packed more venom into that single word than he had ever heard before in his life. Even Nott looked slightly put off by it, but he recovered quickly.
Harry gave Draco an appreciative smile. It was small but it was the effort that counted.
The time travel had messed it up so much that the eye had taken two months to adjust, not to mention the fact that it had to adjust to an 11 year old with the power of a 22 year old Veela.
Anthony paled.
"It'll be alright, Hagrid." Anthony offered empty comfort. Luna looked over at Draco and let out a sigh.
The class didn't last for long after that and they all were excused to go to the Great Hall.
tea leaves?!" Hermione hissed.
"How long will the polyjuice take?" Harry looked at Hermione and knew that it wasn't going to be a good answer given how she looked at the floor and scratched her head.
All of their uniforms changed. The red lining changed to blue while the badge that proudly presented the Lion of Gryffindor changed to a thoughtful looking Raven. Hermione didn't know how a Raven could look thoughtful, it just...did.
"Draco." Snape said in his stern voice, Draco looked over at the man to find him looking at Draco like he didn't know who he was.
Draco already had a few plans in mind that would let Harry go to Hogsmeade without him getting in trouble, given that he knew how to conceal himself. And that should be no problem with Draco's expertise at his disposal. If anything, Draco had no desire to go back to Hogsmeade, but he would make an exception for Harry.
"Well, I... haven't thought about it."
"Draco, you're not supposed to be here." Hermione put herself between the Diary and Draco. Harry was supposed to be looking over him, making sure he didn't do anything. It was a risk keeping Draco so close to the Diary, but as long as someone was watching him, he seemed to be fine. They had a system: Gryffindors would look after Draco during the evenings, and the Ravenclaws (Luna, Anthony and Terry) would look after Draco during classes and at night.
"I heard a cat, I knew Filch was missing Mrs Norris, so I came down to see what was happening, and I saw Potter doing...
Finally, he stopped walking and Hermione stopped in her tracks when she heard him start hissing.
"You..were not meant to be here." The
"Are you trying out? For the Ravenclaw team."
"Harry!" A familiar voice yelled. Harry pulled away so fast that he bumped his head into the headboard. Draco looked over at said voice and saw Seamus Finnigan coming in with a paper.
Maybe... maybe there was hope for him after all. The thought made him giddy with happiness. Could he really steer his father away from the dark? Sure, he would never really atone for all the things he had already done. But maybe, just maybe, Draco could stop him from digging a deeper grave.
In response, Hagrid started crying harder, trying to get something out, but all they heard were sniffles and the occasional blow of the nose. They all exchanged looks. It was anyone's guess as to what would actually happen - sans Draco - but they all knew Care of Magical Creatures was already off to a bad start. Terry let out a yell, while Anthony walked over to Hagrid and wrapped his arms around the bigger man -- or tried to.
But you don't--
Draco shot Harry one last glare before going to get onto the train. He didn't have to look behind him to know Harry was following closely. He stopped at times when some hero-worshipping first years came up to him, but other than that stayed behind Draco.
Dobby was the elf that had disappeared in Draco's second year, all he knew about him was that he had something to do with Harry Potter, and Lucius had been furious when Draco had come back from school, Draco hadn't noticed the elf was gone until Narcissa had mentioned it.
"I don't think it looks like a Grim," she started.
"Harry Potter." The Centaur's voice brought him back, they both spun around to look at their savior (the irony of the savior being saved was not lost on him).
Draco was afraid.
"Mr. Malfoy, so you have decided to grace us with your presence." McGongall said as Draco entered her classroom late.
"Harry?" he asked.
"I don't recall seeing Mr Potter at the feast today, I know that Mr Malfoy was in his dorm, so he is telling the truth, Mr Potter, the question is-" Snape loomed over him, "- are
"The what?" said Harry, looking between Draco and Trelawney with an expression that was both confused and worried.
"You were thinking something about yourself that was absolutely wrong. Trust me, whatever pent-up feelings you got for whatever reason don't matter here," Terry smiled. But soon, his expression melted away into something more serious.
"I was around people who would report me to my father if I
That blasted diary.
But now, he needed to go back to studying, it was almost curfew after all.
They both said at the same time, Draco struggled but was plopped into Harry's lap nonetheless, the other didn't look happy with this, given how red his face was.
Inside the stall, Ron's hair darkened from its normal fiery red to a light brown, his freckles disappeared but his eye colour stayed the same.
"Harry!" Hermione and Ron followed him down the corridor, he started running down, because he knew that something was wrong, he could feel it, he just didn't know what.
"No," Draco said briefly and Nott stopped laughing, looking at Draco with a confused expression, Draco knew what it meant, he knew that Nott was wondering why Draco wasn't being mean to him, and that was exactly what he wanted him to think.
"Why do you think that only certain visions are spoken out loud, in places where others are? Because the universe wants them to know. Other things are left to the Seer, for them to figure out, that is when they must look to their Seer brethren for help, it is the Seer's secret, you will not be able to tell those who do not have the sight what you see unless it has been spoken out loud."
"Professor Snape, I know for a fact that Mr Potter and his friends were at Sir Nicholas' deathday party today." Professor McGonagall chimed in, and Snape looked at her, furious, his one chance at getting Potter expelled was gone.
"Hermione?" Ron questioned next to him.
"And to prove how generous of a man I am, I am giving Mr Potter my whole collection of autobiographies..for free." He took a dramatic pause in between and Draco rolled his eyes as he dropped the books in Harry's arms, who still looked confused as he made his way back to them.
"You both fainted," Ron started.
"You wound me! Betrayal! By my own friend!" he wailed. The Ravenclaws around them rolled their eyes in fond exasperation. It was often joked that Terry belonged in Gryffindor with Fred and George Weasley, but everyone knew his drive for learning new things was that of a Ravenclaw. Terry himself often mentioned how the Hat had said that he was a perfect combination between a Gryffindor and a Ravenclaw. It was less mentioning and more bragging.
*****************
Draco was about to say something when Patil spoke up for him.
"Sorry." Why would-
"Draco, are you alright?" Luna asked from beside him.
"Alright, we're already kinda late, we need to go now." Harry hopped off of the armchair he was sitting in.
"No, I'm sorry, but please try to understand, you do know my father, right?"
"That's what I said, Hagrid, nice to know that you actually take my word seriously." Draco nodded at them, impressed, he had figured out that it was Quirell, and he was glad that they were actually caring about what he said.
creepily towards Draco, it counts for something later on in the story, don't worry.
Hermione tried to stop him. "Draco!" she called out, but he didn't listen to her; he just kept on running.
He fell on top of Harry; scratch the part about being okay. They both groaned in pain but Harry knew that Ron couldn't possibly be as hurt as he was. He had a human pillow to cushion his landing after all.
"Right you are, Malfoy," she said in a curious tone.
"Is that rose for someone?" Terry asked, walking over to get a good look at it.
"No..?" Harry asked slowly, was he supposed to?
"Speaking of," Luna chimed in, finally looking up from her copy of the Quibbler, "Hogsmeade weekend is coming up soon. Would you like to go with us, Draco?" She took a sip of her pumpkin juice before staring at something above Harry's head. Probably more of those Lovey Doveys she had been talking about.
Everything he had done was for nothing. He could never deny who he really was, just a failure. Someone who was destined to be an enemy of a savior. The prophecy itself had, the one that Draco himself had foretold labeled himself as nothing more but a foe, someone who needed to be defeated.
"A Veela? But that's not possible, Veela's are more commonly seen in females, and even then they're rare, most Veela's today only have 1/4 of the gene-" McGonagall lifted up her hand with a slightly impressed look on her face, maybe Draco shouldn't had spat out that bit of knowledge, but he couldn't help himself.
''Dinner's ready'' she says with a smile as I smile back awkwardly.
''Forgive me Madame. I just wondered what you'd like me to do'' I say in a quiet tone through the awkward atmosphere circulating the room as I looked at Draco then back at his Mrs Malfoy.
So he does think I'm filthy? Only useful for my body.
''Great. So I'll have your room ready for you in around 2 hours then?'' she asked lifting herself from her chair which I did straight after ''I'm sure you'll be able to grab your things by then? Unless you need help?''
I lay her down on her bed which thankfully already have the covers lifted for her to get underneath it and I pull the covers over her.
I could have asked her to come into my room, read to her maybe?
Leaving Juliet feeling even less of herself than she had done before.
''Well where does it go?'' she huffed feeling quite frustrated with the boy who seemed to be smirking humorously behind her.
''Better?'' I ask trying to hide my smile.
I pick up the pace, fucking into her mouth vigorously.
_____________
He's acting strange. I don't know whether to run out the door or accept his offer.
''Stop following me everywhere'' I snap at him and he chuckles at me.
Only a little bit perfect.
Draco, Narcissa and Astoria all sat around the dinner table as I stood at the side of the room with my hands placed in front of me, awaiting to be called upon if needed.
''No more cramp then?'' I smirk and he looks at me with a smile that is too wide to hide ''Ha, got that smile I wanted''
''I flirt with everyone. Don't feel too special darling''
''Kiss me then darling'' I whisper and just when she goes to lean forward into my lips I turn my head with a chuckle.
''Yes'' I say clearly for him to hear and he nods with a smile behind me.
''You'll give me a massage?'' I squint at him and he nods seriously with no sign of humour on his face.
''You're a maid-''
''Good'' he whispers more to himself looking to the side of the room and moving his tongue on the inside of his cheek which causes my stomach to do flips just watching him.
His hand dips into my panties stroking up my slit to reach my clit and begin circling there in smooth actions as he looks back up into my eyes watching me suck on my bottom lip and moan softly through the feel of his fingers working me.
He shakes his head at me biting the inside of his cheek as he stays leant against the door.
He grabs my chin harshly pulling my head up to look at him as he looks into my eyes with a scowl. I swallow harshly at his hold on me, wishing him just to leave me be. His eyes glare down my body then back up to my face in one swift movement then tilting his head to look me deep in the eyes with a squint to his.
I hadn't woke up the greatest this morning. Besides feeling groggy and still exhausted from staying up until 3am reading, my mind just flicked towards my parents with no warning. That happens sometimes. Sometimes I'll be just sitting there, getting on with whatever I'm doing contently without any trouble and then it'll hit me.
It was silent at dinner times mostly, with the exception of Lucius saying,
His emerald green, silk sheets lay upon the bed neatly in the centre of the room. It's dark in here but he has warm golden lights that surround the whole room making it a lot more appealing to step into. Surprisingly, it doesn't feel all that cold in here. It feels quite warm and inviting.
''Look at you'' he says lowly behind me only making me more wet at the sound of his soft, husky voice while he strokes his fingers over my ass cheek in circles ''Pathetic little slut'' he says before slapping my ass harshly and chuckling darkly afterwards when he notices me almost scream and slap my hand over my mouth.
''Why wouldn't I be ok?''
He's usually always out at around the time that I clean his room but I always knock for obvious reasons.
''Love you'' he breaths out stroking a piece of hair behind my ear.
I bring my one hand up to grip her chin and pull her head back to look at me, those blue eyes glaring down at me.
''I said I'm fine'' I snap at her through my embarrassment making her widen her eyes at me before relaxing her features again.
''Because you want some extra money'' he says as if that's the answer to my question ''Are you on the pill?'' He asks catching me off guard entirely as my eyes grow shocked at his question.
The silence begins to make me feel embarrassed again.
______________
''Really''
I groan impatiently as I yank her head to the side making her wince and I lower myself to her level picking up my other hand to grab her chin harshly to look at me.
And then Hermione yelled, "Group hug!"
"I'm sure Nott will be there." Harry scowled. He hated when Nott got to do things he couldn't.
"What--" Hermione was cut off yet again as the Gryffindors ran down from their dorms.
"Be quiet." He whispered.
Idiots, complete and utter idiots.
"Shh!" Harry shushed for what had to be the millionth time in the last five minutes.
He had been having weird interactions with Potter, it seemed that Potter couldn't get over his shyness around him, he was rather bipolar, sometimes he didn't talk at all and looked as red as a tomato, and other times, he was telling everyone about how smart Draco was.
They hadn't spoken about what Firenze had said in the forest, but he had caught Harry looking at him strangely throughout the day, but he didn't think it too out of the ordinary, Harry often looked over at Draco.
"Tell me about it, he levitated a cake over our guests and dropped it on her, and then, he made it seem like it was
It was littered with rubies that shone even in the dim light of the cavern. The blade looked just sharp enough. It was worth a try; it was better than trying to fling an
Draco followed both of them as they led him to the Headmaster's office, he didn't want to see him again, he
She had tried everything! Most of her day was spent trying to destroy the bloody thing. She worked on it so much that the Gryffindors were used to hearing her scream
Filch came running in, but when he saw Mrs Norris, he stopped. He looked at Harry in rage, "You...You killed my cat." He was shaking with rage.
"But you apologized, and he didn't accept it, that's his fault."
Terry let out a roar. "When I get my hands on that Nott, I'm gonna show him a good bat bogey hex!"
Snape narrowed his eyes, a sign that the man suspected something, he tried to get Draco to look him in the eyes, but Draco wouldn't dare, he had kept his secret for so long, he wasn't going to let a bit of mind reading stop it.
Draco was squished between Weasley and Harry and tried to squirm back to his seat, once he did, however, he heard Harry speak.
In hindsight, he should have predicted this. Gryffindors had no common sense. Look at Weasley: he was on a hospital bed as well, sleeping. He had made the unbelievably stupid decision of fighting a miniature
"Yes, it is."
________________________________
Draco was sitting with Anthony and Terry. They had been dragged into this 'duelling club' that Lockhart had started. Draco hadn't wanted to go because Lockhart had asked them to come (he liked Lockhart as much as Snape liked Harry Potter, which is to say, not at all). But when he had mentioned extra credit, Terry agreed right then and there, dragging Anthony and Draco along with him.
Dead bodies. There were dead bodies everywhere. Faceless dead bodies— and the scene in the room had changed. There was no longer a classroom in front of him, but a battlefield. A battlefield that showed the story of something terrible. And all Draco could think was that he had
Draco paled even more at that, and Hermione swore she could see his organs through his skin.
***********************
Albus spoke word for word, his memory was impeccable.
"Draco," he heard someone call. He looked over, expecting to see Trelawney or someone but instead, he saw... Harry?
"Hmm, Mr.Malfoy, can you tell me what happened?" Snape turned around to face Malfoy, who was purposely avoiding eye contact.
"...Harry?" Draco's voice sounded so much smaller now. When Harry let him out of the hug, tears were streaming down Draco's face. Harry faltered.
"Enough!" Hagrid interrupted them, "Let's get you both to Diagon." Hagrid led them both up the stairs, exiting Knockturn.
nice.
**********
The subject of 'reality' didn't really apply to the art of Divination. The normal muggle could have their perception of reality changed with a simple charm or a deflection spell. But... there were cases where a muggle could break through these spells. It was always the younger muggles, who were more inclined to believe in magic and had the willpower to deflect the magic. The younger muggles who were so in touch with their imagination that they could convince themselves that the voice telling them to 'leave this place' or the need to be ‘somewhere else' was wrong, that they needed to be
"My family is not, happy, often." Draco looked away, that was a lie, at least for this year, their family was a happy one, at least until fourth year, that was when everything went downhill, but Potter didn't need to know that.
Did this person give him a blue flower just because he was a Ravenclaw? No, they wouldn't put this much work into making it look nice and then make such an obvious move.
They crept over to the office. The door was just slightly open, just enough for them to creep through.
"No! Why would I know who your father is?" He seemed both shocked and horrified at the idea of her not knowing who her father was.
they got Harry in the car, the man fell down into some bushes and he could hear screaming behind them, he couldn't resist saying just one more thing,
Harry shrugged his hand off playfully. "I have to go, I promised Hermione I'd meet up with her at the library." He groaned.
"What
"Hermione, it's okay."
She smiled and nodded, and with that, he left the room, keeping in mind the new rules that came with being a Seer.
But that didn't stop her from asking one question.
"What are you doing!" He hissed at the twin who was lifting him up.
"Don't be silly, Ron, he's not blu--" Hermione cut herself off when she saw his expression.
"Draco!" Hermione yelled, the troll swung his club at her again.

happen again. There were lives at stake, he couldn't afford to let his heart get in the way of his brain.
*************************
Ron yelled and Harry looked up just in time to see Ron coming straight down towards him.
"You're asking that now?" Draco asked incredulously.
The mere thought of being free ripped another sob from him, and once it started, he couldn't stop.
"I can't tell you." Draco looked away.
"And you got a warning for accidental magic! You want to use more?! Are you insane? No! Don't answer that, I already know the answer."  Draco slapped a hand on his forehead.
"You have to get permission from his parents," Hermione said, rubbing the back of her neck.
Draco's eyes rolled to the back of his head when one last vision bombarded him, Quirrel, desperately fighting to fend Voldemort off, but he could only fight for a moment before he was controlled by Voldemort, he didn't have any say in what he could do, he couldn't even go to the bathroom by himself.
"What worked, Professor?" he asked absentmindedly, his mind still on that... daydream? No, it was obviously a vision. But they had never been so clear before, or so long. They were normally hazy little flashes or odd signs here and there. At first, he wasn't even able to tell the difference between this 'vision' and reality. If these things were going to continue he would have to figure out a way to tell the difference between the two--
If anything, he should be worried about Granger, but no, he was worried about Potter, because he knew his track record, absolutely no self-preservation this one.
"Anything really." Draco just wanted to make conversation with her.
Of course, this hadn't caused the desired effect Draco had wanted.
"Have you thought of courting him?" Hermione whispered.
"Um, I've got to go." Draco bolted out of the bathroom.
Draco's head collided with the top of the car and he saw stars, he only briefly caught a glimpse of Harry opening his door,
"Class is dismissed. Mr. Malfoy, stay behind please." Lupin spoke in the strictest voice Draco had heard him use.
He looked over his shoulder and almost sobbed in relief when he saw the Diary was gone.
*******************************
Hermione looked over at the door, " You put the key in the door to unlock it, Harry." Hermione snickered, apparently, Harry hadn't noticed the big, and locked door. Harry looked over at the door and sighed, walking over to the broom.
Why did no one like her? She did what her mom said to do, she tried to help them, but they were all annoyed at her, especially that Ronald Weasley.
"Make sure he drinks these, and he gets lots of rest, I am putting you in charge of his health, if anything happens to him, you will be held accountable!" Snape held a finger in front of them.
Draco had read up on Muggle culture, and a 'President' seemed close enough to a Minister.
Before he could write more, the words were sucked into the page and new writing took its place, it was fancier than Draco's,
" He yelled, a sheild appeared around Hermione.
They had been hanging out more frequently lately, studying together, where Draco desperately tried to teach Potter how to do the simplest of potions, and he did, of course, fail at that, but he was determined to teach Potter how to pay attention in potions.
He hated it, he hated it, he
Hermione finally turned to face them. She had bunny ears sticking out of her head, and her nose had become much smaller; whiskers were sprouting out of her cheeks and her whole face was covered in white fur. She looked a tad bit like Luna, blonde hair and silvery eyes, but you could only see it when you got past the fact that she looked like a bunny.
"Petrificus Totalus!" she yelled, and was surprised when her voice came out clear despite the fear that was engulfing her.
He had lungs like his mother.
***************************************
It whispered in its sickly hoarse voice.
"The blue rose, a flower of the genus Rosa and family Rosaceae, symbolizes hope for an unlikely or unrequited falling in love. In this way, it can also signal someone waiting for a miracle. In short, it means falling in love..."
But he had occasionally seen the same light in the most intelligent of Ravenclaws.
"Where did you even get a Dragon Egg, Hagrid?" He asked the half-giant in shock, they were illegal here, but that didn't bother him, what bothered him was that Hagrid's house was built out of wood, and fire and wood didn't exactly combine well, he had grown to actually like the half-giant and his horrible baking skills, he didn't want to see him standing outside his burning house one day, weeping.
Hermione sniffed and wiped her nose with her sleeve. "Yeah. Okay, step one, we have to talk to Draco--"
"And Moaning Myrtle told us about yellow eyes," Harry chimed in, looking happy.
When he looked back at the flower, he saw a whole array of different colors. Red, yellow, and blue vapors now swirled around alongside the green. Now he knew what Professor Trelawney meant.
"Hello," Draco greeted as he walked over. Paulene - if he remembered correctly - waved back.
"I'm so sorry, you two," she said.
"We'll go into the chamber tonight." Their eyes widened.
But right before she left, she turned back and gave him another smile. "Visit me on Sundays, child. They are the best for your lessons."
************
"Thank you, I really needed that."
Speaking of Veela, Draco had decided that he wasn't going to take his suppressants anymore, they always made him feel horrible, like he was locking away a part of himself, like he was shaving off all of his hair and tucking it away in a drawer and putting a lock on it, it made him feel bare, naked, and he hated it.
," someone sing-songed at the doorway. Draco looked over to see Terry walking in with a big smile on his face.
And the world went dark.
"We need to tell McGonagall." Was the first thing he heard, it was Hermione's voice.
"Why are you here?" Draco rasped, and oh, his voice sounded horrible. That was Draco's voice, but he sounded like a Kneazle who had just coughed up a hairball.
"I've told you everything that I know, may I leave now?" Dumbledore nodded and Draco got up, making his way to the door.
//>” these kinds of things”
?" Draco asked.
"Yeah, you've seen how fast his hair grows. That's not normal and we've never seen him take a hair growth potion. And if you look at him from the right angle, he seems to glow. Definitely not fully Veela though, he doesn't show all the traits. But the Malfoy's are known for how many magical gifts they've had in their bloodline. Like Veelas and Seers. Seers are more of a Black family trait though, so I don't think Draco is one," Hermione started.
"Harry Potter." The older man didn't turn around, instead, he kept on looking in the mirror.
"Goodmorning, Mrs Weasley." Harry greeted her, and Draco echoed him.
"Harry, Draco, we had hoped that you'd only gone one grate too far." Molly wrapped them both in a hug.
She looked around pointedly. "I think that we should talk about this in private. Unless you want a man with a purple hat finding out your secret in 7 minutes." She said the last part in a daze.
"Draco, I know yer father probably took yeh ter as a kid, but I'm here to tell yeh that it's not right, you shouldn't be mingling with those folk." Hagrid faced him and gave him a whole speech, his arms crossed.
Alright, big Author's note here, it is
He swung the sword at the basilisk, just grazing the its head. It wasn't strong enough though, it wasn't deep enough. He needed to cut it deeper, he needed to get a direct hit in. He couldn't do that when he was just seconds away from slipping from this statue.
It had the Malfoy seal on it, it was the letter that Draco had just sent out.
What was a group hug-
Anthony and Terry shared a look. Terry seemed ready to speak up, but Luna beat him to it.
It was like a beast; an uncontrollable beast. Sometimes it slept peacefully, and other times, completely random times, it woke up and ripped apart everything around it.
"I have to show you something." Draco was fully awake now, if a bit groggy. What did Potter need to show him?
Before he knew it, Halloween came around, and he wasn't going to attend the feast, he would rather be in his room, reading and talking to Tom, nowadays, he didn't even need to write, he could just talk to Tom, and read what Tom wrote back.
"He asked me to," Dumbledore said... bluntly. That was weird. If there was one thing the old bastard wasn't, it was
Just so you guys know, I've found an amazing Beta, so I'll be revising some of earlier chapters. Chapters may take longer to come out, but that does give me ample time to write further chapters.
Harry didn’t even look his way.
"Bookkeeper." Yet again, the Eagle gave him a
"You seemed rather amused during that conversation, I would have expected you to start yelling at Davies and his companions."
"A seer." Minerva breathed out.
Ron and Harry looked at her, urging her to continue.
Severus gave Draco a once over. Pausing for an agonizingly long time.
Luna, apparently, was also joining in on this plan. Draco honestly didn't mind. She had given him quite a few new ideas. Who knew Luna had such knowledge of the castle! Draco only knew of a few hidden passages here and there but Luna knew all the ins and outs.
"Do we have any volunteers?" Lupin asked.
Speaking of Potter, one of the younger Ravenclaws had let him into the common room when they found him puzzling over the answer to one of the Eagle's riddles.
"Yes, what are you doing, Potter?" Davies and Malfoy said at the same time, causing them to look at each other in disgust.
They started walking down the hallway, getting a few looks along the way, but Draco was used to it, Potter must have been as well, but he looked rather shy, he must not like the attention, as for Weasley, he didn't even seem to notice it.
Hermione nodded. She hadn't expected much from Dumbledore, she knew he spoke in riddles. Normally Hermione had a fun time trying to decode them, but right now she really just needed someone to tell her what to do. She didn't want to mess anything up anymore.
I walk back over to her slowly looking over her figure ''What do you want me to do then?'' I ask her before standing in front of her and untucking her shirt from her skirt for her.
''You're jacket isn't even-''
''You're just, interesting''
''Your face is nice too'' I say and she huffs at me.
''Yeah, you look it'' I say sarcastically shaking my head.
''Well we should get in there then'' Draco said in a hurry before turning around and walking into the hallway where Astoria followed him only to bump into Juliet grabbing onto her waist to make sure she didn't fall.
''Do I have any redeeming qualities?'' I ask looking back into her eyes to which she looks around the room with a pout as if she's thinking hard.
My chest tightens at his words, not knowing what to do with myself. I'd had this before, from drunken men in a restaurant when I was a waitress, but this was different. Draco was ten times more assertive and seemed to be even more aggressive.
She makes me forget every bad thing going on in my life. The arranged marriage and the whole death eater shit that still haunts me on the daily.
She understood this and shot Theo back a seductive smile.
''Because-'' I look down into her eyes, my jaw tensing at the sight of her ''I don't want everything else that comes with it''
''Stop. Fucking. Teasing'' I say harshly to her and she brings her face close to mine.
''I can't thank you enough dear'' she says guiding me to sit next to Draco at the table as he sits there playing with his rings.
And what the hell was that, that thing I did out there to her? 'Goodnight'
'' You stole my seat'' she smirks and I resist a chuckle at her.
''Go lean against the wall. Can you do that? Or are you incapable?'' he asks and I shake my head ''Words Juliet, fuck sake-''
His father's face drops as soon as Draco says that.
He was right.
''What did you do?'' he asks smoothly.
Draco didn't look at me once as he sat next to the brown haired girl at the dinner table drinking along with her and his mother. His face still looked sour, as if he didn't want to be there.
''I will'' she smirked making the boy in front of her smile and shake his head.
''For?''
His hair colour was like his fathers, icy blonde and swept to the side neatly. His skin was fair and pale and his jaw looked enough to cut through skin. He looked handsome. Incredibly handsome as he sat there in a black suit. His eyes shone far and beyond through the picture striking me straight away with how blue they were, almost like the Bahama waters. He could have seemed kind, like someone you'd be enticed into straight away just with those eyes, however, his expression said different. There was a coldness to him which radiated through the picture, a coldness which set goosebumps onto my skin as I stared at him as if he was actually here right now in front of me.
I roll my eyes and start to walk upstairs to which he rushes after me now walking beside me.
He shakes his head looking deeply into my eyes ''Lucky you'' he whispers.
I look back in front of me taking my eyes off him. I can't be looking at him like that.
''Do I at least get a kiss before you go?'' he asks with a cheeky smile and I rase my eye brows at him as he comes more forward to me ''For your best friend?''
''You must act quickly Draco, she won't wait around for you'' Lucius says sternly and Draco shakes his head facing down into the table ''What now boy?-''
''Just came to see if you were ok'' I ask her and she grows even more confused at me.
''Ok'' I breathe out ''Enjoy the rest of your day'' I mutter before walking back up to the manor, taking a glance behind me to see him greeting Astoria and walking her up the gardens where we just were.
He picks up his hand and scratches his head before slowly lowering it back down hesitantly. He looks at me again then reaching his hand out to place into mine gently. His hand lifts a touch as soon as he touches my palm with one of his fingertips, but it soon rests all the way into mine. He's tense, but he still allows himself to give into me.
''Sleep El, I'll get you some water'' Juliet said lifting Elara's head off her lap gently and letting her lie back down onto her pillow.
I look at him and pick my hand up to shove his out of my face making him chuckle at me and sit up straight in his seat.
I open my door and knock on hers awaiting her to hopefully open it for me.
''Quite the flirt aren't you Malfoy?''
Draco never spoke to me, obviously. If I was in the room he'd simply walk back out or if I had walked into the room he was in to clean he would just ignore me, most of the time he read a book or drank. It was all he ever seemed to do after 2 weeks of observing him.
I stand outside his door wondering what mood he could have changed to now before knocking three times.
''Where have you been?'' he asks, puffing out the smoke into my direction which I roll my eyes at and grab the door handle.
I'm just a slut who was actually going to take money for having sex with someone.
''Loves yas'' I say more tiredly than usual due to the platinum prick in front of me.
''No'' Draco simply replies tensing his jaw with his hands placed firmly in his lap.
''Exactly. That's exactly why I'm so confused to why you interest me so much'' he whispers making me tense as his hand wraps around my waist and pulls me back a little more to rest against his chest.
He quickly twirls me around so my back is rested against his chest then grabbing my hair harshly and pulling my head to the side making me wince from the sudden pain.
I visited Theo and Elara this morning since I had the day off. It was nice being able to be around my two best friends for a few hours since I don't have much proper, amiable company back at the manor.
''Do friends fuck?'' he asks rather calmly considering the way he clenches his hands behind him on the desk right now.
This has no right turning me on this much. The vulgar words that came out of those pale pink lips of his were so elegant in my ears, clouding every bit of sense I had.
''Because you keep following me like a lost puppy-''
''Girls gotta have fun. Stop being so moody'' Elara murmured into Juliet's lap.
''You said my face was nice so what do you want me to say to you-''
''Yeah'' I rush out with a frown and a tut ''Obviously''
I go to turn around and make my way somewhere else but he opens the door and leans against the doorway looking at me.
''Like I said I'm bored and I really don't want to be left alone with my thoughts today. So can you just walk the grounds with me?'' he asks and when I don't answer him he huffs soon after ''Fine'' he mutters walking towards the door and opening it to walk out into the hallway.
I close my eyes and shake my head to the side to look away from him. Why open your door with no shirt on? It's incredibly unfair.
''You're beautiful. Better?'' I ask with a smirk and I notice her lips curl up slightly, no matter how much she tries to hide it.
They truly were just very boring.
''Look at me'' he whispered more gently than she thought was possible of him to do.
''Get back to it then, I'd hate to distract you'' he says with his book now open in front of him, not giving her the slightest glance.
She stands straight away in front of me making me smirk.
''Who?''
''Never said that'' he mutters keeping his eyes anywhere but on me.
''You do a lot of staring, don't you Malfoy?'' I smirk at him and he shuffles closer to me and places his hand on my cheek letting it then drop to my neck and I can't tell you the amount of butterflies I feel right now ''What?'' I manage to breathe out.
I nod once ''I'm sure I'll be fine'' I smile and she steps away from me looking pleased with my answer.
''I hate you too darling'' I moan back feeling myself about to reach my high ''So fucking much''
''Fine, I won't pay you. Make you feel better?'' he asks with a rise to his brow and I bow my head to the floor ''Oh darling don't be ashamed'' he says lifting himself back up on the bed to sit up and look at me ''It won't happen again, don't worry. You don't have to feel like you're a dirty floozy, no matter how much we're both thinking it'' he says with a vile expression on his face, as if he's laughing at me from the inside.
''You get on my nerves a lot'' I mutter and he smiles down at me again.
''Lured you in? Oh you can actually go fuck yourself'' I almost shout at him before huffing and turning around to sit back on the desk ''So you not letting me out then?''
''So how?'' I ask then sighing and softening my features ''Did you want to talk about it?'' I ask trying to be a little more calm.
''Blaise and Pansy''
His back was still turned as he leant back over the table with both hands placed flat on the wood with a huff.
''Is this a hobby of yours?'' she snaps at me making me turn back towards her with a confused expression.
''I can't sleep'' I say and she lifts a brow at me leaning her side against the door frame.
''Yeah, I need to as well'' I say with a smirk ''so I should definitely go''
A maid. How low of him.
She would take hit after hit, but she would not allow for him to treat her as though she was some object he could toy around with.
''No'' I snap at him and throw his hand off me ''Stop touching me''
He lets out a breathily chuckle then leaning against the wall in the hallway as I hang my jacket up.
Astoria had now finally left allowing me to relax a little more as it was now coming near 6 which would be the end of my shift for the day.
Why am I get so annoyed that he may have forgotten my name?
''Do you understand that love?'' he asks more calmly.
He looks up at me with a devilish smirk ''It looks pretty on you'' he says making my breathing falter a little ''You should keep it there'' he whispers looking across every feature on my face.
''I said I'm not doing it'' he speaks quietly back. Like I said. Drained.
He smirks into the table licking his lips with a small hum then picking up the napkin next to him and wiping his lips with it.
I could only wish for more.
I let out a shaky breath as if I'd been holding it in the whole time.
He walks over to me looking down at me with a sigh ''I said lie down. You've already pissed me off and disobeyed me so you can stand back up'' he looks back down at me with a mean expression. A harsh swallow coming from me as I stand back up listening to his every command of me.
''T-Theo'' she stuttered through the force of his fingers inside of her before he slowed down his movements to a more moderate pace.
''What do you read?'' I ask, genuinely more interested than I had been before with him.
''Sorry, I just-I hate being touched'' he almost whispers and I pull my hand back down into my lap.
So now, she had to fend for herself which only made things more difficult. She no longer lived in the house she grew up in. She now lived with her friends Theo and Elara in a tiny flat in Wiltshire since it was all they could afford.
I've never met such a mystery of a man in my whole life. He's incredibly complex and I can't get my head around what the purpose is for him to keep coming around me the way he does. He truly confuses me.
He continued to kiss me, trailing back up from my collarbone, to my neck, then my jaw to my cheek. Kissing anywhere he had access to, anywhere my my lips.
''It's lucky this chair is big enough for your ass and mine-''
''I'd love round two, but I've just only woken up'' he says with squinted eyes as he scratches his head.
''I never said that-''
''Fuck sake'' he breathes out almost in relief ''Trying to give me a heart attack now?'' he says rather seriously making me look at him in confusion.
They were friends, best-friends in fact. However, this didn't mean they didn't enjoy some harmless fun between the two.
''It would be a terrible shame if you went to bed feeling tense'' he whispers keeping his eyes in front of him as if he's looking at the paintings along the wall, edging his hand up my skirt again and brushing my panties to the side.
''You are, infuriating'' he whispered almost into her lips.
''But-''
''Why are you being nice all of a sudden?'' I ask causing him to shrug and play with his rings.
''Apologise then'' he hits back making my eyes grow wide at the thought of apologising to this idiot towering over me as I pierce my lips shut without a word ''Apologise for being a brat Carter'' he says trailing his hand back down my stomach to my pussy and hovering over his hand over my clit with a devilish smirk.
''Fine'' he mumbles back as he looks down at it.
''Goodness, you are so full of yourself'' I chuckle and he smiles back at me with a small chuckle himself before looking at my neck with a smirk.
He was cruel, a horrible person from what I saw but then there were moments where I'd see him reading alone in the library or sat with his thoughts where he'd seem calm, collected, like every bit of cruelness in his body had disappeared until he spotted someone in his sights.
Darling. Fuck that word is too much to handle coming from his lips right now.
''Fine'' she huffed picking back up the newspaper and flicking through the pages again to find her eyes had grown wide at one of the advertisements ''Maid?'' she tilted her head back up to Theo as if she was asking if he thought it was suitable enough.
''Fuck off Malfoy'' I say before reaching the top steps and reaching my door the same time he does his.
''You dare speak anymore of that sentence'' his father snaps at him almost making me jump.
''No, not really. My friend may have mentioned your name a couple of times but, other than that, no'' I say and he scrunches his nose up at me.
''Mmm'' I hum under my breath with my lips clenched closed.
''Fuck, you're soaked'' he chuckles behind me before latching his lips to my jawline and placing kisses there to my neck.
''Like the book, yes?'' he asked biting the inside of his cheek as his eyes looked back over every inch of her body.
''What?'' I smile with a shake to my head.
''I need your help-''
He grabs his cock and lines it with my entrance, teasing me with his tip before pressing it slowly in and pulling back out again, a small moan escaping my lips at just that.
''In my friend?-''
He leans against the desk where I sit, crossing his arms again with a sigh.
'' Yes, yes I can do that'' I rush out with an annoyed sigh then walking over to the wall and placing my hands on the dark, cold wall.
I turn to him with a tired expression and a nod, my eyes following his as he comes in front of me and places his hand on my cheek, my back placed against my door.
''And you caught me, so I'm ok'' she says slowly with a frown ''So, thank you'' she gives me a forced smile before going to shut the door but I place my foot in the way of it so she can't.
''So you knew me before you came here?'' he asks with knitted brows.
''You did'' I smile and he comes more forward brushing my hair more to the side to look at it more ''You admiring it or something?''
''Fuck'' he breathed out as I stood there wondering if he meant that in a good way, or a bad way,
''Fuck you'' she snaps and I yank her hair back again and slap her ass roughly with my hand making her squeal.
''Join you? You want me join you in the shower?'' I ask quietly and she nods coming back closer to my face and brushing her nose against mine.
''Could just fix it with magic'' I say trying to fill this awkward feeling inside of me.
''I'm sorry-''
One which seemed to be the father, who had long, platinum hair which flowed to his shoulders. One seemed to be the mother, who was a beautiful women with dark hair and blonde resting underneath. Then lastly, there was a boy who sat in the middle on a leather, emerald green chair with his mother and father's hands placed on each shoulder, one who looked around my age, assuming this was Draco the boy Theo informed me about.
For some strange reason that I can't quite put my finger on, she captivates me like no one ever has before and I don't know how to act to this feeling. It confuses me more than anything. How I can be so enraptured by a maid and want to spend all my time with her.
She lifts her hand to push a strand of my hair off my forehead then places it back onto my shoulder. I can't begin to speak of much her one finger on my head just now gave me tingles throughout my whole body.
''Better than escort babe'' he smirked and she shook her head at him with a smile before looking back down at the advertisement, reading through it carefully.
''Have you now?''
He then pulls himself out of me quickly and stands up pulling me up with him and grabbing under my ass to signal me to jump. I jump up and wrap my arms around his neck as he bites down on my shoulder while pushing me against the wall.
''Hey I was just enjoying the view darling'' he chuckled with his hands up in surrender before walking over to her to tower over her like he did on her first day.
''Fuck you're too much'' he smirks letting out a groan as his thrusts become more sloppy, his cock throbbing inside of me as I moan as soon as his tip hits that one spot inside me, making me cum all over his cock as my head smacks against the wall.
I arrive back to the manor and walk down the path to the doors to see Draco standing outside against the wall smoking a cigarette.
''And you accepted'' he snaps back then picking up his hand to push back his hair ''and anyway, I believe the proper description would be a sex worker not a prostitute-''
''Stop touching you? Are you sure of that decision?'' he smirks, placing his elbow on the table and leaning over to look at the front of my face a little closer making me tilt my head away from him ''I don't think you're sure of that, are you?''
My face falters, feeling disgusted in myself for even considering to take money off him in the first place.
''Come sit down'' he says gently which was quite different to the attitude he had downstairs with his mother only minutes ago.
''What? Something wrong?''
___________
''Such a good fucking girl for me'' he smirked, allowing one of his fingers to dip into her entrance and thrust in and out softly to prepare her for his cock.
''In you'' he whispers stroking his hands down my arms from behind ''I'm so very interested in you'' he mumbles under his breath and I tilt my head up a touch unsure of what to do at that confession.
''Can you?'' I smile.
__________
Her breathing shacked at his question, wondering why he'd ask such a thing.
''I like your skirt'' he says looking down from my skirt to my legs then back up to my face.
''Yes?'' She asks with a frown and I look to the side then back at her placing a confident look onto my face to distract myself from how my body are tensed right now.
They were like one small family.
He pulls his hand up to my face pulling my face to the side to look at him as my back rests on his clothed chest. He brings his hand to my cheek to brush away a tear and looking at me with a smile.
He tilts his head back with a moan ''Ugh, say that again so I can record it'' he smirks biting his lips down at me.
I nod, then walking over to the bottle of wine on the tray and walking over to the drinks table and pushing it over to them at the end of the dining table where they all sat carrying on with their conversation.
''Well you have to son-''
He leans back over me slowly on the bed as his cock rests against my pussy ''I'll go easy on you at first, how about that?'' he says gently picking up his hand to brush a piece of hair out of my face and I nod up at him reluctantly.
''How are you and your boyfriend?'' he suddenly says making me roll my eyes.
His voice becomes a little more gentle when he says ''If you want me to stop at any point, you have to tell me loud and clear darling, ok?'' he asks and it's as if for a moment he might actually care.
He has talked. I don't believe it's in the way she had hoped though.
''Turn around'' he chuckles and I do, causing him to place his hands on my waist and opening his legs more to make space for him to pull me down to sit between his legs and move his hands up to my shoulders.
''Well?'' I ask holding the quill ready in my hand.
''Pardon?'' I say in disbelief and he rolls his eyes at me.
''Why?-''
''I was actually going to clean your room, but I'll come back later'' I mutter going to walk away again.
''I'll leave you to your shower then'' I say with a slight curl to my lips and she chuckles at me with a nod like she's unable to even speak right now.
I stroke her cheek gently ''Such a good girl'' I say before she wraps her mouth back around me and sucks on me again ''Fuck'' I moan watching how she looks up at me again with those twinkling eyes as I lick my lips down at her ''Fucking perfect''.
He lifts his head grabbing my cheek and looking down at me, my eyes to my lips then back to my eyes again. He licks his lips as he watches me.
I reach over to turn the shower off with my one hand as I hold her with my other one before helping her out of the shower and reaching down for her clothes while she holds onto the bathroom counter.
We both carry on walking until we reach a bench where he sits down and taps the seat beside him and I sit by him.
''How'd it happen? If you want to tell me'' he rushes out.
It just hit me like a ton of bricks. Just like it is again right now.
''Mmm, I'm imagining it right now'' he says and I can see his smirk in my head that he definitely wears right now ''What else do you wear?''
''Bit more'' he whispers with a small smile ''please'' he says and I smile at him with a nod, wondering why he is even being kind to me right now.
He smiles ''I bit you pretty deep'' he almost whispers as he brings his eyes up to mine, his finger stroking over the hicky he had left a week ago still on my neck.
''Mmm'' I moan with a smile licking my lips.
''So fucking tight'' I moan slamming all of my cock into her, her moans echoing thorough the bathroom walls as the water from the shower falls down on us both ''You're such a little bitch''
''You should be careful with those. They're expensive, if you understand the word'' he said in a way that he meant to put me down in as his fingers brushed against the books trying to find one he'd wanted.
He lifts his head up and pulls his fingers out of me lifting his hand up to his mouth and sucking my cum off his fingers with a humming sound at the taste, closing his eyes and tilting his head back as I watch him breathlessly.
''Are you like, a natural blonde then?'' She asks with a squint to her eyes and I frown at her in annoyance.
Her lips are soft on my skin. That really doesn't help how much I want to press mine on hers so much right now.
''What about your parents Juliet?'' she asks making me tilt my head up and hold my fork still at her question and I notice Draco does the same, with the exception of keeping his head held down ''What do they do for work?'' she smiles.
''Come here'' he says getting a needle and cotton out of the draw and placing the needle in his hand as he unravels some of the thread nodding towards me to the position in front of him.
He looks at me again with that very expression.
''It's funny'' he says and I slap my hands on my sides in annoyance ''In a good way'' he rolls his eyes then standing up straight in front of me ''Wanna go for a walk?''
''I-Hi i'm Ju-''
''Fine, I'll try''
''I just can't-''
''Dinner truly was delicious, wasn't it?'' he asks tilting his head to me with a smug smile.
''There is a bookshelf in the corner there with a range of authors if that takes your liking, but we do have a library just down the hall'' she says walking through the room to guide me through ''You have your own ensuite through this door here'' she points towards the closed door ''I thought it would be best to give you your privacy. And of course, there is a desk with writing equipment if you wish to use it and-'' she looks around the room checking to see if there is anything else she should inform me on ''I believe that is all. My room is just down the hall and Draco's is next-door to you on the left'' she says and I nod at her,
I lick my lips and wrap my arms around his neck. He lowers his lips to mine and kisses me deeply, placing his hand on the back of my head and pulling me in even more. His lips begin to move down my neck before he stops still and pulls away from me.
''You fell up the stairs-''
''What?-''
''Are you sure? You look like you're burning up-''
He looks away from me to the side, rubbing his palm with his other hand.
My hand wraps around her neck pressing her head right against the tiled wall.
He smiles back down to his hands ''I don't lie''
''Ready?'' he asks in a deep voice, like he can't wait any longer.
''I'll give you 800 for your confidence because that, really turned me on'' he smirks as I suck on my bottom lip looking at his soft lips then back into his eyes.
''Look at me'' I snap at her and her eyes flicker up to mine through her long lashes, my thrusts getting deeper.
''What do you mean?'' She breathes out as I lift her shirt over her head and throw it on the floor beside her.
He brings his one hand back down and presses his cock back into me beginning to fuck me up the wall this time. The stabbing feeling in my stomach only making me scream at the incredible feeling he gives me.
His hands curl up inside of my walls as I feel myself clenching around his slender fingers.
''Look. I don't like you or find your personality in any way appealing'' he smirks ''However, I really need to get you and my anger out of system and I love hate sex'' he bites his lip with a small sigh ''So?'' He asks ''Will you let me fuck you or not?''
''You don't want to'' she asks looking up at me kindly.
''I-I appreciate your-'' he pauses again as I write what he says ''Gift'' he says as if he's unsure of what he's even talking about.
His teeth graze against my ear ''Go lie on the bed'' he whispers before pushing me forward causing me to stumble a touch.
''And? I'm sure you can find something more interesting to bury your head in posh boy'' I say and he lets out a breathily laugh shaking his head with a smile ''What now?'' I mutter and he looks back at me.
''You are'' I whisper back.
''I asked you first'' I challenge him with my eyes only making both of us slowly smile at each other.
I began gathering the glasses and cleaning the table hearing Draco and his mother talking from the living room rather loudly. Loud enough for me to hear without any issue at all.
''Good afternoon, Greengrass-''
''Incredibly'' he smirks with a scrunched nose and I frown at him ''Only joking, calm down love'' he teases making me roll my eyes as I look back down at his hand.
''You're mad'' I breathe out through trembling breath, reaching out for the glass of wine in front of me with shaky hands and picking it up to down the liquid due to the dry throat I now suddenly have.
It had only been an hour since she sent off her application for the job by owl and she had already gotten a letter back. Theo said it's probably because no one wants the position since it was the Malfoys which only made it more the better for Juliet. This only meant she had more chance of getting the job.
''You said not to touch you anymore'' I whisper back with a smirk.
Draco just stands there with a sour expression at his mother.
''Well, we do need hosts for gatherings. So I suppose that will come in useful'' she said with her formal posture and tone ''Do you know how to do chores? Clean, make bed, cook et cetera?'' she asked.
Draco sat there drinking whisky as if he was dying to get away from the table with the only thought in my head thinking, why doesn't he?
''Good girl'' he mumbles stroking down my back with his hand ''Pick a number between one and ten''
''Yeah, I did too until year 5''
No girl has made me feel like this before. Normally it would be a one time thing and then I couldn't care less where they go or what they do, after all, I didn't really care for them. But her. She is something else. I don't like her though, I could never actually like someone, that's ridiculous.
His fingers stroked up her pussy, gathering all her wetness to begin circling her clit in gentle strokes causing her to moan with delight and a smile curling up onto her face.
She grabs my cock in her hand and begins to motion it up and down in slow pace making me groan instantly. I pull her head more forward to my erection and she licks a stripe up my cock beginning to teasingly swirl her tongue around the tip.
I knock on the door before placing my hand on the door handle about to walk in.
My breathing is still staggered all over the place and I can feel the humour on his face at me right now.
I suddenly hear a cough from behind me making me jump and turn around to see Draco standing against the closed office door with crossed arms. One of his legs crossed over the other as he stands there smirking back at me.
''I do try''
''Wait, what do you mean? You couldn't have, they went to Hogwarts'' he says adamantly and I nod slowly at him.
''Fuck'' I moan tilting my head to the side to look at his face as his face lowers to mine.
I huff and walk over to the chair at the back of the room and sit in it watching how he places the two books he had just rudely taken before me back onto their places on the shelf.
''Very sure of yourself today, aren't you Carter?'' he says with a straight face.
I don't feel jealous,
Little would she know that the thought of kissing her scares me to death, but that doesn't at all mean I don't want to. I'm dying to. I'm dying to taste those lips on mine, but I fear if I do, I'll never get enough.
''That's different Juliet-''
I let out an awkward cough under my breath.
He added another finger soon after beginning to thrust her with more force in fast motions while his thumb played with her clit. Her hand grabbed his shoulder digging her finger nails into him through his t -shirt as he fucked her with his fingers so roughly.
''If you call this nice you have low expectations'' he answers tilting his head towards me ''Who's your friend?'' he asks and I bite the inside of my cheek.
I shrug ''Good I guess. What for?''
''Theodore Nott'' she said in disbelief ''Haven't seen you in 4 years'' a smile came up on her face, her eyes seemed to be suddenly full of hope.
''Why hello there Theodore'' I say playfully over the phone to him allowing a small chuckle to come through the phone.
I tilted her head up to look at him.
He looks down at my neck with a frown then back at me.
''Hardly without tripping all over the place'' I smirk before setting her feet onto the floor and turning the shower on for her.
''Malfoy not here-''
I bite down on her neck as her head hits the wall and her hand flows to the back of my hair.
''It's good to have friends'' she smiles widely then looking at Draco ''You should invite Blaise and Pansy around one day. I'm sure they'd love Juliet-''
''Magic Theodore'' I simply say brushing my hands down his arms ''It's an incredible thing'' I smirk up at him and he nods down at me with a small smile.
''Can I touch you?'' he suddenly whispered as if he was desperate.
''No don't apologise'' he shakes his head as if he's annoyed at himself ''Touching is a little strange, that's all''
''So you got it then?'' Theo said leaning against her doorway as he watched me pack my stuff.
We ate dinner, then afterwards sat at the table for a little longer. She offered me wine and I accepted gracefully. We talked, and it was nice. She was very warm and inviting which was surprising considering the husband she has.
I want him to do everything and everything to me. Devour me and kiss my lips until they go numb.
''Stand up'' he asserts me and I stand in front of him slowly making him grab my wrist and pull me closer to him.
''Were you named after Romeo and Juliet?'' He asks with a squint to his eyes as if he's truly interested.
I walk up to him and grab the door handle but he grabs my wrist. I pull my wrist out of his hold and step back a touch.
My cheeks begin to feel flushed and drained with water and it's only now I realise it's not the shower dripping onto my skin, but the salty tears which sting the corner of my eye as they flow down my face.
''Thank you so much'' she says with a sniffle ''Have the day off tomorrow and maybe you can join us for dinner?'' she asks with a kind smile.
''I don't think so. My mother just said she liked the name so''
''And what does pretty girl mean by that?'' he asks and I shake my head at him.
''I only joke you know'' he whispers through a smirk, beginning to rub my shoulders with his large hands causing me to let out a relieved breath ''Feel good?''
''What?''
If it had been anyone else staring at me for this long I would have felt incredibly uncomfortable, probably would have just left the room. However, there's something about this incredibly handsome mans eyes on me that makes me feel privileged to have his eyes on me which is mortifying of myself to even think or enjoy.
''I told you I don't want a wife mother, I don't want to be pushed into this-''
''Draco, did you do it yet?'' Lucius asks him making me look at Draco's expression he holds.
His eyes grow wide with a smirk ''You think I want to confide in you?'' He chuckles ''that's hilarious''
''Did that hurt?'' he asks me and he couldn't sound more uncaring if he tried.
''Pretty please'' I breathe out with a moan escaping my lips.
He goes again, pushing the tip in and pushing a bit more of him in afterwards in a slow motion beginning to do gentle thrusts in and out of me as I hold onto his shoulder through the slight stretching feeling. A small groan escapes his lips.
''Where else silly?'' I smile at him hoping he will just drop this conversation.
''Well-''
''You sure?''
''What was the gift?'' I ask him still looking down at the paper.
''I'll help-''
Theo took me to the manor, helping me with my bags as we walked up to the front door to see that Narcissa had opened it before we even knocked, her eyes instantly setting on Theo's.
I slide slowly down the shower tile to the floor with the water still trickling onto my head as I pull my knees to my chest and hug them tightly with sobs coming from my mouth which I don't feel I can control.
DRACO POV
He closed the door behind him and locks it. I watch him from the middle of his room as he walks over to his desk in the corner and leans his back agains it with his palms rested on the dark wood.
''Awah I'm sorry'' I pout stroking her cheek with my hand before lowering them to her waist and spinning her around to press her chest against the tilts and pull her hair back ''Naughty girls don't get kisses, those are only for good little girls'' I smirk behind her.
It's pathetic really.
Elara's eyes were closed with a slight snore coming from her as Juliet stood up looking down at Theo. He soon rose up off the bed as she began to walk out the bedroom, which he followed after her, following her all the way to the kitchen as she leant her back against the kitchen counter staring back at him.
''What's you name?'' he asked quietly, his eyes drifting between her eyes to her lips.
''Fiancée then-''
''Get here you pathetic little bitch'' he hissed at her making her breath out in disbelief at him and shake her head.
''Why did you bring me up here and what is this extra 600 about? because I'm getting tired of sitting here while you insult me'' I scowl up at him.
He then steps a little closer to me, his chest almost touching mine.
''You're insufferable'' she sighs with a shake to her head.
''It's ok'' I assure her and she smiles back at me before going to walk away to near the living room before she stands still and slowly turns back around to look at me again.
''My friend's'' I answer, finding some calmness in the way he begins to brush his fingers now through the back of my hair making me tilt back more subconsciously.
He leans forward and brushes his nose against mine again and just when our lips are about to meet he quickly pulls away from me, taking around two steps back and running his fingers though his hair leaving me against the counter feeling weak still from his touch.
He groaned throwing his head back with a roll to his eyes, then pulling out of her and buttoning back up his trousers as she sat on the kitchen counter watching her friend with a smile.
''You can go now'' he says buttoning back up his black shirt and tucking it into his trousers.
''No'' he snaps picking his head up and stopping all movement ''No you're not'' he asserts me as if he had control over every feeling in my body.
I'm still resisting that one particular urge.
I pull my other hand up to gently massage his hand in mine, looking at his slender fingers and the veins which protrude through his skin. His hands are larger than mine. Mine look tiny compared.
''What have you done?'' I ask stepping closer to him and grabbing his hand in mine to look over it.
''Do you want to bite it instead?'' She whispers in a way that almost makes me lose myself and all rational thought.
My hips buck as his fingers vigorously begin to pound into me.
''You like it''
''Of course'' I say before reaching up again to place another kiss on his lips then letting go of him and opening the door.
He brings his teeth back to my neck and bites hard down as he fucks me, causing me to hiss at the pain as a trickle of blood drips down my neck. He licks up the blood back up to the bite mark he'd created and sucks on it more, tasting the metallic, crimson liquid.
''Can I come in?''
He sighs lifting his head out of his hands and looking at the fire in front of him.
''Fuck off'' he snaps at me looking to the side of the room which I chuckle into my lap at, fiddling with my hands and tapping my feet still ''Stop fucking tapping'' he hisses and I stop straight away trying to contain my laughter at him.
She swallowed before turning her head to look at him, afraid of what he may do if she didn't.
''Shut up'' I whisper continuing to walk up the stairs.
''You want to cum princess, hm?'' he smirks down at me almost mocking me with a pout and knitted brows and I nod quickly up at him ''Say pretty please''
''I'm sure'' I whisper looking into his blue eyes that had now turned to a pale, dusty grey shade.
''Juliet, will you join us?'' she asks and I remember her asking yesterday and I practically said yes.
''Yeah. I'll take you there though, make sure you get here safely''
''Doing what?''
''I-'' she pauses with a sigh ''Forgive me for overstepping, but I was just wondering. You and Draco are same in age and, well, maybe if you're comfortable, you could go see if he's ok?'' she asks pleading me with her eyes.
I shake my head and look back over the books to chose another one. I will not feed into his childish, idiocy today.
''I didn't sleep too much'' he says rubbing his forehead and trying to clasp his eyes open more to seem more awake.
'Tough'' I heard his mother snap harshly at him making me stand still I my movements.
Ok. I didn't know a yawn could be attractive, but ok.
''And what do you mean I lack modesty?'' I snap at him only causing him to deeply sigh at me with a sniff.
I grab the decanter and pour him some whisky then pulling the bottle away, but as soon as I do he grabs my arm before I can put it back on the table, his skin on mine shooting electricity through me.
''When did you get diagnosed?'' I ask him with a smile and he frowns at me.
I place my hand over my mouth to stop my cries and sniffles being to loud and dip my head into my knees with wet strands of hair falling in front of my face.
''That's not very kind'' he says closing the door and coming over to me where I now stand in front of the bookshelf looking over each book to pick one out trying to ignore him the best I can.
''I am actually'' I lie through my teeth looking back at him with a raised brow and he sucks on the one side of his cheek trying not to laugh at me no doubt.
Silence towers over us both again as he finishes up with my dress.
I mean, she is funny. She's beautiful, witty, kind, perfect.
''What if I do?'' He asks leaning forward with his hands placed on his lap clasped together.
''Only nice?'' She frowns down at me and I frown back up at her.
''I believe you're already touching me'' she breathed out as his eyes levelled back onto hers with that smirk.
''I though so'' Draco hisses at his father then looking at me ''I want a drink-''
His hand then lifts to push a piece of hair behind my ear, my eyes flickering close at the feeling before snapping them back open again to look at him.
''Don't lie'' he whispers dragging his fingers up above my skirt to the hem of my panties making my hips lift up then back down quickly as he fiddles with the fabric between his fingers ''What did you Carter?''
I sit on the floor in front of the chair he's sitting resting my arms around my knees and placing my head back on the lower back of the chair.
After everything had been finished for dinner, the three of them seated at the table and I poured them each the wine the chef had chosen for the meal earning a thank you from Narcissa and a nod from Lucius before walking around to Draco side and pouring him a glass to which he lifts his head up and gives me a small smile before quickly dipping his head back down to the table again.
''Not like that darling'' he simpered causing her chest to rise against his, her eyes flickering closed as his hand gravitated down the side of her body to her thigh ''Like this'' he whispered brushing his fingers towards her inner thigh slowly which she just allowed to happen with no fighting back.
His hand lifts to snake around my neck pressing down just enough to keep me pressed firmly against the wall as his lips come forward to attack my neck, leaving traces of kisses across my skin. His hands came down to the top buttons off my dress undoing them to reveal some cleavage as he trailed his kisses down to my collarbone causing me to moan at the feel of his lips against my skin.
It's like his personality has flipped.
He let out a breathily laugh leaning his head to the floor then back up at me with a smirk biting the inside of his cheek ''How interesting'' he said with a bored expression making me tilt my head into my hands.
''Because, it's better than that despondent expression you hold''
''Deal''
''Oh shush'' she smiled getting on her tip toes to press a kiss onto his cheek and begin to walk out the kitchen ''Now stop distracting me Theodore'' she said playfully as she walked back into her bedroom to pick up the newspaper which had been pushed onto the floor by Elara who still slept heavily on her bed.
It feels nice to have someone to go to and have a release.
He smirks then stands up off the sofa,
She walked back into the kitchen to Theo who was now putting the kettle on and stretching his arms wide into the air.
He leaned away from my neck and let his eyes devour down my figure before coming back up to my eyes.
''Shit'' he mutters under his breath looking away from me as if he's disgusted in me or something ''Get out'' he says rather calmly compared to how his words just shot me straight through the chest.
His head lower to rest on mine causing me to suck in my breath, his lips nearly resting on mine.
''Go on then. Have a nice stroll'' I say biting the inside of my bottom lip to keep me from laughing.
I came to the possibility that maybe that would be too intimate for him, too much of a personal action to do with just anybody.
I hang up and place the phone back into my pocket with a huff.
''You're not going to stop teasing me about that are you?'' he asks quietly with his one hand rested on the counter beside him.
I drift my lips towards her cheek to kiss away a tear.
He looks up at me ''Please'' he almost whispers, and I swear I see a small smile come onto his lips for at least a second.
''What?'' he asks huskily in my ear.
''But how? You hardly know me''
He smiles with that damn annoying smile which almost resembled a vile smirk ''No-''
I stood back at the side of the room trying to surpress a yawn from how boring this was.
''I most definitely do not-''
He folds the belt in his hands looking down at me, his one hand then resting on my back to arch it more, pressing it down further.
He licks his lips trying to cover his smile.
''Astoria'' Draco corrected himself quickly making her smile with satisfaction.
His head then pulling out of her shoulder to look down at her with a smile, placing his hand on her cheek so kindly and pulling forward to place a kiss on her soft, plump lips which he craved so much.
''I've been a dick, so maybe let me try to do one nice thing'' he says and I look away from him for a moment.
''Sucking your bottom lip. It-it's annoying''
''I can make do with 5'' he smirked pulling her into him as he slammed his lips onto hers letting his hands glide up and down her side.
He smirks down at me again, the atmosphere feeling thick and heavy on my chest.
He smacks his glass back down on the table making me flinch as he smirks back at me with a dark chuckle coming from his mouth.
I rush to the door and walk out of his room slamming it behind me and walking into mine next door.
I look at him in disbelief.
Theo placed his hands on her shoulders massaging them gently as he leant his lips down to her ear ''It's alright you know, you don't have to rush looking for a job'' he whispered with a kind smile as her head tilted to the side to look at his face smiling back at her, his hands lowering to wrap around her waist from behind her on the bed.
''What?'' he asks with knitted brows and I shake my head at him.
''Well, what way do I sit?''
''Be a strong girl now'' he whispers gripping me with his other hand by my hip and spanking me with his belt again, tingles shooting through me from the pleasurable pain as I squeal with my mouth closed biting down hard on my lip.
My forehead rests on hers as she breathes breathlessly making me let out a devilish chuckle at her.
''You pig-''
''You're wrong. I've been praise many times on my kissing skills''
''Oh dear I-I didn't mean-''
''Meaning I wish I would have known what a slut you were before you lured me in-''
Nothing could sound more vile than the things that come from his mouth.
I shut myself up, not wanting to aggravate him anymore than I already have with the few words I had already said.
I started cleaning the library placing books in the proper places on the long book shelf.
''Twat'' I mutter as he chuckles back at me.
''Perfect. When can you start?'' she asked making my eyes grow wide in shock at how easy that was.
She's quite literally the best I've ever had. I don't see anyone topping this.
He leans out of my neck and looks back at me with blood on his bottom lip and a smirk as he pounds me up the wall. I smirk back and bring up my thumb to stroke against his lower lip and press the remainder of the blood into my mouth sucking on it as he watches me deeply.
Fuck I love teasing this girl.
''Your mother said she was going to get some drinks from the kitchen-''
''Pleasure'' he replies then pulling his chair out from his desk and sitting in it.
''Are you ok?'' I almost whisper.
''You would be correct my dear Theodore'' I murmur walking over to the window and looking out onto the grounds through the square window and leaning my side against the window sill.
She slumped on the bed next to Juliet and Theo pushing the newspaper away from Juliet onto the floor and making Theo shuffle over to make room as she laid her head on Juliet's lap.
He pulls his hand quickly away.
''I'm Narcissa Malfoy'' she smiled ''It's lovely to meet you, dear''
''Sounds very friendly'' I hear Draco mutter beside me causing his mother to look down at him in shock as he pushes his food around with his fork still.
''How was your day?'' he asks making me smile for some stupid reason.
I walk over to him slowly and sit in the desk chair as he looks down at me. I fiddle with my fingers nervously.
I wake up and hit the shower, feeling the hot water run down my spine as I tilt my head back to wash my hair.
____________
He immediately rushed out of the door and down the stairs not giving Juliet another looking.
''Higher'' he said keeping his eyes on her when she turned back around to face the bookshelf and get on her tip toes to higher herself to the next shelf ''Mmm, not that one. Next one''.
''I can't I have cramp in the right hand too'' he huffs down at me as if he's actually making sense right now.
''I write with both hands-''
''Yes'' she replies cuddling herself into her covers ''Thank you''
''Is it because I'm a maid?'' I ask with a shrug.
''I don't need my clothes'' she says making me look up at her with a smirk ''It's too warm'' she shrugs.
He tilted his head up to look at her again with a confused look before a smirk appeared back on his face ''Are you trying to seduce me?'' he said through a hushed tone looking at her humorously ''If so, lift your dress a bit higher and undo a couple of buttons'' he looked her up and down biting his bottom lip as she shook her head at him ''No?''
''I didn't humiliate you at all'' he huffs and I shake my head with gritted teeth.
''Where were you then?'' he asks and I sigh in annoyance ignoring his question as I walk towards the library ''Mother said you have the day off'' he says still walking beside me with his hands placed into his pockets.
''It's just, he doesn't talk to me. He doesn't like me being near him anymore. He never speaks anything but cruelness'' she says with a tear flowing down her cheek making me sympathise for her even more ''I really am sorry for burdening you and telling you all this, but I'm desperate. It's hard being a mother'' she cries and I nod back at her.
He loved being this close to her, having her all to himself. Even if it was just in these little moments and spurts of sex they would sometimes find themselves having with each other.
''Good''
Theo lifted himself up and sat in front of her instead grabbing both her hands in his ''Please tell me you're taking the piss'' he smirked at her and a curl came onto her lips.
''Believe me, I'd rather sniff white lines all day than have to stay here with you pair of fucking-''
''Then fuck off and do something else'' I snap at him making him suck on his bottom lip to stop himself from laughing.
''Ok. I won't touch you again'' he smiles putting his pinky out in front of me ''Promise'' he smirks and I sneer at him with a tut and turn my head away ''Come on, pinky promise and I'll never touch you again''
''Go on then, I have my wand on me'' I hit back at him and he tuts.
I smile at her kindly, opening the bottle of wine and pouring it into her wine glass.
Just seeing her like this, makes me forget everything.
''I-fuck-I love seeing you like this'' he moaned placing his other hand on her cheek with his forehead pressed against hers as he pounded into her.
''Tired? It's like 11am'' I say looking back at the sheets as I push the silk duvet cover over the tog.
I like to be alone, but ever since she's worked here, I enjoy being around her presence. Her presence feels kind, warm and inviting. Even though most of the time she's hitting me back with comments that only make me laugh. She really is quite funny.
The thought then coming to my mind that I have been fucking Theo who is my friend, and then there's Draco.
''Admiring me?'' He asks then tilting his head to the side to look at me as I sit there unable to say anything  ''It's ok, I get it. I have that affect on people'' he smirks looking deeply at me.
''Ok I'll walk with you'' I say and he just carries on walking not answering me back as I follow him to the door which he opens to let me out first.
She's kind of perfect.
''Fuck. You'' she says with a smirk and I shake my head with a tut and grab my cock in my hand.
We give our thank's to the chefs. Well, Narcissa and I do while Draco just leans back in his seat letting out a yawn then looking across the table where his father would usually sit with a squint to his eye.
Juliet smiled looking at Theo ''Yeah, stop being so moody Theodore'' she teased as he looked back at her with a shake of his head and a smirk then biting his lip at her.
''I believe it was you who just knocked on my door and strolled in rather confidently'' she says shutting the door and walking over to me with a sigh ''Why are you sitting on my bed?''
She nodded again with wide eyes before shaking it off.
''Words would be preferred''
''I don't get it. Wouldn't you rather be paid?'' He asks as if he's confused on the matter.
''How's work?'' Draco suddenly says tensing his jaw with a smirk forming on his face.
''Draco is upstairs if you want to-''
My eyes grow shocked at his words, feeling my hand shake beside my body.
His hand dropped to the bottom of my dress fiddling with the hem of the black material and sliding it up my body to pull over my head and throw onto the floor beside him, leaving me in just my black lace bra and thong.
''Malfoy-''
''Astoria-''
''Bitch'' Elara came into Juliet's bedroom with a stumble and a great smile since she'd just only came back home from drinking the whole night, again.
''Are you on the pill? Birth control?'' He says clearly to me as if he's getting impatient and I just stand there with a frown as he huffs at me ''you know, to protect you against those vile creatures people call children?'' He shakes his head.
The worlds weird like that. The way we gravitate towards someone no matter who they seem to be.
''How do you feel about earning, let's say, an extra 600?'' he suddenly says watching me carefully.
He shrugs ''Just couldn't''
It was as if he was taking a mental image, a very long mental image.
''Maybe I should just become an escort'' she mumbled to herself and the brown haired boy knitted his brows at her, not knowing whether to laugh or take her seriously ''I mean, they do make good money-''
*******************
Harry turned around, his eyes wide, looking around for the source of the noise, but he couldn't see it, he could only hear it.
Hermione was panting. Her face was drained of colour, her eyes blown wide. Adrenaline was running through her veins and her heart was hammering in her chest. She had barely heard Ron's question. "It-It was Draco. Something's wrong with him--the book."
"Very well, sit down, Mr. Malfoy." And he didn't even have house points taken away, wow, McGongall must have been feeling generous.
Get up.
"Here, you can use this." He handed her the cloak.
A memory flashed in his mind.
Looking at Draco's face right now, though, reminded him of the small moments where his friend would reach out to him in his own way.
Harry was sure his jaw was on the floor.
"Harry Potter, you must leave here, you are in great danger." Firenze addressed Harry this time, but his eyes never left Draco's. Harry opened his mouth to say something, but Draco grabbed his wrist to stop him.
"He probably has a concussion, what were you thinking about, using the flying car to get to Hogwarts, how did you even miss the train?" Hermione hissed at them but was still looking at Draco in pity.
, when the rage was back. It was sudden, like a jolt of pain; but, instead of going away, it only grew in intensity. He wanted to
"Well, he probably hasn't presented yet. It's like puberty, Harry," she said matter-of-factly. Harry blushed, still feeling a bit awkward discussing those topics.  But it didn't even amount to that time Hermione had started going off about sex charms.
"Do you want a repeat of last year?" He asked.
With one final cry, Quirrel turned to dust, and Harry turned back to Draco, a smile on his face, and Draco gave him a thumbs up while holding up the stone in his other hand. But the happiness didn't last long, a mist started to rise from Quirrel's ashes.
***************
"You know, I don't get it, why do you hang out with,
"Show me what you just put in your sack." Draco held out his hand, waiting.
"Wait here." He went to the back of his classroom, where he kept his supplies.
. Despite the circumstances, she was angry at how amused he sounded; like he was toying with her. So what if he was more magically advanced than her. This person was a conceited git, that was clear.
"YOU RAN AWAY?!" Draco screamed. Harry winced, rubbing the back of his neck as he looked down.
"Yes, Professor?" He asked.
"Now all we need to do is catch up with the train!" Harry chirped happily.
And there Draco stood, with no idea of what he was supposed to be doing, where he was supposed to go first, or where his friends were.
"Wanna walk to class together, It's the one class we have together." Hermione smiled at him, looking hopeful, it had been a bit of time since they had spent time together.
Once they were all gone, Snape and McGonagall both leveled him with a look, Snape's was clouded with suspicion while McGonagall's had an hint of fascination and amazement, and just a bit of fear, why? Draco couldn't fathom.
I also wanted to say that the number of chapters in this story is indefinite as well as all of my stories. I have the whole story plotted out, but I have no idea how many chapters it will take.
"Yes, Professor," Draco replied, walking over to the swarm of cotton creatures. He slowly took his wand out and approached the cloud with thinly veiled curiosity. Sure, he was scared to see what it would turn into. But he was also curious of what his worst fear would be. Voldemort? Maybe. Lucius? No; he had few good memories of his father, but they were there.
Draco was surprised, he had expected at least a tad bit more resistance from him, but he didn't dwell on it. He looked over at Ron, expecting him to be thinking the same, but he was greeted with a knowing smirk, that scared him,
"Exactly." Hermione nodded, not looking up from her Arithmancy textbook.
"I think we found the train."
"There's been a lot of Lovey Doveys floating around him lately," Luna said.
He knew he was dying. He was going to die. But he had saved Draco, he had saved Ron, he had saved his friends, just like he had said he would.
"Yeah." Ron nodded.
Draco, Snape and McGonagall got onto the moving staircase as it brought them to the office, the tension was unbearable. Once they finally got to entrance, they all got off and walked towards the desk.
They walked to all their classes together now, she realized how wrong she had been about him, everyone had told her that he was a snob and that he would be horrible towards her especially and her 'kind' but they never explained what that meant, but Draco did, he answered all her questions on the wizarding world and even taught her more.
his son?!" Harry was trying his best to be quiet, but it was getting just a tad bit harder.
The only reason he could think of for giving someone a flower anonymously would be a romantic—
he thought. The feelings of self-hatred were coming back.
to him again, he would even take the insults that seemed to come after every sentence with him.
instead. You know how much better she is with dealing with these sorts of things." Draco popped in. Now he could distract McGonagall while Terry paid more attention to Sprout. It was perfect!
Well, he looked like death; there was no nice way of putting it, honestly.
Leave.
" Draco yelled. He was still incredibly pale but some of his body warmth was starting to come back. He was so close.
"No; Draco and Harry have this thing. Harry knew that something was wrong before any of us even thought of it. He's always been different when it comes to Draco. We can go to the library and find out what's been petrifying all the students! If we defeat whatever's in the Chamber, then Draco'll be fine!" He seemed proud of himself for coming up with such an idea.
“What?” Draco had zoned out. “Oh, yes Professor.” Draco grabbed his books and left the library, leaving Snape behind.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ah, Mr. Malfoy. To what do I owe this visit?"
"Listen to me," Ron said in an authoritative voice that sounded completely unlike him.
Harry had stopped reacting to his lectures around 10 minutes ago. And that only infuriated Draco more. He just kept looking at Draco with that stupid dopey smile on his face. Draco didn't even know it was possible to smile that wide in these circumstances. Harry's grin stretched from ear to ear and it was getting hard to keep yelling at him.
"Yeah, I have." The words made Draco's stomach drop. Had that happened in the last timeline?
**********************
************
"A punishment?" Draco tilted his head.
Draco opened the door. Harry and Ron were gone; had it already been over an hour?
He grabbed the sword and spared only a moment to notice the yelling in the background. The basilisk was growing near; the
"Harry got on the Quidditch team?" Draco was shocked, he hadn't stolen the remembrall this time, how had Potter gotten on the team?
"You haven't seen a great big black dog anywhere, have you?" he asked.
The chairs weren’t the normal wood but instead fluffy and comfy chairs with the occasional beanbag thrown in for decoration. Books were littered on randoms shelves. The desks were placed in odd places while the desks themselves were different shapes. Some circles while others were squares. And if you looked up you could see the purple drapes that decorated the ceiling.
"Welcome to Divination," said Professor Trelawney, swooping into the room. Her bead necklaces moved just a bit as she opened her arms. The class gave her a look, a few mocking while others (mostly Muggleborns) looked at her in awe.
Draco sighed. He really had no desire to go to Hogsmeade. The last time he had seen the village, it had been in shambles. There was always fear in the air whenever you went down to one of the shops that were still standing. And it was awful being a Slytherin in the town. You could always feel the watching eyes of the townspeople. Some even refused service if you didn't roll up your sleeves.
Terry kept quiet, a serious look on his face. If Anthony was being truthful, that scared him. Terry was always the one to lift the mood whenever something like this happened. But now, that job was up to Anthony. And that scared him more than his old bully at St. Peter's.
him that, at least, not to his face.
"You'll all write won't you?" And Draco smiled, he looked so hopeful.
Some looked at him with fear, and that was even more stupid, they were both 11 for Pete's sake, how were they going to do anything towards them, just because his father was a prat it didn't mean he was as well. But Hermione had to admit that sometimes Draco could be cruel, but that was only towards the people who were mean towards her, like the Slytherins.
" Snape yelled as Draco fell to the ground, Harry was at the floor in an instant, picking him up.
Ron nodded, "Yeah, I mean, we might not have Draco, but you're bloody brilliant. You'll figure something out, and we'll help you. Maybe I was wrong about Malfoy..." Ron trailed off, looking guilty but thoughtful.
Hermione gave them a nervous look and touched her new necklace for some reason. It didn't take a genius to see she was hiding something.
McGonagall's eyes widened at that, really, it wasn't that big of a deal.
his Dad came in asking what all the noise was and he saw us in the fireplace and he got this look on his face but he didn't say anything!" Ron said in a rush, giggling in the middle of the story.
"It looks like a trip to the Headmaster is due." Snape spoke, Draco started, ready to object, when his godfather lifted up his hand, and Draco stopped.
