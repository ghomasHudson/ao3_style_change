Harriet was sitting comfortably amongst the blankets and pillows with her hair brushed and a clean nightdress on. The nest on Draco’s bed had been sanitized, refreshed, and the tiny baby was diapered, clothed, and swaddled in a warmer blanket as he lay in his mother’s arms.
The shot had been taken by a magical camera, which had been operated by a wizard, so it was no wonder that it moved.
His thin, pale fingers brushed the tip of the snitch’s delicate wings before the disagreeable little ball of trouble shot out of the way and allowed Slytherin’s seeker to endure one of the worst collisions seen on the quidditch field of Hogwarts.
Ahead of them was the golden snitch, twitching this way and that, almost as if it were fearful of the two people ready to reach out and grab it.
The healer shrugged, “Not quite yet formed enough to salvage, I’m afraid. If the mother doesn’t improve, I fear the pup may be lost.”
“I did. I felt them all night, but I didn’t mind. I’ve missed out for months, you know.” Draco said as his handsome face twisted into a frown. Harriet ignored his comment, too preoccupied with the pain from the baby’s kick and that worried Draco.
“I was named after a dragon, well…..for a dragon, not a specific one, just a dragon singularly.” Draco rambled as he tried not to oogle Harriet’s cleavage while she laid back against the pillows and took a deep breath, “We could consider naming him after something fierce too. Like a scorpion, we could call him ‘Scorpius’ Malfoy. What about that?”
Instead of being offended, Draco was angry, intrigued, and wounded. His alpha pride flared at the brazen omega and he grabbed her wrist from behind, spinning her around as he spoke, “Don’t you understand, Potter?! I don’t want to move on! I want to be with you!”
Harriet and Draco had rented a quaint estate, far away from wizarding Britain for their honeymoon, and the two returned to Draco’s bedroom only long enough to collect their trunks and Scorpius’s things they were bringing along.
“That’s alright…..that’s alright.” Harry said calmly, kissing Draco’s forehead, “Every baby’s different. There's nothing to worry about.”
They both sniffed as Draco closed the distance between them and captured Harriet’s lips in a deep kiss. He melted against her when she wrapped her arms loosely around his shoulders.
“..........Hmm?” Harriet asked distractedly while Draco poked his tongue out and dared to flick it across her skin.
A couple of days later, after Harriet had again given him her permission, Draco apparated to his office to retrieve a few files and several documents that he could review while he sat with Harriet.
With Harriet nestled in his bed, with them both snuggled together, naked, in her nest, after a night of sharing each other’s pleasure, Draco thought he would most likely have no better chance to confess his true feelings to Harriet.
“It’s dinner time.” Draco informed his wife as Lily raised a chubby fist to her mouth, “Mother, Father, and Scorpius are waiting. Come on, you need to get out of bed and walk for a while. The healer said it would help, remember?”

An hour and a half later, the baby woke and nursed, his diaper was changed, then after he drifted back to sleep, Draco and Harriet closed their eyes again.
He had spent the last six months writing her a pining letter every day and all she had to tell him was that their mating had been a……..mistake?
The secretary closed Harriet’s door with a thud, and the intrusive noise seperated Draco further from his incapacitated wife.
“That’s a lie.” Harriet said with a frown as she pressed, “Tell me what’s bothering you….I can see something’s wrong.”
Harriet was constantly and irrationally worried about Scorpius’s life. If he cried, she cried along with him. If Scorpius was carried out of the room by anyone, even Draco, Harriet followed closely behind, convinced that whoever held her baby was out to take revenge on her by hurting her only child.
The tears began to pour so quickly and her shoulders shook so violently that Draco began to worry she would work herself up into early labor on her own if he didn’t calm her down.
“Would you please stop being ridiculous, Malfoy? I’m not going to need it!” Harriet snapped before she disappeared.
Harriet was usually fairly level-headed emotionally. He really hadn’t noticed that big of a change in his omega during the duration of the time they had shared together over the months she had been in his care, but that had changed over the past week.
Once the spasm ended, Harriet sagged back against him with a gentle sigh, but Draco was not nearly as relaxed.
The couple were lucky to steal a few minutes together when they woke up in the morning or a brief pause before they succumbed to sleep at the end of each exhausting day.
Draco’s face tightened in concern when spit dripped absently from her open mouth along with tears from her eyes.
Instead of the fulfilling pressure of their bodies joining together, Harriet’s eyes popped wide open when she felt a feather-light, teasing flick against the sensitive bundle of nerves at the crest of her womanhood.
Much later that morning, Draco and Harriet both finally woke up. Draco’s eyes opened first but Harriet’s did the same a few moments later.
Narcissa and Draco looked at each other and Draco reluctantly nodded, “Of course…...but I’m staying right outside the room, alright? Please don’t ask me to go any farther than that, I really can’t right now.”
There may have been a spell to find that out in the wizarding world, but if there was, he had never heard of it.
Draco’s scowl remained on his face as he threw himself down against the pillows that were fluffed up behind him.
Draco didn’t understand why his darling wife was so against having a family, but he didn’t mind, really.
He had been so thrilled that his wife was pregnant that he had forgotten to ask important questions such as when the baby was supposed to arrive.
A smile crossed over her lips when he gently took their baby from her arms, rose to his feet, and slowly walked around the room with Scorpius while he cradled him gently.
Draco sighed in disappointment as he lay on his stomach to cuddle up to Harriet’s bump and place the side of his face against the swell.
Harriet sat up in bed and dangled her legs over the side as the familiar pain she had felt in her back for weeks increased sharply and wrapped ominously around her belly.
The way she writhed underneath him and pulled at his shirt, blonde hair when his lips found her aching nipples made his trousers tighten, but he ignored the sensation.
You would have thought Malfoy manor was hosting a wedding on the morning of Scorpius’s first birthday party.
“Ron and Hermione are coming back today.” Harriet informed her husband with a groan, thinking that truth would offer him the same level of relief that it did her.
“Well, I took an omega….months ago. She…..disappeared. I’ve tried to contact her ever since.” Draco explained, “I saw her again today and she’s…….she’s with child.”
Current students as well as faculty, staff, alumni, and parents had packed into the stands and they were all waiting for a proper match to watch.
Draco’s mother ran around her lavish house, bossing one group of decorators, commanding where the seventeenth tray of cake needed to be placed by the caterers…….
Draco looked over at Ron and Ron smiled sadly when he watched the anger and the haughtiness leave Draco’s face Draco replied, “I love her too, Weasley. Why do you think I’m here?”
“Step back! Both of you!” Draco snapped at his mother and Harriet’s best friend as he watched his omega gently lay down on her side.
Harry had been so thrilled when she had gotten pregnant with Scorpius, she didn’t think her husband could get anymore excited.
Somewhere she and Draco could do something that Harriet felt like they hadn’t done in a long time……..be with each other.
As he walked down the long, dark hallway of Malfoy manor, he pondered the different ways he could approach his current situation.
Draco allowed Harriet to go to bed first, then he followed shortly afterwards. That way, he was sure that he gave her the privacy to shower and dress, then they cuddled together in her little nest in the bed and went to sleep.
After a moment, Draco looked back out in that same direction and asked with a mirthless chuckle, “........How have you done it, Weasley?”
As Draco stood up to pin his mate against the wall and slam into her while he stood, somewhere, in the part of his mind that could reason through the sight of her bouncing breasts and pale, exposed throat, he thought it was just as well.
He wasn’t worried about watching another birth, how many had he already seen on that muggle machine?
“They are for me, anyway.” Harriet said with a bitter chuckle as Scorpius wriggled his tiny feet in his sleep.
The travel planner had sent the Malfoys to Siren’s Slip, a couples-only exclusive resort for the posh and worldly members of the wizarding world. The luxurious escape was built close to but concealed from some of the exclusive, similar muggle destinations in the beautiful Maldives.
“No, I’m helping my baby have a better life.” Harriet huffed while Draco scowled down at the family in the photograph, “They seem lovely. I’ve met them once, briefly. They have a farm and everything.”
“I’ve thought about it for a while and these past few days…….it's seemed so real. How amazing has it been to have her with us?” Draco asked as he reached out and gently took the small baby from Harriet.
She had so little warning as the back of her throat cinched and she began to heave that she barely had time to dash over to the toilet in time to open the lid and vomit noisily into the bowl.
“I know.” Harriet replied, clutching Lily’s hand in hers while the little girl looked around the busy train platform and blinked curiously. Harriet held her composure while she explained, “I’m proud of him, that’s all.”
He had taken the classes, he was ready, but the sudden gush of fluids that burst from Harriet and soaked his pants still took him by surprise to an embarrassing degree.
Draco had succeeded in securing his son, Harriet’s heart, and pulling her back from the dangerous edges of despair.
One particular healer was the last to exit and instead of bustling down the corridor with the rest of his team, he walked in front of Draco to speak with him.
“Everything’s alright, don’t worry.” The midwife said in a much more pleasant tone as she glanced up from her place between Harriet’s thighs, “We’re just finishing up.”
A very awkward silence passed between the muggle and the former Death Eater until Mr. Roberts cleared his throat and went on, “I’m quite sorry…... but the birth mother we’re working with hasn’t mentioned you at all. She told us the father wasn’t involved.”
Harriet moved underneath him and the motion caused the hardened tip of his arousal to brush torturously against her wet center.

…..Something was wrong with Harriet and she left him, going somewhere far away, hurt and in trouble…..and he couldn’t find her.
Draco knew he had overstepped his boundaries when instead of receiving a reward for his efforts, he was met with an ominous scowl from his omega.
Once his new suit was ordered, Draco went into the finest boutique in the ominous district and spent the better part of an hour making a few selections.
As soon as Draco and Harriet entered the bungalow, soothing candles ignited throughout the room, each one was scented like coconut and high tide. After the couple stepped over the threshold, the key removed itself from the door and carefully flew through the air to place itself back Harriet’s hand while the enchanted door gently closed on its own.
“Are you having another one?” Draco asked Harriet worriedly as they sat together in her nest one afternoon.
“No, I’m not.” Harriet replied, but she squeezed Draco’s hand in hers as she added, “Not yet, but we can try again, can’t we?”
Harriet looked down at their baby and chuckled mirthlessly in the darkened room as she asked her alpha, “How can you…...how can you even want me…..now?”
When Draco finished speaking, Harriet found herself gasping for air as she looked up at him, but Draco’s smirk changed into a pleasant smile as he continued, “But….. I’m not going to get what I want, and that’s alright, because that’s not the best thing for you….. And you’re not going to get what you want, either, Potter, because that’s not the best thing for our baby. Life is full of sacrifices, darling.”
Baby Scorpius didn’t see the way Draco smirked at how his new wife so readily bent over on all fours just for him.
Draco marveled at the way her swollen womb had felt under his hands during those brief seconds before she had slapped him away.
Keeping his steps quiet and careful, Draco made his way over to his son’s crib and very, very gently laid the baby down inside.
As much as he would have loved for his omega to have ridden him to ecstasy, he was more than pleased when Harriet moved off of him and laid down in the nest, staring up at him, nude, while she invited him to come and explore.
Scorpius’s eyes widened. He blinked at Draco curiously as if he were trying to determine whether his father’s claim was legitimate or not.
He imagined Harriet lying pitifully on a metal table while a group of muggle doctors pulled her innards out…...the mental imagine sickened him.
“Buy whatever you want from the trolley, son.” Draco nodded at Scorpius while he handed him his trunk and his owl, a beautiful, black feathered bird with bright, yellow eyes.
She turned around to go and sit on the sumptuous sofa in the bedroom she shared with Draco when her eyes widened.
“I suppose…..” Scorpius replied with a sigh, “I was very busy playing with the pixies in the trees though…....”
As Harriet was pulled off of her listless, unresponsive alpha so Madam Pomfrey and an attending nurse could begin to administer emergency care for him, all Harriet could think about was Draco.
Whether or not Draco was as naturally talented as her on a broom, he had already beaten her on one front.
He listened closely and calmly to everything the midwife had to say, but under his black suit, inside his ribs, his heart pounded nervously.
Sitting alone in Scorpius’s damask nursery, Harriet slowly rocked in the ebony chair that she sat in and Draco walked away from the room with a scowl.
That letter had been folded in half, with a picture of a lovely muggle couple inside, with two little children in front of them.
House elves had many tasks, some more pleasant than others, but transporting laughing babies was always an elf favorite.
Draco nodded but the concern didn’t leave his face. Harriet didn’t need her alpha’s help but he gave it to her anyway.
She didn't want to think about it, but she had indulged in more than one fantasy about lying in bed and Draco offering to rub…..something…..for her~.
By the time they arrived at their destination, Harriet was laughing so hard that she had to hold her belly.
At a surprising speed, their kiss went from sweet to passionate to greedy as Harriet’s hands moved up and down Draco’s chest to feel the firmness of his fit frame through the soft fabric of his shirt.
The first thing she noticed was that the wizarding world’s version of children’s safety locks had been installed on every door, every cabinet, and across every stairway in the house.
Harriet heard his comment but as he grabbed her hips and squeezed the extra flesh that had formed there, there was little else she could do besides whimper.
Draco was, in fact, pouting, but not only out of pride, out of genuine disappointment that he would never have the opportunity of family life that he so desperately wanted, or at least he thought.
Hermione was standing behind the sofa, holding a tray with the tea kettle, the cups, the cream, the sugar, and the biscuits in her hands.
Narcissa was delighted with her grandson and even Lucius took his fair amount of turns holding the latest addition to his prestigious family.
“We’re going to make your alpha like you even better~.” The photographer replied with a knowing smirk.
Draco did not try to hide the anguish on his face as he implored the muggle in front of him, “My name is Draco….Smith. I need to speak with you immediately.”
Harriet turned the other way and found Draco also resting in a deep slumber, exhausted from the previous night.
He half sat up and stared at her incredulously, “Aren’t you going to ask me what happens if Slytherin wins?!”
Draco frowned as he watched Harriet pick up her wand from the nearby table and raise it to apparate.
While the Malfoys omegas were distracted by Scorpius and the beautiful, warm day, Draco apparated out of the manor and began to complete the list of errands he had devised for himself.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Whenever Ron or Hermione mentioned Rose or their new baby, whenever Ron laid his hand on Hermione’s belly, whenever Hermione talked about her pregnancy, Draco had to resist the urge to hex them both out of desperate jealousy.
Draco could take a few years off and return to his potions once his son or daughter enrolled at Hogwarts, Lucius wouldn’t mind.
He stepped in close to Harriet and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear as he gazed at her and whispered, “We deserve this, you and I……..”
“Sorry, hope I didn’t wake you, Malfoy.” Hermione replied coldly as she realized that Draco was dressed in his pajamas and robe.
“Can you feel that?” Harriet asked innocently as Draco flattened his palms on either side of her bump.
“.....Well, I have to get ready for work…..so…. I’m afraid you’ll have to let go of me now.” Harriet yawned.
Harriet choked hoarsely like a soldier who’d been stabbed as she blindly reached for Draco. Once she found his arm, she clumsily pulled herself into a squat and he firmly held onto her sides so she could brace herself against him.
“I suppose…..” Scorpius replied with a sigh, “I was very busy playing with the pixies in the trees though…....”
By the third day of Harriet’s heat, Draco had accepted his duties and the tumultuous schedule that an omega in her condition kept.
Draco wasn’t sure who he was more worried about, his unborn child, or the omega with whom he was so deeply in love…..
Draco swallowed thickly as an inexplicable wave of anxious tingling swept over him while two house elves opened the large, double doors to the room and everyone turned around in their seats to look.
Lucius glowered at his son and stepped so close to him that he and Draco were eye to eye. Their slender noses were nearly touching as Lucius hissed warningly to his only offspring, “Our family has been involved in…….perhaps unscrupulous magical practices…..at different times throughout the ages, that’s true, but no Malfoy has ever been a rake. You may have been a coward in the war, Draco, and I suppose I have to accept that, but I will not stand by and allow my son to become a scoundrel.”
Harriet breathed in Draco’s calming scent and she idly reached a hand up behind herself to lay her palm tenderly against his cheek.
An elderly woman with a strict gaze came to stand in Draco’s doorway. Her piercing eyes glanced from Draco to Harriet as she asked, “Good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy. You sent for me?”
Under her dress, when Draco’s manhood brushed her innermost thigh besides her panties and felt the wetness there, a growl left his throat as his length quivered impatiently.
The only time she had left his grasp since then was when she was forced to visit the restroom or needed to care for Scorpius.
He honestly wanted to hear about how the pregnancy had gone, about how and what his darling Harriet felt.
When the Hogwarts Express pulled away a few moments later, Scorpius waved out the window to his family with a bright smile as he departed towards the beginning of his magical education.

People complimented her in the hallways at the Ministry and she masked her suffering with polite nods and falsely happy smiles.
“Don’t cry!” Draco hissed, wincing as Harriet put her hands up to her face and sobbed, “That‘ll just make it worse, Potter! Stop that immediately!”
The midwife swaddled the baby quickly, but Draco’s eyes narrowed once he got a closer look at his infant.
“What do you want?” Draco asked curtly, “I’ve already written to you about why she hasn’t replied. Give it a few weeks and you’ll get your precious meeting.”
He immediately sat bolt upright in bed and threw the covers off of himself. With his eyes wide, Draco dashed down the hallway and threw open the door to his bedroom.
Draco frowned as he bent down and hugged Harriet close while she whimpered and began to sob, “I’m sorry, Draco! I’m so sorry!”
When her fingers ghosted below his belt, Draco growled and flinched, but he grasped Harriet’s hand in his own before she could let her touch any further.
She blinked as Draco stood beside her and placed one of his large hands across the very slight, but very present, little bulge that had manifested on her lower abdomen.
As he apparated to St. Mungo’s, Draco couldn’t remember a time when he had felt more helpless, not even during the war.
On Saturday afternoons, Draco and Harriet sat for their weekly instruction on how to care for a newborn.
The early morning looked like a masterpiece as the sky gleamed with striking, vivid hues of orange, yellow, purple, and pink. The ocean only enhanced the splendor of the scene and in the bright light of day, Harriet and Draco were both awed by how clear the water looked that surrounded them.
“‘Everything?’” Draco sneered, “Tell me what is ‘everything’, father? Feeding me and Potter to the media so we be swallowed down like candies? Plastered across the pages of the news? Harriet hates the press and-”
Of course Draco had missed mating with his omega, but that wasn’t really why he was so painfully wanting and sweet that night.
Although Draco could smell her sweet scent, the feisty omega didn’t seem interested in receiving any more of his affections.
The machine Dr. Krause had turned on began to beep and whir as it loaded the computer program she was going to use. Draco grabbed Harriet’s hand again and in his seat, he crouched beside her as he watched Dr. Krause wash her hands and dispense some kind of clear fluid on a towel as she moved towards his mate.
With a scowl on his face, Draco turned around and blinked as he recognized one of the secretaries from the Auror office standing in front of the doors to the hallway that led away from the emergency department.
There were few things that pleased an alpha in love more than caring for their omega and pups, even if the latter hadn’t been born yet.
Narcissa seemed taken aback as she stared at Harriet hesitantly, not wanting to overstep her boundaries.
He glanced over at the nightstand and saw that a letter from the previous morning had been left unopened.
Harriet was taken aback so much that she laughed louder than she meant to as she asked, “.....What?!”
“Are you nervous?” Hermione asked Harriet as she sat beside her while they watched Ron and Scorpius.
His grey eyes glowed as he looked at Harriet with a smirk and greeted his bride, “Good morning, Mrs. Malfoy~.”
His mind didn’t stray off of Harriet as he showered, combed his blonde hair, and brushed his white teeth.
“Draco….” Harriet began, thinking about a few things she could probably go ahead and do for work while she was confined to the house.
It was his first instinct to protect his pregnant lover. As he rushed forward, Draco didn’t notice Ron or Hermione standing to the left of Harriet. Concerned only with her safety and well-being, Draco walked right up to his omega and promptly splayed his hand protectively across her belly.
The youngest Malfoy was in such a deep sleep he didn’t even notice the creaking sounds that came from his parents’ bed.
Draco had watched her with Rose, she was careful and kind. Harriet didn’t hate children or the idea of a family, but it was a weakness she didn’t want to allow.
As Draco looked on while his beloved Harriet pulled down her thin nightshirt and helped their little son hungrily latch on to one of her fattened nipples, he drew in a breath.
When the time came, he wanted to take Harriet to the hospital to make sure his omega would have everyone and everything that she needed.
When Harriet failed to speak, Draco went on, “If you won’t let me have you, will you at least allow me to care for my son or daughter? You can leave the moment they’re born and neither of us will ever contact you again. You have my word. I won’t even tell them about you at all, if you wish. If we pass you on the street, we won’t look your way. ”
Draco did not appreciate the ominous, threatening tones his letters were written in compared with the sweet words of concern that embellished Harriet’s parcels.
“That’s right, Scorp.” Harry smiled, chuckling at Dobby’s wide eyes. “Sissy today, or maybe early tomorrow morning. You nearly took that long to come to us.”
His bedroom was closest to the Manor’s entryway and knowing full well that his parents wouldn’t hear the unexpected visitor in time to avoid Harriet waking from the sound, he threw on his robe, left the bed, and dashed down the hallway.
“Hello in there, little one.” Draco whispered to the soft swell under his wife’s navel, “Mummy and Daddy love you very much.”
“I can’t help it, my love. I’m your mate, it’s my job to fuss over you…….I’m your alpha, and this is my, our, pup.” Draco whispered.
Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff hadn’t been selected to play in the game, but no one seemed particularly bothered by that.
“The notion itself is ridiculous. What about my job?” Harriet asked, “I’m an auror, Draco. I’m constantly in danger…..I keep long hours. You expect me to mother a child under those circumstances?”
“I wish you’d stop looking at me like that. She did say nine more weeks, not nine more minutes. I’m not a bomb that’s going to explode.” Harriet huffed as Draco dared to reach out and lay a hand on her belly.
“You didn’t trouble me at all.” Draco replied, “I’m glad I could help. That’s all I want to do, Potter…...Help.”
Regardless of the hastiness of the motion, Draco saw the glimmer of happiness in his father’s frigid, grey eyes as he stared down at the little blonde boy.
He sat up quickly and grimaced when he felt how sore his back and neck were from sleeping in the hard, unforgiving rocking chair all night.
“That’s not what I’m talking about, Ronald! Can you not see this is obviously a bad situation? What if…..what if he’s keeping her prisoner or something?! What if he’s forcing her?! I’m going to owl her tonight and tomorrow and the day after that until she answers me.” Hermione said quickly.
“Potter, what did I just say about wanting you and the baby to be healthy? I can’t claim you right now, we’ve been over this.” Draco scowled.
It was a triumph for both Draco’s ego and his heart that Harriet said nothing to protest him addressing her by that sweet nothing.
Desperate to reverse the adoption quickly and break down the walls that Harriet kept placing between him and her, Draco had decided he would escort his pregnant omega to have the test completed, wherever that would take place in the muggle world.
“Thanks, Dad.” Scorpius smiled up at his father, before he looked sadly at his family and nodded, “I’ll miss you all.”
By the week of her due date, Harriet had gotten into the habit of sleeping on her side facing Draco, letting her rounded belly rest between.
“I have something wonderful in store for you today, Potter.” Draco touted as he raised a hand and combed his fingers carefully through Harriet’s messy hair.
Once Harriet relaxed again, the midwife quickly began her exam and once she found evidence of what she had been searching for, with the healer’s approval, she glanced up at Draco and Harriet with a happy smile, “Yes, the child is on its way. It may take some time or it may happen quick, every baby’s different.”
Draco’s broom was newer and more expensive than Harriet’s. His ambition to succeed was also much greater. He grasped the handle of his broomstick and rocketed at full speed nearly straight towards the ground.
“She’s hiding here, Mother!” Draco went on, “She’ll have the baby and then she’ll leave….sometime...shortly after. She’s going to leave! She’s with me, for now, but we’re not….together! I never said we were a couple in the letter! I never said we were engaged! You both jumped to conclusions!”
Ron and Hermione slowly sat down across from Draco as he peered at them both with his icy, grey eyes.
Harriet placed her hands over Draco’s as they watched a pregnant woman appear on the screen, lying on a hospital bed with a man who was presumably her alpha, standing beside her.
When the day of the dinner reservations that Draco had scheduled arrived, his smile turned into a smirk as he looked down at Harriet that morning.
As he dropped his wand, he picked her up in his strong arms, and turned her to lay against a pile of soft pillows that had been placed on the floor from one of the opened boxes. Draco growled in his throat as he kissed Harriet's tender breasts.
It was hard to say what was more pleasing to the Malfoy heir, the way Harriet’s head lulled back against his chest, exposing her creamy, pale throat, her swollen womb that held the child she was growing for him, or her beautiful, ample breasts.
“Well, according to him, you do, or at least, you did. With this court order, he can force the test to be completed. Should the results prove his claim to be false, then that’s a different matter.” Langston added.
As Lucius spoke, he could almost smell the metallic scent of glittering, gold galleons, “On the contrary, Draco, I’ve come to urge you to fight for what is yours.”
It wasn’t anywhere near as intense as the birth of her son, but Harriet weakly held onto Draco and Hermione as the midwife and healer guided her on easing the placenta from her body.
“Yes, you can, Potter.” Draco said with stoic resolve, “Don’t be ridiculous. You defeated the Dark Lord, no one’s ever done that but you. Any woman can-“
Draco pounded down the hallway so quickly he could feel the impact from every step shooting up through his legs. Hermione followed breathlessly behind him and as he reached the bedroom where his mother’s voice had come from, he realized she was there, but he paid her no mind.
“I know, Potter, I know.” Draco said quickly, “I’ve heard it before, remember? Regardless of where you stand on the issue though, I still have a nursery to prepare. I thought it may be rather nice if my son or daughter’s mother helped choose the decorations.”
She was healed and feeling well, but she had noticed that Draco hadn't made love to her since Scorpius was born and she didn’t understand why.
That was something that Draco had to grant the muggles, they were years ahead in their ways of thinking about…...some matters.
The bungalow was polished and welcoming. There was a small kitchen over in the corner and a lovely sitting area in front of two massive glass panes that could be tapped with a wand to disappear and reappear so that the breeze from the ocean may be felt in its entirety.
“Draco….what…..?” Harriet fumbled for words as she watched him kneel down in front of her and slip his hand into the inner pocket of his jacket.
The shining stars in the sky illuminated the waterfall behind the man as he stood in front of its rushing current.
“Is that all I am to you, Father? Your failed son, now a chance for ‘wonderful publicity’?! Potter and I aren’t engaged!” Draco exclaimed in exasperation.
“George, Oliver, Katie.” Harriet politely spoke to each one in turn, “It’s brilliant to see you all again!”
Harriet calmly led Draco out of the alley and past the span of buildings to enter the medical center.
Draco had sent for a healer, but by the time the wizarding island’s medical team arrived, Harriet was already frantically scrambling to make a nest on the bed in their lavish room while she whimpered for Draco, desperate for him to join her there.
Once the girls and the elves had left the room, Draco looked down at Harriet and offered her his hand.
She found Draco sitting calmly on the bed, in a new black suit, lacing up a fresh pair of shiny, leather shoes when he looked up at her and scowled.
They only left Harriet’s nest to visit the lavatory when needed. Their meals were placed outside the door by the Malfoy house elves and Draco used his wand to bring their sustenance into the room.
Draco woke when he felt movement in the bed and he watched with Harriet as the sun climbed into the sky.
“.............Congratulations, son.” Lucius nodded at Draco. His grey eyes regarded Harriet coldly as he nodded at her as well and spoke, “........Harriet.”
There was an unending string of Aurors at the Ministry, and the magical government could always recruit more if need be, but Draco’s baby only had one mother.
Draco was too busy floating on a cloud of triumph that he had managed to evade his parents for the moment. Allowing Harriet to take the lead, Draco let her order two chocolate gelatos for them and the couple sat down at a small table by the window with their frozen treats.
Draco’s wide smile was only hampered by the exhausted sigh that fell from Harriet’s lips. Gently, he helped her to her feet and guided her back to the alley so they could apparate.
In his haste, drunk on his own gains, Draco had neglected to mention in his letter to Lucius and Narcissa the intricacies of his complicated relationship with Harriet.
The gothic parlor was piled high with gifts brought by the party’s many attendees, which numbered well over one hundred.
When Harriet and Hermione were finally alone, the two women gazed at each other and both of them gasped with tears welling in their eyes as Hermione rushed forward and gently sat on the side of the bed.
“I promise, as soon as the baby’s born and you feel up to it again, I’ll claim you as much as you like~.” Draco smirked.

Instead of focusing on the verbal cues or the hushed reactions from the many onlookers, Harriet and Draco stared into each other’s eyes and concentrated on themselves.
Dobby loved Harry and by extension, little Scorpius too. He was slowly warming up to Draco, but that was a work in progress.
She rose from the sofa and walked over to the writing desk next to the bed. She stared down at the letter that she and Draco had received that morning and she paused to think.
And Draco……...Harriet was fairly certain that if she bore Draco a dozen children, he would love them all as ferociously and as deeply as he loved baby Scorpius.
Dr. Krause giggled at the ignorant alpha and looked up at Draco with a warm smile as she informed him, “That’s your baby!”
It had taken over an hour of reassuring and coaxing to convince Draco that it was safe enough for him to leave her side and attend the wretched business gathering at his father’s company.
She tried not to go out much, only buying what she needed to survive. Harriet hadn’t been in the public eye often since her impromptu tryst with Draco, but she did occasionally leave her apartment to buy a handful of groceries, wearing long, loose robes that hid her shape.
“Actually, Weasley,” Draco nodded at Ron, “I did try asking her outright. She thwarted my efforts and I never got the chance, but as I sat there afterwards, I pondered the setting I chose and I don’t think she would have cared much for it anyway.”
Draco was pleased to discover that his omega actually had decent taste. He agreed with most of the decorations and the linens that Harriet chose, his only stipulation was that he preferred shades of green, white, and black.
With only a year’s difference in their ages, the Malfoy siblings often had many disagreements, but they remained each other’s primary playmate and best friend.
“Well….. this may be difficult for you to understand, but this is a restaurant….and we’ve come here to eat. Don’t worry! There’s no reason to be afraid, alright?” Draco asked in a teasing, sarcastic tone.
With a flick of her wand, the healer apparated away and Draco frowned to himself as the healer’s grim warning echoed in his mind.
“I’ve already told you I’m not going to the hospital.” Harriet scowled as Draco worriedly laid his hands over her belly, “The healers and the midwife agreed that there’s no reason why I can’t stay here.”
“Sssh……..Potter, I’m not laughing at you.” Draco whispered while his elegant fingers drew soothing patterns over Harriet’s swollen tummy, “I’m not laughing at you at all. I want you to be happy, but I want you and the baby to be healthy too. Am I not allowed to want that?”
Harriet had imagined that by taking their honeymoon on an island near Greece that she and Draco would have ample amounts of romantic moments between them, but she hadn’t anticipated that the peace that came with their wedding, the gentle, loving reassurance of her alpha, and the calmness of the sea would induce her next heat.
Draco offered her his hand and he kept the other on her back as he helped her stand from his writing desk. His motions were soft and gentle as he brought Harriet into the bathtub with him and cleaned them both.
Draco had the jeweler craft Harriet’s engagement ring out of the finest gold, with two lions carved on each side of a gorgeous, flawless diamond, surrounded by sparkling, vibrant rubies.
Under Draco’s intoxicating affection, Harriet dropped her guard for a moment and revelled in the feeling of lying in her alpha’s arms, safe and secure.
“Come on, then.” Draco smirked as he stood and lifted Harriet up into his arms, “Let’s get you something to eat.”
If Harriet had known how much she could basically ignore the child inside her throughout the day, she would have agreed to start a family with Draco a long time ago.
Harriet had fully embraced her bond to her mate and they spent their days side by side, with their baby between them, in complete, domestic bliss.
Draco still remembered the fire that burned in her green eyes as she moved forward and crushed her lips against his.
The Malfoys had fallen out of favor with the public but Lucius saw a wonderful opportunity in the form of his son’s…..indiscretion.
As soon as his grey eyes cracked open and he saw Harriet lying on her back with her hands covering her belly, he sat bolt upright in bed and demanded, “Potter?!?”
“I can’t help it! You look like a cat that’s been thrown into water.” Harriet chuckled as she wiped a hand over her face and tried to calm herself. Harriet pushed back another fit of giggles and looked at Draco seriously as the elevator chimed to announce its imminent departure, “You had better step out here if you don’t want to go back down.”
Draco’s grey eyes soft and sad as he stared down at his omega. Carefully, he swept Harriet up into her arms and gently carried her over to bed, after which, he placed her in the nest as gently as if she were made of glass.
“I saw a photograph of them.” Draco replied, “They’re only muggles, I can find them with a tracking spell.”
Draco remembered seeing two nurses walk past, laughing and giggling with each other as if they didn’t have a care in the world while his world fell apart.
They never really expected the article to turn into front page news, but that was exactly what happened.
Within a day of printing the massively lengthy announcement, every witch and every wizard had learned all about what had happened between Draco and Harriet.
Her alpha interrupted before he thought, “-How dare you, Potter! How dare you! First you run off and leave me without any warning whatsoever then you hide my own child from me?! For some reason, you believed you could trade it away like a pack of unwanted cards?! Now this?! You’re not even taking care of yourself! Do you want our baby dead?! Do you want to die?! Is that what you want?!?!”
Dr. Krause smiled at her patient and Draco as she spoke, “We’ll send your results over, Harriet, but I didn’t see any problems. I trust you two are getting ready to meet your new addition? The nursery’s set up? You’ve signed up for classes?”
“Nothing.” Harriet whispered in aggravation as she took one of her hands off of Scorpius and clumsily wiped at her eyes, “...........I’m fine.”
“I…..I….I’ve changed, Draco. My body’s different now…..” Harriet said quickly, self-conscious under his steely, grey gaze as she laid a hand on the swell of her belly.
Draco didn’t even have to touch her belly to see how hard it was and he frowned at the sight before Harriet managed to croak out, “I…….I have to push!”
Harriet looked so beautiful, so sweet, and so lovely that when the officiant started speaking again after the couple had both spoken, Draco placed a dangerous amount of confidence in his subpar listening.
Ron led them over to sit down on the sofa in the small living room as he nodded at them both as he whispered, “Give me just a moment and I’ll be back with some tea. I don’t want to make-“
“So is twelve.” Harriet shrugged as the midwife made some notes, “We’re going to be fine, love, don’t worry.”
She noticed at some point that she was laying on her side. Behind her, she heard Narcissa’s voice and felt the gentleness of Draco’s mother rubbing soft circles into her aching, lower back.
The baby cooed at his grandmother softly and Narcissa lovingly pulled the blanket he was wrapped in a bit tighter around his miniature frame.
Harriet’s happy sighs grew louder when she was able to derive a higher amount of benefit from Draco’s long, skilled fingers as they worked the kinks out of her tense muscles.
Both of the elves wore bright smiles as they carried the giggling Malfoy girls off to the dining room.
Draco rolled onto his back and opened his arms to let Harriet cuddle against him as easily as if it was a natural, automatic motion.
As Draco’s shiny, black shoes clicked across the marble floors while he approached the bedroom, Harriet writhed in her nest.
Harriet didn’t realize how upset Draco was becoming until, in the video, the woman reached out and grabbed her alpha’s hand.
Harriet whimpered when his elegant hands kneaded her breasts and his lips wrapped so carefully around her tender nipples.
Draco reached over and used his snakehead letter opener to hesitantly slit the sealed parchment and pull out the letter that lay inside.
Draco’s scowl deepened in irritation as he watched his young son’s blonde head turn towards him in the distance.
Draco let a hand fall to Harriet’s hip and before they got any closer, he raised his wand and apprated them both straight to the restaurant at which he had made reservations.
“That’ll…..never work…...Malfoy.” Harriet sighed as she picked up her pace. Draco groaned as his mate rode him faster, but Harriet leaned down over top of him and whispered, “Because I am the better flyer~.”
Under the table, Narcissa kicked her husband with the high heels of her boots, earning her a warning scowl from her alpha.
At some point, Draco did make a weak attempt to leave, but Harriet’s hand clutched onto his nightshirt even as she slept.
“Would you shut it, Potter?!” Draco hissed as Harriet continued to laugh, although his narrowed eyes softened when he saw the way that she cradled her belly.
Draco seemed glad to see his father. Lucius appreciated the way that Draco looked over at him as if he were waiting for his direction, just as he had when he was a small boy.
Harriet was mortified but when Draco continued his ministrations, to her dismay, a soft, satisfied sigh escaped her lips.
Draco was alone in his office, and Harriet was too far along for him to go and bother her, but……but his pulse was racing and his trousers had become so tight that he had to seek out release.
“-Ly in love with you? Yes.” Draco shrugged, “Come on, my darling, we’ll pick up Scorpius so you can nurse him, then we’ll come back.”
The cashier couldn’t help but notice the soft look in Draco’s disguised eyes as he placed a gentle kiss on top of Harriet’s head, nor could the woman ignore the way Harriet sighed and instinctively leaned back against Draco.
“-But,” Draco interrupted, “I have as many rights as you do to that baby. When I prove I’m the father, the court will turn them over to me. If everything else fails, then I’ll bide my time for the next eighteen years and approach them as an adult. No child of mine is not going to realize they’re a Malfoy.”
Harry laughed at his wife’s irritability and moved his hand to rub gentle little circles into her lower back.
Draco himself wasn’t tired, especially after their previous nap a few hours earlier, but he smirked in amusement at Harriet’s apparent exhaustion.
“You don’t have to worry about any of that.” Draco whispered to Harriet. He kissed her ear tenderly as she slowly fell asleep, “I’m here, Potter, I’m here~.”
“Alright, alright.” Draco said soothingly as he gazed down at Harriet while she drew in a shuddering gasp, “Let me…..um, let me call the midwife…..She can tell us if we need to get to the hospital now or if we should wait a bit.”
“It’s not.” Draco agreed with a nod, “But it’s what good parents do and that’s what we’re going to do.”
He had rehearsed in his mind a hundred times what he would say the moment he first saw his child, what declarations he would make, what snarky comment he would say to Harriet to lighten the moment, but as he held his little one and gazed down into the baby’s large, grey eyes, Draco couldn’t remember how to speak, much less what he had intended to say.
When Harriet finally began to rustle around, Draco was spooned so closely behind her that her movements woke him as well.
Harriet, Ron, and Hermione all blinked as Draco stomped across the room, threw open the door, and walked outside.
Draco had grown up very sheltered, spending his days at either Malfoy manor or Hogwarts. During his time as a Death Eater, he rarely had to leave the familiar confines of either.
Healers and nurses were working so concentratedly on Harriet that they were practically tangled up with each other.
His grey eyes burned with want as he scanned over his omega, from her thick, lustrous hair, to the places in her figure that Scorpius’s birth had softened desirably~.
He vowed silently that he would be ten times more loving than his own father had been and ten times more supportive.
There was one window outside that showed the sky, but none open to the inner workings of the employee’s section of the office.
There were no breast pumps in the wizarding world and Harriet didn’t ask her alpha to go to the muggle realm to secure one for her, so she remained in charge of Scorpius’s feedings.
To avoid insulting his wife’s friends, he abruptly interrupted the flow of their chat and stood from the sofa, “-Sorry, excuse me, I’ve got to clear my head a moment.”
Behind her, Draco kept his hands protectively splayed around Harriet’s belly, watching proudly as she ate with zeal.
The pain lasted longer than Draco would have liked and when it finally ended, it left questions in her mind.
Draco worriedly glanced down at the midwife as he held one of Harriet’s thighs in his free hand and frowned.
Harriet was ashamed about the tears that gathered in her eyes as she listened to the harsh words being hurled at her. She had been through much worse than Draco‘s verbal attack, but in her pregnant state, she found herself defenseless against the pools of thick tears that clouded her vision.
Harriet and Draco finished their gelato alarmingly quickly and several seconds after, they bid Hermione and Ron brief goodbyes before they exited the shop.
Harriet glanced over at Draco and she tried not to laugh at the way his frown deepened as the other alpha mentioned his child.
The scent hit Draco squarely in the face as soon as he walked through the door. For a moment he was confused and his grey eyes narrowed as he gazed at Harriet in disbelief.
Draco remained sensitive to Harriet’s needs. He always let her lounge about before and after their training periods on class days, but whether or not Harriet continued to allow him into her heart, every day brought Draco closer to fatherhood.
The charm Draco had cast earlier had long worn off. His and Harriet’s faces were no longer disguised.
Harriet was very glad that Draco was loving and caring enough to to rub her back and coo soothingly to her.
By her tenth week, when the midwife informed the couple at her check up that she had actually lost weight, Draco squeezed Harriet’s hand.
“It may get his mind off of it for a while.” Hermione shrugged, “And you both may be surprised at how much better things can work if someone’s….relaxed enough.”
Lucius and Narcissa were due to return home very soon. Both were eager to be present for the arrival of their secret grandchild. Harriet paid little attention to that fact. As Draco’s son or daughter grew heavier, she had really started to notice the increased strain on her spine.
Envy wasn’t a feeling that Draco Malfoy was used to, he usually had everything and others envied him for it.
Draco’s grey eyes cracked open in the early morning light. The clean bandages on his head obscured his vision as he stared up at the Slytherin green ceiling of his vast bedroom.
Draco couldn’t wait to meet his baby, but a part of him was really going to miss Harriet being pregnant.
Dr. Krause smiled knowingly while she moved the wand around and finished Harriet’s exam. She tried to take her time and let the awestruck alpha have a visit with his unborn child.
As Draco finished speaking, his grey eyes were soft and loving and the gentle way his gaze drifted down to their newborn melted Harriet’s heart.
Draco wrapped his arms around his mate and delighted in the feeling of Harriet’s warm body so close to his, enjoying the subtle motion of their son or daughter squirming in her womb against his flat abdomen.
“It’s dinner time.” Draco informed his wife as Lily raised a chubby fist to her mouth, “Mother, Father, and Scorpius are waiting. Come on, you need to get out of bed and walk for a while. The midwife said it would help, remember?”
The baby whimpered under his grandfather’s steely gaze and Draco shifted nervously on his feet as he watched every move Lucius made.
Draco nearly leapt out of his chair when the owl from the Ministry smashed against his window and shattered the peaceful silence that had existed in his large, dark office.
“Of course.” The woman behind the counter smiled, “I’m assuming you’re interested in our maternity package?”
“I wish you wouldn’t look so grim.” Harriet said with a wry smile, referring to the melancholy frown that was plastered on Draco’s face.
That look came back onto Narcissa’s face, that look that Harriet despised, as if the older woman was thinking about eating her.
He could only use the sparse, fleeting moments of spare time he had every day to conduct his investigation, but eventually, his efforts became worthwhile.
When he looked at his mate and saw her eyes wide, her cheeks flushed from embarrassment, and the wedding officiant staring at him with his mouth open, Draco frowned sheepishly.
Her night robe was the only thing she wore and that was fastened tightly to support her swollen breasts.
Even while he and Harriet kissed, Draco snaked a hand between them and let his fingers splay protectively over the place where his unborn child was growing.
Draco’s long, light blonde hair never tangled, no matter how she rolled in bed at night. Her grey eyes were particularly bright that morning and her pink lips begged Harry to kiss them…...
Harriet could wait until the birth but she saw the curious delight glittering in her alpha’s grey eyes and she nodded silently to give her permission.
Harriet’s green eyes fluttered while she laid back on the sofa. The foreboding, black ebbings at the corners of her vision gradually darkened the world around her.
Harriet looked at the woman and nodded in understanding. Draco leaned over and squeezed Harriet’s hand bracingly as he watched the muggle doctor coat Harriet’s abdomen in…...whatever that substance was.
“Mr. Malfoy, please come quickly! We’ve been looking everywhere for you! They’ve already taken Harriet back to the maternity ward!” The secretary implored Draco.
Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Harriet had taken the time to change into her best maternity dress. Her long hair had been neatly brushed and as she sat across from Draco, he had a difficult time keeping his eyes off of his mate.
Draco moved closer to his mate and before Harriet could do anything but gasp, his hands were winding around her waist and his mouth hovered over her collarbone, placing gentle, wet kisses along the place the straps of her green dress had ridden all day, teasing him by hinting at her bare shoulders.
How was Draco supposed to protect his mate from the pains of labor if he didn’t learn what Harriet would need him to do?
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Unfortunately, as soon as Harriet was sitting on her bottom, another deep pain began and she whimpered. The midwife smiled softly while Draco let Harriet brace herself against him and hold his hands for support.
“Yes, Weasley.” Draco answered, irritated that he was shaken out of his pleasant thoughts, “I really do.”
Narcissa had agreed to occupy Harriet for a while, but Draco didn’t know the exact amount of time he had, so he needed to move quickly.
Draco’s outburst began to upset the women in class and nervous murmurings broke out as Harriet’s peers began to express their qualms about potentially having to undergo the surgery.
Draco narrowed his grey eyes and he picked up the letter. He slit the envelope effortlessly with his index finger and after he removed the parchment inside, he scanned over the words it bore.
With a gentle purr, Draco left Scorpius’s cribside, bounded over to Harriet’s nest as stealthily as a panther, and promptly crawled in next to her.
She had to push and as her pain crescendoed, she decided that her two attendants would find that out for themselves.
She saw some things that she liked, and some things that she didn’t. Mostly, though, at that point, Harriet liked sleep, and she was too proud to admit that she wasn’t getting enough.
Harriet drifted back into a deep, dreamless sleep as she nodded off again, too comfortable to stay awake.
As the owl landed right on her open windowsill a short while later, Harriet frowned and took the letter from its talons.
As soon as they arrived back at Malfoy manor, Draco picked Harriet up like a doll but he sat her down on the bed as gently as if she were made out of glass.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
The atmosphere became even more uncomfortable at that affirmation. Ron stared at Harriet and Draco but Hermione pushed to try and reach Harrirt as she asked, “Well, how…..um, how are you doing?”
He prepared small doses of anti-nausea potion for her to safely take throughout the day and the concoction managed to stop her from vomiting, but Harriet’s appetite plummeted.
His bed, usually expertly made with the finest sheets and duvet available, was rumpled and disheveled.
Draco watched in awe as that full head of blonde hair became a slippery, brand new little body in the midwife’s hands.
An unreadable look washed over Harriet’s face and Draco wasn’t sure if she was sad, nauseous, or regretful, but it passed quickly and she replied to him with a yawn, “.......Good morning, Draco.”
“Good morning, Harriet. It’s nice to meet you! My name is Dr. Krause, I’ll be doing your ultrasound today.” The physician smiled at her patient, glancing down at the omega’s chart before her eyes moved to Draco, “I see you have a guest with you!”
“You should have let me take you to the hospital when you first woke me.” Draco reprimanded his wife, although his tone was gentle and soft.
Harriet stopped shifting around and blinked at the alpha in front of her as she forced herself not to blush.
They followed the directions and walked down the hall until they came to the elevators. Harriet stepped inside and Draco closely followed her. The door closed and Harriet pushed the button to go to the fourth floor as she looked at Draco and warned him, “The motion in muggle elevators isn’t quite as smooth as the ones in the Ministry, alright? Hold on.”
However, as Harriet and Draco walked back down the wooden pier on the morning of their departure, ready to apparate home, they were holding hands with their fingers entertained.
He blinked and felt his eyelashes scrape against the bandages that were wrapped around his head. In front of his face, he saw a very familiar pair of green eyes staring down at him.
He was hoping they’d have a minute to chat and cuddle, but he was glad his pregnant mate was taking the rest that she needed.
Draco watched the muggle medical staff enter the room, then he watched as they placed a tarp in front of her, and set about their work.
Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror and sighed to himself while the house elves finished their task of readying him for what was really his second wedding.
Harriet could have just taken Draco’s hand and laid it against her bump, but she chose to coax her alpha to open up to her instead.
In fact, she began to begrudge agreeing to babysit little Rose at all. If she and Draco hadn’t cared for Hermione and Ron’s daughter, then perhaps Draco would have left his fleeting thoughts about his legacy as only that…….fleeting thoughts.
“It’s alright, it’s alright now.” Draco whispered as he kissed Harriet’s cheek and watched the midwife work, “I’m here, Potter, it’s alright.”
Narcissa barely noticed what was happening in the background while she paced around the room, cradling her darling Draco’s little boy.
Harriet soothingly stroked the back of Draco’s hand with hers when she looked up and saw that his jaw was clenched.
Harry chatted with Dobby and Scorpius while they all ate a few minutes later, as relaxed as any other morning until a shrill cry ripped through the air.
“And your eyes are closed in this one. He must get that from you, Potter.” Draco remarked as he pushed another picture over to the side as well.
Across from his desk, he had the luxury of a small fireplace, a console table, and two other velvet, tufted chairs, both made from rich, green fabric to seat anyone that he was forced to entertain.
Harriet’s hands should have been fastening the buttons to his shirt while he purred to her, nipping at her lips.
When Harriet saw him staring at her though, she shook Draco’s hand in hers and pointed towards the screen as she whispered, “Draco, I’m fine! Look!”
“Hurry up, love.” Draco spoke to Harriet with a warm smile and tired eyes as his gaze flickered from her to the baby, “My son is hungry. It’s not wise to make a Malfoy wait~.”
“We never even had a proper date.” Draco said with a laugh. As he watched Harriet bristle at the word, he added quickly, “........And we don’t have to, but will you at least speak with me? For a moment or two? That’s all my letters have ever asked you for.”
He admitted to himself that the restaurant had been a terrible idea, yet he didn’t know where to get a better one.
Harriet looked a little unsure about that statement, but her hand flew to her side when a sharp kick landed on the outer edge of her belly.
The couple settled in and curled up in that round bed with the fluffy, soft covers as they lay down to sleep an hour later.
He placed the book back on the shelf and quietly returned to his room. A frown creased his handsome face as his grey eyes fell on Harriet while he gently closed his bedroom door.
“That’s right, Potter, I’m quite pleased~. You’re even more beautiful than I recall.” Draco smirked as he kissed across her left hip.
“If they grant you custody,” Mr. Roberts continued, “Then the process will be cancelled and the child will be placed in your care.”
Once Harriet was dressed, Ron came back in the room, sat down, and looked on uselessly while Hermione crouched next to Harriet as she worked to corral her friend’s messy, dark tresses into an elegant chignon.
With a flick of his wand, Draco was able to trace down the additional piece of himself in the world.
She squeezed Draco’s hand tightly and she smiled through her joyful weeping when a choked sob tore itself from Draco’s throat despite his tremendous effort to contain the noise.
He didn’t bother to pause his kiss with his wife as he gave his wand a flick and those panes of glass disappeared, which allowed the ocean breeze to ghost through the room and envelope him and Harriet in its tranquil peace.
Narcissa didn’t particularly want Hermione in her home but Hermione didn’t care, she had fought beside Harriet for seven long years in grueling battles.
Harriet changed out of her wedding gown into more comfortable traveling clothes while Draco held Scorpius and let the baby pull playfully on his black tie.
One evening, while Draco laid in bed and Harriet stood in the doorway to the sprawling, marble bathroom that was attached to their bedroom, he asked with a laugh, “I just don’t understand why you’re so opposed to it! We’ve never even spent one of your heats together!”
The Malfoy house elves had a salary, medical care, holiday time, room and board, and even retirement plans which Harry had set up for them at Gringotts.
As the wedding officiant opened his mouth to declare Harriet and Draco officially married, Draco leaned forward and captured his wife in his hands, dipping her for a deep kiss as shocked gasps issued from the audience.
“I don’t have to breathe, Draco. I’ve told you for a week, they’re just false contractions. This could go on for quite a while, you really need to relax.” Harriet huffed.
Harriet continued to moan after the flood and in the urgency of the moment, Draco completely forgot exactly who he was supposed to call out to as he turned his head and shouted, “MOTHER!..........HEALER!.......COME QUICKLY!.........IT'S TIME!”
Harriet nuzzled into the crook of his neck and Draco whispered softly to her, as he stroked her hair gently until her eyes fluttered and she fell back asleep.
She took her birth control pill at the same time every night, but she rarely took them in the lavatory.

At first, he thought he had imagined it, but when the call came again, he and Hermione both heard his mother distinctly shout from down the corridor, “Draco! DRACO! Come quickly!”
Harriet had been to the ocean before, but Europe’s oceans, majestic as they were, were nothing quite like the Maldives.
“Do you want me that much?” Harriet asked as she walked over towards Draco and laughed as he tried to push his chair back even further to escape her.
Draco was less than pleased that his mate was suffering but he did enjoy having the strong, independent omega rely on him to such a great degree.
Harriet nodded and she placed her hands on Draco’s chest while she pulled herself up and threw her head back to stretch.
Being extremely careful not to make any noise while he put his clothes on and they apparated away from the manor, Draco breathed a sigh of relief when he and Harriet successfully escaped to an obscure muggle town that his omega apparently knew somewhat well.
Draco struggled not to purr as his toddlers fondly pulled on the collar of his suit and used their tiny hands to lovingly pat his face.
“Scorpius!” Draco shouted as he stood at the back entrance to Malfoy manor and gazed out across the estate’s grand terrace, “I’m not going to call you again! Dinner is ready!”
“Mother’s milk is the healthiest for infants. I’ve read that over and over again. You could stay a little while…..to recover of course, but to feed the baby too.” Draco slyly suggested.
Then she padded across the landing and looked at what would be her and Draco’s bedroom for the duration of their stay.
Kisses and hands covered her belly reverently, after they had trailed down her side and over her arms and legs.
Draco lay down beside his alpha, smirking when he opened his arms and she crawled right into them to place her head down on his trim chest while they both struggled to breathe.
Draco’s lips turned into a pout and he shook his head as he spoke, “Well, he’s just been born, Father. We haven’t given him a name yet.”
Draco laid a pair of his trousers down right along the edges of two blankets that Harriet had painstakingly arranged to her liking.
Whenever she and Draco shared a family dinner with his parents, which was several nights a week, Lucius stared at her calculatingly in between the Draco proud, arrogant glances that he threw at his only son.
“SHE’S HERE!” The new father repeated with glee while he watched the midwife hold his child and reach for a towel.
“You two know Potter better than anyone else.” Draco went on, “I need you to tell me how I should propose to her.”
“Please don’t feel obligated to call me ‘Mrs. Malfoy’.” Narcissa said with a nervous laugh before she continued, “I apologize for our absence, but Lucius and I are very glad that you’re here.” Narcissa said with a look that was surprisingly genuine and warm as she gazed at the omega who was carrying her grandson or granddaughter.
“It’ll be over soon, love.” Draco whispered as Harriet whimpered when he helped her stand to her feet.
Draco and Harry looked between their two children, then over at each other. Draco blushed softly as Harry leaned over and kissed her lips tenderly.
Besides, Draco wanted to watch over Harriet and Scorpius both and he couldn't do that very well in two different rooms simultaneously, even with magic.
Harriet made her decision. She picked up her quill and took a piece of parchment in her hand. As she began to write, Draco turned his scowl towards her as he sneered, “We’re not actually accepting, are we?”
The midwife gently palpated Harriet’s belly while the new parents stared down at their little one in awe and…...surprise.
As he led his mate at his side, Draco stepped out of the thicket with Harriet and approached the man standing in front of the waterfall.
“Rescind this adoption. Tell them you’ve changed your mind. I spoke with the muggle attorney I hired and he verified that as the birth mother, you’re still within your legal rights to do so. That will end all these unnecessary court battles.” Draco explained.
In the bathroom, after she took a luxurious soak in the tub, she opened the box and pulled out the beautiful black dress it contained.
“.......Well, first you need to prove your paternity and present that to the court in order to claim father’s rights.” Mr. Roberts informed Draco after he thought, “Then you can petition the court to have the adoption reversed. If they grant you custody-“
He walked down another hallway before he stepped into the room that was closest to his and Harriet’s.
She suppressed the grin that tried to cross her lips when she felt Draco’s unmistakable arousal press urgently into her bottom cheek while she guided his hands to her belly.
Harriet clutched Hermione with one hand and her belly with the other as she tucked her chin into her chest and bore down one last time to throw herself into eternity.

Draco spent the next hours working with the midwife to guide and support Harriet as the pain of her contractions increased and the length between them gradually shortened, signaling they were getting closer and closer to meeting their daughter.
Lucius and Narcissa were away on a business trip, so that gave Draco and Harriet an important amount of privacy in those first few days of their temporary cohabitation.
Draco followed the muggle man inside the house. They walked through a narrow hallway until Mr. Roberts paused and ushered Draco into what the Malfoy heir realized was a small living room.
Draco was beside his mate morning, noon, and night. If Harriet was hungry, he had whatever she wanted to eat brought to her immediately. If Harriet was drowsy, Draco herded her back to her nest and allowed her to cuddle against him while she napped.
Harriet looked up at Draco questioningly as he nodded to her and slipped out of the nest, “It’s alright, it’s probably just the house elves asking what we want to eat.”
Draco moved with her and she started to find it irritating, the way he kept his eyes locked worriedly onto her face as if he expected her to fold over on the bed, collapse, and be sick.
“Their clothes are perfectly fine for muggles, that’s what muggles wear. Not that I expect you to know that, though.” Harriet replied.
If his mate wanted to go into the dreaded muggle world and purchase some of their goods, then….fine. Draco comforted himself with the fact that he could always order some nicer things for his son or daughter later.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“May as well and get it over with.” Draco murmured against her skin, “Didn’t realize you were going to make this so much bloody work for me.”
Draco held her close and whispered soothingly to her for a while until she quieted and wiped her eyes.
Regardless of their progress, when the Malfoy heir saw that as a realistic possibility, he was the one who began having nightmares.
Lucius scoffed, “I’ll have you know that was for the betterment of our family’s business! I see no reason to sit back and-“
If Harriet took a shower and he deemed the temperature was too warm, he would throw a fit until she cooled it down to a temperature he felt was suitable.
Draco closed his eyes and resumed their kiss, placing one hand tenderly on the side of her face. Harriet’s headache began to ease as she breathed in her alpha’s soothing scent, whimpering as he moved his hands to knead at her swollen breasts.
Lucius and Narcissa were eagerly anticipating  the arrival of their first granddaughter, although they tried to give the expectant couple their privacy.
They moved towards each other slowly and as their lips met, Draco used his wand to close the nursery door.
“The best night of your life, that’s what’s happening this evening. Now go on, get started, we’re scheduled to arrive at seven.” Draco replied in a low whisper.
Harriet stepped down the elegant, marble hallway toward the sound that echoed again through the air.
Hogwarts cordially invites you both to play in the alumni quidditch game, which will be held on the last weekend of the next month.
Harriet cracked her green eyes open and rolled onto her back. She blinked over at Draco as he propped himself up on one arm and smirked down at his omega while he greeted her, “Good morning, Potter~.”
Harriet had chosen a lovely ivory gown that was as splendid as she had always imagined her dress might be, if she did end up marrying someone one day.
“If the baby’s real, then Harriet will need lots of help. We’ve helped all these years, we’ll help her some more.” Hermione decided, “We can’t just leave her alone, Ron!”
Draco’s eyes narrowed as he noticed the woman didn’t appear to be in pain, but she did have a covering over her head, nose, and mouth as she lay on the table.
Every moment was a pit of despair that she struggled not to fall face first into, and each one was deeper and uglier than the last.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief that Harriet had returned to him and it filled his heart with warmth as he watched her finally get to relax.
The room was elegantly decorated in a fashion that was worthy of Slytherin royalty. The walls were a deep shade of emerald green, embossed with black filigree. The damask curtains were highlighted by the gothic chandeliers that hung over each ornate, ebony crib.
Harriet healed nicely after the birth and she was pleased by how quickly her tummy started to deflate.
A smile crept over her lips again as she imagined the look that would be on Draco’s face when he saw their baby moving around on the screen at her appointment.
Harry grabbed a towel without hesitation and positioned his hands directly under Draco as he urged her on with a gentle smile, “Go ahead and push then, love. I’m not going to leave you.”
Her eyes remained open when she felt him place his smooth hands on the bare skin of her back, underneath her nightshirt, and gently began to rub soothing circles into her tense muscles.
Draco was there with her, on the verge of a tranquil slumber after a night of wonderfully exhaustive love-making…….
Draco left his impromptu meeting with Harriet’s care team and stalked through the house until he arrived back at Scorpius’s room.
She was lying in her nest, waiting for her husband to arrive, when Draco apparated back from the meeting directly in the center of their bedroom with his face twisted by an anguished scowl.
Draco had come and asked the muggles nicely to back away from his baby. He had even offered to compensate them as well. If neither of those strategies worked, then he felt he would have no choice but to use magic against them.
Narcissa Malfoy recalled that same feeling herself on a warm June evening nearly nineteen years ago……….
Harriet didn’t know if she was doing well or not as she closed her eyes and keened in her throat while she bore down again.
“Why?” Draco asked as he bent down and kissed Harriet’s forehead, “How am I supposed to help if I’m asleep?”
Harriet was glad it was dark. That way, Draco wouldn’t really see the changes in her body as he took her into her arms and made love to her for the first time since Socrpius’s birth.
“That’s not going to happen to my mate!” Draco cried vehemently as he watched the doctors pull the baby from the woman on the screen before they started shoving her insides back in and sutured her gaping wound.
Harriet wasn’t in the mood yet to face her friends again. She wasn’t ready to sit down and give them a long explanation about what had happened and what was happening……..the omega was still processing that herself.
A hideous falsehood spewed out to expectant parents to stop them from fearing the approaching horror that was postpartum.
“You should have woken me earlier.” Draco murmured as he bent his head and kissed Harriet’s face, “How far apart are they?”
He tried to emulate his godfather and maintain a calm face, even though he wanted to scream in terror.
Trying not to drool, Draco took his hands off Harriet’s shoulders and cupped her heavy breasts in his elongated hands.
He closed his eyes as he swallowed the treat his mate gave him without question and suckled her until she was empty.
Draco frowned like a punished child as Harriet finished writing and placed her reply in an envelope.
Harriet let out a small gasp as Draco grabbed hold of her hands and faced her as formally as a soldier standing at attention.
He could have had three delicious days of watching Harriet squirm and writhe underneath him, in front of him on her hands and knees, against the wall………...but instead he was going to play Daddy to the child of two people he couldn’t stand.
When Draco came to stand in the nursery doorway, he frowned as he watched his mate hold their son in her arms while he slept and she stared forlornly out the window.
One evening, Draco finally joined his lover in their bedroom after he managed to escape his father’s clutches.
Padding silently down the hall and across the house, Draco waved his wand and closed his eyes to peer around the corners using magic.
“HHAARRRRYY!” Draco shouted again from her place by the window and Harry raced over, draping her arm over his shoulder so he could support her.
“You’re imagining it.” Harriet smiled, “You had no idea they existed before you read that letter I sent you.”
“Harry Potter could never be in Dobby’s way, sir!” Dobby said humbly, smiling at Scorpius as the fair-headed, chubby-cheeked little boy giggled at him, “Master Scorpius looks very happy this morning!”
Harriet opened her emerald eyes when the sunlight fell across her face as it drifted over the soft bed where she and Draco lay.
What a wonderful press statement it would be if it were announced that Harriet Potter, the Harriet Potter, had chosen his son as her alpha and started a family with him!
Dobby cringed at the loud noise and Scorpius blinked, but Harry was up and out of his seat in an instant, racing out of the kitchen and down the hall.
Both teams picked up on the tension between the rival seekers when Draco gave Harriet a wicked smirk and asked in an arrogant tone, “Scared, Potter?”
The blonde alpha didn't deny himself the pleasure of staring at her engorged breasts which hung out of her nightshirt, temptingly close to his face.
Harriet frowned and rolled onto her side as Draco slipped out of her nest and grabbed his wand, hurrying to send for the midwife.
“We’re expecting!” Draco exclaimed, unable to contain his excitement any longer, as he glanced between his mother, his father, and Harriet.
Draco pushed his chair back to hide himself so Harriet wouldn’t be able to see the way he tightened his grip on his manhood and stroked himself harder.
Actually, despite the horrors of labor she had witnessed firsthand, as Hermione held Harriet's child, she found herself wondering how long it would be until she had one of her own…….
Harriet blinked as she looked out over the array of props and backdrops and cameras set up in the small space.
“No, sir….I do ask that you pardon my intrusion.” Draco explained, “But it's come to my attention that you and your wife are in the process of adopting my child.”
“Clearly something happened.” Draco insisted, his eyes once again moving back to the swell of her middle.
As beautiful as Draco always thought that she looked, seeing her in that dress, walking towards him in front of everyone was a startling new experience for the Malfoy heir.
The woman’s eyes immediately fell on Harriet’s rounded middle and the omega subconsciously placed a hand on her belly as she nodded at the woman and smiled, “Hello. I…….um, I’ve come looking for a gift for my husband.”
The healer and midwife went to leave but as they walked towards the door and Draco remained with Harriet, the Malfoy family healer glared over at him as she stated, “A man has no place in the birthing room. You need to leave, you’ll only be a hindrance.”
“Well, I beg to differ, Potter.” Draco replied. He leaned towards Harriet and hissed to her in a hushed whisper, “That night was not a mistake! And how dare you call our child an accident!”
“Your mother and I have spent a great deal of money and time setting everything into place and now, you’ve ruined it all!” Lucius growled.
To his great joy, Harriet welcomed the gesture and she immediately pulled him down so that their lips locked together.
The majority of the alumni present regarded each other with nostalgic rivalry, eager to have fun while they enjoyed an honor that few others had received.
Hermione had sat her baby down in her carrier on the coffee table right before she had started giving Harriet a crash course in infant care for nearly a half an hour while Ron brought in bag after bag of supplies.
All Draco wanted was for his darling Harriet to be happy, and of course, for her to become his bride~.
When they returned back to Malfoy manor later and found Scorpius asleep in his nursery after being soothed into slumber by Narcissa’s lullabies, Draco seized his opportunity.
When Rose cried in the night, by the time Harriet stood up and walked down the hall into the guest room they had placed her in, Draco was already pacing the floor with the little baby bundled in his arms.
After he had made his purchase, he apparated to Diagon Alley’s finest dining establishment, and then he came to his final stop for the afternoon.
“Why don’t you just wear your robes?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes as he watched his omega struggle.
When he saw that Harriet was finished with her nightly routine, he called out, “Do you really want to shut me up, Potter?”
“Well,” Draco purred, before he glanced down at Harriet’s nightgown and tried to pull the garment down so that he could get a glimpse of her perfect breasts, which he happily noticed had stayed a bit larger, even after Scorpius had weaned, “ I was going to make love to my wife……..if that’s alright, Mrs. Malfoy?”
“I…..didn’t say….you had to….t-to return everything.” Harriet replied as she wiped her eyes with a hand and sighed.
Later that evening, Draco was safely tucked back into the same bed which she had woken in that morning, with little Lily Lyra Potter peacefully asleep in her arms.
She would have loved to have been able to spend the night in that beautiful place with her alpha, but that wouldn’t work, it wouldn’t…….
The baby woke and nursed, his diaper was changed, then after he drifted back to sleep, Draco and Harriet closed their eyes again.
Without hesitation, he apparated away from his desk and landed in the hallway of the Auror Department, within an arm’s length of Harriet.
He was careful to blot the excess water out of her hair before they laid down in her nest so she wouldn’t catch a chill.
“Listen, everyone!” The instructor called out a few moments later with a clap of her hands. The class quieted while she spoke, “I’ve seen some great progress today! Keep practicing at home. Everyone’s doing really well! Before we end for the night, I have another video to show you, so if everyone will please move where they can see the screen!”
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy sat at the heavy, black-lacquered dining table enjoying their dinner that evening when Draco came barging into the room.
Harriet went to walk away from Draco but he quickly moved his hands to hold his wife’s hips firmly but gently in place.
The next two weeks passed by in a flurry of continued vendor appointments, scheduled consults with decorators and blocks of time where entire hired teams of people used their wands and their expertise to turn damask Malfoy manor into the elegant, host location of the year’s most heralded social event in Britain’s wizarding world.
Considering that he and Harriet had barely gotten to sleep by then, neither of them were particularly pleased when the inn’s attendant rapped firmly on their door.
The lights were too bright, the walls were too bland, and there were so many irritating beeping noises that he didn’t know which way to look.
“Sorry, Potter, I couldn’t resist.” Draco shrugged, “You looked too gorgeous there for a moment. I just had to have a taste~.”
I can’t wait to meet you. It’s going to take me some time to get there, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m here and I love you and Mummy very much.
Harriet’s eyes widened as her eyes flickered over to Draco for a second before she looked at Lucius and replied, “That’s right, Mr. Malfoy…..We haven’t discussed marriage.”
Lucius eyed Narcissa as he sat down at the table. He carefully watched her walk away as a thought lingered in his mind.
Draco could still taste the dirt from the field in his mouth as he slowly and painfully returned to consciousness in a dimly lit room.
Draco frowned and looked at Harriet imploringly as he asked, “Potter, if there’s something else you had in mind-“
Eventually, when the conversation became consumed by the topic of how lovely Hermione and Ron’s family was coming along, Draco could take no more.
Harriet’s ears had been accurate. As she approached the stadium, the excited chatter from the games’ attendees were unignorable.
From Harriet’s obviously pregnant belly to the two gelatos on the table, not one, Ron and Hermione didn’t know where to look or what to think.
For an alpha, choosing an omega usually meant that marriage was on the very near horizon. The Malfoys were a bit concerned since their son had yet to introduce them to his mysterious lover.
Harriet glanced over beside the bed and saw Scorpius still sleeping in his little crib, peacefully dreaming.
After a very tense pause, Harriet glanced back over towards Draco and wordlessly, he opened his arms for her. They were still standing so near to each other that it only took one step for Harriet to cuddle against Draco’s chest while he wrapped her in his embrace. Gently, he lifted her off of her feet and slipped their shoes off before he tucked himself and Harriet into the nest she’d made on his bed.
By the time they both found their release, Harriet was gasping for breath and Draco had managed to claw the top of her dress down far enough to bury his face in her ample cleavage.
A soft groan of disappointment left Harriet’s lips as Draco slowly released her tender breasts from his warm hands, but holding them just wasn’t enough for the smitten alpha. Harriet sighed as she felt Draco pull the thin straps of her nightdress down to openly expose her magnificently swollen glands to his view.
As Draco paused for a moment to gather his words, Harriet yawned and took a languid stretch right in front of him, letting her alpha have a good eyeful of the intriguing curves that her changed body boasted.
“May I……...get you anything?” Draco asked Harriet, glancing worriedly down at her belly, hoping he hadn’t hurt their baby in his haste.
Draco’s voice didn’t falter as he went on, “Harriet Potter, I love you. I’ve been in love with you for a long time now…... I’ve cared for you and protected you…..and I request that you grant me that honor for the rest of our lives……….You’ve become my mate and the mother of my firstborn son…..now I’m asking if you’ll be my bride?”
Conversation was very difficult. Even if the situation had been different, the Malfoys had very little to discuss with a member of the Potter family, especially the Girl Who Lived, but Narcissa was trying.
Harriet nodded at the woman as she approached and turned on one of the machines that Draco was so suspicious of, “Hello, it’s nice to meet you as well, Dr. Krause. This is my mate, Draco.”
“DRACO!” Harriet screamed as she hovered over the ground, jumped off her broom, and ran towards her husband, “DRACO!”
His omega was in a strange place, preparing to have something that he wasn’t familiar with done to her, and she had given her consent so it would be difficult for him to intervene and try to protect her if she needed his help.
Draco loved her exactly the way she was and Harriet had made sure that he would be able to see those memories in vivid color for the rest of his life.
A house elf appeared at the end of the long hallway and as soon as Draco saw the familiar family servant, he ran towards the elf as Draco called out, “Go and sit with your grandparents at the table! Mummy and I will be right there!”
“Would you like to hold her?” Harriet asked, “You may have to while she’s here, so you may as well learn now.”
Harriet frowned in response. As Draco looked at the omega, his omega, standing there in the street, with a delicate hand placed over their unborn child and her pink lips pursed together, he grappled with the urge to sweep her into his arms.
Ron and Hermione both saw the way that Draco’s harsh, grey eyes softened and clouded as he thought of Harriet and his mind seemed to drift off…….
Harriet clamped her legs around Draco and cried out, clutching onto him for support when she hit her peak as she felt him spill himself within her.
Draco scowled over at Ron but Ron kept looking across the landscape as he refused to meet and return Draco’s hostile glance.
Under the strict orders and generous tip received from Lucius Malfoy, the midwife who had cared for Narcissa during her pregnancy arrived at the Malfoy residence the following day to examine Harriet.
“You’ve just become a mother.” Draco replied with a soft smile at his darling, “There’s no need to apologize, Potter. Your alpha’s here~.”
“Breathe, love, breathe! I’m right here…..you’re alright…...you’re doing well. You’re doing so well!”
Draco tried to hold back as his omega crammed her curves into his face, assaulted him with her scent, tantalizing and vulnerable all at once…...but when Harriet moved and purposely coupled with her husband, he abandoned his futile attempts at resistance.
“Things are different in the muggle world, Draco. They have medications but the other treatments has to be performed by hand.” Harriet explained.
It really made Draco sad that his quarrel with his pregnant mate prevented him from being able to touch her small bump again before their days began.
“I wish you’d stop fighting me, Potter.” Draco whispered, “You know I’m going to win one day, why don’t you just give up?”
Draco expected Harriet to give him a soft, loving glance of appreciation but instead, she frowned at him impatiently over her mounded belly.
From the second they left the hospital, Draco hovered over his wife like a mother hen and Harriet was so exhausted and frightened that she let him dote on her without protest.
Draco felt his trousers grow even tighter as he watched Harriet lie there and wait for him, with one hand wrapped protectively around her belly and one across her her heavy breasts that heaved with the movement of her chest.
If Harriet would have let him take her during her heats years ago, Draco was certain that he would have already fathered half of a Hogwarts house with his beloved omega.
Draco was surprised when Harriet knotted her fingers in his hair and locked him in place as something sweet and thin filled his mouth.
A contraction gripped Draco’s middle that was so intense her teeth chattered and she sucked her breath in sharply, abandoning her fight to breathe calmly. When she felt that pain give way to a crushing vice of deep pressure, she opened her mouth and called out for her husband as dampness trickled between her legs.
Harriet let out a deep sigh as she closed her eyes and felt the echoes of pain start to ripple across her belly again as another contraction vaguely threatened.
Draco would have preferred to have made more concrete strides in charming his omega, but he wasn’t complaining.
“My nest is the only place I feel comfortable at this stage.” Harriet huffed as Draco stood and draped one of her arms across his shoulders.
Shortly after Draco and Harry had gotten married, Harry had managed to find and contact Dobby, knowing that he had survived the wound Bellatrix inflicted on him during the war. The house elf bore a scar from his struggle but that did nothing to dampen the smile that broke out on his face when he had seen Harry Potter again.
Harriet wore an unusual scowl on her face as she walked through the hallways of the auror department a few moments later.
She barely heard the barrage of footsteps that came racing down the hall as four different women charged towards the room.
Draco flipped over as they rolled in the sheets while his hands swept over her body. Neither of them really remembered how they got there, but in the midst of their passionate flurry, Harriet found herself sitting on top of her alpha, with him seated inside her and his hands possessively gripping her hips.
She had intended to meet with Ron and Hermione before the little one arrived but as the baby’s birth approached, Draco insisted that if she left the manor, he was going to follow her.
Harriet poured one pill out of her pouch, into her hand, and then another and then another, until she had emptied the pouch of its contents.
Harriet had nearly died of embarrassment when Draco had contacted the midwife to ask if her lengthy bathroom stays should be of any concern to her health or their baby’s.
Harriet Potter may have been the Dark Lord’s vanquisher and she may have had a mother who was muggle born, but……
“You haven’t had any better of a night than I have.” Harriet sighed, “I wanted you to get some sleep for a moment, anyway.”
Harriet laughed. It was hard for her to remember that Draco had no concept of many ordinary things in the muggle world. As she thought, she realized there wasn’t a true equivalent in the wizarding world for the procedure.
Comforting Harriet while she cried was more of a challenge for Draco than holding her over the toilet had been.
Harriet’s scent was thick and suffocatingly sweet, which was good, because it spoke to Draco and guided him about what he could do to help.
Harriet glared over at her husband and he glared back for a split second before their eyes turned back to the snitch.
As Draco moved forward to lean in and kiss Harriet’s lips with his, he failed to hold back the chuckle that escaped his throat.
With a deep sigh as if it were a great bother to him, Draco reluctantly took his omega’s hand and stood from the bed with a frown.
Harriet blushed when she glanced between her husband’s legs and noticed how angry his manhood looked.
With his office door firmly locked, Draco watched Harriet’s face in fascination as he made love to her, seated in his office chair, with her widened hips bearing down on him.
“Dinner is prepared whenever you and…...whenever you both are hungry. Your father and I will be waiting.” Narcissa ended with a nod.
Draco’s grey eyes shone brightly as they flickered up to his wife and he soothingly stroked the sides of her womb.
“Breathe…….” Draco whispered to Harriet as she gasped against his chest, “Breathe, there, just like that……...well done.”
Her voice cracked with pain as she wailed at her alpha, “Don’t you think that I want to choose some things for the baby?!?!”
Draco was just as anxious as Harriet was to rekindle their intimacy, but he knew what was coming and he wanted the occasion to be…..meaningful.
Draco kept his scowl as he watched his little boy huff in such exasperation that his small shoulders rose and fell dramatically as he stomped towards his father.
Draco lifted an arm to cover his squinting eyes from the blinding cameras. Without hesitation, he raised his wand in his other hand and set to work.
After Harriet stepped into her dress and slipped her arms through the gown’s short, lace sleeves, she put her hands behind her back to fasten the buttons.
The muggle doctor had been kind and she had taken good care of his mate and pup. Such good care in fact, that Draco could almost forgive her for her mistake…...Dr. Krause had called him and Harriet by the wrong last name.
Harriet didn’t care about being active, she just wanted to cuddle up amongst her soft things that smelled like Draco and rest.
After Draco held Rose for several seconds and managed not to drop her, he gained enough confidence in himself to stare down in wonder at the baby.
Narcissa and Hermione glanced at each other. It was no secret that the two women were anything but friends. However, for Harriet, Draco, and the baby who was about to arrive, they left the room and walked down the hall in peace.
While Harriet drifted off, she knew that Draco couldn’t guard her entirely from the pains of labor or the responsibilities that came with becoming a mother.
A week passed by more quickly for Draco than Harriet. As the pregnant omega entered her third trimester, she noticed that her belly grew heavier and her body became more fatigued.
All Draco was interested in hearing was that somehow, some way, his lover and their baby would be alright.
Draco woke up to the sound of his wife being ill, and in the middle of her retching, Harriet heard him come racing into the bathroom.
He felt numbly amazed when he realized that the constant, beating rhythm of the noise in the room was……
He began to stroke her belly in gentle circles as he coaxed her quietly, “Breathe, love…..let out your breath, there you go, that’s better.”
When Draco came down from his fleeting peak of pleasure, he looked over at the empty spot in the bed beside him and scowled.
Draco was livid when he realized that on the other side of the tarp, the woman on the table was…….awake.
“Congratulations to you both! Oh, Draco, love, how exciting! I can’t wait to be a grandmother!” Narcissa beamed, then she turned to Harriet and asked urgently, “Harriet, dear…...how far along are you?”
“You should have told me!” Harriet said as she pulled back from Hermione and glanced down at her belly.
Thank you so much for choosing to place your baby with our family! Out of all the other couples you could have chosen for your child’s adoption, we are honored that you selected us! While we respect your decision to remain anonymous to our new son or daughter, you are always welcome in our lives anytime! Please look for the official forms in the mail soon!
Narcissa didn’t care that it was Harriet Potter her son had chosen, she was only glad that he had taken a mate and so kindly made her a grandmother~.
Draco may have been thrown out but that didn’t stop him pacing right outside of his room and pressing his ear against the wood of the door to eavesdrop.
Her sobs gradually quieted and Draco bent down to place a very sweet kiss right over the center of her belly.
She sighed as she pulled herself up, using Draco as a crutch, until she was sitting on her bottom in the middle of the bed…...the bed which served its true purpose to Draco’s omega once more.
Draco closed the door and glanced over to Harriet. When he saw the covers over her head, he assumed she had fallen back asleep and he walked into the bathroom.
“-Really, Draco, it’s fine! Alright? It’s fine!” Harriet said in a huff, as if the discussion itself had irritated her to the center of her very being.
“Is the baby coming right now?!?!” Draco shouted to the midwife from behind Harriet’s shoulder, “She can’t come now! I…..I need to apparate us to St. Mungo’s!”
Harriet narrowed her green eyes at Draco for a moment but when she saw how peacefully he was resting, she decided not to disturb him.
Draco was too busy gnashing his teeth to engage in any kind of even forced, mildly pleasant social interaction.
Draco moved his hand out from behind his back and placed the secret picture onto the table for Harriet to view.
“Was that not the most mental thing you’ve ever seen?” Ron asked Hermione with his face puckered as if he were concentrating very hard on something.
Harriet had let go of all the pain and all of the doubt and all of the fear that she had been holding onto as she laid back and enjoyed the gentle affection that her alpha lavished upon her.
The child would live a normal, muggle life, away from the ugliness of purebloods and mudbloods, away from the bitterness of its biological mother and father’s bloodlines.
She was pleasantly surprised that Draco became completely dedicated to fatherhood after Scorpius’s birth, all the while remaining a supportive husband.
Draco had to fight his mother, the house elves, and the slew of people his parents wanted to hire to do this and that for his nuptials to spend any time at all with his infant son.
