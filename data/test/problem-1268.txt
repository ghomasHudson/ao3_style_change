Tears were streaming down her face now, but Harry wasn’t ready to feel badly about it yet.
“Hermione’s written to Headmistress McGonagall about borrowing her pensieve. If you’re up to it, we can go to Hogwarts and pick it up.”
Harry hummed thoughtfully. “It’s different seeing it play out in front of you than it is to just remember it in your mind, I guess.”
Evidently, with everything that he’d been witness to since letting Draco back into his life, he should’ve expanded his imagination. Ginny popped out of the floo in the sitting room where Harry had curled on a couch chatting with Hermione and Andromeda. Quickly, she pecked them each on the cheek, then turned towards the kitchen door and hollered, “Dray-Dray!”
“Abe, nice to see you,” Harry beamed, feeling as though he couldn’t hold back the smile that wanted to split his face in two even if he wanted to.
“Right,” Harry repeated.
“I mean… I know you said you were fine with it all. But I didn’t know you felt quite
He’d worked with George all through August to get the shop back open, and had been over there helping him out several mornings a week through what Harry could remember of the fall. George cut him off with a sharp elbow in his ribs.
“I am a bit lost,” Harry said, his tone wavering between snarky and resigned. Something about that damned wrinkled nose made him want to press a kiss (which may or may not be welcome) to it.
“What about a film?”
,” she pleaded.
Smile faltering, Draco drew himself up proudly, “No I-” he faltered, taking a slow deep breath instead. “I… I’m afraid. I’ve been trying really hard not to be. To just be myself. Hermione keeps telling me that that was who you’d… well. That that’s the best course of action. But it’s hard to do when I’m so fucking…”
drunk. And yesterday was supposed to be an important day. But instead…”
“So what were you hollering about, then?”
With raised brows Longeman asked, “And one of the Auror healers has verified the memory loss is irreversible?”
“I told you, darling. He’s been hurt, but he’s going to be alright,” Andromeda said softly, sitting down at the foot of Harry’s bed.
“This came for you after you went up to bed last night,” Malfoy gestured to a thick envelope sealed with the Hogwarts crest which sat on the table next to a pile of textbooks. “I pulled out your books, as well. And Hermione left her recommended study schedule.”
wearing dress-trousers and a well-tailored deep green dress-shirt. He’d even thrown on a funky bowtie dotted with little golden snitches that fluttered their wings intermittently. But Draco. Draco looked like a prince. He was wearing fine wool trousers in a dark slate tone, a pearl-grey silk shirt, and a medium-grey sleeveless cloak with silver embroideries twining around the hems. Harry was ready to fall into his sparkling eyes.
“Do you know where we are?”
“Oh.”
Or at least, that’s what he told himself right up until his third and final day of mandated rest.
family. Draco’s family. Harry wondered about what Longeman had told him about Draco’s mother; he certainly wasn’t brave enough to probe into that any time soon.
“Fair bit,” Harry shrugged.
His second day home, Harry realized that pretending that he hadn’t been living in some form of domestic bliss with
“Oh.” Frowning, Harry thought this over, “
The look in Draco’s eyes told Harry he’d very much needed to hear those words.
“You alright?” Malfoy asked softly.
“’Arry,” Fleur chided gently, calling his attention back. She regarded him steadily with her cool blue eyes. “You’ve overcome far worse than this.”
Then Ginny dug her elbow into Harry’s side and with a mischievous smile questioned, “You like him, don’t you?”
Healer Cunningham looked to Niamh to deliver the news. Which was either a kindness to Harry or the shunting of a terrible burden to Niamh. Because once she was finished telling him, Harry realized that he has lost his life, irretrievably.
“Oh. And Ron?”
Shaking his head in bewilderment, Dudley said, “I used to wish I was magic, but with all the mad stuff that happens to you, I’ve changed my mind.”
With a chuckle that sounded as though there was a bit of a sob in there as well, Draco asked, “A real nap?”
“Molly was able to manage it just fine,” Draco swallowed heavily, looking uncertain.
“Longeman took Draco in for interrogation about your case today!” Ron yelled.
Harry allowed Kreacher to see the Auror out and headed back to the kitchen where he discovered Molly had whipped up a batch of chocolate and butterscotch cookies. So there was that, at least.
“Why would we keep these?” Harry asked, at a loss. Last he remembered he’d refused to subscribe to the
Molly and Arthur would take over in the evening. Molly would cook Harry dinner and tut over his low appetite. Arthur took a distraction tact, asking Harry all sorts of questions about muggle technology that he never knew the answers to anyhow.
“You weren’t meant to see these,” Malfoy’s tone was soft, his eyes focused on the papers.
Seeming to realize that the offer was at least partially stemming from pity, Malfoy narrowed his eyes and straightened his back. “You don’t need to do this. I’m fine with Pansy.”
The Weasley’s had always been there for Harry. They’d always been concerned for his safety (and not just because Ron’s safety tended to be tied to Harry’s). They’d always done their best to include him. But after the war, Harry had felt as though he ought to give them some distance. Some time to manage their grief. He couldn’t help but feel as though he was intruding whenever he’d come for dinner in the time that Harry could remember after the war. He couldn’t help but feel as if all their loss was his fault. He’d insisted on moving out of the Burrow and into his flat.
“Oh god, I swear Harry, Draco, I had no idea he was going to do this,” Hermione burst out, actually wringing her hands in her anxiety.
On impulse, he whispered, “Hi, mum.”
Harry, Malfoy, Hermione, and Ron sat around the table, staring at the pensieve Draco had just enlarged to the proper size. Next to it sat an open case filled with small glass vials. The moment felt momentous and no one seemed inclined to be the first to break the silence.
“No, Harry. I can’t.”
? No, Harry supposed. He could refuse to answer. Tell Malfoy to fuck off. He could lie.
Smiling in return, Harry looked back to the paper he still held. He turned it around so Malfoy could see the headline about their patronuses. “Is this true?”
“But you do, Mr. Potter. It is Auror policy to ensure that any high-risk victims are protected while investigations are ongoing. Luckily, you already live in a home with a Fidelius charm, though a somewhat compromised one, and the floo is open only to a few selected homes, which is adequate. We will also be placing an Auror at the front entry to your home for the foreseeable future. Prior to your discharge from the hospital a perimeter will be set up. You are not to leave your home alone at any point in time. You may request an Auror to accompany you or leave in the company of a fully-trained witch or wizard who has been cleared by our department only. Understood?”
known, or allowed himself to know, at least, during the last of his memories.
“Don’t be sorry,” Harry replied softly, desperately wishing that Kreacher would appear with the tea.
Gandalf barked excitedly at the door, his forked tail slapping Kreacher’s spindly legs. Another desolate knock sounded on the door.
Harry jumped the rest of the way out of bed and ignored the rushing sensation in his head. Fists clenched, he stomped up to Longeman, ready to assure him that he most certainly
Things that would have absolutely flattened him to discover about Malfoy at the start of this were already beginning to make perfect sense to Harry. It was as though he was assembling a puzzle of who Draco really was, and now that he’d gotten some of the key pieces in place, the rest of it fit perfectly.
brought the undeniable realization that it
“You’re welcome,” Ginny replied smugly, pressing a kiss to Harry’s cheek and standing up. “Now come inside before you worry Draco into a hernia.”
“And how are you feeling about that?” Niamh asked amusedly. “Not too overwhelming, I take it?”
“Not long before Christmas, you tried to test a method to destroy a dementor, and it went poorly. Malfoy was drained of magic, and very injured. You saved him, that time. You called Molly who treated his injuries. Unfortunately, you and Malfoy ended up on the front page of the Prophet, accompanied with a rather salacious article.”
It was his first day truly alone in weeks. And he desperately wanted to be alone. It was strange, because from what memories he had from last fall, he was rather lonely. But lately his house was never empty. At most he’d had a couple of hours to himself and usually he was too tired to do much more than sleep when he did. Hermione and Ron were there whenever they weren’t at work. Molly and Andromeda dropped in frequently to ensure he was being properly taken care of. And of course, there was Draco. His house was full of Draco. Which was more enjoyable than Harry would have expected, but still. Draco took up a lot of space. Not physically, really. But mentally. Emotionally.
Sorry for the delay in update everyone. I hope it hits the spot though! Consent is sexy friends ;)
Bastard.
“I’ll be fine.”
together and he’d feel sick. Pushing his fists into his eyes he’d work to tamp it all down, pretending that Hermione wasn’t right across the room looking at him with pity and waiting for him to be ready to hear more about the life that had been scrubbed from his brain.
He could feel panic welling up in him just watching this. Never mind that Draco was alive and well next to him. His warm hand in Harry’s.
Malfoy quirked an amused brow up at him. “I’ll give you interesting.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered. “For tonight.”
Harry looked up from his plate. “Why?”
“Well… He’d apologized to Hermione. And then went on some sort of apology campaign. And we worked together quite a bit on the logistics for taking down the dementors. Then we studied together to write the NEWTS cause he challenged them end of last year, rather than repeating the full school year. And we prepped for the Auror trainee written and physical exams as well.” Ron shrugged again, “I suppose it also helped that I whooped him during our first training duel. In the trainee program we’re paired up as partners, I’m actually hoping they might let us stay on together as proper partners once we’re done. We work well together.”
“You don’t really…”
“Yeah,” Harry rushed to say, trying to make up for how disconcerted he was. “Sure, that sounds good.”
“I know,” Ron said.
“No,” Malfoy smiled, eyes glimmering.
She pushed past Harry to cup Malfoy’s cheek and regard him fiercely. “You’re alright, then?”
He turned to leave the room, avoiding the pitying looks he knew Hermione and Ron were aiming at him. Without waiting, he poked his head towards the sitting room and then headed up to the drawing room which had similarly been repainted and furnished in clean, bright and comfortable items. The family tree tapestry was gone, the wall instead covered with photographs in mismatched frames. A lot of them Harry knew were previously hung on the wall of his flat, his friends had all helped him with the project before they headed back to Hogwarts for that optional year. Some of them were new, though. One of Malfoy holding Teddy tightly as they rode on a broom a few feet above the ground. Harry holding up their puppy like Simba in the opening scene of The Lion King. Harry, Ron, Hermione, George, Neville and Luna crowded in a pub booth with Draco and Pansy Parkinson. He shook his head and headed up the stairs.
“Next July,” Hermione replied. “You went dress shopping with me a couple of weeks ago. I’ll find the photograph and show it to you later, alright?”
“…I don’t want you to feel rushed or pressured into doing anything that you don’t want to do or aren’t ready for Harry. I can wait.”
“Remember an Auror will be outside of the door at all times until they arrest whoever attacked you, Harry.” Hermione said worriedly. “It’s Diggle at the moment, but a few different ones will rotate through. Proudfoot will be there, too. And you remember Zinnia Belmore? And Molly will be by after dinner to check on you.”
Bundled up in scarfs, they headed out as the sun began to set. Given the time of day, Oscar was allowed to come along and he swooped joyfully above them. Harry had decided his plan would go more smoothly if they could walk and not have to look at one another as they talked; he waited until they had found a good pace before he began.
Draco scoffed and poked Harry in the ribs. Harry wasn’t inclined to complain about, after the way Draco had dragged him up the stairs to his bed to return the favour a little while ago.
“You’ve got your follow-up appointment at Mungo’s tomorrow at nine. I’ve left the hour free if you’d like me to come.”
“Seems like.”
“Give me a tour?”
Dropping his head back against the couch, Harry grunted in response. Ron sat next to him and wrapped his arm around him, tugging until Harry rested his head against Ron’s shoulder instead.
“Harry, for Christ’s sake,” a voice grumbled. A deep breath, then, more gently, the voice said, “Harry. Harry, wake up.”
“Brilliant George,” Harry commended. Turning to Malfoy with a smirk he asked, “So you like muggle films, then? Can’t imagine I’d feel inclined to own this many.” Rental really was more practical.
“That was fucking awful.” He moved to stand. “I should go after him.”
was pointless. So he instead decided to obsess over every memory he had involving Malfoy, looking for clues of something more than vitriol between them. He started with that very first memory in Diagon Alley before their first year. Malfoy had insulted Hagrid, without a second thought.
“Yes, but you clearly can’t be trusted to spend more than a few hours to yourself,” George retorted, eyes sparkling. “Relax, mate. Can’t a fellow spend some time with his recently seriously injured friend without being accused of alternative motives?”

She was dressed in practical navy work robes with her hair pinned back into some semblance of control. Harry wanted to ask her to change back into jeans and a pullover and spend the day at Grimmauld with him.

Swallowing, Harry turned to Draco, who was now facing Annalise, though he didn’t look like he could hear a word she was saying. “We could leave,” Harry muttered.
“You,” he said, “are supposed to be the most brilliant witch of our age. You’ve figured out every other insane situation we’ve ever been in. You’re seriously telling me you can’t work it out?”
What Harry remembered most clearly were the feelings he’d seen playing out on his own face. The conflict of working with Draco shifting into admiration, trust, and more.
At this, Harry perked up, “I will be?”
“You and Draco had become good friends. It was developing into more than that. But Draco had an arranged marriage set up, and wasn’t ready to come out as gay himself. Regardless, you continued to work together, and you
But when the conversation on pickling had run its course, Arthur turned to Harry and asked, “Draco inside? I’ve got some new computer parts I need to show my favourite son-in-law!”
Stomach clenching, Harry tried to keep a smile on his face for the little boy. Last he could remember, Teddy was six months old. He could sit on his own, and giggle contagiously. But he certainly couldn’t run or climb or-
That one worked, a little at least. A nebulous silver mist flew out from Malfoy’s wand pushing back the dementor closest to him, then winding its way in between the other two creatures and Harry.
“Or you,” Harry remarked. “This whole thing hurts you just as much.”
“Probably back for some shit canteen food,” Ron replied. “He’s always a bit dramatic, isn’t he?”
“And I’m just a floo call away.”
Sighing, Harry ran a hand down his face. When he looked at Malfoy again he bore an expression of crushing disappointment. He’d clearly thought Harry didn’t want to be friends. A spark of anxiety ran through Harry. As insane as it was, he couldn’t stand the thought of upsetting Malfoy.
“Your appointment with Healer Brady went alright?” Draco asked worriedly.
A red bloom of swelling was spreading across his right cheek bone and up around his brow.
“Yes,” Malfoy drew himself up in affront before dropping his shoulders a little. “Also, I’m afraid I was rather rude to her when we first learnt of your condition. I feel badly about it.”
“Gin, I don’t know…” Draco wavered. “It’ll depend on how he’s feeling.”
Malfoy huffed and peeled his hands away from his eyes so he could look at Harry. They were watery and red-rimmed. “It’s not Ron I’m worried about.”
Harry’s tone of voice must’ve given away how unimpressed he was with the prospect of that endeavor, because Malfoy chuckled in that soft, low way. It was leagues away from the cutting, derisive laughs that Harry remembered from school. He found himself hoping he could hear more of it.
Malfoy immediately began pleading with Harry to get back up again. His face flickered between continued panic at Harry’s state and evident relief that the dementors were gone. He frantically searched his pockets for chocolate as Harry came to and realized just who was crouched over him.
Realizing that past-Malfoy was leaving them behind, they rushed to catch up. Harry kept a keen eye out for himself, and from a distance watched his past-self fall to his knees, three dementors swooping in to tower over him. The past Malfoy inhaled sharply, and looked up, seeming to sense the creatures. His eyes widened and he lost the umbrella to the wind, not bothering to try and catch it.
great on Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the nearly seven days since Malfoy had moved back in Harry hadn’t been at all certain what to call him. He’d dealt with it by avoiding calling him anything at all, which had been working alright. The name issue was just one of many tensions that continued to thrum between them. Another one at the top of the list was how attractive Harry found Malfoy.
Ron opened his mouth to respond but Hermione elbowed him in the ribs and asked, “Why do you think, Harry?”
Harry tucked a loose lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear, “No, really. It’s becoming clear why I fell for you.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened, “really?”
Long, platinum hair framed grey eyes and sharp features. Malfoy, for sure. The other man’s eyes widened and he pulled his hands away from Harry.
Re-emerging at the kitchen table, Harry took a deep, shuddering breath. Then he pushed to his feet with purpose and headed up the stairs to see if Draco was awake. Gandalf and Oscar, content and well fed, didn’t bother to trail after him.
“More of a lack of appetite,” Harry admitted.
Malfoy’s eyes widened for a second, before his smile broadened. “Yeah, that’s true. Pansy leaked it to get them off my back. She claimed she was worried that you might burn down the
“Yeah,” Draco smiled at Harry before letting it drop and heaving a sigh. “That wasn’t exactly helpful though, was it?”
Really? That was interesting.
“Hullo,” Harry said, heading straight for the kettle.
Draco looked shocked at the possibility. “Of course not. But I’d much rather wait until you’re comfortable with it. I want to take things as slowly as you need. You haven’t gotten anywhere near the memories of those steps in our relationship, and… there’s no pressure, really, Harry.”
“Ron was out of line.”
“Oh,” Draco looked shocked. “I was so… I was so messed up I didn’t even think about how of course they would talk to Kreacher. How did I not even realize that they would in the last few weeks though? Merlin, I’m going to be a terrible Auror… Damnation, Longeman already hated me. That’s why he’s been…
“So how’s it been?” She shifted her eyes towards Malfoy as though concerned that Harry may not answer honestly with him present.
“Yes,” Harry said, “Let’s take Gandalf for a walk before dinner and I’ll tell you all about it. We can get some dinner while we’re out or something.”
Smiling softly, Draco said, “You made the lights flicker.”
It was a rare, sunny day, and after nodding to Proudfoot at the front door, they headed off with the excitable puppy. In absolute silence. The silence vacillated somewhere between comfortable and brittle for what felt like ages. Harry scraped the depths of his mind for a conversation starter but came up blank every time. Draco intently studied strangers as they walked past.
“Harry,” he said, voice raw. He sat up, clearing his throat. Harry realized he was wearing dark green silk pajamas.
of you that brought us together.”
Flushing red, Harry muttered, “Well, thanks for your approval.”
“We first met when you and Malfoy brought everyone in on your charm to destroy the dementors. She definitely… intrigued me. Then for months we’d see each other at different events and whatnot. I didn’t think I was ready for anything like that though, y’know?” He smiled dreamily to himself. “Then at Halloween she walked right up to me and said that she was done with waiting for me to make the first move.”
Harry tightened the arm he had wrapped around Draco’s waist and pressed his face more firmly against his shoulder blade. At some point in the night, they’d reversed positions. Harry had fallen asleep with Draco spooned up behind him, holding him as though he never wanted to let go. It was pretty fucking wonderful, if Harry were being honest.
He felt a little swoop of joy in his chest at the thought.
Malfoy smiled broadly, “I’ll help you with Potions when you get there, if you’d like.”
“Ah,” Harry wrinkled his nose, “too bad.”
He’d have made some for Draco too, if he didn’t like to wait till after his combat class to eat.
Longeman ignored Draco entirely. “Of course, Mr. Potter, we still recommend you bring a trusted and trained wizard or witch along with you when you are outside of your home. Given that your home has a fidelius charm on it, we don’t believe you will be in any form of danger at your home, and it seems unlikely that maintaining an Auror guard at your doorstep will lead us to apprehending the assailant at this point in time.”
Shame washed over Harry. His eyes landed on the tabletop. “Yes, Niamh.”
been easy. Do you think that I gave up my heritage, my mother, easily? On a passing whim? No! I did it because I am committed to you. To our relationship.”
A helpless whimper sounded from across the room, reminding Harry that
After hours of circular conversation (where they’d ruled out several people on their
At some point over the last weeks, Draco had fallen into the habit (or perhaps picked it back up, Harry realized with a tinge of melancholy) of bringing them home take-out from a delicious neighbourhood Indian place called Zaika’s every Friday. The rest of the week, Harry threw something together from the ingredients in their well-stocked pantry and cold-room. Kreacher did the groceries, and seemed keenly attuned to Harry’s tastes and typical meal repertoire.
(See the end of the chapter for
He paused to catch his breath and Harry, biting painfully into his lower lip, watched him anxiously, still unable to think of what to say.
Recognizing that they must be getting near, Harry began to scan the crowded signs of the alley.
“I mean, I’ve done nothing but fuck up. And I know this is hard for you. I don’t want you to feel forced to keep trying, is all…”
When Harry had first arrived home and was house-bound Ron had been taking the crup out for his daily walk. Otherwise, Kreacher made sure that the pup made it out into the garden when he needed. Then, there had been those few days after Harry was allowed to leave his home, but before Draco had moved back in when Harry would go out with Gandalf and whomever was around to accompany him. But since Draco had moved back in, he’d been taking the lead with walking Gandalf. Harry wasn’t sure if that was the habit they’d had before, or if it was just that Draco needed an escape. Either way, he hadn’t felt quite right about inviting himself along.
“Who’s that one from, then?”
ran a little questionnaire through the Ministry, literally all the aurors want you and your parents in Azkaban. Who really sent the bodyguard, Draco? You can’t be holding out on me, you’ve got to be smarter than that.”
. The instant the words left his mouth Draco froze, his confession hanging thick in the air between the two. He was too terrified to look at them, to see the pity shining in their eyes, and he stood up to bolt for the door of the pub, tightly gripping his coat in one hand and his wand in the other as if they could pull him out of this mess he had made, but suddenly there’s a weight on his arm slowing him down.
A murmur spread through the
“It’s fine,” he managed, waving dismissively as he willed his flush to go away. “Just unexpected.”
The courtroom had shifted into a solemn silence, and Draco’s the one to finally break their gaze and look to the floor again; they were right, it was all he said, even when he was told to stand watch so Bellatrix could torture Granger in ways he didn’t want to think about. “If he hadn’t lied for me, looked his parents and Voldemort’s second-in-command right in the eye and said I wasn’t Harry Potter, I would’ve been killed that day. Probably like the moment he identified me I would’ve been hit with the killing curse or a
“You shouldn’t touch things that you have no business interfering with, Mister Ferlet sir.” Merlin, Potter was using the same sass from Hogwarts on a senior auror now. “It’ll wear off in an hour. Now if you’ll excuse us.” He could see Potter stand up and toss a few muggle bills down, mimicking them but keeping his head bowed towards the table, and he stepped out only when he felt their hand on his upper back guiding him out from his side of the benches. He kept his face turned downwards as they left the pub but the room was missing that warm feeling from before, the only sound being their footsteps on the worn boards, and he could feel eyes following them both as they left, even after they stepped outside.
“I want him as a regular, not you,” she said primly, and then she disappeared from sight as Potter sighed, cheeks pink with what Draco assumed was a blush.
“More or less. It’s a bit quiet without my father being around,” Draco found himself admitting with a shrug. “Got my first Howler from after the trial a few days ago, that was exciting.”
expected. The next day there’s a second session, and the morning before then I had an auror appear at the manor spouting heroics about how he was my Ministry-assigned guard.”
The morning that Draco was scheduled to get dinner with Pansy, another unfamiliar owl showed up at his window, tapping insistently just as the sun was beginning to come up. He flicked the pane up with a wandless spell, groggily taking the envelope from their beak and reading it over almost four times before his eyes could focus properly and decipher the hurried scribbles on the page.
Saviour Potter was quiet for a moment, and Draco looked up just enough to see their eyes glaze over slightly, a hand running through their unruly hair before falling back into their lap. “So, the Snatchers,” they started, and there was something hesitant in their voice. “They were sort of like bounty hunters almost, during the war. They’d roam around everywhere, looking for muggle-borns or - or people that were like openly speaking out against Voldemort, and generally they’d catch them and bring them back to him to be dealt with.”
They’d begun to follow Annalise to their table when Draco stopped abruptly, causing Harry, who was holding onto his hand once more, to stumble over his feet. When he glanced back in concern, it was to find Draco struggling to mask a look of shock with an indifferent demeanor. Harry followed his gaze to Narcissa Malfoy, dressed in an even more refined fashion than Draco, sitting alone at a table for two. She was draining the last sip of wine from her glass, and as she went to set it down, she glanced up to find the three of them staring at her.
, though there was an occasional
Harry’s voice made the man jump.
“I didn’t mean to hurt him,” Malfoy said after a minute. “Just got carried away. I was angry.” He took a deep breath and added, “About everything.”
Ron shrugged. “You fell in love with him,” he said, as though it were really that simple.
Malfoy pulled out his wand, “Here.” He drew a circle around the spot, murmuring a spell Harry couldn’t catch and a cool tingling spread across Harry’s back.
Draco let his hands fall to his side, chest heaving. Harry felt himself soften, just a little. But not enough to let go of his anger.
“Well
Pansy snickered, then turned to Hermione to ask about wedding plans.
“I am,” George sounded a little surprised about it himself. “She makes me laugh. Helps me out with the shop too. She’s got a brilliant mind for business, which you know, was more of Fred’s side of things.”
Chuckling, Harry said, “You definitely should be. I’m proud to be able to say I’ve played with you.”
remember to living together, sleeping together, presumably
Malfoy flushed, “Thank you for giving me a chance, Harry.”
Never mind that it was only half seven. If he didn’t get away from Malfoy, and Hermione and Ron, and their condescending but regretful faces he would say something
The line was clearly rehearsed. Harry looked to Malfoy, who was evidently as surprised as he was. He looked rather worse for the wear, pale with purple smears beneath his eyes. He took a few steps past Ron towards Harry, reaching his hand out before letting it flutter back down.
Rather than reply, Niamh began to cast her diagnostic charms. After a moment she said, “Well, your vitals are still strong. How’ve you been feeling?”
Malfoy met Harry’s eyes for a long, aching moment, then stepped further back into the hallway. “Right. That’s good. I’m just going to take Gandalf out for a bit, then. Goodnight.”
“He’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It’s been fucking weird. I’m definitely more easily tired, which is frustrating. But the headaches have been happening less often, and they’re less intense when I get them.”
” Before it had finished the first word he had to clap his hands over his ears, the sound almost deafening in the small room. He swore the furniture was shaking. “
“With you it does.” Ignoring his help she straightened her dress and choker, fluffing out her bangs and hair, nodding towards the muggle in their midst. “What are we doing with him? Can’t just let him go.” At that, the man’s eyes grew wide and he struggled, muffled sounds escaping past the cloth gag, Pansy’s lips curving up into a predatory smile Draco hadn’t seen in a long time. “You know, rivers are running pretty wild this time of year, could make our lives easier.”
to remove most of the tea from his sweater. “You just caught me off guard.” He stood up, brushing past her after only the lavender tea’s smell remained on his clothes, eyeing the three owls hesitantly. “What are these all about? None of them look familiar.”
For the first time in a long time, Draco was speechless. “All the stuff you said about my parents, Hermione, Ron and his family, none of us ever did anything to you except exist, which you seemed to take offense at. You called Hermione that vile name, you were always rude to Ron because he wasn’t from the same sort of family as a conceited prick like you, Malfoy you sent a bloody snake at me when we were twelve! You helped Umbridge torture students! I bet you’ve actually been in Neville’s nightmares because of how much of a fucking monster you are, you’re one of the most awful people I’ve ever met, Malfoy, and I do mean that.”
Their words stung but only because at one point they were true, and they both knew it. He ignored the insult and stirred his drink with the straw, watching the ice cubes slowly starting to dissolve, and when he spoke next his heart was in his throat because they were so, so close to getting to the point, the problem of it all. “I don’t hate you.” The words came out so quietly that he could barely hear himself over the ambient sounds in the pub, and he could already sense Potter’s further confusion. “I haven’t hated you since the end of fifth year, actually. Blame your trip to the Hall of Mysteries.”
Waves of nausea crashed into him head-on and he tried to stay standing but after the first gag burned his throat, his breakfast threatening to come back up, he sank to his knees on the tile. It was disgusting, he was nearly leaning against a toilet in a public restroom, his trousers dragged across the filthy paneling, but he couldn’t find the energy to move. Draco was convinced his body had forgotten how to breathe, he was desperately sucking in as much air as he could and still the edges of his vision had started to turn dark, and his heart was pounding in his chest like a beast in a cage, wild and panicked and
It seemed as if they wanted to argue then thought better of it, opening and closing their mouth silently. “I would write an answer before the owl flies off,” the auror said finally, slipping their wand back into the sleeve of their robes and shrugging. “Since all of yours have been temporarily confiscated.”
“Harry!” a female voice shouted, then a girl that looked only a few years younger than either of them came running out, long black ponytail trailing behind her as she flew past him, knocking Potter off-balance in a massive bear hug. “It’s been so long, mum’s going to be thrilled to see you, ugh you can’t just abandon us like that!”
. His fingers twisted into a painful knot in his lap, and Draco was terrified to breathe too loudly for fear of setting off whatever potential explosion seemed to be lingering in the air.
, and they wore a black leather jacket that stole more of his sanity the longer he stared at it, until Draco cleared his throat quietly and they looked up. “Hello,” he said, awkwardly twisting his hands together behind his back. The rectangular, wooden table had four chairs at it, two on each side, and suddenly he wasn’t too sure about sitting directly across from Saint Potter.
Saviour Potter paused to take a deep breath, eyes flicking over again, and this time Draco didn’t bother trying to hide his staring. “Mister and Mrs. Malfoy came running the moment Bellatrix started her screeching about who we might be, and she told them to get Malf- Draco,” they corrected quickly. “So he came into this grand-looking room the Snatchers had apparated us into, and they’ve got Ron and Hermione off to the side, Bellatrix has got this hunch that I’m, well, that I’m Harry Potter, so she’d taken it upon herself to keep track of me. I could barely see anything, I’d shoved my glasses into my pocket just before they’d got us and my face was puffed up enough to force one of my eyes closed, um, but there was a bit where she pushed up my hair, made him look me over, like really look at me-”
“So, Malfoy, how’ve you been? Have you looked more into the Healer program?”
Well fuck, now Potter was making him cry, small trembles of shock and relief traveling through his body as a few stray, silent tears slipped down his cheeks, falling onto his fingers that were painfully contorted together. And, despite it all, there was a part of him that wanted to smile when they admitted to not hating him after everything that had happened.
“Excuse me? You are virtually on house arrest; may I ask why?”
Just as they opened their mouth to reply, Amber sashayed up, setting a steaming mug in front of them both and handing Draco a red, laminated menu. “Here you go Draco, I’ll give you a few minutes to get... acquainted,” she purred with another wink, waving as she vanished towards the kitchens.
He made a face, offering her a bent arm instead of a hand. “Not everything has to be about him.”
“Yeah, well, I signed up for it, didn’t I?” He could see their eyes shift down to his bare forearms, where his Death Eater tattoo was on full display, and moved that arm down to his lap. “Since we’re playing 20 questions, it’s my turn. What’s with the magic on your hand?”
and allow yourself to be questioned, or your side of things will remain untold to this court.”
Draco raised his head, and it took a moment for him to process the hand Potter was holding out towards him. “I don’t understand,” he said slowly.
“We both know that’s a load of bullshit.” Pansy looked unimpressed, swirling the red wine in her glass gently before sipping at it. “
“...I don’t understand.” They were staring at him with obvious confusion and Draco’s anxiety skyrocketed further. “I really do think you could’ve said anything, anything that was true no matter how ridiculous it would’ve sounded, and you would’ve been released. Voldemort lived in your house for a while, if that’s not threatening and blackmail I don’t know what would be, what could you possibly say that’s considered oversharing?”
Draco felt like an idiot for forgetting about that part of the world. “I - okay.” He ignored the surprise on their face from his easy acceptance, nodding. “I have literally no idea about anything muggle, but I - I am willing to try it,” he said hesitantly.
echoed in the back of his mind.
They’re both silent for a moment, and he had to remind himself that this was all going on as friends - not anything more, not like the date he wished it was. Potter - no,
Oh fuck, he knew exactly where this was going. It suddenly dawned on him that her smile looked more predatory than his first impression suggested and Draco swallowed hard, leaning back in the stiff-backed chair in an attempt to brace himself. He had been stupid, so stupid, all of the petty harassment that was completely unwarranted was now coming back with an added vengeance. An Azkaban-like chill settled into his bones as the witch resumed her questioning.
He started for the bathroom door next, staring intently at its dulling metal handle as his body went through the motions of walking, and just as his pulse was starting to rise into worrying levels again his fingertips connected with the door handle. “Man up. Don’t be a pansy,” he mumbled to himself, and then he pulled the door open, carefully moving between tables and customers and trying to remember to keep breathing as he did.
There was a moment of silence in the room, and Draco felt as if it would smother him. “Mister Potter,” someone said, disrupting the quiet in an irritatingly bright tone, and he recognized the voice with an inward groan. It was the same witch that had been leading most of the trial, and he resisted the urge to roll his eyes as she cleared her throat again. “Do you have any ideas as to why she concealed such... essential information from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
“What?” Draco replied, an edge to his voice.
He was sat amongst fourteen people who he could call family.
Harry shrugged, “I mean, I imagine if it’d all happened a couple of years later Hermione would’ve made sure it was exposed. As it was, we were twelve and Lockhart’s brain was so muddled that there wouldn’t even be a chance to identify who his victims were anyways.”
A young woman who, though blurry, had a kind look to her approached Harry.
Harry was now caught up on his memories into mid-January. Watching the memory of Draco apologizing to Ginny (one of Ginny’s few) made him even more grateful for the friend they had in her. He’d watched (embarrassingly) Luna’s memory of New Year’s Eve when Harry had gotten drunk and come out to her and then (even more embarrassingly) Draco’s memories of running into each other that evening and Draco returning to his flat the following morning. A series of Draco’s memories included conversations that dealt with past wrongs, and fights that had clearly stemmed from Harry’s rapidly growing feelings for Draco.
Harry took a few more steps until he stood over Draco. “What if I don’t want to wait? What if I don’t need to take things slowly?”
“Unacceptable.” His professor was positively glowering now. “I haven’t managed to maintain a Defense Against the Darks Arts professor for longer than a year and you and I, Potter, had a deal.”
Damn George for forgetting about this until hours after he’d left Grimmauld Place. An owl (an orange and purple feathered owl no less – apparently George had bred them specifically to do WWW’s deliveries) had shown up at Harry’s window an hour ago with a pleading letter and a crude drawing of the prototype that Harry had supposedly agreed to store for him weeks ago. Oscar, who apparently never met another living creature he didn’t immediately take to, greeted the owl with ecstatic cooing and wing flapping.
“Yes,” Harry flushed.
A blinding light infiltrated his left eye and Harry let out a low groan. Judging by his physical state and the well-lit
“Would you just sod off?” Harry snapped. “I’ll do them soon as I’m done with this.”
“Sure,” Harry nodded, as Hermione wrapped her arm around his shoulders and guided him over to an apparition point.
“He’s an arse.”
“Didn’t think this position through,” Draco shuddered. “Are you still feeling okay?”
“No,” Malfoy’s lips pursed disapprovingly, though his eyes betrayed some humour. “We both happened to be rather interested in one another’s childhoods –
Harry let Ron and Hermione lead the way, trailing after them. The hallway was bright, painted a light cream, with sun streaming in from a window above the door that hadn’t existed before. A series of whimsical magical creature themed hooks were set into the wall, a burgundy cloak hung on one of them. There was a pine bench on the opposite wall, with the notorious troll leg umbrella stand next to it. Overall the hallway seemed as though it might have been widened, but perhaps that was just the benefit of light and a good paint job.
“Game of chess?” Draco asked, mirroring one of the memories Harry had watched. Draco had woken him from a nightmare after they’d fallen asleep researching late into the night. Draco had assured Harry that he would thrash him at the game.
(See the end of the chapter for
“To remember?” Harry’s brows flew up incredulously.
“If you ask me how I’m doing,” Harry interrupted flatly, “I’m going to scream.”
They stood together in silence for a while before Harry said, “We’ve dinner at the Burrow tonight, why don’t we go have a nap first?”
“Naïve of me to begin to believe that you had some compassion for how shite this situation is for me and actually cared about someone other than yourself,” Harry remarked bitterly.
“Yup.”
“Well,” she continued with a little shrug, “if you’d seen your loved ones over the last several days maybe you’d see it as more important.”
“Oh,” Harry said enthusiasm beginning to bubble up over his confusion. “Well that sounds brilliant. I’d love to teach here.”
Draco puttered around the kitchen, pulling different ingredients and tools out. Often, he had to go back into cupboards when he realized there was something else he needed.
“Yes, Draco. I remember that much, at least.”
don’t want to feel badly, myself, for that matter. It’s no one’s fault but hers that things are this way... It’s hard not to feel badly, is all.”
All he wanted was to go for a run by himself, like he would usually do to cope with his stress. The rhythmic pounding of his feet on the ground always sorted his thoughts out for him. Pushing himself to run past his limits always left him feeling elated. The cold air cleansed the tight anxiety from his chest. The lengthening and contracting of his muscles loosened and relaxed him. Despite his ill-advised memory binge on Tuesday, Harry was back to feeling healthy and full of energy.
He hadn’t meant for it to sound quite as pathetic as it did, but there it was. Harry was well aware that the last week hadn’t been any easier on Malfoy than it was for him. He stared hard at the wall of newspapers between them. Long fingers closed warmly around his wrist, and Malfoy called his name softly. He waited for Harry to meet his eyes once more before he said, “I won’t.”
When Teddy crawled to the ground to run around imitating different animals, she asked Harry how he was feeling.
In the last couple of weeks, Harry had watched Draco and Ron play enough rapid-fire games of chess to know he’d never have a chance against Draco.
“Thanks,” Draco said, before heaving a meaningful sigh. “Harry, if you’re going to insist that Kreacher not help in the kitchen, could you at least make sure that the dishes don’t pile up in the sink like this?”
“Well it’s not exactly easy to see.” Harry snapped, irritated that Malfoy was judging him. “And it’s not as though I need to look at my back to give it a wash. I only noticed now because I was trying to reach- ah, er…”
Raucous giggles erupted from Teddy, which Harry couldn’t help but join in. Who knew Malfoy had a playful side? Dromeda had laid out all the sandwich fixings – two types of bread, turkey, ham, roast beef, and salami, three types of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and little pots of condiments down the table. Malfoy carried Teddy along the length in one arm and dutifully added each ingredient as Teddy pointed insistently to every single option on the table.
He swallowed the knot in his throat before taking a sip of tea.
Despite the time Harry had spent analyzing his memories of Malfoy, he’d tried not to think too much on the reality that the Malfoy of present times was out there somewhere, staying away on the recommendation of Harry’s healers. Of course, in the back of his mind he’d known that the Malfoy factor of this all wasn’t something he could push off forever. But it was certainly more comfortable to think that Harry was the only one affected by this.
Draco blinked at him, “You… you called me your partner.”
attacked Harry. But then, Harry supposed, they Aurors would hardly let him stick around at his bedside. Maybe it was only accidentally Malfoy’s fault and so he felt badly and was trying to make up for it by sticking around the hospital. Harry wished he wouldn’t, if that were the case. His presence was hardly a comfort.
Harry forced his eyes open all the way, “It was nice.”
His heart flipped over and he took a moment to appreciate the clean peppermint smell before noticing hints of something sharper.
” A voice, only a little familiar, asked with an edge of desperation.
Turning back to Draco, Harry said, “Ron could come with me, maybe? It doesn’t seem like it’ll be a pleasant one for you.”
he could perceive around him, he was at St. Mungo’s. He didn’t move, fearing the sensations that would come with turning his head for a better look around.
“Alright then,” Longeman gritted his teeth. “Any particular names of those who might bear grudges from the war?”
He sighed a heavy sigh and belatedly introduced himself to Harry as Healer Cunningham. If your name includes the word
Following Longeman’s departure Harry had flooed Ron and Hermione to come over. They’d arrived within seconds, Ron holding a pot of stew. Evidently they’d been waiting on tenterhooks to hear how the meeting with Longeman had gone.
Harry must have looked off colour at the thought of it because Hermione said, “Or a good old fashioned cab?”
” Hermione hissed. It was the one curse she really couldn’t tolerate. “But really, Ronald. What were you thinking?”
A slight movement caught his eye, and Harry turned towards his left. The air shimmered and George Weasley appeared, grinning mischievously.
And that was the whole of their conversation.
“I really don’t know that you could’ve,” Harry said dubiously.
He’d seen them together twice since returning home. That morning after he’d invited Malfoy to move back in and then the other night for dinner. They seemed to have an easy camaraderie between them, something that Harry, with his miniscule amount of relationship experience, figured was rather important.
“George had to help us with some finnicky spell work to get it functioning. This house is so old that the getting the electronics working alongside the ingrained magic was much more difficult than at your muggle flat.”
“Watching those memories is…” Harry waved his hand helplessly towards Draco, “it’s not good for you.”
They walked to Diagon Alley, Harry grateful as he never thought he’d be for the damp chill in the air. He felt brilliant. Back to new. His headache was gone. The tension in his shoulders was loosening with each quick step forwards. Hermione was rushing to catch up to him. Thankfully, she had been approved by the Ministry to escort Harry outside of the house (in addition to every member of the Weasley family, Andromeda, and Draco Malfoy – despite Longeman’s suspicions).
Draco, though blushing, kept his composure fairly well and declared, “You’re lucky there’s no one but Aberforth in here right now or I’d curse the mouth of every one of you shut.”
“Sometimes,” Draco fixed him with haughty look.
Harry shrugged, “We’ll figure it out.”
Now, looking at the photographs of those last months, Harry grieved. For this bizarre, insane twist that his life had taken- with Malfoy. That he couldn’t remember. Seeing evidence of what
As he neared the landing for the floor just below their rooms, Harry slowed. He could hear Draco’s footsteps and he wasn’t at all sure how he wanted to approach this. Draco’s feet, covered in too large, knit socks came into view from above, followed by the rest of him, looking just a little soft and sleepy.
Most were editions of the
Harry turned this over in his mind, not sure that he did understand at all. “I don’t think this is how I’d like to go about remembering,” he said firmly.
“Two evenings after the first memory.”
Turning off the kettle that Harry had forgotten all about, Malfoy let Harry prep the memory.
“Ouch! Haven’t I been assaulted enough recently?”
Was it obvious that they were still a little uncomfortable together? Was it obvious that Harry was getting closer to falling properly in love with Draco? Or that he was holding back because he was scared by how quickly his feelings were developing? Maybe they could tell that Harry and Draco were both feeling uneasy about the task they were headed towards.
“You really didn’t mind it,” Malfoy said. “You told me you were sort of enjoying studying without any pressing life or death situations distracting you.”
Longeman continued, “We have no other leads at this point in time.” The Auror’s eyes drifted significantly towards Draco and Harry clenched his jaw. “Given that it has now been one month since your assault with no further signs of malicious behaviour towards you, Mr. Potter, we will be removing the Auror detail from your house.”
They landed in a dark alleyway, where their past-selves were going over the plan they’d made to trap the dementors one last time. Looking between them, Harry wasn’t sure whether the past or current version of Draco looked more anxious.
Feeling as though he had a cheerful soundtrack playing in the background of his life, Harry practically skipped down to the hospital’s floo network and surprised Andromeda and Teddy with a visit. Teddy, he figured, would make for a good companion whilst Harry felt effervescent with joy.
Harry and Draco had become more comfortable with one another. Not comfortable enough to progress in their relationship, mind (even though Harry was beginning to wish they would). Just comfortable enough to be crabby with each other when they were stressed. Which, as Harry’s assault was now nearly a full month ago, was just about constantly.
“We were having a fight the night you were attacked. Over… fuck, I don’t even know,” Draco dragged his hands down his face. “We were both just tired and grouchy, I think. You said you needed some time and went out for your run. And then…” Draco’s voice broke.
Hearing Ron repeatedly say ‘Draco’ rather than ‘Malfoy’ and talk about their old nemesis as though they were genial left Harry feeling yet again like he’d woken in an alternate universe. On entering the kitchen, though, Harry forgot all about that.
“Nearly better,” Harry said though he could hardly feel it’s true given that he still had no memories. He realized with an uncomfortable lurch in his gut that by that definition he would probably never be better.
Draco sat on the edge of Harry’s bed without hesitation. Never mind that they’d hardly spoken since Friday.
Reaching the door to Madam Malkin’s Harry pushed it open and looked around. In response to the bell on the door tingling cheerfully, a young blonde woman emerged from a room in the back.
After a murmur of agreement, Draco said, “There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you, actually. Erm… are you wanting to look at the memories of us progressing, uh,
“Just family owls,” Draco shrugged. “But I always wanted a crup, didn’t I Gandalf?”
Dudley ignored the slight thrum of discomfort in the room and smacked a large hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Ginny’s game the following day was a welcome distraction. Harry and Draco both pulled the hoods of their cloaks over their heads as a half-hearted disguise while they wove their way through the chattering crowd – each member dressed either in the Harpies forest green or Puddlemere’s blue. On reaching their private box, Harry heaved a sigh in relief and pulled his hood off, beaming at the full gamut of Weasleys already present. Draco had insisted that they arrive at the last minute in order to limit Harry’s exposure to the chaos and noise of the pitch.
He knew what the auror saw: a sniveling, trembling, cowardly excuse of a Death Eater, knees dusted with grime from the bathroom tile, having to lean on the walls to stay on his feet. A disgusting waste of air and space, really; he wouldn’t blame them for saying so out loud. Draco watched as their eyes looked him up and down, finally settling onto his face. “Are you alright?” they asked quietly, and they had their hands out like they were preparing to catch him if he fell.
” and Draco somehow gathered the strength to stand just as the lock on the stall clinked open.
glancing between him and Potter, speaking behind their hands. Head lifting a little more now that he didn’t feel quite as persecuted, his eyes sought out Potter’s emerald ones, again steadily holding their gaze for a few breaths.
He scoffed, adopting the smirk that used to feel more like a second skin but now felt unnatural. “I’m flattered that you think I could slip myself a potion that sneakily, but you’re wrong. I was vomiting for the next few hours after our little meeting, Potter, perhaps you’re the one actually trying to get rid of me.”
They had been dead, they had
“Me?!” they said indignantly, sitting up a little more. “He’s the one that hasn’t picked up the menu because he’s been talking so much!”
“Yeah, understandable.”
Something about their retelling of events stuck with him, gnawing and twisting at his insides that made the tremor return to his hands, and Draco quickly moved them into his lap beneath the table. “So, you did actually die then,” he said quietly, raising an eyebrow. “It was the full thing, right? Heart stopped, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move, all of it? You were really dead?”
“Draco? What - what happened?” He could hear the start of panic setting into their voice. “You’ve turned pale, are you okay? Draco?”
Draco laughed at that, pushing his sleeves up to his elbows so he could lean comfortably on the table edge, and he could feel some of the other guests turn to look. “Don’t you remember who I am, Potter? I was almost killed by an auror in the Ministry’s main hall the morning of my trial, they’re not going to be too eager to help me. Supposed Death Eater and all.”
Potter returned the smile with an added shrug. “It’s my job at this point.” Then they apparated away, vanishing with a quiet pop, and Draco’s expression softened when he realized they had left behind their cloak, gathering the warm, Potter-scented robes closer around himself as a chilled night breeze stirred up the leaves around his feet.
; the only things that were different were the lack of Hogwarts aesthetics in the room, his black jumper had replaced his school uniform, and there was no Potter storming in to slice his skin to ribbons and leave him on the floor for dead.
, but the way the cover and spine were worn with time suggested it had been read more than once.
. Draco hadn’t thought it possible, but he was digging himself into an even deeper hole than before.
“There hasn’t been a delivery to the manor in over six months,” Draco replied over his shoulder, moving again and pulling down a silver-edged teacup and saucer. It was the only surviving remnant of a dish set that had been given to his parents on their wedding day; it was also the only thing in the house from his childhood that had lived through the war, and just feeling the worn metal beneath his thumb settled some of his nerves about the trial. “Last I checked, the Ministry has confiscated and been opening all of my family’s mail.” The kettle was already on the stove from the night before and he refilled it with a flick of his wand and a mumbled “
again let alone hear them defending him, a Death Eater.
The witch smiled triumphantly down at Draco before turning her attention back to Potter, looking as if she had made some grand revelation to the courtroom, and he can feel the glares from the
Once the worst of the nausea had passed he raised his head, looking up to Aedan in time to see something like understanding flicker across their face. “Draco, you - if my -” They seemed to be searching for the right words and he let them, his heavy breath the only sound in the bathroom. “I would be sick as well if I found out my fiancé died,” the auror said finally, and their words sank into his gut in an ugly way.
There was another round of silence at that, and he actually let himself relax into it. The drafty bar was growing on him and it made him miss the dungeons of Hogwarts, and the mutual secret-telling had cleared some of the air enough to nearly make him smile at nothing. He took another sip from the vodka cran, this time pinning the straw to the rim of his glass before lifting it.
He heard a rustle as they spun towards him, then footsteps as they followed, and the front door quietly clicked shut. Draco assumed they had used magic to guide it closed, going to one of the tall, mounted cupboards, pausing with his hand on the handle as the man spoke. “I was sent to watch over you during the length of your hearing, under order of the Minister of Magic himself. Have you.... Have you received any owls or mail, recently?”
“You were more than decent at potions, Malfoy.” There’s a seriousness in their voice that throws him off for a second. “Snape didn’t just love you because you were in Slytherin, you were brilliant at them, Hermione wouldn’t shut up about how she beat your O.W.L. score for Potions by only 5 points.”
. By the time they’ve both somehow finished their food the sun was starting to go lower in the sky, clouds tinged pink and gold out the front windows.
Merlin, was Potter really giving the
“I don’t know what you mean. I was cleared, obviously.”
“So, you’re right about the fact that he’s been an absolute nightmare for a while now.” He expected it but Potter’s words still hurt like a soft punch to the gut, making him wince silently. “Literally from day one we were sort of at each other’s throats, I was famous because of what happened to me, he was famous because of his family name, and I didn’t know that going in so I didn’t - I wasn’t scared of him for it or something like that, I’m not exactly sure. But. He did save my life, like I’ve emphasized for the past fifteen minutes, and we’re really - really, we’re kind of even, I’ve done some stuff to him too. I - I’ve accidentally used a spell to basically stab him, I’ve left one of his best friends to die in a room of
“Did he repeatedly call your close friend, Miss Granger, a mudblood simply because she was born to muggle parents?”
His eyes were snapped to the other side of the room as Shacklebolt stood, already seated high above the rest of the
Instantly it flew out of his hands, transforming into a mouth that screamed at him, hovering in line with his shoulders as it spoke. “
“I know what I want,” Draco said calmly, and they both looked at him as if he was speaking in tongues. “Lamb biryani and a butter naan please.” He held out the menu and Amber nearly snatched it from his hand, giving Potter a pointed glare.
He kept his comments about changing the wards to himself, holding the restaurant door open for her with a slight bow, and he silently cast a concealment charm over the blossoming, reddish-purple mark starting to form on her porcelain neck. “Yes, mother.” She didn’t need to look at him in order to give his head a healthy smack with her purse and he winced, smiling despite the new ache in his temple. It felt good - it felt like he was normal again, and he found it easier than expected to push the trial, Potter, all of it out of his mind for the rest of the night.
“Yes.”
The morning after that fiasco of a hearing, Draco received an owl for the first time since the war had ended. He had been sitting at the desk in his room, attempting to read whatever trash they decided was worthy of printing in
He maneuvered around the other customers and tables until he was standing on the opposite side of the Boy Who Lived, Aedan following closely behind. Potter was reading a book he hadn’t heard of, something named
“Sure thing...” She was scribbling it all down even as she followed Potter to a table on the back wall, chewing on her lower lip. “You know we might even get snow on Wednesday.”
“Mister Ferlet.” He watched Potter give the man Draco assumed was standing to his left a curt nod, expression neutral. “I’m here on auror business, actually, on orders from the Minister.”
“Congratulations, Draco.” He twisted to see Aedan settle into the seat next to him, looking particularly pleased. “I ran into Mister Potter on his way out, he told me you are to be cleared after the next hearing, that is very good news.”
Draco snorted, swirling his glass to melt the remains of the cube. “I assume it will be in the papers by the end of the day then. Continue.”
They sat in silence for a few minutes and Draco took the time to properly look around the restaurant, ignoring the few furtive looks he knew Potter was stealing. The walls were painted white, with a red, detailed trim design painted along the ceiling, but the family photos and handmade art on the walls gave it a much more personal, cozy feeling, the sunlight coming in the front windows casting a golden glow over everything. He could feel their eyes on him, sizing him up or trying to catch his attention he didn’t know, but he pretended he didn’t notice it.
a bunch of people, some reporters that didn’t agree to his demands, some muggles in the wrong place at the wrong time. There were a couple times I took some nasty curses in place of my mother, with her right there to watch. There were more than a few times I thought him or Bellatrix were going to kill me with my own wand.” He left it at that because it was easier than explaining why he had to switch bedrooms within the manor, or why he could never sleep a full night anymore, or why he refused to eat any sort of beef, or anything that was vibrantly orange would make him tremble. Taking a long, desperate gulp of his drink, he wished he had just gotten a bottle of straight vodka, some of the intense American brand Etherclean or whatever shit Blaise had brought over the last time they had met.
Aedan had the most fascinating, slate-coloured eyes, and Draco met their gaze when it shifted up to his own; he couldn’t sense any malice coming from them, only a cautious curiosity. “I see,” he replied after a beat passed and their words had time to sink into his tired mind. “The Ministry has never-” Both men jumped as the kettle whistled loudly, Aedan chuckling softly in what he assumed was embarrassment, and Draco ignored him and quickly added his Earl Grey teabag to the cup before pouring in the boiling water. “As I was saying, the Ministry of Magic hasn’t been particularly concerned about the safety of their accused criminals in the past. Why the change of heart?”
A shudder ripped through his body and he pressed his forehead to the cool, stone wall, cradling his hand against his chest. “Please,” he begged to the manor settling around him, to the snowflake-dusted sky that was sending the first hints of winter to the ground, to the fucking spirit of Dumbledore, to the god he didn’t believe in - to whoever would listen to him anymore. “Just - just let me sleep.” The house settled with a sigh that pooled in his throat, sending faint rivers of blood along the creases in his hand, and he hated himself for the voice break that made his own knees weak. Outside, the peacocks screamed at the setting moon, echoing across the estate.
that had just cut him to ribbons, not from any real desire to do them harm. It was stupid, really, because even after they tried to kill him, he still hadn’t wanted them hurt, still didn’t.
He only remembered the third letter when he could smell something on fire, looking over to see the corners of the envelope smoking and starting to shake in the owl’s beak. It was a crimson envelope with a formal-looking seal, and his heart sank because it was a Howler, it had to be, and when he looked at it in closer detail there was no sender written on the outside. By this time the owl had fled to a separate part of the house, and the other two seemed to quickly follow suit as the envelope smoldered and shook violently in his hand.  He quickly cast a
Saviour Potter was dressed in what had to be a muggle outfit: dark jeans, a black windbreaker jacket they slipped off in order to drape it awkwardly over the back of the chair, and a grey cotton t-shirt with some writing on it, but the letters were impossible to make out. Part of Draco was shocked by how normal they looked, how unchanged Potter seemed despite everything he’d been through, that they’d both been through. Their hair was the same twisted birds-nest as it had been at Hogwarts, the same stupid glasses were balanced on their nose; the only different thing he could see was the 5’o’clock shadow lingering on their jawline. The emerald eyes Draco had caught on the first day of the hearing flicked over to him before jumping to something in the audience section, and the realization that they belonged to Potter made something catch in his throat. “Fuck,” he whispered, little more than a breath, and he hated the way his pulse skipped. He could already tell that having them sit there, mere meters away, would make the day’s proceedings feel like an eternity, and he was dreading every moment of it.
“Are you a celebrity in the muggle world too, Potter?” The snippy question slipped out before he could stop it, and he flushed as their eyes turned hard. “Sorry. Habit. I... I can’t wait to try it,” Draco corrected, ducking his head and staring down at his feet as they walked down the road. Only a few cars had passed them, probably locals, and he knew that this small village was probably the first time in their life the Boy Who Lived could actually blend into a crowd, whereas Draco’s expensive dark green turtleneck and black blazer would push him outside it. “Anyway.”
Hesitantly he returned her smile with a small one of his own. “Thanks.”
“My apologies,” the man said as he sat down carefully, and Draco’s ice-like gaze flicked back up to their face as they took a breath. “I haven’t - I’m afraid I have been terribly rude, let me start over and introduce myself. My name is Aedan Firethron, I am from the- the auror department, with the Ministry of Magic. As you said, the Ministry has been - for lack of a better word, reviewing, your family’s mail, and they found the number of Howlers and threatening messages rather concerning, especially the amount addressed specifically to you, and it was requested that you have a guard because of it.”
They shrugged dismissively and he tried not to take offense at it. “Can I ask what really happened to you at the manor, when Voldemort was there? Like what - you were a child, really, what sorts of things could he have possibly wanted you to do?”
A hum rippled through the room, and he could hear Rita Skeeter’s quill scratching frantically against parchment. The witch in front of him dropped her facade, nearly glaring at him with a cold, condescending expression. “That was not an option given to you, Mister Malfoy. You can either take the
“Oh the usual, talking about how vile the Malfoy family name is and how I deserve to be sent to Azkaban. I expect to be getting many more like it as the days go by.” He took a drink, closing his eyes for a moment as the vodka burned slightly on the way down. “Really, I should start getting used to it.”
Draco woke with a start on the living room’s couch, eyes flying open as he nearly fell off the seat cushions he’d been draped over. The wards from when the Dark Lord resided at the manor wailed like banshees, echoing through the vaulted rooms along with a booming knock at the front door, and he was thankful his mother had chosen to stay with her sister during the week of the hearing. After the initial rush of adrenaline had started to die down, he groaned loudly, eyes squeezed shut again, silencing the alarms with a swirl of his wand as he slowly rose to stand. Everything in his body hurt. A brief glance at the clock told him it was 7 in the morning - three hours of sleep was not a flattering way to appear at the second day of his trial. Another knock ricocheted around his skull before settling into an angry throb. “Coming,” he shouted, wearily opening his eyes fully and striding for the door, spine aching with every step. He hadn’t bothered to change out of his outfit from the hearing the day before, white dress shirt creased in all the wrong places, trousers twisted awkwardly around legs that felt too long for the rest of him.
“He wants to meet me for dinner next week.” Draco stared down at the cobblestones beneath his feet because he didn’t want to see her mouth press into an irritated line again, brushing some tiny shards of glass from his trousers. “Something about ‘catching up’ like we’re old friends. And, before you say it, the owl was sent this morning. Not a mistake. Seems like he still wants to try being friendly.”
, it really wouldn’t have ended well, and I’ve got no idea why he did it but he lied, to everyone. He single-handedly saved my life, and I’ve got no doubt that he’s the reason I’m actually sitting here right now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Everyone was quiet for a moment, the sounds of the other customers and baristas bustling around the shop filling the silence, until Draco decided to speak up. “So,” he started, speaking slowly to give himself time to choose the right words, making sure to keep his tone neutral. “If I may ask, do you remember anything from your most recent interaction with the killing curse?” He expected them to talk about the spell bouncing off, or he dodged it, or it hit some limb and St. Mungo’s had to work some magic on it to make it more normal.
“You’re a menace,” he shot back, swapping his wine glass for the shorter glass of water next to it after clearing his throat. “He wanted to tell me that he was giving me a second chance, even after he testified that I was a bully that tried to kill him. Apparently saving him from the Snatchers cancels out the snake I sent after him in our second year.” Pansy knew about what had happened at the Manor, and what had happened to him after Potter had escaped, but she only hummed as confirmation that she was listening so he decided to get the worst part over with. “After I was freed he wanted to get drinks to just finalize everything, that was this past Wednesday, and I let slip that I fancied him.”
“Didn’t really realize you were so eager to get sent to Azkaban and see your father again,” they replied calmly, looking at him with a curious expression, and Draco’s traitorous heart skipped long enough to make his next breath catch. “Shacklebolt said that unless new evidence comes to light they’ll be releasing you at the next session, free of all charges. Something about expert witness testimony.”
”, turning on the burner.
Malfoy, Merlin’s tits you’re such a fucking idiot!!”
He groaned, tossing the parchment onto his bedside table in favour of rolling back onto his stomach and burying his face into the soft swell of his pillow. He had meticulously folded and hidden the robe Potter had forgotten under his pillow, pretending it was for safe-keeping and not his own selfish want to trigger dreams of the Chosen One each night, and one of his hands fisted into the thick material as he closed his eyes tighter. That night, the one where he had messed up everything so badly but came out with a hesitant friendship, had been playing endlessly in his mind’s eye since it had happened; the lights lining the manor’s hallways reminded him of the way the lamppost had circled Potter’s head in a golden glow, he’d wash his hands before breakfast and remember the way their horrible scars had felt under his fingertips, even something as simple as pausing in a doorway would remind him that Potter had asked him to stay, even grabbed his arm to hold him there because his presence was
“Here.”
He watched as they opened their mouth, looking like they were going to say something back then thought better of it, taking a swig from their beer instead. “I heard about your engagement to Astoria Greengrass, how is that going along? Have you set up a wedding date yet?”
He watched her stare into her drink for a moment before she downed it. “Well fuck, I guess. Any idea why he’d go and waste his time with keeping you alive? I’d think he’d be the one posting a bounty for your head.”
“Actually you’ll be telling me the moment after it happens, thank you very much.” She slipped her arm into his, smoothing down the back of her hair, and he straightened a few stray pieces from her bangs. “I wouldn’t have been so mad if you hadn’t tried hiding it from me, idiot. The wards on the manor have always let me in, you’re never properly safe from me, Draco, and it’ll do you good to remember that.”
Their words took him by surprise and Draco almost choked on his drink, managing to swallow it roughly. “I- Uh-” He cleared his throat. “What did you want to ask?”
“Sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.” She had a hand to her ear mockingly and he leaned forward in the chair, licking his lips before speaking again.
His interest was caught when the auror visibly hesitated, looking down and to the side for a moment. “I - My apologies, Mister Malfoy, but that is confidential information, meant for Ministry personnel only.”
Of course the Boy Who Lived was waiting when Draco and Aedan arrived at the cafe, his stupid hair all messed up and standing on end as he sat with his back towards the door again. Instead of the leather jacket from last time, the one that lingered in the back of his mind despite all attempts to erase it, they were wearing the same basic all-black trousers, undershirt, and robes that aurors-in-training would wear, last name most likely embroidered in gold on the left chest. Even from here he can see three of the plastic glasses on the table, already half-full of water and placed where each person had sat the last time they were there, and after a moment he realized it was the exact same table as well.
“Guess.”
, they’re convinced you threw the trial for me.”
“Fuck,” he whispered. His knees shook like they were about to give out from beneath him. Aedan knew, now there was someone else that knew how pathetic he was and they were waiting outside, alone, at a table with Saint Potter. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t trust the auror; they didn’t seem the type to tell his secrets to the world, but the fact that there was a chance that his carefully-made front could come crashing down at the Boy Who Lived’s feet like this - Merlin, it made him want to vomit for real. He very delicately made his way out of the stall, leaning heavily on the bathroom’s walls as he did, and he was very thankful to be alone because when he raised his head to the mirror a choked sob slipped from his throat.
Here it is, the long-awaited chapter to make you cringe! As is the general theme of the story, there are some mild panic-attack elements sprinkled in, and some alcohol references. Hope you enjoy!
He could hear the auror take a step back, away from him, and he was half-expecting them to try to rationalize his stupid, stupid infatuation, maybe even attempt to talk him out of it. “I’ll tell Mister Potter you’ll be a few more minutes,” they said instead, and then their footsteps faded away as the bathroom door closed, leaving Draco alone again.
“I think you’re guessing correctly.” She smiled, and Draco thought she looked sad for a moment, and then it was gone. “Come, let me make you some more tea. My sister wants to bring Teddy around to meet you sometime, he is quite the child already. He’s inherited his mother’s metamorphagus talent and already he’s getting himself into mischief.”
“Is it - do you envy me, Malfoy? Is that it? You wanted to be the one Voldemort tried to kill all the time, with dead parents and a stupid scar?” There’s a laugh of disbelief in their words. “That’s why you didn’t testify, because you were afraid to let everyone know you were jealous of Harry Potter? Merlin, you - you risked Azkaban for your stupid pride and family name? You’re a fucking moron, I just - you’re ridiculous, do you actually-”
“Yes, yes, you lied because you care for him,” Aedan finished instead. “And if that were to come out, especially with him in attendance, the uproar would be unpleasant at best.”
Draco cleared his throat, grabbing the glass of water and pulling it closer to him, thumb gliding along the lip of the glass. “Anyway.” Potter raised an eyebrow but he ignored it. “You’re done testifying, Potter, why did you call me here to talk? Did you miss the company?” The words came out with an unintentional sneer, eyes quickly lifting to see their reaction, which was simply biting their own tongue again. It physically hurt him a bit to say it, to keep up this facade of disgust and condescension he had worn for so long because he
“Hey, Malfoy, follow me.” They waved, waiting for him to catch up before starting back down the street they came from with their hands shoved into their jean pockets. “It’s a few blocks this way, this little Indian place my godfather showed me when he was still around.”
“Yeah, exactly.”
“I’m not stupid. You’ve got a - a charm or something over the back of your right hand.” He nodded towards it. “It’s quite good, my father taught me about glamours when I was younger but I know Hogwarts didn’t teach us anything like that.” Like it knew it was being addressed, the magic on their skin flickered for a moment.
“I might have to teach him a few of my industry secrets when he visits then, get him to live up to the Malfoy name properly.” He didn’t miss the concerned look she sent back at him as they made their way towards the kitchen again, cracking a smile after what felt like a long, long time. “Someone’s gotta teach him to break into our broomshed, I’m too old for midnight flying.” She laughed at that, and he pushed the Howler and other letters to the back of his mind as he tried his best to pretend everything was normal, just like it was before the war.
“That’s, uhm -” This was the first time he had ever seen Potter truly speechless, and something inside of him smiled weakly despite the panic. “That’s awful.”
“There are plenty of muggle places we can go. Unless your royal highness would prefer something else.”
Now chuckling, Malfoy pushed past him into the bathroom and picked up a hand mirror, gesturing for Harry to stand in front of the mirror over the sink again. Malfoy angled the hand mirror so that Harry could see the tattoo properly.
“Oh. Right. Of course.”
A series of yipping barks echoed up the hallway, and on skittering feet the crup puppy that Harry had no memory of appeared. He was adorable, with scruffy white and brown fur, his forked tail beating wildly as he slammed into Kreacher’s legs on his way to Harry. Kreacher, disgruntled, apparated away. Oscar abandoned Harry for the bannister of the nearest stairwell as Harry dropped to his knees to greet the pup, “Hey, Gandalf. Hi, buddy.”
with Dudley. Never mind that apparently Dudley Dursley and Draco Malfoy were now friends as well. The sort of friends who worked out together, even.
Instead he said, “It didn’t feel like mine to explore. And I was sort of avoiding it… seeing it all, I mean. The bedroom looked depressing enough.”
Draco closed his eyes and pushed a sharp breath out of his nostrils. “Just fancied a run?” he asked in a dangerous tone.
“Did you end up seeing your memory for today? I’m sorry, I figured you probably needed your sleep before Dudley arrived more than anything.”
Turning to Malfoy with a pleading look, Harry hoped he might be able to find an ally. After all, he must be as eager to get through the memories as Harry was.
With an unabashed shrug, Draco replied, “Well any Slytherin worth their salt will use all methods at their disposal.”
Draco was smiling ruefully. “Give or take. Ask Pansy and she’ll insist that it was actually first.”
“You alright?” Harry asked.
He pursued memory after memory. He watched as they patrolled the city streets, he watched as they studied together and went for afternoon strolls to clear their minds. He watched as they talked about what they both wanted out of the future. He watched as his past-self told Draco about the nightmares he gets sometimes, and as over a late night game of chess, they decided they were friends.
Harry woke up to an empty bed and a level of lighting that suggested it was the middle of the night. His stomach lurched nervously. Did Draco decide he didn’t want to be moved back into the master with Harry after all? Had he had a nightmare and not felt comfortable talking to Harry about it? Had something more concerning happened?
He choked on his own spit. Hermione had to spend a minute rubbing his back and supporting him to gulp back water before Harry was able to sit back and process that.
He walked them down to the door, dismissing their looks of concern and emphasizing that he was just tired, which the Niamh said was to be expected.
Harry was in the middle of defending his choice to start with Charms, rather than potions, to Hermione when Ron walked back into the kitchen.
“Maybe,” Harry’s face was screwed up with uncertainty. This was all just so bloody weird. “Yeah,” he amended with more confidence. “Let’s do that.”
Frowning, Harry mulled this over. “I… I guess it always felt a bit more of an obligation than anything else?”
“I need to discuss safety measures for your return home, Mr. Potter.”
“I look so terribly pathetic?”
“Well Dean’s muggleborn, isn’t he?” Draco glanced sideways at Harry with a teasing twist to his lips.
“We’ll figure it out, mate. Maybe not the way we wish we could. But we’ll work it out.”
He seemed more pale than usual and his posture was strung tight.
Scowling at her teasing tone, Harry motioned for her to continue her story.
“Well, thanks,” Draco yawned and pushed up to a seated position. “I feel much better. What time is it?”
Harry squinted at Draco’s face, the edges of his features slightly blurred as he was without his glasses, “I know.” He certainly hadn’t forgotten Draco’s reaction when Harry had first made his move. “I… did actually have a question about that, though?”
“Potter,” he replied without thinking, and to cover himself he quickly added, “He said I owe him a drink, since he saved my life, that’s all.” Then it hit him like a bludger to the face: that smell on the parchment was
Draco mustered what little energy he had to inject some venom into his next words, lifting his chin and looking down at them with carefully practiced disdain. “If I remember correctly, you are currently trespassing in mine and my family’s home, sent here by some unsubstantiated order of the Ministry, the very same Ministry that is currently attempting to send me to Azkaban with my Death Eater father. I believe I deserve to know everything that goes on with regards to my safety.” Merlin, Lucius would be proud of him for that one.
They raised an eyebrow at him. “You know you can report that to the Ministry, right? They’ll help up your wards and look for the sender.”
It could be a Howler, it could be one of those muggle bombs that he had read about in the
“No,” they replied instantly, and the instinctiveness of it made him feel more at ease. “It’s just... There’s not really anyone around to talk about the war with, I know I’ve got Ron and Hermoine but it’s just- they think we’ve all talked it to death, they’re done, they want their peace so they can move on. I, uhm - I don‘t think I’m quite ready for that yet.”
“He is called Saint Potter for a reason, Pans, he loves to go and save people from themselves.” Watching a happy couple across the room converse quietly, a new-looking diamond ring flashing on the girl’s hand, Draco shifted in his chair to mimic her posture, leaning forward. “He invited me to coffee, during the off days of the trial. Twice.”
“See, Malfoy, I know you’re not sorry, you don’t have to play dumb with me. I know all about you. You can’t use your parents as an excuse, since they weren’t at Hogwarts with you ever, and they definitely aren’t with you now, which means you were an arse of your own free will.” They leaned in then, even closer than before, and Draco had to fight every fiber of his being to stay where he was. “It’s like I’ve said before, your father’s vile, and cruel, and you’re pathetic. It’s a miracle you had enough backbone to stand up straight on your own without needing Crabbe and Goyle to hold you up.”
smell, it was Potter’s bloody cologne and the same stupid, unidentified thing in his
When Draco turned to lean against the countertop, he saw them still lingering in the doorway awkwardly, and he raised an eyebrow as the man tucked their wand away into their robes. “There is a perfectly good chair right there. You’ve already invited yourself into my house, might as well invite yourself to the table as well,” he drawled, and even in his sleep-deprived state he got a twinge of satisfaction as the man flushed. Now that he wasn’t concerned with a curse hitting him right between the eyes, he could take the chance to look them over properly, leaning back on his hands and watching them pull out one of the wooden chairs. They were tall and lean, with the sort of build that seemed more suited to the beach than watching war criminals, at least from what he could see from the way their dark, three-piece suit fit.
“Yes.” In his defense, it hadn’t intentionally been directed towards Katie Bell, she had just been an unfortunate near casualty.
, many of the members shifting to whisper to their neighbours, robes rustling like leaves in a forest. The same witch seemed at a slight loss for words, jaw silently opening and closing for a moment, before she looked up to Shacklebolt in his towering seat. An unspoken question passed between the pair, then Shacklebolt gave a small shake of his head and the witch nodded, her seemingly default smile returning to her face shortly after. “I don’t believe that will be necessary, Mister Potter, but thank you for your honesty. Let’s continue with your testimony, to the other incident, with the Snatchers. Can you explain to everyone what those are?”
“How can you just pretend that - that none of this just happened? That the last seven years were just, I don’t know, a dream? Forget that time in sixth year where you tried to kill me, or - or tonight, or the rest of it?”
“I’m offended that you think I need to pay off someone in order to be released.” He stared at his wine, purposely avoiding the various waiters looking like they wanted to approach their table. “And, also, entirely in my defense, the Ministry blocked any of my mail coming in or out. I would have told you as it happened if I had been allowed to.” He left out Potter’s letters, setting the glass down in favour of leaning back in his chair, thumb rubbing at the snake ring he had worn since he was old enough to fit it. “First hearing session was nothing spectacular. My mother testified on my behalf, telling them how the Dark Lord lived with us for far too long, that me and my family were afraid for our lives, the same sort of basic emotional appeal that the
“Yes, well.” He traced the rim of the plastic cup with his thumb, shrugging in an attempt to seem casual. “It’s a much better outcome than what I expected, but it is technically the correct one.”
“Cool, brilliant.” They pushed off the post to stand closer, the light settling over their birdnest of hair in a golden halo again. “Well. I’ll owl you sometime. See you around, Malfoy.”
“Oh don’t sound so surprised, you’re here early as well,” he drawled back, and he could tell they were literally biting their tongue to hold back a reply. “I do apologize for last time, the stomach flu isn’t the best way to end a meeting.”
“Just a vodka cran, please.” He settled onto the hard wood and watched as they went to the counter, exchanging some low words with the bartender and coming back moments later with the drink in a short glass, a small straw leaning against the rim. “Thanks.”
Draco didn’t think twice, awkwardly maneuvering the robes around himself while still confined to the booth. Just as he was fumbling with the clasp Potter lunged at him from across the table, quickly jerking the oversized hood up over his head enough to hide his face from nearly everyone’s view before sitting back down and trying to act casual. Instantly he was overwhelmed with the smell of that
“If you want you can try a bit of mine,” Potter offered, already ripping off a piece of naan. Their dish was cubes of something soaked in an orange sauce, cilantro sprigs on top. “The gravy is good for dipping at least.”
wish it was true - he wished that they had missed him.
Draco nodded, sitting up a little straighter in his chair and debating on if he should stand as well. “I appreciate it,” he said instead, offering them another hesitant smile as his hands twisted together in his lap. Potter’s insistence on getting drinks, even if it was only as enemies-turned-acquaintances, sent his stomach into a nervous churn. “And when - if I get off,” he corrected quickly, “we’ll be properly even, no more of this life-saving ridiculousness you keep throwing around.”
“What the fuck were you thinking!?!! Why the fuck would you go and do something so, so - so stupid!! You do realize you’ve basically ruined everything, right, all that freedom and good image you’ve been working on, it’s all fucking gone because you can’t keep your bloody dick out of it!!” She was pacing on the uneven cobblestones, back enough from the main street to where her shouts wouldn’t be heard by a passerby, hands clenched into fists as she ranted. “He’s going to sell your stupid soul to the fucking
“It’s some robes, put them on and pop the hood,” Potter said in an urgent whisper, his eyes still on whoever just walked in. “Quick.”
“Well that was fucking awful.” Potter was the one to break the tense silence after they were a few blocks away, stopping to lean against a lamppost, and Draco took that as a cue to finally pull the hood down. “Sorry for all that, he’s one of the ones that was very... he was really against you being released with no charges.”
“How sweet of her.” The danger hadn’t left Pansy’s voice and she leaned forward, chest nearly falling out of the steep neckline of her dress. “You have five minutes to explain what the bloody hell happened at your trial.”
“-and the only thing he said was, ‘I can’t be sure’”. The familiarity of their voice dragged him back to the present and Draco surfaced from the nightmare with a soft, sharp breath in, lifting his head to find Potter’s eyes still trained steadily on him. “That’s it, that’s all he said the whole time me and Ron and Hermione were actually in the manor. By this point we’ve spent nearly a third of our lives dueling and playing each other in Quidditch and taking classes together, he had to have known it was me. If he had just said something like, ‘yeah, that’s - that’s the boy who lived, right there’, his family’s honour and prestige would’ve been returned, he would’ve been Voldemort’s favourite, he’d have been a younger Bellatrix basically, but still all he ever said was ‘I can’t be sure’.”
Almost immediately there was a question perched on the tip of his tongue but he swallowed it, contenting himself with studying their features instead, something he rarely had the chance to do from this close. He and Potter were always fighting, throwing around threats and hexes like they were nothing, and he’d never been able to appreciate the way time had treated the Chosen One.
They’d pulled themselves out of bed that morning to have a light breakfast, request that Kreacher freshen up the master room for them, and take Gandalf for a leisurely walk. Then they’d broken in the bed in the master room.
Was George right though? Harry couldn’t help but wonder if the only way he and Draco had been able to get along in their relationship was because they’d had another outlet. But no, that couldn’t be. They’d been working together, been friends for months before they were in a relationship. They’d managed to spend every day together for platonic purposes and still fall in love.
Thanks for reading :) I hope you enjoyed and stay safe!
Draco was looking deeply uncomfortable as he set the pensieve down on the table.
Moving to stand next Harry, so he could lean on her shoulder, Niamh watched the man walk away.
After several heartbeats of silence, Draco said, “I appreciate that.”
“Draco,” Harry said firmly, drawing his attention back. “I
Draco shuddered a little. “I wouldn’t,” he said fervently.
Niamh hummed thoughtfully. “And how have things been with Draco?”
“People are idiots,” Harry grumbled.
The next memory was of their first patrol together. They’d picked a street that, according to the files Harry had obtained from Diggle, the Aurors weren’t able to patrol, but which was within the zone of sightings outlined on the map. Harry had attempted conversation several times, only to be continually rebuffed by a tense and anxious Draco. That night, they didn’t encounter any dementors. Harry talked Draco into coming back to his flat for a fry-up and a film afterwards.
George said plainly, “You’ve got to be straight with him Harry. I always thought one of the best things about your relationship was that you and Draco would call one another on each other’s crap. In a strangely supportive way.”
Coming to stand next to Draco’s armchair, Harry gently lifted Oscar and set him down on the couch instead. He sat down cross legged in front of the fire and looked up at Draco.
the disliking you part. If anything, it was a mutual
Malfoy released Harry, drew himself up disdainfully and jabbed a finger into Harry’s shoulder just a little too hard. “
Grimacing in response to Kreacher, Harry let himself into the kitchen. Draco was standing in front of the dining table, arms crossed and expression livid. The red of his uniform’s sleeves really emphasized his tense, muscled arms.
A thumping pain enveloped Harry as he regained a fuzzy form of consciousness. Where was he hurt? Fuck… everywhere it seemed. His head more than most other places, perhaps. Not ready to open them, Harry squeezed his eyes closed tighter, testing for his body’s reaction to the movement. There was more pain, but localized to the right side of his face. In fact, Harry realized as he tried to slide his eyes open, the right one was swollen shut.
“I am though,” Hermione persisted. “This is a really shite situation and I think you’re handling it brilliantly.”
And anyways, he was the wizard who defeated Voldemort. He could keep himself safe on a run. Checking that his wand was secure in the strap on his forearm, Harry grabbed onto the fence and vaulted over it. He glanced back to ensure that Zinnia hadn’t cottoned on to his escape, then jogged off down the alleyway.
Harry couldn’t draw his eyes away from the hopeful look on Draco’s face. He could sense Pansy  watching them owlishly.
“Did I break up with Ginny on Valentine’s day?”
A laugh burst out of Draco. “Liar,” he accused. “Your favourite colour is green, because you think it looks good on you – which it does. You just don’t want me to know because you think I’ll gloat over the fact that it’s a Slytherin colour.”
“I don’t want to her feel badly,” Draco said to Harry when she’d left again, this time with the orders Draco had put in for the both of them. “Or you.
Brushing his hair back, Draco turned his face towards Harry. His grey eyes were sad as he opened his mouth to reply only to settle for a stiff nod instead.
Despite all his experience faking sleep while others talked about him, this was a test for Harry. Somewhere deep inside him he held a dreadful understanding of what Malfoy was talking about.
If he knew himself at all (and Harry hoped he hadn’t changed that much in his missing months), he wasn’t the sort of person to get a tattoo on a whim. And he wasn’t likely to get one that didn’t have significant meaning behind it. The dragon that had now curled up and settled down in the centre of his back was a symbol of commitment.
get to do it in a public place, Weasley.”
Blinking, Harry replied, “Of course, yeah, absolutely!”
emblazoned on the back.
After heading up to his bedroom, Harry quickly gave into temptation and peeked out the window to spot Malfoy and Gandalf. Malfoy stopped for a moment to chat with Diggle who was on door-duty, letting the Auror ruffle Gandalf’s ears enthusiastically. Then he headed down the street with the puppy. His shoulders were tense and he glanced around frequently, Harry noticed. He must be feeling nervous about being out.
“Of course,” Draco said glibly, as though he’d never suspected any different.
“Well,” Ron said cheerfully, with impressive fortitude in the face of the icy look that Malfoy was giving him, “we’re all here now. Let’s go for lunch, shall we?”
“Yeah. Took a headache potion yesterday morning, but I’ve been fine since then.”
Perhaps he ought to let Draco know how early he could see the signs of his past-self falling for Draco. Perhaps he ought to let him know that between their time together in present day and reviewing the memories, Harry of current times was nearly there too. In the end, he decided he didn’t want to rush it. Instead, he pushed back his embarrassment as Draco walked him to the washroom, and waited outside the door to walk him back to bed before saying goodnight.
Standing with his head ducked to avoid the low hanging eaves of the roof, Harry surveyed the space. The attic was reasonably large, and jam packed full of crap that had somehow survived both the great purge of 1995 and when Malfoy and Harry had redone the home. Thankfully, from small round windows on both the north and south sides of the attic sunlight streamed in, illuminating dust particles floating lazily through the air.
Draco bit down on his smile. “I know.” He twined his fingers with Harry, rubbing his thumb over the ridges of Harry’s knuckles.
When Ginny showed up, Harry felt his stomach twist uncomfortably. She’d been nothing but reassuring when she’d visited him at St. Mungo’s, but he couldn’t imagine she and Draco were on good terms.
Harry drew back in affront, “You said you weren’t angry about that!”
“Mhm,” Harry wished his throat hadn’t made that strangely strangled sound.
“Amazing,” Draco panted.
“Okay, okay. But I am worried,” Harry bore his eyes into Draco’s, hoping he would understand.
Draco inhaled into Harry’s shoulder and let out a shuddering breath. “I’d only just begun to feel safe again, and then…”
“Good enough Hagrid,” Harry wrapped his arms around Hagrid, not bothering to worry about how it might make him seem like he was eleven again. Gratifyingly, Hagrid wrapped his arms around Harry tightly enough to pop some of his joints. “Got the go ahead to start reviewing some memories.”
“It’s not?” Harry wrinkled his nose, dumbfounded. “But it’s art! Dean used to draw all the time in school!”
“Thank you, Healer Brady,” Draco sighed.
“No- nothing. Fine. Don’t worry.”
“We haven’t really talked about this,” Draco said, keeping his eyes on Oscar, who was swooping delightedly overhead, “but I think it would probably be best if you kept with the only leaving the house accompanied measure.”
“The Malfoys?”
“Fuck training,” Harry grumbled in response. “Fuck Longeman. Fuck all the Aurors. Quit and live off my inheritance with me.”
“Yes, that would be nice,” Malfoy smiled nervously. “It’ll be less… you know… than the last one anyways.”
“Alright,” Harry nodded. Then, feeling as though he ought to, added, “Have a good day.”
Harry pushed his food around, he still wasn’t keen on eating. Malfoy looked at him so worriedly that he ignored his apathetic stomach and dug into the hash. Just when Harry thought the sound of his own chewing might drive him to cast a silencing charm on himself, Malfoy spoke.
Uncrossing his arms, Harry walked towards Draco’s spot at the far end of the table. “So it’s not that
And, Harry realized, his past-self was well on his way to falling in love with Draco Malfoy by the end of November, 1998.
. Harry snapped it shut and stood, glaring at the photographs on the wall.
Annalise arrived with their drinks and more apologies in record time. Titling his head, Draco fixed her with a fond look and spoke a few, soothing words in French.
“Who is Oscar?”
At one point Harry noted the way Malfoy caught his bottom lip in his teeth, and Harry turned to the screen.
He’d turned a deep pink as he rushed and stumbled over the words. Harry, now wide awake could only manage: “Huh.”
They walked right through the Leaky, eyes on the back door, not giving its gawping patrons so much as a glance. Harry tapped his wand merrily on the correct brick and strode through. He continued to ignore the curious looks of passersby, as well as the askance eyeing Hermione was giving him. While Hermione and Ron would argue that Harry had a propensity to be moody, he wasn’t one for
Hermione shrugged, with a rueful smile. “You were bored? You’ve got a hero complex?”
“Are to remain in place for now.”
After a long moment, Draco began to speak in a stilted tone. “I know that you don’t remember, Harry, but please don’t use language meant as a derogatory slur against our sexuality; I don’t enjoy hearing it.”
“Getting back to working on your coursework soon, I hope,” McGonagall said as she led them through the halls of the castle. A few students stopped in their tracks to gawp at them as they passed. “While you will have to redo some of the assignments you’ve already done to ensure comprehension, whichever grade – new or old – is better will be the one you keep.”
Draco gnawed on his lip for a moment. “What a bastard.”
“Yeah. That must be a mind fuck.”
“I’m going to talk to them,” Harry said.
“No, don’t.”
Harry faltered in the doorway. Malfoy was sitting on the floor, curled up in a ball in the back corner of the room. He had his fists, wrapped in boxer’s tape, pressed into his eyes and his shoulders were shaking. All of Harry’s anger sapped out of him. He crossed the room and slid down to sit next to Malfoy.
“You’re not intruding at all, Draco. Tuesday evenings are terribly quiet. Would you like some tea?”
“Well what’s your answer then?”
“Hey!” Ron protested, “I stood up for you!”
Ron held up a textbook
Eventually, with the help of pleading looks and gentle nudges from Oscar and Gandalf, Harry was able to convince them all to quit for the night so Hermione and Ron could go home and Harry and Draco could go out for a stroll with the animals.
“Yeah,” Harry chuckled. “Didn’t have the heart to, in the end. Come on,” Harry stood up and offered a hand to Malfoy. “Let’s go check on Ron. He’s probably not even going to let Hermione heal it; I bet he’s excited about how tough it’ll make him look.”
“That’s fine,” Harry smiled softly. “I did watch it.”
He was just opening his mouth to make some sort of retort (he had no idea
“Fucker,” Harry muttered fiercely. He fumed for a moment before realizing that Draco hadn’t moved or said anything since Longeman departed. “You alright?”
“How did he afford that ring?”
“Why, er… why don’t you sit? You seem a bit… wobbly?”
another headline screamed.
Once they’d set their brekkie on the coffee table, Harry turned to the shelves of films.
There were towering piles of books pushed up against the walls, a dummy that looked as though it had served as target practice for a variety of nasty curses, and an old rocking chair that, ominously, rocked back and forth on its own volition. Sighing as he realized the object wasn’t sitting out in the open anywhere, Harry wove through the detritus until he found a likely storage place- an old leather wrapped chest pushed up against the south window of the room. Harry had to push a rack covered in ostentatious cloaks- made of fur, dragon hide, and one particularly tacky one that was entirely green and silver sequins- out of his way. Then he dropped to his knees and unlatched the chest.
“Just a few from particular events where it may have been likely for me to meet or hear of her,” Draco said in a cautious tone.
“Good. Now I’m going to have dinner with my boyfriend.” She turned to Draco, “But call me if he has any intense disorientation, dizziness, or worsening headache, alright?”
“I’ll be fine,” Draco replied tersely.
surprised by all that. But he couldn’t exactly say he was, either. And, for the first time, a small spark of hope flared in him. Maybe the idea that he could get along with Malfoy wasn’t so wildly far-fetched after all.
Harry interrupted, shaking his head, “No, I remember that.”
But right next to the book sat the pensieve. And right next to that sat the case of memories. And he felt alright, really. He hadn’t had a headache in several days, not even during dinner at the Burrow, where, as usual, several Weasley siblings had gotten in a shouting match over Quidditch plays.
,” past-Malfoy was muttering to himself, pulling his wand out of his sleeve and glancing around. Whether he was looking for help or checking that the scene was clear of muggles, neither was to be found. “Happy memory. I need a happy memory,” Malfoy chanted to himself.
“Harry,” Draco sighed, pulling his arms off the table so Ron could angrily thunk a plate of dinner in front of him, “you hate throwing around your reputation. Don’t do it for this. It’s fine, really.”
There was an entire tea party taking place in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place when Harry finally dragged himself out of bed the next morning. George sat on a chaise with his arm wrapped casually around Pansy Parkinson’s shoulders. Hermione’s shoulder was cushioning Malfoy’s head, while on Malfoy’s other side Ron devoured a biscuit.
With a deep breath, Harry plunged in, followed nearly immediately by Malfoy. He watched bemusedly as the past Malfoy showed up unexpected with a teetering pile of old books and a bottle of peace-offering whiskey.
“So? Are we moving back in together?”
Harry stared flatly at his friend. Her eyes shimmered with tears. “What the fuck, Hermione?”
Amused, Harry asked, “Do you ever actually cook?”
Murmuring under her breath, Niamh waved her wand up and down Harry and around his head several times, monitoring the different shades of glowing light that emanated from his skin. A quick quotes quill jotted notes down in his chart as she dictated.
“He hasn’t been eating much,” Draco tattled. Harry turned to glare at him.
You don’t drink, so I don’t drink much, myself. And I know I shouldn’t be here. But I
Draco’s tall, slim figure strode through their home with a frankly unreasonable amount of grace. The previous night he’d walked right up behind Harry to reach into the cabinet for a spice that Harry had been struggling on his tiptoes to grab. Then he’d apologized for getting into Harry’s space, looking uncomfortable and guilty that he’d done something he likely would’ve done without a second thought a month ago, just as he had with the near kiss the other morning. Harry, who found himself a little too interested in the feeling of Malfoy brushing up behind him couldn’t do anything but turn red and stammer in response.
