Harry moaned silently, and Draco continued his way up to the source. He attached his lips to Harry’s hole and sucked.
While Draco felt around his rim, Harry began massaging Draco’s stomach. Starting at his stomach going down in a crisscross pattern to his bladder. Always repeating the downward pushing motion, Harry lost himself in it.
He was torn out of his thoughts by a familiar face smiling at him and tipping his head in acknowledgement. It was Malfoy again.
He watched for a few seconds, taking in how much Malfoy had changed in the last few years. His face, and skin looked as young as ever, but his appearance was way more mature than it used to be.
When he felt relaxed enough, he slid one then two fingers inside, eager to put his cock there. He fucked his fingers in and out quickly, scissoring and turning them, to stretch his rim as quick as possible.
“Well, that wouldn’t be half as fun, don’t you think?”, Harry said, turned around and continued his way back to his flat.
After a while he realized his eyes starting to drop close, so he got up and held his hand out to Harry, “You coming?”,
He felt his channel pulsating around his cock, Draco stimulating his prostate in an unrelenting rhythm. His cock started pumping hot cum inside his arse and he was screaming Draco’s name, with it.
In a swift motion he pushed his index finger past Draco’s sphincter and got down to take Draco’s cock into his mouth. Closing his legs, he pushed Draco’s arse higher up against his stomach. He felt Draco tensing his thigh muscles, hanging over his arms, but soon they started to relax again.
Harry nearly came from the view he was granted. The pink plug sat snuggly in Draco’s clean shaved hole, covered in sticky, shiny cum. He stretched his tongue out, anxious for his first taste of there combined body fluids.
One of Harry’s fingers joined Draco’s and he showed him how to angle his cock, to make it stimulate his prostate. It took a few more minutes, for Harry to get his mind back on track.
Draco scootched up, arse first in Harry’s direction. Harry pulled Draco’s left leg over his head on his other side, so that Draco’s hole and the pink plug where in his direct vision. Draco, who had nothing to hold himself against, leaned forward, placing his hands on Harry’s hipbones.
After studying the menu, Draco smiled at Harry and said, “You were right, I do like this place.”, Harry smiled back but before he could answer, an elderly looking waiter came over.
After they came up for air Harry laid on top of Draco and Harry somehow managed to open Draco’s hair, so the strands lay like a halo over his head. Draco started opening Harry’s leather jacket and pulled it down his shoulders. Harry opened Draco’s coat and took off his cardigan.  He also opened the buttons of Draco’s shirt and put his mouth on one of his nipples and sucked. Draco began moaning, not realizing that Harry didn’t stop there. Harry’s hands wandered further down and undid the button of his trousers.
And then he came. He felt the semen shoot out of his cock, in long spurts. The strokes soon got too much, and he relaxed, enjoying the tingling sensations all over his body.
It was the first real smile Harry had seen since they met two days ago. He made a mental note, to praise Draco on a regular basis.
Harry took both of Draco’s wrists in his hand and put them over his head on the heap of pillows laying on the head end of the bed. He put some lube on the plug and, with his knee, he pushed Draco’s legs apart. He positioned the plug on Draco’s hole and slowly but steady he pushed against it. Draco not being prepped in anyway tried to get away but Harry’s arm fixing him made it impossible, so he had no chance but to relax against it and let it happen. He felt the plug gliding in and a burning sensation flaming up his arse, but no sooner then he felt it, Harry’s arms let go of him and his bum was pushed up in the air, held by Harry’s strong arms. Harry had his lips and tongue circling the diamond studded butt plug, kissing it as if to make it all better. The hot breath and the constant nibbling and licking made some vibrating sensation against Draco’s prostate, which made him all giddy and fidgety. Harry managed to get his tongue under the head of the plug, sticking out of Draco’s arsehole. He went all around making it all wet, warm and soft. He tried pushing his tongue in his hole along with the plug, not getting very far, due to the complicated angle. He opened his mouth wider, taking the hole head into his mouth, biting down on the rod, connecting the head with the inner, wider part of the plug, and looked up at Draco. His light green eyes sparkling at Draco, as if he was the worlds finest meal. He began pulling a little on the plug which made the burning sensation from earlier com back, but he soon started pushing back in, at an slightly different angle, hitting his prostate dead on, Draco started screaming from all the pressure on his prostate, Harry repeated the motion several times until Draco lay there panting, trying to touch his cock but being stopped from Harry’s hand around his wrists pulling his hands under his legs, stabilizing them. His cock wasn’t even all hard but throbbing like he would cum any second. The pressure inside him was nearly unbearable now and Draco started sweating as if running a fever, his cock started dribbling precome, Harry just grinned up at him and continued with his motion, nearly pulling the plug all the way out. When Draco felt as if he was about to explode, he felt a sharp pain shooting up, looking down he saw Harry biting the crook of his leg, just beside his balls, adrenaline rushing up the pain mixed with the nearly unbearable pleasure of the pressure against his prostate. When he felt the pressure rising all the was to his balls, he felt like crying. Harry kissed the inside of his thighs and said, “Relax, just let it happen. I’ll take care of you. Let go”. And Draco did just that, he tried to roll with it. Draco mumbled a spell and the plug inside him expanded, the pressure on his prostate was too much he felt cum dribbling out of his cock, but not in a shooting motion, like it usually did. It felt like the beginning of an orgasm but just way longer. He screamed, cried, shouted and threw himself in the bed, he was completely sweaty all over his body, slowly he felt the dribbling come to an end but then Harry started with that motion again, now using his right hand, he heard Harry far, far away
“I don’t know what you want me to say. As far as I can tell, he’s doing just fine,” Harry said defensively, feeling walls instinctively slam up in his mind like a stellar Occlumens. He’d mastered it early on in training and was glad to have done so.
Draco had chosen a white dress shirt and classy grey trousers for the workday that accentuated the sharp and elegant lines of his body. His formal robes hung folded over the back of his chair. Draco craned his neck up to meet Harry’s lips when he approached. The perfect morning kiss.
“Draco?” Harry prompts gently, pulling back the gauzy curtain further and perching at the edge of the bed. “What’s wrong?”
“Please,” Draco snorts. “Imagine the luck of the poor person who would get me, not only a Death Eater but also a drug-addict. What a package deal. At this point, I’m glad no one has me.”
It tasted no different than his usual cup at all, but there was something oddly familiar about it. He smacked his lips together, searching for the feeling again in his next taste. Again — something strangely stuck out.
Interesting, Draco mused. The photo itself was grainy and distorted, and pictured two wizards passing a few glass vials between exposed fingertips from beneath billowing robes. The action was quick and hard to catch before the photograph looped and restarted.
Rage swelled in Draco’s lungs, but he couldn’t tear his gaze away. He could hold himself together for only a moment longer before he interrupted the two. There must have been a dangerous look in his eye because a few patrons from the table across had begun regarding him warily.
Harry thought he could understand why. The statue in front of him bore a strange resemblance to the man at his side. The other sculptures in the room reflected soft curves and flowing fabrics despite their marble medium. It was what made them so impressive, to begin with. But this one was made up of harsh lines and angular features. His eyes were sharp and focused on the blade at his fingertips, and his body was leaner than the others that saturated the room. The blindingly white marble didn’t help its case either. Harry refused to admit the figure was gorgeous because that would mean admitting someone else was too. He wasn’t ready for that just yet.
Draco raised a delicate eyebrow. “I’ve noticed.” He wanted an apology, not an excuse, but supposed he wouldn’t get one. Then, “Neither have I.”
The effect was almost immediate after that. Harry’s eyes were drooping contentedly, and his entire body felt relaxed and warm, like his first day at the Burrow. He was nowhere near as out of control of his body as he thought he might be, but he felt lighter like a heavy stone had been removed from his stomach. Something in the air felt hopeful.
Harry had advanced, like a lion, high from the euphoria of the moment before a kill. Something unruly in his eyes told Draco that he’d already been beaten.
Draco looks as though he very sincerely does not want to, but he follows behind Harry anyway. Molly is humming a Christmas tune at the stovetop as a pot stirs itself in front of her. The sounds of root vegetables being chopped on a cutting board draw Harry’s attention before she does. Warm sunlight begins to spill through the windowpanes, despite the rain, and Harry wonders if there will be a rainbow.
Draco paused for a moment as Lyra clambered ungracefully into his lap, her talons digging uncomfortably into his thigh, but he allowed her to perch anyway. She closed her eyes lazily against the gentle sunlight streaming in from the outside. Draco’s eyes caught on the dust particles moving through rays of yellow before turning his attention back to the darkness on his page. He noticed offhandedly that Hannah Abbott had written the article. She had been in his year, what, a Hufflepuff? A Gryffindor?
“You hang around me much more often than I expect these days,” Draco replies, pulling the comforter further up his body.
“Not necessarily.” Locke twiddled his thumbs. “I did sell the man that potion, so in effect, I did help him kill her.” He laughed to himself as though this was somehow an inside joke. Harry’s blood curdled, and there was a pause.
Harry flicked through the pages of the Muggle newspaper in front of him. He’d read the papers multiple times, if anything, out of boredom when Uncle Vernon had one out at the table. But he was used to the Prophet’s moving pictures, which proved more exciting than stagnant ink. He was getting restless.
The sky cried with fierce rain that drenched them both, their clothing growing sticky and sodden against weak bodies. Draco could see his breath meet the cold air, and was frankly surprised it wasn’t snowing yet.
“What do you think?” Theo sneers, but there isn’t much anger behind the statement. He seems more tired and irritated than anything serious.
“I know,” Harry said, wrapping a rough hand around his small waist. “But you’ve lost so much weight, eating would be good for you.”
Harry can’t see very well, but he knows he’s still in Draco’s bed. There’s no one next to him, and the grandfather clock on the wall would probably say it was sometime in the early morning if he could see it properly. He steps off the bed gingerly, curling his toes into the carpet beneath his feet.
Harry offered a broad smile, clapping Ron on the back. “S’okay.” He said, sleep still clouding his words.
“I’ll be right outside,” he said, pointedly levelling a gaze at Locke that Harry would have been frightened of himself.
“I guess, I just want to make sure the people in my life are happy,” he says, thinking of Draco's troubled, humiliated expression in his bedroom.
The ceremony is short and relatively emotionless. Lucius stiffens at the sight of Harry but sits through the ordeal and promptly apparates away seconds after it finishes. Draco’s friends, namely Parkinson and Zabini, appear as though they are going to shoot an Unforgiveable at him on sight. Harry does not blame any of them. Snape, surprisingly, sits next to him throughout the service though they do not speak one word. Their silent understanding is enough to quell Harry’s nerves, even if just a bit. He is still surprised by Narcissa’s unexpected kindness, and he wishes he had been able to meet
“I don’t have the time or energy to wonder why you might have done something like this,” Draco’s voice wavered, choking back tears that Harry knew were already coming. “But I want you to know that this is over.”
It wasn’t often that Harry scared him, but something about his hungry gaze coupled with the shock of pain in Draco’s head would not bode well for either of them.
This man was much different than the shopkeeper Harry had encountered in Knockturn Alley that day. Where that man was quite reserved and notably sycophantic, this one was wild and manic. Almost unhinged in a way that made Harry want to turn and run from the room.
He takes the thought back as Blaise enters the room, his face lighting up as he catches sight of Draco. It’s like the room feels comfortable once two Slytherins are in it rather than one. Blaise comes to sit next to Draco, engaging him in a conversation about something Harry doesn’t know anything about, and Hermione perches next to him.
The entirety of the Three Broomsticks swiveled to stare at who had just disturbed the peace in the quiet establishment. Malfoy, presumably, couldn’t hear a thing, but recognizing the reactions from other patrons and the way Harry’s mouth opened so widely was apparently enough. Madam Rosmerta was already sending nasty looks their way, and neither of them desired a lifetime ban.
Harry chews at his lip, unsure of what he should say. It would probably be best to bring Pansy and Theo here for this kind of conversation, but Harry knows that whether Draco is aware or not, he owes it to him to be honest. The clock on the wall reads six in the morning, and they probably wouldn’t be awake anyway. And, although Draco doesn't know it, Harry has a stake in his life too.
Draco swallows, looking away at something on the carpeted floor. He wipes his face quickly, as though he’s ashamed to be too emotional.
him he’s your soulmate. You just need to patch up your relationship and become friends. That’s not the hardest task in the world.”
Ron’s face fell, but only for a moment. It was probably becoming more apparent to him by the second that Harry was pushing him away. But there were good reasons, and Harry justified it to himself often that it would hurt less this way when the world discovered his indiscretions.
But, before he could say another word, a blinding pain erupted from behind the center of his face. He slammed his eyes shut to block off incoming light from the patio doors. He could hear Harry saying his name, but the sound was blurry and distorted as if it were miles away.
Draco’s eyes were completely glassed over, Harry only understand the ‘Thank you, daddy’’s due to the constant repetitions.
“That’s not what I meant. I meant I’ve heard from Blaise, Pansy and Millicent but no one ever mentioned you.”
It tasted amazing, he licked all the inside of Draco’s arse cheeks clean, even the few droplets that had run down, in the direction of Draco’s perineum. When everything was cleaned, and now covered in Harry’s spit he got to the main attraction, the still vibrating plug.
“Alright”, Harry said and continued his motion, folding both his hands together with Draco’s on the bed. When he bottomed out, he leaned down and kissed Draco softly. “You are so tight, it feels amazing how your hot wet channel grabs my cock. And every time you moan or talk it is like the most intimate massage. You’re doing amazing.”, Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. It made him blush a deep crimson red, but he didn’t stop looking up into Harry’s eyes.
“Draco?” He knocked, feeling his pulse quicken inside the skin of his neck. “The door’s locked, will you open it?”
Because even after everything, all the pain and terror he’d lived through, it had always been Harry. It always
“The Victoria and Albert Museum,” Malfoy announced, as though he were a tour guide. “We’re in London. Some Muggles just call it the V&A, though. Figures they would be lazy about it.”
Draco only chuckled. “It’s not an unfair question.” But he looked at Harry as though he was incapable of answering himself. Maybe the potion wouldn’t let him.
Harry sits up, breathing out shakily, as he wrestles his own pants down. He doesn’t even need to touch himself, his cock already straining up, eager against his stomach.
“Harry, tell me what’s in the potion,” Draco managed, his throat bone dry. “What are you doing to me?”
“Do you ever think about cutting back, by just a bit?” Harry asks carefully. He’s reluctant to say something out of place, but Draco seems to be open to the discussion more than usual.
“I see you,” Harry says quietly, taking Draco’s hand in his and squeezing lightly. “I know it feels impossible to stop.”
“You almost died last night, and Draco, I’m not your mother or a close friend, so I can’t tell you what to do here. But I would be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.” Harry finds himself surprised at his honesty. He closes his eyes, as if that’s somehow going to make his words go away and he’ll pretend it’s not hurting to see Draco like this as much as it is.
“Harry,” Ron began through a mouthful of toast. “Where were you last night mate? We were playing some drinking games in the common room. You would’ve died laughing, Seamus sicked up all over his own bed after only one round of exploding snap!”
Harry’s too surprised at the name to react well, but he offers an obedient nod. His eyes are still heavy with sleep, and his vision blurs as he attempts to adjust to the harsh overhead lighting.
“What do you need? Can I get you water?” Harry sits on the edge of the tub, reaching a hand out instinctively to rub at Draco’s back.
,” Harry admonishes. “Who you are now is this kind and caring person that I think I’d do anything for.” The words slip from his mouth before he realises it.
“Fuck,” Harry found himself saying aloud because he knew what he was about to do, and it involved a whole deal of embarrassment and probably a Prophet article. He’d always been told he was impulsive.
Harry pulls down Draco’s pants, slowly, and with a deliberateness he’s never done before during sex. He’s looking forward to watching Draco come apart underneath his mouth. His cock springs out from behind the fabric, and Harry, without warning, swallows him to the base, nose poking into the small hairs of Draco’s stomach. He presses his hands into his hips, wrapping fingers around his narrow waist, licking up the shaft and sinking back down as Draco litters the air around them with encouraging swears and groans. Draco’s hand knots into his hair, pushing him down rougher and faster, until Harry’s gasping, choking closed-mouthed around him.
made him stay. He had been prepared to leave, his bags had been packed, and he had a private bedroom waiting for him at Ginny and Pansy’s for an indefinite amount of time. He still wondered, worried about what had made him change his mind.
“Her sister seems to think this wasn’t an accident. Apparently, she would never do something like this.”
“Please,” Harry said, handing over bills to the baker. The man looked between them suspiciously but accepted the money.
Harry resists the urge to reach out and take Draco’s hands in his. Because he knows, in part, that those are the drugs speaking whether Draco is willing to acknowledge it or not.
“That’s not true,” Draco scowls, suddenly looking a lot like the boy he was during their school days. “I would owe you the courtesy of keeping you in the loop. For Granger and Weasley to know something like that before I did feels like an invasion of my privacy.”
“It’s like a drug, you see. You’ll be ruthless. Merciless. Overindulgent. I suppose you know that there is already a little something dark in the back of your mind. It’ll tell you to do depraved things. Of course, you can always decide if you want to listen or run.”
“I didn’t think I would, but I was feeling the physical effects more than I liked,” Harry admits. “And you and Hermione got in my head about the whole thing.”
Harry’s breath catches in his throat. He knows it hasn’t been long since they’ve known each other, but somehow, seeing Narcissa still feels like a secret, like he’s hiding something terrible from Draco.
Draco entered and, well, he looked stunning. Harry shouldn’t have been surprised, but it was rare that he was able to watch Draco without him knowing so. Something about him seemed so innocent and docile when intrusive eyes weren’t laying heavy on his body. He looked a bit like an unsuspecting deer, and watching him felt more volatile to Harry than it should have.
He walks forward slowly, his shoes making contact with the floor beneath him. He’s noticed the bathroom is flooding. The loudest sound in the room is Harry’s heart hammering away frantically in his chest. He wouldn’t be surprised if it gave out right then and there. But he reaches the corner and flattens his back to the wall, forcing a deep breath before coming out from behind it.
“What about Pansy or Theo?” Harry asks, feeling as though he’s conversing with a small child. “They’re your friends.”
“Your breath is abhorrent.” Draco wrinkled his nose, but there was a distinct fondness in his gaze. Just for that, Harry gave him another kiss, to which Draco protested loudly.
Harry found his heart rate picking up, and he drummed his fingers nervously against the tabletop. The fact that Draco’s smile was enough to send Harry’s heart into a tizzy was just short of alarming.
“Have you lost your mind, Potter?” Malfoy bit out, turning back to his reading, “Speaking in the third-person now?”
Hermione stepped forward as Robards moved away, giving her command over the floor. “Early this morning, a victim was discovered in Diagon Alley.” Hermione flicked her wand, and files appeared on the table.
“I got something for you,” Draco said softly, and there was a quality in his eyes that Harry couldn’t quite identify.
The conversation was punctuated by distinct groans of pleasure from everyone at the table. Harry knew he was a good cook, even great at times, but the dish had turned out remarkably well. Draco gazed at Harry with a glowing fondness in his eyes. It made his stomach twist and turn at the sight, and he felt warm all over. Still, that feeling was overcome by a wave of despair at the fact that it wasn’t real. Sometimes it was easy to pretend it was, and other times it was painfully hard.
piled high next to Luna’s fireplace. He proceeded to apologise, but Luna was already placing them carefully back together with her wand.
“Now that the pleasantries are out of the way, may I ask why you’ve come so far from London?” Narcissa says coolly. There is no malice or disdain in her tone, rather a gentle and impassive curiosity.
Harry knows he’s lying when he shakes his head, but he forces himself to take a breath and think before he speaks, which is something very new for him. He’s embarrassed by how many times he has to remind himself they aren’t schoolchildren anymore. “You’re allowed to have friends. I won’t be the one to get in the way of that,” he says.
“I told him he was a bastard like his father,” Harry said quietly, “I shouldn’t have said that, I know.”
Harry feels like he’s walked into some sort of alternate universe where, suddenly, Slytherins and Gryffindors actually can get along. He’d known, albeit bitterly, that it was possible for a while, Blaise and Ginny’s picture-perfect relationship being the perfect example of such, but he often finds himself hard-pressed to let go of the past and is surprised that his fellow schoolmates are not.
Harry doesn't falter. He takes the steps two at time as Theo ventures back out into the sitting room. Pansy is curled protectively around Draco, whose eyes are closed, but is breathing heavily enough to indicate that he’s awake.
Now, hearing the clanging of pots and pans as Harry struggled to summon the right one was oddly endearing.
“Draco?” he called out into the empty house. He breathed, attempting to slow his heartbeat at the lack of a response.
“You know,” Oli mused, tucking back a strand of Harry’s hair and studying his forehead, “Tall, fit blokes who have interesting scars.”
“You know.” Draco removes his wand from his pocket, Harry can feel the magic. “Franklin is fantastic, and if you’d used him, we wouldn’t be here today. Take these off.”
They entered the museum, passing through metal detectors at the front. Malfoy looked confused but followed behind Harry, emptying their items in the plastic bin. The security guard stared at the foreign currency suspiciously, but she let them through anyway as if to say she didn’t want an explanation. Soon enough, they were inside.
“I don’t want to give up, but I’m tired,” Harry said honestly, and Ron pasted on a sympathetic smile.
Malfoy reached forward to touch the deep blue denim of Harry’s jeans and snatched his hand back as if it had been burned. Harry felt a low pull in his stomach at Malfoy’s hand on his upper thigh. It had been a long while since someone had touched him there at all.
Harry knew he should’ve felt remorse, or even the slightest inkling of guilt, especially when confronted so viscerally with the products of his actions. The feelings didn’t come through. The magic in his veins buzzed excitedly at eliciting any and every adverse reaction from Draco. It fed off of his pain and misery and redirected the energy toward Harry instead.
As the anticipation builds, he finds his head clearing just a bit. It feels better to know that he won’t need to force a romantic relationship if he doesn’t want one, but he’ll have to maintain a friendship at least. He hopes it’ll be someone nice, someone sensitive to his reservations too.
His eyes reluctantly followed the noise, settling upon a man standing at the head of the table. His stature revealed he’d been the one to buy Draco a drink earlier in the evening. He held two burnt auburn drinks in his hands, sliding one across the table and taking a seat next to Draco. The bar had quieted at his movement but resumed raucous conversation when they realised the man’s attention had focused somewhere else.
“The ends justify the means,” Harry told a particular chocolate cosmo as he clipped weeds away from its stem. He gave it an affectionate pat on its petals, moving to the next one down the line.
Pain flashed across Draco’s features, but he tucked it away as quickly as it had come. “Fuck you, Potter. You know nothing about me. Don’t pretend to.”
Harry stuffed the shirt into Draco’s mouth ruthlessly instead. “Quit talking.” The command was swift, and Draco’s mouth snapped closed around the button-down instead. Harry couldn’t bother to look at his face.
Opal leaped from the hollow of Luna’s lap and stretched idly against the carpeted floors. The soft thud of noise that accompanied her meeting with the ground startled Draco. He looked down at his hands, nervously, feeling as though a schoolteacher was scolding him.
Harry put down his fork, and it clattered against the plate with a jarring and unpleasant noise. He narrowed his eyes. “Then don’t.”
Draco nods, as though it makes perfect sense. “This whole situation is quite off-putting, isn’t it?”
Hums of agreement indicated that nobody minded. Harry swirled his glass around, taking an experimental sip of the Sauvignon Blanc that Draco had chosen. It was good and tasted a little citrusy. Of course, Draco had chosen a wine to pair well with the meal. Harry, probably, would have accidentally selected a red.
The little inkling in his mind magnified quickly at Draco’s slight reprieve of its presence. He knew that could not be a good sign.
Up ahead, a crackle of electricity surged through the streets as a lightning bolt energetically splintered across the sky. Knockturn plunged into blinding darkness, and Draco could barely make out Harry’s figure from up the road. He seemed to be walking without any effect from the weather. As if it were a regular day, and he was completing weekend errands. Draco pulled his robes up higher over his head, taking care to cover his hair.
“Potter,” she growls, reaching an arm out to drag Harry inside. She slams the door quickly behind him, and it clicks shut. “You don’t breathe a word of this to anyone or I’ll personally finish what Voldemort started with you, are we clear?”
Draco’s legs grew liquid as he swung them over the side of his hospital bed. But he was determined to stand, if not just for one hug. He swore as his unsteady feet hit the cold ground, feeling socks slip a little on the tile.
“We have a few questions before they move you to Azkaban. If you cooperate completely, there’s a chance we may suggest a reduced sentence to the Wizengamot. You have a right to an attorney but have waived this already. Is this clear, and do you understand?”
“Would it be strange if I asked you to stay?” Draco asks, and when Harry looks at him, he’s twirling a quill between his fingers like he had been in the evening before. A nervous habit, perhaps.
“Mr Potter, I unfortunately cannot try again. To reach back into your magical core would be too dangerous at this point. I am certain of the name.” Ethel fidgets against the desk, as though she’d rather be anywhere in the entire world than in the room with Harry.
Harry Apparates them to Grimmauld Place, as Draco’s body isn’t strong enough to do so. The mere idea of that is enough to upset him.
Harry had turned his attention back to breakfast, but Draco was hardly hungry enough to eat a plate of food that he already didn’t want.
Another swift tug uprooted a small, encroaching weed from beneath the thistle stem. Technically the plants themselves were an invasive species and were generally classified as weeds in their own right. But Draco had grown protective of the little things, maybe because they represented an escape. A solution. Perhaps they gave him something to actively care about. They were just about all he had left, no matter which explanation was the more accurate one.
Draco felt desperate and open, and the desire to be filled up with the entirety of Harry was almost overwhelming. He lost himself entirely in the sensations sometimes.
“Er, I don’t know.” Harry shrugged. “Last night, I kind of just ran away after everything. I didn’t really mean to, I just got overwhelmed and thought I could figure it all out later.”
“I did say that, yes. I know we haven’t been to a Muggle restaurant yet, but I thought there wouldn’t be any harm in trying one. It could fit under the aesthetics section, you know.”
“You do not understand?” Dumbledore questions him, finally turning to look at Harry. “Aurors have combed through your memories, Harry. Draco Malfoy attempted to use the Cruciatus curse on you, and you were acting in self-defense. You have already been tried at the Wizengamot and found innocent. But you will be monitored, and you will not argue.”
“This is Draco,” Harry announces as though no one recognises him from the war, from his father’s hair.
“No, I’m not,” Harry says defensively. “Why the hell would you be skulking around a corner like that, how was I supposed to know?”
was already playing on the channel, and Harry knew it was horribly cheesy because he’d spent countless nights watching movies alone. Draco would never admit he loved a sappy romantic comedy, but Harry let it play anyway knowing it would be appreciated even in secret.
He reaches the Hampstead stop soon after that. Using a discreet Point-Me Charm, he takes a deliberate right onto Heath Street, trudging down the dimly lit main road toward what can only be the general area of Mansfield Place. It’s a nice area, Harry thinks, as he begins his walk down a narrow, wooded path. It’s too dark for him to make out more than shapes, but he knows that if it were light out the whole place would be green and lush and gorgeous.
Draco is shrugging on a light jumper, a deep cobalt colour that brings out the blue in his eyes. He’s gained some weight back, and the jumper doesn’t look like it’s two sizes too large anymore. He fills it out better than he would’ve some time ago. Harry can’t help but drag his eyes up and down Draco’s frame.
Had Draco really only stayed because Harry had been panicking? It was possible. But it was also likely that he had wanted to stay because his husband was hurting and he loved him. That at least was true.
That evening, Harry left supper early. He sat with Ginny and Luna, who came over from the Ravenclaw table to join the Gryffindor’s group. Ron encircled himself with Dean and Seamus, purposefully laughing loudly at their jokes. Hermione shook her head at both of them. It wasn’t her first time being caught in between one of their fights, and she didn’t deserve to be put in such an uncomfortable position. Harry admired her for bothering to put up with the two of them at all.
The cake in her hands was simple and plain — cream frosting with a mint and vanilla sponge. Harry, in the past years, had always brought Draco a decadent chocolate for his birthday. He wondered if Ginny knew his husband better than he did. It didn’t make him angry, like the way Draco paid more attention to the damn owl, but it did incite a little sadness.
Harry shrugs. “What’s the use of having money if you can’t use it to make the people you care about happy.” He holds open the door for Draco. “Are you coming?”
He set to work in front of Harry, using a compact box with spikes to grind the plant into a type of grainy substance. Harry had never seen the contraption before, and enjoyed watching Draco’s long fingers work their way around the box. He chatted mindlessly about his day, his studies, and the other Slytherin’s that populated his life. Harry let him talk, relishing the rough clicks of the box and the sound of Draco’s voice.
“But I’m not hurting anyone,” Draco begins to argue, distressed. “I just need something to help me forget.”
“It’s alright. This way, we’ll see if whatever he has to offer is worthwhile,” Harry said, his tone clipped and professional. Locke could see through it, of course, but he needed to keep up a pretence for Ron at the very least.
“Well, what’s stopping you from opening a store in a Muggle neighbourhood?” Harry asks. He puts his work aside and comes to join Draco at the countertop.
“Don’t act like you don’t know what it means,” Draco said tightly, but he kept his voice low and controlled so their guests wouldn’t overhear.
“How did you feel when you first found out?” Draco asks, his gaze unfocused and distant. He has a hard time grounding himself in reality as of late.
“Makes sense actually, McGonagall probably wants you to make sure he doesn’t get up to anything suspicious. Keep an eye on him or something.”
It was something he’d gotten used to anyway after the Ministry had decided he was too valuable to risk in fieldwork, even on a critical case like this one. “You’d think they’d just give up on this now. Doesn’t seem like we’ll be having a breakthrough anytime soon.”
With a loud crack, Draco had vanished from the front stoop of the bar. Harry was left feeling bewildered and a little empty. He had looked forward to this moment all week, and quite suddenly, Draco decided to keep avoiding him. He was confused about why they hadn’t apparated together after all this time of doing so. Harry wasn’t sure what he had done wrong, that he had done anything wrong. Nothing too terrible had taken place in their outing to Perth, but Harry certainly felt as though something in their dynamic shifted. He would never voice to Draco that it felt a touch like a date because it was obvious now that his feelings were unreciprocated. Luna had been wrong after all.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice was passive in a way that unsettled Draco more than if he had simply decided to yell.
“No, no,” Harry says. “There’s nothing wrong with any of that. I just need to speak to him. It’s a personal matter.”
“You know I didn’t actually kill her,” he said gleefully, and Harry gripped his seat harder in an attempt to subdue a flare of anger. “Was probably that nasty ex-boyfriend of hers, you know? Though, it’s not my business anyway. He was a right piece of work, but that girl, she needed some controlling. You know how
Malfoy rolled his eyes and grabbed it anyway, and before Harry knew it, they were twisting through the blackness and promptly landed in the outdoors. The first thing he noticed was the loss of warmth from Malfoy’s hand. It had been softer than he expected, and he kind of missed the touch.
“How could you have been surprised that something like this would happen?” Draco said, and the disappointment in his tone was enough to allow a few tears to squeeze out of Harry’s eyes.
“There’s a plant in trials here at St Mungo’s. It is colloquially known as milk thistle. You may know of it. We select candidates for trial with the substance based on the characterisation of their addiction. Seeing as much of your journey toward recovery will be more mental than physical, we find you to be a good match for this study.”
A flash of Draco crushing small leaves together in his palm. Stirring something milky-white into his tea.
It was awfully stupid of Harry to show up without a disguise to such a public place. He supposed it was Knockturn, and no one would talk anyway, but it made Draco angrier to know that Harry wasn’t even bothering to hide in the shadows like the rest of the crowd at the bar.
A shock of pleasure rushes through as he feels Draco press up against him, swaying to the music. Harry’s body moves with the beat, frenzied and unrestrained and probably wildly unattractive, though he can’t find it in himself to care. There’s no self-consciousness left to critique and pick apart every little aspect of his appearance anymore. He simply moves in a way that makes him feel good, enjoying how Draco’s warm arms wrap around his waist and pull him close.
“Sometimes.” Harry strained, draining the rest of his wine glass in one go. Draco barely made a dent in his own.
Harry should have felt guilty, really. But any regret was overshadowed by a pounding sense of relief that Draco hadn’t been able to leave him yet. He’d take this Draco, the depressive and empty one, over a happy one that wasn’t his to have. Because how could Draco be happy if he wasn’t with him?
Harry knew the answer before he asked, but he needed to be sure. “Ron, you’re not acting like this because I’m bi–”
Harry knew that the only reason Hermione knew so much about the program was because the second she’d found out about it, she had gone and purchased an entire shelf of books to familiarise herself with the concept. He often wondered if maybe he should’ve done a little more research on the subject too. If anything, so he wouldn't seem so clueless on the matter.
“Do you want some?” Draco asks, his fingers twitching as he attempts to point at the spot where Harry had noticed the white powder earlier.
They chatter mindlessly over lunch, and Harry tries not to think about the flirting. He focuses on how good the food is and how lovely it is to see Draco open up to his family. Everyone takes to him quickly. He’s much sweeter and softer than any of them remember. Hermione, under her breath, makes this comment to Harry a few times, and he nods knowingly.
Harry paused for a moment as his magic stretched out in long hot tendrils around his body. Seconds later, he shattered every window in the house.
Harry would be lying if he said he wasn’t worried about Draco’s weight. There wasn’t anything to indicate an eating disorder or something of that sort, but he seems to be particularly bad at taking care of himself. When explaining this fact to Ron at the office earlier in the morning, Harry had been angry with Theo and Pansy and their lack of involvement in getting Draco back up on his feet. Ron had said that things weren’t so simple.
The sound of bees. Buzzing in tandem at the front of their hive. Flowers. Milk thistle. Remembering.
It was his duty to solve this case for the sake of the Marchand family, but he knew every break in their investigation would lead one step back to him. He wondered how long this could go on for. How long he could continue lying to the people around him and the profession he pledged himself to.
“I do not understand why.” Malfoy had walked up to another statue, and this one was kneeling to the ground, gently picking up a fallen sword. “They are just people. Muggle people, at that.”
“At Grimmauld Place, my home. I have a kit from the Ministry. They have Aurors carry it around, it has something for drug reactions. I’m sure of it.”
He realizes through gasping breaths that Malfoy is trying to say something and positions the boys head in his lap. He bears a resemblance to a beautiful statue of a Saint, crying out a river of blood. The sight makes Harry’s stomach curdle.
“Oh, I know work is fine.” Ginny smiled, but it was pitiful, and Harry found himself wanting to turn away from it. “How are
She angled her Prefect’s badge toward Harry. He’d forgotten entirely that McGonagall appointed her, though it made sense. Luna was as fair and responsible as any Ravenclaw.
There was a brief silence before Clove gathered herself to respond. It was only natural to be intimidated by Narcissa. “While there are no guarantees, milk thistle has been known to clear the mind effectively. In therapy, Draco mentioned hearing a voice in his head. This is common among many patients experiencing hallucinations, and the thistle should aid in removing those entirely. Additionally, Draco’s denial of his condition hinders his recovery and only extends his stay in our ward. We want him to get better too, and this will help.”
“That we are,” Harry says, reminded of what waits for the two of them outside the door. “Come sit down.”
The bed barely shifted under Draco as he moved to sit up involuntarily, catching his legs on the side of the bedframe and staring, low and hollow, at the cabinet in front of him.
When Harry reaches his bed, it's like sweet release. He immediately draws the bed curtains, casting a silencing charm that would ensure no one could hear in, and he could not hear out. In an instant, he releases a blood-curdling scream. He rests his forehead against the wood of the headboard and just yells and cries, alternating between the two and banging his head against the wall until it is bloody. Seeing blood itself makes him weepy again, so he heals the open wounds and decides maybe injuring himself isn't the right way to go about the grieving process. It's strangely cathartic, but disconcerting that he can't seem to naturally stop himself. Once he has grown tired of shouting, and his voice has become rusty and raw, he curls himself into his sheets. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees Malfoy in the backs of his eyelids. He sees him smile and laugh and taunt him like he's still a real person. Harry was so scared. He is scared of himself for what he’s done, and he's afraid he will never be able to move on.
“You know,” she said, acquiring a look in her eye that made Harry’s stomach turn. He already knew what was coming before she said it. “My mother used to make these for me whenever I was having a particularly tough time.”
Draco did cry out, pressing fingers to his temples as a rush of information eclipsed his senses. It was like a door had been unlocked in his mind. Memories came rushing through.
“I was thinking you’d let me take this off?” Harry asked quietly. “You can say no, of course. If you’re not comfortable.”
Luna beams, her ocean eyes shining bright and sharp. “We’re very lucky, Harry,” she says softly. “How are you?”
“For saving your life,” Malfoy corrects, with a soft click of his tongue. “Let’s not belittle the matter.”
Harry knew if he was going to stave off any concerns, now was the time to do it. If Ginny caught on to anything, even the slightest of details, she would turn into a hunting hound. And she wouldn’t stop until her prey was situated securely between her teeth.
“That’s not a bad theory. It would account for a lot.” Draco paused, chancing a look up at Luna. She met his gaze, and her mouth arranged itself into a warm smile.
They seated themselves at the communal table in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron, claiming one side while a family of four took the other. Once they ordered, Ginny asked the question Harry had been dreading the entire time they were together.
Draco takes a breath. “I suppose what I mean is that everyone deserves to have someone good. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.”
There was a time at Hogwarts when Harry knew Draco to wear the most perfectly tailored outfits, as though every piece of clothing was exactly sized to his measurements. Now, he seems to prefer sweatpants, loose jumpers and coats that are far too large for his frame.
“He confessed what seems like ages ago. Shacklebolt had said they wanted the story to make paper headlines first thing the morning after, but I guess there must have been some kind of delay.”
Draco sucked in a shallow breath, taking a sip of his drink to regain a sense of reality that was slipping away rapidly. “Yeah?” he said uncomfortably. He hadn’t quite realised how wanting it sounded until Carrow’s pupils dilated against the stark white of his eyes. Draco averted his gaze, focusing on a nail scratch on the surface of the wooden tabletop.
“I can understand that,” Harry offers. He looks out the window to see two children playing in the snow. “Do you know who yours is yet?”
“Draco,” he smiles encouragingly, turning him forward by the hips. “I think it’s wonderful that you want to do that. I just don’t know if I should come with you for the first time.”
Swears littered Draco’s lips as Harry took him, sliding his tongue up and down Draco’s shaft. He paused at the tip, licking slowly down and never breaking eye contact from Draco in the process. He felt his cock hit the back of Harry’s throat, but Harry didn’t move away. Instead, he went back for more eagerly, responding to the little noises Draco made in response, his cheeks hollowed as he groaned through the movements.
“You won’t be. We’ve been using it to aid patients for years, and it’s only still in trials due to the volatility of its synthetic counterpart in labs.”
“How did you sleep? Thank you for taking me to bed last night. I really enjoyed the film.” Words were tumbling from Draco’s mouth before he could stop them, and it took all of his willpower not to slap a free hand over his mouth to halt the flow.
The group, sparing Malfoy, clinked their beers together, and some foam dribbled down the sides. Harry thought he could get used to the familiarity of all this. He desperately loved Ron and Hermione but wondered what it would be like to have a group of guy friends of his own. He wouldn’t mind it, especially if they all were as pleasing to look at as these were.
Harry can’t see, but he can picture Ron making a face in response as the wood creaks and Draco presumably bends down in front of him.
Harry couldn’t remember Pauline at all from Hogwarts but knew for a fact that she wouldn’t have looked like this then. An unwavering sense of melancholy had replaced her charm. She looked like an addict, with hollowed cheeks and sunken eyes that sat behind the grimmest of smiles to have ever plagued the earth.
“Yeah, er, I was hoping I could speak with Malfoy—no, sorry, Draco,” Harry says, stumbling over his words like he’s speaking for the first time. “I have some business with him and it’s quite urgent.”
“I won’t complain,” Draco replies, attaching himself to Harry’s side and nuzzling into his neck. “I could stay like this forever.”
When he and Ron entered the doorway at the other side, they saw the prisoner was bound to a chair; his arms stretched forward in leather straps that pulled taut across the bare skin of his arms and tugged at existing cuts and scrapes. He glanced up at the intrusion, balking immediately at Harry’s appearance, recognising him.
“Now, now, Weasley,” Draco smirked, standing up as Ron postured next to him. Ron was bigger, but Draco was easily more intimidating. “There’s no need for a silly argument, you could have just asked if you wanted to join. I’ll be on my way.”
Draco began to interrupt, but Clove regarded him with a stern eye that forced his mouth closed. Narcissa seemed pleased at this.
“I’ve always noticed there seems to be a fine line between love and obsession,” Hermione said seriously, but even she didn’t seem too upset with Harry either. He wondered if he was still dreaming. “But you know, if he calls me the m-word again, I’ll expect you to hex him.”
“Maybe,” he mused, to placate her. “I just don’t know what’s causing all of this, and it’s making me nervous.”
“After all that has happened in our world, I think it is wise to rethink our Muggle Studies classes and how our students’ educations benefit from the curriculum. I believe you two will work well together and bring different strengths and perspectives to the table when reworking the course. You will
The boardroom was large and long, unlike many of the other rooms in the Auror department. It wasn’t bare and simplistic but rather covered in photos, wanted posters, missing posters, coffee shop flyers, etc. The walls themselves were a burnt orange hue, the wooden table that ran long across the room was splintering from years of wear, and there was coffee and tea in the corner. The Aurors didn’t have a break room, so when Ron decided the boardroom was the perfect replacement, everyone seemed to follow along. They spent their lunch breaks and free time at the table as a group.
Instead, he trudged around the garden in Harry’s work boots that were two sizes too large and lamented his entire existence.
It had been so long since Draco had teased Harry like this, and he could feel the tears behind his eyes before they came. They trailed down his face incessantly before he could swallow them in, and he felt weaker than ever before. Harry’s hand went to cover his mouth as he stifled a sob. He turned, hoping Draco would ignore him and just go back inside as he usually would. But strong arms wrapped around Harry from behind, and he felt a head press into his neck.
“But what if Harry did do something awful, Ron? He’s been acting so strangely lately…what if he did hurt Draco? Blaise was really angry…it must have been something horrible…” she said fretfully, her mind reeling with possibilities, each more horrific than the last. “He’s not been right for a while now, he could have done something really terrible… What if it was an Unforgivable Curse or something? He could go to Azkaban!” she cried, losing her composure more and more with every word.
“What list would that be?” he asked in a sneering sort of way, having no idea what to expect. Harry looked at him and smiled.
“Now then, Harry... I’m sure you will be relieved to know that Mr Malfoy will make a full recovery, given some time.” Dumbledore said. Harry let out the breath he hadn’t realised he'd been holding, one that was threatening to burst his lungs, and nodded.
“When I was 15, over the summer before 5th year.” He said, turning his head to the side, away from Harry. He wasn’t crying, but his jaw was tight and his voice shaky and quiet. “Someone…someone came to the house and…” he stopped, then looked at Harry with those stormy eyes. There was pain in his eyes, more pain than Harry had ever seen, caged inside a body and mind that desperately denied it was there. “It was…V-…V-…” he looked frustrated for a moment, as if trying to say the name but couldn’t.
happened, he didn't think they could be friends anymore. He could feel the cold rock in his stomach, the dreadful one that stopped him eating and made it hard to breathe sometimes.
“Look at me, Draco.” She said firmly, and he tried to. “It will be fine, your father won’t find out unless you want him to.” She said, and he nodded, taking deep breaths. “You’re in so much pain, Draco…let us help you, please.” She begged, her expression desperate. He looked at her, then at Blaise, startled to find the same concerned expression. He sighed and nodded.
“Ron’s mum makes them every year, they’re really comfy. I’ve got 7 now, they’re always different. Last year was a golden stitch.” He said, smiling. Draco didn’t seem to know how to react to this information, so he nodded and returned to his meal. Harry regarded him for a moment, feeling a little sad, and did the same.
“Why…?” he asked very softly, his eyes half-lidded as he stared at Harry, his lips looked dry. Harry stared back for a moment, then sighed, looking down as he shook his head.
the one looking after you now, Anthony and that will leave you alone. They don't want to piss him off, do they? Even they aren't that stupid." He still didn't look convinced, though a soft flush was creeping towards his nose. He also didn't mention that they were the ones to get on the wrong side of Potter. He was a worthy adversary... But Draco shook his head.
“Yeah, I think that would be good, thanks.” Blaise said, knowing Draco’s sleeping troubles too. Goyle nodded and went to their dormitory to retrieve his stash. Not being 18, the liquor would be confiscated immediately should any of the teachers find it, though most of the older students were eager to partake in, or at least condoned, such contraband. Goyle returned with the bottle and the set of crystal shot glasses Draco gave him for his birthday, and poured one out for each of them, saying it would be a good nightcap for everyone. Blaise gently coaxed Draco to take his shot, clinked his own with it, and swallowed the warming liquid. Draco’s tired eyes watched the others down their own shots, before following their leads. He wanted to feel numb for a while.
“Psurentitia.” It said in Harry’s voice. “He’ll think you went shopping, and bought this.” He said placing the singing lullaby gadget Harry had purchased earlier on the bench beside Crabbe. “He’ll think you came in here when the snow got too heavy. He won’t remember anything of what really happened. Good night, Draco.” He said, released Immobulus and his other protection charms, but his Monster forced him stay and watch.
"I could say the same about you. The amount of pressure you must be under…-" he seemed to catch himself before saying any more, standing up too. "Well, I'll see you on Monday then, I suppose." He said, brushing past him to get to the just-appearing door. He opened it a crack, peeking out to check the coast was clear.
The werewolf grinned his hideous teeth at him, one long thick clawed hand drawing his wand slowly from his belt, equally long, thick and clawed. Greyback wasn't a powerful wizard by any stretch of the imagination, he hardly used his gnarled wand at all, but he could cast his fair share of horrifyingly painful spells.
He watched himself be flipped over, could feel pillows suffocating him as he held the fabric between his teeth, and was driven into again. He felt the Bite as Greyback came, faster than usual. He hadn't been allowed to bite him before, but he'd seen it coming, hence the potion.
Harry kissed Draco deeply, his hand in the blond’s hair, thrusting as deep as he possibly could, pushing Draco’s hips up off the mattress, his spine bowed. Draco screamed into the kiss, his insides tightening impossibly around Harry’s cock, and Harry felt himself plunging into the deepest, purest pleasure he’d ever felt, like electricity in his blood as he pumped Draco full of his cum, moaning into Draco’s mouth.
Draco was sobbing freely, his voice muffled by Harry’s hand as the Potter raped him for the third time. He tried to fight several more times, swinging weak punches and kicks at Harry but none of them landed very effectively. The Monster seemed angry that it couldn’t watch Draco being raped because of Harry’s farsightedness, so It forced Harry’s body to lean over him, their chests pressing together like they were making love, like they were a couple, Harry kissing and biting Draco’s neck, but Draco’s sobs and the scent of blood broke this twisted illusion. The Monster happily listened to the sobs and whimpers coming from Draco, knowing he was truly trapped under Harry’s weight, and in too much pain to struggle with any power.
They got to the door to the office and Dumbledore opened it, holding it for Harry to walk in first. The teenager took a deep breath, mildly reassured by the old man’s encouraging smile, and walked inside.
"First, how many Muggles and Muggle-borns have you murdered, personally? Half-bloods, non-wizards, creatures, blood traitors?" Ron asked, tone flat and sharp like a dagger. Draco swallowed thickly, his eyes darting towards Harry only to remember Ron's command and stopped himself.
“Is this true, Potter…?” McGonagall asked slowly, her voice tight, almost tremulous. Blaise turned his head to look at Harry when he saw him nodding, and he was surprised to see he was crying, tears rolling down his cheeks.
He knew it was ridiculous for that to be the thing he was shocked by, after he'd spent Christmas Eve being fucked by Potter within an inch of his life, but this felt by far the strangest turn of events. He'd never considered how Potter must feel, dealing with all this ‘Chosen One’ nonsense; being the only person in the world who
"What's this about, Malfoy?" Harry asked, grumbling, as he put the sandwich platter down on the coffee table. Draco leaned forward immediately to pick two of the roast beef and horseradish ones up, balancing one on the arm of the sofa as he delicately ate the other. He swallowed politely before speaking, licking his lips.
"I'll explain inside. Good thinking though, I'm hungry." He said, pacing back and forth before the blank wall. Harry sighed, leaning against the opposite wall as they waited for the doors to appear. Draco glanced at him as he pushed open the elobrate wood door, rolling his eyes.
Harry doesn’t know how to answer. He owes it to Draco to tell him, to reassure him that he’s not all alone in the world, and there actually is someone out there who wants him more than anything. Because if there’s one thing Harry’s willing to admit to himself now, it’s that he wants Draco. And he wants him in a way that is growing far past physical attraction.
Carrow’s grip only tightened at the protest, drawing distinct pleasure from Draco’s fear. “I’m going to ruin you,” he murmured, lips brushing ever so slightly against the skin of Draco’s ear.
Harry was shocked at the revelation but is unable to express it well. Instead, he wants to argue Snape’s statement. When he begins to open his mouth, Snape gives Harry a bruising glare.
“Alright.” Draco sighed heavily, pulling away from Harry as though he had completed a task. He left for the bedroom without a second glance.
“Me and Malfoy?” Harry struggled to get the words out, but he knew what Ron was talking about now. Their lips were about to touch when Ron had walked in on their private moment. And he’d been hanging out with Draco for weeks, unconsciously avoiding his two best friends.
The potion itself seemed to have been potent enough to last all day, but Harry wondered when it would need to be administered again.
listen in though, following Azalea’s affirmations and self-reflections as she continues with the group. When it’s time to share, he is surprised to see Ollie offer to go first.
“Don’t you dare.” Harry’s eyes flashed angrier than they had when Locke had the nerve to mention Sirius. Draco was different. Draco was his.
It was those kinds of moments that Harry lost out on entirely, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to let them go just yet.
The visual in the mirror was terrifying. His body stood there, same as it always was, still and unmoving. But his mouth, it was someone else's, the voice someone else’s, but it was coming from somewhere deep within himself. Draco looked away and then back to make sure he wasn’t losing his shit entirely. But he gazed into the mirror, and there was his reflection, smiling back at him with an unnerving intent.
Harry leaves, feeling distinctly like his tail is caught between his legs. Theo’s not in the bedroom when he returns to it, gathering his trousers and coat like he’s leaving the site of a particularly awkward one night stand. In many ways, his night with Draco seems to reflect such an experience.
Harry leads them to a small bakery around the corner, and Draco finds a seat by the large windows while he goes to order. It’s beginning to snow outside, little spots of white stippling the glass. Draco pulls his cap down to cover his ears.
It doesn’t take them long to get to the landing with Draco dazed and pliant in Harry’s hands. Harry finds himself surprised at how okay he is with having Draco in his arms. How nice it feels to just touch someone like this, and care for them. The door to his bedroom is already open, streaming soft yellow light from inside. Harry takes him to the bed, pulling back gauzy curtains to reveal an unmade bed. There’s a tray in the middle of the sheets, with hardcover books stacked on top of one another. Harry pretends not to notice the baggies.
That’s what he decided to go with, as stressing out for the rest of his work day wouldn’t do him any good. Maybe, in a moment of panic, he’d tensed in front of Ginny and couldn’t reveal how he really felt. That was more likely than a random curse or illness rendering him unable to think for himself. That or he’d been secretly struck by the Imperius Curse, but that was a ridiculous and unfounded thought.
Until he registered it was primarily his cock getting hot and pushing against the lace. He could feel Harry erection pressing against his right hipbone.
“Of course”, Harry said and smiled broadly, “I really enjoyed it too, I am glad I ran into you the other day.”
“I had an idea while preparing breakfast. What about we make a list. A list with all the things you would like to try.”
“Ah, I see, well then, welcome to the neighborhood. If you’re interested, I know a restaurant on Shaftesbury, that might suit your taste.”
They turned left into Harry’s street, and when they passed a dark alley, Draco pushed Harry inside it, up against the wall and kissed him hard.
Draco’s eyes were closed, and he breathed deeply, still trying to catch his breath. Harry made quick work of replacing his cock with the small plug, laying next to them. He fell down on the bed next to Draco, who had started quivering. The blanket had been abandoned, and Harry put it back over the both of them, leaving them in a cocoon of warmth. He pulled Draco close, wrapping him in his arms.
But Harry only varied it from quick squeezes to a long pressure, milking every last drop of cum out.
Slightly pushing against his cock, he moved it inside his hole. It felt amazing, finally having a cock inside him, and feeling his velvety insides on his sensible cockhead. The forbidden feeling of it only added to his arousal.
The day went by and he was getting hungry, so he got in the kitchen, making himself a few tortellini with a creamy cheese sauce and peas. He enjoyed it while watching something on his television.
Dinner went by without much talking. They enjoyed their food a great deal and after eating all 5 courses they both felt rather full.
After having had five clients alone before lunch, Draco already felt on edge. He was feeling off since leaving the building in the morning. All those unanswered questions, turning around in his head. ‘Should I have woken him?’, ‘Will he call me?’, ‘Did he also enjoy the last night?’, ‘Are we going to see each other again?’, ‘Do I want to see him again?’, ‘What, if he doesn’t call?’, it was a never ending spiral of questions he couldn’t answer. He always felt a little off after an evening, of cumming so hard he felt dizzy, but today with all the unclearness hovering above him, it felt worse than usual. He was looking forward to a early night, getting his bearings together. Only two more clients after his break and he could call it a day. Working as a financial advisor, usually came easy to him, and he really did like his job, but on a day like this is was extra hard being polite to those stoic businessmen and women, frequenting his office. He usually didn’t do many clients on a Saturday, but being shortly after new year, people wanted to get order in their financial status and needed assistance doing so.
The moment Harry’s arm came back to the daylight, a huge amount of lube came gliding back with it. Draco’s abused hole was red and angry look, it gaped hugely open and only made weak attempts at closing.
“Against better judgement, I must admit I really enjoyed spending time with you, even apart from the phenomenal sex, of course”, Draco said solemnly.
Putting new sheets on his bed, he left the bedroom. Taking his coat from the rack he got out the door and walked to a nearby apparition point and disappeared with a pop.
“Well, at least I would like to try it. Everything we tried just felt amazing and I was wondering how it would feel. I only start to realize how limited my few on sexuality has been. It was always a sort of taboo topic. Fucking a girl in missionary position, thinking about anything, until I was finally able to cum. That’s it I thought. It’s a whole new world, you’re opening up for me.”
Harry woke up the next morning his hand and cock covered in sticky and cold cum. He got up, threw his sheets in the hamper and went to the shower in his ensuite bathroom.
They slowly made it across the street, there were only very few street lamps shining and they had to look where they walk.
Draco seemed more alert through the shiftings of his body, Harry looked up at him and told him to breath deeply. The palm of Harry’s hand was placed crosswise over Draco’s lower stomach and Draco who seemed to be a little nervous grabbed it with both hands holding him tight.
Draco saw Harry getting unsure, whether he should dress himself or stay stark naked, so Draco made the decision for him. “Carry me to bed?”,
He put some fresh shower gel on his hand and put four fingers back inside his anus. Massaging his prostate from the outside with his thumb and from the inside pushing against the little knob with his fingers. Stroking and squeezing it.
Draco seemed to get it and pulled his fingers out, when they breached the surface of the water, he looked at the sticky cum, coating them. Cautiously he moved them towards his face, sticking his tongue out and tasting it.
Always circling around the plug in a slow motion, Harry continued working more of the ointment in Draco’s hole. After a while Draco relaxed back, realizing, no pain was coming from Harry’s treatment.
Harry had turned onto his back, fast asleep and lightly snoring he looked so at ease with the world around him. Draco noticed the eyeliner not being smudged in the least. His deeply tanned skin seemed to glow in the dark-grey bedsheets, even though the sun wasn’t up yet, and apart from the city lights it was dark in the room. Draco put the note on his nightstand, leaving his flat to drive to his office.
When he let the spent cock slip from his mouth, he accioed a small silicone plug, together with its remote. He held it up, silently asking for permission. Draco still in post-orgasm state nodded lightly.
Harry realized where this was going, but didn’t want to give in that easily. He brought his now empty plate back in the kitchen and went to the bathroom to get a certain remote.
A kiss was placed on Harry’s temple, he turned to Draco and kissed him hotly. His cock aching, with need for release, he grinded it against Draco’s thigh.
“I don’t know, I feel weird. Like I am about to be sick or something. And I am shaking”, Draco answered sounding small and lost, he held his hand up to show Harry how it wouldn’t stay steady.
They walked a few buildings down the street, turned to the right, and there they were. In front of Bill & Fleur’s restaurant. In the entryway a waitress asked them for their coats, and brought them to their table in a separated booth in the far left corner. Piano music was playing softly in the background.
Harry nearly doubled over with laughter, but remembered to increase the intensity to a pulsating vibration. Draco paused, looked down between them, and quieted down. The plug now vibrated audibly in the quiet bathroom, Draco looked back up at Harry, his cock already standing to attention.
He began pulling Draco’s panties down, seeing the blue gem of the plug from last night sparkling in the dimmed light. He looked up at Draco, asking,” You kept it in?”,
“Well, maybe. I really enjoyed it too, just so you know. But about the fucking myself I might take you up on that idea.”
“One can do that, but the question is, do you want to? It is quite painful at first, and it stays loose for a few hours, you know.”, Harry answered, unsure, whether Draco was aware of what he was asking him.
Draco whimpered, when Harry pulled his finger out. He reached down to feel his abused sphincter for himself.
The jets of the spa were bubbling the moon was shining through the bathroom window and they were exchanging soft kisses. The time seemed to be standing still. After a while they stopped kissing, leaned back, looked at each other and just relaxed back into the pulsing of the jets. Out in the streets was a group of teenagers singing some song and trotting trough the streets. The stars were sparkling on the sky and Draco looked, as he so often did to his constellation. It became a habit of his to always make out his constellation, no matter where in the world he was. It gave him some sort of safety, knowing that no matter what happened the stars wouldn’t change, they would be there every night, no matter if he was in the middle of a war, out alone in a forest or in the arms of a loved one.
“Well, yeah” Draco said, “it somehow felt right.”. Harry grinned widely, softly touching the gem, that was pressed snuggly against Draco’s hole.
He turned the corner to walk in the direction of his building, when a hand grabbed him and pulled him into an alley. He tried to scream but his mouth was soon covered with warm, soft lips. He opened his eyes to see that it was Harry who he had talked to moments prior.
Without hesitation, Harry inserted his thumb, enlarging the diameter by a great deal, due to the angle. He wasn’t even back to his original Draco, once again, asked for another finger.
So he made it a point to come back to it at least every second weekend. He also didn’t want to miss the Sunday roast at the Weasley’s so it became his ritual to spend Saturday night at this club, and visiting his family on Sunday’s. The weekends he couldn’t make it were often spend in foreign country’s where travelling home required a special visa and a portkey. The world was a rather small place, when using magic.
Harry put his hand in Draco’s long sweaty hair and said, “Good little kitten”. That made Draco blush deeply but didn’t stop him from getting everything cleaned up.
Draco seemed farer gone that ever but when Harry passed his pelvic bone from the inside, and his the silhouette of his face shone through Draco’s abdominal skin, his panting and babbling became erratic. He started scrambling again, but every move he made was followed by a long moan, since he was rubbing his prostate against the far diameter of Harry’s lower arm.
After a while everything seemed to calm down, and Harry slowly tried pulling out  the rod of Draco’s bladder. It went without much resistance, since Draco seemed to have fallen asleep.
The door of his bedroom clicked and Harry activated the plug via the remote. He heard Draco yelp and jump out of surprise, and couldn’t help laughing.
Harry pressed the button for the elevator, and thankfully no one was inside. They drove up to the 17th floor and they stood in the middle of Draco’s living room.
Draco pointed the way towards his bedroom, forgetting that he might have left out some toys  to ‘play’ with, later in the night. Since he was living alone and never had friends coming over he had his collection gathered on his nightstand. He realized that the second Harry pushed the door open. So there were only to options, hurrying to put them away, or playing it cool. He decided for the latter. Harry took in his spacious bedroom with the huge windows, one of them directly over Draco’s bed. The door leading to a walk-in closet, a cozy armchair in front of the windows next to a huge shelf with books. And the two nightstands, one of which was covered in dildos and vibrators in all sorts and sizes. Next to them stood an half empty bottle of lube and a long chain with anal beads hung over the edge of the upper open drawer.
“Alright, you may cum when you can.”, Harry said, stopping the stimulation of his cock entirely, only squeezing his balls in the palm of his hand.
Harry started liking up and down Draco’s cock from the outside. After a few seconds Draco relaxed into it. Harry took all of his cock into his mouth and massaged the underside with his tongue.
“If I may speak for my part it felt great”, Harry whispered and kissed Draco again. Much softer but nonetheless urgent. He tipped his head to the side and licked Draco’s lower lip. Draco got the hint and opened his mouth slightly, answering with an just as eager tongue. They chased each other and explored their mouth’s, while rubbing their crotches rhythmically against each other.
After enjoying the air for a few more moments, he went to the kitchen to brew himself a cup of tea. Adjacent to his kitchen was a balcony with a little seating group, he took the theses and his tea outside to enjoy the sun a little more.
After moving away from Tori he threw himself in his work and most of the weekday evenings he fell asleep on the couch over several take-out boxes. It was the rare Sunday that he got to enjoy himself, wearing one his corsets, reading a good book by the fire and cooking an extravagant meal just for himself. Those were the days when he sometimes had used his huge Spa bathtub or all the functions of his rain shower. From those days he also had several essential oils nearby, with which he now made a concoction that he poured into the bath water. It was important to not use anything soap based, because the jets would produce so many bubbles that his whole bath would be swimming in them, as he had to learn the hard way.
When he felt steadier again, he slowly got up, rinsing himself and leaving the shower. He went to his bathroom again, smelling Harry in the air, he went to his closet and decided for a midnight blue lace string along with the suiting midnight blue lace corset. Because it wasn’t too warm in his flat, he decided to wear a loosely knitted grey over-sized sweater.
When he slipped fully inside, he noticed a dildo with a suction cup hanging on the inside of the spiral wall. It was a black, average sized one with a velvety smooth texture on it, he went back outside, to get the toy disinfectant he noticed on the shelf above the sink. He cleaned it and started showering.
Harry pushed his cock down, due to its length, the tip was below his hole and he had to push it into a U shape to enter. After the tip had popped in, the rest followed. The feeling was breathtaking and he let his head fall back, overwhelmed by the feeling of the hot tightness of his own arse.
When he was done he took out his notebook, thinking of ways to introduce the subjects to his new course, starting at the end of the week in Beauxbatons. It was a rather advanced course with 6 year students, and he didn’t have enough information on their progress, since he didn’t teach them before. It was bound to be an interesting few days, but he looked forward to it, nonetheless.
With Draco’s arse high up in the air, Harry slowly pulled out and quickly put the butt plug back in its place, to keep the cum inside Draco.
After a while they both felt like cumming. Harry turned around again, getting down to work on the butt plug, still in Draco’s arse. In one swift motion he pulled it out, and took it in his mouth, sucking it like the most delicious lollipop, it tasted so intimately like Draco, it was incredible.
He was teared out of his thoughts by someone clearing their throat behind him. He was trying to get his pants up quick, but the smile on the other mans face told him it was to late anyway. He closed his pants and made his was to the basins, when the man said, “Hello Malfoy”, he looked up and realized it was the man with the holey jeans and the eyeliner. ” Do we know each other?” Draco wondered aloud. The man answered, ”I must say I’m a little disappointed you don’t remember me after all the years we were at each other’s throats.”. And then it clicked. “Potter? That you?” he wouldn’t have recognized him for the life of him. It was at least 10 years since graduation and Potter looked like double of it. Not that he looked old per se, but he looked so much more mature. He had filled out in all the right places, his jeans were skin tight and through the holes you could see is deeply tanned skin and the corner of some tattoo or other. He was wearing high black combat boots a loosefitting see through and some old bantered leather jacket. The only thing that stayed the same were his light green sparkly eyes. The man smiled and said “Come on Draco I don’t look that different. You grew up to you know?”, whatever he meant with that. Of course he had grown but not in size, in fact Harry had him by a few inches, he also didn’t get any bulkier, he was the same lean and slender boy he had always been, his hair were longer and he wore them in a tight bun most of the time, he already had some crinkles around his eyes but apart from that he was just the same. “Maybe, but at least I look remotely the same, not the I’m complaining about your change of style. So anyways, what are you doing in a pub in Soho?”, “I was just meeting up with some colleagues from work here. They were asking for ages but it seems it was just the right day to run out of excuses. Anyway what are you doing here?”, as he didn’t want to go in the depths of his personal life he answered, “I am living across the street and didn’t feel like cooking tonight. I didn’t know any of your colleagues, did I ? My father would be furious if I forget to make the requested small talk with people from the ministry.”, “The Ministry ? You don’t read the Daily Prophet, do you?”, “Nah, I stopped after the war. Too much drama, too much the chosen one this the chosen one that. Are you into Quidditch now, then ?”, “No, pretty sad that you would think it could only be either of those. I am working in a muggle university as a professor. So No you don’t know any of my colleagues. To be honest I don’t have much contact with the Wizarding World at all anymore. Like you said too much Golden Boy stuff. I decided to take a different course at life. Ron and Hermione are busy building their family, the Weasleys tried to stay in contact at first, but after I moved to a Muggle neighborhood, it started slowing down. But I guess it’s for the better. After you lived through certain things you can’t look the other in the eye and not be reminded constantly. And why did you move out here ?”, “Well, I didn’t want my parents constantly interfering with my life. And because my wife is a Squib, she didn’t wanted to live in the Wizarding World an be constantly reminded, you know?”, he could see the thoughts processing in Potter’s mind ‘A Malfoy marrying a squib, how did that came about ?’ But out of class or respect, Draco didn’t know, he didn’t comment on it. “You’re married? Seems like I don’t read the Prophet either. So how come she isn’t eating with you?”, “ Well it wasn’t in the Prophet so you didn’t miss anything and were living apart at the moment.”, “Ohh I am sorry to hear that. Well I hope there will be better times.”, “Thank you but they aren’t coming in the foreseeable future. I haven’t told my parents, and even if I do they will say we can’t get divorced because of the appearance it would make. So I am trapped.”, Harry seemed like he wanted to say something, but thought better of it. He just turned around and went out the door.
The skin of Draco’s stomach was pulled taught when Harry pushed upwards. Draco’s hands unseeingly flew to the emerging bulge. His moaning and panting and begging hadn’t ebbed down after his orgasm. He still pushed back against Harry’s arm when he felt it moving.
Draco’s eyes already seemed as though they were glassed over and he was far gone inside his own head. The breaths escaping his open mouth in quick succession were adjusted to the pumping of Harry’s beak shaped hand inside his already far stretched hole.
Harry grinned widely, „At least you got no problems with your self esteem, but don’t worry I got a pretty similar box under my bed. Although you got the one thing or other I would like to try.”,
“Be my guest Draco answered”, throwing a great arm gesture in the general direction of the night stand. Harry really seemed to consider his offer and, after putting Draco softly on the bed, went to check out his collection. He lifted somethings up, inspected them and put them back down again.
He dozed off for another hour and when he woke up again, he got up searching for his clothes. He found his shirt on the couch along with his jeans and boots. He started the coffee machine, while returning to the bedroom, searching for his socks. He looked through the sheets, and along the floor but didn’t seem to find them. He went to the bathroom to use the loo and found them laying in front of the bathtub. He cleaned his teeth using his finger and looked through Draco’s excessive assortment of creams and beauty products. He also found several skin care products and decided to try them on his eyeliner. It was a magical brand, that didn’t smudge overnight or on long nights out. None of them worked so he decided cleaning it off with magic, even though he always got dry eyes when doing that. Since he was also in desperate need of a shower after cuddling a sweat-soaked Draco all night he pushed several buttons on the rain-shower and after a few minutes, he seemed to get the hang of it. The problem with it was, that it was one of those spiral stonewall kind of showers, with the buttons on the outside. So he always had to go back and forth, until he found the right setting.
By the time Draco blinked his eyes open, Harry had prepared a tray with pancakes, fruit and juice and placed it in the middle of the bed.
They were laying sideways facing each other, kissing and groping, touching and moaning. Pressing his cock against Draco’s Harry started pushing Draco’s panties further down, so that he had good access to his soft buttocks. He started massaging and squeezing it in random patterns. Draco seemed to enjoy that very much, so he searched out his hole and after circling it for a while he put his middle finger in the center and started pushing rhythmically with the thrusts of his cock. He alternated between kissing Draco and nibbling along his jawline. Draco nearly felt overwhelmed with being touched in all the right places, he alternated between pushing back against the finger massaging, only slightly breaching his hole, and pushing forth to get more friction on his cock. They rocked like that for a while, until neither of them could stand it any longer. Harry tucked his cock underneath Draco’s balls and between his legs and came. As Draco felt Harry’s huge cock pulsating on his balls and his perineum he began shuddering and came all over his cardigan and both their stomachs, moaning Harry’s name. They lay there spend for some minutes or hours, time seemed to float by. After they came back to themselves Draco suggested a bath.
“Well I should get going then, got a lot on my schedule today.”, Draco said and starting to get climb out of the bed.
He got out of bed opening the window and letting the fresh air stream inside. The warm summer air filled his lungs and he breathed in deeply.
Harry motioned for Draco to choose a seat, and they sat down. The waitress handed them their menu’s and returned to her table at the entrance.
After pausing for a second he continued his way to the bathroom. On his way outside he saw that the blonde had proceeded to go on his knees before Malfoy, sucking his cock enthusiastically.
Receiving his own cum, hot, from the residence in Draco’s body, back, was one of the hottest  things Harry ever experienced. He moaned, leaving his mouth wide open, to not miss a single drop, he felt his cock starting to leak precum on his stomach.
As soon as four fingers glid in and out comfortably, he pulled them out and tucked his balls to the side. Feeling Draco’s fascinated look on the area of action was a immense turn-on.
On Tuesday morning the sun, shining through the windows woke them up, they still laid entangled like they had fallen asleep. They were sticky with sweat from the warm blanket covering them.
He looked up at Draco, who had his mouth wide open in a silent scream. He locked eyes with Harry, and Harry took the knob of his prostate between his two fingers and squeezed. Draco couldn’t hold in the scream that followed that, and hot cum was shooting down Harry’s throat.
Experimentally Harry moved the hand in Draco’s ass, taking a run-up to the entering part. He counted down, accompanied by pushes against Draco’s sphincter.
“HAAARRY, that’s not funny, you idiot.”, he shouted and came for Harry, tickling him and pushing him against the glass wall separating the shower from the rest of the room.
“No! What sane person would try that?! But on the other hand, I didn’t know I could fit a whole arm up there. With you I feel undereducated for the first time, but in the best possible way.”
Harry laughed, but accompanied Draco to the door. Unsure what would be the appropriate way to say goodbye to a former school nemesis, now guy he had slept with, he decided for a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek. Draco seemed to find that appropriate, since he reciprocated it.
“Hello, well I checked my calendar, and I might be available tomorrow night.”, Draco answered in his posh voice.
He started his shower, hopping under it to clean of the stress of the day. As he entered the shower he saw his black dildo hanging from the wall, and while massaging his expensive eucalyptus shampoo into his hair, he wondered whether it was higher on the wall than it usually was. He stood in front of it and decided that it definitely was higher. So, Harry must have used it or at least touched it. He hadn’t realized that someone had used the shower at all, but now that he thought about it, the toy disinfectant had stood outside on the shelf over the sink. Feeling the excitement rising in his belly he knelt down and took the fake-cock into his mouth, and although it tasted mostly like the berry disinfectant, he imagined he could taste Harry on it too. He put his cock in his fist, his other hand reaching back to play with the plug, still inside of him. I didn’t take long for him to cum with the dildo all the way down his throat, tears rolling down his cheek, his hole spasming around the plug and his cock shooting cum all over the wall. He leaned forward, his head pressed against the wall and he breathed deeply, collecting himself from the post-orgasmic bliss.
After stretching the insides for a while, he opted to go deeper instead. A new portion of lube now coating his wrist made his descend into Draco’s body  go smoother.
From the inside, Harry could feel the pressure disappearing from the bladder area. That gave him more room to move and with one motion he entered Draco until his elbow.
Draco didn’t answer but entered, nonetheless. He looked around, taking in the huge window front, the modern kitchen and the hallway leading to the other rooms. He decided to go in the direction of the sofa, facing the window front, overlooking London.
Draco’s cock had already started leaking precum in a steady stream. It only took a few strokes from Harry’s hand and Draco was coming, throwing his head back and moaning Harry’s name.
After finishing his cocktail, he made his way to the dancefloor, moving to the beat, rubbing against the one or other man and forgetting about everything for a while.
Hours went by unnoticed, as he made his way through stacks of essays and tests, the sun wandering across the horizon. It started getting colder and he realized it was already half past 5. He collected his stuff and put it on the dining room table.
Until it started getting cold. He vanished the mess, pulled his pants back on and turned to his side to sleep.
“Yes, thank you, even though I don’t exactly remember falling asleep. I came and the rest is sort of hazy.”
“I slept pretty long, and when I left I went directly to the uni. Since it is Saturday,I only had two classes that afternoon, so a pretty easy day. After that I spend some time marking essays for next week’s class. I was done real quick, since it is only a small course. I went home, to eat something, and then I thought of you. I wanted to see you again.”, “Well, you could have called, you know.”,”Yeah, but I ain’t such a big fan of phones, so impersonal, you know?”, “If you say so.”,”And I figured, on Sunday you must be free, right? So, I thought maybe you would like to spend the day with me?”, “You figured right”, Draco answered grinning. He took the last piece of his pizza, and chewed thoughtfully. “So what did you think we might do?”,”Well, I don’t know yet, but maybe we could sleep in, take a long bath, have breakfast and see what the day will bring.”,”Sounds good to me”, Draco answered, taking his plate to the kitchen. “Join me to bed ?”, Draco asked ”I would love to”, Harry answered, getting up from the couch and walking to Draco, but Draco started running along the corridor, Harry chased after him, caught him and picked him up from around his hips and threw him over his shoulder, and Draco protested, trying to wiggle himself free but to no avail. Harry carried him threw the door and threw him on the bed. They were giggling loudly, Harry jumped on Draco tickling him all over, Draco squirmed on the bed but stayed put under Harry.
When they caught their breaths, Harry stopped the still vibrating plug, with a wandless Finite Incantatem.
He started frotting against him, slowly and trying first but when Harry moved his other hand from his waist under the cardigan all the way to his back, he stopped second-guessing what he was doing and just went with it. Harry’s fingers were cold at first but after he pushed his hand inside his jeans and panties, they gradually warmed up. He grabbed his left arse cheek and massaged it with his hand as good as he could while Draco pushed his cock against Harry’s through their trousers.
He had eaten Harry’s dreadful eggs. In fact, he’d wolfed them down without realising it. Maybe Harry hadn’t either because it was such a rare occurrence. Draco uncomfortably placed the pastries back into their bag. It was odd to do so, as he usually just crumpled up the empty paper and vanished it entirely. His musings were interrupted abruptly by an insistent knock on the door. He knew that sound anywhere.
“You probably get this from a lot of patients,” Draco started as they continued past a handful of Mediwitch break rooms. “And I may sound entirely crazy.”
Draco sniffed, holding his head a little higher than before. Defending against anger was easier than sadness. “I don’t think this is working. I’m not the type to give up on things, Harry, but sometimes there are things worth giving up on. Our marriage, our life — this is not what I want anymore.”
Harry made it clear early on that he wanted Draco’s recovery to be on him. He was going to support and cheer for him like a good boyfriend and soulmate from the sidelines, but the hard work needed to be undertaken by Draco himself. Which was, of course, challenging for Draco to understand at first.
Harry turns himself from where he’s seated at the table, paperwork sprawled in front of him. He always brings too much work home with him.
“You have such a flair for the dramatics, Potter. You know not everything is about you.” He snarled, his eyes flashing with anger and maybe something else too. Harry just couldn’t identify what it was.
“It’s not just that, though.” Draco stilled his head as Harry wiped away loose tears with his fingers. They hadn’t touched like this in months, but the interaction still felt emotionless. “Something is going wrong with us. Tell me I’m not the only one who sees it. I’m not crazy, Harry.”
It wasn’t necessarily a terrible way to spend his morning, but it was certainly not the most ideal. Nighttime snow had snaked around some of their protective wards and painted itself upon the carefully concealed flowers and herbs that they grew.
“No, Mr Potter, that’s not what I mean,” Ethel’s face becomes serious. “Let me be clear: once you know who the person is, over the course of a few days you’ll begin to feel their core, their magic in your body. It’ll be subtle, but you will be aware of another presence there. After knowing a specific name, your core will fight back if you try to push it away.”
Most of the front garden had withered away after Harry had ripped out the blooming milk thistles from their root. But Harry worked at the one in the back tirelessly, still, for the sake of appearances. People usually never came through the front door anymore. No one really came at all, but when they did, Harry encouraged the use of the Floo. Somehow, it felt more controlled than any stranger entering through their front door.
Harry didn’t necessarily want to belabour Draco with more questions and potentially stave off the effects of the potion. Frankly, he couldn’t help himself. “Draco?”
“Harry, please,” he whimpered, gasping thinly into the sheets below him. His hands curled into the comforter for support as fingers moved in and out with rhythm.
“Well, allow me to preface by saying, you don’t necessarily need to be romantically involved with your pair if you choose not to be. Becoming close friends, confidants, or lovers all constitute safe and healthy ways to go about this process,” she says.
“I know. We should.” Draco sighed, setting the newspaper back down and took a bite. Lyra extracted herself from his shoulder to inspect it.
“Yeah, we had a particularly tough case today.” Harry knew he couldn’t divulge information about the case at all, but Draco wouldn’t ask anyway. He never did out of respect for confidentiality.
“You look well,” Harry said, surveying him. There wasn’t any malice or possessiveness behind the tone like there used to be. But five years was a long time; even Draco knew that.
Another true statement. Hmm, he thought. Perhaps whatever ailment he was suffering from prevented him from telling lies. A hex Umbridge-ian in its origin, maybe. Though what he’d wanted to say to Ginny technically had been the truth, right? Or had it not been?
“I gave you the potion on purpose. An experiment, if you will. I didn’t know if you’d use it or not, but I knew I’d be able to tell from the photos in the papers. Do you know why Auror Potter?”
He stepped away to press his back against the opposite wall, just as his reflection stepped closer. So close that it could have come right out of the mirror if it tried. Draco’s mind was swimming, and he was dizzy with an urgent panic.
A silence falls over the table for a while as Harry considers the words spoken between them. He’d surmised already that Draco probably was avoiding finding out who his soulmate is, but he hadn’t really expected this. A deeply rooted self-hatred that makes Harry’s eyes sting. Anyone would be lucky to have Draco in their life, he realises, because for his terrible past and numerous flaws he’s more than them, he’s offered Harry a chance at real happiness without even coming to recognise it. How could Draco not see that about himself? How, in Merlin’s name, could he perceive himself to be so valueless? The questions are enough to make his head spin.
A team of nurses entered through the same door moments later to disrupt the calm, bustling around Draco and checking vital signs and reflexes.
Harry trudged out of Slytherin disappointedly, and he could practically feel Parkinson sticking her tongue out at him behind his back. He had wanted to stay and argue until Draco allowed him in, but Zabini was insistent that he stop “invading Slytherin space” and just give Draco some time to process. If he needed space right now, he should have it. Though Harry was stubborn and already had plans to confront Draco at some point. He just needed to catch him at the right time.
They’re small tears that prick gently at the corner where his eyes meet his nose and threaten to run down his face. Harry hates that he notices how expressive, how beautiful Draco looks with bright, watery eyes.
Neither Harry nor Ron replied, but they regarded the man with distaste. He seemed happy almost, too excited to have relinquished his freedom for capture.
It’s only a few moments later that he’s leaving the room to give Draco and Narcissa privacy to speak. He worries for a fraction of a moment, that Narcissa will convince Draco to leave, to go back to his old life. Despite all of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, it’s sometimes still hard for Harry to remember that people have changed since the war, including the people he least expected to.
He stood instead, feeling his legs shaking as he went. He didn’t think he could bear another bout of pain.
Locked tsked three times, and the noise made Harry’s heart feel sick. “You didn’t think that would change, did you? You naively thought it could last forever, even though we all know dark magic never plays by the rules we want it to. Something different is happening now, isn’t it, Auror Potter?”
When he looked back at the mirror, everything was back to normal. He was met with his own haggard frame, crouching in a cloud of fear and shame by the closed door.
He grabbed a winter cloak from his dormitory and made his way outside into the cold air. The night was as pleasant it could be for that time of year, but Harry was glad he had layered up. He found Draco by the Willow, giving it a suspicious eye and a wide berth.
When Harry opens the door, he notices the design of the bedroom first. Everything is a lovely walnut wood from the floorboards to the dressers to the looming bookcased walls. A large ornamental rug is spread across the hardwood, and there are floor pillows littering the ground, surrounded by trays of tea, biscuits, and a soft white powder that Harry can’t identify. But what draws his eye is the bed that is far too large to sleep one person. Gauzy olive-green curtains surround the frame, obscuring shadowed figures. There’s a light, and breathy laughter, coming from inside.
Ron’s voice cut into his thoughts on cue. “I’m so relieved we closed that case, right, Harry? It was one of our bigger ones.”
Draco is standing on the edge of the roof, barefoot, his toes hanging just off the edge. He turns his head ever so slightly as he hears Harry step out of the doorway but doesn’t back away from the ledge.
“If you can look me in the eye and promise me it won’t drive you crazy until you do, then we’ll leave,” Hermione says.
“Listen,” Harry says sternly then. “I need to tell you something, but do you pinky promise you’re sober?”
“You’re welcome to take your helpfulness somewhere else,” Draco says, sitting back against the wall and smacking the toilet lid closed. It makes a loud noise that sends gooseflesh down the length of Harry’s arm.
Harry, mortified, looks up to meet the pale and angry face of Draco himself. Draco’s lips crease into a thin line, and he glowers down at Harry. Now that they’re standing in front of each other, Harry realises how much shorter he is in comparison.
It had taken a long while. Harry knew it was because they hadn’t known each other well enough yet to understand that this was what was needed to make their relationship work. Clear boundaries and open communication. But, they’re happier now.
“Where the hell were you last night?” Ron asks. “‘Mione and I popped around your place to see if you wanted to grab a drink.”
“Has he?” Harry replies breathlessly, taking a sip of his drink. It tastes foul, though he’s never loved alcohol anyway.
The song that plays through the wireless is something slow and complex. It’s a Muggle station for classical music that Draco leaves on while he’s reading or undertaking his new habit of clearing out Harry’s bookshelves.
“I think I know that at this point,” he huffed, reaching for a cleaning draught by his bedside that tasted of fresh mint and citrus.
“It doesn’t, thanks,” Harry says, hating the bitterness that creeps into his tone. “I’m just surprised I didn’t know about them.”
Harry’s mouth hung open with confusion. Was the potion working this well? Harry didn’t want to admit it, but a part of him had forgotten about the morning. He hadn’t necessarily expected it to change things so drastically. Dinner, to the unknowing eye, may not have seemed like an earth-shattering revelation. But to Harry, it marked a new beginning.
“Draco, really, I have no clue what you’re on about. I think we should just go home,” Harry said nervously, fidgeting in his seat.
. Draco shook his head. A cursed word. He’d rather be curled up in bed with a good book and a steaming cup of tea on a frigid day like this one.
“Harry,” Draco said, feeling the beginnings of pain in his mind, a reminder of what controlled him. “I don’t want this.”
Draco moved to sit up slowly, so as to not draw much attention to himself. But magical technology had a mind of its own and began beeping loudly — sounding some sort of alarm. The curtains were pulled back not a second later.
“Draco, I —” Harry’s eyes widened with tears, and he removed his glasses to rub at them fiercely. “I know this is no excuse, but I’m so sorry. You know I’m not like this. I don’t know what happened. I couldn’t control myself.”
They kiss to seal their bond, and it’s like their cores strain through their chests, aching to be pressed together forever, as close as they can be. Harry finds it hard for himself to pull away but doesn’t particularly feel like putting on a show for their audience.
When Draco’s in the bathroom getting ready to leave, Harry slips Azalea’s business card into Draco’s coat pocket. Just in case he needs it on a particularly hard night.
Robards stood to attention. “Aurors Finnegan and Patil, I have tasked you with infiltration. You will work undercover to access the buyers and lead us to target dealers.  Auror Delaney, we’ve assigned you to work closely with Minister Shacklebolt and Ms Granger to control both public image and manage press reports on victims. Aurors Potter and Weasley, you will assist with research and location of the suppliers.” He paused. “That is unless any of you decline to participate.”
Now Luna, though. That was a good option. She was equally close with both him and Harry, and if he asked her to keep his secret, there was no doubt she’d comply. She was much smarter than people gave her credit for and never involved herself in the petty dramas of real life.
“If you want me to take a leave of absence, I will,” Harry said, his voice sharp as he put the other plate down so he wouldn’t feel the urge to throw it again. “I’ll stay home with you.”
“I’m so scared,” Malfoy whimpers, but his eyes glaze over, and in an instant, it’s over. The bathroom is quiet once more.
“Auror Potter, sir, Ms Marchand’s family is this way.” A kind-eyed Auror led him to the opposite side of the tent. It was quieter, and the air a little colder. There was less panic, but far more fear. “They’re just through here.” He pulled back the curtain and disappeared as Harry stepped through.
“You’re in love with me,” Harry repeats the words, as though he can’t seem to comprehend them properly.
He pulls out a pair of flannel pyjama bottoms and an old t-shirt of Ginny’s that would probably fit Draco more loosely than on Harry himself. Harry turns away as Draco dresses and notices it takes far longer than he expects.
As Harry is bringing up his fist to knock again, the door swings open, and he takes an instinctive step back.
He sat at the table, sliding a plate of eggs across the way to Draco, who looked at them and back at Harry.
“Harry?” he called into the emptiness, feeling immense and unfamiliar relief when footsteps echoed in the hallway beyond the sitting room.
After much too long, the door opens itself, and Harry walks inside. There’s no one waiting in the foyer for him, but Harry’s content to give it a moment. He begins to take off his overcoat, and a nearby coat rack outstretches two arms to ease it from his shoulders.
And Draco did. He reached up from his grasp in Harry’s arms and pressed bruising kisses to the corner of his jaw gently. Harry melted pliantly into the touch.
Snape deigns to express any sense of empathy, but Harry is surprised when he takes a seat beside him by the window. Snape decidedly leaves his legs inside of the tower.
“Need anything else?” The waitress swung around again, and Draco eyed her intently, hoping she’d catch his gaze and understand the silent plea for help.
The Mediwitch from earlier spoke out in the thrums of chaos, settling Draco’s mind with only the understanding in her voice. “I’m going to give you something to calm you down now, dear. Please hold still for a moment.”
He had been seeing the same Mind Healer for a number of years. Their sessions weren’t getting any easier, but Draco was always getting better. He knew that much.
“Oh, Merlin.” Harry let out a pleased hum, rutting gently against him, thickening cock pressing into the space between Draco’s legs.
“You’re something else,” Harry said, and his voice was layered with disgust where it should have been amused, or maybe fond.
Ron lets out a loud, infectious laugh, and Harry can’t seem to match it as he usually would. It disappears quickly, though, as the delight on Ron’s face turns into confusion.
“No, you listen,” Draco interrupts, exasperated. “You thought it was right to tell the two of them before me?”
Draco was probably sound asleep in their bed, his small body curled into the sheets like a cat napping off morning drowsiness. His husband was irritatingly predictable these days.
He climbs down the spiralling staircase, wondering how on earth Draco had managed to drag him up its steep incline last night. The man is clearly much stronger than he looks. When he reaches the landing, there’s a window cracked open slightly, then the unmistakable sound of a pecking beak against the glass, as a snowy owl, pristine and white despite the weather, gracefully enters.
“You might as well quit at this point. You’re never well enough anyway.” Harry laughed cruelly, and Draco suppressed a flinch, only at the mercy of his pride.
Harry’s fingers were down Draco’s throat in an instant, seeking out the release of soft fleshy tonsils. Harry felt for a place as far back as he could before pressing down. Draco tensed from underneath him as Harry turned him on his side. He dribbled saliva down the corner of his mouth, but nothing came up that would’ve given Harry any relief.
“It is, essentially, a bottled Imperius Curse.” Shacklebolt moved forward with quiet authority. “One can understand why, if possessed by the wrong hands, this substance could wreak havoc on our community.”
“What do you need him for?” she asks when Harry refuses a reply to her statement. “Official Ministry business would make more sense than your unannounced arrival at my door.”
“And, despite some things that have been said in the past,” Hermione nudged Ron gently at that, “we trust your judgment.”
Harry isn’t really listening as she begins to talk about her own resolution. It’s something about ridding Wrackspurts from their family home and perfecting a potion that she and Neville use in their vegetable garden.
“It wasn’t my turn to patrol tonight. But some nights I sing lullabies to the thestrals. It helps them sleep, and you know thestrals alter the future during the morning hours, so proper rest is essential,” she said as if it were the most reasonable explanation in the world. In a way, to Harry, it was.
“I’m not trying to be a dick,” he says, justifying himself. “Harry, he’s throwing his life away right in front of you. Do you really think he won’t go back to the drugs immediately? Charlie’s ex-boyfriend was an addict, and it tore him apart, even without a shared core. I won’t let you get hurt like this.”
“I love you,” Harry says breathlessly. “I love you, I love you, I love you,” he chants it like a prayer, like he’ll never be able to say it again.
Draco walks down the aisle first, held tightly on either side by Pansy and Theo who both look like they could burst into tears. At the end of the aisle, they both give him hugs that last seconds too long, before assuming their positions up at the front.
“Yeah, I got it,” Harry says quietly, without amusement. “Draco, I don’t know if all of this is good for you.”
He stood outside the doorway, strengthening the glamour on his face and applying a muddy brown colour to his hair once more before following behind. The bar was archaic in its decoration. High tables and scattered chairs cluttered one side of the room, while the other had been reserved for a sweeping bartop. Everything was a dark walnut wood. Low hanging lanterns spilled soft yellow light into small crevices of the room. Other parts were left entirely in the dark.
She shuffles over with her arms preemptively outstretched, crowding him into a hug that lasts for seconds too long. Harry loves it anyway, feeling safe and loved in her embrace. She pulls back when she notices Draco hovering just behind in the doorway. Her expression cools off a bit, but not by much, as Harry knows she’s always excited to have family in the Burrow.
familiar,” Draco said, eyes widening at the empty cup. “I’ve tasted this before. And the smell —” He cut himself off, his vision blurring.
“Harry, you slept with him and then just walked away without another word. Don’t you think that would feel like an implicit rejection?” She had asked him, and Harry had unfortunately seen her point.
Harry wanted to possess Draco like a collectible object, to keep him out of reach of anyone else’s dirty grasp and away from harm at all.
Harry reaches a door that is partly open and catches a flash of something blonde. It could have been Lucius, and he would have signed his death certificate by confronting the man, but he's too curious to let it go. Instead, he pushes open the dark wooden door and immediately realizes what room of the house he has entered.
“Hi,” Draco said again, stupidly. He glanced at the doorway in the back where the baker had disappeared. He prayed the man would come back soon; fresh cannoli be damned.
“If you say so.” Ginny shrugs and leaps to the side as Harry throws his coat at her. They dissolve into a fit of laughter, and Harry’s stomach cramps by the time he comes up for a breath of air.
Kipsy Apparates in a moment later, with a tray of finger sandwiches and tea. She serves Harry coronation chicken onto a plate, though surprisingly, leaves Narcissa to her own devices. Seconds later, Kipsy is gone, and the room is silent save for the sounds in the fireplace.
“Draco,” she said, her shoulders tense and rigid as though something was holding her back straight up.
“Yesterday you wanted to divorce me,” Harry said, as though he had no idea what caused Draco’s change of heart.
Draco’s eyes seem to well with tears for the third time that evening. “I thought I didn’t have one.”
Draco couldn’t, though. His mind was wild with panic and rage at being held against his will for something he had never done. His therapist had prescribed antidepressants a number of years ago, but that was all legal. Draco struggled against the group of wizards holding him down, feeling repulsed by the unwanted touch.
“Cats do love her, I don’t know why you expect any different,” Harry replies as they step off the elevator onto the department floor.
Harry choked as a sip of wine went down the wrong pipe. Once he was done coughing, and gulping down water, he looked up to meet Draco’s gaze.
“Alright…Harry,” She tests, “I had spoken to Severus, and he informed me of what occurred weeks ago. While I cannot and will not speak on behalf of my husband, I can truthfully say that I do not blame you.”
“I’ve spoken with Auror Potter already. There are people here who can help you, but unfortunately, in light of recent events, you’ll need to stay to be monitored. Especially as you come down from years of potions abuse. Withdrawal can be extremely arduous on the body. We can suggest numerous rehabilitation centers that would be happy to take over your care after this initial stage.”
settling into a relaxing summer, and then this happens!” Ron groaned, shuffling papers around his desk before looking at Harry, who was sat on the other side.
The sitting room is abuzz with activity. George is playing with Victoire on the carpet as Fleur watches him with the hawk-eyed stare that only a mother could have. Oliver and Percy are very clearly undergoing some sort of lovers quarrel in the corner, at which Ron and Charlie continuously snicker. Arthur is probably somewhere upstairs.
They paused in front of a restaurant with a forest green exterior and large flower basket hanging in the doorway. Gold lettering adorned a wooden sign that swung delicately in the gentle wind. The hinges squeaked as if they were going to give way. It wasn’t exceedingly crowded inside, and Harry figured this was a good thing because they had both forgotten to replace their robes. Draco went in first, and Harry followed behind.
“You like me,” Draco repeats, looking away from Harry, presumably so Harry cannot see the expression on his face. “Then, why don’t you want me?”
“You have such a big heart, Harry, but you can’t help everyone,” Hermione says. The pity in her tone doesn’t make him feel any more relieved.
“What is it?” Harry finally asked when they had both settled on the blanket. Draco had worked to keep his limbs away from the flowers, but Harry had spread out easily crushing a few in the process.
“I, for one, feel old,” Pansy announces, leaning back onto the bedpost with a dramatic sigh. “All the body aches.”
Still, even knowing that his husband was busy with his hands, Draco locked the door when he changed. He wasn’t sure when he’d become so uncomfortable with his body, but he was plagued by the existence of it at every passing minute.
“Good.” Ginny leaned in and pressed herself into his side for a hug. “I better get going then. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t lying here dead with an AK to the chest or something.”
And for a moment, only the crackling fire makes noises in the room, accompanied by the forced sounds of Harry’s desperate breath. His head feels tight, still leaden with stress and exhilaration. He always recalls the chase as enthralling, but this one had been too close.
Draco stepped through almost immediately at the invitation, hoping Harry wouldn’t stir within the hour. At his intrusion, he knocked over a stack of
“I guess I’m just not grasping how serious this all is,” Harry says quietly, in a moment of honesty. “It’s ridiculous to think that time away from him will literally kill me. That seems dramatic.”
“I don’t know.” Draco sighed, pulling himself reluctantly to his feet and holding both peppers in one large hand. Harry couldn’t help but admire the way his fingers stretched over the swollen red. “I felt like it. It’s nice to do something that you just want to do without thinking of the consequences.”
Malfoy removed a small notebook and quill from the inside of his shirt pocket. The plates in front of them had vanished without so much as a word from the house-elves. Harry wanted to thank them, but when he glanced around the kitchen, it was empty. He instantly felt more uncomfortable in the room alone with Malfoy but had already committed to giving niceties a try.
“When has that ever stopped her before?” Ron snorted, sitting at the table and promptly piling his plate with sweet pastries. “This is the same girl that used a time turner to attend
Draco hummed in response. Harry couldn’t believe the potion would work this well, and so quickly at that. While the shopkeeper had mentioned strong wills could push past the bounds of its control, it was clear that Draco believed what he was saying to some degree. Maybe before, he wasn’t ready to swallow his pride and give their relationship one last try. Hope bloomed in Harry’s chest, and he felt like he could breathe a little easier for that.
“Oh, shove off.” Harry groaned, but he laughed along with her. “What bothered me was she asked me even though she already knew. How pointless!”
It was only when he had collapsed onto the couch with a book that a cold shock of emotion hit him in the face. He felt weak and unworthy of someone as wonderful as his husband. Harry was abusing him and his trust, that's what this was. Plain and obvious as day. Draco was scared, but this wasn't alighting the same curiosity and excitement in Harry when they were in the same room. It only served to deepen a cavity of sadness and loss that Harry felt already rip apart in his chest.
Ron stood quickly and missed a satisfied glare from Proudfoot, who jumped into her seat possessively.
“Look at you, though,” Draco says, in awe, taking a step back to twirl Harry in a circle. “We’re getting married.”
Harry was fumbling with his belt buckle, eyes driven wild with lust. “You need me,” he rasped, words slurring and incoherent against his tongue.
Before Harry can vehemently object to such a situation, although his body is telling him he needs to see Draco soon, Ginny perks up from the other side of the room.
“Nonsense!” A boy named Noah called happily, from across the table. “We’ve made new friends, let’s toast to that.”
“When did things go so wrong with us?” Harry questioned, mostly to the chill of night in front of him. Draco shifted, and the wooden steps released a bothered creak. Harry enveloped Draco in the blanket, noticing the slight shake of his shoulders in the cold.
Draco doesn’t smile, and he shifts uncomfortably underneath the covers. He opens his mouth as though he’s going to say something but neglects to do so.
“Hard day?” Draco spoke again, his cheek pressed firmly into the curve of Harry’s collarbone. So uncharacteristic.
Seamus and Parvati had tracked a few operations running out of Knockturn, to which Harry had suppressed a heart attack, though eventually, nothing fruitful came of their undercover work.
He set the bag on the chair and pulled it open. Something crinkled inside. His slender hand withdrew a small bunch of Honeysuckle flowers that were tied together with a pale yellow ribbon. Draco sucked in a breath through his teeth, before straightening his back and reaching out to pass Harry the flowers.
and soft light filtered into their little area. It felt cozier than Harry was willing to admit. They sat down on the small blanket, their knees touching just slightly. Harry hoped Draco couldn’t sense his racing pulse.
Harry widens his eyes, his gaze falling back to the syringe on his coffee table. He really should throw it away.
Harry tries to feign surprise, though he’d already expected such an answer. For what reason though, he wasn’t sure.
Maybe he’d listen to the voice in his head for a while, even if it meant spending more time with Harry than strictly necessary. It would pass in time. It had to.
“Turn over,” Harry grunted, and Draco complied. “Oh Merlin, you look so good like this, you feel so good.” He groaned, and Draco spread his legs further in response.
“Hermione, this is a joke, there must have been an error in the system. Help me out here,” Harry pleads, frowning at the two of them.
“For Merlin’s sake, I didn’t pick them out,” Theo sighs, aiming a look of pure disgust at his bed. “Pansy felt as though she needed to decorate the place in a style that would feel the most familiar to us. She doesn’t even live here, and somehow tasked herself with a highly unnecessary job. Now the whole place is a horrible mix of Sacred Twenty-Eight and cottage chic.”
“An individual who still has a bone to pick with some of us Death Eaters. You know I don’t blame him for having the balls to at least do what everyone else dreams of doing to me.” Draco flashes a resigned smile that Harry finds makes the croissant he ate for breakfast flip over in his stomach. “At least he follows through.”
He steels himself before the door for a moment, replaying the hypothetical conversation he had with the mirror that morning. When Draco opens the door, he’s just going to be upfront. He’s going to tell him what’s going on and everything will be fine and will eventually go back to normal. Harry reaches up, pulling woolen mittens off to raise the snake-coiled knocker against the door. It makes a loud ringing noise as it collides with the wood and is much louder than Harry would’ve expected. Waiting for a while longer, he resists the urge to do it again and is sure someone inside must have heard by now.
It was coming; Harry could feel it. Something sinister crept along his spine in response to the thought.
Even if the potion’s strange magic was raging inside of him and begging him to start a fight, Harry wouldn’t concede just yet. It was important for Draco to maintain a small pretence of reality still. After all, he still didn’t know what was happening, even if he had marginally begun to catch on.
Harry snapped his fingers in front of Malfoy’s face, attempting to garner his attention. “Malfoy! Hey! I’m talking to you.”
Harry swallows, feeling a lump grow in his dry throat. He’s not sure right now, or ever, is the best time to inform Draco of their unfortunate predicament. But they’re close now, physically, and Harry feels like a small pressing weight has been lifted from his chest.
. Draco was, of course, hurtling through the novel, but Harry’s eyes stuck to each word like they were made of glue. They hadn’t been working on the Muggle studies curriculum much in recent weeks but found themselves spending more time with one another than strictly necessary. Sometimes it felt like more of an excuse to be around each other.
Harry didn’t have to ask to know what Robards meant. They were catching on to the fact that this wasn’t some black market item. It was easy to acquire and easier to administer within the home.
Harry’s not sure how long they dance together like that before he’s being tugged away from the crowd. He’s outside before he realises it, chilling winter air feeling like sweet release from the sweaty atmosphere inside.
The interview continued like that for a while. Both of Pauline’s family members insisted she would never have done something like this. And while Harry wanted to believe them, he also knew that there was always more to a situation than what meets the eye.
“I am indeed,” he replies instead, letting himself sink further into the soft comfort of Draco’s squishy mattress. “Your bed is like a cloud.”
It’s like he’s relieved when Harry’s seated fully inside of him, throwing his head back against the headboard with a satisfied sigh.
something like that with me.” Harry exhaled, hot air blowing out from between his lips with every word. He would have been surprised if his face wasn’t an angry and unpleasant red. It certainly felt like it was.
Harry helps him up the stairs slowly and finds himself horrified at how easy it is to guide Draco wherever he wants. He’s even more worried to find that when he puts his arm around Draco’s waist, there’s practically nothing to grab ahold of. He feels as though the boy might just snap under the lightest touch.
“The menace scratched my legs up pretty fucking badly,” Ron groans. “But of course, he was an angel to Hermione the entire time.”
“You think I care?” Harry replied, and probably meant it, pressing the length of his body against Draco’s lithe frame. His breath reeked of liquor and the sweet perfume of the beautiful woman from the bar.
Draco’s cock leaks pre-come onto his stomach, pooling next to his navel, and Harry fucks him harder. He doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to pull out, the feeling of Draco wrapped so insistently, fitted so perfectly around his cock a sensation that doesn’t compare to anything else. If this is sex, then Harry has been a virgin his whole life.
“Welcome everyone to our first Narcotics Anonymous meeting of April.” Azalea smiles gently as she speaks. She has a quiet command over the large group, who seem to respect her and hang on to her every word. “It’s lovely to see some new faces with us today, and of course, welcome back to our regulars. My name is Azalea if you don’t know me already, and I am here as a facilitator and a listener. I have been sober for over fifteen years.”
Harry’s there for longer than he needs to be, mostly to give Draco more time with the book he’s chosen. He knows for a fact that without him, Draco would never be allowed into Flourish and Blotts.
was the real thing. Even still, Harry couldn’t believe what he had just done. A voice in the back of his mind screamed at him to let Draco go.
“Hold on, how come I’m the only betrothed?” Harry argues, closing his eyes with a grin from behind Hermione’s surprisingly impressive wingspan. “What about the other way around?”
“Mr Draco Malfoy bears the complementary magical core to your own,” Ethel says reluctantly. Harry thinks he must be hallucinating. “If I could change the fact that your soulmate is a Death Eater, it would be the first thing that I would do.”
Draco felt his stomach flip as nausea crashed and crested around him in waves. He could barely see through the pain by the time he opened his eyes and reached for Harry’s fork. Shovelling a bite of eggs into his mouth provided the sweetest relief he had ever felt before.
Before he knew it, Harry was removing his cloak, letting it fall behind him, and reaching to pull his shirt from his body. Draco was doing the same, and Harry pushed him back down once he was finished to take a moment and admire his long and lean body. He kissed down the line of Draco’s bare chest, pausing just before his belt buckle. Harry glanced up at Draco for permission, and with a desperate nod of acceptance, Harry pulled the belt free from his trousers.
The basement is much more comforting of a room than Harry anticipates it to be. It looks exactly like those Muggle movies: chairs are arranged in a circle, and pastries and beverages sit atop a table to the side.
Draco felt a twinge of annoyance at being ignored. Harry had always bothered more with the plants than Draco himself. He knew that everyone needed an escape, but Harry sought one out too often. It wasn’t like Draco was any better at it, but it still hurt to be forgotten.
They’d all been a little suspicious about the quick turn, but it was hard for anyone to find any obvious fault in their relationship anymore. Harry supposed there really wasn’t one. But something about new Draco put him on edge. He wasn’t comfortable at all with the way things had been, but he certainly wasn’t satisfied with them now either.
Lyra had already left, and Draco watched as Harry conjured a Patronus to send to Ron. He idly wondered what they’d do with their day. If it meant avoiding such horrible pain, Draco would do anything asked of him.
!” He spat the words out menacingly, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. Before Harry could formulate a response, he had stalked away and rounded the corner out of sight.
Quickly, he pushes past Harry and out into the hallway, disappearing down the corridor with hurried steps. Harry lowers his wand, feeling confused, exhausted, and sad all over again.
There’s an unpleasantly loud silence in the room as Harry struggles to come to terms with what has just been said. He must be going crazy.
Harry sits up in the bed, regretting the decision immediately as his head spins unpleasantly in place. He knows he probably shouldn’t wake the sleeping body next to him, but it’s not someone he recognises immediately, and it sends a jolt of worry through his chest. While he can’t remember much of the night before, he certainly wouldn’t sleep with someone random…
Draco seems to be scuffling his feet, knocking his knee into Harry accidentally. “I don’t think whoever I have would want to know either.”
“Well,” Neville had continued, “I’ve been working with St Mungo’s on some research with Silybum Marianum. It’s a peculiar plant, you see, but it’s worked like a charm in Janus Thickey. It walks a fine line between magical and Muggle; it’s one of the few that does.”
“Well, I’m there for him,” Harry snapped, sounding harsher than he had meant to be. “Isn’t that enough?”
“So beautiful, Draco, come for me,” Harry said, feeling himself growing close. Draco tugged fiercely at his own cock until he shouted his release.
Breathing out a sigh of terror and relief, Harry climbs into bed completely dressed, propping himself up on the pillow. He looks down at Draco dozing next to him, and his heart squeezes painfully in his chest. He wonders what life would be like if Draco knew how to be happy without the drugs. Would that make things better? Harry can’t be sure.
She leads him into a room that’s bare, with a simple desk and two chairs in the middle. Piled high on the surface are large, though neatly organised, stacks of paperwork filing themselves gently into cabinets that sit to the far right of the space. The woman raises her wand, and the flying papers still. She motions forward for Harry to take a seat as she crosses to the other side and comfortably settles into her chair.
Again, Harry is distracted and overwhelmed by the loud music, but he’s surprised to see the dimly lit living room isn’t too crowded. He supposes they’re earlier to the party than he had been in the week prior, but it’s still an unsettling feeling, like the calm before a storm.
Harry shrugged, unsurprised. “I’m doing well. Things have been slow at the Ministry. Ron was assigned a huge case a few weeks ago which I was consulting on. But it seems like he closed it fairly quickly.” Harry actively worked to quell the bitterness in his tone.
“I brought soup since it’s cold as all hell outside,” she said, shrugging off her coat and settling into the chair across from Harry’s desk. He took his own and cleared space between them for lunch.
Despite the guest of honour’s disappearance, Harry was having a good enough time. George had spiked the pumpkin juice, and cheeks all around were stained a rosy pink. Everyone was swaying in place just a little more than usual.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “There’s a reason I brought groceries, you know. I’m betting your pantry is full of instant noodles and box mac and cheese.”
It takes him another hour to pick himself up off of the bathroom floor and head down to the kitchen, but Harry stays the entire time.
Harry feels disappointment and rejection hit him swiftly. He frowns down at his hands. Had he misjudged the situation? It’s quite possible, as he’s never been one to read the signs very well.
Harry forces a humourless laugh, but he can’t help but feel a lump form in his throat because how could he hurt someone he loves so much? He had spent the last few months watching Draco grow and change into someone so different, and so good. How could Harry not find love in that fact? How could he not feel guilt for hurting the first person he’d really, truly cared about in years?
Theo nods in understanding, and Harry doesn’t miss the flicker of concern crossing silently between the two of them.
Then he grew impatient. He stalked over to the fireplace in the living room and stood over it for a moment. It would seem a little desperate to firecall in addition to sending an owl, but it wasn’t as though he had any alternative ideas.
It wasn’t as though he’d been offered any of the larger cases, and he would have taken them in a heartbeat if only to feel like he was doing something productive. At least there was this.
“They’re Greek statues,” Harry said, paging through the guide. “People love them, apparently.” He eyed the young Muggles around him, crouched beneath the statues as if they were in God’s presence.
“I don’t want to be harsh,” Ron says, more gently this time. “But you need to do it soon, or he’ll kill you both.”
His eyes opened lazily, and they were a blinding silver. He was euphoric in a way he had never been before, careless and open and free despite Harry’s unflinchingly tight hold on his body. His jaw went slack as he pressed tighter into the space between Harry’s sternum, as though laying himself to rest.
“Well, yell if you need me, then,” Harry said skeptically, but he exited the small bathroom and left Draco by himself.
Then, he was in an alley. Rain pouring down from the skies, splashes of dirty water from drainage pipes in his hair.
“You know,” Draco says, his eyes tracking something Harry can’t see across the ceiling. “I’ve always preferred a kind of French ending.”
Draco was at least glad that Harry hadn’t dragged him in with him. He was still terribly sore from the night before.
“More flowers?” Harry laughed but felt warmth blossom through his chest at the thought of the Honeysuckles. He had put them in a vase in his room immediately, though he knew he would have to explain that away at some point. Maybe Neville would cover for him…
Draco’s eyes widen with surprise, and he pauses for a moment as though considering his options. His eyes track back to the door for a quick second, but he climbs in, Claude jumping out of his grasp to settle by Harry’s feet.
Harry was immediately uncomfortable, wishing he could put space between the two of them. Still, he postured, hoping Draco wouldn’t sense his nervousness heating the room. His hopes were dashed, of course.
Draco sucks in a breath through his teeth, his eyes widening, and Harry thinks he might just know where they are going.
“We are not friends,” Malfoy said, but there wasn’t malice behind the words. He sounded more hurt than anything. “You made that very clear last week.”
A crack of lightning illuminates the dark sky, and Pansy shouts in excitement. It’s definitely George or Charlie that puts on some Weird Sisters as upbeat music begins to stream from the Burrow, backlit by angry clouds.
On weekends, Draco would always excuse himself to the bedroom before dinner just to avoid conversation. And Harry would let him, despite worrying about Draco’s weight and if he was really eating enough. It was clear that, usually, he was not. The Draco across from the table, though, groaned into his fork at the first bite, and Harry grinned. He never needed validation to know he was a good cook, but it never went amiss.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry bawled, tears swimming lazily through his vision as he clutched Draco closer to his chest. “I never meant for this to happen. If I could go back in time, I’d change everything. I would do anything, Draco, anything. Oh, God —”
“You know, if you hypothetically opened up this bookshop,” Harry says, “you wouldn’t necessarily have to deal with many people from the Wizarding World.”
,” Harry said, and a few shovels and shears came flying out from underneath various plant boxes. One particular trowel smacked sharply at Draco’s shoulder before settling into Harry’s palm.
Harry reached a hand out, placing it indifferently on Draco’s knee. It tightened as the seconds ticked by.
He just sat, hollow-eyed, and went through the motions of the day as though they were a chore. He ate, bathed, and slept because Harry instructed him to, but it was clear the actions weren’t his own.
He’d forced Draco to freeze Ginny out entirely, and other than her, he didn’t have many friends that hadn’t remained loyal to Harry to begin with.
“We have the stasis charms set for a reason. Maybe you can ask Neville if there’s something more to be done here. We can even recast some of the charms in the morning if it’s worrying you.”
He’s a bit too intoxicated to get himself home properly, and thoughts of a certain, stubborn blonde swimming through his mind aren’t helping him sober up.
“Milk thistle. Earlier tonight, when you couldn’t control yourself, I couldn’t either. My body, something about it, just wanted to let you do as you pleased. My mind wouldn’t let me say no.”
, was something else. It was a rush like pure heroin swan diving into his veins and shocking his heart into a euphoric rhythm.
“You really don’t need to be doing this,” Harry says gesturing at the spread of vegetables before him. “A simple thank you was enough.”
“I appreciate that,” he says, chewing on his bottom lip, eyes trained down on his hands. He’s placing a tea bag inside each mug. “She runs these group sessions, you know. Muggles call it Narcotics Anonymous.”
“Two for dinner, please,” Draco said to the host at the desk, who regarded them with a judgmental expression. His eyes flicked up and down their bodies, and Harry felt like he wanted to curl in on himself and hide. Draco’s expression hardened, and the host snapped into action.
“I’m not saying this happened only because we were lonely. We married because there was nothing else left for us to do. We’re meant for each other, Harry. We always have been. But sometimes the things you love most will turn around and hurt you still.”
“I need to do something for him,” Harry speaks again, but Luna is chatting to Neville, and no one is listening to him. “I need to tell him.”
“I wouldn’t have taken you to be the kind of person to hang out in a muggle club on a Saturday night, and least of all alone.”
Draco tried fucking deeper into Harry’s mouth, but immediately stopped when he felt the finger in his arse move.
He usually preferred topping with his partner, since that came with having more control and the rather active part of fucking, but nevertheless did he enjoy a bit of prostate stimulation, now and then. He enjoyed the warm water raining down on him and the jets at all varying heights and angles, massaging his muscles. He thought about the previous night, about Draco tossing and turning while he plowed his prostate, using the enlarged plug. How Draco let go after Harry told him to, how utterly relaxed he lay there and let it all happen. He felt his cock swelling in his hand, and slowly started moving it up and down.
“Snape just gave me and Malfoy detention.” He muttered, measuring spoonfuls of doxy eggs into the mortar and pestle.
Crabbe unfroze, experimentally moving his fingers, and his expression looking confused. He saw Draco and seemed to recall what he thought had happened, and stood up, looking out the window and the calming snowfall.
The voice boomed out as though amplified by a spell, like the one Mr. Bagman used at the Quidditch World Cup. It seemed to shake the constructed room they were in, the floor rumbling as every bottle and jar rattled.
He noticed the pale skin of the other boy’s neck again, and pressed his lips against it. It was soft and cold, trembling. The thing inside Harry roared in pleasure, begging him for more, its hunger growing. He felt Draco go tense again, and he opened his mouth against his throat, licking it, tasting it. He brushed his teeth against it, then nibbled, then bit, hard.
"Why stay in until it's cold then?" Blaise asked, forcing anything accusatory or angry out of his voice. Draco sighed, shedding the towel to pull on his jumper, his ribs scarily prominent as he reached up.
She held grudges and hurt people who hurt her friends. Draco had hurt people to protect his family. If in his situation, could she claim pacifism? Or would her own inclinations, which sometimes verged on
“Crucio.” He hissed, an impulse he’d never felt before taking over, the unknown wrath consuming him. Draco screamed, staggering another few steps before collapsing, curling in on himself on the stone floor, convulsing horribly. Harry stopped the spell as soon as he realised what he’d done, his own heart pounding and his stomach churning as Draco twitched and sobbed on the floor. How could he have done that?! Harry thought, disgusted with himself.
“Is in here as nice as the Slytherin dorms?” he asked. Draco looked a bit surprised by the question but sighed.
“We have to do something.” he said earnestly, holding on tightly. Draco sighed, glancing around before speaking in hardly more than a whisper.
God, it was like nothing had been more interesting since Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban. Harry noticed Draco reading Wuthering Heights across the room, holding his sandwich in one hand and the book in the other, and was proud of him for the commitment.
Then Harry kissed him, and Draco could only hold onto the other boy's jumper for dear life. He could barely hear the Hall's uproar at this sudden development, his blood rushing in his ears.
“P-Potter?! What- Where- Why are you-…!” he trailed off, completely baffled. Harry sat up, clearly showing himself to be fully dressed, and put on his glasses.
The phrase made Draco's whole body shudder, his hands tightening on the fabric already clenched in them.
They ended up playing for most of the morning and half the afternoon. Drinks and snacks appeared at random as soon as one of them thought they fancied something, and a full roast dinner with all the Christmas trimmings appeared around 4 o’clock.
Harry watched Draco’s wide grey eyes trying to look over at Crabbe, like he was begging him to help him. Harry knew, if the spell on Crabbe broke at any moment, he would leap to Draco’s aid, probably kill Harry if he managed to get his huge hands on him…especially after he saw what the Monster had planned.
It was nearing April when Harry was finally able to block the spell most of the time and had figured out a way to lock his thoughts away as Snape suggested: imagining everything in his head contained as the cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive, every aspect of himself becoming an object or feature inside his childhood dwelling. He changed it up sometimes, making them a chess board or a Quidditch match to see which was easier to maintain, but he always went back to that oppressive, degrading hole his aunt and uncle forced him to sleep for the first 10 years of his so far fairly short life. It was a place of hate and loneliness, but also comfort and escape, and he used that to his own advantage.
It was a short while before Draco woke up. The silver eyes opened slowly, blinking himself awake after a little stretch and experimental snuggle into Harry’s warmth. His vision focussed on Harry, and his face went from sleepy, to confused, to horrified in about 3 seconds. He jerked away from Harry, looking around frantically, drawing himself up and away from him.
“I-in Snape’s office…and before that in a bathroom…a-and then in Hogsmeade…” he said, trying to get it all out before it poisoned him. “It hurts so much…” he said quietly, feeling impossibly small and weak. Pansy made a little noise and she hugged him tightly, and he hugged her back as they both cried.
The room was lit in various places by candles, some floating, some rooted to the ancient pieces of furniture. Perhaps the dim light was for Harry's benefit, sparing him further headache, but it made it difficult to work out where he was. He could sense he was still in Hogwarts, but without windows he had no clue where.
Opposite the hearth, was a large four-poster bed with velvet curtains drawn back by heavy gold rope, and lying on the mattress amongst the ruffled sheets was Draco Malfoy. He was naked, on his back, his arms and legs at odd angles, like he’d been dropped from a height. His eyes were open, but half lidded, staring up at the bed’s red canopy. His chest was moving so he was alive.
“Christ, Malfoy looks awful.” Ron tried to whisper, making several heads turn towards the Slytherin table.
"I don't need Potter…" Draco muttered, upset he couldn't protect himself. Pansy held his hand and squeezed, sympathetic but firm, before letting go.
"If we take you to the Order, they might be able to help." Harry said slowly, all of them looking at him now. He exchanged a look with Ron, then sighed. "But you will need to give them something in return." He said.
"'I've no doubt in your ability to manage your studies and interests well, but please ensure you don't fall behind. Your father is particularly eager for you to achieve Outstanding in Potions, as you know.'" He recited, then looked at Harry intensely.
“Yes, dear, he will be able to leave in a week or so. You’re his friends, I take it?” she asked them both, and they nodded. “He will need you. You need to be there for him…” she said seriously, looking into both of their eyes. They both nodded, tears forming in Pansy’s eyes again, Blaise’s jaw so clenched his teeth ached. “For now, the best thing we can do for him is let him sleep.” She said, then seemed to think for a moment before speaking again. “He’s very thin…has he been eating?” she asked them. Blaise and Pansy looked at each other, then Blaise shook his head.
"One more thing…" Hermione said, perching on the end of the other sofa nearest Draco. Who looked at her through the sides of his eyes, tensing again. "Harry noticed a… a scar on your neck, a bite mark from a werewolf," Draco flinched, hand shooting to the exact spot, between the juncture of his throat and shoulder, towards the back. The line was an elegant slope, his bones delicate. Painfully so. "Can you explain that, please? How is it you're not…-" she trailed off, and Draco swallowed.
