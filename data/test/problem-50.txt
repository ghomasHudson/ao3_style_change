It was only part way through his first day that Harry realised he had never had a first day on the job before. No matter what had come before — the DA, or the Order, or finding Horcuxes — none of it had been actual, gainful adult employment. He tried not to let the thought throw him for a loop as the receptionist, whose name was Betty, helped him fill in some forms and showed him how the appointment system worked. “Just in case,” she had said. “We all pitch in around here as much as we can!”
Relieved, Harry let out an exhale which rippled strongly across the surface of his tea, turning it into a mini-ocean. “Thank God.”
Hermione sighed again but the look she cast him was amused, her brown eyes bright. “Shut up,” she said, kicking lightly at his shin. “
She was beautiful, her hair thick and shining and pulled high into a knot at the top of her head. She was laughing at something — a story Seamus had told her the night before when there had been a group pub night that Harry begged off, a thoroughly embellished story about his latest fiasco with the postwoman he had developed a gigantic crush on. The laughter brightened her face but there was something in the grim determination in her expression that made Harry’s heart ache.
Draco still didn’t speak. He kept studying Harry, eyes sweeping across his face. It made Harry feel self-conscious but he tried not to move or fidget or do anything but submit to Draco’s stare. He wasn’t sure what was happening, except that Draco looked intent and intense and they stayed like that for what felt like minutes. Eventually, Draco reached out and traced his fingertips along Harry’s cheekbone, down his nose, around his mouth.
“It’s not that bad, mate.” Ron clapped him on the back. “I mean, picture it again: the two of us, partners in wands. Ronald B. Weasley and Harmond J. Potter, esquires, Aurors.”
Malfoy’s face had been bright red, his whole neck a flush and Harry had looked at it and tasted it and he’d been walking on air ever since.
Malfoy lifted a finger and pointed at Harry. They were standing close enough that the tip of his finger just about missed Harry’s chest. Harry focused on it. “You don’t know anything about my relationship with my mother and I’d thank you to keep out of it.”
He could feel himself starting to annoy people. Ron had thought it was funny at first and then blatantly told him, on the third morning, “Christ, I can’t even look at you in the mornings, you make me sick.” Then again, Ron had never been good with mornings, so Harry didn’t let it faze him. The barista at the coffee shop he kept ducking into commented on his mood and grinned at him, like they were sharing a secret. There was a picture in the
but I just think that you should take a little more time with the decision. Really think it over.” She took a sip of her wine, nose scrunching as she tasted it. “You don’t owe Narcissa Malfoy anything.”
if his parents had been alive. The water hit his back, hot and hard as needles, as he sat on the floor of the Malfoy’s shower and pressed his face into his knees. Maybe his mother had enjoyed long showers. Maybe his dad had liked baths. Maybe he would remember bath nights as a kid fondly, maybe he would have been read to sleep, maybe he would have grown up with parents who loved him and pressed kisses to his forehead before he went to sleep and slipped money under his pillow every time a tooth fell out. Maybe he wouldn’t have had to walk into a forest and say that he was ready to die. Maybe he wouldn’t have felt like crying in a Malfoy’s shower, maybe he wouldn’t have been pressing his fingernails so tightly into the soft skin of his thighs that they bruised. Maybe.
Hermione obviously decided to let him have some space because he barely saw her until right before he was due to go to the Malfoy’s. She met him as he came down the stairs, a cup of tea in her hands and a worried look on her face. “Are you okay?”
Walking slowly home, Harry thought maybe he did know what Draco had meant. Harry, who had always had some form of a purpose, had pulled away from the paths that Hermione laid out, that Ron wanted. Harry had ducked letters and avoided meetings and gave his best shot at not giving his best. He had wanted to relax, to settle, to try and just be himself. Turning down a residential street, glancing at the soft glow of living room windows and trying not to stare, Harry thought maybe he wasn’t good at just settling.
“Put your finger down.” Malfoy did, slowly. Harry nodded and said, “You don’t know anything about my relationship with Ginny and you were dying for me to tell you all about it.”
They did. Harry refused to let Draco say no to anything. He challenged him to races across the grounds, easily beating him which horrified Draco to no end. His face was red from exertion and his eyes were bright with competitiveness as he got into Harry’s face and accused him of cheating, loudly and at length.
“Please, Draco. I won’t indulge your daddy kink.”
“You’re such a pushover,” Ron said. It was clear he was saying it just to talk. He shook his head and then the two of them were walking down the corridor, heading to the courtroom as it was called. “I can’t believe you’ve no backbone.”
When it seemed like the interview was coming to a close he said, “When do you want to start?”
all this, but the only thing you’re doing is visiting Malfoy Manor every other fucking day and drinking with me. That’s not a life, Harry.”
Cracking open his tin of cider, Harry said, “You know you don’t have to keep doing this, Ron. I’m fine.”
Draco was beautiful when he smiled like that. He kept smiling, cupping Harry’s face, pulling him into a kiss. “I love you too,” he said.  “I love you. I do. Even though you’re so stupid and I thought you’d ignore my note and I thought — I thought there was no way. Even though I thought you wouldn’t. I love you.”
When he spoke, he watched Malfoy intently. “All you have to do, Malfoy, to change how people see you is to change yourself.” Malfoy looked at him askance, his mouth falling open and his narrow shoulders rising as if he was readying himself for a fight. Harry held up a hand. “I really, honestly don’t mean you have to change everything about you. You can still be roughly the same person, but you have to
“Yes.” Harry nodded and then he sat down. “Malfoy kissed me.”
“One of the ghosts?” Harry sat up straighter.
“Shouldn’t you be?”
The surprise had hit him first, the shock of it making his heart stutter in his chest and his lungs become momentarily incapable of breath but that passed. He felt the sun on his face warming him and clutched Draco’s note in the other hand. Harry realised that’s how he felt: warm. The sun was rising in his chest, warming him from the inside out, illuminating and making everything bright and new. He felt kissed by nature. He didn’t think he felt different — he felt like himself but brighter, stronger, reborn somehow.
“Okay,” Harry said, as if it answered anything Malfoy had said. “I know that. I know that, I swear. Look, I’m not really sure what’s going on here? I know I started it, I just — I just don’t know why I did either. And now you’re yelling a bit and I’m just kind of standing here, putting my foot in it, I guess. And you seem pretty upset.”
December, but if Harry squinted he could picture it in the middle of summer, filled with bursting beautiful plants, swaying in the breeze. Behind the house, a field stretched and fell off. He knew they were on a cliff and he stared past the house to the sea. It was a grey day and the sea turned and churned, waves crashing down and frothing against the shore. Harry found himself smiling and he walked up the garden path, rapping his knuckles on the door.
He found Narcissa back in the rose garden. She smiled and listened to him and asked questions and nodded. They talked for twenty minutes and when he asked where Draco was and how he had been, Narcissa’s face looked a little pinched.
Malfoy stroked the soft skin on Harry’s hip once more and let out a shuddering breath. “Don’t rush yourself.” He stepped back, nodded at Harry and left the bathroom.
“I don’t want you to be in my shadow, Draco,” Harry said, removing his hand from under Draco’s gin. “You said that and I — I don’t want that for you. I don’t want it for anyone. I think you shine brightly enough on your own. I think you’re going to do great things.”
Draco laughed. He pressed his hands tighter over Harry’s and laughed again before gently moving Harry’s hands away from his face. “Don’t be stupid, Harry,” he said. Harry thought it was an odd thing to say — he didn’t know what he was being stupid about — but he didn’t get a chance to ask before Draco shrugged and said, “My mother thinks I’m weak and pathetic.”
The owl saved him from having to figure out what to say (did he laugh? Did he say something flirty? What was flirty? Had he ever flirted before in his life?). It swooped in, dropping the letter in front of Harry and then retreating to perch on the kitchen counter. Ginny blinked at the owl in surprise and Harry stared at it too, dumbstruck. It was because he was staring that he noticed the owl tenderly turn in circles, apparently displeased at the layer of dust on the counter.
“I guess so. Or I guess I’m going to try. I don’t want to be stuck.”
“It isn’t true. I can never not listen to you. It’s very hard not to. You talk all the time — no, shut up, you really do. It’s constant. You can’t walk into this house without you talking, but it’s not new.” Harry shrugged, flattening the palms of his hands on the platform. He took care not to brush Malfoy’s hands with his, although their fingers were close. “You talked all the time in school too and you’re
Narcissa’s mouth quirked upwards, just barely. “Yes. Draco’s emotional control is not the best at the moment.” Feeling extremely kind, Harry decided not to tell her that Malfoy very rarely seemed in control. He nodded instead, which he felt was the perfect neutral response. “I don’t suppose he would mind terribly if you would talk to him. I heard him talking to one of the ghosts the other day and it upset me greatly.”
He liked the kitchen, the hexagonal wine storage, the large flagstones, the heat that sneaked through from the open fire in the living room and the slightly worn, plush armchairs you could see around it. He liked the clean lines and bright colours and the quiet. Hermione seemed to like it too, being surrounded by pictures of her with her family everywhere. The Granger’s had obviously been proud of their daughter: the hallway was covered with photographs of the three of them and, even when she went off to Hogwarts, the pictures continued — this time with holidays and day trips, Hermione beaming with her new teeth. Harry liked to walk past one in particular, the three Granger’s standing in front of King’s Cross on Hermione’s first day. It was the last picture before the kitchen and the one he walked past, a bottle of red wine in his hand, and a smile on his face.
Hermione placed her hand flat on her chest in mock-horror. “He shall have to be punished for it!”
Harry shrugged. “Yeah. After I testify, I’m gonna give him the friendship bracelet I made.”
Harry sunk a hand through his hair and shook his head, pulling harshly at it. Ginny did not budge. She just kept looking at him. He thought he should have been angrier than he was, even though the anger roared in his ears, made him feel unsteady. He thought everything she was saying should sound like a new accusation, but a slippery voice in the back of his head wound itself free and whispered in his ear
Malfoy sighed into it and rested his hands on Harry’s hips. Harry smiled into his mouth and kissed him again.
Christmas at the Weasley’s had been everything that Harry had known it would be: so loud that it sometimes felt you had to shout to be heard and so loving that it poured out of everyone, made them happier and more grounded. Harry found himself sitting in a corner a few times just trying to soak it up, to revel in the feeling. He had died, but he was here. He was here and he was loved and he loved.
Herbert looked at him calmly and pointedly. Harry shrugged. “Look, she’s every right to not like Malfoy’s,” he said. Herbert turned his beak away. “Don’t be rude,” Harry found himself saying as he dashed off a return response.
Harry pressed his hands deep into his jeans pockets for warmth and rocked onto his heels, laughing. “You said that a couple weeks ago.”
“Did you?” Malfoy still sounded chilly and disinterested.
Harry huffed to disguise the thrill of laughter that threatened to spill out. “I’m shocked.”
“I honestly loathe you, Potter. Move, you make me sick.”
“No, no.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “It’s important for me to say it, so will you listen?” Ron nodded but Harry barely looked at him before he barrelled on. “I love you, you know that? And I’d love to just do stuff with you forever, like I’ve always dreamed about working with you even though I would have point blank refused to get business cards. And for years and years I thought that it was going to be us against the world, yeah? Like, we were going to grow up and become grizzled old Auror partners together, with a long list of stories that we could break out and people would be so awed and impressed and, more than that, we’d be able to say that we had fun and did good and always had each other’s backs. That’s what I wanted. A part of me still kinda wants it, but it’s not all I want, you know? And if Ginny thinks I’m stuck — and I don’t think she’s wrong, I’m just saying if she thinks I’m stuck then maybe I am. And maybe I feel a bit stuck. And maybe I feel like the only way to not be stuck is to do something that I want now, not that I wanted before. I’m not the same person I was a couple of years ago. I’m not even the same person I was a couple of months ago and I don’t really want to be an Auror anymore, but I would do it in a heartbeat for you if that’s what you want me to do.”
there a gift in them?” he asked.
She made a noise, though, and he turned his face towards her. He didn’t know what he had expected to see but the firm determination on it startled him. It reminded Harry of all of her best moments and she squeezed his hand again, sitting straight as she said, firm as if settling the matter, “Well, if it’s for you, it’s a different matter altogether. But drink up, because I think I’ll need to get a bit smashed to appreciate it.”
They stopped by a bench fairly far into the park, secreted away between two of the larger trees. There was a fountain not far from them, lazily gushing water. A redhead girl was sitting on the edge of it, her arm wrapped around a toddler in her lap, excitedly talking to him. Harry looked at them for a moment, feeling a flutter of loss in his chest, before he looked away.
Harry contemplated telling her that there was something soothing about getting to eat breakfast without list-making but ultimately decided against it. Instead he smeared some of his boiled egg over his toast and slowly started to chew. Ron flung himself into the chair beside him, turning beseeching eyes onto Harry.
“Don’t play dumb with me, Potter. You and I both know that being here is probably last on your list of things you want to do. Why do you
that much of an artist, Harry, and no one wants you to draw on your skin.” Harry pretended to be affronted and she shrugged, citing tough love.
Draco startled and looked up, his quill scrawling a line across the page. Harry sniggered but didn’t move, his laughter dying off as Draco scowled. It was a quick scowl, there and gone, clearly replaced by embarrassment.
“Thanks,” he said, holding the mug. He did not sit down and Malfoy did not tell him to. Instead, they stared at each other until Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Draco flushed. The firelight on his hair still made it look orange and Harry wanted to touch it so badly that his fingers twitched. “Why did you bring this here?”
When he slid out of the bed, Harry hesitated, staring around the room. He could hear the noise of Draco sleeping, the rise and fall of his chest in the corner of his eye. The room was messier than Harry had ever seen and he spent a few minutes searching for some paper and a quill.
Hermione still held his hand, warm and clasped between hers, and chewed nervously on her bottom lip. Ron studied Harry calmly, his hand wrapped loosely around the stem of the wine glass. He looked tired and sad, but he gave Harry a half-smile.
“I mean, I guess but not really,” Harry said, lying like the huge liar he was. “This is — the things I have here were given to me for the dog walking and stuff that I’ve been doing for people. It’s too much for all of us to have.”
“I do.” Harry lifted his glass to his lips and then thought better of it. “I know what you mean. But you know what I mean too. I do owe her.”
Her fingers were tight around Harry’s and he focused on that, the pressure of it, as he leaned back on the stool, resting his back against it. “I think I might think a bit less of me,” he admitted, keeping his focus on their clasped hands instead of Hermione’s face.
“Right, of course,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Shut it now.”
Ron watched Harry with a considering look on his face, his gaze searching, before he finally nodded. “Yeah, all right. I’ve decided I’m gonna help you figure out what you like, anyway. This weekend. We can go and sort of try a bunch of things out.”
Her head appeared in the fireplace shortly after eleven o’clock at night and Harry could see the way that disappointment and fatigue had settled into the lines on her face even through the flames. Ron sat beside him and tensed, just slightly. Harry watched his friend smile, act jovial, grin, and keep his hands curled around his mug’s handle so tightly his knuckles shone bone-white.
i left this fic alone for a good few months and only really started plugging away at again around may, when i felt like i needed a bit of hopeful relief from work and the yk state of the world! i wrestled w/ the idea of endings a lot here & when i decided on this, i thought it worked for me. hopefully it works for you!
Malfoy did not look any happier. Instead, he looked more troubled, more pinched, and he gnawed on his bottom lip. “Of course it is, Potter. I don’t think there’s any point in pretending otherwise.”
,” Hermione insisted with wide eyes. She looked cried out, exhausted and yet somehow happy, an ease in her expression which had been missing for months, if not years.
Malfoy pressed firmly down on the piano keys. “I’m obviously going to say yes, Potter. I know my audience.”
Ron nodded, a large hand still cradled around the mug. He looked serious, eyes huge and assessing as he looked at Harry, head tilted to one side just slightly. “Then, mate, you gotta figure it out. If you want to do it, then you will. It’s just one of those things, right? If you think someone is worth it, you figure it out.” The words settled in the air and Harry let them wrap around him, focusing on them, on Ron’s deep, solemn tone of voice and the comforting atmosphere and then — then Ron said, “Can’t imagine why you’d think he’s worth it, of course, but I always thought you were a bit of a weirdo.”
Ginny burst into peals of laughter and turned away. “Go the fuck away, Harry.”
“What if I like a good hump day?” Harry asked. There was a beat and then he screwed up his face, holding up a hand. “Don’t. Don’t. I heard it.”
Herbert hooted and hollered, jumping around and pecking Harry when he wasn’t quick enough to get the letter off. Harry groaned and took the note, unrolling it even as he cast a spell. It was
“Really?” Harry asked, a smile crawling onto his face. “Because I thought you were thinking about demolishing that sandwich.”
“From a Hufflepuff.” Malfoy made a face. “Much of the same, really.”
For a few seconds he was blindingly, achingly jealous and then he brushed it away. He was happy for them. They deserved it.
“Really? Even with,” here Harry trailed off, not sure how to be delicate or even if he wanted to be. He found he did, though. He had always wanted to draw reactions from Malfoy, to claw at him with words and hands and drag up anger, or spite, to make his eyes flash with heat. He didn’t want that in the same way, anymore. He wanted the other boy’s attention, but he didn’t want to hurt him quite so badly. He hesitated, licked his lips and then said, softly, “Even with everything that has happened here.”
Ron blinked again. “I ‘uno. You know Hermione. She likes to talk.”
“A man can do both,” Ron declared grandly. A second later, his smile disappeared. “I just don’t know if I want to see him.”
Harry nodded, slowly. “Right. Well, where I am is in your kitchen and where I want to be is—”
Harry lifted a shoulder. “No, I think he’s mostly fine with it. Ron’s a good guy — and if you disagree with me, I will throw this mug at you, so.”
Ron was leaning against the wall when they exited the courtroom, his arms folded over his chest and his chin tilted towards the ground. The crowd parted around them, helped no doubt by the fierce glare that Hermione gave anybody who got too close. Harry noticed she didn’t once let go of her wand.
this much. Harry’s embarrassment was warm and fresh, but the wave that swept through him this time was gratitude and love and a hundred other things that pushed the tide of embarrassment back. Before, when he was small and young and alone, he had never thought he would get this: somebody who cared about him like Ron clearly did. Harry had to take a breath before he spoke.
There wasn’t a pause in the music. It kept going, although Harry saw Draco look up from under his eyelashes, watched him realise who he had invaded his space. Draco didn’t acknowledge him. He just kept playing, a song that Harry didn’t know himself but one which he had heard Draco hum many times. Harry walked across the room and lowered himself onto the piano bench beside Draco.
After a minute, Malfoy took a breath and moved as if he was going to get up. Harry, not thinking, acted on pure instinct, reaching out and grabbing at his shoulder. Malfoy stared at him and Harry moved his hand, cupping the back of Malfoy’s head, watching his fingers disappear into Malfoy’s hair. He pulled him forward and kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him.
The kitchen was Harry’s favourite room in Hermione’s house — a room that had considered all different kinds of décor, before nudging its way towards farmhouse. There was a large, deep Belfast sink, tea towels decorated with farm animals, a breakfast bar with large stools, and all of it painted a sage green which seemed to soothe every person that walked into it. The Granger’s hadn’t yet returned from Australia – “I’m not sure where they are anymore,” Hermione had said, her face tight enough when she told him that Harry had decided not to push it. Hermione had wanted to come home, though, and Harry had made it his base for the time being.
,” Malfoy breathed out. He raised his hands to his face, digging his palms into his eyes, and then he looked straight at Harry. Harry felt the gaze like needles on his skin. “You can be upset about your parents, Potter. I’m not going to think less of you.”
“You mentioned that.” Hermione reached across to pick a crumb off Ron’s plate. “Maybe he just couldn’t think of anything to say, Harry, you know. It’s hardly as if the two of you have many common interests.”
There was a pause, as if Ron seemed to realise that Harry was asking a proper question, that he wanted a real answer. His eyes were still not all the way open and sleep made his movements sluggish and slow as he shifted on the sofa. The pillows he had tucked around him moved. Ron yawned and then said, “Yeah sometimes. But it’s different than — whatever it is you’re asking for.”
Malfoy looked at  Harry and Harry realised he looked both helpless and amused. Helpless, amused and slightly lost, like he’d wandered out onto a ledge and didn’t know what he was doing. Harry realised he’d seen that look on this boy’s face again and shifted his gaze to the distance. He cleared his throat.
“Not tonight. Maybe another time. It wasn’t that bad, it was just — it was just long.” Ron sighed and rolled his shoulders like he was working out a particularly bad knot. “It’s making me tired to think about it.”
Harry didn’t know why he had caved into an instinct so quickly. He didn’t know what brought him to a place where he blasted through anything that could be good for him.
“Well!” Ginny laughed. “I want to know what you want, Harry. That’s it, right now. I just want you to tell me if you want me, okay?”
Malfoy let out a choked laugh when Harry did. “You’re the exact dictionary definition of a decent sort, Potter.”
A bloom of colour appeared on Malfoy’s face but he did not acknowledge it. Stiffly, he said, “It looked like you were having fun.”
and I always hear you. I listen. I swear, Malfoy, I listen. I just — sometimes I don’t think we talk the same language. Sometimes I’m not sure the words that you use mean what I think they mean.”
Hermione looked at Ron and then back at Harry. Ron nodded and Hermione squeezed his hand and said, “You’re allowed to talk to us about it. I’m not going to pretend that he wasn’t a heinous child, teenager and young adult but I think he’s...trying.”
Harry laughed. “Your son’s not had his verdict yet.”
He laughed, his chest expanding further, and Harry took a long swallow of his wine until the glass was completely drained. Hermione followed suit.
Two days after he got the job at the animal clinic, he stopped by an apothecary with a list and brought some of the ingredients back to Malfoy Manor with him.
Potter, I am
“I knew something was going to happen!”
“Wank over.”
Harry stared at it for a moment and then, despite himself, started to laugh. Twenty minutes later, he found himself standing outside the Malfoy Manor gates. For the first time, they did not immediately open for him.
Harry had laughed and loved it and Ron had just looked almost as panicked as he did now, staring at shelves of snow globes and baubles and decorative tea towels.
Hermione nodded and said goodbye as Harry grabbed his jacket and apparated to the gates of Malfoy Manor.
“Where? On a poster?”
“Uh, mate, you’ve got a little something on your — neck.”
“I can’t bear you either,” Harry said, feeling lighter. “Especially not when you’re chucking candlesticks at me. Can we sit somewhere there’s no candlesticks?”
“A job fair. He arranged one. For me.” Malfoy was still looking at him as if Harry had sprouted three heads. Harry lifted a hand, almost as if to check, and then ran it through his hair instead. Malfoy kept watching him. “It was really nice, actually. People don’t really do things like that for me and he’s not trying to press or whatever, I think he just wants me to find something to do with my time.”
Harry felt his curiosity tug at him. He took a step forward and Blighter rushed forward himself, hand up, as if he could stop Harry in mid-air. “Mr Potter, it is a bad time. I do not believe Master Draco or Mistress Narcissa would be happy to entertain  guests at this present moment.”
He wanted to but instead he found himself sitting at a slightly dusty kitchen table, a bottle of newly opened firewhiskey calling his name. Ginny poured the measures, as blessedly heavy-handed as her brothers had taught her to be, making sure they were always evenly matched. Harry kept his hands wrapped around the glass, watching her as she flung back her latest shot.
Hermione snorted. “Would you tell your mum Narcissa Malfoy’s cupcakes are better than hers?”
Silence swirled around them for a minute as Draco tilted his head, surveying Harry and then looking over at where their brooms were hovering patiently, waiting for them. Harry watched his expression change, shift, and then watched Draco swallow again. “Okay,” he said. “Okay. Let’s go eat, Potter.”
There was a light in Ron’s eyes that looked almost dangerous as he said, “Well, you don’t know everything me and Hermione’ve got up to.”
“I’m asking because of — because of Malfoy.”
Harry took a breath and listened as the charges were read out, as Malfoy responded, as the proceedings started. The cadence was slightly more familiar now but Harry couldn’t let himself get lost in it. He couldn’t stop himself from sneaking glances at Malfoy.
He made a noise in the back of his throat and then cleared it. There was no point feeling sorry for himself. This wasn’t about him.
Harry met Ron’s eyes over the top of Hermione’s head and thought he believed that, too.
Narcissa held up a hand; Harry was extremely relieved to have an outside impetus to be quiet. She was smiling and Draco’s amusement was shining from his face too, his grin wide and the light in his eyes undeniable. Harry did not stare.
“I brought back a dozen cupcakes,” Harry said, warm and amused. Beside him, he felt  Hermione suppressing her laughter.
“No! I most certainly should not be. You can try and lord it over the rest of us however you want, that you’re so
— were to do anything other than talk.”
Grinning, he realised he was crumpling the note. He read it again and again, tucking the words into a secret place in his chest. He wanted to remember them. He wanted to never forget them. He felt like he was soaring, expanding, like he was brave and brilliant somehow. He felt exactly like he had that day he had forced Draco to fly with him to try to prove that life wasn’t boring and dull.
what you said, when I was upset about Father. You said you believed me. And now you’re saying that you don’t believe that I can be better than that, I guess. So if you don’t know how I feel about — about the last year, about anything, then why are you even here?”
They kept not speaking as Malfoy led the way to his rooms, the magic activating when he got close. Harry watched it, dispassionate for the first time, and then he watched Malfoy tug him towards the en suite as if he wasn’t attached to his body. He saw himself place a hand on Malfoy’s upper arm, curling his fingers around Malfoy’s biceps and tugging him close. He saw himself lift a hand to Malfoy’s neck, dragging him down to Harry’s level so he could press his mouth against Malfoy’s jawline.
Pushing his hands into his trouser pockets, Harry scowled at the ground. He thought about arguing, but it felt kind of pointless. It was what he was known for. He was definitely not going to argue. “I think things through.”
), Harry tried to hide his smile by taking a bite out of the macaroon.
Hermione’s expression was full of compassion. “Oh, Harry. You’re going to figure it out. You always do.”
It struck Harry then that that was probably quite creepy and he took a few steps back and then made his footsteps louder as he approached the family room for the second time. This time, when he got to the doorway, both Malfoy’s were looking at it.
“Not particularly,” Narcissa said, voice devoid of any inflection. “House arrest is rarely fun for those placed under it and Draco is so young. Being cooped up does not agree with him.”
“Why would I be talking about if I already knew?”
“Where are you going?”
“That’s because you’re an idiot,” Malfoy said, in a tone that was almost normal. “I tell you it all the time and you never listen to me. I’m very clever, so you really should.”
Skipping over the fact that Malfoy was making up words now, Harry snorted. “Talking to
Draco sniffed. “Not me. I’m English.”
. Harry stood there, practically frozen, trying hard to be a wall of calm in the middle of Draco’s incessant motion.
“Please stop talking to the potions,” Harry said fondly, curling his fingers around Draco’s arms and tugging him lightly away. Draco had started to practically croon to the cauldron, telling it stories of Harry’s potions mishaps. “Maybe I’ll take back what I said about you not being crazy.”
“Oi,” Ron said lightly, shoving Harry to the side despite the fact he didn’t deny it.
Draco reached out, eyes still closed, hand encircling Harry’s wrist. “You said you’d read to me.” He was almost pouting. It made Harry’s heart clench.
and he had felt the rush of love from his parents, from everyone who had loved him who died, and known that he had to come back to the people who loved him who
going to be worth it. It had been just over a fortnight since the last tea and Harry had been very deliberate in the amount of time he had waited (exactly fourteen days) before sending an owl to Narcissa to ask about tea. He had come up with the exact right amount of time to wait with Ginny one night, the two of them sitting squished together on the Weasley’s sofa, everyone else upstairs in their own rooms. Harry didn’t know exactly what was happening anymore between the two of them — it was a shifting, headless monster that neither of them wanted to directly address at the minute. Instead of talking about it, they talked about other things or they drank or plotted how many days it would take for Malfoy to think that Harry had been bluffing.
Malfoy scowled but looked down at the table. He didn’t speak for a moment, clearly considering whatever he was going to say as he traced the grains of wood on the table with the hand that was not wrapped around his mug. Finally, Malfoy knocked his knuckles against the wood. “So was the job fair helpful?”
As he chewed, Narcissa started to talk again. In fact, Narcissa did most of the talking. Harry spoke mostly to her, answering questions, trying to dredge his own up. He didn’t know how to talk to Narcissa Malfoy: it wasn’t as if he could ask her how she felt about politics, or Voldemort, and asking ‘how’s the house arrest going’ was a kind of insensitive he knew to avoid. Conversation did not flow freely though Narcissa seemed to be listening to everything he said, even when Harry could hear himself trailing off.
“I’ve never thought that about you,” Harry said, opening the wine and starting to pour it into their glasses. “I’ve always thought you wanted to stop talking about a subject before it was battered to within an inch of its life.”
“I loathe you.”
Harry stood and made his way to the box. It led him past Narcissa and he made a point of nodding at her.
Ginny’s grin was quicksilver. “You’re the one who taught me all about that.” She stood quickly, almost bolting across the kitchen floor to him. She was much shorter than him and Harry liked that she had to lift herself up onto the tips of her toes to brush her mouth against his cheek. He liked that he could smell her perfume, citrus and sharp, twisting its way up into his senses. “I’ll be ten minutes.”
“Maybe,” Harry said to Malfoy, a few days later, as he walked up the lane, “I could become a healer.”
Draco’s note was in his hand.
“Do you want to stay for dinner?” Draco asked later, his hair brushed again, clothes straightened. He asked it casually, but his shoulders were stiff. He didn’t look at Harry, instead staring down at whatever he was writing.
Harry’s eyes crinkled at the corners as he muttered an apology that she waved aside. “It is serious, though,” he said. “I did mean it seriously. I do want to talk to you, if you’d talk to me.”
Harry blinked. Then he blinked again. Then he pulled a face. “Ron, this is Grimmauld Place.”
“You two are bastards,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Harry smiled. “And she asked me to.”
“I knew it was bothering him.”
“I didn’t ask you to come,” was the first thing out of his mouth.
“I’ve been thinking about the future,” he said finally, “and then I remembered you used to talk all the time about wanting to work with animals. And I think I want to. And I remember how much you used to love it, so I thought maybe you’d be able to — help me out? That sounds a bit selfish.”
, but I can’t stay here and have to do that every single day for the next year or two. I can’t sit around and do nothing and watch George blow things up and talk about Fred like that and just have everyone say that it’s
to. Haven’t I done enough?”
and that's the end!!! i wanted to say thank you again to everyone who read and enjoyed this!!! i was going to wait to post it and end it on my birthday but i figured...eh, i'll bung it up a couple of days early anyway, it's not like i'm going to have much time anyway.
“Annoying Malfoy and trying to find out if Narcissa Malfoy is a robot,” Harry said, with the ease of someone who had repeated that exact sentence up to two dozen times. Hermione’s mouth quirked upwards. “And like I said, it’s fine. If I was really sick, I’d stay. But I’m not. I’ll see you later.”
Malfoy looked sad. “No. No, of course not.” He sighed and then pushed himself off from the sink, taking a long step and coming to a stop in front of Harry. Malfoy held his gaze as he first pushed his shirt sleeves up and then rested a hand on Harry’s hip. His voice was low and secretive as he said, “I think very well of you, Potter, and I had thought that was abundantly clear. I can only gather it was not, for which I can only apologise. You’ve clearly felt comfortable enough to be
something to do and at the Malfoy’s, at least, no one was trying to congratulate Harry or tell him how grateful they were (much, anyway). No one was trying to draw him into reminiscing about the dead.
Malfoy stopped walking and, a moment later, Harry did too. He turned to look at the other boy, who had narrowed his eyes and looked torn between annoyed and amused. “Are you seriously trying to comfort me by saying house arrest isn’t all that bad, really, because you’re out in the real world being boring so obviously if I wasn’t locked up here I would be doing the same?”
Conversation flowed and ebbed and, finally, once her plate was cleared, Hermione said, “Harry, do you know what you’re doing with Malfoy?”
to describe as a coffee table, but the word didn’t do it justice. Even to Harry (hardly an expert) it looked expensive and old, the wood so dark it gleamed. There were two sofas around it and several armchairs, not one of which matched but which all screamed ‘I cost more than you could possibly imagine.’ Narcissa Malfoy sat on one of the sofas, a book in hand. As they entered, she calmly marked her place and looked at Malfoy for a moment before transferring her gaze to Harry.
Harry hummed in the back of his throat and sat back in his chair. He folded his arms over his chest, unconsciously mimicking Ron’s position in their earlier conversation, as he looked around the Malfoy kitchen. “I’m a questioning sort of person.”
Harry snorted. “It was fine, I think. I mean, I think they listened to me. You know?”
Harry shrugged and half-wished he hadn’t. The heavy rain outside meant his jacket was plastered to him and the movement made him feel chillier, more sodden, like he himself was an extension of a raindrop. Blighter’s disdainful look told him that the house elf was having a very trying day. He wondered what part of the property the elf had decided to tackle that day, but decided against asking. He’d learned the hard way.
“I’ve been bad at it lately. I keep having dreams I don’t like.”
Harry hated that he knew which one was the fourth greenhouse. He studied his reflection for another moment, wondering when he had become this person, and then he turned and tramped out onto the grounds. As he walked he had to keep reminding himself not to put his hands in his pockets and risk destroying the scones. As he walked, he tried not to dwell on Draco’s straight spine and the fact he had no idea what to say.
Jarred from his thoughts, Harry turned his attention to find Ron and Hermione facing him, twin looks of concern on their faces. He tried to feel irritated but found he could only muster apathy. “Yeah?”
“Right. Well, Harry, if you’ll follow me…”
Suddenly, Harry’s exhaustion tugged at him sharply and he was tumbling into darkness.
Harry snorted at the ridiculousness of that statement.
A flash of green, the soft thud of a body hitting the forest floor, a train station. Peace.
Towards the end, Ginny saw through him.
He didn't know when the world stopped having colour—the change was so gradual that he didn't even notice until it was too late. Mediwizards scrambled to find a cure for his sudden colour blindness but all came up empty-handed and apologetic. Ron and Hermione would give him worried smiles and sympathetic eyes and he wanted to scream and throw things but couldn't seem to muster the energy. Worst of all was Ginny, though he would rather not think about that.
She gave a small laugh at that and said, “They never do.”
“Please,” he was sobbing now, frantic. “Please,
Harry lowered his voice so only she could hear him. “Er, I need a refill on my Dreamless Sleep potions.”
it was their blood. His friends, his classmates, his mentors, his
Scrambling out of bed, Harry went to help him up, holding out his hand to him. Malfoy stared at the offered hand blankly for entirely too long.
Harry stared down at his own lifeless body. The forest around him was eerily bright and made his teeth feel on edge. He was flooded with a sense of urgency and bent down beside his own body.
He skipped class and spent the rest of the day in his bed, staring at the ceiling. He felt like an arsehole for not checking on Malfoy after his bout of accidental magic, even more so for doing it in the first place. Malfoy didn’t owe him anything and yet Harry felt irate when he recalled the complete detachment the other boy seemed to have to him. Maybe it was because Harry needed routine, consistency, in his life these days. What’s more consistent than Malfoy scowling at him and passing on barbed remarks?
people intruding on his personal business. Hermione had sworn up and down that hers was extremely professional and that he had helped her process through her trauma. Ginny had weekly sessions with the same one. Even Ron had tried half-heartedly to throw the idea out there once or twice. Harry had brushed them all off. As long as he kept the nightmares at bay, he did just fine. Mostly.
The flash of too many cameras, going through routine after routine, a thin smile and tight eyes. A mask slipping.
Harry refused several Mind Healers following the war; he didn’t need
Pushing away those thoughts, Harry gathered his study materials and headed for his dorm. He passed through the corridors at a sluggish pace . The portrait to his common room nudged open after he whispered the password and Harry shuffled inside; it was empty. The stairs were an obstacle in his state of mind but he carried on nonetheless. Dropping his pack gracelessly on the floor by his desk, Harry rummaged through his trunk, in search of a purple vial of Dreamless Sleep. He checked once, twice, three times before realizing he was completely out. Bile filled in his mouth at the thought of going without before he started running to the Infirmary.
He couldn’t help but return her smile with a small one of his own as he stepped out into the corridor. Of course, then he came face-to-face with Malfoy and he snapped his mask back into place. If Malfoy was bothered by Harry’s presence he didn’t let on, he didn’t even acknowledge that there was anyone in the room besides himself.
He grinned into the darkness and flopped back into his bed. He was just about to nod off when he remembered the altercation earlier that day. He felt guilt churn his stomach.
Everyone always seemed to want something from him. They wanted inspirational words, an unbroken man, someone to save them from the evils of the world. What if Harry was the one in need of saving?
the saviors of the bloody Wizarding World,” he mumbled in response.
“You’re not even wearing trousers,” Harry pointed out, helpfully.
He snapped back to awareness, realizing he must've drifted off at some point. Blearily looking around to check he was still alone—he was—he cast a quick
He tried to catch whoever was leaving him these small gifts but no one was ever around to claim credit. At first, he suspected Hermione; she had voiced her concerns about his lack of appetite and noted the loose fit of his uniform. Of course, this led to an appalled twenty minute lecture on consuming foods from unknown sources without properly verifying their safety—
Finally,
That seemed to turn the gears in the other boy’s brain, scowling at Harry before getting up on his own. “I would rather eat my own trousers.”
Harry remembered when the sound of a train chugging along filled him with a sense of home—of belonging; when he would look out the windows with wide eyes and a smile of wonder tugging at his lips. He used to love watching the rolling green hills fly by, watching the sky go from a pale blue to vibrant oranges and purples to an inky black. Watching the water outside ripple and reflect the moods of the sky and the dances of the trees filled him with a sense of awe and amazement.
She quickly collected herself and finished restocking her cupboards before approaching him, less frazzled than before. “Now, dear,” she began. “What seems to be the trouble?”
She gave him a dazzling smile. “Just Evania.”
Harry took up nearly permanent residence in the library during meal hours. His only saving grace from the dull study sessions were the little treats that almost always popped into existence at the edge of his table—always with a napkin, though not with his initials anymore.
Harry grunted, nudging past the other boy. Malfoy seemed to shake himself and avert his eyes. Without a word, he stomped off into the washroom and closed the door with more force than strictly necessary.
“Vitiligo,” she explained when she caught his curious stare. “I presume you’re Mr. Potter?”
Boot was an alright bloke, as far as Harry recalled, a Ravenclaw with high marks.
Harry woke to a gurgling screaming noise and hands clutching at his shoulders. He kept his eyes squeezed shut and focused on controlling his breathing. When he finally felt calm enough to take stock, the burning in his throat made him realize the screams were coming from him. The hands clutching his shoulders relaxed minutely and Harry opened his eyes to see Malfoy staring back at him, shaken.
Harry and Ron trudged up the short staircase to the right and Hermione broke away to the left. They passed a handful of doors before Ron stopped abruptly, his mouth agape. Harry peered at the plaque on the door, a sense of dread creeping up his throat.
Ron shot him a look as if to say
Pushing that train of thought away with a shake of his head, he attempted to refocus on his Arthmancy assignment. He had begged off lunch for the third time this week to take advantage of the deserted library—Madam Pince was usually good at keeping his
Hermione seemed to flush at that as she shot a glare at Ron. With a huff, she turned her attention back on Harry, a look of determination stealing her expression.
Malfoy snatched his hands back as if the touch burned and took a trembling step backward, only to trip and fall on his arse.
next time.”
People were pulled towards him like he was the sun, their eyes were grateful but their hands were greedy. They grabbed at his robes and clawed desperately at his skin. He tried to play it off with his Savior Mask firmly in place but the panic made his heart stutter and his breath come in short gasps. Harry had so many shadows these days, he couldn't tell which was his own.
“Goodnight, Potter.”
“Oi! Harry!”
“There is no shame in needing help, Harry,” she said, her voice low enough not to carry. “Now, be on your way!”
Endless memorials, a trial to speak at, losses on every side. Grief.
Healer Evania nodded in understanding. “I imagine you would. Well, we will focus on those to begin with when we start our weekly sessions on Monday afternoon.” She checked her watch and started to stand up. “I hate to end this consultation but we ran over for time and I have another student waiting outside to see me.”
“Wake up!” he screamed, shaking his own limp shoulders with all of the force he could muster. His body didn’t wake up, didn’t blink, didn’t
Another chapter for you! I hope to keep up with the weekly updates.
Harry heard a muffled curse and sheets shifting around.
Still, anticipating whatever treat would magically appear before him quickly became his favorite time of the day. Which sounded fucking depressing.
When Harry first awoke in the forest after dying, he didn’t realize something was wrong; he was focused on the battle and trying to save the people he loved. After the adrenaline started to fade, a gnawing feeling started in his chest. Everything around him looked stilted, off-kilter, and he couldn’t figure out why. Skies looked duller, lights seemed dimmer, and his reflection was haunted. The feeling grew and grew and
He gasped and choked on their blood and sunk deeper and deeper until all he could do was let it claim him. He deserved this.
“What is it now?”
Harry shrugged in response, feeling embarrassed. “Dunno.”
Harry felt his gaze unfocus and his thoughts wander off as she launched into another debate with Ron. He loved them—he really did—but he felt smothered in their presence sometimes. Seeing the hope in their eyes and the secretive glances they share left him feeling choked and panicked. The clawing inside of him would rip at his chest, leaving him open and exposed. They’re just like everyone else in Harry’s life—they expect too much out of him. Promises of the future, of healing, seemed to fill them with optimism, determination,
Harry gathered his things and went to leave. She walked with him and clasped his hand in a friendly handshake. “Monday, 3 o’clock. I’ll see you then, Harry.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep, gasping breath in and then slowly blew it out, imagining the smoke leaving him. He repeated this until the buzzing faded and the choking feeling passed. Several minutes–or hours–passed before he could finally open his eyes. When he did, the healer was back in her chair and scribbling a few notes into his file.
Harry felt naked, exposed, when he thought of the way her eyes pierced through his dutiful expression when he gave her affection. He remembered the last day, too.
—he was dumbfounded. The portrait, a stocky man with a thick mustache and glittering eyes, swung open and revealed a cozy common room. Harry’s shock multiplied tenfold when he chanced a glance behind himself and found the Eight Years from the other houses trailing behind him. A flash of white in his peripheral told him that Malfoy was among them. He stiffened and faced back toward the common room, shuffling inside. This must’ve been part of the “inter-house unity” McGonagall mentioned at the Welcome Feast.
“Malfoy?” he whispered, hoping the other boy could hear him.
“Well, we
, it was time to head to their dorms for the night and get settled. Harry trudged after the other returning Eighth Years in his house, tiredness seeping into his bones and making each step sluggish. He wasn’t paying attention as they navigated the corridors so when they reached an unfamiliar portrait and Hermione announced the password—
“No,” he answered honestly. Hesitating, he added, “Just get nightmares without the potion.”
He could tell Evania. He trusted her for some reason and thought maybe she would have some type of explanation as to why his brain was so broken.
“Was it because I mentioned a psychological evaluation?” she pressed.
It’s not like he was starving himself on purpose or anything and he noticed that his belt had to be tightened two extra notches—he just lacked the motivation to take care of himself. He couldn’t even gather the energy to shower, casting a strong
His stomach grumbled threateningly. He sent up a silent prayer to Merlin himself that it wasn’t dosed with poison—or worse, love potion—and shoved it in his mouth before jogging to class.
“Maybe he’ll rub off on you,” he suggested. “Reckon you’ll get an O in potions before the end of term.”
She whirled out before he could process anything and Harry numbly headed back to his dorm.
Moments later, Ron returned, hunched over and gulping the air. “Terry,” he gasped, “Boot.”
Pomfrey returned to find him tugging at his hair in frustration. Her expression softened into an uncomfortable understanding as she handed him a parchment with a time and place scrawled across it.
Classes began and the trio fell into a steady routine: go to class, go to meals, study, sleep, repeat. Harry liked routines, they helped him maintain an illusion of stability in his otherwise chaotic life. If he seemed as withdrawn and lethargic as he felt, no one mentioned it.
Harry noticed the way Malfoy moved about the castle–shoulders drawn in, eyes straight ahead, pretending to be smaller than he was. His clothes were still poncy as ever; he wore elegant black robes with a fancy silver clasp that glinted as he slunk through the corridors. His hair fell in loose waves just past his chin and he looked less and less like his father everyday. Other returning students muttered insults under their breath as they passed by him but he didn’t ever react.
“Er, just Harry.”
churned something deep inside of him that left an unsettled lump in his gut. He desperately wanted to be happy for them but each shared look, each private joke, each stolen kiss, twisted the searing hot knife lodged in his chest.
Hermione and Ron shared a glance before turning toward Harry with amused, secretive smiles. “Mate, seems our house colours are black and white,” Ron said, a grin spreading across his face.
Harry thought bitterly.
Responsibilities, a return, red and green clashing. Victory.
As for his Malfoy situation, he hardly ever saw the prat. He avoided common areas as much as possible and would retire to bed long after Harry succumbed to sleep. He seemed to rise earlier than Harry as well, his sheets meticulously made like he never bothered to meander to bed at all—and maybe he didn't. Harry didn't care. Still, something twisted deep inside of him when the other boy passed in the corridors and let his eyes slide right through him, like he didn't exist.
on himself every morning, like clockwork. It wasn’t as satisfying but it was the best he could do in his current state.
killing me.
Maybe Harry should’ve said something to them, the war is over after all. But, he lived in his own world with his own problems and just couldn’t be bothered. He guessed he couldn’t blame Malfoy for pretending he didn’t exist, when Harry did the exact same to him.
of us,” she began, casting another glare at Ron who let out an undignified grunt in response, “are thinking about our futures beyond the castle. How can you possibly hope to become an Auror if you don’t take your studies seriously?”
Trying to conjure some type of feeling at seeing his former rival sat in the hall where his friends fought and were killed, he just felt hollow. Malfoy caught his eye and quickly looked away, frowning before his expression morphed into the mirror of Harry’s own—disconnected, blank.
Still, remembering the flash of red light that whipped out from his fingertips needled away at him. Why did he see colour then but now his vision had returned to the bleak greys he’d grown used to? He’d have to talk to Hermione about it, though that would bring about stern looks and a reprimanding he no doubt deserved but would rather avoid anyway.
wake up.” He was running out of time.
“Sorry,” he rasped, “about what happened in the corridor. I didn’t mean to.”
Admiring gazes and frenzied cameras followed him everywhere, so he created a mask. He forced a smile onto his face and gave the Wizarding World what they wanted—a hero. Though, he didn’t feel much like one when he recalled Tonks, Remus, Collin, or
until he simply felt nothing, empty,
Sometimes, Harry couldn’t recall what colours used to look like. The world past his eyes had been muddied in black and white for months now and he’d lost any hopes of getting it back. He tried to conjure up images of expansive green meadows in his mind but his head was filled with the bleeding grey of the Forbidden Forest.
Seeing a colour for a split second for the first time in months sent Harry into a shock and he did the only thing he could think of–he bolted.
Now, looking out the window of the train left him bitter and numb. He scowled at the greyscale scenery whipping by. The trees blurred together in blacks and dark greys, the sky was drained of all vibrancy, and the water rippled into nothingness.
honestly
Harry found his trunk at the foot of the bed on the left and rifled through it until he found a vial of Dreamless Sleep. He cast a strong locking spell at his trunk and toed off his trainers before he unstoppered the vial and downed its contents. Tossing his glasses on the bedside table and warding his curtains shut after he climbed into bed, Harry let the abyss claim him.
She looked up from her notes and gave him a warm smile. “You never have to apologize to me, especially for something like that. Panic attacks can be quite intense and I’m honestly impressed that you pulled yourself out of it so quickly.”
The Great Hall filled with excited chatter as McGonagall's beginning of term speech drew to a close. Harry tuned her out as she went on about grief, acceptance, and inter-house unity. First Years were quickly sorted into one of the four houses, each celebrating amongst their friends, though the Slytherins remained more subdued. Harry’s eyes swept through the crowded room, barely registering the shades of grey that met his eyes. His gaze fixed on the end of the Slytherin table, where one student sat away from the others, seemingly disinterested in the goings on. Draco Malfoy.
“Mr. Potter! Need I remind you that we house the sick and injured here? A bit of common courtesy goes quite a long way!” There was a younger boy in the bed next to her spouting green fur everywhere that looked towards Harry with wide, doe eyes. Pomfrey pulled his curtain around with such force the rod rattled.
He swallowed past the dryness in his throat and pushed into his room. It was considerably smaller than his old dorm. There were two four-poster beds with dark sheets and curtains, the lone window directly between them. Two desks were pushed against opposite walls and there was an open door leading to a small washroom.
Harry gulped down a breath and pulled at his hair again. Ginny’s gaze flickered up to his hands and then back. They kept staring at each other, both of them breathing harshly, and then Harry heard himself say, “If that’s what you want then.”
“I didn’t know we had an old project.”
you?” She looked at Ron with wide eyes. “I thought you were maybe going to fight! I thought maybe one of us would have to come collect you and maybe help cover up some kind of broken nose scenario. Then I thought maybe you were going through a crisis.”
Malfoy was lying on the bed, a book on his lap. He looked up as Harry stood in the doorway of the en suite, towel in hand. Harry felt unbearably awkward and Malfoy looked tired. They regarded each other.
It was a long piece of music. It seemed to go on and on, minute after minute ticking by. Harry didn’t mind. He sat with his head on Draco’s shoulder, watching him play, listening to him breathe. If he could have this, he thought that would be enough. If this was all he ever got for the rest of his life, maybe it would be enough.
“You’re an idiot. Come here.” Harry went easily. The gallery was long so it took him longer than he would have liked to reach Draco and then he sank down beside him. He tugged at the book in Draco’s hand and Draco relinquished it easily, but Harry returned it almost immediately. It was about the history of healing potions and it wasn’t that Harry didn’t think that was useful — it was just ridiculously boring and he would rather have plucked his eyes out than read it. Draco smiled fondly at him.
“God damn it,” Harry muttered, kicking at the ground with his feet.
“She’s not for you.” Harry smoothed a hand over Yolanda’s fur even as she nosed forward, sniffing at Malfoy. Her tail wagged so ferociously that it hurt when it hit against Harry’s leg but he just smiled at her. “She’s my neighbour’s. Well, Hermione’s neighbours but I’m looking after her dogs while they’re both away.”
Ron tilted his head. “You know what? I don’t know. I’ve been sitting here thinking about it the whole time I’ve been here.”
Malfoy groaned into Harry’s mouth and Harry grinned. He felt Malfoy smile back, the curve of his smile pressing against Harry’s mouth, and Harry pulled back to kiss along it, grinding down again.
Hermione leaned forward to make sure Harry could see her roll her eyes. “He’s being modest,” she said, glancing from Harry to Ron. She made sure to stop eating as she talked. “They were listening to every word. I’ve been reading about the current Wizengamot and even Bartleby Whethers was paying attention!” She looked at them significantly. In return, Harry and Ron exchanged their own significant looks, trying and failing not to smile.
Harry laughed delightedly and pushed himself up and off the counter, landing with a thump which got him a disdainful look. He walked over to Malfoy’s cauldron and looked down into it. “Look’s bubbling.”
It was a hungry kiss, all teeth at first and then they were pulling at each other, hands grasping. Draco bit at his bottom lip and demanded entry; Harry yielded and laughed into his mouth. “Shut up, Potter,” he growled, hands hard on Harry’s hips as he pulled him forward. Harry couldn’t respond because he was too busy tumbling into a kiss he wanted to live in.
Harry took a sharp breath in. “No, of course not.” He felt his own face twisting into a mockery of a sneer. “Already a pretty low opinion, huh?”
Narcissa had sounded slightly doubtful and Harry decided he couldn’t leave that alone. “No, I mean it. I don’t want thanks. I don’t want you to feel like you owe me or anything. It doesn’t matter to me. I just genuinely — I’m just really grateful for what you did and I meant what I said in court, you know? I don’t think you deserve to be punished again and again, without taking into account what you did to help either.” Harry shrugged. He sat on his hands so he didn’t start picking at his nails or biting them.
“Liar.” Harry pushed himself off the doorframe and walked to side down in a seat at the table opposite Draco. “Tell the truth.”
“Naff off,” Harry said fondly, clipping Ron with his elbow as he reached for the tea. “I’m just thinking about it.”
At first, Harry did not, in fact, see. Following breakfast on Saturday, Ron blindfolded Harry and then apparated the two of them, telling Harry with his special brand of easy confidence that he just needed to trust him. Harry did trust Ron but that didn’t quite stop the curl of apprehension which lay in the pit of his stomach, hard and cool. When his feet touched the ground he had to tell himself it was important not to rip the blindfold right off. Instead, he let his friend lead him forward a few paces before Ron ripped Harry’s blindfold off, proclaiming “Ta-dah!”
Harry squared his shoulders and walked up to the gate. Again, it sprang open. Again, Harry was struck by the disarray of the garden. He walked slowly up the lane leading to the front door, already anticipating knocking for a good few minutes (this time, he had built that into when he arrived) but halfway up the lane, the front door was flung open. Harry watched as Malfoy tore through the front door and down towards Harry. He was glad to notice that, this time, Malfoy was wearing shoes.
He still emphatically did not understand either Malfoy, however Harry was becoming increasingly sure that he barely understood himself. Every time he apparated outside the manor without asking, he was surprised. Every time, he told himself he was going to consider it deeper, maybe engage in some self-reflection. Harry had not managed to do anything approaching it.
“How long did you sleep?” he asked.
Ron groaned. “Mate, no, I know. I was giving us both a chance there to ignore it.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, smiling. He fisted a hand in Harry’s t-shirt again and pulled him forward, kissing him and kissing him and kissing him. Harry let himself be thoroughly kissed.
They were so close that when Draco swallowed Harry almost felt it. “Harry, please,” he said, soft, pleading.
“I mean it, though.” Ron put his fork down, reaching to hold her hand. “I’m so fucking glad we’re all here. This is loads better than last year. And next year will be even better. And we’re always going to just do whatever you want on your birthday, because we love you, and we’re always going to be together.”
Draco shifted just slightly but never missed a beat. Harry watched his fingers move up and down the keys of the piano, fascinated as always and slowly, ever so slowly, rested his head against Draco’s shoulder. He heard his intake of breath, quick and sharp, but Draco kept playing.
“Liar.” Harry turned to look at the bubbling cauldrons and said, “How many of these are time sensitive?”
“We’ll get our stuff moved out,” Harry said, tentatively, and Hermione shook her head.
, Potter! I hate salami! Begone, salami!” and then threw the sandwich into the fire.
The meeting had been requested a few days before, the invitation coming with an owl that had woken Harry up from what Hermione had taken to calling his “depression afternoon nap.” She said it with a twist of her mouth, a laugh that almost crawled out of her but didn’t quite. He had briefly wondered if it was a criticism but ultimately brushed the uncharitable thought away. She called Ron’s naps the same and had excused herself for one more than one.
Shrugging, Malfoy said, “I’m good at it. Make the tea, Potter.”
upsetting!”
“Watch me, Potter,” Draco declared, taking off in the other direction. Harry counted to five and ran after him, laughter as bright as the sun spilling from him. When he caught up to Draco, he grabbed him around the waist and threw him to the ground, straddling him as he declared himself the winner of everything. Draco scowled and looked aggrieved and pulled Harry down to kiss him hard enough that it left Harry more breathless than the running.
“With me?”
Malfoy sniffed. “Don’t be so ridiculous, Potter.” Still, he turned his hand so his palm was against Harry’s and stared down at it. “You just have to not ask stupid questions.” He seemed to hear himself and then frowned, “Or we can work on the language thing, I suppose.”
It tugged desperately in his chest but Harry had other things to say. His hand went to Draco’s chest, palm flat against it and he shoved him lightly. He was careful to do it away from the cauldrons. Harry might not know that much about potions but he wasn’t
“I am not having a crisis.”
Blighter opened the door to the piano room, announced Harry, even though there was no need as he was already in the room and then said, “I shall leave the two of you, but Master Malfoy I’m afraid that I must inform you that Mr Potter clearly does not know who Maleficent Mongoose is.”
Ron sighed. “Yeah, I know! But I’ve got it all set up. Hermione helped, of course — she’s going to be along later, she had to go and pick up some studying stuff — but every room has something else we thought you might be interested in. And it’s all sort of practical stuff. I mean, we kind of had to bandy our names around a bit, but there’s someone here who plays Quidditch, and there’s a Healer, because Hermione said you were talking about it that time. And then there’s a couple of other things we thought maybe you would be interested in, like we’ve got a broommaker in too and Bill got one of his cursebreaker friends in. It’s pretty cool.” Ron had been bouncing on the back of his heels, gesturing from one room to another as he talked or pointing up the stairs, his excitement obvious, but then he looked at Harry and took a deep breath. “I mean, it’s whatever.”
but they had helped him and they had each other. Harry had thought very little of them but the sight had played on him for a long time afterwards. It was the love they had for each other. It had been bewildering to think about at first. Now, he was glad they had at least.
Harry did not think that was true and he thought Malfoy should know that. “That’s not true,” he said.
Harry found he didn’t know what to say. He didn’t talk to Draco about his father. He hated the subject, tried to pull away from it as much as possible. Harry wasn’t sure whether he had it in him to be understanding. Draco had told him once that that was okay but Harry hadn’t wanted to press it. “He seems to really care about his dad.”
Then, because he could fidget even if Malfoy couldn’t, he stuck his thumb nail into his mouth and bit down on it. The noise was too loud and Hermione cut a glance at him, making a disapproving noise in the back of her throat. “Stop biting your nails,” she hissed.
“Did you do it?” Harry asked, because it was a question he knew how to ask and it was easier than trying to pull apart what he really wanted to say.
“About a month later.”
“Now who’s a liar?” Draco said, snorting.
It worked, sometimes. It worked the morning Lucius’ verdict was delivered (Azkaban) and didn’t worked the morning of Narcissa’s. Harry dressed soberly for court, trying to lose himself in monotonous tasks. Brushing his teeth, his hair, picking socks. He realised he was going too far when he was staring at his feet, eyes unfocused and unseeing, mind lingering on memories of the forest as he tried to put his right foot into his left shoe.
“Potter, I said I was heading for the stupor. You’re simply not allowed to go first.”
All he ever wanted was this.
There was silence as Harry turned some of the vegetables, the only sound the faint shouting from the next door neighbour’s children as they ran around their garden. Harry grinned just hearing it and Ron sighed and then said, “After the, you know. Sex.”
Settling into a routine without Hermione proved weird. For a few days, Harry tried to establish one of his own. Ron, technically, still lived in the Burrow, but spent most of his time in Hermione’s house. He got up at the same time every morning and it woke Harry up. They shared breakfast and Ron would leave for Auror training, while Harry would leave to visit Mrs Ormsby’s dogs. It turned out she had many of them: a German shepherd, who needed a lot of exercise, several Westie’s, who needed a bit less, and a pair of labradors, one of whom was very active while the other seemed incredibly averse to moving. Harry started to take the dogs when he went on a run. He would stay with them for a while and then take off. He started to volunteer, picking different charities, trying to find something to fill his time with.
When he reached the door, Harry stared at the large knocker for longer than it really warranted. It was huge, in the shape of a bird which could have been a swan or possibly a peacock — t was hard to tell when half of it had been blasted away, probably from a stray Death Eater’s curse. Harry reached for it and knocked.
“I’m always running away from you,” Draco said, which was such a huge lie from someone who was currently trying to mould their bodies together. Harry laughed and opened the door to Draco’s bedroom, hurrying through the front chamber to get to the back. Draco made a gleeful noise when he saw the bed and flung himself onto it, curling into a comma.
“We’ve faith in your heart, mate,” Ron said.
“I don’t want you to say a single smug thing,” Draco had said and Harry had shrugged and said he wouldn’t. He had instead bided his time, waited until Draco looked happy and flushed, sending candles floating around some of the trees outside and
“Yeah, all right,” Ron said, after a minute. “I mean, my snogging buddy just left for the other side of the world and yours is only under house arrest.”
“Too bad! I’m here too! You’ve got me!” Malfoy’s eyes were huge and wild.
There was a beat and then Malfoy said, “Yes. I can tell that by your outfit.”
of Harry smiling as he walked down Diagon Alley, his hands sunk into his pockets, the wind ruffling his hair. Harry looked at picture-Harry making eye contact with the photographer and realised that the smile didn’t even completely disappear even then.
“No!” Hermione’s hands were windmilling around her, every gesture huge. “I just knew something was! I suspected it! I was telling Ron but I — he
, but I refuse to take it lying down.”
Draco’s war with his worst instincts was taking place in front of Harry’s face. He could feel Draco’s heartbeat fluttering and felt the tremble in his body that meant Draco was telling himself not to move. His nostrils flared and his eyes narrowed and despite it all he said, curtly, “Fine. Move your hand, Harry.”
There was no way this was going to work if he let Malfoy do that.
“I’ve decided to say thank you,” Malfoy announced, loudly, and sounding as stiff as a corpse. “I recognise and appreciate that this should have come before now, but the atmosphere in the Manor really is oppressive and I decided I didn’t want to cope with it.” A brief pause and then he added reluctantly, “And you startled me.”
“Harry, no. You’re family. You live here. I’ll explain it.”
“Well, you going to tell me all about it then, or do I have to tempt it out of you?”
The sense of calm that descended over Harry after he made his decision lasted until he told other people about it. Hermione asked him over and over again a litany of questions, composed of the liturgy: was he sure? Did he want to take some extra time? Did he want to make another list? She was quick to stress that she supported him, but she just wanted him to be
“Do you know what you’re doing? Are you sure? Are you happy?” Hermione had the ability to look intense very quickly and she looked it now, wide, assessing eyes fixed on him. “We’re not — Ron has been telling me, but I wanted all of us to talk about it.”
Harry tilted his head and studied Malfoy for a moment. Malfoy was still avoiding his gaze. Harry didn’t really think he deserved that, but then he didn’t really know how Malfoy felt. He took a breath and a leap and covered Malfoy’s hand with his. Immediately, the remaining tension in Malfoy’s shoulders disappeared. “Maybe you can just answer my questions straightforwardly?” Harry suggested, with a smile.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Malfoy shouted. He must have been practically screeching it, for Harry to hear him. After an internal debate that lasted barely a moment, Harry continued walking. “Potter, I asked you a question!”
Harry was trying extremely hard not to smile. He could tell it was failing. “I’m being punished? But I’m making you breakfast.”
on cupcakes or not.”
“A friend,” Ginny said, almost sneering. She was gripping tightly to Harry’s hand. It was the same kind of punishment his heart was eeking out to him, a deathgrip that felt like it was going to wreck him. “You want a friend who you can kiss sometimes and not feel bad about it. I don’t want that, Harry. I’ve had enough of waiting around.”
Today, it appeared as if Narcissa Malfoy had something she wished to discuss. She was sitting only slightly forward but watching him intently, the cup of tea floating by her elbow untouched. She waited until after Harry had drank some of his own before saying, “You will, of course, forgive me for asking, but I am curious about your returning visitations.”
“Should’ve got more,” Ron said, sagely. He did not take another bite right away, but instead looked at the cupcake in his hand. “D’you reckon if my parents had been mad and followed some bizarre megalomaniac that we would have had cupcakes like this?” He sounded wistful and dreamy.
“Look at me, Draco.”
“Somewhere terrible, for sure,” Draco said, grabbing for Harry’s hand, pulling him along with him. He turned and stared at the large foyer of the manor, shaking his head, looking at Harry from the corner of his eye. “I don’t know what to do now,” he said shyly.
Harry’s mouth quirked upwards. Sometimes, Malfoy spoke like a normal person and sometimes his breeding reared its particular aristocratic head. “Nothing you say is going to scare me away, Malfoy.” Harry sunk his hands into his pockets as they came to a stop by what Malfoy had once called the “best water feature.” It both amused and perplexed Harry that there could be enough water features in the garden to have a best one, although he found he couldn’t deny it was pretty great. Water cascaded down a wall covered in ivy, pooling into a red bricked basin below. It was huge and wide and although it wasn’t a pond, it wasn’t far off. Around the edges of the water was another red-bricked wall. Malfoy leaned over and dragged a hand across the water, causing ripples to dance out from his fingertips. He looked into its surface and then up at Harry. The sun bounced off the top of the water and Harry had to squint to make Malfoy’s face out, set and determined.
A smile spread across Harry’s face, slow as treacle and just as sickly sweet. “But, Malfoy,” he said, innocently, “I’ve already caught you out. You’re practically purple with annoyance.”
“Look, Ron, you don’t have to come, honestly. You can stay out here and wait for us. It means a lot that you brought us lunch, even.” Harry folded his arms. “I don’t want to spoil my testimony but it’s not because we’re friends, and it’s not because I think he’s going to start healing the sick and tending to the needy if I make sure he doesn’t go down forever for this. I just wouldn’t be able to sit around and say nothing and let them lock him up when I don’t think he deserves that.”
had been in the cards for him a few years prior he would have laughed himself sick. It hadn’t felt as funny when he was staring at the words on paper, thinking about her whispering in his ear, of telling Voldemort that he was dead.
section of the garden was just right for it. The ground rolled out beneath Harry’s feet, grass that was lush and green and carried out onto the horizon. There were stables not too far off. The sight of them nearly made Harry feel a bit ill. If he had to watch Malfoy show off by talking about his prize horses he was going to turn back and vomit in the rose bushes.
Instantly, Draco turned bright red. It was like looking at Ron. He stood up fast and cleared his throat. “I have to go to the bathroom.”
Harry’s visits to Malfoy Manor were irregular but not infrequent. Ever since Malfoy had sent the owl to Harry and his subsequent morning visit, the silent embargo against visiting any time other than exactly three p.m. in the afternoon was lifted. He did not always send word that he was appearing either, which started by accident and then became something of a habit.
“It’s not like that,” Harry said, immediately. “It’s not —- you can’t see anything because —”
“You didn’t even last the twenty minutes,” Harry said, gesturing towards the countdown clock.
“I don’t know. That was just a very long depression nap yesterday.” Hermione was clearly trying to sound normal, her voice lilting in the way it usually did when she was teasing him, but the tone was not quite right. Harry didn’t look at her as he laced his shoes up.
can say that, can’t you? Of course you can say that! You don’t know! You don’t know!” He had turned into a flurry of motion again, flinging his body around the kitchen. There were so many cauldrons set up now that it probably put any Hogwarts potions class to shame. They bubbled away, a merry chorus underscoring just how desperate and frantic Draco looked. He wove through the cauldrons, staring at all of them with a pained look on his face. Harry stepped forward, dropping the shopping bag onto the table.
Immediately, Hermione reached out, wrapping her hand over his and squeezing it. “That’s not what I meant,” she said sharply. “Of course it’s weird, though. You know it’s weird. But we know you and we trust you and Malfoy’s wrote to each of us quite a bit, actually.”
“They didn’t have to. It was really good of them. They basically told Ron he could just bring them back whenever and that’d be fine.” Harry’s grin was huge and boyish, directed towards first Narcissa and then Malfoy — Draco — who were both sitting in the library. They shared a look and then glanced back at him.
” Harry heard himself shout. He cleared his throat and repeated, “Stop picking a fight. It’s not that simple. If — if you didn’t think there was something wrong with the way
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Harry’s shoulders drew up towards his ears.
“You’re intolerable,” Draco said, miserably. “I hate you so much. You annoy me constantly.”
“I’ll get you to sign a contract next time.”
Having mostly tackled the hallway (Walburga would have to be dealt with after), Harry had decided that it was probably best to go to the kitchen. He loved Hermione’s kitchen; he loved the Weasley’s; he loved Hogwarts’. He wanted to love the kitchen of the house he owned, wanted to see parts of his own heart reflected back at him.
Harry, frozen for only a split moment in time, rubbed his hand up and down Malfoy’s back again. “Okay,” he muttered into Malfoy’s hair. “Then it’s time to go to bed, Malfoy, yeah?”
“I’m happy if you’re changing,” he said, pouring whiskey slowly into the glass. “That’s all anyone ever asks for, right? New beginnings and the ability to transform.”
“Don’t want anything that was his in my room,” George said finally, once the silence had stretched for too long.
The next time he visited the Malfoy’s, Malfoy himself was there, once more meeting Harry outside the front door. He stood there, watching Harry carefully, hair shining in the late summer sunlight, his arms crossed over his chest. Harry raised a hand in greeting. “Loved the bun, Malfoy,” he said brightly. Malfoy scowled. “It was great — Ron and I split it.” As he passed the other boy, Harry reached out to clap him on the shoulder.
He looked at Blighter and smiled at the same time Narcissa said, “That will be all, Blighter, thank you.”
“I gathered,” Draco said, clearly trying to sound unaffected. He couldn’t; his voice was husky and raw, scraping against Harry’s ears. It made him smile, but Draco wasn’t looking directly at him and missed it.
There was a brief pause as Malfoy stared at him. A frown appeared between his eyebrows before it was on his mouth, his thin lips twisting downwards. He looked confused and alarmed at the same time.
“Don’t lie.”
Red as his hair, Ron shrugged. “Just a bit — people were falling over themselves, actually, to help. When we said what it was for.”
Harry frowned. “How do you mean? Are there visitors?”
Ron looked kind as he leaned forward, reaching out to pat Harry’s arm. “No, of course you did,” he said, in the same tone of voice Harry had heard mothers adopt with children. It made a laugh rise in his chest and he leaned back, arms crossed over his chest.
Harry was making his own pasta when Ron crashed through the door, muddy boots still on, a smudge of blood high on his cheekbone and a toothy grin on his face. Harry stopped kneading for a split second, blinking at him, and then started again. “Shoes off, mate.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s nice. You could get it for her, definitely.”
Both Narcissa and Harry turned to look at Malfoy. Harry saw his surprise mirrored in Narcissa’s face before she hid most of it away. In contract, he was completely unable to hide his own shock, his mouth falling open as he blinked continuously at Malfoy. Malfoy looked at him for a second, a muscle in his jaw twitching, before he made eye contact with his mother again. Narcissa and Malfoy kept staring at each other for what felt like an eternity while Harry stood and tried to stop himself from gaping like a fish.
Draco shook his head. “Nothing important. It doesn’t matter.”
They kept talking, lulls and echoes of previous conversation, trying to claw their way towards some normality that seemed far off. When Hermione said goodbye, mindful of the time, telling Ron to go straight to bed he promised he would. Still, when the call cut off both boys tumbled backwards, backs against the coffee table staring into the fire.
He supposed they were. Malfoy certainly seemed to view them as precious; it was clear from the light in his eyes, the way he swept his gaze across them. They were quiet as they walked down the pathway, Malfoy letting his fingers drag slightly in hip height bushes. There had been blackberries glinting from them just a few months ago and they had picked them off as they passed, eating them as they walked. Harry missed it. He thought maybe Malfoy did too.
Malfoy frowned at him, furrowing his brow deeply, before looking down at his own feet. “Yes, bravo, wonderful job those specs are doing there, Potter.” He sounded sour. “It’s rude to wear shoes indoors. Take yours off if you’re coming in.”
He was almost at the front door when it was flung open. Harry paused for barely a second, threw his shoulders back and walked closer.
Draco opened one eye blearily and smiled at Harry. “I lied. Like twelve hours.”
Harry lifted his head. “My name’s not Harmond. That’s not a name.”
“You were perfectly capable of telling me what to do last year,” she said. Said, calmly and levelly, like the shouting a moment before had been a blip. “You were perfectly capable of making decisions over and over again, which didn’t only affect you. So I want your input. I want you to tell me what you want.”
Harry shrugged, mustering a smile as he wandered over to where he had kicked off his shoes the night before and shoved his feet into them. “Yeah, I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?”
Narcissa laughed. “No, that’s quite all right. You don’t need to share such things with me.”
fuck off, Potter. As if I’d trust you to do this.” He shoved at Harry lightly but he was still laughing, head thrown back, the line of his throat exposed. Some of the colour reappeared in Draco’s cheeks. “You’re literally useless. I’ve never met anyone more useless than you.”
Groaning, Draco said, “I hate you so much it makes my insides hurt.”
“Potter, don’t be ridiculous. I simply can’t talk to you without some proper fresh air to clear my head.” Malfoy did not look at him once. Instead, he wrenched open the heavy gate in the back wall and, completely unable to stay still, Harry followed him.
had wanted to do this for him. That he had taken so much time and effort and tried to think of things that Harry would want to do. Harry felt something swell within him and he swallowed around a lump in his throat. “Ron, this was a lot of effort.”
“We could have one, though,” Harry supplied, helpfully. Hermione turned a sharp look on him as Ron groaned. “I mean, only when Ron comes over obviously. Two people don’t make much of a club.”
“We survived a war,” Ginny said, raising her eyebrows. “A lot of build up, then a war, then a lot of funerals and a lot of trials. I think we deserve to be able to drink in the morning.”
“I’m refraining from passing judgement,” Hermione said.
Sometimes, Malfoy crowded Harry against the kitchen cupboards, or the corner of the room, or any available surface and buried his hands in Harry’s hair, peppering kisses along the side of his jaw and kissing Harry until they were breathless.
They didn’t talk about it in the morning but Harry felt lighter.
“I still wrote back.”
Hermione looked at him with bright eyes, pride shining out of her face so obviously that Harry had to duck his head and consider his tea. He’d made it a bit too milky, he realised, but it was an adequate enough distractor — or so he thought anyway. When he looked back up, Hermione still had that look on her face and Ron had a variation of it too. It was slightly more restrained on Ron’s face but he leaned forward, thumping Harry hard on the shoulder.
“All right,” he said, first to Yolanda and then to Malfoy. “All right, then, I’m doing this first. Want to come for a walk with me? I’m asking you to. I was kind of a jerk and I want to apologise.”
They sat, letting the soft strains of the radio station’s jazz drift towards them, filling the silence. It was comfortable and quiet and Harry felt content. Running a finger around the rim of his wine glass, he knew he was going to break it.
He also did not like it when Malfoy thoroughly chased the morose stage of drunkenness, something that was only cut short by him sitting up straight and proclaiming he was going to vomit. Harry ran after him, tripping over a pile of books which delayed him enough that Malfoy had already thrown the door of his en suite open and was hanging over the toilet. Harry didn’t even hesitate before he was on his knees beside Malfoy, a hand rubbing his back, murmuring at him until he was done. Malfoy looked at him with glassy eyes, made several feeble attempts to shove him away and then curled his fingers into the soft cotton of Harry’s t-shirt, pressing his forehead into Harry’s collarbone.
Draco had screamed and punched him in the arm. Harry had turned and laughed in his face and kissed him and then ran away, still laughing.
It must have been good enough for Ron because he just nodded and they returned to silent observers until Harry was called. Malfoy’s gaze was a weight on his back as he headed towards the witness box; Harry pretended not to notice how heavy it was as he took his seat and the questioning began.
“Uh, yes I did!” Ron interjected, frowning.
“Posh people, probably,” Harry said. “They’re always talking nonsense. Hermione and I went to Oxford for the day not long ago and eavesdropped.”
Harry didn’t know if Draco would expect him. They had danced around the subject of Christmas, gesturing towards it but never fully landing. Harry had watched Draco’s eyes shadow, his lips turn thin whenever it came up. He didn’t need to ask to know that it probably wouldn’t be a very happy Christmas. He didn’t need to ask to know that the last one had been miserable. He remembered his too, although he was doing his best to create a fence around it, a partition between the now and then which he carefully tended to.
It wasn’t enough that he had apologised in the courts. It wasn’t enough that he had thanked Harry, that he had made flippant remarks about his own stupidity, that he had kissed Harry breathless. It wasn’t enough for Harry to just wish that Malfoy was trying and it meant that he was. He needed him to say it to feel like he knew it. He wanted Malfoy to tell him that he was determined to keep changing. He wanted him to indicate that he cared about repentance, beyond the morose funk he’d fallen into at his father’s birthday.
“It was three times six. It’s not that hard.”
“Yes,” Harry said  with a grin, “and now I’m finished. Maybe you should stop eating your quill and eat proper food, if you’re that hungry.” Harry walked into the kitchen and over to the kettle, laughing as Malfoy scowled at him. Even with the scowling, he set his quill down, obviously not wanting to continue chewing on it when someone else was around to see him.
Harry nodded and then threw himself onto the grass beside him. They looked up at the sky, which had started to darken slightly. The clouds were not as clear anymore and there was the faint threat of rain. Harry reached over and grabbed Draco’s hand.
Harry noticed Draco was studying him, his pale eyes watching Harry’s movements with interest. For a moment, he let the other boy and then self-consciousness peeked in. “What?”
a new home if he wanted. He had Hermione, and Ron, and Ginny, and Lavender and Draco. He was wanted. He had people who cared.
“It’s not that. The other stuff just isn’t as immediate.”
“For me?” Harry tried to ignore the unpleasant swoop of his stomach, the self-conscious twist which usually left him feeling unsettled. It didn’t matter that people wanted to do this for me who he didn’t know; what mattered was that
Harry lifted the letter, which he had crumpled up and shoved into his pocket just in case. A burst of smugness exploded through him at the look on Malfoy’s face. “I don’t know Malfoy,” he said, casually. “This is definitely an invitation.”
“No, it’s brilliant,” Harry said. “It was a great idea. I think I’m going to like working with animals.”
He shook himself and splashed water in his face afterwards and studied his reflection. He looked at the pile of photographs and seized the last of his bags up and apparated to Grimmauld Place. The repairs had rather fallen by the wayside, a grand idea he had wanted to do and then got too caught up in other things. As Harry stood out on the pavement in front of the house, clutching bags of his belongings, he thought maybe he could make it work. Maybe this could be his home.
As one, Harry and Hermione turned to him and Hermione reached out. Ron came to her instantly, confusion on his face. She pulled him down and folded him into their hug and said, with wonder, “My parents remember who I
Chuckling weakly, Ginny drew away from him. She covered her face with both hands and shook her head a few times. Harry, unsure what to do, sat backwards. He watched Ginny and wished that this whole conversation was over. He wished that the ugly spike of resentment trying to make its way through him would go away. Ginny had done enough and deserved to get what she wanted; he just had to trust her.
Dinner with Lavender had become something of a routine now. They ate together every other week — lunch or dinner or sometimes breakfast, depending on where the moon was. Harry was ashamed to admit that he had barely talked to Lavender, had rarely listened to her before he had appeared on her doorstep asking questions he thought she could answer. He had apologised once and Lavender had said “Yes that was really silly of you” and that had been the end of it.
It took about ten minutes for the gates to open and Malfoy was standing just around the first bend in the lane, looking confused and surprised and as if he hated being both of those things.
Narcissa looked at him and smiled. “That’s very kind, but I think I would prefer to do it myself. I stopped doing this for so long.” Her expression changed, going distant. “There seemed no point in it last year.”
“Hermione thought it would be nice,” Ron said. He did not really need to but it made Harry smile anyway, especially when Hermione quite clearly kicked him under the table. The wince made it funnier.
Sometimes, it was just that they would sit together in the kitchen, Malfoy pouring over notes and getting Harry to help him with his potions. Harry, who had always been a practical learner, found he picked a few things up from Malfoy but mostly he chopped ingredients and watched. This apparently suited Malfoy just fine, as he quite liked to talk. He narrated what he was doing, a string of instructions which Harry barely managed to pay attention to. He told Harry all about what he was working on, and what the course work entailed, and what he thought of the tutor, and what he thought of the last grade he was given (usually: it wasn’t high enough). Sometimes, they sat together, drinking tea or sometimes wine or sometimes whiskey. Sometimes, they talked.
“Nah,” Harry said, feeling warm. “I’ve not done a single thing stupid lately. You don’t get to duck out of this one. I’m telling you off.”
“I’m over here!” Harry said wildly. “How can I be doing that? You’re the one doing it.”
The next time Harry stood at Malfoy Manor’s gates he couldn’t help but wonder if it
Some of them were too starstruck to be sufficiently helpful.
“Hey!” Harry pretended to be offended. “I did good in some of those games.”
, Potter,” Malfoy spat. “Stop kicking my kitchen and help me or get out.”
“Good morning, Malfoy,” Harry said and then, seized by the urge, he bowed slightly. Draco laughed and then frowned.
“Either way, one of us wins, right?” Harry smiled widely and Malfoy’s mouth twitched, just slightly.
Grinning, Harry nipped lightly at Malfoy’s collarbone. At some point, he’d opened Malfoy’s shirt and he moved back, one thumb brushing lightly against a nipple. Malfoy hissed in a breath and Harry grinned, dragging the other hand down, letting it dance over Malfoy’s stomach, touch feather light. Malfoy was somehow both panting and barely breathing, his chest rising and falling, his eyes glued to Harry.
Draco looked at him once and then nodded, turning his broom down and dipping into a twist that Harry sat back and watched. He wanted to clap. He wanted to tell Draco that he thought he was a great flier, that he wanted to hear him laugh and whoop and give himself to the air. He wanted to tell him that joy was waiting for him. He wanted to tell him so many things, but he opened his mouth and he knew the wind would steal his words.
Malfoy breathed in a way that could only be described as irritably. “Yes, I know. I just thought you weren’t going to come. I told Mother all morning you weren’t and then you did and I looked like a knob.”
“I don’t need you to pretend that you care about my father, Potter,” Malfoy said, more to the fire than to Harry. “It’s insulting to both of us and, although I usually enjoy insulting you, I’m feeling too tired for it today.”
It did not look like Ginny much wanted to cry when they were finally alone again. She lay on her bed, feet kicked up and resting against the baseboard, apparently fully unconcerned that her shorts were muddy and would undoubtedly transfer onto the sheets. Ginny had moved the clothes off the armchair when Harry entered the room and he sat in it, twisting towards the bed so he could watch her. His elbow was propped on the arm of the chair, his chin resting in the palm of his hand. Harry traced Ginny’s profile over and over and waited for her to speak. It looked like she wanted to — she kept shooting him looks out of the corner of her eye, biting and then releasing her lip.
“Of course not!” Hermione looked genuinely shocked at the suggestion. “It has to be personal. This is all about you. I already know what I’m doing and I found making lists infinitely helpful. There’s something soothing about it.”
“Well just in case you wanted to spend it with Malfoy or whatever.” Ron pulled a face but it disappeared quickly, chased away by the fond smile he kept giving Hermione even when she wasn’t looking at him.
Harry blinked at her, halfway through a sip of tea. “What?”
Harry felt hot under the joint weight of his friend’s gazes, embarrassment making his neck warm. “We were talking about what she wanted to do next year and she told me that I clearly didn’t want her.” He scratched at his neck. “I tried to tell her she was wrong but it just didn’t go right. And she told me she thought I was stuck and she didn’t want to be. So....yeah.” Trailing off, Harry took a large gulp of wine before he looked across the table.
“What are you doing?”
“Stop
When the picture came out the next day, the three of them decided to get it framed.
He couldn’t see Ginny’s smile but he could hear it in her voice as she tipped towards him, resting her head against his shoulder. “That’s all I want for you, Harry.”
They had not discussed it afterwards in any depth. Harry was never quite sure what to say around her and they didn’t have a great deal of interests that collided. Occasionally, when they were sitting in silence, Harry wondered whether he was taking annoying Malfoy too far. Every time the thought occurred to him it was swiftly followed by an agreement in a voice that sounded vaguely like Hermione and Harry usually just tried to shut it up by feeding himself.
Harry nodded and then did exactly that: he thought about it more. He thought about it that night as he picked up around him in the living room and his bedroom, pushing clothes and books and detritus into piles. He didn’t get to sleep until late because he lay awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if that was what the future held for him.
Ron snorted. “Mate, you were singing about tomatoes about twenty minutes ago. You seem happy.”
On Christmas Eve, Harry stumbled back from his dog walking shift laden with treats. His backpack, which was usually filled with water bottles and snacks and dog treats, had been charmed by Hermione to expand. Even though he had seen the charm in action before, it didn’t prevent the wonder that seized him when he saw just how much he could shove into it: panettone, gingerbread biscuits, mulled wine, Christmas cake, various cookies and biscuits and scones, tubes of Pringles and bags of fancy crisps and some alcohol too. Harry had done his best to give them back but Christmas cheer seemed effulgent. Joan Harrison, one of his favourites, had pinched his cheek, ruffled his hair and shooed him away with a loud, “Don’t be at that now. Bugger off and have a marvellous Christmas, Harry dear.”
Malfoy turned red and then grabbed for Harry, fisting his hand in Harry’s t-shirt and pulling him closer with a vicious tug. It was an awkward angle because Malfoy barely moved, turning from the waist only as their mouths met in a searing kiss. It was an awkward angle but Harry didn’t care, couldn’t care, as Malfoy kissed him so fiercely that it felt like he was stealing his breath. Harry pressed his fingers tight into Malfoy’s skin and then ducked down further, sliding his hands back into Malfoy’s hair.
“But you shouldn’t have to owe anyone. You’ve done quite enough.” Hermione frowned, leaning forward and reaching for his hand. Her grip was firm and warm, fingers curling around his as she stared at him. It made his chest feel like it was expanding and Harry grinned back at her, folding their fingers together, grabbing her hand in his.
at first, not until Malfoy disappeared around a corner and Harry followed him. The front chamber of the room was filled with bookcases and a massive desk upon which were piled bundles of notes. A huge fireplace dominated one wall of the room, around which were arranged a few armchairs. One of them was completely covered in discarded clothes.
Hermione sighed. “He’s been on the Wizengamot for at least fifty years. And the amount of times he falls asleep is apparently shocking. I’ve read the paper mentioning it at least two dozen times and I’m not overly looking for it. It’s a wonder he has his job.”
Malfoy squinted at him, confusion in the shape of his mouth which was chased away a moment later as he started to laugh.
Harry really wanted to say that they hadn’t (because they hadn’t, not properly, not in any sort of way that soothed his soul) but instead he said, “How can you be busy? You’re on house arrest.”
“Of course it is,” Malfoy said, in a tone that didn’t quite reach unkindness but certainly pressed intimately against it, “but then again, Potter, you were always going to get a very important offer.”
“You wouldn’t complain if I shoved you to the ground, trust me.” It was out of Harry’s mouth before he thought about it. He snapped his mouth shut, colour creeping up his neck as embarrassment flooded him. Clearing his throat, Harry said, “Anyway, um. What I’m trying to get at is that I know you were trying to do something nice. I mean, I get that.”
“Shut up, Ronald. Anyway, Draco’s trial starts in about twenty minutes and — well Lucius’ has been going on for a few days already.” Hermione pushed a hand through her hair. “We’re not going to that one.”
“Shut up, you drama queen.” Harry brushed Draco’s hair away from his eyes. “You look disgusting. I think you need to get some sleep.”
“I don’t — I don’t think I’ve ever seen Malfoy play a piano.”
Harry looked at where Hermione’s face had been and swallowed against any panic. “Whatever we can, Ron. Like we said. We’ll just help how we can. We’ll be here for her, too, in case she needs us.”
“I think so.” Harry dropped his hand.
He was family. He had a family. It didn’t matter what had happened, he had family.
Harry looked at Ron instead of back at Hermione. Ron was leaning back in his chair, his arms folded, watching them. Harry recognised the look on his face from the hours that they had spent together playing chess. He was looking at the pieces in front of them, trying to anticipate their moves. His mouth was curved slightly. He was watching Harry just as intently as Hermione had been, but he wasn’t speaking now. He just looked like he was listening.
“He was in the music room when I came out here,” Narcissa said. Mumbling his thanks, Harry stood up, dusted off his trousers and departed. He didn’t need Blighter to show him where he was going this time. His feet were more confident as he walked through the corridors. As he approached the music room, Harry could hear playing.
at this very address so just in case you wondered what that means it means I’m going to be very underfoot. At all times.” Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. “You better watch your back, Potter. I won’t be caught out by you.”
“I asked you here for a reason, Harry.” Narcissa’s back somehow straightened. “I wanted to talk with you about the situation that I find myself in.”
Ginny stared at him blankly and then narrowed her eyes. “But I don’t want to do that, Harry. I don’t
“Don’t boss me about, Malfoy.” Harry sat down immediately. “Make your own tea.”
“Ludicrous.” Malfoy lifted his chin and glanced at Harry once, from the corner of his eye. It seemed to make him decide to lift his chin even higher. Harry hated it. “There’s no point in lying, Potter, no one here is going to believe you anyway.”
Malfoy hummed. “Yes, rather. She played at my first birthday, too, although naturally I didn’t care much for it. She came back here a number of times before she died. My father always told me that I would one day learn from her but I was never truly motivated and she refused to teach me until I applied myself better.” He paused and turned his head to look out a window. Harry stared at him and wondered if he should be saying anything. The problem, of course, was that he didn’t have anything to say and Malfoy looked sad and wistful, his pale face even paler than normal. He wore a dark red shirt with large sleeves, a robe thrown around him as capitulation to the cold, although he had left it undone. Harry thought he looked stark and severe and so
Ron laughed and shook his head. “Yeah, you would. You just don’t get it right now. That’s fine, though, because I get it. If you don’t want to be an Auror then, Merlin, Harry, don’t be. I’d only be happy if you were happy, too. Seeing you wear yourself down would break my heart a bit.”
Malfoy was making a potion the next time Harry stopped by — or, rather, he was probably making a potion because he was in the kitchen and a cauldron was bubbling but he was soundly ignoring it and was scribbling on some parchment. Harry hovered in the doorway, watching Malfoy. He had a jumper on over his shirt and both were pushed up, almost to his elbows. He chewed on the end of a quill every now and again, the feather bedraggled from how often he had done it. Harry watched Malfoy move the quill around and then back to his mouth, entranced, and then he cleared his throat.
“Shut up,” Harry said.
It only took a moment of remembrance before Harry sprang to action. He couldn’t leave, not with things as they were, not without checking in. He shrugged on the jacket and started to wind his way through the Manor, checking every hiding place of Draco’s he had ever come across. He started with his bedroom, sure that it wouldn’t unveil itself for him and startled when it did. The door sprang into existence in front of Harry and Harry stared at it for a minute, his mouth open. The wood twinkled at him and Harry tried not to search for meaning in its shine.
“Yes, Ms Crank,” he said and she smiled at him. “I believe it’s important for all of us to understand that people can do things — bad things, horrible things — but that doesn’t mean we’re purely that. I think we should be showing that people who stand up and do something because it’s the right thing to do and show that we can be brave should be rewarded for that. And I think that she did that and that she deserves my testimony.”
Harry nodded. He didn’t think to speak. He didn’t think he needed to, considering that Narcissa was barely looking at him. She held the muffin in her hand as she stood, excusing herself. Harry was left in the library, staring at the assortment of scones and the half-full cups of tea. He tried to grasp what had happened, how quickly everything had changed — less than ten minutes ago, the thought had been curling at the edges of his mind that he loved how warm the Malfoy’s library was, that he appreciated how it soothed a part of him he couldn’t give a name to.
Harry frowned. “Your mum invited me? I got a letter yesterday.”
When it was done, he brought it over to the table and dished up everyone’s breakfast, setting the leftovers carefully to the side before he took a seat again.
Harry could see the scowl on Malfoy’s face even from his profile. Harry had to fight to suppress his smile. “Only a little. It was fine. Call me Harry.”
Malfoy did not lean forward. He simply stood there, staring at Harry, and Harry stared at him, his heart pounding, the crash of water loud in his ears. Time was not moving and then it was, Harry surging forward, pulling his hands out of his pockets to grab at Malfoy’s jumper and tug him down. Malfoy’s fingers became claws on the side of Harry’s face and then their lips met. It was awkward at first, too vicious, their teeth clacking. Harry hissed but it didn’t seem to matter because then they were kissing again, Malfoy’s mouth hot on his.
He could walk to the animal Healer, so he did. Harry did that now: he walked everywhere if he could. He had always hated apparating, hated the way his stomach twisted and turned, how his body failed to feel like his own for moments after he reappeared. Sometimes it brought him back with startling clarity to the Forbidden Forest and Harry wouldn’t, couldn’t go back there. He wanted to be in the world, so he walked in it and tried to take it all in.
“Oh, are you?” Ron grinned, but tried to hide it. It was useless: he’d never been able to hide his emotions really and his was a mouth that
It delighted him now, making his heart both sing and clench. He remembered how jealously he had watched the Malfoy’s clinging to each other after the battle: they had been on the wrong side, they had been in the
Harry buried both hands in his hair and took a few quick steps away from Malfoy. “Why? Why can’t you figure it out on your own? You’re not stupid.”
Harry moved forward and pressed his lips against Draco’s softly. The kiss felt more like an exhale, a breath. His lips ghosted across Draco’s, feather light, and then he moved to place one at the corner of his smile. He kissed the tip of Draco’s nose and his forehead. He kissed his eyelids, tilting Draco’s head towards him. Draco settled his hands onto Harry’s shoulders and his fingers clawed at them. He bent his head in benediction towards Harry as Harry pressed worshipful kisses across his face. Draco held on tight and Harry felt like telling him he didn’t need to. He was here.
“What?” Harry startled, staring between Hermione and Ron. Hermione just looked at him steadily but Ron flushed, his skin turning red. “Since when? What?”
Hermione and Ron stayed behind too, lingering in the courtroom doorway as Harry made his way to Narcissa.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, looking for words that disappeared completely when Malfoy moved again, pulling Harry down to him as Malfoy ground up. The air left Harry’s lungs in a rush and he dropped his forehead against Malfoy’s shoulder. He wanted more. He knew it with a startling clarity and Harry moved his hands, dragging them out of Malfoy’s hair, and seeking the warmth under Malfoy’s shirt. He pressed sloppy, open mouthed kisses along Malfoy’s throat, sucking a bruise onto his collarbone, biting lightly at it. Malfoy groaned and Harry felt heat and pressure and the blinding need of release coil through him.
The gates sprung open, as usual, and Harry stared at them. He stood there, staring, for a long time, trying to regulate his breathing, trying to remind himself what it was to feel normal. He knew part of what Ginny had said was the truth, but that didn’t make it the whole truth. He wanted her: he just didn’t know how to live as someone who wanted people, who could have them, touch them and taste them and take them. He’d never got to do that before, not properly, not without the stark and certain knowledge that Voldemort was going to appear again.
Draco’s face was so pointed that it was easy for shadows to appear. They chased each other across his face now. “I did not see the point of remaining there much longer. Dry yourself, Potter, you look like one of your dogs.”
“Oh, right. Right.” Ron looked thoughtful and then he smiled. “You did ask us if we thought you could be a Healer before. You could be an animal one. I think you’d have a better bedside manner then.”
“Draco, please,” Harry said, pleading too. “Just tell me. Just say it to me.”
“No, Draco. Tell me how long before your potions need to be looked at again.”
“I’m not trying to
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I told you. It’s because he can’t leave.”
“No, Harry, I’m serious,” Hermione said, earnest and shining with it. “I just want you to know that. You helped us. Her, me, all of us, and we’re all grateful and you should know that if you don’t want to help Narcissa Malfoy that not one person would think less of you.”
Malfoy breathed in sharply and pulled a face. “I don’t
“It’s okay.” Harry shrugged. “It happens.”
The next morning, as he made breakfast for the household, Harry sang. He sang real songs and made up ones, about eggs and tomatoes and how milky Ron liked his tea. He sang about the fact the next day was March and that he started a new job in a couple of days. He kept singing until Ron and Hermione walked in, walked back out, and then came into the room again.
“We love you too,” Ron said. Harry opened his mouth to say something, found he couldn’t, and nodded instead.
I’m studying. You’re here
If he had thought about his actions maybe he would have been nervous, but Harry acted on instinct and he had good instincts. He knew that. He trusted his instincts as he reached into Malfoy’s trousers, seeking hot, hard flesh and grasping it. Malfoy let out a keening noise and stared at Harry with eyes that were mostly black now, pupils large. Harry grinned and leaned forward, kissing Malfoy deeply as he started to move his hand. His touch was too soft at first, tentative and unsure. For a second, Harry remembered he’d never
A silence settled on the kitchen which was only broken by the sound of water boiling. Hermione and Ron looked at each other. Hermione’s face looked tight and Ron’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment.
with me today, even though you’re being impossibly stubborn, so I’m telling you that I’m going to be here for the rest of the night. I’m not hitting on you now but I’m going to undress you and shove you into that shower unless you do it yourself because, quite frankly, you smell and you’ve been assaulting my senses since the moment you came here today and I’m not prepared to let that continue, no matter what.”
Harry had no answer to that question because then he would have to admit he had no idea what Malfoy was talking about, as he had not realised that was happening. Instead, he snapped his mouth shut, looking to one corner of the room. He studiously tried to avoid looking at the bed. It seemed weirdly intimate. “I didn’t know we were near your bedroom.”
Draco scowled. “I can’t leave the grounds.”
Better, until Harry exited the study to find Malfoy lounging against one of the walls. It was such a blatant display of eavesdropping that Harry actually paused and stared at him for a whole ten seconds before he threw his head back and laughed. Malfoy looked affronted and pushed himself off from the wall, scowling at Harry. Harry noticed he’d rolled the ends of his trousers and his sleeves up: he deliberately did not look for the Dark Mark.
“This is my house. I live here. In fact, I’m under
Harry looked up at Malfoy. He hadn’t moved and he was not sure he would know how to if he tried. He felt like he, too, had become a feature in Malfoy’s garden, like he’d grown roots and would never be able to move again. Malfoy was looking at him with hot eyes, his thumb slowly moving. Neither of them spoke, but Malfoy splayed his hand out across Harry’s jaw wider and brushed a finger across the seam of Harry’s mouth. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath and knew it was his own.
“So am I.” Harry moved closer, brushing past Draco, looking at the rows of plants that he had been watering. He couldn’t remember what they were called. He wished he could, so he could say something funny, or clever, or interesting about them. Sometimes Harry didn’t feel very funny, or clever, or interesting. Sometimes he wished he could say what he wanted to Draco and have it be the right thing. He turned his chin to look at him, studying his profile for a moment.
“Why don’t you sit, Harry?” Narcissa asked. She didn’t move, which Harry was glad for because then it meant he didn’t have to sit beside her. Instead, he chose the sofa facing hers and sat down, not quite sinking back into the plush cushions. They looked at each other, neither of them speaking at first, before Narcissa started to smile. “I wanted to thank you again.”
Malfoy chuckled, but it sounded mirthless. “Oh, I’m tired of doing everything first.”
Harry could admit to himself, as he tilted his head back and tried to deepen the kiss, that he had thought about this. It had been in fleeting moments, thoughts he had decided not to chase down dark corridors, thoughts that had nonetheless haunted him. The whispered ghosts of the memories came to him now: times when he had been alone and considered what it would feel like to have Malfoy’s hands in his hair, what he would taste like, if he would kiss with any restraint. It turned out that he did not. Malfoy chased Harry’s mouth with fevered determination, his hand twisting through Harry’s hair, tugging at him as if he was afraid he would move away.
Draco swallowed and then Harry watched a sneer appear. It looked tremulous, as if Draco was really digging deep to pull it up, but it appeared nonetheless. “Is this when you admit to me that you actually did lose it that time in fifth year?”
Harry beams. “I can start tomorrow.”
