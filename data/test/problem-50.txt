It’s a fair observation. He's not even opened the book Hermione had recommended to him, and though he’s sure it’ll be fascinating later, and he can think of a dozen things he’d prefer to be learning about at this moment. None of them are related to Charms.
Hermione looks at him begrudgingly and admits, “Yes, Harry, you are quite skilled for a supposed beginner.”
“What deal?” Harry asks suspiciously. Suddenly he’s recalling their little chat in the hallway the night previous.
Malfoy’s squawk of surprise puts a little smile on Harry’s face. He casts a Softening Charm at the ground under his feet, drops to his knees, and sets about making Malfoy let loose several more surprised noises. “Oh my- Salazar, Potter, you’re-
Draco had known, from the beginning that he was going to die. When he had blithely walked into Harry’s office and plopped his muddy feet on his desk, he had known how this journey was to end. All of the annoying jibes and flirting distractions were all words spoken by a dying man.
“Basically you just told my aunt that we were going to build a love shack in the back yard in which to have sex in order to research being gay together.”
He reached out to Harry with his free hand, his face triumphant. Harry grabbed hold and pulled Draco atop his broom.
A headache began to grow behind Harry's right eye, but to acknowledge it would have been seen as confirmation of Draco's statements. While what Draco said was true, Harry had no desire to continue the line of conversation.
“Get out. Just get out. I’ve stayed away from your family and lived a Malfoy-free life for a good five years. Don’t ruin it now.”

"I didn’t know what it meant to like someone. They way people described it made it seem like heartburn. Someone said it was that you thought about this person all the time. So that’s when I decided I must have a crush on Granger, because I thought about her all the time.”
Harry could feel his eyes burn from frustration. How could Draco say such things? “How can you just give up like this? Do you want to die?”
Draco jumped from the wall and rushed over to Harry's side. “No! Don't you see? I wouldn't have used it for good. Maybe I would have used it to get my family out of the Manor and away from that madman, but I wouldn't have done anything heroic. I wouldn't have used the wand to save orphans or feed the needy. I would have taken it and been selfish and eventually I wouldn't have cared if my choices were good or bad anymore, because there would be no consequences to my actions!”
Draco’s nude body was completely uncovered in his bed. Beads of sweat covered his body. His skin was flushed pink.
“Ta,” Harry said, stuffing the paper in his pocket. The name Hermione was so unusual, Harry thought, but it sounded vaguely familiar.
"I told you already we’ve been working on ending my probation. The paperwork has already been filed. Come tonight, I will be a free man."
Snorting, Draco turned back to Harry with a soft smile. The look of it took Harry's breath away. 'I think I was channelling my father. For all his faults, the man had a talent for playing hard ball.'
Draco was hard. He was hard and Harry was touching him. He was touching another man’s crotch. He could not believe it. It was everything and nothing like he imagined. It felt heavy, and hot, and very precious. This was a vulnerable body part that Draco had just let him touch, at will.
That’s me, Hayden Malfoy, currently thirteen years old and definitely not looking forward to the work my father has planned for us.
The magic stops swirling around my body instantly, leaving me cold. I shiver, and cough, my body curling into one side, the shock of what happened catching up with me. My father wraps his arm around me and hugs me close.
It was then that Harry realized that he had kissed Draco that morning before he had left. He hadn’t even realized it. It had just seemed like the thing to do.
He gingerly plucked his sheet off his body and headed for the shower, feeling tender and sore all over.
Harry reddened. But the embarrassment did have an unexpected bonus, as Draco was now close enough for Harry to smell his cologne, a subtle woodsy scent that was strangely enticing. Harry reddened more, realizing that he probably smelled like sweat.
“I did. I had no idea what was going then either. I always dreamt about it and woke up with sticky sheets, but I honestly had no idea how to orgasm by myself. I thought you needed someone else to do it.”
“No, it doesn’t. Thank you for reminding me of that. I spent the whole night fixing the twigs. They’re ready for the next step. And I swear I will pay attention more to what you say. I understand that your work is important to you and I was insulting you by not giving it the effort it deserved.”
He could feel Draco's eyes boring into the back of his head from the high table. Harry swallowed and began his speech, hoping Draco might hear the apology in his words.
The living room has a large fireplace that my father always keeps lit, even in the summer, which is just one of the wizarding habits he can’t break. There are a few of those, like keeping his wand with him at all times, even though he doesn’t use it. He used to keep it up his sleeve, but now he just jams it into his back pocket or behind his ear, and if we go out he shrinks it and wraps it around his wrist like a bracelet. He thought it looked girly, but I reminded him that real men can wear bracelets, real men can wear anything. My dad wore a black flowy dress for most of his formative years so it seemed silly to be concerned over a small wooden accessory.
There was a thud on the door, as if something had knocked into it. 'I heard what you and Malfoy were talking about, Harry. You forget how sound carries on water.'
“I’m fine, truly. I just got a little too into the final stage. I’ll be right back. Andromeda and Teddy joining us this evening?”
"Go back upstairs and take a shower. You’re sweating like a pig and you probably smell. I won't have a smelly teenager in front of company."
Harry watched Draco's eyes soften. His eyes were so beautiful, gray and soft. They looked like the soft pebble he had found at the park. He had taken it home and hid it under his pillow, rubbing it at night, enjoying the smooth surface.
“No, I am not his father. Remus is his father and I will never replace that. I’m his godfather, his friend, the kid who colors with him and makes him ice cream sundaes. That’s not a father, that’s a playmate.”
“Well, Malfoy, it seems like you really know what you’re doing.” Malfoy snorted at this. “So, how do we start? What’s the first step?”
Harry did the only thing he could think of in response. He flipped Draco, bent down and took Draco's cock in his mouth to the root.
And in the morning, when the light of day brought reality to the situation at hand, Draco got up out of bed, put back on his trousers, and left the flat; the sound of his ringing bell the only goodbye. Harry was left with a pile of dirty sheets and a dazed decadent smile. It had been quite a night.
One by one the party-goers left, dragging their children away from the tree house. Many of the adults had raved about the insides when they had gone in to fish out their hiding child, but Harry really didn’t want to hear it.
Draco folded his arms, his demeanor growing graver with every one of Harry's words. “A blemish on my skin has nothing to do with you, Potter. I have already asked you to leave, and now I must ask you to mind your own business. You are becoming quite an annoying, nosy parker.”
Neville stuffed a sausage in his mouth and shrugged his shoulders. The pair continued to eat, reading the newsletter over and over between them.
“But I’m not an adult to Teddy! I never was before! I…I don’t want to be an adult. I don’t know how!”
Harry nervously sat down on the sofa across from the armchair. He had worked so hard to get back into Draco's cottage, but now that he was there, Harry was unsure what to say.
It had started one drunken night at the new gay club in London. Harry had walked in, after having more than a few pints with Ron and Dean at the Leaky, and spotted a fit, sweaty man dancing in the center of the room, wearing only a pair of tight trousers and a thin black strap around his neck.
"Well since you aren’t there, I might as well take all those striped boxers you begged me to buy you and hang them on the oak trees out front instead of the ribbons. I’m sure all the girls on the street would love to see your pants flying in the wind."
"Come on, just tell me. It's a prank that's gone on too long and it needs to end. Tell me who it is and I can stop working on the case and spend the rest of my holiday in your bed."
Draco moved to get off Harry’s lap, but Harry would have none of that. He held onto Draco tighter and pulled Draco’s head to his chest. They sat for a while. Harry listened to Draco’s heartbeat. It matched the movement of the train.
McGonagall snatched the Hat from him. Harry stepped back as she started to argue with the Hat and throwing several spells at it, most likely looking for hexes or enchantments.
Draco teased Harry's entrance with the wet fingers, circling in a maddeningly slow way. Harry arched into it, his movements begging Draco to go in deeper. Draco relented, probing first with one and then adding another after Harry whinged and wiggled for more.
Harry looked down. He was ashamed of lying and now she knew what they were really doing. He thought she would be a lot more excited about the tree house, but maybe she didn’t like the idea. After all that work Andromeda was going to tell Harry to knock it down.
Draco shook his head. “Potter, you don't understand magic very well, do you? Magic always finds a way, always. And if magic wants to turn me into a tree and have you cut me down, well then that's what magic will get.”
“Potter can tell you, how he stole everything from me and my family. Made me work in the Muggle world while filthy little Mudblood children got the easy life!”
Dean then smiled up at Harry. And for the first time, Harry didn't feel the weight of guilt on his heart. Perhaps something good had come from his day.
Draco raised his shoulders in resignation. “I have no idea why I did what I did. Actually I thought…no never mind. I’ve forgotten already! The image of your pufferfish face has erased everything else!”
Harry remained in the house for the rest of the party. He always had some excuse or another. There needed to be more snacks. He could sneak beer to the adults. He wanted to get a head start on the cleaning. He really just could not face that tree house and Teddy’s smiling face. He should be happy for Teddy. He really did seem to love the tree house. Harry had picked a good gift this year. He just thought they could share it.
“Before I leave I just have one thing to say. You need to see a healer, and soon. I don’t think what’s happening to you is normal.”
Harry twisted around to see that while the voice speaking to him was the same as Sir Culhwich, his body had changed to look exactly like Theodore Nott Senior.
The bark swiftly began to grow over Draco's eyes. Harry was pushed away from the tree as branches shot out from all angles. The trunk rose from the ground until it rose above Harry's head. The branches doubled, tripled, until there were branches everywhere, twisting and turning.
Padma continued, 'I asked, but as Draco stated before, he can't answer any of our questions due to the Unbreakable Vow. The black cauldron myth is the only thing that makes sense, although I have no idea what Draco would want with a broken cauldron.'
Harry placed the book in Draco's hands. It was getting harder for Draco to reach out as the bark had extended around his shoulders.
Harry bit his lips and ran through all the things he had learnt when Draco was gone, all the books he had read and all the research. Thousands of tree poems and myths, spells, and potions flew through his head. There was nothing that could help.
Neville stared off into space, most likely remembering the circumstances that had required him to call upon the sword.
Draco moaned and bit down on Harry’s lip. The copper taste of blood filled his mouth. Harry bit on Draco’s lip in response, causing it to bleed as well. Their blood intermingled in their mouths and Harry loved the taste of it.
“Potter, quit drooling all over the sticks and get over here. I need your brute strength and I need it now.”
Draco smirked. ‘I’m not sure what’s holding Luna, but the rest of the cages have basic stasis and containment spells.’
Harry, in his anger, really didn’t understand what he was saying. Clearly Malfoy didn’t expect Harry’s reaction either because he stopped mid stride and stared at Harry as if a third head had grown out of one of his nostrils.
Underneath a stack of large blue boxer shorts I hit the jackpot. I curl my lips, trying not to think of the state of Mr. Potter's pants, and peal back the shorts to reveal a manila folder with paperclips attached.
Draco stood up. “Yes. I am most definitely all right. How much do you want to know about being gay, Harry?”
‘We’re in search of an ancient magical item called the Magical Cauldron. I am the last descendant of the Malfoy family line and it is my duty to find the object. Do you know where we can find it?’
Draco quickly looked around the bathroom, but Kreacher had already disappeared. Harry scowled. This certainly was not helping his case.
“Yes, yes. All this talking is just delaying my shower, and I really want one now. I’ll be back in time for dinner, I promise.”
Harry grabbed Draco's tunic collar and lifted Draco to his feet. 'What was that goblin saying to you?'
“I think I remember you,” he said, carefully watching the other man for his reaction. “I think I was always trying to remember you.”
“I understand your initial reason for lying, but what I don’t understand is why you took the lie so far.”
That’s my father, the notorious Draco Malfoy, as he claims. When I was very little, my father would spit out the word notorious before his name like it was a piece of gristle stuck between his teeth. I had no idea what the word meant, but I could sense it meant something bad. I was confused as to why my father used such a word to describe himself, and when I heard him say it, I would curl behind his legs and pull at his trousers to get him to stop.
Finally fed up with this farce of a dinner I place my napkin on the table and settle my fork on the edge of my plate. I’m about to start interrogating Mr. Potter when my father interrupts me with ridiculous small talk.
Harry was confused. He was confused and angry and really wanted to get out of the room. It was getting hot, and stuffy, and Draco's hair was looking too shiny. His words were just too perfect. He probably practiced all of this in front of a mirror. Teaching
I grip the doorjamb and open my mouth to spill everything to my dad, to warn him, when Mr Potter shuffles behind me, poking his head into the kitchen.
Harry crawled in after her, the dirt filling his nails. He looks over to see Draco right next to him, his long blond hair covered in mud, his felt tunic soaked through.
Draco gasped. Snape's hands shook, but the spell wrapped around Harry and Draco's hands in a gold band.
“Enough for a handful of adults to be comfortable, and a large group of children. Enough room that Teddy can hold a party for all his friends and they can all spend the night together cuddled in sleeping bags on the floor. Can you fit in a sofa? There should be a sofa. And a fireman’s pole. It definitely needs a fireman’s pole.”
is printed in your classroom and from seeing your class today there is no way that you would not have known about that happening."
had done an exposé on Harry’s preferred sock brand which led to a large pile of purple glitter socks being delivered to him at lunch by an secret admirer, and the canteen had been out of his favorite peanut butter and celery sandwiches. Right now, he just wanted to come home, relax, and try to worm a back rub out of his boyfriend. If he could find him, that is.
'We have a guest coming aboard,' Harry told the ship. 'He’s a nasty tosser, but I’m here to protect you.'
'If you're too scared, we can rush in and clear any danger before you touch your prissy foot on land, Captain,' Finn replied, his tiny fists up in readiness for a fight. Harry sighed silently in his mind. The boy's Gryffindor tendencies were out loud and proud, and that was always a dangerous characteristic in the face of the unknown.
Draco folded his arms. ‘Our real purpose is to find the Magical Cauldron. A goblin on the island told us you might have information as to its whereabouts. I’m just making sure you tell us.’
Draco grumbled underneath his breath, but said nothing. Instead, he looked out into the sky. Harry followed his movements.
“I have no idea what to do. I should have followed you. I had been watching you closely the whole time, trying to find a way to repay my huge debt to you. Instead I let myself get distracted by the Weasel and fought with him instead of going with you into the tunnel.”
“Harry,” Draco replied devilishly, pushing back on Harry’s hands, moving them to his perfectly pert arse. Harry swallowed and started again.
“My father's a good man, see? He knows I can't do magic, but he never makes me feel like I'm missing out. It's been so long since I've seen anything magical, even from him, that sometimes I forget it exists! He does everything the Muggle way, and even though he's never said, I know he does it on purpose, to make me feel comfortable. Do you know he rides a bicycle everywhere? And he purchases copies of my school books and reads them all before the start of the year so he can help me with my homework.”
Harry heard simultaneously, “He Is?” and “I am?” Andromeda looked increasingly skeptical while Malfoy looked like he couldn’t wait for the next inane thing for Harry to say. Maybe it was the look on Malfoy’s face, or perhaps it was nerves, or maybe the weird dream, or most likely the weird curry from last night that never really settled but Harry began the most ridiculous, most complicated and crazy story he had ever fabricated in his entire life.
The sky outside was growing lighter. Harry raced outside, pulling Draco with him. “I can be with you, Draco! Magic can't turn me into a tree because then I won't be with you. So you have stay human!”
.' Draco licked his lips. Harry unconsciously mirrored the action. 'So, my Captain,' Draco purred, 'I say we go here first.'
“All right Potter, Draco, please join hands. Harry, I am placing my wand on your hands, please state your name and then your vow.”
Draco also began to sleep more, taking long naps in the afternoon, laid out on the green grass. During those naps Harry would sit quietly next to Draco exploring the bark that was visible, attempting to fully understand what was coming. Sometimes Harry's hand would slip, and he would find himself petting Draco's hair, running his fingers through the thin strands. Or gently caressing the unblemished skin; Draco's wrists or his smooth, pink cheeks.
“You two boys are going to build, something, in the backyard to do research about being gay, together.”
Malfoy spoke as if he hadn’t just admitted to building a house, by himself, and in a tree no less. Harry never gave any thought towards Malfoy’s intelligence before, but clearly this man had talent. What had Harry ever done in his short life, oh yeah, he defeated the Dark Lord. He felt a little better about himself.
And then, before my back connects with the next step, I'm floating. My mind, still anticipating the next hit, shuts down completely when what was expected does not happen. I'm either saved or dead, and I'm placing my bets on dead. I throw an arm over my eyes, horribly embarrassed to have died falling down the stairs. Not much cachet in death by socks.
Mistakenly, I look over at Mr. Potter, whose mouth has gone slack-jawed. It only fuels my lunatic raging, leading me off topic and far off the point.
Draco lifted the map. 'We landed here,' he pointed to the edge of the island, leaving a small black mark on the map, 'I marked it so we know how to get back to the ship tonight.
“Harry, you sly dog, you’re seeing someone already aren’t you? I knew it! You always get this look about you when you’re seeing someone, like the weight of the world on your shoulder suddenly got a little lighter. All right, Harry!”
Draco pulled his shirt back up, making sure to flip the collar back up. “No worries, you are a brute. I have no doubt you touch whomever you please without their permission.”
'Give her back!' Padma yelled back from his right, shooting off an arrow in the King's direction. It hit his wand arm, piercing the robe and pinning it to the wall.
“Harry, we don’t have much time, but know this. They put us on this train together. Don’t you see? This is my time to save you. I can do it. I can pull you from this fire. Please let me. Please come with me.”
And then Draco was inside him, his hard cock filling Harry to the brim. Harry was so full of Draco, so full of his love and his body. Harry pulled Draco down for a kiss, wrapping his legs around Draco's back, pulling him in deeper. It hurt, and it was over very quickly, but it had been the best experience in Harry's life.
“No, you always get away with things because you’re Harry Potter, boy hero extraordinaire. If you make a mistake people just forgive you, instantly, almost as if you never even made a mistake in the first place! That was three days work you just blew off because you were too good to actually pay attention! Have you not noticed that I have been working longer hours just to help you and your stupid family get this tree house ready in time!”
Draco pulled Harry's face towards him. “I don't want to see you suffer, Harry. Make me into a wand and then move on. I'm in a good place, Harry. I promise.”
He was rolling on something down a corridor. The pleasant sensation of warmth in his hand was gone, as was the tender hand in his hair. Instead, there was something on his face and people yelling above him. He missed the hand running through his hair. It felt nice. Felt like home.
My father's picture flashes before me. He's frowning, wrists in shackles. He looks so young, so angry. His skin is pale and slightly green and his eyes are red, but he still manages to sneer at the camera. The robe he's wearing is simple and black but it looks two sizes too big for him. My father's thin now, but in this picture, he looks like he's about to break in two. Seeing that picture I regret instantly what I am doing, and my stomach is churning, but I can't stop. I can't close the folder.
“Whatever, we can discuss the minute details later. I rather think my time is up, don’t you? I have enough to get started. So, as I said from the beginning, my fee is 100 Galleons and I expect payment now.”
And it was even better when Harry eventually took Draco's cock into his mouth. Draco’s blond curls tickled against his nose and his scent and taste were heavenly.
“No, I had no clue. Most people have fathers who sit them down and talk to them about sex. I didn’t. No one told me that boys did stuff like this.”
Mr. Potter grunts again and heads toward the loo. I watch him walk down the hallway, and I find his shuffled stomping distracting. His trainers are dirty and his wrinkled vest is sticking out in the back of his jumper.
Could he trust Draco? Well the man didn’t really leave him any choice. He would just watch him, and do more research, and make sure that every step Malfoy took was on the level. It would be like sixth year all over again, well except for the whole crazy man trying to kill him. There was significantly less of that.
Harry Transfigured his glasses to binoculars to take a closer look. There in the sky was a small flying fishing boat, but it was too far away to see any more details.
He waited until the last student left the room. Many of them stayed behind, already talking animatedly about the assignment. Harry listened in to a few just in case.
Draco stared at Harry, his haunted look making Harry pause. He pushed off Harry's hand and mounted his broom, flying up and out of the hole. Harry mounted his broom as well and followed, very uneasy with what had just occurred.
They began to kiss again. Draco placed his arms around Harry’s shoulder and rolled them over, placing Harry on top. He liked the new position, because he could look down at Draco, his hair fanned across the pillow, and do anything he wanted to with the willing body below him. For now, he couldn’t get enough of Draco’s lips and his naked body next to him.
His kisses grew in passion. Harry felt more than just lips and a tongue, he felt Draco’s whole being presented to him. And Harry took it all in, bravely lifting another hand and laying it flat on Draco’s skin.
As much as Harry was moved by Madeline's story, he was more interested in the letter from the first year.
“I really appreciated you helping rebuild Hogwarts. It took a lot for you to come back, especially when no one wanted you there.”
“This tree was discovered by one of three brothers. The magic inside the tree had called out to a young man, to cut it down and harvest it. The wood was fashioned into a great wand that could never be defeated. But once the wood was harvested, the tree withered and died, as did all that was contained inside it. Wand makers have attempted to recreate the wand, but none have succeeded.”
Harry's eyes grew heavy and his muscles limp. His empty glass tumbled onto the floor as his body relaxed and his head fell to the side.
It felt good to see them all, to know there were so many people who were worried about him, cared about it, but it felt even better when Draco bent down and kissed Harry gently, moving his attention away from the window and toward his lover. “About time you took a holiday. I spent three whole months without you. I demand you cater to my every whim to make up for it.”
Harry, still attempting to find the source of the voice, decided that it was his turn to try his hand at negotiations.
The pace was brutal. Harry could do nothing but hold onto Draco's hard hips as he bounced on Harry's cock. He reached out and began to pull on Draco's cock only to be slapped away. “Focus on cumming. When you feel like you are going to, tell me.” Harry could do nothing but nod his head in agreement. It was now his turn for his head to knock back into the mattress and his eyes to roll back into his head.
; Ron thought it was hilarious when his fish and chips held pictures of himself or Harry and would enhance the articles with generous amounts of vinegar, ketchup, and tartar sauce. Harry normally ignored what was in his basket, preferring to ignore the
He had no idea what had just happened, but everything in his body had screamed at him to leave that house as soon as possible and never look back. He shivered as his mind systematically attempted to erase and ignore the last ten minutes of his life.
“Malfoy, what are you doing here?” Harry gestured to the door. “I think you should leave as I am expecting someone shortly.”
Harry looked down, thankful for the distraction. He took a moment to refocus before reading where Draco pointed.
“After you mentioned the spell, I knew the person committing the serial robberies was Pansy. I rushed in without thinking. Your letter was completely right. I caught her unaware and she smashed my head into a table.”
Draco pulled Harry up and dragged him out of his quarters, down the steps, and back into his classroom.
Draco didn't respond at first. Harry heard what sounded like brushing. Considering Draco's now-long locks, it made sense.
Harry attempted to uncurl Draco’s hands. Draco reluctantly allowed him. “Do they know if it will stop?”
Draco snorted in response and moved to the other ear. “Figure it out. It's your turn to show up in the middle of the night, naked. I have a house-elf though, so please hide your bits in front of her.”
My father is a good man, no matter what the history books say. Since the day I was born, my father has always protected me and loved me, and that is more than I can say about pretty much anyone else in the wizarding world, including my mother.
“But… but…” I sputter, my mind is not able to comprehend what my father is saying. I want to argue, shake my father until he sees reason, but the sudden closeness between my father and Mr. Potter is sending my thoughts whirling.
Draco pulled his suit jacket off completely and folded it neatly next to him. He uncuffed his shirt and rolled up the sleeves. Once done, he relaxed back against the wall, his feet still touching Harry’s.
“This Draco sounds like an arse,” Harry sighed into the wind as it whipped across his face, flapping his open jacket around him. “But, it’d be nice to have a bit of arse now and then.”
“Dumbledore liked to romanticize magic, but he knew as well as anyone that magic giveth and it taketh away. He brought down his own lover, Grindelwald, for the greater good. It is now your turn.”
Mrs Granger waved her hand while she dug through a pile of papers and files on her desk. “Pish posh. It’s my first holiday in ages from the office and to be honest I’ve no idea what to do with myself. I’m glad for the distraction. Is my daughter in any kind of trouble?”
At the mention of Lavender Brown, Harry had no choice but to listen to what Draco had to say. Filing a document without an official seal was grounds for an instant sacking. Draco only had to make the document he currently sported in his hands public, and Lavender would be out on the street.
Draco lips became pinched, as if what he was about to say was completely distasteful. “In order for my mind to stay human, I need constant stimulation. My body wants to turn into a tree, fully. Severus has caught me several times in the garden, awake but completely still, incapable of responding to his calls. So Severus experimented; he attempted to keep my mind alert throughout the whole day, by reading to me, quizzing me, and engaging me in conversation. That day I was fully cognizant, with no lapse in consciousness. But, and Severus has agreed of course, there are more useful things for him to be doing than talking at me. That is where you come in. You want to help? Chat away at me inanely and make sure I respond.”
The late night awakenings also led to the most revealing and intimate conversations between Harry and Draco. Draco's usual snarky and cold visage disappeared at night, or maybe Harry just had trouble seeing in the dark. But nonetheless, it was Draco that began the conversations with probing questions for Harry, and Harry couldn't help but answer them. A few nights in, Draco knew more about Harry than most of his friends, and after a week Draco knew more than even Hermione and Ron.
Harry's breathed out a sigh. He thought he would feel more relieved knowing Dean wasn't suffering because of him, but instead it just felt lonely.
“I didn’t lie about my orientation. I really am gay! I know you mean well, but really I am gay and so is Draco. I’m not leading him on or anything like that. We’re just, well, we’re just experimenting.”
But Voldemort was dead. No matter who had the body, or for what reason, the monster was never coming back. Harry had seen to it. There was no revival in the graveyard this time. Harry rubbed his forehead where his now faded scar lie dormant.
was still a solid object, although he did keep hold of his wand tightly in his right hand, just in case.
He arrived back at Draco's cottage in the afternoon, groggy and distracted. One of his trouser legs was caught inside his sock and his shirt was inside out.
This was Harry's morning routine. It was normal. It was typical. It was the same as any other witch or wizard of his station. He owned slippers. He ate toast. He carried a briefcase.
My father blushes, again, and tucks his hair behind his ear. “Thank you, Harry. Although I would have preferred you compliment me after you finished eating.”
I'm dropped to the ground. My arm is still over my eyes, so I can't see anything. I can hear voices, but underneath the spell they seem hazy, their timbre obscured.
Draco advanced rapidly on Harry, his voice lowering to a harsh whisper. “Don’t talk about that here! This is a Muggle place!”
So, Harry took in a big breath and began to work. He did not stop until five in the morning, just in time to see a spectacular sunrise.
“You're very lucky, Hayden. Had Harry not yelled out the Levitation charm in time, you might have been more seriously hurt.”
Then Draco brought Harry’s hand to his own crotch. Draco nodded to Harry, answering his unasked question. It took Harry a second, but soon he caught on and began to unzip Draco as well.
Harry came, pumping in Draco’s channel. Draco still hadn’t come, so he reached down to help him. His own dick growing soft, but still inside Draco.
'But I don't know exactly what you are doing,' Harry responded. 'By not giving me any clue as to what we are looking, for my mind is only going to think the worst. Perhaps I should follow Ron's advice and search your luggage for Voldemort's body.'
"So I thought, 'well then I should be in Gryffindor. I'm not a bad guy, I'm a good guy. I belong with other good guys.' So when McGonagall placed the Sorting Hat on my head, I thought I would hear Gryffindor, clear as day. But I didn't. Instead the Hat wanted me to be in Slytherin.
“That’s because it is ours. A smaller version was built for me when I was little and I have improved upon it since.”
Harry stopped. “What?” Draco pushed Harry back forcefully, almost forcing Harry out of Draco entirely.
Luna huffed and returned to working on the fore sail. Having heard many a witch and wizard mock Luna with nary a change in her disposition, it was a shock to Harry to see Luna react to Padma's statement in such a way.
Harry unstuck himself from the tree with a flick of the wrist and stood up. Draco raised his eyebrow at the lack of effort. Harry waved it away.
Draco yelled, 'No! I'm not leaving here until this hole tells us where to go. It's lying. It has to know where the Magical Cauldron is!'
I dare not look at my father. He thinks I don't know he's got copies of my maths and history books underneath his bed.
“Testing the life force. Sticks that have fallen more recently have more life force and therefore are easier to manipulate.”
“I've been reading a lot about trees. Want to know more about you, you know. When you turned into a tree? You know, Samhain? That was the month of the Elder. I guess that’s why you and Snape thought that was when you would turn.”
Thank you to all who helped me with research and cheered me on, including cleo_jay, tari_sue, thesamanthahope, and winnett.
Harry blushed. What else could Draco read? Oh Merlin, Harry had a mountain full of naughty thoughts about Draco and now was not the time to be revealing such things.
Harry then looked directly into Draco's eyes, so hard he could see the other man shift ever so slightly back. 'And regarding Dean, do not judge us for things you do not understand.'
Draco shoved Harry out of the door. Harry stumbled, but turned once he regained his balance, only to have Draco’s door slam closed in his face. He stood in shock for a few moments before moving away from the door and apparating home. Kreacher was waiting for him in the sitting room, holding a warm cup of tea. Harry sat heavily on his sofa and began to think.
“I heard a few rumors about Fred, but I didn’t listen to gossip that much. Harry, I believe that could be considered a sexual situation, but not really sexual interaction.”
“I mean I get why you went after Voldemort. That's how you're built, Harry. Always thinking of others before yourself. But then, your parents, they show up and tell you to continue! They tell you to keep going, just walk into death as if you were going to a Sunday picnic! Doesn't that make you angry?”
“I, I really don’t know what I want. I definitely don’t want it looking like Andromeda’s house. Beyond that, I really don’t know. I guess I like windows. Lots of windows.”
Perhaps it was the flood of blood in his heart, or the moonlight, but Harry loved to watch the light return into Draco's eyes. And Draco, as he returned to full awareness, would stare back into Harry's green eyes, allowing Harry to see the life grow vibrantly into Draco's gray ones. The life would rise, like steam,  and Harry watched every precious and beautiful moment. Draco was beautiful. How had Harry failed to notice?
Harry signalled to his crew to continue their search in the woods without him. Harry had other plans. He was going to go back to the other side of the lake to stop Draco from using the Magical Cauldron.
Walking toward Number 1 listening to the faint sound of a television playing as he made his way up the path, a large owl swooped down in front of him, barely escaping collision. Harry followed the bird's path as it swerved and dipped along the street to land perfectly on the perch on the light post in front of Number 4.
And for me, well I love bragging to my friends that my house is the best-looking one in the street, although, it really doesn’t get me very far.
Harry's office was to the right and in the back of his Department. It was small, but efficient, containing only a desk, two filing cabinets, and a small fern next to the door. Harry placed his travelling cloak on the coat rack and put his briefcase next to his desk.
This made Harry very concerned. In the modern world, there were no more uncharted territories. There were lands that were led by unknown leaders, there were islands that were less studied, there were animals and plants that were rare and unique, there were peoples with cultures that were foreign and strange, but there was never a complete absence of information. The unknown felt like an itch in the back of Harry's throat that he just could not scratch. He attempted to silently create a copy of the map in hopes of sending it someone, specifically Hermione, for more information, or at the very least to study the map himself in private, but the spell just did not work.
My father kicks me in the shins and gives me a look that threatens to turn into a lecture if I don’t keep quiet. I sigh and stab a piece of carrot with my fork, imagining it to be Mr. Potter’s arm.
After his seventh loop around the home the front door banged open, but instead of seeing an annoyed Draco, a large dark figure appeared in the doorway; his long black hair falling in front his face, his trousers black with matching black boots.
"I know, Harry. But it's the only way. I'm the leader. The Headmistress will believe that the Green Rebellion dies with me, but it doesn't. It will live on, changing minds and promoting equality one person at a time."
Harry flashed his credentials, the man stiffened. “Just a few questions. Are you familiar with Jim and Nancy Fletchley over on Clinton Ave?”
My father was always the type of man that would love his son. That's the Malfoy way. Sons are precious heirs, bred to be pillars of the pureblood community. They are a father’s pride, a tiny child to mold into greatness. They are reflections of their father, their father’s father, and all the generations of Malfoy men that had come before. They are tools as much as they are objects to be paraded, a feather in a father’s cap, so to speak.
“Draco has been keeping odd hours. I believe it is due to the transformation. He's been sleeping more during the day and waking in the night. Last night I woke to find Draco standing outside in the garden staring at the moon. He was unresponsive for an hour.
King Ascon shook his head, pushing himself closer and closer to the large cage, his eyes darting around the room.
Harry had told Kreacher he could stay at Hogwarts, but the house-elf was had developed an unflinching loyalty towards Harry. The constant mail kept him busy, and Harry feared for the old elf's health, but he seemed to enjoy destroying the pieces of fan mail in every increasingly creative ways.
Draco shook his head. “If you have difficulty coming up with anything intelligent to say, you can read to me. Severus was reading me Yeats.”
Unlike what had happened the day before, where memories came in an out like a strobe light, memories of the past few months, his time away from Draco, living as a Muggle police officer, came rushing back. He clung hard to Draco's hand in desperation.
I overheard my mother, in the midst of one of their many arguments, claim that my father refused to believe that I was his, at first.
'I sleep in the Captain's cabin, below the quarterdeck,' Harry replied, waving a wand to release the ropes that secured the ship to the dock.
Draco stepped forward, his hands in front of him, pulled together into a fist. “Of course I know it’s not normal, you twit. I’m only going to tell you this once, so listen up. My family healer has already seen my back and he says there is nothing he can do. He has no bloody clue what is going on. This man is quite familiar with curses and poisons, more so than the quacks at St. Mungo’s, and yet even he is dumbfounded.  I’ve looked up every bloody book in the Malfoy library, I’ve sent letters, and I’ve even gone to a Muggle doctor. The only thing they all know for certain is that the bark is growing and it’s the bark of an Elder tree. That’s it. End of story. Go home, Potter. This should relieve you of any nagging curiosity.”
“I didn’t understand it. I’d never really liked a boy before, but that’s how I felt. I hadn’t thought much beyond that at the time. There was a lot on my plate, with rebuilding Hogwarts and trying to figure out my future. But it was nice, to have you around. I missed you, a lot. Maybe I’ve grown delusional and you’re a figment of my imagination.”
“Wait! 100 Galleons? But, there wasn’t a consultation.You were barely here 5 minutes. You can’t just show up at my house, insult me, then demand I give you 100 Galleons. If I’m going to pay for a consultation then I should damn well get one!”
Harry noticed that Draco’s face was red and his leg was bouncing up and down, as if he were nervous, or about to start a running race.
Harry placed the Sorting Hat on Randolph's head. It took a moment, everyone holding their breath for the first sorting, and then:
Harry ran straight to him, grabbed his face, and took what he had been dreaming about since that morning, so many months ago, when he saw Draco in the bookshop. His lips devoured Draco's, taking in every thing Draco had to give. Their tongues met and lightening danced across his skin to his very toes.
Draco sighed heavily, turning towards the window again and tapping his fingers in a slow beat on the armrest.
Harry giggled into his own bun he was currently stuffing into his mouth. The two had been enjoying the meal for the last ten minutes, diving in hungrily into the roast and potatoes. Their words had been few due to the lack of breath between bites.
For a moment, Harry believed that the location he had called out must not have existed. Their journey would end here, as the land the map displayed surely was not real.
‘I’ve spoken with the giant squid,’ Luna answered. Harry was not surprised that Luna had spoken to the mollusc. But that was Luna. She always made it a point to speak to all creatures, no matter the species or ability to respond. ‘He’s found himself a nice lake, but sometimes he’s lonely. I’m sure he misses his brother.’
“Panicked! Panicked would be perhaps just saying that I was working on a project for Teddy’s birthday and it was a secret and leave it at that! How in the fifth level of hell did it end up being some sob story that even Lavender Brown, the same girl who believed that Ron Weasley enjoyed being called Won-Won, wouldn’t buy! And did you realize, in your great wisdom, that you just implied that you and I, that you and I, oh I can’t even say it.”
That child had resurfaced in Draco’s face today. His eyes had instantly sought out Harry, looking to him for help, but Harry had allowed Ollivander to take Draco away. The room they were speaking in had been muffled, but Harry could hear their quiet murmurings. It was enough to tell him that Draco was not being harmed physically.
But then Draco shuffled slowly closer. It was already a marvel that Draco had managed to move himself as far as he had. The bark had grown aggressive, growing over Draco's joints. Only Draco's hands, neck and face were uncovered. Draco could still sit, but it was just a matter of time until the bark would keep him from even that.
"I'll give you have credit for that Mr. Parkinson, but I'm going to have to ask that you sit in the back of the class for using the word 'Mudblood'. Miss Jadeson, you may move forward."
Harry ignored them and began to march into the woods, slashing the branches and leaves that stood in their way.
And to the surprise at everyone at the table Teddy grabbed the knight and ate the broccoli, chewing loudly with growling noises, until he was all done. He then repeated the process with each vegetable until his plate was clean.
Harry reluctantly sat on the beige sofa Mrs Granger led him too, sitting as far forward as possible. “No, just wanted to ask her a few questions in regards to an old neighbour of hers, Mrs Boot.”
Dean placed a hand on his shoulder. 'I've got watch tonight, Harry. Take a shower, and go to sleep.'
The Great Hall burst into chaos. Students stood and cheered, gathering Sara up, and all the other first years, on their shoulders, parading them around. Someone started chanting, "Go Green, Go Green!" Someone else spelled everyone's clothes to be green. The bands came out, and the berets, and to Harry it looked as though the entire school was Slytherin. Harry wondered if Salazar Slytherin would be happy about it. Probably not considering how many Muggle-borns and half-bloods were now in his house.
Draco was surprising calm about the matter. His eyes betrayed no fear or concern. To Harry, they looked as if they were smiling.
Harry ran, and ran. Finally he reached the clearing. Voldemort’s mangled body was lying in the corner, long ago forgotten.
I have no desire to touch his Cornflakes, but I move the plastic container and hide it behind the toaster, just to mess with his head. I reach into the fridge to pull out the milk and there is a note attached.
But Harry needed to stay strong. “Draco,” Harry stated, firm, perhaps a bit breathy considering Draco’s knee was still pressing against his now rock-hard erection.
Harry took a nap and woke up at eight, waiting for Draco, making sure to make Draco's favorite breakfast: eggs benedict.
The man looked up finally, his bright grey eyes growing wide at the sight of Harry. At first, Harry thought he had just startled the man, considering it was early and most people didn’t expect to have guests at the crack of dawn. But then something stirred inside Harry, something drilled deep down in his mind. He blinked a few times as his toes and fingers began to tingle. Images began to flood through his mind; his dreams that had been forgotten upon waking were now rushing back, solidifying into memory. He clung to them, like a man reaching for falling leaves, refusing to let them shimmer away as they had done so many times before.
Parkinson groaned and moved to the back of the class, disappointment etched on his face. Miss Jadeson squeaked and moved forward, obviously happy.
Harry and Andromeda were inside making last minute snacks and desserts for the children. Hermione and Ron came into the kitchen to retrieve the last of the platters. Harry followed them out into the lawn.
“Of course, design whatever you want. I trust your judgment better than my own. As long as I get to see the plans before you start building I’ll be happy. Remember the windows, I like windows.”
“Oh yes. Most think you’re somewhere in Egypt, fighting an evil mummy or some rot. I always knew it was nonsense. I saw you go down there. I heard Hermione warn you.”
"Because the family members didn't do anything! And even if they did, they were not convicted. Why are we punishing innocent civilians? What's next, sisters, uncles, nephews, cousins? These people haven't gone to trial, or some of them have and they were exonerated. Why are they being punished anyway? It doesn't make sense and it's wrong."
in response, sending a flock of goldfinches at his head. Nott leapt out of the way, banishing the birds as he fell.
"Mister Potter, you may go. I believe I have some things I need to take care of before this evening's Sorting. Please remember our agreement. You will support the Sorting Hat's decision and you will vouch for his validity." She began to raise her wand.
And with clarity came the realization that Draco was sitting across from him, legs crossed, his face impassively staring at Harry.
But I know he doesn’t. Even though It’s perfectly legal for my father to do magic in his own home, he doesn’t, unless it’s necessary.
"All of the teachers try to collect them and read them, but no one has figured it out. I know Draco has been close. He claims it's a password, but no one can figure out the code."
He sticks out his hand in front of me. There's black hair on his knuckles and calluses on his fingertips. After a few minutes of staring, I tentatively reach out my own hand and Mr. Potter, no Harry grabs it and shakes it, his grip crushing my poor delicate bones. I smile half-heartedly when he releases my hand, hiding it behind my back and shaking out the pain.
Harry sighed, “Yeah, tomorrow is going to be great. I have no idea what the tree house is going to look like, since you keep your super-secret tree house plans under lock and key, but I know its going to be great. Teddy’s going to love it, and we’re going to have so much fun exploring every nook.”
Draco turned around, walking slowly up to Harry. He got so close Harry could count the eyelashes around Draco’s eye. He got up to twenty when he felt a hand brush his crotch.
Harry pulled Teddy into his arms, stalling for time until he thought of something to say. The way Teddy spoke reminded him so much of Dudley it scared him. Harry could remember overhearing a similar conversation between Dudley and Aunt Petunia where he whined on for hours asking why Harry had to live with them and why couldn’t they just make Harry leave.
He was going to mutually wank with Draco Malfoy, lover of all things evil and kicker of puppies. What did mutually wank mean really? Did that mean they wanked next to each other? Did that mean that they wanked on each other? Or, did it mean the impossible, that he would wank Draco and Draco would wank him? He was going to faint. It really didn’t matter that this was Draco Malfoy because someone was going to touch his cock, willingly.
Harry ignored Draco's jibe as his heart dropped to his stomach. For the first time, Harry felt unsafe on board the
Harry thought Draco would be happy. He expected to see a large smile on the man’s face. Instead, his face was pulled in and his eyes had glazed over. Fawkes was on his shoulder, his head slung low, singing a soft trill.
Padma grabbed a thin broom from Dean more harshly than intended, throwing the First Mate off balance. Harry was there to support him as he fell backwards, but Dean shied away from his hands, moving quickly away to mount his own broom. Harry looked up to see Draco watching him intently, a strange look in his eyes. Still annoyed after the morning shower intrusion, Harry mounted his brand new Firebolt X and headed to the front of the group.
"Oh no you don't mister. You get your bum in the office and we're going to review the case. My guess is that you've bungled it up somehow."
“While I always enjoyed the company of my late husband’s sister, I never liked her son-in-law. I was told that her children would not be there, but that was not the case. The day went well until just a few moments ago. That man told Teddy, if you can believe it, that without a mum or dad Teddy would grow up to be a criminal, a murderer, or something worse. He was trying to convince his mother-in-law to press charges and take Teddy away, to a more stable family environment.”
Harry's blurted 'no' was loud enough for all the crew to hear. They all turned to look at Harry, which just made his cheeks flame. He turned his embarrassment to angered annoyance towards Draco, whispering harshly to the man. 'Oh, sod off, Malfoy! There is nothing between Dean and I anymore. So stop your ridiculous speculation.'
Then there was a sound. A sad, sweet calling that came from the west. The forlorn song that perfectly matched how Harry's heart was shattering.
Harry took out his phone and instantly dialled headquarters. “Hey, can I get a patrol car to 134 East Clinton Street? It’s where the Fletchleys are staying. Ta.”
Dean was on the other side of the door looking concerned. 'Harry, I think you need to come on deck.'
“I’m not seeing anyone! And, Hermione, I would hope that you keep your presumptions to yourself. Ron, you may be mistaking my happiness with my excitement over Teddy’s birthday. Can we drop this please?”
“You mock me? You know it’s true. You saw how it was for me during the war, and after. Everyone thought I was a Death Eater. Thanks for the testimony by the way.”
Harry sighed and sat next to Teddy, peering over his should to take a closer look at his masterpiece. Teddy just moved away.
All hilarity stopped when Draco reached down and unceremoniously grabbed Harry’s cock. Harry moaned deep in this throat and began to thrust into Draco’s hand, the feel of his smooth skin like silken sheets running back and forth on his tender cock.
The boy from the article. The one that didn't want to be sorted into Slytherin for fear that the friends he would make would disappear once he was sorted with the snakes.
“Because I don’t want any magic interfering with the wood until I start building. I told you this was a delicate process. But you are in luck. Today we start the building.”
Ron attempted to continue, but there was a knock on the door. Harry panicked, as he was not supposed to have personal Fire calls during working hours.
“I think he needs to remain outdoors, and to have constant supervision. Unfortunately, I have already scheduled a visit with a Chinese herbologist who studies tree spirits. I will be gone for a few days, so I need to you stay here with Draco. With his condition I think it best that Draco remain outside as much as possible. As for you, I have purchased a tent.”
Mr. Potter continues to just stand there, beside the bed, twirling his wand. Robes, wands, all these magical objects are making me nervous.
Harry was unsure what to say, until he remembered Ron was still on Firecall. 'Ron, can I call you back later? I seem to have a visitor.'
Neville reached out and placed his hand on Harry's shoulder, a little unsure as to what was going on.
"By the way, how many of them have you not beaten off with a stick? I usually like to know if I'm about to pop someone's cherry."
There were several things scattered across the room that Harry recognize, but didn't know the origin, his degree hanging on the wall, a sword mounted above his fireplace that looked authentically old, a picture of him in front of a train waving to someone in the distance. Harry scratched his head and sank deeper into his chair. The doctors said it was amnesia, that he might retrieve his memories back someday, or he might not. Thank god for the Chief and the department or else Harry might have been utterly lost.
Without warning, Padma shot out her arrows, pinning King Ascon to his throne. This time, Padma made sure to pin both arms. She also managed to pin the King’s neck, shooting an arrow straight through the man’s collar, trapping his throat so he wouldn’t be able to speak.
“You are not expecting anyone because I am here. Which Malfoy did you expect to see today? My mother?”
Harry could feel the train stop, but he didn’t recognize the scenery outside. It just continued to be a blur of green and brown from the trees. He sat up straight and attempted to fix his clothing.
Draco began to walk out of the room, his back towards Harry. “He will contact you when it is time to make a new wand. Goodbye, Potter. I'm keying the wards to keep you out. Don't bother coming back here.”
Harry's thoughts had been so completely overrun with concern over the Elder Wand that when Malfoy began discussing it, Harry had responded, and for the first time in history he and Malfoy were having an actual conversation. His question had just made it seem like he wanted the conversation to end, which couldn't be further from the truth. It was just that if Harry had a family right now he would be with them, leaning on them for support.
The previous night Harry had confessed to his almost death at the Final Battle, of seeing Dumbledore at the station and having to walk, knowingly, into death.
In the second greatest idea Harry had ever had, beside the creation of the bell in the first place, Harry wandlessly (and to this day Harry has no idea how he was able to pull off this feat) cut off the leather strap from Draco's neck, shrunk it, and reattached it firmly around Draco's cock.
Mr. Potter reaches down and grabs my father's hand, linking his chubby, greasy fingers with my father's long and tapered ones.
I pick up my fork and wave it around madly, exaggerating the movements I’ve seen my father make, a strange manic laugh falling from my lips.
After a while, it was not enough. Draco pushed Harry down onto the bed and roughly yanked up his knees, hooking his arms around them. He then began to thrust harder than before, so hard that Harry felt like he could feel Draco’s cock all the way up to the tip of his head.
I pause and stare at Mr Potter, whose normally stern and stoic face has a bright smile. I'm not sure what to say. I'm surprised he saved me, surprised he cared enough to even bother. I'm also surprised that the beefy man has dimples. Who knew?
Draco reached into his pocket and withdrew what looked to be an index card. He spelled it bigger, along with a quill.
“We couldn’t find any prints, but we did find a small scratch in one of the walls. No tissue, but there a small red substance smeared. Our boys almost didn’t catch it. Our lab guy says it's nail polish.”
Harry flipped Draco the bird, playfully, while Draco stuck his tongue out. “Seriously, Potter, who came up with that idea for a disguise? A fat Potter is still a Potter.”
Harry moved from sitting opposite Draco to sitting next to the man. Draco raised his eyebrows, but Harry just shrugged and took one of Draco’s hands.
The squid was silent. He blinked slowly, a drip of water falling from the eye. After a few minutes, the squid spoke. ‘You are a wise human. Please, if you see my brother again, ask him if I can visit.’
'My goldfinch. Where is my goldfinch? Do you have my goldfinch? My poor goldfinch. My one and only goldfinch.'
My socks are mending. I can feel the material underneath my toes re-stitch itself. My back aches less, though not by much, but my headache remains.
'Hello, Draco. I apologise for biting you, but you wouldn't let me sit on your shoulder.' Luna turned her head and raised a finger. ‘And I don't think you should use your owl. Harry doesn't like them. But don't worry, I'm a much better carrier than an owl any day.'
But now, instead of a tall stately Elder tree, its branches out and full of leaves, there now stood a very strange sight.
The living room has a large fireplace that my father always keeps lit, even in the summer, which is just one of the wizarding habits he can’t break. There are a few of those, like keeping his wand with him at all times, even though he doesn’t use it. He used to keep it up his sleeve, but now he just jams it into his back pocket or behind his ear, and if we go out he shrinks it and wraps it around his wrist like a bracelet. He thought it looked girly, but I reminded him that Lance Armstrong wears bracelets, albeit yellow rubber ones, which I wear as well, not because my favorite cyclist wears them, but because yellow is my favorite color. And yes, I realize Lance Armstrong is a bloody Yank, but he's a damn-good cyclist, pardon my language. And when my mates give me shit about it, I just yell back, “You win seven Tour de France with one testicle, then!”
“But the point is my father doesn't do any magic. So you can leave now. You've done your duty, checked up on us, and we're fine. I'm sure you have spies all over the neighborhood and I'm sure they'd tell you the same thing. Leave my father and me alone. We don't want you here, you ill-mannered Neanderthal!”
He was going to come, but he was determined to make Draco come first. He stared into Draco’s eyes and saw his glance at Harry’s lip when he bit into it. So he leaned forward and kissed Draco.
Mr Potter is large, not in height, but in width. He's not fat, just bulky, full of muscle and gruffness, an ogre of a man compared to us pin-thin Malfoys. He looks like a bull in a china shop in our small cottage, constantly bumping into the walls and almost knocking over the ceramic bowl I made in art class. His figure takes up most of the guest room, barely squeezing through the space between the bureau and the bed.
The man had thrown off most of his sheets and now lay only partially covered on the bed, one arm thrown over his eyes, the other over his rising chest. Harry stared at Draco's small pert nipple peaking out from underneath his elbow. All the past memories of his relationship with Dean, and Harry's recent unwittingly adopted celibacy for the past few years, meant that Harry was easily aroused by a gorgeous man, even if it was Draco Malfoy.
Harry hid his face behind his hand. That time was not something he wanted to think about. Why was Draco bringing it up now? Harry's heart began to beat wildly and it was hard to catch a breath.
"You jump to conclusions so fast. The newsletter is a project one of my students came up with a few years back. We had the same exact assignment I just assigned this class. His idea for change was to have a newspaper compiled of student submissions about oppression. He felt he couldn't change the minds of adults or influence a change in laws, but he could change other students' minds about the world around them, and then when they graduated, they would carry those lessons into adulthood. I agreed and we have continued the newsletter ever since."
“Nothing is going to happen. We’re friends. We’ll probably see each other from time to time. Teddy’s going to want to invite him over and we’ll probably invite him and his mother over for dinner. But beyond that, I think the other stuff will probably stop tomorrow.”
Harry should have been listening to what Draco was saying. This was important stuff, stuff he should be concerned about, stuff concerning a very valuable and dangerous magical artifact. Instead Harry had been distracted by Malfoy’s scarf that had loosened, displaying Draco’s pale smooth neck. Harry watched Draco’s neck move with each of his words. It was absolutely fascinating to see the vein at the side of his neck move with each breath, the jaw move with each consonant. How had Harry missed this part of the human body? Harry had the odd urge to reach out and feel Draco’s jaw as he talked. Would if feel like his own jaw? Would there be stubble or just baby smooth skin?
“I'm sorry, Chief, won't happen again,” he teasingly responded back to Kingsley, before leaning up and kissing Draco full on the mouth.
Harry had bigger things to worry about, like what Draco Malfoy was really up to and if Harry wanted any part of it.
Harry pleaded. “No! I swear. I just want to see what we are dealing with so I can help you! I promise no perverted thought will cross my mind when I see it.”
Harry smirked and gathered Draco, mess and all, into his arms. He made sure to pull the frilly blue knickers all the way off and hide them under his pillow, for later.
Harry headed towards him, stopping to stand next to him slightly closer than he had in the days before.
At this point, Harry was the only person that would understand what Draco was going through. Perhaps, in part, it was why Draco had searched out for his help.
Finally, Draco reached his prize, those glorious knickers that fit so snuggly. Draco hooked his thumb on both sides and pulled them down, but did not remove them completely.
"No! No one can say it. I was a fool to say it myself. It's hurtful, ghastly, and I will spend the rest of my life making sure no one else even utters the phrase again."
“You did what you could. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your testimony. You have no idea what it meant to me to see that you understood. You didn’t blame me. I never knew you were on the Astronomy Tower until my trial. It felt so good to know that you saw me pause, you saw me consider, because no one believed me. You could have dismissed it as fear, but you didn’t. And I don’t know how you knew about my time at the Manor, about how I didn’t want to torture and kill, but you did. That’s why I came to help. I had to. I wanted to help you, needed to. I needed to help you so badly.”
He could feel Draco coming as well, the hot goo flying onto his chest. He hazily watched Draco's orgasmic face, the round “O” of his lips, the hair flying in every direction, the cheeks flaring red. Draco opened his eyes and stared down at Harry as the last of his orgasm ripped through him. There was something savage in that look, something primal that instantly connected with Harry. This wasn't just good sex, this wasn't just great sex, this wasn't just fantastic sex, this was the sex. The one that could never be topped no matter how many different partners or positions or toys were brought into the mix. This was it, and they both knew it.
'Ship. I think those braids have rattled your mind,” Harry retorted with a snort. 'I've never known you to have this sort of humour.'
I can't tell if the voice belongs to my father, as it currently sounds like a regretful house-elf begging to iron his ears with an added hiss of a bike tire running out of air. My brain throbs, my back aches.
As the years ran by, the word became softer, said with a flippant air and a flick of the hair until both of us fell into giggles. It was such a funny word, and hard to say, notorious. It sounded like a foreign language, or perhaps something a fine lady would say while drinking tea in tiny china cups. I didn't learn the word’s definition until I was much older, and by then my father had stopped saying it altogether.
Caught in the nostalgic annoyance of Draco’s jibes and pranks, Harry had failed to hear his friend’s approach.
Last Christmas Hermione gave Teddy a lovely large reference book on wolves, which should have been the perfect gift considering Teddy's parentage. Unfortunately the book was filled with detailed pictures of wolves hunting, which gave Teddy nightmares for a week. He even refused to sleep with his favorite night-time buddy Mooney, his stuffed animal wolf.
Harry shook his head and continued to run. 'I don't know where Draco is. He wants to destroy the Magical Cauldron. If he does, he dies.'
I fly from my bedroom and into the hallway, my hands waving in front of me, my yellow-socked feet slipping on the hardwood floor. Had I not steadied myself on the wood banister I might have knocked over my father, who is currently balancing on the shaky pull-down steps that leads to our dusty attic. He gives me an aggravated sigh and hands me a box.
Harry bent forward, placing his elbows on his knees and resting his forehead on his palms. “I'm sorry for falling asleep on your floor. Thank you for moving me to the sofa and providing me with a blanket.”
Draco's words were slurred by his slow stretches on the ground. He was like a slow moving cat, arms reaching out towards the warm sun.
Harry took the scroll from the bird’s surprisingly sharp talons that were currently digging deep into his shoulder. Finally, it was a response from Malfoy – he recognized the fancy paper.
Arriving home late, Harry went straight to the scotch, pouring himself two fingers into a glass tumbler and settling himself down into his worn leather chair. Taking a slow look around the room, Harry smiled at the photograph of him and the Chief celebrating his twenty-fifth birthday at the local pub. He couldn't remember the night, his twenty-fifth, the day six months before his accident, but Harry enjoyed seeing the goofy look on the Chief's face as Harry shyly smiled for the camera.
Draco pulled his arms tighter around himself. “And how would he know that?” Draco then blushed hard. “Your house-elf spied on me in the shower? Not only are you a nosy parker, you’re a bloody pervert! I can't believe you sent your house-elf to spy on me in the shower. Did his description of me washing my naughty bits get your rocks off?”
was put to shore, he continued to explore the globe with no signs of stopping. But there was a fear that woke Harry up in the middle of the night sometimes. He worried that it had been something else keeping Dean. Harry worried that he had made a mistake and their few times together, times Harry had regretted almost immediately after they happened, made it impossible for Dean to leave.
Draco began to walk out the door, but turned back at the last minute, kissing Harry lightly on the lips. Harry lifted his hands to his lips.
Once Harry felt stabilized, he then searched for the rest of the crew and discovered that they were all having similar issues. Each were slowly reaching out and testing the stability of the cloud material around them. Only Luna seemed unaffected, still in her goldfinch form flying around the billowy white substance that once was their ship.
George laughed, “God no! It’s been years since I've been to Surrey. Mum married a rich bloke in Perth and told me to make something of myself, so I'm here, making something of myself.”
, seemed terribly trite. Would it be better just to wrap his arms around him to give him a bit of last minute comfort? Would Draco even want that?
They continued to work later into the afternoon. Andromeda had decided to take Teddy to visit one of her late husband’s relatives, so Harry had no urge to cook a huge meal. On days like this he usually ordered take away. He wondered if Draco was thinking of staying for dinner.
Harry ran up to Cindy on the front lawn to greet her, but she lifted hand to block Harry's progress.
Suddenly a door appeared on the floor. It opened, flooding the hole with a golden light. Harry and Draco stared in amazement as a tiny goblin appeared out of the door and onto the hole floor, shutting the door behind it.
Draco slumped back, his hands falling away from Harry’s, his mouth open and slanted, each breath coming in a short pant. “We have to do something.”
Harry leaned in. “Come on, I’ve heard from many a source that a single pout from me could soften even the meanest ogre.”
is that any normal person, suffering under your horrid bad luck, would be dead. And yet, here you are, alive and kicking. Or sleeping against a wall, as the case may be.”
Harry held the open door for a while before shutting it behind him and walking back into the dining room.
“Shut up, Draco,” Pansy responded. Harry could tell she was attempting to sound as if she was teasing Draco, but there was an edge to her voice subtly underneath. Harry didn't like it.
In response to Harry's accusation, Draco's face had paled of colour and his mouth was left open wide.
Once the glass finished falling, Harry continued his chase, Draco hot on his heels. Wand up, he threw open the door to a small throne room. King Ascon was sitting on the highest chair, softly singing to Luna, who was still in her cage.
“I assure you the original Manor is still sitting on the ground, but as we were told by the Ministry that several curses had been accidentally triggered by their inept searches for Dark artifacts, we no longer can live within the residence. We were reluctant to sell the property as the curse has a shelf life of 95 years, give or take. We may not be able to live in the Manor, but my grandchildren will. So for the time being we had to make alternative living arrangements. The tree house seemed the most logical place to move, and with a little research I was able to create a home for my family that befits our lifestyle. After that, many of my family’s friends were envious and enlisted my services. Thus Malfoy Architecture began.”
Easy? My father knew he was going to be arrested and instead of ranting and raving, like I would expect him to do, he invites the stupid sod to dinner and yells at me for wanting him to leave!
Harry tried to hold his tongue, but it had other ideas. “I only promised to watch my thoughts, not my hands.”
Dean spoke first. 'As soon as you and Malfoy disappeared behind those trees, the fishing boat landed on our shore of the lake. Harry, it was Rastaban Lestrange. And he wasn't alone.'
I roll my eyes and put the orange juice back in the fridge. Sometimes I think my father uses his magic to figure out what I’m thinking.
But they were both saved from conversation by the crash of the door downstairs and the rumble up the stairs. Teddy was home and sounded to be in a bad mood. He threw open the door and ran at Harry, demanding to be picked up. Teddy was getting a little big, so Harry struggled, but he could feel the little boy shaking. Andromeda came up fast on his heels.
'Yes, well, thank you for that. It's what every boy wants to hear when his father just dies, how much people hated him.'
'We're not here to hurt you, we just want to ask you some questions. We spoke to a goblin in the woods. She said perhaps you might know a thing or two about the island.'
“Kreacher, when you followed Malfoy in sixth year, did you notice any strange dark colouring on the back of his neck?”
to tell Harry first thing in the morning. The rambling stories usually only served to delay his schedule, but as Ron's only male companionship amongst a household of girls, Harry felt obliged to listen to him. He leaned closer to the small flame to hear Ron better.
“Master Draco is pale white all over except for a trio of freckles right above his left hip, a crisscross of faint scars on his chest, and a large patch of skin from his neck to his buttocks that has become bark.”
“Permanent Sticking Charms are hard to get rid of, Potter. Planning on becoming part of my tree house?”
That moment was always the worst for Harry. His heart stopped cold upon seeing Draco's blank face. It was as if ten elephants had decided to sit on his heart, the heavy weight slowly squishing the life out. There was a ringing in his ears and his hands shook.
Harry fell down onto the ground, his knees hitting the hard wood. According to Ollivander, Harry was being called to harvest the new Elder Wand; to pluck the life from the tree to make a new wand.
After the incident at Ollivanders my mother wanted to send me off, like a broken toy, to an Orphanage for Squibs, and try again for a real son. My grandfather agreed with her, and my grandmother stood by her husband. It was only my father who disagreed. Against the wishes of his wife and his parents, my father moved me to the one place where I wouldn’t be a failure or a dud, and that was the Muggle world.
"Go back upstairs and take a shower. You’re sweating like a pig and you probably smell. I won't have a smelly teenager in front of company."
I open my mouth wide. I'm in shock. I really am. My tongue wags in my mouth, but I can't get it to move properly. I'm ready to spill everything, own up to the fact that I snooped around Mr. Potter’s dirty underwear and smelly socks and found a very incriminating piece of evidence that proves that Mr. Potter is up to no good, and not actually here to visit my father, but the tosser has the audacity to lay his hands on my father’s shoulders and smile at me as if I’m a poor simpleton child who can’t save his father from his inevitable fate.
The guilt waved over Harry's body. His mouth tasted bitter and his stomach plummeted to his knees. 'I thought I told you not to talk to me about Dean.' Harry replied stiltedly, his tongue dry and heavy.
has the magical ability of locating any place, no matter how difficult. I need that ship to fulfil my destiny.'
For five minutes, Harry allowed himself to enjoy the morning cuddles before gently rolling out from underneath Draco and heading to the shower.
Harry tried to think of something else to say, he really did, but without the insults and the weight of war between them, Harry struggled to find a starting point for a conversation. He had no idea why he was trying so hard, but there was some hope, as Draco was still standing next to the sofa, a book in his arms.
“I meant that I was glad it was memorable too, and that it was with you. I’m, well, I’m a virgin too. Or at least I was a half an hour ago.”
Draco sat down on the edge of the seat across from Harry, his head hung low. Harry had the sudden urge to comfort the man, but that’s not how things worked. Draco was Draco. Harry was Harry. Or did that matter any more?
Ollivander began to approach Harry, his face stern. “The wand's magic is death itself. Do you think that a mere human could end it? Death is eternal, as is the magic that was in that wand.”
Cindy sat on Neville's desk, her legs spread and her combat boots hitting the wood, making a clang clang noise. Good think she preferred baggy trousers to skirts, or else Harry would be seeing more of Cindy than he wanted. Neville sat down on his chair, lips reddened with the ferocity of the earlier kiss and a dazed look on his face.
Padma yanked into the King’s robe and pulled off the key from around his neck. She ran toward Luna’s cage, quickly unlocking it and releasing Luna. Luna instantly transformed, her eyes wide at Padma. Padma ignored Luna’s questioning stare and instead concentrated on checking her person for injuries.

And in the middle of the broken cauldron was the lifeless, yet otherwise unharmed body of Draco Malfoy.
I lift my eyebrow at my father's spoiled behavior, but Harry seems to enjoy it, sporting a smitten, indulgent smile.
I roll my eyes and put the orange juice back in the fridge. Sometimes I think my father uses his magic to figure out what I’m thinking.
Harry nodded, biting his tongue to stop himself from lashing out and demanding that Draco throw the cauldron back into the water and forget about his mission entirely.
Draco turned, his face pink. He tightened his scarf and quickly walked out of the garden, ignoring Harry’s calls for his return.
Draco walked briskly towards the backdoor leaving a very confused Harry still by the trees. It wasn’t until Draco was right at the door that the meaning of what Malfoy said hit him.
It was the first time that Draco had smiled since Harry had arrived. It was so beautiful; the lips thin and pink, his chin dimpling slightly. Harry hoped he could continue to make Draco smile.
While the students piled in Harry found himself a spot near the corner where he could see and hear everything. He sat down, gathering the Cloak around him, and waited with the other students.
Draco was sitting very still, his face slightly titled towards the window. His arms were laid flat on the armrests of the chair, the fingers spread wide. His legs were covered with a thick wool blanket, much too hot for the fall day. He frowned at Harry as he entered, and then returned to looking out of the window.
"Harry, it's fine. I like the fact that the world goes by you without you noticing it. Makes it easier to fob off work."
"You gave up your life for all of us. Let me take the fall for the Sorting Hat. It pales in comparison to your sacrifice."
Oh Merlin, he knew about the Elder wand, how he and Draco had broken it. How did he know? How did he find out?
Groaning, I take my time heading downstairs, poking my head around the boxes already on the floor and attempt to calculate in my head how many hours it will take to put everything up. Too long is the final answer and my stomach is growling.
‘I really don’t know anything,’ he sighed regrettably. ‘The Magical Cauldron was only a myth when I arrived 600 years ago.’
Harry knocked on the door before opening it slowly, wanting to prolong the anticipation of seeing all the smooth pale skin.
Malfoy was picking at the grass as he spoke. Harry had never heard so much from Draco before. Growing up he knew three things about Draco Malfoy: number one, Malfoy is a git, number two, Malfoy is a good Quidditch Player, and number three, Malfoy is always up to no good. But where did this fact fall into? When did Malfoy have hobbies? When did Draco become a person?
After a few moments, Draco finally responded, but with a more serious tone, 'I can't make any promises, Potter. I've never been on this island and I'm not a Seer.'
The group all took a large gulp of air and looked around to each other. Padma had wrapped a tight protective arm around Luna's shoulder. Dean was healing a scratch on Finn's face.
But, to my surprise, I'm not the one most excited at the prospect of dessert. Growling loudly, Harry's stomach shows his appreciation by conducting a rock concert of rumbling noises. He shrugs and winks at me, his thick eyebrows attempting to wiggle, but not really working.
I pause, looking behind me again, before I lift the folder out of the suitcase. I bet this is a case file, full of criminal acts and bad guys. My hands itch to open it and I'm not very good at controlling my impulses.
He hadn’t seen the Malfoys. It was just as well. He felt bad for hiding in the kitchen and doing what he promised he wouldn’t do, leaving Draco alone with the Weasleys. Draco probably also thought Harry hated the tree house. To make up for it, Harry promised himself he would write him a note to thank Draco and to tell him how much he loved it.
Harry maneuvered Draco so his head was snuggly fit underneath his chin and his deliciously silky legs were wrapped around his hips.
My father laughs. "So Twelfth Night this year will be extra special. We’ll celebrate both the end of Christmas and the end of my Probation. Sound good?"
Draco shook his head. 'It tells us nothing about who lives on the island. But considering the amount of tree growth and the lack of sound, I would say there aren't many, if any at all.'
A woman with short black hair and a pinched nose, wearing only a skimpy bathrobe and nothing else, leaned out of the front door, her blood red nails clashing sharply with the pale green frame.
Harry took a step back and instructed his crew to stop. 'Scan the cages, tell me if you see a person,' he whispered.
“Good luck, Potter.” Snape then stepped forward, his lanky hair swinging in front of his face. “And if I come back to find that you have abandoned Draco, I will find you and chop you into potion ingredients.”
A sharp cough brought him back to the present and he returned back to the book, realizing he was on the last page. Now this was a masterpiece. It was clearly a replica of Malfoy Manor, but without the trees surrounding the building, even below, he would have never have imagined that this large manor was built 20 feet from the ground.
Afterwards, neither of them had attempted to communicate with each other. Harry had assumed that what happened was a mistake never to be repeated again. He wasn't naïve enough to believe that this was the start of something beautiful, as Luna would say. That was a fuck, a hard and dirty fuck with a man he still hated. But, much to Harry’s chagrin, he began to crave that sound of the bell, needing to repeat the soft high-pitched noise in order to come.
Most Muggles have their decorations down by the sixth of January, lest some evil witch or wizard comes to curse them with bad luck, but in the Malfoy home we do the exact opposite.
My body is frozen and then carried down the stairs. I can feel what's going on around me, but I can't move my head to look around. I feel the magic, circling my body in waves. While Squibs can't do magic, we aren't considered Muggles because we can still feel magic. We know, instinctively, that it exists and yet we can't perform it ourselves. We contain a magical core, it's just completely empty, like a wooden bowl without the decorative plastic fruit. Seems rather pointless.
As the woman lifted what appeared to be another meat magazine, this one devoted to steak, Harry spied a letter addressed to Harry Potter.
I run up the stairs, taking two at a time, determined to protect my father from the beefy idiot who has invaded our home.
He still hadn’t heard anything from Malfoy by the next day, but he tried not to worry. These things take time, he told himself. Most likely Draco had gone and spent his 100 Galleons on a new wardrobe and needed time to sort through his new outfits, the poncy git.
Draco's shoulders drooped. “It's a spell, Harry. A spell you used to do often, although not very well. Does the Ministry know you're here? Where were you? They wouldn't tell me where you were. Wouldn't let me see you. Said it was Healer's orders.” Draco took a step forward and began to scan the street as well. “Is that who you're looking for? Kingsley is going to kill me for talking to you.”
Draco smirked, as if what Harry had said had revealed more that it should. 'Oh no, there is something else going on here, Potter. You have piqued my interest.' Draco stepped forward, his face coming impossibly close to Harry's, enough for Harry to smell his musky cologne. 'And when my interest is piqued, I never stop until that interest is
, Harry thought. Draco had been kind enough to let him help, let him into his world of tree house building, and then Harry repaid that action by paying more attention to Draco’s bum than what he was doing. He deserved the tongue-lashing Draco had given him.
Teddy had tried to talk to him for years about politics and current events, but Harry never listened. He'd rather talk about Quidditch, or family gossip. Truthfully, after Voldemort, politics and current events hardly interested him. He was tired, or so he claimed, of saving the world. He got out of that business.
Realizing they were outnumbered, Lestrange and Nott began to run into the forest. Harry and his crew ran after them. Arrows flew ahead as Harry yelled out
Considering Christmas was similar to what we were used to back in Wiltshire, we were quite surprised to find ourselves the only ones in our street with ribbons on our trees and grindylow-like scarecrows on our front lawn. But my father and I enjoy the celebration and it proves to be a great talking point with our neighbors, so it stuck.
“And you were supposed to tell me about the wonderful world of homosexuality. That hasn’t happened yet, so I’m not touching another stick.”
Harry was growing tired of Malfoy’s snide comments. At first, he thought they were mildly funny, then somewhat amusing, and now they were downright irritating. They just never ended. No matter what Harry did or said Malfoy had something to say about it.
“Hayden,” my father rubs the space between his eyes and his nose while Mr Potter rubs his shoulders, “do you wish to ruin this dinner? Do you hate having company so much that you would sabotage this night?”
Padma had no reply for Luna. Harry smiled, thankful for the distraction, but glad to have the rest of the night to himself.
Snape didn't even blink. “Of course. It is what is necessary. Don't think for a second that love is greater than magic. Magic will win every time.”
Hermione Flooed over in her excitement to present Harry with several reference books she just happened to pick up. The few things Hermione attempted to explain to him made his head hurt and the book Hermione left for him to look at,
Harry resumed his trip to his bedroom determined to write a thank you note to Draco, for not only the tree house but for Teddy’s gift; it really was thoughtful.
Taking a breath, Harry took a step back, throwing his wet hair out of his face, and tried to think about the situation at hand. This wasn't supposed to happen! He should have known. He should have listened to his instincts.
“You know nothing, Draco. You have no right to judge me and my actions. I have done everything for this family. Never doubt my loyalty to family again. It is insulting and a lie. Perhaps it was mistake to shield you from the petty squabbles of sisters, but it seems that perhaps it would be wise to let you know what you are getting into by spending so much time with my dear sister. She never understood the importance of family. She defied Mother and Father at all turns. While I understand that she believed herself to be in love, the man was unsuitable for her. She was forced to live in the Muggle world and hide her ability. How is that equal or fair? She refused to see reason and refused to speak to us! Once she ran away with that man she stopped all communication. I did not even know she had a daughter until she attended Hogwarts and Severus wrote me a letter. Do you understand how humiliating that was?”
The sudden question jerked Draco from his concentration. 'I've never seen anything like this. Not even my father could create something this strong.'
"Because when I came in as a Muggle-born I was really fascinated by the culture. I'm dating Darren and visiting his parents for the first time over the hols, and if I knew the traditional dancing and songs I could really impress them."
Seeing Draco's smiling face turn cold made Harry want to rip those last words right out of his mouth.
Harry began to panic, looking back between Dean, Padma and Luna. 'Rastaban Lestrange is here? Why? How did he find us?'
“Then tell that stupid-head to go home. He doesn’t belong here. I heard Grandma say he was a snake. I don’t like snakes. I’m a million times better than him.”
Narcissa continued to look at her sister. “Old family secret. Our parents did it to us; I did it to you, Draco, although you must not remember. I’m surprised you have not thought of it sooner, Andy.”
The man's face, instead of growing irritated like most of the other Potter blokes had, believing the badge to be a personal insult, began to laugh. “Is this a joke? Am I on television? Are there hidden cameras in my bushes.”
The only saving grace is Mr Potter’s obvious love for my father’s cooking, as he has yet to utter a word since his plate was put in front of him. It’s like watching a competitive eater, his fork-strokes from plate to mouth are continuous and at a record speed.
By the time Harry had received the letter it was already late at night and no owl could reach Wiltshire in time for a response. He knew it wasn’t a good idea to leave this important present to someone he had turned into a giant slug.
“Teddy, listen to me. Nothing, I mean nothing, can tear us apart. Do you hear me? I will always be here for you, no matter what. I love you and you are my family. Family sticks together. That man was a liar. You are a wonderful, kind and joyful boy. You will grow up and be a wonderful, kind and joyful man. You have parents. You may not be able to see your mum and dad, but they are always around, watching over you and loving you. I know this Teddy. They love you, I love you, your grandmother loves you. You are ours and you are not going anywhere.”
“Mister Potter, I see you still think you are God’s gift to man. Stop screaming or I’ll be forced to cut out your tongue.”
My father opens his mouth to speak and then shuts it again, turning to the man next to him. Mr Potter just shrugs back, as if he can read what my father is saying. Without them telling me anything, I can already tell this relationship has been going on for a while, probably even years.
Harry scrubbed his face with his hand. “My shift starts in an hour. I’ll run by the station for more details then.”
"I don't hate her and everything I've said is true. She is so focused on her replacement and her legacy at this school that she has forgotten everything that was wonderful about herself as a teacher. Whoever named her Headmistress was a fool. She should have remained a beloved teacher and allowed someone else to deal with the bureaucracy. She's changed, mainly with the Ministry breathing down her neck every two seconds. Teachers have been dropping like flies and no one wants her position. I don't hate her, I pity her. There is a difference." Draco's voice became very quiet. "And if I ever hear the word Mudblood from you again you can leave this room and never come back."
Draco rested his head on Harry's shoulder and fell asleep eventually, but Harry stayed awake, watching the sun rise over the fields.
Lucius shivered underneath the heavy wool quilts. The movement prompted Narcissa to fuss, pulling the covers in tighter around her husband and brushing away lint that wasn't there. After a few moments, in which Narcissa's face threatened to burst into tears, Lucius began to speak again.
So here he was, standing in the middle of his bedroom, waiting for the next step. Should he sit on the bed, or perhaps stand but unzip his fly? What about his shirt? Did he need his shirt on?
Mr Potter reaches down and grabs my father's hand, linking his chubby, greasy fingers with my father's long and tapered ones.
all together, but something in this one caught his eye. In the lower right corner there was an advertisement. The name of the company was torn off but the contact information was there. More importantly was what the advert was selling. Finally! Harry had found the perfect gift for Teddy! It was brilliant and he knew just the place for it. Andromeda had a crop of trees in the garden that would be perfect. He ripped off the sheet and headed towards the post determined to get started right away. He could just imagine it now, agreeing whole-heartedly with the advert, yes he too wanted
Running a hand over the smooth mahogany, Harry could almost feel all of the water and air that had rushed along the sides throughout its career. She was a fine ship, but he wished dearly he didn’t have to see her so soon.
Draco took a step back and lifted his hand in supplication. “As much as I am dying to just drag you into  our home and have my way with you, the doctors told me not to press you. I should take you to St Mungo's, but the last time I did that they took you away from me. I'll call my personal Healer and have him look you over.”
Harry had no idea where to begin and felt woefully unprepared to adequately beg for Draco to spare his own life. Instead he consented to follow Draco's lead, knowing that the ending was destined to be tragic.
Harry ran towards Ron, but he had already yelled out for his home and disappeared in the flames. Harry laughed and settled back into the coach. This issue of
But he shouldn't have. Draco was right to criticize Harry for his lack of action. He had seen things that didn't sit right with him, he had noticed children being banned from joke shops, and people who had done nothing in the war quick to blame and outcast those that were suspected of being Voldemort supporters, even if it was a false speculation. And Harry did nothing, believing all the work was done already. But the work was never done. These kids knew better. Draco knew better.
This fic was my life for several months. An idea floated into my brain and did not let me go until I finished this. Written for 2009 hds_beltane fest.
Harry was confused. ‘But if Draco’s purpose is to destroy the cauldron, why does everyone warn him of the dangers?’
She sat down. The Great Hall hushed under the pressure. The Hat took its time, milking the suspense. Harry could hear the stomping from McGonagall, but someone had placed a silencing charm on her. Harry was sure someone was to be fired. He hoped not Draco.
He also could no longer sit, or sleep. Draco stood beside the tent, his arms extended out from his sides, the bark covering his arm and hands entirely while small shoots had begun to sprout from his arm. Clothes were no longer necessary as his entire body looked nothing like a human. He was a tree with a head.
"No, they replaced it with a new tapestry. It's quite lovely. Shows the Scottish countryside. Lots of green."
Draco stepped up beside Harry, his broom in hand, his face a portrait of concentration. 'It might be better to be in a secure castle rather than a wooden ship if that storm hits.'
Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco's strong grip and shook his hand off his arm. 'Do you see a dock? Also, the sun is about to set. We stop here until dawn and then we go to the island. I would prefer to explore during daylight.'
The ship slowed, as it usually did when Harry would call out a location. But there was something different. The location Harry had called seemed to require something new from the
Snape pulled up the book he was reading. It was Draco's favorite poetry book. There was a passage bookmarked. Snape had heard Potter and Draco discussing it.
But fate has something else in store for me, as my usual flailing is not working and gravity has finally come to collect on all those near misses. I reach out to grab hold of the banister, as a last ditch effort, but my hand catches on a sharp piece of seashell and I let go: a mistake that costs me dearly.
The question seemed to jar Malfoy a bit, probably because Harry had been silent for the past 10 minutes.
'Finally, a man with some sense. That is why it is such a shame to tell you that I was telling the truth. I have no idea where the Magical Cauldron is.'
Before heading out the door, Harry picked up his black travelling cloak and his brown leather briefcase that was sitting on the side table and said goodbye to Kreacher, even though Harry was certain Kreacher was deaf.
The sun began to dip lower. Harry wasn’t hungry yet, but he heard a deep rumble coming somewhere in the middle of Draco’s stomach.
Harry put the wand away sheepishly, remembering belatedly that Draco was meeting him here, just ahead of the crew.
My stomach drops. I had thought much worse, thought perhaps my father had decided to take me back to the wizarding world. Having a guest over wasn’t so bad, except I don’t really feel comfortable with someone else in the house for our celebration.
The crew gathered around Draco. Draco peered blearily at them. 'Er, hello. I'm a bit naked here, so would someone be a doll and find my clothes?'
"A few of them are going extinct because Hogsmeade keeps expanding into their habitat. If we don't stop it now there will be no more Sprites. There down to only 100 left in north Scotland."
Harry said his next words very carefully, knowing he was probably stepping over the line. “May I see it?”
Harry dropped the horn, his jaw falling open. A man he had thought was dead and buried was standing before him, yelling at him as if he were an errant child.
, he had ridden the newest broom from Nimbus, which was quick, but not as efficient, as the wind made it terribly hard to hold onto his briefcase.  Harry was pondering the possibility of riding a bicycle to work the next day, which could prove to be the slowest of them all as well as the least efficient, as he was unsure as to where to park his bicycle once he arrived at the Ministry.
I jump, not expecting my father to be downstairs so fast. He pokes me in the shoulder and lifts his eyebrow. I lift mine back to say, ‘I can do that too, you know.’
A wind rushed though the orchard, rattling the trees. A few small branches came down, only to be instantly snatched by hands that appeared from the ground.
Harry continued to follow Ollivander, surreptitiously attempting to get a closer look at Ollivander’s “helper hands”.
As soon as they landed on the ship, Padma swept Luna away to their cabin below. Dean laughed and began placing bets with Finn and Sir Culhwich on how late they would emerge from their cabin the next morning.
This was Harry's morning routine. It was normal. It was typical. It was the same as any other witch or wizard lucky enough to figure out what made him or her truly happy. He captained the
Harry inched closer, his eyes moving from Draco's face to his lips. He could feel Draco's breath against his face, feel the racing pulse of Draco's heart through their joined hands. Harry wanted to kiss this man, to take ownership of the lips in front of him. Harry was like a child who stumbled upon a toy he thought lost. He wanted to play with his new discovery until the end of time.
“Oh. I always wondered if he thought I was abnormal. What 15-year-old boy doesn’t know how to wank?”
Without warning, the body moved and suddenly a large eye appeared before the crew, its black orb as tall as a centaur and as wide as a Hippogriff.
After a few minutes, I realize my father has yet to take a sip of his drink. Instead, he continues to run his hands over the warm sides and stares into the black substance as if it’s telling him something.
Detective Richard, with his thick white moustache, stepped forward. “Mrs Boot and her two kids left for Tesco and came back to this.”
The table grows silent. I can practically hear my own sweat burst from my face. My father is frowning again, deep lines etching on his forehead and around his mouth. He throws his napkin onto the table, a dramatic gesture I’ve learned to fear quite a bit, and stands up, much more gracefully than me.
“The trees are mostly used for hedging or can be found in deciduous woodlands. Muggles believe that the current changes in the climate are threatening the well-being of the trees. They have started a movement to save them. Muggles seem to be fascinated with saving things. It must be why Granger made her ridiculous attempt to save the house-elves.”
“About four years, but we've known each other a lot longer than that. We… I didn't want to tell you until I was sure this was serious. Plus, his superiors wouldn't really like it if they discovered Harry had anything less than a professional relationship with me while I was still on probation. Now that I'm not… it seemed like a good time to come out, so to speak. Harry's convinced me he's serious.”
“May I remind you again that this is not happening to you! Focus on what I am telling you and less on pitying me. Don't think I will hesitate to have Severus throw you out.”
Had Draco already known what was coming when he picked this place? Did the magic that was flowing beneath his veins pull him towards this cottage and this lawn? Were the roots on his feet yearning for this old soil?
Harry could feel the orgasm building from the bottom of his toes to the roots of his hair. He pulled back from the kiss, his tongue still out, wanting to continue.
Harry quickly stepped towards Teddy and looked up. It was better than anything he could have imagined. The house seemed to go on forever and there were so many twists and turns Harry was unsure how many rooms were in the place. The trees looked as if they were part of the place.
The sun had completely darkened and the wind stopped. Ollivander stood in front of Harry, somehow growing in height to tower over him.
Harry had no idea how Draco was able to determine the goblin's sex, but he didn't seem to be wrong as the goblin preened in front of Draco.
Harry had, in fact, not failed to recognize the resemblance the man bore to his Hogwarts rival, Draco Malfoy. But Harry was having a hard time convincing his brain that the man with the long braided hair sitting across from him was the aristocratic pure-blooded man Harry had seen preening in front of a mirror not three months before during a Ministry Gala.
Harry pocketed the item and made a mental note to ask the family if they knew anyone by the name 'Potter'.
It was like Draco’s words opened a floodgate and all the disappointment, shame, and sadness just filled him and his body seemed unable to handle the sobs that he was emitting. Draco lowered him to the bed, still keeping his arms around him and wiping the tears from his face.
“Alright, Potter, I think I have a general idea of what you want. Usually I have more to go on, but I guess I can design something from scratch, if you trust me.”
Flashes of men with red robes raiding our home unannounced fly through my mind. The Aurors came often when I was little. I was always so frightened as they yelled at my father, threatened to take him away, and broke everything.
Harry had naively believed that instinct to be one only the most devilish of men and women possessed. But in his years of travel Harry had met many people, many so-called friends, that would not hesitate when presented with the opportunity to be in control.
There was a bit of static and then a man’s voice. “Hello, this is Detective Smith from Kent. Chief Kingsley advised us to call you.”
Draco stumbled over a rock, giving Pansy the chance to send another spell. A giant snake rolled out from her stick. It reared its head to bite, but Draco eviscerated it just in time.
“What about angry? He set you up. Dumbledore knew you might die. He sent you there to die, and you just… just went?”
They had spent all day, and all night together. Harry and Draco now just lied in bed, holding onto each other, their fingers tangling.
The Chief’s eyes widened. “Oh, sorry,” he babbled out. “Just something my ma used to say to me when I was little. Doesn’t make a lick a sense, I know. Just slipped out.”
“So, I’m assuming that’s the tree house under that giant sheet.” Ron pointed to the crop of trees that held the tree house. Draco had smartly covered the structure with a giant sheet, keeping in mind the Muggles that would be in attendance.
Harry went to reach for Draco, to calm him down, but Draco ripped Harry’s hand off his arm. Harry knew he made a mistake, but the mistake didn’t warrant such a large reaction from Draco.
This was not going to work unless Harry was getting more out of this deal than just a fuck and silence.
Draco pulled Harry up until he was sitting on Draco’s lap. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s back and his arms around his neck. Draco thrust, his voice grunting with effort. Harry just held on tight and allowed Draco to take him with every ounce of his being.
"So what shall we do? My godfather, Auror Harry Potter, is in the building as we speak investigating its disappearance. He will find it, or find us first. So I believe there is only one course of action to take."
Sir Culhwich stepped beside Harry. 'This is the strongest ward I've seen. I've never seen one that would kick a group of people out like that. I'm not sure we'll be able to get through by throwing spells at it.'
After that thrilling conversation, my mind starts to wander, and I wonder if Mr. Potter wears a badge like the cops do on television. I don't remember any badges on the Aurors when I was little, but that was a long time ago and perhaps times have changed.
A student in the front row raised his hand. Harry noticed that most of the students were in the front row, or close to it, and the handful of students in the back were leaning forward, as if they didn't want to miss anything because of the distance. Most likely they were all looking at Malfoy's hipbone that had stuck out when Draco shifted, his white soft skin tantalizing the audience.
The rest of the cottage, the world, did not exist. Perhaps Harry had sipped poisoned tea, because certainly he'd finally met his end and this was heaven. He pulled Draco close and Apparated them out of the dining room into his bedroom.
My father's picture flashes before me. He's frowning, wrists in shackles. He looks so young, so angry. His skin is pale and slightly green and his eyes are red, but he still manages to sneer at the camera. The robe he's wearing is simple and black but it looks two sizes too big for him. My father's thin now, but in this picture, he looks like he's about to break in two. Seeing that picture I regret instantly what I am doing, and my stomach is churning, but I can't stop. I can't close the folder.
"Even though I've been told I'm a good guy, that I'm courageous and brave, I am also ambitious and resourceful. I wanted to be a great wizard, and I was used to getting out of tight corners with just the skin of my teeth. I had both qualities. And the truth of the matter is, had I not argued with the Hat because of a petty childhood squabble, I would have been in Slytherin.
Draco took back the tongue and sped up, adding a twist to the end. Harry took both of his hands and slapped Draco's arse making a loud sound, and soothing the heat it caused.
"When I eleven, I showed up at Hogwarts not knowing anything about magic or the wizarding world. I kept waiting for the moment that I would wake up and return home realizing it was all a dream, but that never happened."
Finally, someone understands what I have been trying to say, and I'm quite surprised to hear it from Mr. Potter. Perhaps he was hiding a brain underneath that unruly mop of black hair atop his head.
Draco pulled Harry up to a sitting position. He shuffled off the desk and started to gather his and Harry's clothes.
"The Sorting Hat is right. It will place you where you best fit. But the truth is everyone fits in everywhere. We are all brave like Gryffindors, cunning like Slytherins, creative like Ravenclaws, loyal like Hufflepuffs. Listen to the Sorting Hat and allow it to make a choice, but don't let one person tell you who you are or what you are about. You are whatever you want to be. And if you decide you don't like yourself any more, well you can change. Having the will to change yourself, well that's true bravery.
My father’s probation stipulates that Aurors can come at any time to ransack through his home. They also have the right to haul my father off to the Ministry for questioning whenever there are suspicions of wrong-doing or, in other words, whenever the mood strikes. When my father moved us to the Muggle world the searches had stopped, but my father’s probation status felt like a constant reminder that while the Aurors had left us alone, for now, it didn’t mean they always would.
But I know he doesn’t. Even though It’s perfectly legal for my father to do magic in his own home, he doesn’t, unless it’s necessary.
flew toward the horizon, Fawkes sat on Draco's shoulder, singing softly in his ear. Luna, resting comfortably on Harry's shoulder, attempted to sing back, but was only able to create an off-key whistle. Draco, with his now-short hair blowing in the wind, turned to Harry with a big smirk.
I turn over the picture quickly. I don't want to see Mr. Potter or my father like this. This is not who my father is anymore.
The ship shivered for a moment, forcing Draco and his crew to all reach for something to hold. It then paused, as if suspended on the top of the waves. Harry's stomach lifted in anticipation. And then, the
But he hadn't. This Draco was Harry Potter's, not his. He was Harry Black, detective for the London Police, stationed at Paddington Green. Hit his head a few months ago, making the past a bit fuzzy, but Katie and the Chief filled in the gaps for him. He was a single child, parents unfortunately deceased, dedicated to law enforcement and solving crimes. He lived alone and rode a motorbike.
“I did. But the way people were describing love it seemed like something a lot like hate. I mean Blaise had a crush on Pansy, kept teasing her to get her to notice him and complained about how she never noticed him. I felt the same way about Granger. I always wanted her to notice how much better I was and I teased her. It seemed logical. Until Blaise said he dreamt about kissing Pansy. I really couldn’t see myself doing that. It made me ill.”
Harry twiddled with a string dangling from his shirtsleeve. 'Only because I knew what your family went through when Voldemort was living at your house. To me, your family, even your father, were clearly not willing participants, at that point.'
Harry's blood began to boil. It was quite obvious what was going on. Draco had claimed not a few seconds before that he considered he and Harry to still be lovers, but clearly not exclusively.
Standing outside the row of identical terraces on Privet Drive, Harry felt an off sensation: a mixture of déjà vu and repulsion. He shuddered underneath his leather jacket, taking a moment to shake off his feelings before stepping off his bike.
“You're very lucky, Hayden. Had Harry not yelled out the Levitation charm in time, you might have been more seriously hurt.”
"Well since you aren’t there, I might as well take all those striped boxers you begged me to buy you and hang them on the oak trees out front instead of the ribbons. I’m sure all the girls on the street would love to see your pants flying in the wind."
There was a birdcall, and then a yellow goldfinch landed on Harry's shoulder. He petted the goldfinch's head and retrieved the letter from her leg.
“Okay, here is the deal. I’m charging you double the price, because I like that idea. You can continue this farce of a lie for as long as you want, as long as you make Andromeda promise that she is to tell NO ONE about it. You will help me build the tree house, since my aunt will be expecting you outside with me, and I will tell you all about the glorious lifestyle that is homosexuality.”
The two continued to kiss afterwards. Harry was afraid to let go, afraid to realize that this had only been a dream, a hallucination, but as long as he kept kissing Draco and touching him, then he couldn't disappear again.
But through the pain, Harry knew he had to plead his case. So while still on the floor, Harry screamed. “Don’t turn the wards back on! Please! Or I’ll keep doing this, every day; morning, noon and night. You can’t stop me! I’ll find other ways!”
But his personality never lived up to his attractiveness. Harry had no interest in an overgrown brat.
Luna transformed into her bird form once more and took out into the clouds, diving fast into the white cloud sheet below.
'Before we rush into things, how do we know it's safe?' Harry interrupted, his face growing hard. 'I won't risk the lives of my crew.' Without forethought, Harry glanced over at Dean who instantly turned his face away from Harry's. Harry's stomach flipped realizing his mistake.
"Well, it seemed like what Headmaster White did in 1852 when he went against the Ministry, and enrolled Mudbloods and half-bloods to Hogwarts."
“Harry, I think you should think long and hard about what’s going to happen between you and Draco after tomorrow.”
Draco sat down and sniffed the coffee disdainfully before taking a tiny sip. He looked like he wanted to hate it, but couldn't quite hide his enjoyment. Harry knew he made a mean cup of coffee. He was a member of the coffee of the month club and this month was Hazelnut Cream Delight. God, it was an orgasm in heaven, if God let you do that stuff up there.
The two men sat quietly on the ground. Harry was pretty sure Draco would Disapparate any minute now. It was actually pretty surprising that he was still here, and being relatively nice.
Each page confirmed more solidly that this was the perfect gift for Teddy. Growing up, how much did he wish the shed that held gardening tools in back was his own little hideaway. Aunt Petunia had once caught him pretending to fight a shovel, imagining it to be a rival pirate, attempting to steal the beautiful and helpless garden rake. A swift slap on the face had been the end of that. One could make an argument that his cupboard underneath the stairs could be considered his hideaway, if he didn’t hate it so much. It wasn’t a hideaway if you couldn’t leave by your own volition.
Without a second guess, Harry immediately took him to his flat, tearing off Draco's impossibly tight trousers in the hallway towards his bedroom with a flick of his wand, splitting them down the seams. When Draco attempted to take off the leather strap from around his neck Harry slapped his hand away forcefully, enough to make Draco step back in apprehension. As reassurance and punishment for daring to remove Harry's new favorite toy, he Transfigured a nearby quill into a small silver bell and stuck it in the center of the collar.
Draco's gaze remained lost in the darkness as he continued to stare down the hallway, but he spoke anyway. “It’s not that. I just don't have an answer for you. Mother and Father wanted to stay in the castle. I think they're afraid to go home. I stayed with them for awhile but I couldn't stop thinking about that wand; that stupid wand that the Dark Lord wanted so badly. You have no idea the things he did to get to it.” Draco lifted a hand to his face. “No idea.”
The woman, her shapely legs revealed for all to see, walked down the front steps, her tiny feet tucked neatly into high-heeled slippers. She looked like an up-scale hooker, in Harry's mind; someone you would see in a dirty magazine, but never in real life. Harry tightened his jacket and moved within whispering distance to Draco.
But then, as soon as Luna came within arm's reach, the previously shabby, mad King changed, now standing tall, and waved his wand, surrounding Luna in a small gold cage. The King smiled viciously and laughed. Harry began to yell '
My father opens his mouth to speak and then shuts it again, turning to the man next to him. Mr. Potter just shrugs back, as if he can read what my father is saying. Without them telling me anything, I can already tell this relationship has been going on for a while, probably even years.
“I don't have any.” Draco surprised Harry, catching him poking his head into Draco's kitchen. He had changed into khaki trousers and a polo shirt, the collar turned up. His hair was wet and his cheeks were pink. “I thought I told you to get out.”
My mother called my grandmother ‘weak,’ and that was the last time she came with us to my grandparents’ house.
Rubbing his wet red hair, Billy barked out a laugh. “Sorry, sir,” he meekly replied, spying Harry's raised eyebrow. “Didn't realize you knew my name.”
“I thought you got your memory back, Potter. Fight me like a man. Stop standing there with your pants down. Or do you want a repeat of last year? Want me to bash your head into a table again? This time I won't let you walk away with just a case of amnesia.”
If the boat could speak, Harry was sure her response would have been a long series of questions as to why she was hidden away and why she wasn’t in the open air as she was made to be.
Harry’s face was quickly turning an alarming shade of red. It wasn’t that he and Malfoy were the same enemies as they were in school, but they certainly weren’t friends. Harry had helped his mother and Malfoy escape jail time, but the same could not be said for his father. Narcissa had thanked him for all of his help but Malfoy, angry about his father’s sentence, still blamed Harry. In his pale and tired state he was still able to conjure a sneer and tell Harry in no uncertain terms to stay away from his family forever. Seemed easy enough, until today.
The squid moaned. ‘Oh, but he will never forgive me! He moved to Scotland, of all places, to get away from me!’
“I saw you, Harry. I saw you and Draco holding hands. You do not need to go to such extremes to make me believe you. I think you need to explain that this has been all for my benefit to Draco. It’s not fair to play with his feelings.”
Draco laughed at his own joke, but when Harry failed to respond, his laughter cut short. Draco then had the good sense not to question Harry's lack of interest in his banter and mounted his broom. Harry shoved down the irritant thought of disappointment for ending Draco's flirting. He mounted his own broom and zoomed towards the island.
Harry savoured the sheer brutality of it all and said whatever filthy thing came to mind, encouraging Draco to move harder, faster. He wanted to be claimed, to be taken, to be owned in such a primal and simple way.
Harry sat stunned. What about telling Harry all about the glorious lifestyle that was homosexuality?
That did it. Draco screamed into his mouth, coming all over Harry’s hand, the heat of the cum making Harry orgasm as well. The pair continued to kiss, lazily rubbing each other’s cocks until they became too sensitized and they let go.
Harry eagerly followed Draco to the counter as he paid for his book. The shop girl took one look at Harry and turned her nose up, preferring to sweet talk Malfoy. It was quite hilarious to see the poor girl bat her eyelashes only to be snubbed by Malfoy’s aloof demeanor. The girl was attractive, but most likely the Muggle factor was enough to make Malfoy consider her inconsequential.
He knew the bookshop was near the Ministry, as Hermione had found it during her lunch break from the Department of International Magical Cooperation. But Harry had failed to realize just how close until, while standing near the front of the shop, Draco Malfoy appeared on the other side of the large front window, looking at the display.
Sitting at home had clearly addled Harry’s brain. He needed to get out more, maybe pick up a hobby, find an occupation. Hopefully Hermione wouldn’t be out and about. All Harry would need would be grief from her, and worse yet, if Ron found out the company he was keeping, Harry would be a dead man.
“I guess I always knew I fancied boys a little more than everyone else. I tended to be possessive of my male friendships. It wasn’t anything strange because I was possessive about everything, but as I got older and realized that I couldn’t care less whether Pansy or Daphne stayed friends with me, I started questioning things. At first I just thought that the group of girls in Slytherin were stupid and not worth my time, but I found that even the girls in different houses never really roused my notice.
My hands shake as I peel open the folder. I do have a sliver of a conscience. There is a voice running through my head, one that sounds suspiciously like my father, that says what I'm doing is wrong. But my hand is already opening the folder. Can't stop it now.
Harry rushed to Padma whose long, braided hair hung heavy under the weight of the rain. Her eyes were large and her breath laboured.
I don’t blame him. Perhaps I can say that because my father has claimed me publicly in so many other ways - that a few months of doubt before I was even born seem insignificant.
Well that was not going to stop an angry Harry Potter. Malfoy was not Binns and would definitely know if a student group was duplicating its newsletter in his classroom. Harry bet Malfoy was having a good old laugh at Harry's expense. Most likely the talk about Alex was just a smoke screen for Malfoy's evil plot. What exactly that plot was Harry hadn't figured out exactly, but Malfoy was always plotting and always doing evil so it was Harry's job to put a stop on it.
Harry smiled a watery smile, but it made Draco smile back. He handed Harry the quill and pointed to where he needed to sign. Harry did and the form rolled up and disappeared.
Draco quirked his head, the side of his mouth lifting upwards. “Yes. Still are in my mind, at least until yours gets back on track.”
I run a list of possible visitors through my head and can’t come up with anyone who would want to spend Twelfth Night with us. My mother hasn’t written us for five years and my grandparents would never willingly come into a Muggle neighborhood.
Harry brought out a small notepad. Knowing Cindy was coming in today, he had written everything down.
'But,' Harry's spirit rose again with Luna's now positive tone, 'I have heard stories of ancient magical cauldrons that acted without a witch or wizard instructing it what to do, magical cauldrons that contained their own magic. There was one that would replenish food whenever a witch or wizard struck the sides with their wand. Perhaps Draco's Magical Cauldron does that. That would certainly make Draco a hero. The human race would never run out of food.'
Harry directed Malfoy to the back garden, a large open field that led to a large forest of trees in the background. On the left was a large crop of old trees that were sturdy and heady. A single swing had been tied years ago from a branch of a particularly old tree with branches that stretched out and gnarled outward, like an outstretched palm.
Draco finally stood, slowly. Harry noticed that it required some effort and that Draco was holding onto the sides of the chair tightly. “Harry, I need you to do something for me.”
That stopped Malfoy in his tracks. Harry wished that when he woke up this morning he could have realized that today was the day for confessions. He might have slept through it.
Harry rolled his eyes under his closed eyelids. “I hate that term. What does it mean? I'm a boy and I'm alive. Last I heard that wasn't that big a deal.”
“Why, Potter, I didn’t know you could apologize so nicely. I don’t remember you doing so in school.”
It’s not as though Harry actually believes he can keep this from Ron for long; though he may be given to moments of extraordinary dickishness and the occasional bout of ghosting, Ron
He’s also personally glad Ron’s got something to think about other than the brilliant sex Harry’s been having. Speaking of brilliant sex: Hermione suggests they head up to Harry and Malfoy’s room for a bit of afternoon studying. He’s not at all certain which sort of studying she means, but he’s ready to admit he needs both.
Far from fluent in Slytherin codes and subtexts, Harry goes with the obvious. “Good morning, Mill,” he says, deciding to follow Malfoy’s lead.
sort of man?” This gives Harry pause. “Do I, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, seem to be in the habit of offering up things I don’t wish to give?”
Harry thinks that maybe this isn’t so different from what he’d been doing last night, and starts a vigorous and persistent licking over Draco’s hole. Draco’s response is telling: he begins to shout, and knocks several things off the worktable he’s bent over. A large bag of soil rips open, spills over the floor beside where Harry kneels. Under his tongue, he feels the muscles start to give, and he begins to prod firmly. Draco starts making this ‘ah! Ah!’ noise that makes it very clear he is close to orgasm. Harry considers pulling away, but instead finds himself reaching up and around, grasping Draco’s prick, pushing his tongue inside Draco’s arse.
Hermione laughs breathily. “My contraceptives are perfectly fine, thanks very much.” She feeds her tit into Harry’s mouth and asks him, “Is that right, Harry? You want to knock me up someday?”
Aghast, Harry whips his head around to make sure no one is within hearing distance. They're in the clear, but he has to say it anyway: "Shut up, Malfoy." It feels good, almost comforting, to say.
For his part, Draco doesn’t seem to mind this treatment at all. If anything, he encourages it, hands holding onto her hips but not attempting to control them. He moans, muffled and sweet, into her cunt, doesn’t stop licking. Harry can just barely see flashes of pink tongue, but he can see quite clearly when Draco closes his lips over Hermione’s clit, sees his cheeks start to hollow as he sucks, and watches as the last of Hermione’s control slips.
It’s not immediately clear whether he intended to include Harry or not, but Harry’s more than happy to sit this one out regardless. He loves them both dearly, and eagerly anticipates the day when they can all hang out in peace once more. All the same, he scoots along the bench until he is safely outside the bounds of their privacy bubble.
A loud whistle rings through the room, and someone starts clapping. Ron stands there, gobsmacked and spluttering incoherently, but it barely registers in Harry’s mind.
She moans, loudly, and it’s not clear whether it’s because of Harry’s attentions, or the third finger Draco has eased inside her arse.
“Hi Hermione,” he greets cheerily. “Crookshanks.” The kneazle looks at Harry with the same seeming distaste as always.
“Came back?” Malfoy queries, sounding almost as if he doesn’t want to know the answer. “Had you gone somewhere?”
He watches Malfoy clamber out of bed and stumble to the ensuite, griping something about ‘late’ and ‘breakfast’ and ‘shower,’ but nothing about Harry’s aching prick.
nothing. Even when I acted like a jealous arse and bailed on you in the middle of the forest during the scariest year of our lives. When you needed me. You had every right to, but you didn’t. Or am I wrong about that?”
“I’ve not been able to get away to supervise the changes, so the designer has agreed to send over several photographs.”
If he gets a chance at all, that is. Does a silent coexistence - with benefits, apparently - lend itself to that sort of touching? It seems rather intimate, now that he's really considering it. Is hair-touching more, or less, intimate than standing over someone's bed and watching them have a wank? Maybe he can ask Hermione about this, if not the other thoughts crowding his mind this morning.
Harry gets a rush, suddenly remembering what they’re about to do. He fumbles the phial of lubricant out of its hiding place, wondering yet again why they’re doing this with him, and pours some onto Malfoy’s outstretched fingers.
Pansy starts to laugh as well, with no small amount of scorn. “Invisible Potter,” she scoffs. “Darling, now that all of that unpleasantness is behind us, are you willing to admit that Invisible Potter is the most ridiculous story you’ve ever made up?”
“No, I suppose you were too busy checking out his arse and touching yourself,” she says thoughtfully.
year here. Personally, Harry is hoping Flitwick will be able to connect him to some post-Hogwarts education that does not actually take place at Hogwarts.
Probably. But, just to be certain, he grits out, “Think about. What?” He drags his foreskin over the head of his cock, making it quite slippery with precome.
When Harry looks back at Hermione, her blouse is buttoned up and her skirt pulled down, and she’s adjusting her over the knee socks. She looks up at him and smiles brightly. “Thanks for being such a good friend, Harry.” She kisses his cheek and then crawls out of his bed.
Harry sits by the fire, feeling oddly solitary in the half-full Common Room. All things considered, that conversation had gone as well as it possibly could have. Ron is a notorious hothead, and it might have gone drastically worse. He’s still got about 40 minutes before Hermione and Malfoy come back from Ancient Runes – assuming they don’t stop off in a darkened corridor to make good on the unspoken promises they’d been making at each other all day – but his original plan of jerking off is looking rather less than enticing right about now.
He knows, vaguely, that he’s making quite a lot of noise. There’s no way Hermione is sleeping through this, but he’s still not expecting a Patronus to burst through the wall next to Malfoy’s bed. He stares, dumbfounded, at the sleek silver fox with almost teddy bear-like facial features.
, Draco? We’ve not seen you at all lately.” Parkinson levels Malfoy with a look that even he isn’t immune too.
Silently coexisting. Harry wants to find it comforting, in the same way he appreciates his and Hermione’s new dynamic. He just doesn’t, though. “How’s Muggle Studies?” Harry hears himself ask.
Ron blushes bright red at their attentions and sends the girl a wave instead of trying to speak around his mouth full of sandwich.
“Yes,” Harry whispers after a moment. “I had. And I was so tired, that I thought. Just for a moment, I considered staying. But I’m glad I didn’t.”
Malfoy, who hasn’t moved since the ghostly fox had first popped through the wall, pushes his fingers deep, almost questioning.
To be honest, Harry had also found Hermione’s determined mingling with the Slytherins to be odd, but he knew better than to actually confront her about it. Besides, he isn’t exactly one to talk, is he?
Harry takes off his shirt, trousers and pants with heavy, clumsy hands. The second he’s done, Draco pulls away from Hermione and she’s rolling on top of Harry. The second her hot body settles on his, he lets out an embarrassing whine. “Hermione!”
They toss several ideas back and forth, discarding them as being impractical, too cold, too dangerous, or too full of owls.
“Beg pardon?” Harry asks. He can’t remember what he and Ron used to talk about before Harry started having sex with Malfoy and Hermione. Something about… sports?
Harry doesn’t know what his answering look reveals. He forgets about their little run-in with the Slytherins. He forgets that Draco used to bring other trysts here. He forgets, because there’s something so primal and so pure here, that other motives fade away. He’s just pushing his cock as deep inside Draco as it will go. He’s just shagging a brilliant blonde like he might never get another chance.
Draco laughs, delighted by this little trick, and reaches behind the bed to tug loose a phial of lubricant and lay it in Hermione’s little hand.
He strokes her face, pets her side, tells her how utterly dazzling she is. Her breath shudders, and Harry kisses her sweetly, tells her again that she’s brilliant, completely sexy, he’s not even sure how he’s not come yet.
“Great!” Malfoy says. “I hope your contraceptives stand up to that famous Potter exceptionalism, by the way; I might have accidentally planted some notions of impregnating you several years down the line.”
And Draco does, gloriously, fairly howling his pleasure. Harry holds on as his body twists and convulses, watches his cock spurt stream after stream of come high in the air.
Somehow sensing the path Harry’s thoughts have taken, Ron scoots closer on the couch and elbows Harry. “Don’t, mate. This situation is hardly your fault.” Harry’s skepticism must show on his face, because Ron goes on. “For years, you’ve said nothing,
“Oh, it’s not written down anywhere,” Hermione answers from the other bed. “Just a few things I like to,” here she pauses to sigh tellingly, “think about.”
“Fuck,” he murmurs against Hermione’s lips when both their hands meet on his prick and begin to rub with purpose. Hermione’s little hand lifts the waistband of his pants, and Draco’s sure and unhesitating hand pulls him out, and then they’re both stroking his cock. Hermione’s hair brushes his face, and he hears the sounds of them kissing just above his face.
He’s not a bit uncomfortable to have every inch of his flesh on display, rather, seems to particularly enjoy Harry’s admiring gaze. Harry takes in all the pale, pale skin, the fat, perfect cock pointing skyward. He feels a greedy urge to taste Malfoy’s cock, and he’s thinking about it so fervently that he doesn’t quite catch what Malfoy is saying.
. He knows Malfoy is likely expecting more rough treatment from Harry, a barely wet finger or two, and the thought is tempting, but there’s something he wants quite a bit more. He draws his wand, uses his left hand to spread Malfoy’s arse cheeks a bit, and aims a gentle Cleansing Charm between them.
an insufferable arsehole. I must be insane-” he breaks off to kiss and bite his way across Harry’s jaw.
And that’s the moment when the door to their room bursts open. Hermione stands there, cheeks flushed, eyes comically wide. When Malfoy stands up, gloriously naked and more than half-hard, her jaw drops.
He obeys, happily. Pushes his cock an inch inside her, dazzled by how hot and wet she is for him. “Hermione,” he murmurs, trying to find the words to tell her how it feels and coming up short. He pushes in further, watches her mouth drop in a perfect “O” of pleasure. He thrusts further and further, waits until he’s fully seated inside her to arc down and kiss her exceptional tits some more.
Harry scratches the back of his neck. “Eh, I can sorta see why he might not be thrilled to discuss the scorching hot threesomes his best mate is having with his ex and his former bully.”
year when she’d received Outstandings on all of her O.W.L.s. She’s even started socializing more, having made friends in other Houses who appreciate a good study sesh just as much as she does.
Harry has decided, quite abruptly, that they should try sitting at the end of the table usually occupied by Slytherins. He sits down across from Bulstrode, and after a long moment, Malfoy sits down beside him.
When Harry’s senses come back to him, he blinks his eyes open to see Malfoy shooting him a smug, cum-smeared grin from the floor. He’s just come in Malfoy’s mouth and the Slytherin Prince is fucking grinning about it. The chances that all of this is just a particularly convincing hallucination have just gone up drastically. But while he’s here... he has a very vivid image of himself licking and sucking that mess right out of Malfoy’s mouth, and he’s going to do it as soon as his limbs are obeying commands once more. Any moment now.
Harry, who’s not ridden a broom for fun in ages, jumps at the opportunity. They head down to the Quidditch Pitch and pass an hour or two in the fading sunlight, practicing daring maneuvers and laughing at one another. Ron’s gaze skitters away every time he makes eye contact with Harry, but he’s giving his most valiant effort to pretend that everything is fine. Harry enjoys himself immensely.
Malfoy, against all odds, had apologized on the spot. He’d actually seemed quite genuine, listing his wrongdoings and offering reparations rather than excuses. After he’d gone on for quite some time, Hermione had interrupted him to say, “I accept your apology, and will accept changed behavior in lieu of reparations.” Since then, Hermione’s seemed more comfortable in the room than either one of them.
Harry walks back the way he’d come in a daze. He doesn’t need to hear any more of that. He ends up standing in front of the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. It’s happened more often than he cares to admit. He thinks about turning around, but where would he go? Hermione and Malfoy will be waiting for him in his bedroom, if they’re not still chatting his innermost thoughts and desires behind his back that is. He scowls, and that’s when the portrait opens and Ginny Weasley steps out.
Harry shrugs. Malfoy’s right, but Harry has long come to terms with the utterly illogical functioning of Wizarding Society. Just to be a shit, though, he corrects, “well, I technically come from Godric’s Hollow, and I
He draws closer, watching as Malfoy’s head moves in gentle nods and shakes while Hermione becomes more and more vocal in her approval.
She nods, and then remembers to speak: “Yes, yeah, right now.” She leans forward, holding Harry’s shoulders, and closes her eyes.
Harry groans, nodding and pushing towards the teasing finger. The finger disappears briefly, and he can hear Malfoy digging around. The pop of a phial being uncorked sounds, and Harry tries to suppress his shivers, but he can’t, not until Malfoy’s hand is back between his legs, wet fingers circling and stroking his hole. Harry holds out for as long as he can, but only seconds later he bursts out, “Malfoy,
Harry stares him down, but Malfoy is just as stubborn as he is, so he’s forced to try a different tack. “Then…” he says slowly, thinking. “What haven’t you done here?”
Why someone as gorgeous as Hermione – whose options are literally endless at this point – is choosing to spend her time with Harry is beyond him, but he’s certainly not about to question her on it.
“Harry!” she says with a smile, but it fades when she notices the sour look on his face. “I’ve been meaning to catch up with you lately, actually.” She steps up, not the least bit afraid of his mood, and threads her arm through one of his. “Let’s walk.”
“Yes, Potter, I’ll give you what you want.” Draco’s cock disappears for a long moment, and then is back, slipping wetly up and down between Harry’s arse cheeks. He only teases Harry for a second more, and the next, he’s pushing inside.
Getting Malfoy off doesn’t seem to be getting old, and if the sparkle in Malfoy’s eye as he licks his own hand clean is anything to go by, he feels much the same.
try to make some headway on his Potions assignment. And though he takes out his books and parchment and quill, he’s still hearing Hermione’s moans in his ear and thinking about all the things they could have gotten up to if she’d allowed it. He imagines tugging off her knickers and has to squirm in his seat a bit. He’d have loved the opportunity to slip his fingers inside her, pumping and caressing until she came on them.
Ron rushes to explain to Hermione that this is all new, and well, they’re not anything yet, they’ve just chatted a bit, but it’s a very recent development, he’d certainly not flirted whilst they were still together-
Harry clears his throat and shifts a bit in his seat, reflecting on the stunning manner in which they’d met Hermione’s needs on Saturday evening.
the phenomenon. “Well, I expect it has to do with petrol and really large engines?” It’s not the most intelligent sentence Harry has uttered in the past day, for sure, but it’s also not the least.
Harry flushes. He’d not actually meant to say that. “Forget about the cupboard. Why are you showing me this?”
Hermione pulls away, gets a good look at the lust-addled expressions on both their faces, and smirks. She raises an eyebrow at them, reaching behind to unzip her plaid uniform skirt. It falls to the floor, pools around her socked feet, and Harry just stares some more. To be fair, she’s quite a sight. Clad in sheer bra and matching knickers, and her wonted over the knee socks, she looks like something out of a half-forgotten wet dream. Saliva pools in Harry’s mouth as he takes in her gentle curves, the sassy tilt of her hips, all that smooth brown skin on display. Hermione spins on one heel and slinks towards Malfoy’s bed. Malfoy rises to follow immediately, all flushed cheeks and eager hands. Harry tries to trail along, but is foiled spectacularly by his tangled trousers and pants.
“Shoo, Potter,” he says, swatting at Harry. “Granger has rightly prioritized your studies this afternoon, and I’ve already agreed to help.” He peers over his shoulder at Harry, raising an eyebrow in challenge. “Unless you’d prefer I not involve myself?”
Harry can hardly hear any of it over the buzzing in his ears. He vaguely notices Ron storming from the room, but mostly he’s thinking he should probably sit down before anyone notices his reaction to seeing Hermione behave that way.
When she’s calm again, she gives a deeply satisfied hum and pats Harry’s hand. He gives her pussy one last stroke and then withdraws from her knickers. He’s thinking about sucking his fingers clean, but Malfoy snatches his hand out of the air seeker-fast and pops Harry’s soaking wet fingers into his mouth. Hermione moans at the sight and Harry gasps, cock twitching.
The thing is, Harry and Hermione have always been friends first. He cares about her, loves her, and would very obviously not be here without her having repeatedly saved his arse over the years. He knows her dreams, her ambitions, and the things that keep her up at night. That’s what best friends do. Sure, he’s noticed that she’s beautiful and smart and possessing of a gorgeous body; who doesn’t know when they’ve got a hot best friend?
Harry bites his lip and lets his mind drift farther, to Hermione’s legs wrapped around his waist, his prick pushing deep inside her, her moans in his ear, her hands clutching him for dear life. His cock twitches in his trousers as he imagines making her come, surrounded by books. By all means, this should be Hermione’s greatest fantasy, but when he looks up, she’s completely focused on Advanced Charms, Year Seven.
“Frankly, I don’t see how it’s any of your concern with whom I spend my time.” It’s clear that Hermione is trying to sound casual, but she misses the mark. “
“You know, Harry,” Hermione says thoughtfully some time later. Harry, who has been aimlessly staring into the distance, looks to her warily. Subtle cues are not Harry’s specialty, but even he can sense a reproach coming. “For someone who has been improving noticeably in classes, you don’t appear to spend much time actually studying.”
Hermione joins in, remarking how wonderfully Draco takes her, how good he feels round her fingers, how gorgeous he is, flushed pink and slick with sweat and so, so hard.
Harry stows his wand absentmindedly, dropping his hands to grip Hermione’s perfect arse. She moans into his mouth, and he hopes like hell his charms hold up, because he has every intention of making her scream right where they stand, Madame Pince be damned. He reaches low, sneaks both hands up Hermione’s uniform skirt and grabs two handfuls of her arse, encouraging her to ride his thigh. She obliges, moaning again and flickering her tongue against his. Even through the material of his uniform trousers and her knickers, he can feel how hot and wet she is, and he’s genuinely considering tugging her panties off and fingering her right here when a loud bell begins to jangle in his head.
be joking,” Draco says, not really resisting, but Harry listens anyway. He takes off his jumper and lays it down over the dirt, tossing his best Cushioning Charm at it. This is all he’s prepared to offer, and Draco lies on it willingly enough.
A cold splash runs down Harry's opposite arm, and he turns back to find that Ginny Weasley has approached from behind and upended an entire glass of pumpkin juice over her brother's head.
“I told Ron we shagged.” She takes a breath to speak, but he goes on, “Look, I know that in a perfect world I would never tell your ex-boyfriend about... us... but what was I meant to do? He was banging on about what a great friend I am, and how he doesn’t deserve my friendship! What was I meant to have done? Sat in silence, knowing I'd gotten a leg over his ex-girlfriend not two weeks after you’d split?”
Draco responds to it beautifully, pouty and seductive. “Cock. I want your cock in me. I’m so empty,” he complains.
Hermione pulls back a bit and Harry kisses his way down her chin to her neck. Unlike Malfoy, Hermione would likely hex Harry for leaving a mark, so he’s careful not to nip or suck too hard. Her skin is so soft, so sweet, he can hardly get enough.
“God, Hermione,” he pants into her neck while he thrusts inside her. “I want to make you come. Can you- will you tell me what to do?”
Hermione is worn out, and they convince her to stay the night. “Yes, I suppose you’re not using this bed anymore,” she mutters sleepily.
“Gin and Dean want to toss a Quaffle about a bit before dinner.” Right! Quidditch! “What do you think?”
An awkward silence ensues. Finally, Malfoy speaks. “Well,” he says, and then walks away without bothering to make up an excuse.
“He loves it,” Draco says, gravelly and hot. “Keep touching him like that.” And then, Draco’s hand is gone. He seems to be reaching across Harry’s body, and soon Hermione is hissing and moaning like… like she’s got something thick and perfect in her pussy.
“It’ll likely be less frightening if Ron and Malfoy come this time,” Hermione reasons, letting go of Harry’s hand to dig in her bag. Probably in search of a book.
“Great!” Malfoy chirps, rolling under Harry to lie on his back. He somehow manages to knock one of Harry’s arms from under him, and Harry lands on top of him with an ‘oof!’ Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind at all, carrying on reading the list of Harry’s fantasies while Harry hides his hot face in Malfoy’s incredibly soft jumper. His neck prickles like someone is watching him, but he definitely doesn’t want to see the look on Hermione’s face right now.
“He’s rather fit these days, isn’t he?” Hermione asks, sighing again and squirming a little. “Did you
Sometimes, when he’s behind the curtains of his bed with his privacy charms up, he pictures himself doing just that. He imagines walking up to Malfoy while he’s sitting at his desk in their shared room and just… sticking his cock in Malfoy’ face. He pictures Malfoy pretending not to notice, pictures tugging Malfoy’s chin down and slipping into his mouth. Fantasy Malfoy still acts as though nothing weird is happening, pretending to read his Charms book even with his mouth full of Harry’s prick. Sometimes in his fantasy, he accidentally gets come on Malfoy’s homework, and Malfoy’s ensuing outrage tips Harry right over the edge.
