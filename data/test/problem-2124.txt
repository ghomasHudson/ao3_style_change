"This is nothing like last time," Harry murmured, pressing a few kisses along Draco's jawline. "This time you'll stay with me."
"I do."
The next morning Draco awoke first, checking in on Harry and finding the idiot still passed out. Draco took a quick shower and got dressed before heading into the kitchen. One of the things he had learned from living alone, without the aid of house elves, was that he quite liked cooking. It had turned into something of a hobby of his. It was Saturday, so he didn’t exactly have anywhere to be. He could only hope that when Potter awoke, he would have some pressing engagement and vacate the premises. Perhaps a ribbon cutting ceremony or some babies to kiss, whatever it was saviors did on the weekend.
"Considering the whole world of figure skating has gone crazy wondering that, kind of, yeah," Harry said, glancing shyly over at Draco.
be your excuse. The Daily Prophet has written so much awful shit about me that I’ve lost track. If a bit of bad press is enough to dissuade you then you’re a bloody coward, Malfoy.”
“It’s really weird hearing that coming from my voice,” Harry said, cringing slightly. “And it rather is my business because I’m stuck in your body and that means he might just feel the need to do it again.”
Draco sighed heavily. “Can we not? It’s late, Potter, and you’re in no condition to have this kind of conversation. Best leave it for now.”
“Do you hate me?” Harry asked softly.
"Too bad! Nothing you can do about it. Bye, love you! Bonne chance!"
Harry had finished most of his jumps successfully and was going into his final step sequence. Draco put his hands on the railing and gripped it tightly. One more jump and it would all be over.
Draco reached out, cupping Harry's face in his hands, wiping away the remaining tears.
Draco stood beside Harry at the pre-competition banquet. Harry was very deliberately not drinking after what had happened last year, but Draco had decided to partake in a little champagne.
“You were drunk last night.”
“Hey mate, wake up!”
"No!" Harry shouted, staring Draco down, his green eyes alight with an unnatural flame, hard and piercing behind his glasses. "Once again it's about you! You'll get what you want from me and you'll leave again."
Draco appeared from under the invisibility cloak and Blaise screamed, backing away so quickly that he stumbled and fell on his arse. “How did you do that?”
To his very great dismay, Potter emerged from the guest bedroom in just his pants. He yawned as he walked, scratching his head, his fingers getting lost in his absolutely wild hair. “Good morning,” he said cheerfully.
Draco pressed a few kisses to the side of Harry's shaft. "Why is that?"
Draco pressed his thigh between Harry's legs and felt the beginning of Harry's erection. "I love you too," Harry gasped out, letting himself rut against Draco's thigh. "Take me to bed."
Harry made a funny noise in the back of his throat – halfway between a moan and a laugh. "I- I've had a crush on you since I was thirteen," he admitted, biting his bottom lip as Draco swirled his tongue over the head. "If I had known then that I would be getting sucked off by Draco Malfoy, I don't think my teenage heart would have been able to handle it."
He pulled out a blue button down shirt and a pair of grey trousers. Decently muggle-ish and Draco assumed appropriate date attire. He hadn’t actually been on a whole lot of those. He knew he’d guessed right when Harry appeared back in the doorway a few minutes later, just as Draco was stepping into his shoes.
It was still unbelievably surreal having Harry there with him. Whenever Harry had come before, it had always been with Granger and Weasley in tow. Draco didn’t think Potter had the stomach to come alone and yet here he was. He blundered into Draco’s flat like the great big oaf he was with no regard for what it might do to Draco to have him here. Or what would happen to Draco if the papers found out about it. He’d be crucified for it, probably accused of using a love potion on Potter, or some kind of dark magic.
"I – well – I – " Harry stammered, his face going a bit red. Draco had to keep from laughing or telling Harry just how adorable he was. Something behind Harry's head caught Draco's eye and he stepped around Harry to take a closer look. "No! I – Oh god!"
Bruno went over to Harry excitedly, his tail wagging at getting to meet someone new. Harry gave his head a few awkward pats. "I'll um…I'll just go get dressed. Sorry!"
“Well I can’t have you running your mouth, can I?” Draco hissed at him quietly. “You’ll give everything away.”
Draco and Harry went crashing into Draco's apartment, their lips locked on each other as Draco struggled to get his key out of the door. Harry was hanging off Draco with his arms around his neck, his cheeks flushed and his mouth tasting of champagne. Harry had placed third, a bronze medal to go along with his silver, and they had done a bit of celebrating afterwards.
Cormac McLaggen was new to the senior division that year and was still fairly inexperienced. Draco had never skated against him before so he didn't know that much about him. Cedric, Theodore and Blaise were all worthy opponents as they all had been in the senior division for years, and Draco had shared a podium with each of them at different events. He just wished Harry had an easier climb to the podium.
Draco was ready to kill whoever was pounding on his door at three o’clock in the sodding morning. He thought even with his history the Ministry of Magic wouldn’t send him to Azkaban for using the killing curse on whoever was rudely at the door.
Draco fell silent, chewing on his bottom lip as he tried to think of some way to slip Harry out unnoticed. He knew from experience that the press had no scruples when it came to privacy and would have no problem waiting as long as it took to get their story.
“My flat isn’t hooked up to it for the same reason!” Draco said, quickly losing his patience. Potter was still only clad in his underwear, currently lying on top of Draco, his face uncomfortably close.
Harry nodded and then pressed his forehead against Draco's. "Gold or not – I want to keep fighting and winning with you as my coach."
Draco arrived in London and made his way to the Bed and Breakfast that the Potters owned in Godric's Hollow. He secured, a quaint little room painted in green and silver, leaving the reservation open-ended. The room size was going to be a problem once the rest of his stuff got there, as it wasn’t even the size of his walk-in closet back home.  He was having quite a lot shipped over from his flat in Paris. But if he was going to be there for a while, he was going to need all his stuff.</p>
“What is this?” Blaise asked, gesturing towards Harry with his wand. “Polyjuice potion or something?”
"Goyle was a Neanderthal," she said primly. "And you two didn't last a month. Now stop stalling and let me meet him."
Blaise smiled and sidled up to Harry, pressing his hand against Harry's backside. "What Harry, no dance off this year? I wore my good underwear in case you and I decided to strip again."
“Like we’re shagging each other’s brains out?”
“Fucking hell,” Blaise said, stumbling back. He quickly released Harry from the spell. He brought his hand up and smacked himself on the head. “All those things I said to you today! Oh shit, I kissed you as well.”
for some reason.
Zabini scoffed. “Don’t play dumb, Draco, it doesn’t suit you.”
“Why don’t you want to be?”
Draco glowered at him. “Don’t be stupid, Potter.”
Draco moved in front of Harry and took both his hands in his own. "It doesn't have to be, Harry. Everyone is waiting to see what you'll do next. You can't disappoint them. You can't disappoint me."
“Very presumptuous of you, Potter,” Draco said, straightening Harry’s glasses on his face. “That I’m going to invite you home with me after our date.”
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, cupping his mug in his hands and looking at Draco intently.
Draco forced a smile onto his face. Harry didn't know his parents at all, and in that moment, Draco was kind of glad of that fact.
Since neither of them had a hangover to nurse, they decided to do a little sightseeing in Barcelona and maybe some shopping. Harry liked to buy little gifts and souvenirs for his family and friends when he traveled. He spent a long time picking out the perfect gift for his parents, Hermione, Ron, their kids, and Luna. Draco watched Harry pour over the street vendors’ wares with a determined look on his face that just made Draco want to kiss him.
Draco captured his lips as he fucked him through his orgasm. He didn't think he'd ever grow tired of the way Harry looked when lost in complete surrender to his pleasure. He was stunning and Draco felt greedy for how much he wanted him. It only took a few more thrusts for him to finish, exhausted and drained from the day he'd had.
As if reading his mind, Pansy asked, "Do they know you're home?"
“Don’t start using that as an excuse for everything, Potter,” Draco warned, sliding his fingers through Harry’s messy hair. “It’s not a free pass for being an idiot.”
Draco groaned and scrubbed his hand over his face. Did he really need to explain this to Harry of all people? “Let’s start with this,” he said, thrusting his arm forward to show off the dark mark.
Draco knew there would be quite a story of them in the papers the next day, but they wouldn't be reading it anyway. Draco found he had something a lot more interesting to occupy his time now. He might have ended up picking up a copy of the Prophet, just to clip out the picture of their kiss. It was the only true part anyway. Draco barely recognized his own face, beaming at Harry in the split second before Harry had kissed him. He looked soppy and smitten, two things he had rarely been before. He had to admit it was quite a good look on him. While the picture was meant to be revealing, instead it just felt like another secret he and Harry shared.
Harry frowned. “Haven’t you got anything stronger than tea?”
Harry seemed to debate for a moment and then took Draco's hand. They ended up getting fish and chips and sitting on a bench in the park. Draco hadn't had chips in years, not since he'd started skating.
“Why?”
"Lucius!"
Draco ran down to the great hall and found his body sitting down next to Blaise, looking like a lost puppy. He would have rolled his eyes if he hadn’t been absolutely mortified of what Blaise had potentially done. He walked up and grabbed his own arm, which was just bloody bizarre, and dragged his own body from the Great Hall and out into the courtyard.
"I thought you came here for me," Harry said accusingly. He turned his face away and clenched his jaw, clearly upset with himself for having said anything.
Harry Potter, one of the dime a dozen British figure skaters that had joined the Senior division this past year, had had a promising start to the season, winning silver in Skate America and had quickly become the skater to beat. Draco had been looking forward to crushing him for his sixth consecutive win. But then during his Long program, Potter had attempted a quadruple toe-loop and landed wrong. He went smashing into the side railing and ended up with a concussion, a twisted ankle and a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. Needless to say, he hadn't finished his program.
“Absolutely,” Harry whispered, capturing Draco’s lips in a bruising kiss. Draco gasped – the sound of it swallowed up by Potter’s eager kisses – his mouth opening and Potter invading it like he’d managed to do with everything else. Harry gently pushed Draco down against the pillows and settled on top of him, the kisses remaining deep and all consuming.
"Not going to take it easy on me, huh?" Harry said, blushing as Draco let the medal drop back onto Harry’s chest and pulled him in for a sweet kiss.
"Wow," Pansy said, stirring her coffee pensively. "Draco Malfoy in love. I never thought I'd see the day."
"It's Cormac next and then me," Harry said, his eyes wide and frightened with nerves. "I was so worried you wouldn't make it in time."
Draco was already waiting for Harry before he even got off the ice. He held his arms out in anticipation. "Harry!" Draco shouted, calling him over.
"Make a move?" Draco echoed in surprise.
Draco scrubbed his hand down his face. “I’m not married because I don’t want to be. Alright?”
"I – uh…" Harry took a few steps back and then bolted from the room. "I'll be right back!"
Draco glanced over at Harry and sighed. “I don’t know if this makes everything more or less confusing than it was.”
Draco stared at him incredulously. “Can we not?”
Draco dropped his hand and cocked his head to the side, studying Harry in his body. “Don’t pretend like this isn’t a big deal, Potter. It’s infuriating. You’re acting as if you don’t
Draco ducked his head down to hide his smile. “Must be.”
"You're not feeding him too many of those, are you?"
Draco brought his finger to his chin and examined a poster of himself. It was from two years ago, when Draco had kept his hair on the longer side, falling well past his shoulders. He had picked a dark blue costume with silver accents to bring out his grey eyes. The program had been soft and romantic in mood with Draco focusing more on his ballet training to enhance the gracefulness of his movements. Looking at it now, all Draco could see was that the long hair made him look unbearably like his father. "So you're a fan then, hm?" Draco asked, flashing Harry his most charming smile.
It wasn't until they neared the final jump that Draco began to get nervous. It was another quad flip and based on how things went the day before, Draco didn't want Harry  upset again if he didn't land it. Draco held his breath and released it in a surprised gasp when Harry landed the jump perfectly. Draco covered his mouth with his hand, the ring Harry had chosen for him resting against his lip. He would have sworn he'd never witnessed anything as extraordinary in his life.
Harry stepped closer and Draco took a step back. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed thickly, watching Harry. “Do you want me to care?”
“I’m not the one having a strop in his bedroom,” Harry said with a smirk. Draco very much wanted to walk over and slap it off Potter’s face. He imagined it would make a very pleasing sound and cause a very nice mark on Potter’s cheek. “Is now one of those times when you hate me?”
Draco undid the last few buttons on his shirt – a task Potter had abandoned halfway through – and shoved it off his shoulders. “Wanker.”
Draco rushed after him and grabbed his arm. “You seem awfully calm for someone who just learned I’m his soulmate,” he said accusingly.
"You don't need to do quads to win," Draco said simply, meeting Harry's fiery stare. "We'll work on it back home, but for now you can get a high score if you just focus on the presentation. The step sequence alone will earn you high marks."
"I know that," Pansy said, gingerly gripping a chocolate croissant and delicately bringing it to her lips. "It's just nice to see is all. You take these men to bed, and sometimes I can't even tell if you like them at all or just want to scratch an itch."
Draco pulled back and gripped Harry around the middle, rolling them to switch places. “Shall I show you how it’s done, Potter?” Draco was thankful for the chance to not have to speak. The last thing he needed was to say something stupid and ruin this. He tugged Potter’s boxers down and off to come an up close look at the Chosen One’s cock. Draco had to stamp down the feeling of hysteria bubbling up inside him. He was in bed with Harry Potter, about to put his dick in his mouth. If only his fourteen-year-old self could see him now.
“Ex-Death Eater,” Harry reminded him gently. “Unless you’re still serving Voldemort after his death.”
"Oh," Harry said, shuffling a little. "You should go, right? I mean it's your parents. It would be rude not to go."
Harry chuckled. “A date, Draco, you and me.”
“What are you doing?”
"I don't think you could handle that amount of competition," Harry quipped, sliding his hand out of Draco's and skating backwards to take his place at center ice.
After leaving his parents’ house, Draco walked around for a long time, trying to decompress by walking around the city he loved so much. He let himself get a little lost along the familiar streets, his hands in his trouser pockets, and his gaze on the road beneath his feet. He wished that after telling himself for so long that his parents' opinion didn't matter that it was actually true. He wished that an afternoon with his parents wasn't enough to send him spiraling.
Pansy strolled into Draco’s flat a moment later and put her keys down on the kitchen counter along with a box of pastries from their favorite bakery. "Alright, where is he?"
Harry blinked slowly as a few pieces of information slammed against the walls of his skull as if trying to escape his brain. One, Harry had just kissed Blaise Zabini. Two, Blaise seemed to think he was Draco sodding Mafloy. Three, Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini were supposedly “having fun” together. Harry shuddered and shoved Blaise hand away from his face.
you fly all the way here then?"
Draco was about to come up with a scathing retort when a flash of something by his front window caught his eye. He stood up, thinking Zabini’s stupid owl had gotten turned around again. He pushed aside the curtains and was met with about six or seven different reporters standing on the sidewalk outside his flat. When they noticed him at the window, they all turned and began flashing pictures.
When Harry got off the ice, Draco wasn't quite sure what to say. He certainly wasn't going to yell like other coaches and make Harry feel bad for his mistake. Harry's face fell even more as they announced his score and he didn't even break one hundred points. Harry dropped his face into his hands, and Draco sat beside him wondering how he could make Harry feel better.
Harry had easily gotten a personal best in the local qualifier and that meant his next two events were Skate America and Trophée de France to find out if he would make it to the Grand Prix Final at the end of the season.
As Harry's music began, Draco could tell that he was different. At the qualifier, Harry had been able to just focus on skating and not get bogged down in the competition. It was all just about scoring points with no medals involved. This time, though, there was a chance to get on the podium, and Harry was skating like a real competitor.
Harry sighed. “Fine, I’ll leave you be. Let me know when you’re through having your little tantrum.”
Draco got his answer when he left the bathroom just in time to see Harry slip out of the guest bedroom. In just his pants, Draco could see the flush of Harry’s skin, the bite marks on Harry’s lips, and the waning erection. Harry ducked his head down and went into the bathroom, locking the door behind him. Draco went into his own bedroom and spent the night wondering if he should have let himself have this one thing or if it would have made everything a million times worse to give in to Harry Potter.
"It was my goodbye," Harry cut him off, beginning to pace his room. "A goodbye to the sport I love."
"You are, Harry!" Draco reached out and took Harry's hands in his own. "You're a beautiful skater. You don't need to prove that to anyone."
It had taken a lot of fighting, yelling and crying (on Harry's part) to get his routines where Draco wanted them. Harry had been hesitant to try any quads again, and it had taken a lot of pushing and encouraging (on Draco's part) to get Harry there.
"Yeah," Harry said, putting his food aside and placing his hands in his lap.
Draco frowned. “Absolutely not,” he said snippily, turning his nose up. “I’m saying if that’s the explanation you’ve accepted then why aren’t you more concerned?”
Harry’s face paled for a moment before it hardened into a look of grim determination. “Well then I’m not leaving.”
Harry replaced his glasses and fixed Draco with a hard stare. “That’s so unbelievably shite for you to put all that on me. As if it wasn’t enough that I had a raving lunatic continuously trying to kill me almost every year, I was also supposed to look out for the one person who made my life miserable? You broke my bloody nose, as you might recall, and left me on the train that year. I was supposed to take that as you being odd? It felt more like you just being your usual terrible self. And I did save you, as you well know, and destroyed Voldemort so you’re welcome for that as well. Don’t you dare ask me to apologize for not killing you because I won’t. You can just shove it up your arse, Malfoy.”
"I've made a decision," Harry said, sinking lower into the tub. "Tomorrow will be my final skate. I'm grateful for everything you've done for me and I never could have gotten where I am without you. I think we should end it though."
Harry's jaw dropped. "Wait, what?"
“Enjoying not being you,” Draco quipped, getting to the end of the scar and moving his finger back up to the top to trace it again. They’d decided last night that the best course of action would be for both of them to stay the night just in case they didn’t switch their bodies back. If they woke up still as each other they would go to the infirmary first thing. It seemed like that wouldn’t be necessary anymore and that meant that they really were soulmates.
Draco huffed, his exhale of breath causing Harry’s fringe to blow up and reveal his scar for a moment. “Gee, Potter, why would an ex-Death Eater prefer that strangers not be able to randomly appear inside his house?”
Harry had decided that the theme for his skate performances this season would be perseverance. Draco had completely agreed, as this was Harry's comeback after his accident. The truth was that Draco was so proud of Harry and everything he had accomplished so far this season. He knew Harry had his heart set on gold, but Draco thought the fact that he was even competing again was a huge accomplishment already. A lesser skater would have let an accident like that take them down for good.
Draco's jaw dropped when instead of doing a quadruple toe-loop as planned he did a quadruple flip. A quad flip had been Draco's signature move, but not even he had ever dared to do it as the final jump in a program. Harry couldn’t manage to land the jump and fell to the ice, but it appeared he'd gotten enough rotations in. Draco's hand covered his mouth in shock. Harry was immediately on his feet again and finished out the program.
Not that anything was going to happen between him and Potter. It was resolutely not going to happen in a million years. He would rather shag a hippogriff than Potter. That wouldn’t stop rubbish like the Daily Prophet from printing about it though.
"Igor," Draco said, still watching Harry.
The kettle began to whistle and Draco carefully slid past Harry to get two cups down from the shelf. He dropped a teabag into each and then poured the water over it. He could feel Harry watching him, his gaze almost like a physical weight on Draco’s skin. “So why did you kiss me then?” Draco couldn’t help himself from asking. “Years of pent up regression finally bubbling to the surface? Or am I just that enticing that you couldn’t help yourself?”
Potter got very drunk – probably out of nerves since this was his first Grand Prix – and he also got a little rowdy. He challenged the Russian skater Viktor Krum to a dance off that soon involved pretty much all the skaters. In the midst of all the dancing, Potter came up to Draco and asked to have a kiss if he won the dancing competition. Caught a little off guard, Draco somehow found himself agreeing.
Harry made a funny buzzing noise with his lips. “I suppose that’s true.”
"Draco," Harry moaned, sliding his hands under the bottom of Draco's turtleneck, lifting it over his head and throwing it to the side. "You can't take a bloke to Paris, spend the whole day speaking French in front of him and then not shag him. It's cruel."
Harry stepped away and went to sit on the bed. Draco dropped down and knelt in front of him. No matter how hard he tried to get close to Harry, it seemed Harry was always pulling away. Draco had no idea how to get through to him, to break down that barrier that Harry kept putting up.
"To help your competition improve," Lucius said with a jeer, dropping his newspaper and folding it up to place it on the table beside him. "While you in turn lose any momentum you had in the competitive skating world."
Draco felt his heart start racing as he began to hope. "You mean –"
Draco pressed his lips together to keep from dropping his jaw at such an impertinent question. “You can’t be serious.”
Their kiss had dominated the news cycle, which was quite the shame as it overshadowed Harry's silver medal and his comeback. Still, Draco couldn't bring himself to regret kissing Harry so publicly. Yet another impulsive decision. Those seemed to be happening a lot where Harry was concerned.
Harry cringed slightly. “I haven’t had to cast one since I was hunting Horcruxes,” he confessed. “And I’ve never cast one on myself. I don’t know how successful it would be. I’d probably get ten steps and reappear like a nob.”
Harry shrugged. “You don’t want to shag, you don’t want to talk about marriage, neither of can see the weather so that’s out. Do you have a better idea for passing the time?”
Zabini looked about to argue, glancing between Draco and Harry. “Fine then,” he said, getting to his feet and sitting at the seat Draco had designated for him.
“So you’re into me because you want to be unhappy,” Draco said, snorting with derision. “You really are ridiculous, Potter.”
After the party, Draco dragged Harry back to his room, the two of them laughing and stumbling over their own feet. While Draco fumbled the key card into the slot, Harry squeezed in close behind him, making his interest known, pressing sloppy kisses to Draco's neck. Once Draco finally succeeded in opening the door, he shoved Harry inside and led him over to the bed.
“I thought you’d notice. Stupid really, but I thought maybe once I stopped doing Quidditch you’d realize something was off, or perhaps when I stopped our usual banter. No, the Great Harry Potter didn’t notice all my cries for help.”
“So I’m the next crisis then?” Draco said as evenly as he could considering Potter was right in his face, their breath mingling, making Draco’ far begin to race.
Harry's eyes widened in surprise at Draco's words, and then his lips twitched with the want to smile.
“I know.” Harry slipped off the bed, pulling his pants up in a little hop movement that Draco did his best not to find kind of adorable. “Get dressed.”
Draco sputtered for a moment, completely aghast. “You don’t – “
Their eyes met and it felt like some ignited between them. Harry let out a low moan and then his cock was twitching and spilling down Draco’s throat. It only took two more strokes and Draco was coming as well, his mouth still working Harry through the aftershocks as his release coated his hand.
Narcissa reached out and cupped Draco's cheek in her hand. Her grey eyes turned sad as if she knew the chances of Draco returning to the Manor were slim. "Be well, my son."
Harry did eventually break the kiss, an easy smile on his face as he did so. He looked so content that Draco hated to kill the mood but unfortunately it seemed to be what he did best. “You’re not actually dense enough to think this will actually work, are you?”
"If he's not at the rink, then he'll be at Luna's place," she said with a sigh. "Can't miss it, it's the only bright purple building in town."
"You will be," Harry said with conviction, giving Draco's hand a squeeze.
"I don't, Harry," Draco insisted, wanting to reach out for him again but not knowing how. "I love…being your coach. It's just been a bad day. I'm sorry I took that out on you. You know I don't know what to say when you cry."
Draco nodded and managed to pull Harry into a hug. He was nearly a head taller than Harry so Harry tucked perfectly under his chin. They stayed like that for a while, Harry slowly relaxing in his arms and the tension bleeding out of him. Draco felt the same happening to his own body. The hurt and tension he'd been carrying since that afternoon were being released;  the knots in his back slowly untangling. A part of him wanted to thank Harry, for being there, for being so much more than Draco ever thought he deserved. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, forcing himself to remember that this was about Harry. He had already failed Harry once today and he was damned if he was going to do it again by bringing his own insecurities into it.
Draco took a deep breath and let it out shakily. "I can't hold your hand through everything, Harry. Either skate to win or don't, but I can't win gold for you. Stop pinning everything on me. It's pathetic."
"Will you send me those videos?" Draco asked once Harry was out of earshot.
“Do you know what today is Malfoy?” Potter asked, kicking off his trainers. Draco winced at the amount of mud caked on the bottoms of them. He winced again when he saw Harry’s Holly Harpies socks. It made Draco think of that wretched Weasley girl, although if the Prophet were to be believed – which was almost never – Harry and the Weaslette had split a while back.
"Probably about what a pain in the arse I am," Harry said, laughing nervously and rubbing the back of his neck.
"Thank you, mother."
Harry looked caught off guard, his eyes searching Draco's. "I don't want you to leave."
When they arrived back at the hotel room, Draco made sure to take care of Harry the way he wished someone had always taken care of him after a bad performance. He iced Harry's feet for a bit and then drew him a hot bath. Harry sat amongst the bubbles still looking a little lost with Draco sitting on the floor beside the tub. Draco wished he knew what to do – either as Harry's coach or as his partner – but he was sadly ill-equipped to deal with this situation. He knew that nothing anyone said had ever made him feel better after he'd messed up a routine. He had a feeling that Harry was very similar to him in that regard.
Draco sighed at yet another one word answer. Why was he having so much trouble getting through to him? "Do you want to know why I'm here, Harry?"
Draco had never felt like this before, like every emotion inside him was going to spill out if he so much as removed his hand from his mouth. He was proud and humbled and in awe of the skater Harry had become.
Potter. There’s always another explanation.”
“There’s still all the reporters outside,” Draco said, not about to entertain the idea that they’d given up and gone home. It would have taken quite a news story for that to happen and hardly anything was more newsworthy than Harry Potter.
"But Draco –"
“I’m sorry?” Harry said, putting his finger behind his ear. “I think I must have misheard you.”
“I’ll just apparate home,” Harry said, fixing his glasses from when he’d been yanked down.
“I don’t like it any more than you do,” Harry said, watching Draco pace. “It’s the only logical explanation for what’s happened to us.”
“Don’t call me Malfoy,” Draco said, staring at Harry in disbelief. “Honestly!”
"Goodbye, mother."
Draco laughed and wiped his eyes on the back of his hand. She always did have an uncanny ability to make him feel better with just a few words. Growing up, Draco hadn't had many friends as most of his free time was spent skating. Pansy had been one of the rare few from school that had taken the time to get to know him.
So fate had decided they were each other’s perfect half. That was… “Just great,” Harry grumbled to himself unhappily, putting his chin in his hands. He decided he was entitled to a bit of a sulk about this. After all, his soulmate didn’t even want him. He’d been rejected by the one person who wasn’t supposed to do that!
Zabini’s eyes widened and he looked at Harry as if he’d just said he wanted to live with Moaning Myrtle in the girl’s bathroom. “You only talk about him
"Different how?"
Harry glanced down sheepishly. “It was a mistake.”
“Apparently that’s what you’re into,” Harry teased, giving Draco’s hand a squeeze. “Since I’m your soulmate and all.”
“That wasn’t very nice,” Harry chided him as Draco slid into the chair beside him.
“Uh, back door?” Harry suggested, looking uncertain.
“Even if they’re yours?”
Draco watched from the side as Harry went up onto the podium to receive his first place medal. The cameras flashed and Draco cocked his head to the side, taking it all in. He thought he might feel something, an ache in his chest or some type of jealousy. Instead, all he felt was the love he had for Harry as he stood at the top of the podium with Viktor and Cedric on either side.
After being brushed off yet again by Harry, Draco went into his bedroom and flopped down on the bed. He decided to Facetime Pansy, just to see a friendly face. The Potters (minus Harry) were friendly enough and Draco had made acquaintances with Ron and Hermione, who owned the local ice rink, but none of them were making him feel any less lonely being in London.
Harry rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes as if hoping everything would shift and the green of his duvet would be switched to red. Maybe this was just Fred and George playing a very elaborate prank on him. He really hoped so.
Harry groaned before Draco even finished his thought. “That
“Fuck,” Harry breathed out, his eyes dragging over Draco greedily. “Maybe lunch was a bad idea.”
"Hi, I'm Harry," he said to Pansy, holding his hand out to her.
"Harry has always been a good skater," Hermione continued as if Draco hadn't spoken. "He's got a lot of natural talent but not a lot of training. He pushes himself past his limits and that's why he had his accident at the Grand Prix. He'll deny it, but I know that's why. He wanted to be like you so he tried for a jump he wasn't ready for, and it cost him a lot."
"He's overrated," Draco said snippily, crossing his arms over his chest.
"How long are you in town for?" Pansy asked, polishing off her croissant and then wiping her fingers on a napkin.
“Zabini, I’m partnering with Malfoy today,” Draco said, taking Zabini’s books and depositing them on the seat in front of where he was currently sitting. “Move.”
“You went through my stuff?” Harry said incredulously. “Why not just invade all my privacy while you’re at it!”
"Yes, Harry?"
Harry's next jump was a triple flip, one of his specialties but he  over-rotated. Draco bit down harder on his finger. He could tell that Harry was getting into his own head, letting the pressure affect him.
"Look, I might not know anything about skating, but I know you. Skating is the first thing you didn't immediately give up because you didn't get your way. Remember when you decided you were going to be an artist?"
Draco took a longer sip to keep from having to answer the question. He already knew the answer. He had been steadily falling in love with Harry for months now. Every time he watched Harry skate, it was like his heart grew fuller. Perhaps he had even loved Harry as far back as that first video that had brought them together. Maybe that was why Draco had felt the need to fly to Harry – to be near him – to know him.
“Of course not,” Draco snapped at him. “Don’t be stupid, Potter.”
"No, you didn't!" Harry said angrily, shoving Draco away. "You came so I'll make things more interesting for you. You came to get me back on my feet so that we can go back to being rivals. That means, the minute you think I'm good enough, you'll quit on me. Never mind that you're the reason I'm like this to begin with!"
“What?” Draco asked, feeling a bit like he was getting conversational whiplash.
As Cedric Diggory took the ice, Harry dropped his hands down to watch his skate. Cedric was impressive, and Draco could see Harry starting to despair the longer he watched. "Come on," Draco said, tugging on Harry's sleeve. "We don't need to watch. Let's go."
Draco felt like he was getting a better handle on Harry's moods – the nerves he felt before a skate, the fear of not landing a jump and having another accident, the humiliation of disappointing everyone rooting for him. He had done well during the short program – earning another personal best and landing in the top spot – but now it was time for the free skate. During the warm-up, Harry had fallen when  attempting a quadruple lutz. Draco could tell that Harry was upset with himself but also terrified of what that would mean during his performance. Unfortunately, due to his top place ranking, Harry was up first to skate and that meant he had no time to recover from his terrible practice jump. Draco could only hope Harry could shake it off.
“Suitable?” Draco echoed with a sneer to cover up the hurt in his voice at the insinuation. “Tell me, Potter what’s so unsuitable about me?”
Draco shrugged. “I got bored. Spending time with Weasley and Granger is so frightfully dull.”
"I'm always right," Pansy said, feeding Bruno a treat. "Isn't that right, mon petit?"
"Anything Harry," Draco told him, gathering the precome at the tip and sliding it down Harry's shaft. "Whatever you want."
Harry huffed in amusement and kissed Draco again. “As if I’d expect you to let me get away with anything.”
Harry hiccoughed slightly and then smiled down at Draco. Draco couldn't help chuckling. "That's quite the compliment, Harry." He took Harry into his mouth and began to bob his head. Draco prided himself at being very good at this. He might never have been able to keep a boyfriend long term but he knew this was one area in which he was not lacking.
“Draco,” Harry said, interrupting his reverie. “You know what this means.”
Draco sat up in his bed and glared at Potter from across the room. “My marital status is none of your business. My life in general is none of your business. Just because you barged into my flat doesn’t mean you’re allowed into my life, Potter.”
"Harry!" Draco threw his arms around him and hugged him tightly. "You don't know how happy I am to hear that!"
“Then what else have you got?” Harry needled once again.
"Thanks!" Harry looked over the pastries and picked out a chouquette. Draco got another mug down and filled it with coffee for Harry to enjoy with his breakfast. He wasn't sure how Harry took it so he pushed it over to him and watched as Harry put in two sugars and a splash of milk. Draco made a mental note of it for the next morning.
Draco closed the book on rare potions he’d been reading and raised an eyebrow at Harry. “You’re always welcome to leave and find entertainment elsewhere.”
“I think I’ve got it from here,” Harry said almost breathlessly.
Hermione dropped her chin in her hand and gave him an exasperated look. "Why do you think?"
"I don't want to hear it!" Draco yelled, wiping furiously at his eyes. "Why did I bother helping you if you were just going to throw it away? My career is over, Harry, but yours is just getting started! How can you be this selfish?"
"Draco –"
“Me?” Harry shot back challengingly. “You’re the one who apparently goes around snogging Blaise Zabini and who knows who else! He kissed me this morning. He didn’t even ask. You two must be pretty cozy!”
,” Blaise said, pointing his wand at Harry and whispering
Draco growled lowly and pushed the power button on his phone a little harder than was strictly necessary. It couldn't end that way. It was just so pathetic. Draco wouldn't allow Potter to go out like that after such a promising start to last season. He had to do something, but he had no idea what.
“I tried and failed to tame this fucking monster you call hair, Potter,” Draco said, blowing some of the unruly fringe off his forehead. “Honestly, how do you live like this?”
“Quite handy this cloak,” Draco said, smirking over at Harry.
“Should I send a letter to Azkaban or will just your mum’s permission do?” Harry asked with a wry smile.
bad.”
Harry worked his jaw, looking ready to argue some more, but they called for all the skaters to get off the ice except for Harry. Draco reached out to touch Harry's hand, but Harry pushed away from the wall before he could. He still looked angry as he made his way out onto the ice, and Draco could only hope he would be able to use it in his performance. Maybe Draco had managed to light a fire under him that would help him forget all his other insecurities.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ll call you whatever I like.”
"The only reason he wants to stay on as coach is because he's fucking that little fairy –"
Draco shook his head. "The paparazzi did snap a few photos of us at the airport so it's only a matter of time. But I haven't spoken to them since I left for London."
"When he says it's nothing it's always something," Pansy filled Harry in knowingly.
"Aren't you two just adorable?" Blaise cooed, clasping his hands together. "I never thought I'd see you two doing more than hate fucking each other."
Draco nodded. "I've decided to take a year off and think about my career. In the meantime, I thought I might help out Harry."
"I used to be," Harry said, shoving his hands in his pockets. "Ever since I was about thirteen and I saw your debut in the senior division."
Harry's green eyes sparkled for a moment and he nodded. Grinning determinedly, he pushed off from the wall and went to center ice.
"Draco!" Harry cried out, his hands fisted on either side of the pillow, his release spilling onto the bed beneath him. Draco wasn't far behind, lasting only a few moments more before the sight of Harry coming undone beneath him was too much. He buried himself inside his lover and let go.
Potter gave him a sour expression in return. “I don’t enjoy that kind of thing, you know.”
“A list you’ve been number one in for the past three years running,” Draco scoffed, transferring some bacon onto a plate and slapping Potter’s hand when he tried to reach for it.
He pulled off and sucked in a breath, resting his forehead against Harry's hip for a moment. Then he stood back up and tugged Harry to the bed. "Mon coeur," Draco whispered, gently pushing Harry down and climbing on top of him. "Mon coeur est à toi."
"You didn't even tell them you were taking a year off?" Pansy asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow at him.
"Merde."
Harry’s eyebrow quirked up in amusement as he quickly undid Draco’s flies, shoving his trousers and pants down in one go. “What would you like to call me then?” Harry asked, licking a stripe up the underside of Draco’s cock and making Draco whine at how obscene that looked. His cock twitched with interest, a bit or precum dribbling out of the tip.
"I am," Draco said, looking meaningfully over at Harry. "Bit difficult when he doesn't show up for practice."
A melancholia had settled over them as Harry did his stretches for his final skate. Neither of them had talked much after their fight the previous evening. Nothing had been settled except that Harry would make his decision after his final skate. Draco didn't know how to explain to Harry that he felt he had nothing left to offer the sport except as Harry's coach. A version of him would live on in Harry but Draco had no interest in pursuing his skating career.
Draco shook his head. “You’re such a git, Potter.”
Harry snorted in amusement. “Come on,” he prodded, poking Draco in the foot. Draco immediately pulled his knees up towards his chest, getting every part of him away from Potter. “I want to know.”
Draco laughed and finally managed to get his key out of the door. He kicked it shut behind him and pressed Harry up against the closest available wall. "I love you," he said and cupped Harry's face in his hands, tilting it perfectly so that he could control the kiss. Harry's arms fell limply to his sides and he moaned against Draco's mouth.
"Harry, we can't," Draco told him, shaking his head slightly. He dropped his hand down to Harry's balls and rolled them against his palm. "Having anal sex this close to competition might affect your performance."
“Tell me what’s going on!” Zabini yelled, continuing to point his wand at Harry. “You’ve been acting weird all day. If this is about last night then just talk to me, Draco. I thought we both knew what we were getting into. We’re at least still friends, right?”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “It will look like a Lover’s weekend, Potter,” Draco said, shoving Harry off of him roughly and causing Harry to drop onto the floor.
“Fine, we can have sex if it will avoid this topic of conversation,” Draco shot back, hoping to dissuade Potter from asking. It wasn’t exactly something he wanted to get into.
"Oh Christ!" Harry cried out, his hand tightening in Draco's hair as the other slapped against the wall as if he were trying to keep it upright.
Draco should have known that wouldn’t be the end of it. He decided to play off his discomfort by joking. “Potter, if you want to propose, you’re going to have to get my parent’s permission – “
Harry ducked his head in embarrassment. "It's just a good luck charm," he murmured sheepishly.
"Harry," Draco said, his tone chiding. "I didn't fly to London just to speak to you through the door."
It was supposed to be their first day of training together, picking Harry's short program and free skate. Draco had a playlist on Spotify of songs he thought might fit in case Harry didn't have any music picked out. Draco had always picked his own music, but he didn't want to overwhelm Harry, especially not after their disastrous interaction the day before.
Harry frowned. “What choice do I have?”
“So why do you hate me?” Harry asked, stretching his legs out and crossing them at the ankles.
“That’s quite enough, Blaise.”
"About that…" Draco carded his fingers through his hair nervously. "I don't know if it will just be the one year."
Draco rolled his eyes. "You just saw me at Skate America, remember?"
Harry’s face immediately fell and he slipped out of Draco’s embrace. “Why not?”
“Sorry about that,” Harry said contritely. “Must look strange, us sitting together.”
"I'm angry, okay?" Draco said, trying to blink the tears away. "Harry, you can't let one little mistake derail your whole career."
Harry pulled his hands away and backed up. "If I say yes, will you get out of my room?"
It took a bit of work to get the head past the ring of muscles. "Relax," Draco whispered, pressing a kiss between Harry's shoulder blades. "Let me in."
Draco rolled his eyes. "You're going to make him fat."
Draco had one final trick up his sleeve as Harry's coach. He grabbed the front of Harry's costume and pulled him forward. "Harry, I took a year off to be your coach. I've now extended that to continue on helping you. But I have no interest in coaching someone who can't win gold."
“No I don’t,” Draco hissed at him in a bold faced lie.
“What is it?” Harry called out, making his way over.
"Harry isn't here."
Draco ripped himself away and began to pace the length of the courtyard. It was impossible. He couldn’t be Harry Potter’s soulmate. The idea was just too preposterous to comprehend. It had to be something else. Dark magic or some kind of mistake.
"So I had nothing to do with it?"
"Draco, darling, you're looking well," his mother said, taking his arm and guiding him over to the empty chair.
Harry scoffed. "That's not exactly likely, is it?" he teased, tugging his fingers through his hair. "Even when you're being pleasant you're still a disagreeable sod, rude and ill-tempered. I'm not exactly expecting it to be a walk in the park. I'm hoping it will at least get easier though. Anything else you've got?"
Draco froze for a few seconds, his mind whirling with questions, and then he reacted. He shoved Harry back, taking some satisfaction at watching Harry stumble. “What the hell, Potter!”
Harry laughed and hugged Draco back. They stayed holding each other until they could hear them call Harry up next. They walked together through the curtain and prepared for Harry to go onto the ice.
The six that had made it to the Grand Prix Final ensured stiff competition. There was Blaise Zabini of the United States, Theodore Natsuko of Japan, Viktor Krum of Russia, Cedric Diggory of Switzerland, Cormac McLaggen of Canada, and of course Harry rounding them out. Draco knew that Viktor Krum would be a fierce competitor this season as he had won gold at both the Trophée de France and the Rostelecom cup. Karkaroff as his coach was likely to push Viktor hard to make up for Draco leaving – a chance to save some face after losing his best skater.
“Sixth year,” Draco answered smoothly. “My father got sent to Azkaban because of you and I was forced to take his place. Prove my family’s worth to the Dark Lord and kill Dumbledore. All fucking year I thought this won’t happen. I won’t even get near Dumbledore. Harry Potter will save the day as usual.”
"No!" Harry said quickly, waving his hands around.
"That better not be directed at me. I have it on good authority that I'm very pretty when I beg."
Harry laughed and shook his head. “With everything I’ve been through this is hardly enough to surprise me.”
Harry smirked. “So you are accepting we’re soumates then?”
Draco continued on as if Potter hadn’t spoken. It was easier that way and he hadn’t finished speaking his piece. “Then when we dueled in the bathroom and you nearly killed me, I think I hated you most of all for not finishing me off,” Draco confessed softly. “I wanted to die so badly. It would have been a relief. You couldn’t give me that either.”
"How long are you going to keep me waiting?" Draco asked, softening his tone slightly. "You're better than everyone here. Show them."
"It's worse than that, father," Draco said, keeping his voice as even as possible. "I'm not just fucking him – I'm also in love with him." Draco let his lips curl into the distinct Malfoy sneer. "Just wait until the papers hear about that."
The heady scent of Potter filled his nostrils until there was nothing but Harry, surrounding him and invading his ever sense. His jaw ached from the stretch but he wouldn’t stop. He had a point to prove, damn it, and he was going to get Potter off. He glanced up and found Potter staring at him, eyes wide behind his glasses, his jaw dropped and breathing too hard to keep it closed.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, next time,” he repeated, tugging on Draco’s arm until Draco moved and settled next to Harry on the bed. Potter arranged them so they were pressed up against each other with Potter half on top of him, one of Potter’s legs thrown of Draco’s, his arm around Draco’s middle.
Harry kept that same look of determination on his face as the music swelled and his program began. Draco watched but didn't have the same stomach knots he normally had because this wasn't the end of their time together. There would be more competitions and more choreography. Draco would still get to design a program and watch it being executed – only this time he wouldn't be on his own.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes. "I told you, I'm here to be your coach." Draco pushed his way into Harry's room, ignoring Harry's protests. "And from what your parents told me, you're in need of a coach anyway so it seems like my timing is perfect."
It didn't take Draco long to figure out that Harry had disobeyed his order and was going back to doing the quads. When Draco knew the first one was coming, his heart felt like it was going to burst, and he found himself holding his breath. The moment Harry's feet touched the ice, Draco threw his arms in the air in celebration. Considering Harry hadn't landed it in practice, the speed and height of the jump had been perfect.
Draco put his arm down and chewed his bottom lip. “You don’t even like me. We’ll drive each other crazy.”
"You will," Draco said with conviction. "And even if you don't, I am so proud of you."
“I heard you tossing one off in the bathroom last night,” Harry said, stabbing at some of his eggs a bit more forceful than was strictly necessary. “So apparently I’m not the only idiot here.”
Draco scoffed. “I’m insulted that you think I can’t get creative with my comments.”
As Harry began his routine, Draco felt tension throughout his entire body. He knew Harry would be thinking about his accident a year ago, and that thoughts of it were threatening his concentration. He could only hope Harry could push past it and focus on the routine.
"Thank you," Draco said, pushing off the wall and leaving Hermione to her sums.
Draco growled angrily. “Well that’s just great, Potter! Why did you have to come to my flat? Now when you leave every wizard paper in Britain is going to have a picture of it.”
Harry scratched at his chin pensively as he mulled it over. “I wouldn’t say I don’t like you,” he finally responded. “I would say I don’t know you all that well. You still keep a lot hidden, Draco, even after all these years. I want to know more, though. There’s at least some potential, yeah?”
was speaking to him of all people? Draco turned his face up to see who was standing over his bed and was shocked to find everything was blurry.
“Next time?” Draco echoed in surprise. He hadn’t exactly thought there would be repeat performances.
"Really?" Harry asked, smiling softly.
However, thirty minutes after they were meant to meet, Harry still wasn't there. Draco tried and failed not to take it personally that Harry was essentially wasting his time when he'd come here to help him. If he weren't on such awkward footing with Harry, he would chew the guy out for blowing him off.
Harry grinned approvingly and finally –
When he stepped into the room, his mother stood up to greet him. He smiled warmly at her and embraced her when she put her arms around him. Despite some of her shortcomings, Draco really did love his mother. She was the main reason he was even there for lunch. Both his parents came from a long line of French aristocrats and had very conservative ideals. So while his mother didn't exactly support his being gay, she did her best to still love him, and that was about as much as Draco could ask for under the circumstances.
"You're right," Draco said, sighing heavily. "Thank you."
All those years he’d wanted Potter as his friend – and then had turned into just wanting him when he discovered he liked blokes – he’d let himself daydream of having just a fraction of this. It was something his Aunt Bella had tortured him about endlessly during their Occlumency lessons. Every time she invaded his mind – even the deepest corners where he tried to keep these feelings hidden – she’d find some thought or memory of Harry and force Draco to face it, laughing that cackle of hers. Then there’d been the war and the trial and there hadn’t been time for daydreams.
Draco felt heat prickle the corner of his eyes. "That's disappointing." He was caught off guard by Harry's declaration. He knew Harry was taking the missed jump hard, but he hadn't expected him to be this upset about it.
"Draco, I'll be fine," Harry insisted with a reassuring smile. He reached out and put his hand over Draco's. "You haven't seen your parents in months. It's just a lunch with them so how long could it last? You'll make it to the competition in plenty of time."
“Both please.”
“I think you’re right,” Draco said, looking down at his hands.
He had just finished showing Harry the bedroom and was turning to go back to the sitting room when Harry grabbed him by his collar. Draco yelped in surprise as Harry pushed him against the wall. "Draco, I've been waiting for weeks for you to make a move."
the time. What’s gotten into you?”
“Sometimes,” Draco said with a noncommittal shrug. Since the war, Potter, Weasley and Granger had started almost an outreach programme, helping people whose lives were destroyed by the war regardless of side. It had made Draco feel like their pet project but Draco hardly would have been employable without Harry backing him. Sometimes the knowledge of that had Draco seething with anger. He and Potter weren’t exactly friends but they tolerated each other on occasion. Now that apparently included late night visits and cups of tea with impromptu kissing.
Harry snorted. “Where would I even begin, Malfoy?”
Draco sniffled and turned on his side. "I think coming here might have been a mistake."
"Draco, please!" Harry begged once again, his voice broken and needy. "Please!"
“Good night, Malfoy.”
Draco chuckled and put his arm around Harry. "It's nothing to be embarrassed about. You looked stunning as always." Harry blushed an even darker shade of red, and Draco couldn't help pressing a kiss to his cheek.
Draco liked to imagine he would handle this sort of thing very calmly. His father had taught him to be calm and collected under pressure.
Harry glowered at him, wondering just what the bloody hell Zabini thought he was playing at. “Excuse me?”
"We should change the quads in the second half to triples," Draco told him decisively as he handed Harry his water.
"A gentleman never kisses and tells," Draco informed her. He turned his back and began to make them coffee. He knew that wouldn't be the end of it, but he could at least pretend.
Harry scowled at him, but Luna was immediately apologetic. "Oh Harry, you didn't tell me you had practice. I wouldn't have kept you."
"Boys, please," Narcissa intervened, also getting to her feet and standing between her husband and her son. She placed her hands on Lucius' chest and murmured something Draco couldn't hear to placate her husband. "Draco is strong-willed. I'm sure he won't have a problem getting back into skating if that's what he wants."
Harry pulled the plug on the bath and got out. He wrapped a towel around his waist and followed Draco into the bedroom. "Draco – this is for the best –"
“Look, I know you’re annoyed that we’re trapped in here but it’s not going to go by any faster by being nasty to me. Trust me, I had a very long childhood.”
"Tu es à moi," Draco breathed out, placing one hand beside Harry's head, while the other was wrapped around Harry's cock. Harry groaned and pressed up into Draco's touch. "Je voudrais te faire l'amour."
"You said anything I want," Harry reminded him, wrapping his legs around Draco's waist and using them to pull Draco more fully on top of him. "Come on, I won't break and the competition isn't for a few days."
"Of course," Draco whispered, clasping his hand in the back of Harry's hair and bringing their lips together. This was nothing like the chaste kiss they had shared in front of the cameras. Already it was something deeper, something heated, Draco licking his way into Harry's mouth to claim what Harry had offered gladly.
“I’m not
"I'm not incapable of it, you know," he said indignantly. He rifled through the pastries until he found a cheese Danish and bit into it.
Everyone turned to look at Harry, who had taken on a kind of sickly green complexion. It reminded Draco of the color of his room upstairs.
“I’m not done,” Draco snapped at him. Honestly, Harry was absolutely infuriating. Draco wondered how Weasley and Granger could stand it. “You saved everyone at Hogwarts, year after year, defeating the Dark Lord. It was the one thing you were good for at school and you always came through except for me. You never saved me.”
"Draco…are you crying?" Harry asked, clearly surprised. Draco couldn't remember ever crying in front of Harry before. It must have been quite the sight.
"Oh hello," the woman, who Draco could only assume was Luna, said in the softest voice he had ever heard. "You must be Draco. Harry told me you were here to help him with his skating."
“Yep, that’s definitely Draco,” Blaise said, rolling his eyes as he got to his feet. “Have fun you two love birds.”
Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand, lacing their fingers together. It was beyond strange holding his own hand. “I’m not…upset that you’re my soulmate. If that helps.”
"Yes."
Draco winkled his nose in distaste. He really would have shagged Potter instead of answer the question. But he knew Potter was a stubborn sod that wouldn’t drop it so awkward conversation it was. “You’re Harry Potter,” Draco said simply.
“They follow me a lot,” Harry explained with a small shrug. “Someone must have seen me come here last night. Normally I’m a lot better at giving them the slip but last night I wasn’t paying that much attention. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve been camped out for a while.”
"Why you –" Lucius raised his arm to strike, but Narcissa grabbed his arm. Lucius looked back at her for a moment and then lowered his arm. "Get out."
Harry opened the door, leaning against the frame casually with his arms crossed. “Charming,” he said sardonically. “What did I say that set you off this time?”
"Lucius, darling, it's his decision," Narcissa said, trying to calm her husband. She turned to Draco and gave him a reassuring smile. "Are you sure that's what you want, Draco? You've worked so hard and you could still have a career."
He shoved himself up against the stone wall. “Let me guess - Potter?”
"No problem," Blaise said with a wink.
Draco huffed irately. "My mother just texted to invite me to lunch on Wednesday."
"Wait – " Draco began but Pansy had already ended the call. Exhaling loudly, Draco got up and went down the hall to Harry's room. Yawning slightly, he stretched his arms over his head and then knocked on the door. Harry poked his head out and his face visibly crumpled when he saw it was Draco.
Harry scowled at him from where he’d landed less than gracefully. “Maybe I could send an owl to Ron or Hermione and they could bring me my invisibility cloak.”
Harry turned around and closed the door behind him. Draco could hear his footsteps and he retreated to the guest room. Finally, Draco had some peace and quiet. He founded he hated Potter all the more for it.
“Let’s just get through today in one piece, okay?” Draco said, opening his book.
"Very well. You can be my coach."
“Psst, Harry!”
Draco turned away, sliding his fingers through his hair and his palm resting against his forehead. "I'm not so good with people crying. Should I just kiss you again?"
Draco hurried from the room, being sure to shut the door behind him to give Potter some privacy. He went into the bathroom and shoved his hands down his own trousers, wrapping his long thin fingers around his cock. He was almost angry with his body for reacting in such a way to Harry Potter of all people. Not that he hadn’t wanked over Potter before, as there had been some fantastic fantasies he’d had at school. It was quite another thing to be this turned on based on the fact that he had turned Harry on in the first place.
Draco groaned in frustration. He’d never be rid of Potter if this kept up. It seemed Potter hand managed to put his shirt back on although he still hadn’t bothered with trousers. “This is intolerable.”
“Malfoy –“
Draco had to admit it had been a bit of a stretch. While he knew there would be quite a bit of backlash over this, it would be nothing compared to previous times in his life. But this time there would be Harry and they’d be weathering it together. “You can’t be serious, Potter,” Draco said, shaking his head in disbelief. “You want to give this a proper go?”
"You have with all the others," Pansy reminded him. Bruno bounded back into the kitchen with the ball in his mouth. "Drop it."
Harry rushed off towards the bedroom, and Bruno went to follow him. "Bruno stay," Draco said sternly. Bruno sat, but immediately looked back at Draco and whined at him. "Don't give me that. You'll live."
Once the video was done, he pulled up a side-by-side comparison video of Potter and Draco doing the same routine. Potter wasn't quite as graceful as Draco, but that might have had something to do with his height and weight. He had put on at least a stone since last year's Grand Prix, probably from just sitting at home and not skating. Yet, there was something about the way Potter skated – a melancholia and beauty to it – even if Draco's version was perfect on a technical level. It also seemed Potter had turned all the quads into triples, probably because he was hesitant after his accident.
Draco felt his own nerves ratchet up when it became time for the quad flip. He knew how bad Harry wanted to land it, and Draco felt his breath hitch as it got closer. Harry had good speed going into the jump and he just had to keep up his momentum. As he landed, one hand touched the ice, but at least he hadn't fallen. Still, Draco could see how visibly upset Harry was as he finished out the program.
Harry looked beautiful, strong yet graceful, showing no sign of fatigue as he went into his final jump. Draco bit his bottom lip hard enough to draw blood, clutching the siding in front of him. Harry was already in the air, taking what felt like forever to touch back down. In anticipation, Draco’s breath caught and his hands flew to the side of his face.
“You call this welcoming?” Potter asked, raising an eyebrow. “You haven’t even offered me a drink!”
“I’m afraid so.”
They moaned in unison as Harry's body unclenched, and Draco was able to thrust deeper inside. He continued until he was in to the hilt and then stayed still to allow Harry to adjust. "Oh," Harry gasped, dropping his head and letting it hang between his shaking arms.
"Oh how I've missed these little pep talks, Igor," Draco said, slipping out of Karkaroff's grip without ever even looking at his old coach. "Now if you'll excuse me, I must congratulate my skater on a wonderful performance. Dasvidaniya."
Draco's brow furrowed in confusion. "I don't understand what you mean."
It was indeed easy to find the only purple building in town, but Draco hadn't expected it to be a dance studio. He made his way up the steps to the second floor and found Harry at the bar standing behind a petite blond woman,copying her moves. Draco watched from the doorway as Harry lifted his leg, his left arm raised above his head.
"Oh," Hermione said, biting her bottom lip nervously. "He was so excited to finally get to skate. I'm surprised."
“I was just a kid back then,” Harry said defensively. “I had a lot going on. I was paying attention, Draco. I just thought you’d become a Death Eater. I didn’t think there was anything more to it. I thought you were happy to be fulfilling your father’s legacy.”
Draco had always felt like he did everything alone. After turning fifteen, he began picking his own music and choreographing his own routines to tell a story. Karkaroff had mostly just been there to yell at him when he screwed up. He hoped that Harry knew – whether he got on the podium or not – he wasn't doing this alone.
Unlike Potter, Draco didn’t bother with teasing. He swallowed Harry down, his throat muscles fluttering at the intrusion as Harry’s cock pressed back against them. “Oh shit,” Harry cursed above him. Draco pulled back slowly, hollowing his cheek to give Harry one long, hard suck and felt liquid on his tongue as more precum came from the tip.
Draco risked a glance at Harry and noticed his jaw was dropped in surprise. Whatever he had been expecting Draco to say, school rivalry or some such thing, it hadn’t been what he’d thought. “And when was I meant to do that?”
Draco grinned and took a long sip of his champagne. "I'm sure Harry is more than up to the task of giving you a run for your money. After all, he placed above you at Skate America. I have no doubt he'll do it again."
Harry walked over and sat beside Draco on the bed. Draco wordlessly handed over the invisibility cloak and Harry tucked it under his arm. “So what did you want to talk about?” he asked, breaking the uncomfortable silence.
"You've been less than welcoming since I've been here," Draco reasoned, pressing Harry against the side of the ridiculous purple building.
The way his body moved to the music was so different from the way Draco skated. Harry looked impatient; like his body couldn't keep up with how desperately he wanted to let the piece flow through him. It was mesmerizing, and Draco wouldn't have been able to look away even if he'd wanted to.
“I suppose,” Draco said, glancing around the room and noticing quite a few sets of eyes staring at them. He tightened his grip on his book and elected to ignore them.
“What’s going on?”
"No!" Harry responded quickly. "Don't stop."
“I’m perfectly fine, thank you!” Draco scoffed, turning around and pulling his chair in to get as far away from the weasel as possible. He could feel Harry staring at him and so he glanced over. “What?”
“We go to a school for
"Say it again," Harry murmured against Draco's lips.
Draco kept his hand raised for a moment and then let it drop onto the railing. He couldn't believe this was going to be the last time Harry skated this program that they had created together. It felt like so long ago that Draco had shown up in London to surprise Harry and become his coach. Things were very different now, and Draco had never cared this much about another person. He wanted Harry's happiness above all else. Perhaps he wasn't too selfish to be a coach after all.
There had been some speculation about what would happen to Potter's career, but the English skater had been remarkably quiet about the whole thing. It had been six months and not a word to the press about it. His coach, Minerva McGonagall, had stayed remarkably tight-lipped about the whole thing as well. All his posts on his Instagram had just been of his family and friends, nothing whatsoever about skating. At least not until that night.
Harry smiled softly and surged up onto his toes to kiss Draco. "If I wanted a proper coach, I wouldn't be sticking with you," he teased after breaking the kiss.
Draco sighed and captured Harry's lips once again. If he were a better coach he would insist on them doing something else. Yet he could already feel himself relenting and he couldn't deny this was something he wanted. He reached into the nightstand and pulled out a bottle of lube and a condom. "You can tell me to stop at any time if you're uncomfortable."
"What do you mean?"
“I’m always used to there being a next crisis,” Harry told him, sliding his legs back behind him and then crawling towards Draco. He stopped when he was a few mere inches from Draco. Up close his eyes looked so bloody green that they’re almost startling to look at.
Draco laughed and captured Harry's lips again, ignoring his ridiculous suggestion. Coaching was what you did when your career was over. Draco wasn't about to give up his career when he was just twenty-five. He still had at least two years before people started saying he was too old for the sport, maybe three if he stayed in top form.
“Did you call me Harry?” Draco asked, scowling at Weasley.
“What’s so wrong with that, eh?” Harry asked, peeking his eyes open. “You know a lot of your comments are going to lose their bite now that I know you fancy me.”
Harry's breath hitched slightly, and he wrapped his hands around Draco's wrists to hold him in place. "You mean that?"
"It's not just that," Harry said, bringing his knees up to his chest. "We agreed you would only take a year off to be my coach. You belong on the ice, Draco. You can make your comeback -"
"That's right boy, we saw you kissing him for all the world to see," Lucius spat out venomously. He stepped around Narcissa and got into his son's face. "Having your shame plastered all over the papers. You've single-handedly ruined this family's reputation."
Harry landed the jump, but a moment later his hand touched the ice briefly to stabilize himself. It would mean a deduction in points, but he definitely had enough rotations for it to count as a quad. Draco had never felt anything quite like this – a heart pounding rush of emotion – not even during his own skating career. When Harry finished out his routine, Draco was already moving, rushing to meet Harry as he got off the ice.
"Don't you dare disrespect your coach," Lucius said, rising to his feet. "He's been with you from the beginning. He's the reason you have all those medals."
Harry’s short program was about a triumph of will, a man forced to beat three tasks: fighting a dragon, stealing treasure from mermaids and fighting his way through a maze with many monsters.
Blaise snorted. “Angry with you?” he said with a knowing smirk. “I doubt it. I’m pretty sure this is the best day of his life. I mean Harry Potter is his soulmate.”
It took a while and a lot of work to get Harry back to the weight he had been during his last Grand Prix series. Draco refused to let Harry skate until he shed the weight, so their days were spent jogging and hitting the gym instead. Draco did everything he could to try and get close to Harry, but it seemed like Harry wasn't interested in them getting to know each other.
“Don’t worry, Potter, I’m sure your sparkling reputation is safe no matter what kind of genitals you like,” Draco drawled, divvying up the scrambled eggs between the two plates.
Draco shoved the glasses onto his face and suddenly the world went into focus. He glanced around and realized why all he’d been able to see was red. He was in the Gryffindor dormitories instead of his own. But why on Earth had he fallen asleep here? Was it some sort of plot between Potter and Weasley? Had they hexed him?”
"Draco?" Harry spoke up for the first time since leaving the rink.
Harry nodded and flipped over, pushing himself up onto all fours. Draco bit back a groan at the picture Harry presented. Draco let his eyes rake greedily over Harry's form for a moment and something possessive growled deep in his chest. He tore the condom wrapper open and slipped the condom onto his aching prick. He poured lube over it and then lined himself up, reminding himself to go slowly and not just bury himself inside Harry's eager body.
"It's just different," Draco said with a noncommittal shrug. He grabbed two mugs from the cabinet and filled them with coffee. He took his with milk and one sugar while Pansy liked two sugars and no milk. He slid hers across the counter and took a sip of his own.
"I'm not going to be uncomfortable," Harry insisted, smiling warmly up at Draco. "You'll take care of me like you always do."
"Okay."
"Just the rest of the week," Draco answered with a deep sigh. He hadn't realized how homesick he was until he was back in the flat he had painstakingly decorated. He'd missed his best friend and his dog. He'd also begun to miss skating. The local rink had been like his second home growing up, and he would often trek up there when something was on his mind. It would be hours of skating until he solved it or worked through it. He'd spent a lot of time there after he'd come out to his parents. Sometimes he could still see the look of disappointment on his father's face, and his mother covering to try and seem supportive.
Draco had about half an hour without Potter breathing down his neck before the Savior appeared back in his doorway. “I’m bored.”
“Is that the best you’ve got?” Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest stubbornly. “I don’t care about that.”
Harry's free skate had more jumps in the second half to up the degree of difficulty. If he didn't pull himself together, he would never make it through them all. Draco felt his heart pounding and he wanted nothing more than to hide his eyes behind his fingers like a child watching a scary movie. But there was no way he could look anywhere except at Harry in that moment, even if it made his stomach clench.
Draco had quite enough. It was a bit late for a pity party with Harry Potter of all people. If it was comfort Potter wanted, he’d be better off going to just about anyone else. “Why are you
"It's okay," Harry said, walking to the side of the room and grabbing his bag. "It wasn't anything important. See you later, Luna."
“What are you doing?”
"That's preposterous!" His father shouted, his tone making Draco wince slightly.
Draco sputtered, caught off guard. “Excuse me?”
"Do I ever?" Draco shot back with a smirk.
Harry stopped on the corner where they would finally be able to disapparate. Harry tugged on Draco’s arm until they were standing together facing each other. “In for a penny, right?” Harry said, glancing up at Draco with a knowing smile.
"You don't have to say anything," Harry said quietly, wiping the tears away from his cheeks. "You asked me to trust you, and I do. But it goes both ways, Draco. You have to put a little faith in me too."
"You are?" Harry asked, looking a little caught off guard.
Draco set a pace, keeping his thrusts languid and not wanting to overwhelm Harry – at least not yet. Still, Harry made little ah ah ah sounds every time Draco bottomed out inside him. "So beautiful," Draco murmured against his skin. "So good to me. You don't know how happy you make me, Harry. J'adore."
Harry fixed Draco with a stare, his green eyes suddenly gone hard behind his glasses. “I was miserable so I got pissed,” Harry explained. “But that didn’t help so I thought where do people go to be miserable? Malfoy’s!”
Harry looked about to argue but Draco grabbed his arm and dragged him towards the guest bedroom. Harry shuffled after him, making an indignant sound at being manhandled. Draco shoved him into the room and began helping him undress, not trusting Potter to manage it himself. By the time he’d gotten Harry’s jumper off and went for his belt, he noticed Potter was flushed down to his chest and there was quite an impressive bulge at his crotch.
“What kind of a question is that, Potter?” Draco asked, turning his head and giving Harry a look of utter disdain.
"Exactly. So because you're not immediately the world's greatest coach you're ready to throw in the towel. I don't understand why you went to London, but as your best friend, I understand it was something you needed to do. So now you need to stick with it and just trust that Harry will come around."
"I want you to fuck me," Harry said, chewing on his bottom lip nervously. "I've wanted it for a long time."
"Don't decide anything now," Draco begged him. He had a feeling that Harry was going to continue to argue with him. If they did that then it would be a no and Harry would retire. Draco didn't want him to. "Make your decision after the final skate when you win the gold."
Harry tapped him on the back. "Draco, it's almost time. We should get going."
“Piss off, Potter,” Draco shouted back. “You are the most obnoxious, self-serving, unbelievably thickheaded tosspot I’ve ever had the misfortune to know.”
Harry brushed his fingers over it softly as if he touched them with enough reverence they might disappear on their own. His eyes flickered up to meet Draco’s and the heated expression from moments ago was gone and replaced with something unbelievably sad. Draco worried for a moment it was pity but at a closer look it seemed something more like guilt. Draco wasn’t interested in either so he rolled his hips suggestively. “Come on, Potter, I believe you were on your way to sucking my cock.”
Potter had posted a video of him skating, clearly new footage because the scar on his forehead had faded from red to white. It was in stark contrast to his light brown skin, clearly on display in the video because his hair was slicked back out of his eyes. He wasn't doing his own routine though; he was doing one of Draco's – his program from a year ago that had scored him his sixth gold medal. His eyes snapped up to the medals adorning his bedroom wall and then right back to the screen. He rewound the video to see what he'd missed even though he knew he'd be watching it again anyway.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Can we not do this?"
Draco was good at this, he knew he was good at this. Zabini had begged Draco to suck him off almost daily after the first time he’d done it. In sixth year when he’d been confused and hating himself, getting lost in physical pleasure had been the only release Draco had found from the torment of what he had been ordered to do.
The steps were so familiar that Draco could have closed his eyes and still seen exactly what Harry was doing. Harry looked so confident out there – each movement flawless and precise – none of the doubt that he had at the beginning of the season. Draco couldn't have been more proud as he watched Harry masterfully control the ice. No one could look away from him.
"Do you want to see? I've still got the videos!" Blaise said, pulling out his phone.
"Of course that's what he wants," Lucius said, staring past his wife to fix Draco with his gaze. The same gaze that had forced Draco into obedience his entire life. A gaze that brokered no argument. "He's a champion."
Draco hummed happily against Harry’s lips. “Maybe some things,” he conceded if that meant Harry kissing him some more. To his surprise, Harry did kiss him again. And again. Draco found he couldn’t stop smiling and staring at Harry with his own two eyes with such reverence. “Soulmate.”
Harry wondered if his talk with Draco had done more harm than good. It was clear Draco abhorred the idea of them being soulmates. And clearly he’d already been “having fun” with Zabini so perhaps he had been hoping it was someone else. Sure, Harry hadn’t expected Draco to be his soulmate but it wasn’t like he was going to be a tosser about it.
"I don't really mind, do you?" Draco asked, nuzzling Harry affectionately.
Draco took Harry deep, his nose bumping up against the trimmed bit of pubic hair at the base. He kept his eyes trained on Harry as he deep-throated his cock, pressing his tongue against the underside and massaging it. Harry had his eyes screwed shut as he made little mewling noises. Draco couldn't help feeling a bit smug that he'd gotten Harry worked up so quickly.
He barely had enough energy to pitch the condom in the rubbish bin and do a rudimentary clean up before he passed out with Harry in his arms. Before he fell asleep all he could think was that he wished this could be all the time. That Harry would be there in the flat Draco loved and belong to him completely.
"That isn't your decision to make!" Draco shouted, getting to his feet. "You don't get to pick when and how I return to figure skating."
When he arrived home, Draco booked a flight to London without giving it much thought. He wasn't often impulsive – the last impulsive thing he had done was getting Bruno five years earlier – even though his best friend Pansy had warned him he wouldn't have the time or energy to care for a dog. Luckily, Pansy had fallen in love with Bruno as well and was happy to dogsit when Draco was out of the country for competitions. Other than that, Draco had always kept himself in check, doing what it took to win, except that one night with Potter, of course.
Harry narrowed his eyes at him. “Shut up, Malfoy.”
Draco dislodged his mouth with a wet pop and smiled up at Harry. "You're so beautiful," he said adoringly, easing his fingers from inside Harry. "On your hands and knees is better for your first time."
“Malfoy!” Harry slurred, barging his way into Draco’s flat.
Six time Grand Prix champion and French figure skater Draco Malfoy sat on his bed with his labradoodle Bruno in his lap. His phone was clutched in his hand and he watched a video, swiping away the notifications that came up at the top of the screen. His phone had been blowing up with people telling him to watch Potter's video for the past hour.
“No, I don’t,” Harry cut him off quickly. “It’s in the past Draco, he’s gone and you never were really subservient to him anyway. I saw you on the Astronomy Tower. If you’d really wanted to serve Voldemort you would have killed Dumbledore.”
"I guess I want Harry to have a second chance," Hermione responded with a shrug, picking her pen back up to continue the books. "I think you're his best shot."
Harry kissed with very little finesse, as if he'd never properly kissed anyone before, but had seen the act on television. Draco directed him in what to do, giving little tips and tricks, despite his alcohol-soaked brain. If Harry took offense to being told what to do, he didn't show it, and he was a quick study. Before long, Harry was kissing Draco so well that it made Draco's toes curl.
“Shut it, Potter,” Draco said, giving him a shove. “I spent part of my afternoon in the library looking into soulmate magic. It usually happens when one person is having a crisis of conscience and needs some clarity.”
Harry scowled at him. “What?” he snapped back.
swallowed Draco down, taking him a little over halfway before gagging a bit and backing off. Draco couldn’t help smirking at the idea that Harry Potter was currently choking on his cock. He couldn’t help thinking of all the reporters outside and how much they’d pay to get this story. But this was just for Draco and he realized that he and Harry had a secret together.
Harry proceeded to turn bright red and Draco couldn't help finding it just a little bit endearing. He bit his bottom lip to keep from laughing. "Yes, we've met before," Harry said, narrowing his eyes at Draco just a little. "Why are you here?"
Harry's eyes widened in surprise and he blushed a deep red. "Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone else was here."
Harry blinked his eyes open and was shocked to find he didn’t need his glasses in order to see. He was also a little alarmed by the amount of green in his field of vision. Sitting up, Harry looked around and saw the Slytherins all getting ready, shoving their feet into socks and shoes, tying their silver and green ties. Blaise Zabini looked over and grinned at him.
“You can’t,” Draco snapped at him. Stupid Potter always ruining his life. “There’s wards on my flat that prevent anyone apparating in or out.”
"Harry and I – well he needs me. He needs a coach and I want to be with him. If that means that I retire then –" Draco cut himself off when he heard footsteps coming from down the hall. Pansy gave him a look that very much meant the conversation wasn't over. Harry walked back into the kitchen fully dressed in a t-shirt and sweatpants and only looking a little mortified.
"I did."
“Fuck,” Blaise said from the ground. “You two really have switched bodies.”
Stabbing his arms into his dressing gown, Draco went over to the door and wrenched it open. Harry fucking Potter of all people stood on the other side, leaning heavily against the doorframe. Okay, maybe the ministry would look down on Draco killing the Chosen One. Then again, it seemed Harry was unusually difficult to kill. If the Dark Lord hadn’t managed it, Draco hardly thought he’d be able to.
“You think you triggered it when you kissed Zabini?”
“No!” Draco said, shaking his head emphatically. “Absolutely not, Potter! You are not
“Really?” Draco asked, sounding skeptical. “I would have thought I would be the last one you’d want as a soulmate.”
Harry sat up straight and turned towards Zabini. “What do you mean?”
“Oi Malfoy, having another wank?” Harry called through the door.
Harry’s eyes darted around behind his glasses, examining Draco’s face. Draco wished he were better at Legilimency so he could read Potter’s mind. Although he thought getting lost in Potter’s mind at the moment would be absolutely maddening. He was lost in his own thoughts and didn’t noticed Harry leaning closer until he could smell alcohol on Harry’s breath. Draco barely had a moment to register what was happening before Harry was kissing him.
"Oh Draco!" Blaise Zabini called out, making his way through the crowd. "I can't tell you how I've missed you!"
"It's nice to meet you, Harry," Pansy said, shaking his hand. "Pansy Parkinson, Draco’s long-suffering best friend. I've heard a lot about you."
Harry grinned as if he knew something Draco didn’t, the smug arsehole, leaning against the kitchen counter next to where Draco was making bacon and eggs. “Are you actually
stupid, Malfoy!”
After Harry had snuck a quad flip into his free skate, they had decided to put this jump into his short program as well. They had been working hard on it but Harry's success rate still wasn't high. If Harry wanted a chance to beat Viktor, he would have to up the level of difficulty in his routines. Viktor's strength lay in his jumps – having no issue with the power or speed to execute them flawlessly.
Draco shoved his plate away, having lost his appetite. He got to his feet and stomped down to his bedroom, slamming the door shut after him. He may have been stuck with Harry Potter in his flat but that didn’t mean that Draco had to spend every sodding minute with him. Harry bloody Potter could just entertain himself for a while.
Draco pursed his lips together unhappily. He waved his hand and the curtain closed itself again. Sliding gracefully to his feet, he went into the kitchen and decided that if there was nothing to be done then he was just going to enjoy his breakfast. He dropped heavily back into his chair and did a quick heating charm on his food that had gone cold.
"Harry, I don't have to go," Draco said, turning his hand to lace his fingers through Harry's. He knew his parents had purposefully not invited Harry to this luncheon even though they must have known about him. They had never bothered to meet any of Draco's boyfriends, not that any of them were so great or worth bringing home. Draco hadn't even resented it until now. He wanted them to meet Harry and see how important Harry was to him. "I can't be your coach if I'm not there with you."
"Come in," Draco said, tugging Harry inside. He was excited to show Harry around and share this part of his life with him. He gave Harry a quick tour of his flat and hoped that Harry loved it as much as he did. It had a balcony with a spectacular view of the Seine. He wanted nothing more than to sit at the little two-person table out there, drinking coffee and watching the river.
Draco shook his head slightly and slid his arms around Harry's waist. He thought about all the new emotions he'd let himself feel this year by being Harry's coach, how he'd learned to find happiness outside of himself and his abilities. "No," he said softly, indulging in the feeling of getting to hold Harry close and just being himself. "What could be better than this?"
Draco scowled unhappily. Well there was that secret out of the bag then. “That’s none of your business, Potter.”
After a few weeks off, they headed to France for Harry's next event. It was nice to be going home after months away, finally getting a chance to see Pansy and Bruno again, and to stay in his own flat instead of at a hotel. Since most of his stuff had been packed up and shipped to England while he was training with Harry, his apartment was looking a little sparse.
"Karkaroff said he doesn't even know if he would take you back next season," his father informed him snidely, looking at Draco with the full weight of his stare. "What will you do then? Igor is the best there is. You've deeply offended him by your pretending to play coach."
"My apologies," Draco said with a smirk. "I had no idea what terrible etiquette I was displaying. Forgive me."
"Harry!" Mrs. Potter said, waving him over. "This is Draco. He's booked the Slytherin room for the time being."
Draco slipped his fingers into Harry's unkempt hair, enjoying the feel of it sliding through his long fingers, letting his nails just barely scratch against Harry's scalp. Harry gasped against Draco's mouth and pressed in closer.
"You – you – " Harry sputtered angrily, his face turning bright red. "You wanker!"
"Harry's room is the first door on the right," Mrs. Potter informed him. Draco gave her a nod of thanks and made his way upstairs. He stood outside of Harry's room and wrapped one knuckle against the door, leaning against the doorframe.
Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion until Harry leaned forward and kissed him. The flashes on the cameras went crazy to capture the moment. Draco slid his eyes shut and tried to block out everything that wasn’t Harry. Harry pulled back and laughed softly before disapparating them both, their bodies twisting around each other, the rest of the world falling away until it was just the two of them.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes. “If you think that owl would get  anywhere without being intercepted you’re a fool.”
“Come on, you said you wanted to wake up early so we could get some flying in before breakfast, remember?”
“Still moping I see,” Blaise said, sitting down next to Harry. “Honestly Draco, if I’d known you were going to behave this way I wouldn’t have snogged you last night. I know I’m not the Great Harry Potter but it can’t have been
Determined to get through to Harry, Draco shouldered his way into the room.
"If anything I would have thought Draco was a pain in yours. Unless he's decided to switch up his bedroom habits."
"Why are you telling me all this?"
Draco dropped gracefully to his knees and undid Harry's flies while he grinned up at his lover. He fished Harry's cock out and stroked it a few times to bring it to full hardness. Holding it by the base, he licked slowly from root to tip. "D-Draco," Harry whimpered, canting his hips forward towards Draco's mouth. He reached out and slid his fingers through Draco's silver-blond hair. "It feels almost unreal, having you like this."
“Fine,” Harry said with a shrug. “You go on looking for another explanation and I’ll just wait for tomorrow when we switch back.” Harry turned to leave and started back inside.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open and was relieved to find himself staring at the face of Harry Potter. He reached out and brushed Harry’s fringe off his forehead, getting a good look at his scar for what felt like the first time. He hadn’t really paid much attention to it when he’d been in Harry’s body. He traced it with his fingertip and Harry smiled with his eyes still closed.
"Don't apologize," Pansy said, shooting Draco a smirk. "That was hilarious."
Harry laughed, the sound of it rich and genuine, and something like pride swelled in Draco’s chest that he’d been the cause of it. “I’d say my chances are pretty good.”
Draco nodded. “I could barely sleep last night after Blaise left my bed.”
“Merlin’s beard, I can’t see!” he said in a panic, reaching his arms out in alarm, looking for something familiar. Everything looked so sodding
“Draco, I…” Harry pushed his glasses up to his forehead and rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes hard. He wiped away the tears quickly as if he was embarrassed to let Draco see them. “Fuck.”
“Well you’re not breaking your dry spell tonight, Potter,” Draco shot back, deftly undoing Harry’s belt and then undoing the top button of his jeans. Harry’s hand shot out and wrapped around Draco’s wrist.
Harry exhaled loudly in exasperation. "You must know what I mean. You kissed me for the whole world to see and since then you haven't done so much as hold my hand. I'm not going to lie – I expected a little more than that – especially now that you've got me alone in your flat."
So far so good, Draco thought.
When he opened his eyes everything was the same. Baise was looking at himself in a handheld mirror and Harry reached out to grab it. “Oi!” Blaise said indignantly.
“I’m a bit funny,” Harry said, bringing his mug to his lips and draining the contents. “I’m pretty sure you just don’t have a sense of humor.”
Harry brushed past Draco, which left Draco to catch up to him. He grabbed Harry by the arm when they reached the bottom of the stairs. "If you want me to leave, just say so."
Harry disappeared from the room and Draco listened as his footsteps went down the hall towards the guest bedroom. Draco performed a quick cleaning spell on himself and then got out of bed. He went through his wardrobe for something appropriate to wear. He assumed it was some Muggle place that Potter was taking him to and he figured he should dress accordingly.
"I…" Harry glanced up at Draco and smiled warmly at him. "No, no I don't mind."
"Are you having fun playing coach then, Draco?" Karkaroff asked, coming to stand next to Draco.
Harry was skating hard and fast, hurrying to get to Draco. "Draco! Did you see me? I did great, right?"
"Well, that's up to me."
Draco exhaled loudly and went into the kitchen. He waved his hand at the kettle and it began to heat. One cup of tea and then he was throwing Potter on his arse. It was more than the bastard deserved anyway. It wasn’t like every bloody wizard family in Britain wouldn’t line up to give Harry sodding Potter a cup of tea.
“Well apparently I can’t help myself,” Harry snarled back, grabbing his plate and biting a piece of bacon roughly. “Because I had to go and fancy you of all people instead of someone suitable and less obnoxious.”
So Draco started screaming.
Draco snarled, twisting in his bed and shoving his face more fully into the pillow. Whoever was trying to wake him was going to get covered in boils for the rest of the day. All the Slytherins knew better than to wake him before he was ready. Draco preferred to wake up in his own time. He had a very rigorous internal clock and woke up just precisely when he meant to. Waking him up early would ruin everything.
As far as cocks went it seemed Potter’s was fairly ordinary. Draco was pretty sure his own cock was longer than Potter’s – which he took a moment to feel smug about – but Harry’s was undeniably thicker. The foreskin was already retracting a bit to reveal the head. Draco wrapped his lips around it and gave it an experimental suck. Harry gasped above him and Draco had to keep from smiling.
“Floo Network then?”
“I can’t have been what you were expecting.”
Draco worked his jaw for a moment as he tried to think. There had to be something they could do about this. Maybe if they went and saw Madame Pomfrey she could help them. She wouldn’t be very keen to help Draco but with Harry involved she could hardly say no.
"Draco –"
Pansy giggled and pushed the pastry box towards Harry. "Help yourself."
Draco dropped his head back onto the bench and stared up at the cloudy London sky. "I had just come off a triple win at the Grand Prix, the Nationals and the Worlds. It was time to start a new season and I was just…so bored. It felt like no matter what I did, I was guaranteed a spot on the podium. No surprises, no surpassing myself, and no real competitors. Then the season started and I kept hearing your name, Harry Potter, the skating world's new golden boy. Might even be able to give Draco Malfoy a run for his money." Draco leaned forward with his forearms on his thighs, his head bowed and his hair falling into his eyes. "Then you had your accident and I was so angry with you. I was hoping you might make things interesting again."
Draco tried and failed to not take offense at that. “It’s a good thing you came here then instead of the manor,” Draco said dryly, crossing his arms over his chest. “I doubt my mother would have been quite as welcoming.”
"The papers -"
"I've tried!" Draco said indignantly, turning back around and pinning Harry with his gaze. "This past month I've done nothing but try to get to know you. You won't let me in. Harry, please! The way you skate is magnificent, but your skating is you. Can't you see that? No one else can skate the way you can."
"You know you will never be a proper coach to him, don't you?" Karkaroff said, putting a hand on Draco's shoulder. "You're much too selfish. You'll only end up ruining him."
“Don’t say it,” Draco snapped at him, his whole body tensing up just thinking about it. “Don’t be ridiculous. We couldn’t possibly be…”
"It doesn't always have to be about love," Draco said, gently pushing Bruno away as he put his paws up on Draco’s legs and tried to steal some food. "No begging."
Potter?”
"Harry!" Draco called after him, but Harry didn't turn around.
"Gladly," Draco said, narrowing his eyes at his father. He wasn't even sure why he had come in the first place. He had known this would be nothing but disastrous from the beginning. Every time he’d tried to give his father the benefit of the doubt he’d just ended up regretting it. He turned to go and stopped to look at his mother. "I'm sorry."
"Yes, Harry," Draco said, kissing his other cheek. "There's one more thing I want to tell you."
“Have you lost your mind?” Harry asked, struggling against the ropes binding his arms and legs. He could only hope this wasn’t what Draco and Zabini normally did when they were “having fun.”
"Draco!" Harry called out, rushing over to him. "What happened to you? You're soaking wet!"
"I do!"
"Hush," Pansy said, flipping her hair expertly, a move she had perfected when she was twelve. "While you're away, Bruno is basically my dog and that means I get to give him whatever I want."
"Draco," Harry sighed out happily as he wrapped his legs around Draco's waist.
Sliding an arm around Harry, Draco kept him close as they walked together to the bedroom, kissing the entire way there. Once inside, Draco began unbuttoning Harry's shirt, licking at Harry's pulse point and feeling it jump under his tongue. Harry groaned and dropped his head back, letting Draco slide his shirt off his shoulders, as he bit playfully at Harry's collarbone.
Harry rolled his eyes and stepped into the room. Draco watched in horror as Potter came over and crawled onto the bed, sitting at the end of it and looking at Draco. “There’s twice as many reporters as there were this morning,” Harry informed him.
"Draco, everyone can see us," Harry said, hiding his face in Draco's neck.
He found sucking Potter off to be much more pleasurable than Blaise. Perhaps it was the actual interest in getting Potter off that added to the sensations, listening to each exhale and curse word that slipped from Harry’s mouth as Draco took him deep into his mouth. It spurred on Draco’s own arousal and Draco found himself fisting his cock with need.
“I really don’t know,” Harry said, shaking his head. “You drive me round the twist. You’ve got backwards views on just about everything. You’re unpleasant and argumentative.” Harry stopped for a moment and his lips twitched into a small smile. “I think there’s a part of me that just can’t let things be easy. Things with Ginny were easy and I was always waiting for something to go wrong. We could have gotten married, had a couple of kids, been one big happy family. But I don’t trust it when I’m happy. ”
Harry snorted. “Try again,” he teased, his tongue doing the same to the tip of Draco’s cock, lapping teasingly at his foreskin.
Harry rubbed his wrists where they had been bound tight. “He can’t be any angrier with you than he is at me.”
