“I’m fine,” was the muffled reply.  “I’m fine, I swear, I’m sorry.”  He shook once more and gasped, half-laugh, half-sob, “I didn’t sleep well.”
.::  Harry frowned slightly as he added them.  He was reaching for the paddle when a hand grasped his.
“There’s nothing wrong with Mr. Potter’s mentality nor has there ever been,” Dumbledore said calmly. “His…affliction…is not his fault.” He paused and cast a serious look towards the two vampires. “You looked naturally grim on hearing the name Dazain but unsurprised. Perhaps we should go to my office to discuss these matters further.”
Blue eyes darkened further and Remus stepped in front of his friend, meeting the vampire’s ice-cold stare with one he knew was more aggressive than he was used to letting show.
’ he growled as he slowly lifted a leg out of bed and, with no small amount of trepidation, tested his strength. Satisfied that he would not topple over or collapse like an invalid, he slowly got out of bed. Everything appeared blurry and he squinted, momentarily wondering why before banishing the thought and continuing to observe the room. ‘
“They seemed okay with you,” Black said absently, turning a page and staring down at it.  He looked back up at her, his gaze sharp.  “You would let us know if there’s anything wrong, right?  I mean, if there’s anything I – we can do.”
“It’s a werewolf,” the vampire in front of them hissed and bared his teeth at Remus.  Remus tightened his hold on his wand and silently fought for control from the voice that told him to throw it aside and lunge at the menace in front of him.
Harry looked at his friend from the corner of his eye.  His lips twitched slightly but he kept his solemn expression.  He ate another spoonful of vegetables before answering.  “I just think you should know,” he said quietly, “that I know where you sleep at night and I tend to go to sleep after you.”  He ate another spoonful of vegetables calmly while Seamus leaned away from him and towards Dean.
As he looked softly down into those long-missed eyes, he bitterly remembered his promise to himself before he had come here.
A broken laugh left his lips and he felt himself crumpling to the floor, unresisted by Qye still carefully holding onto his hand.
“I see all of you have your books ready to go,” she said pleasantly, scanning the room to make sure each student had one.  “That’s all very good because we will be using them constantly in the school year. Today, however, we will not be using them so will you all please put them away?”   Murmurs arose at this but each student put their textbooks away with the sounds of papers crackling and bags being closed and opened.
Ron let out a dramatic sigh and draped a friendly arm across the shorter boy’s shoulders, pretending to wipe a tear from his eye.  “Our little Harry is growing up, 'Mione,” Ron said in a mock-proud voice.  The black-haired boy glared at his taller friend, shaking off the lanky arm.
“You fell out of bed,” Dean repeated slowly, still staring at the green-eyed boy, disbelief clear in his eyes.
“You couldn’t figure out how to merge us anyway, could you?” he said abruptly, glancing up at Smethwyck, raising his eyebrows.
As he was swept up in the cheerful welcome of the house-elves, in the joyful hug of Dobby, he thought he heard Qye whisper, ::
"Of course," she rolled her eyes, turning her back on him. "You had that coming." She paused and shook her head. "Though I would've never suspected it would be from Harry," she said ruefully, packing the last of her things in her bag. "Who would've guessed he'd be your worst kind of opponent, huh? A perfect long-range fighter." She grabbed her bag and turned around with an amused expression on her face. "I bet none of them could've guess you're a close-range fighter. I hinted to them that you weren't the greatest with telekinesis or shielding but I guess none of them got that."
“Argue against me all you want, it’s a dead-end conversation I’m no longer interested in indulging you in,” Lest growled.  “My only interest is his well-being and at least I can be honest about that.”
“I never knew this,” Harry said, looking at Remus as if he had never seen him before.  “You never said anything when teaching me.”
Jonas blew out a breath and rubbed at his face roughly, his collected mask breaking for a moment before it firmed up and he dropped his hands again, looking at them all.
He finally gave up as Harry just wrapped himself in his blankets even more.  Throwing his hands up in the air, he shouted, “Fine!  I give up!”
Unfortunately, his reading of Qye's Journal had been cut short.  The beginning of December had brought with it an onslaught of work.  So instead of spending his late nights in bed reading about this mysterious 'Qye', he spent it in the common room with his friends, studying and working.  It slightly frustrated him and he couldn't wait for vacation to begin so he could have some time to read more about the mystifying 'Qye.'
Ron and Harry exchanged confused looks as the turned the corner and saw the small sea of students excitedly huddled together.
The redhead drummed his fingers next to his cup, pointedly not looking at the Slytherin occupying the same table as him.  The music’s tempo was picking up and he watched the dance crowd move faster and grow louder.
Madam Pomfrey turned off the spell and looked wide eyed at the uncertain vampire while Marylin’s heartbeat slowed from its panic.  Then she sighed and turned to look at the sharp gazes of the wizards.
And Draco...while the others refused to meet Professor Opacre's eyes, it looked like it was Professor Opacre trying to avoid the challenging look on the Slytherin's face.
“Do not assume a vampire cannot be dangerous without its fangs,” Verna murmured, examining her knitting.  Jordan saw his cousin’s cold blue eyes narrow.
“Mr. Potter?” he repeated again softly, taking a step in front of the chair and stilling as a pair of dark green eyes abruptly lifted away from the sleeping young man and pinned him in place.
“I think we’re just concerned in general,” Remus responded cautiously as Sirius tried to take in as much detail as possible, his eyes trailing over the way the pajamas hung loosely on them, the pinched corners at Qye’s mouth and shadowed bags under Harry’s eyes.  “You have to know we care.”
She stormed over to him and grabbed him by his shirt, dragging him up in front of her as tears blurred her vision. “You were the one who blocked his memories, you were the one who made this decision!  He wouldn’t be this way if you hadn’t, if you had just listened to me when I told you not to!”
“Oh, you can’t trust Ron with these things, he generally always turns out wrong,” Hermione said cheerfully, still pulling at Marylin’s arm. “He’s so stubborn about every thing, he doesn’t take into consideration that Harry might have moved.”
Harry blew out a breath and reached under his glasses to rub his eyes.  “Fine.”  He dropped his hands and looked at them, warily.  “So…it’s okay?  Qye and I?”
The green-eyed teenager jumped, inwardly gagged as the world did a wobbly little jig, and turned to the irate blond beside him.
He knew she was trying to help, really he did.  But he just didn’t want to talk.  He didn’t think that there were even
an apology for throwing that acorn at me,” the vampire growled slightly, his dark blue eyes glowering slightly down at him. “That blasted thing hurt.”
Ron glanced sharply at Malfoy and the irritation faded away when he saw look in the gray eyes. He'd seen that look before.
“Sorry,” she said, smiling ruefully.  “It’s a habit of mine to touch people, especially young ones.  I suppose you can say I’m the kind of girl who coos over babies and young children and like to hug them.”
it's safe," she said, pointedly not looking at the suspicious Slytherins. "It's just in case things get rough, which they will not as my brother will keep strictly to the limits I've set." At this she turned to her brother. “Right?"
“It’s a long story,” Marylin sighed.  “Quite complicated too.  But none of your worry!” she said cheerfully, waving her hand as if to cast away the topic.  “You can still enjoy the dance!”  She paused as the girls glanced at each other, looking around the room again as a thought came to mind.  “Although…”
“And consider other options,” George finished.  They both smirked over her.  “I’m sure we could find you a profitable career on the sales floor.”
The beast staggered away, choking, its howl becoming gurgled as blood spurt violently from its mouth.  Harry’s eyes were wide as he clutched his arm, gripping the puncture.  The beast fell to the floor, its arms clawing mindlessly as its legs scrambled away from him.
“I’m sure the Minister is getting right on that,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.  He grinned as Hermione dug her elbow into Ron’s side, making him let out a soft ‘
“Nice comparison, Ron,” Harry muttered. He jumped when a cool hand pressed against his forehead. He glanced up to see Hermione looking worriedly down at him.
He flinched when Weasley clapped him on the shoulder, still a sympathetic look in his blue eyes. “Seems like your freedom is going fast, huh?”
The amusement faded from the gray eyes, replaced with the coolness that they had adopted since the beginning of the school year.  Malfoy dropped his wrist and Harry repressed a shiver from the sudden cold.  He barely stopped himself from reaching out and grabbing hold of the warm hand once again, firmly reminding himself who the owner of the source of heat was.
He turned his head and narrowed his eyes at a bored-looking first year holding out a letter to him.  The wide-eyed wonder and hesitance quickly disappeared by the end of year and most of the deference to the older years was washed away by the cutthroat competitiveness.
“I think that’s enough, Severus,” Remus sharply said, blocking Sirius from taking another step towards Snape as his fists tightened.  Sirius scoffed but didn’t make any further attempts.  “We’re naturally exhausted from our trip and we want to know what is going on.  The Headmaster specifically had us remain far from Hogwarts and undercover and now he summons us here without any explanation - ”
“But, I remember everything else,” Harry said, head pounding with confusion and the remnants of the sickness. “I remember getting sick four days ago and collapsing in the Great Hall after…” Here he shivered as he faintly recalled the vision and the split in his head. “After my fit,” he finished. “I remember everything that happened up to that point and I remember waking up yesterday with the fever. And you said I was out the entire day the day before that. So that day before that is the only thing I can’t really remember.”
Qye opened his eyes and narrowed them. The name was ringing a strong warning bell in his mind but he didn’t know why. It had something to do with the Opacres though. He frowned.
“I wanted to ask you a question, Qye,” he said slowly, looking back and forth between them in growing confusion.  The heavy pit in his stomach grew with the awful question frozen behind his lips.  “I just - ”
“I…I just didn’t feel like asking anything, Professor,” he muttered.  Then he smiled suddenly and glanced back at his friends, amusement in his eyes.  “Besides, Hermione here seemed to be doing a fine job of asking all the questions in the world.”
Instead, Hermione closed her book and stood up, picking it up.  “We’d better get going to breakfast before the rest of them wake up,” she said, tucking in her chair as Harry stared at her.  “Or would you rather they all finally get a chance to grill you like they didn’t last night?”
was right there.  The Libidates surged up and he fought it off, his dark eyes staring down at the boy – no, he wasn’t the small boy he had left behind – the
, snarling as it fought against Lest’s harsh strikes at its mind.  It streaked forward, teeth bared in its noseless face and hands reaching.
Lest whirled, his leg coming up and knocking into the blond’s leg, making him fall to one knee.  Draco shouted something and a shimmer of light appeared just in time to block Lest’s elbow before it crashed into his face.  The vampire flicked a hand.
“What happened?” he asked.  Even to his own ears, his voice sounded odd.  He dully wondered if he should be feeling anything but this strange numbness.
“All right,” she said, putting down her quill and leaning forward on her podium while her eyes looked calmly around the class.  “I think I should I make some things clear first because it’s quite obvious to me that most of you do not like the fact that I am your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”  Some students shifted uncomfortably and she smiled slightly.  “It’s quite alright,” she laughed softly.  “If I were in your position, I most likely would not have come to class.”  At this, some students looked rather guilty.  She grinned a bit.
Hermione scowled briefly.  “He took off for breakfast the moment I started asking him about what deal he made.”
’ That Malfoy had been a cruel, sarcastic little brat who delighted in tormenting him and his friends.  This Malfoy, though he still made jokes at him and kept his sarcastic remarks, was more…civil.  His insults were at a bare minimum and he had stopped hounding him and his friends.  Whenever they passed each other by, he said nothing unless Ron or someone said something first.  And even those insults were quick, just enough to be a comeback before he strode away from them.  Harry didn’t even think they had a classic Potter-Malfoy fight since coming back to school.
“Physically?” She glanced at Jonas, who waved a hand at her, leaving it to her.  “They are progressing from the separation and their prognosis remains positive.  Magically, Qye continues to display no signs of it.  We believe Harry’s exhaustion to be temporary, a likely side-effect of the separation process that will most likely fade away as his magic stabilizes.  Mentally, they can each reason rationally and engage in critical thinking as necessary.”  She paused, her finger tracing the edge of her copy.  “Emotionally and socially, they require a lot of support moving forward.”
“Really? I suppose I better change my breakfast meal then, cereal and toast seem to only hold the secrets of the galaxy.”
“Step away, Smethwyck,” he heard Nilsson command inside the room as he shook away the oddness and entered, his heart pounding in his chest and reverberating in his ears, staring into the room that held his heart, barely hearing the footsteps of the others hurrying towards him.
The sounds and screams and cries and fear mixed together, filling his head with the noise and terror and pain and it hurt so much, tearing him further. He couldn’t understand any of them, one scream broken by another, a never-ending shriek of pain echoing throughout him.
“You were spacing out,” Malfoy smirked.  “What were you doing, talking to the voices in your head?”  His smirk widened.  “Or were you daydreaming about me again?”
"Ah," Professor Opacre said, a surprised but pleased look appearing on her face. She shook her head and beamed at Hermione, who was already stepping forward with her wand. "That's wonderful, thank you, Hermione!"
In the end, through a midnight wandering use of the Marauder’s Map, he found a secret alcove near the Boathouse that was hidden by a portrait. There was enough of an air current from the nearby lake that it took the fumes from the potion and smoke from the fire through the edges of the portrait.  He had tentatively set up his stone cauldron –
He felt Qye behind his eyes and in the pit of his stomach that uneasy feeling he’d been ignoring started to grow heavier as he suddenly remembered the potion that started it all.
“I will send the letter to the Minister now,” Dumbledore said as Harry carefully turned around with Qye’s help, their backs to the adults.  “I would suggest everyone else retire to their rooms until Healer Smethwyck provides us any further updates.”  His tone clearly said it wasn’t so much a suggestion as an order and Qye could hear faint shuffles as a door opened behind them.
A tension he didn’t know he carried slid from his shoulders as he sagged in his chair, shakily putting his cup on the table and raising that same hand to rub his eyes.  “I was in a rush.  And to be fair, I sent that letter on the first day.  I didn’t know them well enough then.”
"This is my Gemmae, a tiger eye," Professor Opacre said, twisting her wrist to move the brown and gold stone around. "A jewel given to a female vampire is called a Gemmae while a jewel given to a male vampire is called a Gemmus." She gestured to her brother, who looked a little disgruntled. He reached to his neck, beneath his shirt. He paused for a moment and then, lips tightening, he pulled out a necklace and quickly flipped around what looked like a pendant. In the middle lay a stone in the shape of a teardrop that looked...was that...
“Now I think we are,” Malfoy said, looking Harry over and making Ron grimace.  “Unless you’ve always had a sense of fashion and just willingly chosen not to use it until now - ”
’ he thought fuzzily in the darkness. Voices distant and familiar floated in the scorching obscurity.
He saw vampires dodging and punching, swirling around swiftly, one with a sword that blocked strikes and a woman sliding between groups and leaving bodies crumpled on the floor.
She had given him a suspicious one, pursed her lips, and capitulated in frustration as Harry tiredly wrapped an arm around his shoulders and muttered just loud enough for her to hear, “He’s not going to give up, let’s just get this over with.”
“I think we can all agree with that,” Marylin said and they all turned to look at her, where she stood next to her brother.  She smoothed her dress and looked at the Healer awkwardly standing next to Dumbledore, clearly out of his league yet trying to stay professional.  “I think Healer Smethwyck can attest how we have all been cooperating to treat Harry - ”
Sighing, she stood up from her chair.  Grabbing her cloak, she wrapped it around herself before leaving her office, a slightly grimace on her face as she headed toward Headmaster Dumbledore’s office.  She had some news to tell him.
“Have faith, gentlemen,” he said softly and the two friends turned to him, uncertain and overwhelmed.  Albus gazed at them with his steady blue eyes before turning his gaze to Fawkes, crooning at them and meeting his eyes.  “We know not what life throws at it but we must have faith we can manage.”
The teenager sighed, dropping the subject and bright yellow petals, shuddering as the aroma hit him. He stomach fluttered uneasily and he coughed again.
“Doing great here, Frater,” Remus heard Marylin mutter in the tense silence of the room and he saw her cheeks reddened while he slowly pocketed his wand.  “We don’t mean any disrespect,” she said awkwardly, shifting behind her brother.
“Tomorrow,” Smethwyck repeated, long-sufferingly, and Qye grumbled as he was pulled into the hallway with a frowning Harry, while Wainscott answered questions about her security measures.  The door closed, Qye looking away but not quick enough to avoid seeing the way Lest stood silent, alone in a corner, not once looking towards them.
“There’s been no change in our data,” Jonas offered as the woman pressed her fingers into the wrist of one of the bodies.  “I mean, it’s much less than the previous fluctuations we were getting, which is always good but still not what we’re expecting from a developing wizard.”
“The feeling’s mutual, Opacre,” Malfoy said through gritted teeth, placing himself in between the vampire and the table, his gray eyes flashing furiously.  “What’s wrong, vampire?  Couldn't find any young and helpless infants near your house anymore that you have to start picking off teenagers?”  Sparks flew as their eyes met and the temperature of the classroom seemed to drop drastically in a few moments.
Ron scrambled himself up to his feet in time to see a weary but still fighting Professor Sprout move forward to swarm the vampires with a spell of pollen that had them hissing.  She was one of the few remaining adults still conscious, the rest spread thinly around the group at each corridor.
Marylin sighed again and opened her eyes, looking down at the letter.  Her suspicion of Harry being Qye was flawed now.  She had heard, at the end of October, of the death of his relatives.  And when Lest had told her he had gone to see them and had gotten angry with them…it seemed to almost prove that Harry was indeed her little Qye.
He arched an eyebrow at Ron and Hermione. “Hello. You two look an awful like my two best friends who have apparently deserted me to deal with the horrors of the Infirmary all by ill self.”
"Last time I checked, you're not under my rule so you don't have to ask my permission, you know," Draco commented dryly. He glanced over at his own Housemates, some who were already eyeing the two of them in askance. "I should probably go back to my own before they start plotting mutiny again." Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to the rest of his House.
Lest whirled around and Qye smiled inside as he looked at the irritated expression on the vampire’s face.
She could see the white knuckled grasp on his Gemmus as he hissed, voice dark and terrible, “Let him go.”
“If you added a section, it sounds like you’ve already made a decision,” Qye said contemptuously, unable to bite back his scorn.
He sipped at the tea, peering into it every so often as she read while her tea slowly cooled.  After a while, he pulled out his wand and cast a warming charm on her cup as he took another sip while she turned another page to the detailed graphs on the physiological changes from the beginning, with Nilsson’s notes scribbled in.  He was considering refilling his cup when she put down the file, carefully closing it on the table, and picked up her tea.
He stared up at the mahogany ceiling, whirling and scratching sounds faintly sounding while his body lay heavy in a warm bed.
“Welcome back, gentleman,” the Headmaster said somberly from where he sat in an armchair in the spacious room.  Another long couch lay opposite to his chair and the one where the male vampire sat, a small table between them with some papers carefully arranged.  Remus could see a doorway behind Dumbledore’s chair leading to another hallway.  “I wish this was under better circumstances.
“Do you see me disagreeing with you?” the redheaded boy muttered, chewing on a piece of a toffee. “In case you’ve forgotten, I’ve gotten into a couple of fights these couple of days defending him - ”
Marylin rolled her eyes. They walked in silence, Lest looking at the paintings with a diffident look and Marylin looking down at the ground. Biting her lip, she glanced at her younger brother.
“I better go,” the vampire said cheerfully.  “Have to start preparing for my brother’s arrival.”  She winked at them.  “Have fun ‘studying’ you two.”  Harry blushed slightly as the vampire left from sight.
Harry winced as a flash of annoyance went through the woman’s eyes.  Professor Opacre straightened up and turned to glare back at the Potions Master.
“Tomorrow,” Jonas said loudly and Qye watched him throw a pointed look at Wainscott, to which she clicked her tongue and stood up.
“You’re angry with me,” Malfoy said softly, turning back to his own potion and sprinkling in the eryle root.
Harry glared at the girl. “I’m - ” he began before a sudden cough came up. Coughing violently, he hunched over, using his sleeve to cover his mouth. He continued like this for a few more moments before finally managing to subdue them. Looking up, he was met with three pairs of concerned eyes.
“Thank you,” she said cordially.  “We’ll await you in the sitting room.  I will inform the Headmaster to lower the wards and tell the guard to let you pass.”  She walked away as Sirius slowly closed the door behind her.
“Twitchy, aren’t you, Potter?” Malfoy said lazily, smirking as he rested his chin on one of his hands, his elbow on the table.  Harry glared at him, trying to control his rapid breathing.
Harry started as Draco reached for one of his arms.  He started slightly as the blond slowly began to rub his hand up and down it, gently heating it.
“Harry, are you alright?  Should we get Madame Pomfrey?  Ron, go call McGonagall, I think there’s something wrong with Harry,” Hermione ordered quickly, looking at Harry worriedly.  Ron nodded uncertainly, beginning to stand up but Harry shook his head quickly, dropping his hands from his face.
Marylin sighed and leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes and rubbing her temples.  The Ravenclaw seventh years’ essays were spread out around her desk and she still had about half left to go.  But she had to take a break or she would go
blood call to his own, softly reaching out to him.  He could smell the warm, metallic scent through the sweat of the hot students and putrid airs of the potions.  He could’ve smelled it anywhere, the strong, alluring scent so strong that it made his mouth water though he had it only once.
“Almost,” came a voice from near the window.  Jordan jumped and turned in his chair to look at the window, blinking.  His cousin stood there, staring out of the window, watching the rain cascade down.  He hadn’t even seen him move.
Hermione gave her own small smile back.  “Oh, I don’t know about that.  This seems pretty typical for a teenager.  Confused hormones and all.”  She bumped his shoulder with hers and laughed softly when he groaned and hung his head.
The few days after, Harry did notice the sneers and the glares from the Slytherins while the other Houses congratulated him and the Weasleys for their duels against Lest.  Then, without any explanation, something changed.  Harry had bumped into Zabini outside the Charms classroom and though there were several Slytherins around and the dark-skinned boy looked vaguely annoyed, nothing happened.
“It’s okay,” Alicia said, giving a half-hearted smile.  “I mean, I wasn’t trying for anything serious, I just figured…”
Qye said nothing. Harry closed his eyes and reached out to find Qye reaching for him as well. He felt Qye’s fear, insecurity, frustration and shared his own.
“Are you trying to decide who we are?” Harry broke in softly and Lest’s eyes shifted to him.  “You want to play with our memories again?  Maybe if you change our minds one more time, you’ll finally get what you want.”
"I was slightly surprised by you hitting me," Lest said stiffly after a moment, pushing himself off the floor and onto his feet, blue eyes glinting dangerously at him. "It wasn't like it was that bad - "
“Come on then,” McGonagall said, exchanging a look with Dumbledore. “I’ll escort you both up there.”
“Wait,” the black-haired man whispered and he saw Harry shift his head, green eyes glancing at him before looking away.  “Wait, I - ”
"You don't really think I'm right, right, Harry?" Seamus asked frantically. Neville was an ill shade of green and Dean gave an imploring look to Harry, clearly having given up trying to calm his best friend.
“That good a dream, was it, Harry?” Seamus said knowingly, his blue eyes dancing gleefully.  Harry stared in confusion at the other boy and Seamus laughed again, getting out of bed.
“Seamus!” Hermione barked, breaking off from her summary and glaring at the Irish boy. “That’s cheating!”
Dazain did not move, continued to observe Harry as the teenager’s eyes flickered towards Lest, Marylin catching sight of something quick across his face before Harry gritted his teeth and looked away.
,’ he thought sourly, rubbing his head.   He placed a hand against the wall of the cupboard, deciding to use it to help him stand up.
“LEAVE HER ALONE!” Vernon snarled although his terror had increased slightly.  This man…he was one of
She hesitated before she finally bit her lip and reluctantly nodded.  “Alright.  Just this once,” she warned, giving him a narrowed look.
“Why are you here?” Lest snarled, forgetting his Videte and concentrating his strength, planning to finally eliminate the bastard.  He barely noticed the other Dazains scattered around, keeping their distance while the wizards behind Lest held their wands at the ready.
“Next time, I’ll listen, okay?” He replied dryly, raising himself up and rearranging the pillows to rest against them. “That’s still no excuse to abandon me like that.” He gave them his best kicked-puppy dog look.
With the sun barely giving off its light, the room was still dimmed with the morning darkness. Nevertheless, Qye winced and closed his eyes for a moment before reopening them determinedly. Having spent a long time watching through another’s eyes, it felt awkward to look through his own. He lifted his head slowly, partially because he was wary and partially because after spending months without having to deal with a body or weight, he felt heavy.
“Hermione, I really don’t think we’re going to get better service here than at the table,” sighed Harry as he was once again pressed against the bar by another patron.  He shifted uncomfortably, making sure his back was still against the wooden bar.  Already there had been too many instances of someone’s hand accidentally touching him places that made him long for thick robes, no matter the warmth of the room.
Sirius paused in the doorway, staring at the two young men sitting on the smaller sofa, looking everywhere but at them as Dumbledore calmly made his way to an armchair, pulling the tea set on the table to him as easily as if this were a casual gathering.
"Cowards," he heard Ron hiss behind him and his green eyes looked back and blinked when he noticed the redhead's glare at the rest.
“Still as pleasant as always, Dursley,” the figure interrupted softly in a silky voice.  “I hope for your sake that you’ve become more pleasant than before.”
Hermione continued, “ – I honestly didn’t want to leave you, it was bad enough you were going to be left alone but now we couldn’t even say good bye and - ”
Sirius moved his eyes back to Lest, sitting calm and untouched by the lethal intent in Sirius’ eyes.
“He stays here,” Lest interrupted, finally straightening from his slumped post near the window.  Marylin looked up at him from where she sat in the chair next to one of the beds, where she had performed the brief scan when requested by the nurse and found nothing.
Qye didn’t like people staring at him. At all. Forgetting that he was supposed to act like sweet, meek Harry, he snapped irritably, “What?”
The blow came again and he cried out again, shuddering and shivering and whimpering and hurting and gods it bloody
Lest finally turned his eyes away from the tree and shrugged slightly. Casually placing his hands in his pockets, he turned away from the tree and began to walk away.
The curtains of the other fifth-year Gryffindor's beds flew open – minus a snoring Ron’s – and Dean, Seamus, and Neville stared at the groaning Boy-Who-Lived, who was wincing as he rubbed his head.
!” he cried out, pointing at the bemused Slytherin, who was surrounded by his scowling and suspicious court.
His dark eyes flickered before hardening with resolve and Harry flinched as Lest raised a hand to him, fingers flexing.
“I’m sure he does,” she grinned.  He smiled at her, his spirits slightly heightened by her cheery air.  His smile faded and he glanced at the doorway again.
The cracks were in his mind, he realized.  His mind was fragmenting, splintering, breaking into a thousand little pieces. . .
Qye stared at her, heaving with anger, pangs in his chest as he remembered whispers of never getting Myn angry, never believing it with her bubbly smile and laughs.
"You can put your texts away anyway," she continued, walking to the front of her desk and leaning back at them, reducing her smile to something nicer. "We're doing a one-of-a-kind thing today and I really wanted to surprise you all. I've already cleared it with Dumbledore so no worries but since I want honest reactions, I ask you to please keep it secret from everyone else. I made sure that all of the other classes kept silent too so no one would have any added advantage." Here she paused. "Not that anyone asked anyone else."
Pale, shocked Gryffindor faces met his, disbelief clear in their wide eyes.  Seamus eyes were filled with hurt and looked away from his own when Harry turned to look at him.  Dean glared at the black-haired boy as he placed a comforting hand on the sandy-haired boy’s shoulder.  Harry turned to Ron and Hermione and found them staring at him as if they had never seen him before.  Realization of what he had just done hit him and he felt himself pale.
Fudge was a moron.  Simple and clear.  The foolish Minister continued to act as if everything was perfectly under control even though it wasn’t, reassuring the tense and worried magical community that there was nothing to be afraid about.  He had added a few more wards and guards, passed some curfew acts, and had given a bit more power to Dumbledore but other than that...nothing.  The idiot acted as if the threat of Voldemort was nothing!
He didn’t expect the stir that followed or the rousing of the consciousness, his mind once again filled with the feeling of the other boy residing in it.
“I’m here to evaluate the stability of your identity,” Wainscott interrupted, looking at him with clear eyes.  “If you can function in society with a sense of self safely and independently, as I would with any other patient of mine.”
:: Qye noted and Harry repressed a shiver as he felt the odd pressure behind his eyes, telling him Qye was looking through them.
Hermione gently grasped his chin and turned his tired face to hers, her voice gentle but firm as she said, “You’re a remarkable person for having gone through what you gone through.  You’re our friend who I have no doubt would do anything to make sure we were happy and well, just like we do with you.  There is nothing wrong with needing our help or letting us do something, anything to make this easier for you.  Whatever this is.”
"Um," Harry replied, flushing as Professor Opacre smiled curiously at him, a bright look in her eyes. She obviously expected him to step forward and volunteer to be the first duelist. A list of swears ran continuously through his mind as he stammered and tried to think a way out of this.
The vampire muttered something too low for Harry to hear, even as the class quieted down, curious about Ron's actions. Lest took a step forward, dropping his hand.
“Then why the hell are you asking me what’s going to happen tomorrow,” he muttered, dropping back on the bed and glaring at the canopy.  “It doesn’t matter what they’re going to say.  They can talk all they want.  We just have to make sure they don’t do anything against us.”
The teenager didn’t respond, merely watched him with disturbingly emotionless eyes, one arm curled around his middle while his chin rested on his other hand, his fingers covering his mouth.  Jonas noted that there was no scar on this one’s forehead.
Ron continued, eyes flashing. “Both me and Hermione, all year and don’t you bloody well deny it! Hermione’s been wanting to ask you to talk all year but I’ve stopped her saying, ‘Give him some time’ and ‘He’ll talk when he’s ready’ and all that supportive and ‘giving space’ kind of crap that I thought you wanted, that I thought would stop you from going away from us. And it hasn’t done any good, you’re still doing it! I thought if we waited you would eventually come around and talk with us and everything would be okay but you haven’t and I’m tired of waiting! I’m tired of you carrying it all around and I don’t even bloody well know anymore what it
The blush faded away slowly and the black-haired boy blinked up at the vampire.  Harry studied the vampire thoughtfully for a moment.  Feeling an encouraging nudge from Qye, he nodded tentatively, reassured.
For a moment, he just stared up at the canopy of his bed.  He was aware of the morning sunlight pouring in through the window next to his bed, aware of the snores of Ron and Neville, which showed that they were still sleeping.  He was aware that it most likely time to get up for his first day of classes, aware Hermione would come barging in if he didn’t.
“Of all the people, Draco…” Snape muttered and blond shrugged. Snape sighed and turned away, briskly walking out of the Infirmary. “Well, come on. It’s almost curfew and I have to go mutilate some brilliant pieces of work by some first-year Hufflepuffs.”
Marylin staggered again, falling into McGonagall, overwhelmed by the surge of power before it vanished.  She shakily pushed herself off the witch, barely noticing the stiffening in the older woman’s body as she looked up to see.
Harry hadn’t seen a better course of action and so, sighing with regret, he had closed the book on ingredients.  Unfortunately, he hadn’t had the slightest clue of where to start looking next.  Where did one find a book on transferring a voice out of one’s head?
Harry didn’t respond, instead lowering his gaze to the bracelet.  It had black leather straps, twisted into an intricate pattern and held together by gold hooks.  The leather felt soft and worn in between his fingers and he let out a slow breath as he let go of it.
Harry lifted his eyes and met Ron’s.  The redhead paused in his wand movements, seeing the exhausted and disconsolate look in his friend’s eyes.
Harry ignored the stab of guilt and took a deep breath as he put down his tart.  “After the O.W.L.s.”
In another part of the castle, Marylin closed the door to her classroom and turned around to face her brother, linking arms with him.
His words echoed in the quiet classroom and he saw Lest narrow his eyes, pale face slightly pink from where his fist had made contact.
Harry stared blankly at the empty bathroom, his cloak shimmering on the floor, the darkness lurking in the stalls and corners.  He heard the stubbornness in Qye’s voice hiding the fright and confusion and rage, felt that still shaken and trembling feeling thrumming in his body, shared that unshakable horror about finally knowing exactly what had been done to their life.
,’ the black-haired boy thought, turning away from the redhead and letting his irritation simmer inside. ‘
His cousin looked at her coolly.  She flushed but kept her gaze.  They continued like that for a few moments before he finally said in a slightly irritated voice, “I haven’t said anything yet.  I barely received the letter this morning and I wanted your advice for my response.”
“What the hell,” Lest whispered and Qye fixed him with eyes that he hoped exuded all the fury he still had inside.  Judging from his widening pained eyes, the vampire might have gotten a hint.
to describe how he was feeling.  Ever since June, he felt like there was no way for anyone to understand how he was feeling.  There were times he doubted that even he himself understood how he felt.  Ever since Cedric died, he felt as if a part of him had been ripped to shreds and now all he could do was stare at the pieces and try to fit them back together as they had been before only there was no way it could be the same as before.
The blonde-haired woman waited until she was sure the two out of earshot before rounding on the Headmaster.
“Everyone’s enjoying themselves,” Harry said flatly, ignoring the flare of disappointment in his stomach.  “I’m not letting you two ruin tonight for them.”  He twitched his wand to the path leading back to the main street and watched as Draco stalked past him without another word.  He gave a final glance at Lest, who stood there silently.  As he turned away, he saw Lest’s hand at his side flex slightly.
"Oh, really," she huffed. "You're just as bad as the other classes, I was expecting better. I had to start telling people not to warn others in case people decided to ditch." She shook her head. "I don't see what the fuss is all about - "
He stood in Professor Opacre’s office as the vampire woman cheerfully bustled through what seemed to be an endless row of trunks filled with clothes.  He had dodged Ron and Hermione – who he could neither confirm nor deny finally broke down and asked each other out or were simply, again, going as friends – with a feeble excuse of finishing up something for DADA and that he would meet them there.
Barely a few feet away, he paused and turned his head, smirking.  “By the way, I think Granger is available, if Weasley wants to ask.”
“The hell he is,” Sirius said heatedly and Qye faltered, biting the inside of his cheek as he side-eyed the man as he glared at Lest.  “If you think for one goddamn minute I’m letting you have any say in - ”
Hermione gave him a worried look.  “Harry, you can’t just run from it and let it stop you from eating - ”
:: the voice replied simply.  Harry growled slightly and he heard the voice chuckle quietly in his head.
“It’s not your fault,” the elderly man said quietly.  Harry frowned, raising a hand to rub his stinging eyes.  He removed his glasses, rubbing them harder.  Everything was getting blurry…he needed new glasses.
The vampire said nothing. Harry followed the trail of his eyes and found himself staring at Draco Malfoy. He couldn't see the Slytherin's face but it most likely matched Lest's emotionless expression.
“Do you have memories of your mother, Qye?” Wainscott asked curiously.  “Madam Pomfrey communicated that Harry had visions of her from when the dementors were on the grounds a few years ago.”
"As a result of the chaos, some humans became violent and wanted the stones for themselves, enchanted by the beauty and tugged by their own blood. Others ran away into the light of Selene and kept to the sunlight, where stones could not follow as they came by Helene's darkness. That is our origin."
Saira stood up as soon as Krista sat down and said in a crisp voice, her blue-violet eyes flashing with disgust and annoyance at the girl next to her, “Saira Latvian.  Representative of the Latvian family of vampires from Europe, who are second-in-command to the Head family of the European vampires.  Wife of Sebastian Latvian - ” – Jordan saw a flash of pain in her violet eyes – “ – who was my partner as Head of the Latvian family.  Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres.”  She sat down quickly and Leon stood up from next to Jordan.
“Let me talk to Qye first,” he muttered, finally giving in and using his Videte to begin to scan.  If Harry wasn’t going to come to dinner and still seemed determined to avoid him, he was going to have to resort to some other method soon.
…and Ron promptly groaned when Professor Severus Snape, Head of Slytherin House and Potions Master, glided out from the door behind the Head Table.  Following him was Headmaster Dumbledore and behind him was a tall, cloaked figure who had their hood pulled all the way up so you couldn’t see their face.  And behind them was Draco Malfoy.
Harry removed the paddle from his cauldron and added the thyme leaves quickly.  He glanced at the doorway to see Professor Opacre walk in with a hooded figure behind her.  The figure was obviously Professor Opacre’s brother, which meant he was…
“You didn’t put enough crying faces,” Libby said simply, taking a sip while her clear black eyes studied him over the rim.
Harry blushed slightly but didn’t move. “I’ll go after dinner,” he replied quietly, dropping his eyes. “I promised 'Mione I would anyway.” He raised his eyes again and tried for a small, reassuring smile. “It’s not as bad as it looks, really.”
“Does being born count?” Dean asked sarcastically, pouring himself more pumpkin juice.  Seamus pouted and sniffled.
“Stay together now!” the Herbology teacher shouted over the rising panic as she brandished her wand, frowning at the beast now entangled in growing vines.  “Come now, stay together!”
“Qye, I didn’t mean to exclude you,” Sirius quickly said, also standing and holding his hands up.  “Smethwyck just said that Harry was still experiencing exhaustion and I - ”
“Then again…” he said softly, his dark sapphire eyes gleaming. The next instant, in half a blink, he snapped his arm back and hurled the acorn into the hidden branches of the tree.
"Harry?" Professor Opacre asked concernedly, voice closer. From the corner of his eye he could see her coming to where he knelt on the ground, clear bag in her hands.
“Don’t overexert yourself, Golden Boy,” Draco said as he dropped his eyes and began to clean up their station. “I don’t want my partner vanishing on me right before final exams, you know.”
The vampire shouted and fell back as the white stag erupted from Harry’s wand, galloping forward strong and bright.  Harry took his chance and darted away, dodging around where the young male vampire had taken out two of his enemies and was working on the last.
Qye stiffened as he threw another furious stare at the vampire but Lest didn’t turn around.  He shook, gritting his teeth as he itched to throw himself back at the source of his pain, his hands trembling at his side.  Harry placed a hand on his shoulder and he blew out a disgusted breath, tearing his eyes away from the silent figure of his once best friend.
“Why are you getting any say in treating him?” Sirius demanded.  He turned to Dumbledore, shaking and itching for his wand once more.  “Why are you letting them, why wasn’t Harry taken to St. Mungo’s right away - ”
“You didn’t let me talk to you,” Harry said, a touch of annoyance entering his voice, bringing his blush down.  “We did our work and any time I wanted to clarify what you did, you just went off and - ”
“A vampire?” she supplied, her eyes twinkling slightly.  Hermione blushed slightly but nodded.  Marylin laughed softly and nodded.  “Yes,” she chuckled.  “That was my idea.”  She looked around the class, who were looking slightly more relieved now.  “I thought that maybe if I corrected some of your misunderstandings about vampires before our year began, I could prevent any unnecessary problems between us.  There will be some things that I will be unable to answer because of the code of my kind but I will try my best and answer any questions you have about vampires. So, once again, please begin the questioning.”  She smiled.
His eyes fluttered shut and he surrendered slightly, breathing in the tempting smell, relishing in it for a moment.  God, if the smell drove him
Apparently, since he could see the Threstral, Hagrid decided to assign him to that horse.  Unfortunately, since Malfoy could also see the horse, he was assigned the same horse.  Neville and a Slytherin boy by the name of Blaise Zabini also got assigned the Threstral since they had accidentally let on that they could see it as well.
::  The person shook its head and he got the odd feeling in his head once more, the feeling which was the equivalent of the voice in his head doing something physical in a mental way.  He trembled slightly.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, looking disbelieving at him.  “Don’t tell me you believe him?”  Ron looked at her indignantly and Harry smiled faintly
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut and he leaned against the relief of his burning forehead. He sighed quietly, forgetting the tension of the past week between the two.
His white hands lying atop the armrest clenched slightly as he continued to stare into the dying embers.  They had to be lying.  He couldn’t possibly be there.  Ever since coming back, he had been telling himself this.  But now…his eyes slowly fluttered shut and he let out a loud breath.  He had to consider the possibility.  If he
Jordan’s eyebrows went up at the straying of protocol and he nervously looked at his cousin.  He blinked in surprise at the lack of emotion on his cousin’s pale face and mentally sighed.  ‘
He felt a shakiness from that other part of his mind and tried to reconcile it with the dark pit in his stomach, spreading through his body, trying to push through the numbness.  His green eyes blinked slowly as he realized he walked into a nearby bathroom, silent and empty and cold from the night.
He turned in time to see another beast come sliding around a corner and fumbled with his wand.  He took a step back and the beast crouched and leapt, its cheeks red and mouth wide –
and trying not to notice how Qye and Hermione seemed to have a lot of similarities.  He was saved from thinking something up when the school nurse came out of her office.
“I don’t know,” Ron said, still staring out the window.  “I just know either way, it’s not going to be good.”
“Convenient,” Sirius said flatly, his fingers digging into the couch while his eyes bore holes into the vampire’s disinterested gaze.
Although he managed to escape the inquisition about his date and Hermione bullied them until they swore to stop talking about it, how long until the gossip mill of Hogwarts found out as well?  And after that, it was just a short period of time before the Prophet caught on as well…
“Get Hermione,” Ron said without looking away from Harry, slowly shifting his grip from around his best friend’s body to holding onto his shoulders.  Harry didn’t seem to have anymore fight left in him, swaying on his feet with his head bowed.
“Isn’t that dangerous?” Ron said doubtfully as Harry silently read the description and list of ingredients.
“Oh…” he said quietly, looking back down at his clothes and trying to push away some of his disappointment.  He had missed sending them off and now he was alone for winter break.  Madam Pomfrey quietly went back to her office, leaving him to get dressed.
:: Qye whispered teasingly – smirking at him.  His blush deepened slightly as he recalled what had happened yesterday.  He dropped his eyes down to the ground, recalling the feeling of the other boy’s hands against his own…
Ron turned his glare onto the both of them, shifting the heated gaze from one to another.  "Oh, bloody hell!" he said exasperatedly, throwing down his fork and crossing his arms.  "Have either of you noticed that there's only a couple of days left for winter break?"  Ron glowered at both of them, looking slightly sulky.
“That wasn’t you helping, that was you having a reason to go at him!” Harry snapped back, momentarily glancing over at the blond before looking back at the lights.
She finished her tea and put the cup down, closing the file as she stood up.  Jonas followed, watching as she straightened the sleeves of her Mind-Healer robes and glanced at him.
"I want you all to know that I'm not at all affiliated with them," she continued, peacefully. "In fact, I'm quite opposed to them. But that's for a separate topic. What I do know is that wizards and vampires are becoming closer." She smiled slightly. "I'm glad for that. I'm glad to meet students such as yourselves, despite the difficulties our two species face.
To date, this had been the most silent the class had ever been since the beginning of the year. Harry's eyes roamed across the Gryffindors and Slytherins and if it hadn't been for the differently colored House badges, one would think they were all the same. The same shuffling footsteps, quiet so as to not attract attention. The same downcast eyes, so when Professor Opacre's gaze swept the crowd, they would not meet her and be forced to speak. Just a little while ago, these same students were glaring at one another and yet now, Harry could see Pansy Parkinson and Parvati Patil edging behind Blaise Zabini, pushing him forward while he tried to stand his ground behind Draco.
He brought his mind back from his ponderings in time to see the wand tip turn green and see the witch look at it with a confused frown. Shaking her head, she recast the spell and watched again with a bewildered look in her eyes as it turned green again. Finishing the spell, she stared at Qye with a bemused look in her eyes.
“I’ll bloody well say whatever the bloody hell I want, you utter prat!” Ron snarled as he kicked away the beast and blasted it with a stunner, which seemed a lot more useful against its kind instead of the other ones.  It collapsed against the floor twitching and the redhead barely had a break to catch his breath before something violently assaulted his mind.
A groan reverberated in Draco’s chest, thrumming against him and his fingers tightened again, his breath gasping as his skin burned.
She roughly pulled open the drawer and revealed the hidden compartment, her frown turning into a snarl as she recognized the simple wind up watch now wildly rattling as its hands spun around to indicate its message.
Ron rolled his eyes as Hermione proceeded to drag him out. “Catch some rest, mate, I doubt she’ll be letting you do any real relaxing once she brings the homework.” He grinned as Hermione swatted him again and Harry laughed as he waved farewell.
“Hold your tongue while addressing a Head, boy!” Saira hissed, glaring at him while standing up from the table as the Taine’s cousin silently entered the meeting room.  Leon didn’t say anything as he stood from his armchair but Jordan but could practically feel the satisfaction pour out of him.  He ground his teeth slowly while he straightened up from his position of leaning against the wall next to the window.  His twin was already standing in the middle of the room but Krista hastily stood up from the couch, walking towards the table in the middle.  The only one who remained sitting was Verna, who was still sitting unconcernedly next to the fireplace, knitting away.
Draco blinked, still confused, and Harry took in a deep breath, slowly exhaling as he took another step back.  “I’m not…this isn’t me saying no.  I just need a minute.”
!" Hermione shouted, flicking her wand towards Lest. Harry could feel the blast of magic make its mark and knew Hermione had made it as strong as possible, taking this duel seriously.
Hermione's shock was evident to Harry even from the back of the room and he heard a few disturbed murmurs pass through the rest of the crowd, a few of them shifting uncomfortably, some even mumbling to themselves to not use that spell. Harry didn't move his eyes from the duel where Lest was just staring amusedly at an unsettled Hermione, neither of them moving. That prickle of concern welled up in him again and he wondered for a moment if this duel was really as even as he had thought.
“To the left,” Dumbledore said quietly, walking after Sirius with Remus slowly trailing after.  The vampires said nothing as they left the entrance room, Dumbledore overtaking Sirius and leading them.
Ron opened his mouth to answer but before he could say anything he grunted as Harry threw himself forward, a strangled cry in his throat as he reached for his trunk again.  His bare feet skidded across the floor and he tightened his hold.
“Well, Mr. Potter, looks like you’re all right now,” she said, walking over to his drawer and pulling out his clothes.  “Whatever happened to you didn’t appear to leave any lasting damage.”
Qye looked at the window next to his bed and frowned as he saw that it was still blurry. Then a thought dawned on him.
The day before the O.W.L.s ended, the day before the potion was to be completed, he saw Draco on his way back from checking it.
In the course of two months, Opacre had turned everyone’s feeling toward her in the opposite direction.  The cautious, distrustful feeling that had filled the air whenever she was around at first was now an accepting, amused – in a bemused sort of way – feeling.  All the students were now quite used to their joking, odd vampire professor.
“Being betrayed does funny things to a person,” Qye smiled humorlessly.  The table legs tapped slowly against the floor and he closed his eyes and laid back down.  “You didn’t use to be this passive either.”
The redhead spread his hands in front of him, smiling.  “I’m just thinking in your best interests,” Ron said innocently.  A mutter came from beneath the blankets.  “What was that?”
Harry met his gaze unwavering, hand gripping his wand tightly. "Because," he replied quietly, flashes of green light and a terrible darkness clinging to him only a week ago going through his head,"If this had been real, you'd be dead by now."
She stopped as he slowly turned his head to look at her from where he had been looking out the window.
Qye briefly glanced over before returning his eyes to the wall.  “Probably more bullshit about how we should stop being stubborn and work with them to make things like they want.”  He glared at the wall, his fingers digging in.  “They have no frame of reference for anything like this, what the hell do they know?”
“It’s okay,” he interrupted, forcing a smile.  “I know you didn’t mean it like that.”  Hermione looked at him worriedly and he looked down at his plate.
Harry sighed as he scanned the rest of the section.  Underneath the section entitled ‘Benefits’, there were vague bulletpoints.  Increased strength and speed, blood protection, amplified senses…
Qye shouted and his entire right side jerked back, not totally of his control, as several larger trinkets made their way past his shield and aimed for his hand. Harry grimaced and it didn't even require thought, shooting a succession of '
Qye looked up from where he laid next to Harry, absently squeezing the ball in his hand while Harry kept his face buried in the pillow.
Harry trembled, feeling everyone’s gazes on him as he stood close to Draco – he dimly realized he was calling him Draco now – his hands on the Slytherin’s and his back to the frosty vampire.
Harry smiled slightly, eyes still closed.  Ever since they had returned from vacation, Ron and Hermione had been mothering him constantly, making sure he ate right and got a decent amount of sleep.  He had often seen them share worried looks when they thought he wasn’t looking and he wondered why they worried.  It wasn’t as if he was acting strange…at least, he didn’t think so.  True, he didn’t talk as much anymore to them – or to anyone for that matter – but he didn’t think that would matter.  He still spent the same amount of time with them, he just…didn’t talk.
“There’s something about that, isn’t there?” Qye said, watching as the Healer glanced back up at him.  He stared, unblinking, as the frown on the man’s face deepened and he straightened up.
“What are you doing here, Professor?” Malfoy asked Remus as if she wasn’t speaking.  Remus eyed her as she snapped her mouth shut and gave the young man a withering look.
:: he muttered to them as he settled in comfortably.  Harry could feel the lure of regular sleep and he struggled fruitlessly to push it away.  He didn’t really understand what was going on right now but he figured he had better find out as much as he could about this person in his head before talking to Pomfrey or Dumbledore about them.  He didn’t want them to think him as crazy as some people thought him.
“There are some things that I want to tell you about…” he started slowly, raising his eyes again. “But, I don’t want you to be hurt when I say that there are some things that I can’t just talk about. Not right now. I’m still thinking and working on them - ”
.  He was so close…the Libidates rose in him again, telling him to give up all pretenses and let it loose, let it out of the cage he had made for it so long ago.
“We’re going to find Harry and drag him back to the Infirmary as soon as possible before Pomfrey blows a fuse,” Ron said absently, carelessly shoving away the ragged hand-me-downs of Harry.
“Exactly,” he said cheerfully, still grinning at the representative of the Jeaneyl family.  Jordan often suspected there was something going on between the two, or that there might be something in the future but he said nothing.  Jacob continued in a passionate tone of voice, saying, “At least there’s somebody in here who’s just as smart as me.  I mean honestly, who the hell wants to think about all this gloomy shit when - ”
She felt the presence of Saira and Leon come into focus, dropping Leon’s stealth shielding from behind the Dazains.  She became aware of a few Nosle Kids dashing through the trees, searching for the Dazain vampires hanging back as they always did.  She knew it was Irene, her star student, who had pulled the wand as the young woman sent a brief sense of support before focusing on the battle in the surrounding area.
Harry nodded and backed off, already hearing the whispers starting.  “Try and make sure Ron doesn’t make any more deals, yeah?” he grinned at her.
In Liverpool, a jar shook and almost fell next to the buzzing portkey.  It tumbled over and its contents were caught in a pouch, tied onto a belt.
Qye asked curiously and Harry's hand twitched in surprise, too distracted by his panic to control his reaction.
Remus didn’t bother asking if Harry was okay anymore, gritting his teeth as he caught yet another scent of blood in the corridor, coming from a young man standing vigilant by a doorway around a corner. The vampire sharply watched Remus pass but said nothing as the Headmaster opened the door.
“Continued sessions with me,” Wainscott said calmly as she steadily met each of their eyes.  “While you navigate your respective lives.”
“May I interrupt?” came Myn’s faint, strangled voice from behind them. Both of them blinked, the annoyance vanishing from their eyes.
Harry closed his eyes.  A moment later, Qye grimaced and his glower flickered momentarily towards his other half.  Harry lifted his head to regard Qye and Sirius watched in strange fascination as they seemed to have a brief, silent conversation.  Qye gritted his teeth, Harry dropped his gaze to his knees once more and Sirius felt Remus lean back as dark green eyes swung to him.
keep your little…feud…to yourselves and not spread it around.  I’m trying to find an alliance between vampires and wizards and that isn’t going to happen if you two fight every time you meet each other’s eyes.  So,” she took a deep breath, “I’m
Qye noted and Harry noticed he was still just giving off stammers. Professor Opacre's eyes had started to crinkle in concern so he bit his lip and stared back at her, not sure what to do next.
Qye suddenly said and Harry blinked, irritation displaced by the tone of Qye's voice. It sounded suddenly realized and viciously victorious at the same time.
It was past midnight, all the other boys were sleeping and snoring in their beds and Harry was awake in bed as his mind still reeled in shock over the events earlier in the day.
“I promise,” he said, pushing away the taste and wondering if he could manage to trade his plate with Ron’s before Hermione could notice.
“Once again, welcome to another year at Hogwarts,” he said, his blue eyes twinkling.  “I hope you’ve all had a restful and relaxing summer despite the circumstances we find ourselves in.”  There were some snorts of disbelief from the students but the Headmaster ignored them.  “Now then, I’ll just lay down the basic rules that the past students should remember and our new students should take to heart.  No magic in the corridors or any other type of object that might be found in Mr. Filch’s list of banned items.  Yes, that means your new items, Mr. and Mr. Weasley,” he said, eyes twinkling as he looked at the sulking Weasley twins, Fred and George.  Chuckling slightly, he continued, “There is a curfew so be sure to know what time it is required for you to be back in your common rooms.  No one is allowed to enter the Forbidden Forest for any reason.  And, of course, with the rise of Voldemort once again - ” - some people shivered at this – “ – new security measures have been put up to ensure your safety so please do not step out-of-bounds without permission unless you wish to encounter some rather unpleasant surprises.”  Once again, he looked pointedly at the Weasley twins who were looking more wary than worried or disappointed.
:: he thought to the other boy tentatively. There was no response and upon further investigation, Qye found him to be…sleeping? He frowned further and concentrated.
His parents repeatedly contacted Dumbledore since the day Ron came reluctantly back on the Hogwarts Express.  Arthur quietly praised his children’s responses and Molly held them tight and praised that they came back safely.  They did not hide their concern about the missing teenager.  Their brows furrowed and the lines by their eyes grew every day they received vague responses.
“Are you sure you’re alright, Harry?” Granger asked again quietly and Qye couldn’t resist letting out an exasperated sigh, shooting a look at the girl.
“Harry…Potter?” she asked softly, raising her eyes again to the boy.  The green eyes narrowed slightly, looking a bit more wary, and she noticed that Hermione Granger and a red-haired boy she did not have name for lean a bit protectively towards him.  She raised an eyebrow but said nothing.  She merely continued to look at Harry for a bit longer.  The boy just met her eyes evenly, still calm and serene and wary and there was that surge again.  She tapped her finger on her podium a few times then shook her head and returned her attention to the roll sheet.  Murmurs began to rise in the classroom but she quickly killed them when she resumed taking attendance.
“Who would be calling at this time of night?”  Petunia Dursley sniffed, her giraffe neck craning around to peer curiously down the corridor.
he heard Dean shout and the vampire shifted back, rocking on his heels with his teeth bared viciously.  Seamus grabbed his arm and started dragging him back to the group where they had steadily been retreating since Blaise’s spell had fallen.
The teenager stared at them, the anger falling from his face, a quick flash of something uncertain before he looked away from them again, folding his arms across his chest.
“I don’t know, Padfoot,” Remus said slowly, staring down the hallway where the blonde stood looking away from them.  He swallowed and exchanged a look with his friend.
He remembered one passage.  The journal never gave any dates, merely separating entries with a swirling line or sometimes stars.  The passage had read:
Pulling up the hood to his cloak, Harry looked up at the dark castle of Hogwarts.  Usually, the sight of the magnificent stone castle filled him with such a sense of joy that he smiled for the rest of the day.  But now, all he did was look at it with weariness, knowing that another year that was bound to be full of something or the other awaited him.
:: the voice said sarcastically and Harry got the faint impression that the person was smirking.  He frowned slightly but the other one continued before he could say anything.
On top of the clothes had lain a couple of books with their pages yellowed.  They weren't handwritten like the journal and looked something akin to textbooks.  He had tried opening them but the books were tightly shut and no matter how hard he tried to pull the pages apart, they remained stuck as if glued together.  It had puzzled him since they appeared to have no locks and he had looked at the covers but there was only strange writing on it.  He had eventually given up on trying to open them, putting them under the mattress, bundling them up in the clothes.  He knew he probably should have turned them in but he just wanted to keep them a bit longer to study them.
Harry was silent for a long while as Qye closed his eyes and tried the stupid counting and breathing again.
Dumbledore would…what?  Fix him?  Fix his memories?  Fix what the vampire had stolen, hidden from him?
The Libidates flared up in him, stronger than ever.  He suppressed his shiver and bit back his moan of want, need.  The Libidates continued to rage in him, against his restraint, eager to be set free from where he had kept it in its cage for five years.
There was no smile on her face as she patted Ron the shoulder and sent him along. As he made his way back to the crowd, accepting the halfhearted congratulations of his dorm mates, there was a sharp look in her eyes. She shook her head clearing all traces of it just as Ron turned back around.
As even more memories flooded back to him, he mentally cursed the damned vampire he was lying on top of. Before he could stop himself, forgetting to do what he normally did and pause and think of the consequences, Qye found himself lifting up slowly, raising his head, full of annoyance.
Lest fell silent and Qye let go of the lip he was biting on, blinking as Harry lifted his head and looked over to the vampire, his eyes glowing bright and the goosebumps on Qye’s skin breaking out once more.
He slid in next to Draco and ignored the continued glances and whispers at them, the fodder for future gossip.  His hand brushed the blond’s as he turned to look at the dance floor, listened to the music.
Ron and Hermione were looking at him worriedly.  Blinking again, he looked around and saw Dean, Seamus and Neville eyeing him.  Glancing up at the Head Table, he saw the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher chatting contently with Professor Sprout.  He turned back to his friends, his mouth opening and closing.  Then he sighed and closed his eyes, pressing the palms of his hands against them.  Something had happened.  His head was pulsing, pounding so much that he felt like his head might explode.  He didn’t know what just happened but
Ron blinked and looked up to see Harry standing by the door, his Firebolt slung over his shoulder and his eyebrow raised.
The trip up to Hogwarts was uncomfortably long and awkward.  Marylin attempted small talk with questions about their train ride but gave up quickly at Remus’ brief responses.  He looked out the window while Sirius lay at his feet, both of them troubled by the vampire’s woman presence and the nervous play of her fingers twisting in her lap.
it.  But he always tried so hard to be so serious, as if he was above such nonsense.”  She giggled again as she brushed his hair.  “If I didn’t do it, I was sure I’d strangle him, he had such a poor manner to him.  The poor boy never knew how to relax.”
At that moment, Harry became aware of a few things.  One, he had just called Malfoy by his first name with the name just seeming to roll off his tongue with ease.  Two, Draco was looking both surprised and furious, surprised because of the use of his first name and furious because Harry wasn’t allowing him to draw his wand.  Three was that although Harry couldn’t see him, he could feel Lest’s cold glare burning into his back, making him want to shake with fear and move from his spot between the two.  Four was that Qye’s feeling of shock had just grown.
He closed his eyes as the other teenager bent his head slightly and brushed a kiss against his cheek.
Glancing towards the back, he saw the taller vampire calmly walking through the rows and softly speaking with pale and nervous Slytherins and Gryffindors.  The vampire paused for a few moments with each student, causing them to sweat.  Parvati dropped a vial when he spoke with her and Harry winced slightly at her terrified expression.
:: asked Qye in a disbelieving tone of voice as Harry looked at the two bicker, seeming to momentarily forget about Harry.
It wasn’t their safety she had in mind when she followed them however.  Nor was she thinking of all three.
Wainscott looked at him steadily.  He turned around and slid his hands into the pockets of his pajama pants, leaning against the bookshelf as he narrowed his eyes at her.
Welcome!  For those of you just joining, you will want to check out "Qye" (keeping in mind it was written over the course of 12 years so my writing has progressed I hope) if you would like more background.  "Opacre" is not necessary to read.  You might be able to jump in and I'd be happy to answer questions as I can.
Qye said quietly.  Harry started, having forgotten about the other boy.  Before he could say anything, Draco continued.
"Some think that from these stones, that changed their strength from the Moon to blood, were the first vampires, the
He let out a small sigh, the tightness in his chest loosening slightly.  He had guessed some things about Qye before but there were pieces of information in that brief biography that he hadn’t known from his readings.  For instance…
He nervously waited for the rest of the class to leave so he could ask Professor Opacre for “help”.  He had told Ron and Hermione it was a question for the O.W.L.s and shrugged off Hermione’s hurt offer of help, reassuring her that he knew she could and promising to review it with her.  Ron gave him a long look before dragging Hermione away, coaxing her with a promise that if Harry didn’t join them in ten minutes they’d be back.
Lest jumped back as the first Blasting Charm broke off the leg of one of the desks. The vampire paused for only a moment, shooting Harry a sharp look that he barely noticed before he grimaced and moved to avoid the next ones.
"And that is the main reason why we're doing this, Hermione," Professor Opacre responded calmly. "So you have even the smallest bit of experience to take with you should you ever find yourself in such a situation."
The Gryffindors growled as the Slytherins passed them.  He heard a few of them hiss “Pleasant dreams, Potty” but he refused to raise his eyes from the stony floor as they moved past him.  As Malfoy passed him, he felt the pale Slytherin brush his hand against his own.  He quickly shoved his hands into his pockets, refusing to look at him and after a barely noticeable pause, the blond continued and walked into the classroom.
His back stiffened more and he remained silent, his face closed off. Swallowing, Marylin probed further, half-hoping and half-dreading the answer.
“I was about to ask the same thing,” the Slytherin said lightly.  He looked back at Draco and tilted his head.  “Anything to say, Draco?”
“Absolutely!” she chirped, rocking on her heels.  “I use to dress up my little cousins and brother when they were younger, I have a wide selection.  I brought some over just in case and I’m sure we can make it fit.”  Her eyes shone.  “I have rather missed it.”
“I’ll do it,” Sirius blurted before thinking, shaking his head and then nodding quickly, jerkily.  “I’ll talk with them, I just wasn’t expecting…”  He faltered as he thought about what to say, how to act.
His own words echoed through his mind as he guided a disguised Sirius to the courtroom, having discussed beforehand not risking exposing his Animagus form when there was already so much on the line.  Faith, he thought, as he grimly stood by the innocent man while Pettigrew sat sobbing as the charges ran against him.
Sirius turned his head to him and gave the man a look Remus had seen reserved only for Snape before.  “Who asked you?”
“I’m insensitive?” Ron spluttered, turning in his chair and looking indignantly at her.  “What is that supposed to mean?”
Harry and Qye looked away from him, green eyes once again sharing nonverbal exchanges and Sirius struggled to ask, fighting off anger that would have no outlet.
Oh, and five?  Five was the realization that the entire class had stopped working and were – and had been – staring at Lest, Draco, and Harry.
“I don’t know,” Draco shrugged again, taking a step back and dropping his gaze, leaving Harry feeling colder without his nearby warmth.  “But this summer put a lot of things in perspective for me.  Made me think about the person I wanted to be, what I wanted to do.”  He looked back up at Harry, his eyes shadowed and careful.  “Some things change people, as you should know after last year.”
It was quiet for a moment around the table, the only sound in the room being the crackling of the fireplace and the clicking Verna knitting.
At her raised eyebrow and surprised look, he chastised himself and continued in a submissive voice. “Is something the matter?”
The vampire woman folded her arms and looked evenly at him.  “Hair and one bracelet,” she said after a minute of staring.
He frowned as he stood up, discarding the trash and cleaning his materials.  Qye was sounding odd again.  His voice was almost…mechanical.  As if he was just responding automatically without thinking about it.  Considering the turbulent the feelings he was giving off were, his emotionless voice alarmed Harry greatly.
“We attack on the last day of exams,” Dazain murmured, flipping his broach with his Gemmus in one hand.
The Slytherins had perked up, ready to support their Housemate and she heard Seamus whisper of how he was practically the equivalent of Harry and they were all practically making way for him to be the next contestant...
Qye knew that no matter how hard he tried to act like Harry, he wouldn’t be able to pull it off completely. And since he knew next to nothing about Harry’s personal past, he knew he wouldn’t be able to say anything if they brought something like that up. And that would certainly cause more than a few raised eyebrows, something Qye did not need.
Already he could feel control returning to his body and Qye moving back while he stared at the still vampire on the ground before him. His breathing was steady and he knew every eye was on him. He blinked, only once.
Harry stopped, taken aback by the snarl.  He felt a swarm of betrayal and fear before Qye calmed down.
Harry couldn’t help himself and took a step forward, carefully putting a hand on the other’s arm.  Draco didn’t look at him and Harry could feel the tension in his body.
“Sorry, Harry,” she said quietly.  “Just remembering a long time ago.”  He felt her hand brush down his hair before she stepped back.  “Give me a moment, I just need something to set this.”
An air of disinterest entered those eyes and he watched them slip away from his gaze, looking back at the other teenager.  He glanced briefly at the bed, made sure he was still asleep, before he looked back at the sitting teenager.  He hesitated and then crouched down in front of the chair.
“Annoyed is more like it,” he muttered back to the cool voice without thinking.  Then his eyes shot open and he jerked his head up to blink at a smirking Malfoy.
Every day they both looked more and more frustrated but Harry couldn’t afford the time to care for either of them, not when he was looking for his own solution as the end of the year was so near.
Turning his eyes uncertainly to Lest, Harry was confused to see the vampire looking at him with a bitter look in his eyes.  He unconsciously leaned closer against Draco, uneasy about the rapidly swirling emotions in the dark blue eyes.
There was silence again but this time it was much shorter and broken by a boy who she identified Seamus Finnegan.
So this is where I may a lose a couple of people because the most recurring comment I've had is "when will they merge?". All I ask is please keep reading because there are still a lot of things that can happen, one way or another.  I will definitely say this is one issue that is not laid to rest, as much as Qye wants it to be.  I can't say much more without spoiling so I hope you give me a chance.
He could distantly see the startled look on the young vampire’s face, black eyes wide from where he stood still next to an equally shocked enemy vampire.
Hermione fidgeted.  “Maybe we should talk to Draco?” she said delicately.  “See if Harry would be more amenable?”
A pale eyebrow raised and Ron gritted his teeth as his eyes focused in the dark and found Malfoy leaning against a wall. A wall that he just happened to have to go by to get back to the Gryffindor Common Room with the snacks from the kitchens. Harry's 'victory' was being bragged to every one who had dueled Lest since no one seemed to have been able to beat him. And since Ron had been the closest after him, with Fred and George trailing behind him, a celebration was taking place. He, in effort to calm himself and
“Really, Padfoot?” Remus sighed as both pairs of green eyes went wide. “I told you not to mention that.”  Sirius shrugged, unrepentant, sure in the fact that they needed to know how much they were wanted.
There were a few other students in the corridor with them, mostly Ravenclaws with their concentration on the notes they held as they headed to lunch.  In a rare occurrence, Draco didn’t have any of his Slytherin housemates with him and walked with a distant frown at a book he held in his hand.
The silver-blond snorted. “M’not worried,” Draco said diffidently. But he squeezed back gently before slowly letting go. They both returned to cleaning up as Snape gave out the homework assignment.
Harry let out a short breath and gave her a hesitant smile as he followed her lead.  “Thanks, I appreciate it.”  He ducked his head and awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck.  “I know it’s a strange request - ”
“The Ministry would just like to know if you wish to go home and retrieve whatever you might have left there,” Dumbledore said quietly, his brightless blue eyes looking down at him.  Harry faintly pondered why he looked so sad and pained.
“He’s sleeping now,” Madam Pomfrey said quietly as she walked out of the room where Harry lay unconscious.
“Jacob and Jordan Taine,” his red-haired twin said in his most formal tone voice.  “Representatives of the Taine family of vampires from the United States, which is second-in-command to the Head family of the North American vampires.  Sons of Robert and Morgan Taine, current Heads of the Taine family.  Cousins to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres.”  Jacob sat back down and muttered under his breath, “Not that it matters anymore, really…”
“Oh, for Hélène’s sake,” barked the vampire teacher, anger laced in her voice.  “You know I wouldn’t be visiting your class if I had my way but the Headmaster made me promise that I would show my brother your class.  It’ll only take a moment, I just want to show him a regular wizarding class.”  Opacre paused then said something in a low murmur.  Whatever she said caused Snape to stiffen before reluctantly moving away from the doorway.  His cold, black eyes stared in furiously at the revealed DADA teacher, who was looking extremely smug.
Draco glanced at him.  “Venators,” he said.  He rolled his shoulders and looked back over at the Shrieking Shack.  “They’re an association of…well.  For legal and practical reasons, hunters aren’t exactly sanctioned by any government vampires reside in.  The wizarding world and vampires long ago made an unspoken agreement to stay out of each other’s way.  It was basically understood that if they were ever to enter a conflict, the damage would be devastating.  So Venators are the ones outside of the law to call should a vampire ever turn rogue.  For obvious reasons, the vampires don’t take too kindly of others interfering with what they perceive to be their own affairs but…” He shrugged.  “If they can’t handle it, the Venators are there to make sure no one else gets hurt.”
“Oh, by the way,” she said before she called on the next person who raised their hand.  The class looked at her curiously and she smiled sweetly.  “Anyone who thought I was over five hundred had better get a damn good present for my birthday, which is on March 16.”  There was silence.  Then those who hadn’t thought she was over five hundred began to laugh at those who did.  Those who had thought so just smiled sheepishly and Marylin saw the black-haired boy snicker at a pale looking Ron Weasley.
“He had heard that the heir of the current reigning family of vampires needed someone, someone who would gain all the connections and power that come with such a position.  So I was introduced to Opacre.”  He grimaced.  “Well, that didn’t go well at all.  He was arrogant, demanding, thought he knew better than anyone else, and - ”  The blond stopped and gave Harry an annoyed glower as the other teenager coughed, raising a hand to cover his smile.  “Do you want to hear this or not?” he asked sourly, his shoulders hunching up.
Harry let go of a frustrated sigh and ran a hand through his hair.  Malfoy.  Now there was another thing to think about altogether.  His Slytherin rival had turned rather…strange.  In almost all his classes he had been paired up with the pale boy and the result was him spending more time with the Malfoy heir than he usually would have.  The Professors seemed to have this new passion for assigning projects and work in pairs and so Harry, instead of happily doing the work by his own in the friendly atmosphere of Gryffindor Tower, found himself in the stuffy library with his rival.
“Boys,” Smethwyck sighed, rolling his eyes as they gave him a look.  He stepped out of the way as they walked out, locking the door behind them as they made their way to the sitting room.
“Fucking right it won’t be,” Sirius rasped, finally reaching the end of his tether, wand or not.  He watched Lest slowly rise, the blue in his eyes darkening to almost black.   “You’re not getting anywhere near him again.”
“I made the choice to leave him,” his voice stated coldly.  “I sealed his memories to protect him and I will not apologize to you or anyone else for it.”
Annnnd this is the chapter where everyone starts to freak out and hate me. XD  All I can say is give it time and a chance! ^_^
His tight chest loosened and he rolled onto his back, his arms slowly covering his face as he rested back into the pillows and mattress.
Dazain raised a hand towards Harry and Lest lunged forward, his face twisted with his rage and dread.
“Then why are you so tired?” demanded Ron, looking at his best friend.  A sudden thought occurred to him and he paled slightly.  “You…you didn’t…have one of those…those dreams…did you?  I mean, about…about…”
“But periods end,” a boy she recalled as being Theodore Nott scowled.  “How do we know that animal blood may stop ‘sustaining’ you during one of our lessons and you decide to take a few liters out of us?”
Remus prodded him in the back and he gathered his courage to make his way to the couch facing the teenagers, sitting stiff and tense.  Remus joined him, shifting uncomfortably despite his outwardly quiet expression, his body betraying his own set of nerves.  Dumbledore thoughtfully peered into the cup of tea he had poured himself and Sirius saw Wainscott keep her head down, her quill still in her hand.
“Oh, really?” she grinned, lowering the pencil.  She leaned back against the desk, her eyes twinkling.  “Anyone I know, Harry?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” the green-eyed boy muttered, still looking in annoyance at the vampire.  He blinked in surprise when the smile vanished from the pale face.
and Lest didn’t need to feel the sudden tension of fear and anger as a new group of people appeared next to the Dazains to know exactly who they were.
- and immediately begun.  Now that the exams were underway, he spent every moment not testing or studying checking in on the potion.
Qye shrunk further back into Harry's mind but he could feel the satisfaction pouring mightily from the other boy as he struggled to retain a calm composure and frantically thought of what to do.
“It’s funny,” Malfoy hissed, “that you’re calling me that when everyone knows that you kissed your father’s ass more than anyone, including your mother.”
:: Qye mumbled but Harry felt him calm down.  He was about to respond to that when he felt a tap on his knee.  Raising his head from his hands, he looked at Malfoy, who nodded up to the front where Snape was getting ready for a lecture.  Sighing, he dropped his hands and picked up his quill.
“Good,” she said, her eyes twinkling.  She looked around the class and her smile broadened when she noticed that more and more students were beginning to loosen up around her.  “Any more questions?” she asked, beaming at the class.  A boy on the left side of the room, Blaise Zabini, raised his hand.  “Yes?”
Harry woke up aching the next morning, partly from having fallen asleep next to a snoring Ron and dozing Hermione and partly from Qye’s longing and loneliness.
Lest had stopped in the middle of telling Black exactly where he could shove that stick he was trying to take from Dumbledore, hardly breathing as his mind shut down and abruptly restarted again as a million thoughts and hopes and fears flashed through it all at once.
’ around her.  Dreams of his parents emerging from the wand of Voldemort and instead of being encouraging, they told him how much of a disappointment he was.
Jonas cradled his empty cup in his hands, chewing on his bottom lip as he resisted the urge to nervously tap his foot or shake his leg.
“I’ll give you a few minutes,” Draco said, backing away.  “But if I don’t see you soon, I’ll come fetch you.  Merlin knows what Granger would do to me if I lost you now.”
“Tough luck, boy,” a voice floated through the dust and he coughed again, blinking as it began to settle.  “We still have you.”
It was the end of the first week of August and it was an ordinary day with ordinary weather.  Ordinary people went to work on the 7th of August, going on with their ordinary lives.  The ordinary people had bid good-bye to their relatives and gone to work.  They had gone, unsuspecting of what lay in store for them.  Those ordinary people were completely and totally unprepared for the Death Eaters waiting around every corner in Diagon Alley.  They were like lambs sent to slaughter and by the time the Aurors managed to bring everything under control, eighty-five were killed and a hundred were wounded.
that choker, he gave him that choker right before things went to hell and he screamed and struck and Lest ducked out of the way, the stake glancing off the post and catching at his shoulder, tearing raggedly at the cloth.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Ron scowled, glaring at her.  Harry sighed as the beginnings of a new argument began to arise.
Since he was Qye, what did that mean for him, the part that was just not real at all?  What would happen to him when they – he – the memories were fixed?  How would two vastly different personalities and memories and lives fix back together?
written in simple block letters.  “Even if I had not been placed under a Binding Spell and given strict instructions about the necessity of secrecy for this case, I would not record or do anything without your explicit and informed consent, Harry.”
“There’s….something we need to talk about,” she said reluctantly, wishing this had all gone differently.  She wearily watched as Dumbledore looked at them thoughtfully, McGonagall suspiciously and Snape with carefully narrowed eyes.
He sighed and dropped his hands, smiling reassuringly at her worried face.  “I’m fine,” he said quietly.  She didn’t look convinced, still frowning slightly.  “Really, I’m okay,” he added.  “Nothing wrong whatsoever.”
Ever since the Dursleys' attack, his rival had become. . .well, he couldn't say polite or nice since this
Hermione let out a muffled, surprised sound as he wrapped his arms around her and hugged her tightly.
Jordan felt Jacob’s irritation at having to state themselves and he suppressed a smile.  It was a tedious thing but unlike his twin, Jordan knew it was necessary.  ‘
“Dumbledore, no!” a woman’s voice shouted and Lest turned around and Qye’s free fist glanced at his cheek and sent him reeling back.  “None of you touch him, the Pater will not understand right now!”
“How are you?” he asked, his eyes flicking between them, mouth opening and closing, wanting to say more but not having the words.
Harry paused as he came across the questions on Threstrals and forced down his memories of working with Draco, forcing himself to finish quickly.  He sat furiously scribbling away every characteristic of a winged horse that he remembered, trying not to count the minutes until he could slip away.
The school nurse already had a potion waiting for him by the time he arrived and judging from the sympathetic look that she had given him, and taking into account McGonagall’s behavior, he guessed that the staff already knew about the Dursleys.  He had quickly left the Infirmary, unable to stand any more sympathy or pity.  Dumbledore had given him the rest of the day off and he had secluded himself in his dorm, not wanting to see the other students staring or whispering.
“Don’t!” Qye snapped harshly, pointing a shaking finger at him.  “Don’t you bloody dare!  You let us live or find another way to get rid of me now.  If you try to merge me into Harry, I swear to any power that exists, I’ll make it so that any trace of me disappears so that you’ll be left with nothing at all.   You lived with it once, I’m sure you can do it again.”
Hermione carefully sat down next to him as he looked at the passing crowd, everyone too caught up in the excitement of the event to notice the two students.
“Not at all,” Ron grinned and Harry rolled his eyes, unwrapping the top and shoving it in his mouth. He saw Ron’s eyes widen in horror and his mouth open a minute too late as the taste hit his tongue.
“You haven’t answered my question, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled as he stared at the bubbling liquid, which was slowly turning green.  “Why do you care if I’m angry at you or not?”
The wand fell into Lest's palm just as one last trinket crashed into an unsteady Ron, dropping him to the floor.
"Finnegan's actually got point," Nott hissed, back pressed against the back wall. "Just accept your fate, Potter, and do your little hero thing!"
“Fine,” she said reluctantly, beginning to load his and her plate with food. “But promise me you’ll go straight to the Infirmary after dinner.”
She took in a deep breath and walked over to him, gently putting her hand on his shoulder.  “I’ve asked all I can, Harry.  This is the most you’ve given me since the year started and…” She hesitated and squeezed his shoulder before letting go.  “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to keep asking but you told us you would tell us when you were ready.  I have to believe that this is your way of starting to.”
In the Infirmary, the figure of Harry Potter lay on the bed, silent all night. The few times the nurse checked on him, he lay motionless. But when she was not there, his body trembled and his eyes flickered rapidly under his eyelids. By the time the sun began to gently rouse its head, the black-haired teenager lay completely still. The eyes fluttered as the first beam of sunlight crept into the room.
:: Harry said back and he heard Qye murmur again before resuming his reading.  Harry once again thanked any merciful force in the world that Qye left him alone during his study sessions with Malfoy.  Unfortunately, the other boy chose to read his memories during these times and he had to deal with the consequences of Qye learning more and more about his life every time.
’ Harry thought confusedly, blinking as the tall – he had grown over the summer – blond boy arrogantly nodded to Dumbledore and Snape and began walking to the Slytherin Table.  Their eyes met for a moment and Malfoy stopped in his tracks, his pale eyes holding Harry’s calmly.  Then he sneered at him, contempt filling his gray eyes.
“Yes, the war among vampires,” he said, laughing mirthlessly, his eyes cold.  “It’s convenient that Professor Opacre has failed to tell us anything about it.  It’s also convenient the vampires decided to send an ambassador right after their war ended, don’t you think?”
’ He opened his mouth to change his answer but then he closed it again.  Something was telling him he had to go back.  He numbly wondered what and why.
Something glinted in the corner of his eye and he turned his head, hand still raised, and his breath froze as he saw another bed.
His mind was like newly spun glass, fragile and getting even more so with every second that was an eternity.  He shivered in the arms of someone, hardly aware of his physical state.  His mind, so fragile, something on the other side of the glass, he could almost see it.  It was trying to break free, trying to get out, escape and take part of him and his mind quivered, the spider threads holding it together quivering to keep it. . .
“Sit,” the head of the Opacre family said, still using his cold voice.  As he sat down next to his twin, Jordan dimly pondered if he ever had another type of voice.
Harry ranted as Qye closed his eyes and thought about how he reached for him, thought about pulling back now.
'. All that had done was make Lest move more than any other duel, seemingly able to tell when and where the next attack was coming. As the ropes started to fall from the last spell, having completely missed their target, they stopped midway and flew towards Dean. Professor Opacre had to spend the next five minutes explaining what went wrong and other helpful hints while she struggled with the complicated knots.
“Malfoy’s Galleons are just good as anyone else’s,” Fred said cheerfully as he popped up behind Zabini, making the Slytherin jump.
Harry looked at his friend in sympathetic amusement as he drank some of his pumpkin juice, his Potions notes next to his plate of eggs and kippers.  They had spent the entire night studying frantically for the Potions quiz that they had…forgotten…about and he could understand his best friend’s sour mood.  Studying until midnight and then having to wake up early for a quiz – a Potions one at that – did not make a Weasley happy.
Most Gryffindors were up past midnight now, even on the weekends, as they all struggled to remember their information and practice their spells.  Fred and George were even spotted taking notes, although it wasn’t clear if it was for the exams or future pranks.
Harry blinked as he stumbled back, blinking again as someone suddenly appeared next to the now dead creature, swiftly removing the long weapon.  He took another step back, wand automatically raised as they turned around.
“He’ll be back,” Hermione sighed as Ron slowly chewed his food, blue eyes wandering through the room, towards the entrance where the students straggled through and the staff table where the teachers kept their heads up.  “Not much time to get into any serious trouble.”
“Alright, that tells us you’re not immortal,” Blaise continued.  He raised an eyebrow and said, “But that doesn’t tell us how old you are.”
“Calm down,” Harry said and Qye whipped his head around to stare at him in disbelief.  Harry gave him a weary look back as Smethwyck mumbled and waved a complicated figure against Harry’s chest.  “I told you he doesn’t matter - ”
The dog in front of him growled and Remus broke away from his regretful thoughts, frowning down at his friend.  He nudged him with his knee as they caught up to him, returning the dog’s baleful glower with a stern frown.
That meeting had been…strange.  Malfoy hadn’t said one word while Harry had finished up his work and even after they had traded results, he still hadn’t said anything about his lagging behind.  It had stunned the green-eyed boy for quite a few days after that.
“Harry,” Hermione said gently and he looked at her softened, worried face. “Harry, you really have to eat something. You’re sick as it is.” Harry opened his mouth but another voice spoke behind them.
He was silent, staring into the flickering flames.  The bright green eyes, wide and full of innocence even when annoyed, an innocence they hadn’t had before, flashed in his mind.  The soft look on his face, the shy and slightly hesitant manner with a firm and stubborn will beneath it, the gentle air that surrounded him…things that hadn’t been there before.
“Watch your language,” Hermione sniffed, brushing water off her own cloak.  “And it doesn’t rain all the time, just most.  And it might be because it’s almost winter when we return.”
’  After Seamus and Blaise’s questions, along with her joking manner, the class had relaxed and began firing questions at her rapidly.  One of the students that had asked the most questions had been Hermione Granger and Marylin mentally made a note of her since she was quite above average and well…the questions she asked simply couldn’t be answered.
Harry followed his bickering friends to the Great Hall where other students were already sitting at their respective tables.  Grabbing a few seats near the Head Table, Harry watched amusedly as his best friends continued to bicker on trivial tings.  The warmth of the Great Hall, the familiar sight of his friends bickering…it was enough the push away his depression for the moment.  He began to feel like he had really come home and he let out a quiet sigh, content to finally be back where he belonged.
The blonde woman sighed and stood up from her chair, smoothing out her aquamarine skirts. “We best go before my brother gets any more ideas.” She smiled and leaned over, smoothing out Harry’s hair gently. “I hope you get better, Harry. I’d like for you to be in class on Monday.”
:: Qye smirked and Harry shivered as he recognized the feeling of the other boy looking through his memories.
“Possibly better since we’re liberating them from him,” George added as he popped up on Zabini’s other side.  The dark-skinned boy uneasily shifted between the twins and warily kept his hands to himself.
“I’m fine,” he muttered, his eyes falling down to where Malfoy’s hand rested on top of his own.  He swallowed, feeling his blush deepen.  Malfoy continued to look at him, a few locks of his blond hair falling into his face.
“Of course, Headmaster,” Madam Pomfrey said, frowning and looking down at the teenagers again.  Her wand lit up with another spell as she hovered it over the boy without a scar.
“They were attacked late on Saturday night from what investigators can tell,” Dumbledore said quietly, still using his gentle voice.  “They were barely found last night by some neighbors who thought that the house was unusually quiet with their car still in the driveway.  The neighbors called the police.  The Ministry has agents in the Muggle force to keep an eye on your home and other things as well.  As soon as one of them heard the address, they took over the case and Obliviated the Muggles that knew about it.”
“I had no readings on soul or other damage, as I said the magical field seems the most affected,” Madam Pomfrey sighed.  “There was something in the blood work but…”  Her eyes darted briefly to her, to Lest.  “Very strange, both of them had fluctuations much like his magic.”  She shook her head.  “The Infirmary is hardly the best place for the boy.  Even with my experience, I have never seen anything like this and I hardly have the tools necessary to begin to guess how to treat this.  It would be best to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s - ”
“You deserve better,” Lest said, speaking almost as if to himself as his eyes continued to search Harry’s for something.  “You deserve so much.”
“I’m just making sure I’m not going to suddenly find myself on the other end of a Weasley product,” Zabini pointed out.
“You’re recommending continuing on as they are now?” a soft voice said and she turned now to Marylin Opacre, looking down at the recommendation with an unreadable expression.  “Separated?”
Harry turned around and drew back sharply when he saw the harsh look on Lest’s face, the blue eyes darkening further, narrow and cold.  The smile was gone, taking with it the gentleness of the vampire.  Harry swallowed and was unpleasantly reminded why vampires had such a negative image.
Hermione brought him biscuits and apples, pumpkin juice and tea, carefully smuggled in her bag and left on his bedside drawer.  Once dinner was over, both Hermione and Ron opted out of their routine and took their studying upstairs, Hermione primly sitting on one side of Harry, brows furrowed as she marked new notes and reviewed her outlines while Ron lay stretched out on the other side, flipping through an old magazine of Quidditch Weekly.
The shouting began.  Harry calmly turned the page in his notebook as things like “Siding with Slytherins!” and “Consequences of being lazy!” flew around him.  A little further down the table, Dean and Seamus were once again betting on who would win this argument while Neville stared at the bickering friends.
He turned around and blinked when he came face to face with an indignant Ron, who was staring at the corner Malfoy had rounded, and a bemused Hermione, who was staring at him.  He blinked again and flushed slightly.
Hermione blew out her bangs and gave him her own look.  “Don’t give me that look, I know you’re talking with him even though I still don’t know why.”
Then that world’s sound seemed to dull, overwhelmed by the other’s in which the things, the terrifying, gruesome beasts, lapped at what Harry suddenly realized in numb horror to be the remains of what had once been a man. He stared at torn, thin strings around the man and numbly realized what part of the anatomy they had been before one of the monstrosities gobbled them down greedily. The sound grew in that world, screams coming from people he couldn’t see, enabling him to hear voices.
“Alright, I think we’ve already got Ms. Brown down,” she said, checking off the name.  “Let’s continue…” She began to call out names and made a note of pinning a face by each name.  As the names continued to be checked off, she noticed something in the way the class was organized.  All the students from Slytherin House were on the left side of the room while all the students from Gryffindor House were on the right side of the room.
Draco turned back, an exasperated look in his eyes.  Before either of them could say anything, Blaise Zabini suddenly appeared next to Seamus, his eyebrows raised in curiosity.
“Look, it’s not like I tell anyone else, alright? Besides, that’s not the point,” Seamus huffed. “The point is I asked the Hufflepuffs and not a single one of them will tell me anything about the lesson today.” The panicked expression returned to his blue eyes. “What kind of lesson is it that not one of them will say anything?! How am I suppose to survive?!”
“Well,” she said, smiling slightly, “Be that as it may, I expect more participation from you in the future, Harry.”  The boy nodded and she grinned.  “Good, now off you go.  I bet all of you are tired from the first day of classes.”  She grimaced.  “I know I really am.”  This elicited another soft laugh from the boy and grins from his friends.  She made shooing motions with her hands.
Lest's even face met his, standing behind him, hand outstretched to help him up. There was no remorse, no guilt on that calm face, no tremble in the hand or tension in the body as it bent forward slightly. Harry felt his body tense because he had just
“Are you sure you’re all right, Harry?” she asked worriedly, her brown eyes searching his own eyes.  “You’ve been quiet on the entire trip.  Is something bothering you?”
“It worked with Nosle,” murmured one of the vampires.  “And there won’t be any of the Nosle Kids there this time.”
It got worse when her brother raised a cool eyebrow at the silent Weasley, his arms folded loosely across his chest.
"I used Videte for the inkpot and a brief, superficial scan for the others," he responded quietly and she nodded thoughtfully before turning back to the class.
It was long time before the other boy answered.  A few minutes had passed in which Harry had felt the other boy go through a storm of emotions, ranging from rage to frustration to hopelessness and finally to resolution.  When Qye had finally answered, all Harry had felt had been fierce determination.
Draco nodded.  “And as I said, the Venators are not officially sanctioned by any government.  They’re not even all wizards.  Yet they’ve existed for almost as long as vampires have.”  He glanced over at Harry.  “You could maybe see why Professor Opacre has been spending so much time this year attempting to educate students about vampires, trying to bypass generations of careful separation and mistrust.”
“What kind of dream?” Harry said, puzzled and beginning to feel a bit annoyed.  His confusion grew as Dean let out a sigh of relief.
“Lest?” she called out again, gingerly making her way to the nearest lamp.  As she turned it on, she nearly jumped as she saw her brother sprawled in one of the armchairs near a window, his legs crossed carelessly at the ankle while his hands were folded across his stomach.
Harry snorted, dropping his arms and pulling up the covers, unsure and hesitant and still with that twinge of worry but more free than anything.
Marylin saw, as if in a slow trance, the spell grow, saw Voldemort’s wand lift as she heard Dumbledore shout and Lest step forward all the while Harry stared defiantly back.
"A tip: the minute you think of your attack, do it and do it fast. It's the only way to win and if you ever face a vampire seriously...well, winning means living."
“I thought you said they were fine,” a quiet voice said, one Qye hadn’t heard before, and he studied the way Harry looked less weary, silently pairing the voice with the name Remus Lupin.
Marylin looked up from cleaning up the last of the makeup materials to see Lest leaning against the doorframe staring at her.
That didn’t matter much to him.  He would have been fine with everything if it were just those two.  But he was stuck with Malfoy,
“Why would I?” Qye said, flipping through the pages carelessly.  “It’s not like he had a choice or say in what happened.”  He shrugged and put the book back, looking through the shelf again.  “I mean, if you want to get technical about it, I’ve stolen his childhood years from him since what he remembers wasn’t actually real.”
“Was that your attempt at a subtle insult?” the Opacre male said coolly, not even turning around to look at him, leaving Qye slightly disappointed. But determination rose in him as his impulses made him speak once more.
“Oh…well…” he said, dimly wondering why Dumbledore was so close to him.  “Do I need to do anything?”
“I assume you’ll be accepting young Dumbledore’s request?” Verna suddenly asked.  Jordan blinked and turned around.  The Elder had finally put down her knitting and was looking at them with a calm expression on her face.
“I’m only twenty,” the young vampire said mildly, his dark, sapphire eyes looking down at Harry as a couple of bangs fell into his face.  “I rather think myself that I don’t quite deserve a ‘sir’ just yet.”  A blond eyebrow rose.  “Or are you calling me old?”
…Harry. He nearly sighed in relief as he seemed to touch something other than himself and feeling a lot like the other boy. He shuddered involuntarily as he felt it. ‘
“Why do you keep saying that?” Qye asked quietly, his voice careful and eyes slightly narrowed. Weasley shrugged, shoving his hands into the pockets of his ragged hand-me-down robes.
“Severus has been keeping tabs with his Leglimency,” Remus said, sitting back down on the couch and leaning forward with his hands clasped between his knees.  He looked down at them, trying to relax his white-knuckled grip.  “And Mr. Malfoy’s friends.”  He paused and murmured, “Draco’s Venator connections.”
“Do you want me there?” she asked as he considered employing his Videte, his fingers drumming against the table.  She wasn’t much better, restlessly toying with her silverware as their food cooled.
She allowed some sympathy to slip into her expression.  “I understand you care.  I can’t say I understand exactly what your relationship to your Carus entails.  But that’s Qye’s relationship with you, not Harry.  Harry holds no such connection towards you.  In fact, the very opposite is true with your presence presenting aversely to him, which only further affects Qye’s opinion.”
“Or maybe he’s in the tree and the reason you want to leave so anxiously is because he threw that acorn at me,” Lest cut in smoothly.
“Harry,” a voice said and Harry’s eyes shifted to Sirius, staring at him, staring at Qye.  “Merlin knows that asshole has less of a say than anybody about deciding anything for you ever again, but…” He trailed off and looked between them both again, looking lost and unsure and afraid.
“Thank Merlin that’s done with,” said Seamus, collapsing onto the table.  “That…that was utter reaming bollocks, that’s what that was.”
Without pausing to think about the consequences, he shot his hand forward, capturing the stalk between their palms as his long, ivory fingers wrapped gently around
Harry stood on the edge of the group of Dazain vampires and Death Eaters.  He struggled fruitlessly in the vampire’s hold as a wizard with a silver hand held a trembling wand on him.  His green eyes kept darting between the groups, a slight bruise on the side of his face from what must have been a blow to catch him.
“Can we cut straight to it?” Sirius said flatly, dropping his duffel bag on the floor and taking a step closer to Dumbledore, barely sparing the vampires a glance.  Remus saw Marylin shift behind the sitting vampire who he assumed must be her brother Lest.  He slowly lowered his own duffel bag out of the way and knew he did not imagine the way the man’s eyes followed him, sleepy and dangerous.  “Why are we here?  Is Harry okay?”
Something glinted in the reflection of his glasses and his green eyes blinked as he saw his wand, lying on the floor in front of him.
“That’s right, Scarhead,” Malfoy sneered.  “Tame that little rodent of yours if you know what’s good for him.”  The Slytherins snickered at this and Harry took a deep breath before he let his temper get the best of him.
Qye said quietly, when they were finally alone in the bathroom as Hermione and Ron bickered outside, waiting for him to join them to their first class after breakfast.
Sirius frowned, thinking back.  “Just if you seemed happy at the Dursleys - ”  He shifted awkwardly.  “It’s the same thing I said to you, Harry, when we first met, remember?  When I asked if you wanted to live with me - ”
“Maybe your spell malfunctioned?” Lest drawled from the wall, causing everyone to jump at his first uttered words since the examination had started.
After Professor Opacre had all but kicked them out of the classroom after Harry’s duel, the Slytherins had been – to say the least – a little irritated.  He had heard the mutters about how the Golden Boy was once again being favored and their own hadn’t been given a shot at the vampire.  Draco had also looked a little annoyed but unsurprised.  That had been normal, Slytherins annoyed with Gryffindors and they should have proceeded to make their lives miserable afterwards.
Harry said silently, grateful for the smart witch’s idea to startle the two groups before a row could start.
vampires snarled, leashes lazily held by the Dazain vampires and straining to reach the promise of fresh blood.  The red eyes glimmered cruelly above the twist of his smile.  “I assumed you would not turn away my own for a bite.”
He remembered the purpose to the potion, to examine his subconscious, and that cracking feeling before he blacked out.  He remembered the start of the term feast where he knew facts about vampires that not even Hermione knew, the tingling sensation in his mind during that first DADA class where questions were asked and he thought he knew something.
There was something indefinably wrong with this, Harry decided, as he silently watched the nurse walk away with his tray after finishing the check up. Ron and Hermione
For a long while, she stood there breathing heavily as Lest stared silently down at the floor, his cheek slowly reddening.
“I’d apologize about that,” Harry said as they passed by the Hogsmeade Post Office and skirted the edges of the main street, “but your friends are just as bad.”
“ – is a Carus Noctivagus?” he said, shooting his red-haired twin a warning look.  Jacob growled, eyes burning but Jordan was unfazed, keeping his stern look.  Jacob snorted in disgust and turned his head away, refusing to look at him.  Jordan mentally sighed.
Any trace of relaxation she had gained from her afternoon fled as she felt tension rise at the hardening look in Lest’s eyes at the name of the Malfoy heir.
“Um…I’m sure he’s around here somewhere,” the girl said nervously. She turned her brown eyes to Lest and Marylin bit back an amused smile when a small blush came onto her face.
“Oh, don’t deny it,” Seamus snapped, causing Harry to jump in surprise from the unfamiliar tone of voice.  The Irish boy was frowning slightly at the bemused boy.  “I saw you blushing when Malfoy came here and that’s a guilty sign as any!  Admit it!  You were dreaming about Malfoy!”
“We better get going to this stupid thing you cooked up with Dumbledore,” he coolly said, his back stiff.  Marylin stepped up next to him and caught his arm.
“It’s a temporary effect, after which the memory dissipates and returns to its owner unless it’s stored in a preservative container such as a pensieve,” Hermione explained.  Harry glanced up, frowning slightly.  She gave him a look back.  “It should be more than enough time for you to look them over and help you find whatever you’re looking for.  And of course we’ll be there with you - ”
Ron sat still, staring at the rain, thinking of Hermione’s worry, his mother’s anxious baking, the heavy silences.
The frozen vampire stared straight at him, shock and confusion and fury clear in his eyes, his body twitching where it hung a few feet from grabbing him.
I began "Qye" at FFN.net about a decade ago. Uploading it here now and once its all caught up to where it left off at FFN.net, I will begin to post the new finished chapters as well.  This was written with ignoring OoTp canon onwards, although I might include a few things.  Hope readers, old and new, enjoy!
As he left the passage, numbly heading for the Great Hall, he didn’t see the figures following behind him.
?”  Jordan frowned along with the rest at her.  Disliking his cousin’s actions and decisions was one thing…outright disrespect to him was another.  Jordan and his twin frowned a bit more than the others.  Their cousin and them might not necessarily be as close as some others and they also may not like his ways but they were still family and they would be damned before they let someone else mess with their family.
“Harry!” he said, alarmed and blinking as he tried to orient himself to the chaotic scene, struggling to hold on to the thrashing teenager.  “Harry, calm down!”
“Try telling that to your face,” Ron frowned as he sat down across him. “You look like you’ve been thrown around by a pair of trolls and trampled by a stampede of elephanks.”
“Back to Harry?” the teenager bit out, standing from the couch, dropping his hands to his side and fisting them.
"The little bastard needs to be pushed down a peg anyway," Lest muttered, breaking her out of her worried thoughts. She paused, then turned and stared incredulously at her brother who was now glaring at the wall across him.
Harry stared at the retreating back of the pale Slytherin, watching as he turned around the corner and disappeared from sight.
“Thanks, Professor,” the Gryffindor Chaser said.  Marylin couldn’t help but wince as the girl straightened herself and looked boldly right at Lest.  “I was wondering if maybe - ”
Jonas smiled faintly as he watched his old friend transfigure her robes back into the dark green reserved for Mind-Healers.  While they had idly chatted about her trip, he couldn’t help but feel a knot loosen in his chest as he watched her slowly settle herself into the mindset, her sharp eyes focusing and analyzing the layers behind the secrecy of the case he requested help for a week ago.  “Was it the excessive As in me writing ‘
Sirius was on some top-secret mission for Dumbledore - as usual - and any chance of getting a moment with him for the holidays was impossible.  So he was to be alone for the holidays.   Despite the fact that he knew he would be lonely, he saw this as a wonderful chance to read some more about this strange new character.  As he picked at his food, he absently wondered where 'Qye' was now. . .
:: Qye chuckled.  The amusement from the younger boy faded quickly and in a slightly anxious voice, he said, ::
he promised as he opened his eyes and stared down at the remains of the potion, the now useless container rolling on the stone floor.
“Ron, leave him alone,” he heard Hermione scold the redhead.  In a gentler tone of voice, she asked him, “Are you okay, Harry?”
A shiver ran down her spine and she wrapped her arms around herself as she slowly walked over to him.
“Did you…do something?” Harry said slowly, lifting his head.  He frowned and looked at Qye, nothing crossing Qye’s mind at all even as he saw the tentativeness in Harry’s eyes.
A fire quickly burned away the numbness and she bared her teeth at him and stood back up.   “Don’t you fucking dare Lest, don’t you dare put this on me!”
“Ron!” Hermione said, overcoming her own stunned silence, blinking rapidly as she turned to the redhead.  “Besides your obvious language, I thought you were beginning to understand the need for maturity!  You - ”
There was no witty quip from Lest as he straightened from where he had hastily moved to avoid the fire. He raised his hand in what was becoming a familiar move to shove contestants down and snatch their wand.
“I thought so,” Dean said, grabbing his own things.  He looked sympathetically at Harry.  “Just ignore Seamus, alright?  I’ll make sure he leaves you alone.”  The dark-skinned boy left the room with Harry staring at him.
“Professor!” Hermione jolted in astonishment. “What are you doing here?” Harry felt Ron shift at the end of his bed and he blinked his own confusion.
Silent for a moment, Harry thought about what Qye just said.  He remembered feeling shock from the other boy when he had met Professor Opacre.  Why hadn’t he registered it?
Every book he checked about vampires was full of things the DADA class had already proven to be false.  Books like ‘
“Fast healer, what can I say?” he mumbled, looking down at the food but not really seeing it as a worry surfaced in him. He was wondering how close to the Headmaster Harry was. He supposed it must be some, considering the events of yesterday. And surely Headmasters didn’t visit every student in the Infirmary, no matter what the circumstances. They certainly had better things to do with their time, didn’t they?
Dark green eyes moved back to him and he deliberately made sure they could see Jonas putting away his wand.
The mirth quickly vanished as did the students from their seats as they all hastily made their way to the back of the room. Harry lifted an eyebrow as Ron caught his and Hermione's sleeves and tugged them back, barely managing to grab his bag. As they moved, he saw Professor Opacre lightly flick her hands. The desks scraped lightly against the floor as they settled themselves neatly against the sides of the room, leaving an open, clear space in the middle. The first time Professor Opacre had used telekinesis in front of them - to absently bring a textbook to her - had been startling but now they were use to her doing it for simple things. It wasn't far off from using a Summoning or Banishing Charm except without a wand.
“Did you hear me?” came the soft voice again and the teenager reluctantly raised his eyes up to meet the blue eyes once more.  He was surprised to see the soft look in them gone, replaced with a cool, indifferent look.  Harry felt Qye flinch.
“ – and Pomfrey’s throwing a fit,” Weasley finished, the odd look disappearing from his face, replaced by a pained grimace.
“Better than the entire month,” Qye muttered, not noticing the sudden frowns on their faces as he looked away from them, Sirius stiffening at the implications of those words.  Before he could ask, Qye shook his head and turned his glare on Remus again.  “You still could have kept in touch.”
“Yes, you are,” Ron interrupted. Harry turned his green eyes to the other boy’s blue ones, surprised by the frustration and anger in them. The taller boy seemed to fight with himself for a moment and then he burst, “You’re pushing us away, Harry!”
“I’ll be there for them,” Black said immediately, which she had predicted from her observation.  “For Harry and…for Qye too.  Now that - ”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said.  Harry looked up at his silver eyes, soft and aching.  “I can’t apologize for my ambition because I do want things, will always want things.  But I’m sorry it took something horrible to happen for me to realize that there are ways I won’t go to achieve it, that it is not the kind of person I want to be.  And I’m sorry it happened to you.”
He snapped out of his daze and called after him, still completely bewildered.  “Hey, wait!  Available for what?”
“I’ll be sure to bring that up to the council,” the woman said cheerfully, playing with the long sleeves of her dress.  “I mean, they did want to hear about all disturbances.  Just the other day they mentioned how some visitors of the Three Broomsticks left earlier than planned when their dinner was interrupted by…well, I’ve forgotten but I know Madame Rosmerta was quite upset.  And considering how influential her voice is on the council, what with her steady and reliable income contributing to the prosperity and well-being of the village - ”
She smiled at him and he felt his hopes rise.  “It’s almost perfect,” she said, reaching up a hand and patting his head.  “I know the zipper looks a little strange but it really does look good on you and - ”
Jordan mentally groaned and fervently prayed that Mom and Dad wouldn’t find out about this while hoping that Jacob would keep his fat mouth shut.
Hermione had stopped walking the minute he had turned around and now she was looking at him, wide-eyed and pale.  Ron had also stopped, staring worriedly at him.
The teachers were dueling the Death Eaters, he saw Dumbledore’s magic clashing violently with what must have been Voldemort’s, fire and ice and lightning mixed with spells where he didn’t know where one began and another ended.
Malfoy raised his eyes again and steadily looked at him.  “When Opacre’s brother comes,” he said softly, “Stay away from him.”
“Lest, Frater, baby brother dearest,” Marylin said brightly, in the vampiric language as the Hogsmeade council drifted away from them, back to their drinks, “If you break my arm, I’m going to do terrible things to you.  Things that will make you wish for bonnets and frills.”
“Wait, what the hell did she say?!” Black demanded as Marylin gasped behind him, as Lest took after Nilsson who had whirled around and dashed back to the room.
Marylin blinked as the two teenagers pulled her arms insistently, baffled by their sudden turn of mood. She glanced at her brother, who still hadn’t turned to them. ‘
“Haven’t you noticed it?  I assumed since you’ve been here six months, you would see it.”  Lest shrugged at her confusion.  “Everyone pays attention to him, Marylin.  When I walked over to him, I noticed that everyone was watching me carefully, the Gryffindors in particular.  They weren’t  paying attention to me and Malfoy when we had the fight.  It was Harry they were looking at, all of them.  If the class is anything to go by…” The vampire frowned.  “He’s someone important here.”
“To be fair,” Dean added in with his own grin, “you have to admit this is completely bizarre.  I mean, it was already weird when Ron started - ”
Twelve of the eighty-five murdered were children on an outing with an elderly woman chaperone.  The woman had also been killed, trying to hurry the children to safety.  One blast from the wand of a Death Eater toppled a building on them.  The Aurors didn’t manage to get the Death Eater responsible.
Lest looked dazed and lost, his blue eyes tracking the witch as she murmured over the impossibility.
His flush deepened but he didn’t pull his eyes from Draco.  “You actually didn’t ask me, you know.  In fact, you rather tricked me into it.”
Malfoy must have seen his hand twitch to his wand because he shook his head and moved away from the wall. Ron felt his eyes narrow more as the Slytherin spread his hands before him.
“Do you have a better idea?” Marylin asked sarcastically.  Leon sighed and lowered his eyes, shaking his head.   “Then we stick with this.  If you do come up with a better one, share it with us.  I know this plan is almost impossible - ”
“He doesn’t appear to have amnesia,” Madam Pomfrey concluded, withdrawing her wand and turning off the light. “Nothing physical seems to be impairing him and I found no signs of trauma to his brain or anything else that may prevent him from remembering anything.”
Marylin stood up next to him as he immediately broadened his Videte and brought down one, knocked out another.  Her voice carried, loud and careful, as she spoke, “Students to their dorms.
“As I mentioned to you earlier today, Minister,” Jonas said carefully, “the fluctuations in his magic have seemed to stabilized although they are not what I would like to see in a young man of his age nor as consistent across…well, across.”  He gestured to the beds.  “There still have been no effects from any of the treatments we have administered so far.”
Jonas paused and blinked at him.  “Ah,” he said, hesitating once again.  He frowned and looked down at his chart, at the notes he had made.  “Her specialty is mind-healing, specifically with unorthodox - ”
returned doubt the safety of this castle because of the tragic incident last June.”  Harry heard a sniffle that suspiciously sounded from the Ravenclaw table but he did not turn to it, instead firmly focusing on Dumbledore and his words.  “However,” the Headmaster said quietly, still smiling, “I assure you that we are quite safe here.  I’m very much aware of the danger in the world and over the summer I have had our wards strengthened to protect each and every one of you.  I give you all my word that you are safer here than you possibly know.  You will not need to fear Voldemort so long as I am here.”
"What?" Seamus said loudly, finally coming out of his cowering and looking incredulously at her. "What does that mean? How are you - "
“Act your ages,” Jacob’s cousin snapped, his blue eyes flashing.  Saira growled again and sat back down while Jacob looked sulkily at the table.  Jordan sighed and shook his head wearily.
He said nothing as he caught up with the other teenager, meeting Draco’s strides with his own.  The blond stalked the road, his body language all but screaming.
’  He let out a long breath, reaching the bottom of the stairs.  From there he looked around the house.
“Lest said I should guide you out,” the young man said, his voice carrying a faint foreign accent as he took a step forward.  Harry stiffened as he caught the flash of fanged teeth.  “If you would - ”
Reluctantly turning his attention away from the too-silent Qye, Harry turned away from the vampire, breaking Lest’s hold on his chin.  The Gryffindor looked over his shoulder…
He continued to look at the Slytherin but the pale boy refused to acknowledge him.  Sighing, he gave the black horse one last pat, then turned to head back to his friends.
They all joked as they left the North Tower for the Great Hall, moods high as another week ended and despite the presence of O.W.L.s. looming closer.  Since the infamous week of duels against Lest in the DADA classes with many still disappointed about the results, some even taking to avoiding the male vampire, things were finally beginning to feel back to normal.  Fortunately, Lest never made a return to the classroom after the duels though he still hung around the castle, mostly seen at mealtimes or walking with his sister between classes.  Generally, though, things had returned to about the same before his arrival.
dreams?” Ron managed to choke out through his hilarity, holding onto Harry’s shoulder for support.  The laughter doubled as Harry just stared confusedly at him.
“Your right is reserved,” Marylin’s brother said dryly and the women jerked, obviously forgetting he was there.  Marylin glared slightly at her brother before turning her eyes back down.  Saira just scowled and crossed her arms.  The Head of the European vampires looked around and asked coolly, “Any more objections?”
“Just...” he struggled, trying to think of the right thing to say or do.  Now that they had stopped, he wanted nothing more than to leave them both but he couldn’t without the fear that they would tear each other apart.  He gritted his teeth and muttered, “Expelliarmus!”
Ron and Hermione stayed on through the Easter holidays and Harry struggled to find time to look more into vampires.  Even just reading Qye’s journal was difficult as most nights he was falling asleep the minute he got into bed.
Something flashed in Lest’s eyes, too quick for her to identify and he turned his eyes back to the paintings. “He’s a foolish child if he doesn’t and his friends as well if they follow him,” Lest said coldly, his stance tensing. “I imagine Malfoy has been spreading stories to them and anyone who will listen by now.”
His pleasure was short-lived, however, withering away quickly and replaced with more than a bit of worry when Lest lifted his face from avoiding the flames.
, Mr. Nott,” she said, a bit sharply, narrowing her eyes slightly.  “Unlike the other type of vampire, the
“Could you perhaps fill us in, Pater?” Leon said mildly but Jordan thought it sounded more like an order from stern father to a guilty child.
He started in surprise when he noticed the deep blush on his other best friend’s face, one that seemed to grow even more when he looked curiously at her.  Frowning slightly, he asked in a puzzled voice, “Hermione?”
“The Venators scoured the scene after the fact,” Draco growled.  “Traced the fire to an arsonist instead of the faulty wiring claimed in the report.  Interrogated the arsonist who told them she had been paid to cover the blood.  To hide the traces of another Opacre kill, in the name of winning a war.”
: Qye said amusedly.  Harry merely groaned more in response and banged his head once on the pillow before turning on his side and curling up.
Marylin jerked when Lest whirled around and caught the nut barely an inch away from his face. Ron and Hermione gaped.
“Still…” the figure laughed softly, raising his hands to his hood.  The black hood fell backwards and for a moment Vernon just stared blankly at the pale face, the dirty blond hair that surrounded it, and the dark, cold blue eyes.
The green-eyed boy blinked in surprise at the slender, pale hand wrapped around his tanned one, capturing the stalk between the palms of their hands.
Harry batted him away, rolling his eyes as he climbed out of the bed.  “I’m not invalid, knock it off.”
Anger and pain and betrayal and grief kept pouring into his head and Harry started breathing heavily, gritting his teeth as he forced his body to move, to push himself up and stand because more overwhelmingly of all, he could feel the fear.
Qye shuddered and turned on his side, curling up into a ball. Something had been holding Harry back, he had felt it for the barest of moments. He shivered, remembering the cold, empty feeling.
He turned to her, face pale.  “Exactly what do you mean?”  His eyes narrowed swiftly.  “No subconscious potions,” he practically growled.
Shoving his hands in the pockets of the vest, he moved silently through the rows, trying not to show how eager he was.  The fumes of the potions swirled around him but they did not matter as he breathed in deep.  He could still smell
"What?" he asked, blinking, laying down his fork.  Hermione rolled her eyes and let out a long, suffering sigh.
“Draco, I know you’ve been given permission to stay by your mother and your…friends,” the woman said carefully.  “But we need to be able to talk without the need that you two have to be supervised at all times - ”
“Well, I better go now,” she said, glancing at her watch.  “I have a staff meeting to get to.”  She looked back at them and smiled again.  “I’ll see you all in class so take care of yourselves until then.”  She patted Harry on the head and waved to Ron and Hermione before turning and walking away.
. The small textbook he had thrown at Ron in the beginning - lying innocently just a little way from Ron's feet - shot up and hit the redhead in the back of the knee of the leg that had just shifted back.
