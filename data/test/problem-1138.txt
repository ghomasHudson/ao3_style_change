“Oh, Harry.”  Molly sat, gripping the frame in her hands, eyes wide as she took in the photo.  “Thank you.”  Arthur looked up at Harry with wide, watery eyes and a sad smile.
Draco moved so that he was kneeling on the bed.  He couldn’t resist leaning over and softly kissing Harry’s temple.  He then moved and placed a soft kiss on his cheek.  He placed another on the corner of his mouth.  This caused Harry to move again, and Draco watched as two emerald orbs slowly blinked open.
The rest of the evening was spent talking, snacking on the many leftovers, and with Harry giving tours of the house.  Harry could tell that Professor McGonagall was impressed with all that he had done.  He was pleased that he could show her all that he had learned.
I swear, I wrote and re-wrote this chapter at LEAST 6 times!  So many different things that I wanted this chapter to include, and I think I finally got it all in there!  Hope you like it!
“I do, forever and always,” he grinned, tears streaming down his face as he stared deep into Draco’s eyes.
After a moment of awkward silence, Ron said, “Well, this will definitely be an experience, won’t it?”
True to his word, Harry didn’t get out of bed that Friday except to get food and use the loo.  He and Draco continued their celebration of their engagement and of Draco’s moving in for most of the day.
Harry grinned around the cock in his mouth, and gently pushed his finger in, which was all it took for Draco to scream and start coming, causing Harry to take his cock fully into his mouth so as to not spill any.  He swallowed it all, and once Draco was spent, Harry released him.  He gripped his own cock, and with just four strokes, he was coming into his hand.
Draco made his way up to Harry’s room.  As he opened the door and saw Harry sprawled on the bed, he found that he wished that his mother and the headmistress were not, indeed, downstairs, and that he could instead just crawl into bed with Harry.  Draco closed the door behind him with a sigh.
He had gotten to the other corner and was preparing to slice it from the edges of the wall with his wand, when he felt a presence beside him.  Glancing up, he saw the look of determination in Draco’s eyes.  “What?  I may be a pretty face, but if you can be a strong man and do hard labour, then so can I.”
“Both you and Mr Malfoy are very talented wizards.  It is hard to say exactly what happened, but it’s possible that while your magic was inserting itself into his wand, his magic was transferring through you into your wand.  We may never know the  precise magic that occurred.  Understand?”
Harry had gone up to his room to put his things away, and then slowly made his way down stairs, stopping in front of one of the bedrooms on the second floor.  He opened the door, and looking around, got an idea.  He
Harry went over and added Hermione’s present under the tree.  He showed Ron the recliner, which sat in the corner beside the couch under the windows.  Ron gladly hopped into it, threw the leg rest up, and sighed.
Harry twisted and carefully pushed Draco off of the couch and onto the floor, so that he was now on top of Draco.  He left open mouthed kisses across Draco’s cheeks and chin, until he was able to close upon his lips again.  When Draco pushed his tongue into Harry’s mouth, Harry reached down in between their bodies and grabbed Draco’s hard, thick cock.
Attaching his lips back on Draco’s, Harry continued to thrust up against him.  Draco’s hands were locked in Harry’s hair, pulling his mouth forcibly against Draco’s.
Harry had felt overwhelmed just glancing at it, and while they hadn’t really discussed it, he knew Draco felt the same way.  He was hoping that they could actually talk to the women, tonight.
“I’m going to make you forget your name, baby.”  He leaned over and kissed Draco, open-mouthed and wet, before he crawled back onto the bed and settled between his knees, which were bent and spread wide.  He caressed his fingers up the inside of Draco’s thighs, and back down the outside, over and over, getting closer to Draco’s core with each pass, which caused Draco to whimper and his cock to twitch.
“Thank Salazar,” Blaise said.  “It’s about damn time you two got your act together.”  He moved past the girls to help Ron gather the champagne.  “Now, seriously, there’s only a few minutes until midnight, and our dear host is supposed to say a few words to his guests.”
Harry sighed.  “Well, can you at least tell me how we are going to get there?  It’s not like we can walk out the front door, looking this this.”  He gestured to himself.  “Reporters have been staked outside for weeks now.”
He wrapped he legs around Harry’s waist, pulling his hips toward him, causing Harry to graze against his prostate.
Harry felt lighter than air as he lead the group of his friends up the stairs.  Draco had come back,
Draco looked confused for a moment before he said, “You mean you haven't seen the house since he has been working on it?”
It started off slow, but then Draco’s tongue swiped against Harry’s bottom lip, causing him to gasp.  He took advantage of that and deepened the kiss.  Harry honestly didn’t know how long they stood there snogging in the middle of his living room, with all of their friends surrounding them; he just knew that he wanted to be able to do that for the rest of time.
“Well, normally, we would have had a stag party or something, to celebrate the end of being single.”
“Do you trust me?” Draco nodded.  “Then close your eyes.  You are definitely going to be glad you did.”
“And so we don’t want it to be the two of you behind me, and then the two of you behind Draco.  We want it to be all four of you surrounding us.”
Their memories were still coming back, but they had bought a new home and were learning new things about their lives before the war on a now daily basis.  Harry was so glad that Hermione had introduced Ron to them, and they were getting to know their (probable) future son-in-law.
large photos that were on the front page of the paper, and said, “Well, fork.”  One was of him and Harry, swinging Teddy between their clasped hands, opposite hands full of bags and packages standing in line for skates.  Another was of them sitting at a table, talking with Ron and Hermione.  The third was the photo the man had taken while they stood on the edge of the rink.  Harry had Draco’s hand in his, pulling it up to kiss, loving smile on his face.
The noise picked back up as everyone started their conversations again, but Harry, Blaise, and Draco still stood in the corner.
Draco’s breath once again caught in his throat.  He could feel the tears forming in his eyes.  His heart was pounding in his chest, and his stomach was clenched.
Harry reaches between them, lightly grasping his length.  Draco thrust his tongue into Harry’s mouth as he thrust his cock into his hole, causing Harry to squeeze himself.
Harry rinsed out his mouth and turned so he was facing Draco.  “Yes, I’m beginning to.  I wish… Godric, I’m so sorry.” His chin hit his chest.
“I’ll be here, whenever she wants to come over.  But, if she’s not going to come over until after 10, I might just have a   lie-in.”
“Most likely.  And now it seems like we’re going to have to wait longer for that to happen than we had originally planned.”  Harry sighed, rubbing Draco’s back.  They sat there a moment, letting the adrenaline subside.  “Well, I guess we’ll just have to floo to work.”  He glanced down at his watch.  “Come on, let’s go.”
“Yeah!  Nan and I were shopping, and we saw these hooks that looked like dragons, and I thought she would like them ‘cause they would remind her of Uncle Charlie!”
That Thursday, glasses were poured and passed around to everyone.  Ginny and Luna had joined them, too.  Before long, everyone was getting tipsy, and tongues were loosened.  Harry was sitting there, talking with Hannah, when he heard a voice rising above the others.
The woman gave a start as she finally recognized his face.  Harry tried to stop the grimace that was begging to appear on his face as he saw the recognition, but was able to keep it at bay.
After thanking the man, Harry and Draco left and walked around the building.  “How exactly are we going to ‘pick it up’ when we don’t have anything to put them in?” Harry asked, concernedly.
“Oh!  Yes, waste of time.  Uh huh.  Sounds goo-ahhh!”  Draco moaned as Harry quickly unbuttoned his shirt, throwing it open as he began kissing down Draco’s pale chest.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, watching Harry pull on his uniform.  Harry clipped his cloak on, turning to look at Draco.
After a few moments, he looked back up at his friends and said, “Thanks for listening to me.  I don’t know what I would do without you two.”
Staring into blackness, Harry felt his best friends take his hands, and then Hermione asked if they were ready.  He took a breath and nodded, and then they were squeezed through space, landing with a crack somewhere much colder.
“The Ferret and I were just discussing our lots in life, is all.  Everything is fine.” Ron gave a small smile.
The next morning, they woke up and called for room service.  They took their time in eating, enjoying the immense pancakes that they had ordered.
Harry was completely confused.  What in the hell was going on?  He desperately wanted to follow Draco downstairs so that he could get some answers, but he stayed sitting up in his bed, waiting on the blond to get back.
“You mean…” Harry looked over at Draco, who just nodded, before turning back to her.  “You’re going to be doing the ceremony?”
“Is that so? Well, maybe next time he would deem it pertinent to inform the Headmistress," she said with a huff.  "As it is, I'll bid you a good time.  See you on Sunday.”  Nodding to each, she turned and sternly made her way towards her office.
Harry glanced up at the staff table, and saw Professor McGonagall looking at them.  She gave a slight nod of the head.
“Actually, I’m really excited.  I’ve always wanted to be able to host a party, and now that I’ve got a place that I can do it in, I can’t wait.”
Harry pushed Draco’s back farther into the wall, as he rammed his manhood against Draco’s over and over.
Draco was the first to finally break the ice.  “Why do I feel like we had a huge fight, and we’re both walking around trying not to disturb the other?  That’s not what happened.”
“Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  I am just trying to ‘turn over a new leaf,’ so to speak.  I don’t want to fight.”
As they made it down to the first landing, the saw an anxious and excited Teddy tapping his foot; where he learned that, they could only imagine.
Harry and Draco looked at each other and started laughing.  Draco came over and ruffled his hair, which was turning half black and half platinum blond.  "You can call me whatever you want to, okay kiddo?"
Harry glanced over at Draco, slight blush on his cheeks and busily stuffing his mouth with food.  Glancing back up at the owl sitting in front of him, he said, “Orion, huh?  Does that sound okay to you?  Orion?”  He pet the bird’s head, and received a peck on his finger.  “Okay, Orion it is.”
“Where in Merlin’s name did you get that?”  Harry had walked up to him, and gently caressed the ‘nose’ of the reindeer, causing Draco to shudder.
Draco looked around the room, not looking at Harry.  He spoke to the wall, saying.  “I can’t do this.”
Harry smirked as he slid back down the bed, pulling Draco down with him to lay face to face.  “And me?”
Draco shook his head.  “Not a thing.  The market is in the capable hands of Pansy today and tomorrow.”
Harry gripped Draco’s hips, helping lift him up and down.  He slid one hand up Draco’s torso, tweaking one of his nipples.  Draco moaned at the feeling, causing his still half-hard cock to fill completely.
“So. Now, what? We only have the rest of today and tomorrow before we have to go back to Hogwarts, and I’d like to take my boyfriend on an actual date! What do you say?”
“I was not expecting that, not that I’m complaining,” Harry said, placing one more chaste kiss on Draco’s lips.
The trio walked down the steps and into the carriage that was waiting for them.  When they reached the entrance, they got out and walked through the iron gate.
Everyone had been enjoying the enormous meal, chatting with their seat partners.  Harry looked around at the table, taking in everyone that had come.  The Weasley’s and their significant others filled in the majority of the table, with Arthur, Molly, Bill, Fleur, Charlie, Percy, George, Angelina, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville.  Neville’s gran had come too, as well as Andromeda, Teddy, and McGonagall.
“It doesn’t matter.  All you need to know is that we were, and now we aren’t.  No one else needs to know it ever happened.”
Draco couldn’t read Harry’s face as they looked at each other, but his heart leapt when Harry turned his head and said, “He is here as my guest.”
Harry stood, stretching and popping his back, sighing in relief.  He motioned for Hermione to go on as he made his way up to his room and the en suite.  His clothes were lain out on the bed, and Harry smiled at how much Hermione was taking care of him.
As they walked in, Harry noticed that Kreacher had decorated in there, as well, including a mini Christmas tree.
Neville smiled back, opening his package to find a sweater that was black, with an emerald N on the front.  Both Gryffindors quickly put their sweaters on, grinning.
Draco rubbed his face, causing strands of his pristine hair to fall into his eyes.  Tossing the hair away, he looked up at Harry.  “I’m sorry.”
gorgeous husband.”  They smiled at each other, leaning in for another kiss before turning to watch Teddy open his gifts.
“Baby, breathe.  I’ve got everything we need, and then some.  I promise.  This vacation is supposed to be relaxing and an opportunity for us to spend time together.  No stress.  Say it.”
Harry wrapped an arm around him.  “We’ll discuss this later, alright?  Let’s just get you home, okay?”
Harry felt as though his insides were coming undone.   He didn’t want to even think of how many lives were lost because of him.  He was the cause of all of this, and suddenly he couldn’t stand up any longer.  He moved so he could sit in a chair, but before he could actually press himself into it, Ron and Hermione were beside him, holding him up.
He pulled back, leaning their foreheads together.  “You’re not so bad yourself,” Draco whispered back.
They squeezed into the cubicle, and Harry watched as Professor McGonagall dialed the numbers on the telephone, they all spoke their names, took the proffered name tags, and then the lift started down.  He gripped Draco’s hand, as he re-lived his previous trip down towards the ministry.
“And, I’m even more glad that I could call you my boyfriend, if even for just a couple weeks.  When you kissed me back…I felt like I was flying higher than I could ever get on a broom.  I felt as if I had finally found my place in this world.  But, I don’t want to be the only one in this.”
As Harry tried to tell Draco, limp in his arms, that he did indeed love him, he was suddenly in the Room of Requirement, Fiendfyre flames all around him.  Turning quickly around, he started running up and down the aisles, avoiding flames and screaming from Ron, Hermione, and Draco.  He knew he had to find the others, get them all out of there.  As he rounded a corner, his eyes let upon Draco who was climbing up the side of a mountain of furniture, trying to get away from the flames.  Harry knew he needed to get to him, to save him, but when he turned away to find the broom that he had ridden before, he heard a terrible scream.  Turning back, he saw, as if in slow-motion, Draco tumble down, calling out for Harry.  Just as he was about to hit the flames, Harry had woken up.
Harry smiled as she dried her eyes, and then was pulled into another hug before she turned and went back to hug Draco, looking at the ring.  The rest of the gathered group formed a line to wish congratulations on the couple.
He jumped out of bed, slamming his glasses onto his face and grabbing his wand. As he pulled his bedroom door open, the banging got louder and now he heard voices. Curiousity and alarm assaulted him and he raced down the stairs, wand pointed in front of him.
Ginny and Neville had their heads together, whispering, and after a few moments they parted, Neville addressing the group.
Ron and Hermione shared a quick look, but just nodded and walked up to the sitting room, Harry and Draco following.
“Hmmm, that does sound good,” Dean said with a chuckle.  Seamus nudged him in the ribs, causing their friends to laugh.
They were standing in the middle of the kitchen, unloading their pockets of their shopping, unshrinking the packages and appliances.  The large appliances had easily been magicked into their correct spots.  Harry was pleased to see that the kitchen was already starting to come together.
Once everyone had food in front of them, he continued.  “As I was saying, it could then only be some kind of wand-related aid.”
Narcissa then glanced at the clock on the wall.  Draco followed her gaze, and saw that it was nearly 10:00, already.
“Teds, please tell me you are not eating your chocolate, already,” Harry asked as he saw him munching on something.
The storefront was decorated for the holidays, with greenery wrapped around the windows and the front door, and as they stepped up to it, Harry saw that it wasn’t just a clothing store; they also sold fine jewelry.
“I don’t know.  My hand suddenly felt like it was being burned, but I couldn’t let go of the wand, no matter how much I tried.  What did it feel like to you?”
Draco turned back to look at his mother, who gave him a watery smile.  He returned it, turning back to Harry, who had been looking at Molly, who was wiping her eyes.
“As I said, this is all very interesting.  I will see you on Monday, then.”  She nodded, turned, and disappeared in a flash of green flames.
Once Teddy was put to bed, it wasn’t long before Narcissa and Andromeda both made their leave, and Harry and Draco moved to their suite, lighting the fire.
Harry sighed, turning back around and pulling Draco’s hands around his stomach.  He caressed Draco’s legs lightly.  They lay there for several more minutes, both in their own heads.
“Well, today is the 8th.  Do you think you can get work settled and get packed by Wednesday?  I was thinking of scheduling a portkey for Wednesday after work?  And come home on the 22nd, giving us a day to recuperate and unpack, before the Christmas Craziness begins.  What do you think?”
Draco hadn’t even noticed until Harry said something.  Where the three windows had been once before, a bay window was in their place, with a beautiful bench the same colour as the floor.  It overlooked the front of the house, and upon further inspection, Draco could see the park across the street with people milling around.  “It’s beautiful.  I like the floor, too.  What colour are you going to paint?”
“What are we doing here? The sooner we find out, the sooner you can get back to bed,” Blaise said with a wink.
Harry couldn't help the laugh that emitted from his lungs.  “You hardly said anything the whole night! How could you be tired?”
“Oh, baby.  I’m sorry.  But, I’m home now, and won’t be going anywhere for a while.”  He leaned in for a deep kiss.
“Thank you,” he whispered as he finally kissed Harry’s mouth.  Harry arched up into the kiss.  He pushed his tongue into Draco’s mouth, doing a dance with Draco’s for dominance.  After kissing languidly for many minutes, Draco pulled back.
Harry smiled.  “They won’t work around the house, but maybe we can decorate the outside of the shed!”
“He should be set.  He knows the way and will take you around the trail.  If you wish to stop and get off at any point, just say ‘sluta’ for stop and ‘gå’ for go.  He’ll do the rest.”
Flitwick’s wand waving around the room brought Harry back to the present.  “I am giving each of you a feather.  Please practice levitation, summoning, engorgement, and shrinking spells, silently and wandlessly.  You may begin.”
Stepping out, he quickly took in the empty room.  He walked towards the kitchen, where he heard voices.
“Merry Christmas, Harry!”  Hermione got up from her spot on the floor, coming over to give Harry a hug.  “When did you do this room?  How did I not notice the other day?  It’s great!”
When Harry pulled back from Draco’s lips, Draco tried to follow him.  However, when Harry grabbed the hem of the sweater that Draco had on, the man understood what he was trying to do, and leaned up so that the clothing could be taken off.  Once Draco was relieved of the shirt, he grabbed Harry’s, and ripped it off, too, tossing it over the back of the couch.
“When you, Granger, and Weasley showed up at the Manor in April, I couldn’t believe that you were stupid enough to get caught.  I wanted you to win.  Hell, I was counting on you to win.  Even if that meant that I spent the rest of my days in Azkaban, at least the Dark Lord would no longer be.  That is why I didn’t tell my aunt that it was you.
“Sounds like the perfect plan, to me,” Harry said with a smile.  “Come on, we should probably get some sleep.  We all know Teddy won’t let us have a lie-in.”  He crawled into the large bed, pulling Draco into his arms.  “Goodnight, love.”
“Oh, Harry!  I’m so sorry we’ve taken over your sitting room!”  Andromeda jumped up as the two men walked into the room.
Draco smirked as he looked down and saw the bulge growing in Harry’s pants.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said with an innocent look on his face.
The four of them pulled on their coats (Draco transfiguring his cloak into a muggle coat) and walked down to the restaurant.
“I’m fine.  Besides, it’ll make me drowsy, and I’m not—” He winced again as another shot of pain moved swiftly through him.
After lunch, Harry went back up to the Common Room, and wrote a letter to Andromeda.  He had yet to tell her that he would have weekends off, and so would be able to come visit Teddy more often than he thought.  Finishing his letter, he decided to go out to the owlery and have Orion take it.
“Found it!”  Harry smirked, pecking a kiss on the inside of Draco’s thigh, before pulling his fingers out and pushing Draco’s knees back against his chest.  “I was going to use the toy, but I need to feel you, okay?”
Hermione was supposed to be coming over in a few minutes to go shopping, so he forced himself to put the blond and his flagging cock in the back of his mind and went to take a quick shower and get dressed.
“That’s easy.”  Harry discreetly shifted his wand down his sleeve and cast a spell to keep the bike upright.  “We just have to make sure that one of us is holding onto it the entire time, so it looks like we’re keeping it upright.”
“I would think not,” Draco said, removing his shoes and curling up on the bed with Harry, who grabbed the remote and turned on the television.
He jumped into the room, quickly casting an expelliarmus, a silencio, and an incarcerous charm at the person, before walking over to turn the person over onto their back, from where they tripped and fell.  His heart was racing incredibly fast as he pressed his foot into their shoulder, wand pointed at their nose, several seconds passing before he realised it was Ron he was staring at.
Hermione walked up to him and gave him a side hug, looking down at her Headmaster.  “Goodbye, Professor,” she whispered.
“Then, the Battle happened.  The Room of Requirement happened.  Yes, you were still a bastard, but looking back, I understand a bit more why you did what you did.  I wish I could change what transpired that night, but I suppose if things were different, we wouldn’t be here, now.”
“You don’t think she suspects anything, do you?”  Draco looked over at Harry as soon as they arrived back into the sitting room.
“Well, I’m glad that it could happen because I’m daft and forgetful.”  Harry grinned, causing Draco to chuckle.
“Trust me, I have no idea.  I didn’t know what to think when he first apologized to me.  When I followed him into the dorm, and I saw his face, I knew that he meant it.  Just the fact that I was the first one that he said sorry to, made me realise that I should give him a chance.
“It appears that you and Mr Malfoy have a connection.  Without looking at the wand itself, I am not positive as to what extent it is.  However, it appears, from what you have told me happened, that the two of you are linked.  Bonded, if you will.  This means that yes, you can still use his wand completely, but this also means that he can use your wand completely.
“I see.  Well, in that case, I don’t see why we need to go any further with this.  We will take a short break, while the Wizengamot decides sentencing.”  He then banged his gavel.
He carefully led Harry out into the hall and down the stairs until they were standing in front of where the portrait used to hang. He swiftly took the blindfold off, and stood back as Harry blinked a few times and took in the doorway.
He turned his head and caught the eye of a tall Barn owl.  He walked towards it, and it rustled its feathers.  As he came up to its perch, the owl lifted its right leg, almost as if to shake his hand.
If you’ve stuck around, and commented on this, I APPRECIATE YOU!  I suck at responding, and honestly don’t know what to say in response, but know that I read them, and die of happiness with each positive comment!
Draco gasped softly before quickly nodding his head, pulse picking up.  Harry pulled him closer, releasing his arm to cup his cheek.  “I’m glad you’re here,” Harry said before leaning in and pressing a kiss to his lips.
“No, this has to do with you, too, but not in the way that you think.  As I said, I’ve been seeing a mind healer two times a week, for the past few months.  That’s where I go in the evenings.  Well, two nights.  I… I have also been taking a class.  A… er… a glass blowing class.  It helps take my mind off of everything.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat; he hadn’t heard a term of endearment come from Harry in months.
He carried it over to his bed, gently placing it on top of the comforter.  He unwrapped the string and paper that was covering it, taking his time to set the many pieces across his bed.  He looked down at them and smiled.
Crawling into bed, he put his wand on the table beside the bed, and waving his hand, turned off all the lights.  He curled up under the duvet, and with more thoughts of Draco floating through his head, he fell asleep.
“Alright, I’m going.  Thank you so much for doing this, Harry.  I don’t know what we’d do without you.”
Harry gave Draco another kiss, and then started out the door.  “Oh, one more thing.  Who are we telling first?  Your parents?”
“How do you do that?”  Draco’s breath tickled Harry’s neck as the question was whispered close to his ear.
They made their way into the room.  Harry picked up his bag that he had packed the night before, shrinking it and putting it in his pocket.
She greeted him with a kiss, and then swept off to pull something from the oven.  Hermione made him a drink, and then ushered him back into the hallway.  “Shall I get Ron, now, or do you want to wait until after dinner?” she asked quietly.
“You’ve done absolutely nothing wrong,” he repeated.  “Let’s just go to sleep, alright? We can talk in the morning.”
At that moment, he heard a rustle behind him, and noticed as his owl flew in through the open window.
Harry dropped down onto the cot as he repeated all that Draco had told him.  When he finished, he looked up at his friends.
“I bought that a while back, and thought maybe we’d put that up for Teddy, since he’s so ornery, like his godfather, but then, I thought I’d do something different with it for his godfather.”  He gave Harry a smirk.
Harry smiled as he threw back the blanket.  “Fine, joggers, cocoa and presents, here we come.”  He walked over to the chest of drawers, shucking his pyjama pants off, and slipping his comfortable grey joggers onto his legs.  “Happy?”  He turned around to where Draco stood, throwing his arms out.
“I am hoping that if you all can get along with each other, then the younger students will feel more comfortable.  I appreciate all of your help with this.”
He thought of all the good-looking blokes at Hogwarts, and wondered how many were gay.  As he tugged harder on his cock, his mind kept wandering back to seeing Malfoy in Diagon Alley the other day.  Harry would deny it to his dying day, but Malfoy was gorgeous.  He remembered his disheveled blond hair, his shirt unbuttoned at the top, with just a peek of the porcelain skin underneath.  He could imagine ripping the shirt off, touching his chest, flicking his nipples with his tongue.
They were pulled through space and landed in the middle of a snow filled street, beautiful buildings on one side and a small park on the other.
Draco was nodding and looking around the hallway as Harry finished talking.  “I’ll write her tomorrow.  She has a few pieces, but if nothing, she might be able to help move them on.”
Harry came with a shout, spurt upon spurt of Come pooling onto his stomach and Draco’s chest.  The tightness of Harry’s hole was too much, and have just two more thrusts, Draco came too.
Draco felt Harry’s finger slide over his perineum, and his breath caught in his throat as a finger flicked over his hole.  That was all it took for him to start coming down Harry’s throat.  Harry drank it all, keeping him in his mouth until Draco moaned again.
“Arthur is sending things through, so if you can catch them and send them down, that would be wonderful.”
“That’s an even easier problem to solve.”  She saw the even more confused look on Harry’s face, and huffed.  “Elope.”
They ordered food, and once it arrived, they watched a movie and ate their food.  Setting their plates aside, Draco curled himself into Harry’s arms, relishing in the feeling of love and contentment.
“This one,” Draco said, handing Harry a roll of green paper with gold ‘Merry Christmas’s’ across it.
He fell into his recliner, pulling the blanket around him, turned on the Telly, and began eating his breakfast.
Harry placed a small smile on his face, beginning to walk down the alley.  Without fail, every third person they came across called out to them, some coming up to shake their hands.  By the time they had gotten to Weasley Wheezes, Harry was just about ready to call the trip off and go home.  A reporter and a camera man had stopped them, taking several pictures and asking multiple questions.  Harry was already mentally preparing himself for the ridiculous (no doubt front page) article that would be in tomorrow’s Prophet.
Teddy took his hand and they started for the fireplace, but then he turned back and raced to give his nan a hug.  “Bye nana!  I love you!”
Draco sat his chin the back of his hand on Harry’s chest and reached up with his other to caress Harry’s cheek, rubbing his thumb over his dimple.  “Oh, love, I wish you had just told me.  I don’t know what, or how, but I could have done something.”
Draco gave him a surprised look, but nodded his head, and turned out into the corridor.  The men made their way out of the castle, and started towards the Black Lake.  As they passed a large stone in the ground, Draco turned his head and looked at Harry.
“Biscuits?  Sausages?  Butter?  The possibilities are endless!  It’s better than whatever this…thing is.”  He pointed towards the muggle toaster that Harry decided to pick up as they were leaving the first store.
Harry hitched his legs up more, taking a breath as Draco breached him.  He had to agree; he preferred to be on top, but every now and then, he liked to feel Draco in him.
Harry replaced the bowl and then leaned against the side of the fireplace, his mind whirring.  Godric, he had it bad for that man.  Willing his newly awakened erection to go away, he left the room, and made his way back up to his room.
Harry shrugged, looking down at his lap. “I don’t know, I know that the one of you with Crabbe and Goyle can’t be a happy thought.”
He went up to his room, deciding to change his clothes.  It was still fairly early, so Harry pulled his book bag onto his bed and decided that in the quiet of his room, he should finish his Potions essay that was due the next day.
“Thank you,” he whispered, peppering Harry’s face with kisses.  “It’s perfect.  As are you.  I love you so much, and cannot wait to be Mr Potter.”
“Well, there is a crowd of reporters in the great hall, wondering where you have been hiding since…the event.”
All of these thoughts about sex and orgasms made Harry’s cock stir.  Glancing down at his rod, he saw that he was nearly completely hard.  He gripped his member, hissing as the heat of his hand wrapped around it.  His mind instantly went back to the look that adorned Draco’s face as he was about to come.
“He cast a charm on both of our wands, sifting through the spells that had been cast on that evening.  I honestly have no idea how he narrowed it down to that specific time, but he and McGonagall seemed to understand it.  Ollivander wrote a statement of his own, which McGonagall says we can use when we have to testify at the trial.”
“I rearranged my lunch so I could come talk to you! Bev gave me a brilliant idea!”  He rushes up the steps taking Draco’s hands in his.  “Let’s get married!”
They leant their heads together, breathing each other’s breaths.  They sat there quietly, holding each other.  Finally, Draco pulled back and sighed.
The embarrassment Harry was experiencing was causing him to feel nauseous, but he was already through the worst, so he soldiered on.
Understanding dawned on Draco’s face as he heard their voices, along with Ginny’s, flow into the room. Moments later, the three of them and Neville stepped into the room.
It was as if a light bulb went off.  Harry’s eyes widened as he rolled the idea around in his head.  “Elope.  Huh.  Why didn’t we think of that?”
Harry chuckled, turning to lay his chin on Draco’s chest.  “We can have pancakes for every meal, if that’s what you want.  This vacation is for you, love.”
“No, you need to be there.  Who knows what kind of trouble those new cadets can cause in one day.  You stay there, I’ll go home, and I’ll see you this evening, okay?  I love you.”
“Yeah.  I did nearly all the cooking when I was living with my relatives.  I am trying to learn some new recipes, but it is kind of hard when you’re only cooking for one.  Anyway, there is this amazing Indian restaurant down the street.  Does that sound okay?”  Seeing the look of pure confusion, Harry started laughing.  “Sorry, I forgot who I was talking to.  How about this; are your taste buds up for a culinary adventure?”
Teddy was bouncing on his heels by the time they got to the front of the queue and gave their shoe sizes.  The young girl working told the adults how to put them on, and then moved on to the next person in line.
“I got you your favourite,” Harry said as he pushed a container with Shrimp Scampi across the table.  “I put a warming charm on it, so it should stay the perfect temperature until the last bite.”
Harry sat stunned a moment, trying to process what Draco had told him.  Suddenly, the first part of the conversation came to the fore-front of his mind.
Gingerly, he lifted his hand up and held it out to the blond.  Draco clasped it in his own, gently rubbing the ‘
Anger and sadness flooded Harry’s senses, but for now, anger won out.  “So what, you’re just going to treat me like a cheap whore, and then run away?  Was that why you crawled into my bed in the middle of the night, so you could seduce me, get what you came for, and then leave?  You’re right, I don’t know who you are, because the Draco that I know would
Harry nodded, removing his hand and walked over to where the women stood, searching out one face.  He stuck out his hand at Parkinson, saying “Truce?”
“When I received Draco’s letter a few days ago, asking if it would be possible for me to marry them, here at Hogwarts, I was beyond thrilled.  But, as I read more, I realized what it was they were doing.  I apologize if I overstepped my boundaries, but I immediately wrote to Hermione, and we started hatching a plan.
years.  A one Harry Potter had not made an appearance since he had left early that morning.  He was severely miffed about Harry being a no-show.
“Are you going to take a shower?”  Draco had a towel wrapped around his waist, and another one he was using to dry his hair.
A kind looking older gentleman appeared through a door.  “May I he— Ah!  Mr Weasley!  Perfect timing!  I was just cleaning the finished product and getting ready to put it in the box.  Would you care to look at it, before I do?”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to disturb.  Just wanted to send this letter,” Harry said, looking around for Orion.
Upon landing, they learned that it was much colder and snowier in Wiltshire.  The gates had two large wreaths on it, and everything was coated in snow.  It was beautiful, Harry thought, as he raised his wand, and the gates opened.
Harry’s eyes roved around the room and then landed towards the front, where normally the house tables would be.  Instead, though, there are several rows of benches, filled with their families and friends, all turned around, watching them enter the room.
“Sure, that’s fine with me, but you are the one that has to floo mother, Molly, and Hermione and let them know we won’t be back for Christmas.  Oh, and Teddy, too.”  Draco looked over at Harry with a smirk.
The walls were all decorated, as well as every surface.  There were fairy lights gently hanging in the air, and on the tables there were candles and holly spread over them.
Harry moved off to the side, and pulled Draco into his arms, sighing.  He pulled the sheets up and over them.  He could feel his limbs soften into contentment, and felt his eyes starting to droop.
Harry stopped, but have him a look.  “Is that supposed to be a threat?  Do you really think I’d rather be there than here with you, naked, in our bed?  Really?  I thought you knew me better than that!”
“Yeah.  They started ‘hanging out’ during the summer.  They’d been friends in school, you know.  But, one day in June, she just showed up at the house.  She was the only one that was allowed in George’s room.  They talked for what seemed hours, and then the next thing we knew, George was finally coming down for meals.  He was smiling a bit, too.”
So, since I suck so much at this, I am going to try and double up on some of the photo prompts, to try and get through this a little quicker.
Intrigued, he opened the door for Bev, and stepped in quickly behind her.  He removed the glamours from their faces, and turned to take in the shop.  Part of the area had racks of clothing, with stacks of beautiful scarves, cloaks, hats, and other accessories.
“Great!  Ok, meet you in the Leaky.”  Ginny’s head disappeared, and Harry took a handful of powder and stepped into the fireplace.
“Let’s go upstairs.” Hermione led them up to Ron’s old room.  Draco took a swig of his drink, as he sat down in the rocking chair that was put up there when Hermione was pregnant with Rose.
“Truly, we are so grateful that you did this.  I had wanted to tell everyone, especially my mother, but knew that it would be better if it was just us.  But, this makes my heart so happy.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, and thank you for letting us come here, and performing the ceremony.  I don’t know how we will ever repay you.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but as soon as he turned back around, Harry could see his shoulders shuddering, clear indication that he was laughing.  He took Draco’s hand, nudging his shoulder, and they went down to the study together, where they had put all of the gifts.
Harry smirked and still looking at Draco, flicked his wrist.  He knew he had succeeded by the wide-eyed look Draco had on his face.  He turned his head and saw a small, ornate, green teapot, with a silver trim sitting on the carpet where the table had been moments before.
“Harry?  Oh, mate.  Oh, god.  That was terrible.”  Ron pulled his legs up and rubbed his face.  “I knew coming back to school was going to be difficult, but I didn’t realize how much so.”  He sighed and looked up at Harry.
Ron laugher as he clapped him on the back.  “Well, glad I could help with that! I guess I’ll leave you to your work.  Maybe we’ll see you this weekend?”
Harry reaches for Teddy’s hat and gloves, and said, “We’ll see you later this evening,” and with a nod, vanished in a flash of green flames.
He waited a moment, and when he felt it again, he knew: Draco was lightly scratching his head.  When the fingers scratched against his scalp, a warmth exploded across his skin.  He sighed, and leaned back into the exploring fingers.
It doesn't help that I have written and re-written and re-written AND RE-WRITTEN this chapter too many times to count.  I finally got to a point where I could actually deem it decent enough to post, so I hope you all like it!
It was coming on four before Harry, Hermione, and Ginny had stepped back through the floo into Harry’s sitting room.  Harry congratulated himself on the idea to bring the two women with him; they had been extremely helpful.  His vault in Gringott’s had a large hole in the piles of gold, but Harry was now the proud owner of a whole new wardrobe, down to new pajamas, socks, and four pairs of shoes.
Draco gently reached his hand out, moving a piece of hair from Harry’s eye.  He lightly cupped Harry’s cheek, rubbing it with his thumb.  Harry’s eyes flickered, but then went still.
Since the end of the war, he had been in the paper nearly every day.  They had pictures of him at the funerals, helping with the Hogwarts renovations, talking with the goblins at Gringott’s, sitting at the trials.  It was never ending.  He hoped going back to school would ease the stories about him, but he wasn’t holding his breath.
As Harry became more awake, he became more aware of how his body was responding to being in such close proximity to Draco’s, and also that he really needed to use the loo.  He tried to slowly remove himself from under Draco, but before he was even able to move his arm to push himself up, Draco sighed, snuggling farther onto Harry’s chest.
Looking down, he saw the two he had left for last.  He smiled sadly at it.  These were Draco’s.  Harry had been very excited when he had first seen them.  He knew that Draco would like them, and he had been looking forward to seeing the blond’s reaction when he opened them.
Harry looked around.  Not much had really changed in the short 5 years since they had graduated, but it still felt completely different.
“Well, just make sure he still has all his appendages and teeth when you bring him back.  Actually, maybe not all his teeth: I think he has a couple of loose ones.”
Draco took it and carefully stepped into the tub, sighing as he slid down into the water.  Harry did the same on the other side of the tub.  “This was truly a brilliant idea.”  Draco just hummed in response and he sank a little deeper in the tub.
Harry nodded as he sent another package towards George.  George caught it swiftly, glancing up at Harry’s sad smile.  Harry could see that George took a deep breath before he quickly unwrapped it.  George let out a sound that sounded half laugh, half sob.  Angelina was smiling as she took in the photo in George’s hands.
“Are you kidding?”  Harry wrapped his left arm around Draco, pulling him close.  “I definitely like the new look.”
The trio started upstairs just as the doorbell rang again.  Harry spent the next thirty minutes answering the door and welcoming people that came in through the floo.  By the time the clock struck 9:00, there were around thirty people in his house, including several of their former classmates and the entirety of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
He removed his fingers from the scar and replaced it with his mouth, kissing and licking it, causing Draco to arch up from the bed, keening.  Reaching his stomach, Harry kissed Draco’s naval several times, before sitting back again.  He lightly traced the edge of Draco’s trousers, pausing a moment to think if he was really going to go through with this.
Harry turned back to Ron and said, “Going to the library to finish my Charms essay.  I only have five more inches, so I want to get it done before I go to Grimmauld.”
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say we had floo’d to the wrong house!” Ron beamed down at him.  “Wow, mate.  This is bloody brilliant!”
“Thank you, muggles, for not having magic and needing to find ways to communicate quickly,” Harry chuckled.
Draco leant up to give Harry a languid kiss on the lips.  “That sounds perfect.  Hold that thought just a moment, though; I really need to use the loo.”
Teddy was next, and again jumped into Harry's arms.  "Nana says you're getting married!  That's what enjajed means," he said with a serious nod.
Harry smiled as he thought of Draco complaining to Narcissa about his absence.  “I still don’t understand why you didn’t just stay at mine.”
“No, thankfully.  Although, there are still some things to go through, so it’s still a possibility,” he said with a slight shudder.
They didn’t have to wait very long before their food arrived, and both rarely spoke to the other as they ate; they were too busy moaning over the multitude of flavours that blossomed on their tongues.  Marcella’s truly was the best.
They finally made it to the Hospital Wing, and Madam Pomfrey cast a spell that carefully placed Draco in a bed.  It had been less than three minutes since he had opened the door to find Draco on the ground, but to Harry, it felt like a lifetime.
“Ron, we’ve been over this.  No more fighting.  And speaking of, I don’t want to interrupt those two,” nodding his head towards the kitchen.  “I think I should lea—.”
“No, of course not.  I don't mind at all!  I'm glad, actually.  I haven't needed to send anything lately, and I hate that he has to be cooped up.  I should be thanking you, really.  Use him whenever you need.”
“I, er, I brought you lunch.  If you want?  And, er, I was hoping that we could talk?  I know you’re busy, but please?”  He offered one of the cups to Draco.
“I couldn’t agree more,” Harry said, beginning to rub small circles along Draco’s back.  “I could get used to this.”
Harry waved their waiter down, asking for the check.  Once he paid, he pulled out Draco’s chair, offering him his arm.  They walked back into the alley, where Draco looked up at Harry, questioningly.
Cautiously, Harry said, “Er, yes, I do.  I was telling Draco earlier that I am her grandson’s Godfather.  I see them every other weekend, so I can spend some time with Teddy.”
Taking a breath, he looked up at Draco and said with a smirk, “That is definitely more than one question. But, well, er, it was Umbridge.”
Draco.  And the party was the perfect opportunity to declare his feelings.  He just had to summon that famous Gryffindor courage, and then figure out when to do it.
Fair warning: this chapter contains slight sexy times. :D   No likey?  Then why are you reading a story that is rated Explicit??  ;D
“Okay, Ted.  We’re getting up.  Go down to the sitting room, but do not touch anything until we get there, alright?”
Harry smiled as he leant in for a kiss.  “I love you.  Together, I think we could conquer the world.  I can’t wait to spend the rest of my days with you by my side.”
“Honestly, I felt like I was back in the room of hidden things,” he said, rubbing his arm holding the wand.  “That was really strange.”  Lightly holding his wand, both men glanced down at the seemingly innocent piece of wood.
from the day before over towards him.  As he looked down at the picture of him, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny shopping at Diagon, he really wished the journalists would get a life and leave him alone.
Pansy was never the touchy-feely type, so he was startled as he was suddenly pulled into a hug.  He stiffened for a moment before melting into her embrace for a brief moment,  quickly pulling back and straightening his robes.  She gave him a look that he couldn’t quite decipher, but quickly pushed it aside as he turned and started walking back toward his office.
“Indeed.  I don’t remember that fountain over there,” he said, motioning to a beautiful water fountain that was in the far corner.  The water gave the room a calming feel.  Light music played in the background.
at least every third day.  He had been very relieved when he didn’t see anything about him and Draco in the morning’s paper.  He could only imagine what would have happened if their families had found out about their engagement via the newspaper.
Everyone was enjoying the food, drink, and music.  Draco stood at the front of the room, opening his many gifts.
“I’ve been wondering the same thing.  Is there anything else you remember that might give us a clue?”
Draco nodded, still looking at the floor.  “I understand.  I’ll just go, then.”  He ran his fingers through his hair, again, and turned to the staircase.
“You have to unwrap your gift, first.”  Draco stood at the foot of the bed, stark naked, except for he had a reindeer-head shaped cover on his cock, antlers and all.
“No, no, nothing like that.  I… uh, I had a…  Actually, you know what?  It’s not important.  How was Arithmancy?”
“Well, as normal as ‘The Golden Trio’ can get,” came Ron’s response as he walked up next to Hermione.  “Ugh.  Stupid Prophet and their phrases.  My brothers will never let me live that one down.”
“He has mastered the eyes.  He has been able to do that since he was four months old.  He’s working on the hair, now.”  Harry reached back out to grab him, turning him in his arms to show Draco that the boy had a few patches of bright blond hair on the back of his head.
“Fuck,” he whispered again, as his heart started slowing down to a normal beat.  He laid there, staring at the ceiling, as he brain started reliving the nightmare he’d just awoken from.
“That is basically all it takes.  I listened to my mother enough when I was younger that I picked up on quite a few things.  It got to the point where she would ask me my opinion, and then start changing her plans because she liked my ideas more.  It also helps that I have the lovely gay flare for design.”
“I'm headed to the owlery to send a letter to Molly Weasley.  We are having Christmas at Grimmauld this year, and so I am making sure what she needs of me.”
They walked down the alley, stopping at the many different stalls, picking up bits and bobs along the way.  As they neared Gringott’s, they saw a Christmas Tree stall.  Harry gripped Draco’s hand as they walked through the trees, looking for the perfect one.
Harry could not even dream of understanding all that had gone on in Draco’s life that year.  He recalled crouching under his invisibility cloak, seeing the terror etched on his face as he stood before Dumbledore.  He mentally shook himself as Draco continued.
As the carriage started moving, Hermione asked Harry and Draco, who were sitting next to each other, “Do you two have plans for supper this evening?”
“Don’t listen to him, Ted.  It’s true.  He was amazing.  I never won against him.”  Teddy listened with rapt attention as Draco told him about how amazing Harry was.  After a while, they noticed Teddy’s eyes starting to droop, and it was decided that it was time for bed.
Shaking hands with Mr Chumes, Harry walked back down the hall and into the reception area.  Saying goodbye to the receptionist, he made his way back out into the street.
“I’m sure you will find something,” Hermione said.  “So, Harry, what are you going to do with the rest of your day before dinner at the Burrow tonight?”
“Yeah, I’m happy for them, ecstatic even, but sometimes they just make me sick.”  Harry smiled at Draco, then finished pulling out his book.
Harry laughed, nodding.  “Yeah, he’s rambunctious, so say the least.  I can’t wait to see him, tonight.  I bet he’s grown like a weed since I last saw him.”
He made his way down to the kitchen, where he heard voices and laughter.  He stepped through the door to see Harry standing at the hob, with Teddy standing on a chair at the island counter.  Harry slightly turned to him, pan in his hand.  He gave it a shake a couple of times, and then perfectly flipped the pancake in the pan.  Teddy clapped and laughed as Harry set it back on the heat.
He slowly dragged his cock across that spot over and over again, until Draco was twisting, trying to find purchase on his purple cock.
It wasn’t meant to be, though.  No sooner had Harry linked his hands together, then Draco gave a mild grunt and shifted his weight again.  Harry, knowing Draco was waking up, couldn’t restrain himself any longer and carefully leaned down and kissed the top of Draco’s head.  Draco stiffened, and slowly pulling back, turned his head to look at Harry.
His head was pounding, though, so he closed his eyes instead. Before he could get too comfortable, though, Harry and Madam Pomfrey were back beside his bed.  He opened his eyes to look up at the mediwitch.
Draco turned to look at the handsome owl.  He heard the owl hoot softly as he stuck out his leg for Harry to attach the letter.  Harry fastened on, and then scratched the bird’s head.  Once the bird had gotten enough affection, he lightly nipped Harry’s finger, and flew away.
Yet again, they were ripped out of their trance by Teddy.  They each took one of his hands, and the trio took off across the ice.
Harry could see Draco’s shoulders tense more and more as the man told the room his story.  He completely avoided looking towards Draco, merely nodding his head towards that side of the room when he needed to.  After he was finished, explaining the bright light and how Draco just vanished, he sat back down next to the other defendants, both of whom were looking at the ground.
By the time Harry stepped out of his bedroom, freshly showered and wearing a pair of dark denims and a light grey button-down shirt, he and his friends had decorated Grimmauld, set most of the food up under stasis charms, and he'd figured out what he was going to say to Draco.  He paused a moment at the top of the stairs to take a deep breath, and then started down to the sitting room.
As they walked into the bright white building, Harry could swear he kept hearing muttered “thieves” as they walked down the row of Goblins.  He didn’t think they would ever truly be forgiven for their past discretions.
They hugged briefly before Ron left and Harry sat back behind his desk.  He sighed loudly before pulling the pile of paperwork towards him.
Harry internally rolled his eyes.  Was he that obvious?  Wait—of course he was.  Anymore, he ignored all of his friends, sitting glumly and avoiding conversation, until a certain blond walked in.  Then, he was animated, conversing with everyone, and having a grand time.
They skated for what seemed like hours.  They saw several of their school mates, and at one point Hermione and Ron joined them.  After some time, Teddy started to grow restless.  He started whining about being tired, so Ron and Hermione took him to go sit down at a bench, giving Harry and Draco some time to skate alone.
Harry walked over to them, looking at Draco.  “Do you want to hold him as we walk, or do you want me to?”
Stepping up to the bed where Draco was seated, he lay them beside him and said, “Do you remember Colin Creevey? Gryffindor that always had his camera and was always taking pictures of me?”
“And, so, I picked up a few things.  This summer, since I was alone for a while, I had time to try some new recipes.  I’m decent.”
the small box from under the tree, he glanced over at Harry, who just smiled wide and winked at his best mate.
It was then that he felt a weight on his right hand, and blearily looking over, saw Harry sitting in a chair beside the bed, holding Draco’s hand, while his head lay on top of his arm.
“Well, I'm going to go.  I'm going to escort Hermione to her parent’s new place, and then head to the Burrow.  I'll see you Sunday!  Have a good weekend, Malfoy,” he said nodding to the blond as he stood up.  “See ya, Harry.”
Harry held out Draco’s seat, helping him take off his coat, and then brushing his hands over Draco’s back as he moved to sit across from him.  The girl gave them their menus, informing them their waiter would be with them shortly.
He had to be cheating on him.  That was truly the only explanation, as Harry had always been a very hands-on lover.  At times, while they were dating, Draco had almost felt suffocated because Harry was always right by his side, or laying on top of him, or had his head on his shoulder.
, he thought.  He walked over to his chest of drawers, pulling some wrapping paper off of the top.  He deftly flicked his wand, grateful that Hermione had taught him the spell to make wrapping gifts much simpler.  He affixed notes on the packages, saying to whom each one belonged.  Once he was finished, he carefully stacked the packages on top of each other.
As he neared the door, he heard what sounded like humming.  He quietly pushed open the door and smiled at the sight before him.
Draco deflated as he listened to what Harry was saying.  “Okay, you’re right.  But I still feel like we need to do
For once, he didn’t pick a fight, and let Harry carry him up the stairs without a fuss.  They stepped into his room, which Harry had been adamant had to happen when they were remodeling, and helped in change into pyjamas.  He used the loo, and then crawled into his bed, tugging the stuffed dog that he kept at Grimmauld under the blanket with him.
Draco drained the spaghetti, and tasted the sauce.  He flicked his wand and made everything combine into one bowl, and then flicked it again to make plates and utensils land onto the table.
The trio had barely gotten to the door, though, when the fire flared up.  They all three turned to see who was coming through.
They finished the tour in the formal dining room, where Harry explained that that was where they were going to have Christmas dinner, and he was thinking of getting a tree for in there, as well as the sitting room.
Harry smiled as Draco walked up to him and wrapped an arm around his waist.  Harry lifted he arm and settled it on Draco’s shoulders.  “You’ll find him, Gin.  I promise.”
“It is, indeed,” Draco smiled, moving his foot to rub against Harry’s ankle.  They looked at each other and smiled.
Harry took a deep breath and walked forward so that he was leaning directly over Albus Dumbledore’s head.  “Hello, sir,” he whispered.  “I believe this belongs here with you.”
Draco screamed again as Harry open-mouthed kissed his cloth covered cock.  “YES!  Oh, please, Harry!  Yes, yes, yes!”
He leaned over to the other two, whispering back and forth for a moment.  He finally nodded, and leaned back in his chair.  “Er, Minister, my clients would like to amend their pleas.”
Suddenly, a bright flash slashed through the air.  They swiveled their heads over to see a man lower a camera, wide toothy grin on his face.  He tipped his hat at them, and disapparated away.
Harry didn’t like the idea that Draco was right, but upon telling him so and receiving a wink in return, Harry gestured for Draco to follow him to their next destination.
He rubbed at his cheeks as he sat back down, still giggling.  He stared at the empty table for a moment before turning and looking at Harry. “Can we decorate the table for dinner, like Nana did at home?”
Draco didn’t realize how close the rink was to Hogwarts.  He had overseen the vendors, so this was the first time he had been to this side of the market.  It was as if the castle had risen out of the depths, shining brightly in the distance.  There were dozens of lamps lit up around the rink, making it looked ethereal.  There was a tent set up next to it that was where the skates were located.  Draco pointed towards it, and the three set off.
Draco whined as Harry released him and moved back to settle between his legs.  “Okay, I’m going to slowly open you up, now.  Damn, I can't wait to be inside of you.  I've wanted this for so long.”
He looked back over at his aunt, who had nearly the exact same look on her face as his mother.  “Cissa,” she whispered.
“Hey, buddy.  Did you sleep well?  Huh?”  He cooed at his godson as he lifted the boy out of the cot and placed him on the changing bureau.  “Such a good baby.  Let’s get you cleaned up and then see about some breakfast, yeah?”
Setting Teddy down in the middle of his room, Harry pulled out a few of the toys that Andromeda had packed and set them on the floor in front of Teddy.  He cast a spell that Molly had taught him that created an invisible barrier around Teddy; he could crawl around inside of the walls, but he couldn’t get into anything outside of it.
“Yes, and Nev is going to try and meet us for lunch.  He’s already done his shopping, and his Gran isn’t feeling well this week, so he is spending the morning with her.”
“It’s really okay, Hermione.  Honest.  Skeeter is just a pest,” Harry tried to convince his friend.  “I’ve dealt with her saying worse, and I have a feeling my times with the press breathing down my back are just beginning.  Besides, we have more important things to do right now.”
“Well, because we all thought you were?  You two were mighty close towards the end of term.  And, well, I saw the way he was playing with your hair during the game, on Thursday,” Ron said, cheeks flaming.
“Right.  Well, I was able to fix my broken wand, the one that I got when I was 11, so I was not in need of his wand anymore.  After I decided to put the Elder Wand back where it belonged, I came to the conclusion that I would give Draco back his wand.  I wanted to do it properly, though, so I went and spoke with Ollivander.  He told me about an incatation and ritual that could be used to give control of a wand to another person.”
“But I was talking to my Mind Healer this week, and the gift came up; she thinks it would be a good idea for us to get away.  I know, you’ve got the Market going until the new year, so it doesn’t have to be right now, but I just thought that may—”
Harry leant in to Draco’s ear, though, and whispered, “Besides, I’d much rather continue this in a nice comfortable bed, such as mine at Grimmauld.  Just think, in 12 days, we will have more than a fortnight to do whatever we please…”
“Really, Ron.  It’s okay.  Yes, I wish I knew what the hell was going on in his head, but it’s Christmas, and I just want to enjoy the company of my family and friends.  Okay?”
Harry turned over, glancing at the clock on his bedside table.  He’d convinced Draco when they had moved in together that muggles did know what they were doing when it came to some technology.  “Ugh, 6:22.”
Pulling everything out of one of the bags that Andy had brought, Harry quickly repacked it with several nappies, Teddy’s dinner, a bottle, a toy, and a change of clothes.
Draco rolled his eyes and walked to stand beside Harry at the counter.  “Is there anything I can do to help, then?”
He was so glad that Hermione was able to quickly find her parents.  Ron had gone with her; they left towards the end of May to go to Australia to find them.  It apparently hadn’t taken them too long to locate them.
Harry floo’d into their sitting room at 6:15 sharp.  He looked around at the room and frowned.  “Draco?”
He followed the plush grey carpet down the hall and into a large waiting area, before walking towards a large mahogany door.  He paused a moment, waiting to see if Clarice, Kingsley’s assistant, would say anything to stop him, but she just threw a hand up at him, waving him in.
“Actually, I have some that I’d like to put up as well.  You go get the ones out of the attic, while I go get mine, okay?”
I still don't know where I'm going with this, but I kind of figure there will be about 3 or 4 more chapters...maybe.  And hopefully it won't be another 2 years before the next chapter goes up... Fingers crossed.
“And I swear, Malfoy, you are just trying to make sure that I go completely broke!  When will I ever use this?!”  Harry pulled a bright purple, elephant-shaped plate out of a bag.
Draco smiled, lifting his hand to stare at the ring on his finger.  “Fiancé,” he whispered.  He turned back to Harry with a huge grin on his face. He leant in for another kiss, before sliding down the bed and laying his head on Harry’s chest.
“That sounds fine with me.  I’ll let mother know when she gets done with her looking.  I’ll go back up there, if you want to continue with what you were working on,” he said, motioning to the forgotten carpet.
“Uh huh!  I saw it in Digone Alley, and asked if I could get it for you!  I also made you both somefing at school, and put it in there.  It’s that one!”  He pointed to a messily wrapped gift that had been set under their tree.
Coming down the last of the stairs, he walked up to Draco and said, “This may sound odd, but would you be willing to ask your mother if she would be interested in several Black family heirlooms?  I seriously am planning on renovating this house, and, well, the furniture just isn’t my style.  It’s not like I can have a muggle sidewalk sale and sell the furniture.  I don’t want to just banish it, either.  I don’t know.  I just thought your mother might have…some interest or something.”
As Draco’s pants were finally removed, Harry sat stunned for a moment as he took in the gorgeous cock before him.  If there was still any lingering doubt as to if he was gay, this moment absolutely confirmed it.  Draco was long and thick, with just a sprinkling of pale hair.  It was standing full at attention, bright pink head dripping with pre-come.  The veins were pulsing, and Harry couldn’t wait any longer; he leant in and licked up, from bollocks to the head.  Draco howled, gripping the blanket with white knuckles.
Draco reached over to the bedside table, picking up Harry’s glasses.  He pulled open the arms and handed them to Harry, who slipped them on.  “It’s about 9:00. I’m sorry to wake you, but my mother and Professor McGonagall are down in your sitting room.”
“Merry Christmas” Teddy grinned, hugging Draco, and then gripping both of their hands and practically pulling them towards the doors.
When he finally released him, Harry said, “Well, hello to you, too.”  He chuckled as he sat down on the edge of the bed, saying, “I’m sorry I didn’t come back earlier.  I got a bit of sleep, but was woken by McGonagall to go and speak to Auror Pye, to give my statement.  Is that who you spoke to?”  Receiving a nod, Harry continued.  “I then decided to go back to Grimmauld and clean up a bit of the mess, and worked a couple more hours in the kitchen.  I came back, deciding to take a nap, but got sidetracked.  I’ve spent the past few hours up in Gryffindor tower, talking with an old friend, figuring out Christmas gifts for everyone.  I, er, really hope you’ll like yours.”  Harry looked down at the floor, and Draco could see the faint blush touching the tops of his cheeks.
“Are you serious?!”  Teddy jumped up and hugged Harry around his waist before moving over to Draco and doing the same.  He walked back over to where he had been sitting near the tree and read the scrap of parchment over and over.  He was still grinning as he made his way up towards his room an hour later, to get ready to go to the Burrow.
“I can see that.  What about a couple of nice chairs over in the corner, with maybe a small table?”  He grabbed the pad out of Harry’s hands, reaching around Harry’s back and taking out the muggle pencil that he knew was in Harry’s back pocket.  Harry had picked it up on their last trip to the lumber store, and Draco knew he carried it around with him whenever they were working on the house.
“You did great! It’s brilliant, and so much more logical to have two openings into the dining room! AND! You got rid of that annoying portrait! Thank you,” he added, leaning over and kissing Draco.
Looking around the room, he couldn’t believe that they had already been in school for nearly two months; Halloween was only one week away.  In that time, so much had happened.
Draco moaned a muffled “Harry!” into his mouth.  He threw his head back, rutting up into Harry, as he screamed, “I’m coming!  I’m coming!  I’m co--!”  He thrust his hips off of the bed as he started coming, white stripes painting both of their chests.  “Oh my gods above!”
Teddy went over to look for his name on the presents, giving Harry and Draco a moment.  “I can’t believe that little boy,” Harry said, looking at the stag.
“It made it easy that not a single student stayed over the holiday.  However, just be happy, and it’ll be payment enough.”
Kreacher sat the tray down on the bedside table, cast a warming charm over the food, bowed, and disapparated.
“Er, yes.  I think.  Thank you, sir, for all of your help.  I should get back.”  Harry smiled as he stood, shaking the man’s hand.  Mr. Ollivander walked him back up to the front, in which Harry turned and again shook his hand.  Taking his leave, he turned back up the street and Apparated back towards Hogwarts.
“I missed you, too.  You were all I could think about.  Sometime it got me in trouble when one of my team would have to snap me out of my daydreaming.”  He chuckled, making Draco smile.
Harry winked before he moved to crawl up the bed to straddle Draco’s waist, but was stopped by Draco’s elegant foot being pressed into his chest.
Hermione was about to respond to that, but Harry cut her off.  “Yes, I spoke for him and his mother.  And if that means that he doesn’t go to Azkaban, then I’m glad.”
Harry sat up as well, pulling Draco so that they were sitting up at the head of the bed, facing each other.  Harry reached for Draco’s hand, thumb gliding over the ring on his finger.  “I asked for your hand.  You and I had discussed not doing the old ways of Courting, but I wanted to make sure they approved.”
“Harry!  I hope you didn’t forget about…”  Her words tapered off and her eyes widened as she caught sight of who else was in the room.
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter, Professor.  Your mother is already here, sir,” he said nodding towards where Narcissa sat in the front row, directly behind where Draco would be sitting.  “Remember, answer directly.  You were not at fault, they were, so you have nothing to worry about.”
“I just do.  We have all been through so much in the past few years.  I just want the fighting and animosity to stop.”
Harry chuckled.  “Alright, I’m going.  I have a therapy session before I go in, as we won’t be here for my normal time slot for the next few days.”
“Master Draco.”  Jissy, his mother’s house elf, stood beside his bed, looking up at him.  Draco blearily leaned over the edge of the bed to be able to look at the tiny creature.
After that, they swiftly changed topics, and finished their tea.  Harry glanced down at his watch and saw that it was nearly 5:00, so he made their excuses and prepared to leave.
He made his way back to the lifts, heading down three floors.  As he got off, he had to duck to avoid a collision with about twenty different memos that were making their way to their recipients.
“No, love, go back to sleep,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and trying to get him to curl back up to his side.
“I think you’re going to have a hard time keeping your hands off of me when you see me.  Too bad it’s bad luck to see your partner in their clothes before the wedding.”
Harry was currently splayed across Teddy, fake squishing him to the bed.  Teddy was yelling for Draco to help him, but he just lay there, feigning sleep.  Finally, he roused and blinked at the two.
“It started on my birthday, actually, when we went to Hogwarts; when we were sailing across the lake, just like back in first year.”
“But, how do you know?  He hasn’t touched me, let alone really looked at me in months.  It makes perfect sense.  He’s gone before I get out of the shower in the mornings and goes on his ‘walks’ right after supper.  I just— Where are you going?”
Pansy gave Hermione a conspiratorial smirk, and patted Draco on the cheek.  “Nothing for you to worry your pretty, little head about, Darling.  Have a good weekend, you lot.” Smiling once again at Hermione, Pansy turned and walked over to their room.
“Apologies for making you wait, but we had a few more gifts to wrap before coming down.”  Narcissa pulled out several things from the pocket of her robes.  She waved her wand and they unshrunk before flying towards the tree.
Harry let out the breath that he had been holding.  He knew Bill would never let Draco get into harm’s way.  “Thank you, Bill.”
Hermione smiled, pulling him to sit in-between her and Ginny in front of the couch that Ron, George, and Angelina were sitting on. “I tried to explain how it worked, but do you think they listened?” she whispered to Harry.  Harry laughed.
Ron, who was wide-eyed, and turning beet red, tried to talk, but was still silenced.  Draco huffed, disabling his charms, helping his friend up off the floor.
Draco looked at Harry and said, “Potter, how can you say you don’t have a gay flare for design?  That is brilliant.  I never would have thought of taking out a wall in order to make an en-suite.  Seriously.  You’ve got the flare.”
“It’s getting a little crowded right here.  How about we move into the lounge?”  Harry gestured for everyone to move into the room that was connected to the dining room, and had several chairs and couches.
Draco was right.  He’d been so busy getting everything ready for the Market, working with the foreign committee members to get everything ready for opening day, he’d not had a single spare moment to think about Harry.  That’s not to say that he hadn’t seen him, nor spoken to him, but he had spent several nights sleeping on the couch in his office, or just collapsing on the sofa in their living room, never making it to their bed.
Harry had questioned him more, to which Draco said he had fallen down the stairs, and that it was not a big deal.  But, Harry being Harry, knew that something just wasn’t right.
Draco grinned.  “There’s just one more.  I got it while I was out shopping with Pansy and Blaise a few weeks ago.  The holidays were coming up fast, and I didn’t know if you would be home, but I saw this on a display in Herrod’s, and decided I needed it, if nothing more than to hang beside my bed and stare at it while I thought of you.”
He laid back down, rubbing his right hand over his face as his left reached for his glasses on the night stand. Slipping them on, he looked over at the clock to see that it was barely 6:00am.
“Okay, now we can finish eating,” he said with a smirk, and turned back to his food, leaving Harry gobsmacked and just this side of horny.
It was after midnight when the last person left.  Kreacher had already cleaned up the food and drinks, and moved everything else down to the kitchen, so as soon as they said goodnight to Pansy, they both turned and went up the stairs to the bedroom.
“Oh, I’m so glad you’re alright! I hate looking at that blasted clock and seeing it say ‘away’ or worse.  I’ve taken to not looking at it at all, lately, which is why I didn’t know you were back.”
Finishing his shower, he turned off the water and grabbed his towel off the rack.  Walking back upstairs to his bedroom, he quickly dried off and found some clothes.  He put on a pair of dark ebony jeans, and a light blue, collared shirt.  He pulled out a darker blue jumper to pair with it, assuming it would be cooler up north.  He placed his wand in his holster, buckling it onto his arm.  His new favorite dragon-skinned shoes were slipped onto his feet, and he was ready to conquer the day.
“Well, I was just thinking that our tour of Grimmauld and dinner plans got a bit side-tracked, last time.  Maybe we could do it tonight?”  She looked over at Ron, who just shrugged and nodded, and then looked over at Harry and Draco.
Harry leaned over, as he had every ten minutes or so, and gave Draco a kiss.  Draco grinned as he rolled his eyes, but kissed him back.  “Did you see what I did to your ring?”
Actually, it appeared as if they both had had plans compiled for quite some time.  Narcissa had brought over a notebook a few days after the party that was full of colour palettes, flower ideas, wizarding venues, and so much more.
“It’s okay. He’s forgiven you. We all have. It’s in the past, all of it; time to live in the present, yeah?”
Kingsley turned, looking almost shocked to see Harry there.  “Harry! Good morning!  Please, have a seat.”
She suddenly seemed to realize where they all were standing, and seemed to pale, if it was possible.
“Okay, okay,” Harry said with a yawn.  “We’re coming.  You go sit quietly on the sofa, and then we’ll be down in just a second, okay?”
Draco leaned over and gave him a deep kiss.  “We’re really doing this.  10 days to plan a wedding to the man of my dreams?  Challenge accepted.”
“Of course I did.  A couple, as of yet, in fact.”  Harry could sense the panic rising in Draco, and so quickly said, “Don’t worry about it!  I’m not expecting anything.  I just like to show the people I care about just how much they mean to me.”
“Originally, I only had 2 photos to give you, but Dennis brought over some more a few days ago, and I decided that, should I ever speak to you again, you should have a few more.” Draco grimaced at Harry, but he just lifted his hand and brushed some stray hairs behind Draco’s ear. He gestured to the photos.
Looking into his godson’s eyes, Harry realized the infant had changed his eye color to match Harry’s.  He gasped a little, and looked quickly at Andromeda as she walked into the room with a tray of tea and biscuits.  Seeing Harry’s face, she put the tray down and quickly walked over.  Looking between the two pairs of eyes now looking at her, she gasped as well.
Teddy jumped up and climbed into Harry’s lap, wrapping him in a hug.  Harry gripped him back, before letting him go so he could do the same to Draco.  “I love you.”
They wrapped the gifts for the better part of the morning, laughing and talking and just enjoying their time.  They talked about the wedding, and what and where
“Eh, I’ve had a few days off, and have gotten to spend some time with Draco, so we thought we would have a party, so I could see everyone else!  I’m missed y—”
That same evening, after they had returned Teddy to Andromeda, Harry and Draco stood in the middle of their sitting room, tossing a quaffle.
This chapter is about Harry's birthday, and then the next is more shopping and a quick conversation with our dear Draco!  Chapter four will finally be at Hogwarts, and then we'll go from there!  Hope you like this!
“Nothing, I just twisted wrong and got a pain in my back,” he said as he glared at Harry, who quirked his eyebrow up.  Draco gave him a look.
Luna was chatting with Ginny, and both women were laughing and glancing at him.  Harry didn’t think he wanted to know what their conversation was about.
“And why not?  I don’t think he’s going to tell anyone,” nodding toward the animal pulling the sleigh.  “Let me take care of you, love.”
Suddenly, Harry said, “Professor, will this…must we…I don’t even know how to ask what I’m trying to ask,” Harry said, shaking his head.
“Again, it’s Harry.  And I can ‘associate’ with whomever I wish to.  They’ll just have to get over it.  I’m tired.  No more.”
“Nothing to worry your handsome blond head about, I promise.  Now, come on.  I wanted to check out that little store next to the Italian restaurant.  I have a feeling we’ll be able to find Molly something in there.”
Draco surged up to kiss him again, before sliding down again and placing his head back on Harry’s chest.  He glanced up and saw that the tempus charm now said it was 5:58.
“The next one pulled me off the bed, and kicked me in the stomach.  The pain was... I guess I blacked out, because I don’t remember anything else until I woke up just a few minutes ago.”  He grimaced as he turned back to Professor McGonagall.
Harry looked back at Narcissa, seemingly asking her what he should do.  After what seemed like hours, but was merely seconds, both women walked quickly towards each other, wrapping their arms around the other, crying into each other’s shoulders.
Harry laughed at him, saying he was going to go get something to drink.  They spent the rest of the afternoon talking and drinking butterbeers.  Harry sat up the telly and DVD player, which he put in the corner facing the couches, constantly answering the questions that Ron threw his way about the muggle things.  By the time he had figured everything out, it was nearing 6:00, and Ron convinced Harry to join him at the Burrow for dinner.  Deciding it would be best to have one final conversation with Molly before Christmas, he acquiesced, and they made their way through the floo.
Harry took a glass, passed it to Draco, and then took one for himself before pulling Draco with him out of the room.
Harry nodded as Draco walked away, his lunch still sitting on the table.  He did need to get back to work, but he also just didn’t think he could sit there and listen to Harry just yet.  He turned his head back to see Harry blow out a deep breath, running his hand through his unruly hair, before picking up their food.
Harry and Andromeda had made a deal after the war, that she would have him full time, but Harry could come and get him at any time, and he would spend at least one weekend a month with him.  Harry had wanted to make sure that Teddy knew he was loved, and that Harry would always be there for him.
Maybe this was what he needed.  A last night with his two best friends, talking about old times, and what was to come.  Perfection.
Draco could hear Harry’s quiet cackling over his furious whispering as the hospital wing door opened and then swung shut.
“Well, honestly, when they first questioned me, I wasn’t sure it had actually happened.  I thought it was probably my imagination, or something.  It was days later, after going over it and over it, that I considered that maybe it actually did happen.”
He pressed a kiss to her cheek, and then led her over to the sofa, sitting down beside Charlie and striking up a conversation.
This night had definitely not gone the way he thought it would have, but somehow, he’d still ended up in bed with Draco.  I’ll take whatever I can get, he thought to himself as he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
Harry, who was standing on a conjured ladder, fixing patches on the ceiling, looked behind him at Draco.  “Huh?”
Draco nodded, and Harry noticed him try and swallow what he knew was a lump in his throat.  Harry wished there was something else he could do for him, but at that moment Mcgonagall ushered them forward toward the security desk.  They each placed their wands on the desk, and waited for the guard to scan them and weigh their wands.  Not much in that system had changed since the end of the war, except that the guard kept looking between Harry and Draco with a look of curiosity, awe, and disgust as he eyes swept back and forth.
His mouth was full of blood, with both of his eyes black and blue with bruises.  His usually pristine blond hair was covered in dirt and blood.  His left arm was at a strange angle, and his right hand had scratches and bruising.  His clothing had rips in them.  He was moaning, so Harry knew he was breathing.
Walking outside, they saw that the carriages were lined up awaiting the students, so they decided to take one to the train station, and then apparate from there, instead of walking through the snow.
“What the fuck?” he whispered.  Or, so he thought.  Apparently, though, he was loud enough for half the table to hear him, because they all turned around and saw who was walking towards them, elbowing anyone that hadn’t heard.  Harry felt like falling into a hole.
Stepping back into the room, he looked over at Draco, who was perched on the edge of his bed, looking down at his hands.  “Ready?”
He carefully placed them on the tree, and then went back to the box and picked up the bulbs with a big dog, and the two that were wolves; one for Remus, the other for Tonks.
Draco laughed at Harry’s face, before playfully rolling his eyes.  “Of course you did.  It’s beautiful, though.  Is the other box another of your projects, too?”
Beverly McGovern had been Harry’s secretary since he had taken this position, the year before.  She had been the previous head’s secretary, so she basically came with the promotion, but that didn’t stop Harry from making her his confidante.
Draco nodded, and Harry turned him to face the floo.  He ran back to the table to retrieve their cloaks, saying a quick goodbye to everyone, and then ran back to where Draco still stood.  He looked over at Blaise, who was still standing a couple of steps behind them, mouthing ‘Thank you’.
The two men were still walking down the corridor towards the stairs.  Harry didn’t know what came over him, but he suddenly turned his head and said, “Want to come with?”
“So, I decided as part of your Christmas present, I would get rid of the nuisance that is my great-aunt.”
“Like I said, I’ve thought a lot about it, and… And while I understand why you didn’t tell me all that was going on, I still wish you had.  I want to know you—all of you.  The good and the bad.  I know how much your family means to you, though, and I don’t want to get in the way of what is expected of you and your future.”
Draco turned away from Ron, who was stepping into the fireplace, and walked across the hall towards the lounge. He paused in the doorway and just watched Harry sleep. He felt as if he could stand there and watch the man sleep all day, but at the same time, he wanted to be able to spend time with a lucid Harry, so he smoothly crossed the room, carefully manuevering himself until he was sat across Harry’s form, causing him to awake.
Harry was awoken the next morning by an owl tapping on his bedroom window.  Rolling over, he saw that there was a beautiful eagle owl sitting on his window sill, staring unblinkingly at him.  The sun was barely up, so he blearily uncovered himself, and, shivering slightly, hurried over to let the animal inside.
They had just finished when they heard Narcissa coming back down the stairs.  “Oh, Harry! Thank you so much for letting me look at the furniture.  I just took a wonderful trip down memory lane.  Draco, I found some chairs that once belonged to your great-great-great-grandparents!”  She turned and smiled at Harry.  “I marked the pieces that I want for myself, but like I said, I have to find the space for them.  The rest, too, I know exactly where you can take them.”
Draco nodded, as he took one more look, and then picked up the next one. Turning it over, he grimaced and then laughed, shaking his head.
“Well, some of the aurors had said that according to Mr Malfoy’s—sorry, Draco’s—story, he disappeared from the second floor of the Knight Bus in a circle of bright, white light.  When I heard that, I knew it couldn’t have been apparition, as we would have been notified here at the Ministry, per your probation.”
Justin, Dean, Seamus, and Blaise were helping Professor Flitwick finish part of the Charms corridor, as well as a bit of Ravenclaw Tower.
After supper, the children were give hot cocoa, and the adults passed around firewhiskey, and they opened presents.
“Harry!”  Draco moaned his name.  Harry’s pants suddenly got tighter as all thoughts of questioning Draco disappeared from his brain at that sound.
“I know.”  Harry leant back in for another kiss.  This one wasn’t as aggressive as the last.  They both just allowed themselves the pleasure of the other.
Kreacher mumbled something to himself as Harry and Draco started taking out the packages from their pockets and expanding them.  He took all of the things that belonged in the kitchen and popped away without another word.
He stood, popping his back, and made his way up to their bedroom to get ready for work.  He could indeed hear Harry in their shower.  In the past, he would strip down and slip in behind Harry, both getting each other even dirtier.  Now, though…  He just decided to cast a light cleaning charm on his body and pulled on clean clothes.
“Yes, it will.  It will be our first as an engaged couple, who are living together.  It will our first as future husbands.”
Harry blushed as he realised he’d been found out.  “I—I have to leave soon…” he whispered into the darkness.
Waiting until everyone had gathered in the dusty attic, Harry finally released Draco’s hand in order to stand up on a crate to address the group.
Taking a somewhat wheezing breath, Draco tried to speak.  His mouth and throat weren’t cooperating, though, so it took a few tries before he was able to emit a strangled, “Harry?”
“Thanks.  It’s taken awhile, and I’m not even half-way through with it all, but it is definitely coming together.”
Harry began looking around, too, because he was not the one to do that spell.  He couldn’t figure out who had done it, until he glanced over to the man sitting next to him.
“Shouldn’t be a problem at all.  When you pick it up, I will teach you the spell that will activate the magic, so when you get it in place, it will work.  He will then talk, and be able to move about the painting as well as others.  Does all of this make sense?”
“You’re not so bad, yourself,” Harry said as he carefully slid himself out of Draco.  They both winced, as they were both sensitive.
“True, but their new seeker will never be able to play as well as the person she replaced,” Harry said with a slight blush.
He saw Hagrid out in the garden talking with Charlie Weasley.  Harry had only met Charlie Weasley a few times, but Harry noticed that the man was, in fact, what one might call
The feather moved a little, but still lay on the book.  Thinking harder, he opened his hand and tried again.  Suddenly, not only was the feather floating, but so was the book underneath it.  Both objects were hanging in the air in front of Harry.
Draco gave Harry a perplexed look, but slid his finger under the spellotape, and took the paper off.  He lifted the lid and gasped.
“You’re no—”  Draco stood and moved towards Harry, but Harry just lifted his hand to stop him.  Draco paused, but then stepped forward until he was in front of Harry.
It didn’t take long before Draco was popping back out from under the blanket, wiping the corners of his mouth, fixing his hair, and grinning from ear to ear.
Their photo was of them walking down Diagon Alley.  If Harry had to guess, it was taken sometime during the summer that Fleur had worked at Gringott’s.
Draco shifted in his seat a bit later, leaning forward a bit, and crossing his legs.  He started talking to Ron, resolutely ignoring Nott when he tried to butt into the conversation, which thrilled Harry.  After a while, Draco leant back into his side, and Harry instinctively started playing with his hair.
“No, that’s the other part,” Ron said. “We’re going to open it up and make another door into the dining room!”
Hermione and, surprising all but the former Slytherin's, Pansy had already laid out their reviewing schedules for the next two weeks.  Group study sessions for all classes were being planned, and everyone was staying at Hogwarts the next weekend to study.
Draco clenched his fists as he took in his husband, who’d apparently floo’d home and immediately changed clothes; he was currently wearing his old Gryffindor sweatpants, fluffy socks, and his favorite Weasley sweater.
“We didn’t know how much longer you two would be, and the natives were getting restless,” Draco said with a nod to Ted.  He had the decency to look sheepish.
“Because I know it’s the truth, and everyone needs to hear it.  I trust you.  It may seem mad, but I do.”
Harry nodded as he said, “Yeah. When I received the owl from Pansy asking if Greg and Theo could come last night, I pulled out a few photos for each of them.”
The two sat quietly, working away for about an hour when suddenly he saw out of the corner of his eye someone come hurtling towards them.  Glancing up, Harry realized that it was Ron racing towards the table, with a large, wide grin on his face.
“He’s tucked in with his Auntie Angie,” Hermione smiled, looking over to where Hugo was indeed tucked into Angelina’s arms, staring up at her chocolate brown eyes in awe.
Draco sighed, but said, “I don’t know.  It just kind of felt like the burning sensation that I felt when you gave me my wand back.”
“I asked Tom to make you a Shark Bite, since I know you don’t drink wine anymore.  It’s a muggle drink; I saw the recipe on the internet, and thought you’d like it,” he said to Draco, before putting his arm around his shoulder.
Harry turned to say something to Draco, but stopped when he saw the tinge of pink on the blond’s cheeks and the dumbfounded look on his face.  “What’s wrong?”
The look on Teddy’s face was priceless.  He looked around in wonderment and awe at all of the vendors and shops.  “Where’s the skating?”
“Well, yeah, mate, obviously,” Ron said.  “But, it also means that you and Malfoy have compatible magic.”
Draco smiled as they wandered toward the apparition spot.  “And maybe we can bring Ted out this weekend and go skating?  I think he would love it.”
George stood next, sending packages to everyone.  Harry was pleased to see some of his favourite Wheezes in the package, but also saw some things he had never heard of.  He looked over at Ron, who seemed to have the same thing.
Suddenly, Harry leaned forward, reaching for his wine glass.  He threw back the rest of the liquid in his glass, and pulled himself up to standing.  He stepped out of the tub, seeing the look of confusion in Draco’s eyes.
They were quiet as their ride came to a close, and they thanked the wizard again as they made their way back into the warmth of the lodge.
Draco wrapped his fingers around Harry’s shirt tightly, and Harry could tell he was reliving that afternoon in his head. Harry did the same, remembering the way Katie’s body had contorted in the air. He drew in a shaky breath, and began rubbing Draco’s neck.
Harry looked up and saw Andromeda at the top of the stairs.  He felt Teddy stiffen in his arms.  “Tough luck, mate.  You got the full name.”  He let Teddy slide from his arms to the floor, where he turned to face his grandmother, black, messy head, which resembled his godfather’s, turning down.
Draco shook his head as he watched the witch walk away, and then followed the trio out of the room and back out into the corridor.
“No! It’s okay,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s left wrist.  He looked at it, and then looked up at Draco.  “It’s okay. Er, still willing to help?  Great.”  Releasing his arm, Harry explained to Draco what they needed to do to get the carpet up, and soon they had a roll of old, dusty carpet.  With a swish of his wrist, Harry vanished it, leaving the room empty.
Pulling on clean pants and pajama bottoms on, he found a plain white shirt, and put that on.  He shivered before casting another warming charm on the room.  Now that he had figured out the electricity charm, he needed to figure out a way to install a muggle air conditioning/heater unit into the house.
Harry grabbed the lube again, coating his fingers.  Draco was still breathing hard, but pulled his legs back up to his chest when Harry settled down between them.  Harry gently pushed one finger against the puckering hole, and pushed until it slid in.  Draco gasped as Harry pumped it in and out.  He then gently inserted a second, scissoring them until Draco was squirming on the bed.
Draco paused, opening both eyes to look at Harry.  He had a feeling he knew what was coming.  “I’m listening.”
“Okay, Ted.  We’re getting up.  Go down to the sitting room, but do not touch anything until we get there, alright?”
“It was.  Are we sure we want to shop, too?  I could just crash in bed right about now and be completely content.”
Draco sighed, turning to pull him in his arms.  “We all love you, Harry.  No one likes seeing you so closed off.  You are not alone in this, do you understand me?  All you have to do is ask, and any one of us will drop whatever we’re doing and be by your side.”
They stepped into the hall, and made their way over to the table.  There were two seats left in the middle of the table, in between Hermione and Seamus.  Harry walked over and sat down next to Hermione.
Draco shrugged his shoulders.  “Bill and Fleur, too.  Well, that’s the majority of them, anyway, so might as well just go for the whole family.”  He scribbled names onto the letters.  Harry typed up messages to those that he knew had mobiles.  “Aunt Andromeda and Teddy, of course.  Pansy, Blaise, Theo.  Luna.  Neville and Susan?  Haven’t seen them in a while.”
“You can’t make promises you can’t keep,” Draco mumbled against the pillow, as he tried to blink back the tears.
Feeing the need to tell him he was home, he forced himself to get up and got downstairs.  He stepped into the kitchen and saw Harry standing in front of the hob, dressed in joggers, a tee shirt, and Christmas socks.
“Don’t for one second think that now that I have finally gotten you to make a move, I’m going to let this go so easily.  Please, Potter,” he drawled with a smile, “You should know me better than that, by now.”
Harry nodded to each of the women, saying, “Good morning, Narcissa.  Professor.”  As he sat down, he said, “I’m so sorry for keeping you waiting.  Draco was filling me in.  I’m glad to see Kreacher was able to scrounge up some tea.  I’m in the middle of renovating the kitchen, you see.”
Leaning back, he saw the confused look on Draco’s face as the blond said, “That's it? That's all I get?”
Harry was in awe of this revelation; he wanted to tell everyone he knew what had happened!  He chided himself;
“I have been your friend for less than four months, and in that time, I have become friends with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs.  I play chess with Weasley, and talk about classes with Granger.  That
Harry wasn’t so sure he should allow his arch enemy into his home, but he argued with himself about the fact that he wanted to start over.  No more fighting.  He had a feeling this was to be his new mantra.  Who knows what could happen if everyone could just get along?
Blushing lightly at the fact that his head of house knew him so well, he nodded at her.  “Anything you need of me, Professor, I’m willing.  However, there are a couple of things I need to do first.”
“That won’t be necessary, no.  What’s brought this on so suddenly though, if I may ask?  You’re still quite young, and in your prime.”
Holding up the small black bag that held the wrapped box, he asked Harry, “Could I leave this at your place, Harry? Since we’re having Christmas at yours, anyway, it would save me from not forgetting it on Friday.”
Harry laughed loudly before asking, “And, where are we going? What are we doing? Do I have to cook?”
was down this part of the alley, as well as some more higher end clothing stores.  Soon, he came up to the studio of
“We’ll always be here for you, mate, even when we all have grey hair and get hard of hearing and have to walk around with an ear horn like my great uncle Boris.”
Harry smiled before gently pulling her into a hug.  “Thanks, Professor.”  He hoped he could convey his thanks for the many years that she had bee a part of his life, always being a guiding hand.
“I was just wondering what you were going to be working on this weekend?  I know you said you finished the dining room last week, so I was wondering what was next?”
Draco gave him a questioning look, pulling his hand out of Harry’s, taking the ring off and looking at the etching on the inside: “I love you more.”  He started laughing, causing Harry to return the questioning look.  “Look at yours,” he said, wiping his eyes.
“Harry asked her to bring you?”  Draco was dumbfounded.  Harry knew enough about him to realized he would want his mother there?
Draco hesitated for a split second as Harry entered the bright, clean room.  He took a breath, and moved to sit across from Harry at the table.
They chatted a bit more as they finished their lunch, and then they all stood to say goodbye.  Hermione flooed out of the restaurant, which just left Ron and Harry, standing by the table.
Arthur stood up, and came over to stand in front of Harry, clasping his shoulders.  “The only thing you
Draco just shook his head with a small smile. He looked over at Weasley, who was staring at him with a slight glare, before he turned and looked at Dean.  “I'm looking for Harry.  Do you know where he is?”
“Too early,” Harry said as he turned over and blearily looked at Teddy.  “Are your nan and auntie awake, too?”
They stared at each other for long moments.   Draco watched as Harry’s adams apple moved as he took a gulp of the firewhiskey.  He tried to think of something to say in order to defuse the tension in the room, but he couldn’t think of where to start.  He took a sip of his own drink, hoping that it would loosen his vocal cords, but they continued to sit there in silence.
Draco smiled darkly at him, coming around the bed to wrap his arms around Harry’s waist.  “Happy Christmas, Mr Potter-Malfoy.”
“Well, it’s like real electricity, but it works with magic.  So, I can plug in things, like muggle lamps.” He walked over to the bedside table and showed them the lamp turning on and off, manually.  “And I can get muggle appliances for the kitchen.  But, then I can also use magic on them.”  With that, he waved his wand and the lamp turned on.
“I don't know, you tell me!  Telling him to call you ‘Harry’ for one.  Since when did you become on a first name basis with a Death Eater?!”
“Ron, mate, you know I love you both, right?  I have been there through all of the jealousy, and secret pining, and everything.  Trust me.  Once you tell her how much trouble you went through to get this, and how much she means to you, she wouldn’t care if it was a smaller version of
He had apologized to everyone, except for Harry.  Sure, they had talked a bit when Harry had given him his wand back, but he had never received an official apology like everyone else.  He didn’t know how he felt about that.
“They’re new,” George said.  “They have instructions in the box.  They are also not to be opened in present company,” George said quietly, with a wink.
“I won’t be able to come by tomorrow.  I’m supposed to have lunch with Pansy, and I need to spend some time with my mother.”
Telling his friends that he'd catch them up in a moment, he made his way toward the stacks in the back. Finding the aisle he was looking for, Harry started looking through the books about magical home renovations.  After finding five books that looked like they could be of some help, Harry began walking towards the front of the store, passing by the Transfiguration aisle.  He stopped and walked back into it, looking for a book about furniture transfiguring.
As the spaghetti was boiling, Draco opened a couple of the ‘junk’ drawers, as Ron liked to call them.  (“What?  They’re full of junk!  Random knobs!”)  Inside, he found some candles, and surprisingly a couple of bows.  He handed them to Teddy, who took them to the table and, standing on the bench, set them in the middle of the table, arranging them in a circle.
“Is…is uncle Harry doing better?”  He asked in a very soft voice, barely lifting his eyes to meet Draco’s.
Harry stepped out of the fireplace into a lush living room with sky blue walls, deep navy carpet, and beautiful purple plush chairs and a grey couch.  Lying in the center of a white blanket in the middle of the floor was Teddy.  Harry walked over to the child and picked him up.  It had taken a few months not to be absolutely terrified of holding the baby, and while Harry still didn’t know what he was doing, the child in his arms made him feel more confident and comfortable.  It was almost as if Teddy exuded trust onto Harry.
Andromeda passed Teddy to Harry, giving them both hugs, and Teddy a kiss on his head.  It took a bit more cajoling, but soon, she floo’d away, leaving Harry and Teddy alone.
“I came in to sit with you, but after awhile, Professor McGonagall asked if I would like some tea.  Harry said he would stay until you woke, so I’ve been talking with her, waiting for word.  She will allow me to use her floo to go back to the Manor, when I leave.
Pulling back, his aunt placed a palm on his cheek.  “It is an absolute pleasure to finally meet you.  I’m sorry I wasn’t around during your childhood.”
“Okay, I think that should be fine.”  Draco cast a gemino charm onto the parchment, making several copies.  “Who all are we inviting?  My parents, The Weasley’s—all of them?”  He looked up at Harry.
Harry looked at Draco.  While his tone was his usual snarkiness, his face showed a smile.  Harry smiled back saying, “Well, if you were to get a little bit of sun on that pale skin, you might be able to be seen.  Seriously, Malfoy, you look like a ghost!”
“Great!  Just let me change really quick.”  With that, Harry grabbed his clothes and stepped into the loo.  He washed his face, brushed his teeth, and tried to brush his hair.  He didn’t know why he even bothered, though.
The two of them were busy cleaning out the closet when Hermione came up with three cups of tea floating behind her.
“Get your knickers untwisted, darling.  That look isn’t your style anymore, not since you and Harry became an item all those years ago.”
Harry looked around the room at the people he loved the most.  He caught Draco’s eye from across the room and smiled.  Draco raised his eyebrows, and Harry shrugged one shoulder.
Harry wasn't sure what Draco was working on.  He had seen him talk with McGonagall the morning she had talked about the projects, and had only been seen at meals during the daylight hours, since.
Narcissa was the first one to reach Draco, but he soon was greeted one-by-one by all of his friends and family.
Harry had just finished his last exam, and was headed back towards the common room.  After studying practically non-stop all week, he thought a nap was in order.
Harry loved the size, because he had secretly hoped that one day, he would have someone to share a bath with.  And he’d found that person in Draco.
“Wait, I am?”  They each handed the other their wands, and stowed them away.  Draco went to step away, but Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him close.
After they put Teddy to bed in his room at Grimmauld (‘Can I spend the night? Nan won’t mind, I know it!’) they closed the door to their room.  Draco went into the en-suite to do his nightly routine, while Harry pulled out pajamas for them both, before he stepped into the bathroom and picked up his toothbrush, too.
“What a coincidence!  So did I!” Ron exclaimed from the top of the stairs.  Teddy giggled as he turned back to Harry, clutching his leg.
Draco smiled and quietly laughed.  “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you.  Everyone left while I was in the shower.”
Grabbing for his wand, he made sure his curtains were completely closed, and then cast a couple of spells so no could know what he was up to.  Slowly turning over, he pulled down his pajama pants, noting the wet spot that adorned the front of them.  His fully erect penis sprang up, slapping against his stomach.  His arousal was heady.  Carefully, he gripped his cock tightly.
“Fine, fine.  Come over tomorrow for dinner.  Depending on how much we can get done, maybe I'll even cook.”
As he sat there listening to Neville talk about Ginny, Harry something.  Maybe, just maybe, Draco fancied him, too.  He supposed only time would tell.
Draco ripped the paper off of the frame, and turned the photo over. His eyes got as big as saucers when he took in the photo of Greg, Vince, and himself walking through one of the courtyards, in what appeared to be third year. He apparently said something snarky, according to the look on his face, and delighted in himself when Vince and Greg guffawed.
“And I’m sure Auntie Andy would enjoy a break.  I can’t believe he’ll be going to Hogwarts next September.”
Draco rubbed his eyes, laying there a moment, looking up at the carefully crafted ceiling of his room.  He knew his mother would soon come in herself if he didn’t get up, though, so he begrudgingly pushed the duvet off of him, and stood.
It had occurred to him a couple of months before that his feelings for Draco had moved beyond just a ‘friend’ capacity.  He had had an epiphany in the middle of the night that spring, when he awoke from a very erotic dream starring Draco.  It suddenly all clicked in his head.  He
“Yes, love.  I’ve got everything in my bag, which is downstairs and ready to go when we get home this evening.  Portkey leaves at 6:45, so I will be home no later than 6:15.”
He knew that Ron had indeed had a chat with Harry, but he’d been so busy, he didn’t know if anything had come from it.
Draco wracked his brain, and suddenly said, “Actually, that’s not true.”  Harry quickly turned to Draco, who was giving him a knowing look.
“Mmm… Okay, wait, show me my present, and then I’ll give you yours. We never did get to do Christmas,” Harry said, kissing Draco once more before gently pushing the man off his lap.
Harry stood up, walking over to the desk in the corner.  Draco saw him pull out a sheet of parchment, dipping his quill in the ink and writing a short note to whom he assumed was Mr Ollivander.  Once he finished, he called for Kreacher.  The elf popped into the room, bowing to Harry.
He took the brochure from her hands, looking at the pictures of a picturesque villa, with a gazebo beside a large pond, with the sun setting in the background.  He had to admit it was beautiful, but one look at Draco’s face and he knew he shouldn’t say so.
He placed Teddy down on the changing table.  He pulled Teddy’s clothes off, quickly changing his diaper.  Pulling out the bag that Andromeda gave him, he unshrunk it and pulled out pyjamas.  After Teddy was dressed, Harry sat down in the rocking chair.  Teddy was continuing to yawn, but it took a few minutes of rocking for him to finally fall asleep.  Harry looked down at his godson, suddenly wondering if Sirius had ever done this with him.
“He’s incredible.”  Draco sighed.  “I don’t know how you’ve done it, Potter, but you have changed me into a cuddly, baby-loving person!”  To prove his point, he pulled Harry toward him, wrapping an arm around Harry’s torso.
His fingers brushed against his bollocks, and Draco let out the most beautiful noise Harry had ever heard.
As Draco’s back was pushed against the wall, he couldn’t stop himself from grinding his cock in to meet Harry’s.  He pushed his body up against his boyfriend’s.  Harry moved his hands to Draco’s hips.
“Oh, don’t give me that, Draco,” she hissed.  “You know we all only want what was is best for you.  For both of you.  Anyway, she said something was up with Harry.  What’s going on?”
“What?  You had to have known that.  I’m much too pretty to be going after birds.”  He batted his long lashes at Harry, which made the man blush and laugh.
Inside the box lay a beautiful glass dragon that curved along its body.  It sat upon two hind legs, and one front, the other in the air.  “It’s gorgeous,” Draco said.  “Wherever did you find it?”
Harry turned and saw that there was indeed a plate of eggs and bacon for him, and a bottle and small bowl of mashed banana and squash for Teddy.
It didn’t take long for them to find the rug that Harry had wanted, along with quite a few accent pieces to put around the room.  Draco did the Confundus charm yet again, shrunk the purchases, and put them in his pocket.
He pulled open the door to the closet, and revealed the extension charm that had been placed on the space, with empty shelves and drawers and cabinets.
McGonagall’s face softened a bit at the compliment.  “They have found the other two men that were involved in the incident on December 5
“This may be my favourite picture of myself that has ever been taken,” Harry said, looping his arm around Draco’s, slipping their fingers together.
years were packing their bags up and leaving the Potions classroom after their last double session before reviewing for exams began the next week.
“Harry! I didn't think you were going to be able to join us this evening?” Molly asked, standing up from her seat beside Arthur.
Draco just shook his head, a tear slipping down his cheek as he turned back and saw his mother and father standing at the front, both with smiles on their faces.
He stepped out into the Atrium, taking a deep breath, and made his way towards to lifts, hoping to get to his office before his annoying office mate, Drumpkin, or better yet, Pansy.  He knew she could read him like a book and didn’t know if he could handle her analyzing him right now.  He managed to get a lift to himself and closed his eyes as he descended to his level.
Finishing his breakfast, Harry started to walk back upstairs, glancing into every room as he went up.  Since they would have three weeks off during the Christmas holidays, he figured he might be able to get one room remodeled in that time.  He walked into the sitting room on the second floor.  This room was the first room that people saw when they stepped through the floo, so maybe this should be the first one on his list.
She sighed as she looked between the two of them.  “Not likely.  What kind of a guy would want to date a girl that is gone more than half the year, and when she is home, she is always at the pitch?”
Harry didn’t like the tone to his voice, and after the disagreements he had had with the man before, Harry knew that this wouldn’t be good.
“His brother has given me most of his photos, and when I went through them, I came across several good ones of Ron, Hermione, and me, as well as all of our friends and classmates. I gave framed ones to the Weasley’s at Christmas, and several to everyone that came last night. These, however,” he said, pointing to the ones beside Draco, “I thought you needed to have. Colin was definitely sneaky—and quite brave— for managing to not get caught taking these, if you ask me.
Walking into Teddy’s room, he pulled multiple things out of his pocket.  The store that they had gone into to look at the appliances was also a furniture store.  Harry decided to go ahead and get a few more pieces for Teddy’s room.  Unshrinking them, he levitated a changing table onto the wall beside the door, and a beautiful dark coloured wooden rocking chair into the corner.
“I know you didn’t do it, but at the time, I thought you had.  I’ll be honest—I was hoping that something terrible would happen to you.  Then you came back out of the maze with Diggory’s body, and I knew something terrible had indeed happened.  I didn’t know what to make of it, though.  Then, I received a letter from my mother the next day telling me that the Dark Lord was back.”
He gave her a look, but did as he was told.  He heard them shuffling off, and wanted to turn around, but he heard another set of footsteps join them, and held his breath.
“Works for me.  What kind of cuisine are you hungry for?  There is nearly every type of European food available.”
Draco sheepishly glanced at Harry, eyes growing dark as he took in Harry’s attire. He quickly skated up and down Harry’s frame, smirking, before turning back to Ron. “We forgot to strengthen the silencing spell.” He turned back to Harry, taking a step toward the stairs and sticking out his hand. Harry descended the rest of the way down the stairs, taking Draco’s hand.
“Come on, babe! Come for me! You have to come! I can’t hold out much longer! Dra—Draco! Gods! I love you!”
“No, and now I have the perfect excuse for kicking him in the arse!”  Harry laughed.  “When are you due?”
Draco stood there stunned for a few moments, before saying loud enough that Harry could hear him through the closed closet door, “Didn't know you had it in you.”
“We’ve been in the field the past few days, so we haven’t had much time to talk.  But I did notice he got a lot quieter Monday after we were called to a domestic dispute.  There were kids in the home, and it’s never easy to have to separate them from their families.  Maybe that’s what’s got him so down?”
“You’re going to need a coat, love.  Want to know why?  Because, ‘baby, it’s cold outside.’”  He swayed his hips as he sang the next line, grin across his face.
Harry looked into the steel grey eyes, not knowing what to say.  He looked at the floor, trying to wrap his mind around what he’d just been told.  After several long minutes, Harry looked up at Draco, took a step away from the wall and said, “Why could you not have told me all of this that morning, instead of just running away?”
Harry looked up at Ron, who looked gob smacked at Harry’s statement.  “I’m serious.  I am so incredibly tired of all of the fighting and hostility.  I’m done.  Besides, I honestly don’t believe Draco took the Mark willingly.  Do you?  Think of who his father is.”
Harry sat there, trying to wrap his mind around this information.  So, Draco wasn’t the master of the Elder Wand; this was good news.  However, he could use Draco’s wand and Draco could use his?  This was a conundrum.
“Nothing, nothing.  Don’t know why he cancelled though.  Do you know why?  Have you talked to him lately?”
Harry grabbed his cock, and gently pushed against Draco’s hole.  He slowly, teasingly breached him, pushing in an inch, and then pulling back out.
“Harry!  What are you doing here?”  Molly, Harry noted, was once again standing in front of the sink.
“Cold!  We made five snowmans, and mummy taught us about snow angels, and and!  Snow is cold!”  She sounded winded when she explained it all, as if she had been running.
“Thanks.  It’s been slow, since we’ve only been able to work on the weekends, but the main rooms are finished.  I’m hoping to have a few more rooms done by the time we go back to Hogwarts.  Feel free to look around.  There’s a tree in there,” he said pointing across the hall, “that has all of the presents, if you have any to add.  Molly is down in the kitchen, of course.  I need to go finish wrapping some gifts, so just make yourself at home!”
He was brought out of his pondering when Harry grabbed his ankle and tugged him onto the floor next to him. Hermione had removed the food from the bags that she and Ron had gotten from the restaurant, and had called for Kreacher, asking for plates and utensils.
“Hmmm.  That sounds lovely.  Or, we can just lay in bed all day.  I’m sure we can find something to do in here.”  He gave Draco a smirk.
Draco perked up at that, and so the two of them got off the bed, pulling on their shoes, and going back down to the kitchen.
Harry watched her face as tears streamed down Andromeda’s face.  She looked up at him, smiling, as she mouthed a “thank you,” at him.  He nodded, eyes filling with tears again.
Stepping into the kitchen, he saw that Kreacher was already hard at work cooking for the party the next day.  The tons of leftovers that Molly had left at Christmas had been used for several different things, and Harry was pleased that they all looked delicious.
Draco started attending pub nights with their classmates, and then started spending time with just the ‘golden trio,’ to his astonishment.  This caused him and Harry to get closer, as it seemed everyone was paired up except for them, so it was the next logical step.
“I talked with my mother, and she agreed that her aunt Walburga deserves to be with her family. My mother has portraits at the Manor of her parents and grand-parents, which are her,” he nodded toward the painting, “brother-in-law and mother- and father-in-law.
years were standing and grabbing their bags.  He quickly strode to the front, grabbing a few bacon sandwiches, and then walked beside Ron as they headed toward Charms.
Harry had taken Draco’s ring from him a couple days before, and had gone and gotten it engraved.  He slipped it onto Draco’s finger, who then took Harry’s hand, slipping a beautiful while gold ring with a simple line of yellow gold through the middle onto Harry’s finger.  He stretched his fingers, loving the feeling of it on his finger.
He pulled his foreskin back, touching the head.  His stuttered as he did that, and then continued to stroke himself.  It only took a few more times before he was shooting his load all over his hand and stomach, quietly moaning Draco’s name.  He continued to stroke himself through the pleasure.
“While I have no idea to what you are referring, I will say you are welcome. Now, I must be going; I have a project to finish before the rest of the students arrive.” He then bent in a bow, swiftly turning on his heel and continued his way up the stairs.
Harry recounted the story of giving Draco his wand back, and the extreme heat that emitted from the wand, into their hands and arms.  As he gave every detail that he could, Ollivander’s face went from concern to intrigue, to understanding.
“Greg was really the only other one that caught me losing control. He found me in the Slytherin fommon room one night. It was the night after the incident with Madam Rosmerta and Bell.”
Harry, feeling the light touch, got goose pimples down his arm.  Letting out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding, he started walking down the street, Draco falling in step beside him.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry said.  He still wasn’t sure how, but they had managed to keep their engagement out of the press, but he had a sick feeling in his gut that that photograph showed Draco’s ring, front and center.  “I think we’ve just been outed.”
One moment he was there, the next he wasn’t, which left Draco sputtering.  “Are you kidding me, Potter?!  A bloody invisibility cloak?  You are so going to…!”
“Bloody hell, mate! Don’t sneak up on a bloke like that!” Ron said, clutching his chest. “Wait—did we wake you up?”
“Sod off!  I told you it was ridiculous.”  It was an ornament of a Versailles Shoe, red frills with a gold tint around the edges and golden buckle with sapphires around it.
She nodded.  “32 years, now.  My mother decided that, as the only daughter, she would make my wedding the celebration of the century.  We just wanted something quiet, though.  ‘Big’ wasn’t really our thing, so we told our best friends, snuck off to Yorkshire, and got married in a country garden on the side of a hill.  It was beautiful.”
“What is it, Potter? Come expecting a thank you from me?”  The Malfoy scowl was prominent on his face after he spoke.  Harry had to suppress his eye roll.
“I agree,” McGonagall nodded.  “As they’ve gotten closer, the bond has picked up on that, and made them both more powerful wizards than they already were.  I know that you two gentlemen will do great and powerful things, once you’ve left Hogwarts.”
He smiled as he put on the trousers and shirt, and then turned to tie the tie, which was the exact same colour as his eyes.  He picked up the black robe, which was more of a suit jacket than wizard robe.  While loose, it was only as long as his torso, covering just as much as a jacket.  He liked the fit, though: part muggle and part wizard.
Don’t get him wrong, he still spent time with his old Slytherin cronies, but he now had a weekly gossip lunch with Hermione, Luna, Pansy, Astoria, and Ginny (when she can make it), a bi-weekly chess match with either Ron or Blaise, and Sunday dinner with all the Weasley’s.  His life was completely different than how he had ever imagined it would be, and he was grateful for it.
They had had one of the best conversations that Harry had ever had.  They talked about anything and everything.  It wasn’t until Tom came over that they realised they had been talking for nearly three hours.  Draco had immediately stiffened and with a speedy goodbye, had immediately disapparated.
Stepping into the room, Harry saw everything exactly how he had left it nearly two weeks before.  All of the cabinets had been taken down, and they had removed the counters and sinks.  The room looked like a shell of what it used to be.  Harry was eager about implementing the plans that he and Draco had come up with a few weeks before.
“Why would I know his daily plans?”  He hoped his voice didn’t express his anger, but from the looks on both his friends’ faces, he knew that it did.
He smiled to himself as they walked over to the sofa, Harry still holding Teddy, who was now fascinated with the lion Harry was bouncing in front of his face.
Draco nodded mutely, looking at the floor.  He paused for a split second, but then straightened and walked out of the room, shutting the door quietly behind him.
He grinned at her as he opened the wrapping.  Inside was a leather arm holster for a wand.  It was a simple gift, but exactly what he wanted; he had put a holster on his mental shopping list just the other day.
“Thanks.  I appreciate it.”  Nodding his head, Draco grabbed a handful of powder, stepped into the fireplace, and disappeared in a swirl of green flames.
THAT BEING SAID, I'm really excited to be doing this fest again this year!  I kept telling myself that I was going to write the story in its entirety, and then I'd only have to post it!  Yeah, well, that definitely didn't happen... So, I may be late, and I may have to double up on pics, but IT WILL GET DONE, I PROMISE!
“Well, it doesn’t help that we are awful godparents, and spoil our godchildren rotten.  How many gifts did Rosie get?”
“Do what?” Harry cast for his clothes, putting them on and walking to stand in front of Draco, who was still avoiding looking at Harry.  “Do what, Draco?”
Taking the parchment from him, Harry grabbed a piece of bacon off the plate and gave it to the bird.  Unraveling the letter, he first noticed the familiar elegant scrawl.  Then he read the words:
Standing in front of the mirror, he thought about the last few months and how much his life had changed in such a short time.
“Just—just let me sleep on all that you’ve told me, okay?  I’ll see you Thursday, and maybe we can talk some more.”
Harry sighed, grateful that the man standing before him recognized the situation.  “Exactly.  It belongs with Dumbledore, and that is where it should stay.”  Receiving a head nod from Malfoy, Harry continued.  “Mr. Ollivander gave me instructions on how to do this.  I will cast a spell on the wand, then I will say ‘I surrender the powers that be’ and hand it to you, in which you say ‘I claim the powers that be’ and take the wand.  Okay?”
He heard Ron groan from across the room, and then he heard a gasp and sigh coming from his bed; Draco had given him a Hangover Potion, as well.  It appeared he was making the rounds in their dorm, as he heard Neville next.  He smiled to himself, then got out of bed.
“We felt it again when we…when we kissed for the first time.”  Draco said the last few words in a rush.  He didn’t dare look up to see his mother’s face, knowing with certainty that she was giving him a smirk.
As he began walking towards the gates, he saw Hagrid out with Fang, and made a mental note to go visit him the next day after class.  Harry was excited about classes, because after talking with McGonagall, he was taking a lighter load.  Although he no longer had aspirations to be an Auror, he decided to go ahead and take Potions. Charms, D.A.D.A., Transfiguration, and Herbology rounded out the rest of his classes.  He at first wasn't sure about Defense, but then decided, if nothing else, it would be an easy O.
Hermione nodded, and gestured to their left.  A thestral-led carriage stood there, waiting for them.  He turned back to his friends, and smiled, walking toward it.  Helping Hermione in, he and Ron followed and they were off, headed for the front door.
Harry must have sensed something was off, though, because he turned and looked at Draco.  “Hey, what’s wrong?”
Harry stood and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waste, sliding his fingers into the back pockets of Draco’s denims.  “That can be arranged, soon-to-be Mr Malfoy-Potter.”  He swiped his tongue against the crease of Draco’s lips.  “Would you like your Christmas present a couple days early?”
Harry stepped off the ladder, and walked over to Draco.   “It’s the ‘maybe more’ that makes me not want to tell you.  Trust me when I say it’s better off not said right now.”
He took a piece of paper out of his pocket as well, quickly looking over the instructions.  Waving his wand and chanting the incantation on the page, he was pleased to see the tree grow back to its normal size, snow and fairy lights included.  He cast another charm over it to make sure the snow didn’t melt.
Andromeda had come back to pick up Teddy just as Harry and Draco had finished putting in the new appliances, counters, and sinks.  Harry had convinced her to stay for dinner, and so she and Draco, who held Teddy throughout the meal, talked while Harry cooked.
Draco slowly awoke.  He felt a warmth pressed against his back, and an arm wrapped around his stomach.  He was confused for a moment, but then memories of the night before flooded his brain.  He felt a surge of anger as he remembered the conversations, and then an embarrassed heat appeared on his face as he remembered flooing to the first place he could think of: Grimmauld.
They lay there for several long moments, just looking at each other, Harry lightly scratching Draco’s back.
“No.”  Harry pulled away, causing Draco to sit up.  He gave him a confused look.  “No, I know you love me, but Draco…”  He paused, looking away, before taking a deep breath and getting off of the bed.
Kinglsey sighed.  “Very well.  We will begin with Mr Rooks’ tesitimony.  Sir?”  He gestured for the first man to sit in the chair in the middle of the floor, facing the risers.
Harry could feel how tense Draco was, sitting in the middle of the table, and was about to involve him in conversation, when he heard the rustling of feathers as a few owls came in through the ceiling.  Harry glanced up and saw that his owl was making his way towards the table.  He wasn’t expecting anything, so he wasn’t prepared for the owl to land right in front of his plate, holding a letter.
They suddenly felt a hand on each of their shoulders, and turned to see Minerva standing behind them.
Draco, who was still breathing hard, and whose eyes were closed, slowly opened one eye to look up at Harry.
Harry could see Ron’s shoulders sag with relief, before he, too, leant into Hermione.  They pulled apart, Ron taking the box out of her hand.  He undid the chain from the packaging, holding it up in order to clasp it around Hermione’s neck.  She pulled her hair up, and as soon as Ron had fastened it, Hermione clutched it with the fingers of her right hand, grabbing Ron’s hand with her left.
“Harry, please repeat after me.”  She spoke, and he copied her words, looking at Draco and gripping his hands.
Harry grinned at Blaise, before he looked back over and saw Draco give Hermione a hug, and shake Ron’s hand, before all three of them came towards him.
Blaise started talking, and Harry just let the sounds from around the table wash over him.  He sipped his drink, laughing at the right times, but overall, just enjoying having Draco beside him.
“Salazar, I seriously thought you were going to slam into me,” he said as he watched his picture self swiftly moving out of the way, just as Harry reached out and grabbed the snitch out of the air. “And, I recall you not getting the snitch a few times.”
He made his way back to his office, being stopped several more times.  Beverly looked up as he walked past her, and he gave her a questioning look.
“That’s great!  So, why are you just now getting back?  If it was that easy, you should have been back before lunch.”
Just before the Quidditch pitch, Harry made his way over to the new monument that stood just off the path.  He walked around to the other side, and finding what he was looking for, stared longingly at his mother’s name, before touching it and the name of his father, etched in the marble.  He then walked back over to the path, where Draco was still standing, watching the raven-haired man.
“No, my appointments are on Tuesday and Friday evenings.  And my classes are on Monday and Thursday.  I… er… when I need to get out of my head on the other nights, I take my cloak and just walk around.  A couple of times, I apparated to the coast, and just stared at the ocean for hours at a time.  One time I went to Shell Cottage, under my cloak, and sat at Dobby’s grave.”
He hadn't really gotten the chance to look at the room when he was there two days before, so now he took a moment to admire it.  Harry had done a brilliant job; the room looked elegant, while also seeming wonderfully comfortable.  As he stood there, he could mentally see Harry and himself snuggling on one of the couches, talking, or just enjoying each other's company.
“I love you, too.  You have just made me the happiest man.”  He couldn’t resist leaning back in for another languid kiss.  When they finally pulled apart, Draco automatically looked down at his hand.
Draco pulled back, and really looked at Harry’s face; at the worry lines that peaked out of his eyes, and across his forehead.  “Don’t do that.”
She glanced around then, suddenly realising what Harry was talking about.  “I don’t know, but I suspect they’ll be down in the courtroom.”
Ron and Hermione walked out of the sitting room and made their way down to the kitchen, where Harry and Draco had finished taking off all of the wallpaper and had torn out the walls surrounding Kreacher’s nest.  They had cast an enlargening charm to create a larger space for the elf.
The women looked like she would rather be anywhere else.  She shook her head quickly back and forth, not even daring to look Harry in the eye.  “I—I don’t deserve—”
Ron and Harry walked up the steps of number 12.  Harry lifted his hand, unlocking the door, quickly getting out of the chilled air, that seemed to be getting colder as the sun began to set.
Draco woke to sun blazing through the open curtains, which was a new experience for him.  It took him a few moments of to realise where he was, and then he was suddenly wide awake and sitting up in the bed, looking for Harry.
Teddy’s giggle at how they said it in sync.  He turned back to go sit at the table, but before he could, he was picked up from behind by Harry, who started squeezing him in a hug.  Draco picked his feet up, and together they started tickling and kissing him.
“She gave me a clean bill of health, though, so there’s that.”  He looked again around the common room.  “Where is everyone?  I figured they would all be here, studying.”
Ron, Hermione, and Susan were working on a statue that was to be placed on the road, just after the Quidditch pitch.  Hermione told Harry that it was to have every name of the people that had been killed under Voldemort’s rein of horror, which included the first war; James and Lily Potter’s names would be on it.
After getting checked in, the made their way towards their suite; Harry had managed to get the same room that they had when they were on their honeymoon.  As soon as they walked in, Draco couldn’t stop smiling.
.  It’s just like I remembered.”  He turned back and, waving his wand, their bags unpacked themselves, clothes settling in the drawers of the armoire, toiletries floating towards the en-suite.
Draco searched his face, trying to find any evidence of betrayal, but instead saw nothing but fear and sorrow.  He scooted back on the bench so he could see Harry clearly, and nodded his head.
Seeing Draco give him a side look, he said “Huh? Oh, nothing. Hermione just has him whipped.”  He glanced and saw that Ron had his arm wrapped around her back, whispering something in her ear.  She laughed and lightly slapped his arm.  Suddenly, an intense longing surfaced in Harry’s chest.
Ron followed him over to the till, speaking to the man as if they were old friends.  Once he had paid, Ron shook the man’s hand and walked back over to Harry, smile still large on his face.
“McGonagall said he couldn’t have apparated, because as part of his probation, the Ministry would have called him in for questioning if he had.  We confirmed, when I went to talk to Ollivander, that he called out for
Harry took a deep breath, staring at the table.  “I… Baby, I’m so sorry.”  He looked up at Draco.  “I know I haven’t been myself lately, and I’ve been ignoring you, and starting fights.  I never meant for you—”
He placed the last file onto the corner of the desk, and stood up, stretching.  He grabbed his cloak off of the hook by the door, and walked out.  “I’m out, Bev.  Go home.”
“Oh, we are so using it again, but right now, I need you.”  He reached around Draco’s waist, untying the reindeer, and then gripped his cock, sliding the cover off.
“Well, that’s a way to finish my birthday morning,” Harry said, glancing at the inquiring faces of his friends.  “The Malfoy trials are over.  Narcissa is to receive 6 months of house arrest, Lucius will be in Azkaban for 1 year, and Draco will be on probation while he finishes his Hogwarts education.”
Once they stepped back, Harry continued.  “Yeah, that was my plan, anyway.  I’m going to fix up the other bath, and then this room is Teddy’s.  Draco painted it awhile back, but then we moved on to other rooms, and it never got completely finished.  It does have a cot, though, in case Andy needs a break.”  He opened the door and showed them the pale green room, with plush carpet, and a white cot against the far wall.
“Harry! It’s been a while,” Kingsley boomed, walking over to them.  “Mrs Malfoy, Mr Malfoy, Professor,” he nodded to each of them.
He could feel Draco’s fingers tugging on his own hair, and then sensed a thrill run through him as he felt a warm hand make its way under his t-shirt, onto his bare back.
“Oh, Harry.  Of course it matters.  I haven’t seen you that happy in…well, a long time.  What happened?”
“Oh, nothing.  It’s just every time I walk through Diagon, lately, I get accosted by hordes of people.  I came Monday to speak with Ollivander, and was practically attacked as Professor McGonagall and I left.”  He shook his head.
Draco could tell his voice was beginning to wobble.  “Oh, Ted.  Come here.”  He put his arms out and watched as Teddy scrambled around the bench to slide in beside him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s middle.  He heard a quiet sob, and just held him, sliding his fingers through his hair.
Harry, left arm still wrapped around Draco’s back, reached over with his right, picked up the blocks of cheese, placed them on the platter, picked up the knife he was using to cut them up, stabbed it into one of the blocks, and then thrust it out for Hermione to come get.
Harry didn’t want to admit it to himself, but he missed Draco.  He missed his scent.  He missed his hand in Harry’s.  He missed his smile, and
Harry just grinned at the trio before him.  “Great!  I don’t have the first clue as to what to do, so I appreciate all the help I can get.”
Shaking his head, he sent a spell at the stack of packages on the bed, making them float in front of him as he made his way down to the lounge.
“I like the way you think, Mione!  Ron, go get some blankets out of the closet, and I’ll go get the cocoa.”
“It’s really good.  Want to try a sip?”  He handed the last dredges over to Hermione, who took a sip and then handed it to Pansy.
It absolutely amazed him how comfortable Draco was around him, and he with Draco, too.  Like Draco had just said, there was over seven years of the fighting mentality ingrained in their heads.  After all these years, the names Potter and Malfoy side-by-side created a sense of foreboding in the minds of the wizarding community.  Everyone knew about their rivalry.  How would the public take the news that they were now a couple?  Hell, what would they think about the fact that Harry was gay?
Harry carded his fingers through Draco’s, pulling his hand towards him and giving the top of it a kiss.  “You really like it?” he asked, quietly.
Harry woke with a start.  He blearily reached over to the night stand for his glasses and his watch.  After putting on the glasses, he looked to see what time it was.  It was 7:20.  AM or PM, he didn’t know.  Glancing out the window didn’t help him much, either.  As he became aware of his surroundings, memories of the night before started coming back.
“Well, let’s go see what the rooms are like,” Harry said to the others.  He walked through the door, went up a set of stairs and came into a short hallway.  There were two doors that faced each other, each with a plaque on the door; the door on the left said ‘One’ and the right said ‘Two.’
A few minutes later, Harry and Draco heard noise.  Slowly breaking apart, they saw Kreacher standing behind them.
He had so far received several bottles of expensive wine and Fire Whiskey, several books, a pillow that said ‘Cuddle Weather’ (“Any weather is cuddle weather when you have the right partner,” Luna said) and a set of snitches that could be called back to their owner.
“You’re in a chipper mood.  What do you want or what did you do?”  He schooled his face, hoping that she would see he wasn’t in the mood to chat, and he could get to work.
“Mr Potter!  What a surprise!  To what do I owe the pleasure?  Did everything go as planned returning the wand?”
Harry stepped through the floo.  He dusted himself off, shaking his head to try and get the dust out of it.  He had used one of the Auror floo’s, and they were exceptionally dirty.
Harry just shrugged his shoulders, and heard as the rest of the group moved into the hall and sat down.  He moved down a spot, so Zabini—Blaise—could sit down across from Draco.  Parkinson—
He gripped Harry’s hand, swinging it back and forth.  This was exactly what they needed: just to be with each other.
“Not until this is all over with,” he said with a sigh.  “I wish there was something more I could do for him.”
“Oh, har har, Malfoy. Whether you want to believe it or not, I hate the attention.  It is so disconcerting.”
Kreacher had completely outdone himself.  There was an entire Christmas feast laid out on the table, including a full turkey, casseroles, pies of every kind imaginable, and fruit salads.  There were trays upon trays of nibbles, too.
“I honestly have no idea, but we definitely need to have a talk.  Hopefully he will come to the party.”  He sighed as he looked down at his shoes.
He gently waved back, relief flooding him as he realized she was telling him where Harry was. Mouthing a “thank you” towards her with a nod, he turned and moved towards the stairs.
Draco looked down at Harry as he was washing Draco.  “Oh my gods.  That was a—amazing.”  He was still shaking with aftershocks.
“Again, no more apologies!  Oh, I can already picture the front of the resort with snow on the ground, and a Christmas tree all lit up!  When are we going?”  His face grew serious as he started imagining all of the things he would need to pack, and what he would need to get done before they left.
He shaved, and then hopped into the shower, taking his time in cleaning himself.  Stepping out, he cast a drying charm on his body.  He walked out into the room to put on pants and an undershirt.  He stared at the clothing that they had purchased to other day.
“That won’t be necessary,” Harry said harshly, arms crossed against his chest.  “I’ll figure out a way to make sure you get it back, and that you are filled in on what is learned, today.  There’s no reason for you to come here.”
Harry walked out of the room, going down to the lounge.  He pulled out a piece of parchment, quickly writing an answer back.  He raced back up to where the owl still sat, tying on his response and giving the bird an owl treat that he had found on the desk.
He quickly shaved and then got dressed.  Before he knew it, he and Draco were standing by the front door waiting on McGonagall.  At exactly 8:30, she stepped out of the Great Hall, with a stack of toast on a plate in her hands.
Draco smiled.  “I know how much this place means to you.  This was your first real home.  This was where you made the first friends you ever had.  This is where all the important moments of your life occurred.”
“I also don’t want to even think about the report from Gringott’s telling us how little gold we have left, now.”
Draco was jostled along, getting more and more agitated.  Finally, Harry stopped them.  He manoeuvred Draco around, finally releasing him.
Harry just hummed, feeling the signs of sleep pulling at him.  Just as he was about to dip into slumber, though, his stomach growled, making them both startle.
Hermione didn’t really want to talk about what she had had to do to convince them to come back to England with them.  He just knew that it had only taken them three weeks, and then they were back and she had taken her parents to St. Mungo’s.  They had only been in hospital for about a week when Hermione walked in to see how they were and her mother screeched, “Hermione!” and engulfed her in a hug.
Harry smiled at him as they walked out of the dorm.  Waving towards their classmates, they made their way out into the corridor.  The got as far as the first floor, when they heard a “Mr Potter. Mr Malfoy,” coming from behind them.  Stopping, they turned and saw Professor McGonagall coming towards them.
Harry sighed as he perched onto the edge of the desk.  “And how do you suppose we do that?  Draco’s mother has already half-planned an October wedding.”  He rubbed his face under his glasses.  “I don’t know what we’re going to do.”
Harry took another gulp of the amber liquid, and realized he was definitely starting to feel the effects.  His limbs were looser, and he felt as if he was beginning to float.
“So, Millie and I went and checked it out.  Didn’t find anything suspicious, which relieved the shopkeeper, but did find some amazing books.  Saw that one and thought of you, and then found several for Hermione.”
He slid forward and wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, who clutched tightly to the back of Harry’s shirt.  He sobbed; this was the first time Harry had hugged him in months.
, he thought.  He sighed as he sat up on the couch, rubbing his face.  Another day, another excuse from his husband.
Smiling shyly up at Arthur, Harry picked up a broken torch sitting on a shelf.  “I flooed in a couple of hours ago…” Harry spoke the last words in an elongated way.
Teddy pondered that for a moment, and then said, “Tell me about playing Quidditch together at Hogwarts.”
Looking around, Harry wondered what kind of things they would be doing in Potions this year.  He didn’t know why he was still going to be taking the class, as he had decided not to go into Auror training; after writing to Professor McGonagall, it was decided that he should stay the course.  Keeping his schedule meant that he could pursue quite an array of career options.
Malfoy gripped the wand, his fingers grazing Harry’s.  “I claim the powers that be,” he said.  Harry knew when the magic was complete, but as he tried to let go of the wand, he felt like his hand was working on its own accord; he could not release the wand.  It suddenly felt as if his entire left arm was going to burn to a crisp.  With all of his might, he pulled his arm back.  Malfoy’s face scrunched up, telling Harry that he was feeling the same thing.  He gave a loud yelp, his eyes widening, just as Harry finally let go of the wand.
“I wasn't planning on it, but something came up and I really need to talk to Ron and Hermione,” he said, gesturing with his head to the couple that were sitting on the couch.
Harry looked down at Teddy.  “He’s got a point.  You’re doomed, kiddo.”  All three of them laughed at that.
Also, if anyone wants to see what I had in mind for Hermione's pendant, you can go to https://www.flickr.com/gp/nsusweets/790468.  It's really hard to put down on paper what is in my head, but it's a decent match!
“I honestly think that was the most fun day I have ever had.  He’s been practicing keeping his features static, so he decided he wanted to spend the day as a muggle.  At first I was terrified, but then I realized that we go out so often, I wouldn’t have a problem.  It was keeping your six-year-old godson occupied, that would be the most difficult.”
Harry waited until everyone had settled back against their seats, and started talking amongst themselves again before he reached for the glass of firewhiskey Ron had gotten him.  He swiped a couple of chips out of Seamus’ basket, and idly flicked his eyes toward the door.
Harry tried to focus on the conversations around him as they continued to rib on Neville and Hannah, but his eyes kept flicking to the door at every slight movement.  He laughed along with Blaise when Ron belched loudly.  He smiled when he caught Hermione’s eyes, too.  But, he was beginning to get antsy.
“Oh, you know, the usual: eat lots of sweets, fly brooms around the city, buy out Weasley Wheezes.  That sort of thing,” Harry said with a smile and a wink at Teddy.
“Piss off,” Draco said.  Harry could tell he was smiling, though.  “I’ll find something to do.  Maybe I’ll attempt to make that raspberry cake Molly was telling us about.”
Harry quickly stood, grinning wide, and after quickly brushing the snow from his trousers, moved to scoop Draco into his arms, kissing him over and over again.  Someone cat-called at them as they walked past the two lovers.
A gasp issued from Harry’s mouth as Draco began using his tongue to lick under his earlobe.  Draco continued to lick, and then began giving open-mouth kisses where he had been licking.  Harry suddenly turned in Draco’s arms, and attacked his mouth.  Their tongues danced against each other, each trying to gain control.
“Uncle Ron! Gramma said you need to pass these around to ‘hold off the day-loop that she knows is coming, as supper has been pushed back a few minutes.’”
“Deconstruction, while the most fun, is also the messiest part of the job.  It’ll look amazing in a few days, though!” Harry beamed at his best friends.
“Of course you didn't. It doesn't matter to you. Saint Potter. Anyway, I will be at your house at 11:00 on Friday, and then I'll be on my way.  What is your address?”
The two men who sat opposite her knew better than to tell her that she didn’t have to go to so much trouble, and obediently took a few sandwiches and cakes each.  Harry looked down at his hot chocolate and saw that Molly had made the marshmallows look like little snowmen.  He was sure she had some on hand because Victoire, Bill and Fleur’s daughter, was over all of the time.
“Oh, that precious boy.  Well, come in for a spot, and tell me,” Molly exclaimed as she walked back into the kitchen.  Ron and Harry followed her in.  Walking up to the table, Harry could see Ginny sitting out on the bench in the garden.
He shook his head, compelling the warmth that had risen in his chest to calm down; he had to convince Harry that he still wanted to be in a relationship before he could imagine things like that.
Draco sighed in defeat, pulling back and chuckling at the look on Harry’s face.  “Perfect timing, as always.”
"Yeah, yeah," Harry laughed, but he could see the wetness in Draco’s eyes.  He could feel it in his own, as well.  He grabbed his wand and duffle bag, and started down the stairs.
Receiving nods of agreement from the students in front of her, she beckoned for them to follow her.  “Alright, let me show you the 8
It didn’t take long before he felt the pressure forming in his bollocks and lower back, and with two more tugs, imagining Draco laying beneath him in bed, Harry came with Draco’s name on his lips.
Draco was looking at him like he grown an extra head.  “You just never cease to amaze me, is all.  I’ll—I’ll think about it.  Bye.”  With that, he turned and descended the stairs.
Teddy’s eyes lit up with curiosity, and once they walked up to the edge and he saw what it was, he got a look of determination in his eyes.
They were in the sitting room, finishing decorating for Christmas, getting the stockings hung and putting all the presents under the tree, as they would be busy the following day.
Draco looked down at Harry’s large flaccid cock that lay between his legs.  “Oh, you most definitely are.  Yet another reason why you won’t be able to get rid of me now,” he added looking back up into Harry’s sparkling eyes.
Harry burst into laughter at that, leaning over to kiss Draco again.  “Are you comparing my arse to a gorilla’s bum?”
“You shouldn’t have any problems with him today,” Harry whispered to Molly.  “We have an understanding,” he added with a smile.
“Right.  I believe Molly will be there, too.  This shall be interesting.”  He kissed Harry again, and then stepped back and apparated to Gringotts.
Still, it was nice to cuddle, and wake up in each other’s arms, and continue with that heavy snogging.  It had also helped them both with their nightmares, which had occurred every night since their return.  Which was why Draco’s heart was beginning to pound even harder in his chest, before the curtains were pulled back and Harry slipped back under the comforter.
Harry pulled back slowly and said, “You think?  Maybe I will.”  They stood there another couple of seconds, just staring at each other, before Harry said, “While I would rather just stay here and continue kissing you, I figure we’d better get down there.”  He leaned forward again, giving Draco a quick peck.
“Harry, let me explain, please.”  Draco had stepped into the room, raising his hands into what Harry could instantly see as a begging stance.
The next thing he knew, Draco was being woken up again to a giggling Teddy, who was in the midst of a tickle fight with Harry.  He blearily opened his eyes, smiling at the two in front of him.
Harry went down to the dining room, making sure everything was perfect.  He had bought a smaller tree that he had put in there, just to give the room a festive look.  He had had a lot of fun buying the decorations, too.  He had never been allowed to touch the decorations when he was younger, because Aunt Petunia had a specific way she wanted the tree to be set up, so he had spent a lot of time the past few days going to different shops and picking out beautiful glass baubles and twinkling fairy lights.
They tried to apparate away, but there were too many people that were touching them, and they knew someone would be splinched if they attempted it.  They had nothing they could do but to try and run back towards the house, but not before Draco got hit with a stinging hex, and fell into the snow.  Harry helped him up and they staggered up the walkway and through the wards.
She flipped around in her seat, aiming her wand at Harry, who instinctively threw his hands up in the air.  She realized what she had done, and immediately tossed her wand onto the desk.
They turned back towards the alley that Harry had brought them to as Draco said, “I love the sound of that.  ‘Hello, my name is Draco Malfoy, and I am Harry Potter’s fiancé!’”
“Me, too,” he said against his lips.  “So close.  But I need you to come first.  Come on, Draco, come on, I need you to come for me.”
Harry didn’t know where that had come from.  Draco was still holding his hand and smiling as Harry looked over at him with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.  All that could come out of his mouth as a hissed, “What?”
Draco leaned over and whispered in Harry’s ear, “I think he either missed you, or is really excited about hosting a festive party.  I’m thinking both, though.”
“I would, but Kreacher was going to cook.  Thank you, though.  I’ll just go see Arthur before I leave.”  Getting up, Harry walked around the table and gave Molly a quick kiss on the cheek.  “See you Friday, Ron.”
The two chatted as Ron led the way towards the shop.  As they approached, Harry saw that it was named
“Oh, so this is that new?  The morning after, in hospital, I had thought that it had been going on much longer.”
“Of course that’s a yes!” he exclaimed.  He suddenly realized that he was standing in the middle of Diagon Alley with Harry sodding Potter, of all people.  Quickly schooling his features, he said, “What I mean is, of course I would like to acquire my wand back from you.”
He sighed as he cast a tent into place.  He missed those days, if he were being honest with himself.  He missed his Harry.
Harry stood panting at the foot of the bed, watching the gorgeous blond that lay before him.  With a flick of his wand, both of their clothes were stripped from their bodies, landing gracefully folded onto the chair in the corner of the room.
“I’ll take that as a no,” Draco said after several moments of snogging.  “However, in order to get your surprise, you have to give me a couple of minutes to get it ready, okay?”
“What? I'm not allowed to joke about it?” Harry winked at his friends, which caused Hermione to reach over and smack his leg.
He glanced up as Draco walked towards them.  Seamus turned when he saw George look, and yelled, “Malfoy! ‘Bout time ya show’d up!”
Draco looked up at him.  “Are you mad, Potter?  It’s probably not wise for you to be associating with me.  Your friends are going to turn against you.”
Year living quarters.  Because you all are a special circumstance, it was decided to take a part of the castle and form your own quarters, instead of trying to make extra space in the houses.”
“I love you, more,” Draco said, sliding his hand into Harry’s hair and bringing him back down into another kiss.
Draco was correct in that he knew that once Andromeda asked Narcissa to go with them, she would break and agree to go.  She tried only briefly to say that Molly wouldn’t need another mouth to feed, when Draco told her that there would still be plenty of leftovers, and it would help alleviate Molly forcing them to take it home, if only by one plate.
“What are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Hermione jumped from her seat and put her plate in the sink.  She went over and gave Ron a kiss on the cheek, and then started bouncing on the balls of her feet.
He made his way down to the atrium, and floo’d directly to the Manor sitting room.  As he stepped out of the fireplace, he saw Draco and Narcissa in a face off.  He quickly dusted himself off before making his way towards the two Malfoy’s.
“Just think of this as proposal, part two, okay?  Because, while you have said yes to marrying me, I’m hoping that you will also say yes to moving in with me.”
He went to his makeshift closet and pulled on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt.  He really needed to go shopping and buy himself some clothes that actually fit him.  He was no longer in hiding, and shouldn’t still be wearing his cousin’s old clothes.  It helped that he had finally been able to convince the goblins at Gringott’s to let him have access to his vault, again.  It was nice to have such people as the Minister of Magic as a reference for you.
Harry walked through the common room, heading for their dorm.  He laid his school bag on his chair, pulled off his robe, and un-did his tie.
Did he always have to be such an arse?  Harry considered just turning around and walking away, but then he remembered the conversation from the morning of his birthday; he didn’t want to fight anymore.
“Honestly, Draco.  That is your kin.  I will admit, though, she doesn’t seem to have changed much from the last time I saw her.”
“No! This was supposed to be your present, and it was supposed to be a surprise! You are not to do anything, except go upstairs and watch the velytision,” Draco said, pulling Harry up from the step and pushing him up the stairs.
“Thanks.”  He smiled at him.  “So, that’s the bedroom.”  He walked out onto the landing, and showed them the paint he had done on the walls and doors.  “Since I took the second room up here and made it into the en-suite, I had to take out the door and put up a wall, instead.  Can you figure out where it used to be?”  He smiled as his friends went and tried to remember where the door used to be.  If Harry was honest, he was quite enjoying seeing his friends impressed with what he had done.
Draco tensed as he mentally prepared himself for the conversation he knew was coming once they were alone again.
Mr Stotts gestured for McGonagall and Harry to join Narcissa, and Harry reluctantly let go of Draco’s hand and went to sit down.
to die that night.  I carry the deaths that occurred that night with me every day.  And believe it or not, I am glad that you are not part of that.”
Harry gave them a wave, and left.  Walking into the library, he was pleased to see it was nearly empty.  All of the younger students were in class, and it seemed those that had a free period were not inclined to do work.
Harry laughed as he walked over to the drawer closest to the refrigerator, pulling out his money bag.
“Thank you, Harry, for the wonderful meal.  And thank you, too, for taking care of Teddy today.  I did not expect to see Narcissa this morning, but I am so glad I did.”
“Shit! Oh, shit! Harry!”  Draco released Harry’s mouth, throwing his head back in ecstasy.  Harry attached his lips to the creamy skin of the pale neck laid out before him.
It wasn’t really Hermione that he was worried about, though.  When he told Ron, at first, he thought it was a joke.  When Harry didn’t laugh along, though, Ron knew that he was serious.  It took him a moment, but when he informed Harry, “I just don’t want any intimate details,” Harry knew they would be fine.
Harry gripped her hand in his, making her look up at him.  “No more.”  She nodded her head, shaking Harry’s hand at the same time.  Harry nodded back at her, then turned and looked at Bulstrode.  “No more?”  She looked down at his hand, and nervously took it.  “Okay.”
Draco’s grip grew tighter against Harry’s the more they descended down, and Harry fought to keep feeling in that hand as the door opened, and they were caught my dozens of cameras being shoved in their faces.  McGonagall took the lead, literally pushing several people out of their way as they walked towards to double doors that would lead into the courtroom.
Harry stood in front of his mirror, buttoning up his shirt; this one in particular was Draco’s favourite, so what was better to wear on their first date in nearly five months?
They both looked around the room, avoiding looking at each other.  Finally, Draco said, “Well, I should probably go.  Um, if you want any more help with anything, let me know.  I’ll talk with my mother about looking at the furniture.”
Draco stood there for a beat, and then said, “Don’t worry.  I’ve got an idea.” Draco gave Harry a wicked smile.
Harry chuckled as he stood and went to his desk.  “Well, you do look mighty sexy with knitting needles in your hands.”
“I agree as well,” Kingsley said with a smile.  “Let me be the first in line to offer you both a position in the ministry when you get finished with your N.E.W.T.S.”
Nodding, Draco said, “I’ll ask her when I get home.”  They continued walking, but then Draco suddenly stopped, his mind catching up with what Harry had said.  “You…you talked to my Aunt Andromeda?”
“Enough apologising.  I understand why you did what you did.”  They were quiet for a few moments, just holding each other.  “Just… just promise me you’ll talk to me if something like this happens again?  You don’t have to do this alone.”
Kingsley sat still for a moment, eyes wide, before he jumped up with far more agility than Harry had seen any other man of his size do.  He swiftly moved around his desk before gripping Harry’s hand in a firm handshake, and then pulled him to his feet in order to give him a hug, hand clapping hard onto Harry’s back.
“Well, McGonagall received news from the Ministry last weekend that someone else had been arrested in connection with the attack on the Knight Bus.  He gave a statement, where he said that Malfoy spoke out loud and then disappeared in a ball of light.
Harry’s eyes wandered the room until he saw movement out of the corner of his eye, and upon turning, saw a young woman, a little older than him, come out from behind a black curtain on the back wall.
Harry was pleased to see Draco’s eyes widen and a smile grow wide on his face.  Marcella’s was a muggle Italian restaurant that they had had their first proper date at.  It quickly became their place to go to celebrate big events.  They went there when Draco was promoted to Bill Weasley’s second-in-command curse breaker.  They went there when Harry was promoted to Head of his Auror department.  They went there when Lucius finally accepted that Harry and Draco were together, and no matter what he did, he couldn’t change that fact.  It was ‘their place.’
Once they had showered and dressed, they decided to check out what the resort’s scheduled activities were.  They chatted with the same young woman that had checked them in the day before and decided to take a sleigh ride.
It had taken him a few times (and a bit of magic) but once he saw how elegant it was, and knowing that he had done it with his own two hands, he decided then and there that he would never wrap a package with magic, again.
“No, I don’t really want the details, but would you rather talk to me or Hermione?”  He stood waiting on Harry to look up at him, and once Harry did with a furious look, Ron said, “It will make things much easier on all of us if you just tell me.”
