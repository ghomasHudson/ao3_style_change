"Ok, but first let me tell you that I most certainly have no desire to have a party for my birthday next year. All I want is you," Draco said firmly as he turned in Harry's arms and stole a kiss. As their lips moved together and woke his brain back up he considered that of all the gifts he had been given in life Draco was the best one he had ever got and the only thing he would ever need.
The eye roll she gave him was in his opinion unnecessary as was the exasperated tone when she replied.
"You want it hard babes? Alright then," Harry said, his voice low and edged with something a little dangerous. That tone sent a shiver down draco's spine and his arching cock leaked with the dark promises it held. Pulling back slightly he quickly took a deep breath through his nose before Harry forced him back down.
Draco considered explaining himself before pushing away the temptation, it wasn't Hermione's or any one else's business. He just needed today to be perfect and by Merlin he would make sure it was, for Harry's sake.
The words come out sharp but not because Draco is angry. He’s terrified. Harry knows that too which is why he doesn’t snap back at him. Instead, Harry looked over at him sheepishly as he rubs the red mark on his head, "That wasn't my fault. You’re a distraction and I can't tear my eyes away from you my love."
"Not one single bruise, wasn't that your exact words. For Merlin's sake you haven't even made it out of the building yet.”
Closing his eyes and letting out a content sigh at being home and with Harry Draco muttered, "Just a small miscalculation, I'm fine."
Letting out a soft sigh Draco lets go of Harry's hand to cup his face, peering deeper into his eyes, Draco memories the exact shade of deep green and the affection that pours from them. He doesn’t want to think about the possibility of Harry not coming back but it creeps into his head. It makes him want to hold Harry tighter, to whisk him away but just like the times that have come before he pushes those feelings aside.
"You better," Draco grunts as he nods in agreement before closing the remaining gap between them. As he presses his lips to Harry's his hands fist Harry's Auror robes to keep him in place. Harry's lips open a second later and Draco slips his tongue past Harry's lips to taste him once more. He's determined to make the most of their last few minutes before Harry leaves, neither knowing how long the mission will take or if they will see each other again. Without consent they keep things slow and Draco enjoys every brush of lips, every shared breath and every tiny moan.
“Merry christmas," Draco replied before pressing a kiss to Harry’s messy curls, full of joy to be back where he belonged. For the first time in weeks Draco could relax and a moment later he was fast asleep.
"I believe what you meant to say was 'thank you Draco for the wonderful surprise'," Draco said softly back. His tone was even but Harry could still hear the hurt in it.
"Yeah. Um, I wasn't expecting this at all," Harry muttered out as he forced a smile onto his face.
“Ah, fuck,” Draco cried and Harry felt his entire body tense underneth him as Draco came. The squeeze of Draco's hole on Harry's cock too much in the end as Harry released the skin in his mouth to groan as he fell over the edge.
"Fuck," Harry snarled as he suddenly pulled back releasing Draco's hair as he sucked in deep gasps of air. A little lost Draco blinked his eyes clear and stared first at Harry's cock, still hard and a deep red to Harry's face flushed with arousal and eyes burning behind the lenses of his glasses.
Smack.
With a smirk Draco slipped his hands up Harry's legs and made short work of unfastening Harry's jeans and with a tug pulled them and his boxers down to mid thigh. Harry’s cock practically sprang at him, hard and pointing at Draco’s mouth.
“Come on babes, come for me,” Harry grunted out through his clenched teeth as he tried to hold back his own orgasm. He felt like an animal, the desire to claim and rut pulling his lips back from his teeth before he bit down on Draco’s shoulder marking him.
Once sure he had regained some control and Draco had adjusted he drew back his hips before slamming forward. The sudden movement forced the air from Draco's lungs as he gasped but confident Draco was fine Harry only repeated the action. His cock thrusted into Draco's hole each time a little easier and Draco's grunts turned to moans as he struggled to keep his grip on the sofa supporting him.
As much as Harry enjoyed receiving pleasure from Draco, what really got him hot was hearing Draco lose his mind. The way his body grew loose and uncoordinated as his usually smooth voice got rough. Just the thought of it was deeply arousing and needing to see and hear it for himself Harry releashed Draco to shove him towards the sofa. As Draco's arse hit the back of it with a small grunt Harry stepped forward and gripping Draco's arm twisted him around. The jeans only just cleared Draco’s arse sitting under the curve and lifting it slightly to look even more rounded.
"Uh," Harry said, lost for words as he admired the sight before him, while Ron slapped him on the back with a deep chuckle. He hardly noticed the sting on his skin as his mind was thrown back into memories. He could recall perfectly Draco wearing those jeans on their third date and how he had slipped his hands into the back pockets to pull Draco closer for a kiss.
"Or get too worked up," Charlie teased as he gave Harry a wink on his way passed. Once they were alone, Draco pulled back and his smile disappeared completely.
Finally it was time, everyone was in place and eagerly waiting around the fireplace for Harry to floo in with Ron. After his mistake with the decorations Draco hadn't been confident with trusting him with the task of keeping Harry busy but had been overruled. He would discover if he had been right soon enough as the clock ticked away the minutes.
The echo of their cry carried through the house as Harry gazed at them with wide green eyes and his mouth hanging open.
Looking down at his crumpled shirt he had to agree and pushing down his nerves that there was something he needed to do he climbed the stairs leaving Harry's party in Hermione's hands.
With a small wave of his hand Draco watches Harry head out of their office. Once alone he wraps his arms around himself and holds onto the hope that Harry will keep his promise and come back again. Draco doesn’t even care if it’s with a bruise or two, he simply wants him to come home.
“Yeah, Happy Birthday to me. Now, why don't we go have a bath and then get to bed,” he suggested as tiredness leached into his body.
"Potter, wrap it up. We're moving out."
Draco didn't try and fight back against Harry's demanding thrusts into his mouth instead he relaxed his jaw and massaged his aching cock through his jeans for the small amount of relief it gave. What he wouldn't give to be able to wrap his hand around his cock and join Harry in the race to ecstasy. He could almost taste Harry's come, the bitter taste mixing with the spit filling his mouth and dribbling down his chin like the tears running down his cheeks.
Weasley and Granger chose this moment to enter the room. They both glanced strangely in their direction but didn't say anything.
"I suppose it won't be that bad," Draco said when Potter continued to look at him with question in his eyes.
"Hey," he heard Potter said in a soft voice. "Are you alright?" Potter placed one of his hands around Draco's shoulders and put the other over trembling fingers of Draco's clasped hands squeezing slightly. Draco looked at him. "It's okay, Draco, everything is okay," Potter was saying rubbing Draco's shoulder with one hand and squeezing his fingers with the other.
"Who's Dean?" Draco asked stupidly.
"How can you be sure, mate?"
Draco wrote an answer and it became a routine from that day. Potter was sending him a basket of berries and a note every morning and Draco replied.
And then, without any warning, Harry's hand cupped Draco's cock through his trousers, and after a moment of irrational fear and a couple of strokes, Draco was coming in his pants.
"Don't think I'm really going to pretend I trust you, Ferret," Weasley spoke up eventually. "I'm not stupid, I knew Harry wasn't just running around the woods almost every morning. I just had no idea this was all about you, Malfoy. I don't know what are you playing at, but... If you'll ever give me a chance– I'll take it with pleasure and without any hesitation."
Potter wasn't telling him much about why he was hiding, but he said that Dumbledore left him some very important task, and Granger and Weasley knew about it and they didn't let him to face it alone.
Draco just smiled at her awkwardly and watched her arrange the candles on the cake. Harry sat on the barstool next to him with two milkshakes, handed him one with a smile, then he and Luna started lighting the candles.
But he was wrong.
But when suddenly Harry's lips closed around the head of his cock, he couldn't hold it anymore. The last and the only one thought in his head before he blacked out was realizing that he didn't actually disobey but did exactly what Harry told him to do.
The next step in his usual routine would be reading some book in his bed before sleep, but he didn't want to go to that room, the old room of Regulus Black that for some weird reasons reminded him so much of his own, back at the Manor.
Potter was standing in front of that wall and staring at the tapestry. Draco followed his gaze.
"You are so perfect," Harry whispered back and slide his hands up and down Draco's back. "And you're all mine," he growled into his ear making all Draco's body shiver violently.
"Do you want to rest a little?" Harry asked. "I'm not sure I'm able to drive in the near future, I haven't come like that for ages," he laughed, and kissed Draco again.
"Only the most necessary things, and be quick, Draco."
"Potter, I do hope you're not going to sleep here," Draco said to him quietly.
"Madam Malkin's robe shop, thirty first of July, nineteen-ninety-one," Draco said without a second of hesitation. He could be embarrassed by his so quick and precise answer, but this situation was already weird enough, so he decided not to bother.
They not always were 'hiking' by the way, sometimes they were just lying on the blanket under some tree or by the river or in the tall grass, shoulders and arms brushing, and talked.
Severus had already finished his breakfast and was drinking coffee when Draco showed up at the kitchen almost thirty minutes later.
"Of course, Harry," he sat on the bed and took Harry's hand in his then turned to Granger frowning nervously: "How long has it been since he was bitten?"
"H-Harry," he managed to push him away a little. "I think that's enough for them."
"Wasn't your fault," he heard Potter's voice.
Potter changed a towel on Draco's arm again and called for his elf. "I should go now," he told to Kreacher. "You cannot say anyone about Malfoy; you must look after him while Snape isn't here, just keep water cold and make compresses on his arm. He's staying here and you must cook meals for him and clean after him if it's necessary. Don't let him into Sirius' room and out of the house. You can come if he'd call you, but I forbid you to follow his orders unless he's in mortal danger. Is it clear?"
"I've always known you're fucking great, Draco," Harry grinned at him while gleefully shaking Weasley by one of his shoulders.
"You're welcome," Draco smiled and laid his head against Harry's shoulder and his hands on Harry's chest while Harry stroked his hair with his free hand.
"What?" Severus stared at him strangely then scowled. "What in the name of Merlin did you do to convince Potter to tell you about Horcruxes, Draco?"
"Your– Fuck!" Potter cut himself off in the middle of a sentence about Weasley's adventures and sat up sharply and grasped Draco's left forearm. "Is it burning? Oh, Merlin's fucking balls, Kre–"
"Oh, you're not alone," the girl with very long curly blond hair – Luna, apparently – suddenly appeared in front of them.
"Ron doesn't agree with you here," Harry snorted sadly.
Severus sighed. "You may go back to Hogwarts," he said and elf disappeared with a loud crack.
"No, I don't think so, your Godfather gave me three phials of this shit already," Potter smiled laying back.
"Do you really believe that I deserve it?" he whispered.
Harry sat Granger's and Weasley's cups in front of them and seated himself next to Draco. They ate in silence but it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable even despite Weasel's glares and Granger's weird glances.
"Do you really believe I'm going to leave Harry with you alone?" Weasley said, surprisingly without shouting. Granger straightened next to him.
"Why the hell not?"
"They tortured and killed Scrimgeour," Potter said bitterly. "Now Ministry is under Riddle's total control. Why didn't you tell me? We could try to stop it, we could–"
But actually Draco liked their strolls a lot for many different reasons. The real beauty of the nature was one of them.
The hall was dark and narrow, there was smell of dust and dampness, and Draco wondered what kind of place it might be. Could it be Severus' secret house or something like that?
Draco felt like he was going to cry and he didn't even care that Granger and Weasley might see him like that.
"You look good in green," Potter said then turned sharply and walk to the kitchen counter. Draco blushed and swallowed trying not to look at Severus who watched him with a raised eyebrow. "Do you want some tea, Malfoy?" Potter asked him from where he was busy with a kettle.
"Draco, you'll wear the helmet or we're not going anywhere," Harry said in a surprisingly stern voice. "I'm not joking."
Draco glared at her, but she was smiling sweetly.
"I suppose–"
Potter said he had had breakfast already with Granger and Weasley, so Draco ate his buttered toasts and sausages and drunk pumpkin juice, while Potter was laying on the blanket next to him and telling him how he fell in this river and scared a family of wild ducks when he was here early this morning.
"Okay," was all Draco could say and in ten minutes he ate everything that was on his plate and wasn't even complaining about salad with cabbage that he didn't like much.
"Are you sure about Godrik's Hollow?" Potter asked rather impatiently. Draco was almost sure he wanted to ask this the moment Severus had said about it.
"Sirius made me his Heir," Potter said in a strange quiet voice.
Draco wasn't really listening to them. He crawled over Harry again to the other side of their bed, he felt safer sleeping near the wall rather than on the edge.
They went to Draco's – now old – room and Harry helped him to gather his things and move them into the new one.
"But– Malfoy is wearing Harry's clothes, 'Mione! How the hell did it happen? I'm Harry's best mate and I've never worn his clothes!"
But a look of joy and wonder on Potter's face and the way he was staring at Draco, or rather at Draco's lips, was definitely worth it.
"It is just me, Draco," it said in Severus' tired voice and walked past him to the kitchen.
Venice was beautiful and fascinating and Draco fell in love with it immediately. Even the fact that they managed to get lost in its tiny mazy streets three times in two days wasn’t that bad; because being here with Harry, exploring this amazing city with his amazing boyfriend, was like some romantic dream that Draco never expected to live through, and he was constantly high on emotions.
). He tore his lips from Harry's in order to catch his breath, and leaned his head on Harry's shoulder.
"Potter!" he cried out when Harry just ripped his shirt half open, but Harry ignored him and bit slightly on Draco's collarbone before he started sucking on it.
"It is an order, elf, wake her up now," Severus said in a low voice to Kreacher, who remained unmoving. The man sighed heavily and turned his head to the bed. "Draco, wake Miss Granger up, I need access to Potter," he ordered when he saw that Draco wasn't asleep.
And Potter was often writing about what he had seen through the Dark Lord's eyes. He wrote that Draco's father was alright and his mother was still safe and not in Britain, that Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle and Theodore Nott officially became Death Eaters and that Pansy was questioned about Draco's escape by the Dark Lord himself, but
"Kind of sausages, see?" Harry opened the box in front of him. "It has cheese and sauce too. Do you want this one?"
Harry was looking at him like he was expecting Draco to say something, but all that Draco could do was staring at Harry with wide eyes while those three words were pounding inside of his head.
"What in hell were you and Severus doing in that damn library that you became so mad and horny, Potter?" Draco tried to drawl, but it came out more breathlessly than was intended.
"Some from me, some from Severus," Draco answered.
"Snape?" Weasley shouted.
As soon as they went through the gates Draco felt the familiar twist of apparition and then they were standing in the dark alley probably somewhere in muggle London.
"Kreacher!" Potter called for his elf, who appeared in front of them already muttering something. "Shut up, Kreacher, I know you hate me, there's no need to tell me this every time you see me. Go and check what Ron and Hermione are doing. They must not see you. If they're not in the tent, bring my backpack. Go now and don't make any noise."
They had been together for almost two months now and it still felt unreal to him, that he deserved someone like Harry in his pathetic life. Someone who was so unbelievably kind and caring, absolutely selfless, breathtakingly gorgeous and simply amazing.
He laid his hand over Harry's and realized it was trembling slightly.
Granger gasped audibly, but Draco ignored her.
"I don't know." Draco looked away from Potter's gaze and quickly wiped his face with his sleeve.
Draco blushed furiously and pressed his face to Harry's shoulder in embarrassment and tried not to think about the fact that Harry had a
"Harry, do you know why I couldn't get into the library this morning?" he heard Granger asked, but Harry just frowned at her confused. "I wanted to look for some books about Horcruxes, I'm sure Blacks must have–"
Draco closed his eyes and smiled a little, enjoying Harry's warmth and his scent, he nuzzled Harry's chest with his nose inhaling deeply and felt Harry's hand squeezing his shoulder.
"You were right," he said quietly.
Harry removed himself from Granger and moved closer to Draco, cupping Draco's face with his free hand.
Thank you for reading! ❤
"Wow, must be really interesting," Harry grinned looking down at him.
Draco went after the man and sat on his usual spot at the table, placing the basket in front of himself. A plate with fresh scones and a large cup of peppermint tea appeared next to it next moment.
Harry smiled back brightly and levitated a piece on Draco's plate with the wave of his hand.
"Fucking finally! The– it's still fucking here, Snape!" Harry shouted. "I still can see– I saw– Fuck! Did you fucking have to give me a fucking hope?"
"Oi! What the bloody fuck, 'Mione?" the Weasel cried out.
"It's... really nice here," he said and Draco smiled looking at him. "You cleaned this all up by yourself?"
"Malfoy," he looked up at Granger and she might have seen all his emotions on his face, because she just stared at him and didn't say whatever she was going to.
Harry's hands clutched at the either side of Draco's ribs, and for a second Draco thought that Harry was actually going to drag him to himself over the table not caring about dishes and glasses on it, but next moment there was a sound of someone cleaning their throat and they pulled away from each other.
"What's happened?" he whispered.
"Yeah, it's an ice-cream after all," she replied with a smile.
"In my lab," Draco answered quietly and Harry leaned down to kiss him in the corner of his lips.
They were sitting like this for what felt like a couple of hours but it couldn't be much longer than ten or fifteen minutes. Draco felt a little overwhelmed but it was in such a pleasant way – the feeling of Potter's hand holding his, Potter's thumb stroking slowly over Draco's knuckles, the heat of Potter's body so close to his own – Draco wanted it to never end.
Draco wasn't able to say something in return, so he just kissed Harry's neck, but then yelped rather embarrassingly when Harry suddenly lifted him up by the hips. He automatically hooked his legs around Harry's waist while Harry carried him in the direction of his worktable.
His Economic group was planning to go for drinks tomorrow night, to celebrate the end of their first year at law school, but Draco wasn't really into the idea. First of all, he had never been a very sociable person, and also he hadn’t seen Harry for the last three days and he preferred Harry's company to any other's.
"The one who owns a pub in the center of the city?" someone asked.
Draco also started trying to wake up earlier than usual, so he could spend more time with Potter.
– the bar where Pansy suggested to celebrate his birthday, then decided to never show up – and he was friends with that Ginny girl and the other bartender there.
"Where are you going?" he asked when Harry started walking towards the bar.
Draco hurried to fetch the phial with Sleeping drought from the drawer of his nightstand while Granger was looking around anxiously and Weasley was mumbling something unpleasant about Draco's Godfather.
"Gin is an old friend and she also works here," Harry ran his hand through his hair and now Draco was dying to do it too. "So Pansy was talking to you about her? That's already something! And Mione didn't believe me when I said I saw them snogging behind the building!"
Draco rolled his eyes and went to the kitchen counter to make himself a cup of tea.
"Kreacher is so sorry, young Master Black, but Kreacher was told to wake young Master Black up right now and give him this," elf handed him a little piece of parchment. "Young Master Black should call for Kreacher, when he will be ready," and with that elf disappeared leaving Draco in a dark room.
"Where are we?" Draco asked looking around nervously and following Severus who was already walking down the street. But he didn't answer, just stopped near some strange muggle houses and handed Draco a little piece of parchment.
Draco laid his hand around Harry's shoulders and was smirking smugly at his classmates' shocked faces.
But it was easy reassuring himself like that while Harry wasn't around. Because with his incredibly green eyes, sweet and warm smiles, gentle touches and that fond look on his face it was too hard believing Harry wasn't sincere enough or was playing with Draco's feelings.
Soon Draco was lulled into sleep by the sound of Harry’s soft snoring and his steady breathing.
"So, are you going to tell me, Potter, what in the Merlin's name does make you think I will enjoy climbing some idiotic hill at six in the morning?" Draco wanted to sound annoyed, but this came out more like a whine.
"Um, my friends decided to abandon me on my own birthday, apparently," Draco answered him before he could really think about it. And why did he say it like that? Now Harry would think that Draco was just a pathetic loser who wasn't worthy of his time.
Draco nodded. He took his time to concentrate and to feel his magic again. It was much easier to cast this spell on the cauldron with bubbling potion, but now he needed to stop reactions in whole Harry's body. It would be the most difficult and the most important thing he had ever done in his life, maybe even including the repair of the Vanishing Cabinet.
Draco sighed and looked at the window; to his surprise it was already bright out there. "What time is it?" he asked.
"My eyes, my eyes! Hermione! Help me, I think got blind! They're doing it right in the middle of the hall!"
"Draco," Draco almost cried out in disappointment when Harry stopped the kiss to look at him. "Draco, is something wrong?"
"It’s not simple, baby," Harry cupped Draco's cheek and stroked it gently with his thumb. "And though Snape is absolutely sure, I'm not really that certain this shit is actually over," he sighed heavily and rested his forehead against Draco's, closing his eyes. "I'm still not free from him, I still can get into his sick head if I want to and I still can feel his fucking emotions. And I hate it, I hate it so fucking much, and I can't do a single thing about it."
On his twelfth day in the house Draco found an old potion laboratory in the cellar. With some help from Kreacher and even Severus he cleaned it up enough for being able to brew in it. So his days became less boring while he was busy making potions Severus brought him ingredients for.
He saw Harry stood up and unbuttoned his own jeans.
Well, to be honest, there were some serious reasons for Granger's worries. Harry was reckless, and he had a tendency to rush into something without thinking. And it was a little hurt that Harry didn't even say something to Draco, just disappear without any warning, like he didn't really care–
"You are leaving," he said slowly. "And you are doing it now. Your parents are not here, no one is here right now. Lucius is with Dark Lord, as well as almost everyone, including your mother; I arranged a little task for her. Don't worry, it is perfectly safe, she won't be in any danger and she won't be near the battle–"
"Hm?" Potter was still looking at the window.
"I thought you wanted to show me something, not to feed me," Draco said in a few minutes.
"Severus, do you think–" Potter stopped talking and the grin disappeared from his face when he spotted Draco walking into the room after his Godfather.
"Well, actually Kreacher helped a lot, and even Severus helped to arrange some of the equipment. Most of it is really ancient."
Cleaning Charm before putting Draco down and positioning himself between Draco's spread thighs.
"FILTH! SCUM! STAINS OF DISHONOUR, BY-PRODUCTS OF DIRT AND VILENESS! HOW DARE YOU BEFOUL THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS–"
He felt so many things right now; he didn't know how he managed not to explode.
"Do you want to do this sometimes?" he asked packing a shrinking blanket back in his backpack.
He was sure there was something else, and he hoped it wasn't that serious and Pansy wasn't in a danger bigger than they all already had been.
He walked to the table and pulled out one of the chairs, glancing at Draco with raised eyebrows. Draco walked to take a seat, feeling Severus' burning gaze on him. Potter remained standing.
Draco ran his hands through Harry's messy hair and tried to mimic the movements of Harry's tongue with his own. He was more aware of this kiss than of the previous one when he just stood in place and tried not to fall, so now he wanted Harry to feel at least half as good as Harry was making him feel.
"Are you sure, baby?" Harry pulled away a little to look at Draco's face.
Did he really said what Draco thought he said?
" he said and Harry's eyes flew open. He stopped laughing and judging by the painful but concentrated look of his face he was trying to Occlude from the Dark Lord's mind or whatever visions that bastard was sending to him.
Harry murmured quiet "thanks" when Severus placed the tray with dinner on his lap. Draco tried not to feel irritated, angry and hurt from the fact that Severus stole this tray and Harry's "thanks" from him.
incident? It made sense. Or Malfoy just– no, then he wouldn't be so worried..."
"Yes, is something wr–"
But all thoughts and worries left his head when he felt Harry squeezing him tightly and kissing the top of his head, whispering quiet “I love you so much, baby,” into Draco’s hair.
Why was Draco so stupid? Why did he always ruin everything? Would Harry ever want and try to kiss him again? Hell, what if he stopped even touching Draco the way he did? Draco had never had anything like this before and he wasn't ready to lose it because of his stupid cowardice.
"Ronald!" Granger cried out sounding very scandalized and that was funny.
He thought he might cry right now and right here if Potter would continue to touch him so gently and look at him like this. So he made an attempt to shake Potter's hand off his arm, but Potter held him tighter and brought his other hand on Draco's shoulder.
"Try to rest, guys," Harry was saying to his friends. "Draco will cast the spells and then Severus will fix me and we'll have dinner together and I'll tell you everything. Now I feel like I'm about to pass out. It's burning everywhere."
"Nothing new for now," Severus told him in surprisingly soft voice.
"Of course I will, Harry."
And Draco couldn't choose what to watch; his face or his cock.
"What were you talking about earlier, Draco?" Severus asked when they were both sitting at the table, mugs of steaming tea in front of them. "The thief of the Horcrux? What in the name of Merlin is going on?"
"Are you free? I’d really like you to come to pick me up."
"Can we talk about this alone?" Weasley asked loudly narrowing his eyes at Draco.
When Ron and Harry left the kitchen, Draco grabbed the tickets from where they were laying on the table. He still couldn't believe it. Ten days with Harry in Italy. It seemed too perfect to be true, but the tickets were right here in his hands, and Harry said he managed to rent a real apartment for them in some old historical building (well, Draco supposed almost all buildings in Venice were old and historical).
"Do you have any idea," Harry whispered, leaning closer, "how incredibly beau–"
"Yes, Draco has the Dark Mark," Harry continued and Draco looked up at his angry face, he felt panicked even more now. "But it doesn't make him a Death Eater, and I don't want to hear these words directed at him ever again."
"Yes. So they both have a perfect alibi and hopefully Dark Lord won't punish them for your disappearance.  I am supposed to try to find a way to get into Hogwarts, since one of the Vanishing Cabinets is missing. And I am supposed to do it secretly, so no one would be seeing me anyway. We are leaving, Draco. Both of your parents are capable of taking care of themselves and your mother made her decision. She wants you save, this is all that matters now." And he started to walk down the hall still holding Draco by the wrist.
"Having you here is a wonderful gift so I won't make you go back. However, you need to rest, and not under the tree," Harry told him before his lips captured Draco's. It was a soft kiss that spoke silently of worry and grief and told Draco how sorely he had been missed. He made the kiss last as long as possible until the dizziness in his head became too much for him to focus and he let Harry’s mouth slip away from him.
“A little, had a shower and thought it best I clean every inch,” Draco muttered back before moaning as Harry continued to finger fuck his hole. Adding a second finger Draco hissed a little but soon loosened and returned to harshly panting into the sofa. As Harry rubbed over his prostrate roughly Draco let out a whispered fuck before turing to look over his shoulder.
“It's Christmas,” Draco argued as if it gave him an excuse for being reckless. As Harry nervously chewed on his lip Draco let out a sigh and drew him closer with his good arm. “I wanted to be here with you not some smelly hospital room. Christmas is for spending time together with loved ones.”
"What happened to you?" Harry asked as he leaned forward pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead before resting his against it.
"We'll all laugh about it one day. Now, Harry will be here in an hour, the family will arrive in a few minutes. The decorations are done and so is the food, all that's left to get ready is you. So get moving," Hermione bossed as she shooed him out of the kitchen.
“You alright?” Harry asked as he gently stroked over Draco’s back and holding his arm helped him stand again. Draco stumbled a little and Harry steadied him with a hug, wrapping his hands around Draco's stomach and chest and letting him lean back.
"I promise. I'll come back without even a single bruise."
"No, you really didn't have to," Harry said again as he wished for everyone to disappear. Their living room was cramped by too many people and the whole house was covered in decorations and balloons. Harry had never liked people making a fuss over him and after being dragged all over wizarding london by Ron and hearing so many birthday wishes he had been looking forward to a bit of peace. Considering the ideas and thoughts that had jumped into his head at seeing Draco dressed up all he had wanted to was to drag him to the bedroom or down onto the sofa so temptingly close.  Something flickered in Draco's eyes and his smile dimmed a little before brightening again.
He probably was over thinking this, Harry would just be happy to have his family here but Draco wanted to do more. Harry's life might have gotten easier and Draco certainly tried to make up for his less than pleasant past with lots of affection. However it never seemed to be enough, he wanted to give Harry everything he had ever wanted for all the birthdays that were forgotten or spent in misery in that bloody cupboard. Just the thought of it boiled his blood even years after learning about Harry's relatives and their abuse.
Heading straight to the bathroom he quickly removed his dirty clothes and began the shower. The first touch of the scalding water pulling a groan from his lips as his shoulder finally dropped and relaxed.
Draco tried to scowl at Harry but the grin on his face and the gentle teasing in his tone resulted in a smirk. He’d honeslty missed their banter while he had been away and relished seeing Harry’s eyes lighten as his worry faded.
Harry was about to lose his mind and it was entirely Draco's fault. From the jeans to his seductive offer to give Harry anything and everything he had truly destroyed Harry's sense of rationality.
"You didn't have to do this," he whispered between them hoping that he would be able to hide his hardening cock. Being so close to Draco and the reminder of their younger days was causing lust to build in his stomach and heat his blood.
Once cleaned and dried Draco stood before his wardrobe wearing just a towel as he pondered over what to wear. The outfit he had picked out days ago suddenly didn't seem good enough, too stuffy but he could hardly dress in a pair of jeans. Or maybe he could, Harry had been very fond of seeing him in tight denim when they first started dating in their 20's. At 38, Draco had held onto his figure, mostly, so with a tilt of his head he wondered if he still had those old jeans. A quick rummage uncovered them hidden in the back and after an ironing charm and a freshening spell he slipped them on. The button was a little tricky and with a huff he enlarged the jeans an inch just to make it easier for him to move. As he had predicted them still fit him and moulded to his legs and arse like a second skin.
Draco could never be sure if it was the sudden brighteness of the lights coming on or the voice bellowing to freeze that caused him to jump back. He did know that it was a fold in the rug that made him fall backwards, one arm pin wheeling in an attempt to regain his balance. A failed attempt as he fell half on the tree, before sliding to the floor so that the spiky branches dug into his shoulders and scratched his neck and cheeks on the way down.
Draco checked the clock on the wall as he rushed past towards the kitchen searching for Hermione.
"That’s easy for you to say," Draco says back, capturing Harry's hand in his and pressing a kiss to his knuckle. It is easy for Harry because he isn’t the one being left behind but this mission calls for brute force and quick decisions and they have never been Draco’s strengths. Give him time to plot and plan or the freedom to use words and he can succeed at anything but put on the spot he pauses too long. For that reason Harry is going and Draco has to wait behind.
"It was a stupid idea," Draco replied his arms crossing over his chest, "I just wanted today to be perfect and give you something really special."
"I always come back, don't I?"
“Yes, fuck Draco,” Harry mumbled as he rocked back and then forward and Draco relaxed his throat allowing it to go deeper. Still Harry was being gentle, his movements slow as he fucked into Draco’s mouth but that wasn't what Draco wanted. They might not be young anymore but they had never lost the passion that had pulled them together and right now Draco needed that fire. Sweet had a time and a place but today called for something more, and Draco had no problem offering it.
Perhaps he could just wait down here, Draco considered as his arm gave another dull throb of pain. He didn’t want to disturb Harry by banging around too much since knowing Harry he hadn't been sleeping well while Draco had been off on his mission.Harry would appreciate a few extra minutes of sleep and Draco could catch his breath. Speaking of sleep he was feeling a little tired himself. His head fuzzy from the cocktail of potions he had been forced to take, maybe he should take a short doze just to stop the room from wobbling. Just a few more steps he thought, the hand that wasn't wrapped in bandages reaching toward the armrest. He just needed something to hold onto and he would be fine.
"Need to fuck you," Harry managed to say past the dizzy desire filling his head as his hands shoved at Draco's jeans forcing them down and finally out of his way. Grasping the rounded globes of Draco's arse Harry delighted in the soft sensation of touching skin. Pulling Draco closer he bit back a moan as their cocks pressed together and just that alone was almost enough to make him come. He was so close but he wasn’t ready to stop yet, not until he had buried himself deep into Draco and listened to him cry out.
His legs suddenly feeling weak, Harry rested more of his weight onto Draco as he concentrated on breathing and the after waves of pleasure spread from his cock to the rest of his body. Opening his eyes he gazed at the bite on Draco's shoulder, the teeth marks almost deep enough to break the skin and sure it would definitely bruise.
"No problems mate," Ron said as he herded his family towards the kitchen.
"I wish I'd known, we can't exactly kick everyone out now," Draco said with a shake of his head. The line between his eyebrows showing his gloomy mood.
It had taken a few hours but eventually everyone had left, including a grumpy Ron who had hoped to stay for a few more drinks. It had taken the promise of a night out next week to convince Ron to leave with Hermione and Harry let out a sigh as he locked the floo. Finally, he thought as he turned to smile at draco and admire his outfit again. It really wasn't fair that Draco had been teasing him for hours and several times he had been elbowed by his friends for paying too much attention to Draco's arse.
"It was nothing," Draco said with a small shrug and a large smile.
"Come on you two, everyone is waiting," Hermione said, interrupting them.  Begrudgingly Harry let Draco go and gave Hermione a sheepish smile.
“I want you naked on your knees with my cock half way down your throat,” Harry finally said as his hands squeezed Draco’s arse. With a smirk Draco reached back and removed them before then taking a step back and undoing another button of his shirt. Harry watched in a daze, his eyes moving from the line of skin being exposed to Draco’s face and then the clear outline of his cock shown by the tight fabric of his jeans. Draco wasn’t sure how he would get the stupid things off so instead contrentrated on removing his shirt for once not caring as it pooled onto the floor.
“You’ve teased me enough today, love,” Harry said as he tightened the hold he had on Draco’s hair and urged him to lean forward. Draco shuffled closer before wrapping his hand around Harry’s cock, pulling back the foreskin more before covering the head with his mouth. At the first touch Harry gasped and his hips rocked forward another couple of centimetres. He had more control than Draco would in his situation but soon he would lose his composure if Draco got his way tonight.
Draco moaned into the kiss, his mouth opening wider as Harry's tongue swept inside tasting a hint of sweetness from the cake they had eaten. Harry wanted to devour him, he wanted to feast on the noises coming out of Draco's mouth and gorge himself on the feeling of Draco wrapped around his cock until they collapsed. Breaking the kiss he trailed more down Draco's neck, his teeth scratching over a certain spot that made Draco arch into his embrace with a gasp.
"He said sorry and the decorating company should have checked his order before they made it," Hermione replied but it was clear she was also a little upset over the mistake.
"Is it ready?"
“Talk to me Harry, tell me what you want,” Draco whispered as Harry growled through his teeth, the noise coming from the back of his throat and full of frustration.
"Draco? What are-," Harry began as he rushed forward, wand hanging limply as his side, only for Draco to cut him off with a sheepish smile.
"It was all Draco's idea, he's been planning it for months," Hermione stated as she appeared beside him cuddling into his sde as George stepped away.
"Save it for when you get back Potter. Now go on before I decide to keep you here for your own protection," Draco teases, only half joking as the nerves in his stomach continue to flutter around but hidden behind his sass.
"Really?"  Harry's eye searched out Draco's and his heart skipped at the shy smile he was wearing along with a dusting of pink on his cheeks.
Harry walks headfirst into the open door, the edge digging hard into his skin. Draco makes a noise that’s a cross between a snort and a scoff as he folds his arms over his chest, lips curling with amusment. It is just so typically Harry but his mirth doesn’t last long as the dread returns because Harry couldn’t seem to keep himself from harm.
"You could have sent a message and I would have come to you,” Harry pointed out as he frowned and looked over Draco again checking for any other bumps or brusies.
"I suppose," He said letting out a deep sign, "I'm just relieved I managed to fix it. I doubt anyone would have been happy with a banner saying Happy Birthday Hairy."
“Come on, otherwise I’m going to fall asleep on my feet."
"I don't need special Draco, I just need you. All day all I've thought about is coming home and getting to spend time with you. Honestly you've made this harder by putting on those jeans because all I can think about is getting you out of them," Harry explained as his fingers found the belt loops of Draco's jeans. He used them to pull Draco against him, tighter than last time. It didn't take long for his meaning and interest to become clear. Draco's lips parted as he let out a quiet 'oh' of understanding.
"So, you mentioned earlier that you wanted me out of these jeans but you seem very fond of them," Draco said, his voice lowering as he flicked open another button of his shirt.
Caught Draco didn’t bother to deny it and gave a small shrug before letting out a hiss as pain flared up his left side. Just when would those pain potions kick in, he thought as the ache only seemed to grow worse with each passing second.
"Alright? We're coming," Draco called his expression no longer as dreary as before.
He would feel guilty about that tomorrow while Draco would just roll his eyes and cast a few healing charms. For now he forced himself to stand up and let his softening cock slip out of Draco’s hole along with a dribble of come that soaked into his lowered boxers and jeans.
Draco worries his lip as he watches Harry finish strapping his wand holster to his thigh. The leather straps pulled tight over the muscles to secure it in place before he drops his wand into it and his eyes lock with Draco's.
"Harry," Draco croaked out before coughing to clear his throat. Rather than answer Harry reached out pulling Draco to his feet and into a messy kiss. With more biting than kissing Harry decoured Draco, eating up his heavy gasps for air between each new attack on his lips.
Harry pulled back to stare hard at him, "You didn't insult a hippogriff again did you?"
“Leave those for now, just get on your knees,” Harry said as Draco opened the button of his jeans and pulled down the zip. It helped relieve some of his discomfort but didn't remove it completely and as he sank to his knees they only seemed to grow tight again trapping his hard cock. Therefore in an attempt to distract himself Draco gazed up at Harry and in the most sinful way he could manage licked his lips.
"No, I've learnt my lesson when it comes to those bloody chickens. As I tried to leave my cover was blown and I caught a nasty hex before I managed to reach the portkey to bring me back. I'll be fine with a bit of rest."
"Tell me what you want, Harry, anything you want I'll give you," Draco whispered as the hands he had wrapped around Harry's back tightened.
Twisting his tongue over the sensitive tip in his mouth Draco added a few sucks while his hand stroked the base before pulling back. Before Harry could complain he licked up the shaft, the spit he had collected in his mouth leaving a warm wet trail and then another as he did it again. With Harry's cock now slightly slicker when he wrapped his lips around it again and pressed his head forward it slid easily into his mouth brushing the back of his throat.
"I am but they are unfortunately in the way," Harry replied as he closed the gap between them and captured Draco's mouth in a deep kiss. This time he didn't hold back, fingers digging into Draco's arse wished he could feel soft skin rather than rough denim.
Moving his hand from Draco’s hip Harry reached around and wrapped his hand around Draco’s weeping cock. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could last at this pace but he wanted Draco to come too. Keeping his grasp firm he stoked Draco in time with his fast and mess thrusts as he leaned over Draco’s back.
“I am fan-fucking-tastic, Happy Birthday Harry,” Draco mumbled and when he turned his head Harry could see half of the smile covering Draco’s face.
"Kreacher won't be touching the Mudblood," Draco heard Kreacher's annoyed voice.
"I advise you to stop right this instant, Weasley," Severus snapped and glared at the redhead idiot.
"Ron, honestly!" Granger cried out with irritation. "Is it the most important thing now?"
"Thank you, Harry," Draco whispered. "For the birthday present," he smiled.
Harry was also expected Severus to show up and was getting nervous (though he was trying to hide it) about the fact he still didn't come with the mysterious news he had promised to him.
"I don't know," Potter stopped in a doorway. "I think I should come sometimes, for food and for news from Snape. He will be here often enough, so..."
Draco felt himself idiotically left out and stepped away awkwardly, but was stopped with Harry's hand around his wrist.
"Shit," Potter muttered to himself. "How am I even supposed to explain something to them?"
"Have you gone completely mental? He's a Malfoy, Harry! I may understand the– this!" Weasley waved his hand awkwardly between Harry and Draco. "But he's a Death Eater, bloody hell!" he shouted at Harry's face while Granger just paled and was staring at him with wide eyes.
"It's the
To Draco's horror Severus simply stood up without a single word and went out of the kitchen and out of the house as well.
Draco barely had time to check that Harry wasn't about to seat him on one of his knives or some ingredients. But Harry was careful too and even cast a fucking
All Draco's body was on fire and he was really surprised he hadn't passed out from all the sensations. And he was sure he'd fall if it wasn't for Harry's arms around him and Draco's own hands around Harry's neck.
. This word echoed in Draco's mind almost all day. He annoyed Severus a lot that day, not listening to what he was saying to him half a time.
An otter hadn't dissolved yet, as Draco heard a loud crack and the ugly elf was saying something about an urgent massage for his Master.
Draco nodded again and buried his face in Harry's warm and firm chest.
Potter also had sent him some herbs and plants a few times after Draco wrote him that Severus didn't want him to brew a Dreamless Sleep potion because the thing was dangerously addictive.
Draco's heart jumped like crazy and almost stopped when he heard the sound of the roaring motorbike, and he immediately forgot about everything and everyone around him, and turned to look to his left grinning like a complete loon.
"I liked it very much," Draco answered, his face pressed to Harry's sweaty chest. "But I like it more when you're the one in control, to be honest," he added after a few moments of thinking.
"I mean, you can. Um, sit here," he blushed again and looked towards the bar, embarrassed.
"Harry," Draco whispered, tilting his head to the side.
"Let's sleep, baby," Harry murmured closing his eyes.
," he repeated more firmly and swished his wand once more over Harry's neck.
He hadn't said
Harry seated Draco on one of the stools at the bar. And while he busied himself with making drinks for them, Draco took his time to look around. It was small, but a very nice, cozy café with small round tables and a lot of plants and flowers everywhere. It looked like the walls were painted in pale yellow and white; it must be very bright during the day, he really liked it.
He didn't see and didn't care where Weasley was and what he was doing, but he saw Granger, who, with a bated breath, was watching Draco while he was casting. She was still sitting on the bed clutching Harry's hand tightly and staring at his lifeless face.
He gave the letter to Kreacher and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and comb his hair. When he was almost done, the loud crack of elf's appearance made him jump and drop his hairbrush on the floor.
"Kreacher!" Severus called for Potter's ugly house elf instead of answering him. "What is this?" he pointed at Draco's plate when the elf appeared.
Draco suddenly realized that it was around midnight already and just how much he wanted this night to never ever end.
those fucking muggles to death, but he forced himself to calm down and started talking about Ancient Greek wizarding history.
He wanted to cry.
"Thanks," Potter looked at him too. "It's your name down there," he said tilting his head in the direction. "Thought you might like to see," and he turned back to look at the window.
"There is no time for this," Severus cast a couple of charms on the trunk and took it before he started walking out of Draco's room. "I think you should hurry if you are keen enough to go out of it alive".
"Potter did bring you berries? When?"
And Draco liked the sound of his name in this incredibly deep, beautiful, sexy voice – very much.
"This elf is spoiling you almost as bad as your mother," Severus told him standing near the table across from him and eyeing his berries suspiciously.
"He is!" Harry shouted back to Blaise, turning to look at Draco's classmates, grinning happily and looking as perfect as ever.
"Oh, of course you're bloody sorry, fucking hell!" Draco laid his hand on Potter's arm and he abruptly stopped his shouting, looking back at Draco.
"Er, it's just– I actually cooked it by myself, the pudding I mean," Potter said awkwardly and looked away.
"I think it is indeed a good idea," Severus answered before Draco had a chance to open his mouth. "This elf knows too much already, it is not very wise to keep him at Hogwarts where almost everybody might question him."
His Harry, who was funny and really smart, but also so dorky and childish, sometimes Draco thought he was dating a teenager.
He was brewing a lot of Pain-Relieving (his Dark Mark was burning sometimes) and Blood-Replenishing (when he thought about Potter in a nice black dress robe covered in blood) potions. He'd brew a Dreamless Sleep potion for himself, but Severus didn't like the idea and refused to bring him moonseeds.
Harry's voice was so close, Draco could feel the heat of his breath on his own lips, and the sensation was making him feel hundreds of little shivers that were running along his whole body. Draco's eyes flew open immediately.
"Yeah... There weren't any Death Eaters but there was his fucking snake. I don't even know how, but she was able to use Bathilda Bagshot's body to lure us into a trap."
"So he already read all the books and found nothing? Or what?" Granger asked.
And he still didn't know anything about his mother. Severus refused to tell him something and Harry wasn't able to know anything about her through his visions. Draco just hoped she was safe and believed he would see her someday.
"Kreacher thinks everything is in the perfect order, Master. Master ordered Kreacher to cook for young Master Black, so Kreacher made the kitchen comfortable for his cooking," the elf said visibly enjoying Potter's frustration.
"There is a Burn-Healing paste just in case," Potter said gesturing to the small tube on the bedside table and rubbing his scar with his free hand. "I don't know what he's going to do to you, and what he really can do. I mean, through the Mark. He wanted to find you but he can't because of the wards on the house. But he can still torture you through it, and he was saying to your father that he'd torture you to death. But it's not gonna happen, you know, right? Snape will help you and I will do all I can too."
"Snape will come soon and you probably won't see me in a long time, so don't worry. Your Mark is burning."
"Thank you," Draco startled a little at the sound of Harry's voice so close to his ear, but quickly relaxed when one of Harry's strong arms circled his waist. "You have no idea how much you helped, Draco."
"No, no, Harry," Draco tried to stop him.
"Is it really what you want right now, sweetheart?" he asked, freeing Draco's hands and gently cupping his cheek.
He was having nightmares again. His Sleeping drought was over a few days ago and he didn't have ingredients for the new brewing. The peppermint tea gave him a little comfort, but Potter's Gryffindor t-shirt didn't smell like Potter anymore and he couldn't made himself relax enough to fall asleep without potion and Potter's scent surrounding him.
"What is it, baby?" Harry was looking at him worriedly. "Draco, I– It's– It never really occurred to me that you might– I wasn't– I always was sure to ask you everything– Why haven't you say anything? I'm really –"
"Harry, are you feeling better?"
"You think my father knows? About Blacks?" Draco asked him when he calmed down a little.
Harry's face changed in a second. Why? Draco was sure Harry really wanted to kiss him.
Draco didn't give himself any time to think, he just acted. He walked to Harry and hugged him from behind, putting his arms around Harry's middle and pressing his cheek between his shoulder blades.
His father didn't say much, just told Harry to take good care of Draco and not let him drink too much wine.
There were blood traces down his neck, disappearing under the collar of his shirt. His messy black hair was covered in some blood too and was even messier than usual.
"I missed you so much, baby," Harry whispered and kissed the tip of Draco's nose.
"What is this? Harry, what are you talking about?" if they thought Draco was going to just stay away and watch from the distance beside confused Weasley and Granger, they were very wrong.
"Ron, do you hear yourself? Stop being ridiculous and eat your dinner," Granger said rolling her eyes, and for once Draco agreed with her.
Draco lifted his head to look up at Harry, who was looking right back at him. Draco wanted to ask what did that mean and did that even mean anything and would Harry like to kiss him again. But he couldn't speak.
One glance at the note in his hand was enough to know who it was from and Draco started to read.
"Draco," even Harry's voice sounded painful. "Draco, why are you here?" he asked.
"He has an order from Dumbledore," Harry's hand tightened on Draco's shoulder. "Sorry, I can't tell you, 'Mione."
"What the fucking hell, Snape? I had to leave Ron and Hermione in some– Oh, Malfoy."
"You are absolutely not alright, Potter."
"Am I sounding creepy when I call you 'Ron'?" Harry answered him in annoyed voice. "If you prefer 'Weasley', all you need is just to say that." That made Draco smirk.
There were some moments of silence and then pain in Draco's arm was suddenly back and he leaned on a kitchen counter heavily. Potter was grasping his forehead again and he was unusually pale, but he stood up and looked at Draco worriedly.
"We've been thinking," Theo started talking, using his business voice, and Draco rolled his eyes at him
"Don't! Don't even fucking say that, Harry!" Weasley interrupted. "And nothing in this house is bloody 'his'."
"Do you want to try something?" Harry asked and Draco nodded. "It'll be so good, baby, trust me," Harry added and kissed him roughly on the lips.
Draco just blushed (
"About two weeks."
"Both of them. They will be teaching, if you would permit me to use such a term while talking about Amycus and Alecto Carrow of all people." Severus was silent for a couple of minutes, and Draco was unsuccessfully trying to picture Carrows as professors. "They do not like me much, so I suppose there will be a lot of spying and trying to figure out whose pawn I really am, the Dark Lord's or Albus Dumbledore's."
Sometimes they talked about Hogwarts too, about their professors and lessons, and about Quidditch and their favorite teams and players. Potter couldn't believe him that Arithmancy was really his favorite subject and Draco had difficult time believing someone really might voluntarily support Chudley Cannons.
Thankfully Harry wasn't gone long enough for Draco to start really panicking, but he was still very worried.
"Snape! Good to see you," Potter greeted Draco's Godfather cheerfully when he appeared in the middle of the kitchen grinning sheepishly at them. "Malfoy," he nodded to Draco. "So how you guys have been doing?"
"Which one do you want?" Harry asked. Draco wasn't sure he really wanted it, though the smell was rather delicious. "Margherita has only cheese and tomato sauce, and this one is Pepperoni, and if you want to eat some with chicken and onions then do it now, or Ron will eat the whole pizza by himself."
"It's not always about what you want, Potter!" Draco tried to sound angrily, but his voice was weak. "Why do you even care?"
Harry just chuckled. "I'm not planning to," he said softly and then shifted on the bed and tugged Draco to himself. Draco got the message and hurried to lie next to Harry pressing himself as close to him as he possibly could.
Draco blushed like an idiot and kissed that stupid smirk off Harry's lips, pressing his body into Harry's as much as possible, drowning in the sensations of Harry's lips and hands on him.
"It'll be better if you just–" Draco started to talk, but was cut off by Weasley's Patronus.
"Mrs. Malfoy, it's a pleasure to finally meet you," Harry said, kissing the fingers of her outstretched hand; and he was trying not to show it, but Draco could tell how nervous he was, and somehow it made him fell a little more confident himself. "I was told you are rather fond of roses," Harry added, giving the large bouquet to Draco's mother.
"It's about poisonous herbs and flowers," Draco answered, picking the book up and closing it to show the cover to Harry.
"Melt?"
"I'm sorry, but we're already closed!" a girl's loud melodic voice rang out from somewhere in the depths of the dim room.
"I will not be able to come here very often with the beginning of the school year," he told Draco. "I finally convinced Dark Lord to make me a new Headmaster of Hogwarts," Severus sat in the big armchair near Draco's bed. "But he is sending Carrows at Hogwarts too."
"You can, sweetheart," Harry said, spreading Draco's legs wide, and Draco believed him.
Eventually he stopped crying and just snuggled closer to Potter enjoying the feeling of comfort and safety, warmth of Potter's body and gentleness of his touch.
The next moment Harry's hands were on Draco's hips and Harry's mouth was on Draco's neck.
"I was thinking about it too, to be honest," Draco admitted quietly. "We can have a dinner together tomorrow, if it's okay with you."
"Do you think it is time for you to know the answer for this question?" Severus asked in a very serious tone.
"Of course, I do! It's delicious, Harry," Draco said smiling.
3:16 pm
"Malfoy, do you really think I would put you in such kind of danger?" Potter's face was so close to his and he was still holding his hand, so it was hard for Draco to think at all.
," Draco whispered a little shakily, waving his wand above Harry's motionless body. "
"It's none of your business, Weasley," Draco drawled, enjoying the expression on the redhead's face. He looked like he was about to be sick any moment now.
Draco didn't want just to lay here and he started to raise his own hips to meet Harry's, but he was too far gone to be capable of finding the right rhythm. But then one of Harry's hands suddenly appeared on Draco's ass and started helping him to match his thrusts with Harry's.
"What do you think?" Harry asked, and when Draco just continued staring at him, he stood up and held out his hand. Draco swallowed nervously and slowly lifted his left hand from his knee then carefully laid it in Harry's waiting palm. Harry just grinned happily, showing his teeth, and pulled Draco up.
to Harry out loud yet – he hadn't ever said
He heard Harry saying something and Hermione answering to him, then the sound of retreating footsteps. He grinned against Harry's neck, but yelped the next second when Harry abruptly lifted him up and sat him on the table, nearly on one of the plates with eggs and bacon, that he probably made while Draco was still sleeping.
"No. I mean, I don't– I mean–"
"Er– So you aren't mad?"
Draco was in his rooms at the Malfoy Manor, sitting at his desk and trying to write an answer to Pansy's last letter when the door to his bedroom suddenly burst open, letting his Godfather promptly came in.
Draco just stared at his beautiful eyes helplessly and wished for so much more.
"Drink and do continue," Severus said handing Potter two phials of what Draco thought were Blood-Replenishing Potion and Invigoration Draught. "Eat, Draco," the man said turning to him and walking to sit on the other side of the table.
"I hope Snape will know what to do to make it less painful," he heard Potter's soft voice again.
Draco took his hand carefully and almost melted inside. The sensation of his cool thin fingers being wrapped in the man's –
, and didn’t regret it for a second.
"Ready for what?" Draco muttered to himself and light his wand with a whispered
"It will be the first of September tomorrow," Severus told him after a rather long pause.
Draco felt himself blushing furiously and hurried to put his phone into his trouser pocket.
"He's not– he–" Weasley was trying to say something. "You know– He is not creating one?"
Severus was staring at them. Not just staring, but nearly gawking at them with wide eyes and unnervingly weird expression on his face. Just how in hell had Draco forgotten about his Godfather being here?
He tried to control his breathing and looked at his own hands instead.
"Sirius Black?"
They had a late lunch in a small pizzeria near some little park and then decided to walk back to their apartment.
It was almost a month since they'd met in the forest for the first time, and Potter with his friends had changed their locations nine or ten times already. So Draco saw dense woods, broad meadows and valleys, rivers and lakes, and snowy mountain tops. Once Potter even showed him the real muggle farm, not that Draco was very impressed with it, but his hand was in Potter's almost all the time, so he didn't really mind.
"Of course he did!" Draco rolled his eyes at Harry's lie and too cheerful tone. "I'm Harry." Harry grinned, shaking Theo's hand.
"What happened?" Severus asked him.
Draco was trying very hard to not allow himself thinking about him like that very often, but couldn't help but whispering this name when he was touching himself late at night or in the morning shower, or when he was comforting himself after his nightmares while burying his nose in that ridiculous sweater with a hood he slept in. Thinking about him like
But now he was here with Draco and Draco was glad about that, though he felt rather irritated himself. He wanted to help Harry so much, but had absolutely no idea how.
"Do calm yourself, Potter, I–"
"W-what? How?"
So he wrote Potter back, answering his questions and telling him to be careful. He wrote him about an ancient potions book in Latin he started to read (or trying to read) last evening. He also wrote how he couldn't stop coughing from dust for twenty minutes straight yesterday, when he decided to spend some time in the drawing room and sat in one of the old armchairs. He wrote that all he actually needed was a fresh air, but he was too afraid to open windows.
Hannah’s tour turned out to be absolutely amazing, they saw a lot of great and interesting places, and Draco liked travelling by gondola very much. He was also fascinated by the mysterious stories Hannah was telling them about some
Draco felt thrilled and exited. Recently he started to think that Harry actually might like him back, and now... Had Harry liked him since last year? Did Granger and Weasley really believe they had some kind of relationship with Harry? But–
He much more cared about words they were saying. Harry was talking about him the whole sixth year with his friends? Of course Draco had noticed that Potter was watching him or even following him sometimes, it was obvious he guessed that Draco became a Death Eater and Potter wanted to catch him. But Weasley and Granger were talking about it like it was some obsession, inability to think or talk about something or someone else.
"Meet your great-aunt, Malfoy," he said turning to Draco with a smirk.
him," Draco said watching Harry's painful face.
"Just take a seat, Malfoy," Potter said tiredly, pulling out a chair next to his.
Weasley immediately scowled at him leaning back in the chair he was sitting on, and Harry grinned at him from the kitchen counter when he was making tea. Granger didn't even bother to look up from the book she was reading.
"Potter, please, try to form the full sentence before I fall asleep," Draco drawled lazily, falling on the pillows beside him.
"You ruined nothing, Draco," Harry's breath was on Draco's neck and the next second Draco felt Harry's wonderful warm lips on his skin again.
The man's small smile grew and now Draco couldn't decide what was more beautiful after all – his stunning unnatural green eyes or his perfectly shining smile.
"What's this one about?" Harry asked suddenly and Draco looked up at him. Harry was watching the cover of the book that was laying open over Draco's chest.
"Potter, before you decide to tell anything to Draco, I need to talk to you alone," Severus said frowning. "Are you saying that you are still able to see– to see into his mind?"
Draco was a whimpering mess just in fifteen minutes and was trying to move his hips more while Harry was sucking and biting his nipples.
Draco's panic returned to him when they stopped in front of his parents' house, and he almost dropped the bottle of scotch that Harry bought for his father earlier and now handed to him while he was putting away their helmets.
"But you're sure, aren't you?"
With all the talks about Dark Lord's Horcruxes and the following talk with Kreacher (that consisted more of Kreacher's hysterical crying than actual talking), the time was somewhere between lunch and dinner and they all were exhausted and pretty hungry.
"Yeah, I am, of course I am. I didn't want him to find us and screw up your posh breakfast in not so posh woods in the middle of nowhere. Did you?"
"Your present? You want it now?" Draco had different plans for that part, but if Harry wanted it now, then–
"Then Malfoy could stay," Potter said, amplifying Draco's shock even more.
"Why?"
But the most incredible part was the feeling of Harry's strong muscular body beneath his hands, of course. Harry was wearing only a thin t-shirt now and Draco wanted to whimper helplessly every time Harry's muscles flexed under his palms.
"Let's get you to your room," Potter stroked some hair from Draco's face, it felt awfully nice. "So you could rest or maybe even sleep. I'm sorry I woke you up that early, but I think the sunrise was worth it, wasn't it?" he smiled at Draco. Suddenly there was a wet flannel in his hand and he was wiping Draco's face with it carefully.
Draco sat up sharply and tried not to blush. Weasley and Granger came back into the room wearing clean clothes and looking much better and fresher, but still very tired.
"Thought you might like some warm clothes in this chilly early morning," he said handing this sweater to Draco, who pulled it on with a quiet "thanks", quickly inhaling Potter's scent from the soft material.
And after a moment Draco became aware of Potter's fingers sliding slowly around his wrist, gently tracing blue veins on the pale skin here. He looked down in time to see Potter's fingers intertwining themselves with Draco's. Then Potter squeezed his hand slightly and Draco smiled. He looked up at Potter but he was keeping his eyes on the valley, and Draco turned to look at it too.
"You've been told the truth," she accepted the flowers with a big beautiful smile. "And, please, call me Narcissa, dear," she added, patting slightly blushing Harry on the arm.
"Yes, Weasley, I am."
"I can give you an Unbreakable Vow that I will do all I can to help Harry and that I'm not going to hurt him. Or you."
"I'm yours," Draco breathed out and whined pitifully, nearly thrusting his hips up, but at the last moment remembering Harry's order not to move.
Draco found himself leaning into him; he laid his head on Potter's shoulder and closed his eyes for a few seconds trying to steady his breathing. He felt Potter's stubbled cheek brushed the top of his head and the feeling of Potter's breath in his hair made Draco shivered slightly. He tried not to melt into him and not to smile like a complete idiot.
The man just grinned, showing his perfectly straight white teeth, and sat on a chair across from Draco's.
"Ron, stop it already," Granger said with a sigh and stood up to help Harry setting the table.
"Yes!" Millie screeched again, nearly deafening Draco and Liza.
and even some of
"You're so beautiful, baby," Harry murmured nosing behind Draco's ear.
But later at night when Draco was lying in bed and inhaling Potter's scent from his clothes, he remembered how Potter stood by the window in the drawing room with him watching Death Eaters' appearance in that square, Potter's strong arm around Draco's slightly shaking shoulders; Potter squeezing his hand telling him he was safe here, before he threw his Cloak over himself and left – Draco couldn't care less about a color of the t-shirt he had to slept in. It was Potter's and it helped him to feel safe.
"Don't even think to say something like this in front of Harry, Granger," Draco hissed at her.
"I forbade you to use this word!" Potter shouted again.
"Are you sure you're not hungry?" Harry asked him a few minutes later, offering Draco a forkful of his kidney pie with a small smile.
was the most gorgeous sight Draco had ever seen.
"You're not going to kill me here, are you?" Draco joked lamely.
He stopped when he felt Potter's thumb stroking the skin on his left forearm which was still in Potter's hand. Potter was smiling at him such a warm and gentle smile, Draco found it was rather hard to breathe and he was sure he was blushing like some first-year Hufflepuff again.
A moment later the silver locket with an intricate pattern was placed on the table in front of Draco.
) and let Harry lead him across the street and into the one of small cafés lining the footpath. Harry opened the door in front of Draco and held it for him, then followed him inside.
And Draco literally melted when Harry wrapped his arm around his shoulders the moment Draco slipped under the covers next to him. He laid his head on the side of Harry's chest and pressed himself as close to Harry's body as he could.
Then Harry started kissing down Draco's throat and all Draco could do was moaning helplessly. It was so unbelievable what Harry was able to do to him just with his hands and mouth, half a time Draco was sure it all had to be some fever dream.
Harry smiled at him warmly and widely, said nothing and continued watching him working on the potion.
It also helped Draco to realize with how much guilt Potter actually saddled himself. He blamed himself for his parents', Diggory's, Black's and even Dumbledore's deaths. He blamed himself for all the deaths of Death Eaters' victims – wizards and muggles – because he knew he might end it but didn't know how exactly, because Dumbledore didn't leave him a lot of help.
Draco looked up at him and just nodded, too exhausted to feel embarrassed and too tired to speak.
Considering the way Harry and Weasley glanced at each other over his and Granger's heads, they realized it too.
Dramatic exit Draco had been planning fell miserably when he had to climb over Potter in order to get off the bed. He was proud of himself that he didn't blush.
"Go sit on the table, Draco," Harry said squeezing Draco's hands.
"Um, Draco," he replied quietly.
Weasley looked a little uncertain but it didn't last too long and soon he was eating the strange pie too, holding the piece in his hands and saying something with his mouth full.
"Don't flatter yourself too much, Potter," Draco said, but he couldn't stop himself from smiling again.
"Do you have some sort of connection with the Dark Lord?" Draco tried to ask again after a few minutes of silence.
"I understand," Draco said quietly, ignoring a little stab of pain in his chest.
"Bloody hell, mate!" Harry jumped at the sound of fucking Weasel's voice. "Not in the bloody hall!"
"But it'll still be safe here, right?" Potter's voice sounded tired and was muffled by his hands.
"It's, er, your breakfast," Potter said and stepped away from Draco a little awkwardly. "If you want," he added.
Draco tensed a little at first, but then he quickly forgot all of his thoughts and melted into Harry's firm and already so familiar body. He signed with relief and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, kissing him back.
When Harry finally came to him (with scowling Severus in tow), Draco was rearranging some of the equipment and it was almost dinner time. Draco suddenly felt very hungry after he realized that eggs and toasts that Harry made them for breakfast and Kreacher's biscuits were all he ate for the whole day.
Draco wasn't expecting that in the slightest, Harry knew how shy Draco usually was with such intimate gestures around other people, so he didn't do it very often. It made Draco gasp in shock, and Harry immediately used the opportunity to lick into Draco's mouth.
Potter also told him about their third year and how he learned about Black being his parents' traitor and his Godfather and how he then learned the truth and was hoping to become a real proper family with him.
Draco continued to thrust down on Harry's lap, moaning and throwing his head back, while Harry was devouring his neck very passionately. Draco was sure there would be marks tomorrow and that thought turned him on even more.
"Would you prefer to stay with
"Draco, you're shivering," Harry whispered in his ear and Draco shivered even more. "Are you alright?" he asked again, his hands stroking Draco’s back.
"Care to explain where in the Merlin's name have you been, Draco," Severus asked him angrily.
He groaned loudly and Draco realized he was getting close.
Draco had to close his eyes because of all the sensations he felt while he was sinking down at Harry's cock after a few minutes of passionate kisses and a little bit more fingering.
When did he become that weak? No, it was the wrong question; he always had been weak, wasn't he? When did he stop hiding it from people, from Harry? Oh hell, he cried in front of Granger and Weasel earlier today! What next?
Severus cast an impressively strong Disillusionment Charms on both of them before they went through the main doors and almost ran down the path to the big iron gates. Draco couldn't stop worrying about his mother, but Severus once again assured him that she wasn't and wouldn't be in any danger.
Draco talked a lot about Pansy and how much friendship with her helped him through the years. Pansy had a real talent to calm him down and to help him to sort out his thoughts. He told Potter how much her simple chattering and staying out of his business helped him to go through last year without losing his mind. He also told Potter a little how they were growing up together and that Pansy was like a sister he always wanted but never had.
After he left, Granger turned to Draco looking like she was ready to interrogate him too, so Draco stood up quickly and walked through the kitchen and then into the hall leading to his lab.
"I wish I could let Pansy know that I'm fine," Draco said quietly. "Do you know something about her?" he looked up at Harry who awkwardly looked away from him and then took a step back.
"You're good at Healing, aren't you?" Weasley's question startled Granger as well as Draco. "Aren't you, Malfoy?" he repeated impatiently when Draco remained silent.
Draco was sure he blushed like some stupid Hufflepuff girl (again) but he managed to scowl at Potter, though the stupid git just laughed at him.
"I am still not sure what to say about it, Draco. But I am absolutely not happy about this situation and I am perfectly aware you wouldn't listen to me if I say you to stop it," he sighed heavily. "I haven't had breakfast yet and I have some news," with that he stood up and walked out of the room, Draco followed him downstairs.
Draco thought Weasley's face must be a rather comical sight right now but he didn't want to look away from Harry's, who was still motionless and almost breathless and frighteningly cold.
And Harry's hands, these perfect, big, strong and gentle hands. The one was in Draco's hair holding Draco's head in place, and the other was everywhere – gripping Draco's hip, squeezing Draco's waist, sliding up and down the side of Draco's ribs, holding the side of Draco's neck, cupping Draco's cheek.
Draco looked at the tapestry on the wall then turned to Harry and his friends. Harry looked like he was thinking hard about something, Granger was already scanning the wall in search for fitting names, and Weasley was just frowning at Draco looking as stupid as always.
His Harry, who was an incredibly sensuous lover, who could be tenderly gentle and passionately rough at the same time, Draco sometimes couldn't believe he was even real.
Low grunting sounds Harry was making with every thrust, the way he was devouring Draco's neck and Draco's collarbones, the feeling of his large hands on Draco's slim body – all of this was so incredibly overwhelming, Draco wasn't sure he would be able to live through one more minute of this, but at the same time he was sure he never wanted it to end.
The man lifted his gaze from an old book he was reading and looked at Draco intently. "How are you feeling?" he asked.
"No, no, it's okay Harry," Granger interrupted him. "I want to be near you." She smiled at him and looked like she was going to say something else, but Weasley was already dragging her out of the room.
"Harry," Granger glanced at Draco again. "Are you going to tell us why Malfoy is here and what's going on with Professor Snape?"
Not that he didn't actually want it – he wanted it every second of being near Harry – he just was too afraid to ask. And he also liked,
Draco blushed and hid his face in the crock of Harry's neck, inhaling the scent of the leather material of Harry's jacket. The scent had become one of his favourites in the last month (after the scent of his Mother's perfume and Harry's skin), and it always calmed him down.
"Hermione, it's much more than just these stupid visions, okay?" Harry cut her off with a sigh, loosening his hands around Draco's waist and allowing him to slide off his lap and onto the chair next to him.
Draco blinked, realizing that he was lying absolutely naked in the middle of Harry's large bed, with an equally naked Harry lying next to him, stroking Draco's hair and smiling at him softly. Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Harry didn't give him a chance, kissing him deeply and so sweetly, Draco forgot what he even wanted to say.
But he immediately forgot everything about his supposed friends when he looked up at Harry who was now laughing rather loudly. His head with its black perfectly messy locks was thrown back, his green eyes shining even more, and his whole body shaking, and for now
He half-crawled to the kitchen counter and reached for the last cabinet's door trying very hard not to cry too loudly. He took a small purple phial and knocked its contents into his mouth with a quick movement of his hand. He immediately felt much better, though he still could feel the burning in his Dark Mark.
"You're not going to throw me out, are you?" Draco asked him, trying to remove trembling from his voice.
"–but it's still me who owns this damned fucking place, and I can throw him out right this fucking moment!" Potter shouted pointing his finger on chewing Draco, who swallowed hard and looked at Severus with clear panic in his eyes. "You will allow access to Ron and Hermione, Snape," Potter continued in a low voice, "Or I'll do it now."
"Erm... It's okay, I think," Draco mumbled awkwardly.
They immediately decided that traveling through Italy by train and stopping at different cities and towns every day or two was absolutely amazing idea. They were talking about rather it would be better to travel alone or in a big company of their friends, when a young woman approached them.
Draco yelped loudly when Harry squeezed his ass cheeks rather hard, shifted himself a little, and then ground Draco down on himself again while raising his own hips at the same time. But now it brought their hard cocks together and Harry's low growl was even louder than Draco's needy moan.
"But–" Draco was trying to make some sense of it.
"Sometimes," Draco mumbled, trying not to stare at these lips too much.
Draco watched him carefully while sipping his tea.
In the shower Draco was running his hands up and down Harry's wet and soapy torso while Harry was washing Draco's hair, and he couldn't believe how lucky he was that Pansy convinced him to go out for his own birthday this year, and that she chose Harry's bar for this.
Draco didn't think this gorgeous man in front of him could ever be described as 'adorable', but the pink color on his tanned cheeks made him look really cute.
Potter looked at him and gave him one of those breathtaking small smiles of his that made Draco forget about everything for a moment.
Kreacher didn't pack any breakfast that made Draco even more suspicious.
He changed the towel while he was talking and Draco was suddenly very aware of the feeling of Potter's hands on his bare skin.
"Then where? And what about my parents?"
"Young Master Black doesn't want to go?" Kreacher asked him, then started muttering: "Kreacher's Half-blood Master will be sad to know, Master isn't so bad, he cares about young Master Black so good, he wanted–"
"What about the staff?" she asked.
"You are not okay, Potter."
Severus stayed with him almost all afternoon. He told Draco what would be going on at Hogwarts in the upcoming school year, and this news made Draco feel grateful to both Potter and Severus again for taking him out of it.
He smirked smugly looking at Weasley's angry face and continued sipping the tea.
"And who's you really are?" Draco couldn't stop himself from asking.
Draco stopped listening and looked back at Harry who was already watching him with that beautiful smile on his handsome face.
He still couldn't fully believe that it was actually happening, that he and Harry were actually going to Italy together, and he was on edge the whole day. He was very excited and nervous at the same time, was anxious to not forget to pack anything, and every time he thought about upcoming dinner at his parents' house he was overwhelmed with an idiotic fear.
"Have been keeping tabs on my grades, Malfoy?" Harry leaned his hip on Draco's worktable, smirking.
He walked up the stairs and paused on the second floor on the sound of the voices from the dawning room, but it was unlikely that Gryffindors might want him to be there with them, even though he knew all their secrets now. Of course it was unlikely too, that they actually had told him
Draco looked down on a parchment in his hand. It was a letter he wrote to Potter about fifteen minutes ago, except for the one line in a familiar messy handwriting at the end of the page.
"Yes, we're fine too, Harry, but I feel so tired," Granger sighed. "It would be nice to sleep in the real bed and without that silly fear that someone will see or hear us."
"What is your name?" the man asked suddenly.
"Mister Snape called for Kreacher and gave him a little piece of parchment. He ordered Kreacher to find Master immediately and made sure Master's friends read the parchment before Kreacher must apparate them here." Elf suddenly started shivering. "Young Master Black, Kreacher is sorry!" he cried out and threw himself on the floor in front of Draco. "Kreacher cannot do a favor young Master Black asked him to do! Kreacher cannot reach Mister Snape! Young Master Black, Kreacher is so sorry!"
Harry stroked Draco's thigh when Draco sat on the bike behind him and put his arms on Harry's waist. Then he waved to Draco's classmates, and Draco glared at stupidly smiling Liza who was weaving back too enthusiastically.
," Draco whimpered.
"Where is Potter?" Draco said before he could stop himself.
"Harry?" Draco called him when Harry didn't answer and just stared at the table.
Soft helpless whimper was all Draco managed to produce in return.
"Good," Draco whispered, this was good, they had time.
"Potter, I'm Black," Draco interrupted him. "Well, half-Black, but it should be enough. What if I would be able to find something in this library? I know Severus is super genius, but I'm sure Blacks knew how to hide their secrets well. I know blood magic. And maybe I will know where to look."
Draco felt Potter was tugging him closer to himself and he gave up.
Draco asked him back then why in the name of Merlin he had to cook when he was a child, but Potter didn't answer and fell silent for a long few minutes and when he started to speak it was to ask Draco to tell him about the book he was reading. All Draco wanted to do that moment was to
Potter wrote him he was alone 'exploring the nearest area' somewhere in the woods or wherever they decided to camp this time. Draco thought it wasn't very smart of his friends to let him wandering on his own. He felt something unpleasant curling in his stomach when he remembered about Snatchers, Severus told him about.
"You mean Ginny? How do you know her too?"
"Kreacher!" Draco called the elf. Kreacher appeared already holding full dinner tray. "Thanks, Kreacher," Draco said and tried to take it, but the tray flew in the air and out of the kitchen following closely by Severus. Draco glared at his back and hurried after him.
might be the one to jump away.
"My what?" Draco blinked.
Draco laughed when Harry cursed and removed his other hand from Draco's ass to help himself. Draco leaned back on his hands and bit his lip, watching Harry fumbling with the buttons.
"Fuck," Harry growled and stepped closer to him.
Harry grinned and took the phone.
"Ron did you listen to me? I told you he's helping me– us! And he knows about Horcruxes too," Harry said tiredly.
"Because he's saying proper things, Ron!" she yelled back.
"I didn't know..."
He didn't acknowledge Potter's words and made up for his dramatic exit by slamming the door shut behind himself as loudly as he could.
"No, no!" Draco hurried to stop him. "Water is okay, I'm just– Did you say you've been watching me?" he asked the man in confusion.
Severus felt silent and Draco couldn't and didn't want to find some courage to ask him to continue.
"This all is very charming, but I was taught to eat with the cutlery, not with my hands," Draco drawled, looking at Harry skeptically, who just laughed and grabbed a greasy piece of some kind of muggle strange pie with his bare hands.
"And what is Nott talking about? We can go celebrate in Harry's pub?"
"It's okay," Draco smiled at him biting his lip. "Technically it's your bed."
"Yeah, him," Potter wetted his hand in the jar and pressed his palm to the scar on his forehead. "Oh, it's good," he moaned sitting on the floor and laying his head on the bed near Draco's thigh and closed his eyes.
"What did you mean you can Occlude? Occlude from what exactly?" Draco asked him, following him out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
Draco didn't know how Luna made it,  if she was even the one who made it, but it was actually made of ice-cream. An ice-cream cake. There was vanilla ice-cream on top and strawberry ice-cream on the bottom and it had lots of fresh fruits and berries and was indeed very delicious.
Draco realized he was staring and look away quickly, clearing his throat.
Harry's cock was hard too, Draco could feel its heat pressing against the lower part of his stomach, but he didn't know what he supposed to do, and to be honest, he was a little afraid of doing something with
"What do you mean? Harry–" she gasped and glanced over her shoulder at Weasley, who was currently walking out of the pantry and chewing a half loaf of bread . "Does it somehow concern whatever Professor Snape is searching about Horcruxes?"
"Do what?" Draco blinked feeling stupid and trying not to think about things he shouldn't.
He quickly brushed Draco's hair from his face, then started stroking himself again. Slowly at the beginning, watching Draco's face and caressing it gently with his fingers. But it didn't last, he was panting too soon and stroking himself faster and faster.
"N-no– not really," Draco mumbled.
"Draco, you're absolutely amazing, great and very smart, but I doubt you can do much if even Severus–"
Draco just rolled his eyes and was about to reply something sarcastic as Harry and Granger walked into the room talking quietly. Or Granger was talking while Harry was frowning at her and trying not to stumble over his own feet.
"Did you even sleep?"
"Maybe you're right," Draco laughed a little then stopped when Potter took his hand again.
"Yeah,
"Granger, do you know the spell that can stop the blood?" he looked at her and was surprised to see she had already placed all the potions from some little handbag on the bedside table. He quickly drank the phial of Pain-Relieving potion to not let the pain in his Mark prevent him from thinking properly.
"Out of– Alive? What– Severus! You can't just–" Draco understood nothing and he felt a wave of panic starting to rise inside of him. "Tell me now, or I'm not going anywhere," he said taking a step back.
And how in hell did Draco manage to not see these lips yet? They were slightly red and so full... Draco had to shake his head to not get lost in his thoughts again.
"Oh– I– I'm sorry, Draco," he said watching Draco's face carefully. "I'm sorry," he repeated and walk to the pantry, closing the door behind himself.
"Um, yes, of course– I mean, no! No, I don't,"
"It's really very tasty, Ron," Granger said with a smile, and to Draco's horror did the same thing as Harry – took the piece in her hands, then took a rather impressive bite from it.
One of Severus' brows was lifted in amusement of this situation, and when their eyes met, he even smirked a little to Draco.
Potter smiled and sat next to Draco, sneaking a toast from Severus' plate, that made the man glared with irritation while Draco was trying to suppress his snickering.
"I think we might throw it awa–"
Draco wanted to come to him but Weasley managed to shove him away though one of his hands was still pressed to Harry's neck who was now squirming on the bed. Draco glared at freckled git with irritation.
How Potter had even managed to survive that long with such friends Draco had absolutely no idea. If these two were bickering like that while Harry was bleeding and screaming, laying in the same bed they were sitting on, Draco couldn't even imagine what they were like while Harry was conscious and not in pain.
Harry laughed and picked him up, he kissed the tip of Draco's nose and started carrying him to their bedroom.
Draco stood up sharply, gave him the darkest glare he managed to muster and went to the other –
"I'm sorry, babe, but I couldn't wait any longer to tell you," Harry said and reached his hand to hold Draco's over the table. "Do you like it?"
"I just don't think it'll be safe for me, and for you as well, to come here very often. Because of the Death Eaters, I mean. Do you think they'll be out there twenty four hours a day?"
"Well, I haven't actually slept here since–" he cut himself and stared at his hands on his lap. "I wasn't here in summer after– after out fifth year, but when I've stayed here this summer, I slept in Sirius' old room."
"Draco, are you okay with a vanilla milkshake?" Harry asked him at the same time as Luna asked no one in particular, "Do we need candles?"
Draco tried not to blush though he wasn't sure he was successful in it. But he was perfectly sure that his face became redder than Weasley's hair when he heard a cough from the doorway.
"The final question," Harry turned to him after pulling his own helmet on, his voice muffled a little. "Do you like ice-cream?"
Draco swallowed and looked up at Harry who turned to him with a helmet in his hands.
"Well, now I know that at least parody isn't one of these things," Draco snorted.
"What are you doing so far away from me, babe?" he heard Harry's sleepy hoarse voice. "Come back here," he patted the space on the bed next to him.
Draco sat on the table next to Harry and glanced at the tree large boxes of that muggle food.
"Go back to your room."
The following night was the best night in Draco's live.
It was Harry who said that. And he said that so casually, like it wasn't a problem that was eating Draco's mind for the last fifteen minutes.
"I asked him to pick me up from here."
"Do you need something, Draco?" Severus asked.
"I thought you liked it," Potter replied frowning at his cup in his hands.
"Remove the Stasis," Severus ordered rudely. Draco noticed he was clutching a small phial in his hand.
"Foolish kid," he heard Severus muttered, he gripped Draco's elbow and dragged him into the hall. "There is no time for your whims! I need to get you save before he, or someone else, is back. I gave a vow to your mother."
Harry kissed him hard at the mouth then, swallowing his moans and touching him everywhere, making Draco feel the most delicious kind of dizziness.
After a couple of hours Draco heard footsteps on the stairs and in a few minutes there was a loud shouting from somewhere downstairs. He laid an open book on the bed and hurried to the sound of arguing voices.
Draco was embarrassed by the amount of selfies they were taking while kissing and standing on different bridges, but he also loved it. And he loved Harry, and Harry loved him, and he still couldn’t believe it and still felt like he might burst every second from everything he was feeling.
"Wow, that's a big deal, Draco! And happy birthday by the way!" Now Harry
"I will be waiting in the library," Severus said and walked out of the kitchen.
After two Draco's last words expression on Weasley's face changed a little and he turned to look at Granger. Draco held his breath and watched them staring at each other. It seemed they were just as good at silent conversions as they were at hysterical bickering.
"I might admit, it could be much worse if it wasn't for Potter's cooling compresses," he said after a couple of minutes. "And if it wasn't for the Burn-Healing paste he left for you and the remnants of the mind of his elf, your arm might be looking like a burnt piece of meat now. Dark Lord took your flight very close to his heart and I'm sure he is not done with you yet."
"Oh, and I'll be twenty-one next year!" Luna informed Draco happily.
Draco turned a little more in his chair and was watching Potter while he was talking. The sight of his naked back and the way his muscles were moving under his bronze skin made Draco feel things he shouldn't and he looked away quickly only to find himself under the dark glare of his Godfather. He felt his face flushing red and turned to stare at the table.
He smiled at Harry and shrugged, indicating he didn't mind.
"Yeah, baby, me too," Harry said and kissed his mouth, swallowing Draco's helpless moans and whimpers. "Do it," Harry whispered against Draco's lips. "Come, baby," he kissed him again. "Come for me, Draco."
, fingering him open.
Draco started to stand up from the bed slightly aware of the pain in his left forearm and Granger shouting "
Draco threw his head back on Harry's shoulder, sobbing and whimpering pathetically, and trying to move his hips more, but Harry held his waist in the iron grip that didn't really allow him to move the way he wanted.
"Yes, please," Draco whispered, smiling back.
Draco decided to go to his –
"Are you my boyfriend now?" Draco asked breathlessly when their lips parted, ignoring his embarrassment.
Draco rolled his eyes at them,
"The locket!" Weasley yelled looking like he was about to go mad. To be honest, all three of them looked like that.
Draco wanted and they sat comfortably on the blanket, Potter conjured a big cushion so Draco could lean with his back on a big stone behind him.
And these hands. Harry's hands. They were perfect too, and they were squeezing Draco's ass rather hard right now. It wasn't the first time Harry had touched him there, but this time it felt so demanding and so hot, it made Draco fully hard in mere seconds and he wasn't able to control his urge to thrust down into Harry's lap.
," he whispered and immediately felt and heard that Harry started breathing heavily.
"Language, Weasley," Severus snapped at him already waving his wand above Harry's body.
Draco was already on his feet but he had absolutely no idea what was going on and what to do, so he started panicking. His brain probably shut down for a while, because the next thing he knew was that he was sitting on the floor in front of screaming Potter and trying to pull his hands off his face and shouting to him to come to himself. The fucking elf was still saying something and Draco shouted at him to shut up.
"About eight in the morning."
"What does it mean?" Draco asked a little nervously after a minute of staring at the Potter's question.
"It was a snake. She- she was a snake. His snake, Nagini." Granger answered him still crying in Weasley's arms.
"Kreacher, bake whatever the hell you want, just make sure there will be enough for everyone, okay?" Harry said tiredly.
"Yeah, I want you right now, my baby dragon," Harry growled, and leaned over Draco, pinning Draco's wrists above Draco's head and kissing him hard.
Draco was still standing on the spot like he was frozen, feeling idiotic and not understanding what had just happened.
Then he felt something cold and wet against his left forearm and pain and burning went away a little. He looked at his arm and saw Potter pressing a wet towel over his Dark Mark.
And then there was silence.
"Calm down, Ron," Harry said but he was looking at Draco.
Harry's hands were on Draco's ass and he was thrusting his hips up from time to time, sliding his hard cock between Draco's ass-cheeks.
"I need you to use your words, sweetheart," Harry whispered against Draco's lips, before biting them, then kissing him hard.
"How long has this thing been going on between you two? That's why you're here?" Weasley asked then suddenly looked at Granger with a loud gasp. "We should've guessed, 'Mione! With all this unhealthy obsession through the whole last year!"
"None," Potter winced a little when Severus touched the cut on the left side of his ribs. "Wedding was a nasty hell, to be honest, but Kingsley managed to warn us in time, so many were able to escape. But there was a lot of panic and someone was trying to assault the Burrow. Mad Eye was injured rather badly, I don't know if he's okay now, I hope Weasleys took him with them..."
Draco didn't. He rolled his eyes at Theo's pompous behavior and climbed off Harry's bike and unfortunately off Harry's lap, turning to look at the git.
Draco scowled on Weasel's stupid smirk, when Harry put him on the ground and sprinted towards still stunned Severus.
"Why is it more important to have Malfoy here than protecting my friends?" Potter continued his shouting and Draco mused really why.
Draco had absolutely no idea how Harry and Granger were able to talk about such horrific things so coolly and calmly.
They were sitting in heavy silence for long minutes. Granger and Weasley were frowning and glancing at each other or Harry from time to time. And Harry took Draco's hand in both of his and laid their intertwined hands on top of the table. Draco leaned a little closer to Harry and looked at his hand that was squeezed between Harry's big palms. He couldn't believe what was happening – Harry wanted to tell him his secrets. Did he actually trust him that much? Draco had been dreaming about that for so long...
"–ur fucking Master, for fuck's sake! My orders come first!"
Draco hurried to lay as close to him as possible, grinning happily.
"Sorry," Potter said not sounding sorry at all. He caught Draco's hand in his and smiled at him.
"It is not just an insult, Potter," Severus hissed at him. "It is the official order to capture you at every possible opportunity. Not only Death Eaters are after you now. It is an official crime for a common wizard to help you or to hide you. This is going to be spread in the Muggle world too, just like it was with your precious Black. Do you finally understand?" Severus glanced at Draco. "This all was Lucius' idea."
"Sorry?" was all he was able to manage.
for iced coffee and muffins, after taking a shower.
"It will be easier for Malfoy," Draco looked up at Potter, surprised. "I mean, if he'll need something or if his Mark will be burning and hurting again. So Kreacher will be here to take care of him, and you or I shouldn't be rushing here immediately. And I think I couldn't come very often. And so are you, with Death Eaters around, I mean."
Maybe that was why he managed not to come the instant he felt Harry's tongue licking at his balls.
"You're okay, baby?" he asked, brushing his thumb over Draco's cheekbone.
"I bloody know how he might react," Potter said snorting and rolling his eyes. "He's going to hiss at me angrily about my carelessness and my Gryffindor stupidity."
"It is Potter's sweater, isn't it?" Severus said in amused voice still staring at Draco strangely. "Where have you been, Draco? Answer me!" the man half whispered dangerously, glaring at him when Draco didn't answer.
Draco didn't hear Granger saying something, but he heard the footsteps in the hall and on the stairs and soon Severus was standing in front of him, frowning.
"Really?" Harry asked with a smile and reached out for Draco. "I just want to be a responsible boyfriend, you know" he said, smirking and wrapping his arms around Draco's waist.
"Is this okay?" Harry asked softly and squeezed his thigh a little.
Elf bowed his head to Potter and muttered something again. "Master's girl required Kreacher to get her and the Weasley boy to the Master, but Kreacher rejected her," he said and then continued his weird muttering.
"Draco, I won't die," Harry answered softly, gently caressing Draco's back. "Your Godfather is bloody clever bastard, do you know that?"
"Can't you tell me? Do I know them?"
But suddenly Kreacher appeared in the middle of the lab, saying that dinner was ready and that they should hurry to the kitchen "or that barbaric Weasley boy will eat absolutely everything".
Draco thought maybe it was he who had a head injury and he was simply hallucinating while lying on his bed in his room at the Manor.

"You're right, Ron, you're right. It might start like that, but then something– After that
"You're not allowed to come unless you have your cock in my mouth," Harry said and Draco almost choked on his own whimpers, nodding quickly. "You understand, babe? Use your words, Draco."
him, Granger, and then you two can fuck off doing your stupid brawling somewhere else!" Draco shouted as loudly as he could.
"Oh... Then–"
"You're welcome, Malfoy," Potter grinned at him squeezing his hand in return and then let go off him. "See you," he said when Draco stepped to Kreacher and held his hand for the elf.
his friends to let him do it. He trusts me, Severus."
Draco couldn't look away from Harry for all the money in the world. He was so gorgeous, so sexy, Draco had troubles believing he was real and he was standing right in front of him, stroking his big cock and tracing the lines of Draco's lips with the fingers of his free hand.
Severus stood up sharply. "Potter, I am waiting for you in the library when you are done with that little therapy session." And with that his Godfather walked out of the kitchen slamming the door behind him.
"I didn't do anything!" Draco cried out, offended. "It was he who wanted to tell me! And it was he who
Severus glanced at Draco and walked to Potter.
Draco ignored the idiots and draped his arms around Harry's neck. Harry cupped Draco's cheek in his big palm and was smiling at him sweetly, Draco just stared back and was blushing of course, but he ignored that too.
Draco was staring up at Harry in complete wonder.
"In here!" Draco called back.
"Have I managed to make your day a little better?" Harry asked with a smile and laid his hand on Draco's thigh.
"I looked in nearly every book at Hogwarts' library, but couldn't find even one name that would fit with these initials," Granger said with a desperate sigh.
They went out of the kitchen together, with Severus' hand on Potter's shoulder, but not before Draco caught the green gaze and heard a quiet "See you, Malfoy" in Potter's low voice.
Draco felt himself flushing bright red. "Shut up, Potter," he muttered trying to look offended.
"Ron! You've been literally just eating during the last five hours!" she exclaimed rolling her eyes at him.
"I was so worried," Draco muttered in Harry's chest.
"I couldn't do it if you weren't attacking that slimy bitch so effectively," he muttered awkwardly.
Draco heard the bells of Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa ringing two times and realized that it was already the day of Harry’s birthday. So they'd been in Italy for two days already. And it was the best two days of Draco's life.
Harry and Draco exchanged looks while Hannah was talking and Draco smiled at his boyfriend’s concentrated face.
"Come on Harry, tell me your dirtiest fantasy and I'll make it come true," Draco purred as he lifted a hand and buried his fingers into Harry's hair. Giving the greying curls a gentle tug he pulled away enough to see Harry's eyes. The thick lashes only made them seem darker but it was hardly a secret how aroused Harry was when Draco could feel Harry's cock pressing against his own. The jeans that had been a little tight before, were now downright uncomfortable and he would be very happy to get out of them. As Harry remained silent he let one hand slip from Harry's back to his chest. Fingertips trailing softly downwards until he could cup Harry's cock as he applied a tiny bit of pressure.
“Fuck ,yes,” Draco groaned back as he shifted his feet and held on tightly to the padded back rest of the sofa.
Draco smirkes as he shook his head at Harry's attempt to charm his worry away. It helps a little because Harry isn’t completely lying. His need to protect meant that when Draco is near Harry’s focus was on him rather than what he should be doing and it is just another reason Harry is going alone.
“Please,'' Draco begged and that was all Harry needed to hear. Withdrawing his fingers he covered his cock with the remaining lube. Resting the tip of his cock to Draco’s slicked rim he pushed forward in one slow thrust until he bottomed out with a deep sigh. With Draco’s legs held almost closed by the lowered jeans Draco felt tighter than normal and Harry had to take a few calming breaths for fear of coming too soon.
“You’re such a fucking tease,” Harry rasped as he reached out and combed his hands through Draco’s hair pushing it back.
"Fuck," Harry groaned into Draco's shoulder as a thousand thoughts filled his head. He wanted everything, he wanted to lick and suck and bite every inch of Draco's skin. To feel Draco's mouth wrap around his cock as he looked up from his knees with those beautiful grey eyes and to sink into Draco's hole and experience it clench around him as Draco came with a breathless moan.
Draco moved slowly and carefully in the silent house. The soft glow from the Christmas tree lights giving him just enough vision to avoid the coffee table and show the abandoned cup sat on it’s surface. Cradling his arm close to his chest he made sure not to jostle it with each gingerly taken step. The healers had been quite adamant that he stay in St Mungo’s but there was no way he was missing christmas or going another minute without seeing Harry.
But was it that good for Harry too? What if he didn't even want to come yet?
"He and Weasley went with Kreacher," Draco answered. "Apparently, this elf had found a thief of that locket-Horcrux."
He really couldn't believe it. Harry planned a trip for them for Draco's (that was nearly two months ago) and his own (that would be in a few days) birthdays.
Harry stilled for a moment but then relaxed. He put his own hand over both of Draco's and said something so softly, Draco didn't really catch it. But he was too overwhelmed with his feelings at that moment to ask Harry to repeat himself.
"But I think–" Weasley started saying angrily.
"Harry has a rather high threshold for pain," apparently Granger thought that conversation wouldn't be properly complete if she won't say something.
Draco rather liked that Potter's notes became more and more like letters. Potter trusted him enough to tell they were changing their location, he cared enough to ask Draco if he needed something and he wanted to know about Draco's day.
