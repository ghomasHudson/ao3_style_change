Draco cracked a smile at that.  “Never fear, Pansy darling.  We will find something that does not require such a sacrifice.”  Then his expression grew serious.  “We are highly trained, well bred, extremely intelligent individuals.  We will find a solution.”
“No.  I mean yes, I’ve really enjoyed taking pictures and I’d love to keep the camera.  I can pay your dad whatever he thinks it is worth.”
Rookwood shifted a bit as though bringing himself back to reality before continuing.  “The alternative is equally as simple.  You can stand here and watch Potter die, and then the rest of your little band.  Before we toss you over the cliff to join them we will strip the information from your mind and build the new world order without you.”
“Given the way I went off on you earlier, I’d say that’s pretty accurate.”  They exchanged an amused look.
Fred and George exchanged a look.  “Too soon,” they both concluded, as if their reference to the late Headmaster was the problem.  Then they exchanged a number of incomprehensible hand gestures.  McGonagall was already heading out of the dining hall at full speed and Fred took off after her.  Harry had the suspicion that this was not the last they would hear of that eye.
Draco took a deep breath, suddenly shaky, and tried to keep his focus on the attack.  “I saw him, the man who attacked Pansy.  He ran past me.” And then, quietly, “I know him, recognize him I mean.”
“You think I have middle child whatsit with Harry and Hermione?”  Ron said, still working it out in his head.
Shacklebolt slapped Ron on the shoulder and then made his escape.  Ron’s bit of a smile disappeared completely when he looked back down at Pansy.  “It’s just a promotion,” he tried to explain.
Apologizing to his family for ignoring them was also easy.  They all forgave him.  His brothers still teased, harassed and pranked him at every opportunity, his mother still scolded and hugged and was a whirlwind of constant motion, while his father beamed proudly at all of them.  Life as a Weasley continued on with all of the frustrations and joys that heritage entailed.
My apologies for being slow with this chapter.  I was hoping to have it up beginning of the week, but it has been crazy at work.  The next chapter is also going to be slow, I'm afraid.  That said, we only have two chapters left so we're almost there!  If I don't manage to get a post up next week do not panic.  Chapter 9 a big chapter and I might need a bit of extra time to get it all worked out.
Just when Draco was sure the day could not get worse.  Robards stormed towards them, red face and bellowing.  “You are outnumbered and surrounded!”
Dolohov charged at Robards, wand extended, curses flying.  One of the best duelists in the wizarding world, it took nearly ten Aurors to fight him to a stand still.  Robards stumbled backwards almost immediately lost to Draco’s view.
“Nope,” Ron said, popping his p.  “This is going to be fantastic, between them hating our guts and watching you moon over the poncy git, I’m going to be having the time of my life.”  But there was no heat in his grumbling.
Harry smirked, “Nothing could hold Sirius once he decided he wanted out.”  Talking about his Godfather did not hurt as much as it once had, and he was proud of himself.  “They’ve put in a new head warden at Azkaban since the breakout.  He’s a good man, and the changes he’s making will really tighten the place up.  Someone just needs to find those two and get them back in there.”
He could try playing along like he did with Voldemort.  But that had not worked.  Playing along, trying to do just enough to keep himself and his family out of trouble was what had landed him in the tower with orders to kill Dumbledore.
“Some of the stuff he is using I didn’t even know was flammable,” Ron said, looking back over his shoulder at the tech who was still watching them.
“When he asks me to.”  The two men exchanged smiles.  He had said ‘when’ not ‘if’ because he was settled on making this happen.  Whatever was causing Malfoy’s obvious reluctance, Harry was determined to overcome it.  If Ron and Malfoy could be friends, surely the two of them could be something more.
“Oh terrific,” Pansy didn’t even lose a beat in her rant.  “Just want we need.  The great Harry Potter to save the day.  Come to rescue the poor Muggles from the evil Slytherins, Potter?  Come to show us all how wrong we are with your big bad self?  Rub it in our faces again how your lot won and we lost and we should be properly grateful and throw ourselves at your feet?”
“...bribed,” Harry acknowledged, “you into setting the two of us up on a ‘blind date’.  An unexpected dinner with your ex is not a blind date, Ron.”
As a present to all of you, Christmas and otherwise if Christmas isn't your thing, this chapter has a little of everything.
“His lack of skills is making it harder to figure out a Muggle job that isn’t humiliating,” Blaise muttered from where he was picking out notes on the piano.
“What do you think of our little lady here?” the man asked, patting the leg of the dragon Draco was still leaning against.
“Surprise me,” Harry said, knowing that to ask for a Butterbeer would be an insult to the room and a missed opportunity he would never forgive himself over.
“Are you coming?” Hermione had paused a few steps in and looked back at him.  One of the witches closest to the door shushed her.  It was like being in a library and suddenly Ron understood exactly why Hermione was so comfortable here in this place, in this life.
Robards would not be banished easily.  “Slytherin filth.  Snakes and low lifes, every one of you.”  His voice rang in Draco’s head.
The mental assault listed in the warnings is depicted in this chapter.  If this is something you want to avoid scroll down to the bottom comments where I have provided a quick summary of events and then skip down to the first section break 'oOo' to pick back up again.
A moment later Blaise stormed in, stomped across the area Greg had just danced through and collapsed in a huff into a chair.
“What?”  Draco stared down at the images in confusion.  He was holding an amazing shot of himself and Pansy.  She was singing, her expression intense and focused; he was dancing and his hair, shimmering in the light, was whipping around his head while his body twisted to the beat.  Draco could almost feel the music coming off the page.  The lighting hid as much of his face as it showed, teasing and revealing, while Pansy was fully lit and magnificent in her fierce defiance of the world.  For a moment, Draco found he could not breath as he stared down at the passion expressed in this one shot.
The music was fantastic, snarky and upbeat and catchy as hell. Malfoy croned into the microphone, his rich voice rumbling down every spine as he sang.
Harry Potter was no longer the little boy that wanted, powerless to do anything about it.  He was the Savior of the Wizarding World, one of the most powerful wizards of his generation.  He had fought a war to protect his friends and avenge the death of his parents.  He had stood against a powerful villain that had caused a two generations to tremble just at the mention of his name.  No, Harry Potter was no longer that weak little boy.
Harry shrugged, although the movement was rather lost in the jostling of the crowd. “I got some great shots from up there.”
“Getting up right before sunrise isn’t the middle of the night,” Harry shot back good naturedly, “ and the light is better first thing in the morning.”
Sure enough, Robards had broken away from Arthur and the minister and was storming in their direction.  “You’ve done it this time, Malfoy!  You’ll receive the Dementor’s kiss for sure.”
Despite the dire circumstances, Harry could not help smiling at the off-handed way Ron mentioned his ex and nodded in agreement.  They had always relied on her to be a step ahead of everyone else when it came to magic use.
Everyone poured back into the center area as the lights dimmed.  Harry found himself holding his breath.  Bodies moved in the darkness.  A hush fell over the whole club as they all waited.
Pansy had crumbled against the power of the mind that invaded hers.  It ripped through her defenses, pushing its way in and in and in.  Pansy cried out but she could not tell if the sound made it past her lips.
Harry felt a knot of anticipation start to build. This was it, the first time he would see Malfoy or the other Slytherins since the final battle, the first time he would hear their music. He found himself hopeful for what was to come, hoping the crowd would like them … no, more than that … hoping the crowd would love them.
Greg was confused how any of this related to music, or even getting them jobs, but Draco was obviously getting excited and he felt his hopes rise.
The quiet wonder and awe at being asked was clear in Ron’s voice.  It was not a refusal and they all knew it.  Pansy closed her eyes in defeat.
Could he fool Rookwood where he had failed to fool Voldemort with Harry’s life on the line if he failed?  He was a Slytherin.  Surly that meant he had the skills to pull this off.  He could agree to help, string the two mad men along with empty promises about a spell that did not exist until an opportunity came where they could all escape.  It would work.  It had to.  Draco opened his eyes, ready to try, to agree to anything to keep his family alive.
Ron greeted Malfoy casually.  It wasn’t a surprise to Harry.  His best friend's relationship with Pansy had led to Ron and Draco to put aside old grievances and become better acquainted.  The easy intimacy that had sprung up between them was a bit disconcerting to Harry, especially here of all places where so much of the animosity in their past had occurred.
“Rock and a hard place,” Ron muttered as they stepped out of the Floo at the burrow and Harry had nodded in agreement.  “Dad!”
Harry took a deep breath and acknowledged this new desire that burned in his gut was also perfectly natural. He had broken up with Ginny when he realized neither of them felt the passion they should for the other. Admitting his past interest in Malfoy, his archrival, had never been purely irritation or even platonic had been a first step to accepting his own sexuality. Now he was forced to accept that his feelings ran even deeper.
It was a bit startling how strong his voice came out, carrying over the sound of the waves on the rocks and the wind against the cliff face.  His voice seemed to carry across the grass to the bus and the band and the scared teenagers Rookwood and Dolohov had bullied and manipulated into joining them.
It took several minutes to find Arthur among the muggle claptrap that lay in towering piles everywhere.  Like the burrow itself, Harry was convinced the piles were held up by magic and would not have even ventured inside had he had the slightest inclinking that the piles of junk were left to the laws of physics alone.
“Not that I disagree with that sentiment, but isn’t that a little hard when the three of you run a business together?”
Harry pulled his best friend back into a hug.  He could not think of anything else to do, admitting to himself quietly that maybe there was not anything left to fix.
He was wearing a golden shirt that flowed, undone down to the navel and tight enough in all the right places to leave little to the imagination. Draco’s chest was smooth and nicely curved. He didn’t have Harry’s washboard abs but there was nothing extra on the tuck of his flat tummy. Forest green velvet pants, tied at the waist with a wide sash that shimmered like silk in the club lights and leather boots completed the look. He seemed to transcend common concepts like gender. It was like a godling, one of the heroes of Greek legend, brother to Apollo, friend of Hercules and Perseus, had stepped out of the legends of the ancient past to grace them with his presence.
Rookwood grinned, small and sharp and awful.  “Here we are then.  I’m sure I don’t have to explain your choices to you, but let’s review them anyway.  You can join our cause, the cause of your father and your heritage.  The one that will see you take back the respect and position that is rightfully yours.  We will destroy those who have oppressed and corrupted our people for so long, Mudbloods, blood Traitors, Muggle lovers and all those who side with them.  It will be a glorious new world and you will have a place at my side as we build it.”
It was painful to watch Malfoy establish the distance between them again, but Harry did not fight it.  The professor's reaction had confirmed that the physical attraction was mutual.  That was enough for now.  Harry watched Malfoy take another step back and he cast around in his mind for a way to keep the conversation going.  “I heard you had your own encounter with Peeves.”
Harry took a step back and tripped over Ron.  Harry glared and Ron held up his hands in surrender.  “Sorry.”
Reality passed at a different pace when kissing Harry.  When they finally parted to the sound of a throat being cleared, Draco had no idea if it had been minutes, hours or years since he last took a breath.  Shacklebolt had returned with Robards and several others had wandered over, creating quite the little audience they had been performing for.  Ron and Pansy were beaming at them as was Arthur, while Charlie was once again red-faced and trying to find somewhere else to look.
Harry wrapped his arm around the boy’s shoulders.  “Professional Quidditch isn’t about house alliances or even really team alliances, although I would appreciate it if you did not spread that little fact around.  As a young player, you can get traded around quite a bit.  Your opponents today could be your teammates tomorrow.  It’s the skills that you bring to the table that are most important.  To put you on a professional field like you are currently would be irresponsible.  Even the best players get hurt sometimes but with the way you sit your broom it’s inevitable.
Ron scratched the back of his head and squinted at him before sighing and giving in. “We're supposed to be doing things the Muggle way ... but, as long as no one finds out, I’m not sure what harm it will do.”
The morning they arrived in Manchester, Pansy slipped away early to go shopping.  They had spent four days and performed three shows in Cambridge and the level of interest they had generated in the town was insane.  Potter’s pictures had taken them from a hot ticket item to a national sensation in what felt like overnight.  Miriam was bemoaning the fact they had not rented out theaters and was scrambling to switch out locations to larger venues.  They had barely been able to leave the tour bus without being accosted by fans.
Arthur shook his head.  “I was hoping this obsession Gawain has with the Malfoys would ease with time, but if anything it seems to be getting worse.”
Neville shrugged noncommittally.  “Good luck with that.  You going to Apparate to Edinburgh to meet the band.”
Harry pulled himself together and stood there quietly, not appearing to be the least bit impatient with Draco’s long silence or his change of topic.  His bright green eyes were sharp and focused only on Draco.  It was a heady feeling.  This was how Harry had watched him during the concerts.  It made Draco twitchy and nervous and yet he thought  maybe he could spend the rest of his life under that intense gaze and be perfectly happy.
Malfoy continued in disjointed stops and starts as he struggled to explain.  “...on the stairs … I pushed him away … and then I ran.  I’m sure he thinks I’m not interested.”  There was a long pause.  “Did he tell you what he was going to do?”
“Yeah, I can see how well that worked, seeings how you are being sent to Paris after Malfoy instead,” Charlie teased.
“She dump you?” Pansy sounded more than a bit incredulous and Ron could not resist the small smile and the implied compliment.
Lost in his own realizations, Draco had stopped paying attention and missed some of the argument.  As he tuned back in, he decided whatever he missed had not been very important as Robards was still out of control and screaming about how the Malfoys were the root of all evil.
“Sure he did,” Neville said, his smile growing.  “Especially since he knew if he had denied our request, we’d have had the right to take it directly to the Minister of Magic.”
Pansy goes shopping.  She sees Draco, Harry and Ron out and about as well.  She is attacked by an unknown assailant and gets a cry out to Ron before having her mind invaded by a Legilimens spell.  Ron and Harry scare the attacker off and while Harry runs off in pursuit Ron and Draco take care of Pansy.  They take her to St. Mungos for evaluation where Ron and Harry ensure that Pansy and Draco are well treated.
“Well Harry thinks…” Ron paused and looked around like he was checking for eavesdroppers.  Then he pulled Pansy close to whisper in her ear.  “Harry thinks his obsession with Malfoy was because he liked him, but hadn’t figured it out yet.”
The past hung thick in Harry’s mind until Ron broke through the second time with a less welcome question.  “So how is single life treating you?”
Finally Draco dropped his hand.  Even Potter's rejection of him had not cooled his intense interest.  He had squared off against Potter at every opportunity.  “Look at me,” Draco remembered thinking in one encounter after another.  “I may not be your friend, but I am something to you.  You look at me and know you know my name.”
Harry started off towards the Slytherin team but paused and looked back when the Beater called his name.  “Are you going to recruit Chloe?”
Harry doesn’t want Malfoy to leave, but he doesn’t want to fight either, not anymore.  “Playing against you were always the closest games we had,” Harry offered back, quiet and respectful.  He lowers his head and looks up at him from under his lashes.
“Junior.  Senior seems to be pretty quiet in Azkaban these days since the breakout.  Although according to Robards, that’s its own conspiracy.  He’s sure there is some deep dark secret as to why Lucius did not go with the other two Death Eaters, Rookwood and Dolohov I believe it was, when they made their escape.”
Hoping to inspire a little intimacy, Harry shifted even closer and lowered his voice.  “Do you think Fred is up to something?”
Ron nodded. “That’s right.  The guy was spitting nails when they hauled him away, demanding a rematch or some nonsense.”
Harry turned his head as Fred floated by.  Sometimes it still caught him off guard, that Fred was dead.  The Weasley ghost was a pale, washed-out version of his embodied self but his expression had not changed.  He wore the overly innocent look of mischief in progress.  It was such a common expression for both Fred and George that Harry did not understand what caused Malfoys reaction.
“It just always feels like we’re on the outside looking in, you know?  No matter how many battles we fight, or how many times we take the high ground and try to do the right thing...”
“Wait is that…?”  Ron popped his head up over Harry’s shoulder to get a closer look … or to make Harry feel short.  Could be both.  “Is that Hagrid’s egg?”
Charlie shook his head.  “Didn’t Sirius escape Azkaban?  Do they have a revolving door in that place or something?”
The smile that spread on Draco’s face was every bit as ridiculous as Harry’s.  “Yes.”  So much for either of them being composed.
The opening act closed up after another song and everyone took a moment to catch their breath. The crowd dispersed a bit and people wandered off to get drinks as the crew started re-arranging the instruments and equipment on the stage.
“I was never a priority.” Ron said, wiping his eyes.  “Not a first priority or even a last priority.  I never even made the fucking list.  She just … it was all about her career, you know?  Ever since they moved her over to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement she just … there was no time for me.”
Draco closed his eyes and for a moment Harry was convinced he was going to bridge the remaining distance.  Instead he shook his head as though trying to throw off a spell.  “Not anymore,” he said with finality.  Malfoy stepped back, visibly pulling himself together.  When he returned his eyes to Harry’s he was composed.  “There was an unfortunate incident at Quidditch last year.  Fireworks timers went off early, nearly killing George.  Peeve’s doing, of course.  Fred saved his brother by diverting the fire around him, but all three are now banned from the games.”
Harry about faced and caught up to him, thrusting the picture back into the man’s face.  “This man right here?  You’re sure?  You saw him yesterday.”
Ron sat hunched over his desk in his brand new office, the halls beyond echoing in the way empty buildings do after hours.  Two weeks in and this had already become a habit, the last one to leave at night and the first one in the next morning.
“No joke.  Even Hermione….”  The lighthearted feeling that had developed in the room disappeared in an instant at the mention of her name.
The last time he had allowed himself the luxury of a dream had been just before starting at Hogwarts.  He had been eleven.
Malfoy flashed Harry a bit of a grin, but it did not reach his eyes.  “Not as flashy as being the youngest Seeker in a century, but we do what we can.”
“Yes.  You’d think the wedding was right around the corner with the way they are all clucking about.”
The Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, was standing next to an older redhead that Draco thought must be Arthor Weasley who was helping Robards back to his feet.  Draco had a moment to wonder what those two men were even doing here, which led to the thought of what were any of them doing here.  That was more than Draco was willing to tackle at the moment, so he pushed that thought away and kept scanning the crowd.
“Robards will be going on extended leave for a while.  With his injury from the war, we might be able to get him early retirement.”
Harry gave Ron a confused look and his friend nodded in agreement.  “I know, right?  Not really Fred and George’s thing.  It wasn’t for sale, it didn’t seem to go with anything, like decorations and shit.  It was very life-like, as though the creator had worked to make it look like an actual cat.  It felt like the fur should be soft rather than stone, each hair individually sculpted.  Really not the type of thing I would expect Fred and George to have.  So a few days later, I was back and the statue was gone.  But there was this cat wandering around the office, like a live one, rubbing up against my leg and leaving hair on my dress slacks.”
“Yesterday.  Her and her latest fiance, whose name I haven’t even bothered learning, have fluffed off to tour Europe until they get bored enough to tie the knot.  Why else do you think I am hanging around with you lot?”  The bitterness in Blaise voice spoke clearly his opinion of his mother's latest association.  Noemi Zabini’s string of marriages was as famous as her political intrigues.  That her political reputation and power had survived the war unscathed surprised no one.
“Harry’s got this thing about being left out.  He wasn’t an only child, but the people who raised him didn’t want him.  He was left out of pretty much everything.  It’s hard on him now, being on the outside and looking in.  If I got on the tour bus while he still wasn’t allowed, … well, it would hurt him.”
Pansy had crumbled against the power of the mind that invaded hers.  It ripped through her defenses, pushing its way in and in and in.
“No!  What …?”  Harry hadn’t expected the band to be happy they were there, but surely this was over the top.
“Fred and George are always together.  Fred doesn’t haunt a location, like the ghosts of Hogwarts.  He haunts his brother.  Where George goes Fred always follows.”
Of course thinking of Robards lead him to remember his own obsession with Draco Malfoy.  At the time his obsession with his rival classmate had been almost as intense as his focus on Voldemort, but his interest in the Dark Lord had died with him, while Draco Malfoy would still arise from time to time to haunt his thoughts.
Harry took a deep breath and acknowledged this new desire that burned in his gut was also perfectly natural.  He had broken up with Ginny when he realized neither of them felt the passion they should for the other.  Admitting his past interest in Malfoy, his archrival, had never been purely irritation or even platonic had been a first step to accepting his own sexuality.  Now he was forced to accept that his feelings ran even deeper.
Draco walked alone through the gardens of the Malfoy Manor.  The stars above him and a sliver of moonlight were all that kept him company.  The rhythmic movements of his legs and the deep in and out of the air through his lungs helped clear the turmoil in his brain.  He fought not to think, just to move.
The better news is that chapter 10 is complete as well.  It currently is sitting as a hand written version in my notebook that needs to be transcribed and beta'd, but the worst is done and I can promise it will be posted next week on schedule unless the world ends between now and then.
The attacking mind ripped out as suddenly and painfully as it had sliced into her.  She gasped for breath and fell to her knees as her attacker dashed away.  It took her a moment for her brain to catch up to what she was hearing.
Something soft shifted under Harry’s head.  He finally got his eyes to work and he blinked up at the grey eyes that haunted his dreams.
Ron laughed.  “Yeah, Harry was pretty bad when it came to Draco too.”  He tossed Pansy a bit of a mischievous look.  “I wonder if Draco’s obsession was for the same reason.”
That wasn’t the response Harry had expected.  “No,” he said slowly, narrowing his eyes at his friend.
“Ah no sir, that was…” Ron was waving a hand in Charlie’s direction even as Pansy was shaking her head, sensing like Draco had, exactly where this was going.
“What? You didn’t ...” Ron cut himself off and then pulled closer. “You didn’t do anything to the camera did you?”
For those of you who have read Passion in Paris you can skip the first section of this if you want as it is a repeat, but don't miss the section at the end which is new.
“Alright Greg,” Malfoy said, not letting the energy of the moment die. “One more time for the cheap seats over there.”
“What about my situation makes you assume I cannot feel the full weight of my position,” Malfoy responds.  “I assure you, I understand the magnitude of what I have escaped.”  His voice is calm and controlled but the superiority bread into him from infancy is still in evidence in his tone.
“Yes, I thought so,” Rookwood’s mild voice jabbed into Draco like knives, stilling the numbness away like blood seeping from a wound.  “There is something between you two.  You hide it well, Draco Malfoy, you are very good at hiding things, but reading people, well it’s my thing really.”
“Malfoy, how has Hogwarts been treating you?”  It was inane small talk, but it got the blond to look at him again.
McGonagall caught up with Harry after the game.  Chatting with the Headmistress was always pleasant.  She took him up to her office where he greeted Dumbledore’s portrait and settled down in his favorite chair.  They talked about the game, Fred and George and her favorite students.
“Augustus Rookwood and Antonin Dolohov.” Ron explained.  “They broke out a few months ago.  Rookwood is a nasty piece of work.  Got into the heads of the guards with spouses that work in the prison.  It looks like he was the one behind the release of the Death Eaters during the war as well.”
Miriam had warned them not to go out alone but Pansy knew for a fact that Draco snuck out before she did.  She had not gone more than a few blocks before she saw Ron and Harry out and about as well.  She waved, they waved back and she continued on her way.  She had too much to do before the city really woke up to allow a man to gum up the works, even one as cute as Ron.  Besides, it looked like Harry was on the hunt.  She was pretty sure she had seen Draco disappear in the same direction.
Ron wasn’t even bothering to contain his snickers.  Malfoy raised a distinguished eyebrow when Harry looked his way, his straight face too bland to be real.  Harry had to bite his lips not to lose himself in rather unmanly giggles.
Harry drew back from Draco slowly, his expression a stunned wonder, fragile and precious.  “Really?” he whispered.
He was just about to move when Malfoy’s voice picked up closer than ever and he stumbled back a few steps.  “I suppose I find Potter's lack of house pride surprising.”
Draco followed the sound of raised voices, both of which he recognized now that he was a bit closer.  Robards was arguing with Harry Potter.  Draco knew first hand that behavior never ended well.  Potter was not one to lose.
“Look at that,” Ron pointed.  “He’s using hook up wires to ignite the components.  Then he hides them so no one knows they are there.”
“Am I humming?” Pansy asked, distracted and with a soft smile on her face that Draco hadn’t seen her wear, ever.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said, going back to running his fingers through his hair.  “I still think we should keep your dad up to speed though.  Never know when that could come in handy.”
“That’s enough Antonin.”  Rookwood’s pleased calm voice brought no comfort, even as the sound of voices that had screamed themselves hoarse was replaced by the harsh panting of two men pushed beyond their limit of pain.  The smell of burnt flesh mixed with the sharp crackle of magic in the air made Draco want to throw up.
“I know, right?  But I hear she’s alright, not like her younger brother at all.  She’s a squib, works as a band tour manager, which I guess is how Malfoy got going because she's now working for him and his band.  Anyway, it sounds like they need a band photographer.”
The whole thing was crazy.  Harry Potter was a war hero.  A couple of months ago, the Daily Prophet had listed him as their number one pick for most eligible bachelor.  Draco had not even made the list.  He was a nobody in comparison, an outcast forced to play stupid games with Aurors and the Wizengamot just to keep his dignity.  Surely Draco’s life was too much of a mess … surely Draco himself was too broken for Harry to have any interest in him.
“It was a good game.”  Harry nearly groaned aloud.  Of course he started off the conversation talking about Quidditch.
Ron stood in the doorway and looked around.  A handful of witches and wizards were scattered around the room, each surrounded by stacks of paper and a plate of food.  No one had looked up at their arrival.  No one was laughing or talking or even within arms length of each other.
“Actually, there was something else,” Ron said.  “We need a Muggle camera.  I seem to remember you picked one up a year or so ago.”
Fred nodded as he passed and the two of them nodded back.  When the ghost is out of earshot, Harry took advantage of the situation to slide closer and lowered his voice.  “Doesn’t Fred normally come with George?  I mean, isn’t George here quite a bit to visit… what’s her name … the new flying instructor?”
With McGonagall gone, the snickers and giggles grew in volume as Peeves was lifted and carried from the hall.  There was also a smattering of applause as George passed and he took a moment at the doors to bow to the crowd.  Cheers broke out and a few people stomped their feet in approval.  Harry allowed himself a smile.
It felt good to be able to be there for Ron tonight even as his heart broke over what his best friend was going through.  It had been a while since he felt as close to Ron as he had tonight and Harry was looking forward to helping him with his case.
Harry stepped forward and put his hands on Draco’s arms, steadying him.  Draco was grateful for the strength.  “Who was it?”
All three men nodded their approval at this behavior.  Getting between the Weasley women and their weddings was a good way to lose more than you were willing to part with and that was a fact.
“But we lost it,” Harry mouthed along.  It did not take a genius to figure out what Malfoy was singing about.  While the beat was lively, the feel of the song was intense and filled with pain.  They were mourning what they had lost, what they had let slip away and even though the crowd did not understand like Harry did, looking around he saw that everyone in that club was mourning with them.
The fruit flavor of the Bourbon burst across Harry’s palette, calmed immediately by the citrus with a mild sweet flavor on top.
It was quiet for a bit, both men lost in their own thoughts.  Harry broke it to carefully recommend, “You should take some time off from the Aurors, get your head together.”
‘He is the Auror, not me.  He’ll know what to do.’  Harry repeated over and over even as he frantically looked for any hidden corner where he could disappear and take the bike skyward.
Arthur’s smile grew even brighter.  “I can’t think of a finer compliment,” he said, clapping Harry on the shoulder with his free hand.  “Now, do you fine boys want to help me organize this mess or are you going to come up with a convincing excuse for why you suddenly have to be somewhere else?”  His eyes twinkled at them.
It was strange in the best way, but strange nonetheless.  Greg had been keeping an eye on Draco for other strange behaviors.  There were other differences but they were harder to put into words, or at least Greg found it hard.  He had never been good with words.
“I thought he was only joking,” Pansy murmured, which was such a weird thing to say Draco could not let it pass.
Just when Harry thought he knew what to expect, the song changed. The soft lyrical tones that had overlaid the driving beat suddenly changed to something hard and fierce. Pansy ripped the microphone away from Malfoy and started rapping at an intense pace.
The smile cooled.  “Ron said you were still a pain in the arse.  I’m Charlie. The one who works with dragons.  The one it is smart not to tick off.”
The voices were already too close.  Harry was going to get caught if he didn’t leave right now.  Hating to leave, Harry forced himself to sneak quietly away, a smile stretched wide across his face.
Harry wanted to reach out to him, to catch one slender hand and not let go.  He stumbleed a few steps closer, feeling awkward and uncoordinated.  “Who do you think will win the game tonight?”  He rushed the delivery, cutting off his companion before he could speak.
Draco could feel the ridiculous smile that had taken over his face but could not be bothered to smother it.  Shacklebolt managed that for him when he cleared his throat.  A sense of foreboding had Draco tightening his hold on Harry.
“The ones in London are the best.  I don’t want some quack rummaging through her brain.  She’s already been through enough.”
“We managed to take down the great Harry Potter, didn’t we?”  Dolohov growled, kicking Harry in the ribs and back down onto his back.
“Old friend,” Shacklebolt said, sliding an arm around Robards shoulders and gently steering him away.  “How long has it been since you had a proper vacation?  Something long and relaxing, perhaps a beach, time to work on a nice tan?”
“Robards not only refused to approve my leave, he gives me this bullshit case to go find out how Malfoy is enchanting everyone.”
“Oh yes, of course it’s over … well it was … did I put it …”  Arthur’s voice faded out as he disappeared into the never ending piles of stuff.  “Ah ha!  Found it!  And Molly says I can’t find anything in here.”  Arthur put the black box like item into Ron’s outstretched hands.
“I can’t believe you voluntarily got on Noberta’s back,” Ron was still grumbling as they pushed their way into the Paris nightclub.  The redhead was a full head above the crowd making it easy to spot him even in the dim lights of the club.
“So get this, you know him and several of his buddies got sentenced to a year working with the Muggles right?”
They were both dressed in usual club fair. Harry wore a black mesh shirt, black leather duster and pants while Ron was in tight levi’s and a flowing white shirt. Both men were picking up some interest and Harry found himself tossing out a smile and a wink at a couple of girls as he passed. It was fun and harmless and it had been a while since Harry had an opportunity for either.
Draco was watching him; his silver grey eyes, sharp with interest, felt like a physical weight across his skin as he moved.  It was heady and not at all unpleasant.
Harry laughed.  “I don’t envy her the job.  Fred, George and a bunch of bored students has never been a good combination.”
Draco shook his head vigorously to clear.  “Breathing ... breathing …” he reminded himself.  The harsh words ached in his heart even as he fought to shove them away.  “They’re wrong,” he spat, giving in once again to the intense urge to argue back against critics that would never hear him.  The arguments ran through his head, crushing him down like Atlas beneath the weight of the world.  The voices in his head were pitiless; unimpressed in the face of his logic, his pleading, even his attempts to run away.  Where do you hide when the enemy has breached the gate of your mind and taken residence inside?
It was a bit of a shock when Charlie stepped in front to defend him.  “What are you talking about Robards?  He was kidnapped.  We all saw the Death Eaters threaten him as we moved into position, and as I recall his response was pretty clear.”
Despite everything going so well, Draco was annoyed with everyone.  He was still insisting that this is all somehow part of a plot by Potter to undermine them, although he could not seem to explain exactly how their increased popularity would do that.  What seemed to really upset him was the intense stare Potter would pin him with for the entire concert.  Draco said it was because it unnerved him but Pansy had a feeling it was more that Potter was making him uncomfortable and not in a bad way.
“When a band is good, that’s not unusual.”  Potters voice was low but his annoyance was clear in his tone.
It was ridiculous how happy it made him to hear his name from Draco’s lips.  Shifting a bit nervously in his chair, Harry pushed on.  “Was there something you were going to say… before all of this?”
“Do you want to leave?  We can go tell Robards’ there is nothing to find and bail on this any time we want.”
“She’s good.”  Harry clenched his hands to keep himself from reaching out to touch the wisps of fine hair that seemed to be floating in a halo around that handsome face.  It was too soon for that, he admonished himself.
He didn’t go.  Instead Harry found himself sneaking up to the corner where the hall inexplicably  changed direction and peered around the corner.  Ron had his head poked in a classroom half way down the next length of castle wall, probably looking for his brothers.  Malfoy stood next to him, tense and fidgeting.
That part was a preplanned and carefully coached declaration.  Now Ron was on his own to respond as best he could to whatever Pansy threw at him, (hopefully not literally).  Even Draco, curled up next to Harry on one of the lumpy Burrow sofas, had been unable to predict how Pansy would react, although he did warn that he should be prepared to duck.
“You rap?” Greg asked, in stunned disbelief.  Draco was staring at Pansy with a delighted smile on his face.
Draco’s head whipped around, his eyes wide, visibly startled at seeing Harry so close.  “You .. He … they’re … up to something.”
“At least your mother got you acquitted before she left.” Draco opened his eyes and stretched out his long legs in front of him.  “My father couldn’t even get himself off.”
“Mr. Weasley, what is the meaning of this!?”  McGonagall demanded.  She had developed the booming voice of all Headmasters and Mistresses.
“Oops,” Blaise responded to Draco with a cheeky grin and the laughter picked up even louder than before. “We’re not playing Phantom today are we?”
“All we’ve done for the last hour is apologize to each other.”  Pansy collapsed in a high-backed, uncomfortable looking chair in front of the line of tall windows.  Greg got to a count of eight before she was up and moving again.
“Be careful,” warned George.  He handed over his burden, a carefully wrapped something about the size of a pumpkin.  “Don’t unwrap it.”
Ron nodded and stood.  “Well I’ve had enough sitting around here.  I’m going to go find something to do.  Wanna come?”
Malfoy continued.  “I have also been informed that the Gryffindor player was informed he wasn’t ready for the major leagues.”
“Honestly, I don’t know why you even bothered with the camera.  What, are you so determined to ruin us that if you can’t prove we’re criminals you’ll just do shitty work with the promotional pictures just to take us down.  I knew that Robards would do absolutely anything to see us fail, and maybe I am naive but seeing you here trying to undermine us was a shock.  You two were supposed to be all about justice and protecting people.  This shows who you really are.  Willing to do anything to destroy those who are different.  Just prejudicial bullies.”
“Yes, Greg,” Draco said in a way that suggested he was being a bit slow but the smile on his face meant he did not mind.
How could it be okay, Draco wondered, the thought coming from someplace a step removed from the gut wrenching scene they were all playing out.  He should be panicking but all he felt was the numb certainty of how this would end.  He was about to lose this wonderfully brave man.  The final insult seemed to be that the sea, that would soon swallow so much, had already drowned the last words Draco would ever have gifted to him from this precious man in front of him.  “Harry,” Draco said, and there was nothing more.  Just his name, and a helplessness that would cost him everything.
The other player Harry was here to evaluate was the Slytherin Keeper and she was perfect.  Despite her lack of flash and pizzazz, Harry was having a hard time keeping his eyes off her.  She was always in position, reading the players in a way that was almost psychic, both her teammates and the opposition.  More than one shot was blocked that Harry had thought safely in.  Playing closer attention, Harry figured out that the Keeper was baiting the other team, tempting them into taking the shots she wanted them to take.  It was such a Slytherin way to play and Harry admired the strategy.  He had come a long way from the boy who saw anything not Gryffindor approved as cheating.
Harry shrugged, although the movement was rather lost in the jostling of the crowd.  “I got some great shots from up there.”
“Draco did, but that’s not common knowledge.” Harry confirmed.  “It’s one of the reasons he got off with such a light sentence even after he let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.  With Rookwood out it would be best to keep that information under your hat if you would.”
“It’s easy,” Kingsley lied, “and you’ll have lots of help.  Come to my office whenever you finish getting this wrapped up and we’ll talk.”
Get out!  Get out!  Pansy struggled and pushed only to retreat again against the relentless force that held her.
“And your mother.”  Harry added and then laughed at the horror he can feel coming off his best friend.
“Right, yes.  We’ve been tracking the disappearing kids for the last couple weeks.  One of my buddy’s siblings got caught up in this mess and disappeared on him.  We had gotten a tip about this place and were organizing a group to check it out when Neville showed up with news of Harry taking off after your tour bus like a bat out of hell and then the whole thing disappearing.”
“Naw,” George protested and then Fred corrected, “well yeah, someone alive maybe.  But not a ghost.  It just petrifies ghosts.”
“Petrifying someone is not a prank,” McGonagal said again, her tone weaker than before.  She was looking down at Peeves and Harry was sure her lips were twitching.
“Absolutely.  You’re perfect.”  Ron laughed bitterly and looked away. Harry grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him a little.  “Listen to me, you are perfect.  Perfect for me.  You know how the Dursleys treated me, ignoring me, turning me into little more than a servant.  I’d never had a friend until I met you.  I had years of neglect and feeling worthless and unloved.  I had a hole the size of Hogwarts inside me when we first met.  You filled that in a way no one else could.  You wanted to be around me, sought me out, made me feel special and important and needed.  No one had ever made me feel that way before.”
Ron found himself gazing into pale blue eyes, inches from his own.  When he spoke again, his tone carried the weight of a serious confession.  “So am I.”
“Only when he was grossly outnumbered and struggling to defend us as well as take you all on,” Draco snapped back and then wanted to bite his tongue.  What was he doing?  Antagonising their captures would not help them get through this.  The part of Draco that had always put his head down and did what he was told was screaming at him to simply agree to anything they asked.  It took a moment, as Dolohov growled at him and Rookwood continued to watch with eyes that saw too much, for Draco to realize that deep inside of him, the little boy who had always dreamed of being friends with Harry Potter, the part of him that had bloomed and preened under Harry's unexpected attention, that little boy was angry.
“It’s better than what I was doing before that.” Blaise moved on from muttering to grumbling.  Greg, an expert on both muttering and grumbling, was able to tell the difference.
Should he go?  Harry wondered.  He should probably go, said Hermione’s voice in his head.  It was rude to eavesdrop.
“Exactly." Ron said, nodding along, "It’s unbelievable.  Robard’s got Death Eaters breaking out of Azkaban, a rash of missing youths in Northern Scotland, and who knows what else …”
“Speaking of girlfriends and dating,” Ron said, obviously trying to regain control of the conversation.
“I’ve always thought so.”  Malfoy's eyes were tracing Harry’s face and he basked in the attention.  He wondered how long it was going to take before they could start saying what they were actually thinking.  It was not like either of them were being subtle about their interest.
Rookwood’s eyes, that had almost glowed in fervorous delight as he described the future as he saw it, flickered briefly Harry’s direction before he threw in as an afterthought, “And we will allow Mr. Potter here to live for a while longer.”
But Draco’s ire was not limited to his old rival.  Blaise got more social interaction than he was really up for just being on the stage and spent the rest of every day hidden away in his room playing his piano, which was enough to send Draco into an outrage as that removed his only viable partner in misery.
Draco still could not bring himself to look up, but he did pat the leg he was leaning against fondly.  They had come too close to disaster for Draco to be anything less than grateful to the beast for its assistance.
Harry could not contain his laughter.  Both Arthur and Ron were looking at him in confusion as he wiped his eyes.  “Arthur, that’s a lampshade.”
“Slytherin filth.  Snakes and low lifes', every one of you.”  Robards snears and I feel my own hackles rise in defense.  “You think you’re so high and mighty, but you’ll know what it is to crawl in the dirt before I’m done with you.  You and your lot all belong in Azkaban or six feet under with your rotting Lord Voldemort and I’ll not rest until I see you get exactly what you deserve.
Dolohov dropped Draco, whose legs refused to support him and he collapsed in a heap on the grass.  His head swam and his stomach rolled.  When he finally felt like he would not empty the contents of his stomach Draco lifted his head to see Dolohov walking after Rookwood, Harry floating helplessly along behind them.
The players were not lacking in technical skills either.  Harry was here to evaluate two students in particular and had arranged his visit to occur on a day both would be on the field.  The Gryffindor Beater was good, flashy and crowd pleasing in a way that would be an asset on the professional field.  He did have a couple of challenges though, the most glaring of which was the way he sat his broom.
“I saw you sneak off the bus and…” Harry trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck with a sheepish expression.
They were both dressed in usual club fair.  Harry wore a black mesh shirt, black leather duster and pants while Ron was in tight levi’s and a flowing white shirt.  Both men were picking up some interest and Harry found himself tossing out a smile and a wink at a couple of girls as he passed.  It was fun and harmless and it had been a while since Harry had an opportunity for either.
The bus had touched down on St. Kilda, an island so far north of Scotland it was almost on the other side of the globe.  The grass beneath the wheels ended in a violent plunge, down hundreds of feet to the ocean crashing below.  The angry ocean was the perfect accompaniment to the horrible torture going on in front of them.
“I called Dad, who got Shacklebolt to drag Robards and all available Aurors up here with him.  We all suspected that if they had taken both Harry and Ron this had to be more than just a bunch of kids being irresponsible.  While dad was handling the Aurors, I made a side trip to go pick up Norberta here.  She and Harry bonded when he came to visit last and I figured she could help us track him.  Good thing I did.  Not sure how we would have gotten Harry out of that mess otherwise.”
“We’re not splitting up!  We will figure out a way to get through this without being humiliated and Robards and the whole Wizengamot can go to hell.” Draco slapped his hand down hard on the arm of his chair for emphasis.
My hand tightens on my wand.  The anger that I have fought to control rears up and I grind my teeth against the curses on my tongue.  This little man, who ran in fear when faced with true power, has insulted my Lord, my people and my cause.  I shake in place at the effort to restrain violence.
They all looked at each other.  Greg closed one eye and squinted hoping it would make it easier to see them as a band.  It did not help.
Harry and Ron’s meeting with Miriam Lockhart could be condensed down to one sentence: “Screw this up and die.”  Harry was not sure if Ron had been feeling any stress before the meeting about posing as a band photographer but he certainly was now.  It still was not clear to either of them why Ron needed to pose as a photographer in the first place but Miriam was no more willing to let them back out of the job than Robards had been.
That superior tone seems to drive Robards to madness.  “You still think you are better than us, what with your fancy talk and your “escaping” without so much as a blemish.  But there will be no escaping now.  You’ll do your time, just like you were told.  A year.  Do you hear me, a full year with the Muggles, working every day, no magic.  I’ll be watching.  Be assured of that, I will be watching to be assured you learn your lesson this time, Malfoy.”
“Look at me,” Harry said.  He gently tilted the wet chin up until he could see sad blue eyes.  “I’m not saying you’ll never play professionally, just that you have some work to do first.  Fixing your seat on the broom at this stage won’t be easy, but it’s possible.  What’s worse is that trying to fix it is going to screw everything else up while you adjust.  If playing at Hogwarts is enough for you, then leave it alone and just enjoy playing.  However, if playing professionally is important to you, then do fix this and fight your way back.”  Harry squeezed his shoulders.  “Alright?”
“You too,” Harry said.  “Do you mind if I keep practising with the camera?  Unless Ron wants a turn.”
“Hmm,” Malfoy nodded.  He was still staring off after the ghost.  “Angelina Johnson, yes.”  He sounded distracted.  When Malfoy returned his gaze to Harry, he could tell the professor's attention was still on the ghost.
The band was huddled together against the bus, none of them really the worse off after the battle for control of the bus.  Harry and Ron had taken the brunt of the attack, were still taking it, their wands confiscated, lying helpless on the ground as another round of crucios reigned down on them.
He finally spotted Pansy, Blaise and Greg pressed firmly against the side of the bus, seemingly no happier to be surrounded by Aurors than they were to be surrounded by Death Eaters.  Draco had just about gathered the energy to get up and join them when yet another redhead approached him.
“Remind me not to tick Flitwick off,” Charlie joked.  Harry smiled gratefully at the two brothers for lightening the mood.  None of them would forget Remus, Fred or any of the others that had fallen in the war.  When the subject of those who had been lost came up, they didn’t avoid it, but they did not linger in the loss either.
Draco glanced at his band mates and friends to see his own confusion reflected back at him.  “You think the four of us can take on the ministry?”
One conversation at a time, however.  He needed to see what progress he could make against Draco’s defenses now before he started planning what happened next.
Draco could not think of a reply that was not beneath him, and his pride had taken enough of a beating today.  Instead he steered the conversation to less dangerous waters.  “What are you all doing here?”
“You heard me right.  A band.  Called it ‘Sly’, of all things, can you believe it?  Robards, of course hears that and thinks they’ve got to be awful, right?  … booed off the stage every night, that sort of thing? … he goes to check it out only to find out …”
“According to the papers, they are fantastic; the biggest thing to hit music in years according to one review.  There’s enough interest in them to send them out on tour.  Up one side of England and down the other.  I guess it’s already sold out.”
“Anyway, as I was saying earlier, I was taking pictures of all the Dragons on the preserve for the Prophet a bit ago, mostly because I was the only one who could get a decent shot.  Their professional photographer wouldn’t come anywhere near the dragons.”
“Oh yes, of course it’s over … well it was … did I put it …”  Arthur’s voice faded out as he disappeared into the never ending piles of stuff.  “Ah ha!  Found it!  And Molly says I can’t find anything in here.”  Arthur put the black box like item into Ron’s outstretched hands.
There was a flash of panic in Draco’s eyes.  “Yes.”  His voice came out a bit high and Draco cleared his throat and tried again.  “Yes, there was.”  He put down his silverware carefully and then slowly turned.  “I know it is a bit early … I certainly would not want you to feel under any obligation.  Not that you would.  There is no reason…”
George had the grace to look sheepish even as he started in on their defense..  “You said we couldn’t prank the students during mealtimes but you didn’t say anything about the other inhabitants of the castle.”
Ron cast Harry a questioning look but Harry shook his head.  “I didn’t do so well at the Maze for the Triwizard tournament.  That’s when I lost Cedric.  I hate to say this, but we will probably be ahead to wait and take on the Death Eaters rather than the labyrinth.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but otherwise let the comment go.  He knew there was more to stalking Malfoy fifth year than he wanted to admit to himself at the time.  It wasn’t until the whole thing was over, Voldemort was defeated and he was finally pulling himself together that he finally realized his affection for Ginny had been more about his love for her family than any specific attraction towards her.  It took even longer to admit that the rivalry between him and Draco was as much about the fact that the boy was pretty as anything else.  Harry had always loved staring at Draco and saying he hated him gave him the perfect excuse.
Draco led him to a large cherry wood room, with golden mandalas carved on the walls and ceiling.  The room itself was dominated by a large bar with two high leather chairs.  It was just perfect for a cosy chat pulled up to the bar being served the latest fashion in Wizarding Alcohol.
“Hey don’t look at me, my nails are a wreck from all of those doors.”  Ron teased and Harry smiled back.
Arthur smiled.  “Well, you let enough stuff come out of your mouth, eventually something falls out that’s of value.”  But Arthur’s cheeks were ruddy as Harry pulled the man who had become like a father to him into a hug.  Of course, Ron followed up with a hug of his own.
“Bourbon, Curaçao triple sec, cranberry juice, lime.” Draco identified them.  “The Bourbon is from my personal stash Potter, so you better appreciate it.”
The war was no more kind to the Malfoys than the other Slytherin pure-bloods.  He is an outcast now, like the rest of us and I expect even now the Wizengamot are re-enforcing exactly how far his family has fallen from power.
“If you could get us out of this waste of time assignment that would be awesome,” Ron perked up at the thought but Arthur shook his head.
Harry shrugged and looked back out the window.  His conversation with Neville had ended with the same awkward sadness.  It wasn’t that he didn’t understand why Longbottom was working on this.  It was too late and Dumbledore was dead, but if someone had thought to work on something that would reanimate dead tissue before he had died then maybe…  They couldn’t change the past, but maybe the cure the old Headmaster had so desperately needed could help someone in the future.
‘When I feel that way about someone, the way you feel about Mrs. Weasley, that’s when I’ll propose.” Harry found himself saying.
Draco smiled at his own foolishness and he began to walk once again.  The tightness in his chest easing as he indulged in the memory of what it was to be rescued by the great Harry Potter.
Ron’s expression turned hopeful.  Harry shook his head and Ron sighed before responding.  “Angelina Johnson, yes.  That witch is a saint for putting up with both of the twins.  They all seem happy with the arrangement though.  Except McGonagall, of course.  Every time I see her, she asks if I would be willing to switch locations with my brothers.”
Draco was not thinking about Harry Potter.  He was absolutely NOT thinking about Harry Potter.  Why would Harry Potter have a crush on him?  It was ridiculous.  Draco Malfoy, the son of a convicted Death Eater, the man Harry himself had called his arch-enemy, … no, the whole thing was absurd.  He and Harry had never exchanged a civil word in the entire time they had known each other.  Pansy was delusional and Draco was not thinking about this anymore.
Ron shook his head.  “I asked her.  I was hurt, but I thought, you know, something big came up.  People in danger and they needed her, something like that, you know.  But there wasn’t.  She just forgot.  Just ‘slipped her mind’.” Ron’s fingers making quote marks in the air.  “I can’t keep doing this.  I can’t keep making her my whole world when she can’t even be bothered.”
“Right, right,” Draco nodded as he bounced up from his seat and started pacing.  Pansy stopped her own pacing to watch him.  All of them were watching him.  When Draco got an idea, he lit up like Hogwarts at Christmas.  It was impossible to look away.
The two of them stood together, sniffling the only sound in the room.  Finally Ron lifted his head and turned towards the old couch, Harry following and settling next to him.  “Do you want to talk about it.”
He had not been dancing long when a pair of strong arms slid around him from behind and suddenly Draco’s dance became something else.  He did not look back, not wanting to break the spell being wrapped around him.  Where his hips and arms had been telling a story of brutal defiance against the world, now the form behind him echoed back a harmony of comfort and support.  Tenderly caressing hands softened his movements, never stopping or hindering.  The energy of the night changed from desperate denial to a calm so powerful, it swept everything else away.  Draco had not known until that moment how much he needed the calm he found in the arms of a stranger.
Walking into the bus was like entering another world, one that neither Ron nor Harry had ever been a part of.  The white tiled floor with its tasteful mosaic seemed to repel the dirt from their shoes even as they walked across it.  The large crystal chandelier in the center of the arch way dominated vaulted ceilings of a height similar to those in the Great Hall at Hogwarts surrounded by intricate crown moldings.  Everything shimmered a pale gold and was open and bright, catching the morning sun from a series of windows across the ceiling that opened up into the heavens.  It was breath-taking.
That Malfoy had struggled to accept Harry, that he had expected prejudice when there was none and that he had rejected Harry because of it, all of that probably should bother him.  It didn’t.  He had too much experience with prejudice himself not to understand what Draco faced.  Instead Harry was caught up in the fact that his old rival had admitted he was wrong.  Malfoy’s apology to Ron still rang in his ears.
The man on the ground pushed back his hood.  The long, pale, twisted face grinning up at him was not the one Harry had expected.
They roamed through most of the Weasley home before they both shared a ‘Duh’ moment.  “He’s in the workshop!” they said almost in unison.
Ron shifted the parchment over so his best friend could see.  “Yeah.  The owl dropped it off this morning.”
Pansy tucked herself up under Draco’s chin and smiled happily.  It had been years since the two of them were a couple, but they were still comfortable being in each other’s space.
“He was messing with the ingredients in the potions lab.”  Malfoy nodded but he was still inching backward.
Nothing. No active spells. No magical residue from potions. The only thing affecting these people was the energy of being here. Satisfied, Harry stuffed his wand back in his sleeve and gave himself over to just enjoying himself. He smiled and laughed at the people around him who smiled happily back, as they all bounced and danced together. It was marvelous.
“Alright Greg,” Malfoy said, not letting the energy of the moment die. “One more time for the cheap seats over there.”
“I can’t believe you voluntarily got on Norberta’s back,” Ron was still grumbling as they pushed their way into the Paris nightclub. The redhead was a full head above the crowd making it easy to spot him even in the dim lights of the club.
Harry looked like he was gritting his teeth in frustration.  “Look, do whatever you are going to do Robards, but I will not help you undermine Malfoy’s success and you can be sure I am going to stick close enough to them to make sure no one else does either.”
Ron shrugged.  “There is enough distance between the London branch of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes and Hogsmeade that I tend to miss most of the fall out.”
He had been told that the great Harry Potter would be in his class at Hogwarts.  Looking back Draco still wasn't sure if his father had meant the information as encouragement or a warning.  Years later, he could still feel the excitement he had felt then.  The chance to meet Harry Potter, to possibly make a powerful friend who could help him carry the weight that even at eleven he was already feeling.  It was a hope and a dream that even now, all these years later, still held a bittersweet sway on his heart.  His hand reached up towards the heavens, remembering another moment he had reached out in hope.
“He’ll come around.  In fact, you might find the next time you talk to him that his reluctant attitude has already begun to thaw.”
“Can he break through the wards on the bus?” Harry asked Draco, his wand out as he glared defiantly up at the mad man above them.
Surely there was some place he could find peace, a dream, a fantasy.  It did not have to be real.  Draco dug through this mind, trying to remember the last time he had allowed himself the simple pleasure of a wish.  He had been caught up in the wishes and dreams of others for so long; his mother’s, his father’s, Voldemort’s.  Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had a wish that was for himself alone.  It had to have been years ago, before Voldemort had ruined his life, before the war, before school, before Hogwarts.
Draco looked up and up and up.  A Horntailed dragon looked down at him, and seated high on his back, grinning and only a bit worse for wear, was Harry Potter.  “You alright there Draco?”  Harry’s hoarse voice was filled with amusement.
“No mate.  When Harry gets going on Quidditch these days it's all technical jargon.  Ruins the game if you ask me.  I prefer to sit in the stands and cheer.”
Harry and Ron had sat in the Gryffindor risers for old times sake and the team was close by.  A new round of cheering went up when he approached and again when he congratulated them on their win.  He gave the Seeker a friendly pat and then pulled the Beater he had been sent to evaluate aside.
It was obvious that Draco was still reluctant, but Pansy did not have the strength to do anything but put her faith in Ron.
Harry had never had the opportunity to root for Malfoy, always on the other side of a bitter confrontation, whether Quidditch or House Points or … well everything. But, things were different here. The Slytherin was Harry’s classmate and fellow wizard and Malfoy his and his success was something that would reflect on him too. Harry was truly hoping Robards was wrong, that the Slytherins were not cheating the system, but had found a way to excel despite everything that had been stacked against them.
The trip to Edinburgh was supposed to be a time to just kick back and relax.  Ron and Harry had both been invited to take this trip with the band.  As Harry stood on the curb, watching the bus pull away without him, he could not help feeling like the odd man out once again.  That it had been his idea did not make it any better.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Lucius is not dumb.  Sit quiet for two years, or break out and get hunted for the rest of his life.  With the prison reforms, it’s not like that’s a hard call.”
“Oh Lord, this IS about Malfoy.”  Ron collapsed back in his chair and let out an exasperated huff.  “It’s going to be fifth year all over again, with you following him around like a lost puppy.”
“What do you want Rookwood?” Draco pulled Pansy behind him, a bit surprised that she went without a fight.  Hearing the Death Eaters voice so soon after his attack on her mind was undoubtedly affecting her.  Behind the two former associates of his father, Draco could see Harry struggling to sit up.  Even after everything he had gone through, Harry was still trying to get to him, to help them.
Rookwood tossed Draco a hard look over his shoulder before heading off towards the drop off.  “Bring him along, Antonin.”
‘Oh’, Draco thought.  His estimation of his own intelligence dropped significantly as he finally put the whole thing together.  Harry had seen them sneaking in.  Maybe because of his elevated view as he hung above his tormentors, or the fact that Rookwood, Dolohov and Draco all had their back turned, or because it was impossible to hide a dragon that size in any bunch of trees … Whatever it was, Harry had seen the Aurors coming, had known they were about to be saved.  He had asked Draco to stand against Rookwood not to save his own skin, but because if he didn’t Draco would find himself caught up in the arrests.
“Highly intelligent individual,” Ron said as both he and Harry cringed back yet again from Norberta.
“No she does not,” Ron protested.  “I work hard not to have any kind of history with man eating monsters.  I got enough of that in school.”  Harry nodded his head in agreement.
“It’s nice to get an unbiased opinion.  Breaking up… well it’s hard ... hard not to feel like I don’t measure up.  I mean my best friend is Harry Potter.  I adore the git, but standing in his shadow is a bit … I don’t know.  It’s hard.  He’s a tough act to follow on the best of days.  Sometimes it’s hard to know if I’m doing alright, just being me.  And then to have Hermione tell me that I’m too much… “
Draco shook his head.  “He’s a Legilimens expert, taught the subject at one point.  He attacked her mind, so he was looking for something, searching for something he thinks she knows that he needs.”
“No,” Harry said firmly and suddenly he was furious at Hermione for making Ron ask such an awful question.  “No, you’re not.”
They pushed forward until they were right at center stage, fairly close up in the mosh pit of pressed bodies bouncing to the music of the band opening for ‘Sly’.
“Seeing for myself has proven more effective in convincing me of the truthfulness of your words.  I apologize for not accepting your assurances.  Now help me.  How do I fix this?”
Living with a band on tour was its own form of hell: road food, little sleep, constant demands and a new crisis of the day that always seemed to hit right about meal time.  Ron’s favorite part was late at night, or early morning rather, after a concert, when they were all high on adrenaline.  Greg would be showing off his new muscles to whoever was stupid enough to be watching, while Blaise threw food at him.  Harry and Draco would be making out while Blaise threw food at them.  Pansy would be curled up at his side rating Blaise’s current toss, usually badly, until Ron’s laughter drew Blaise’s fire at which time Pansy would return the food with what even Blaise acknowledged was deadly accuracy.
“Good.”  Ron had a pleased smile on his face that dropped as he registered Harry’s suspicious expression.
“But we lost it,” Harry mouthed along. It did not take a genius to figure out what Malfoy was singing about. While the beat was lively, the feel of the song was intense and filled with pain. They were mourning what they had lost, what they had let slip away and even though the crowd did not understand like Harry did, looking around he saw that everyone in that club was mourning with them.
“Being the head of Slytherin house has its perks.”  The professor's tone was polite but his body was posed for flight.
He left the Headmistress’s office frustrated and headed off to find Ron.  Coming to the end of yet another empty corridor he heard voices.
The two men glared at each other, Robards a pale angry little man versus Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding world.  It was no surprise who backed down first.
Harry played with the camera settings for a moment before taking off the lense and aiming it towards the dragon.
Luckily the one time Slytherin Seeker did not seem to mind.  Malfoy smiled at Harry in a way that softened his features and lit up his eyes.  “Yes,” he agreed.  “Ms. Rockheart was raving about your invitation to try out for the team.”
Watching Harry pant through the pain, Draco found himself wondering if it was worth all the crap Potter had been through.
With Ron gone, Harry found himself wanting to get caught up in the excitement of the crowd.  The beat was good, the adrenaline high and everyone seemed loud and happy.  Harry almost felt bad sneaking out his wand and doing a quick diagnostic of the people around him.
“Yes!  Wait, that sounds like something that came with it.  Just a moment.”  Sure enough, a few minutes later Harry had the power cord and a couple of additional lenses packed away with the camera in a nice case slung over his shoulder.  “What did you say you needed it for again?”  Arthur asked as the two men turned to go.
“Artistic jobs are as hard to come by in the Muggle world as they are in ours, darling,” Pansy said with obvious regret.
“No, it’s true,” Ron whispered back with a giggle.  “I mean it makes sense doesn’t it.  I don’t know anyone who puts as much energy into each other as those two did that were not already in a committed relationship.”
“You’re alright!” Miriam burst through the door in a whirlwind.  She threw herself at Draco, wrapping herself around him.  “They said you had been attacked, ended up in hospital, oh I would never forgive myself if anything ever happened to you kids.”
That was it.  That was the last straw.  “I’m going to my room,” Draco announced.  “Please come get me when the world has once again returned to normal.”  He dropped the picture he was holding back onto the table and swept out.
“What?,” Ron struggled to stay on his feet pressed in between all of the bodies. He was obviously miserable in the noise and the heat.
“There’s a whole rash of disappearances from that area,” Ron said.  “Most of them youth.  I keep telling Robards that we need to send an investigative team up there to see what’s going on.”
The Gryffindor / Slytherin game was fantastic.  It had been a while since Harry had the pleasure of just sitting and watching.  As a professional Quidditch player, Harry had a much greater appreciation for the strategy of the game and the mates he currently played with outclassed anything he had achieved as a student at Hogwarts.  But the raw energy the students displayed on the field was infectious and the excitement of the crowd addicting.
Pansy felt loved and cared for in a way she could not remember ever experiencing before.  Snuggling down into the warm blankets Ron had wrapped around her, content with his arm around her shoulders, Pansy could almost forget the horror that had come before.  She felt precious.  It was a heady feeling to have someone’s complete attention on her in such a personal way.  Ron was putting her needs above everything else, above his own comfort, he was defending her and protecting her.  These were not things Pansy was used to, but she wanted them … oh how she wanted.
Arthur’s smile was kind and understanding.  “Of course.  Your Mum loves you, but she can be a bit overwhelming when her plans fall through.  She did so have her heart set on Harry marrying Ginny and you marrying Hermione and all of you moving into the burrow to regularly pop out grandchildren for her to spoil.”
Draco could hear Harry’s weak, “No, don’t.  Leave him alone,” and the sounds of the lunatic trying to get up again.
Malfoy was going to leave, shifting away from Harry, casual and yet persistent.  He opened his mouth to speak again, no doubt to excuse himself from the conversation.
“What do you mean they aren’t doing anything wrong!”  Robards was bellowing.  “They’ve got half of England throwing money at them!”
“...and got Harry Potter thrown off a cliff!” he was screaming at Arthur.  “He’s a murder!  His whole bloody family should have their souls sucked out and their bodies dumped in an unmarked grave!  Their precious manor should be leveled and the grounds salted!  They are evil, vile …”
“No, no.  You boys run along and do what you’re told.  It won’t hurt anything to check and maybe take the time to build some bridges while you are there.”
“Don’t you remember her,” Charlie asked, patting the large lizard like dragon with black scales on the nose while both Harry and Ron were keeping as far back as possible.
“That too,” Pansy smiled at them.  “I’m the middle child in a big family.  We do what we must to get attention.  My parents hated the guitar ... and the rapping.”
“I don’t understand, why are you going in as a photographer in the first place.  It’s not like they won’t know who you are and why you are there?  Robards is not subtle about his dislike and your being an Auror isn’t a secret.”
Draco’s smile had to be well past ridiculous now and it did not have anything to do with Harry’s over the top estimation of how his band was doing.  As he could not stop his face from pulling that expression, he buried it in Harry’s shoulder, surrounding himself in the warmth that poured from the man he loved.
“Hu?”  Harry leaned back against his seat again, his face contemplative.  “They are playing with Petrification?  Why?”
“Actually, there was something else,” Ron said.  “We need a Muggle camera.  I seem to remember you picked one up a year or so ago.”
Harry shook his head.  “He was in a tough spot.  Death Eaters living in his home, threatening him and his parents.  I’m not saying I agree with his choices, but I definitely would not have wanted to be in his shoes.  Besides, your dad said it best.  We all have to let the past go, let everyone prove who they are now, or we’ll be fighting the war all over again.  He said it better than I did, but the idea is sound.  Malfoy’s just trying to live his life.  I’m not a fan of us tromping in there breathing down his neck without a good reason.”
In his mind's eye, Ron could see his letters and Harry’s and maybe others buried under paperwork.  Maybe Hermione told herself ‘One more report’ and then she would look at them.  Or maybe she was smart enough not to lie to herself.  Hermione had always been the smartest out of them all.
Pale grey eyes seemed to stare out of the fireplace at him with a tinge of sadness that Harry had always noticed on the originals despite himself.  There were many times Harry found himself wishing to give comfort where he knew it would never be welcome.
There in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the magical hospital, Pansy tugged on Ron until he bent down into range.  Then she leaned up and laid her lips on his.  It was a chaste kiss, but the tingles and joy that burst along her skin were as intense as anything she had ever felt.  She pulled back and smiled at his dazed look.  “Thank you,” she said softly.
Harry could literally see the moment Ron’s strategic mind kicked in and another thought occurred to him.
“Oh,” Arthur said with a shrug and his usual good humor as he stuck the lampshade under one arm and headed back into the mess.  “Molly will be devastated that she missed a chance to fatten Harry up.”
“That doesn’t sound right,” Harry shook his head.  “Neville said something about healing and dead tissue.  Not resurrection or bringing things back to life, just tissue.”
There is a pain in his chest that reasserts itself every time he takes a moment to breathe over the lack of word from Pansy, but if asked he would say he was relieved.  When things calm down he’ll go after her, make it up to her, help her see what a good thing this is for his career.  Right now, things are too new; it will calm down eventually.  He’ll get through the worst of these reports, his men will close some of the open cases … it will get better.
“No!  Ummm…. I mean….” Harry dropped his head into his hands.  “Can we start this conversation over?”
“The man has flipped his lid, completely crazy.  I’m telling you Harry, you should be glad you never joined.  He's gone round the bend.”
Harry wanted to sigh in frustration at his friend's lack of interest in the finer points of the game.  The sound of Malfoy sighing for him had him shoving a hand into his mouth to suppress a chuckle.  Harry could almost see the long pale fingers rub at the line of tension just beneath his white/gold bangs.  “Miss Chloe Rookheart, the Slytherin Keeper, found me after the game.  She came to ask for time away from school to attend the try-outs with Harry’s team.  He offered to sponsor her.”
“‘Ms. Parkinson’, listen to you.  It’s obvious the whole thing was staged, faked to encourage your sympathies.  I can’t go sending Aurors after every random lovers quarrel.  I’ve already got Shacklebolt breathing down my neck about those two missing Death Eaters.”
