Harry wanted to laugh at their scene and he could see Ginny beside the window trying to muffle hers. Instead he cleared his throat and said :
"They almost like him and you heard them, they accepted him. Why are you doing that ? Why are you doing that to you?"
"I don't know?" Harry was getting frustrated now. "Malfoy and I would never be together, okay? He hates me as much as I hate him."
They broke apart when they heard Headmistress McGonagall clearing her throat, announcing she's waiting for them. The Slytherin got up quickly and proposed a hand at Harry to help him. Harry took it but his body was aching when he was on his feet.
"Ph shut up Malfoy." That made his lover stop on track in shock. Harry rolled his eyes and waved his hand in the direction of the lockers. "Accio brooms." They looked at him in disbelief but no one dared to say something. "Now we need to be good on this team. Draco, I don't want to fight with you with y-"
"We couldn't find Harry after we got off the train." Answered Hermione accusingly.
"Er.. I'm bi but how does that matter?" Harry was confused. There were too many things to process at once.
"Don't tell me you didn't see how Harry was obsessed with Malfoy in sixth year. Plus, he defended him two months ago. He didn't stop looking at him since he entered tonight. Makes sense for me to want to date him."
"Are you serious?" Said Harry interested. " You think other houses would like the idea of mixing our team?"
"What?"
"Congratulations Mister Potter, once again you made your House proud of you." She looked at him with a proud smile. "As you know, you can come to my office and ask me anything."
"What are you talking about? Draco is not my—"
"I can see you're all excited to play." The lady tried to hide her excitement but everyone knew her love for the sport. "As you may be wondering, we're all here to set up the team and conditions. As many of you know, you have more experience so these Eight's years teams won't play with others years but with others house. I want to see fair-play AND respect for each member and team, am I clear?"
Both of them tried to follow the tiny flying object without disturbing their teammates only when the Gryffindor flew past the blonde Slytherin and almost fell on him.
"I.. My friends from secondary school don't know that I'm bi but they always thought my obsession for that dude was weird... I haven’t talked about it to anyone."
Harry walked toward him, he grew up and now he was taller than Draco.
Harry pulled away for breath when Draco went back on Harry's neck and put deep kisses who would certainly leave marks after. The boy who lived didn't mind at all, he waited that night since he had his letter from McGonagall. He was certain the Slytherin were invited too since Harry testified for him and the Headmistress knew these students were just children in this war.
He couldn't keep his face straight when he walked toward Ginny. She seemed to not really understand what happened but said nothing. When he went upstairs he could hear them whispering loudly.
"Do you already have a photobook with all the pictures you’ve taken so far? When did you start taking photos?" Darcy asked greedily.
The room fell silent, an awkward silence filling the air, something that seemed to happen quite often if Harry was honest.
"You’ve talked about me, Potter? Don't tell me you missed me this summer, too?" Malfoy laughed and sent an answering glare in Gabe’s direction.
They have to play with Slytherin. Harry has to spend time with his lover after school but pretending they hate each other. Why did he say to Draco that he wanted to play a game against his friends and see how far they were going to go with their plan to set them up.
"So, the Saviour saved the game today." Said pansy with a small smirk. "What favor will Gryffindor ask to the Headmistress?"
But Ron was right. Everyone looked at him with big eyes and a small smile. The first years gasped in excitement when the Golden trio walked toward their old Gryffindor table. Whispers started at the same time they sat in the middle of the table, next to Ginny, Neville, Dean and Seamus, turning their heads toward Headmistress McGonagall who glared at them.
The kiss was messy and passionate at first, both depending on it and fighting to have the dominance before Draco let Harry take the lead and then it was more light. Their tongues danced in rhythm when Draco put his hand on Harry's messy hairs.
"And we'll keep on fighting till the end."
you didn't punch him when you found him earlier. You took a picture of him instead."
"Nice game, Malfoy." He whispered back and kissed him again.
But Harry couldn't be so sure. Darcy’s  description sounded like it might be Draco. But how would the git end up here anyway? He's too much of a pureblood to be in a muggle school so it couldn't be him.
Harry looked confused for a second. How the hell did she know that?
Ron pushed Hermione to the buffet and served her a drink. Harry stays at the entrance, watching the group talking to each other. It was like it was a chic party, everyone was dressed amazingly and they acted really civilians but also without a chaperon to tell them how to behave. The first and second years were chatting on the corner, not really certain if they should be here or not but Harry was sure that would help the future relations between Slytherin and others houses if they could be friends with Gryffindor.
"That was an accident.." whispered Draco with a sob. "I never wanted any of that, I never wanted to be his slave. I'm sorry Ronald. I'm sorry about all the things I did to you or your girlfriend."
The Great Hall was full of students chatting and being excited about the new young people who will be sorting. All summer some older students went to help the professors to repair it and now they were really grateful to see it like the war never happened.
Harry's head snapped at Ginny's voice. She was smirking and laughed when the others looked in horror. Harry was about to respond when someone told something unexpected.
Then Harry got in his car and drove to Grimmauld Place.
"I should go home”, Harry said with a small smile and got up. "See you on Monday, Gabe. Thank you for... the talk."
"Actually we already asked something before the party." Said Harry without looking at Pansy but he could feel Draco's hand squeezing in question.
"You know it's not about me Draco.."
"Harry Potter caught the Snitch. SlytherDor wins !"
"Finally, I can't take mother's word about getting you back and how nice we are as a couple." Sighed Ginny happily
Some gasped in surprise and Harry could feel tension coming between Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. And for a change, all Gryffinfors and Slytherin looked at him with a common idea. Harry dances on his feet, looking at the ground. He wasn't a leader but everyone expected him to be one.
That reminded Harry about one thing and searched for the blonde and found him with Pansy and Ginny, laughing at something the girls were saying. He was wearing a black tuxedo with a green shirt and silver tie to add some light. He was gorgeous, smiling and happy for the first time in years, eyes shining in life and love. When he stood next to his lover he grabbed his hand and squeezed it hard.
"They were scared for their life. Pansy just said out loud what other people could think. I'm sure there were Hufflepuffs and Racenclaws who thought the same." Said dismissively Harry, eyes always on the blond boy. "Plus, they got a second chance by McGonagall. So if she thinks it's okay for them to be here, then we should think the same."
Ron was red and Harry wanted to cry in happiness. Never in his life he thought this would happen. Even if he knew Malfoy more than them he never thought they would accept him that quickly.
"I knew that it would work!" And then give a big slap on Harry's back who growled in pain.
Pansy and Ginny were fangirling at the sight but Harry wink at Ginny knowingly. She turned red and huffed in embarrassment.
"I think you missed his face when I took your hand earlier. He seemed pretty shocked and angry about it."
"Move your ass Malfoy, I won't wait for you!"
"We're not lovers!"
"Maybe this year won't be as awful as we thought. These little shits will be quiet." Said Ginny in murmur to the trio, a smirk on her face.
"Ron, some houses don't have enough good students to form a proper team!" Remarked Hermione.
"You undercover I know. But you broke up with her, right?"
"Weasley can save a thing,
"Harry.." It was like a plea and it sounded nice in the Gryffindor's ears. Harry grinned when he was just a meter away from the blonde.
"We will see tonight”, Colin said before Harry could answer. The group looked at him questionably and he sighed. "Don't tell me you forgot about tonight."
"Enough, Darcy. You're scaring him with all your questions!" Gabe sighed and pulled her down on her seat.
The bleachers started being filled up with the other years and at the same time, the Headmistress made her appearance. That was weird because McGonagall only requested the Eighth year on the pitch. It didn't seem to bother his best friends because Ron put his arm on Harry's shoulder with a big smile and pushed him so they could be in the first row.
Before he could understand what was happening he heard a whistle. At first he thought there was a fault but he could feel the vibration on his right hand.
"Mate, you're acting weird" patted Ron to invite him to sit on the couch. "Do you really have the guts for that ferret?"
"The war is over guys!" He said louder, turning his head to his friends who looked at him with bug eyes. "The war is over, I'm sick of these childish fights so if you don't mind, shut the fuck up and let's have a good year for once."
"I mean, I didn't really look at her that way but since we're repenting.. don't you think she's pretty?"
Dean, who was close behind, grabbed the Quaffle when it fell and flew slowly. It was like a dance when he dodge the two others chasers and then he threw the ball to the upper ring. Their Keeper failed to defend it and that was their first goal !
"Now, the first match will begin in ten minutes, please be ready."
"Hello class, my name is Susan Preventi and I will be your teacher for most of your classes." She put her stuff on the front desk and wrote her name on the board. "Let's begin, shall we?"
"She tried to give Harry to Voldemort Dean.."
------
"Harry.. I.." Draco couldn't stop looking at the ring but he tried to reach the Gryffindor with his hand. "Harry this is.. how did you?"
He had to spend the early summer at the Ministry to testify for or against people, sending some to Azkaban, saving others from worse sentences. The Malfoy's were one of them. He testified to prove Draco innocence at the surprise of everyone. He didn't talk about it to his friends but they never brought up the subject. He let Lucius Malfoy rot in prison though. He hated this guy and to his own surprise, Malfoy didn't seem unpleasant to see his father being put out there for almost all his life.
Harry turned to face Draco, keeping humming the song, putting his forehead to the blonde, closing his eyes.
"Don't say that mate, you save the world ! They look at you with admiration!"
"Potter !"
"Ron, you okay?" He pained to ask, his mouth was dry.
"Both. It could be a unique request or both requests for each house. It's up to you."
"Maybe right now but better sooner than never!" Exclaimed Ron in acceptance.
"Can you stop talking about my sexuality ? It's none of your business, plus, we're in the middle of the Great Hall and the ceremony has finished if you didn't notice!"
"You're mine!"
The next day Seamus sat beside Ron on their Potion lecture so Harry had to sit beside Malfoy. It was hard for both of them to act like it was a torture but each times their fingers touched they gripped them for a second before making disgust noises and groan in annoyance about their proximity.
Before Harry could respond the door of the Great Hall opened again to let the Slytherins walk. Harry's eyes locked on the group and followed them with a glare when they went across the room to their table. The sight of the blonde made his heart beat increase but no one dared to say a thing. For the people around Harry, they could think he was sending a death glare to the boy but at the same time Draco sat at his table Harry growled loudly.
Darcy, who had led them through the throng of people to find a table, turned on her heels to face Gabe and Harry. "Did you just say Malfoy? As in a blonde dude, pale skin and kinda sexy-looking?"
"What made you think that?"
People started shouting in happiness while the little group of Gryffindor looked at Harry with a sigh, only Ron looked at him with a calculating mind and then smiled. Harry didn't understand at first but then something hit him.
Before they could do anything else, their team took them for a big hug and celebration.
People sighed at their interactions when the dark skinned boy on Harry’s right slowly leaned closer.
The ring was a black and silver, with a little emerald gem. It was simple but it was chic enough and it reminded Harry of Draco. Harry's mouth went dry, Draco didn't make any sound since the moment he saw the ring and it scared Harry. Was it too soon?
Both Harry and Malfoy looked outraged at that comment.
Both men were on their little word before the applause and Ron's voice got them out of their dream.
After that he left the common room and walked toward the Astronomy tower. He was surprised to see Ginny here.
"Dean, Draco, Blaise, you're the chasers. Ron you're the Keeper, Greg, Cormac, you're the beaters. I want you to play as a real team. First you will be close to your teammates and observe how the others will play then. Malfoy is surely the fastest here after me so when you see an opening, give him the Quaffle. Beaters, your first job is to protect your Chasers but if you can then attack the Keeper or Seeker around the middle/end of the game. They will be more dangerous at that time."
"Who would be captain?" Asked a Ravenclaw girl.
The shout wasn't meant to be loud but all the students who were still on the stairs could hear it.
Harry gave an elbow to Ginny when she said that and looked at her angrily. The silence in the room made Harry uncomfortable too so he took a deep breath and kept walking to the Gryffindor Tower. Seeing no one was moving he talked louder.
"What are you doing, Potter ?" Hissed Goyle in anger.
"But what if.. what if the school doesn't accept us? What if the Daily Prophet discover it and spread horror about -"
"How could you suggest that Ginny, he's your ex!"
"And I'm sure you will handle this well”, a man on the girl’s right added.
"Hey ! I never said I like him !"
"Yeah, I think they will try to set us up."
The Snitch kept flying toward the ring and even if Ron was aware of what was happening below him he couldn't dodge in time both of the players and the three of them collided and crashed on the yellow circle.
He glanced once more to the green table to see silver's eyes on him. Draco's expression showed surprise but also something else Harry couldn't determine right away. They looked at each other for some time before Goyle pushed him on the arm to make him look away.
Ginny and Harry looked at each other then looked at all the Gryffindor on the room.
"Hey, quite an enter. What took you so long to come ? The ceremony was about to start!" Asked Neville, trying to be mad at them but smiled in amusement.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out. He didn't know that he had been searching for Malfoy. He turned his face to look at his friend, giving him an apologetic smile.
"Draco Malfoy, I love you and I want you forever. I know we're still young and it's not an engagement ring but a promising ring."
"You should be more careful ! They almost discovered it!" Whispered the red-haired girl.
After all, some people didn’t turn out to be who Harry thought they were. Dumbledore had used him and his family in a war. Snape had been evil but had been used to spy yet had still done bad things. Mrs Malfoy had protected him to protect her son. So maybe Malfoy wasn't that bad. But Harry couldn't imagine being friends with the git.
"What? What do you mean?"
Harry decides to let them talk. Keeping their plan to a surprise. You know. As an entertainment. This year will be their best.
Everyone shouted and clapped their hands in congratulation while Harry took the black ring and put it on the long pale finger. The green gem was shining even better on the hand. Drzco intertwined his ginger with Harry's and pulled him closer, kissing him with so much move and passion.
The Quaffle was in game again and this time the RavenPuff was more coordinated, the beater trew both Bludgers to Goyle who was the more powerful beater. Unfortunately he took it on his right arm and screamed in pain before falling out the center of the pitch. They lost one of their defenders but it was okay. Two Ravenclaws guys flew toward Ron who easily stopped the Quaffle and threw it directly to Zabini.
"Geez Ron, you know me, I won't cheat on her! She's the one who suggested it !"
"Weaslette was too close to you. Again."
my ex!"
"What the hell? Harry is
Neville and Hermione gave him an apology look but Ginny couldn't stop smirking. He rolled his eyes but Ron couldn't stop staring at him in disbelief.
"I guess. Everyone expected me to be like that but I didn’t want to fight anymore."
"You must say years now."
"Harry Potter is in love with a Death Eater."
Harry's wandless magic wasn't perfect. It took time and a lot of training because only good wizards or witches could perform wandless magic. Hermione could sometimes do some small spells but Ron never had such luck.
"This is the first match of the year. I want you to show the younger ones what a good match looks like. You're the more experienced here so I count on you."
Harry stopped listening to the others and tried to not turn mad. He had chosen this life to escape the Wizarding World, and now Darcy had thrown a bomb without a warning. Ron and Hermione would probably tell him to drop out of university, to not trust Malfoy or to come back with them to the Ministry. Maybe he shouldn't tell them until he was sure it was really Draco Darcy was talking about.
That's why Slytherins all sing,
"What is it? " She asked.
"None taken."
"I know that look mate, what are you thinking?"
Before the kiss could get hotter they pulled apart and decided to go to their common room.
"Don't mind them. They were childhood friends and surprised each other today when they discovered they're in the same classes."
"Yeah, Neville was pretty into it, like it was obvious that I like you."
"You're not gay?"
"Are you this oblivious?” Gabe sighed and sat down next to Harry. “How can you be first class at photography but be that blind about things happening to yourself?"
"No captain, it's about unity here, so you have to work well. But again, it's up to you. But I don't want to hear anything about problems in the teams, am I clear ?"
"Actually.." Draco's voice was hesitant but his face looked determined. "I have something to ask right now, if you don't mind."
"But it is obvious."
"And ? Harry said many others would have done the same, he's right. If I wasn't sure about Harry's competence I would.. I would think the same way as her. No offense Harry."
would dare to show up. This thought made Harry look back again to the group, he could tell they weren't pleased to be here. Only Pansy made a face to provoc anyone who tried to tell something. All the rest went silent, head downs or scared to say something.
"It was sarcasm, you dolt!"
"I don't." Her lips grow into a smile, something to mollify him. "But gradually easing into the things I would need to know can create a level of comfort. You don't have to answer anything you don't want to. Is it romantic?" Draco affirms. "Is she here? At Hogwarts?"
Harry, still helpless and baffled and not quite able to get over the shock of it, could only blurt out, "But you're not in love with me."
His chest felt tight. "I'm so sorry," Harry said, again, swallowing.
Draco smirked slightly, passed Harry the bottle. Harry drank from it. He liked the easy sharing, the almost-intimacy of it. "Alright. I'll allow you that one." He paused, drank from the bottle when Harry handed it to him. He could see Draco glancing over at him, quickly looking away. "I have heard all the stories. About you in school, I mean. The Basilisk, the graveyard and all that. You never talked much in detail about our, you know, Seventh year—"
Harry swallows. "He is mine to take care of," he says. "I'll take care of him. I swear."
"I do."
Harry looks over at Draco, takes in the light rise and fall of his chest, steadying down slow and soft. The silver eyes fixated up beyond the world, and the wind playing up his already wind-swept, snowy hair. His neck was flushed, running up to his jaw, to his cheeks, sweat glistening all over his skin in the moonlight. An edge of a smile played at his lips, contented and serene.
"Harry. Harry, it's okay," Draco whispered. His hands were on face, stroking his cheeks.
Luna's smile turns softer, glancing back down as she puts her fingers to it.
Potter pauses, swallowing. He turns his head on the pillow. "How do you let me get so close…?"
"We'll take care of each other," Draco said, taking his hand in his own.
Harry ignored the quip, not quite feeling as comfortable to banter with him as Malfoy seemed to. "Why haven't you been sleeping?"
The ease at which she accepts this leaves him still, uncertain of how to take it. He's been thinking a lot about his father these days. He's been thinking about all the things he wouldn't like about Draco, some of those that have always been a part of him; what he's always felt for Harry Potter, the fact that he likes boys, that he has begun to renounce his father's bigoted and extremist beliefs. That some part of Draco loathes him until it makes him sick, when he looks at Luna, and the other part of him, a seven year old boy in a dream who'd learned to fly from his father, still cannot let go of what he's lost. What he's never felt like he had.
In May, Ginny comes back.
Hermione looks at him ruefully, taking his hand and squeezing. "I'm sorry, Harry."
"So tell me your secret, whenever you're ready, and I'll tell you that it doesn't matter. Because I know you love me, and I'll always love you."
Harry wasn't allowed to tell him because to do so would base any further developments in their relationship on something artificial (the two of them would be /forced/ to get along under duress, which is hard to emotionally connect with, I imagine, so wouldn't work anyway)
"So what now?"
"I'm sorry about Crabbe," Harry said, after a while. Draco nodded. His face was carefully blank, and he seemed to be busy adjusting his grip on Teddy, settling him better on the broom by his underarms.
"Draco," Potter says, his voice soft, straightening. There's something different in the way he's looking at Draco, a little bloodshot-tired and overwhelmed, like he's been thinking too much. He looks awful.
"None of your concern," Draco whispers back, exaggerating Harry's tone of voice.
. Draco's brows raise up, bemused, wrinkling his nose. "You're on a first name basis with her?"
Exactly the sort of girl he's always imagined Potter would like.
It feels too great of a price, for having loved Harry once.
He doesn't know how long he sits there, numbed, and when his eyes grow blurry. His body is feeling his grief before he is, because his chest is just hollow.
— and she kept repeating it back to him all sympathetic and patient. Then, she asked for his hand in a very soft voice, and when he gave it to her only half-aware of anything, she touched it to Draco's sternum, said that spell again,
Then came the presents, most of them without name. He was to guess who brought what. Somebody had bought him a globe with a small him inside of it, which seemed a bit like a joke. This had to be George or Ginny. It turned out to be George, but it turned out that everytime he shook it, somebody else appeared alongside him, until the globe was all full of little Weasleys and Luna and Neville and Hermione. He smiled down at it, soft, putting it aside. He thought, privately, that there was somebody missing in it.
They write to each other almost daily. Harry works. Draco works and studies. And at the end of the night, Draco's barn owl comes to him with a new letter, along with some drawings.
It was way too much for Harry, overwhelming to have people spend so much for him. His nineteenth birthday was the first of these celebratory parties, since he was out of Hogwarts, no longer living with the Dursleys, and they had piled on the presents even more so when they didn't need to send everything by owl anymore. At twenty-one now, this was still the case.
Harry made his way to one of the cabinets to get the plates out anyway, telling him and Hermione about his visit to Malfoy from the start.
, Draco sends next, this time a monkey.
"Yeah."
"Harry, we should—" Draco said, words half-formed between kisses, amused.
Harry blinks, thinks he maybe should have expected this.
Hermione takes Ron's hand, looking at him pointedly.
It was this, the second part of what he said, where laid the true meaning. Everything that had gone wrong in the alteration had led to this, this much he knew, but Harry had not been able to pinpoint what exactly led to Draco's life teetering on this knife's edge, why it hadn't been enough for the two of them to be on decent terms.
" He trailed off there, and his jaw worked, eyes drifting away. "I'm sure we can use our... predicament… to our advantage, in this case."
"I'm not very susceptible to them," Draco says, taking his wrist to stop him. Harry's skin raises in goosebumps, perhaps due to the change in temperature. Except it seems laced with something else, something that flutters in his chest. "And I'm rather tolerant of the winter as well, you see. Also,
have to look at it every day, and it is painful to my eyes."
Harry goes on rambling, hardly looking at him. "I like you a lot. And honestly I... I guess I'm just sort of confused too, because the way you act with me, it doesn't feel like you like me at all but then with everything Scorpius tells me about what you say about me—"
He's staring at a spot on the floor, head swimming and hazy with drinks and dreams, firewhiskey in his system making everything dimmer, sharper, the yellow lights brighter, all at once. He inhales close-mouthed, heavy and slow, jaw set tight in a hardened knot of muscle.
Harry laughed, brows jumping. "You're joking."
"Do you know," Draco says, a while later. "That day I was going in for the obliviation, and I couldn't go through with forgetting you," Harry nods at it. "it wasn't you there that I thought of the most. I thought of you here."
"He has."
"You might undergo therapy, by high-tier Mind-Healers that have studied the effects of the potion and how to tackle such complications. This is considerably slow and taxing, I must admit, when compared to Permanent Partial Obliviation."
Harry tried to thrash him off, gritting out, "If there is one thing I can't fucking stand, it's bigotry—"
Draco blinked, raising his head up from its bow over his book. "What?"
some sort of Healer code?"
Harry has nothing, no way to reach that train. He didn't bring a broom. He can't Apparate in these warded areas. He can't breathe even as he's pulling desperately for it, his body gone numb, and he's just standing there, watching a train take away the boy he loves, disappearing completely to the eye.
" "Not really. Didn't insist, but he did seem like
He vividly notices Draco leaning his face towards his own, the sound of his laugh near Harry's jaw. Harry's head is lowered between his own shoulders, a broad grin pulling at his cheeks, and he can still feel the phantom of Draco's body against his side, from when they squeezed together under the cloak.
. He remembers a strong body against his cheek, arms around him. The sound of weeping against his shoulder.
Harry represses a smile back down at the pot, almost shyly. There's still a part of him that's trying to wrap his head around this — that Draco is here, and last night. "Hello."
(See the end of the chapter for
“How are things going with you and Draco?” Hermione asks, head against Harry’s shoulder. On her lap is Ron’s head, fully engrossed in the film they’re watching, the three of them under the drape of a large blanket.
in the silence behind every call for his name across rooms.
"For reasons I cannot mention, I'm not inclined to mention you at all to him. Don't take this wrongly, Harry. I do care for you, but he is my son first and foremost. And I'm afraid you will have to find him through other means."
Thank you so much to everybody for sharing their thoughts, for all the lovely comments in the last chapter 💙
, and
Ron and Hermione do their best to not let him feel that way, like they're trying hard to keep things as they used to be
Harry.
"That fucking feral dog of yours. Greyback?"
The mechanics of the bond were complicated, and Harry only got just the gist of the explanation, but was left with gaps in his understanding here and there. He only understood that before this, negative emotions were only partially affecting the bond. They weren't the true basis. Positive emotions were, but there wasn't a whole lot of that there,
"What's up with you and Malfoy?"
because I did not want this. And I won't accept something I never asked for."
he didn't put up much of a fight when I refused his proposal."
Potter returns some indiscernible amount of time later, the scent of food wafting in through air. Draco's stomach churns, hollow and completely disinterested.
"Um. Hi guys." He nodded at them in greeting.
But he doesn't finish that..
Draco snorts. "I can't believe it took you this long. I've been waving my hand in your face all day." Even so, there is a hushed tone to the way he's speaking, and Harry can feel his eyes on him, observing his reaction.
There are days, weeks, where Draco is guarded and low all over again, that might have to do with where he'd been in the war. Sometimes, he asks,
Not so anymore, at least. He isn't eleven, angrily weeping under the covers of his bed at night over a rejected handshake. He isn't twelve, watching Potter laugh with his friends across the Great Hall, trying to think him vexing and only ending up aching. He isn't thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, carrying a black cloud over his heart for ruining it all and just wanting to mean

Harry looked up at his face, the side of it.
"But, uh…" Malfoy seemed to be fumbling with words. The pause lasted a long moment, before he, rather ineloquently in a way that was uncharacteristic of him, settled on, "Cho Chang? Ginerva Weasley?"
Harry closed his eyes, breathed, slow, with all the roiling desperation of a man trying to breathe underwater. His hand was a tight fist over the counter. "I know you blame me and you're angry and it's difficult and I'm sorry, but will you please just let me
He was at a jewellery shop in muggle London, one that Hermione had suggested, delighted, when Harry had told her his plans. The lady on the other side of the counter was telling him about the one he was eying inside the glass—it was silver, with intricate carvings that met at moonstone jewel, pretty swirls of a border around it.
It's three weeks later that Molly visits him. She doesn't say much at the fireplace. He quickly scrambles up in his surprise, stood by the couch. She comes forward, with a wrinkled smile, hugging him wordlessly, and she eats lunch with him, and updates him about George's shop and Ginny applying for Quidditch teams and helping Ron and Hermione with their apartment and Arthur's job.
It meant nothing. Nothing beyond that they both had needs, and nobody else to fulfil them. A last resort and an only choice, just until this was all over and they could find other people.
Instead they had several more fights after, mostly regarding the alteration, one uglier than the other. One of them had Malfoy sardonically quipping how Harry must have really enjoyed nearly dying through school to have taken such a grand risk now. Another had ended in Harry shouting, "
Draco's shoulder tense up, a long silence stretching out between them. His gaze is cryptic and rooted passively to nothing. "What?"
Harry frowned. "Hey."
Draco was looking at him, a little sweeter and more tender with his hair all mussed up, sleep still a slight swell in his eyes.
Sleep comes to claim Draco in its tide, a quiet, distant memory playing its song well into his dreams, a hand sliding over his own in a bright daylight, a hand warm on the middle of his back, the two of them leading his feet into the spin of a dance.
Harry huffs, derisive. He didn't come back from the dead and fight Voldemort only to live his life according to the way strangers felt he should. "Then they can take that up with me."
"Well, for the record, I know your work is really fascinating," Harry says, almost blurting it out. "I know the stuff you've done, like... the contributions you made to making lycanthropic transitions painless and all these other — what you do makes the world a better place and that matters a lot, and I think..." He fades off there again, and he puffs out a hard, frustrated breath, and of all things, Harry’s next words are the last thing Draco would have expected him to say. "Look, I like you."
be with someone that we actually love! Do you want that, Malfoy? Because I don't."
In May, Harry goes to Cardiff to be there for Draco's graduation ceremony. It's there that he meets Pansy and Blaise. Through their house are framed, still pictures of the three of them, some old ones that Draco said his mother had owled over from the Manor, and some where they looked just the same as they do now, that can't have been older than a year or two. They seem to have travelled around to places, arms wrapped around each other for pictures. The camera is turned back on them, beach winds in their hair, grinning up at Harry. Places they went to in their summers, Draco tells him. It was good for him, to see the world a little more with his friends.
She had proposed a toast at the dinner table, looking quite lovely.
After the war, Harry had been offered a job as an Auror, but he'd stayed behind to spend his final year with his friends. He had wanted to be a teenager, or something like it, just for a while longer. But by graduation, all the doubts had creeped in, in particular as he went through his Mind-Healing sessions throughout Eighth Year.
But he was quiet there too, in that same strange mood he was often in these days.
Harry didn't say anything.
"I must say, Mr. Malfoy," Naborowski was saying at one point. "I would never have, in a million years, expected for the two of you to make this work."
His mind was loud and full, lost in the turmoil and chaos. He did not hear the footsteps at first, and then he did, right as they seemed to enter the room. When he looked up, Draco was moving towards him, his eyes bright and full of a desperate emotion, and then he was there with his arms around Harry's neck and head, both of them stumbling back a bit as Harry caught him by the waist, startled. Draco's forehead was against his, his breaths warm on his mouth, only sharing his air like a kiss that he couldn't go through with yet.
A week of doing this, the discontentment fed into itself until it became a sort of hunger, like being starved to somewhere beyond reach or comprehension.
"I should go," Harry said, as he slowly hoisted himself up into a sitting position. Even as he said it, though, he found his body feeling rooted to the grassy ground, leaning back on his palms.
They were quiet all the way until he took his coffee, grabbed one of his textbooks from the table and left.
Nowadays, Draco would either be drifting in or out or awake and silent. Much of the time now, he was irritated and withdrawn, but there were times—when he was feeling somewhat better—that he would talk to Harry, trying to come out of his body and his mind, trying to grab onto something outside of it.
. A teal-coloured sleeping potion. Theirs was a bit more green, but well, Professor Slughorn deemed it passable.
"Pardon me, little boy, what did you just say?"
He looked like one too, standing there like that; in his long black coat, the enamored tilt of his head. The grace of his shoulders, with his gloved hands in his coat pockets, and his face soothed with an almost-peace.
Luna hums. She is brushing her hands over the top of the nettles of grass. "There were times when he couldn't bring himself to use the Cruciatus Curse on me, no matter how much Bellatrix screamed at him." It still astounds him at times, how straightforward she can be, how she had a way with talking about such things so calmly. "I couldn't understand why for a long time until he told me that I reminded him of you. He'd then weeped and apologized to me."
Harry learned that, from the lack of what Draco said of his father, there wasn't much he wanted to talk about regarding him, except that he was away a lot of the time. That his mother taught him ballroom dancing. That he'd been playing violins for her since he could remember. That he started learning to cook when he was nine—his father actively discouraged this. His mother wasn't entirely happy about it, but she'd caved to his tantrums to be allowed for it, when his father wasn't there to stop him. He would then proceed to create the most disgusting combinations of food that he himself never dared eat. He would force all his friends to instead and demand praise.
. "Maybe a last resort, you know."
But Harry wanted to know everything now, if the procedure worked, if everything went okay and the lifespan of the bonding curse was cut down. Harry
"We don't
would be, thereby opening himself up for insult. But the bell rang right after, signalling the start of classes, so they'd made a quick break-off for their respective classrooms.
GallaPlacidia: for your amazingly quick betateading, for refining/cleaning up this story, for all your advice/suggestions and for helping me fill in some missing gaps. It was so great to have you on this, and just very very lovely in general getting to talk to you
Draco stares at her. "I don't know," he croaks. "I don't know how to..." Even now, after having talked about it to Aileen, and Luna, and—he doesn't know how to speak of it to somebody new. Somebody so outside of it. There is a part of him that doesn't want to ruin this space of normalcy, that there is somebody who knows him and does not know that. But there is another part of him that is too tired of keeping it away.
"I was!" Harry said, quickly, wide-eyed. "I am! I just
At the fireplace, as the two of them were leaving, Narcissa said to Harry, "Will you take care of him? Will you make sure that he..."
"I just—don't remember. And I think I must have always teetered somewhere on the edge of it, in some way, and I never noticed when. As if I'd just woken right in the middle of having fallen for you."
"He didn't look like..." Harry said, after a while. "He didn't look like he knew what had happened either."
* * *
Harry paused. Malfoy didn't want to answer his question. That was another red flag.
"Tell me why you're upset."
"Because it was given to me," Draco tells her. He lets that sink in for a moment, seeing her expression of moderate, controlled bewilderment. "What do you know of it?"
Draco had excused himself somewhere through the chaos and noise. Andromeda had been the only one to notice, having nodded to him, frowning slightly. He seemed to be in some haste, had the back of his hand under his nose. Harry noticed this vaguely, but by the next second, he was distracted by Ron calling for him, laughing, asking him if he remembered that one time at the beach, when Hermione had lost her footing in a particularly aggressive wave of the sea and dragged Ron and Harry both down by the back of their shirts along with her.
"Won't you kiss me?"
"May I hold you?" Luna asks him, and Draco just hardly manages to nod through it all.
Harry tugs at his tie, keeps trying to adjust it into trying to make it look more presentable in front of the mirror. Draco's leaning on the doorway, waiting.
"Why didn't you forget me?" Harry asks, finally.
In certain moments of clarity, Draco thinks, often, that he should leave. That he should withdraw. That he should remember that nothing good will come out of this pitiful venture when it ends. But he always ends up letting Potter come back another day, always ends up staying just a little while longer to watch a bright and beautiful dream play out in Potter's eyes and smile, because it's the most awake that he's felt since he's woken up.
But there had still been a time, through their younger years, when he'd felt as if he had spent so long watching from the outside that maybe he got stuck there somehow. Even when he
"Draco, come on," Harry said, grabbing his wrist and trying to walk him along.
"Then I forgive you."
On the canvas, colours were stroked next to colours, blending into an oily picture of melded shades, stilled.
" His voice was beginning to rise as well. a near-shout, a raw and rough edge to it. "we can't have a full day to ourselves without having to
In January, Harry met a man named Elias.
La Vie En Rose by Edith Piaf
Grief had been something so big that Harry didn't know how to feel it for months after it happened, and now it comes out in ebbs; at the sight of their old pictures, at the sight of Teddy doing something wonderful or funny or endearing, or him reaching a milestone, and the sight of the empty spaces in George's room and the unoccupied chair at the kitchen table, the whereabout clock where Harry came back one day and found his own face had taken its place. Not to replace, of course. Never to replace. But only to put it there.
"Your turn?" Harry asked.
"Still angry at me?" Harry asked, quietly.
When they do speak, it's at the same time, "I thought—" "You look—" And then they're both caught in a, "you go first," "what were you saying—"
Some people would not be happy to see Harry happy with Draco Malfoy, but there was a chance that others would be influenced by the sight of them happy together. For others, there would still be doubts. For some, should any hatred befall Draco further after this, it would likely be for a far different reason that would have nothing at all to do with Narcissa, or essentially, the Malfoys in general; jealousy. Either way, it might stave off at least some of the negativity surrounding them to have Harry publicly endorsing them.
"What're you humming?" Harry murmured into his cheek, wrapped around him.
"Hi," Harry said, hushed, touching his chin, couldn't seem to keep his hands off of him. He let it fall between them on the bed.
Sometimes he's still not sure if he didn't only dream or imagine it. It's been weeks and he hasn't been able to fully acknowledge what had happened, what he'd learned, beyond a vague, distant thought that doesn't sink into his brain, a memory, quickly blinked away. Yet it came back over and over like the sea, his heart left pounding wild and erratic in his throat, his lips thrumming with a phantom kiss. It keeps him awake half of the nights and he can't quite explain why.
But that was the fact of time. It did not slow or wait for anybody, and whatever it was heading towards, it would get there, and it would get past it, and nobody could have any say in that.
The way he speaks with an alive sort of interest and mild awe… it sweetens him, and Harry finds himself wanting to see him so much that his heart hurts. But he doesn't ask to or get out of bed and go knocking at his door. He stays in bed and teeters on the edge of slumber, listening to his voice. He has a nice voice, Harry vaguely thinks.
Dinner was ready by the next hour and had everybody gathered at the table, Harry having ended up next to Draco, and Andromeda on the other side of him, and Luna on the other side of her.
Harry had decided to take up volunteering work instead of going back to his shop. He had no real plans, and that was alright with him. He would go wherever he was taken, and figure out where he fit most. Where he wanted to be. Because his life did not have to be condensed into a single, grand plan or meaning and passion. It could just be full of small plans and meanings and passions until he wanted to move on to something else. Draco said he was lucky to be able to afford this luxury and freedom, and he could use it if he liked, and he could do good in the world with what he had alongside it. Harry had already given away a good amount of his wealth to organisations that would better the world, but he did still have enough to last him a long while.
Draco had been anxious about what would happen to his core. Though he was well-aware it was regenerative, he worried that there had been too much damage. So they went to have Draco medically examined by Healer Francine, who prescribed ' a lot of bedrest' and some potions that would help him heal faster, though it was to be used when the magical sensitivity dwindled some in several weeks. She reassured him that he would fully recover in every way. It might take months for his core to fully recreate itself, and for his magic to return, but it would happen.
They fall into silence.
On the days he
Harry looked down. He touched a finger to his mug to check its temperature. It wasn't too hot. He took a sip.
"Teddy!" Harry calls out. "Ginny, have you seen Teddy?"
There had always been a missing page to this entire story, one Harry had unknowingly, continually forced himself not to fill in the gaps of, because the curse had muddled so much between them that there was no way of saying what was necessity, and what wasn't. Because he was scared of laying another burden on Draco after all the things that had happened to him because of Harry. Because he was scared of making things uncomfortable between them when they needed the ease and comfort of being close together, now more than ever.
"Do you even understand what you just did?" Malfoy hissed, fists clenched. "I can't go outside anymore. They'll want to kill me! My
“Harry, Harry, Harry,” Draco intoned with every thrust.
Because I still do.
Harry stiffened on reflex at Draco’s reiteration of his interview. From the looks of it, his words really had left a deep gash in Draco’s sanity. He then took Draco’s right hand, the one which was not holding a cigarette, in his’ and brought it to his lips.
“Don’t be. Our aim is not to make you feel sorry about yourself or the things you do. It is to channel your feelings in the right direction so that no action of yours will compel you to feel apologetic anymore. Do you understand?”
Thank you everyone for giving me Kudos and for your kind comments and support.
"Can't a bloke get some privacy without ginger-heads like you poking in?" Draco asked, not feeling the rush anymore though he relaxed considerably. He blamed it on Ron's huge unwanted presence.
Draco took a swig of his now lukewarm coke which tasted fairly like piss, maybe worse than piss. “Draco now, is it? I thought we were back to last names. Besides, I could ask you the same,” he couldn’t look at the patronizing glare directed at him anymore. So he found the blank unlit screen of the TV rather interesting at the moment.
"Ron's right, Harry. It'll only get worse if he's read your interview in The Prophet," Hermione interjected the silence filled by Ron.
"You need some sleep. Your broken bones will mend overnight and it’ll be quite painful," she said as she stood up with great difficulty and for the first time in months, Draco REALLY looked at her full figure. Her stomach was so big that Draco was afraid it would burst open any moment.
“No!” Harry screamed as if he were in pain. When a grunt reached his ears, he opened his eyes to see that Draco was trying to let himself loose from Harry’s unforgiving grip on his left arm, where all the burn marks resided in their darkest and unwanted glory. “I’m sorry, so sorry,” Harry let his arm go and watched Draco blow on it a couple of times. The burns were extremely fresh, Harry realized.
The Healer's fault, yes. His baby wasn't dead!
"And I'm a Potter now," Draco said in a deriding tone.
"We'll let you have some privacy, yeah?" Hermione pushed Harry towards Draco's room.
The Wizarding World was not happy with their union. It wasn't surprising to either of them but they didn't care. Draco wanted freedom and Harry wanted Draco's freedom - that was all that mattered to them. Their marriage ceremony was simple. Extremely simple to Draco's utter dislike but he did not comment as it was not his place to do so anymore. Harry Potter pulled the strings. And he had a lifetime of training under Voldemort’s rule to know when to back down and take a hit with a straight face. Yet when the moment came, Draco couldn't suppress the sudden onslaught of anger towards his fiancée for one particular reason.
Harry’s voice in his head was overbearing. He just wanted it gone. Unknowingly, he clapped his hands over his ears in an effort to keep Harry’s voice away from him but it was futile, he realized, as the voice was inside his head, consuming him in entirety.
“Have you ever considered seeing a Mind Healer, Potter?” Draco questioned, stubbornly refusing to accept Harry’s flowers.
“No, Draco. Even the muggle kids drink it, you know? It does not have alcohol,” Harry clarified but Draco had been inexorable. He believed that the manufacturers only fooled their consumers by leading them to think that Coke was a non-alcoholic drink.
Irisk - You're not the only one. Even I wanted a Dark!Harry fanfic with a happy ending no matter how absurd it would be. Still, I would love me some happy ending.
Anger. That was all Harry had in him which rendered him thoughtless, basically, emotionless. Draco didn’t know what happened to the great Harry Potter after the war but something must’ve broken in him, just like Draco himself, whose broken pieces still lay scattered all over the Wizarding World. The pieces that stayed with him, despite everything, only brought his darkest nightmares to life when he slept. The pieces he held now made him nothing but a foolish coward seeking out love and friendship in places where there was nothing or no one but another coward, Harry-sodding-Potter, trying to hold on to his broken pieces without letting them go.
, and wake up on May 30
Outcast at home, outcast at school. There's never been a break for him. Not for the Freak of the Dursley house, until unexpected people brings pasts to light and suddenly. It seems that he finds the chance he'd been waiting his l I f e for.
All those lonely nights, bleeding, starving and locked in a cabinet because they were ‘his only living relatives’. All the scars on his face, on his back, the hatred that they had instilled in him so much so that he hated how he looked without morphing in the mirror. Running for his life when he was nine and losing the careless childhood he could have had.
Potter’s expression was openly brash and loud, large grin as he talked with a ginger beside him, Ronald Weasley if Draco remembered correctly. People were watching and whispering along the sides of the two and Potter seemed unbothered by the attention. Even flourishing under it. He looked slightly shorter than Harry, more stout with his chest puffed out. His hair was a shaggy and wild mess on his head with dark brown eyes that looked shone a slight gold in the torchlight. He was so Gryffindor Draco could feel a head ache forming from here.
“Don’t worry about it Hadrian, not like these guys are big talkers either and at least you got the intelligence and competence to pull it off. I’m more surprised no one’s ears are bleeding from that harpy. She could have at least knocked. It’s only polite.” Draco checked the scenery and looked into the hallway.
It felt like an eternity, but it was really only a few minutes when Draco saw his love turn from the stove. Six mismatched mugs balanced on a tray with a small jug of milk and mason jar of sugar. Draco didn’t even blink when Hadrian plopped his favorite mug onto his placemat, tea already a dark milky color, evidently, Hadrian had made his tea for him. He took a sip and was a little surprised.
New chapter!
His beautiful flower always did.
“The women called that Death Eater scum lawyer; he’ll be representing them against us in Harry’s custody case this winter. I doubt he’ll see sense like any light lawyer and settle this out of court. It’s going to be a public spectacle and we’ll be dragged through the Wizengamot. Rita is going to be a nightmare if she gets wind of this. We’ll have to be careful with Alex’s PR.”
The ginger snorted, “Watch this, Suni. Kiss your daddy!” Immediately like a reptile on a mission Suni launched at Hadrian and coiled around his shoulders before pressing her snoot against his cheek. Hadrian just looked ahead with a fondly exasperated look, not running away from the snake kisses at all.
“Mine! Off!”
Those eyes were the same color of Annabee’s.
Spoiler alert. They weren’t.
“I gotta use the restroom first.” Mama looked around the hall, it was beginning to wind down, and everything looked safe enough.
Hadrian was riding high all the way to court day.
“No incest.”
Ah, Hadrian didn’t notice the mini circle that had formed around Alex and them. That was nerve wracking. Still, he pushed it away in his mind to focus as name after name was called until Crabbe was the first one up, heading to Slytherin and quickly followed by Laney who was happily Slytherin with Draco and Goyle. The red head threw her legs over the bench next to her with a cheeky grin. Ever confident he’d follow her.
Finally, the feeling ebbed and faded away, leaving Hadrian a little shaky but otherwise fine. Hadrian opened his eyes to look up at his Dad who froze, he stayed still to let the older man trace the skin just beside his eyes.
“Yes, after my twelfth birthday. Amazing we’re seventeen now love. So, over five years?” Draco smiled indulgently.
All when he had parents, biological, living parents. Who, by the way Severus was clinging to him, would have loved and cherished him deeply his whole life. All those children he was jealous of growing up, the ones with doting parents. Who grew up, even if they were poor and just as raggedy as Harry had been in his hand me downs, loved. He could have been loved. The man’s long and thin hands curled into Hadrian’s scalp, renewing the tears that burned on his cheeks. Hadrian barely heard it when the doors to the private office at Gringotts’s burst open.
“I want to go home.” Lily flinched at the cold and quiet words. James glowering at him from behind his wife and Alex looked crestfallen and upset. Looking up at his father for comfort and guidance when Hadrian glared at him more harshly. Rebuffing any attempt Alex would have made to get closer to him. Evidently, Alex remembered getting his ass handed to him and kept quiet when Hadrian drew his wand.
“Lo there I call to you, lo there I call to you, lo there you call to me. Lady Magic hear my plea! Cast me off from this tainted blood, for I feel no love in this home, no taste from its food, no warmth from its shelter and no kinship to its inhabitants. I am estranged within this blood and offer up my own to rid myself of that which binds me. Lady Magic I renounce the Potter Family for its negligence, for its abuse, and for the terror it inspires and the crimes against your gifts. With your blessing free me. So mote it be.” The circle glowed beneath him and he could feel hands. Curling around his core deep in his chest. The feeling was both heavenly and hellish, feeling eyes studying him like a bug under a microscope. It burned him from the inside out. Until it stopped and there was a tug and suddenly Hadrian felt a rush of relief.
“Don’t worry about it Lane. They’ll drop off all our luggage, pets included at our dorms once we’re sorted. Unless you have an owl, then they go to the Hogwart’s owlery.” Laney nodded happily, ignoring Draco’s small squawk as she grabbed his hand to hold as they walked. Harry sniggering near silently at the confused expression on Draco’s face.
“So, as I understand it, you’re Harry’s adoptive sister, yes?” The headmaster gave another grandfatherly smile as Laney scowled and Snape glided behind them.
“That’s an understatement. We started with wanting a heritage test for me to see my bloodline and we ended up uncovering that I’m both the Boy-Who-Lived, stupid name, was mind raped and manipulated by an old creep, and taken from two loving fathers who were alive and grieving unaware while I was being beaten and starved. It’s… been a day.” Hadrian hadn’t meant to sound so bitter, but the soft smile Draco gave him soothed any worry he had. Letting his lover give him a chaste and soft kiss. Rubbing his shoulders over the loose tank top that Hadrian slept in.
“You’re gifted in making explosions.” The near maniacal grin that split the girls face made it difficult to keep a blank and straight composure. Hadrian seemed to have drifted back to reality as well, giving a barely there smirk.
Those times were gone now.
-Gives James time to ruin my family before he’s caught
“Oh I know, this one time Laney-“ And the two were bending their heads together and grinning amusedly as they traded story after story. Erin calmly drinking coffee beside her wife and occasionally making quiet conversation with Severus across from her about various odds and ends.
“We have house elves do the chores really. Alex and his father fly in the backyard however, Alex is quite excited to join the Quidditch team for Gryffindor like his father.”
“Now you know how I feel when you whisper in French to me bastard.” Draco laughed before giving a soft sigh.
With how their evening went, it was a surprise when an irate Potions Master stopped them before breakfast the next day. A sneer firmly in place on his lips as he handed them a note with a candy name on it. Laney looked at it confusedly while Hadrian raised an eyebrow at him.
“Our room at home is half this size. Also, I’m pretty sure that is a bloody hot tub.”
“Me, so it was August first.”
The young boy didn’t look much like Snape would have expected at all if he were honest. Alex was the James’ clone he’d hated to see, but his supposed Squib twin looked similar but not the same. He looked more like Lily’s father, with those haunting green eyes. Hair neater than any Potter he’d ever seen. Female Dragma’s hair was wilder than his, bright red hair that looked like a more groomed rat’s nest. A handful, and he just seemed quiet.
“Good morning! Severus, right? Coffee?” He nodded, and soon a cup was pressed gently into his hands. He gave a grateful nod as the young man sauntered over to the table and plopped down, leaning back and looking through the window with an effortless grace and power. He could see why even before Draco’s creature inheritance kicked in that he was so taken with the boy. Strong, while still being lithe and elegant.
Child abuse, kidnapping, abandonment, neglect. Hadrian had a lot of firepower here.
“It’s a little small, but it will work.” Laney snorted.
“So?” Severus cleared his throat.
“Homework?”
. His brother was sitting there looking nervous but still animatedly speaking to anyone who would listen. Lily was beautiful as ever, dark and rich red hair flowing smoothly as she quietly chatted with the headmaster, one hand absently stroking her son’s hair.
With a cruel snarl, James threw a cutting hex from the safety of the wards. Hadrian gritted his teeth and held back a scream. Why did that man fucking love destroying his leg so much. Luckily, Hadrian had practice ignoring pain. So he kept running.
“Sara allowed me to claim Hadrian as my godson the other day before I contacted you, I would be more than happy to gift their two daughters the same protection and put them under my care.” Sara gave him a face splitting grin and Erin eyed him up and down before settling down easily. It seemed like approval to him.
Harry was his brother. Yet he was looking at him like dirt in favor of this imposter.
“Six feet under, so I wouldn’t know actually.” Narcissa coughed and Draco groaned when Hadrian just giggled.
was the one who liked treacle tart and she was the one obsessed with books on charms.
Was gonna wait to post! But I got too excited. I'm going to try and wait a few days between updates, but what harm can one early update really do?
There was a certain humiliation in being trained in defense from the age of six and getting curb stomped by your ‘squib’ brother who decided silent casting the entire time sounded like a great time.
, god the words were so surreal and so, so lovely. His little prince. Looking at the paper with inquisitive eyes, it was a full inheritance, heritage, and medical parchment. Rather thick too. Lucius never liked to do anything by halves. He’d probably wanted to see Hadrian’s heritage and genetics that could be passed on. Money wasn’t important to the Malfoys, but heritage and genetics were to a point. If there was a dangerous mix then blood adoption would be encouraged rather than conception through potioned means. He was getting off track.
The castle loomed in the night sky like a fairy tale. Grand and so beautiful it was like a light house, beckoning them home. Hadrian’s lips pulled into a smile that his sister quickly mirrored, giddiness welling up in his chest.
Which, if he had a choice he’d follow her to the day he died, so wig.
“Ah, none of this ma’am business. If you must call me something, you can call me Cissa for right now. Maybe something more familiar later though, hmm dear?” Draco blushed bright red at the implication, but didn’t fight it. In fact, his hand seemed to hover over the pocket furthest away from Hadrian where Severus could see a small bulge. His eyebrow raised again, he knew Draco had mentioned the heritage test, was he so confident he’d bought the ring before introducing his parent’s even?
It was kidnapping at least, line theft at worst.
“Am I not?” The silence was telling enough. Hadrian smiled apologetically. “He has a point though. I’m sorry. I think it’s a good ice breaker before anyone steps on it thinking it’s an issue. They died when I was a baby, lived with my muggle aunt and uncle until I was… nine? My mentor took me in when… circumstances made living with my relatives difficult. She gave me this house and let me work at her restaurant to maintain a life. I still work there and go to the homeland with her occasionally.”
First, he’d sleep a bit more. Things would be clearer in the morning.
“You took my brother!”
When Hadrian explained what his goal was Laney was immediately on his side. A mad grin on her lips. Draco was resolute as well, Greg and Vince were basically Laney’s whipping boys rather than Draco’s vassals anymore so they were obviously not going to object. He’d let Lucius destroy the Potter’s legally.
The relief was like getting dumped with a bucket of ice water in the summer heat as Hadrian jotted down the answers swiftly and passed it to Laney who squinted and bit her lip.
“Sirius, how could you?”
Blood.
-Bragging rights
Hey guys! I said I wanted your opinion and here I'm asking for it!
He tried to use that time to nap a bit as he’d stay in his room, James too busy with Alex to remember that Hadrian wasn’t there to eat dinner or lunch. Lily often drifted towards his room, holding one of her books and asking if he’d like to read with her.
“Oh Harry, Slytherin? That’s a surprise, Alex had mentioned he was a bit upset that you weren’t his house mate too. Most of us Potters end up in Gryffindor. But how do you like it?” His chest clutched tighter, but he forced himself to choke out at least a few words. He couldn’t look weak and he couldn’t let them disrespect his house like that.
So, this is the part where I tell you last night I basically got possessed and wrote the entirety of the fic. There is four chapters left and I'm debating to publish chapters and wait for a moment between each or if I'm just going to hail mary it and post them at one a day and wrap this up swiftly.
Potter Manor stood proudly just as it always had when Sirius was younger. The wards curling and embracing him like an old friend, even where they were scorched at the edges. His godson’s brilliant work. The sky was dark, but when Sirius closed his eyes for a moment, he could still hear Charles’ laughter as he sat on the porch. Dorea yelling at them to come inside for dinner. James and him flying on their brooms and giggling madly as only misbehaving children could.
“Kindergarten? I’m so proud of you, did you have fun my darling, darling?” His voice bounded and bounced with a doting tone. The red haired girl smiled dreamily as the little girl cheered, still holding onto her son’s arm as the three migrated out of the office. Alex following as soon as Lily nodded her ascent.
Even Lucius seemed shocked, before a gleam of delight filled his eyes. The final nail in the coffin.
“They’ll never figure out her hissing is whining to be pet.”
Instantly the waterworks started again full force. “T-they want to ta-take my son. My son! They want to take him away! I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…” Severus was prepared for it when the woman collapsed. Grabbing her and holding her up as she sobbed incoherently, rage began licking at his heels like a loyal lap dog.
“The same reason Fawkes hasn’t saved you. You both aren’t worth it. And because I need to protect my godson from the rot you seem insistent to spread. The press will kill him if James started spouting that shit. I’ll let the world burn before anyone touches Hadrian. Which is why you’re not going to remember any of this.”
Two classes and an evening of tutoring later, and Laney still sucked at potions, but not quite as bad. Professor Snape had spent the time stopping her from killing the three of them while teaching Hadrian the flower language that apparently Lily had taught him so long ago. It was… odd, to think of the woman who abandoned him being an innocent child once. Not unpleasant however, Lily made horrible decisions, but she didn’t cause the pain that her husband had to him.
After, the silence comes over them, sitting across each other on booths. The large panelled window of the coffee shop brings daylight in on them. The server comes with their orders and leaves.
"What?" Draco asks, without looking up at Harry.
Malfoy huffed, somewhat nervously. "Potter, I think you believe you want that about as much as I do."
Settled in bed, Harry's arms curl around Teddy, cradling the baby close and protective into the side of his ribs. Teddy lifts his stuffed hippogriff above his head, showing it to Harry, telling him a whole story that only he understands.
Still, Harry crawled out of bed, pulling at his hand as he did. Though bemused and uncomprehending at what he must have in mind, Draco climbed out of bed on his knees, following along to his hands.
Draco comes to sit beside him against the wall, pulling his knees up, pressing his shoulder against Potter's. After a few seconds, he asks, "Something happened?"
He was just on the verge of leaving, when he heard a voice behind him in the midst of low chatter, saying, "Harry?"
"You just got it even more now." Harry gestured a bit at his own jaw. "There's some here. And on your left cheek."
"That's not for you to worry about," Malfoy said calmly, reading through his own menu. Harry snorted, somewhat hysterically. No, of course. Malfoy was just about to do something morally wrong and about to drag Harry down that pit too. Why should that concern Harry? He didn't care much for rules, he never had, but he did care a lot about being conscientous.
"I…" Harry clears his throat, not sure what to say that won't provoke a rebuke. His face feels hot from mortification.
one of Ron and Hermione's hands around each of his own
Draco shakes his head. "No." He is watching the pavement, hands resting into the pockets of his coat. Harry remembers, vaguely, Narcissa's letter, telling him of the sickening air of dark magic left behind. The way it suffocates her, haunted Draco. "I owled her yesterday to tell her I won't be. She responded this morning. Told me it was alright, as long as I was well."
It's some red-headed boy with a yellow tie. Zacharias Smith, he recognizes after a rather long moment of looking at him, trying to place him. He hasn't been all too central to either of his lives.
They sat quietly with him and watched the rest of the party. Draco must be with Andromeda and Molly in the kitchen. Even at Andromeda's, he often helped her clean up after dinner alongside Harry. He thought about joining them, because it felt strange, that Draco was sick and cleaning up kitchens, that Harry wasn't doing anything at all. But he doubted Draco could stand to be in the same room as him anymore.
Some old French song was playing from his vinyl record. Malfoy hadn't noticed Harry immediately. When he did, he straightened slightly, his brows twitching upward in an unfathomable expression, but then he'd taken one look at Harry and paused, abrupt and wide-eyed, before his face closed off.
you've moved your stuff here then?" Harry asked, a shoulder against the doorway, arms crossed.
Draco was silent, and then he hummed, even softer. His breathing fell deep, slowing a moment after, having fallen asleep. Harry pressed his mouth to the space between his shoulder blades, not quite a kiss, but wanting it to be.
"Potter?" There was a rustle from behind him, and then a face below him. There were hands on his shoulders, his biceps. His first thought was to push them away, only the waves of calm moved down his body, and he stilled. It felt good, soothing, his mind going a little quieter, the horrid images softening, blurring away. He was still struggling for air, his body not quite caught up. "It's alright."
"A good marriage,"  Xavier repeated, after a long second, seeming mildly inconvenienced by being cut off in such a way. "That is what the curse wants, after all."
He won't be a choice Potter will make and regret, and he won't wait for Potter to make his choice and realise that Draco is hardly a choice at all. If it means that he will burn one way or the other, then he will not stay to become ashes and watch the fire die out.
"Do you want to come inside?" Elias murmured, breaths warm against his lips. His hands were on Harry's hips, stroking a thumb at the jut of his hipbone. "Have a drink with me?"
There is a lurch in Draco's chest, and he's tearing himself away from Potter, staring at him and feeling strangely betrayed and hurt by the words. "Don't say that to me."
For a moment there's silence. A small snort. "What's this I see? A sad Potter?"
"Kindly fuck off." Harry rolls his eyes. Draco grins at him, a canine crooked at one corner of his mouth. "Obviously you better be a lot more tactful with my mother. Perhaps begin with a
More than anything, he gets angry at himself. More than anything, he contemplates the ten other things he could have done in that moment — kept himself in check, not said those things, acted like he was fine, like he wasn't terrified and overwhelmed by it himself. Maybe he should have acted like he didn't know anything at all. Done anything that would have made Draco stay.
Harry laughed.
not fancy a repeat of stumbling across half the floor to your room whilst feeling like I'm about to die the next time I awaken, as I'm sure you do not either? Hm?" Harry could not see his face, but he could hear the thin and satirical smile in his voice, before he turned over onto his other side, his back to him.
Draco hums and shrugs, turning back to his book.
know about my—"
"What did you want to talk about?"
A drip of potion was dropped at his lips, the same done to Malfoy beside him, though Harry didn't see it. He only saw the hazy pale blue of the mediwitch's robes, when she crowded in between them.
Harry could do nothing but stare as Malfoy's head moved back to look at him, still in that painfully tender way, temple against his. His thumbs stroked over his very warm and flushed cheeks, and then ran down his chin once, index finger underneath in a light grip.
, is what he thinks first, and wants to laugh in a bout of hysteria, because then he thinks of how serious Draco used to be when it came to both their grades.
"I want to have us looked over by a healer," Malfoy said one day, having come to Harry while he was reading in bed.
"Yeah.
Elias was still hovering over his lips. "I don't… really know what I thought." He smiled, bit it back, huffed again. Harry followed the movement of his mouth, fixated. "Part of me didn't really want to know."
"Did you see—his face?" Malfoy managed to get out between his snorts and puffs, and Harry vividly noticed him leaning his grinning face towards his own, which was bowed between his trembling shoulders, as if he was closely observing his reaction.
"For Salazar's
Moonstone eyes slowly opened, blinking groggily. They met his own after a moment of regaining focus and orientation, blinking again to clear the blur. Harry smiled at him.
Harry, perhaps, did not do well enough to show Malfoy he was just as affected. He noticed it these days
"I don't think I know how to… how to wrap my head around this," Potter says.
"It's the 21st century, for Merlin's sake," Harry muttered to that.
What he'd expected was for Malfoy to drag another chair over, sit alongside him and do this from sideways.
Draco's brows are furrowed, his eyes groggy and gritty. "How long..."
just wanting to—wait. What. "Wait. So you… you do just… want to hang out?"

"Um. Look, we'll talk later, okay? We're just, uh… we're kinda in the middle of...something."
). He'd drop reminders on winter mornings to not forget his cloak and hat and scarf in his hurry,
"Sorry," Draco said, hoarse. "I thought I could just—"
"That's… really fucked up," Harry pointed out. Again.

But Draco's head turns away, just slightly, and his breath releases in an exhale, as if freed as soon as he wasn't looking into Harry's face.  "You don't even like boys."
Ginny quirks a small smile. She kisses his cheek. "Yeah. Might help you sleep a bit better. Goodnight, Harry."
Harry tore the page off the book, kept it hidden in his locked drawer.
One more chapter to go!
He was numb and off-kilter all through the dinner,  slipped in and out of the conversations at the table and hardly spoke, as if his mind had detached and he had retreated somewhere deeper within it and now he was watching himself in the middle of everything else. He was numb and off-kilter through finding himself standing at the door, shaking Emelie's little hand, and Olivia's, and Dudley's, who was asking him if he needed a drive, and Harry was telling him he didn't need a drive, and Dudley was asking him if he was sure, and Harry was sure, yes. Dudley was handing him his number,
Draco had been working on this for almost two years now. He'd told Harry everything about it, all the mechanics, as much as Harry could understand of the way he made it, how it would let him feel intensely his own magical core and the curse operating on it. How it would tell him what had happened to him. He'd told Harry of why he was certain that the alteration had only gone wrong for him, not Harry — the simple fact that Harry did not at all seem affected similarly by the curse in the months before they got together, when Harry had been unspeakably desperate and aching for him just as much, the curse like a clouded wall between them. Draco was… he was absolutely fucking brilliant.
"Thought I saw you at the train station," Potter says, pushing his hands into his trouser pockets. "Thought I imagined it. You said you wouldn't come back."
"I brought something for you," Harry said, then, smiling, looking down at him.
"Where else?"
"I know of the way you look at me sometimes. The page you keep hidden in your locked drawer. And now, all these nightmares you're having."
It's another half a year later that Harry receives the letter.
was the odd memory that ran through Harry's mind.
"No more than typical," Harry said.
It had been terrifying and horrific, when the realization struck him. It had been terrifying to realize that Draco was minutes away from walking into the lake and—and
"Okay. But I still think this is a terrible idea."
There's a First Year sitting beside Draco, quiet and boring holes into the table as she fidgets restlessly with the tablecloth. Draco looks at the brunette little girl, seeming to finally notice her as he arches a pale eyebrow. He puts down his utensil and bends his head close to her, saying something to her. The girl looks at his face, still void of much expression, but for a shrug. Her lips break into a smile, and then a giggle, her hand raising to her mouth.
It's easy to follow the deep, harrowing ache of his own heart and grab Potter's hand out of his pocket, jostling it out into his own, pulling him along to the way of the staircases. Potter stumbles behind him, after him, by the suddenness of it all.
That night, he spent dinner with three of his favourite people together in the same room, for the very first time. Though it was initially strange and uneasy, eventually, like a tense muscle relaxing, it began to fall away when they touched upon a common topic with Draco — charity organisations and causes with Hermione, and Quidditch with Ron.
When Harry looks up at him again, Draco has turned back to the night. He's smiling slightly, the same serene thing, just wider, mellowing around his eyes. Harry can't stop looking at him, at the pull of his mouth.
Malfoy had slowed to a stop in front of Harry. He was adjusting the strap of his satchel over his shoulder, looking oddly nervous. His quicksilver eyes darted over at his friends for a brief moment, who were looking at Malfoy with wary.
But what he hoped he would never find out was that Harry knew it all long before he did, because that was where the trouble lied, where it would hurt most.
Harry walked to the closest Apparition point, turned into every crack of it until he was outside of Grimmauld Place, walking up the porch and to the door.
Harry's heart dips heavy in his chest. "Oh."
There's a scuffle of a sound some feet away. Draco snaps upright.
come back anyway?"
Draco's head is snapping up, sat on the edge of the bed, when Harry opens the door. He's breathing in a very controlled way, blinking a little fast.
"I just wish," Potter says, softly. "I don't want you to keep living in those dreams, you know… they weren't real. They weren't… they were just dreams."
The Manor opened to them as a vast hall full of golden lights, a chandelier in the very centre of the ceiling and bright-lit sconces beside auburn curtains. There were people everywhere, the hubbub of chorus and chatter slowing, the heads turning, as they watched the two of them walk through the room.
~ Wheezy
"We lost the baby's magical signature, Mr. Potter. I'm sorry," he said in the most apologetic tone ever and Hermione gasped. So did Ron, which sounded more like a donkey's bray.
“Your take on Malfoy’s intentions behind killing your child?”
"I want cuddles and kisses," Harry mumbled against Draco's neck and it took all the self-control in Draco for keeping his chuckles inside his throat.
Pulling out his wand with a slight bit of difficulty, given the situation, he conjured his Patronus and sent it off to Ron with a message demanding him to bring his arse to St Mungo’s.
Draco let go too as he bled for his husband, and the high of Harry drinking in all his pain yet gifting him with more of the same brought him to an edge of a cliff he wouldn't mind falling off of.
“No,” he said feebly, his smile now completely gone.
When exhaustion fell over them eventually, they slept tangled together. Not even in their nightmares did they let go of each other.
Red hair swam in his vision until it gave a clear view of Ronald Weasley in his face, still shaking him ever so eloquently.
“Her vitals are good. You will need to fill out some forms, Mr. Weasley, but that can be arranged for later. Please ensure that you follow the required practice of Cleanliness and Calm around the baby,” when Ron nodded and sheepishly pulled his now wet finger out of his daughter’s mouth, Eastoft turned to Hermione. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley, it is highly essential that you feed the baby girl now. If she is fed within the first one hour of her birth, both her magical and physical growth shall be stable throughout. As long as you are with us, we will be informing you of when and how to feed your baby. For today, we’ll limit the baby with your milk. Tomorrow, you and your husband will be taught how to stabilize your baby’s magical core with your own.”
Tried so hard to forget our fights; lock them away and start our days afresh because we fought just like every other couple. In fighting, love strengthens but sadly, my love for you only dwindled. No, it shifted. It found an old flame. Ginny. Lord, she made me so happy. Even to this day, she knows what to say to me and how to uplift my mood. I don't know how she does it... She just does. And in time, I had to choose the one who made me happy now, hadn't I? If you could look at me now, you'd know. And if you ever loved me, you'd agree that we broke up for the best. Now that you've invaded my thoughts yet again, I desire to see you. I wish to know what has become of you and how you are faring. For years, I wanted to come to you and apologize. In hindsight, I have realized that as much as I depended on you, you leaned on me too. And I had left you without any support. Though we weren't legally bound, you were my responsibility. I should've done something and I regret that I haven't laid out the slope for you. I slid away and left you atop the lone pillar. Hence the fear in me brews with passing days asking one and the same question everyday - Would you allow me back in your life?

“I am sure that this is alcohol,” he stressed while doing so.
“He doesn’t like taking orders much, does he? Obnoxious prat,” Draco commented as he munched on a big tub of Schezwan cheese popcorn that was settled in his lap.
Physical pain, Draco could take; heck, he was accustomed to it but something was different in the way Harry spoke to him. It wasn’t like the other times when Harry first threw a punch and Draco hit him back with a fist of his own where, in the end, both were bruised.
“You don’t look so good,” Harry commented, inching his hand towards Draco’s and intertwining their fingers when Draco didn’t pull away from his touch.
~ Wheezy
“Evidently, I did not. Isn’t that why you belabored me to the point of death? If your friends hadn’t intervened, I’d be stewing in Hell for my crimes, isn’t that right?”

Harry’s breaking down right in front of him but given how broken Draco himself was, he didn’t dare try and soothe Harry. He couldn’t. What would he say? That he’d be better? That they’d be better? He couldn’t spew a load of bullshit now, could he? So he sat back, the heaviness in his chest only getting worse and allowed Harry to cling on to him and silently cry. Harry needed someone and Draco became that someone.
Her mind supplied and she dug into her robe pocket for it immediately.

Apparently, all the Ministry employees except a few select Aurors were given holidays until Christmas. And Harry was just one of those SPECIAL Aurors that the Ministry seemed reluctant to let go of.
'Sure, love. Don't stay out too long okay?' she pulls off her thick grey scarf and wraps it over the pale blue one around my neck. She casually checks if I've my gloves on even though she was the one who put them there before we left. Then she gives me a once over and pats my belly, signalling she's done dolling me up for the cold night so that I can go wherever I want to go.
“Well, I do!” Harry spluttered rather defensively.
“Okay. If given the chance, would you fly now?” she asked.
Thank you for all the kudos!
that you want to be rid of your past. Isn’t that why you made an effort with us, the Weasleys who you once hated?”
Harry nodded his head.
“This keeps me sane; keeps panic attacks at bay,” Draco admitted.
Draco never understood or questioned Potter’s intentions in releasing him from the Azkaban but if all Potter wanted was sex; he could go and get it from the Weasley girl or any other street whore. He wouldn’t let Potter turn Draco into a slut for his sickening pleasure. Draco didn’t sign up for this. With all his strength and perfect timing but wrong aim, Draco kicked back trying to get Potter in his groin but failing as his foot landed unceremoniously on Potter’s thigh. It was enough though. Harry’s hold on him loosened and he stumbled back, grunting in pain. Taking his chance, Draco made a run for it and was almost out of the Kitchen when he heard Harry yell, “Incarcerous!” once again. This time, the ropes wound around his feet and he fell flat on his stomach, saving the impact to his face by covering it with his bound palms; an action that sent a terrible jolt of pain coursing through his knuckles. His entire body ached due to his unbidden crash to the floor.
“I’ll have a Chocolate Strawberry Peanut-Butter Sundae. What about you, Draco?” she turned to him.
Thank you for being patient with my irregular posting schedules. I am just too cooped up with work and I have no time to indulge myself or my readers.
The dinner was the best one Draco had in years and he gulped down more than his stomach could take. Molly was generous in serving food and Draco didn't protest. Even when his stomach screamed at him in pain, he didn't stop stuffing food into it. God knows when he'd be able to eat the good stuff again. Not that his cooking was bad, but Molly's was way better than anything he could ever cook in his lifetime.
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Dinkydog, Rose, Babygirl33, Laura, IamMyself, Solitarysoul, Irisk, and MadamePerverell for your comments!
“Not a Malfoy anymore. He’s Draco Potter now,” Harry corrected.
Draco cried out yet again in sheer physical agony. "I deserve it." This time, he not only said it aloud for Harry's ego and rage to be satiated but also thought so in his mind, as he started to believe that maybe Harry became a mess because of him, and the pain ebbed away. If only he could turn back time, he would have acted a bit more differently and saved Harry's child, no matter how grudgingly. Then, it wouldn't have come to this. Harry wouldn't be hurting Draco. They would've been cuddling on the lovely blue sofa, watching some chick-flick and bantering away.
“What?” Harry rasped.
"I brought you some breakfast. How do you like your eggs?" she then placed a big picnic box on the table between them, waiting for Draco's answer.
"Potter," Draco looked up at him with lust-filled eyes and Harry's resolve to be gentle broke upon seeing Draco's blood coated face and his subtle hip moments, asking and begging for contact.
All their happy moments suddenly seemed to wither away into nothingness as October dawned and Draco had no idea why. They hit each other and then cuddled with each other moments later usually but as September progressed into the middle of October, Draco could sense Harry keeping him at bay. He would go to the Ministry early and come back really late and Draco assumed Harry had lots of work, what with being an Auror and hunting the bad guys in hiding. Yet, once again, Draco was proven wrong when Harry stumbled in at midnight into their room reeking of alcohol and stinky perfume. Draco had been wide awake then, waiting for Harry, just to demand an explanation regarding his unusual and new habit. It had been so wrong of him, Draco realized later.
“Draco, I’m serious,” Ginny asserted in a set tone.
“Harry’s Floo is always open to us,” she said noncommittally.
That shut Draco up. He couldn’t deny that in his attempt to fulfill the task of killing Dumbledore, he almost murdered Ronald Weasley and Katie Bell. Heck, he’d even tried to kill Harry!
(See the end of the chapter for
Only to fall back to where we began.
“What is it?” Harry rushed in hurriedly. One look at his friend and he knew that her baby was coming.
“Smells heavenly, yum!” Harry’s voice floated into the kitchen as he sat down on one of the dining chairs watching Draco cook breakfast.
“Have you considered taking a break and going on a holiday?”
Then, after almost eight long years and the death of his parents – his wonderful, lovely, foolish Mother who followed her husband in the name of love – the Golden Boy had come to rescue him. Harry needn’t have given him two choices and a minute because the moment he walked into Draco’s cell, Draco strongly knew that he would choose Harry. It would always be Harry over anything. He would take Harry in any form he came. Always.
“Consider this a treat for bringing you out, okay? Today’s on me,” she answered gaily before paying the said amount.
A smoke. Draco desperately wanted a smoke. He couldn’t bear her silence or her accusations. Why was she telling him all of this? He felt awful enough without her reciting their past. Pain would certainly do him good. A side glance at her told him that she wasn’t looking at him but at the wall opposite them. That was all he needed as his right hand found purchase on the burns decorating his gruesome Mark. Just a pinch and the pain from it took him to Heaven.
A glance to his left answered all he wanted to know. Draco Malfoy, in the flesh, was walking towards where he sat. It’s been so damn long since Harry had seen his immaculate pointy features. Assuming the Azkaban softened not only his attitude but also his physical appearance was so wrong of him. His blond hair was gelled back and he was wearing a pastel lavender button down shirt and black denims. Draco looked more like a Muggle than a wizard. Taking a break from observing him, he cast his gaze at the resident onlookers who were not hiding their seething glares as they followed his brisk pace. Only because of his presence, Harry thought, did no one dare attack Draco, who was his legal husband.
Harry thought as the nurses rolled Hermione off him onto a stretcher.
"What's wrong with you?!" Draco gritted out. He didn't know why he was angry though. All he wanted was an explanation for the state Harry was in and he certainly didn't like the perfume coming off of Harry's body. It didn't smell like Harry's cologne.
Thank you Nananana_saucy_riceballs, Irisk, CherylMercury for your precious comments! As usual, they made my day.
“No, stay away from me!” he croaked out, fear filling him at a rapid rate, as his dazed mind still believed that Potter was back again to hit him into oblivion. And this time, he would be successful as Draco was too out of sorts to protest or fight back. His body felt heavier than ever, like a sunk ship at the bottom of the ocean.
“I feel free, like all my burdens vanish at once. When I somersault in the sky on my broom, I worry about the sticking charm I usually place on my glasses and not about the responsibilities waiting for me on the ground,” Harry said truthfully though his foul mood at being thwarted ever so gently persisted.
“She does,” Harry emphasized.
"Suit yourself then," Draco said through clenched teeth and continued eating his rice bowl just for the sake of it though he didn't feel hungry anymore.
“Whatever you want to talk about. I’ll be the ears you’ve always wished for and I’ll be the shoulder you can always lean on. Together, we’ll heal you,” her face broke into a radiant smile.
“It doesn’t change the fact that you are hurting me and hurting yourself too,” Draco remarked.
“Talk,” Draco said, turning around to face Harry with arms folded across his chest, mirroring Harry’s posture, after stubbing the cig on the window sill, leaving behind black soot.
Sometime during the previous week, Draco received an owl from Granger. After sending the owl away with some treats, he contemplated if he should read the letter or not. He didn’t have to think much and after getting to know the letter’s contents, he spiraled down into a hole yet again. The word
“Did you do this?!” he bellowed, shaking Draco’s arm wildly. His eyes flared with anger directed towards himself. Yet, given the situation and their past, Draco assumed Harry was blaming him and pointing out his mistakes once again, that his husband’s anger was directed towards him.
Harry followed Draco into the living room and sat down beside him on the sofa. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco flinch at their close proximity but neither of them made any move to sit afar. They sat with their upper arms and thighs touching and Harry reveled in Draco’s warmth.
"Two choices, Malfoy," Harry repeated for the last time, bringing Malfoy out of his thoughts.
“I heard about Granger,” Draco said as he sat down on the chair next to Harry’s.
Shortly afterward, Draco bid goodbye to an extremely wretched Harry Potter, who promised over and over again that he would get better for Draco. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t believe that Harry would be healed one day. Just that he had no trust in his own condition. He didn’t believe that he would ever move on from his past or stop hearing the voice in his head that cruelly advised him to kill himself each and every day for all the crimes he’d committed; for all the innocent lives that lay dead on his name; for being who he was and the choices he made so recklessly.
“That is who you truly are, Malfoy,” Harry said once again.
“I’m not! (hiccup) I wasn’t thriving either, you know. I was in war for (hiccup) God’s sake!”
“I don’t think I can,” he said in a pleading tone.
"Quick, Potter," Draco urged, lifting up his legs by resting his feet on the bed and letting them fall open loosely for Harry to watch his desire in all its wet glory.
Hermione smiled. “You have to figure it out yourself this time.”
“We will only need to talk to each other and I can sense very well that you are uncomfortable here. You can set the place and time and I’ll be there for you. Check?”
After washing Draco’s back, Harry shifted them so that they were facing each other, knees pulled up to their chests and touching one another. He shut the shower now that the bath tub was filled and they were wet and the position they were in would directly allow the spray to hit Draco’s face. Gingerly, he put his hands on Draco’s upper arms and squeezed affectionately, mutely prodding at Draco to look him in the eye. And, he did. For a second, Harry wanted Draco to look away because he couldn’t ignore or be responsible for the pain cradled in those grey pools. He sighed, breaking their eye contact and staring at the scars on Draco’s chest as if they were more interesting.
“You cannot refuse! He has the right to choose, Mr. Potter,” the guy argued.
“Figures. I was upset, Harry. I needed a drink. I was burdened with so much that for once, I wanted to feel nothing anymore. I NEVER intended for the child to go like this. Believe me,” Draco elaborated.
Draco felt attacked when Ginny proceeded to throw open the wardrobe doors in search of Merlin knew what! It was the final straw she decided to draw from the haystack and Draco pulled her away from the wardrobe to keep her from tainting anything else.
"Sorry about that, doc. He's mean when he's angry," Ron said apologetically, trying to justify Harry's rage and the Healer nodded in understanding.
“All of us lived under his thumb, saving our loved ones from his strike! Tell me, who did you lose in the war? Friends? Family? I lost my Godfather. I lost my friends! Who was responsible for their deaths if not you?!”
“You can go see him now and come by my office later for signing the obligatory forms. And as a precaution, do not perform magic around him. Do not touch him. Even the physical touch of the bonded can cause magic to misbehave in cases such as this,” Yeager warned before leaving.
- Dark Harry, descriptions of blood and pain, infidelity
"No, I'm not saying I wanted the baby. I was talking about alcohol. The Healer said that alcohol ingestion and my newly awakened magical core rejected the baby's addition to me. It is what caused the miscarriage," Draco said, his heart palpitating at a maddening pace in fear of Harry's reaction to their situation. He just wanted Harry to understand that it wasn't Harry's choice alone in creating a new life inside Draco's body and that as the supposed bearer, Draco himself had a large part in making that choice for them. Right now, Draco only wanted Harry to calm down and think with a sane mind. Harry actions in the next minute would decide how their life would turn out to be and Draco didn't want to lose all that they'd built up until that point. Not over a foolish mistake.
Oh, yes, he could hear Harry alright. And that was what bothered him.
“- so I came here to discuss us and our situation. I don’t want to lose you,” Harry, at this point, noticed that Draco was eerily quiet. “Are you listening?” he queried but Draco didn’t respond. “Draco?” Harry called out and laid his hand gently on his husband’s rather hot knee. That wasn’t normal. He then proceeded to touch Draco on his stomach and the skin there was extremely hot. So was Draco’s neck and his armpits were like touching fire in all its glory.
The morning after, as Harry looked up at a peacefully sleeping Draco, his heart swelled in happiness that Draco finally chose to forgive him. The blonde might not have said it out loud but he didn't need to. Draco stayed. And that was all the forgiveness he could offer to Harry, who graciously accepted it.
"It was good. Hey, I was wondering if it would be okay with you if I had my sessions here instead," Harry asked.
“Well, you had your fill. Or weren’t you satisfied? Do you want me to roll over and spread for you again? Of course, you’d have to wait a bit for that.”
“It’s your husband!” the stranger, who apparently recognized Draco, pointed a finger at him and Harry gaze followed the finger's motion from where he lay sprawled on the floor.
Their anniversary in April was almost nearing – three weeks more to go, and Draco thought an early gift was in order for his husband. So did Harry when he brought home a huge pile of DVDs which Draco could watch in his absence. They set up a movie-night, ordered takeaway, and Draco chose to watch what was, according to him, supposed to be a historical movie and not a romantic chick flick - Titanic. Lost somewhere in the throes of the passion of Jack and Rose, Draco sought out Harry’s lips with fervor and so began their passionate night. Movie and food completely forgotten, Harry picked up his husband and all but rushed into their bedroom upstairs, banging and crashing as he kissed Draco while climbing the stairs. He still had a purple bruise on his back where he collided with the steps as they fell.
“You could always dissolve your marriage and send him back to Azkaban,” she suggested, looking pointedly at Harry’s empty ring finger.
His head throbbed and it was just an understatement. Harry wanted nothing more than to hit his head with a hammer until all the pain coursing through it ebbed away. What had he been doing the previous day? Upon retrospection, he recollected bits and pieces.
“Harry?” he’d turned his head to side searching for his husband in the darkness.

“Still, you would’ve gotten a couple of shots like the other times. We fought today in the morning, yes? It hurt like hell when you whacked me in my stomach,” Harry remarked lightly but Draco looked at him with eyes so full of pain that Harry was jostled away from his attempt at mirth.
“It isn’t about us or me; this is your selfishness which you forced unto me. I will not have any part in it,” Draco declared and left no room for a further argument which only angered Harry to no end.
“Sure, Mr. Potter. Now, your assignment,” she started as she took out a thin brown covered book from a drawer in her desk and Harry groaned. “Before you and I meet again the next week, I need you to write down what you love and what you hate about yourself in this journal,” she handed him the book.
He understood that in Draco's dictionary, it meant that it was more than great and about that, he felt utterly relieved. Somewhere in the middle, he thought that he was forcing Draco into this as he didn't even ask for the man's consent before doing whatever they had done but hearing from Draco's mouth that what they did was great, and Draco's body that responded to him sweetly and obligingly swept away his doubts into the gutter, to where they belonged.
Hermione's voice nudged his mind and for a fraction of a second, he wanted to throw his wand away and ask Draco what she meant. Was it only Smoking or was there something else he didn't know?
“I’m waiting, actually. I haven’t yet seen her,” there was a hint of longing in Granger’s voice.
"You keep saying that," he snarled after he took a large gulp of his coffee and let the bitter taste wash his mouth and settle down warmly in his stomach.
“Sure,” he replied.
I kept on asking you if I did something. I chanted like a mantra that I would change whatever it is in me so that you could be happy with me and me alone. You just wouldn't agree and you shut the door on me after letting me know that you truly loved Ginerva and it would be the last time we'd ever meet. The thud of the door after you left still ricochets in my ears.
"I want to. I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't know what overcame me," Draco said and Harry could hear the honesty lacing those words.
“I don’t know. I’m so used to being around him that I can’t imagine my life without him. He CURES me, ‘Mione. I feel so stable around him. Is it supposed to be love?” Harry asked like a child.
Everything seems like a distant dream in the face of a promise which will be broken.
~ Wheezy
"Eight, or nine," she answered.
"Yes, yes! You should've brought him to me or Hermione right away, Harry, darling. You know we're the best at healing charms," Molly admonished with hands on her hips.
“Can’t or won’t?”
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again.
“Good day, Mr. Potter,” she smiled crookedly and shut the door.
"Draco, look at me," Harry whispered as he kissed his husband gently and Draco complied. Through his tears, he could see how much Harry wanted this, wanted him. The way Harry smiled down at him was more than he ever deserved and he couldn't help but etch this memory into an unerasable part of his mind. This man gave him a chance no one ever dared to give and for the first time in his life, Draco wanted to rewrite their past. He wanted to go back and make things right. He wished for all his bad deeds to be gone so that this future him would be free of that burden and live his life as Harry's equal instead of depending on him for everything.
“And I need you to say that my child is okay!" Harry screamed. The bulb overhead the group broke and instead of shards, pulverized glass rained over them. Vigilantly, Ronald spelled a protective cover over them as soon as he felt a surge in Harry’s magical power, and knowing his best friend, something was bound to break because of his shooting magic. Healer Yeager looked at Ron and Hermione to convey that he couldn't do anything else and that Harry needed to be put under control. Else, he'd be thrown off the property to maintain the safety of other patients.
“You punched and hexed him?” Draco spoke without thinking and he regretted it as soon as the final word left his mouth. But Ginny didn’t seem to care. She actually leaped up and sat back down in her seat a few times, which to Draco, seemed a strange way to control anger.
How can the woes of pain be controlled?
Then he went shopping for food and Lights.

“Get off,” Draco mumbled sleepily when Harry applied a Healing salve to Draco’s rope burns.
“I hate you so much,” he sighed in contentment when the skin bearing his Dark Mark burnt beautifully under his almost done cig.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
“Back to first names again now, are we?” Draco asked mockingly, nonetheless, sat down on the dining chair across from Ron.
And Draco invited the pain willingly.
Five days later, Healer Yeager diagnosed Draco Potter to be perfectly sound in health but he couldn't say the same for the baby. Meanwhile, reporters loitered around the hospital, somehow getting wind of Draco and Harry’s predicament, waiting for the said men’s statement. All they knew was the old news of Draco being pregnant. And to this date, even after all these years, Harry couldn’t understand how the reporters succeeded in catching him in their nets.
'He deserves this,' he got a response that sounded so like him inside his head.
"You can't ask me that!" Harry pulled back from Draco as if touching the blonde hurt him.
“Pick whatever you want, my Lord,” Harry teased and Draco huffed indignantly though he felt happy at the normalcy between them. Harry could blow a fuse anytime. Until then, Draco supposed he would bask in the warmth between them.
“Nothing happened to them, right?” he asked, staring at a spot on the table, trying to recollect the picture of the little baby girl, Rose, in her soft bundle of blankets.
Harry quickly left the room, pulled his pants on there, and then made for him back inside. "Delete it!" he exclaimed.
Harry laughed, which was painful at this point for his muscles. He put up one hand pacifyingly. "Okay, okay. Your secret is safe with me."
He places the tip of the quill against it and writes.
He loves him more than he'd ever thought it was possible to love anybody.
His home is an intangible world away, and he can never go back.
As they're waiting for dinner, Harry sits there and observes them. Somehow they come upon the topic of Obliviation procedures, and Hermione is clearly fascinated by the mechanisms of what Draco tells her. It's different from a normal Obliviation, much more pointed and specific, almost like a magical surgery. Neville and Ron are interested in the tattoos on Draco's forearms, and Draco is interested in the tattoos all along Charlie's arms and down his neck, and Ron is explaining his own ideas for what he's always considered getting.
"Harry," Draco drawled. "Come back to bed, darling."
Getting kissed on the cheek by Malfoy. Check.
"Well. For whatever it's worth now, I really do like that you're in love with me."
"No bastard should ever look at her wrong again, and I
He wanted Draco to find out what happened to him. He wanted him to know everything that was his to know.
Harry swallows hard. His brows twitch into a frown. "I'm sorry."
"Whatever you need," Pansy cuts him off. "Pay me back some day, but for fuck's sake, just — just get better. You

"I wouldn't call it stalking, just… cautiously watching."
Luna shakes her head, folding her hands at her front. "Oh, that's alright. I don't get offended very easily."
"Yeah," Harry said, when he trailed off. He said nothing else after. Draco didn't ask anything more either, and Harry was grateful. The next day, he firecalled his Mind-Healer again.
"Then we'll go back if it does. Come on, I'm tired of the same four walls."
"No," Draco said. He tore away from him. "No, I…" He swallowed, looking nauseated.
Harry's brows jumped to his hairline. "Really?
Twenty years. That was twenty years of Harry's life, gone. Just like that.
* * *
Draco had shown up a little late. He had dressed up nicely in a burgundy suit and trousers, a black shirt. His hair had grown long enough now to be swept back from his face in a wavy half-up, half-down.
"Er, yeah. Charms, Potions, DADA, Transfiguration and Herbology."
Draco didn't understand this before. He understands it now. He is just one person, hardly enough to fill a lifelong void. He loves Potter like he might die without him, but Potter has more than enough to live without him.
Draco's response came on their shared Charms class in the form of an animated doodle of an otter, all whiskers and snout and tail, with round glasses and a lightning scar at its head. He writes under it,
"It seems all I do is get in the way of your life," Draco said, in a choked and derisive breath.
Harry's lips quirked playfully, laying his chin on his palm. He knew Malfoy probably didn't mean it to imply having Harry here was a special occasion, but it was still hilarious to watch the man squirm.
"Yeah. Your mum… she told me."
at least call you Draco?"
He had caught sight of Draco next to Luna on the sidelines, arms folded. He was looking down and away, lips rolling back into a bitten smirk, as if on the edge of a reluctant sort of laugh.
Draco blinks hard at the sting in his eyes, a tension around his jaw, and there is still that tight, swooping feeling in his chest.
"Promise me you won't let this influence your decision?" Ginny had said, as they strolled through the Burrows' backyard. She waited for Harry's obliging nod, an exaggeratedly solemn jerk, before she continued. "I'd… try. You know. If there wasn't anything else? I can't imagine living like that. Stuck to someone all the time."
Draco hit his chest, but it was feeble, hardly hurting. He was hitting him again and standing rigid when Harry tried to pull him in. It wasn't too hard to draw him into his chest on the next tug, gripping him tight as he was falling, gasping out in a terrible voice, "Look what you did to me."
For a while after Harry's outburst the night of his birthday, Draco had remained amicable with him, just as he'd been the morning after. But he'd always drawn away from him when it came to sex, always refused and said he wasn't in the mood. Harry stopped asking by the third time, because by then he had seen the look on his face, and realised that he wasn't quite over the way Harry had lashed out at him, so out of nowhere, when they'd become friends.
"I'll take you there one day, if you'd like," Draco said, looking up at her, the camera between his hands. He sounded sincere. Harry knew he was.
There was silence. Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, glanced over at Draco to gauge whether he just did something wrong. He had a brow raised, an unfathomable expression, pink-cheeked. His glass hovered near his mouth, and he looked down at the top of it, watching it slosh gently.
"Malfoy, I am
A pull on his wrist, clammy and light, brought him back, turning to look at Malfoy.
Harry swallowed hard, wanting to rip his sweaty and hot skin off, wanting to bury his face into his hands and crawl into a hole and never come out. He kept himself still instead, nodding stiffly, smiling even more stiffly.
Harry smiles at her. He then looks to Ron. He seems to be trying to absorb this, staring ahead with a furrow of his brows.
He wasn't lying. He walked by every painting in the gallery and stopped to stare at a few for very long minutes, his eyes roving up and down over them, as if taking in every detail.
Draco settles in bed and casts the constellations spell. He watches the night swirl up into the ceiling. There's a memory, a voice murmuring,
"I don't think…" Harry says, hoarse. He looks down at his hands. "Gin, I don't think we should be together anymore."
"He was the one that saved me."
accompany me to the latest gala my organisation will be hosting." He had halted to a stop, abrupt as he whirled back on him, wild-eyed and manic. "Do you understand? No, you do not owe me, but you certainly owe
As a wedding gift, Harry painted for them a portrait, Hermione in the ethereal white dress she would wear, Ron in the fancy, dark robes Draco and Ginny helped pick out. It was one of Harry's best works yet, because he spent weeks on it, paying close attention to every detail.
When he was sat on the bed, closing his eyes, trying to settle the fear shrinking his heart, thinking of all the things he wanted out of desperation — to somehow stop Draco from finding out, hoping he wouldn't find out anything that could ruin him again, wishing he could change something back in time or now or swap places with—
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said, softly, as he held it up between them. He was tired and sad, his eyes gritty and lashes clumped, but he was smiling, warm and loved and full of love, and he wanted Draco to have everything he wanted in life. To be happy, most of all. "Will you marry me?"
Draco's throat convulses. He tries not to
they would be panicking, but right now, as bad as he felt for making them worry, Harry didn't think he could deal with anything—not the questions if Harry opened the door or the freak-outs at whatever answers he would give, and he
He went through the corridor and into the living room, found Draco stirring awake on the couch, at the sound of the door opening and shut. The light was on and the book had slipped out of his hands, the front flat onto his own belly, and when his bleary eyes landed on Harry, he smiled, all tired and in his lavender night robes.
Sara walked closer and gently massaged her wife’s arm. Leaning into her partner and humming quietly. “Hush my love. We adopted Hadrian legally and have provided for him and raised him since he was seven. If they want to fight us. They can fucking
Hadrian woke to a banging at the door, growling, Hadrian crawled out from under the bed. Glaring at the door angrily.
Draco had gotten on the train interested to find the boy who lived, but he found himself rather satisfied with what he’d found instead. His mother and father would hardly care either way as long as he made nice wizarding friends that had a shred of a decent head on their shoulders. Hadrian’s head leaned back slowly, craning to look at him. Those eyes pinned him down, and even though Draco knew he wasn’t another empath it felt like the other boy was baring out his soul. It was a slightly thrilling feeling.
And then Draco's veins go cold, his breaths frozen and high in his chest.
At some point through the night, Draco had rolled over in his sleep to his other side, his back to Harry, swathed in covers up to his neck. Harry pulled him closer by the arm around Draco's abdomen, smushing his nose and mouth against his blanketed back. He swallowed down the ache in his throat, stared at the back of his platinum head for a moment, and then closed his eyes, listening closely to his cadenced lilts of soft, deep exhales and inhales in the silence and feeling his back rise and fall with it against his lips.
"Thank you," Draco said, though it was rather delayed. He cleared his throat.
and I'm
He thought he
"I don't quite like wands very much anymore," Luna says, a little out of nowhere. "But that's okay." She lifts a hand at the line of flowers beside her as she walks along them. They break off, swirl up into the air and weave themselves into a circle of flowers. "I don't really need one."
By the third time it'd happened, Harry understood it was another symptom, even if it felt catastrophic and terrifying. The second time too, Harry had found Draco retching in the bathroom, gagging when there was nothing left, violently shaking against the wall after.
Harry clenched his jaw. He lifted his head and stared Malfoy flatly in the eyes. "Bill. His name's Bill." Malfoy only shrugged, uncaring. "Do I need to remind you of how he became one in the first place?"
Harry spent some time making finishing touches upon it, improving details here and there, blending colours a little more until he was somewhat satisfied. The warm and cool colours looked unevenly toned, exaggerated just enough that it looked vibrant and slightly surreal, but he had always found something charming about that.
Malfoy half-smiled slyly and pointed his wand at the man, who was no longer glaring at them, but walking forward, unsuspecting and content in his misconception that he was walking away without any consequences.
"I didn't feel like it today. So?"
way, Harry," Ron said. "Bloody Hell. He was a lot less creepy to me when he was minding his own business.
Harry roused, not entirely certain what had pulled him from sleep.
Harry swallowed, his heart a dull, weary race. He brought his fingers almost to his brow, pushed it up half in his mop of curls instead, the other half at his hairline. A close-mouthed breath shuddered through his nose, trembling through his shoulders.
"You're mocking me."
After Potions, Malfoy hadn't shown up for the rest of the classes yesterday and he didn't show up for any of the classes the next day either. It was nearly two hours before lunch that the

Outside of class, he would sneak them into Harry's robes, or in between the pages of his Quidditch magazines to remind him of his homework or tests (a sketch of Harry running after a large circle labeled
"But I do miss him," Draco said, quieter. The secret. "I know he wasn't a good man, or even the best father… but sometimes I think of being six, that time he read to me with all the voices… and I…"
, folds it into a crane as he listens to the lecture—the theoretical aspects of the Gouging spell—and then sends it flying three seats up and on his left to Potter.
"No buts. It's not your fault and you don't get a say in what people want to do out of love for you. Your life
, whilst resting a hand over the wild pounding of Draco's heart mimicking his own. He'd feel it, and it didn't feel like that. It had burnt out, a good quarter of it, but it wasn't—it couldn't be—
There was silence, and then, "Excessive magic operating in a single body can be lethal, Mr. Potter. Yes." Xavier shrugged. It was strange, infuriating, that he seemed so desensitized to it all, like something he'd already seen countless times, but to Harry, it all crumbled upon him with the weight of a mountain. "So it would be favourable to keep it stabilised as much as possible."
"Yeah," Harry said, shrugging, putting his hands into his trouser pockets. "Let's go out, have a drink or something. I don't know about you, but we've been cooped up too long at the house with… everything, you know. I don't feel like going back right now."
Malfoy's mouth tightened slightly, a small puff of air through his nose. His eyes were fixated up at the ceiling. It made Harry feel stupid.
"I love him too." Pansy looks at him. "He's my friend, and I love him too. And I had to... I was there to see what happened to him, when you weren't. And maybe you won't mean to hurt him, like you didn't the last time—" She gives him a thin, cold smile here. "but sometimes you can hurt people anyway, and if any of those memories come back, and they
feel whatever this sick curse wants me to feel and I want you out of my life already!" He breathed, heavy and hard after his outburst, the confusion at his core tangling him up further. Nothing he said made him feel better, or felt like the reason why he was angry right now. It drained out of him. His chest heaved, slow, and he swayed slightly on his feet. The world looked surreal, too bright. He was left with something that only made him feel weak and tired, croaking, "I don't want you."
His face was guarded. Something brimmed behind the calm facade, the transfixed gaze meeting Harry's. His jaw was firmly locked, a knot of muscle jumping there.
A lot did happen.
Malfoy grabbed his shoulders and pushed through the crowd. Harry was somewhat— okay,
Draco was bowed over Teddy's toes, tucking one side of his hair behind an ear, quick and messy, trying to see. It still left behind loose, swirling tendrils.
Draco keeps his face careful. "I know they felt like all you had. And you weren't wrong, when you said that I was more in love with a dream than you."
"Thanks," Harry said, and then laughed a bit at himself, rubbing the back of his neck.
"You're dying," he whispered, a tremor and a hitch.
Later that day, Draco asked him what he was doing, sounding only a little too casual as he clinked and clunked through the bar. Harry turned the canvas around with a lift, towards him, saying, "You can take a look."
There was no ceremony, only the two of them sitting across from each other in Wizengamot. There were their families, and the wizard that would officiate their marriage, marriage license documents signed by a wand with their magical signature, and when Harry watched Malfoy sign them, and when he was trying to push the ring onto Harry's finger, careful not to touch him, he saw his hand shake just as his own did.
That's what I called to tell you, kid. This cursebreaker knows how to alter bonds. He says he can bring yours and Malfoy's down to a quarter of its life. Five years, but no less."
Draco laughed, quavering and thick. "Most annoyingly noble tosser I have ever met."
" His voice comes a strangled rasp, with a desperately controlled quivering. "Don't touch me
They both turned around, and found a man walking down at the adjacent end of the street with a woman who seemed to be trying to talk him out of it. He was sneering at them. They must have been at the restaurant.
in a small laugh. "Are you alright?" he asked, as he gathered the books up in his arms.
They sit on his bed as they eat together, one of Potter's legs hanging off the side, the other curled on the mattress. His tie is as askew as ever. The hem of his trousers are riding up, putting his mismatched socks on display. Second Year, Draco had noticed them. He'd made a snide comment, something about Potter being blind as well as colourblind. It leaves a tug of quiet endearment in his cheek now.
letting Harry push his nose into his satin robes, a hitch and a shudder of a breath,  holding him close through his underarms. Draco's hand came up, brushed light over the nape of Harry's neck, fingers resting at the base of his hair.
Harry watches Teddy, cooing and babbling until he's droopy-eyed. He nods, laughs and responds every now and then, kisses his curls. He thinks of Remus and Tonks.
Draco smiled, thin and wry. "Made fun of your dead parents. I didn't realise how much that could hurt… until I had a dead parent that everybody made fun of." He stared Harry in the eyes. His own looked so tired, sunken, and it hurt. Softly, "I'm sorry."
It was when he got to the floo that he heard footsteps behind him. Draco had pulled his suit onto his shoulders again, folding his overcoat on his arm. Harry said a general goodbye to everybody, and the roar of a green fire took them home.
She doesn't appear to mind it much when he does this.
"What,
"Did you know that… that no matter how perfect, nothing can ever stay perfect?" Malfoy said softly, after a long silence, fixated on the sky. Harry looked over, fixated on him. "You know, because—one way or another, something always ruins it, such as— as you yourself or your mind or forces beyond you."
, Harry felt out the word in his mind, looking at him.
Draco hums. In Harry's peripheral vision, he can see him turn to face ahead. "You were the last piece, since you were the clearest root of those memories. Forgetting you would have made my obliviation permanent."
"Dance with me?"
Harry looked up at him, and thought of the two of them in First Year, talking to each other from their beds in the boys dormitory about their future, about how brilliant it would be to become a duo saving the world together, fighting crime.
He has Draco try some of it, dipped in coconut chutney. It’s only then, when he’s lifting it to Draco’s lips that he remembers a part of Draco’s letters, speaking of moments just like these — the two of them in the morning light of a kitchen just like this, Draco on the counter, Harry making him try his cooking. Draco saying,
"We don't want you to eat alone," Hermione insists.
Draco's movements faltered at that, and then he continued, searching through a cabinet of some ingredients. It was full of strangely shaped things, colourful liquids, bags of herbs or plants, jars of internal organs or body parts of some creatures. A fang here, a claw there. A small heart. "I didn't ask you to do that," he said, indifferent.
"But she's right, you know," Harry says, in a low voice. "What if being with me does bring them all back a lot sooner?"
Luna had said,
"We should get up," Harry said, Draco humming behind him in agreement. He kissed Draco on the mouth again, and got up. He had to be at the St. Mungos pediatric ward soon, where he would polyjuice into well-liked public figures and book characters, or just remain as himself if wanted, and visit the children. Draco would have his classes in about an hour.
"I told you. Everything I ever wanted."
. That he had, in fact, not chosen to erase Harry wholly from his mind, the way it seemed he would.
"Yeah. No. I'll be fine." Harry stood to his feet. He was moving to make for the door, suddenly questioning why he came in the first place.
A week before Christmas, Draco gets to meet Teddy and Andromeda. Teddy is sleeping for his afternoon nap, and that is the way Draco sees him first, Andromeda in the doorway, Harry following alongside him.
Harry thanked her, smiling, taking the card back from her and sliding it back into his wallet. He folded it back up one-handed and pushed it into his pocket, picking up the fancy bag.
There was a time Harry found him sitting against the counter, having come home from a short visit to the Weasleys. Draco had as good as shoved him into the fireplace with all his insistence, telling him to go be somewhere outside of this house on his own and come back in an hour. Harry had come back a half an hour earlier.
Thank you so much for all the Kudos!
“Much to my chagrin, I don’t want to break this thing between us. Whatever we have, I know it’s unhealthy; I know I’m hurting him which in turn is hurting me to the point where I see no escape from each other. I know for a fact that he wants me as much as I need him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I would love to see more of you, Draco,” Harry admitted, his forehead resting against Draco’s.
Instead of spelling their clothes away, Harry took his time removing every bit of clothing that separated their bodies and worshipped his husband’s skin. Draco writhed beneath Harry’s clumsy ministrations but his thirst for proving that he was no lesser than a sex God had Draco flipping his husband onto his back and catching one of Harry's perky nipples between his teeth, earning a moan from the man. They knew that if they rubbed their erections together, they would be coming down from their high pretty soon so despite all the rush, they kept their lower bodies apart. Draco littered Harry’s slightly hairy chest with love bites and the Chosen One turned into a boneless puddle underneath him, muttering Draco's given name in enthralled ecstasy, begging for the blonde to kiss him more, wanting to do the same for Draco desperately.
“Go find someone else to replace me then. This time, make sure you don’t go by the Azkaban,” Draco shrugged.
“What?”
“Let’s go, Draco,” Harry called him.
“Let me get to the point. I am not happy with what happened and I wish I was here to help you, really,” she started, plopping down beside Draco on the settee.
“Stop it, Potter,” Draco warned futilely only to earn a low chuckle from his husband.
Harry's cheeks hurt with the intensity of his smile. Shaking his head in amusement, Harry kissed Draco wetly on the cheek, causing the blonde to gape in embarrassment.
Papercutter - Firstly, I think I need to thank you thrice for taking the time to read and comment on all of the three Harry Potter fanfics I posted on AO3. So, there you go, dear, thank you! I may not have answers to all of your questions but I don't think Draco's holding onto Harry just for survival. When you put two utterly and mentally damaged people together, no matter how intelligent they are or used to be, they seek out comfort in one another. It's damaging to the sane and safe onlookers who watch them from afar. But to those two, they've created a safe bubble around themselves and refuse to acknowledge that their relationship is wrong. They need to be healed and I don't think even after that, they'll let go of each other, no matter how twistedly they treat each other. Broken minds and hearts are dark, deceptive, and self-destructive. Only in this case, Harry breaks himself by inflicting pain on Draco. That is his kind of coping up with his past just like Draco, who thinks he deserves all the pain given to him because of his past. These are two boys in the bodies of adult men trying to make up for their past in an extremely wrong and dangerous way. This is a serious issue to touch and I've always wanted to write something like this. I don't know why I chose Harry and Draco but I hope to write this to the best of my abilities and in the right way. I really hope that I don't mess this up.
“They do have the right. You do too,” Draco looked straight into her eyes when he said the last part. Though he wanted her to stay, a part of him wanted her to push him away. Kindness was new to him for all he had known these past years was repugnance. Though a tiny part of him loved the thought of having her as a friend in his lonely life, he feared that one day she would come to her senses and leave him behind. Or worse, blame him for the deaths she had counted in her life because of Draco and hurt him, just like Harry did. He would not be able to take the same hit twice and make it out alive.
"Is this my present?" Harry asked when they parted for air.
Draco held Harry close to his heart and let him cry to his heart's content. Maybe that was all they needed. To accept each other as they were - battered and withered. They couldn't ever be fixed but they might not need fixing as long as they understood that they were broken. There wasn't always a need to fix a broken thing. Just couple it with something else that's broken and it might not feel as lonely or worthless anymore.
“What do I mean, huh?” Draco intoned, wearing a surly grin but choosing not to explain.
“Stay,” Draco ignored Harry’s question and when his magic didn’t protest in agony, he knew that Harry had stayed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“As you can see,” Draco drawled and out the cherry out on his makeshift ashtray – a kitchen plate.
“If the list is that long, I would really be very happy and impressed with you. And at our next appointment, we’ll discuss what you’ve written. Check?”
He hit the wall beside him and invited the pain of impact willingly. This was how he socked his husband yesterday. Draco had felt this pain under his blows.
Harry never addressed what it is that he felt towards Draco. Was it just lust? If it was, he wouldn’t feel like dying at the loss of Draco. It must be affection. It must be the reason why he supposed living with the man till his death wouldn’t be suffocating.
“I don’t expect you to. I committed a crime, Draco. I can’t ever forgive myself for that. I still wish to have a baby with you, if our future permits. Despite everything, believe me when I say, I really do care for you.  And I want you to get better too. Not just me.”
“He’ll kill Draco,” his wife whispered now, the anger that consumed her not a moment ago leaving her posture in one long sigh.
“Er, yeah. That’s great, I suppose. I’ll wait outside then. Just holler if you need me,” Harry was pretty sure that the last statement was for Draco.
"Thank you so much, Molly, Arthur," Harry said gratefully.
It didn't matter to him. The Weasleys, Granger, Harry, no one mattered to him. They were all pricks worse than Death Eaters and he didn't want their pity or namesake apologies which brought nothing but anger and agony to him. When he needed them, at least one of them couldn't spare a few minutes for him. Now that he was getting by on his own pretty well, Draco couldn't put the past behind him and move on by accepting the shitty lies spewing out of Granger's mouth.
Someone in my previous chapters had commented that Molly would not forgive Draco for all that had happened to her family. And yes, that is true. This incident shows how the Weasleys still hold a grudge against Death Eaters. Draco didn't kill the child knowingly yet his actions did. Also, he was ready to abort the child, which Molly and the other Weasleys didn't support. Hence, he was given the cold shoulder. As for Hermione, being a part of the Weasley family, she would be torn between helping the faultless Draco and attending to her family's wishes. You'll find some development in this chapter though. Harry Potter is broken in the head and yes, he needs help. Draco needs help too. And, I won't be saying anything else about them as this story will be telling you all you need to know.
"Hermione, dear, you should've told me sooner so that I would've arranged a special party for you guys! Nonetheless, I'm very happy for both of you. Congratulations!" Molly clapped her hands together, a wide smile on her chubby face.
to see the offspring of Weasley and Granger. Why had he even pondered the idea? It seemed extremely moot now that he thought about it. He had no obligation to be here. Then why had he forced his mind to agree to be here? Was it simply because of the loss of his own he wanted to have a glimpse at someone else’s gain? The thought was entirely disturbing, if not unnecessary. He had not made a connection after all. Their baby was lost before he could even grasp the situation he was unceremoniously thrust into. His heart throbbed painfully which only encouraged him to nip even harder at the burns covering his Mark. H

“The intention here is that you TRY, Mr. Potter. That will be your first step. Check?” she smiled.
“I never asked you to do that, Harry. I wanted to know what you feel about yourself. Clearly, it isn’t love,” her twinkling green eyes reminded him of Dumbledore for a fraction of second.
The rather pale face of the Mind Healer sitting across him remained as expressionless as ever. Weren’t Mind Healers supposed to be expressive and fawning over their patients so that they could get well sooner? Harry stared straight into her beady green eyes, so reminiscent of his’, yet a tad bit smaller, nestled inside a layer or two of black mascara. Her lips were thin and when she spoke, they seemed to get thinner. By no means was she petite but had all the curves in all the right places and at forty, she looked a catch, just like Ron had whispered into his ear in the presence of his wife, with her black hair tied into a low ponytail.
After a little prodding and a whole lot of begging under a veil of secrecy, Hermione agreed to look for you. Imagine my sheer surprise when she told me that you were still at our place. Our home. The one we built together. Are you still waiting for me? I know you have the funds to move places and I really thought you did. That is why I requested 'Mione to find you because she is an expert in every field. Why didn't you move, Draco? I finger the key to our home inside my coat pocket. If you are home now, I needn't use the key at all but I want to. Just so I could know if you've changed the locks. And if you didn't, I'll be a fool and gather selfishly that you love me like I love you and you kept our doors open for me so that I could find you.
“No,” he answered almost immediately.
I have always believed Ginny to be a woman of extremely strong personality. Hence I wrote her this way. Given my adoration for her, I think I'll be giving her a good chunk of this story's future chapters if possible since I didn't do her any good in my other fics (oneshots).
By no means would silence simply befall the entirety of Diagon Alley and its shops but Draco’s ears could hear nothing but just that. Maybe he was imagining it. The anxiety of stepping into the public, where anyone could curse him from any corner just for being who he was, settled over him like soundproofed walls. He could hear nothing except for the harsh thud of his heart against his rib cage. His line of vision suddenly turned black and he knew not where he was going. Somebody stumbled into him and their shoulders bumped painfully.
“Okay, okay, I get it. No need to elaborate,” Harry interjected and sighed. He closed his eyes before replying morosely, “That is not what he and I have. Hitting him is more of an instinct than a concocted play. It is more of a necessity than pleasure to me.”
“How’s the lady, Weasley?”Draco asked.
“Ah, it hurts!” Draco tried standing up but fell to his knees as the pain in his stomach intensified to unbearable levels. The last thought he had before succumbing to unconsciousness was that maybe, he had eaten too much and that it was killing him.
“I’ll give you ten minutes. Meet me downstairs,” she announced with an air of finality before leaving the room.
Like a reprimanded child, Harry squeezed Draco’s thigh in assurance before walking out the door and shutting it close behind him.
Draco brought his own tray of fruit and boiled eggs to the table and carefully sat down on the chair, hissing in pain as he did so.
"Get off me!" he pushed Ron away and stood up, dusting his backside.
It took a while for him to realize that she was telling the nurses about the Healer she saw during her pregnancy. If he remembered correctly, just this morning (or afternoon), she’d been to see her.
“Please sit and wait here. I’ll get you a potion which will help. Don't you worry, Mr. Potter. Mrs. Granger-Weasley's Healer will take care of her," she made sure Harry was comfortably seated on a waiting chair nearby before rushing into a room down the corridor.
"God, I'm sorry! Let's talk it out, Draco. Please wake up?" he implored like a pitiful child, all the while rubbing Draco's face clean with the hem of his robes.
“Please,” Harry focused his teary gaze on Hermione but his words were for both of his best friends.
"I think I'm going to ejaculate," Draco whispered and immediately, Harry pulled out his fingers.
“It hasn’t settled yet?” it was a half-question for which he received a glare from Draco as response.
LONG CHAPTER!!!
"Perfect," she beamed at him like a child before plating up his breakfast using her wand and settling it down neatly in front of him. "Eat. You look like you haven't eaten in days."
“Great! We’re working through the basics and I’ve been learning to control my temper tantrums.”
Draco didn’t flinch when Harry crept into the covers beside him and started applying Healing Salve on his bruises. His fists clenched the blanket tighter on his chest and he sighed at the mild relaxing burn as his pain dulled down.
“That’s okay. One step at a time. Let’s talk about Flying, shall we?”
All the loneliness and lack of conversation were taking a toll on him and he wanted to talk to someone though he felt like an idiot talking to himself or inanimate characters on the TV screen. There at least were no books in the damn house to pass the time. Oftentimes, it was just his mind yelling at him incessantly commanding him to end all his suffering. All he had to do was pick up a knife or his wand and slice that thin and pale skin on his wrist, a tad bit deeper than he usually did on his Mark. He was tempted to, as his eyes found the stack of cutting knives in the kitchen every single day, yet somehow, he willed himself to curb that bloody temptation until one day, the voice in his head just got louder by the second and he threw all the knives out of the living room window, uncaring of who they might stab. Luckily, there was only a vast field adjacent to their house and the knives he threw out sank into the wet muds of the field. The act felt liberating and the voice in his mind calmed down.
Before I come to you, I need to know if you remember too. I assume you do. I've hurt you too much for you to forget my presence in your life. 'Mione does. Ron does too. And I've always known Ginny suspects. She never asked me if it was you who I broke up with in order to be with her. But I think she knows. I know that my body heats up in pure ecstasy and anticipation just by your thought. I might also have mumbled your name in my sleep during the first year or two after our breakup. I made sure to send your things to you with the help of 'Mione just so Ginny could move in. I didn't want any trace of you around. But in my haste, I must have forgotten to send one of your Slytherin socks or scarves or a tiny blurry photo of you and I that I still keep hidden in a place nobody knows except me. So yeah, Ginny might have guessed. But she didn't confront me about you and I have no intention to willfully tell her about anything related to us. Those memories are mine alone. Ours to keep.
Harry let his magic flow carefully over the wounds he inflicted on Draco’s back and watched as they stopped bleeding. “I told you to leave them as is,” Draco gritted out weakly.
Feeling hopeless like I was fresh out of the war. The Auror training was not as easy as I expected it to be. There was no forgiveness from the superiors for the so-called saviour. I was a pawn. I had to train harder. Train better. And more. I had extra classes thrust onto me in the name of responsibility. I was taught about policies, economy, and a whole lot more just so I could be the Ministry's face. It was seventh year all over again when Scrimgeour tried to make me the face of his rule. I bent however they wanted me to. This way! No, Harry, that way! Come on, under here and stay on the frontlines only! Smile now and large, okay? Because that's how you ensured a safe world. The Hero had to work till his bones broke. And where was the much needed support from you? You were so swallowed with your grief that you failed to notice I was hurting badly. It was a miracle that I could even bring myself to visit you given that I was utterly exhausted because of my work. You didn't work as much as I did, did you? So you wouldn't know what it is to lose your time and identity to the expectations of the world surrounding you. There was no reprieve for me. I prayed for you to understand my position and share my pains. But all you ever did was complain and throw accusations that I was the one tearing us apart. I came back home knackered; I came back to you for a bit of support and warmth and what did you do? Picked fights with me! Thankfully, neither of us had been physically violent. Our fights had always been cruelly verbal. Had I known being alive would be this tough, I would have chosen to remain dead. But then, happiness came in the form of Ginny. She understood me more than you ever could. I would never in my life downplay the support you've given me right after the war but it didn't last. When I needed you the most, you were there only to abuse our relationship futher. Only to tell me what a git I was to leave you alone for days on end. Where had I been? What had I been doing? With whom had I been? Your questions were endless and accusatory. I could bear it no more.
“Draco? Please open your eyes,” why was Harry pleading? Why didn’t he strike yet?
Ginny seemed to be in thought with her furrowed brows and Draco didn’t interrupt her as he finished his coffee, picked up Ginny’s mug, and placed the two in the sink for washing them at a later time along with the day’s utensils. When he turned around, he flinched at Ginny’s closeness as she stood only a few inches away from him. He didn’t even hear her get up from her seat!
Draco assessed her calmly. From the looks of it, she didn’t seem to be joking at all. This was unexpected. Really, Draco would not have ever thought that he’d be sitting in Harry Potter’s home, speaking to the man's
“In this case, you’re wrong, Harry. You should’ve asked Draco, talked to him, and then you get to decide TOGETHER, as a family. You love him, don’t you?” her voice was motherly as she palmed away Harry’s tears gently.
"Well, you do too. Morning breath," Harry said and lay his head back down under Draco's chin and sighed contently. His palms traced Draco's back and his legs hooked around Draco's calves. "I could get used to this," Harry stated, not wanting to look at Draco and find rejection in his eyes.
“I can’t,” Harry agreed as he clenched his fists in utter disappointment at himself, his eyes never leaving Draco’s Dark Mark. He sat there taking in all of the faded scars and fresh cuts and burns on Draco’s hand and berated himself internally for being the cause of his husband’s pain.
He sounded petty but after not seeing the world and people for a long time, Draco felt apprehensive. And, he couldn't tolerate a herd of Weasleys when he couldn't even deal with one Ronald Weasley alone.
Madcheshirefox, Kikukaku - Allow me to *clink* glasses with you. To Draco.
diddleymaz -  Thank you! It was supposed to be a happy ending but I don't see happiness anywhere between the boys. Still, I will try my best.
"And I helped!" Arthur chimed in and Molly rolled her eyes.
Yet, deep down, he somehow knew that Harry would crash that building down until all that would ever be left behind for Draco was debris.
to work, you have to know that I cannot live the rest of my life fearing you,” Draco confessed. The truth in his words was a harsh slap to Harry’s heart. It hurt like Hell.
“Hi, Draco,” Granger greeted him hoarsely. After all these months of seeing her plump and full of life, she now seemed sunken. Extremely, at that.
Arya knew that the wheels in Harry’s mind had turned and it was a good sign. It wasn’t just the Healer who questioned their patients but after every session, there must be something that would provoke questions inside the person’s mind. The very same ones and they always started with why? And when one began to question oneself, the broken pieces of their soul – not just their minds, would automatically fit in their right places. They only need a push, in some cases, a hard shove.
“And I’ve chosen to sin further by taking you out on a date today. So, chop-chop!” Ginny’s playful tone washed over him abruptly and he blinked. They had been on a serious note, weren’t they? Her mood swings felt like whiplashes to Draco, only the sweeter kind. He bit his lip in thought. It had been so long since he went shopping and Ginny’s invitation enticed him. Now that he had his magic back, he could defend himself if anyone tried to hex him. Besides, Ginny would right by him and no one would dare get magical or physical on him. Curse words, probably he had to endure them as they were inevitable. Like a flash, an idea struck his mind.
Draco sighed and took the bouquet from Harry’s hands. The flowers smelled heavenly and it relaxed him to an extent.
“Funny you should ask that. Besides, why are you still here, Harry?” Draco’s voice broke a little at the end. The name which he had chanted in the throes of his ecstasy not moments ago seemed so hard to say with a clear conscience. It was beyond humiliating.
“I could’ve done it myself,” Draco grumbled as he followed Ginny out into the crowd.
“I CHOSE it, yes. But the Dark Lord did it,” he couldn’t look at Harry anymore and not cry in frustration. So, his gave his visual attention to a used towel dangling over the steel rack.
It hissed before settling down into a red cherry. He'd seen on TV enough times that he knew how to smoke theoretically. Using the knowledge, he held the fag between his index and middle fingers before pulling the smoke into his mouth, an action that filled his cavern with a tangy ashy taste. He pulled out the fag and concentrated on inhaling the smoke into his lungs. In doing so, his breath hitched and he felt his lungs recoil at the foul smoke entering them. Immediately, he started hacking and coughing, trying to dispel the vile rotten fumes.
"He's not waking up," Draco said, his hands trying to shake Harry to wakefulness yet again.
“Mate, I told you NOT to come. Why don’t you ever listen to me? No one listens to me! I should’ve sent Hermione to do this and stayed at home playing with my Baby Rose,” Ron groaned, dropping his head in his hands. This morning was way too hectic for the ginger-head to deal with two adults who behaved worse than toddlers.
"How are you, Draco?" she asked.
Draco could classify Harry’s moods into two specific categories – Balanced and Demented.
“Look where your so-called
“Just checking on you. Is everything all right, mate?” he asked, glancing furtively at Draco, who was looking out the window, completely ignoring their existence in the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco hadn't protested Harry's departure. Of course, he felt a bit bitter for driving out the man from his own room but a large part of him didn't want to be anywhere near the man who tried to assault him sexually. He couldn't sleep peacefully with Harry beside him; not after what had happened. That night, his dreams were filled with Harry chasing him with every intention of killing him and Draco woke up every five minutes trying to write off that image from his mind. In his dreams, on the nights after, Harry kept on chasing him with a knife in his hand but not his wand. If the dream Harry had a wand, he could've hit Draco with a Killing curse from any distance.
"This is your past. You can never erase it. But, your past DOES NOT define who you are now," she insisted in her now nasally tone.
Draco simply shrugged, tired of the conversation. He wanted Ronald to leave and not bother him.
Thank you dracoforever, CherylMercury, and Irisk for commenting your thoughts!
“What if you don’t? Just seconds ago, you were accusing me of killing your friends and family.”
“Draco, you can’t,” Harry had said, a painful reminder of what Draco lacked. Magic.
“Yes,” Harry’s voice faltered.
"What? Am I to believe that you didn't know what alcohol would do to the baby?”
“I was angry and I had no right to be, at least to your face,” Draco whispered urgently, willing for Harry’s fists to unclench sometime soon so that the fear of him getting punched amidst public would subside. He’d be saved of the humiliation as he wished to keep that aspect of their relationship inside the walls of their home.
No. They shouldn’t do that because if they did, Harry’s scornful voice would penetrate his mind again and this time, it’d make sure to destroy him. He didn’t want to be torn down to anymore pieces. “Please, no!” he chanted in a whisper.
"I will. Just not now. And I would appreciate it if you guys didn't visit him too," Harry shook his head when he saw that Hermione was about to protest his decision. "I want to be the one to face him and I want to show him that I'm getting better for him. And for myself," he explained, focusing especially on Hermione, who, by her expression, still thought it was a bad idea though Harry knew that she would respect his wishes nonetheless.
"Thank you," Draco smiled at Harry and this time, he remembered that he was the first one to move his head towards his husband and captured his lips in a warm embrace.
Harry tsked, knelt down and caught his husband by one of his feet and harshly dragged Draco towards him, making the blonde squeal in protest.
“I said NO!” Draco interjected loudly and a wave of magic hit Harry, forcing him to step away from the blonde. Draco’s magic.
Was sharper than a sword and left me bleeding on the ground.
“Gladly,” Harry banged the door shut behind his back.
A swarm of questions buzzed noisily in the back of his mind. Since when had Draco been hurting himself? What else had happened to Draco during his absence in their home? Was Draco taking any Potions that would harm him? A black cloud settled over Harry’s heart and he wanted nothing more than to take Draco to Arya for a much needed session. If left alone, Harry was sure that he would lose Draco for good.
After thinking for a minute, Harry said, “I don’t remember. I think it’s been a couple of years.”
'Shut up,' and those were the last words spoken that night.
Updates are coming! Thank you to all for your humble time and support.
He whirled around as tears seeped out of his eyes and exited the room. He couldn’t look at the man who put his child on the brink of death. Heck, he couldn’t even breathe the same air as him anymore!
Draco had never tasted soft drinks or any drinks of the Muggle world. He took liberty in adding a two-liter Coke to their basket.
“Bond in marriage doesn’t necessitate a change in your spouse’s surname. So, why do you think Draco changed his’?”
"It's Harry's birthday and we brought him a cake," Hermione said, ignoring her husband altogether.
"Ten seconds, Harry. Don't make me count them down," Draco's voice wouldn't stop quavering.
“Thank you,” he sniffled, “for making me realize that.”
Yet, looking to his side, there still remained a cold spot where Harry once used to be. “Do I?” he questioned himself contradictorily. Then his eyes found the empty birdcage nestled in a corner beside their wardrobes. “I think not,” he continued, rubbing his sore stomach gently but that didn’t help in curbing the agony in his heart.
Carefully, Harry crouched down in front of Malfoy and stroked his dirty pale cheek with his thumb, causing the man to flinch involuntarily and close his eyes tight. Azkaban does that to anyone. Fear; it becomes your blood. Pain; it becomes your sustenance. Until such a time where the prisoners would choose their inevitable death and welcome their end with widespread arms and a smile gracing their filthy faces.
“You wanted to talk and here I am,” Draco started in a low voice.
"Please, Harry," Draco cried futilely as another punch kissed his face without any mercy.
, supposed to make me feel any better?” Draco started to tear up at this point.
“If the orders aren’t from his Father, then yes,” Harry remarked, picking up a fistful of popcorn from the tub.
Draco cursed and tried to pull his hand back but Harry’s grip won over his own efforts to try and hide the Mark. He didn’t want Harry to spit on his failures again and trample over whatever was left of his heart and meagre life.
Thank you for leaving Kudos!
, when you had the chance; then why were you asking for my hand in marriage when clearly, you abhorred the very presence of me? After putting up with your tantrums for over a year, don’t I deserve to know why?” He didn’t know how or when but when he finished, both of them were standing facing other. While he was spitting fire, though not in the literal sense, Harry stood calm and composed. From panic attack to Azkaban, that was a steep curve their conversation had taken.
But he wasn't fast enough. The object didn't hit him, per se, because his half-formed spell deflected its trajectory minutely so that instead of it crashing on his head, the object hit his right upper arm and fell to the ground. Draco clutched his arm and whimpered in pain as he recognized the flying object to be the vase Ginny gifted to them for Christmas. The fear creeping inside him was maniacal once he realized WHY the vase, which was supposed to be in the living room, flew towards his head.
Along with Ginny, he even purchased a few items for himself from Madam Malkin’s. It had been a really awkward experience as he clearly remembered the day when he and his mother walked out of the place after insulting the shop and its owner. He was too young and despondent with the then-ongoing events in his life to contradict anything his mother had said. Then again, he would not have countered even if he was in his sane and serene mind for the love he harbored for his mother was far greater than anything else in this world. Thankfully, Madam Malkin had not explicitly said a thing to him when he entered her shop after approximately ten years. Her scornful yet passive face told him that she had not forgotten what happened but she wouldn’t confront him as that was what she hated the most. They dawdled around each other and getting his new robes sized to perfection was the most excruciating experience for the both of them. Later, he purchased lots of yummy treats and a new cage for Sebastian which had a swing and a wooden perch, unlike his previous cage which only had the latter. They also visited Quality Quidditch Supplies as Ginny required a new set of Quidditch gloves and a Broomstick Servicing Kit.
Though he didn’t mention it to Arya Reynolds, Harry knew that it’s been very long – more than a good five years since he’d flown. He was really out of practice and he wasn’t sure that he could do it again.
Draco sniggered. "I'll gift you a broomstick if I ever see you," he said to Dean though he knew that he would remain unheard.
I was really nervous while writing this chapter. I still don't know if I managed to capture everything and put it into words correctly. I really hope I did though! *Fingers crossed*
“Mr. Potter, are you alright?” a lady, another nurse, Harry presumed, asked him as she extended her hand to help him up.
~ Wheezy
A steep curve indeed!
“And waste all that bulk of yours? Do me a favor and shut up for a minute,” answered Draco without taking his eyes off the sky.
“You had the choice to keep it. Yet, look at what you did with it,” Harry debated.
“Is it bad?” Harry asked dumbly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This isn’t an assignment, Harry. I want you to know that,” she clarified.
his mind wouldn’t stop repeating that sentence nor would it stop throwing images of Draco, beaten and bloody, to his eyes.
Draco stooped his brisk walk and rounded on his husband, causing the latter to come to a halt mid-step. Clutching Harry by his collar, Draco pulled him close so that their faces were hairsbreadth apart.
It was like somebody suddenly shoved him into the ocean without giving him any time to prepare for the fall. Yet, somehow he knew how to swim with the current. When he answered, he just swam with the flow. There were no disguises or grappling for words for Flying to him was like breathing.
"Get lost, Malfoy," Harry slurred drowsily as he flopped onto the mattress beside Draco without even bothering to remove his clothes or shoes.
“What?” Harry asked.
"Who would've guessed I'd live to see the Weasleys celebrating Christmas with a Malfoy?" Draco questioned back, which earned another bout of laughter from the crowd.
“Rough day, Potter? Oh, wait! The day hasn’t even started yet!” Draco said mockingly, his sneer ever-present on his face. The butter knife he had in his hands before Harry attacked him clattered onto the floor loudly, much to Draco’s dislike. He would’ve liked it in his hands as a weapon if Potter got more violent.
"Don't," Draco said, shaking his head, his palms fisting the blanket covering him. Yet, the words he feared were spoken aloud by Harry.
“Well, thank you for the obvious interpretation, Potter,” Draco sniggered and thrust two open letters into Harry’s hands.
"He needs you, Harry. Please go and talk to him," Ron advised after a few seconds.
It’s been so damn long since Draco had sexual contact with himself, let alone others. Seven years in Azkaban didn’t give him a chance to think about sex, or relieving himself. It was all about surviving another day until the next came. Now, as Harry was touching him with that sensual look in his eyes, so soft and alluring, Draco’s sexual drive was back with full force but it left him confused. He was doubtful that if his consent in this was purely natural or forced upon externally. Draco was certain that his hatred for Harry Potter completely vanished and was now turning into something beautiful. Yet, he couldn't bring himself to accept the tingling sensation in his heart whenever Harry was near. And, somewhere in between, Harry guessed what Draco was thinking and pulled away. Tonight was not the night anymore.
Thank you so much for all the Kudos!
Draco shook his head in an attempt to push those miserable thoughts away but it seemed harder to do so as minutes passed.
"No one will judge you for this, Draco," Harry stated firmly and confidently, tracing Draco's mark with his index.
“I will wait. Until the day you come for me of your own accord, I will,” Harry said before walking away to their bedroom.
“Agh!” he cried when the back of his right palm stung. Slowly, brightness filled his vision until the blurred face in front of him grew clearer. Ginny’s worried face drifted in front of him and he looked around. They seemed to be in an empty alley. He looked down at his right hand which was being squished in Ginny’s hand and realized that she used a stinging hex on him to bring him back to reality from wherever he went.
Ron couldn't stay in the room any longer for the fear of hitting either Draco or Harry was growing in him steadily. He left the room, leaving the married men to decide whatever. Though he didn't support Harry's actions one bit, he also agreed with his wife's statement. The baby shouldn't be killed for Harry's mistake. It would just be another mistake. Then again, Draco couldn't be forced to feed the result of Harry's foolish and selfish actions.
“After all these years of hunting and killing, I still don’t know a simple Healing Charm except ‘Episkey’ and that one won’t heal your mangled face,” Harry said lowly.
“What?” Harry blanched.
“May we speak with Draco Malfoy, Mr. Potter?” a black-haired, pointy faced reporter queried.
Solitarysoul - That would probably end up with the death of Voldemort and Bellatrix once again given Harry's stronger and they're out of practice. Haha. Thank you for your compliment. I'm still trying to improve and hope you'll all guide me through it.
Draco’s words
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
“We’ll get there. And, to clarify, healing always starts here,” she said, stabbing her index at Harry’s heart. Somehow, these words calmed him down in an instant.
“Are you all right, Draco?” she asked with concern.
A minute passed before his ears caught on someone yelling his name from afar. Craning his neck towards his left, he saw Ron speed walk towards him from the series of Floo connections that were installed a couple of years ago.
Draco couldn’t grasp what was happening. Harry was admitting that he made mistakes. He was even acknowledging the Dark Mark tainting his skin like a blot of ink on a white sheet. He was whispering promises of their future and how better it could be. But, why? What was his purpose? After everything, could they even look at each other in the eye and not remember the filth that is their past? How could their future bloom when the seeds they sowed were already dead?
I hope all of you are safe in these tough times. I've only just got back to my family after a long struggle and being with loved ones is what we need when we're down. Please practice social distancing and continue to stay at home until the situation outside can be controlled. I pray that one day, we'll all be better and put the hard times behind us.
An hour later, he received an owl, a dark brown one, which dropped a heavy envelope filled with muggle bills, a pouch jingling with galleons, and a letter signed in Harry’s messy handwriting. Gulping, he first unfolded the letter which was tied securely inside the pouch of Galleons.
“Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds,” he said gratefully.
“Now, I won’t ask again. Say it,” Harry’s knuckles were tainted with Draco’s blood from a split lip.
“Not like me. I had to live and fight with the knowledge that sometime during the war, I must let Voldemort (‘Don’t say his name!’ Draco interjected but Harry continued) kill me. I walked to my death, Draco. So don’t you stand there and tell me that we had equal responsibilities then.”
When the boy stared at Draco yet again without getting to work, Ginny snapped her fingers in front of his face. “How much?” she asked, prompting Mister Cooper to punch their orders in.
It took a lot of effort for Harry to not collapse in front of Arya again but it had sort of been pointless as the sole existence of Mind Healers was to see you fall through trying to keep yourself together, see you cry and let go.
Physical abuse
Yet, he would still go on trying to find forgiveness wherever he could. And, he wasn't alone in his quest.
"Marry me, Malfoy," he announced and saw Draco's now wiry blonde eyebrows shoot upwards, his sneer momentarily forgotten by Harry's rather ridiculous, if not funny, proposal. "Or, get The Kiss. Like your parents did just last week. I suppose you know they've passed away."
Harry whispered a Lumos spell and Draco saw that his husband – wait, should he even call him that anymore? – was frowning at him rather hard.
“Will you get out or shall I?” Draco threatened.
"Incarcerous!" Harry whispered the incantation without his wand.
"Draco, dear, you're welcome here anytime. You can drop by for lunch or dinner any day, with or without Harry," Molly invited him.
"I see that your stay in Azkaban has not affected your attitude in any way, Malfoy. Twenty-five seconds," Harry commented and counted.
“Healer Eastoft is diagnosing Rose. She’ll be brought to us soon, love,” Ron said, still standing at the door and keeping an eye out for Molly, Draco supposed.
‘Healing Salve, I need to go and apply it on his wounds,’ Harry thought as he looked around for the tub of salve. He fumbled as he tried to get down the bed and fell to the floor. His knuckles hurt like hell and when he looked down to inspect them, he found blotches of dried blood.
LapislazuliStern - I cannot comment about the ending at this point but I hope my heart writes a better ending.
“What’s happening?” he asked when the dullness that was supposed to leave out the window at his recovery still persisted.
“Why didn’t you hit me back, Draco?” he asked the question he was dying to get an answer for.
“Wait,” Draco squeaked and Ron thought he would pass out because of the extreme sighing he’d been doing all day. Harry and Draco were going to be the death of him; he was positive. Silently, he prayed to Merlin, Morgana, or whoever listening to him to provide him the strength to knock sense into the two bubbleheads he was currently stuck with.
She closed the gap between them and pecked him on the cheek lightly before standing up and silently walking out, leaving him to process their interaction.
Harry didn't make any renovations and left it as is. When the winds picked up even slightly, a fair bit of light grey debris flew all around like pollen. The broken parts of his home reminded him of his childhood and all the years he'd spent running around the Manor and the garden. Leaning on the wall next to its magnificent gates, his hands shook as he opened the pack of Marlboro Lights. He put the fag in his mouth, pocketed the pack, and using the newly bought lighter, he lit the tip of the cigarette.
“What?” Harry’s head snapped up at once.
“Say the word, Malfoy,” Harry taunted as he turned towards Draco, setting the sweaters carefully on the tea table in front of the sofa. The latter gulped.
Do you remember?
His voice hissed inside the chambers of his mind and he shook his head in annoyance. He hated it with a passion whenever the voice returned. Most of the time, he tolerated it whenever it sounded like him but there were days when the voice took the form of Harry, breaking him into pieces he never knew he could become. Those days were horrible.
“This week, we’re going to the Weasleys’ Christmas dinner. It isn’t up for an argument, Draco. Got it?” Harry asked breathlessly. He wanted to get out of the house immediately as his heart felt laden with suffocation and sadness.
“Harry, get out,” she demanded and marched into the room, her red hair swishing behind her.
"No," Draco gritted out as he tried to remove Harry off his body in vain.
Ron calmed himself down as soon his friend woke up, not wanting to spoil the day for him by picking a fight with his unexpected husband. He clearly remembered having a mini heart attack when he read the big bold letters printed on the first page of the Daily Prophet - "The Boy Who Lived ties the knot with a Death Eater!" A huge moving picture of Harry and Malfoy, holding hands and walking away towards the nearest apparition point was printed under it. Ronald had to refrain himself from confronting Harry as Hermione told him it wasn't their place to decide who Harry chose for himself in his life. They had to accept Harry's decisions and not question them. If Harry wanted to give an explanation, he would and they had to wait until then. His wife was the only one holding him back from drowning Harry in his sea of questions and doubts. Plastering a genuine smile on his face, Ron nodded at Harry before the pair wished him - "Harry birthday, Harry!" joyously.
He composes himself again a moment later. Ron's hand is rubbing up and down his back.
4) There was no such medimagical history that would have the candidate(s) particularly high-risk/susceptible to complications.
Draco looks down. He traces a foggy fingerprint on the top of the desk, watching idly. "He cares for everyone. Even those he has no reason to care for." He supposes pity is the better word when it comes to what Potter feels for him, but saying this might tell her more than he'd like for her to know.
