Potter looks at him curiously. His hair is light again, and his features obscured, turned into the fictional Dudley. Draco finds it unsettling, suddenly— speaking to Potter when he doesn’t
Draco sucks his top lip in, holds it between his teeth. He wonders if Blaise would be more careful, if he could go back. If he knew then what he knows now. Draco wonders if that’s why some wizards were so adamantly against divination. If we all knew every bad end, would we ever take any chances at all?
“Pawn to C2,” called Ron, wandering into view behind Hermione.
“Of course,” Harry agrees quickly.
Ron shook his head. “Dead or alive, an eternal pain in the arse.”
“Yeah. The Ministry must be in a right fix right now.”
“My galleons are definitely on Warrington. He’s definitely got strategy on the brain.”
“You weren’t wrong, though,” he says carefully. “About any of it, except maybe some people’s intentions.”
“You were going to buy all new furniture because yours was a little too large?” says Potter beside him.
“Stop mothering me. You are so bossy.” His tone lacks all bite, and Granger smiles at him. She's been extra annoying since he sat her down and apologized for the things he'd done at Hogwarts. For the things he hadn't done that day at the Manor. “I’ll be fine,” he assures her.
Joy is powerful.
Potter runs his hand through his hair, pale brown now, above a face that isn’t his and that Draco grows more uncomfortable seeing every day, for some reason. “This is good,” he says, and finishes removing his sweater. His long-sleeved shirt underneath sticks in damp patches to his abdomen, and Draco looks away. “But we need something more concrete if we’re going to bring him in.”
“But you showed me what it looks like to lead people well, Draco,” he continues. “You showed me why it matters.”
“And now?”
Draco tries to pull away, but Potter holds on tight to his hand. He traces over the mark with his index finger, gentle loops over and over, and the skin starts to tingle underneath his touch. It’s like Potter’s finger has a tiny flame, etching some strange magic into his skin. After a moment, Potter stops, and Draco can see the letters glowing there, right over top of the old mark.
“That was a glass. My glass. In my sink.”
“Hey,” says Harry. “It’s ok. I want you to rely on me. Really. I want everyone I love to rely on me, just like I rely on them. Just not the whole world. And I’ll still see you. Every day, if you like.”
“Of course I’ll agree. I’ll have to get approval from Salazar, but that’s mostly formality. We can’t afford a war right now, and this allows him to save face as well.”
“Don’t you forget it,” Draco murmurs.
Harry draws back slowly and he’s looking at Draco strangely. Draco isn’t sure why until Harry takes one of Draco’s hands—hovering, fingers outstretched, down by his left hip—and then the other—clenched ineffectually around Harry’s belt—and moves them up between their bodies. Harry puts one of Draco’s hands against his throat. “I’m vulnerable here”—he moves Draco’s other hand until his palm rests just against Harry’s nose—“and here.”
“Aren’t I?”
“What the hell are we waiting for then?” Harry asks, and Draco grins.
“He could, I think,” Draco says. “He didn’t betray us. He just—had reason to leave, I suppose.”
He pushes his hips back, anyway. He pushes into Potter’s cock so there can be no doubt; he feels it. He
“You’re wanted up in the main office.”
Draco is filled with the sense of time running out. His time, here in his home. Regulus will stay here, in charge of the Malfoy soldiers and the defense of the castle. He’s been Draco’s only real companion for so long, taught Draco everything he knows about leading people, about taking care of them.
Harry pulls the finished knot upwards, tighter until it nestles at the base of his throat like a reminder. He can feel his breath, in and then out, against its pressure. He watches backward in the mirror, straightening the already perfect knot of the necktie. Malfoy split three ways, three slightly different angles in each fracture of glass. Each piece of him reined, leashed. He waits until all three Malfoys look up and stare back at him in the panes of glass.
If Malfoy notices Harry's distraction, he gives no indication, and the secret smile is once again curled on the edge of his mouth.
Draco opens his mouth, then closes it. On a bench beside his bed is a marble chess set. He reaches over and grabs a handful of the pieces.
“Sorry to disappoint, Auror Potter. I’m sure I can make it up to you, if you’re lacking for excitement.”
Potter lets out a long breath, as if he’d been holding it this entire conversation. Draco waits for the explosion, but it never comes. “Well,” says Potter. “What could possibly go wrong?”
"I—erm. Well."
He decides that a blazing row and duel would be a welcome diversion from this.
And Harry smiled, like it was just a joke. Because it was.
It’s just that Granger comes loaded with a lot of baggage he’d rather forget, and doesn’t know quite how to deal with now. He’s apologized to a few people, since the war, with varying degrees of reception, but he’s never been able to bring himself to apologize to her. To bring up the time he’d watched her screaming and bleeding on the floor of his drawing room. She’s warmed to him, over the years they’ve worked together, from painful politeness to cautious friendliness.
Potter rubbed the back of his hand against his chin. The slight abrasions on Draco’s neck from that stubble flared at the sound, and with it, impossibly, his pulse.
“I know what you mean,” says Harry. “It was kind of like that for me and Ginny. Hermione says it’s a fifty-fifty when your kids are all off and it’s only the two of you left. Finding each other just between the two of you, and whether there’s enough left to keep it going the next half of your life.”
he thinks, when they’re lying under his blankets later. Draco messy-haired on his pillow, his lashes fluttering softly as he tries to stay awake. Harry presses his mouth to Draco’s shoulder, and watches the smile tug at the lips across from him. And he thinks:
Draco goes harder. Faster. There is nothing else but his body sliding over and inside Potter’s body, nothing but the breaths they take and the sounds filling the room. There is nothing but him, and Potter. Nothing but them and this moment, right now.
Dean shrugs, and then carefully dabs a bit of green paint onto the canvas with his brush. “Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t blame you. All I’m saying is maybe it’s harder to apologize to them because you feel more responsible for the things you’re sorry about.”
Potter looks at him. “Are you sure?”
He drinks heavily. Sometimes Potter— Sayre— scowls at him from across the room, where Goyle of all people is talking his ear off. Draco doesn’t care, or maybe he can’t care. What does Potter know? How can he understand? This is how he stays rooted to the floor; how he doesn’t leap to his feet and run wildly, loudly from the room.
going again. Here, Floo’s this way.”
“It’s good,” grunts Weasley, stuffing his face. That hasn’t changed since Hogwarts, apparently.
“It’s nearly lunch time,” Hermione insisted. “You never have this long of a lie-in.”
He smiled at the scathing look that earned him and bent down to finish writing his portion of their statement. They’d only been partnered for a few months, but Harry thought it was going pretty well. Surprisingly well, actually. They’d just wrapped up a long investigation and busted up an illegal hippogriff fighting ring. It had been an ugly fight in freezing rain and muck, but they’d caught every suspect involved. Not exactly how Harry had envisioned spending a happy Christmas Day, but he found now that he didn’t mind at all.
There was a woman playing gobstones on the other end of the terrace with her son. He’d met them yesterday in the library when she’d introduced herself as Madam Flint. Her son had been reading a book on dragons. “Can you believe he’s reading that?” she’d said to him with a grin. “And he’s only four!”
“I’ve been scarred one too many times by walking into a room too quickly.” Potter shrugs. “It’s your fault, not mine.”
“And you—
"Dunno if I'm supposed to tell you this, but you guys are the best Special Team the Aurors have got," Neville told them at one meet-up. "Wish I'd been better in the field."
Six months had turned the world frozen and then melted it into a soft greenness again. Grimmauld Place was shining softly in the late-spring sunlight, scrubbed and polished over the last few weeks. Harry had even bought a new rug for the parlour, though he moved the old one into the kitchen. The cocoa stain had never quite come out. Ron and Hermione had been over last night for the first time since the pandemic. Six doses, once a week, of the new Magical Preservation Potion and people could go out again. Tentatively, joyfully, they gathered.
When they land a few seconds later, Draco takes a quick, involuntary step back. Everything is smoke and ash, screams and blaring confusion. The building in front of them is
“They weren’t expecting anyone,” says Kingsley.
“Oh, yes,” Molly said. “Muggles have the same tradition, or they used to, anyway, but bees really do understand us. And we can understand them. Some have more of the touch than others.” Molly had looked at him. “You should try, Harry. You can talk to snakes, after all.”
The door creaks as it swings open. “Lumos,” he says, and feels Potter walk in behind him. He shuts the door after himself.
The thing is, there is never a time when Harry doesn’t want Draco. He
“Remember when you walked over to the kitchen window with that great, long beard of bees and the kids went crazy?” Ginny asks.
“I don’t want to be Draco Malfoy, Weasley. Haven’t you ever wanted to be someone else, someone other than yourself?”
“Pansy,” says Potter now, rubbing her hand between his and leaning toward her. “We’ll take you somewhere safe. I promise you. I’ll take you there myself.”
"Mm. Antonin once mentioned a maternal grandmother near Ostrava."
Draco swallows, hard, but it’s Potter who answers.
“Yes, well my boyfriend would prefer a more comfortable experience, and I really—“
“Draco.” His mother is standing in front of him. “How much have you had to drink?” Her voice is cool and calm and he focuses on it.
Harry nods. “Neville was telling us about her lavender and snap dragons awhile back. Impressive new strains, he said.”
“We should get together again sometime,” he says, before he can talk himself out of it. “Catch up.”
While he was wondering, Malfoy looked over at him. He raised his eyebrows and Harry flushed, caught. He cleared his throat and looked back down at the crumbled remains of his scone.
“Do you know,” Pansy says shakily, “I don’t think I actually want to marry anyone.”
“Aw, Hermione,” said Ron. “She’s too young to understand, anyway.”
“Put your Harry on the castle guard, then,” he says. “We’ll see how he goes."
Potter sees him right before they’re about to experience a collision, stopping so suddenly his glasses slip down nose. He catches them, pushes them back up. “Sorry,” he says, in a way that sounds automatic, then he blinks, squints as though maybe his eyesight can’t be trusted. “Malfoy?”
He hears her scoff from all the way down the hallway, and smiles to himself. Pansy’s place is small— by any standards they’d grown up with, anyway— but the living room is big and open, with windows looking out over Regents Park. He looks down at it for a few minutes, as the street lamps blink on and people start to hurry to their dinners and evening plans. It’s hinting at rain outside, and he can’t stop thinking about that time Potter met him outside the Covent Garden tube station, even though he’d had no reason to.
“Yes,” Draco says. He watches the way the sun stains the sky orange even as it sinks. “Tell the gatemen they can raise the bridge.”
“I’m so glad you two are here today,” Pansy had confided, ignoring the fact that she’d ordered Draco to arrive this afternoon. “Cassius won’t be back until late tonight, so otherwise I wouldn’t have anyone to keep me company besides his stuffy relatives.”
“I’m sure. And I think he’s done some other dirty work for some bad people as well. In London.”
"Why?" Snape drags the syllable out.
He breathes in the smell when she sets his cup in front of him— lemon balm and a complex crush of herbs— and watches as Carys takes a sip.
He looks where she’s pointing, away from the beach. Dunes rolling up and into the distance with nothing else in sight. “What are we looking for? How far is it?”
“It’s not— it isn’t
This year, he’d come prepared. Roast turkey and potatoes, fat buttery carrots, Yorkshire puddings, and an enormous slice of Mrs. Weasley’s Spiced Rum cake. He pulled out a flask of butterbeer he’d brought to wash it down and looked at the new picture framed on his desk: Hermione, Ron, and an hours-old Rose. It was sort of funny, how much difference context could make. He’d been happy to take Christmas duty this year when Ron had pulled it, telling him to spend the day with his new daughter, and he was happy still.
All the ordinary forms of magic.
"Oh, good morning, Harry," she says as he tries to pull the sheet up higher. "I brought breakfast. How was your evening with Draco?"
“I think I’ve acquired five hives,” he told them, a little sheepishly, when he went back inside.
Harry had looked at Neville's open, bashful, brave face and readied what he wanted to say. Things like
“She’s in Italy. Moved there as soon as Voldemort returned, and never came back. She’s never coming back, I don’t think. No, it was someone else, someone very important to him.” Draco looks up at Potter now, and meets his eyes. “But it isn’t my story to tell. You understand?”
Potter is still rolling his hips into Draco as they kiss. The whole cabinet is warm and humid now; it feels foggy and encompassing, but Draco doesn’t feel claustrophobic. Not at all. He could stay in this heated unreality forever. He pulls Potter’s bottom lip into his mouth and sucks on it, careful to be quiet. Potter’s hip thrust forward, hard, and he grabs at the waistband of Draco’s trousers.
Granger sniffs. “I think it’d be a sympathetic cause to most of wizarding Britain, if it weren’t for the violence breaking out.”
Draco ignores it. “Where was Iwan?”
“I need to ask a favour,” Draco says. It sounds like something he’s worked at, something he pulled painfully through his teeth. It is.
Mid-afternoon: sunlit-steeped, entire body warm and thrumming along with the world.
“It’s ok,” Potter says. “It’s no secret.” He turns his head toward Draco. “I’m having trouble at work, that’s all. Just been a long couple of months. No time for balanced meals.”
"Oh, I wouldn't say that, Harry. I always find your aphorisms worthwhile."
“Weasley,” says Draco, “This is Sayre, my partner today. Mind taking him round to Rhees to check in? I’ve got to go ask some questions down at the lighthouse.”
Draco isn’t sure what to say. He reaches inside his jacket and pulls out an ink pen, holding it out toward Potter, who stares at it. Then he takes it from Draco’s hand and scribbles something on the parchment.
Blaise hums, and Draco can see he’s lost already in his head, in stories he can never know about people he’s never met. On his best days, Draco thinks it’s all Blaise can handle right now— to be involved obliquely, in the small moments of people who are, for all intents and purposes, fictive. On bad days, he thinks it might be as far as Blaise is able to care about anyone, or anything, anymore.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t really understand this whole mania anyway. Why—“
Most the guests are out doing various planned activities, and the rooms are empty and quiet. He’s just thinking about heading upstairs to see if he can spot Potter and the other riders from an upper window when he hears a scuffle and whispers from the back stairwell behind the kitchens.
Draco has a lot of practice at shoving unwelcome feelings aside.
“Yeah,” says Goyle, and Draco closes his eyes, even though it’s pitch black inside the cabinet. He leans his ear carefully against the door. “Pansy’s taking her out to look at your pregnant hippogriff. She’ll be ages. She loves those beasts.”
“Mam’s in the kitchen,” she says. There’s a thick gap between her front teeth and a spray of freckles across the bridge of her nose. Her thick, dark hair is plaited down both sides of her head. “Through there.”
Draco swallows his protests. They’ll do no good, he knows. “And no news of the lost prince?”
Now it’s Draco’s turn to laugh.
“Vodka?” he asked, as he slid onto the stool beside him. Malfoy glanced over quickly, then back again, a perfect double take.
They stand in silence for a moment, and then start speaking again at the same time.
Perhaps especially to himself.
“Wait,” he says. “We should talk about this. The details, what it means.”
“I’m good at my job, Malfoy.” Potter is very quiet, and very serious.
Draco looks. The yard is empty.
It takes a long moment for Potter to turn around and look at him. There’s a sinking feeling inside his chest, at the thought of Potter
“What? But—that doesn’t make sense, Hermione. How can Malfoy be alive and be a ghost?”
“To look.” Harry hooks his feet around Draco’s calves before he can push away entirely. It’s very quiet; there’s nothing but darkness out the window and no one but themselves here in Draco’s room.
, and then someone conjured up some floating fairy lights, and everyone kept on dancing anyway. The back wall had been taken out by a Death Eater spell back in the war and never fixed, so half the place was open to the night, to the air blowing cool off the Vistula River down the hill and a couple blocks away. A few of the fairy lights bobbed and eddied their way over to the empty space and floated gently away into the night.
“The elves will know. They always know that sort of thing. They might tell Warrington, or they might not. It depends on how nosy he is.”
He definitely hasn’t missed what a minefield these things can be.
Potter had slumped down onto the floor with him and, still panting and trembling, tugged at the buttons on Draco’s trousers until they gave way and he’d wrapped a hot hand around Draco’s painfully hard cock and he’d
Harry turns back to Blaise. “Would that have been a problem?” he asks.
Sometimes Harry dreams of the forest. Of moss soft and slick under his fingertips and the smell of pine, the chilled air lying crisp and sharp across his tongue. He is never afraid in the forest. In the forest, he can feel the movement of his own blood through his body, to every extremity and all the bits of him in between. He is aware of his lungs expanding and contracting inside his chest, that magical exchange of air pulled in and out of himself, the bellows of his voice and the taste of the world all around him.
Draco holds Warrington’s gaze. “Of course. It’s—
“It’s funny,” Granger says, after a silent moment. “My mum had a tea cosy. When I found out I was a witch, though, and started learning about spells and went to Hogwarts, I was so taken with charms like Stay-Hot. It’s never occurred to me to appreciate a tea cosy.”
"Neville is coming tomorrow," Luna says from the sofa behind them.
Riding—the Hogwarts Express, a broom, a Thestral, a Hippogriff.
When the ghost of Draco Malfoy showed up, he just…
“That’s a good point,” Harry agreed. “So…you decided to come here?”
The name is his name, and the bed is ready for Draco Malfoy on the day he isn’t quick enough. The day a bad man or woman beats him. And Draco is waiting for that day like the bed waits for him. There are waiting beds for every Hit Wizard, and they’re all watching for that particular bad man who will put them in the empty bed, or worse.
They never eat in the dining room anymore. There are many rooms they do not enter. Since Lucius’s death, his mother has been going almost non-stop, from one commitment to another. Draco wonders what would happen if she paused.
“Am I?” Draco wasn’t looking at Harry anymore. He was staring at a stripe of moonlight cutting through the dark air.
“I did not—“
“Missus is having her tea right now with Lady Greengrass. We was not expecting you, sir.”
Blaise stares at him. “You’re mental. You do know that, don’t you, Potter? As your estate agent and, more importantly, as your friend, I feel like I need to make sure you know that.”
?” Ron had asked him, late at night in the tiny kitchen of his temporary walk-up. It was one of those evenings between Christmas and New Year, that strange, elastic time in between reality. He’d always loved those days back in Godric’s Hollow, when the kids were small. This year, it felt colder and rather empty.
Man-Bun hands them a new brochure with their receipt.
“That’s got nothing to do—“ Weasley is getting red in the face. “This is about trust, Malfoy, not that you—“
He feels Harry’s hand on his elbow just as Granger disappears into the kitchen, and he turns to find him smiling, that secret, quiet little smile that only Draco receives.
Granger finds him in the blast zone, looking around the rubble for anything that might provide some answers. “Go home, Malfoy,” she says tiredly. “You’ve been here all day.”
“Relationships do not alarm me.” He pushes his tumbler back and forth, one hand to the other. “This is just— you are completely off base, Pansy.”
Harry laughed. It felt wonderful—like a light coming on in a dark room. “I’m always much wittier in the conversations I have in my head.”
He shut his eyes. He leaned in. And when he opened them again, they were so close to each other. So close, and Malfoy’s breath brushed like a damp fog against his face. The way Malfoy was leaning, legs bent and back flat against the bricks, made them nearly the same height. Made it easy, so easy, to lean in just a little bit further, and slide his lips across Malfoy’s.
Blaise is scrolling down an Ebay page on his lap computer, feet up on the big oak desk that takes up most of the wall where the bank of windows are— windows that remain closed, curtains and shutters drawn. He’s still the only wizard that Draco knows who uses a computer, or the small rectangles that work like a Floo call. He looks up at the sound of Draco’s knuckles rapping against the doorframe and waves him in.
As soon as he passes through the wards on the front gate, the air turns from the cool, crisp Cotswolds afternoon to the warm, sun-washed sigh of the Mediterranean. Guido, the only Zabini house elf left, answers Draco’s knock in his usual black tie. His only concession to the way things have changed is the lack of a jacket and shirtsleeves rolled midway up his arms— an unheard of informality in the old days.
Draco finds his voice. “I look forward to your reign.”
“We don’t have any other real leads,” she tells them. “So let’s hope this proves useful.”
“Half a dozen. Probably one more by summer.”
“I’ve blocked you out for tomorrow, too,” Robards says with a little smile, and leaves before Draco can lodge any more complaints.
Draco pauses in the doorway. “Send Pansy an owl, would you? Just a few lines. Anything.”
“Nice mattress,” he comments inanely. “Better than your sofa.”
“Don’t need to. The bones are good. The garden is good. Everything else is fixable.”
“Harry Potter, on the bottom?”
“Oh,” says Harry. “Well, that’s alright then.” And Draco laughs just a little, and Harry leans up to kiss him.
On the fifth night, a light goes on in the kitchens. Luna's beetles pick up the faint murmuring of a man talking through the Floo. She sends word to Neville to trace the call, and they wait. When dawn breaks in streaks of pink and lilac across the sky, the light goes out and the house goes silent. They leave some bugs and place an alarm spell around the perimeter, and they return to their hotel for a few hours' sleep.
Millicent leans over toward him. “My husband seems to like your boyfriend,” she says. “Normally can’t get much out of him at these things.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I do.”
“I have my own garden,” he’d told his mother when she came by yesterday, and smothered a smile as she blinked and tried not to cringe at the sight. The Malfoy gardens were sprawling, manicured blankets of flowers and combed lawns.
The dragon’s scales are shining like gems under the winter sun, and Draco turns his head toward Potter. “Do you remember that radio program we listened to at Christmas?” he asks him.
Not quite alone. He’d almost forgotten his partner in depression. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy had drawn this duty because he was still the newest Auror on staff or because Robards didn’t like him. Just plain bad luck, maybe. When he finished coughing, Malfoy’s pale face was flushed a deep pink, and he grabbed his wand from the top of his desk, waving it at the water cooler on the other side of the room. A goblet filled itself and floated over to him. Harry watched him as he drank the entire thing, then wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand. Malfoy had kept his head down the past year; not particularly friendly but not overtly hostile, either. Mostly, everyone had relaxed around him.
“Sunday again. I’ll have an actual dinner,” Potter says over the rising roar of the fire.
“And distrust of the Muggle world is exactly what the Traditional Wizarding Order wants,” adds Granger. “So we need to know what else they’re up to— who their real leaders are.”
He can feel Potter watching him as he pulls down the Ogden’s and pours himself a small amount. The first swallow burns going down and he welcomes it. He wishes he were alone. He wishes his furniture was still shrunk in the corner, the living room empty. He would like to lie on the bare floor for awhile, with the Floo cut off, and revel in the now-fleeting feeling that no one could find him unless he wished it.
Draco raises one blonde eyebrow. “What have I ever said or done to make you think I might enjoy ‘
“Draco,” Harry breathes. Draco hears him cross the room and come close. “Yes.
Blaise is resting his chin in one hand, looking back and forth between them. “Listen to your mates, Draco,” he adds, and drains the rest of his drink.
Hermione frowned. “You look awful.”
Blaise spreads his hands out, smirking, as if he’s just been given a gift.
“Ginny and I are taking a break,” said Harry. “She’s got her quidditch schedule, touring all over the world, and I’m always at work late because I’m on the bottom of the pile.”
He walks around London for awhile as the sun comes up. He had been pleasantly surprised by Muggle London, when he first ventured out into it. It was nice, to be a small speck in a large sea of people. Draco felt like he could breathe. Like he could dissolve and then pull himself back together later, better than he’d been before. He tries to do it often these days.
“There’s nothing there,” Potter says. “Draco, there is nothing out there.”
,” Harry yelped, and sent his mug of cocoa spilling onto the rug. His heart staggered around in his chest.
“What are you
“It’s not a party,” Pansy says, with a curl of her lips. “It’s Cassius, and a few of his cronies. He’s smart, and he knows what people like our parents want to hear. He knows what makes them feel afraid. I think he’s probably been studying them all his life, resenting all that old influence that his family’s money couldn’t quite buy.”
They’d offered special treatments, Draco learned, after Potter was back in his flat and Draco was bringing take out by every evening, just because he was bored, of course; things had been dull at the Hit Wizard department the last week. They’d offered scar removal, but Potter had waved it off.
“Mrs. Potter?” Harry asks. “You mean Ginny? We’re separated. It hasn’t been in the papers because the divorce isn’t final yet, but that will happen soon and then it’ll be everywhere.”
Malfoy seemed to only grow angrier, if it were possible. He’d completely abandoned looking through the cubbies. “What do you think I mean?” He stabbed a hand toward Harry’s left arm, folded at a ninety degree angle across his body and held there by the sling. “You should never have dropped your shield while that wizard was still holding a wand. Of all the—“
Draco shrugs, but Regulus doesn’t see it. He’s still gazing out the window. Draco has maps of the capital, and the forest and all his lands. He has the most recent scout reports. He has a lot of things, but he can’t manage to feel the same urgency he once did. Regulus is looking out over the castle and its people but Draco can only see time stretching out endless and lonely in front of him.
“No, Potter, that’s a former Death Eater.”
Harry decides that it began at that nightclub in Warsaw. The power had failed again across the entire block, but there were wands and maybe a hundred people saying
Malfoy looked so startled. He wasn’t sure if it was what he’d just said, or the fact that he’d said it to Malfoy. After all, they’d never been friends. But the thing was, Harry couldn’t say that to any of his friends. They cared too much; they’d only argue and get worried. And it felt so good, just getting that out into the air.
“Finally?”
The day Harry turns in his resignation, he sends Draco an owl. Now that the garden is finished, he doesn't have an excuse to get Draco to linger, drinking tea and playing that old game of who’s doing what, just like they’d done before. He hasn’t wanted to rush anything, or read Draco’s interest the wrong way, but there have been moments when he feels sure that he’s not the only one who
The next day he goes straight up to the sixth floor to arrange for another Portkey to Ynys Llanddwyn, and so he’s already in the Department of Magical Transport when the first alarm goes off. The witch behind the Portkey desk immediately turns to the big map on the wall behind her, winking and sprawling in magical, living lines across the entire back wall. She touches her finger to the suddenly glowing spot somewhere in London, and the red dot seems to pulse forward, the area around it enlarging into a bubble that now shows street names, buildings, precise latitude and longitude. A loud, relentless ringing is filling up the room, and all the halls of the top levels of the Ministry.
“Lily gave that to me, actually,” she says, her voice very quiet and her eyes far away. “Harry’s mother. My sister.”
“Yeah, that’s what I thought, too. But then I remembered that we’re in the middle of a mysterious pandemic that’s draining the wizarding world of its magic, and Malfoy is in Azkaban, and…”
“Harry.” Draco sneers. “Has he given another name yet?”
Draco holds tight to the little slip of paper in his hand, scanning the row of houses in front of him. He looks down at the address there again, in Granger’s neat, precise handwriting, and he mouths it aloud to himself, like a mantra.
“And how does power work?”
She’s waiting for him in the atrium today, a round, brass globe in hand. Ministry-issue Portkeys are usually reserved for travel outside England, so the first thing he says is, “Where are we going?”
“Is it that obvious?”
“Why on earth do you suppose I’m interested in you doing any thinking? That is not your purpose. I assure you, I’ve got it well in hand.”
anywhere, but—”
“Never really wanted to.”
“I do.” Granger is calm, but firm. She’s got her boss face on. “Malfoy assists me in a lot of work, and has for awhile now. Years, in fact. I request him specifically. Are you questioning my judgement?”
“Are you alright?” Malfoy looked up from the spoon he’d been trying to pick up from the table. Harry had been watching him for awhile now. “I mean, in Azkaban. Are you really ok?”
everything. Post-war, post-Voldemort. Post-childhood. Harry recognized that the curiosity was different now than it had been. Before, it had been red and smoking and sure of finding the bad. Now it was a gentler feeling; an openness to finding things that had nothing to do with confirming or disproving any suspicions. Like the echoes of an old obsession, with all the animosity drained out.
Listening to Malfoy complain about the copyeditors at the
“What?” Draco is a mess of confusion and helpless, involuntary need.
“McLaggen is an imbecile,” Pansy says harshly. “He loves the attention and he’s easy to manipulate. He’s just a puppet for Cassius. But he was here last night, and every time he comes in a panic something bad happens.”
Draco drags his hand through his hair. “Against the future? I don’t know, Granger, that’s—“
There was a very thick silence, and then Hermione took off her glasses. She rubbed very delicately at the bridge of her nose with one finger, and then she put her glasses back on. “Ghosts haunt places, not people.”
He knew the moment she recognized him; it was an expression and surprise he was uneasily getting used to. She looked swiftly between him, still frozen just inside the door, and Malfoy, who lowered his cup and set it down on the table behind him. It rattled in its saucer.
“A drink would be nice,” he says, before he can convince himself it’s a bad idea. Potter hands him a heavy-bottomed tumbler and a bottle of Ogdens. He pours a few fingers, and then follows Potter out the door he hadn’t really noticed in the kitchen’s far corner.
“Mr. Potter,” she says. She’s all winter today; snow and ice. Harry sighs.
“I don’t trust him yet,” Draco says. “But I do trust you. Whatever you want, Regulus.”
“Potter,” he says. He’s older, of course. His limbs have a new weight to them, his eyes more shadows and lines. But he sounds the same. Precise and sharp-edged.
Draco scowls, but does the same. With enough alcohol, perhaps even the most stubborn of problems will go away, at least for the night.
Potter nods. “Do my hair?” he asks, and Draco goes to him, mouth twitching into a small smile. “After breakfast,” Potter says. “We can get her alone after breakfast.”
“Every kingdom eventually comes to an end,” he says, and if Regulus replies, Draco isn’t listening.
“I know you’re here and also in Azkaban,” Harry said. “I know this is you, without your body. Hermione did some research.”
“But.” A pause of a heartbeat. “Foxglove treats atrial fibrillation by slowing the heart, which is why it is also one of the first choices a witch or wizard turns to when they wish to stop one altogether. So unless they found the potion he was using, it’s impossible to determine if it was intended to help him or kill him.”
The ghost of Draco Malfoy made a sniffing sound that Harry interpreted as disdain.
There’s a hand between his shoulder blades, and another on his shoulder, and they propel him forward, out of the kitchen and down the short hallway to his bedroom. As Draco falls onto his mattress, a small part of him knows Harry Potter is putting him to bed, but he shoves it aside.
“Yes.”
“My, we
Harry smiles at the chipped and faded window boxes, and the crooked green door in need of a fresh coat of paint. “Your roots are showing, Zabini.”
Draco knows. “Why did you invite me over, that first time?” He’s been wanting to ask. Now feels like the right time. “Why not just tell me yes or no?”
“Good,” she says. “With confessions from McLaggen and Tom Evers, and with Pansy’s statement, we’ve got a very tight case. I’m expecting convictions for both, and the full sentencing, at least for Warrington.”
“Ah,” Dumbledore’s portrait said, giving up its pretense of privacy. “My dear boy, that is the best beginning of all.”
Potter shakes his head. “It’s fascinating, really, the magic rich people don’t pay any attention to. I know them. Come on, put them back and I’ll show you.”
“Draco,” he says smoothly. “Would you come show Avery our collection from Alexandria?”
“Your disinterest in your appearance has always been quite evident, Potter,” Draco had said. He was eating a Massaman curry, his favorite, but for some reason that evening it had tasted like ashes in his mouth. “Anyone who has witnessed your personal grooming habits over any amount of time can attest to that.”
In the end, there’s only one thing Draco knows for sure: this new world had no place for Lucius Malfoy in it, and Lucius had neither the experience nor the will to adapt within it. Anything after that, whether it was his heart or his own hand that killed him in the end, was simply a question of dosage.
It’s everything Harry had hoped for, everything he’d seen as possible when he’d stood there looking at the mess of weeds and brambles and potential.
Harry throws a bit of flour at him, and Draco blinks in surprise when it flies all over his face and chest. “I love
“Didn’t they tell you during your training that it’s dangerous to bait crazy Death Eaters?” he says as he and Potter meet over the body.
“None taken,” Draco says. “Why’s she listed it, if she still likes it?”
so small, Potter,” he kept saying, in different iterations. “Look, your flat is five paces long. And… three and half paces wide. It’s astonishing.”
“Is losing its magic.” Malfoy finished. He looked away.
With his good arm, he reached across the space dividing them and put his hand against Draco’s chest; palm flat, fingers spread like a starfish. Draco stopped everything. Shouting, moving. Breathing.
“We might actually elect a man to a seat on the Wizengamot who’s running on a promise of moving backward. His party’s platform leans on severing ties with the Muggle world completely,” she says, as he skims the story.
“Are you angry with Iwan Rhees, then?”
“You know where to find him,” Greg says. Pansy looks momentarily deflated when he turns to look at her. A little far away; a little sad.
Granger wrinkles her nose at him. “It is,” she agrees, after a bite. “I’m just glad to see you eating a decent meal for once, Harry. I worry about you, with the—”
Draco turns up the collar of his cloak against the wet gusts being blown in under the eaves of the train station’s roof. The ends of his hair are damp, and they drip cold water down the back of his neck. He wonders if Potter will come; he wonders if he even received his owl. There’d been no reply.
“Well, yes, of course,” stutters Hermione. “I just— I just didn’t see this coming.”
“I was covering you,” said Harry. “It was perfectly correct.”
“You can touch, too,” Harry says. “You don’t always have to hold yourself apart from everyone.”
was— had reached its end. In his own way, integrity was important to Malfoy, and continuing on past this point would be against his code of ethics.
“Please,” Harry whispered. Malfoy’s breath was heavy and hot against his ear, and he pushed a finger into the cleft where his cock was rubbing, whispered something that made his skin slick and warm.
“I was about to take tea with him, Mr. Potter. Now I think maybe you should take my place. He’s waiting in the conservatory.” She smiles at him, finally; it feels like a spring thaw. “You do remember the way, don’t you?”
“Thank you, Encyclopedia Granger.”
“Potter will disguise himself as someone else, and stay with a partner until we get this thing settled.”
It looks like a knitted hat, but there’s a big hole on one side. It’s where the spout of a teapot would go, he realises as he takes it from her.
Draco clenched his fingers, pulling lightly at the stands of Harry’s hair between them, and the kisses grew sloppier, more frantic. Harry could feel the hard press of Draco’s cock so close to his own, right on top of the heavy burning in his body that wanted Draco, only Draco. Just when he knew he couldn’t stand to wait for the feel of Draco’s bare skin all up and down him, they heard the telltale click of the magical lock on the far end of the hallway to the Auror office.
Millie rolls her eyes and he flops down into a chair beside her. “These house parties are so dull after the first day or so. Why does anyone think they’re a good idea?” he asks.
Draco was quiet for a moment. “Like I was real,” he said. He sounded very young and slightly lost.
Tears begin to slide soundlessly down her cheeks. “He’s going to know,” she whispers. “He’ll know I gave him away.”
“But—“ Draco’s mind stutters. He feels frozen, his boot still untied, staring down at the tiny bomb in his hand. The silence drags on, heavier with every second.
He meets Potter at the foot of the stairs. “Did you see Goyle return?”
Harry leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees. He looks at the portrait of Snape, at the tiny hairline cracks around the canvas's edges and the parts where the brushstrokes show. The real Snape is dead. Portrait Snape is just an echo, a miraculous facsimile, a dead man's voice left behind to sound an alarum. Harry has become a good listener.
“Do you think she knows?” Potter whispers, after she’s slipped away with the other ladies.
He winces. “My apologies. I tend to let work overwhelm me. I don’t really socialize much these days.”
That was too long ago, Draco thinks now. Too much time had passed since then, wasted. Just wasted.
Potter rolls over, closer, and the sheets pull tight over him and then loosen again. An arm slides over Draco’s waist.
“Course not. I picked it up from the pub. But I did heat it up myself.”
Malfoy met his gaze for the first time since Harry had started the conversation. “Now I remember that conversations go very differently when there’s more than one person having them.”
He leans forward, folding his big arms in front of him on the table. Even Hermione leans in, a little, as if to hear him better. Blaise was hypnotic when he wanted to be.
Pansy nods. “The Warringtons didn’t have to pay reparations. They have the money— we have the seat on the Wizengamot.”
Dolohov sends a Killing Curse at him as soon as he enters the room. Harry deflects it with his strongest Shield Charm.
“No power source?” asks Granger, leaning forward. “That’s a very complex charm. I’ve never seen it work on Muggle electronics before.”
"I'll work on being silent and deadly," Malfoy says drily, then looks at Harry, his eyebrows raised. Harry is thinking again about Malfoy's fingers against his wrist. About the pressure that edged into something like pain and how it held him down in his body as if his body was something important, something necessary. He is thinking about Malfoy's hands and his jawline, about the gap Malfoy's shirt collar makes when he undoes the top button as they compare notes after an evening of surveillance. He is thinking about the skin there, right at the base of Malfoy's throat—what it would smell like and taste like and feel like under the careful application of his teeth.
“You got the post-mortem report,” Potter interrupts. “What’s Snape got to do with it?”
Draco lets a smile break through his face. “I told Twinks not to tell her I was here until Greengrass is gone.”
She excuses herself right after dessert.
, with the bite of late October sinking its teeth into all the corners of Grimmauld Place—Harry looked up from his solitary contemplation of the chess board and saw a ghost.
“You mean you had already planned to resign? Before the press scandal?”
“What on earth do you mean?”
“Fine,” he says. “And you?”
He wonders how long it would take to swim until he couldn’t see land at all anymore. He wonders how that would feel.
In the forest, Harry is done with his dying. But here, with Draco, Harry is more sure than ever that he is not done with his living.
"We are here today to discuss the efficacy of the Auror Division's Covert Special Forces teams, originally stood up right after the War with the intent to catch and detain remaining Death Eaters still at large. Today's teams, smaller in number and more specialized, continue that mission, and have an expanded objective to respond with all due speed to new Dark threats, foreign and domestic."
"Remember that club in Warsaw?" Harry asks him. "The fairy lights and the people dancing?"
“Tacky,” Pansy begins.
There is a bed in St. Mungo’s that stays empty. There is a chart that hangs on the end of it, and a name written on the top.
“Well, the balance has shifted, hasn’t it? In terms of power, I mean. Muggleborns hold at least half the positions of power in the Ministry now. And I guess I feel like I can— let go, just a little. Like I don’t have to guard it quite so closely. Loosen my grip a little, I suppose.”
Harry watched as Rose finally got her legs up under her on the chair she’d been trying to climb. It was directly in front of Malfoy’s desk, and she leaned over until her top half was lying across its surface. She stretched an arm out toward him, and he carefully put out his own, palm up. Rose dropped the piece of shiny paper into his hand.
Pansy takes a deep breath. “If I have to marry, I don’t mind marrying you. You’re sensible, and never cruel. But will you mind marrying me?”
Potter told him to use the Floo, so he stands in front of the one in Malfoy Manor, watching the little clock on the mantle tick slowly closer to five. He pulls at the ends of his shirtsleeves, pressing a finger along the cuffs where they lie against his wrist. He’s still not sure what he’s doing— why Potter has invited him back— but there’s a part of him, a part he tries now to stuff down, out of sight, that is glad. Excited, even. It feels dangerous, this hope that he won’t name even to himself. Finally, he smoothes his hand down the back of his hair and then grabs some Floo powder.
“Yeah,” Potter interrupts. Draco tries not to look like he’s curious about whatever Dudley had been about to say.
Weasley opens his mouth, then closes it again. His lips form a flat line.
"Of course," Harry says. "Yes. Of course it does."
December 14th — Wednesday
Potter laughs like he’s making up for lost time. Like there’s an expiration date on some kind of joy he couldn’t reach for a long, long time, and if he doesn’t use it now it will disappear forever.
“So good,” Potter keeps whispering, and he’s making breathy moans in time with the rhythm Draco sets up. His hands tighten in Draco’s hair and his forearms are tense, tightly controlled like he’s holding himself back. Like he might lose himself entirely in Draco’s mouth. In Draco.
Malfoy smiles faintly. “Leave it to Granger, to still be the smartest thing around.” They step outside now, through some intricately-paned glass doors and into a riotous paradise of blooms. Pinks and reds bleeding together along one path, pale oranges and pink-tipped creamy tea roses forming a hedge on the other side.
Draco just looks at her. This enormously talented Muggleborn witch, with her wild, untamed hair and her kind, kind heart. It’s odd, but grace is such a heavy thing, so unexpectedly hard to hold. He wants to tell her so, but he can’t find the words.
“Potter, can nothing control your hair? Will no magic restrain it?”
“That doesn’t feel as inaccurate as it should.” He straightens his collar one more time in the little mirror by the front door. “They’re still not pleased with me finally moving out.”
Harry doesn’t say more, but Draco can hear a lot of echoes behind the simple words.
like Potter.
“I have questions,” Draco says. Potter looks like he’s waiting for more, but if that’s the case, he’ll be waiting a very long time.
“What do you mean?”
Centaurs, werewolves, unicorns, Thestrals, Bowtruckles, spiders, Hippogriffs, a flying Ford Anglia…
Harry’s eyes are a deep, verdant green. The pads of his fingers are rough and his bottom lip is slightly chapped.
At the end of the long corridor, it opens up into a bigger space facing a single walled pen. Three men are standing at one of the judas gates in the door, looking in at the poor animal making sounds he can now make out— low whines deep in the throat, a kind of wheeze with every exhale. When the men see Granger, they step aside.
Draco huffs out a laugh. He nods. And then Harry is leaning into him, his hands coming up to cup both sides of Draco’s face. Harry’s lips move on his, and Draco can taste him. Harry, warm and steady, with a mouth that melts every one of Draco’s walls away. Harry’s kisses are extravagant—long, soft moments of shared breath and tongue and teeth pulling at Draco’s bottom lip. Draco has been starving. He has a castle and a crown and he has his books and his work, but he hasn’t had Harry like this in too long. He feasts.
“And you’d hit them with that spell you made up,” Ginny remembers. “The ‘warm towel’ spell. That’s the whole reason they did it, you know.”
“Nah,” says Harry. He hooks his thumb into the pocket of Draco’s trousers and looks out at the cream and blush-colored roses climbing the hedges. “We started doing that a long time ago. We’re just late bloomers.”
“A fine feast of oxen for Christmas,” says Regulus, and Draco smiles.
the artificial hush of that moment, the one that happened just between them, when the world faded away and all they could see was each other. A lump rises in his throat.
After a moment, he straightens his back, tilts his chin, and winds his way over to the Minster’s secretary. “Excuse me,” he begins, “I was told—“
Harry shrugs. “I went somewhere much nicer, when I was eleven. I understand, though, you see.” He looks up at Draco. “About loneliness.”
“Yeah.” Potter looks at him a little strangely. “You can’t go too wrong with pizza, really, but the place around the corner does a really good one.”
Draco opens its door, running his fingers over where the red paint is chipping away along the handle. Pansy used an extending charm on the inside, once she got it home, and there were cushioned benches running around the walls now. Draco sits down near the telephone and pulls the receiver off its hook. There’s no dial tone because there’s no hook-up for it, but he likes the weight of the plastic when he rests it on his chest.
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy. It’s lovely to see you again.”
The first time he and Potter fucked, he was still engaged to Astoria, and Potter had only recently split from the girl Weasley. Potter had seemed to feel more guilt about it than he did; he and Astoria liked each other well enough, but their future marriage was pure business, really. It was nothing to him if she was having it off with someone else in the meantime, and he’d damn well claim the same leeway for himself.
“If you do not remove your muddy boots from the top of my desk I will hex you six ways into Sunday, Potter.”
“Why not?” Potter looks curious.
“I didn’t say you weren’t,” Draco says, a little snappish. “I’m just reminding you.”
Draco looks so bored Harry almost falters. Almost forgets what he looked like naked in his bed, flushed and wrecked and smiling.
When their eyes locked across the crowded platform, he stopped wondering. They could never be casual, he and Malfoy. Never anything but push and pull, flint and spark.
“I haven’t shacked up with him,” Harry says, feeling a strange mixture of relief and annoyance.
Harry turns on the lamp against the growing darkness and sets the portrait on the nightstand. The cuts on his face are thin pink lines now; they'll be gone by morning. Snape stares back at him.
“Now,” says Narcissa, “let’s do something about your poor roses.”
“You’re a great prince,” says Harry. He touches Draco’s cheek. Most of the urgency is gone between them, but the warmth remains. “And you’ll be a better king. Every kingdom should be so lucky.”
“Draco!” he says, happily. “Nice to see you again. Come on, Mum’s got dinner waiting.”
That particularly curvy secretary over in Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, and what might have happened if the lift had stopped one day, and they’d been trapped inside, alone together, for hours.
“Er…” Harry rubbed absently at the back of his head. “What does that mean exactly?”
“I’m sorry we have to ask you, Draco.” Granger does looks apologetic, but he knows it doesn’t change anything. They’re both too pragmatic for that.
“Very well. And you?”
from. That’s who Draco Malfoy is. Was. Both?” He does laugh now, and it sounds ugly. It sounds like the thing now lodged in his chest, a dark and growing thing.
His boss stops in the doorway and raises his eyebrows.
power. Power merely moves through me.”
Draco shrugs. “Pansy came up with it. She fell in love with Muggle records, and got herself a player, but she’s got a magical apartment and there are no outlets. Pansy’s always been really excellent at Charms. It was her only ‘O,’” he finishes with a smile.
“Toff,” said Harry, stacking all his dirty dishes in the sink.
It’s funny, how that Prophet photographer had caught just this moment. Right before they apparated home, to Harry’s new cottage. When Harry had taken Draco’s jaw in his hands and pulled him down for a kiss.
“To terrorise Blaise. It’s good for him.”
It’s a haze, a trance almost. Draco feels lost in it himself, in what he’s making Potter feel and sound like.
Potter is still watching him, his head still propped up on his arm, but he’s smiling now, and the smile isn’t forced. It isn’t polite or unwilling or uncomfortable. Draco doesn’t know what to call that smile, precisely, but it makes him feel odd on the inside. A spreading warmth and a quiver, low in his belly. A pressure in his chest. He could get lost when Potter smiles at him like that.
Now, Rose looked down at it sitting in her chubby palm and then smiled up at Malfoy.
“I need to follow up with an investigation I was on before the bombing,” he tells Potter the next morning. “I’ve owled Granger for a Portkey. Any chance you’ll stay put like a good boy?”
He stands there, stricken. Her blue eyes looking into his, so clearly, like the sky through a window when the curtain has just been drawn aside.
This is
Draco smiles. “Just dealing with old stuff. I’ve been spending time with a lot of people who knew the old me. And people who have known both, but— but I haven’t made things quite right with. I guess I feel like I owe apologies, but it’s too hard to begin. It’s too hard to give them. And I feel uneasy around them.”
Charlie is waiting for them when they get to the sanctuary. “Been waiting to do this until you two arrived,” he says, beaming. “Wait here.”
Potter’s eyes grow heavier and heavier the longer Draco watches him, and a slight flush starts to creep up his neck toward his face. He sends long glances back across the table between snippets of conversation with his neighbor, some young witch from Brighton that Draco’s never heard of. Draco stares anyway, unabashed. Whatever this thing is that’s happening with Potter, it’s a mutual madness.
“—and then I gave him the statistical analysis I ran last night, but he just said, ‘I don’t think Arithmancy is going to help us here, Miss Granger.’ But when I corrected him, he still wasn’t interested! ‘This might be helpful for a Muggle disease, but not a magical one,’ he said. As if statistics aren’t always helpful—”
, and still not be able to quite bear cutting ties with him? What the fuck does that make me, Potter?”
Two days after that meeting outside the tube, in the dark and the rain, Potter had owled him, and Draco had found himself following him to Hogwarts from Hogsmeade the next afternoon. They'd gone up the twisting staircase to the Headmistresses office, and McGonagall had looked at him so strangely— almost as if he was something fragile and still under her watch. He’d expected suspicion and blame, but all he’d received was the offer of some biscuits from the tin on her desk, and then she and Potter had left to go see something he hadn’t been paying enough attention to remember. And then he’d been alone with Severus Snape’s portrait.
“I know I amuse you,” she says. “But I’m not what you want. I can live with that, Draco. What I need to know is if you can live with it, too.”
Draco felt grass under his fingers and tasted vomit in his mouth. He was gasping and crying, the world swimming under his body. His left arm still hurt—he was not sure if he was injured, if the Dark Lord was summoning him once more, or if the pain was an echo. He was unbelievably cold despite the heat of his arm. As he became more aware of his surroundings, he noticed Potter’s voice and someone’s hand on his back. He was sitting up and Potter was next to him, apparently soothing him with nonsensical stories.
“What is it?” Draco’s heart pounded with anticipation.
“Absolutely,” Harry said. “Don’t sell yourself short, Draco. You’re really fun to be around. And I’m really proud of you for the way you handled everything—well, apart from immediately turning to alcohol when you felt sad. Next time, just come and talk to me, okay?”
Draco didn’t know much about either of them. Dean didn’t attend Hogwarts last year but eventually joined Luna Lovegood in the basement of Malfoy Manor. Draco remembered his piercing glares as he would bring down food to the prisoners. He also knew that Susan Bones had family that died earlier in the War. He felt sick looking at them. They seemed to feel similarly.
The rest of the morning was blissfully uneventful for Draco, but still incredibly exhausting. He had Transfiguration after Defense Against the Dark Arts which went poorly. Professor McGonagall disabled his manacle so he could practice spells, but he was awkward and clumsy with the wand and ending up turning his peach into a rooster instead of a dove. He could definitely tell that many of the other eighth years were snickering behind his back as he dove to catch the bird to shut it up. Professor McGonagall had to help him for nearly the entire period while everyone else moved on to turning a cucumber into a pigeon.
“Draco, what are your thoughts on your parents’ trial? Why weren’t you called as a witness?”
“Fine. Am I free to go?”
“Carefully? With an acknowledgement of exactly what you’ve done?” Draco didn’t realize there was a manual on how to apologize.
Harry smiled. “I don’t think it will be bad. Come on—“ Harry offered Draco his hand. They walked inside, and Draco prepared to face the family he mocked for years.
Draco sighed again. “I guess you’re right. If you’re really sure about this, then it would be the greatest privilege in my life to call you mine.”
“I mentioned to Ron that we hadn’t eaten lunch yet,” Harry said truthfully, though Draco was grateful that he left some details out of the explanation. “So he wanted to go to the Three Broomsticks with us, if that’s alright with you. Everything’s good on our end,” Harry finished pointedly.
“Your parents are in Azkaban? Why?”
“What? No, he got mad at me. We were doing lessons in Defense Against the Dark Arts and he just stormed off. Didn’t even...he didn’t even talk to me tonight.”
from a simple wound. And it was your first time out of the castle, too. How in the world are you going to make it through the year?”
“Not to agree with the Slytherins over there, but why should we trust Muggles? They don’t usually know anything,” Ernest piped up.
“Well, I am the Chosen One, so you should probably listen to me.”
Narcissa bit her lip and nodded. “I understand. I’m—I’m not happy, but most of all, I want you in my life. You can stay. Lucius, he—he hasn’t been himself. His pride is hurt. I’m sure with time—“
“Yeah?”
“Fine,” Draco broke the silence. “Occlumency it is.” Anything to shut Potter up before he opened a door he didn’t walk to walk through.
. But how many times over the past year did he hear his father stammer out an apology to the Dark Lord? How many times did his father apologize to him? Draco had apologized to no one. When he was a child, he was always told what a Malfoy was and what a Malfoy was not. He held onto that like it was his life raft in the ocean. It was all he felt he had. And he was going to use that life raft to keep his sanity this year.
“No, do you really think she’d attack anyone? She didn’t force me to do anything. I just—I mean,” Draco felt sick.
Draco was too physically and emotionally exhausted to question him, and allowed himself to be led to the eighth year common room. He never spent much time here. It seemed as though the rest of the friend groups had their own staked-out areas, but the Slytherins had no corner of the room. Harry led him right to Hermione and Neville, who were sitting on cushions near the fireplace. The crackling of the wood and the heat did not help Draco’s nerves.
Finally they came upon a little village Draco knew as Godric’s Hollow. Draco suddenly felt enormously stupid.
“You’re not allowed to touch her, sit back down,” Yarney said sternly.
“We should get you inside,” Harry said. “I just know Molly is doing everything she can to keep from coming out here and smothering you with blankets, but I doubt she can hold on for much longer.”
The four Slytherins stood up and went to the back of the group. Draco noticed that during the walk, most groups clustered together by house. Granger, Finnegan, Thomas, and Longbottom were together at the front. The Parvati twins were the only two individuals talking from different houses. Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones were talking with Justin Finch-Fletchley and Ernest Macmillan, while the five remaining Ravenclaws climbed the stairs together as well.
Draco quickly turned away from Potter to hide his upset expression. “I’m fine, Potter,” he said, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice. “Why are you in bed?”
Blaise didn’t move for a moment, and Draco was worried he was about to pull out his wand. Instead, he reached for other cushions and made room for the three of them beside Draco. “Anything they can help with, we can also help with.”
Draco hated the Room of Requirement, but for a moment wished it was still functioning so that he could turn it into something Harry would love. On Friday, the day before the date, he found it nearly impossible to pay attention in his classes. Harry noticed when they were working on his Patronus in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
The day of his rumored imprisonment, he wrote letters to his friends, and admittedly one to Potter asking him to free Narcissa, and put them on his neatly made bed so that whoever would deal with his possessions would find them easily. He worried they would never be delivered, but told himself that it was a temporary worry—every concern was. He didn’t plan to stay in Azkaban long—not in the way his father did, where he planned to either escape through dark magic or bribery—because he was going to sleep his life away in the cell. He was going to stop eating and drinking, and wait for the end.
“And what, you expect us to believe you?”
, until we know more information. But you have to be ready to leave everything behind at a moment’s notice. If he puts his plans in motion, we’ll escape to one of the villas. Start a new life abroad.”
“That’s what I spent the last year doing. I protected myself at the expense of others.”
Draco had an enormous amount of faith in Harry, but even he wasn’t sure how the Boy Who Lived could make this right. But Draco did know one thing: for the first time in his conscious memory, Draco looked at Harry and felt as though he were falling in love.
“Malfoy,” the same female voice said again. “Malfoy can you hear me? I need you to open your eyes.” Thinking of his mother, Draco reluctantly obliged, and nearly vomited from the dizziness as Granger’s face swam before him.
As he exited his room, which Harry had left about an hour before Draco woke up, his mind was swimming with all the things he had to do. He would only be attending half of his classes today before meeting with Mr. Burke, but he also had to get his school work in anticipation of tomorrow, and maybe for longer after that if the Wizengamot couldn’t reach a decision. That’s the reason he had given Daphne, Blaise, and Greg for missing breakfast, but in truth he didn’t feel like he could stomach anything. He felt so heavy already, he didn’t want any food sitting in his stomach and weighing him down.
Draco seriously doubts that Potter is nobody, no matter where he is. “No, that’s— no. I need to see Professor Snape’s portrait. I can’t just wander into Hogwarts, can I? I thought—.” He stops, and focuses on pulling in a deep breath, then letting it go again. “McGonagall would let you. She’d let you have almost anything you asked.”
Plus, the twinkly lights are rather pleasant.
Draco searches Warrington’s desk drawers, the bookcases, the paintings to make sure they aren’t covering a safe. He even taps on the wooden paneling to make sure there isn’t a hideaway. The only cabinet in the room turns out to be storage for Warrington’s old Quidditch trophies. He’s about to give up when Potter cracks open the door and hisses, “Someone’s coming.”
“How? How is it still spreading?” Harry ran his hands through his hair, tugging on the ends with frustration. “We’ve been keeping apart from each other for weeks.”
Potter runs a hand over it. “What? I changed the color.”
“It’s alright, Guido,” he says in exasperation. “I can manage. Why don’t you take some time off?”
But Draco doesn’t think of them like that at all. He doesn’t blame Potter. He’s not sure he ever did. When Draco thinks about that day he thinks about the way the light beamed silver through the heavy panes of the bathroom windows, and the way the water on the floor made the sounds around him echo strangely— softer, like the edges of everything were being sanded down, smoothed by his own breath in his ears. He remembers how heavy his body felt, the way his mind seemed to wander, to float out of himself like a dog slipped its tether.
He wasn’t sure how to ask.
“You didn’t think I cared, did you?” he says carefully, to Draco’s back. “I mean, that people know. About us.”
“Do you… want that?”
“Probably a good thing,”says Potter, looking at the pizza box and then over at the dishes in the sink. “I didn’t get much together.”
He tastes sugared lemons, at first, and a hundred feasts laid out on long, wooden tables. Sweat, ash, something sour. He tastes a creeping, crawling fear— how fragile skin truly is, how easily it gives way to spells and knives and knuckles. He tastes copper and water from an old faucet. Then he blinks, and all those things are gone. Only a slightly herbal taste remains on his tongue, and an impression of a fading sweetness.
“Digitalis purpurea,” Snape said, after a moment of silence when Draco was done.
He doesn’t know if Potter buys it, but he leaves without saying a word.
Potter sighs, and Draco glances out the window again, just to check. The ghost has drifted closer, and he feels a strange, skittering dread crawl up his spine. “It keeps coming,” he whispers.
Draco used to steal kisses when he passed Harry on the way to the kettle before work, sleepy morning breath and all. Now, for the past few months, they barely managed to nod at each other as they rushed out the door.
“Yes. I collect them.”
Harry wants to say: "I couldn't stop looking at you. I haven't been able to stop ever since."
“Malfoy.” Potter rubs the bridge of his nose. “I’ll see what I can do.” He looks at Draco for a moment, and then past him. They can hear the train pulling in on the platform below, slowing down until the doors slide open and people start to get off, and then more people on again. Coming and going, coming and going. Draco thinks about going often, truth be told.
“I admit I didn’t think quite this far ahead, either.”
When they’re both breathing normally again and they’ve cleaned each other up, Potter doesn’t bother with the pretense of moving to one side of the bed. He just throws an arm over Draco’s chest and a leg over Draco’s thighs and he falls asleep exactly like that. Draco tries to stay awake so he can listen to Harry breathe against him, but sleep pulls at him, too, with insistent fingers, and he lets it take him under where Potter is already waiting.
“In a real fight, your opponent won’t stop if his sword is gone. He’ll use his fists and his feet and anything else that can subdue and hurt you.”
“Did you make this, Harry?” Weasley has a big aluminium casserole in his hands, and he leans over to smell it as he brings it over to the table.
“That’s because he isn’t four. He’s at least five, probably six.”
“Were you insulting my chess skills in your head?” Harry asked.
“Auror Moretti,” the man says, warmer, and Draco rolls his eyes. “We were told to expect you.”
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. “It’s not really about what I want. But she’s perfectly agreeable. She can hold an interesting conversation and I have no complaints.”
It’s a shock, somehow. There’d been nothing left to interpretation in their previous activity, but feeling Potter’s cock straining against his own is something else altogether, and Potter’s face is so close to his, his mouth is so—
Draco shrugs, setting it back in the receiver. “Ghosts, I guess.”
He can feel the heat rising through his body; not in embarrassment, but in pleasure. At the memory, at the precise timbre of Malfoy’s voice as he said ‘Potter’ just now. At the fact that they were standing here at all, in his own garden, after all these years, with no one and no reasons to feel guilty about anything they might want to do to each other.
Back outside, he takes a deep breath of cool, coastal air, trying to clear the sharp tang of blood from his nose. Granger goes off to find the owner, and he makes a circuit of the sanctuary’s perimeter, looking for signs of any kind of forced entry. He finds nothing.
“What?” she scowls, leaning closer to hear him.
“None,” says Potter, spreading butter on his toast.
Draco learned formal swordsmanship—a thin, neat little blade and precise, choreographed movements. He learned the kind of fighting that’s for show. Harry doesn’t fight for show. He swings a thick, heavy blade at Draco’s automatic parries and the shock of it reverberates all through Draco’s arm and shoulder and chest. With a sword in his hands, Harry is quick and brutal; he is relentless.
After a shower, looking for Malfoy in the mirror.
“My department will want to verify this kill immediately,” says Potter. “You realize this man is at the top of our Wanted list? A Death Eater we’ve been tracking for seven years, since Voldemort’s death?”
“We all will.” Draco watches as their shadows merge together on the old, smooth stones, the sun sinking further down the sky, their shared silhouette getting longer, reaching further, stretching slowly forward.
Draco waits, eyebrows raised, but Blaise looks away, watches the wall of Muggle photographs in all their stillness.
“He works our farm,” Millicent says. “I raise hippogriffs now, didn’t you hear? Granger was certainly all up my arse with inspections and such when she was still with the Magical Creatures Department. Everyone’s wanting them nowadays for riding and hunting. I like it.” She pauses to take another bite. “Greg helps me and does jobs for Cassius.”
“Does that mean you’ll agree?” Harry’s lips are a deep pink and slightly swollen. Draco inhales slowly.
He’s pulling his own coat from the rack in the hallway when Potter comes back from seeing them off, and says, “Fancy a drink and a smoke before you go?”
“Is this ok?” he asks, with his fingers pressing lightly into Draco. He wishes he could say yes in every language, could scream it with every part of his body.
“Then come in,” Harry said, and Draco stepped forward. The sun caught in Draco’s hair and set it shining, like the universe poured liquid gold all over him. Harry forgot to move out of the way and Draco bumped into him. Before he could step back, Harry wrapped a hand around the top of Draco’s arm. They were finally touching, and it was ordinary and entirely, predictably magical. Harry couldn’t help the silly smile that stretched across his face. Malfoy was warm now—not cold. He was flesh and solid bones underneath. Malfoy could be touched, and he could touch back. It was a simple miracle that Harry would never again take for granted. He reached out for Draco’s other hand and felt the rough marks along his knuckles. Harry thought about how surprising the world could still be, how it offered up such strange, glittering gifts even amid the worst circumstances. Draco was blinking at him, slightly tremulous.
Forms change.
“Later, Potter,” he says when Potter pulls back. “Put the kettle on. I’ve been down to the shops. Your tea is shit, by the way.”
“For when you’re ready,” she says.
There was that word again. He wonders how she can sound so sure that there will
The flat is smaller than his old bedroom, back at the Manor. Tiny sitting room, minuscule kitchen, a bathroom with a standing shower, and another room only big enough for the mattress he’d just purchased at a furniture store down the road. He looks at the dresser he brought and shrugs, banishing it to a corner, shrunk, along with the sofa that was too long and the dining table that was too wide. They sit on the floor, looking like dollhouse furniture, and so does Draco, since there’s nothing else to sit on in the front room. There’s a clean tumbler in his hand filled with Ogden’s, and this is
December 18th — Sunday
“We have to talk now,” Draco says to Pansy, when they get her alone in her little solar on the second floor. “About Warrington.”
“Just shrink the damned sofa, Potter. I’m not attached to it, anyway.”
alive, though.” Harry found that any terror he might have felt before was being pushed out by another feeling—sheer bloody aggravation. “And I can think of more fitting places you belong.”
Draco takes a moment to imagine what Pansy will don when they finally marry. A silent scream of a gown, an intricate hair plait of resentment. She has the kind of tenacity he admires.
Sometimes Draco thinks the War never really ended at all, that it's still running beneath their world like an underground stream. He wonders if it will just keep on echoing, and echoing; thousands of individual hurts passed along, only to wash up somewhere else downstream.
“I’ll owl you,” Potter says, and then he steps back out into the darkness and is lost to Draco’s sight.
“Why not?” asks Draco, closing the lid and popping it open again.
“For what?” shouted Harry. “Your life?”
Harry waits.
He holds Evers’ stare until the man turns back toward the sea. This time he doesn’t follow.
“Our people?” asks Potter.
what he wanted. He’d thought it was to acquire everything he now had: a job with the Aurors, his friends, Ginny, Voldemort dead, and hardly anyone trying to kill him. Now he had all those things, and he still didn’t feel any different. He still felt like he was waiting: for the other shoe to drop, for something to click into place and make him feel like he belonged there, for everyone to realize he had no idea what he was doing.
Hermione had clearly been Floo-calling him for a while when Harry finally stumbled downstairs.
"Then I suppose I will never be done," he says.
“The seller. It’s Potter.”
didn't rankle. Didn't make things tense or strange.
Granger isn’t bad to work with, really. She’s actually more competent than most of the Aurors he gets paired with, and she’s still a total swot so she’s always got lots of interesting information about everything she’s investigating. Usually the missions he spends as her back-up are some of the more interesting ones.
“Good.”
Draco sits, and accepts a generous helping of cottage pie on his plate.
Draco steps closer with his wand, up between Harry's legs. He can feel the muscles in Malfoy's thigh tensing and then relaxing between his own. Malfoy touches the end of his wand to the cuts in Harry's face, and with barely a whisper the skin closes along each one, just a slight burn and an itch left behind. They stay that way, Malfoy between Harry's legs and Harry looking up at him, for long moments after Malfoy is done. The bathroom is quiet, hushed, and a bead of sweat has gathered at the base of Malfoy's throat.
December 28th — Wednesday
“I didn’t know, either, until maybe twenty minutes ago.” He hands Dean one of the coffees and a doughnut.
“Draco,” he says. Draco says nothing. The silence stretches a little too long.
“Right.” Potter looks at him for a moment, then starts spelling his furniture to fit his flat.
“Daphne’s sister?”
“Draco,” Potter groans above him. “Draco.”
Draco scrunches up his nose and Harry laughs. “I suppose it’s like any other capital. I didn’t hate it when I was younger, actually. I wanted my father to take me with him when he went to court, and for awhile he did. I thought it was all very grand, and felt very important. I was ridiculous. Court is all smiling and scheming at the same time, and the grand stuff is just a veneer. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Spells wear off.
“I’d love to know the details of that one.” Granger sounds regretful.
Draco’s fingers wrapped tightly around Harry’s and he smiled back, slow, and then stretching out into forever.
Draco nods. “And heard him. He’s got cold feet about Warrington’s plans.”
For someone who’s done absolutely nothing besides raise a bottle to his lips for weeks, he feels so very, very tired. “What’s it matter, Weasley?”
“No,” Draco says. “You really don’t. You have no idea.”
Draco Malfoy stood on his stoop—the real, embodied Draco Malfoy. He looked thinner and a little worn. His pale skin wasn’t as smooth and shining in the flesh, and there was something about his eyes that seemed bruised. He desperately needed a haircut.
The longest night ends in a gauzy wash of pink dawn and a modest feast for everyone. The rest of the meat they salt and store for the remainder of winter and the spring ahead of them.
“Go for the knees, too,” Harry says quietly, and then he steps back. He returns Draco’s hands and body back to him.
Carys nods, but she’s still looking through the window, out toward the sea crashing onto the beach and the tall landmark in the distance.
, the man—“
The point is, Harry has never had trouble with variety during his solo sexual excursions. But ever since that day at Hogwarts, when he’d looked into the Mirror again, all he’s been able to think about, no matter what images and fantasies he tries to conjure late at night in his bed, or in his morning shower, is Malfoy. Malfoy’s long fingers around his cock. Malfoy’s pale hair falling into his eyes and the high spots of color in his cheeks. Malfoy behind him, pounding into him. Malfoy pushing him further, holding him down by the scruff of the neck. Harry out of control, and the buzzing, burning relief of that.
“Here, Potter,” said Malfoy, as Harry wrapped his free hand around the base of Malfoy’s cock, squeezing in time with the slide of his mouth. “Right here.”
The next day he doesn’t leave his room. He can’t— won’t— face Potter. Not yet, anyway.
The cigarette trembles on the way to her mouth.
“Is Greg back yet?” he murmurs into her ear.
“Please,” he whispers instead, and Potter knows exactly what to do.
Magical firsts, by categories:
Draco sits up. Potter stirs and then settles, his head half on Draco’s pillow. Draco extricates himself the rest of the way carefully. He slowly pulls the drawer of the guest dresser open so that it won’t squeal on its hinges and rummages around inside until he pulls out a bathing suit, then he creeps quietly from the room, shutting the door silently behind him.
“Relax, Malfoy. I do know how to do my job, you know. Whatever else you think of me, I’m a good Auror.”
need to take the stress of all this seriously, especially after what you went through in the war, and before that, too. It might seem like staying at home is a small thing in comparison, but it’s hard to be alone. It’s hard not to know what’s going to happen. We aren’t meant to live like this. We need each other.”
“Watching, but removed.” Draco searches for the censure in Harry’s tone, but he hears only curiosity.
There were two ways to think about ghosts. There was a haunting that was internal, guilt or shame or grief hovering and dogging a person’s every step; and then there were actual, physical hauntings—a blood-spattered Baron from the eleventh century wandering the halls of your boarding school, say, or the little flower-selling girl in the shabby Victorian dress who sat on the back steps of your garden at night. If you thought about it, the second, non-metaphorical variety of ghost was actually the least dangerous. That was what Harry would have said, anyway—until the dark, really-quite-chilly night when he looked up and saw the ghost of Draco Malfoy standing across from him in the parlour of Grimmauld Place.
The kettle is starting to hum, like it does just before it boils and whistles, but Potter isn’t looking at it. He doesn’t even seem to notice. He’s watching Draco.
Harry nods. He knows it to be true.
And that’s when it happened. He was never sure afterwards whether it had come from him, from Malfoy, or from both of them: the burst of uncontrolled magic that went off like a bomb, shattering all the cups and saucers and teapots. The sugar bowls and the plates and even the glass tops of the little tables. The shards exploded around them and seemed to hang there, suspended around and between them. It was like being encased in a snow globe, the moment paused, and instead of glitter-snow they were surrounded by broken china.
But of course, the best thing about Malfoy as a partner is that Harry never has to explain. Harry blinks, and suddenly Malfoy is right in front of him. Very slowly, Malfoy leans in and presses a finger into the skin just behind the hinge of Harry's jaw. He waits there, silent, as if he's counting something. Harry is aware of the breath moving in and out of his lungs, of Malfoy's breath warm against his cheek, and the trace of citrus cologne left on the collar of his shirt. He can feel his blood rushing now through his body, feel his nerve endings flare as if waking from a long, dormant winter. Harry's body, an unexpected miracle once again.
Dean nods. “Just started this one.” He pauses to chew, and then says, “It’s been a good week for it. Finished up two others yesterday.”
Draco takes a deep breath. He wants to put his hands on Harry. He wants to map out every place he’s only looked at, only imagined in the secret corners of his mind.
“I see,” says Narcissa. They look at each other, and he wonders how close he is to being hexed. He really doesn’t want to pull his wand out on Draco’s mother.
Weasley sighs. “A much as I don’t want to, I feel inclined to help her if she asks for it. Call it a debt. Also Hermione is upset and up my arse about it, too.”
A ghost of a smile curled up on Malfoy’s mouth.
Potter blinks and leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “I’d forgotten about that,” he says. “With everything that happened.”
“Of course. I’ll have an elf show you up. What about you, Dudley? Shall I have a mount saddled for you?”
“Fuck off, Blaise.”
“We’ve had a hell of time keeping those bandages on him,” Charlie tells them. “He just incinerates them when he’s not feeling it, silly bugger.”
“He’ll never be a tourney knight, I grant you. But he’s scrappy and persistent, and damn good with a blade. Harry will make a fine, useful knight.”
“You know better,” Warrington is saying in clipped tones, “or you ought to, at least. I don’t want you seen here.”
“That you’re selling for her, you mean,” says Dudley, who holds out an enormous hand to Draco. He shakes it, Potter’s eyes on him the entire time. This must be some kind of test— whether he’ll be rude to Potter’s Muggle cousin.
“The wife says she hasn’t seen or heard a thing. She seemed rather disinterested in her husband’s project, actually.”
It’s not that Draco would normally be doing anything in his living room to be ashamed of, either, but just knowing Potter is here, that he knows everything Draco’s doing— that he is a witness to Draco’s free time— keeps him from doing anything but read a book.
“What happened?” Potter asks, his voice gentle.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “And I keep thinking about it. I keep thinking about how you couldn’t kill Dumbledore, and how scared your mum was that night in the forest. And I keep thinking about how it felt to be locked in the cupboard when I was a kid. To be so alone.”
“And I was having tea one day, at this little spot just off the Piccadilly line— I like riding the Tube, so I often try different lines and get off at random stops to look around.” Draco thinks about all the times he closed his eyes and let his finger fall on a random dot sprinkled across the Underground map. How frightening it was, at first, just to walk into one of the cars and find a place to sit or stand, and then to emerge from the stop, up into the bustle and light and everything he wasn’t familiar with.
Lucius slammed his hands down on the table, causing Draco to jump. “How can you possibly say that? It seems that my mind is more sane than yours, even after Azkaban! Harry Potter is the very reason that we cannot leave our home. The reason that we are not invited to any of the forthcoming balls. And now, our son, the only heir to the Malfoy fortune, is throwing his life away. For a man, none the less.” Lucius picked up his butter knife and pointed it at Draco. “I will hear no more of this. You will marry a pureblood woman and she will bear a pureblood child to carry our name.”
Finally it was time for the feast, and a pit settled in Draco’s stomach again. Amazing food lay before him, but the smell just made him nauseous. How many times had he eaten in the Great Hall last year under the watchful gaze of Death Eater professors, tightly surrounded by his allies who looked to him for guidance and information? How many times had others not as fortunate been barred entry into the Great Hall by the Carrows? How many people sometime didn’t get to eat for days?
“Mr. Malfoy, we can sit and stare at each other all evening if you’d like, but I’m sure there are better ways to spend your Friday evening. Why does this give you such anxiety? The Healers are very nice people, and the students who have tried it thus far have found it extremely helpful.”
“Wait, I have a better plan.” Harry led Draco with the Invisibility Cloak to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Draco groaned inwardly, but agreed that this was the best possible solution.
project, it’s just my idea. Second, I don’t think we should leave him out. From what Ginny was able to tell me, he was an integral part of...the operations here. At the time.” Draco knew what Hermione meant. He was in charge of organizing seventh years to help the Carrows with detentions and other punishments. To be quite honest, Vincent was the only one eager to take part in the task. He loved to talk about who cried the most, and who was trying to be brave at first and then crumbled once put under the Cruciatus. He loved to use the Imperius curse in the hallways to make first and second years do stupid things that sometimes endangered themselves. His main goal upon graduation was to become a Death Eater.
“It’s alright,” Harry told him gently. “Sit down. I talked with Professor McGonagall this morning. And with Ginny, last night.”
“Wonderful,” McGonagall seemed oblivious to his rage. “That will be your appointment slot for the next three weeks. If you wish to continue after that, you may, but it will not be required.”
“As you know, we are in charge of figuring out how to honor the fallen. Yes, both those who fought with the Order of the Phoenix and those who fought with the Death Eaters.” There were some displeased murmurs in the crowd at this statement, and Goyle tensed. “This will not be easy and will take a lot of discussion. But that’s why we have the whole year.”
“Yeah, I’m sorry, I didn’t have time to catch you guys before dinner.” Draco used to order Vincent and Greg around all the time without giving them much prior notice of what was happening. But things were different this year, and he knew that it would have been more ideal to tell his friends. “Is that alright?”  he finished, looking toward Greg.
“What in the bloody hell are you making over there, Potter? Have you summoned me here to kill me?” Draco peeked in Potter’s cauldron to see a gray, unnaturally viscous liquid.
He opened the door quickly enough so that it wouldn’t creak, but slowly enough so as not to wake the sleeping figure in his bed. Draco beamed—Harry Potter in his bed! It was his best dreams as a young teenager realized. All his pains forgotten, he stood close to the bed to watch Harry as he breathed evenly, in and out. He tossed and turned a bit, but didn’t seem to be having a nightmare. At one point he stretched, pushing back some of the hair on his forehead and revealing his scar. It was so beautiful.
Their disguises held up, and no one paid them any mind. That is, until a strong gust of wind made Draco’s beret fly right off of his head. Draco cursed and ran after it, promptly bumping into someone who was picking it up. “So sorry, sir,” he started.
Draco was expecting that almost all the eighth years were going to go, and that he was only casually invited. He was surprised at the intimacy of the group.
Draco hesitated. It seemed that Greg was sad, but Draco knew he’d never been good at comforting people. The roaring fire made him uncomfortable as well. Swallowing, Draco settled on the floor next to Greg, staring into the flames. They sat in silence for a few minutes.
Draco deals with the worst news he’s ever received, and tries to answer an age-old question.
“One moment,” Harry said. “Like I said, I want to do this properly, and a normal first date doesn’t end with being swarmed with autograph requests.” He pulled out his wand.
“What happened? Are you alright?” Harry asked.
Draco was slightly taken aback and disappointed, but then joined the rest in a small chuckle. “I really can never catch a break, huh? Not quite a dragon, but close enough,” he said good-naturedly.
“I mean, you know how it goes with blokes most of the time,” Draco said as he was stroking Harry’s hair one night. They had just had a make-out session, during which Harry asked to leave things where they were before they became too heated. They helped each other finish, but only with kisses and strokes with the hand. “Usually one is on top and one is on bottom.” Draco didn’t actually know if this was true, but it was what he heard from some of his more crude classmates.
Granger narrowed her eyes at Draco’s accusatory tone. “He prefers to work these things out alone, for the most part. He learned a lot of strategies at the Mind Healer’s. He’ll come back when he’s ready. But if he isn’t back in five minutes, I’ll go talk to him.” She continued her conversation with Neville.
Auror Yarney turned back to face him. His stoic face had been replaced by a glare. “My colleague just sent me Mr. Potter’s statement on today’s events. Apparently Dolohov said,” he looked back at his parchment. “‘They know more than they’re letting on’, referring to your parents.” Yarney looked back at Draco. “Well?”
“Malfoy, this war didn’t change you a bit. You only care about yourself. You don’t want to make amends. You have nothing to say about my sister or all the other people whose lives you ruined.” Justin was shaking with rage as he rattled off accusations.
“Suppose you had gotten caught?” Lucius was nearly yelling now. “Our son most certainly would not have been alright then. This whole thing could have been over with if it hadn’t been for you. If you had told the truth, the Dark Lord could have tried again, or captured Potter. We certainly wouldn’t be outcasts!”
“I don’t even know if I’m allowed back in my own home. Besides, he may have some bad memories of the place.” Draco didn’t know how much his friends knew of Harry’s capture in his home the past Easter. When Draco returned to school, though, there were rumors everywhere that Harry had been caught but managed to escape the Dark Lord’s clutches again. Of course, his friends had asked about the legitimacy of these rumors, but Draco physically could not tell them due to his punishment.
He stood up and shook Lucius’s outstretched hand. “Goodbye Father.” Lucius nodded. Draco breathed, wanting to keep the empty, nonplussed feeling he had mustered instead of the rush of emotion rising up inside of him. He would not miss his father. He would not. There was no reason to feel anything except neutrality or relief.
Draco sat up. “Yeah. I just—dreamt of the first time I learned about...Teddy’s grandmother. My mother said she abandoned the family. And I got upset, and then she assured me she and my father would never abandon me.” Draco let out a humorless laugh.
“I think we know well enough where we stand, we’re roommates and...friends? I guess?”
“This is a terrible idea,” Blaise said, though it actually did not take much convincing for him to come along. “They didn’t even invite us.”
“Draco has been very good at Hogwarts. He even has made Harry Potter an ally,” Narcissa said proudly. At any other point Draco would be grateful for her defense of him, but he just cringed inwardly. If Lucius really did know about his relationship with Harry Potter, he had to do everything he could to not bring up the Boy Who Lived—a goal which was certainly unprecedented.
Professor McGonagall sighed, and Draco braced himself for whatever she was going to say. “It appears they took some sort of a deal. They agreed to be held in Azkaban until a retrial in order...” she paused. “In order for you to maintain your probation, rather than be retried with them.”
The two spent the rest of the day frequenting the smaller shops around Hogsmeade. Many of the store managers kept a wary eye on Draco, but their anger with him seemed to be balanced out with their reverence for Harry. The two certainly made an interesting pair, and Draco kept an eye out for press. If something came out, he might even be grateful that his parents were in Azkaban and wouldn’t be able to see the tabloids. Draco was also able to get a necklace for his mother—a beautiful and pure emerald on a golden chain, to reminder her that she was a Slytherin through and through.
He did not want an attack while he couldn’t even be seen or heard. Him being discovered would mean the end of his parents’ trial—a fact which did not help to calm his nerves. Draco pushed down feelings of anger toward his mother. Why would she tell the entire Wizengamot about his sufferings? Some part of him knew that the more she mentioned about what their family went through, the better chance there was of redemption, but he was also horribly embarrassed. How could anyone take his suffering seriously when he had such done terrible things to others?
Draco figured he was particularly good at Occlumency because of the way he organized his emotions. When he was younger and faced difficult situations, like rejection by Potter in his first year, he would lie in bed at night and close his eyes. He pictured a long hallway similar to the ones he found in the Manor, but with different colored doors. Brighter doors were for his good emotions—happiness, excitement, and joy. His father always told him that those emotions should be moderated as well. “No one likes someone who never takes things seriously, Draco,” he would say. “If you’re giggling like an idiot all the time, stumbling through the world without a care for real problems, you’re never going to succeed.” So when something really good happened, Draco stored it in the room with the light green door, like pets waiting for him after a long and dreary day.
“You see, when two people really really like each other—“ Another slap. “That’s a ridiculous question! Because we want to? Because we like each other?” Draco was exasperated. “You’re trying to find Death Eaters and you choose to interrogate me about my relationship status? Why don’t you make yourselves useful and focus on an actual threat.”
“I...forgot that part. Yes, he did. But I have no idea to what he might be referring.”
“You just did. But of course.”
Greg nodded, to Blaise and Daphne’s displeasure, and set the letter on fire. Draco felt a little ill. He was wondering if Theo truly did want to bring back the Dark Lord, or if the younger Nott was experiencing the kind of anxiety that Draco had for the past two years.
“That sounds good, I need to work on some homework anyway. I’m going to go get breakfast with Hermione and Neville, do you want to come?”
Just when he was starting to get comfortable at Hogwarts, he now was told to retreat back into his former self. He wanted to protect his mother more than anything. If he had to stay in his bedroom for the better part of his school days to do that, so be it. It wasn’t any different than what he did all summer, and what he would likely have to do for the rest of his life. Why he ever thought he could have friends like Goyle and even Potter, he had no idea.
His mind was reeling and his heart raced, making his chest ache and the castle lilt to one side. He leaned against the wall and desperately tried to breathe, but his lungs were closing.
“Yeah,” Harry choked out. “Thanks, Draco. I’ll see you later.” Draco heard Harry’s footsteps as he left the classroom.
Draco looked around, waiting for his father’s gaze watching him reproachfully, making sure he didn’t misstep. The Astronomy Tower was blissfully empty, though. He knew he was taking a long time to respond, but Luna just smiled up at him, waiting patiently.
Draco was embraced immediately upon entering the foyer. As his arms dropped his trunk and wrapped around his mother, he noticed that she seemed to finally be back to her old form. She had always been slender, but when he hugged her this past summer it hardly seemed like there was anything left to embrace. “Hi mum,” he whispered, using an informal name as he drank in her scent.
Draco smiled and looked down bashfully. “Me too. I’ll admit, I always thought I’d be the first to say it. Hell, I would have said it already by now if I knew you were ready.”
The small group didn’t go far into the Forbidden Forest until they came to a small tent. It had different designated spots for flowers on the outside, and Draco could make out Fred Weasley’s picture illuminated by candlelight. Someone’s wand lit up the sign attached to the top of the entrance, which read, “DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY” and then in smaller letters, “IN HONOR OF THE FORGOTTEN.” Draco frowned. He had heard of people collectively calling those who died during the war “the fallen,” but never the forgotten.
“Well you shouldn’t be.” Draco said, hating seeing Harry worked up like this.
Draco thought of closing doors in his mind to attempt to block the tears from his eyes. He did not know that he needed to hear those words, and he could feel the ache in his chest as if Harry had pointed out a gaping wound in his soul. “Thank you,” was all he managed to get out.
Draco groaned. He totally forgot about that. His parents had been just about the only thing on his mind for the past few weeks, and now that they were out of danger for the moment, he had pushed the issue out of his brain to focus on Harry. This weekend it would be time to pay the piper. “Yeah. I’m definitely not going to say anything to my father, he’s still in the hospital and he already hates me.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. “But I may be able to broach the issue with my mother cautiously.”
The two walked mostly in silence for a few miles, even passing Hogsmeade. “Why can’t we just Apparate there?” Draco whined.
The paper transformed, ink lining the page like someone was drawing. Draco recognized the familiar shape of the Hogwarts grounds. Little footsteps moved across the parchment with names attached. It looked like a record of everyone that was in the school.
“Mother!” Draco stood up.
“Are you alright?” Draco took Harry’s hand away from his forehead and held it in his own.
Surprisingly, Draco decided to tell his friends about what would be happening on Saturday. There were only two options—they would be okay with it, or they wouldn’t. If it didn’t bother them, great. If it did, that would be alright too, and Draco would simply walk further down the path of distancing himself from the other Slytherins. He literally had nothing to lose, and had grown tired of sneaking around over the past year.
Harry Potter gave Draco a wry smile as he looked at their surroundings. “I promise not to slice you open if you promise not to attempt to torture me.”
“That’s wonderful,” his mother smiled.
Draco beamed.
Saying goodbye to his mother was hard, even though he knew that he would see her in a little over a month. It almost seemed to be harder for him than it was for her. She had changed out of lounging clothes and into something a little more proper, a little more like herself.
!” He opened his eyes only to find the faint outline of a creature, not a full Patronus. Still, it was certainly progress.
Draco felt himself freeze. He totally forgot about his...cousin? Draco wasn’t one hundred percent sure of the relation, but he certainly remembered Voldemort’s mocking comments about the child born from a half blood and a werewolf. He tried to catch the last bit of the conversation, and heard that Andromeda was planning to come with infant Teddy the next day. Draco looked at Harry in panic. Harry nodded toward the living room, and they were able to escape without notice given the happy chaos in the other room.
