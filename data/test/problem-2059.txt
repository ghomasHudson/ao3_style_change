“Soooooo?“, she asks invitingly, her gaze expectant. Harry settles down beside her, hands her one of the steaming mugs and takes a deep breath.
Drew too has come to his feet now. “Me neither. It was a pleasure having you here. I also enjoyed myself a lot”, he utters equally stilted parting words.
“Yeah.” The only time he was ‘living’ close to the sea was during their hunt for the Horcruxes 5 years ago. A time when he had to accept the death of Dobby and so many others not to speak of the upcoming confrontation with Voldemort while still trying to hold his shit together. Not quite the moment to make assessments of the suitability of a cottage by the sea as a permanent lifestyle.
Harry can’t shake off the impression of Blondie watching their every movements and words. His eyes are definitely directed at them. He gulps and tries for a wry smile. Blondie laughs, and the music is definitely too loud but Harry could swear, he not only saw but heard it. Maybe some amplifying charm? Harry wonders if that was possible, drifting away in his mind.
"Most times I was the seeker," he smirks at Harry. "Had some tell me I’m not that bad. Even if I probably can't match your talent." Harry hears a bit wistfulness from his last words.
“Okay, I’m sorry”, a pouty Cassiopeia mumbles, not quite taking the hint, that Harry would like to bring the conversation to an end.
“I hope I don’t need to be excluded then? Now that I am aware of my part beforehand. Leaves not much briefing to be done anymore to me”, Blondie is visibly amused, which Harry takes in with joy.
Her eyes wide, then she smiles again. "I'd be lying if I said I expected it, but it also doesn't surprise me." Her eyes glance over the crowd, fixate on a hopping blue dot, then with sudden realization "You and Falk... You're not an item, are you?"
„Well, as you probably witnessed, he – uh, Drew is his name - took me home to his place last night. Apparently, he owns slash rents a loft in Soho, quite the posh guy if you ask me.”
Sulkily Harry frowns und crosses his arms, when on a second thought he appraises this outcome. He’s not here to just pick up where their ONS left off, is he?
As he continues to ruminate, he realizes for the first time the absurdity of one night stands. How come he has never questioned why he willingly shares his most intimate, vulnarable sides with randomly chosen people on a regular basis without much hesitation, and even appreciated this anonymity and fleetingness? In the wake of recent events, it seems insane to him that he ever considered such an idea.
So instead of shuffling to his bedroom, Harry heads to the kitchen and prepares himself another cup of coffee along with some toast.
"Err...", he hasn't expected his private outing to go this smoothly. "I guess. I actually haven't quite looked around yet." With which he catches up immediately. He scans the moving people, stopping every now and then to examine a person in deeper detail, but none of those present stick remarkably to his mind.
On his back, he finds himself climbed onto and plastered with kisses all over his belly, a smooth transition from were they left before. Drew tucks on Harry’s shirt this time intended to get it off of him. Harry props himself on his elbows, easing the process. His remuneration is expressed in form of a shirtless Drew, who’s palatable sight Harry acknowledges with a sharp inhale and biting on his lower lip. He tries to muster a plan to get those pants out of the way, too, with just his gaze, as wand- and wordless spells are off the chart in his current condition.
“Sure”, Drew smiles, squeezes softly and brushes Harry’s arms longer than necessary when they detach from the embrace. “Well then, arrive home safely and get yourself a good night’s sleep.” He steps back, so Harry can apparte without reservations.
"Okay, good.  At that point I really would have doubted my human knowledge. I love you both but... I don't think it’d be a fit. Speaking of, anyone here to your liking then?"
The three of them finish off their meal after the small interruption by Peagreen has been ended with his farewell, and then soon after Harry sees them off, too.
“I don’t feel in the right condition to consider anything but penalizing myself right now.” Harry’s morbid humour only covers part of his inner conflict.
“Freudian perception, huh?”, Drew jokes. He isn’t nearly as affected by Harry’s rejection, as Harry would have assumed. He shakes his head, hoping to shake away all those unhelpful nerve-wrecking thoughts aswell.
Physically recovered Harry straightens his back, inhales deeply. “Not exactly what you expected to wake up with last night, huh?” Self-irony is still the best self-protection.
"Morning, Ron. No everything’s fine, don't worry. I'd like to invite you and Hermione over to my place tonight on the spur of the moment though. Does that work for you?"
A glance at his watch reveals that by now he can be on his way without turning up unpleasantly early. At first, he had considered taking his broom, not least to have a good excuse for his tangled hair, but the stormy very April like weather decided against it. Instead, he sent Siora again to enquire whether he could Apparate without being dismembered by wards. Dishevelled, but with a positive confirmation, she returned.
“Will do”, he murmurs and carefully puts them on, surprised by the pleasant feeling of it on his skin. Maybe he should consider putting more money into his wardrobe.
“You’re surprisingly cute”, Drew cups Harry’s cheek with his left hand, forcing him to divert his view. “Then, let’s not keep you to the torture much longer”, says, leans down and finally their lips meet. Harry sighs with relish as he more than willingly gives in. There’s something undeniably unique to first kisses. It’s not the feeling of soft skins touching or the taste, even if both take considerable portion in good kisses general, and in this one especially. It’s the thrill of finally getting what you’ve been pining for. The climax of long accumulated lust and desire. The starting shot of something exhilarating.
"Here," he murmurs, holding out the bowl of Siora's food to the owl. While the owl gratefully feasts on it, he reads the letter.
“What a shame, you’re not interested in the continuation of this affair. I feel like I could get used to the sight of a half-naked Harry Potter ducking in front of me.” Though it’s packaged as a joke -not a good one, admittedly-, there is indeed a touch of bitterness in Drew’s voice. Something Harry hears with delight, does it not hint, Drew might really regret the premature end of their liaison? And thus, might really not be interested in selling his story to the press?
“Shall I turn around?” It’s more of a provocation than an offer, and pretty obvious, that Drew is damn well aware of the reason behind Harry’s hesitation.
Harry grins, "I like your definition of romantic partner as ‘fuck buddy who cares'. At least I don't wonder why you keep on being single deliberately."
He breathes a sigh of relief when he can see Cas' name at the foot of the paper roll. So, this seems to be her owl, then. Fitting, Harry realises as he scratches the bird's feathers on the back of its neck. A sublime yet discreet alien beauty with a mysterious aura about her. The aslant dark eyes in its heart-shaped face actually remind him of Cas facial features as well.
"Yes?", Harry grins, amused but also mildly confused. He likes this slightly self-conscious, endeavoured Drew. He seems approachable, sincere.
Actually it is only their height, weight and Caucasian heritage whereon they match. Which are the most relevant parts to Harry to feel content and congruent when, well, taking sexual actions in a body that isn't really his. Also its convenient wardrobe-wise. It is a tragedy he can't determine the size of the prick when going for DNA hunting but that's how it is. As he runs a hand through his current hair he misses his own dishevelled curls.
"I hope I wasn’t misinterpreting the situation. It’s just, someone concealing their real name doesn’t quite give off the ‘earnest dating’ impression."
Harry sighs. "We talked this over more than twenty times now, haven’t we? I don't want to go public... And I'm pretty sure it's not an option to have a relationship, that heavily relies on the use of polyjuice." The topic stings Harry's guts.
“How did he react?”, Cas’ hand had found its way to her mouth, concealing parts of her horrified face.
“Unsurprisingly surprised. Unexpectedly approving. Well, it was mostly me acting and reacting and him just being there, trying to not frighten me off. Yeah, it kind of felt like that.” Now that he puts it into spoken words, Drew's reaction seems far less confusing and ambiguous. In fact, for the most part he had been courteous and understanding. Enough to make up for the one or two too many inappropriate suggestive jokes
And so it came about that they had scheduled a date for the afternoon of the very next day. Despite the temporally close proximity from the start, Harry was startled to realise just how soon it was the time to leave. A second check on the clock confirms that it is indeed so. He takes a deep breath, puts on a thin windbreaker - just in case he does have to step outside the front door - and visualises the flat he couldn't leave fast enough just a week ago.
"It also only took her two minutes to understand from my hand and foot signs that you can only get in from the other side of the house. As an owl."
“No, that’s very much my own fault. I think, you can guess, that you weren’t supposed to learn about this. Especially not in this ungallant way.” He almost laughs at the absurdity of the situation. Here he sits on an iniquitous pricey couch in the care of an irresistible attractive man, on a dignified Saturday that screams to be spend solely with careless lazing and fucking around, and all he can wish for is to be at home in his bed and sober up, preferably alone in the comfortable certitude of preserved anonymity.
"Yeah, but I'll refrain," Harry jokes, way to smitten with Drew’s appearance to perceive the short facial derailment let alone question it.
"Okay," Harry murmurs and shrugs his shoulders. He settles down on the sofa closest to him and the comforting sinking into the soft leather paired with the still breath-taking view over London throws him back in time. Panic spreads, and it takes some effort to consciously suppress it. It helps to remind himself that he is here voluntarily, wearing his own clothes, freshly showered and unhungover. And that not a single reporter has shown up at his place since his last visit. So why should it happen now? Then again, this could be a belated set-up.
“Then make time. Do you want to veg out into the day forever and hope that the world around you will hopefully change for the better on its own?”, she shoots back without mercy.
"I decided that I should possibly give Drew a chance. We met again yesterday." Strangely, he is embarrassed to tell the others about it.
As the transformation finishes he looks at the result in the mirror. He hasn’t quite remembered anymore how handsome his chosen personification for this evening is, and is very pleasantly surprised. If it wasn't himself ‘wearing’ this body, he’d hit on the bloke that was looking at him with dark eyes through the mirror.
“It’s fine. Sooner or later, we all reach a point like this. The important thing is, to not let it get a hold of us”, she says with an encouraging smile. Harry nods sheepishly.
And then not wasting a second more Drew’s mouth comes down on Harry. He gasps, his legs uncontrollably spasming and one of his hands slipping off on the counter. Harry’s bodily misfunction results in a hard smack of the back of his head against the wall behind him.
"Hey”, she gives Falk a short hug, then looks at Harry “Won't you introduce me to your friend, Falk?", she prompts. Falk laughs and Harry only now remembers Cas unawareness of his polyjuice potion habit and her thus not recognizing him.
A reason that deep-routed and touched is not what Harry had expected. He swallows, struggling for words in his mind. He wants to sound clever, similarly impacted, resonating, but if he's honest, Harry can only guess at Drew's connection with plants. Perhaps it's similar to how he feels when flying on a broomstick. Just flying without a destination, when his limbs dissolve, merge with the broomstick and he’s merely soaring through room and time.
For a short moment they lock eyes, leaving Harry to wonder, if Harry was his type. He's not convinced though. First, he needs to be gay. Unlikely enough. And second, they actually look quite alike, and that usually never comes in handy. For a moment Harry damns himself for today’s choice of DNA. What good does it gain him, when the face in the mirror is close to his target group but scares off this exact group.
“Sure”, Harry complies, relieved to see the adversary go, not knowing that the strongest resistance he has to fight is himself. I’ll just rest my eyes until he returns, he tells himself, already trailed back into slumber.
“Mh, just like you proved on the dance floor before? I believe you have a lot of stamina,” Drew notes provocatively. They stand body to body again. Just like on the dance floor before. Harry feels the heat of arousal dwelling up, starting in his chest, crawling slowly to his head.
"Honestly, I have a question to get off my chest too. Why me?" he asks, now also leaning briskly on his knees. "Why not find another, easier-to-get guy?"
With quick steps he walks through the flat in search of his shirt. He notices once again how tasteful and luxurious the furnishings are, and for the first time he notices a concert grand piano, which is not exactly inconspicuous. His gaze flickers to Drew, back to the piano. It's surprisingly easy to imagine his slender fingers gliding gently but firmly over the keys, surrendering the flow of the music, the playing gradually taking on a life of its own with each successive bar he strikes. A form of passion that Harry was allowed to feel on his own body yesterday. A rush of blood towards his crotch reminds him that fantasies of this kind are counterproductive when you still have to convince yourself that there is definitely no sexual tension in the room.
“How are you so sexy?”, Drew groans, giving up the maintenance of his provisionally implemented cage-trap in favor of grabbing the arse of the captive, much to its delight.
Drew laughs up. "The fact that you haven't become a professional Quidditch player probably surprises half of England. Me included."
For much longer than necessary, he lets the hot water pelt his back, trying to conjure up the usual blissful mood of a sleepy hangover day, but failing. Yes, his muscles relax under the heat and his circulation also responds positively to the gentle stimulation, but one cannot speak of this effect being transferred to his mind. On the contrary. Instead of getting out of the shower, to look forward to his bed and a light novel while drinking a cup of tea, he feels as if he is about to take his NEWTs (even though he has never taken them in fact; if the two situations are even remotely similar in their stress potential, he sees little to no incentive to ever do so at any point, given how drained he feels right now).
Harry’s then being told more about the plants that have been set up, when he explicitly requests it, his attention being much more focused on the passionately narrating Drew than on the actual content. They linger in the conservatory as long as the sun gives off its last rays, then go back downstairs.
“I’d be offended, if you stop now”, Harry unburdens him, accompanied with a pelvic thrust into Drew’s stagnated palm, encouraging it to carry on with whatever it was intending to do.
"You like plants," Harry states flattened. Drew reveals a sheepish look almost like a boy being caught doing something naughty.
Surprisingly Drew’s not appalled. “I don’t remember giving the declaration of consent to participate in a study”, he fools around, eying Harry with interest.
Cas has troubles to stifle her laugh. “Harry do you even listen to yourself? Everything you say, makes it more obvious, that meeting again with Drew is a great chance you should take.”
As Cas' words continue to echo in Harry's head over the course of the next week, he knows that she is right and that he is indeed in danger of becoming stagnant in the wake of his self-imposed independence and overcautiousness, if he does not significantly and actively change his behaviour. But not only that. He notices with horror that he has developed tendencies to reject even his friends' attempts to approach him, at the latest when he only lets Ron's owl Tex in after four minutes of penetrative knocking on his window pane. A coping mechanism that is only slightly effective in avoiding having to deal with unpleasant things, such as being reminded that he may have to rethink his principles.
“Let’s continue tomorrow”, a soothing voice says. Harry nods, ready to give in to the need of sleep. But something, habit, withholds him. “I should leave”, he replies. Not quite a convincing statement, when the utterer barley moves one inch, not to speak of his closed eyelids.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d think you want to seduce me”, Drew snorts incredulously, voice hoarse.
He clears his throat, miming interest in the rest of the room to put a few steps of space between him and Drew without lacking a justification other than social uneasiness. "Did you play Quidditch at school?" he asks casually as he surveys a cast-iron watering can with exaggerated attention.
Harry blinks, slightly tilting his head, question mark virtually written on his face. He definitely senses the mood of being hit on, though
Drew's gaze hardens, piercing eyes indicating the willingness of a just as sharp tongue to punish any further humiliating utterances threatening his pride, but on the next breath the clenched jaw gives way to an embarrassed smile. "Do you blame me?"
Falk turns around, and grins immediately. "Nice man, outdoing yourself with your choice this time, huh?" Harry notices Falk’s approving gaze roaming over his body. Though he knows it's not targeted at him as Harry, it's strange having a good friend look at you with 'those' eyes.
"What's he supposed to do? He can't do more than ask nicely without losing his dignity. And apparently it was enough. At least I haven't read anything about a Harry Potter outing."
“What is it with your hair, that it’s always a mess?”, Drew snickers and curls one of Harry’s strands around his finger.
"No. Only muggle plants. I certainly despised herbology at Hogwarts. But boringly normal muggle plants? Ironically their unagitated nature fascinate me. They and I can exist in a quiet calm co-existence. I spend a lot of time here. No pressure or expectations due to responsibility that ever so often and inevitably arises from contact with any other life form." Drew's gaze becomes a little delirious, a slight laugh has crept onto his lips. He too has stepped closer to the ivy, too, and carefully traces the contour of one of the leaves between thumb and index finger. "Aside from watering them sometimes."
"Broom-designing is not far from it, after all”, he justifies himself nonetheless, can’t help to try and live up to the image. "I actually fly quite a lot through my work, in testing the new models, and to stay in shape, you know? I bet that this can be more strenuous and demanding than professional quidditch. Also, we actually
Harry lifts a questioning eyebrow, but plays along, doesn’t it build on their previous tomfoolery. “Never mind. The Prophet might have mentioned me in an article alongside the reporting of the Second Wizarding War. But in one way or another, weren’t we all involved?”
Usually he prefers appearances, that resemble his own to a higher degree, but from time to time he can’t resist to hustle samples from his own target group. Sometimes Harry wonders if he is some kind of pervert looking for cheap excuses to live out a strange kink. Surely enough he could just go to some muggle’s place and find a partner for the night there. In case of those occurring doubts, he usually convinces himself, that having the desire to be under his own people, was really not too much to ask for. Was he to go to Muggle London’s establishments he’d have to be on constant alert not to use magic. Choosing a change in facade appearance wise thus seems much more convenient than behaviour wise.
The narrow facial features with a straight striking nose are just remotely similar to his own angular, strong jaw and stern front. Not to speak about the hair. The bloke he is facing right now has sandy blond hair falling down in waves at the length of his chin.
“If I always look like I’m freshly shagged, I might as well actually be.” Harry observes mildly alerted that he’s returned to sheer bluntness about expressing his sexual attraction towards the man next to him.
Agitated but also mesmerized by his new body, Harry rummages through his wardrobe to look for that one pair of black jeans that usually fits a bit loose and would be a perfect fit for his current waist size. While changing he can't resist peeking in his boxers, only to find a rather normal prick hanging there, relaxed unsurprisingly.
"Always for me. Hermione gets her own food when in doubt. With her mood swings and cravings currently, it's impossible to predict in the morning what she might like in the evening anyway." He rolls his eyes, but his tone clearly shows his affectation towards her.
Along with the last sip, he stands up determinedly and walks hurriedly towards his fireplace. The only logical course of action in such a situation is to floo Ron. And Hermione, of course. But he waits in vain and his call goes unanswered. Crushed, he settles for writing an owl message asking them to floo him as soon as possible, without giving much indication of the reason for the urgent request.
"See that lad there? I was trying my best to chat him up but he assured me he’s as bent as a butcher's hook”, Cas slurs almost every word. “Not in these words though.”
“I don’t know”, Harry huffs. “Probably not through an ad in the Daily Prophet. ‘Secret childhood star seeks discreet partner for lonely hours’. Doesn’t come off too well.”
"So, you don't think I'd just like to have a nice evening with my best friends?", Harry brings the conversation back to the topic at hand.
“I can only wonder, what impression it makes on you with regard to your former experiences. As for me, I woke up with the desire to learn more about that funny, smart guy I only had the honour to share a fracture of time with yet. And if that guy happenes to be Harry Potter, I don’t mind. I don’t want to delude you, you need to trust me on that. I think you’re interesting, and I already thought so last night. So, if you’re not completely opposed to seeing someone at the moment… I’d be glad if you considered me.”
“You see, what you want to see”, Harry smirks, unsure of what exactly his motive is. If he was true to himself, he’d have to admit, that it mainly consists of asserting dominance due to hurt pride. And fear. Fear that stems from excruciating uncertainty and the palpable threat to his easy days, and manifests itself in mental faint. With every rational thinking circuit shut down, Harry’s left with is his automated no-brainer charming mode, that’s usually reserved for official ministry events and that sort. Although, admittedly, undressing lasciviously has been rather less part of his repertoire so far.
“Right,” he admits. The rush of blood literally washes all his thinking ability away. Dumbfounded he stares at Drew’s mouth, that simply looks to enticing.
Only a few minutes later, Harry had just enough time to decide whether his leftover ingredients were enough for a decent meal or whether he had to go shopping after all, there was another knock on his window and he saw the beautiful barn owl again.
"Forgive me, if I come straight out with it, I have to..." it suddenly blurts out of Drew, ending in a falter. "I was going to ask you, but was afraid you'd... mhh...," he squirms and Harry smirks.
If Harry wasn't used to his friends seeing through him every time he thinks he's cleverly hiding things from them by now, he'd probably blush with embarrassment. This way, he just laughs a little sheepishly.
“It’s fine. You are more than welcome to stay the night. I can make us coffee tomorrow.” Luring words paired with light finger strokes along the length of Harry’s body. Oh, it’s so hard to resist. But he must, he knows. It’s deeply rooted inside his brain, though he can’t muster out why to be honest.
Quickly, he fetches a piece of paper and pen (with glee, Harry has said goodbye to scrolls of paper and quills after his Hogwarts days) and scribbles a reply.
Then he waits on the sofa, keeping a steady eye on the fireplace. It can only be a matter of minutes before Cas stumbles through the opening, considering how quickly her reply to his first letter had followed.
"Up for it?" Drew murmurs in his ear. Harry’s heartbeat quickens. Everything until now was obviously just foreplay for this offer. As sure as it was to happen, now that these words are actually spoken in finality, Harry’s just as bedazzled.
“Harry. Is that really the way you feel?”, Cas asks concerned. Harry feels his throat tightening. Of course, he is aware, that his amount of mistrust towards others has come to an unnatural state, but as long as he only allowed space for this knowledge in the seclusion of his own mind, he was always able to assure himself quite convincingly that it was perfectly justified for someone who had been through what he had been through. Looking at her sad eyes he’s taught better, though.
Harry wiggles restlessly on the spot. “I don’t think it’s a good idea. I  hardly have enough time for my friends these days.”
"I didn't take you to be that type of guy", her smirk turns to a frown, "But honestly, I think people are actually more bewildered they never see you approaching anyone at all than maybe catch you with an affair."
Uneasy, he fiddles pointlessly with one of the handles of the cauldron in which a less than appetizing liquid is simmering away.
When it takes him to long to wait for Drew to come back, he gets up, too. Interested he takes for the concert piano and presses some of the keys randomly. With not one lesson of musical education since primary school it’s bound to sound enharmonic and he decides to leave the actual playing of instruments to those who have learned how to, and to remain the enjoying listener. Next stop is the fireplace, or rather, a couple of photos hung above it. They picture coastal landscapes at different weather conditions, each a perfectly looped capture of moving waves, mesmerizing Harry for a good moment. Especially the stormy weather one.
“Well, I’m not begging you”, says, yet moves in closer. Drews hand still lingers next to Harry’s head and starts to firmly rake through his hair, fastens its grip around some strands in the nape of his neck.
“Bathroom”, he utters, then runs towards the kitchenette instead, where he expects a sink to be for sure, as he’s not certain if he can bear the time loss to look out for his initially announced destination.
“Is that alright?” Drew searches for Harry’s eyes. “Fuck, I didn’t mean to take it too fast”, he adds a nervous laugh.
“One very presumptuous might say it in such a self-centred way”, Harry teases, actually liking Blondies feigned over-confidence. It’s usually an indicator for real healthy confidence.
“Uhn. After almost vomiting on his floor, we proceeded where we left off at the club and got to get each other off. No, actually only I got off. And then I fell asleep…”, he ends his illustration of the last night’s events.
Drew laughs uproariously. "No problem. I'll get you both, wait wherever you please. Preferably the bed”, Drew is unexpectedly cheerful. “Though I can't vouch for any ulterior motives not being involved in this suggestion." Drew’s careless good mood perturbs Harry, but in anticipation of his desired beverages he gets to one of the leather couches in the sitting area, and enjoys the absurdly impressive view, that kind of makes up for these otherwise messed up circumstances of his presence here.
Harry does as he's told, somewhat jerkily, under the under the misjudged slight resistance, and an unexpected amount of light floods towards him through the small gap. A little unsettled but driven mainly by curiosity, he pushes the flap completely open and scrambles up the last steps. Almost blind, he stops at the end of the stairs, his hand still resting on the banister until his eyes have adjusted to the intense light.
Instead Drew seems to have gained back composure, and all manifestation of passion fades into a simple gesture of tenderness, where his clenched fist recoils and his thumb comes upfront to lightly caress Harry’s cheeks. “I’d like to… postpone, though.”
Harry smirks. "So Nessaja is your name? Thank you for your selfless service at this ungodly hour of the day," he says, turning to the owl and stroking its feathers gently again. Nessaja chirps contentedly and presses her head a little tighter into Harry's palm. "Will you wait a moment and I'll write Cassiopeia a reply?" Nessaja nibs on his finger, which Harry takes as a "if you must, but hurry."
“Excuse me please for a moment “, Drew says and heaves himself up, and before Harry can even contemplate the change of events completely, he has gone to the toilet.
"Hey, uh, sorry, I didn't mean to hit a sore spot.” Suddenly, talking about old school days doesn't feel so nice and light-hearted after all. Or talking in general. Harry knows by now that his strong points don't exactly lie in approaching delicate topics gently.
“As you please”, Drew says and opens the door, guiding the way in a butler’s manner. Grinning fat, Harry can’t be told twice. The room is basically just a narrow short windowless hallway with a wooden spiral staircase in the middle.
Harry swallows hard. No matter how many different blokes he already had the pleasure to try out, their polyjuice potion never tasted good. But it’s a welcome torture, besides the accompanying pain, for the advantages he got out of it.
I can't tell when the next part will follow. Againt bits of it exist and atm4I'm pumped to write but I also have a social life and other responsibilities outside of ao3 (how dare I 😔)
“Well, you don’t happen to know the whereabouts of my underwear? I’m practically blind without my glasses”, Harry plays it cool. “I didn’t feel the need to bring them with me last night”, he adds.
Their first round of coffee follows a second, this time though, Drew comes down right next to Harry with their two cups. This way they might not be facing each other as comfortably as before when they sat diagonal to each other, but the change of seating has effectively closed their distance by a good 5 foot. This results in an arrangement, that suddenly facilitates lots of direct-touch related incidents including knees and other parts of extremities accidentally brushing while laughing or gesturing enthusiastically or simply shifting weight to sit differently. In this arrangement Drew has it also much easier to rest his arms on the backrest, semi-accidentally just right behind Harry. And Harry finds himself in situation, where he can lean back into such an indirect embrace definitely non-accidentally, so that his hair is destined to tickle the skin of Drew’s arm.
Soon their somewhat artificial small talk turns to more profound chatter about various topics. Harry learns that Drew went to Hogwarts, too, two years below him, making him 22 now, and was sorted into Slytherin. As an only child of a pureblood family (who would have thought), as Drew told with slight disdain in his voice, his parents moved to France as soon as the return of Voldemort was no longer deniable after the fight at the ministry. He didn’t come back to complete his education in England though, ans stayed at Beauxbatons, even after the war was over, but returned to England for 4 ago to start working at the financial department at the Ministry. Harry also learns that Drew’s favourite colour is green, and that he has been playing the piano for 15 years, and that he knows not even half of Harry’s favourite music groups and artist, be they wizarding or muggle, despite his musical background. This lack of vital knowledge however rather itches Harry to immediately apparate them to his flat and show Drew his excessive CD and Vinyl collection instead of diminishing his picture of him. That might be also due to the fact that all while talking, Drew emanates the aura of someone who feels comfortable in their skin, infecting Harry to do so, too. Something Harry yearns for.
Harry gives him a quick look, then retreats back to the photographs. “I like them. Where were they taken?”
"I had a really good time tonight”, he practically beams, cheeks slightly flushed. “I wouldn’t mind to repeat this sometime in the future.”
"I understand. I'll see you later then," Harry laughs, getting up to throw another pinch of floopowder into the fireplace and disappearing into the fire for work.
Harry can well imagine Siora eagerly and at the same time desperately fluttering up and down the pane, hoping to find an opening or at least a surface to land on.
He can’t treat this like a whimsical pick up, can he? He wouldn’t know, and he needn’t know, because the announced assault isn’t put into practice.
"You don't happen to remember where you snatched that sample of hair, do you?", Falk asks without even trying to disguise his attraction.
"Uhh," Harry stammers. "I feel the same when I fly. I think." He turns, becoming aware of Drew's proximity to himself, but also unable to establish any more distance because of the plants behind him, so he has to look up somewhat uncomfortably to make eye contact with Drew. Not the most flattering constellation.
“Harry, I mustn’t! I already said too much. Even if I knew, which I uprightly don’t, I wouldn’t tell you. And I will not try to find out. That would only make it more uncomfortable.”
The moment the door opens, he stands up, ready to face Drew. Or so he thought. In regret about his hasty movement, he holds tight to whatever his hands touch first as his eyes go black and he roams the air for grip. Harry hopes for wall. Instead Drew turns out to be ‘whatever his hands touch first’. More precisely his satin dressing gown, that feels no less pricy then the trousers Harry’s snitched.
Harry smiles. "Great, my proposal for the Nimbus 3000 got accepted. I'll probably get a big ass bonus and will be head leader of the development team.”
“Up we go”, said mate murmurs, lifting Harry up again. Now that he’s pantsless the friction of his own prick against the soft fabric of Drew’s still clothed crotch allows to feel up the other’s hardened length. Combined with those hands shamelessly groping his ass, finger tips suspiciously close to the crease, Harry forgets the interruption in their flow of sexual actions again. Riled up, he ruts the other man’s torso, not taking note to where he’s carried to. He realizes when the grip underneath him weakens, and he’s half-thrown on a mattress, though.
Smiling, he looks after the little ural owl. For a long time, Harry had struggled with himself, refusing almost on principle to accept another owl than Hedwig in his life. The fact that Siora finally moved in with him was more a coincidence than a conscious decision. He had discovered her injured during a test flight for the prototype of the Nimbus 3000, at that time still almost a chick, she seemed to have fallen out of the nest and been abandoned by the mother bird. He couldn't have possibly left her behind, and so he took the little bird with him, with the idea of just fattening her up at home and releasing her into the wild as soon as she was fully grown. But Siora had other plans, she had become too accustomed to Harry's company, probably too domesticated to survive in the wild, and Harry had no choice but to keep her with him. That there was no reluctance left in the end on his side, he was happy to leave unmentioned, when asked. It still felt a bit like betraying Hedwig, and sometimes he wonders for how long it will.
It turns out his panic reaction was exaggerated, and his little sporting dedication was enough to soothe his stomach. As cool as possible he turns around, leans against the counter, acts as if nothing happened. “Nice flat you got here.”
Instead Harry’s left with complete satisfaction, drifting away into a mellow and dense world of sweet drowsiness, filled with pure gratification and contentment. Gone is every sex drive that has driven him insane just minutes ago. He shuts his eyes, inhales deeply, humming in post-orgasm snugness.
"As I see it, there are two possible outcomes. If today’s experience meets your expectations, it might encourage you to proceed in manifesting a betting habit. Which I don’t want to be the cause of. Whereas when I provide you with lousy experiences today, you might never want to try it with me or anybody again."
Idk, i just tend to build my stories that way, it seems. Next chapter there will be more actual interaction and progress, I promise.
In helplessness because of his current poor eyesight, he fishes for whatever piece of clothes lies in front of him on the floor. The touch of the fabric alone tells him, that he was not successful in catching one of his. He’s never really had high quality wool in his hands, so Harry wouldn’t know exactly the value of this piece of tweed trousers in his hands. But he’s certain, it must be very pricy. And that it’s indeed a pair of trousers.
"All right. Since I can't deny it any longer... the best thing is to start with Saturday before last. You know the arrangements I tend to go with when celebrating." Ron and Hermione exchange a look that makes it clear how they feel about it, but don't comment further. Harry decides not to comment further either and continues to recount the events of the evening and the next morning in a censored version, including the fact that Drew is keeping his real name a secret.
“Feel free to…”, Harry moans, tempted. He can’t remember the last time he’s been visually consumed this brazenly, been yearned for this evidently. As pent up as he is, it comes as no surprise to him, when just a few unpolished slides along his shaft are enough to almost take him above the edge.
Harry starts an inept handshake, but in the process decides on a hug, which ends in an awkward laugh-provoking mess. “Thank you for putting up with me.”
“Oh Merlin, Harry! You didn’t, you wanker”, she giggles, which he acknowledges with an disapproving eye.
“Sadly not. I only know of ways to mess it up even more”, he gives Harry an auspicious look. “Which might not be in your best interest.”
“Hey, you little nut case. How come Harry’s being spared?”, Hermione nags. “He wouldn’t leave Maggie alone until she gave him an unreasonable number of pellets for his ‘services’. I shushed him away. Ouch”, she wails, as Peagreen decided to retaliate her snide comment and started to peck on her hair. “Well, he obviously took a grudge on me for that.”
"What a question? Isn’t that what I am here for? For  you to spill some tea," she says, plopping down on his sofa.
"I can," murmurs Ron, who had arrived a few seconds before her, but immediately appeases any commotion from his wife in the bud with an affectionate kiss on the cheek. He nevertheless earns a small peck in the side for his joke.
“Good idea”, she calls out with sparkling eyes. Here is where Harry’s resilience snaps. Her support until now has been enriching and uplifting, but the mass of unpleasant confrontations this day has reached a level that first needs rest and time to process, before any more content can follow.
Harry's stomach still makes uncomfortable hops when he thinks of her first return from Drew. First, she was gone for considerably longer than it would normally take to get from his flat to Soho and back, and then it looked like she was coming with no news either. It wasn't until she had settled on Harry's shoulder and claimed a few cuddles that she dropped a small note from her beak. It contained four simple words
“You okay?”, Drew asks since despite the fact that he is still standing in the kitchenette at the other end of the room, Harry's unusual capture by his wand can be openly observed.
Sure, when he realized he was more or less homosexual, he was all excited about exploring and gaining new experiences rather than jumping straight into a relationship. His new work at Nimbus Racing Broom Company. claimed almost all of his leisure at that time, only amplifying his lack of commit. And after all, both had been reasons he and Ginny didn't work out and though they remained as friends, it was a breakup he had to overcome, nonetheless.
“Sometimes. I can always apparte to some coastline if I feel like it, though. English one’s of course. The continent’s a bit too far.” He reminisces. “But yes. Living in a small cottage stands in stark contrast to London. Sometimes for the better, sometimes not. Depends on what state of mind you’re in.”
“Well actually I was going to say for you to go ahead. I just want to… erm, clear up here... it’s the other door near the front door where you came in, the room opposite this. Just sit anywhere, make yourself at home and I’ll be right there.” Harry said casually but Draco couldn’t help feel like he might be up to something, still who was he to argue.
“You want to start by telling me who ‘she’ is? Another witch who wanted to be the future Mrs. Potter I presume?” Draco said with slightly raised eyebrows. He knew it was selfish and stupid to think like this but secretly he was quite glad Harry wasn’t at all interested in woman. At least Draco wouldn’t have to worry about their advances. Not that he didn’t trust Harry, it was just hard to let his jealous side go sometimes.
How is it that he could be revisiting past childhood trauma with the man one minute and then laughing and joking with him feeling completely at ease the next… all while holding his bloody hand!
Not that they’d gone straight to sleep mind, there had definitely been a lot of kissing, touching and groping each other like horny teenagers before they’d finally given into their urges and given each other magnificent simultaneous handjobs. Harry’s technique was without fault, Draco’s only hoped his was satisfactory too but judging on the look on Harry’s face it had been.
I know I could do more regular updates with shorter chapters but I want to keep the story consistent and also this all happens in one day from Draco's perspective so it's just the way the chapters are working out.
Fred started choking on his food and George gave him a bit of a look and then quickly replaced it with a distracting grin and a big dramatic slap on the back.
“Oh, yeah, sorry.” Draco said a bit sheepishly. “I told Blaise but I forgot I never told you. I’ve been working with them for months and they told me about this place. How did you think I knew about it?”
“Anytime.” Draco said seriously. “I think that’s quite a good method of relieving stress and I’m more than happy to help.”
“Yeah I meant ‘let’s not get married’ next week not ‘let’s not ever touch each other’” Draco said, making his desire for Harry very clear.
I'm having so much fun writing this and I'm definitely getting carried away but I hope you like it as much as I do! xD
“What were the details of this… arrangement exactly?” He asked, still slightly holding Harry’s hand but not looking at him. “And did anyone else know about it? Apart from George of course who I’m assuming did.”
George thought about this for a moment and nodded. “Yeah I wouldn’t be surprised at that either to be honest. Something definitely went on with his family, I mean we all know what his parents are like… So, erm, what did she say then when you mentioned me?” He added casually.
He realised that he hadn’t spoken in a while and Blaise and Daphne were still looking at him with satisfied expressions.
When he walked into the reception area he was relieved to find it completely empty. There was no one in the office either and sure enough, Draco’s laptop bag was still behind the desk propped up against the wall. He was just opening it to double check the laptop and the charger were inside when he heard voices at reception.
Harry was shaking his head at Blaise in an exasperated way. “You realise that photo of us arm in arm will be on the cover of Witch Weekly tomorrow now don’t you?!”
Draco immediately tensed up and Harry rushed on really not wanting to start things off on the wrong foot.
“Last night was a bit of an exception.” Harry said, smiling properly now. “I’ll stick to my side I promise.”
“Ginny showed a bit of an interest in me too in sixth year and I do remember thinking that she was pretty and maybe I should ask her out but again it was more just because I thought I should rather than I actually wanted to if that makes sense? Plus I was kind of terrified of dating again and I had girls trying to slip me love potions… I just wasn’t really that interested in being with anyone quite honestly… Then I got a bit distracted, you know with the evil wizard who was trying to kill me and take over the world so that put dating on the back burner for a bit!” Harry ran his hand through his hair and laughed nervously.
“I just- I want to bring something to this friendship too, I don’t want to just take and not give you anything back.” Draco said being more honest with Blaise than he had been in a while.
As he arrived back home early afternoon on Monday after helping Molly clean up the Burrow a bit. Just as he sat down in the lounge his mind wandered back to it’s favourite topic at the moment: Draco. He wondered whether Draco had read the scrolls Harry had given him yet and what he thought about them if he had. How long would it take for him to read and digest them? How would he feel about what he read? When would he floo call and what would happen when he did?
Draco couldn’t help notice the ever so subtle look of Harry’s eyes though as they wandered briefly down the neckline of his T-shirt and over his chest. Blaise really was good, he’d have to thank him for his later.
Harry flashed him a dashing smile again that almost made his heart stop. “You’re welcome.” He replied clearly still amused by the situation.
“Erm, well listen you can’t tell anyone about this, anyone outside the family that is. It’s not public knowledge and I’m not sure if Draco will ever want to reveal that or not but he is Pierre. Draco made your birthday gift, it’s his business.”
Harry chuckled as Teddy’s hair turned the bright blue it always did when he wanted to play. “Yes Teddy you can go play.”
“Yeah this house was the headquarters for the Order during the war so we had meetings here and then all ate together afterwards. Obviously I wasn’t at all the meetings but yeah we were here a few times and we spent Christmas here that year too.”
Daphne came to his rescue as always. “I’m afraid it’s my fault Harry. You see I rather put a halt to the plan when I told the boys here that I’d rather stay where I am. Now that Blaise and I have made my grandmother’s old house our home we both find that we rather like it.”
“Anything?” Harry croaked out with a slightly hoarse voice as he raised his glance to look Draco straight in the eye.
Her black tight curly hair was piled up high on top of her head poking out the top of a thick colourful scarf she had tied around her head in a ridiculously large bow. Her plain black t-shirt showed off her curves and was tucked into a bright floor length skirt that was a completely different pattern to the one on her head scarf. The two fabrics really shouldn’t go together but somehow she made them work.
“I have sent a field team to bring in Mr. Malfoy. Based on Harry’s report we can hold him under suspicion for forty eight hours. I gather you wish to commit him to St. Mungo’s as a mentally unstable criminal?”
Harry could feel the warmth of the early morning sun rise through the gaps in the wooden shutters. He could feel the comfort of the bed beneath him which was just the right firmness. His whole body felt relaxed and his mind was calm too. He wasn't thinking about anything and it was refreshing.
“Well I don’t actually know, she said a couple of days but, well I don’t think she wants to be alone in the Manor its… it’s not actually a nice place.” Draco said in a sombre tone. “Mother wanted to decorate after the war but father wouldn’t let her. Everything still looks the same and it- it brings back bad memories I guess.”
“You’re welcome, my sweet-toothed Prince.” Harry said quietly, taking his hand under the table and giving it a gentle squeeze.
“I’m not some fanboy who just wants to kiss Harry Potter so he can sell the story to the Prophet, you know that. If anything, your fame puts me off!” Draco continued half joking.
That, he realised, was the source of this unexpected sad jealousy that possessed him. Who would he have? Who could possibly love him like that? It wasn’t just the two of them either, was it? The little crowd of redheads halfway down the hall now turned to look at the pair in the entrance and beckoned them over. They were a true family, united in love with a future they could all look forward to. They had won and would be seen as heros of the wizarding world now, all of them. Draco hadn’t won, and he certainly wasn’t a hero. He had wanted the cold, snake-faced bastard dead that was for sure, but he had still been on the wrong side of this war, hadn’t he? Even in a room full of people with his mother’s hand on his knee and his father’s arm around his shoulders, he still felt alone and the brief, tiny feeling of happiness he had allowed himself to feel slipped away.
Draco turned round to look at him properly again though and he had a slight frown on his face. “You mean… during the war? When you were on the run?”
Harry decided that if their new friendship couldn’t overcome this first small hurdle then it definitely wouldn’t hold up to the bigger things to come. He may as well jump in with both feet and give the chapters to Draco. He was a brave Gryffindor after all, isn’t that what they did?! Or maybe it would turn out to be foolish, time would tell.
“You.” Harry said quietly pressing his forehead against Draco’s. “I never cared before whether I lived or died, not really. I know that might be selfish, I know there are people in my life that would care but I guess I’m only just realising how much. I would always value anyone else’s life above my own, risk my life for a complete stranger and… well I’m not saying I wouldn’t now exactly but I’d at least stop and think about it because…” Harry swallowed thickly. “Because I don’t want to leave you. Because I, er, I think you’d be... upset if I died or I was hurt and I never want to upset you. I want to be here for you, I want to be alive for you.”
Not sure if Harry's reason/motivation for going upstairs is explained enough... I know it seems a bit stupid of him when Draco specifically tells him to wait in the office but I don't think it's exactly OOC for Harry to get something in his head and rush into it without really thinking about it and it did come from a good place.
Harry found it really nice to catch up with his old Quidditch captain again and Ron was gushing around him constantly talking about the epic saves the star had made that day. Clearly he was very happy about his sister’s new boyfriend despite the fact that he was usually very protective of her. Charlie was in charge of the BBQ and Harry eagerly agreed to help him out. Molly was sorting out the salad and cold food with Hermione’s help and Fleur started putting everything ready on the buffet table before Bill took over insisting that his wife should sit down and rest.
Plus a surprise new look for Harry! Wonder what brought that on?! Maybe he's trying to impress someone?!
“Oh yeah it was this radio show that Lee ran to give people news on the war, rally the resistance, spread hope, give people a few laughs you know… it was brilliant. Sad too of course… that’s how I heard about Ted Tonks…” He trailed off.
When Draco caught sight of Harry though his expression turned back into one of mischievous glee. “Looking good Potter.” He teased eyeing his chest and then trailing his eyes down to the stupid shorts.
“I see what you mean Mother and I don’t disagree. The house could do with a lift and of course, your company would be welcome too, but, you know that you can borrow my wand any time you like Mother. You lent me yours when I needed it and it’s my fault you don’t have one anymore-”
That was the last thing he remembered as he felt something hit him in his own back and another two forces of magic on his front.
“You haven’t held me back at all.” Harry carried on. “I don’t always respond to people when they push me but you always know how and when I need it. You’ve always been there for me and always known what to do in whatever mood I’m in which isn't easy when I don’t know myself! I don’t think I could have survived these last few years and got to this point where I’m ready to do this now without you. In fact I know I wouldn’t. I wasn’t ready for a proper relationship but I didn’t want to be alone either. If anything I feel like I’ve been using you and I guess I was worried that you would think I was just dumping you now that I didn’t need you anymore or something.”
Draco obviously loved a compliment and was no longer looking nervous. Harry decided to push him a little further as he trailed his hand down Draco’s left arm to the one thing that was interrupting his view of Draco’s naked upper body. His hands stopped and rested lightly on the wand holster attached to Draco’s forearm and he felt Draco stiffen slightly.
Harry spoke more about how Draco had changed and what their friendship looked like. He even told Ron that Draco had written apology letters and that Hermione had found hers quite sincere and enlightening. Harry explained he wanted to talk to Ron first but that his letter was waiting for him at home in Hermione’s safe hands.
One thing I really did want to do with this fic is just be accepting of all different types of relationships and explore a few of them so hopefully I've done that.
“Locket.” Harry answered Daraco’s unanswered question softly. “Guess you could say it was cursed. I’ll tell you about it when we get there.”
“Well your behaviour has been slightly unusual today Draco” Narcissa pointed out in her formal emotionless tone. “You didn’t come to breakfast this morning and then you left without telling us where you were going. Now you’re back but you came straight up here without greeting us.”
“There’s nothing to discuss. Tell me what he wants and I’ll make it but I’m not seeing him.” Draco said, crossing his arms stubbornly. He couldn’t believe Daphne would make this appointment.
“I know, it’s just it hasn’t been that long since me and you… and I don’t know if you’re really OK…” Harry trailed off awkwardly avoiding Fred’s eye.
“Oh that’s good.” Harry said wondering why he suddenly felt a tiny surge of jealousy that the twins would see Draco again before he did. That’s weird.
“Yes.” His mother said slowly, her face set back to it’s calm demeanour. “With hindsight that does seem like a bit of an oversight. Perhaps that’s something you can correct when you have your own children Draco?” She said as her face returned to a bit of a smirk.
“I bought these for you.” Draco said quickly, passing him a black box with a thin gold trim and wrapped up in a thick gold ribbon.
“Well now you have to us.” Hermione pointed out as Ron leaned forward eagerly and said “tell us what?”
“Right, fair enough, what will it be then?” Harry said keeping his voice steady determined to forget the stupid little moment his brain had and trying to just be friends with Draco. That was all he wanted, friendship. So far Draco seemed more receptive to the idea of them being friends than he had at the start of Daphne’s dinner. Harry wondered what had changed.
Today though, despite going through his recipe precisely step up step it just wasn’t going the perfect shade of pink and he didn’t know why. He worked solidly all day refusing Daphne entry and lunch and not stopping to eat himself. Yet at the end of the day he had nothing to show for it and he angrily vanished the mess of broken things and unusable potions. He was so frustrated that he punched the black tiled wall and then immediately regretted it as he almost passed out in pain. He’d never been good at coping with pain.
Then panic rose though him suddenly. Shit, had he said that out loud? By the slightly confused but amused look that Harry was giving him and the smirk on Blaise’s face then yes, he most definitely had said it out loud, well wasn’t that mortifying.
“I thought it would be nice if I cooked, like properly. I’ve never cooked a three course dinner party meal before.” Harry did seem like he really liked the idea. “I’ve never done dessert to be honest but Kreacher can help me a bit with that. I’ll eat with you, obviously, but when they arrive you can have some time with them and have a few drinks and nibbles or whatever while I’m in the kitchen and I’ll kind of be hoping in and out of the kitchen all night so it should give you plenty of time to bitch about me to them when I’m out of earshot.”
“Well I don’t want it any more… Draco said he’s not going to make it for me anyway but- I- well, I want to prove that I’m not, I just-”
As Draco entered the courtroom he could feel all the eyes of the Wizengamot upon him. They were all sitting in a semicircle at the front of the room and in the middle of them all was a high box where the Minister himself, Kingsley Shacklebolt sat. Savage was stood by another box opposite Kinglsey but on the ground level and gestured to Draco clearly wanting him to take a seat in it. Draco felt numb and he wasn’t sure his legs were working anymore but after a little prod in the back by one of the other aurors he found himself walking forwards and taking a seat.
An old very ugly house elf who was pretty hunched over walked into view. He peered into the fire with a very curious expression.
“That’s because he avoided me like the plague all year.” Harry said seriously. “Another thing that pissed me off.”
“You know the eldest Weasley married Fleur Delacour right? She’s gorgeously blonde. They have two adorable daughters, George showed me some little photos that he has in his wallet, such a family man it’s really cute.” Daphne’s tone had turned hideously girly and quite unlike her which caused Draco and Blaise to look at each other with mock exasperated look. “Anyway the eldest is blonde and looks just like her mother so it is possible. Even the younger girl who has red hair is so pretty, it’s really more strawberry blonde than orange. Oh I forgot to tell you, their baby boy was born during the after party they had on Sunday night! Can you believe it?!”
“But I fucked up.” Harry said as he slowly sat up. “You were angry at me, I thought you’d hate me… how did I end up sleeping here?” He said, confused.
Once he would have been wary of that question as he struggled to be open and vulnerable with people but his relaxed attitude island life had given him made such things much easier now. Besides Harry had opened up to him a bit already and Draco found himself wanting to know more, wanting to ask more. It was only natural therefore that Harry was thinking the same of him in return. So far the deeper, more serious chats they’d shared had been eye-opening and beneficial for both of them.
“Pinky shall inform Mistress that Master is awake and then Pinky will fetch Master Draco’s favourite sir.”
Maybe Draco did understand though as he seemed to pause quite significantly at Harry’s words and then he looked up and smiled at him. One of those soft, slightly shy and desperately genuine smiles.
Well here he was sitting in Daphne’s sitting room sipping champagne with her, Blaise and Harry bloody Potter who apparently he was now supposed to call Harry. That wouldn’t do at all, he’d have to just not address him. Hearing his own name in Potter’s voice was strange but to make matters worse the man looked damn good and was making Draco feel underdressed which he hated. He didn’t exactly have an abundance of expensive clothes to choose from now and didn’t feel like he had to wear a jacket but Potter was wearing the most exquisite emerald green suit jacket that looked annoyingly good on him.
“Right well, shall we go through for Dinner?” Daphne said after another couple of minutes of polite conversation and the champaged had all been drunk.
There is a bit of Daphne at the beginning in this chapter but things for the next few chapters will be mostly focusing on Harry and Draco. Don't worry though all the side characters will still be around and I'll definitely include some more fun and fluff with them throughout too. Trying to get the right balance! :)
After dinner each day they sat in the lounge and watched the teller vision box on the wall. Draco’s new favourite thing was just to watch the muggle news, he found it fascinating to hear the day to day things going on in a world literally right around him in London but he knew nothing about. It made him realise how sheltered he’d been really. Even if some things they covered in the news were quite sad.
“You mean crumpets?” He said with a smile and watched Draco flush slightly with embarrassment. “Well you know how to use the toaster so the principle is the same for anything. I stocked up at the bakery yesterday so we now have bread and bagels too if you’d prefer those.”
“Remember how I told you that some adults like me like men and some like... Uncle Bill like women-” He started slowly.
“Oooh good you bought food! I’m starving!” George said standing and taking the tupperware boxes from Harry.
It was quiet for a moment until Harry spoke still with a possessive arm around Draco’s waist that Draco loved. “So, yeah sorry I’m crashing your evening guys but Rose and Hermione are a bit under the weather so I thought I’d cook for you all. I’ll leave you with Draco though while I return to the kitchen. Make yourselves at home and I’ll get some drinks and nibbles going in a bit.”
“I think it will, I want to read it when it’s done and I’m always here if you want to talk through anything but I understand why you couldn’t say things before.” Fred said putting his hand on Harry’s leg under the duvet in comfort.
His mind was wandering again… It didn’t help that when he did look back over at Harry he was still topless. Fuck, he looked good.
“This is your home- no, our home, remember Harry? You’ve told me often enough.” Draco said with a smile and then it faded slightly as he turned to Narcissa. “Mother didn’t mean anything by it, did you?”
“It was… and adjustment but mostly just in a physical way not an emotional way.” Harry started explaining. “I have always loved Fred but just in the way you love Blaise I suppose, it was never a romantic love and it never could be between us, we both knew that. I thought, maybe once, that I could fall in love with him in time but he was adamant that we weren’t suited to each other in that way and I realised that he was right. Fred was good to me as a friend but in the same way that George was- is rather. They both are just so non-judgemental which is where they differ from Ron and Hermione and they really cheer me up but that’s just their friendship and I still have that.”
You can also see lots more inspiration on my Pinterest board including other pictures of the date setting the scenes a bit!
Harry, Fred and George all came down behind him laughing and then George said goodbye as he went to go find Graham in the storage room. Fred was about to go back into the shop when Harry called out asking for a shield cloak. Fred popped into the shop to grab one and then chucked it to Harry from the door. He winked at them both and then returned to work.
“No… I guess not.” Harry said, slowly coming to a realisation. “Wow, it’s so refreshing to be with someone who doesn’t know. Who doesn’t treat me like some celebrity… I just-” He cut himself off and another long sip of his drink followed by a deep breath.
Harry wasn’t planning on this, that had been one of the reasons he’d come here instead of going home, but now finding this place empty too he couldn’t help himself. He just needed to stop feeling for a little while, stop thinking. He summoned a bottle of firewhiskey from the kitchen whilst walking over to the sofa. Except as it came towards him he realised he’d summoned it too strongly, too fiercely and it wasn’t controlled, it wasn’t stopping.
“I’m serious Draco, I don’t know what I would have done exactly… but if- if my mother was alive, I’d have protected her at all costs. Yes I would have still tried to save everyone of course, but if anyone knows that whatever you do you can’t save everyone then it’s me.” Harry said quietly.
“Of course I did.” Draco said in a bit of a sulky way. “It’s all I’ve ever wanted really, I tried to impress you when I first met you. I just didn’t know that those things wouldn’t be impressive to you.”
Draco should have known, he’d provoked Harry into getting angry because he’d wanted a shouting match, he was angry and he needed to let his feelings out but that wasn’t something Harry could do. Harry couldn’t control his emotions, his magic. It looked like he’d tried to control it and it had been too much for him.
“Plus the mini lunch date he took you on the other day, and you said he popped into the shop on Monday so by my count that means you’ve seen him four times in the last six days.” Draco said with a crafty smile.
“I thought the house elves always bathed me.” He realised too late that it was probably the wrong thing to say that as his mother shifted awkwardly.
Draco reached over the table to take Harry’s hand. “You already give me everything I could ever want Harry.” He said softly. “But a garden would be nice, I have to admit I miss being outdoors sometimes, I actually really liked the grounds at the Manor, more so than the actual house, and to swim again would be… well it would be good,”
“Very well, it has been established that you became a Death Eater through force not by choice. On this, I think the Wizengamot can all agree” Kingsley stated and there were various encouraging nods from the benches surrounding him. “We have also received two written character statements from Auror Williamson and Auror Proudfoot on your conduct over the past four weeks that will now be passed around.”
Just as Harry said his name just as another group of people walked right past the box they were standing in and Draco could hear them chatting away behind him.
He looked up at Harry who was giving him the biggest smile and there seemed to be a couple of different feelings behind those eyes.
Her voice didn’t have any pity in it though, he couldn’t have coped with that but it had tenderness and love, like a mother’s love. It was that more than anything which made the tears roll down his cheeks. Draco had been trying to deny it for so long but as long as he could remember all he really wanted was someone to take care of him.
Harry sighed. “It’s not about being weak, I’m sure you could take Lucius but there’s a reason why even the best field aurors work in pairs. Please Draco, promise me you’ll make your safety a priority. If you don’t care enough about yourself to do it for you then keep yourself safe for Blaise and for Daphne, they care about you... and do it for your business, you’ve worked hard to get to this point, don’t throw it away now by being careless or stubborn.”
“No Daphne, you’ll have to cancel it or just take the meeting yourself, make something up I don’t care!” Draco’s mind was racing. Had Potter really been here in his shop?! That seemed so surreal.
“I always thought it was the most interesting year and in some ways it was my favourite because of how different it was, even though I was struggling with my own personal dilemma all year… but your version makes my version look boring I swear..” Draco clarified. “The first task was pretty exciting to watch and the Yule Ball was something different obviously that most of the school were thrilled about but the second and third task were pretty boring from a spectator’s perspective.”
Draco walked past Harry into the kitchen and lightly touched the tray. He looked at it with such fondness and surprise that it made Harry’s heart ache again. He didn’t think Draco was used to people looking after him like this but Harry very much hoped that Draco would let him. He wanted to be the one who took care of him.
When Teddy eventually came out his teacher explained to Harry that she needed to have a talk with the whole class as there had been some bullying going on but she proudly told Harry that Teddy had stuck up to the bully and told him that he was being too mean to the other boy. Harry also told Teddy that he was proud of him for trying to stop the bully and as a special treat he apparated them both to Hogsmeade to get some treats from Honeydukes before coming back to Grimmauld Place.
That calmed Potter’s fire, although Draco didn’t know why it had but his eyes were lookly softly at him again.
Harry felt nervous though. Did he want to date? He tucked into his beef to give him an excuse to think and not talk for a moment.
“I’m fine, it was only a little bit.” Said Draco irritably but silently agreeing with her. “What do you mean he knows who I really am?!” He barked.
I realise I probably should have posted the chapters more spread out like I'd originally intended to so I had a chance to write the rest but I find it so hard to sit on a chapter once it's written! However, as I'm back to work now my life is a lot busier than it was when I started this story which unfortunately means I don't get as much time to write :(
walk away and give Harry privacy, he really should only his feet wouldn’t move. It was the moaning that kept him rooted to the spot. God, those sounds that Harry was making were sinful. Draco could feel himself getting hard all over again. Why on earth had he thought that one wank would solve his little ‘problem’ around Harry.
There had been this intense energy between the two of them yesterday which was like nothing he’d ever felt before. He had felt the heat of arousal before of course, although admittedly that was a lot stronger with Harry than anyone else too, but this had been more than sexual tension, it had been a strong personal connection drawing them together. He never thought he could find anyone that he could be completely himself around and who would understand him fully, yet now he couldn’t help but think Harry could be that person.
Harry looked relieved that Draco wasn’t annoyed and smiled slightly. “It wasn’t that hard to be fair. Teddy’s a clever and curious child, he’s always had lots of questions and we, well I guess it is mainly Dromeda, especially in the early years but I’m trying to be more involved now… anyway we’ve always been very honest with him. He already knew I was gay as much as it is possible for a seven year old to know these things. You don’t mind then? That they know?”
He rolled his eyes at Blaise dramatically as if he was being over the top but he stuck his hand out to him with a genuine smile nonetheless.
When Harry spoke again it was low and quiet. He’s lost the commanding tone to his voice and was literally pleading with Draco. “Draco, please don’t, I can cope with it OK, whatever is there, I just need a clear head to tackle it and I won’t have one if you’re there. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
It was odd lying to Fred, he never did it. If there was something he didn’t want to say then he usually just told Fred that he didn’t want to talk about it and Fred would accept it and move on. However, Harry couldn’t shake the fact that Fred was hiding something about the new shopkeeper opposite and his auror side of him just couldn’t quite let it go even though he had no idea why it bothered him.
“Erm no.” Harry said. “I, er, I’ve decided that I’m ready for a proper relationship. I- er, well I’d still like to get married and have a family one day like you guys, just cos I’m gay doesn’t mean I can’t have that, so, er I’ve decided I’d like to start dating properly.”
find it and I knew the moment he did.” Harry confessed. “For months I’d been trying to think how I could stop him from getting it as how the
Draco managed to successfully bury all thoughts, feelings and emotions about Harry, the book and Lucius for a couple of days. He focused on his work, brewing all day and evening Monday until late without even stopping to eat. He knew if he stopped he would think. Meditation and yoga worked well before bed to keep everything locked away and he slept well enough despite the cheap lumpy mattress still bothering him.
“By the looks of it they’ll be off having a private dinner of their own next weekend.” Blaise said with his signature smirk and suggestive eyebrow.
Lunch was lovely and Draco knew Blaise was doing it because he cared about Draco and wanted to treat him today but towards the end Draco was getting restless thinking of the difficult task he had ahead of him. How would his father react when Draco told him he had his own plans and he wasn’t going to blindly follow the ‘Malfoy’ way anymore. He wasn’t scared of his father, the worst that would happen was that they would duel and Draco thought he could take the man, even if he was a bit out of practice. He knew that his father wouldn’t kill or seriously harm him as his only heir was too precious to him for that but he might try and keep him in the Manor by force somehow.
“Right, I’m ready.” He announced before giving Draco a once over. He paused slightly and looked at him again.
“I remember.” Harry said quietly. He also remembered what was going on in his head when he saw the look Draco gave him and how he had also imagined what Draco had just looked like in the shower.
“I was so horrible to you, I- I said some really mean things about your life, your childhood, your muggle home and- and your parents... I am so sorry… I thought you were this glorified, pompous, arrogant, hero child who loved being famous and the treatment that came with it... I thought you had a really easy life just cruising through with people treating you like royalty and giving you what you wanted… I was- I was jealous. Life had never been easy for me, I had to work so hard for everything, and I still never got the praise I wanted… I was never good enough… Yet here you were with everyone treating you like you were amazing and I didn’t see it at first… I didn’t think you were anything special… Everyone was lavishing praise on you… everyone loved you... no one loved me unconditionally like that, no one… but now I find out that your childhood had been like that… and it kind of makes sense now… the scrawny kid with the baggy clothes who didn’t seem to understand about the world of magic and was useless in class… and why you were so curious to know everything, I guess because you’d gone years without knowing… I just thought you were nosy and wanted to make everything about you... I can’t even… I am so- so sorry Harry.”
“So you and him… you’re together? You’re not just helping him out or being his friend. You’re- you’re a couple.” Again he wasn't really sure if that was a question or not.
Daphne nodded. “Yes it does seem rather odd doesn’t it?! I always thought he was a bit of a bumbling idiot at school but there must be more to him than that.”
Clearly he did care what Draco thought of his appearance at the very least then. There was a slight moment as they were looking at each other where Draco wondered what it would be like to kiss Harry. Of course he’d thought this before but now he was imagining it without the glasses in the way and with the feel of Harry’s beard against his smooth skin. Hmm…
Dinner was quiet and awkward. Harry was happy to let Kreacher do all the work for once as not knowing how to act or what to say in his own home felt exhausting enough. It would be a long week if Narcissa wasn’t going to relax around him but Harry had already got one stubborn blonde to open up so he was determined he could do it again.
“No.” Draco replied, putting his laptop on the floor and starting to gather what he needed. “My friend has the best hangover cure. I’m making it for you.”
“I have a… friend, who is, well, he’s amazing really, he’s always… there for me but he’s not my boyfriend or anything.” Harry spoke not looking at Daphne but concentrating on spreading his own pâté.
His words trailed off and he sighed. Draco scooted closer to him on the sofa. They turned slightly to face each other and Harry fell into Draco’s welcoming arms. He rubbed little soothing circles on Harry’s back as he held him.
Fred cracked a small smile. “Ah of course, who else could drive our Harry to such a state?! So it’s true then?” He asked softly, still looking at Harry.
Daphne knocked on the back door at 8:50 as she always did and Draco once again checked to make sure it was definitely her before letting her in. He supposed one day he should key her into the wards so she could let herself in but so far he was too paranoid to do that just yet. It wasn’t like he didn’t spend every day here so he could let her in quite easily.
He reached out and stroked the side of Harry’s face pushing his ridiculous hair out of his eyes. It was these precious moments that he could easily take for granted, he was determined to acknowledge how lucky he was just in case this didn’t last. He didn’t like to think about that but if everything did come crashing down around them at least he had this amazing thing even just for a short while. At least he’d known what it was like to be happy.
“This isn’t how tonight was supposed to go.” Draco whined looking at the ceiling. “I just wanted to make it perfect for you, I thought I could do it but I freaked out when I was faced with your enormous, perfect cock.”
Draco came round the table to Harry and bent down to kiss him on the lips lightly before taking his seat between him and Teddy.
apparently, as if that really matters.” He scoffed. “I don’t get a say in it really but the whole thing is ridiculous because it grows back so quickly that I have to get it cut twice a week.”
Blaise stepped into his sitting room and then seemed surprised to see them already here, normally the shop wouldn’t have closed yet but clearly he’d managed to get off a bit early which wasn’t unusual for him when he was in control of his own meetings and worked through lunch.
Daphne looked slightly worrying towards him. “Well you were a bit obsessed with him at school and there were occasionally some looks you gave him when you thought no one was watching…” She trailed off
“No, not exactly. I thought I would freshen it up a bit and make it more of a sunroom. My wandless transfiguration is somewhat limited but the house elf helped.”
“Oh.” Draco said, immediately relaxing. “Well you could have led with that.” He said bitterly, annoyed with himself for worrying and being overly dramatic as usual.
“I, erm, have to thank you for the gift basket, er, Draco.” Even though he’d been referring to him as Draco in his head for the past couple of days it did seem odd to say it out loud to the man. “It really was pretty impressive and Hermione absolutely loved it.”
“I am afraid Pierre is a very busy man and cannot be disturbed during his brewing process. However I can make an appointment for you to meet him and discuss your order tomorrow if that is suitable for you?” She said opening a black leather diary on the counter and picking up a glamorous gold feather quill.
“I’ve never actually slept in a double bed by myself, not really.” Harry found himself saying. “I have had the odd night here over the years of course but I was always on Dreamless Sleep so it knocked me out. I, erm, I sleep quite curled up, I don’t take up a lot of space… I think it’s still because of all those years, erm, in the cupboard under the stairs like I told you… I liked my bed at Hogwarts, it felt big compared to the cupboard but it was nice having Ron and the others there. Even the noise of Neville’s snores were strangely comforting. Then during the holidays I was either in a single bed with the noise of my cousin snoring next door or sharing a room with Ron somewhere. After the battle I stayed at the Burrow for a bit with Ron and then like I said, I slept at the ministry a lot and then at Hermione’s… sometimes someone else’s...”
He felt Draco squeeze his hand and when he looked at him again Draco was giving him that look again. The look that George had talked about. The look that made Harry want to tell Dracohow much he loved him as he thought Draco must feel the same way. Date night tomorrow, he reminded himself.
Draco laughed but didn’t actually answer and then Biscuit decided that he wasn’t happy with his lack of affection so he jumped up onto Harry’s side of the bed and nuzzled into his face.
Teddy was usually in a good mood after school with lots of excess energy and he especially loved Wednesdays when Harry picked him up. Most of the time he’d come tearing out of the gates towards Harry with bright blue hair indicating that he was excited and raring to go. Today though he came out quietly and slowly and he all but ignored Victoire as she waved him goodbye. He had light brown hair and green eyes, looking exactly like a mini Remus Lupin. Harry recognised this mood straight away, it was how Teddy always looked when he was sad or thoughtful, whenever they talked about his parents.
Just then Harry was very glad he had changed the conversation as another familiar redhead came round the corner holding his little baby girl.
“We can apparate to the safe house from the boundary of the school grounds, Mr & Mrs Malfoy, follow me.” Williamson said before walking ahead to lead them through the remains of Great Hall and out the front of the school.
Who is excited for Daphne and George?! They are going to have their cute little shopkeeper baby way earlier than anyone thought!
“So, what did you want to do now?” Draco asked, completely innocently. They couldn’t possibly continue to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory. In fact, Draco was quite grateful that Harry had turned it off. He didn’t think he’d ever be able to watch it again without thinking of Harry wanking off to thoughts of Draco. No, that film was definitely ruined for him now.
Draco gave it a quick glance before setting it on top of his ‘to-do’ list to his left. Potter’s handwriting was so bad that he wondered if Granger would even be able to read it but then again he guessed she was used to it. Seeing the familiar messy scrawl also confirmed to Draco that Potter was the client he’d been thinking of.
The worn-out man had stayed sitting in his new chair for the rest of the evening refusing any tea or making an effort at any conversation. Williamson had gone off to sort the bedrooms out, transfiguring, cleaning and conjuring furniture until the place was at least habitable for the five of them. Lucius and Narcissa had the main double bedroom, whilst the two aurors shared the middle twin room opposite and Draco had the single box room down the hall next to the only bathroom.
Harry shut the door behind Draco and they both stood in the hallway slightly awkwardly for a moment until Harry noticed that Draco seemed to be holding a box of what looked like clothes and toiletries.
It seemed like Fleur just missed having something that was just hers and even said she was a little envious of Hermione having a career and being a mum, even though she said she couldn’t work four days a week in a job as demanding as hers. It was an interesting discussion and Harry had an idea whirring around his mind but he needed to talk to Draco about it first.
His heart was pounding in his chest as he looked into those familiar eyes that he was lucky enough to see everyday. He couldn’t bear to think of the pain Draco went through that year, he couldn’t bear to think that he almost gave up and then he would have never had this chance to redeem himself, to live his life, to make himself happy and to make Harry happy too. What would Harry's life be like now without Draco? Everything they had each been through both together and apart had led them here and here was a very good place to be.
“NO POTTER JUST SHUT UP AND FUCKING LEAVE ALREADY.” Draco shouted at him tense, angry and shaking. He was enraged. “AND TAKE YOUR STUPID PATHETIC BOOK WITH YOU. I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.”
“Anyway,” Potter continued. “I don’t have the power to absolve you from everything you’ve ever done… but I can forgive you for everything you’ve ever done to me. I already have, years ago to be honest. We have a pretty fucked up history, we’ve both hurt each other but when it really mattered we both saved each other too. It’s in the past and it can stay there. There are other things in the past that I do need to address… Things I haven’t dealt with, that I’ve buried… That’s why I want to write it down, to process it and move on. Don’t you want that too? Don’t you want to deal with things head on, bring honour back to your name and then move on?”
“-but I think it’s a good thing that we both still have separate friends that we spend time with.” Draco continued. “I know you’re friends with Blaise and Daphne too and I genuinely do really like that as I couldn’t be with someone who didn't get on with them, but I still want my own time with them too.”
“Nah Mum, nothing like that don’t worry.” George said, taking the empty seat between Harry and Ginny. “He just went at it a bit hard last night and hasn’t long been home.”
“You have?” This was surprising but good news to Draco. “Oh good, hopefully that means at least one of them is ok… and it certainly will make things easier for mother. I hope it’s Pinky, mother always liked her.”
“Harry came over yesterday. I hadn’t exactly invited him but we did agree that we would meet up. I was just going to floo call him when I finished brewing but in his defence it was a bit foolish of us to have not communicated a clear plan really… Apparently he tried to floo call me in the afternoon but I didn’t hear it as I was downstairs so he came round. I was annoyed at first, you know how I am when people just turn up, but he looked at me with those bloody beautiful eyes of his and said he was worried about me or something so I didn’t have it in me to be cross with him. Still I won’t deny that it did put me on edge slightly, I just assumed that I would go to his again but maybe that was a bit unfair of me and I never specifically told him that he couldn’t come round. I guess he thought he’d welcomed me into his home when he rarely does that to anyone so maybe we were at that stage or something…”
Harry sat at his desk in the library/study for the first time in two weeks. He used to spend lots of evenings here finishing off all his auror paperwork, he usually did Ron’s share too as that had never been Ron’s strength but at least the head Auror position came with a secretary. Thinking back to his old job Harry once again was filled with relief that he’d walked away from it. He was already so much happier, well not happy exactly but definitely less stressed. Pulling out parchment from the drawer he took his favourite quill in his hand and made a start taking Fred’s suggestion to list all the events from the start of Hogwarts until the end of the war that he wanted to include. He definitely wasn’t going to talk about his life before school but telling everyone what really happened with the philosopher's stone and the chamber of secrets would be the easiest place to start.
I'm so so sorry that it's been such a long time. I'm completely fine and don't want it to sound like I'm making excuses but I've just had a bit of a hit with my health over the past two weeks and the heatwave didn't help!
The drawing room was a really nice room that Draco had only ever used to make firecalls really but unbeknown to Harry he had taken up practising his old piano skills on a Sunday afternoon when Harry was at the burrow. The restored black grand piano in the room was a really nice one but Draco hadn’t played since he used the one in the Chateau in France. His mother had always liked to hear him play when he was younger but his father thought the skill was a waste of time, much like Draco’s drawing.
“Makes sense actually, and you have a swimmer’s body.” Harry said, piecing it all together. “Why did you stop?”
“At least we have some people in our life that we can be open with then.” Harry said smiling softly.
Harry couldn’t resist a sneaky look at Draco who had the corner of his mouth turned up slightly but neither of them said anything.
Then Harry dragged a still sulking Draco into his arms and gave him a big kiss on the cheek. Draco wanted to stay sulking but having Harry call him his boyfriend for the first time in front of others was definitely something he liked hearing. He usually wasn’t one for physical affection in public either but this was like a public claim from Harry that Draco was his to kiss whenever and wherever he liked which made his stomach do a little flip.
Harry had already given him the case of wine which he’d been happy to accept as it had been from the old Black wine cellar and Harry had admitted he wouldn’t drink it all as it wasn’t his favourite. Personally Draco thought the man drank too much anyway so he was probably doing him a favour. The other things on top of the wine though was too much and Draco hated being treated like some charity case.
No one else quite knew what to say or do but Potter used this quiet as an opportunity to just carry on as if nothing had happened.
sort of fun then it had to come from Harry. Harry had to make the first move and it had to be his decision.
Draco wasn’t surprised he didn’t want it to end up in The Daily Prophet if he really was drinking all those dreamless sleep and hangover potions by himself. Draco thought about warning him that he’d likely already developed a mild dependency on them but then he thought better of it. It wasn’t like he cared and the money from that order was good.
“Well it was two years ago, so he’s had plenty of chances but it seems like the only person he told was George fortunately” Harry said avoiding anyone’s eye and taking a large sip of his beer.
Fred nodded to him but was looking a bit sad all of a sudden and then George put one hand on Harry’s shoulder and the other on Fred’s and gave them both a gentle squeeze. Then he walked out of the room and Harry heard the words ‘Shell Cottage’ before the sound of the flames whoosed up to engulf George.
thought about trying anything with Harry and he thought about more as he was walking back to his beach hut. Technically they could. They were both single, both liked men and he was almost certain the physical attraction was mutual.
Draco nodded slowly. “I suppose that’s probably true. Still not sure how I feel about him knowing though. What exactly did he say to you?”
“Er, yeah, great.” Harry replied. “Thanks so much for this, for all of this.” He said slightly awkwardly.
Auror Potter was back in charge now it seemed. Daphne unanswered Harry’s question but she looked at Draco as she did so. “Your mother is here. She just wants to talk and I think you should listen.”
By Wednesday evening the shop was finished and Draco was very pleased with it. Looking around the space after the contractors had left he was the happiest he’d felt in a long time. This was it, he’d done it. He’d escaped the clutches of his father and he finally had a space to call his own and he was proud of himself and the space he’d created. It looked even better than his drawings. Hopefully it will earn him a good income too. The outside looked perfect too but Draco wasn’t quite ready to show the whole yet so he’d kept the large white canvas that wrapped around the front of the property in place and shielded it from view for now. He managed to brew up a batch of sustenance potions in between supervising the work and so far was just drinking those as and when he needed to keep him going. He knew it wasn’t ideal but it would do for now. He would learn how to cook and where to get food from in time, he was just too busy this week.
“You know very well that’s not the reason but we’re not having this discussion again here!” He snapped back.
Daphne scoffed. “Draco, no one else in my family even has a job! The least they can do is accommodate mine even if they don’t understand why I like working.”
“Do you have any idea how amazing you look in the shower? You look so fucking good Drac, all wet and naked.” Harry mumbled as he kissed his back. “I’ve been wanting to jump in the shower with you for ages and I was hoping when we moved into this room that I could.”
Blaise leaned forward in his chair and looked at Draco. “Draco, it’s Harry Potter.” He paused for effect and then carried on. “Tell me, what did he do at school every single time anyone told him he couldn’t do something?”
“Now it’s just become comfortable, it’s what you know and even though you’re not happy, you're not sad either so you tell yourself that it’s what you want. I also think that over time you’ve just stopped looking for what you actually want because you’re scared of not finding it. It seems like as you’re not exclusive you could still go on dates to try and find what you really want whilst maintaining this arrangement with Fred, that would really be the best of both worlds and maybe people would love to be in that position, but I think that you’re not taking advantage of it because you’re actually really uncomfortable with being in an open relationship. You don’t mind that Fred goes out with others because you don’t really have to think about it but if you want out on a date you’d think that you were cheating on Fred somehow even if he knew about it and would be fine with it.”
“Oh.” Harry said, feeling stupid for not understanding but happy to talk about it. “I didn’t realise I was gay properly until I was nearly 19 and it took me even longer than that to come out to everyone.”
Draco nodded his head slowly and seemed slightly embarrassed. “Yeah… I really did actually. I, erm, I didn’t realise… giving could be so… pleasurable and- well you taste really good Harry.” He finished flirtatiously.
“He’s been staying with you? As in living in your house?” Ron said with his face all screwed up in surprise and confusion. “Godric Harry you really are a saint that will just help anyone huh? It’s one thing helping Malfoy but… wow. What have Fred and George got to do with all this though?”
“I’m leaving Father. I shall no longer be living here and I don’t expect we’ll see each other again.” Draco said coldly.
His voice that started strong faded at the end.  He took another breath and found the strength in his voice again.
Harry chuckled slightly and looked relieved. “OK then good, I was worried that I’d messed up again as I seemed in the habit of doing.”
He swallowed back his emotions at the thought of actually owning the beautiful french building. It definitely needed updating but he could do that, he could get rid of anything that reminded him of Father and make the changes that he wanted to make. There was nothing wrong with the building itself, it was beautiful there and he was still rather fond of it. It had been his escape, the place where he had started to learn who he really was away from his father.

He sighed and leaned forward into her. He wasn’t really much of a hugger, in fact he didn’t usually do physical affection at all as he just wasn’t used to it but weirdly today he just felt like a hug. It was on days like today where he wished he could just wake up in someone’s arms rather than be forced to wake alone and seek comfort in the arms of his fake ex-fiancé.
It was mid afternoon on Friday when he was wrapping up the second lots of owl orders for the day when Harry brought him a caramel latte and Draco was once again reminded of the benefits of working here with Harry around.
“Of course not, you look lovely as always Daphne.” Draco replied honestly. “It’s just a slightly different look for you that’s all.”
“Then you seemed a bit defensive when I asked if you were still mates with Zabini and you left early… Today you still seem distracted but in a really good way, like you keep smiling to yourself it’s weird.” Ron said screwing up his nose slightly.
This week, hell this dinner had thrown a lot of things in his face again that he hadn’t thought about for a while. He really liked his time with Fred but maybe it wasn’t the right thing for him anymore. The thought of not having Fred to turn to when he needed him made him really scared and a bit sad. He didn’t really want to ‘break up’ with Fred but then he’d been forced to admit once again that he did actually want a proper boyfriend.
“Am I really that obvious?!” He said slouching down towards the floor and running his hands through his hair.
Draco turned to look at him in surprise too with a slight confused look on his face. Harry hadn’t told him yet of the conversation he’d had with Dromeda, he had been saving it for the right moment.
That was actually my first proper sex scene so feedback would be good. Not sure if I should change the rating from Mature to Explicit? Thoughts?
Daphne quickly jumped into the conversation with a louder, more jovial tone. “You can’t just call that Blaise, maybe Draco will want a best woman instead.”
“It can!” Daphne insisted. “Ever since it officially turned October the whole house has gone mad! I can’t walk into a room without being asked to solve some last minute wedding dilemma and there is so much stuff everywhere. I mean you’d think we were hosting a wedding for Merlin himself with a thousand guests instead of a hundred, it’s ridiculous.”
“Daphne don’t!” Draco sighed. “We’ve had this conversation, they’re never going to believe that I’m a victim and they’re never going to help me. I just don’t trust the Ministry and I  still don’t fully trust that Lucius has no influence there. I just don’t want them involved in my life. They’ve left me alone since the trial and I don’t want to attract their attention in any way.”
“Good, right then.” Harry pulled another VIP pass out of his pocket. “You shouldn’t need this really as no one will see you to check but erm, just take it in case, you know, well, just in case…”
“You didn’t have to do that Fred... I know what the arrangement is... I’m sorry.” Harry muttered, hanging his head.
“Harry,” he said. “I’m sure there will be plenty of time where he probably both mess up but we’ve been pretty damn honest with each other so far which is a new thing for me but… well it seems to be paying off, so let’s just continue to be honest and confront things as they happen. I’m glad you told me about George overhearing for example as now I can be prepared for Daphne’s barrage of questions when I next see her.” He said smiling.
Harry then shifted a bit looking like he was trying to get more comfortable. He raised his feet up to rest them on the coffee table in front of him and he turned ever so slightly towards Draco putting his right arm across the back of the sofa. Draco could feel the warmth radiating off the skin of his bare arm behind his neck. It made him want to lean back into Harry’s arm but he didn’t.
“Actually, erm, Narcissa is demolishing the Manor and rebuilding a new home in its place.” He said casually whilst bouncing Rose on his lap slightly. “She’s staying with Dromeda whilst the work is being done. Dean and Seamus are doing it, well with their company of course. It’s a big job, will need a whole team.”
“Good.” Draco said quietly as he laid happily back down on his back again seemingly pleased with himself.
It was about one o’clock in the morning before they finally fell asleep naked in bed together for the first times. They curled up in each other’s arms and despite Draco’s initial protests that he was not a cuddly sleeper, it seems like perhaps he could be after all. It seemed like a big step forward for them and it wasn’t just out of laziness that Harry was pleased to be able to walk around the top floor naked in the morning leaving the bathroom door open as he brushed his teeth with nothing on and his bedroom one open as he got dressed.
“Well I didn’t do it for the sake of appearance, the working out I mean… When I started it after the war it was to focus my energy into something and make me feel strong. I told you before there was a lot of pressure on me to be the best auror, everyone expected it of me because of what I’d already done… Anyway, hand to hand combat is part of auror training, we had to be physically tough on some level in case we had to tackle a target without our wand, or chase after someone, or restrain a muggle… And it was another way of me making sure I never felt vulnerable without a wand… I don’t really keep up the fitness stuff now like I used to but I like running, it clears my head so that’s why I do it, more for my mental health than my physical health I guess.” Harry finished.
“If I was going to run at the first sign of trouble I’d have been long gone by now Harry.” Draco said seriously but Harry chuckled nonetheless.
Then Draco turned his head towards him and gave him a sudden, intense and passionate kiss then broke it off as quickly as he’d started it and immediately walked back to his desk leaving Harry just standing there recovering.
“Oh boys, you say that now but you both know that you’ll absolutely adore our little baby and will be fighting over who gets to be Godfather.” Daphne laughed.
There was a wizard who had incredibly scruffy writing and had a weekly order with him sent straight to his house elf called Kreacher. Funny name for a house elf really and it had a familiarity that Draco couldn’t quite place. The order consisted of five dreamless sleep potions, three headache potions, three calming draughts and two hangover potions. That was a worrying amount, Draco had often wondered what on earth this wizard needed them all for but he assumed that maybe he had a large family with several members suffering from PTSD or some anxiety condition and they shared them around. If Potter really was taking them all himself and had been for nearly two years though… that was concerning. Life as an auror was obviously tough. Was Potter ok? Draco wondered, then he became mildly surprised with himself that he was caring about Potter’s well-being.
It was over quite quickly. It wasn’t the desperate hug of relief it had been then but it was a soft gentle motherly embrace and then she pulled back. She stood in front of him and looked into his eyes once again.
Speak of the devil, Blaise himself stepped forward now with a very smug look on his face to greet Harry and shake his hand. As Harry turned his attention to Blaise it allowed Draco to take a good look at him now without revealing his thoughts.
“Oh.” He said as if contemplating something. “So I’m guessing it doesn’t usually go with pasta and garlic bread then? When you had it at the Quidditch you weren’t eating…” He trailed off.
Proudfoot tried his best to engage Draco in the conversation during the first week asking him things about his childhood but Draco never seemed to quite know what to say. He would usually hesitate too long and then his mother would end up talking on his behalf saying things that like “oh no Draco would never have done that, he was always such a good little boy”. Draco wasn’t really sure that was true but he wouldn’t contradict his mother, besides thinking about his childhood was as painful as thinking about everything else nowadays. One particular evening, however a couple of weeks ago things slowly started to change. Proudfoot had asked Draco a question that he could find an answer to.
“I get that Harry, I really do. I think you’re being too harsh on yourself, I’m sure you do still deserve it but-” George started.
“Just rest Draco and try not to worry about anything.” She said kindly in her mothering tone. “I’ll leave you alone for a bit and I’ll take care of Harry but afterwards you and I are going to have a little chat.” She said in the soft but firm way that only she could.
“Well anyway Sunday sounds good.” George said. “Invite them and let me know. Even if they don’t come I’ll still sit in the box with you and Fred might too. We’ll all end up back at the burrow afterwards no doubt anyway, hopefully for an after party so we can catch the family then.”
“Yes it is rather.” She agreed before turning back to Pinky. “Pinky, you will never hear me say this again and if you ever repeat it I will deny having said it, but I believe in this instance I was wrong. It seems like you are rather more clever than I have given you credit for and I’m glad you disobeyed me.” She said in a mock-stern force but still unable to keep the smile from her face.
Yes, avoiding the hotel would be for the best until Potter left the island… but he really did need to get his laptop so he would make one last trip. It was pretty early, no doubt Potter would still be sleeping off his hangover so now would be the best time for Draco to pop into work and get it.
Draco smiled broadly. This was even better, he got to be Harry’s first something, the possessive side of him definitely liked that. “Yes Harry, I’d like that very much.”
“I think you mean properly related.” Harry said kindly trying to repress his annoyance at the stupid Miss Violet.
“We cannot simply let you go freely elsewhere either, you all still have some explaining to do. There are people here who would have me send you directly to Azkaban, however, it is not in my nature to incarcerate people before a trial, whoever they may be. We must also take into consideration that there are known Death Eaters who have escaped today. If they believe you have… switched sides... they may wish to do you harm. So what I propose is that you will all be taken to a safe house where you will await your individual trials. I can assure you that you will be looked after and your trials will be fair all you need to do is cooperate with us. This is the best I can do for the moment”
“I don’t blame you. That’s a hell of a lot to handle at fifteen Harry.” Draco said quietly, then Harry noticed he looked very troubled about something. “I’m sorry I didn’t help matters… with Umbridge I mean, I… Did- did she do that… on the back of your hand?”
The others all muttered in agreement and thankfully didn’t press Harry for details or ask too many questions. Hermione was always there for him and he did like talking to her, most of the time, but she always seemed to worry about Harry and sometimes treated him like he was a bit fragile and he hated that. She seemed to know things about him that he didn’t know himself which made him feel uncomfortable as she would never tell him. She would drop hints like she expected him to worry things out on his own but he’d never been much good at that. Truthfully they hadn’t spent an awful lot of time together in the last year really and Harry did miss her. Maybe he was being a bit harsh on her, maybe he should spend more time with her and try to listen more.
“Oh, right. Yeh it would be. Sorry about that!” Draco said, if they were joking then did that mean they are ok?
Before Harry could respond the stadium around them roared to life as the commentator started welcoming them and witches in dark green and gold robes started flying out from the tunnel to deafening cheers.
“Just stick to your side.” Draco said playfully but with a serious undertone. “I can’t sleep plastered to your side like I was last night. I need my space.”
“It was near the end, we’d had the leftovers boxed up and I said I would give them to you because it was your favorite restaurant and then he said that you were the reason he’d invited me out in the first place.” Daphne continued.
Harry turned towards Fred and spoke quietly. “I know Fred but if I can do it then the wards will be broken and really easy for you to penetrate. Then you can all come in and save Daphne.”
Thursday during the day he’d helped George out in the shop as Fred was covering for Lee at their Hogsmeade branch and Verity had called in sick. It was unusual to spend proper time together with George without Fred but it was nice. Hermione had actually only gone back to work four days to start with and she said she would go full time after Rose’s first birthday so Harry spent a rare full day with her on Friday. He was still there when Ron got back home and ended up staying for dinner as he hadn’t seen Ron since Monday evening and his best friend had lots of stories to share about how he was transitioning into his new role.
“How do you know my name?!” Draco snapped immediately standing up stiffly. His eyes no longer sparkled but they were stormy grey and fierce.
When he arrived at the gate he was pleasantly surprised by what he saw. He was worried he’d be going somewhere like Malfoy Manor. He shuddered as he remembered the grand but dark and oppressive house. What he saw though was anything but dark, it was really rather beautiful. Past the white gates was a broad stone path leading to a larger white Georgian style manor house. It wasn’t as big as Malfoy Manor but it was still rather sizable.
“Of course Harry, I’m always here you know that. I could never just cut you out of my life. Apart from George you’re my best friend. Probably even closer than Lee.” Fred said casually.
“You don’t understand, I don’t have time.” He said stubbornly shaking off her hand and managing to undo the second clip on his left shoulder. “If you don’t want to see me get undressed you should leave now otherwise I will do it in front of you!”
Draco chewed his lip nervously which wasn’t something Harry had seen him do before. “I don’t suppose you have any chamomile tea do you?” He asked quietly.
He thought for a moment and then spoke again. “When we got the message and came to join you at Hogwarts you were going on in the room of requirement about finding something of Ravenclaws to destroy. We just shrugged and accepted it but we never really understood it. Is it something to do with that?”
Blaise looked at him as if he was stupid. “Are you seriously saying you don’t know? He all but said it when we went for dinner. Gay, romantic family man remember? You asked me to find out that was the whole point of that conversation! Besides, something must have happened between the two of you by now?”
“Yeah of course! Ginny against Oliver for the final! Wouldn’t miss it” George replied enthusiastically. “I love it when games fall on Sundays!”
“Here go to your godfather Rosie so that your mother can hit me.” Ron said grimacing and handing Rose over to Harry who happily accepted her and drew her in close to give her a kiss on the forehead. It had been a week since he’d seen her and he hadn't cuddled her at all last Sunday.
“That’s good, I’m pleased you have found the right balance between being there for your family and having your independence. I know that’s been a struggle for you recently.” Draco said genuinely.
Merlin, now he was beginning to sound like Molly. The last thing he wanted to do was mother Draco. Why was it that sitting on the sofa holding hands with him had seemed natural yet this perfectly normal act of getting lunch for a friend had Harry all flustered and over-thinking?
Suddenly the air felt heavy again as it often did when Harry got swept away in these little moments with Draco. It had happened yesterday too before he’d gone to see Teddy. Harry wondered for the millionth time if inviting a man he fancied to live with him was a good idea but he wasn’t going to tell Draco to leave now when he’d confessed how safe and happy he felt here. In fact, Harry was rather hoping that Draco might never leave.
“What do you mean? What’s gone? Who destroyed it, Draco?” Blaise questioned but in a soothing tone still.
Suddenly Ron stood up too. “What? You’re not saying he stayed over at yours are you Harry? You never have anyone over…. Who is this guy? Is he really still there?”
“Yes I am well aware of the trait that runs in the Weasley family thank you darling.” Daphne replied with a sarcastic tone and a dramatic huff.
Draco didn’t impress me to be fair.” Harry admitted but with a smile. Then he reached out to give Draco a playful poke in the ribs. “
At midday Harry apparated directly onto the doorstep of Molly and Arthur’s house as he was running a bit late. He was immediately greeted by the sound of noise and chaos that was so familiar with this place. Several people greeted him all at once and he said hello to everyone in return. Molly was in the kitchen with Dromeda. Arthur, Bill and Ron were sitting at the table discussing work. Charlie was chasing Victoire, Dominique and Teddy around whilst Hermione was sitting on the sofa with Fleur discussing babies looking down at the rug where Rose was happily playing with-
Draco shrugged. “Lucius was a fool, making promises to- to Riddle that he couldn't keep. He promised he would get the prophecy and he failed.”
“Yeh you’re right.” Potter said slowly. “I guess I’d just quite like to get to know you. I’m beginning to think that we never really knew each other. We just saw what we wanted to see. I hate that actually. People everywhere think they know me because I’m famous, they always assume things but they don’t actually know anything about me. I think maybe I’ve been guilty of that too with you. I’d like to start over and get to you know, properly, if you’ll let me.”
