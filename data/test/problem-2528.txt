“I don’t look like a kid playing dress-up?” Hari asks. He looks younger than his age, he knows this, and had played it up at the last session.
“No, Lord Potter, of course not. My apologies, I simply was unprepared to see someone so young participate,” Minister Fudge bows neatly.
“Adding your house to the floo network,” Hari explains, “then you’ll be able to come and go as you please.”
“Hey,” Draco murmurs and smiles sweetly, “breathe, you’re okay. I’ve got you.” Draco leads them through a swooping turn, causing their robes to flare around them. Some of the tension bleeds out of Hari at the teasing move. He starts to smile again.
Hari makes eye contact with Narcissa across the way. She flicks her eyes to where Daphne and Blaise are sitting. It’s a silent instruction: keep your eyes on them, not the others. Turning too much to the side to look at Draco or Pansy would draw attention. Hari adds Theo to his list of appropriate people to look at.
“I’ll begin with what is most difficult for me to announce,” Hari says and clears his throat, suddenly feeling guilty. “We will be terminating two positions. Argus Finch, thank you for your tenure here at the school. However, at this time, Hogwarts finds itself no longer in need of your services.” Finch goes to sneer and yell at Hari, but Professor Snape rises and glares before he can even get a word out. “You have, I am sure, a home you stay at over the summer?” Finch confirms this with a stiff nod. “Is it available to you during the school year?” Another confirmation. “Then I request that you gather your belongings and return home by the end of the week. Is that enough time?” Finch nods stiffly. “Should you need Hogwarts as a reference, you will receive a glowing review.”
“Oh, wow,” Daphne twirls slowly in the grand entrance, “this place is stunning.”
“Dray, I gotta get up,” Hari shoves at Draco’s shoulder for the fifth time that morning. Hari sighs and decides it’s time to pull out the big curses, “I have a meeting with the Hogwarts staff today. Do you want me to fire Filch or no?”
“He’s comfortable there,” Hari mutters, focusing on his work.
“I’ll explain the rest at home,” Hermione jumps in, “it’s not really a conversation for public.”
“I figured if you preferred port-keying to flooing, you could use it to go home, instead. The keyword is ‘
“That’s too much,” Hari whispers into his ear.
“That’s good,” Hari murmurs. “There’s a lot of you all anyway.” He smiles teasingly and, soon enough, he and all his friends are petting the hippogriffs. When they start to return inside, a kneazle with orange fur and green eyes races over to Hari out of nowhere. It yowls at him and paws at his leg.
“Perhaps the most unforgivable action was attempting to beat the magic out of me.” This is the shift. He can see it in the corner of their eyes. Displeased disbelief shifts into horror. Yes, it is horrifying that a child might be beaten, but a wix child being beaten for their gift? The Wizengamot will not stand for that. “Any signs of accidental magic and I would be whipped with a belt until I passed out. The problem with attempting to beat a magical child for their accidental magic is that it only makes the magic stronger, even if it was bound twice, as mine was up until I saw Healer Ripclaw just over a year ago. Accidental magic is an in-born protection system for wix who cannot yet wield their magic. Violence only makes it more desperate to protect the child. This created an endless cycle.
“Indicate?” Hari nods. “Make eye contact and maybe tilt your head as if you’d like to speak. Turn your body—especially your feet—towards the dance floor and bend your arms to waist level. If he’s reading your body language at all, he’ll understand. That’s how I stand when I want to dance and he’s always understood me.” Daphne doesn’t mention that it’s a rather typical pose, but there’s no need.
Hari searches Draco’s face. There’s only honesty, pure and open, laid out there. The words spiral in Hari’s head and he recalls every time Draco has ever seemed slightly off. Whenever he hugged Hermione, when the girls at school had thrown themselves at him every Valentine’s Day. The Valentine he’d gotten from the young Weasley girl, who he’d had to apologize to for Draco’s temper. All the hugs and hand-holding and cuddling makes sense now; Daphne had tried to tell him. Draco really does like him.
“And being an Heir isn’t a good enough reason to have excused absences from school,” Draco sighs dramatically and leans onto Hari’s shoulder. “Come on, everyone will be waiting.”
Draco follows his gaze and cringes, “you’d think they’d at least have the decency to stop now that you’re in our world.”
They step out into the hall, where Lords and Ladies are already arriving.
Hermione bows, “and you, as well, Lord Nott.” She straightens and clasps wrists with him. He seems both surprised and pleased at her knowledge of etiquette.
She gasps, “this is for me?”
“I’ll see about contacting her, then,” Lucius rises. “Thank you, Lord Potter.”
“Plus, all of us have house elves we can call if it’s necessary.”
“Yes, sir,” he glances at Hari, “sorry, Headmaster.”
“Works for me,” Blaise shrugs and rises.
“Okay, so, when I see you all at Diagon next week…” she trails off, looking for an explanation.
“I will,” Daphne stands, “he and I have nice chats all the time. Besides, I think he’ll respond better to a girl asking about feelings than a boy.”
“Family then, eh?” Sirius walks over to her and extends a hand. They clasp wrists. “Might as well call me Padfoot. I’m a bit old to be your cousin, but uncle works well enough.”
“What’s the oldest someone would buy a crup?”
“No, not guaranteed,” Hari says, “with the perp’s power, if they’re tried in the wix world, it’s likely they’ll weasel their way out. We want them to end up charged in the goblin community.”
“I was placed in this home on the basis that I would one day need to be willing to sacrifice myself, be a martyr, because the person who left me there thought my death would be the only way to remove the soul from my scar. If I was ‘rescued’ and given love, the way this person intended, and then informed the love is conditional on the basis I go out to save the world, I would have willingly done it. This person withheld from me not only my property as listed by Griphook, but also my rights, and attempted to manipulate me out of free choice.” Hari tilts his head pleadingly, “Please, allow these charges to be filed so that this never happens to another child. Make an example of this person so no other wix ever feels the sense of entitlement they do. Protect our future.” Hari looks from Blaise’s proud face, to Daphne’s determined one, to Theo’s pleased and contemplative look. All good signs. “Thank you for your time.” He bows and steps away, taking the stairs back to his seat. Once there, he raises the privacy screen preventing sound from entering and leans back with a sigh.
Hari’s heart stutters and his stomach squirms. He sips his hot chocolate, letting his eyes drop so Draco can’t see how embarrassed he is.
“Ugh, right, you had the worst mealtimes ever last year, didn’t you?”
“I did,” Hari says, relieved.
“Clasp your wrists,” Sirius instructs, “Hari, you put both hands on hers, Hermione, you keep your other hand free. Once Hari says his part, you’ll place it over his mouth. Hari, you’ll say, ‘One who is faithful, keep my secret, I give you the location: 12 Grimmauld Place. So mote it be.’ And Hermione, you’ll reply, ‘As I am faithful, I keep your secret, and take the location: 12 Grimmauld Place. So mote it be.’ I will complete the spell then and Hermione will be the only one able to share the location.” Sirius lifts his wand and begins the charm, “
“Alright,” Hari agrees and they step forward, never letting go of each other. They get to their compartment—indeed, the same compartment they’d had every train ride so far—and settle in, Draco sitting against the window with Hari on his lap and firmly wrapped in his arms. Hari snuggles closer and relaxes, content to wait for the others.
Minister Fudge nods and addresses the Wizengamot as a whole. “I declare this session over. The next session will begin with the selection of the new Chief Warlock. Please come prepared with your preferred candidate.” He bows to the Lords and Ladies, then takes his leave out the main doors. “I need to speak to Madam Bones immediately!”
Yes, I could re-read it and try to pick up where I left off, but I've tried that and it isn't working.
Hermione glares, “I’m aware, thanks. Just not looking forward to it.”
They have a momentary conversation about allowing students to arrive via apparition and floo, but decide that would set muggleborns apart a bit too much. Instead, they add a clause that would allow for special circumstances to be exceptions. Such as Hari’s case, not that he’ll use it. Besides, the Express is a much-loved tradition now.
“Okay, but did anyone else notice how the minister thing had no planning?” Daphne asks.
Draco drags Hari through the building to a large chamber with several circular tables and two long buffets. “This room is specifically for Heirs. It’s not blocked by magic or anything, but it’s sort of just understood that the kids come here and the parents go to the other room.”
“All the stairs up is being hidden,” Critter tells them, “but there is being more than one because only one would be a safety hazard. Lord James’ great grandfather is saying that.”
“Formality,” Hari says, “basically, when the ritual was created, formality was expected whether in public or private. Saying that would be saying, ‘you don’t have to bow in private.’”
“Then you must call me Hermione,” she replies politely. “All of you,” she addresses to the whole group, who nod back.
“May I see the design?” she asks and he turns his hand over for her inspection. “This is incredible,” she tells him, “may I ask who did this for you?”
“Yeah, our next trip is to one of the other best robe shops in Britain. They’ve got the best everyday robes,” Blaise says.
Pansy laughs, “that’s just where our seats are. They’ve been there for Merlin knows how long.”
Lady Zabini adds, “as well as the commentary of their proclivity for eating human flesh.”
“Well, a House is a magical family or bloodline,” Hari starts, “except that instead of being traced back by blood, it’s traced by magic. By taking Hermione into my House, I’ve given her access to my family magic. The protections that come with it are such that she essentially is my cousin now. If someone in the wix world were to threaten her or pose a danger to her, I would be notified immediately and appropriate action would take place. Essentially, I will see to her safety within the wix world, be it medical treatment, physical protection, meals, clothing, or even housing.”
“There you are, Beau,” Blaise leans down and scoops him up without hesitation. He carries Hari to the R.O.R without pausing, even as Beau pleads sadly to be let down. “Oh, hush.” He releases Beau into the R.O.R only after the door has closed and vanished. Everyone except Pansy and Hermione are there.
“Oh, thank you, Critter,” Daphne sighs, taking a sip of her tea.
Despite the fact he’d been mumbling that it’s too early to be awake for the last five minutes, Draco pops right up and out of bed.
“He just outright told you that?” Draco gapes.
“We’re going to go for a walk,” he winks at Daphne and Blaise, who laugh outright.
Professor Snape leans back and gestures for Hari to explain.
forgetting to pay for the member of his House,” Hari corrects.
Hari laughs, “I don’t plan on dying any time soon, I promise.”
“I love your hair,” Draco starts, “the curls are incredible and the length… you wear it so well. And your eyes,” Draco sighs, looking a little dreamy. “Their color and how they’re so wide—they’re simply beautiful.
I'll be sure to come back with my absolute best writing.
Hari’s classes last until seven thirty that evening—he almost wishes he’d simply set dinner to run late enough that a mandatory dinnertime wasn’t necessary, just so that day would end a little sooner. But, it is nice getting that break between classes and getting to run around as Beau for a few minutes.
“For now,” Hari crooks an eyebrow, “every student. Primarily because of the void created by the past ten years of this class not being taught.”
“And two sets of formal robes,” Pansy adds, “one open and one closed.”
“Would you go to the Department of Magical Transportation at the Ministry and get the paperwork to request two new port-keys for me? You can take it to my study at the Manor, I’ll come by tomorrow to fill it out.”
“Goodnight, ‘Mione,” Hari waves and the rest follow suit.
“And how would you have us tier it?”
“Best let him change back,” Lucius warns. “I think you’re about to get clawed.”
“And no one could have told me this yesterday?” Hermione asks as if irritated, but she turns to look at Hari and winks teasingly.
Hari giggles, but then yawns. When Daphne does the same, Blaise announces that he thinks it’s been a long day and they should head to bed. Hari fetches Sirius, who transfigures their clothes without question. Hari lets Draco lead him to one of the guest rooms, then shifts into Beau and curls up in the crook of Draco’s neck. He’s asleep in minutes. It really had been a long day.
“Still,” Hermione says firmly and releases him. “Thank you, it means a lot to me.”
He doesn’t have to wait long. For once, Draco is early. Usually, he prefers to arrive ‘fashionably late’. Hari’s not even sure he understands what that means.
“No,” Hari shakes his head, “I’ve already implemented the changes. You should’ve gotten an extra page with your letter.”
“Yes,” Professor McGonagall glares at Professor Flitwick. The other teachers have already left, presumably because this is solely a Head of House issue.
“Dude, there’s so many,” Blaise whispers. As he had said, there are a fair amount more crups than kneazles.
“Could we port-key? That,” she gestures to the floo, “was very disorienting.”
“Similar enough that ‘man’ should be the first sound in the name,” Draco says.
“Now, Cornelius—“ Dumbledore starts. Lucius cuts him off.
Pansy shrugs, “works for me. Now,” she snaps her fingers, “details.”
“Everyone knows who you are,” the girl smiles peacefully. It’s true, they’re rather well known.
“We’ll be getting our food within minutes!”
“I will now call the victim to the floor,” Master Tomeaxe announces, “I will request that no questions be asked of the victim and that they be allowed to speak uninterrupted.”
“Now?” Draco smiles and pulls Hari into him. “Now, I get to cuddle you all the time. And hold your hand everywhere we go, not just to lead you around. Now, everyone knows you’re mine.”
“Alright,” Hari turns to Critter, “Sorry, I didn’t know that was possible. I’ll remember for the future.”
“He’d never claw me,” Draco says confidently, “And if he did, I’d just wrap his paws and cuddle him more.” Beau yowls even louder and hisses for good measure. Draco lets him down.
Madam Bones passes out the files of paperwork for next session’s agenda immediately after being elected, rather than make them wait until after dinner. She dismisses them, stating that the day had been one of upheaval and they would get back on track in the next session.
“Look at the up side,” Draco mutters, still reading the article, “we have Latin first and you can get away with sleeping.”
“I don’t have an answer for that,” Draco mutters.
“Let me put it on you?” he asks.
Hari blanches, “oh, gosh, that would’ve been so much easier!” Draco laughs outright.
“Divination is a class you either are born to or aren’t,” Hari says simply, “your talents would be better suited assisting other true Seers, rather than languishing in a classroom where the students cannot understand you.” Merlin, he hopes he’s getting this one right. He doesn’t even know her. Or anything about Seers.
“Hari? Is that you?” They look over into an alley where someone—dirty and unkempt—is wringing their hands. Hari sneers.
“Crumple-horned…” Draco practically starts bouncing on his toes, “I know who she is! Xenophilius Lovegood! He runs the Quibbler. Their line is actually well-known for producing Seers. He never was identified as one, although he always knew who he could trust and who he couldn’t.”
“Probably,” Draco agrees. “Carriage?” They look over to where the carriages should be and realize they’ve been out later than planned. Hari sighs and holds out his hand, activating the port-key without hesitation. They arrive in the Entrance Hall to see Professor Snape scowling down at them. Hari has the sudden urge to transform and run off.
“We will adjourn for one hour. The doors will seal at one thirty,” Dumbledore calls and taps his wand at the top of the podium. Hari rises and briskly makes his way out of the room through the back entrance closest to his seat. He’s certain there are others around him hoping to speak to him but—oh, there’s Draco.
"That's none of your concern at the moment, unfortunately, but we'd like to begin the questioning if you don't mind." Draco did mind—very much, actually—but he didn't want to test their patience just yet so he stayed quiet. Was this even legal?
“Because I get it. Our situations weren’t the same, obviously, but I get it. I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner.” Draco wasn’t completely sure he could believe what he was hearing. Potter was sorry?
Narcissa returned quickly, aware that her son was being baited and pressured, but Harry couldn’t help the urge to go over there himself. He stayed where he was, though. The elder Malfoy, trained in social niceties as she was, asked the press to show respect and decency by leaving them alone. They didn’t, of course, but it at least made a nice quote.
"Shame none of them can actually understand Parseltongue, isn't it?" Harsh, angry blue eyes flared at him. The man looked so annoyed, as if having to deal with a temperamental toddler and not a perfectly rational teenager. Well, this would certainly be fun, at least.
“Hey, it’s okay, don’t panic or anything. Five minutes won’t make a difference, right?” Draco nodded, anxious for answers. “Pomfrey gave you a sleeping draught so you would rest. Dumbledore wanted to know what happened so I told him and McGonagall what I could and Snape nearly went for Lucius’ throat right then and there. Dumbledore stopped him, though. Whisked your father off to a cell somewhere to face the aurors when he’s revived and made sure we got to the hospital wing. I tried to tell him about your friends and everything but they didn’t care. McGonagall listened, though. She got everyone we could think of into hiding and they’re safe, I promise you. We’re in hiding, too, actually. But we’re safe and so are they, hear me Draco? We’re safe.” He nodded, but didn’t totally comprehend the words until Harry caught a tear on his cheek. Why was he crying? There was no reason to be afraid—not more than usual, at least—and there was no imminent threat so why was he crying suddenly? Harry smiled, though, and it hit him. Relief.
“I have a favor to ask of you.” Instantly, Harry’s full attention was on Draco. He, of all people, knew how much the blond hated reaching out or relying on others—let alone asking for help from his ex.
"Of course, baby, anything."
"No, I don't. But I feel like I should." Draco nodded against his shoulder like he knew words wouldn't really help right now. It was a Friday morning, and it wasn't supposed to be sad like this. Fridays were
A part of him screamed that of course—
Draco’s hands were
The blond was completely stoic. To anyone else, Draco might have looked bored or even angry that he had to attend the funeral, but Harry knew better. Draco wasn’t emotionless, he was just complicated. Harry, though, saw the tremors in those soft hands, and he noted every hard swallow that constricted that pale throat. He caught the wetness in those beautiful grey eyes and he watched attentively as Draco blinked it away.
There were petunias everywhere. That was the first thought that registered in Harry's morning haze, and it seemed to be the dominant observation in Draco's mind as well. White ones, red ones, purple ones… It was like the whole service was a tribute to Aunt Petunia's suffering rather than to Uncle Vernon's death. Harry couldn't really say he was surprised, though.
“I’m not surprised. They only grow in fairy rings during autumn moons but they’re quite lovely.”
so you're lucky that he's even here. Secondly, maybe I was raised in a stuffy, overly polite household but isn't it common practice to be
"Of course I am. But I saw the same thing as everyone else, and I don't know Parseltongue so I doubt my testimony will be of much use." It was subtle, but Draco heard it and he tried to show his gratitude without words. She wouldn't analyze the Parseltongue memories. If anyone had a chance of having heard what they'd actually said, it was Hermione but she was willing to plead ignorance for them. Draco had never been more thankful for her.
"Actually, Aunt Petunia, since you asked, neither Draco nor I need to work. We would be bored, though, so I work for our government's law enforcement and Draco brews rare, specialty potions." Petunia frowned, her face creasing in the corners the way it used to whenever Harry set the table the wrong way. The room was filled with people, Harry noticed, but they all seemed too far away to reach, as if they were avoiding Petunia too. Figured.
"What's that?" Draco appeared behind him, holding their respective morning drinks. Harry's was a vanilla and caramel latte, always carried dutifully in the Statue of Liberty mug they'd gotten on their first trip to the US. Draco's was black coffee with a spoonful of brown sugar—not white—in Harry's old Gryffindor mug. He took the drink, as well as the kiss on the cheek, but didn't try to hide the paper.
“What?” Somehow, Draco had managed to forget he was speaking in front of Harry. “What do you mean high risks?” Both Blaise and Pansy looked to him but he sighed and nodded, even when they hesitated. It was Blaise who spoke.
Draco nods, “she needs her own.” Hari agrees wholeheartedly.
“Thank Merlin it’s Friday,” Blaise groans, “no classes tomorrow!”
“I’d ask you to come with me,” Hari tells Draco, “but…” He trails off.
“Right,” Draco nods, “but the other stuff is so you can go with Mother to sit in the gallery.”
“Whose Manor do we want to go to?” he asks.
Lord Potter—so that they may face appropriate retribution for their crimes.”
“And there was such a danger to her that you decided this was the best course of action?” Mrs. Granger does not sound pleased.
“What was that room you were in?” a little blonde girl asks from behind them. Everyone jumps.
Pansy flips open her planner and starts rattling off assignments. Hari pulls out all the necessary notes. He peeks over at Luna, working calmly at her own desk just a little apart from the group. Obviously, she couldn’t work in the circle with them since she’s a year younger and doesn’t have the same assignments, but he feels bad seeing her sit there alone.
“We will!” the group choruses and they head out to the next shop. Pansy snatches the list of measurements from Hermione and glares at Hari.
“You’re on the floo network,” Hari tells her, “you can call either of us and we’ll do what we can, okay?”
“Yes…”
Two years of silence to see that look. He
“Now,” Mr. Granger asks when they are seated with drinks, “what exactly does this entail?”
“Um, hi,” Hari tilts his head at her. “It’s just the room we like to do our homework in.”
They share a glance, then switch to discussing Luna’s homework and classes. She has quite a bit to say about Defense and seems to think Professor Snape is infested with nargles himself. Hari holds in the comment he has about that.
“He would be able to do… an adequate job,” Professor Snape agrees. Hari has to force his eyebrow not to rise at that. For him to say that about someone he doesn’t truly like is practically a glowing review.
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Baron of House Black. So mote it be.” There’s more surprised shifting at this, but they accept it quickly, just as soon as the magic accepts Hari. The black swirling lines fade away and Hari takes a breath to begin again.
“And you’ll have to come to our girls’ nights,” Pansy adds. Daphne agrees enthusiastically.
“Hello, Hari.”
“You played up that childhood innocence thing,” Draco says, “and it made it look like you weren’t even
Hari descends the steps to the floor, the first Lord, Lady, Heir, or Representative in the room to move. He pauses at the center just long enough for Draco, Daphne, Pansy, and Blaise to catch up. They fall in step with each other, Hari’s fingers curled through Draco’s and Blaise’s arm around his shoulder with the girls flanking them. Hermione meets up with them and they walk three by three, the boys in front, and Pansy and Daphne crowding Hermione behind them. They move swiftly through the hall until they reach the port-key room.
“Dray,” Hari looks at him and pouts, trying to look as innocent and sad as possible. He sniffles for good measure. “You don’t really mean that, do you?”
“Critter can do!” He pops away immediately.
“That’s a pretty good chunk,” Daphne assures him. “Although it would have been better to see it in the forties.”
“She does have that cat, though…” Hari winces slightly.
“How is it still so clean?” Daphne whispers. “I don’t think anyone’s lived here in several hundred years.”
“Thank you, Lucius,” Hari smiles and Lucius turns, striding from the building to reach the nearest apparition point.
“Well, if payment isn’t an issue, then who would we hire?” Lady Bulstrode asks.
“Of course, Luna, if you will call me Hari.” She grins brilliantly at this and skips away, headed for Ravenclaw tower.
wouldn’t spook the blond, but Draco just sniffled and nodded. In less than a second, Harry had Apparated them. They collapsed back onto the couch, and Harry drew the blond between his legs to snuggle against his chest the way they’d done a thousand times before. This was them.
“That’s because no one has.” Above him, Draco pulled back. The hands left his skin, but Harry didn’t turn his head or try to look behind him because he wasn’t sure he could have this conversation face to face. Clearly, he’d taken the blond by surprise.
Harry Apparated without a second thought, leaving the reporter questioning him mid-sentence to gawk at the spot where he’d once stood. There were pictures to document his presence, of course, but he didn’t care. They would twist everything he’d said and everything he hadn’t said until it fit whatever story they were trying to push, but he didn’t really give a shit in that moment. He knew, already, where Draco had gone.
Ms. Le’Galle sat delicately in a chair and appeared to be listening, but her eyes locked on Harry’s. She didn’t blink. Harry fought the urge to squirm in his seat as the unease he’d felt at her arrival only strengthened. She held herself like a young aristocrat or like…
“I came to check up on my godson,” he answered smoothly, as if that were obvious. “In spite of your recent actions, I am still your godfather.” Draco forced himself to breathe. He was well aware that Snape’s memory of this conversation could be used by the Ministry and he dug his nails into his palm to avoid reaching for his wand. It wasn’t there, of course, but he still ached to have some kind of defense. Even just being able to curl in on himself would have been better than lying there exposed.
Harry had heard, of course, that Draco Malfoy had gone into the private investigator business after resurfacing a few years back. The Ministry had been rife with rumors of all the elusive, high-end cases Malfoy had recently solved, and Harry had no doubt that those rumors were carefully crafted bullshit spread by the 'detective' himself.
“Dirty, dirty mind. I was merely going to get you into your pajamas.” Harry chuckled, still hesitant but glad that Draco was okay enough to joke with him like that. They both knew that Harry slept naked. It had driven Draco crazy during the first few months of their relationship because Harry was a natural blanket hog and he’d used Draco being dressed as an excuse. Now, though, it was normal. Or, at least it used to be.
"Can I ask you what happened to Snape?" Again, Hermione's expression scrunched but this time it seemed more like distaste than discomfort. She sighed, glancing absentmindedly over her shoulder for Aurors.
He took in another deep breath and tried to swallow the lump in his throat. It tasted like guilt and dread. Draco was long past the point of trying to amuse himself or keep ahold of his sanity, but he still caught himself glancing towards the empty chest against the far wall. Supposedly for his possessions, he’d often opened it hoping to magically find a book or something to do.
"The Ministry is building a case against him. They've got a lot of really powerful people combing through every scrap of information they can get and I don't think it's hopeless for us but, it definitely isn't good." Fantastic. He wasn't thinking clearly enough to really process what that meant for them, but he knew that this wasn't part of the plan. This was
The chest remained empty, though, because he didn’t own anything anymore. The Aurors had banned everything from the outside, even his homework and assignments. His mother had revoked all financial support, Pierre had explained, and he was currently being regarded as a ward of Hogwarts. That status would be revoked if he was found guilty. Pierre had managed to keep a sturdy, lawyer-like expression on his face as he’d read through the documents, but Prew had looked absolutely gleeful. Gradually, Draco had come to resent the lumpy little rat man even more intensely than the Aurors.
“You’re sure you don’t want an Auror present, Miss…?” But his visitor smiled, ignored the guard's obvious question, and shook her head.
"Ah, again you are mistaken, Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy will not be working with you, he will be looking into things privately. Without Ministry interference. I trust you can stay out of his way?" Harry wanted to hex her. He gave them both a sickly sweet smile and decided he had had quite enough of this snobby bullshit for the time beings.
"Well, Prew, I'd shake your hand but as you can see I'm a little preoccupied at the moment." He tried not to sound bitter—honestly—as he clanked the metal on his cuffs because neither Prew nor his associate had said what their jobs were and he had no idea if they were to blame for the restraints. But, Pierre at least seemed to be on his side, in theory, and he had to blame someone so his words came out harsher than necessary.
“Wormwood root. Boiled into a tea. Newest treatment for aftershocks of crucio. Supply is already en route, be sure to get it to the high risks first.” Blaise nodded his understanding.
"It's because I get it. He isn't hiding it from you, necessarily, and he isn't keeping things out of spite. It's just one of those things… You can only really understand if it's happened to you and I get it. That doesn't mean he doesn't trust you, though, and that doesn't mean you aren't still his best friend." Draco was not good with emotions, usually, but he was very good at reading people and he saw the thoughts written in the Gryffindor's face. She gave him a pained little smile.
“Drake…” This was familiar in all the wrong ways and Harry wanted to throw up. He ached to reach out, now more than ever, and the only thing stopping him was the knowledge that Draco would instantly push him away. The blond was unsteady at best, and Harry knew he had to wait for Draco to come to him.
"I'm well aware of that, Howard, which is why I find your complete disregard for legal procedures and investigational integrity appalling. I've answered your questions, and asking them each twenty times will not get you twenty different answers, even if you don't like what I've said. You've got your information, and I've got healing potions to take. However, I'm the one strapped to a hospital bed and you're the one in the chair so, as much as I would love to stand up and walk out that door, I'm afraid the ball is in your court."
—he needed to know that Harry was okay. If Harry was okay… The logical side of his brain stepped in, though, and reminded him sharply of where he was and how much of his sanity was riding on seeing his lion at the end of this. He shook his head, and Luna merely blinked at him.
“I love you.” It wasn’t supposed to sound so guilty, like he was confessing to some kind of crime, but Draco just nodded. I
“You’re hilarious. Really, though, I’ll grab a pair of sweats and—” Draco cut him off with a gentle kiss.
“I bloody hope not.”
Harry sat silently in the backseat of his uncle's car as they drove. He was crammed in with all his luggage and Hedwig, in her cage, because the front passenger seat held a small box with a present for Dudley.
“Your heart is racing,” Draco whispered, each word brushing against the layer of cloth between them. Harry just curled his fingers a little tighter in the blond’s hair and shushed him. He didn’t want to talk. They didn’t need to talk, talking was what always messed them up and ruined moments like this. Slowly, he slid his hand a bit to one side and ran the pad of his thumb over the sensitive skin just below Draco’s ear, earning a shiver. He knew Draco’s body.
Harry wanted to march over there and put himself between Draco and everyone else. He wanted to shield the blond from the scrutiny that he was so accustomed to, and he wanted to scream at the reporters that grief wasn’t something they should be splashing all over their front page. Especially after the war…
“I never thought I’d see the day…” he mused, but he pushed Draco over so he could fit on the bed too. “The one and only Draco taking me into his bed. Unheard of.” Draco laughed, even if it was choked with tears, and Harry seemed to like that so he didn’t stop. Normally, he would have stifled or crammed it full of contempt. But Harry actually seemed to like the fact that he was amused?
” But that didn’t answer his question and Harry’s avoidance only made Draco more anxious. Had something gone wrong? Surely they weren’t trying to confront his father somehow, right?
“Do you love me, Drake?” Again, he should have put that
"He better fucking—"
"I'm glad he trusts you, Draco, and I mean that. I know we haven't really talked much since you both came back to school—and we don't need to, at least not right now—but you aren't the person I thought you were. I'm not saying that I forgive you, but I can appreciate the person you are for Harry. He's a good judge of character, and I think I'm beginning to see what he sees in you."
!” Draco flinched when she yelled, though neither woman noticed, but Harry instinctively tightened his arm around his shoulders in reassurance.
“They have your name on them.”
again, Bartholomew, that I've answered this question multiple times and don't plan to change my answer anytime soon. I didn't poison anyone, and I didn't orchestrate any kind of plot to poison anyone through a third party either. I was incarcerated, same as Harry, and spoke to no one but the guards. You should ask them about it. I've heard witnesses can really be key in this sort of thing, you know?"
"Don't be. He wasn't my favorite person." Behind him, he heard Draco shift on the couch and then there were hands on his waist—gentle, and warm from holding the coffee.
"I'm sorry to hear that." His voice was completely neutral, which Harry really couldn't blame him for. He didn't talk about the Dursleys very often and, when he did, it was usually just an offhand connection to a story he was telling about himself. Draco wasn't sure how he was supposed to react to this news, so he was waiting for some kind of clue before letting anything slip. That was one of Draco's old habits that Harry could never decide if he hated.
Like hell he was! From what he'd been told and what he could gather from snippets of outside conversations, the raspberry had been a targeted hit. The elfs that worked in the Kitchens were probably all being detained and questioned, but why? As far as Harry was concerned, he knew exactly who had orchestrated the attempt on his life. If anyone was going to be collateral damage, it was that slimey excuse for a godfather and anyone else who dared stand between him and his little dragon.
“Stupid.” Draco finished, sneering and not even noticing the nickname. “If anything I put those kids through hell. I taught them to survive beatings and curses and how to refuse the dark mark but all I ever really did was prolong their suffering or doom them to hell on earth. Two fourth years didn’t come back from winter break this year, did you know that? I told them to refuse no matter what, that I would have their backs if they just sent a letter, and their father killed them. I'm so fucking stupid I just made it all worse.” But Harry was still beside him, running his hand up and down his arm comfortingly until he stopped speaking.
“What did you just say?” But Harry smiled at him and nodded, squeezing his hand.
"See something you like, Mr. Malfoy?" Prew's snide voice made his skin bristle, but he didn't look away from the witch. She was so calm and collected compared to the man beside her who turned a different shade of red with every ridiculous name Draco called him. Were they both Dark? Or was Prew just as ignorant as Miss Le'Galle was devious?
Unsure if he was supposed to agree or comment on that, Draco merely nodded. Luna was not offering helpful conversation—she’d asked no relevant questions, clearly hadn’t been sent by Hermione or Minnie, and had given him no explanations or reassurances—but he still found her presence deeply calming. Maybe he’d just become too on edge from being locked in there alone.
he came to him…
“Why? It’s true.” More tears, and he felt Draco’s weight shift again as he tried to scrub them from his expression but he ignored it. Why was the blond so upset by this? Harry liked to think that he knew Draco pretty well and it scared him a bit that he didn’t understand this sudden emotional outburst. He wanted to turn and comfort the blond, but refused.
Draco couldn’t remember much of what happened after Harry said that name. There had been a lot of confusion, and a lot of chaos. A lot of panic on his part, too. He remembered McGonagall yelling—a lot of yelling, now that he thought about it, which was unusual for the calm, collected head of Gryffindor—and he remembered her physically slapping someone, but he couldn’t remember who. Draco was shocked, honestly, by how protective the woman suddenly seemed. It was likely because she loved Harry, and Draco was apparently part of a package deal so he got included haphazardly. But he’d never seen the woman so angry.
"The bagel, you mean?"
Draco couldn't talk much, still. After everything that had happened, Harry was shocked that the blond had managed to speak at all, let alone to be questioned. He could hear them, though, vaguely talking behind a few muffling charms as they questioned his little dragon. Minnie was with him, thank Merlin, and he could hear her voice cut in every now and then even if he couldn't make out what they were saying, but that meant he was left alone to face his own inquisitor.
, in his mind—but he knew that Draco wouldn’t. That was pressing a boundary too far, in the blond’s opinion. Instead, Harry stumbled and caught himself in the familiar, sterile parlor of Malfoy Manor.
Harry was sitting with him, still bandaged and beat up from the Quidditch mess, in McGonagall’s office. Not Dumbledore’s, Draco noticed, and he couldn’t help wondering if his father had finally succeeded in removing the old man from his position. Pomfrey was sitting with them, fretting nervously over Harry and McGonagall but ignoring Draco.
"They really didn't give you any time to think about it. What if you'd had plans?" Harry snorted. He could guess that one of the reasons his invitation was so late was because of the difficulty getting Muggle post into the Wizarding parts of Britain, but he knew that wasn't the only reason.
He couldn't really believe he'd been invited. In all honesty, it had been four years since the war had ended and it had been six since he'd last seen or talked to any of his blood relatives. They'd always talked about forgetting he existed, he'd just kind of assumed they'd actually done it.
"I didn't waive any—" But Draco stopped the second Miss Le'Galle stepped into his line of sight. He knew, instantly, why her presence had felt so familiar and why the air around her seemed to chill. She was one of the Dark witches his father had met with leading up to the ritual.
“M’cold.” Harry didn’t have to know that Draco didn’t mean literally. He didn’t have to know about his father’s cold touch or the ice Draco slammed into his own chest every chance he got. He just needed to know that he was cold, and that Harry was warm. He tugged again, until Harry got the hint and smiled.
Tears welled in his eyes and Harry cursed them, not even sure why he was suddenly so emotional. He tried to wipe them away before they could fall. A pale hand reached around and grabbed his mug before he could spill it, setting it gently on the table and smoothing up Harry's chest. It was stupid. Why did he even give a shit that Vernon was dead? They weren't close, they definitely didn't have any kind of familial bond, but his chest was still tight. Slowly, Draco palmed his chest, just over his heart.
"I cast a stunning charm, that's all. I don't know why he died." Minnie looked ready to slap him, but he didn't let himself even consider that possibility right now. There were more important things, like wording his answers for this report.
He’d relaxed once again and almost forgotten about the erection Draco had clearly wanted him to feel when the blond did it again. His whole body keened into the sensation, and Draco chuckled low against his throat. The blond was fucking with him. He wanted to protest, to flip them and fuck Draco until he didn’t dare tease him again, but he was too afraid of breaking this. Instead, he just lay there.
"That's ridiculous and you know it!" Pomfrey coughed in their direction, and Harry reluctantly lowered his voice. "If Snape's upset, it's because he lost Lucius's power, not the man himself. He is Draco's godfather but a lot of good that's done anyone. Hell, he's probably saying I staged the whole thing to get us moved back up here to the hospital wing or something." Harry expected Hermione to berate him, or at least give him a disapproving look for talking about a professor that way, but she just grimaced.
"But what." Harry was not in the mood to read between the lines and his head throbbed with every beat of his heart. Hermione looked like she wanted to run.
“Well, you’ve checked.” Normally, he would have gotten slapped for saying something so obvious and impertinent. That had been before everything, though. Now, his father was dead. Who did Snape even report to, anymore? His mother? Maybe, or maybe some distant male relative that Draco had never heard of before. The Potions Master fixed him with a level gaze, as if trying to decide whether or not to say what he’d planned to.
"That shouldn't matter." It did, though, because the Ministry could destroy Draco without even breaking a sweat. It wouldn't matter that he was the victim, no one would care about the abuse or trauma because he was a Malfoy. Harry clenched his hands into fists at his side, but decided to change the subject.
Harry was
"Any chance you need help with Potions homework?" Hermione granted him a little smile, but let him change the subject and pulled out a roll of parchment from her bag. Draco doubted that there was any Potions homework or, if there was, that it was due anytime soon. But, it was something they had in common and it was something he was good at, so it was easy to fall back on, especially when he didn't have Harry. He didn't want to say it, but without his lion he was slightly scared of her.
“Believe it or not, Lucius Malfoy is not our top priority at the moment.”
Whose desires was she calculating around now?
"What's that got to do with anything?" Harry couldn't really fault the woman for being so dedicated to her job and he admired it, in a weird sort of way, but that didn't ease the sting of this conversation right now.
"How dare you bring such an insolent
Draco looked good, relatively speaking, but then again he’d always been pristine and beautiful, even when his own life was falling apart. His eyes were bright, still, but a little more tired than they should have been. They’d both had trouble sleeping after the war and the trials… He was dressed in slightly informal dress robes—the kind he wore every day at the Manor, and the kind that Harry would have ripped off of him the second he got the chance when they were together.
"Tacky," he muttered, though Harry knew that was just his attempt to keep the subject from getting too depressing. He just nodded in agreement.
"Mr. Malfoy, I'll remind you again that you are under oath." Draco snorted, drawing the attention of absolutely no one, because the oath meant nothing. It was a plea of honesty and allegiance to the ways of the Ministry—one that he had recited with mindless grace since the age of four—and it was as legally binding as a pinky promise. They kept pushing it, though.
“Yes, I am. I can stop if you’d like but it seemed to help earlier so I…” Potter trailed off but Draco shook his head before he could move or pull away. He squeezed the tanner hand back.
"Okay." He said nothing about Muggles, or about scheduling. There were no offhand remarks about Dudley, or pointed questions about the scars that Harry had yet to explain. They both had their limits, and this was Harry's.
Instantly, all three men turned towards the door. The woman who entered was tall and regal in a way that her Ministry uniform did not do justice. Harry couldn’t have explained why but the second he looked at the witch he envisioned her a very different environment—shrouded in dark robes, long hair crowned with thorns, and hands scarred by dark magic. He shook his head, noting that her palms were clearly unscathed, and tried to focus. Still, the aura of darkness followed her.
“Life wasn’t always picture perfect with my aunt and uncle. Broke a lot of bones over the years. Missed a lot of meals. But that doesn’t matter now and, regardless, just know that I see that fear in your eyes and I get it. I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner.” Where had this Harry been for the last six years of their education? Draco felt like he was dreaming, even though he knew he’d just woken up from a nightmare, but Harry just smiled. Had he ever seen the boy who lived smile so much? It felt like Harry was trying to blind him with it.
"Auror Potter! Please tell me you've come with some sort of news about the case and not just another routine questionnaire?" Harry had in fact come with another set of questions and forms for Mrs. Magnolis to fill out, but he abandoned them in the briefcase he'd brought. It was a routine part of the investigation and never something they skipped, considering the woman was their only witness, but Harry suddenly felt the need to be far more impressive than a few forms. Malfoy was sitting there, after all, just looking at him and waiting for a response. He would just tell Kingsley that the witness was uncooperative and try again later.
"A letter from my aunt, sort of." Immediately, Draco perked up in his direction. If they hadn't been living together for so long, Harry might not have noticed it tucked between the blond's casual recline or delicate sips of coffee. Those gorgeous eyes were settled on him, though, and focused.
They’d done this so many times… This was how they’d used to lay when they made up after a fight and Harry’s entire body begged for the part that should have come next. He wanted to feel Draco—
He pulled the blond up an inch or two and guided him into the kiss, but kept it tame. Draco tasted like peppermint tea—the kind he drank every morning, and the kind that Harry still kept packages of to smell when he was particularly depressed or lonely. There was no passion or heat behind the kiss, even if Harry had been hoping there would be, but that was alright. It was sweet, and comforting, and said
in there but he didn’t. Something about that felt wrong, as if he was admitting that they’d ended and was just trying to stir up old shit rather than explain something that hadn’t ever changed.
"Well, I would congratulate you but you always did thrive on doing the bare minimum, didn't you? Our dear Duddy graduated from Millbrooks this last year and already has a job lined up. He got his Masters, such a hard worker, and his starting salary is already six figures. What is your compensation like?" Harry could feel the waves of anger coming off of Draco, and he was starting to regret coming at all. He'd underestimated the sheer hostility that his aunt would have towards him and he could only imagine seeing his cousin now.
Draco stopped, not sure where he was going with that sentence. Did he think she would blame him? Surely she had no love lost for the man who had made their lives hell since before he could remember. Was it her disapproval of Harry that he feared? She would be displeased, naturally, but anyone could make exceptions for the chosen one, couldn’t they?
“You haven’t been with anyone in months?” He shook his head, willing himself to be brave. For a Gryffindor, he sure felt awfully scared of how this conversation was going to play out. Would Draco be angry? He couldn’t really imagine why, but he still couldn’t stop the thought.
“You saved all those kids, Dray.
Draco awoke with incredibly stiff limbs and an overall sense of anxiety. The smell of the hospital wing had begun to grate on his nerves, even in sleep, and he inhaled it bitterly as he steeled himself to open his eyes. As long as there were no lawyers, he would be happy. At least, that was what he told himself as he took another breath of disinfected air.
"Of course I would. I'll hex them for you, if you like." Harry chuckled, ignoring the way Draco's right hand twitched unconsciously against his hip, as if trying to reach for a wand. He knew it was only partially a joke. Draco had been hesitant to get very attached to him in the beginning, and Harry had spent months convincing him that they were in this together no matter what. The second the blond had realized that, he'd become fiercely protective. Harry didn't mind it, but he also wasn't totally sure that Draco's temperament would mix well with the Dursleys and their snide remarks.
"He seems to breathe a little easier whenever you're around," she finally offered. "I never would have thought that you'd be good together and, when he first told me, I was sure that your relationship had to be toxic as hell. But you
"Where's Harry?" Hermione had said he was okay, and Draco desperately tried to trust that, but he couldn't help asking. The question just slipped out like some kind of confession.
"Welcome home." Draco, clearly, was not even a little bit surprised that he'd put it off until now. He gave Harry a passing once over, to make sure all the limbs were still in their correct places and that the dirt wouldn't get everywhere, before beginning to dish up their plates. Harry was tired, but he still caught it when Draco gave him twice the serving of mac and cheese that he gave himself. No doubt preparing for Harry to drink himself into oblivion.
"A pleasure, Mr. Malfoy." She didn't offer her hand, and Draco didn't try to take it.
In a less official capacity, private investigators operated in what should have been a very public way. They had to advertise, meet with clients, and they had to stamp their names on every tiny success to build credibility. Draco Malfoy did none of these things. Instead, Malfoy seemed to operate solely by word of mouth and to very selectively take on clients. He had no room to be picky—Harry could gather that from his financial records, which the Ministry was incredibly meticulous about—and yet a case solved by Malfoy Inquiries made the papers once a year at best.
He took Draco's hand, trying to ignore the way his own was trembling and hoping that the blond wouldn't notice. They made it to the door before the screaming started, and then it was Draco against the masses as a massive game of tug-o-war raged between them two sides. Draco won with a well timed, softly mumbled 'depulso'. That was the wrong move though, apparently, because then the screaming narrowed into one word, and it was all Harry could hear.
"Was there a question in there, Sir?" He kept his voice polite, but disinterested, and hissed another
“And they smell like you. What’s your point?” Draco just stared at the material in his hands, his eyes wet yet again. Sometimes Harry wished that they shared some kind of mental bond so he would be able to tell what Draco was feeling without having to play this guessing game, but then again maybe the guessing game was just part of their dynamic. He was usually pretty good at it, at least. Wordlessly, Draco unfolded the sweats and traced each letter: P O T T E R.
to you. I will not stand here and—"
"Mr. Potter, I will remind you that you are under oath. Did you, or did you not, cast an Imperius Curse on Mr. Malfoy?" Deep breaths. Harry dug his nails into his palm.
time. Monday through Thursday, Harry belonged to the Ministry at all hours of the day and night while Draco slaved over cauldrons and potion ingredients. On Saturdays and Sundays, they did chores and hung out with friends and were generally lazy but they were also usually social.
There were no lawyers. There was, however, something much worse.
"Aunt Petunia," he tried again, trying to make his voice sound as if he were speaking to a delinquent first year. "And Dudley, as I presume you're somewhere nearby listening. All three of you were horrible to me as a child and I don't want to speak ill of the dead but I was hoping that things had changed. You are still my blood relatives, even if you are rude and unwelcoming. I came here to mourn the loss of my uncle, not to be insulted by the woman who raised me. Thank you for the invitation, but Draco and I are clearly not welcome here so we'll be leaving now."
"This is not a joke, Mr. Malfoy—"
"See you in four hours, Pomfrey." The mediwitch nodded, not at all put off by the last name, and disappeared through that precious exit door. Draco closed his eyes, willing himself to sleep until his next round of potions was due, but his mind swirled around images of Miss Le'Galle and he imagined his trio of legal harassers moving onto Harry next. The idea of her being in the same room as his lion made his stomach churn.
"I'm alright." He didn't mean to be short with her, but thankfully she didn't seem to mind.
The question was sudden and left him reeling just like everything else Luna had said so far. His favorite flower? Was this some kind of association test? Would his answer say something about his guilt to the Ministry?
As always, the door swung open with a loud creak. Draco had a feeling that the Aurors had purposely not oiled the hinges just in case he tried to make a quiet escape. As if he were stupid enough to use the door.
"Thank you. Did they at least get any of the Death Eaters into custody? Were any students hurt?" Hermione frowned and picked at her cuticles.
“Professor,” McGonagall wheeled on him, fire in her eyes, but stalled when she saw who it was. “Harry needs to be protected from the Dursleys, too.” He heard Harry choke on the couch against the wall but ignored it, facing straight ahead and looking McGonagall dead in the eyes. She was… confused?
It was no secret between them how particular Draco was about physical contact. The friends he’d had in school who had been allowed to touch him were either dead or had drifted apart  with time. Growing up with his father, Draco had always shied away from physical contact unless it came from his mother. They’d worked hard, for months, to get to a place where Draco was comfortable touching him, even in the most innocent ways, and Harry had loved it. He had no doubt that Draco was just as desperate for human touch as Harry was to keep him there.
He would have liked to have said that her anger did nothing to him, that he just shrugged it off because she wasn’t his head of house and she couldn’t do much to him, but it hit him hard. All anger did, the more he realized it, and when she yelled it turned his blood to ice. Draco shuddered and shrank into Harry’s side, but the Gryffindor just put his arm around Draco’s shoulders and held him close. Thank Merlin, Draco couldn’t help thinking.
They stepped into the reception hall, and immediately a hush fell over the room. He couldn't tell if it was because people somehow recognized him, or because Draco always drew that kind of reaction in Muggle crowds. Either way, the attention was clearly on them and it wasn't long before Aunt Petunia found them.
“Who, Draco?”
"I didn't—"
Of course it couldn’t be that easy, though. The creamy envelope appeared out of nowhere, materializing on the counter in front of him, but he still didn’t see it right away. When he did finally notice it, he had to smile a bit. Draco had always known his routine, and the timing was no coincidence. If the deep green wax seal with an intricate M carved into it hadn’t given the sender away, the loopy handwriting on the front of the envelope would have.
"I just want to be normal." An almost imperceptible sigh ghosted over his skin and, for a second, Harry thought Draco had fallen asleep. He hadn't though, and made that clear when he pulled Harry into a slow kiss.
Luna smiled. She seemed to think that that was a good answer and Draco felt a rush of relief. It didn’t matter if it was his father or a Ravenclaw a year younger than him, he still got that flood of fear whenever he thought he’d angered someone.
"We only just got up, lazy." It was true, though Harry knew he could push a little harder this time. The letter had granted him a bit of sympathy, if nothing else, and he could use that now to pressure Draco back into their bed.
Immediately, the blond straightened and stepped closer, wrapping an arm protectively around his waist while those steely grey eyes settled on Petunia. Up close, he towered over the woman and Harry couldn't believe he hadn't noticed that before. The arm around his waist squeezed in a half hug, which he greatly appreciated. They were drawing the attention of almost everyone there.
Sitting in the hospital wing, Draco was left alone. He hadn't expected any visitors—both because security was tight, and because none of his friends would be caught dead speaking to him anymore—but the silence still stung. The whispering stopped as the Aurors went to question Harry for a second time—which was completely unnecessary, in his opinion, but whatever. Regardless, Draco was left just waiting there. He was content to hear Harry's muffled voice, even if it wasn't Parseltongue, as a sort of soothing background noise.
“Of course I’ll be there, Drake.” Just for a second, that nickname seemed to put a little bit of warmth into those grey eyes but then it was gone. Draco frowned, and Apparated without another word.
"Oi, what's got you up in arms, Potter?" Harry grumbled and took one of the bagels that someone had brought for the team. It was stale, and only pissed him off more.
"No, not tonight." Secretly, Harry wondered sometimes if Draco said no because he feared a relapse, or if he felt like he had to babysit Harry. It was just so unpredictable… He knew Draco wouldn't tell him if it got bad, and that alone made him question every motive the blond had.
“They’re yours, not mine.”
God, he wanted to run over there and hug the life out of the blond. He wanted to kiss him and run his fingers through that unfairly soft hair until the tears subsided and both of them could breathe a little easier. But Draco had already taken a big leap by asking him to be there, and Harry wasn’t going to push it. As much as he wanted to comfort and coddle, he wanted to stay on the blond’s good side even more so—and hope that maybe, just maybe, Draco might reach out to him again if he needed to. That was what mattered.
his physical response to anxiety was forgetting to breathe. Draco
Prew glared at him and Pierre whatever-his-name-was just continued scribbling on his page. Draco could see the outline of what looked like a naked woman on it. Fantastic. He turned his attention to Miss Le'Galle, the witch he knew from his father's study and from the basement during the ritual, and wasn't shocked to see her dutifully staring back at him. She was incredibly patient, though he'd expected nothing less. Beside her, an enchanted pen was writing as she thought to it, taking notes via what seemed to be an incredibly complicated linking spell.
“This doesn’t have to be…” He didn’t finish that thought, but he didn’t need to. Draco’s expression relaxed into a small smile and he clicked his tongue in response.
As always, I do not own HP or any of the characters! Please be kind and thank you to everyone who has commented!!
“Yes, and especially when their eyes aren’t all crossed and blurry like Nymblum eggs. They’re so stressed… I wonder why.” But her tone did not sound like wonder at all. It was high and airy in a way that suggested she cared as much about the guards’ emotional wellbeing as she did about the Daily Prophet’s editorial page.
"You want some?" Here, Harry actually did wait for an answer. Though he'd learned a lot of Draco's other quirks, the blond was still virtually unpredictable when deciding whether or not to join Harry in his drunkenness. He could have flipped a coin and had just as good of a chance at guessing.
“Harry.” He turned leisurely, not at all on guard or suspicious of the blond even though he probably should have been. They’d been broken up for almost a year now, but he still couldn’t make himself distrust the one person who knew him better than anyone else in the world. The microwave dinged, but he left it for now.
” Harry gave him a disbelieving look that said Draco had missed something again, some normal human thing that he would have expected if he wasn’t so fucked up. He shrugged it off though and resolved to let Harry explain it later. Regardless, McGonagall was upset and it wasn’t because Harry had told her about the Dursleys—
“Visitor.” The voice was low and lifeless as it called into the room. They weren’t waiting for a response—he had no say in whether or not the lawyers and Aurors accosted him at any given time—but there was still a long pause before the latches began to click. Honestly, with the number of wards and locks on that door they must have thought he was a full grown Norwegian Ridgeback.
to our family's celebration of life! A stranger who dares to insult me on a day when we've already lost so much… You should be ashamed of yourself, Harry." That was it. He could have handled the insults and he could have politely ignored her hidden insults but that was the last straw.
"Why just him?" Hermione gave him a look. "I mean, why are they just going after him? Why not both of us?"
It was a nice thought, but Pomfrey was already on edge with so many people disrupting her hospital wing and she'd done so much for them that Draco felt bad aggravating her any further. Even if he was moody and wanted to hit something, he wouldn't take it out on her.
"Actually, he's saying that Draco orchestrated the whole thing to get himself moved to a less secure facility, what with destroying his hand and all. You were just collateral damage." Harry wanted to scream and curse and hex everything within a twenty foot radius of him. As if Draco would ever knowingly hurt him! If poisoning him benefited anyone, actually, it was Snape and all the rest of Voldemort's minions, which only further cemented the idea that Snape was somehow guilty.
"Thank you. I know we have a lot to talk about still when this is over and I hope we get that chance." He didn't say it like a dismissal, and he didn't say it like an empty promise. Maybe she heard the nihilism in his tone or maybe she could guess from the situation but she just nodded in acceptance of the not-quite promise.
"I didn't cast an Unforgivable Curse." Even Minnie gawked at that, stuttering and stumbling over the words as if Draco didn't know what he was saying. He did know, though, and even as the Minister shushed Minnie and asked him to repeat himself, Draco knew exactly what he was saying.
"No, no forms today Mrs. Magnolis. I see you've decided to bring in a… family friend?" It was a low blow and Harry wasn't proud of it, but it felt good to see the way Draco's jaw tightened, as if he was physically biting his tongue.
"What Imperius Curse?"
Finally, Draco sighed. Harry was sure that he’d decided against it and was about to launch into a long speech about making this into something it wasn’t. He braced himself, even as Draco sighed again.
, the proper way to greet a guest is by saying 'it's a pleasure to meet you' not spitting the word 'pleasure' out of your mouth like you ate something rotten, and then expecting to be liked. You act like you're the epitome of class and grace, yet you don't know even the simplest of things. For instance, did you know that it's considered incredibly rude to ask about one's income, or to share that information about others?"
” Draco pulled back, though, and glared. He was not going to be coaxed out of this one because this was important—to him, and to Harry—and this was necessary. His father was going to kill him, sooner or later, or at the very least take him away from Harry. Which would mean Harry would be alone. Completely alone. They wouldn’t be able to lean on each other, Harry would just suffer completely by himself with no one who understood what was happening or why. He would become Draco pre-Hogwarts.
“Come home with me.” It wasn’t a question, but he still waited for a response. He prayed that calling their flat
“Minerva, please, consider your blood pressure… Just take a breath.” But McGonagall was not having any of it, especially not when she was in such a fit of rage, and she turned on the mediwitch.
“You’re staring, Harry.” He was, but he didn’t care. It was like they’d stepped into a time machine and gone back a year. Everything in the bedroom was exactly the same because Harry hadn’t dared to get rid of Draco’s things or even move them out of place, but Draco was the finishing touch. His shy little smile made Harry want to tackle him right then and there. This was the Draco that only he got to see.
“Okay.” Harry undressed quickly and took his boxers off, as Draco had requested, before lying face down on his side of the bed. He heard a soft huff of discontent from the blond, who maneuvered them to the center of the bed and straddled his upper thighs, but there was no ultimate rebuke so he stayed still.
take a breath, Poppy! They are
"Mr. Harry James Potter, I'm sure you're aware that charges are being voiced against you for using the Imperius Curse. Is this correct?" Harry stayed silent, merely watching the quill beside the man move with the words. "Mr. Potter, the use of an Unforgivable Curse is no small matter. Your guardian insists that you would do no such thing, and yet there are hundreds of witnesses who testify to hearing you give Mr. Malfoy commands in Parseltongue." Again, he stayed quiet. The man stared at him, his brow furrowing into something like an angry caterpillar, but Harry just sighed.
I don't own HP or any of the characters! Longer (ish) chapter and warnings for PTSD flashback/panic attack.
saved them. You took this shitty situation and the hell that you were living in and you used it to help people. You're so…”
"It's time for your potions, Mr. Malfoy." He nodded and didn't even make a face when they tasted like vomit. His presence was already a burden, given that Pomfrey had to personally tend to him and Harry and couldn't let anyone else pick up the slack—as a precaution given the raspberry incident. She hadn't seemed bitter, but Draco could guess that she wasn't thrilled about the change.
Ultimately, he had discovered that the Ministry was an absolute shitshow when it came to anything non-magical. There were no forms, no permits, and no qualifications required for someone to be a private investigator and, unless they did something inherently illegal, they could remain utterly invisible.
Death Eater." Draco shrugged, but he wasn't fishing for pity or compliments. They were past that by now, anyways, and instead Harry tried to hear the honesty. It was difficult.
“You’re touching me.” Harry’s smile disappeared and he furrowed his brow at Draco.
pajamas. I want to give you a massage.” Harry balked, but Draco was instantly back and brushing his fingers against the skin over Harry’s ribs. “Relax, I said a massage and I mean just a massage. Please, just let me touch you…” Harry caved and nodded.
. Out of all the people in the world he’d expected to turn on him, Ron and Hermione had been his dauntless supporters. They’d always had each other’s backs, but now? Apparently asking them to accept Draco—who was a bloody
“When their feet aren’t on the floor?” Draco found himself echoing, confused and at a loss for what else to say. His visitor smiled.
He walked quickly, barely shaking off the nausea of Apparition before he was running. His feet took the stairs two at a time, fueled by some kind of panic as if Draco might hurt himself if he didn’t get there fast enough. The blond wouldn’t, but Harry didn’t refuse the burst of adrenaline.
Slowly, he took stock of the room he was in. It resembled what he imagined a cell in Azkaban might look like and was very effective at isolating him. He hadn’t spoken to Harry in what felt like years and the absence festered in him like a wound. Minnie hadn’t been allowed near him since the last incident and clever Hermione, after being found out for gathering information from him, had been banned as well. Hell, at this point he would have even taken a visit from Weasley.
Despite many attempts, Harry had never understood that particular quirk. Nevertheless, he watched the timer on the microwave and waited for the soft
“Draco!” He started out of his thoughts and realized he was gripping Harry’s hand hard enough to break it. Quickly, he loosened his grip but Harry was still staring at him. Shocked.
In their bedroom, Harry didn’t even have to look for the pair of sweats in question. They were tucked haphazardly beneath the pillows on the right side of the bed, where Draco had slept, and he grabbed them quickly, hoping that Draco wouldn’t see the location, but he wasn’t fast enough. Draco stood in the doorway, one hand clamped over his mouth.
"No, I'm afraid you're mistaken," Mrs. Magnolis said politely, but with an undercurrent of irritation. "The Malfoy family and I have been acquainted for years, yes, but I've asked Mr. Malfoy here in a professional capacity. He will be conducting his own investigation separately from the Ministry. I do hope that isn't a problem, Auror?"
“Thank you, Professor.” If it had been any other situation, Draco would have laughed at the way Harry maintained his professionalism with the woman no matter what. Even he did, which said something about the amount of respect the students had for her. But, when he called her professor, McGonagall’s face hesitated and then broke into a sad little smile that looked almost motherly. She reached for the boys, but seemed to think better of it. Instead, she just gave them both that little smile, letting her eyes linger on the way Draco’s fingers were winding through the brunet’s hair.
She was a widow, aged 57, and she was as close to pureblood as one could get without actually being one of the sacred twenty eight. Though the list and many of its prejudices had been thrown out after the war, the wealth remained within the older families that hadn't been wrought by reparation fines. It was understandable that she would be drawn to someone like Malfoy.
“Oh, no definitely not. They’re lumpy and the blue clashes horribly with the orange of the stems. They smell like rotten mushrooms—did you know mushrooms can rot? But they’re rare and difficult to find, which is it’s own kind of beautiful.”
"Thanks for cooking." Draco nodded, and they ate in a comfortable silence. Two bites in, Harry reached for the vodka and Draco made no comment, though he clearly saw it. Neither of them really drank much these days—Harry had been against it from the beginning, having grown up with the monster that Vernon became with the addition of alcohol, and Draco had simply said he was tired of it. It wasn't until their first night getting drunk together, after Lucius's funeral, that Draco had finally explained that little quip.
. He’d laughed at the formality of it the first few times, until he’d realized that the full name was part of a charm so that only he could read it.
, that night, not anyone else and they'd spent hours just trying to understand. Lucius had been a horrible, horrible person—but he was still Draco's father.
"Yes, the bagel, Crosby, don't you know you should always insult your food before eating it? No, I mean Malfoy!" He was being an ass and he knew it, but he also didn't particularly care. Crosby was good-humored and wouldn't take it personally. Harry would take him out for drinks later to apologize.
"No, I'm not allowed to talk to anyone about the case and he's still completely enraged from the scene in the Great Hall. He's grieving. People are saying that Lucius was his best friend and since he's Draco's godfather, that maybe he's next…"
“Lily,” he said quickly, trying not to think too hard about it.
“He gets hurt too, the same as me.” Harry stopped, Draco felt his presence stall halfway across the room, but he couldn’t let himself go back on it. “It’s true, Professor. We lean on each other, that’s what makes it bearable, but when my father gets to me I won’t be able to help him anymore. He gets the same treatment from his uncle and cousin that I do from my father.” Harry was crying, Draco could feel the shame and disbelief and sadness radiating off of his lion, but he had to do this. It was to protect Harry.
Lucius had been cruel from the start. Though they'd seemed nothing but close when Harry had first met them, there was more than enough truth in the way Draco just shattered after his death. Slowly, as if he didn't really trust it, and then all at once. It had hurt to watch because, as much as there was hurt and grief in those grey eyes, there had been much more relief. A guilty sense of security, knowing that both the protector and the threat were lying dead in the same coffin. Harry knew that guilt better than most.
“Lilies are beautiful. My favorite flower is a Blue-Bottomed Beetle. Ever heard of it?”
"Miss Le'Galle, if you would give our dear stand-in guardian a copy of the consent waiver forms?"
Thank you so, so much to everyone who's reviewed/commented!! It really does mean the world to me <3 As usual, I don't own HP or any of the characters, just this story/plot!
“Sorry, I won’t call you anything but Draco from now on. Is that okay?” He nodded, and tugged on Harry’s hand. “What? Is something wrong? Are you in pain? I can call Madame Pomfrey if you—”
. Harry was sick of being ashamed, he was sick of hiding, and he was done letting them treat him like shit. He took half a step back, and reached for Draco's hand—their signal, telling Draco it was okay to reveal their relationship. Because Harry needed him.
Harry stood calmly in black dress robes that Draco had helped him pick out for Fred’s funeral. The cemetery was practically empty, aside from the priest and two employees who were just waiting to lower the casket. Draco stood, completely stoic, beside his mother. Narcissa was crying softly, but neither Malfoy reached to comfort the other and Harry knew that they wouldn’t until the press stopped taking pictures. Pansy was there, surprisingly enough, but she kept to herself and didn’t make eye contact with any of them. Rita Skeeter, along with three or four other reporters, mingled throughout their awkwardly spaced little group asking questions and demanding statements.
“I mean I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner, I’m sorry I didn’t do anything. If anyone was going to see the signs, it would have been me, but even if I saw them I just couldn’t put two and two together. But I ignored them because, well, I hated you. And you pulled it off so well… I’m sorry, Draco.” He definitely was hallucinating, now, he thought, because no way in hell was Harry Potter sitting in front of him apologizing. No way, right?
"He's being questioned, same as you two. That's all I know for certain but my guess is that nothing will really come of it because he didn't duel or cast any Unforgivables. They're looking into the summoning spell, but I don't think they'll find anything. I'm sorry." He shook his head because, after all, it wasn't her fault, but hearing those facts still stung.
“Come to bed, in
"Okay?" Draco met his eyes and took a slow sip of his water.
"Yeah, you already told us that, genius. Next." He had to laugh, or at least snicker, at her annoyance. Merlin, how long had it been since he'd laughed? The motion felt strange and foreign, as if that had been lifetimes ago and not merely a day or two. Thankfully, Hermione didn't seem to notice his little tangent.
Harry was late getting home, like always, and he wanted nothing more than to walk in the door and collapse right then and there but he knew he couldn’t. He had to at least eat something, or he wouldn’t be able to sleep for long. Grudgingly, he threw a freezer meal into the microwave. Two minutes to cook, thirty seconds to eat, and then he could go to bed—burnt mouth and all.
"Of course, babe, anything." The best—or possibly worst—part was that Draco meant it completely. He would do anything to help, including let Harry ignore and avoid the problem all morning instead of just making a decision, but in that moment Harry didn't really care.
"Bloody git…" he mumbled, half talking into the bagel. Crosby raised an eyebrow at him and set down the paperwork he'd been reviewing.
He still blaunched whenever he saw how smoothly Draco could toss back shot after shot as if it was water. Secretly, he hated it, and he'd had nightmares for weeks after that first time. Images of a tiny blond boy, completely broken and taking shots of firewhiskey in a dark pantry. From what he could gather, he wasn't that far off.
"Actually,
“God, I missed you…” Draco just nodded and settled back down on his chest. “Stay with me tonight. Please, I haven’t been sleeping the last couple days and our bed feels empty without you.” Draco pulled back, enough to kneel between Harry’s legs on the couch and frown.
No one other than Pomfrey came, though. The stillness and the cold quiet of his room were familiar in all the wrong ways. It felt like the Manor when his father’s ‘guests’ came to stay or the oppressive silence of the halls when even the house elfs ran for cover. It would have been a relief to be allowed to run, now.
Narcissa, still crying, wiped her eyes and nodded to him before going to speak with Pansy. The women embraced, but Harry only saw the byproduct of their actions: Draco was now standing alone and vulnerable in front of the grave. He heard the clicking of camera shutters, but the blond didn’t even react.
“I love you too, asshole.” The sentence was bitter, but Harry couldn’t help laughing. Draco was staying. He could be pouty and he could act like he’d been dragged into this all he wanted, but he was staying. Just the thought made his chest a little lighter.
Now, though, Draco held the material like it might burn him and he ran his fingers over it in disbelief. Was he surprised that Harry hadn’t burned them? That was justified, but Harry had a feeling it wasn’t that because Draco had always known he was too sentimental to destroy things like that.
"Oh?" That was all Draco said, because he'd learned better than to push when Harry didn't want to share. It was nice not to feel that pressure, but Harry knew he'd have to tell him eventually. No time like the present, right?
under his breath. This would work. It
” He felt Harry jump at the Parseltongue, but it didn’t seem like Draco had surprised him. Rather, he seemed surprised by the language itself.
“I hate you…” There was no anger behind those words, though, and Harry had heard them enough times during their relationship to know what they really meant. Draco hated being emotional, and he hated breaking down in front of other people. He hated that Harry kept pushing him, and he hated that he couldn’t just shut down the way he did with everyone else—but he didn’t hate Harry.
” But Draco was already halfway across the room and ignoring Harry’s tears. This was for the best, he told himself, because he wouldn’t be able to live with himself if Harry suffered alone just because Draco had kept quiet.
"Because you're Harry Potter." They both looked up, shocked that Pomfrey had spoken let alone sounded so bitter. Through this entire order, she had remained as impartial as possible and focused on healing them whenever necessary, but now she had an opinion?
“Can I see?” Harry hated how timid Draco sounded in his own flat. It was
At first, everyone had been itching for any information that could be found about Malfoy's new business. Harry had fallen prey to that same curiosity—purely because he was surrounded by it day in and day out, not because he had any interest in it himself—and had taken some morally grey avenues to learn what he could.
Draco got them out and to an Apparition point, somehow, but all Harry could seem to comprehend was that word. He hadn't been called that since… fourth year, probably.
He stopped, his blood running cold.
He had to be.
"Hey, hey, it's okay. Look at me, baby, we're okay. We're home now. Do you want to sit up and get some tea?" As good as that sounded, Harry shook his head. Tea wouldn't help with this. He wasn't sure that anything would, honestly, but he buried his face into the pillow and tugged at Draco's hand. They'd been together long enough, and it wasn't a complicated signal, so Harry soon found himself joined under the covers by a fully clothed blond. He curled wordlessly into Draco's chest, not caring if he smeared tears all over the white dress shirt.
Bracing himself, Draco looked up. He was expecting Prew, but hoping for Pierre or Pomfrey. Even Miss Le’Galle, with all her dark intelligence and malicious sneer, would have been a more familiar and tolerable sight.
” Beside him, Harry sighed. He squeezed Draco’s shoulders again, letting the blond momentarily bask in his warmth, but leaned their heads together as they watched the two adults argue.
“I knew you weren’t okay.” Draco forced a deep breath, but Harry could already see that it wasn’t working. He knew better than to rush the blond, but he couldn’t just stand there and watch him suffer so he wordlessly held his arms open. For a second, Draco just stared at him. Then, he took a step closer.
he made it out of this, they would talk. He would make sure of it.
“I understand,” Luna replied quietly, sounding as if she somehow actually did. “You don’t know who she is anymore.”
"Draco."
. You're also the only person I know who can put up with my bullshit, which is a pretty freaky phenomenon if I do say so myself. But, hey, at least you're not a Death Eater."
“I love you,” Harry tried again, whispering the words like he wasn’t sure how Draco would take them. He prayed that it wouldn’t be the final straw, but he had no idea what was going on in that beautiful mind or if Draco was even still awake so he just waited. As if on cue, the body against his sighed.
“One of us has to be, and it wasn’t going to be you.” Draco eased his hands from Harry’s waist up under his shirt, lingering over scars and muscles the way Harry had on the couch less than an hour earlier. Harry stayed still, afraid to break whatever was happening between them. He let Draco take off his tie, his button up, his undershirt, and his belt before he stopped him. Draco’s hands were steady, though, even as he held them.
“No.” Snape continued, pretending not to have heard him.
“Indeed, I have.” He stood, moving towards the gap in the curtains drawn around Draco’s temporary prison bed. “Draco, darling, may I offer you some advice?”
He sighed and set them on the bed, which Harry was certain was a sign that Draco was leaving, but rather than block the door he just stood there. If Draco wanted to leave, then he would leave. As much as that killed him, Harry would… Wait a second. Draco was undressing?
Maybe Malfoy threatened his clients into secrecy? But that didn't make any sense. Malfoy would want the publicity because past testimonials were the only form of currency when it came to reeling in new clients. It was more likely that the clients themselves demanded confidentiality and Malfoy merely obliged them. Just from the few that Harry had heard of he could gather that Malfoy worked in some very high-profile circles.
” Harry gave him another look and squeezed his shoulders but Draco was not about to let this go. There were a lot of things that Harry could just gloss over with little movements like that, little protective touches or little kisses to distract him, and Draco never really minded. But this was different, this was too important.
Draco doubted that highly. Minnie was probably worried—their vow weighed on the woman, which Draco tried not to think about for very long—and Harry was probably sick with fear. No one else would care.
“Please. No sex, no talking or arguing, just sleeping. I have the sweats you love and a ton of your clothes are still here if you’d prefer.” Harry swallowed hard, trying not to cry at the look of disbelief on Draco’s face. Had he pushed too far? He should have just let the blond go and went back to his sad little life alone, but his entire being ached at the idea of sleeping alone tonight. Now that he remembered what Draco felt like in his arms, what Draco smelled like, tasted like…
It struck Draco with a disturbing amount of clarity just how true that statement was. He had never known his mother outside of Lucius’ reign. They’d had moments throughout his childhood where he thought he’d glimpsed the real Narcissa or when they’d been alone and he could see her discontent, but so much of her being revolved around Lucius. Everything she’d ever done had been calculated to fit around Lucius’ desires.
"So, I'm sure I'll be swore to secrecy soon and a lot of the details haven't come out yet but I wanted to let you know what I could before I have to take an oath. Your father is dead. They tried to revive him, of course, but with the curse that you
It was publicly known, by now, that Narcissa had saved his life during the final battle—which was why she lived freely at the Manor, and not in a cell beside Lucius. Still, Harry wasn’t going to take the chance of calling attention to the Malfoys. He could have said he was there to support Narcissa because, after all, they had kept in contact after the trials but he didn’t trust that the media’s scrutiny would stop there. The last thing he needed was people questioning or making up stories about him and Draco.
AN I don't own HP or any of the characters! I plan to expand this and already have a few more scenes written so I hope to update as promptly as possible.
“Of course I’ll go. What’s the event?” As much as he wished it would be some Ministry gala or some promotional ceremony, he knew Draco wouldn’t have come for something so tame. No, if Draco was here and asking for help, it had to be something bad. Something that the blond didn’t trust himself to face on his own.
Part of him wished that the blond felt safe enough to just Apparate into their flat—because it was still
“You’re fucking with me.” He shook his head, feeling Draco shift his weight a bit against his legs. As long as Draco didn’t leave, he didn’t care what they talked about. But the utter disbelief in the blond’s voice rivaled that of when he’d been given the sweats and Harry once again felt his chest ache. Draco had thought Harry had moved on.
"Draco, actually, but you can call me Mr. Malfoy if Draco is too hard to remember." That was all he said—which, frankly, impressed Harry because he'd expected Draco to go off on her the second he had a chance to—but it was more than enough to fluster Petunia. She gaped like a fish out of water, and then turned back to him.
"Mr. Malfoy, you're denying using the only curse known to cause instantaneous death while showing no outward symptoms?" Even the scribe who was dutifully writing every word they said looked doubtful, but Draco took a deep breath. Remember the plan.
Would his father really have done something like that? On one hand, it seemed far too showy and surface level but, on the other hand, it would have gotten attention off of them long enough for him to drag Draco out of there. Provided he obeyed, of course, which he hadn't. Could a person even duplicate a boggart, though? He had no idea and had never even considered it, honestly, but it gave him hope that someone like Hermione was looking into it.
“What do you mean you’re sorry?” Harry’s smile faded, though, and he traded his hand for the one holding Draco’s on his chest. He squeezed it slightly.
"I underestimated you, Draco." He shrugged. Honestly, he was shocked that they were talking like friends at all. He definitely didn't expect anything close to an apology from her, not after everything they'd been through, but he appreciated the friendship. It felt reminiscent of Molly, actually. An acknowledgment that they had history, but a deeper appreciation and warped sort of respect for him because of what he meant to Harry. That thought was still foreign to him, but he wasn't going to refuse the olive branch. Now, of all times, he needed the company.
“Does your mother know you’re here?”
"I think that was their hope." Draco didn't respond, but Harry felt his disapproval in the air. Ever the aristocrat, Draco was a stickler for punctuality and polite formalities—like sending invitations with ample time to make schedule adjustments, or signing letters personally. The blond glared at the piece of paper, no doubt noticing the typed print and the lack of any handwriting or personalization.
"Hey Draco, can I ask you something?" Fuck. Draco knew, of course, that the questions were coming but that didn't make it any easier to face. What if she asked about his father? Or, worse yet, the killing curse? He just shrugged, though, and put all of his energy into his keeping his face impassive. Hermione was a friend—sort of—but right now it was him and his lion against the world, regardless of anyone else. Apparently, he'd been silent long enough to be seen as an agreement.
This was them. He relaxed into the routine like falling into bed after a hard day, and he was pleased to feel Draco do the same. Being emotional like that always drained the blond. Harry hadn’t really slept well since he’d heard about the funeral, but that worry evaporated now that he could hold Draco and assure himself that they were okay. Not back together, but both in one piece.
Harry knew, realistically, that being back with Draco should have felt at least a little strange because he should have gotten used to having tons of space or moving around a silent flat. But, strangely enough, the opposite was true. It felt like those ten months of separation had just been some kind of blip. Like, now that they were physically together again, the previous—and correct—timeline could resume.
"Many students and professors attest to hearing you giving commands to Mr. Malfoy and using the Imperius Curse in Parseltongue. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
"Do you want to go?" Of course Draco wouldn't just give him a straight answer. He'd known that before he'd even asked the question but it still irked him. Just once, he wanted someone to just tell him which decision was the right one—but Draco wasn't like that, and he hadn't ever been. Usually, that was one of the things Harry loved about him.
"Bed?" Draco laughed, the sound barely audible and the vibrations echoing into Harry's body. That kind of laugh was his favorite, because it always felt like a secret. Like Draco was trying to hold it in, or be quiet, so no one else would know he was amused—even if they were alone—but he always let Harry feel it through some form of contact.
to work because there was only one other person in the world who could speak Parseltongue and they were never going to get Voldemort in front of the Wizengamot. They could pull memories all they wanted, but they only had Draco or Harry to translate them. And they could test their wands a thousand times, but the only thing they would be able to see was the shield charm he'd cast using both wands after the duel. This had to work, didn't it?
It wasn't that he blamed Draco—he more than understood the motivation, and the addiction to the escape—it was that he hated himself for being so blind to it. Draco had practically been an alcoholic for most of their childhood, and Harry had never had a clue. He hated that Draco was so good at hiding it when things got bad, and he hated that their relationship hadn't come with a magic pair of glasses that could see through that exterior. Over the years, he'd gotten better at it. But, he still knew that Draco had managed to slip through his scrutiny and his interrogations more than once, preferring to isolate himself and suffer alone rather than trouble Harry.
“Hey, how are you?” Harry wasn’t sure why he even bothered, because he knew the blond wouldn’t return the pleasantries. Since the breakup, he had tried to contact his beautiful ex at least a hundred times—only about half of which had been while drunk—and Draco had been firmly against even writing to each other. The blond wouldn’t have come without a reason, and a good one at that. Still, Harry found himself inspecting the man in his kitchen.
Draco had no idea who the hell John and Mary were but was beyond the point of caring. No aspect of how Luna got her information, processed it, or expressed it made any sense to him but it evidently did to her. He shrugged and glanced over to the wall where a window should have been. They’d sealed it with stone, though.
"Protective, I suppose, and caring." It was true, but Hermione brushed him off with a laugh.
"And did you, or did you not, hear Mr. Malfoy cast an Unforgivable Curse?"
"He's what, 'Mione?" She just looked to the floor because they both knew what she was going to say. He was a junior Death Eater, he was the son who'd killed his father, he was the Slytherin who'd tormented Harry in the public eye for years, and he was widely hated because of his father's reputation. No one would bat an eye if he was convicted or, God forbid, executed.
"You're a cop? Well, I have to say I didn't see you that way but I suppose I can't fault you for it. Though why they would allow you to enforce rules when all you ever do is break them, I couldn't say. I'm also not completely certain what your friends occupation has to do with my question, or with your income status. Jacob, was it?" Beside him, the blond flashed her a sickly sweet smile. It reminded him so much of Narcissa that Harry almost did a double take, but then those beautiful pale lips were moving.
"Where is he?" Hermione winced and took his hand. "'Mione, I'm not going to ask again." He shouldn't have made his voice so harsh and he knew he shouldn't be taking his anxiety out on her, but he didn't trust anyone else enough at the moment to risk showing a vulnerability.
"Actually, Mr. Malfoy, you did. By committing an Unforgivable crime, you waived your right to legal representation, your right to refuse Veritaserum, your right to a trial, and quite a few others. I'm sure someone will gladly read the paperwork to you but, for the moment, we're on a bit of a tight schedule." That was utter bullshit and even Pierre seemed to think so, crossing his little stick arms in front of him like some kind of paper doll. He said nothing, though, and Draco was too distracted by Le'Galle.
“My father.” He was so emotionless as he said it, but Harry knew by now that that meant he was just trying that much harder to hide the jumbled mess of emotions in his chest. They’d been to enough funerals that they’d both seen each other break, more than once. Still, Harry had to bite his lip to keep from prying for more information. He wanted to see tears and he wanted to hear how much it hurt in that beautiful voice because he knew that he was the only person who got to see Draco like that. That wasn’t his place anymore, though.
“Is Harry okay?” He had to ask, even though he knew he wouldn’t get an answer. The Aurors were just on the other side of the door, no doubt listening and probably recording this conversation, but he had to ask. Luna gave him an odd little smile.
"Okay."
AN I do not own HP or any of the characters! Please no flames!
"You want to be straight?" He laughed, even if he was kind of crying and also kind of serious, because coming from his boyfriend of three years that sounded ridiculous. Even if it was just a tiny bit true.
"Where's Minnie?" Pierre scrunched his face into a sympathetic smile, as if he were addressing a child who hadn't gotten their way, and mumbled something about legal integrity. Though he didn't seem like a particularly helpful man, he didn't seem all that bad so Draco let his attention shift to the other two people in the room. They stood behind his hospital bed, just out of his line of sight, and he had no doubt that that was intentional. He could feel their presence, though. One breathed far too loudly, and the other felt… familiar?
“Why would it have been you? Who saw the signs, I mean.” Harry gave him a wistful little smile and squeezed his hand again. Surprisingly, though, it didn’t make him anxious or make him feel like he was trapped, it actually felt secure. Like a tether grounding him amidst his emotions.
Wordlessly, Harry handed over the sweats. They were a deep burgundy color with the Gryffindor crest on the right thigh and the word
"You really love him, don't you?" Their eyes met. A strange, grudging kind of respect seemed to weave its way into her tone. She almost looked… awed? It felt very, very strange but Draco was content to wait it out so long as she didn't start asking about anything dangerous. Slowly, Hermione chewed her lower lip.
AN I do not own HP or any of the characters! Please no flames!
AN I don't own HP or any of the characters! Content warning for physical assault. I know I've been dead/MIA for a while now and I'm sorry but I'm back with hopefully more regular updates! Enjoy!
Draco avoided his upper thighs, his ass, and anywhere that could have been considered sexual but Harry didn’t mind. This was about being connected, not aroused. That said, he couldn’t help but groan when he felt a hard, cloth-covered bulge press into his ass. Above him, Draco chuckled and continued massaging along his shoulder blades as if he was completely innocent. Harry was not convinced, but he stayed still nevertheless.
He shook his head, trying not to work himself up only to be reminded of the restraints on his limbs. Four hours… As long as he just kept breathing and took it four hours at a time, he could get this through this. Nevermind the fact that being away from Harry and unable to communicate, even in Parseltongue, forced panic through his veins and nevermind the fact that everyone around him aside from Pomfrey seemed to want him dead. Just four hours at a time, and he would be okay.
I have returned from the dead! Turns out moving to a new country during covid is an ordeal in and of itself but things are hopefully calming down now and I truly hope to be able to post and update more frequently/regularly now. Enjoy!
“I’m listening. I’ve told you the same story at least a hundred times by now and if the Ministry can put this much effort into a death investigation for known Death Eater, I don’t understand why nothing is being done about the accusations of child abuse, neglect, and torture.”
The funeral ended, and the coffin was lowered into the ground. Workers began filling in the dirt like they had timecards to punch and didn’t care that the grieving family was still standing right there. It was the family of a Death Eater, though, and Harry knew that that was what let them be so blatant about it.
"Yeah, it's an invitation to a memorial service. My uncle died." Draco's eyes darkened a bit inexplicably, but he just took another slow drink from his mug.
” Draco hadn’t meant to make the golden boy flinch, and guilt brewed in his gut when Harry curled in on himself a bit, but he stayed quiet. That was the only reasonable explanation he could think of. McGonagall might have pretended to be upset that Lucius was abusing his own son, but she wouldn’t have cared. Not really. If Harry had come clean about the Dursleys, though, he could see the woman going full mother hen and protecting her favorite student.
are worth it to me.” Draco was crying steadily, now, but Harry didn’t care. He tangled a hand in those blond strands and merely held him, having said his peace.
They were breathing in sync now, and Harry’s eyelids were getting heavier by the second. He hadn’t expected Draco to say it back, but the silence was comfortable enough between them that he knew the blond wasn’t mad. Draco had never minded honesty, even if it wasn’t what he’d wanted to hear at the time.
"I've told you at least a hundred times now, Archibald, I didn't poison Harry or his food." Prew glowered at him. Having failed to introduce himself using his first name, Draco had resorted to pettily calling him by more and more ridiculous names just to even out the power imbalance between them. 'Mr. Prew' was too formal, too respectful, but names like Herbert and Mortimer? The perfect degree of childish petulance.
Already, people were asking why he was there. He’d come prepared with a story, explaining that, even though he and Lucius had never been friends, he’d still known the man and was saddened by his death. When asked if his Azkaban sentence or if his receiving the Kiss changed Harry’s opinion of him, Harry had merely glared. Did how he died make him any less dead?
"That's not a feeling, Mr. Potter." He ignored Pomfrey and her tutting, though, instead choosing to focus his energy on Hermione who had taken a seat beside his bed. She didn't look happy, but she at least hadn't been crying so nothing could have gone too horribly wrong, right?
That single step was all it took to completely shatter the resolve that either of them had. Harry met him halfway, and Draco buried himself in the black robes that he’d helped pick out as if he could disappear into the material. The tears came readily, but Harry just tangled a hand in his hair and held him. This was them. This was the routine that they’d developed and followed for three years of funerals and sentencings and heartache. Three years…
“Is an almighty Slytherin asking me for cuddles?” Draco flushed bright red at the word and the jeer in Harry’s voice but the smile was still there, and not at all malicious. He was teasing him, Draco realized, but it was almost playful. No anger, no hatred. That alone made Draco whine and pull the other’s arm again but Harry just laughed.
"Right, because you wouldn't know anything about that." Her face bloomed into a smile when she realized what he was getting at, and she was clearly shocked that Harry had told him but she merely smiled at the page.
"No, of course not, everyone knows that that title is mine," Harry chuckled, even if his eyes never left the letter. "But he was still your uncle." He nodded, letting Draco settle against his back and tuck his chin over Harry's shoulder. Of all the people in Harry's life who had lost family, Draco was one of the only ones who had even the slightest chance of understanding the situation. Harry severely disliked Uncle Vernon. He had since he was a child, and he'd never went as far as to call that feeling hatred but it was certainly negative. Still, he felt the loss.
After a few words from Narcissa, Draco kissed her on the cheek and Apparated. Hundreds of cameras seemed to catch that moment, but Narcissa ignored it and merely repeated her earlier request for decency. For a moment, Harry thought she might not have noticed her son’s disappearance. She had, though, and made that very clear when her eyes caught his through the chaos. A single nod was all it took.
“Of course I love you, idiot.” They both smiled a bit. The warmth Harry had fought off earlier came rushing back but he let it this time, convinced that he deserved to feel it. Because Draco still loved him. He’d known that on some level, of course, but it still felt unbelievably good to hear it.
“I'm proud of you.” He couldn't believe his ears. There was no way. There was no fucking way that Harry Potter—savior of the entire wizarding world—was sitting here in his hospital bed saying he was proud of him. No one had ever said those words to him. There was no way they were coming from anyone, let alone Harry Potter.
“It’s true,” Luna continued. “A lot of people think you went insane. They’ve been calling you Mad, Mad Malfoy but personally I don’t think that’s very creative. Last names and alliteration can only go so far, you know?”
“Hey, you’re okay. Just breathe.” He obeyed without even realizing. Who was touching him, though? Pomfrey hadn’t touched him, at least not when it wasn’t absolutely necessary, since the incident in third year where he’d had a panic attack and none of the professors would dare lay a hand on him. Would they?
Harry had always hated how formal his lover was, but he learned to see the value in it. Draco used it as a defense mechanism and, the more he’d began to open up, the more Harry appreciated everything that it hid. The blond was many things, but well adjusted was not one of them.
“Severus, what are you doing here?” The man looked up from his book, as though bored of Draco’s presence already. Warning and apprehension coiled deep in Draco’s stomach but he kept his face neutral. If Snape had wanted to kill him, he would have already done it.
that would announce his lover’s arrival.
Until Petra Magnolis had gone and ruined it for everyone.
Fridays, though, both of them went in late. They spent the morning completely and utterly alone together, doing whatever the hell they felt like, and it was honestly the best part of Harry's week. Trust the Dursleys to ruin that.
“Malfoy,
They end up making a mess. He expects Potter to be angry. Instead Potter comes in and laughs. He ends up being trashed in the batter as well. Draco looks around and realizes what a mess everything is right now.
He does not let Harry finish whatever he was saying, instead he pulls him up and jumps up on him. Saying yes before he was even asked. He does not hear the loud cheer of the Weasleys behind him. He only notices how Harry tears up and kisses him harder than he ever has. He does not let go. He is being crushed by Harry and he won't let go. He thinks he might fall if he does.
Teddy is killing me. He won’t stop asking about you. He knows you are his only family alive and he really wants to meet you again. I know it’s a lot to ask, but for a child’s sake please consider. Set up a date and time and I’ll bring Teddy over to meet you again.
The room has once again become an obstacle course, though this time, it appears more difficult than the last. It seems that with every time he visits the room, the obstacle challenge never gets easier. Draco assures him it also looks harder from an outsider’s perspective. Which means he is getting more and more comfortable in this form. If he could survive in it for a fair amount of time, that would be best.
“Right,” Hari agrees, smiling brightly, “so I’ll see you on the seventh.”
“Brilliant idea,” Lord Flint agrees. With all ruffled feathers soothed, they move into discussing titles. Which isn’t a discussion, really, but more of mutual ranting about Dumbledore’s ineptitude and misunderstanding of wix culture. As this occurs, their lunch is delivered.
“Sorry, Draco,” Hari tries, “I should’ve told you.”
“Sounds good to me,” Daphne agrees. They hurry down the steps to the dungeon and knock calmly at his tapestry.
“Hello, Lord Potter,” they say, somewhat doubtfully.
“One moment, Critter.” Hari turns to Draco, “where would you like to talk?”
“Critter, will there still be enough kneazles to continue the breeding program if I sell all of these?”
Draco glares at Luna, “nothing to worry about?”
“Hey, everyone,” he smiles up at them. They take their seats and the train lurches, starting the trip to Hogwarts. Hari starts Hermione’s design, settling on one he’d seen in pictures Sirius gave him of his
“Clever, Lord Potter,” he says just as the bell rings once more to indicate the start of the final period.
Draco sets about reading the properties of the woods Professor McGonagall specifically wanted them to look at. By the time he’s done reading, every quill in the room is scratching away.
“If you could come back in two hours to collect your items, they will be ready.”
“You, too, Miss Lovegood,” Hari smiles at her.
“I’d come shake your hand, but I’m cooking at the moment,” Mrs. Granger apologizes.
“It is,” Critter confirms. There are three doors on the other side and one at the end of the hall. “These are being the nursery and two studies. The Head of House’s study is being at the end of the hall.”
“Rough, right?” Hari asks, smiling gently.
“You’re lucky I got your measurements from Mr. Lazwell or we’d be in that store far longer than two hours,” she snaps. Hari sighs, but lets it go. “Come on, ‘Mia, let’s go get you some pretty robes.” She tosses the slip with Hari’s measurements at him and drags Hermione off. Daphne shoots him an apologetic glance, but races off after them.
“Ah, probably lunch,” Hari suggests. Critter nods eagerly and pops away.
“Homework,” Hari calls over his shoulder and rounds the corner.
would never give you anything. And anything you got for yourself, they’d take. It’s a normal reaction,” Draco promises, “so don’t feel guilty. Anytime you feel off about anything, you tell me. We can always talk it out, or make changes so you don’t. Okay?”
Hermione comes back with a bag hanging by her hip.
“We do,” Draco confirms. Remus nods and pushes Hari gently back to Draco, who’s arms are extended, waiting.
“Of course, thank you.”
“Merlin, I hope so,” Hari sighs. “If it’s much longer than that, tell your father to come rescue me.”
“Hey!” Draco snaps.
Her testimony is brief and her voice wavers a few times, but her face is stiff and she manages not to shed a single tear.
“I blame you two for this,” Hari informs her and Lucius, who just laughs silently.
“Alright, one hour to curfew, let’s get through this!” Blaise pumps a fist in the air, “Draco, you’re up.”
“Yes, yes, as promised!” Critter nods excitedly. “Miss Hermione is calling Critter if she is wanting anything.”
“Two years ago, on the day after the students arrived at Hogwarts, a student of Slytherin House knocked at my quarters, appearing frantic. They informed me that they didn’t know exactly what was wrong, but that one of their friends had seen something and sent them to tell me. This friend had asked that the victim be seen by Madam Pomfrey as discreetly as possible, so as to not reveal that they had told.” It’s the first time Hari is hearing this and his eyes flash to Draco. Daphne had stepped out of the bathroom. Draco was gone when he exited the bathroom. It’s hard to be mad, though, when it probably saved his life. “The list of evidence I was provided with as a basis for concern was the victim’s extreme effects of undernutrition and the fact they had never been taught to properly spell their name.
