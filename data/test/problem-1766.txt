A sudden sharp pain hit him in the left arm, followed by a terrible burning.
“I suppose I could stand some fresh air.”
The next week he fared a bit better - it still rained, but there were rats in three different shops seeking refuge from the flooding - yet he spent all his hard-earned Knuts on a number of books for his mother. He still regretted being short with her, and knew she was bored to tears. The ersatz apple cart was in the hall again, and on his departure he snagged a lovely green one.
“You know I do, don’t you? The empty space you imagined, it’s not there. It’s full.”
They followed single-file, the witch casting glances over her shoulder at Draco every so often. He thought the path was different from last time, but for all he knew the rooms rearranged themselves continuously.
Draco couldn't contain the sob that welled up in his throat. "Oh!" One hand flew to his mouth; the other tightened on the photo until the corner creased. "Oh," he said in a softer voice. "He looks so happy."
House-elf magic had been sustaining them during their purgatory before sentencing. Fires were lit, food was cooked, beds were made. But there were other subtle things that had occurred throughout the house, and Draco knew what was happening. His father had once held Abraxas Malfoy's wand in a case in his office. Sometime during the Dark Lord's stay in their home, the case had disappeared, almost as if Lucius had foreseen the need to have a backup. It must have been hidden somewhere very safe to miss the Auror's sweep of the house. Perhaps their detection spells simply didn't pick it up - it was only a wand after all, not a Dark artifact. Lucius
that?”
were running on a loop in Draco’s mind, pictures that he couldn’t blink away. “Potter,” he uttered, then trailed off, unsure of what he meant to say. He certainly couldn’t voice the overwhelming sense of need that washed over him when he turned back and locked eyes with the man in front of him.
"You, Harry, and the wards? Yes, that makes sense."
Did he somehow not remember?
He’s more alert now than when Draco found him. “Malfoy,” he says wetly. “Malfoy, what’s happening?”
A ring of the bell above the door put an end to their banter, signalling the arrival of the topic at hand. Malfoy was dressed in a silver trimmed travelling cloak, wearing what appeared to be snakeskin boots. It was a far cry from the comfortable scholar look he’d sported in his own home. Harry supposed the display of wealth was Malfoy’s own sort of armour, donned especially for venturing out in Diagon.
“Honestly. Why they didn’t teach Latin at Hogwarts I’ll never know. Yes, I can read it. It says
Blaise set his empty coffee cup down with a clatter. “Draco can take care of himself. You know the second he settles back in at home, Narcissa is going to parade him around to every crusty old pure-blood grandmother trying to make a match, with a list of all the remaining Malfoy vaults, properties, and peacocks, and sell him off to the most well-connected, respectable prospect. He’s going to be miserable, we’re going to be miserable from listening to him whinge, and whoever his bride is will be miserable as well. Didn’t you say he was the most awful kisser, back in fifth year?” Both Draco and Pansy turned varying shades of red, but Blaise continued on. “That’s what happens when you try to make arranged marriages work. Bad sex and misery all around. Not to mention we’ve seen what trouble Draco gets up to when he’s bored. So this is all for the best! Draco gets to stay occupied, I get to stay sane, and you don’t have to worry about finding the right dress for a fancy wedding that no one wants.” He drew a long breath, and finished with, “And just because you’re on a diet doesn’t mean the rest of us have to suffer. By the way, croissants have just as much fat as waffles.”
“Are you being brave?” Potter teased. “That’s very Gryffindor of you.”
Draco is aware of what happened in the Forbidden Forest at the end of the war. He thinks it pitiful, that his mother should save Potter’s life only to have to end it himself.
“So there are certain things expected of me, see.”
“Maybe.” Goyle made an offended noise, but Malfoy continued. "He's been overprotective of that snake lately."
Harry did swallow his pride, and made his way to see Draco after giving him another couple days to cool down. Ginny had the right idea; he and Draco both had things to explain, but someone needed to take the first step.
“I’m standing right here,” Malfoy complained, before snapping his mouth shut again. Apparently his snarky tendencies overrode even his fear of a Bat-Bogey Hex.
A few of last year’s leaves still covered the forest floor, and they crunched as Harry walked over them. Malfoy appeared to stride beside him, but his steps were soundless.
“Hmm. So it is.” She retreated into the dining room.
"Right for him, or for me?"
The wonder in Harry's eyes had been worth the wait. "I was too afraid to say it before," Draco admitted. "And then the time didn't seem right. But I do. I love you, Harry."
“Sorry,” Draco said, obviously embarrassed.
It’s just as well he’s never going back there.
Draco didn’t speak, either to beg or protest, but after ten minutes of deep, incessant pounding, he finally broke and reached down to take himself in hand. Harry slapped his fingers away and squeezed the base of his dick. “Not yet,” he said through gritted teeth. He wanted to enjoy this first time as long as possible.
Potter was worried that there was still coercion involved. Draco took a very deep breath. “Potter,” he said, quite deliberately. “I can promise you that whatever was revealed by that… incident, it has only illuminated things for me, not changed my mind.”
"It was after I kissed Dean, there was no 'sucking' involved." He turned contemplative. "I'm pretty sure she knows about us, though."
“Don’t you have a match to play?” he grumbled. A shadow fell over her; Harry recognised it as her game face.
“You forget I grew up as a Muggle. And we didn’t live there, just went to classes. I never even declared a course of study.” That was simply a lack of filing; he’d mostly taken classes in Education, feeling drawn to that department.
Really, they could use a more concise editor.
With obvious relief, Potter grinned. “You know,” he offered, “if it would make you more comfortable, you can invite a friend or two. That dining room table is massive.”
“It hurts to have it compressed,” he admitted reluctantly.
“The other one is worse. You’ll have to go higher on my right arm, I suppose. It will need a deeper bite, but it can’t be helped.”
to feel it. And it didn't matter, because it could never happen, yeah? So many horrible things have come between us, and you didn't feel the same."
going to Hell, trapped by the dark magic performed by and around him, imprinted in his very skin? Was there a Hell at all? Was there even a Heaven?
“You know why I left the Aurors?” he said at last.
Potter has dragged Draco’s arm over to himself at an odd angle, and they are bent uncomfortably close to each other. Draco rests his forehead against Potter’s shoulder for a moment, breathing deep, measured breaths as Potter drinks. He’s slowly warming up as he gorges on Draco’s lifeblood, and again Draco is struck by the intimacy of it. Sitting here on a bed, curled into each other, Draco pressed against Potters mouth as he
“I know a bit,” Harry grumbled. “I could tell they were runes.”
On Monday, the Floo spat Draco out into an uncertain situation. He’d spent the weekend tossing and turning in bed, or pacing the house, moving between cleaning and sleeping. He still had no idea how he should speak to Potter—friendly, like before? Professionally? Not at all?
“I didn’t find any real force,” Draco cautioned. “There were multiple layers of mental and emotion-based spells, though. It began with a calming spell, similar to the Draught we’re familiar with. That’s what we felt first, the disorientation. There was also an effect that I’ve only seen in potions, that functions similar to alcohol.”
“Two weeks?”
“About things that are bothering you, I mean.”
"You were watching," he realised, backing up a step, away from Potter's fury. "You saw me."
"You're not my favourite person, either," Potter said, and Draco inexplicably thought he detected hurt in his voice. "I do think it will be good for Julian to be with you, though. You miss him so much, you'll be excited to see him, yeah? He'll feel very special."
"Have to get a local for the stall, then. Still, we've had trouble keeping people year-round up in Craik, so we might as well take you. I'll have a Portkey here for you Monday. You won't be getting paid for yesterday, by the way, what with the way you took off like that."
“Get away from me. I need…”
“Alright then.”
Neon.
"Oh, no Potter. You're the guest.
"Who are you talking to?"
Draco felt as if he were holding his breath on the entire journey out of the Department of Mysteries. True to his word, Harry left the wands when he retrieved his own. Draco had confirmed Rookwood's handwriting on the tome Hermione obtained with the ritual instructions, and all bottles of the offending potions were poured out save one of each. Not until the four of them were stepping through the Floo back at Malfoy Manor did they allow themselves a sigh of relief.
“It’s a good world, for the most part,” Harry offered.
"I..."
“We?” Harry was taken aback. For all she was helping him, he and Parvati weren't close.
"No. Let's go to the cabin." Draco groaned as he shifted Julian in his arms. "Gracious, Po- Harry, he is
“Nonsense, you’ve been working all day.”
“Yeah, that’s it. Suck it like you mean it.”
“I’ve never seen a Nargle either, but Vospul Bats are well documented. They migrate to Scandinavia for the winter, but no one is sure where they breed in spring yet. The fact that they Apparate makes them even harder to track. Considering how valuable their guano is in certain potions, it would be a breakthrough to find their nesting grounds.” Draco took a deep breath. “Also, Luna is one of the only people who talked to me while I was completing my studies. She gave me a chance, and forgave me after… well. You know. I think I might be a hermit if it weren’t for her encouraging me to make connections with others in my field, or facilitating job offers for me. So you can see why I’m a bit defensive of her.”
“Muggle London?!” Harry couldn’t keep the shock from his voice.
Potter’s lauded green eyes were wide and curious. “I want to hear about that sometime, how this became your job.”
"Draco looooves Harry."
“I’ll figure it out eventually,” Granger insisted. “Still, Harry cooks well enough for all of us. I’m so pleased you took our advice about trying new things.”
Gingerly he sat on the bed, trying not to wake Harry. He was so handsome in the moonlight, though, that Draco couldn't help but touch him, smoothing a stray lock of hair from his face. The famous scar hadn't faded at all after the war, a stark reminder of exactly who Harry was and what he'd been through. Draco swallowed back the feeling that he didn't deserve this, didn't deserve Harry, after everything he'd done.
“That house is massive!”
want that. He also wanted his old bed, his gardens, his vast and wonderful bath. Time and distance from the Manor had eased the memory of those terrifying last years there, with the Dark Lord in residence, and left only the nostalgia.
“Worked out great for me!” Weasley scooped up a large helping of leeks.
"So it's possible they stopped before they reached yours." Hermione didn't look as encouraged at the news as Draco hoped. "I have to be honest with you, it's also possible they used yours purposefully after the first few incidents, hoping less time with the Mark would result in more power but less instability."
So Malfoy wasn’t allowed to leave Britain. Maybe that was why he seemed so jealous of Harry’s expeditions. “Is that why you didn’t go into Potions, then? I’d always imagined it was your favourite subject.”
Harry regarded him coolly, and then held Julian out; Draco took him unthinkingly. His little brother curled up in his arms immediately.
Malfoy sat at a desk in the corner, scratching a quill along one piece of parchment while surrounded by several others, including a pile on the floor. He didn't look quite as Harry had briefly imagined — there was no dust on any books, and no tongue to be seen — but his hair
now, and buy sundries, and maybe even save enough to buy a down duvet for the winter.
"He wasn't at his best in that moment. I'd rather not talk about it, actually."
“You said you wanted to catch up. I'd also like that.”
, he swore to himself as his tears fell freely.
"I knew you loved me," he said, softer now. "I know you love me still. I think I'd go mad here in this house if it weren't for you." He turned away, tears pricking his eyes. This conversation had taken on a terrible sense of finality. "And you must know that I love you more than anything."
Potter is inside him, and he is inside Potter.
There Harry paused, unsure how to sign off. In formal letters he used ‘sincerely,’ and with his friends he said ‘love.’ What could be in between? ‘Yours?’ That made Harry blush furiously. In the end he decided to just leave his name.
“Left wrist today, then. You’ve torn the other one up enough that it needs a couple days for the Dittany paste to set.”
If anyone had told Draco he would crave this sort of life, only three years ago, he would have called them mad. Back then he couldn't afford to think about the future, only fulfilling the vulgar task assigned to him, and everything after had been pure survival. But this is what people did, wasn't it? Had families and enjoyed them.
. Fuck the myths about vampires — as far as Draco knows, they don’t have hypnotic powers, they aren’t especially gifted in bed, and their bite is anything but sexual.
Potter looked small within the bustling crowd around him. Every other witch or wizard who passed him gawked, but he gamely ignored them. Instead he smiled at the baby he was holding - Teddy, apparently - and adjusted its cap. Draco ticked the months off on his hand; there was no way that baby was Potter and Weasley's, not unless he'd snuck back into Hogwarts sometime before the Battle and no one found out. While that definitely wasn't beyond a reckless, romantic Gryffindor, Draco was pretty sure that Potter had a one track mind in the last days of the war, and risking the Carrows just to fuck Ginny Weasley hadn't been part of his plan.
“No?”
"Do you miss her?"
"Harry, please," he whispered between kisses, knowing how hot it made Harry when he begged. "Have a little mercy." Sure enough, Harry's eyes glazed over, and he licked his lips.
“No, you won't.” Malfoy stiffened, his tail bristling, and Harry clenched his fingers to stop himself from stroking it. “You’ll stay here until I’m sure you’re not up to anything else.”
He'd run through a thousand terrible scenarios by the time Harry appeared in the doorway. "Hey," he whispered, trying not to wake Julian. "Let's go outside."
Every time, Harry pulled out, the slow drag of the shaft of his prick against Draco’s rim caused Draco to twitch and shake. Every time Harry buried himself as deep as he could, Draco cried out. Where before it had seemed like a race, now Draco could imagine being nowhere else, and would have been quite happy to be fucked slowly for the rest of eternity. He could not, in fact, determine how much time had passed; with no windows, the room was isolated from the outside world.
“So do you!”
“And feel free to request a shared room.” Minerva watched the two of them go, and finally allowed herself a fond smile.
“You have me,” Draco assured him. “You can have me anywhere you like.”
“Do you want a shirt?” Harry rifles through the clothing racks, tongue poking out as he concentrates. Draco thinks he looks unbearably adorable. “Here.” He hands Draco a plain white t shirt from the section behind them. “And I don’t know your shoe size, but trainers would be good.” Unfortunately, when they look in the shoe section, there are none to be found. There is a pair of black boots that Harry immediately wants to try on.
Draco’s favourite part of sex has always been the orgasm — not because of the climax, but because of the intimacy of coming in someone. He almost always tops, seeking that moment when his partner is full of him in every way. It’s possessive, but it’s also a fleeting moment of closeness in his otherwise lonely world. And he can’t get any closer to Potter than he is now.
“So,” Potter said.
With a steadying breath, Harry raised his hand and cast
Harry exhaled, unaware he had been holding his breath. “He’s so confusing,” he muttered to himself, flopping down on the bed. His muscles were aching, and it really was quite comfortable.
Harry's brow furrowed. "You don't have to thank me, Draco. You don't owe me... this."
" he reiterated, pointing to the verdant dragon, and then to his own shirt, which was a pale moss colour. "Green."
"That's because you didn't think about other people. But being rich doesn't have to make you selfish. I've got loads of money."
It’s empty.
“Draco! Are you OK?”
“I forgot what a smug bastard you could be, Malfoy,” Potter said, but there was a smile tugging at his lips.
"Well, I always said I would." Trepidation flashed across his face.
By this point, he was used to a variety of sounds in Grimmauld Place. Old houses tended to settle, whether Muggle or Wizard, and enchanted objects rarely stayed still. Not to mention Kreacher, who wasn’t nearly as spry as he used to be, often went banging down the stairs. But Kreacher would rather die before he broke something in the House of Black, and this had been the distinct sound of something shattering.
A spinning top from the Wheezes children's line caught Draco's attention. "This top is green," he said, reaching for it. "A particularly garish shade of it, in fact. Here, green.
In the blink of an eye, they were softly opening their mouths against each other, inviting tongues to join, then just a bit of teeth on a plump lower lip—
So Draco knew about the Hall of Prophecy. He knew about the cold room with a fluttering veil that lead to death.
That was the wrong - or perhaps right - thing to say, because Harry made a frustrated noise and lunged at Draco, who flinched, braced for some sort of violence. Instead, Harry kissed him desperately, unmindful of his teeth, and squeezed the wrist that was trapped until Draco knew there'd be a bruise. He returned the kiss just as savagely, sucking Harry's bottom lip into his mouth.
Craik Forest was just over the Scottish side of the border, but no one here had an accent. Draco couldn't help but wonder where the family had come from - were they Pure-blood? Half-blood? Certainly they weren't Muggleborns, to own such vast acreage of magical land. Lacey had never given him her surname, and "Craik Farm" was uninformative, as well as supremely unimaginative.
“It’s gone so much faster than I expected,” Potter said, seemingly forlorn.
"I don't have a wand," Draco interrupted. The nurse raised an eyebrow.
, he told himself.
"So sorry he's such a burden to you," he voiced.
what you conclude?"
“Walk?!” he tried to exclaim, but Harry was already holding him by the arm and pulling them away. They appeared with a
Draco briefly mourned the fact that he couldn’t get to Potter’s balls, not with his trousers still open only just enough to expose his prick. He had enough to occupy him for the moment, though, both stroking the spit-slick shaft with his right hand and bobbing his head up and down. He thought of taking himself in hand, but he wasn’t particularly ambidextrous, and this moment was all about Potter.
Harry pulled back with a cheeky smile. "I want to ride you."
Abruptly, he turned to Draco and thrust the book into his hands. "You should keep this." Draco nodded dumbly as he accepted the book and tucked it under his arm. Lucius returned to his table of scattered paper.
“Still?” Malfoy’s trial seemed like a distant memory to Harry. He’d been exhausted and depressed in the aftermath of the war, and only testified because he’d been requested to do so by Malfoy’s solicitor. He did remember how quiet Malfoy had been when he appeared before the Wizengamot, to everyone’s surprise pleading guilty. His soft grey eyes had widened when he heard the sentence of probation, but that had been his only expression aside from a nod and muted “thank you” in Harry’s direction before he was led away.
those photos!” Harry seethed. “I don’t date anyone for long because it all goes tits up as soon as that starts! I’d
Draco had not yet taken Julian to see the portrait of Lucius and Narcissa that hung in the drawing room. Aside from the fact he was too young to understand, Draco didn't think he could bear it himself.
“Did you ever see any of whatever creature she was looking for?” Draco asked while glancing around nervously. Harry laughed to himself, recalling for a brief moment Draco’s fear in the Forbidden Forest when they were children.
"Our mother gave up everything for you to be here, so make her proud. She loved you.
Harry grinned. "Seeker's games!"
dared, poking into Potter’s life with a fine-tooth comb. No matter how strong the obnoxious little voice in his head was—he called it his inner Pansy—there was no good that could come from getting mixed up in Potter’s drama. He’d taken a calculated risk by accepting this job, and he didn’t regret it yet, but it was prudent to keep their relationship strictly professional. Draco didn't need a reminder of what obsessing over Potter’s every move had brought him, once. Sleepless nights and days of coming in second-best.
“I’ll have to kick you in the head if you don’t let go when I ask,” he warns.
"They only have one," Draco said, the lie bitter on his tongue.
Yet he could recall his father kneeling before Voldemort, "My apologies, my Lord" spilling from his faithless lips.
That was a loaded question. “I couldn't bring myself to.”
"Yes, that." She smiled wryly. "And
With Julian in his life again, the weeks now began to fly past as summer farm work began for Draco. Sometimes Harry was in a decent mood when they met; other times he barely said a word. Draco began to piece things together: when he arrived from a weekend at the Weasleys, he was short-tempered, and usually departed to Grimmauld. When he arrived from time at the Black house, he was talkative, but troubled, and generally went back to the Weasleys.
Not just punching you or hexing you." Harry appeared truly disturbed. "Once when you said something awful to me, I wanted to
"Me?"
“Hmm.”
"But it does make culture, make heritage. And I'm still part of that, you wretch." His voice broke, and Harry stepped towards him, hands out placatingly, obviously feeling sorry he'd said such a thing.
It would have been odd to have you administer the exam to me last week.”
But what if it was cut, like Parvati’s? That didn’t mean it was Malfoy at the other end. The two of them as soulmates — that was crazy. But there had to be
Harry's eyes were wet. "Because I need you here with me."
They met at the door as Harry pulled his trainers back on. “I’m glad it was nice for you, the party I mean, it’s nice to have friends — I mean, if you want to be friends with
“How exactly do you sense magic, anyway? I couldn’t tell there had ever been a spell on it at all, not even with
Dimly, he heard the clinking of glass as the Unspeakables cleaned up the ritual. He could only really focus on the hardness of the floor and the heaviness he felt. Eventually one of the guards came and pulled him gently to his feet.
“It’s OK, you know? People snog in parks. I bet she’s just jealous.” Draco nodded, but was obviously discomfited.
“And we broke it.” Harry slumped in his seat. “Just another thing ruined by the war.”
Jumping down from the ladder, he placed the shears back in their case. "You must have a lot of help, then." He picked up a bucket of fertiliser and mulch. It was heavy, but Draco had built muscle over the past year; his arms strained as he lifted it, biceps twitching under his long-sleeved work shirt. He didn't miss Potter's glance.
“Will what hurt?”
The chicken and potatoes were a hit with the gathered guests just as the starters had been. As he carved the large bird—it was closer to a turkey, and Draco wondered if it had been hit with an
In deference to the Muggle park, Malfoy had eschewed robes, but he was still overdressed for the weather in dark grey trousers and a crisply pressed black shirt. Interestingly, his hair was growing out, and he nervously pushed a lock of it behind one ear as he sat on the far end of the bench that Harry had chosen.
“He may have died before the door shut, yes. But the Stone may have simply worked because his death is one ongoing possible state. Either way, perhaps there’s still a way to use that connection.”
A hand gently but firmly clasped around his wrist; dazed,he allowed himself to be led to a small lounge and settled in a chair by himself. As the situation caught up to him, he began to shake.
But if Harry loves Draco, and
“And in return, you asked everything of me.” Draco’s chin is tipped up proudly, but there’s a tremble in his voice. It’s rare for him to show such vulnerability, and if Harry is smart, he’ll take this opening to try and soothe Draco’s bruised feelings, tell him things can be better if they’d only
“It surprised me to hear that you were doing paperwork,” Malfoy admitted. “You never seemed like a diligent student. But I suppose you had other things on your mind back at school.”
of all places. He’s looking… well, better than the last time Harry saw him, at a Wizengamot hearing where he’d been given a year’s house arrest.
His mother's silence disquieted him, and he tried to fill the empty space. "You know I'll be here for you when you get out. You won't be much past 60." She remained mute, and he continued cautiously. "I'll take good care of them. The baby, I mean. I don't really know anything about children, but it can't be that hard, can it? If the Manor is held in trust I'll still have access to the elves, right?"
“And now they have,” Harry laughed. “Apologies to whoever built it. Luna’s going to be pleased, though. I can’t wait to tell her.” He tapped his foot on the floor. “Didn’t you say this stuff was useful in potions? Why don’t you take some?”
A crash from the corner startled them all. Julian, ever perceptive, had picked up on the tension in the room; his tower of blocks came tumbling down as he pushed it over in frustration.
"Hey." Harry appeared in the doorway, and Draco didn't get to hear the rest of Granger's question as she brushed past him.
“Let me guess,” Draco asks, aiming the dagger at the man, whose eyes are black as well. “You’re Brookfield.”
"At least it seems like you enjoy your job?"
over him made him feel very strange, almost lightheaded, and he didn't want to examine that.
"Little ears," she said off-handedly. "So even though you-"
Finally allowed to Apparate once more, Draco leaves the Manor for London and immediately gets lost.
The contents of the chamberpot were meant to be vanished with
Harry stifles a laugh. “Your robes are tight. I’m looking, too. Everyone is looking, if they have any taste.”
“Parvati?”
"Right." There was an edge of doubt in Harry's voice that nagged at Draco, but he ignored it.
I invited you. Here, it’s hot out, thought you might like a cold drink.” He produced two bottles of Fanta that he’d picked up at a corner shop and surreptitiously placed under a Cooling Charm.
“I haven’t yet had the pleasure. Gilda Rathcourt, Games and Sports.” She holds out her hand, and Draco shakes it.
Draco couldn’t help but admire Potter for his honesty. “Yes, and now that you’ve been forced to admit just how much you like it, I thought I’d give you an out.”
“Accidental
sat on the end table; it was meant for a child of two or three, but reading it aloud gave Draco just as much comfort as Julian - recalling one of his only kind memories of their father. Rather than set Julian down in his cot or playpen, he sat on the settee and tucked Julian into the crook of his arm beside him.
The conversation lapsed, and Draco suddenly realised they had drifted past Byehass Fell and toward the A7.
“And that’s not OK. But I think Malfoy probably has less people he can trust in his life than you do. He’s scared of being vulnerable.”
“Students!” she spoke through a
"I'm not moping. I'm having a lie-in."
He hoped the walls were built better than the stairs.
Mercifully, she lowered the volume of her voice. “Finally! How’s it going, then?”
"Potter - Harry, look, I didn't mean that -"
“Out of London? Why? Were you born here?”
"Har," Julian whimpered as his tears finally ceased.
"Because the public would be terrified such a ritual exists. And the fact it can be used..." Draco cried out in despair. "What if it's been used and destroyed?"
under the headline
Before Harry could get a word out, the pile of parchment seemed to explode outwards, scattering papers across the room. Malfoy didn’t budge, but Harry, already on edge, jumped about a foot in the air as a large reddish-coloured cat ran past his legs and into the hall.
The man who answered the door recognised Harry. “Hullo sir! Came back during a nicer season as I recommended, eh? And with a friend?”
Now Harry thought he understood. Malfoy appreciated a challenge, but nothing too high stakes — his younger days had been filled with life or death decisions, after all.
no one else, they belong to no one but themselves, are beholden to no language but that of their deeds.
With great hesitation, Draco approached the door with the flowers carved on it. This was the first hurdle: it hadn’t opened until he and Potter had both touched it. This time it was more forgiving, and creaked open under Draco’s touch. He began his diagnostic spells on the entrance.
"It surprises me." Draco had enjoyed kissing Pansy. He'd enjoyed feeling her up through her shirt. And one hazy night in Seventh year, drunk on smuggled alcohol and trying to forget everything that was happening in his home, he'd mostly enjoyed a blow job from Lisa Turpin, who was avoiding her problems in a similar fashion. He'd never so much as looked in another boy's direction.
“It's 11 am!!”
He makes it up both sides of the Danube, past churches and bathhouses, and ends up where he started. He peeks in the bedroom: Potter is sprawled across the bed, wearing only pants. His arse is round, and Draco has a notion to smack it.
She placed her own hand where Draco's had been. "It's true that most children take time to display their magic, but the nature of this spell brings it forth immediately if it is there."
“I’m sorry. What?” Harry shook his head to clear it. “Parvati, I spoke with his ghost.”
"I assumed. It had been some time since I came this way, though, so I never made the acquaintance of either of them. You mother was a Black, yes?"
"It's not
There it was again. "You call him
"Welcome to the 'Golden Age,'" Harry answered sarcastically. "That's what the
"You weren't much of a Death Eater to begin with."
“I know. But tell them anyway.”
Harry had asked himself this very question. “When things are simply buried, and the owners are long gone, International Magical Law considers them up for grabs. It’s looser than Muggle law, actually. Wizards have a penchant for hiding magical objects in all sorts of places. It’s Muggles that mostly just bury things in graves.”
Draco broke down as soon as she left. "Mother," he cried, no longer caring about appearances. "What is going to become of us?"
“Yeah, ‘centre of power’ doesn’t really have the same ring to it as Excalibur.” It suddenly dawned on Harry where he’d heard the phrase. “You!” He pointed at Draco. “You knew what it said! Before we visited!”
“Everything will be fine.” Harry glanced over at Parvati, who was drawing complicated shapes in the air. “Your mum is going to be so happy to see you, yeah?”
"Poison. Self-administered, most likely. They say she fell in love with her sister's husband."
“Tell me
not!" he rushed out.
“I suppose you’ve come for your sword, then. It’s in here.”
“So am I!”
Leaning casually against the corner of the bookshelf was Draco Malfoy, a teasing smirk on his face.
“I think you’re an idiot,” she repeated bluntly. “That boy is obviously skittish, and you jumped right into bed with him.”
“Me too, mate.”
“I’d love your recipe, Harry,” said Luna, who seemed to cut her cake in a spiral, rather than straight across.
“Are you really going to sit on my stoop until I answer?” came Draco’s annoyed voice. Harry scrambled to his feet.
“You sound like Neville,” Harry laughed.
“I didn’t feel like being sent out against people anymore,” Harry said quietly. “I’m good at solving puzzles, and I’m good in a fight, but this way it’s just me versus whatever crypt or cave or ruin with a rumour around it.” He didn’t bring up the impact that Dark artefacts had on his life, on his desire to see them destroyed or otherwise neutralised.
"I know it's unpleasant. But tell me what happened, in as much detail as you can."
The October air was crisp, and wind shook the apple trees as Draco and Harry sat on a bench beneath them. The late sunlight reflected off the stained glass windows of the chapel; no Malfoy had prayed in centuries, but Draco found himself wondering if it would do any good.
“Catch my breath. This is still completely surreal.” Harry could tell that Malfoy was attempting to be stoic as he stood on unsteady feet. “I just want to crawl into my own bed and sleep for a week. And after that… well, study for my NEWTS. I have a lot of catching up to do, and I don’t think my mother will let me leave her side for some time. So I’ll be on a sort of house arrest as well, which… let’s not pretend I don’t deserve it.” Malfoy looked away from Harry, out the window of the Hospital Wing where the late afternoon sun was shining brightly. “I need to make amends for some things,” he admitted.
“Haven’t heard from him in a while,” Harry said carefully. “Just wondered what he was up to these days.”
“I’d like to read the paper, if you publish.”
“It won't matter, will it? It might just throw her off. I know I'm still in shock. I mean, it's Malfoy. We didn’t exactly get on.”
Over the next week and a half Harry second-guessed his invitation to Malfoy until it was the only thing on his mind. What had come over him? The Saturday of the game he found himself reading
“You’re frightened of her,” Harry pointed out with amusement.
Harry didn't even have the grace to look sorry. "Were you afraid I'd find out, then? Is that why you don't want to come live with me?"
Parvati slid her gaze suspiciously over Harry. “You weren't a prefect.”
"I was very, very lonely before. I never want to feel that way again."
Malfoy scoffed. “It’s true,” Harry insisted. “You were set on a path just like I was.”
"Fuck, the way you move, Draco. The way you take it, my god." The drawn out fucking finally caught up to Harry, and he thrust wildly as he started coming, moaning all the while how sexy Draco was and how well he took a cock.
They regarded each other warily. “That’s it, then?” Potter asked at last. “Can you disable those spells?”
“Wow,” Potter breathed into the silence. “That is some bed.”
"Do you think he'll be polite, and not mention it?" Draco asked the oak. "Or will he throw it in my face? That's more likely. We were never able to hold our tongues around one another." He finished pruning that one and moved to the next. "Perhaps you'll have better advice for me."
Draco tilted his head skeptically. “And invite who?”
it or something."
“Hmm. I think it was more like Cho being there that took your attention from me. Shame, my dress was spectacular.” Harry could tell she was only teasing.
"-meddling aunt. Just what I always wanted."
"It won't," Ms. Janney assured them. "It simply removes the ability to create magic, to cast spells. You're still a magical being, you'll be able to see through Muggle-repelling wards and use objects like a Portkey. You won't be able to use a wand again, of course."
Draco leaned back against the sink. He tried to keep hostility out of his voice, but it was harder to do with his posture. "And that's why you never sought me out. You assumed I knew about Julian and was just
"You were also a child. The sentencing committee has quite a bit of leeway, but not enough to send a minor to Azkaban."
“Nngh!” Harry had half a mind to make Draco beg, but didn’t think he could hold out that long. His ears were flat against his head and he panted, thrusting up into Harry’s hand as he unbuttoned Draco’s trousers and got his first good look at his cock. It was bigger than he expected from such a slender creature. “Up,” he commanded; Draco lifted his hips and allowed Harry to pull off both his trousers and pants, his tail emerging and almost swiping Harry in the face. Harry took it and rubbed it against his cheek as he stroked Draco off. It didn’t take very long, although Draco looked anywhere but directly at Harry until his climax hit, when he closed his eyes.
Lovegood seemed oblivious to the implication, pointing out a large bubble in one of her ice cubes to Rolf (whose last name Draco was not yet privy to). Pansy was smirking, the wretch, and it seemed contagious as Blaise joined in. Weasley’s ears went red, and Granger looked thoughtful. No one spoke.
"He's really sensitive." Potter reached over to give Julian a pat on the head, completely ignoring Draco's personal space. "Even if you keep your voice down, he gets upset when people argue."
" Draco blurted out. Harry turned back to him incredulously. "Because you go, all the time, and I know you have better things out there, better people than me, people that deserve you."
“That doesn’t make it less of a lie.”
Harry smiled to himself. He’d spotted the little journal at Flourish and Botts, and thought it might be perfect for Malfoy to take notes in while studying. He suspected that Malfoy had suggested the ‘no-gifts’ rule because his family vaults had been well-depleted by reparations and he was low on funds, but Harry had more money than he knew what to do with, and expected nothing in return.
"But... why? He hates me. He wouldn't have cared if I'd been Kissed." A small part of Draco didn't actually believe that to be true. He recalled Potter's hand gripping his own sweaty one, pulling him to safety in the Room of Requirement, his body solid as Draco held on for dear life, barely aware of his own screaming. He could still feel the heat of the fire if he let his thoughts go back there.
Brunch, according to Pansy, was the most important meal of the day. Draco disagreed, preferring a late supper, while Blaise was neutral—put a mimosa in front of the man, and he was happy enough. But Pansy was the one who'd been brave enough to venture into Muggle London and find establishments that were still willing to serve them, so Pansy made the schedule.
“Of course not.” Draco reached over and tucked Harry into the crook of his arm. “Perhaps under the real roses in the garden someday.”
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco groans, settling between Harry’s legs. “You kill me. How can I… after all this…” Whatever he’s trying to say is lost as he moves down and yanks Harry’s trousers off the rest of the way, getting caught up on his shoes. “Bloody Muggle kit,” Draco scowls, as if he doesn’t often wear suits himself. Finally he succeeds, throwing Harry’s shoes aside, and starts on his own clothing.
"When I first came here, it seemed so quiet. Our home was less sprawling, and I grew up with two sisters. My cousins were also around often when they were children and there was usually some sort of noise. It was frequently an argument, but it was activity nonetheless."
"I can't cast those. And I don't have a wand, regardless."
They stood silently for a beat, and then Harry blurted out, “Does it hurt?”
“Once again, it’s all about you,” Draco sneers.
Draco bristled.
“Thank you, Uncl- Professor Potter.”
Harry was the first to recover, and he pulled Draco’s trembling body against his, picking him up and moving them to the bed. A bit of come dripped down his thighs, and Harry swiped it up with a finger and held it to his mouth. “Finish your cream.”
"Yeah. Well. Anyway, she never really let it drop. Even when we tried to make a go of it. And then when I took in Julian..."
"Yeah. Strange." Another pause. "I'm glad we're all here together."
“But it
He’s nervous: Harry has never gone out with the main intention of pulling before. There’s also something exciting about it and the anticipation has him keyed up. But while Harry’s worn jeans and trainers might be fine for an aging local pub, he thinks he’ll need something a little better if he’s going to be successful.
“I have his wand,” Harry offered. “Maybe I could…”
Another of the plain wands was waved over him to induce an odd tugging sensation. His breath returned to him, and he attempted to stand, still sputtering. All pretence of his actions being voluntary was dropped as the wizard grabbed him by the chin and poured the final potion down his throat.
"'Tis only me." A woman in pearls and a lace-collared dress waved out from a portrait, and Draco approached.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “What, so you’re just calmly,” he waved his hand in the air, “walking to your execution?”
“Fifty points to Slytherin.”
True, Draco didn’t have the friends or support system Harry had. “Why don't you live at the Manor anymore?” Harry finally asked him.
“I’m aware,” Harry bites out. “Although I meant because she's a woman.” There’s a silence, and Harry looks back to see Draco staring in disbelief. “What?”
The elf appeared next to him. "Do you remember where I hid the wand in the library?" She gave him a hard stare. "Master Draco instructed Holkey to never speak of that."
“Besides illegal potion brewing, breaking and entering, and failure to register as an Animagus? You’re right, nothing at all.”
“He’s not bad-looking,” Draco said hesitantly. Pansy raised a sceptical brow, and he caved. “All right, yes, he’s fit. I’m not
In response, Draco nipped Harry on the ear, a bit sharper than necessary. “Five points from Slytherin,” Harry gasped, enjoying the slight pain even as he admonished his lover.
Malfoy blinked, but let Harry’s remark slide. “Moving on is easier said than done. I say I should make amends, but I don’t know where to start. I’m hiding like a coward.”
“I’m glad we were both wrong,” Harry offered. “That we’re alive.”
, I'm attracted to you, that's obvious from what we — and that night we — er, yeah.” He noticed Draco’s mouth twitch into an involuntary smile, amused at Harry’s stammering. “But from the first time I came over here… I dunno, you're still
“Wow,” Harry breathed, reaching for the sword. He could sense a swirl of magic around the blade — nothing malicious, but powerful all the same, twisting through the steel. “Merlin, do you feel that?”
“Morning already?”
“And if you don’t want to be seen with me, I understand, but —”
They mostly worked in silence, which was fine with Draco, as long-lasting spells took concentration and time to cast. Still, he couldn’t resist watching Potter from the corner of his eye and wonder what he was thinking.
. The knocker seemed handmade, a collection of mismatched ceramic flowers, but was sturdy enough when Harry used it. After a moment the door swung open but no one stood behind it.
“So good for me,” Harry breathed as he fit the head of his cock into Draco’s clutching hole. “Soooo good.” He sank in slowly in one smooth thrust, groaning at how amazing it felt. Fuck, he was going to do this every night from now on.
"So why am
"I hate to call in a favour, but I've done a lot for you, reuniting you with Julian. Please, Draco, help me out here. Help me with Julian, help me navigate that house."
Jack appeared extremely nervous, which confused Draco. "What could you be afraid of?"
"And then my magic was vulnerable enough they could steal it," he finished for her. "Merlin, that's so clever I'm almost impressed."
"Not a stake? I thought…"
“Yes.” Harry rolled his eyes. “You’ve asked me five times a day. It’s alright that you invited them.”
“No the first thing I
Two furniture stores and one pet boutique later, he finally stumbles into a shop that sells clothing. It’s a bit cluttered and does nothing to dissuade him from the notion that Muggle culture doesn’t progress much. The racks are full of plain jackets and shirts, boring as can be, and doubt creeps over him. Then, from the corner of his eye, he spots it:
“Will it help?” she questioned, not unkindly. “Knowing for sure?”
Draco scrambled backward, hands raised in a placating manner. "I don't have my wand on me."
"Perhaps they were, and have always been good at hiding it." Hermione picked her quill back up. "In any case, we need you for this next part."
“I wanted the wardrobe on the other side of the room,” Draco complained. “Now I have to move it myself. It looks dreadfully heavy.”
The nameless witch left, and they were alone in the chamber. Draco strained to hear the faintest rustle from the invisibility cloak - he really needed to get the story behind that thing from Harry - but Auror training had apparently paid off, and Ron was silent as a mouse.
, but he nodded and held out his hand, only half-sure the man would take it. After he considered Draco, he did, and shook it firmly.
"Truthfully, it's all a bit frightening. I was alone for a long time, then I only had you and Julian for company. I'm not sure how fast I want to take this." Draco imagined people spitting on him, hexing him, demanding to see the Dark Mark as Jack once had. And it wasn't only the actions of others that concerned him.
“Well, I am too.”
"More like hilarious." Weasley rolled his eyes dismissively.
He waited - one breath, two breaths - and then did something he hadn't done since he was 4 years old, seeking refuge from a nightmare: he opened his parent's door without waiting to be summoned.
He decided to be merciful and take Malfoy some lunch. The other man ate in sullen silence, but he finished every bit of the sandwich. “So,” he asked cautiously after he’d licked his fingers clean, “what exactly is it you are ‘investigating’ about me? I’ve kept my head down.”
dripping with barely concealed innuendo. Harry wants to argue that it isn’t like that, isn’t just physical, that he loves Draco, but his body is leaning into the press of Draco’s own, his lips tilting up towards that beautiful mouth.
really
“Er…” Blaise and Daphne had showed up with dates; Astoria had not.
“As well as can be expected. The Eastern European countries were stubborn about checkpoints, but that’s because they know we’d catch illegal dragon bone shipments if we crack down.” Draco smiles, and adds, “Charlie Weasley and some of his colleagues actually spoke during the talks about how the regulations were necessary for their work. It was very helpful.”
you accept?"
“That’s not what I meant.” Potter approached him cautiously, then gestured to the chaise. “Can we sit down?” He sat down himself without waiting for Draco to agree, then looked up expectantly.
“I’ll help.”
“The way you plan to kill me.”
The place is one Draco suggested, and that Harry readily agreed to. It's a Muggle cafe, and the patio isn't busy between the morning rush and lunch. They’ve been here before, together and apart.
Andromeda’s voice rang out across the garden, as Teddy barrelled full tilt over the grass, zooming his new figure of the Magpie’s star seeker up and down with his hands.
Harry sat up and stretched. "I'm waiting on an owl. Should be here by noon. Can there be biscuits with tea?"
Muggle pub? Pull the other one, Malfoy.”
Just then, Malfoy caught his eye and froze. Harry scuffed his foot on the floor, unsure if he should approach. Of course things were going to be awkward. For Malfoy, the war had ended abruptly only a day ago. Gathering his courage, Harry strode down the aisle of beds and spoke into the silence.
"She knew she was going to die." Draco was unsure how to take that information. Yet another burden for Julian to bear when he was older. Harry ran a soothing hand down Draco's arm.
“What’s wrong,” Draco murmured, trying not to buck up again.
But how?
“Hey, Malfoy. You look like you've seen a ghost.”
They travel up and down the tourist streets, smiling at Muggle backpackers falling out of the ruin pubs, happily drunk on pálinka. They pause outside the basilica, closed for the night. Harry twitches, and Draco wonders if he knows the old superstitions about vampires and churches are just that. They eventually make their way down to the Danube and watch the boats drift by.
"I'll cast a shield charm." Harry was already pulling his clothes off and Draco found himself hardening as each inch of skin was exposed.
"I'm always busy, Potter. I'm in demand." Malfoy's face was smug, although it didn't make him ugly the way it did some men. "The level of my work is low enough that I may entertain whatever strange request you likely have for me, but make no mistake, I
“The garden needs a lot of care before it can bloom properly again. Being left unwarded in the salt air nearly killed the whole lot.”
"What," he hissed, "do you know about Julian?"
“Distraction?” Draco replied, hurt.
It’s a strange sensation, warm cock against cold, but each of them finds it both novel and pleasing. They tear off the rest of their clothes, desperate for more contact. Harry sneaks one hand between them, taking hold of both their pricks and wanking them in smooth, sure strokes. He seems more skilled at this than the blow job, and Draco has no qualms about telling him so.
“Our?”
“Parkinson, see me after class.”
Letting the now empty bottle fall to the ground, Malfoy wrapped his arms around himself. “It feels like I shouldn’t be here.”
“Right.”
"It does," he admitted. "But the lengths we have gone to in order to perpetuate our lines... those bother me, too. I believe in our traditions, I do, but there's been so much pain and death."
“I already told you, I’m not here to take your life.” Draco takes from the world every day of his existence. He’s always taken; as a rich spoiled child, as a Death Eater, as a hunter. Now he can give something to someone, and finds he likes the idea.
Draco let out the breath he was holding. “Alright.” He looked over his shoulder at the Floo in the parlour, his heart racing. He needed to be anywhere else. “Why don’t you try your own hand at the climate spells. “I’ll be back to check your work.”
Harry shook his head. "She didn't used to be like this, but after everything, and losing Fred, she's just so
Pansy made a slight noise of distress as Blaise eagerly reached for the coffee. “Great idea, Scamander,” he said, pouring a large portion into his cup, a gleam in his eye. It took Draco a moment to figure out that his friend was referring to Rolf. He was a Scamander? That made sense; no wonder he and Luna had hit it off. He seemed like an alright sort, Draco supposed.
"I've got to get out of there. I love Molly, I do, but she can tell me and Ginny are always on the edge of a fight, and everyone else has loads of work to do, so they aren't around. And I
“Do you have one? A portrait.” Harry imagined a snooty little Malfoy, berating passerby from a tapestry.
“Ghosts also have a Headless Hunt,” Harry said nonsensically, and Malfoy burst out in startled laughter.
"Just do it, Potter. It's only a tattoo." It's not, they both know it, but Potter's need wins out, and he tentatively takes Draco's arm, one hand on his elbow and another beneath his palm. Their fingers interlace, a parody of romance, before Potter's fangs descend and he rends Draco's flesh once more.
“So are you. Or you will be.” Harry presses him down onto the bed. Draco allows himself to be pinned briefly before flipping them over.
“It says…
“It wasn’t very strong,” Harry explained. “Just like the sword was pulsing with a low energy.”
"I thought you didn't have one?"
“You want to ride me?” Draco asked, scarcely believing his luck. Harry nodded shyly. “I can’t reach my wand, so you’ll have to do the spell,” Draco told him. He probably could reach his wand if he stretched, but he enjoyed watching Harry’s wandless magic.
Draco snags a bite with his own fork. “Speaking in the past tense?”
“You think so? Really?” Harry asked hesitantly. “You can’t tell from just tonight, can you?”
He looked up at Harry expectantly. "No change," Harry said regretfully. "It's still just kind of swirling around in there."
He glanced over at his mother, but there had been no change. "Give me a moment to take care of this."
"Only once?" Draco asked faintly.
“Is that so terrible?” he asked Harry. “I know we meant to take it slowly, see how things go, but I also know how I feel about you.”
That word again.
He nodded and turned back to his father. Kneeling, he checked Lucius' pulse just to be sure, but it was clear that there was nothing to be done. A long cut ran along the inside of his forearm and his nightshirt was covered in spots of tacky blood. Draco carefully brushed Lucius' hair from his face and arranged it around his shoulders. It felt just like his own, sliding smoothly between his fingers. Unbidden, a memory arose of watching Lucius brushing it back into a ribbon when Draco was five or six.
Their hands were separated by only a hair's breadth; he felt Draco’s fingertips twitch as if he wanted to take Harry’s hand in his own. Instead he tilted his head just a fraction in Harry’s direction. His mouth opened, maybe to protest, or to agree, but instead he said, “You’re a good friend, Harry.”
He doesn’t ask the burning question in his mind, but Draco answers anyway. “There hasn’t been anyone else for me, either.” There’s an edge of despair in his voice, and Harry believes him.
proud.”
“You don’t think she’d appreciate you trying new things?”
Finally he attended to the task he'd really come down for. He gathered a number of unobjectionable books - histories, novels, all his old Hogwarts textbooks - and placed them in a travelling case. The leather bag automatically shrunk any book that was placed inside. It required a charm to open and unshrink them, so they would be unavailable to Draco after today, but they weren't for reading. They were for selling.
" Draco would miss her, but Julian would never know her, and Draco wouldn't be there to tell him about her.
"I don't understand."
“They can’t hurt you,” Harry reassured him. “They’re dead.”
They certainly wouldn't raise him as a Malfoy.
Draco didn't understand it himself.
Harry grinned around a mouthful of croissant. "You're so vain."
“Hmm, that’s very private, Harry. He's left the Manor. I do have his actual address, if you’d like to stop by. He prefers not to receive owls.”
everything's fine."
“But you didn’t answer me before.”
“Hmm.”
He doesn’t know he’s already dead.
“Holy shit.”
Draco could scarcely believe it himself.
won’t be happening — not ever.
Slowly, Draco let sleep take him over as well, lulled to sleep by the sea breeze blowing in the window, bringing with it the scent of roses.
immediately; as much as they all disliked the staff, it was still the flagship paper of wizarding Britain. With their connections to the Ministry, it was only logical that the two of them break the story of the Unspeakables colluding with key members of the Wizengamot to consolidate power and ignore legal procedures. Harry would wait until reporters came clamouring for his opinion, and give the impression he was bowing to their demands for his attention, which would put them in a good mood.
In fact, as Malfoy had disappeared on May 2nd, and returned in the first week of July, he had missed his birthday of June 5th entirely. Short of moving his birthday forward, however, there wasn't much to be done to reconcile his true chronological age. (Harry had mentioned this to Parvati, who laughed and said, “Malfoy as a Leo? Ha! Can you imagine?” Harry could not imagine. He didn't even know what that meant, even being a Leo himself.)
After lunch they continued in companionable silence, only occasionally remarking on some aspect of the scenery. As they drew closer to the site, Harry started to feel uneasy.
Harry turned completely red. "Not you, you git."
As soon as he’s no longer in danger of bleeding out, Harry leans up to mouth damply at his cock through the fabric of his pants, before pulling them down abruptly. Draco’s cock bounces out, nearly smacking Harry in the face. Absurdly, Draco doesn’t think about the imminent blow job. He thinks about how gorgeous Harry looks without his glasses, unnecessary now that his vampire senses have sharpened his vision. He then fleetingly thinks about how grateful he is that Harry has control over his fangs, now retracted, as he closes his lips over the head of Draco’s cock.
He shows up with Hermione, stays by her side for a while, then drifts to the corner of the room when she spots a work colleague and gets so far into the minutiae of a current project that Harry can feel his eyes cross. He snags some canapes, then champagne, then more canapes and more champagne, politely compliments the artist on his work (although it rather looks like random blobs of colour) before he heads to the veranda with a third glass of champagne. Harry’s no lightweight, so three glasses of bubbly have only taken off a bit of his edge. He casts a
“You don’t think about them because they’re impossible. Well, I didn't think of us because that was as impossible to me as a tree full of treacle tarts. I was truly enjoying your company, and I got pleasure out of your strange awkward flirting, but how could I conceive of a day when Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy started snogging?”
“It’s not like antiques, Malfoy. Older usually just means out of style.” Draco visibly deflates, and Harry feels awful for hurting his feelings. If he’s in a Muggle clothing store, he’s obviously come a long way from his former stuck-up self. “But then it comes back in style! What were you looking at, the jacket?”
So. They were playing at happy families with someone else's child. How nice for them. Just lovely.
Draco chose not to respond, and simply waved to Julian as the Portkey swept them away.
“Just levitate it?” Harry offered, but Draco shook his head.
Time to go home.
“Quite the collection you’ve got here. I suppose the
"I'm serious." Harry bit his lip. "Is it too much? Am I too... I dunno. Intense?"
"For... burial. What should I do?" Draco was floundering; without his mother there was no one left to give him guidance. One occasionally sympathetic nurse wasn't quite the same.
"We aren't equals, Harry. What we have, it's... special in a way I never anticipated, but it can't last, even if we want it to."
"We shouldn't wait," Draco stated firmly.
“I don’t blame you either,” Potter reassured him, and Draco felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The temperamental arse that Potter used to be would have thrown this in Draco’s face. Potter bit his lip and continued, quieter now. “I didn’t like to think I wouldn’t see you again. I… I enjoy you being here. Can’t we just get over this?”
And then the next.
an only child then, if you didn't have the same issue?" He wasn't sure he wanted to hear the answer.
“You can’t put the Kneazle back in the bag, Harry. I already know how fantastic you are in bed, I doubt I can resist.”
each other?” Draco laughed incredulously. “Are you serious?” Harry crossed his arms and glared; Draco took a step back. “Merlin. You
“Ghosts think there is Heaven, at least,” Malfoy said, and Harry realised he’d asked the question aloud.
“You’re like an old village matchmaker, you know that?” Harry said, shaking his head with a smile. Just then, Draco entered the kitchen.
"You do know what you did was wrong though, right Malfoy?" The time Draco had used Weasley's first name obviously didn't make an impression. "Because I wonder sometimes."
is used in magical literature to imply the focal point of a spell.”
"Just seems like a sweet kind of day," Draco replied instead.
“Never mind. Look, I’m just gonna get this over with.” Jones pulled his wand out, and Draco thought he meant to open the door to the house. Instead, he pointed it at himself.
“You don’t think you’re grateful to have experienced the good things from your life?”
else?” Harry’s brain tried to run through a list of Draco’s old friends and got stuck at Goyle.
Harry was already planning ahead. “Do you think you can make it a few miles, back to the nearest town? I stayed overnight at an inn last time, since I had to walk in and out.”
. We have to be back this afternoon. The semi-finals are next month, in any case. Got to stay on point.” She gave Cho a wink. “You ever get sick of this tosser, come try out.”
Two days of delicate untangling of spells later, and Draco thought he had an answer, although explaining it to Potter was going to be uncomfortable. He was composing a carefully worded owl in the parlour when the Floo chimed, and Potter came practically tumbling out of the fireplace. They simply blinked at one another for a long moment before Potter spoke.
Harry caught Malfoy’s eye over his mother’s shoulder.
The sign on the rack says “vintage,” like the clothes are rarefied wine. The bright yellow piece that drew Draco’s eye is unfortunately attached to netting of some sort and he immediately discounts it. But on the other side of the rack is a denim jacket, just like he’d seen in the magazines, and he reaches through the rack without crossing to the other side.
“I’m a monster,” Potter says bluntly. “I’ve already fed from you, I’ll hurt someone else next.”
He addressed the next part to Luna, Granger and Weasley directly.
"It was always so hard to send you away." Her hand slowly strayed to her stomach. She wasn't beginning to show yet, of course, but Draco still found himself wondering at the fact there was a tiny person inside there.
Spring brought flower bouquets through the freight Floo. It also brought the return of Potter.
"McGonagall would never leave that school." Draco heard a tremor in the witches voice.
“I woke up unsure what to think!”
Harry burst out laughing. "Sacked? For one loss? You'd have been sacked from Slytherin ages ago if that were true."
"He didn't have much of a choice, did he?" Draco didn't mean to sound quite so bitter.
Overwhelmed, Harry arched up into kiss. It was warm and Draco’s lips were soft, and he nearly lost himself in the feeling. But through his still sleep—fogged brain and rising libido, he managed to pull back and ask, “What are you doing?”
“I’m going out.”
the one that decided we’re friends now, you know.”
Draco snorted, offended. “That’s none of your business.”
Though he was short on time, the gesture seemed immensely significant. Harry took Malfoy’s hand, ignoring Ron’s indignant snort, and shook it once.
"All alone? Where did Granger and Weasley go? And where are Crabbe and Goyle?"
"It has been the pressing question in my mind, yes, how a teenager gained custody of an unrelated child."
“And spoiled, and sneaky,” Harry pointed out. “And,” he grinned knowingly, “you didn’t want to register, did you? You had to be something small.”
Draco smiled as well, mirroring his little brother, and Potter cleared his throat awkwardly.
"-as if Julian cares about that, at his age."
I regret. Why would I want it to happen again, but in reverse? No, we should stay apart."
Draco followed Potter through the front door, making note of which Locking Charms were used. The entrance wasn’t particularly grand, more a medium-sized foyer. Being Irish, the Doherty family hadn’t been a part of his great-grandparent’s circles, but he still knew the name—they were pure-blood social climbers whose family name had died out around 50 years ago. This foyer would have been where guests were greeted by a house-elf and turned over their travelling cloaks.
Draco couldn't open his eyes, and yet he could see a grey mist.
“Potter,” he croaked. “You’d better explain what’s happening.”
"Can't say that I do. Folks down here are lying low these days. You might try the tavern on the corner. Angie's been having trouble keeping up ever since the Ministry declared unbound house-elves free."
"Two thirds tea, one third milk."
Two, it had never worked on her.
"Hmm." Draco reached down for the Firebolt he'd dropped. "Here. I think Seeker's games are out for the evening."
“And why not an Auror?” Malfoy asked quizzically. “You said it wasn’t a good fit?”
"And someone told tales." Draco leaned back and blew a lock of hair out of his eyes. "Fuck."
"I was afraid of that." the nurse shook her head. "Well, it won't give you the opportunity to save like the harvest would, but they also need people to help in the market on weekends. They bring apples down for autumn, trees down for Christmas. Lacey makes cakes and such through the winter months until spring, then it's flowers."
“Are you taking me to Azkaban?” he asked, resignation in his voice.
“Yes.”
Instead Harry blurted out, “You said knowing about death didn't make you appreciate life. Do you still feel that way?”
Harry shrugs. “Nah. Haven’t been any interesting cases. Pretty slow, actually.”
That made Harry frown. He had become used to having Malfoy back in his life — not that owls couldn’t be sent across the Channel, but it seemed so far away. He realised with a start that he’d been expecting to see Malfoy in person eventually, now that they were civil. Harry felt a slight tug of
“Wish me luck, then!”
"He doesn't want to choose between his sister and his best friend," Draco offered, treading lightly.
“Yes, your ability to be a complete boor continues to astound me.” Malfoy waved in the direction of the door. “And now you’ve overstayed your welcome, so toddle on back to whatever deadly task awaits you this evening. Pulling teeth from a dragon or some such, I’m sure.”
Soon he began to drift off, slipping lower in the water. Bubbles floated up and tickled his nose and Draco sneezed.
He wasn’t sure what he liked better: the taste or the delirious noises his actions elicited from Draco.
Draco raised a brow. “No treacle?”
“The Resurrection Stone.”
"You're a problem for them. All of your Azkaban-worthy crimes - the
"Huh." Harry tried to picture it: Malfoy bent over a dusty book, blond hair falling into his face, tongue poked out like Hermione's when she was concentrating on a particularly challenging puzzle. His mental image made him blush hotly. “Don’t you know anyone else?”
“Harry couldn’t be friends with a bully, not like you used to be,” Weasley said bluntly. “But he’s been spending a lot of time with you. He says you’re different, so…” He shrugged. “Doesn’t mean it’s all water under the bridge, but it’s enough to give you a chance.”
hawthorn wand!" Draco's wand came flying out of the drawer and smacked into Harry's palm. He thrust it forward. "Take it!" he insisted. "Take it and fight me!"
interested in him, aren’t you?”
Bill frowned. “I didn’t feel anything. Do you think it’s a subtle curse?”
"He’d only need to disarm him," Hermione said, catching on to what Harry was thinking. “He probably won’t bother with that, though. To Voldemort, defeat means death. Disarming is effective, but not quite final enough.”
“Have I not been clear? Here, I’ll make it simple.” Harry reached over and took Draco’s hand; he trembled but didn’t pull away. “Let’s go out to dinner.”
at his window drew his attention.
with that. Goodness knows I’m the same.”
The fear inside him made him reckless, and Harry stopped on the path and thrust his hand out. “Let's start over, here at the end. Potter. Harry Potter. Thanks for walking with me.”
reporter dug them up and confronted you about it? Please tell me it wasn't Skeeter."
” Harry hisses, almost like Parseltongue. crawling up Draco’s body and lining his arse up with Draco’s near-painful erection.
They were definitely in each other’s personal space now, on the edge of fight or flight.
When the dust cleared, Harry was lying on top of Draco, who was facedown on the ground. He scrambled up, coughing.
“You’re certainly owed it, for as hard as you work,” Harry says kindly, but inside his mind is awash with the possibilities that Draco stayed for
"I told you, go to the Manor," Draco reasoned.
They were leaning towards each other as their voices raised. Draco caught himself and laughed. “Are we really yelling at each other about being friends? This is absurd.”
Draco answers, almost in a whisper. “Yes.” The word catches in his throat, and he speaks again, clearly this time.
The answer was staring him in the face Malfoy would take his NEWTS in June, just after his birthday. Harry could ask him out for a celebratory drink. Should he? Folding the letter carefully, Harry worried his lip, trying to determine if that was a good idea or not. When he looked up, he saw Hermione staring at him knowingly; he set the letter aside with a flush and got back to work.
"We aren't open yet!" Draco shouted, pretty much right in Potter's face. "Come back later!" He darted behind the stall, where the curtain covered the tiny back area with a stool and wood stove.
It looked just as it always did in his dreams, and nightmares. Cracked and small, deceptively simple for so powerful an artifact. Harry stared at it lying in his palm.
“I didn’t bring you here to go do battle with it! I just want to know what it says.”
“Oh, some sort of intangible one.” Hermione waved her hand in the air dismissively. “Supposedly a secret spell reveals it. Or death.”
Draco never had any illusions about his own paternal feelings. He'd always believed he'd have an heir, of course, but he didn't think children were particularly adorable or have a special yearning for them. This was different. He wasn't Julian's father. He was simply his blood. He looked into the pale blue eyes of his brother with fascination.
“Only your brother knows. I couldn’t open it myself, the curse was a bit advanced for me.” Harry shrugged his jacket on. “You can come see for yourself, if you like. Cho?”
"I don't think so," Octavia answered. "He won't understand who they are. Children have no concept of death at that age."
“I think we found why this place was protected.”
Harry's hand found its way over Draco’s own. Harry’s skin was cool where Draco’s was clammy, a balmy contrast. Draco wished there was a window so he could feel the sea air over his skin, which was tingling now, a million tiny pinpricks.
“Your body is becoming accustomed to the change.” Draco stands and begins to bandage his wrist, applying Dittany as he had with the other. He's lucky he carries potions for healing, given the dangerous nature of his job.
“This is supposed to be a friendly catch-up.”
“Yes, but… the Muggle park.”
“And I guess… we hurt each other, over the years.” Waving a hand, Potter cut off Draco’s objection. “I don’t want to get into a contest over who was worse. But it’s one thing to forgive you for myself. I can’t forgive you on behalf of Ron, or Hermione, or Luna, or Neville…” he trailed off, seemingly realising just how long the list of his mates that Draco had wronged over the years really was.
Harry’s talk with Dumbledore had been truly illuminating, but he could sense it drawing to a close.
Draco couldn’t contain a yelp of laughter. “Sorry, what?”
“I’m not! Believe me, I’m not.” Harry thought back to fifth year, to Malfoy smirking as he led Umbridge to the DA. “You’ve actively made some very bad choices. You want to talk about hate? I hated a lot of things about you, Malfoy.”
“My parents told me they loved me,” is Draco’s answer. He doesn’t elaborate, doesn’t try to give Harry some deep psychological explanation. Harry can parse that for himself. Love is no guarantee of trust or safety. Actions speak louder than words.
"What about witches like Hermione?" Harry persisted. "Her parents are Muggle. Should she never see them again?"
"Nah nah nah, hey Jules."
“I’m… I’m really glad we didn’t wait,” Harry finally said.
“Why cover it in fabric if you’re just going to step on it?”
"I'm very grateful he found me," Draco admitted as he stroked Julian's soft blond hair.
"Did you meet him?" Granger nodded at Julian, eyes piercing. "Before Harry took custody."
"Without your own inherent magic active, that ball is useless to you."
Malfoy! I was going to have a lie-in!”
And he owed it to Malfoy in particular, didn't he? Harry had failed him in the Room, then brought him out to the Forest and watched him shake in terror at the fact of his death. Even if they'd reached some understanding at the end, he knew that Malfoy would never have wanted Harry to witness his fear.
"But... not for what happened to you?"
If an owl could roll its eyes, Harry would have sworn that was exactly what it did. It made no more violent moves, though, so Harry opened the parchment after casting a number of detection spells revealed nothing malicious.
" Goyle muttered, but Malfoy, taken aback by Harry’s question, seemed to be thinking.
Draco pulled out a tenner and set it with the rest of the money. “That should cover it.’
"You could have just told me." Harry's gaze felt hot on Draco's bare chest.
“What are you doing?”
“Ah.”
He tried to recall what his own magic had felt like to him.
Afterwards, they stumbled out of the ensuite wrapped in plush bathrobes. Neither said a word as Draco opened the balcony doors to let out some of the humidity. The moonlight flooded in, and Draco turned to find Harry spread across his bed, eyes already closing.
“And yet he kissed you?” Parvati rolled her eyes. “Please, Harry, you’re just talking yourself in circles at this point. You like him, you’re attracted to him, he likes you back, he’s given you all the signals. Ask him out to dinner and kiss him proper at the end.”
It was too late to change his mind now. Even if he wanted to flee, they were blocking his only exit.
“That would be creepy,” Draco answers, even as he moves aside to make room in the bed. He still isn’t wearing trousers, but doesn’t really care.
“Arse.”
All those
His arms started to ache and he squirmed underneath Harry, trying to find a more comfortable position to enjoy the thorough pounding he was receiving. The intensity of anal sex had been a total surprise to Draco, who'd always assumed it was something that submissive men just put up with. Instead, it was often too much - too much pleasure, too much stimulation. Draco actually had trouble coming sometimes, held on the edge by the overwhelming feeling of fullness, but he did enjoy the ride.
Draco couldn’t help but agree. The air in the room had a soporific quality. “Maybe that’s why this room was hidden. A little escape within the house, from whatever crowds had descended on it for the summer. You can almost imagine the hostess climbing up the stairs and breathing a sigh of relief as the hubbub faded away.” He turned back to find Potter staring at him in fascination. “What?”
"I choose you."
The puddle of half-digested apples taunted him, and Draco knew he would have to fetch water from the well and clean it the Muggle way.
"Weren't you listening? You can't."
Draco was staying at an executive suite, not far from the cafe: more posh than most of the apartments where blokes took Harry home, and certainly better than his barely-furnished bedsit. Harry had walked there beside Draco, not saying much, but occasionally making sure their hands brushed.
Harry managed to get himself under control. “Do, um, do you want a shared room?”
"Hush. You know I mean this little man." Draco swept his brother up into his arms. "Would you like a tour of your home?"
“I think the spell here probably went along with the Anti-Apparition one. That one has already worn off, and this will soon, too.”
“I take it you aren’t Irish, Mr…?”
“Do you want to tell me why you didn’t want to participate in the boggart exercise, Violet?”
"It's nap time for you, little man."
but because you've seen it from the other side."
charm. “Those two are nearly an hour late.” She had put the announcement of the House Cup winners off until after dinner was served, as it wouldn’t be seemly for two Heads of House to be missing. Not that it was much of a surprise; everyone coming into the Great Hall had passed the hourglasses and saw that Ravenclaw sat in the lead. Their students had done very well for themselves at exam time and managed to end up ahead.
"I didn't mean me! Julian will never know her, it's so fucking unfair, and you want to pretend she didn't exist! But she-" Draco broke off on a sob.
“Oh.” He was right; Harry’s continued curiosity about Draco didn’t quite extend to his creepy house, or the possibility of an encounter with Narcissa. “Well, I could meet you here.”
Harry remembers being so thrilled about the prospect of waking up to Draco every single morning, of tripping over his stupid pointy shoes at the end of the bed every night, of being
"They're so much more than that. You never did a blood ritual when you inherited the Black house?"
Draco doesn’t have a simple answer for that. “You needed help,” he finally says quietly.
Down to his trousers, Harry pressed his now prominent erection against Draco’s hips, and felt an answering hardness. They rutted against each other, hands wandering everywhere, quickly getting carried away. Harry’s belt dug into his skin, and he pulled his trousers off, managing to barely break the kiss. They moved together as if they were fucking, and suddenly Harry wanted to very, very badly.
"I suppose you must be good with children."
Draco followed wearily. He wasn't looking forward to a night of Harry beating him to the Snitch, working out whatever foul mood he was in. It had been a long day in the orchard, yet Draco also didn't feel he could decline.
“You still see Longbottom around?”
"It was more than an excuse," Draco argued. "They burnt us at the stake."
” he complained, “and that would be weird!”
The candlelight flickered, casting shadows across Harry's naked chest and causing the soapy droplets that covered him to sparkle. Draco was unable to resist answering him in kind. "So are you," he admitted. "Harry, the way you feel, I..."
of course, never to Potter.) Same messy, almost black hair, same piercing glance. No matter how much fuss the papers made about the green, Draco didn’t think it was the colour of Potter’s eyes that made him seem so intense. It was unnerving, being fixed under that stare again after so many years.
"Get OUT!" Draco repeated with a shriek, throwing a teacup at Harry's face. It hit the door frame and exploded into tiny white pieces.
I mean after. When I had nothing to do but think. I was isolated and the weight of the past two years… I knew if I didn't keep moving, it would swallow me whole. So I threw myself into restoring the Manor and I never looked back. Otherwise, I would have laid awake every night regretting my very existence.”
"It's always about
Potter was standing with the girl Weasel. Unsurprising. What
Finally he came skulking back to the hospital, tail between his legs. Narcissa had arched one still-perfect eyebrow, but hadn't taken him to task for his earlier behaviour. She also didn't mention the lack of small gifts, and instead they talked about the novel she'd finished.
Harry to desire him. To desire Draco for simply for being
Harry’s eyes widened, and he nodded slightly. He didn’t respond with words, though, and they stayed like that — leaning into each other's space, not daring to go further, yet not backing away — for the space of several breaths. Harry was pleased that Draco was acknowledging their friendship, that he was opening up, but the moment felt like more than that.
In Kings Cross, much was revealed.
“He has a new flat,” Harry had explained, all while ducking a small practice Snitch that Teddy had let loose in the house. “I may have put him up to it.”
“He killed you,” Malfoy said in a trembling voice, almost to himself, and Harry figured he must still be afraid of Voldemort, even after all this time.
“Ah. Some etiquette thing. Are you going to stay glued to my side the rest of the night?” Harry won’t argue. Draco isn’t usually affectionate in public, so it’s a nice treat to navigate the room arm in arm.
Draco stiffened. “I’m not in love with you, either,” he said through gritted teeth.
As if he could read his older brother's mind, Julian tossed the top over the playpen and shouted "Har-reee!" He'd managed full names but put strange pauses between the syllables.
Engrossed in the novel, he was startled by the appearance of an unfamiliar Patronus.
there, and it was all his own doing.
"That's probably a lot to ask, considering who we are," Draco said faintly. Still, he let go of the doorknob. "Why did you come up here, then, if not to berate me?"
"As like… a hobby?" Malfoy didn't need to work a day in his life after all.
But what he really preferred was consent.
“How do you like it?” It didn’t matter to Harry, he enjoyed it all.
"That was one man, and barely a man at that. Don't forget that I know what it's like to fear him, as well. It still feels like he's glowering around every corner. Like I'll never be rid of him." Harry's eyes twitched to Draco's left arm,
"Put what together? How the Unspeakables did it?" He had always morbidly wondered about the mechanics of the ritual, after all.
It’s further past sunset than he’s returned previously, and his guard is down. Draco barely has time to think
"He hasn't been able to change anything so far." The weariness was clear in Harry's voice. "Everyone in the Wizengamot who wasn't directly involved in the war on Voldemort's side kept their seat. The people in power who wouldn't listen to me are still there. I know Kingsley's angry now, but he's been dragging his feet."
“Nope.” Harry sat down on a chair in the corner and propped his feet up casually. “See, I don’t think this Animagus potion is the only thing you’re up to. And I don’t trust you to give up all your secrets. So I’m investigating.”
“Why hire me, then, if you were worried?” Draco asked. He’d been worried himself, that he wouldn’t be able to keep a professional face and would instead revert to juvenile arguing.
Draco shivered at the praise Harry rained down between kisses. "I'm - I'm close-"
before, had he?
"Saying thank you."
"Nothing," Malfoy answered evasively.
This room was in slightly better shape than the others, having been treated with the most potent spells. Most of the furniture was gone, but there was still dust to be swept away and linens to be cleaned, and Draco went straight to work. Potter was less industrious, stopping often to catch a breath of fresh air out on the balcony.
"Tsk." Draco tossed his head. "I speak properly, you mean."
“And then,” Parvati continued, “I began to think about the Room of Requirement. Specifically, about how it works.”
But if Harry has his way, everyone will eventually know that we're together. He's trying to make the world a different place. And I'm glad of that, truly. Julian deserves to grow up in a society that is trying to heal and not tear itself apart painfully. I just..." He let his head thunk back against the wall. "I just don't know if there is a place for me there anymore."
“I've had other things on my mind, Professor. But I promise I'll consider it.”
“And I worked eight days straight for you last week because you were hungover! You owe me.”
"Mother and I were eating breakfast. I wished to give you my regards." Draco was proud of how steady his voice was. Inside he was thinking of the story his mother had just told him, of Lucius' desire to have an heir at any cost. Draco was that heir. Why did he now ignore his son? Was it truly that he did not know how to say goodbye?
The band between them was thick and edged in blue, like that of Draco's parents and grandparents. Married or not, it was obvious what the Manor thought of their relationship.
“Whatever you do, don’t you
Draco blushes furiously, but accepts the jacket. “Here? Do the shopkeepers mind?”
Draco’s hand shook a bit as he lifted the coffee cup again, but he sat up straighter. “Alright then, Harry.”
"Clever."
love you. Our father- a pox on our father, honestly." Perhaps that was unfair. "I'm sure he would have loved you as well. He loved me in his own way. But it was difficult to meet his expectations. You'll be free of that."
Draco downs the potion with a grimace. “Really?”
"Aren't you angry with me?"
Potter cleared his throat. “What, er, what should we focus on today? The next room on the first floor?”
Harry nodded. "Something like that.” His shoulders sagged. "I wanted to see my parents. That’s why I used the stone.”
It... wasn't a bad song, really. A bit simple, maybe.
"Whatever you say, Harry." Draco had learned not to agitate him when he was like this.
Draco drew back in surprise. “Are you allowed to join me while you’re working?”
She turned her face away. "If you feel the need to tell me, I will listen. But knowing won't change anything. And I don't like to think of what they've done to you. I still remember-" Her voice broke, but she continued. "I still remember how you felt inside me. Your magic was sharp, and scintillating. I knew you'd be a powerful wizard one day."
“For a while, I was worried because Harry seemed to be drifting. He ran full speed into things after the war, and then crashed hard. He had trouble accepting that he was allowed to simply live for himself. He was depressed, and I think he felt like his dissatisfaction in life was a burden on us, somehow. You were a good distraction from that.”
Knowing that Draco was the punctual sort, Harry actually arrived in time to collect two puddings — sticky toffee yet again, he was in luck. He navigated his way to the table that Draco had chosen (in the back, Harry noted) and took a seat.
“Latin?”
"You're telling me." The lack of feeling in his limbs - the lack of limbs at all - was starting to unnerve Draco. "How is this happening?"
Malfoy shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “You shook my hand already. In the Forest.”
“I see,” Draco answered in a clipped tone.
“That’s not—!” Potter clenched his fists. “Yeah. Alright, good.”
“Yes,” he breathes, and suddenly Draco is kissing him.
Harry also saw the tattoo he’d caught a glimpse of in the cafe. It was a snake crawling out of a skull, in a sort of figure eight. It reminded Harry of something you’d see on a heavy metal album, not at all what he’d associate with this posh, handsome man.
Potter nodded gratefully. “That’s considerate of you.”
are we doing in the Forbidden Forest, Potter?” Malfoy asked with an anxious tone.
“Why ask him for help? Is he some sort of expert on swords?” He imagined Malfoy fencing, a proper stuffy sport for a rich brat like him.
"Never," Harry murmured into his hair.
“You didn’t. I fed you. You were newly turned and starving, you couldn’t speak.”
"In a way. But Time, Death, and Love aren't purely magic, as they affect Muggles as well. The
"There's something less intense. More like a promise. Would you like me to show you?"
Granger regarded him knowingly. "There are some things we shouldn't play around with."
A smug little smile stole over Harry's face. "I know."
Draco already knew that raising Julian with the old Pure-blood ideals wasn't going to help him in the new world. "I think it's only fair Julian start with a clean slate." Potter nodded in agreement, and Draco suddenly felt compelled to apologise for at least one thing.
The next day Draco was tending to the stand of small oak trees, pruning them in preparation for the wand-wood harvest, when a tawny brown owl swooped down.
Most of the 'public' was ready to see me Kissed."
“Still a pathetically small group.”
She nodded sagely. "But you want him to be."
there’s nothing dangerous down here?” Draco had his wand out, Harry noticed.
Unable to resist a challenge, Harry set upon Draco with his lips and tongue, all while stroking him off between layers of fabric. It was messy, and passionate, and Harry didn’t notice how close he was until his orgasm was nearly on him. Before he knew it, he was coming in his own pants, followed closely by Draco, and they collapsed in a sweaty, sticky mess on the couch like the teenagers they’d never really had the time to be.
Draco shuddered at the thought of what might await him if his mother had her way. Last time he’d been to the Paris flat, he’d spotted a letter from Mrs Greengrass on the silver tray where Narcissa collected her mail. He hadn’t returned since.
“Get off, now.” Draco pushed at him. “I need to find my wand and cast the strongest
Only the lure of a bottle made Julian sit still once they returned to the cabin. Draco collapsed on the bed beside him, worn out. The threat of a tantrum past, Julian tossed the bottle over the bed and curled up on his side.
"They won't be ready for you until tomorrow," the man beside him said. He was wearing a uniform that at first glance looked like an Auror's, but was devoid of any identifying badges and coloured dark blue.
"Na na na!" Julian babbled. "I don't think those are the words," Draco answered bemusedly. Julian raised his arms in his pick-me-up gesture but Draco found himself paying attention to the music as a chorus of voices sounded in the background. The rest of the band kicked in, and the room was filled with a warm sound.
“So am I.” She waved her wand in a reverse pattern, and the thread disappeared. “If she were alive, it would have extended to the border of the room, pointed in whatever direction she was on earth. Not very helpful, of course, since the world is so large. So you see that it can’t be used to actually find your soulmate, just tell you if they are still around.”
“Well, that’s how I felt, regardless of logic. And when I pulled back, you blithely continued on, which just proved my point to myself that I didn’t really matter. I know, I know,” Draco cuts off the protest on the tip of Harry’s tongue. “You love me, and I matter to you. You’re just not particularly perceptive. We’ve covered this. And I’m ready to admit I was hasty when I left without communicating.”
was about breakfast.” Draco’s mouth snapped shut. Harry was right, and he knew it.
Finally Harry must have tired of watching them from the shadows, and approached.
"Don't make this all about Julian," Draco spat. "You obviously want me around for yourself as well, Merlin knows why." He waved his hand at Harry, cutting him off before he could answer. "To help you raise him, yes I know. But it's more than that. You want me around to listen to your troubles, a captive audience."
Harry is only allowed to say it when Draco is asleep.
“Don’t be a stranger forever. I know you’ve been working on the house, but you moved in six months ago. There can’t be that much left to do.”
And just like last time, Harry spun on his heel and Disapparated.
Potter' expression was caught between guilt and defensiveness; the two emotions often went hand in hand, as Draco knew. Defensiveness won out.
"Of course. Draco and I are friends, now."
“Nor would I want you to be.” Draco shudders. “I simply… I find it difficult to open up without prompting. It’s important that my partner can instinctively sense when I need to talk.”
"Or I could, if your wand isn't handy. What can I use for the transformation?" Draco stared back in shock.
"Then we go forward as we have been. But you have to have hope, Draco. We're going to try. I'm going to make them listen to me." Harry had never seemed so fierce as he did in that moment. "The Ministry always wants me around because people believe in me, after all."
“Let me give you that last detail before you accept, Malfoy,” Jones said with a grim smile.
“You’re rather matter-of-fact about me sucking your blood, Malfoy,” Potter says, even as he eyes Draco’s neck with desire.
The witch appeared triumphant. "Very well." She nodded to the wizard, who made a complicated motion with his wand. A glass ball sailed out from a niche in the wall to land in her hand.
sound echoing between your ears, like he's a part of your brain." Beneath his hands, Potter shuddered.
"I've always favoured Scorpius."
A terribly uncomfortable conversation, for one. Did he expect Malfoy to admit to being Harry’s soulmate? He’d just gone through an extraordinary ordeal. Questions about destiny and… and
“Come open this door with me.”
She blushed. "Myself and and some others, yes. We thought it was strange the trials were behind closed doors and...
be asking him to dance.
"I do just fine," Potter responded hotly. "Your mum trusted me-"
Harry pet Draco slowly as he came down, embarrassment creeping onto his face. Eventually Draco squirmed away and crouched at the foot of the bed, shivering. He reached for his shirt, but Harry pulled it out of reach as he got up.
“Energy?” Draco frowned.
And the thread had even been cut. “Why is it like that?”
magic. Harry didn’t like to think about Voldemort still affecting him, but he had to admit it had proved useful numerous times, so he had come to think of it as a silver lining.
There were a thousand things that could go wrong with him and Potter working together, and Draco took a deep breath, ready to enumerate them all. But the possibility of offending Potter, who was his prospective employer, combined with the remarkable circumstances that had honestly sent him reeling, stopped him. Sometimes, Draco had learned, life presented you with a forking path, and cowardice was rarely a rewarding option.
happening.
"I'm just tired of all the expectations," was the weary response. "I can't satisfy everyone, so I'm just going to try to satisfy myself."
"Do you know how to summon the Aurors that are responsible for watching the house, Holkey?" The despondent elf bobbed her head up and down. "Good. Then fetch them." Something near Lucius suddenly caught his eye. "Wait!" He bent over to pull the sheet aside a few inches, and Abraxas Malfoy's wand was revealed near his father's hand.
“I don’t know what I thought—”
Lightning quick, Harry is moving. Draco sprints after him, just a step behind, drawing a dagger from his jacket as he runs. Harry is upon the larger figure in an instant — it’s a man — and the shorter one, a young girl, shrieks and runs toward Draco, screaming in Hungarian. He lets her pass, figuring she’ll get herself clear, and catches up to Harry.
“It’s on the table.” Draco gestured listlessly to the low table by the sofa. Harry didn’t pick it up.
"Well, as you can see, it still recognises my
“What do you think?”
Harry simply planted his feet, "Are you a coward?" He startled for a moment at his own words, then narrowed his eyes and fixed his stance.
“You’re a total stranger to
"There is a spellcasting ritual that makes it possible to guarantee conception of a strong child. It's been passed down in secret through the sacred twenty-eight."
“Yes, elm is well-suited to casting charms that last a long while.”
“There’s still another floor,” Potter pointed out, gesturing to the stairs. “Don’t you want to see that first?”
"You'd rather not? I thought you were here for the express purpose of talking."
"But because you wanted to punch my face or hex me. You did just that, several times, over the years."
"Hey Jules, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better, remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better."
"Blimey." Ron's eyes were wide. "I thought that'd go in a museum or something."
“Er… right.” Draco was well aware that his old wand was on display in the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic. He had studiously avoided the place.
“I’m taking Draco out to the Devonshire site.” If Ginny was thrown off by the use of first names, she didn’t show it, but she did fix Draco with a vaguely threatening stare.
“That sounds nice,” Draco said wistfully.
"Real?"
“Hello, Draco.”
“Not as such, no.” He tucked his face into Harry’s shoulder, hiding his face. “I don’t want to enjoy this,” he said at last, his voice muffled.
“Not on paper.” Draco leans back against the old metal desk in the room as he begins to wrap his wrist up.
"This place is getting worse than the Burrow," Ron said, pushing back from the table. He nearly tripped over Firebreath, whom Draco had charmed to scamper around following Julian."See?" He ruffled Julian's hair; Draco took note of how Hermione watched her boyfriend affectionately as he interacted with the toddler.
“Michael, I swear, if you make us late again…”
“Promise you’ll protect me if the hexes start flying? I’ll be a snake in the lion’s den.”
“You’re OK. Merlin, you’re OK.” Harry fought back the urge to embrace Malfoy, who still seemed to have trouble drawing a breath.
Draco couldn't say that to Harry, who had never known his mother's embrace. "It feels like completion," he said instead, knowing that word was inadequate.
this passionate surrender - this was his choice, and one he made fully cognisant of his own flaws, and Harry's too.
Oh, to have at least one person who didn't think he was evil, who didn't think he'd got what was coming to him. Before he could change his mind, Draco answered decisively. "Promise you won't keep Julian from me if this fails spectacularly?"
Merlin, Potter, you’ve been back in my life for less than a month and I’ve already let you fuck me!”
"I'd assumed, seeing as you killed him, and you sit before me now."
That was the wrong thing to say. Draco didn't know what he wanted; Harry made him feel things he had never expected, made his blood boil with passion, but it could have just been the urge to punch his stupid face, not kiss it. He certainly didn't want Harry to kiss him out of spite or obligation, though.
"With Lucius Malfoy's misbegotten spawn." Harry grimaced. "I threatened to hex him, if it makes you feel any better."
Draco bit back a retort of
.” The way he said ‘work’ with a sneer gave Harry the impression he was quoting someone else. Maybe Narcissa didn’t like seeing her beloved son living so far away and holding down a job like a commoner.
“What are you talking about?” Harry pleaded. He recalled the current that passed between them, just before Draco came inside him. “I don't know what happened… but there was something there, something between us.”
Harry stared at the sword with a newfound appreciation. “Can you feel it, then? That sort of… pulse? I’m not quite sure how to explain it.” Malfoy stared at him strangely. “Right, guess it’s only me, then.”
He approached the counter. "I have a number of things to sell, if you are interested. And yes, I am also looking for work."
“I suppose I don’t,” Draco conceded. “Only, I like the idea of the privacy of having a bedroom door, even if I’m here alone. I know that might sound strange to you.”
“I suppose.” She fixed him with a hard stare. “You haven’t talked about the threads yet.”
“But it’s so easy!” Harry took a satisfied bite of pudding. This was turning out to be a lovely day. Maybe they could stop being so awkward around each other.
In daylight, seen from the edge, dappled patterns of sunlight danced on the forest floor, and the leaves shone in various shades of green. It was a lovely facade. Tonight there was only darkness, and if Harry closed his eyes it didn’t make much difference.
"Ginny and I didn't only break up because I was caring for Julian. There were other things."
And what did Harry stand to gain?
Harry had seen no reason to broach the frankly terrifying subject of destiny when things were moving along on their own with no push from fate. That didn’t mean he’d forgotten about it; that broken thread on his wrist was always somewhere in the back of his mind, no matter how he tried to avoid it. Parvati’s warning that Harry would never know if he didn’t ask rang in his ears.
“Everyone knows that. Even if Rita Skeeter hadn’t written three books already, Narcissa Malfoy’s testimony is public record. She lied and said you were dead, because she blamed Voldemort for her son’s death.”
brother hinges on what you owe my mother! I demand you tell me." Immediately Draco knew he'd overstepped his bounds, as Potter rose shakily to his feet. "No - Potter, I'm sorry - don't go, please, I promise I'll drop it -"
Potter descended towards the top of the castle rather than the tall pointed archway in front. "Bet the Muggle tours never come up this high," Potter stated as they alighted atop a tower. "All those liability issues."
"Most of the farm work requires that, so it worked out."
Potter reached out and ran one finger over a rose, tracing the leaves and thornless stem. “It’s a bit much, innit? What do you think is inside?”
Harry carefully opened the window, his wand hand at the ready, wondering who would be sending a strange owl to his secret address. When he reached for the parchment, the owl pecked his hand sharply and pushed into the room. Harry yelped and watched it perch on the back of his chair.
“Not soon enough for us, probably. But the good news is, it’s so weak that I think the two of us working together will be able to overcome it. How’s your wandless magic?”
"Fuck, Malfoy! Fine!" Harry retreated down the hall, where Draco could still hear him complaining. He probably wouldn't send any dinner up, just to spite him. Draco would have to make an appearance.
"She's allowed one visitor per week, for one hour each time," a nurse was saying to Draco. "Excluding her solicitor, of course. No wands allowed on the ward, and visitors must-"
“Can’t help it if I like the view.” Unable to resist, Harry leaned down and swiped his tongue over the precome that was beading up, drawing a sudden noise from Draco. Harry vowed then and there to keep making him sound like that.
Oh. Potter thought Draco was refusing on grounds of still being an elitist snob. “That’s not what I meant,” Draco explained. “I can play nice with your friends. I just didn’t think it was my place.” He swallowed and glanced back at the door. “Among other things.”
“It hurt. But you’re right, I should have said something as well. I expected you to know intuitively what was wrong. I thought if I had to tell you, then you didn't really care.”
Rippling pools of light moved over the patio as the sunset glanced across the chapel wall. Draco knelt before Harry as a supplicant would, running his hands over strong thighs, spreading them apart. Harry's breath caught. "What are you doing?"
been a Squib, the Manor would still welcome him in." Draco had figured this out after being welcomed back in the Manor without his own magic.
“It’s fine. The estate agent fixed that and helped me with the security spells. You know”—and Potter elbowed him in the side, in a disturbingly chummy fashion—“Ron and Hermione are never going to believe this. Us working together.”
“It sounds as if the two of you were getting on quite well,” Pansy continued. “I assume he’s changed since school, same as all of us.”
"Could I what?" Draco blinked in confusion.
"For the family," he answered in a bitter voice. "But
again, still filled with doubts and anticipation.
Anger welled up, anger that Draco thought he was getting past, and he caught himself before he hacked too hard at a branch. "Sorry," he muttered to the tree.
On one hand, Draco wasn't sure if he could stomach leaning against Potter's back, holding him tightly by the waist, without feeling like the very flames of hell were licking at their heels. On the other, Potter would just bring two brooms up if Draco put this off, and then the secret would be out, and Draco was perfectly happy to delay the inevitable.
"Yes. I looked at you. All through Sixth year. Maybe before that."
“Don’t harass him before the coffee’s kicked in,” Pansy admonished. “You know Blaise can’t deal with your temper this early.”
"And I've got Minerva McGonagall to agree to step down as Headmistress of Hogwarts and take the position of Chief Mugwump." That
“Oh. Well, come back to bed, then.” Harry patted the covers beside him. He’d enjoyed last night immensely, and wondered if he could get a repeat before breakfast.
breathtaking. The sunset over the hills and forests to the west was going to be gorgeous in a half hour or so. He and Potter gazed out over the trees.
Potter opened his mouth to speak. Irrationally worried that Potter could tell what he was thinking, Draco cut him off.
“That depends. Do you allow the House Elves to clean?”
“I meant
Draco laid his forehead against Harry’s back and paused; Harry could feel his hot breath, could feel his left hand tighten on Harry’s hip as if to steady himself.
" For a word he'd never had to use before today, he was clinging to that one awfully close.
"Where did she go?" he asked in a timid voice.
offended Potter somehow.
“Oh, do get over yourself. No one should fear you, you can barely tie your shoes.” Draco rolls his eyes and snatches another vol-au-vent from a passing waiter. “He won’t approach you because he doesn’t speak English, and you speak nothing but. Therefore, it would be rude to converse with me in front of you.”
"Don't presume to know my thoughts." He clipped the branch correctly, and a tiny fizzle of magic popped from a bud on the end. Draco closed his eyes as it danced across his skin, enjoying the way it felt.
"My kingdom for a sticking charm," Draco muttered. "Look,
Draco seemed to steady himself, his arm coming to rest with the stick pointed downward. “Thank you for tonight. It's rare I'm able to share this kind of intimacy with someone. I’m grateful.” His formal tone did nothing to reassure Harry. “However, I can’t be the one to show you the way, here. I can't risk being exposed. Also,” he muttered, “I've probably violated the statute.”
“Don’t you dare interrupt their honeymoon. Anyway, Ron would never let me live it down. Rejected by Draco Malfoy.” Harry kicked at his stool. “No one’s rejected me since school,” he complained.
“You know I supported you,” Ron frowns. “I was surprised when you two started getting friendly, yeah, but when you told me it had gone past that, I figured I’d better get used to him, make an effort to be nice. But
"Brilliant!"
"You know what this means, then," Draco said to Harry with a smirk. "It means that
Anyway, I told you what we were up to eventually.”
me?” Harry lost his attempt at staying calm. “Look here, Malfoy — ”
“I don't have any of Sirius,” he voiced at last. “There weren't any in Grimmauld place, he was disowned.”
“That’s
They continued along the path, and Harry spied a faint glow in the distance, likely from a fire. That had to be where Voldemort was waiting. Malfoy obviously spotted it as well, because he baulked along the path.
Nine o'clock. Draco had just opened the stall then. He'd been sitting behind a cart of flowers and berry tarts, calmly reading a book, while his mother was dying.
Today Harry fucked him slowly.
“We’ll see.”
As Julian turned 18 months old, Draco began to worry about him. He was walking just fine, but he hadn't progressed much further in his language skills. Hermione had reassured Draco this was normal; the fact he'd asked for her advice just showed how concerned he was. Regardless of average childhood milestones, Draco vowed to read more to Julian, and focus on speaking directly to him, rather than simply in his presence. He'd been very wiggly today, but Draco finally managed to get him to sit still after dinner and look at a book.
“Very busy.”
Hermione nodded thoughtfully. "Water is actually a good metaphor, because it's a well of power to draw on. You still have to be magical in the first place to use that power, and then the wand is like a conductor of the current produced."
“Right. How’s the apprenticeship going?” Harry hadn’t heard from Draco in over a month; they were both busy, but Harry found that he missed him.
Draco couldn’t refuse Potter’s cooking, so he quickly obliged and followed him downstairs, where Potter put the kettle on. But as they were packing the basket, a low rumble echoed around the house, quickly succeeded by the sound of pouring rain.
“The Austrian potioneer? What’s your problem with him?”
Ron snorted. “I’m a lifelong fan, but even I know their limits.”
It somehow felt the same in Draco's blood.
"Nothing." Harry turned toward the door, but then wheeled back around. "I wasn't keeping you a secret, you know. All of my - my family knows we live here. Kingsley, Robards, and some of the Aurors, too."
"Won't that
“Fucking Malfoy,” he mutters. He doesn’t want to say Draco’s name aloud, to surrender it to the echoing hallways in a lonely cry. That seems a bit
what ‘centre of power’ means,” Draco muttered to himself.
Eager to oblige, Harry leaned over Draco until there was no space left between them and kissed him fiercely. Harry’s fingertips ran a delicate counterpoint up and down Draco’s jaw, almost tickling, until he followed them with his tongue. Draco pulled him in tight when he began to suck on Draco’s neck, which was one of his absolute favourite places to be touched.
"Take you? I don't understand." Lies, all lies, Harry knew exactly what Draco meant by
exist.”
“Ballycastle? Middling at best. Although their Seeker is rather—” Malfoy turned away abruptly — “excellent on a broom.”
Voldemort was waiting, but Harry couldn’t help wanting to comfort Malfoy, who was starting to hyperventilate. And did ghosts feel the need to breathe?
Draco's eyes were wide and frightened in the firelight, but he stood firm. Harry approached him carefully. “Give me your hands.”
"I just call you Draco." He smiled and ducked his head. "They know how I feel."
You think to ask me this now? After the past couple of months? What, do you think you've just been in charge of me all this time?"
The gravel on the pathway crunched under their feet as they approached the gates. In the distance loomed the Forbidden Forest, imposing as ever. It seemed quiet as a grave, Harry thought. His own grave. He had never known anyone other than himself who had come back. Was Draco frozen in time? Or was he somehow conscious in his limbo, thinking he was dead?
Some days, Harry still disappeared and returned in a sulk. Some days, Draco threw a tantrum over the smallest perceived slight. After gaining Harry's trust and access to his body, Draco actually felt more secure in pissing him off. Not once did they fight in front of Julian again, but alone, it was no holds barred. Tussling, kissing, every passion they had was finally free to be unleashed.
As July crept toward its finish, Draco visited the gardens. It was too late in the year to plant anything new, but there was still maintenance work he could accomplish, and plans he could make for next year. It was the first time in a long while that Draco could recall looking forward to something - to planning that far ahead. It had also been jarring, going from doing hard work all day in the orchard, and then back to a life of relative ease in the Manor. The ennui made him anxious.
“So unfair,” Harry sighed. Then he ground himself back down against Draco's prick. “This works,” he whispered. “Just like this.” He waved his hand, and Draco was confused as to why until he felt lube dripping down both their cocks.
so young, I mean.”
Harry blinked. “I — OK, yeah, I could bring it by.”
“More chalk? What’s it say?”
The work he learned about that day was hard, gruelling even, but it took his mind off his grief. There were seasons and harvests, and the dictates of nature that didn't bow to anyone, and Draco found it strangely comforting. Jack and Lacey were cold towards him, but not cruel - at least not after the Dark Mark incident. They gave him some bread, milk, and fruit before his first week's pay could come in. Mary the Squib had left a few odds and ends, including a matchbook and some candles, and that night before bed Draco lit the stove and enjoyed his first proper cuppa in months.
Now they belonged together.
"I won't be able to visit my mother from that far. I can't Apparate."
“It could be something very subconscious, something you’d never even considered—”
“Too right.” Harry nodded decisively. He respected Parvati and enjoyed her company, but he wasn’t attracted to her. In any case, she believed he was destined to end up with Malfoy.
It was bittersweet for Harry, discovering Wizarding culture for children through the eyes of Teddy. “Does that one have morbid stories like Beedle, too?”
"Visiting hours are over."
Draco stared down at the tiny little boy.
“Wow,” Harry laughed. “If you hadn’t told me banking, I’d have said it sounds like you’re a model.”
“I’m not a baby, Potter.”
"I'm looking after myself. Don't bother with it."
“Luna was researching some kind of creatures, and came across the journal of a magizoologist from the 14th century who mentioned coming across a cairn and a few standing stones in the middle of an Anti-Apparition field somewhere around here. He’d already hiked pretty far into the field and had to stay overnight. There wasn’t anything for miles on any modern map so she knew I’d be interested."
Draco, unable to come up with a more eloquent answer than, “Huh?” took the proffered hand, and felt the twisting pull of Apparition.
been so long since anyone touched him. Carefully, he lay his head against Potter's back, exhaustion creeping over him.
“I'm sure,” Jones snorted. “Didn't think you needed to work. Why bother with peasant stuff like this?”
Lucius?"
“Blaise
“Right,” he instead answered slowly. “Who would have ever guessed?”
In the corridor outside her office, Harry and Draco dissolved into giggles like two schoolboys. “Oh my god, we broke the House Cup!” Harry gasped, unable to contain his laughter.
“That was good of him.” Harry can’t resist the spike of jealousy that rises in his throat when he thinks about Charlie getting to spend time with Draco, when Harry’s been missing him so much. “A two-month summit, though?”
Draco shuddered. “I don’t drive,” he said. It wasn't the usual platitudes Harry expected when someone found out he was an orphan, and he strangely appreciated it.
“No, why do you want me back in bed.”
"I can't live without knowing, and I can't risk losing it again before I can try."
“You can ask for help, you know.”
should be locked up."
planning to use it as a main residence? That will affect what kind of wards I ultimately set, the kind that are elastic enough to withstand opening and closing often, or ones that act more like Stasis Charms.”
a terrible boyfriend.”
secret. Draco was aware that if his father were still alive, it would have been a source of anguish for him, and his relationship with Harry would be an impossibility. But freed from any familial expectation, Draco had decided firmly to not judge his new found sexual preferences too closely, because what did they matter? He was very accomplished in not thinking about worrisome things, after all.
That selfish feeling, the insistence on fulfilling a desire even if it would eventually go sour, was actually part of why Draco adored Harry so much. Because that was like the old Draco, the Draco that stubbornly demanded to get everything he wanted. In the end, Narcissa had despaired of how she'd coddled her son, and Draco was well aware that being so spoiled had made him weak. But it had also made him
“You think I'm brave? You don’t think I’m just giving up?” Harry whispered.
"Five Galleons and not a Sickle more. You know this kind of reading isn't exactly popular these days."
His answer, non-committal as it was, must have pleased Harry, because his smile was brighter than the moon. Draco only had a second to appreciate it; the fountain, dead since Voldemort had moved into the Manor, turned back on in a sudden burst of cool water that sent them scrambling out of the pool.
"Because you don't kiss family." There. It was out in the open.
“It was a lot.” Harry pokes the tart again. “They had me leading missions pretty soon after I joined. I was always gone, Ginny joined the Harpies, we didn’t have enough time together to make a go of it.” Draco hadn’t asked about the girl Weasley, and finds it intriguing that Harry volunteered that information so easily.
tried to eat wool."
!” Harry stamped his foot, aware that he was behaving like a child. “I’m trying to think!”
"I think I know who you need to speak with," the witch said to Hermione. "Will you... will you put in a good word? I've applied to this division several times." Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes.
"Holy fuck," Potter blurted out. "I do, don't I?"
“I don’t- there isn’t much to tell. We were investigating a smuggling ring and were attacked in a warehouse. I don’t remember much after that.” He won’t meet Draco’s eyes.
"That I was staring at your arse."
“They’re cute,” Harry continued blithely. “This, too. Does it feel nice?”
“Er, I’ve got it!” Harry waved his wand and both the leeks and pies began levitating. “We’ll be right out!”
“So you weren’t having a forbidden love affair?” she asked. Harry shook his head vigorously, and she looked almost disappointed. “Then why would you think it was a soulmate thread?”
"Where is she? Where is she?!?" Draco grew increasingly frantic as he noticed several more guards further down the hall.
“You mean we could have skipped all this
“You’re going to be wide awake for hours, now.”
Harry took a shuddering breath. “You think I can use the Stone to talk to Malfoy. But doesn’t the fact that the Resurrection Stone is what called him up in the first place mean that he’s really dead?”
"Fine then! I- what?" Words abandoned Draco. "Huh? Ki- kiss...?"
"Come down and eat dinner." He sounded far too nonchalant for someone who nearly pressed his mouth to Draco's only just that morning.
Suddenly the floor gave way.
“This ok?” he asked.
Irritated nonetheless, Harry tightened his grip and pressed Draco down into the mattress.
When lunch time came around, Potter appeared with a small smile. “I have a picnic for us,” he offered. “I felt like cooking last night.”
“Why, what’s wrong?”
“What if they were in the room with you?”
“I’m glad to hear it.”
“Wake up,” he said, startling Malfoy. “You didn’t scratch the furniture, did you?”
“I am fair at Transfiguration. May I?"
"It's my property."
“Skeletons?” Malfoy forgot the game. “Real ones? People call you for that sort of thing? Were they cursed?”
Harry turned at the sudden question. "What like... get married?"
have.”
"I figured that. Where else would you get ladies' clothes?"
“I’ll deal with you tomorrow,” Harry said with a yawn. He fired a spell at the window, locking it stronger than it had been before, and pocketed Malfoy’s wand. “You can tell me what the hell you’ve done to yourself after breakfast.”
"Let Hermione go. I swear, I
“Yes, but… weren’t you going to take it?” Draco certainly can’t snatch the jacket from Harry. He gets whatever he wants: free brooms and robes from people seeking his endorsement,
"Nah. That's just who you are now. But when you handed me that part of yourself, that was as good as screaming from the rooftops."
"So you want to be 'Harry' and 'Draco.' Doesn't seem likely."
"I'm fine. It just felt like a lot of pressure, like diving underwater." He flexed all this limbs - everything seemed to be in order. "What the fuck was that spell?"
with you. You'll never be happy until you've defeated me somehow."
“…your right wrist.”
It was a promise he knew she could not keep.
"That's fine, then." Potter gazed up at the sky, taking in the stars that were slowly becoming visible. "We could bring Julian up here for a picnic, sometime."
"You were at Hogwarts! He couldn't touch you! You could have gone to Dumbledore, McGonagall, any of them -"
amazing.” He petted Harry’s hair, which was a total wreck. “I only hope I continue to deserve the chance you’ve given me.”
"Hold this. I trust you with it."
“Just wondering.”
“Touch yourself,” Draco pleads. He’ll beat Harry to the finish otherwise. Biting his lip, Harry nods and begins wanking. The visual is glorious, and Draco digs his fingers into Harry’s sides in a bruising grip one last time, holding him still halfway up his cock as he fills him with come. “So warm,” Harry whimpers, spattering Draco’s chest with his own.
“Absolutely not. These past few months have been hell.” Harry remembered his shouts in the Room.
Tromping down the hall, Harry summoned Kreacher and told him to whip something up. He’d never get back to sleep now, but he was still too tired to bother cooking. He tried to not use Kreacher’s services — a combination of his own distaste and Hermione’s disapproval — but sometimes he couldn’t help himself. The elf had mellowed toward Harry lately.
“I'll say. Nothing like having your child back from the dead. Do you think he'll be put on house arrest with her?” Parvati asked.
“That’s why I help her. There’s just… so much.”
I don't care
“Whyever not?” Pansy asked. “It’s an interesting match.”
The phonograph arm moved back of its own accord, and Draco lifted the record off. The reverse showed the inside of the apple, and said "Revolution."
Still, his magic hovered as if it were unsure what to do. Draco concentrated very hard on his connection with the wards, with Abraxas Malfoy's wand. He could feel a prickling at his skin, but nothing settled in. He needed something more personal. He needed his own wand, the one his magic had connected with when he was eleven years old.
"I had things to discuss with your father. He reminded me of many things that I had put out of mind." She sat beside him on the bed. For a moment he thought she would pull him close to her as she had been doing increasingly the past few days, but he was disappointed when she only took his hand.
“Yeah? Take my trainers then, go to the fitting room.”
Draco watched as a water lily drifted over, and pushed it spinning away to the other side of the pool. "Is it?"
Octavia nodded. "That is tradition, of course."
Harry nodded. "The dead spots, too. I thought those might just be echoes from the magic-stealing ritual, but Hermione's right, it wouldn't happen so far from the Ministry."
“I’m sorry, too,” Harry answers. “But not about everything. I’m sorry we argued first, and that we didn't, well, communicate. I know that’s important to you. But I’m not sorry about being together.”
Harry.”
Also, it wasn't like his mother to not seek out all the information she could.
“I couldn’t decide what else to do,” Harry confessed. “I didn’t want to be an Auror after all, even though that’s where I focused my NEWTS. I didn't want to play Quidditch professionally, either, even though I was asked. I might have done nothing if I hadn't gone with Hermione. “
A million other thoughts ran through Draco’s head, and tried to come out of his mouth, before he finally managed, “I see why you have all the security.”
“It’s not like that,” Harry hissed under his breath.
"Harry isn't an Auror."
‘Of course,” Malfoy continued, ‘I haven't let myself think about the future for some time now. It was survival, day to day.”
am I doing?” Draco moans. Harry takes it as a rhetorical question and doesn’t answer, desperately pressing his mouth to Draco’s once more. He quickly returns both hands to kneading Draco’s arse and hopes he leaves finger-sized bruises.
“Calm
he mused, but if he didn't talk to himself, he wouldn't get a chance to talk at all.
"I don't call him that," Potter added. "He can use Malfoy when he's older, if he wants to." He cocked his head at Draco. "You don't, do you? When you answered the door. You said 'not anymore.' What did you mean?"
Draco sighs resignedly. “Harry. Please don’t.”
"No." Draco's shoulders slumped. "I didn't murder anyone. Not for lack of trying," he admitted, though it pained him to do so.
Because that was the most galling part of all this, wasn't it? The fact that Draco, scion of one of the most powerful Pure-blood families in Britain, the very blood that Voldemort had professed to hold above all others, was an afterthought in the aftermath of his war.
“I can’t either,” Potter admitted. “I only wish we could have had this conversation without a load of sexed-up plants making us fuck. I worry that it’s wrong somehow, for us to start something after that. We didn’t choose our first time together.”
After an excellent dinner (he still wasn’t letting Draco come downstairs, the window incident fresh in his mind) Harry went up with a plate. It was their routine for Harry to watch him lick the plate clean, and then get each other off. Tonight started no differently, but Harry had further plans. When Draco was finished eating, Harry pulled him over by the tail, earning a yelp but no resistance. “I have something else for you.” With a wave of his hand, a saucer of sweet cream appeared on the floor. “Go on, drink up.”
Harry didn't get a chance to ask for more details, because all of a sudden the doors to the Hospital Wing burst open.
He didn't know if the Wizengamot would go through with his sentence.
“Just—!”
“Would you like to handle the draperies? I have some protection spells to cast on the railings outside.”
“Right. I don't think McGonagall would have agreed if she was truly worried the fire would rage out of control, but then again, she did ask us to come between terms, so…”
The judge raised an eyebrow. "No pleading for yourself? How very unlike your father you are in this. I was there when he claimed to be Imperiused the first time around, you know. Seems he has wiggled out of justice a second time." Draco had no answer for that. He knew none was expected.
"No, you have to be within the shield when you break the glass."
"This will be fun, yeah? Give you a chance to enjoy it again," Potter said insistently. "Julian's birthday is on Saturday. Let's meet again before then, go out for a ride, and I can bring him up Sunday?"
“Don’t worry, Potter. It’s a simple spell to calm it.” Draco glances sideways, a rare grin on his face. “Or to cause a flood. You and I could turn this whole city into an ocean, I’d wager.”
Harry laughed, a full, rich sound in the echoing entrance hall."
He was led into a room deep underground, further than most of the offices. The same stern faces that had observed his trial were present, as was the gavel-banging judge. Draco sat quietly in the seat provided and stared resolutely at the table in front of him, thinking about his actions that morning. He was terrible at being a so-called Dark wizard. But he wasn't a good person either, and it was time for his reckoning.
“Well, they used to be rival seekers. Probably had a bet or something on the game. Oh! Another goal!”
“Merlin, that’s horrible.” Feeling sick, Harry recalled Malfoy’s trembling hands as he described the fire.
"Draco! Draco, can you hear me?"
He whispers it into the pale shell of an ear, worried the tickle of his breath will wake his slumbering lover. He’s got nothing to fear; the nightmares have passed, and Draco sleeps like the dead.
“No matter. Let's still enjoy the game.”
—simultaneous orgasms. I wouldn’t bet on that happening again. Please Harry, touch me!”
Afterwards, Harry lay awake, staring at the ceiling as shadows crossed it. Draco was on the bed beside him, having dozed off almost immediately.
Weakened, Draco sleeps through the night, all the way to the next afternoon. Even though Potter seemed calm, Draco had warded the door and the hallway with alarms. They haven’t gone off, so all seems well. Draco makes his way down the block to a cafe for palacsinta with sweet cheese and cherries. He's eating heavier food than he’s used to, which is par for the course in Hungary, but at least it helps keep him going.
"I'm glad I caught you before you were asleep." Narcissa still wore her purple dress from that morning, but she'd added a richly coloured green robe as well.
his magic intact. He'd never figured out wandless magic, after all, and Harry was powerful. But he trusted Harry.
Harry didn’t say any of that to Ron. Obviously.
Thankfully, Pansy had neglected to notice the advert was under the Irish header of the employment section. He would have never lived it down. The English pure-blood elite still acted superior to the Irish communities, especially “the separatists,” as some people (his father included) quietly called them. Draco wasn’t exactly sure of the status of Ireland in the Muggle government—he was happy to go to Muggle restaurants and upscale shopping boutiques, but couldn’t be bothered to remember if they still had a Queen or what colonies they possessed.
you're OK?" Ron asked disbelievingly.
Hermione took a deep breath. "I've brought Harry to speak with you. About Draco Malfoy. And other things."
Harry scoffed, and Hermione hid a small laugh behind her hand. “It’s true, isn’t it? That’s certainly not the first letter you’ve received from Malfoy.”
“You’ll have to. That’s all I need, for the neighbours to see me waving sharp objects at people.”
It was only later that Harry remembered — Draco usually tried to avoid the lift.
“Out of what?”
“I didn’t do anything right, did I?” Harry mutters petulantly, his shoulders hunching. “I was
"And yet you continually force your presence on me." Harry's presence wasn't entirely unwelcome was the problem, and Draco was angry and embarrassed about how much he actually looked forward to his visits.
“I mean, it doesn’t
Harry reluctantly backed off, running his hand over the one leg that was bared to him. Slowly and deliberately, he unwrapped the robe from around Draco’s hip, exposing the rest of his body. His cock was flushed rosy pink at the tip, peeking from the foreskin, and Harry licked his lips.
but she just won't listen."
"No one told me I couldn't have a wand," Draco answered cryptically.
“I feel so hot and hungry for you. For your body, not your blood. Is that the vampire inside me?” Harry doesn’t sound bothered by the possibility, merely curious.
“You don't know how it was,” Draco hissed.
“No one
Two men sang at once now, and their harmony seemed natural. Draco found himself swaying with Julian of his own accord, not just to appease his brother.
There was a long minute of silence that had Draco assuming he was about to be told off and Obliviated. Instead, Jones let out a long sigh. “Your resume was perfect, and… well, it’s odd, but I’d rather have someone I know, even if we don’t get along, instead of a total stranger.”
"Why didn't you just throw me in Azkaban," he whispered. "After everything I was convicted of, why go to so much trouble to let me out but hide what you've done to me?"
they disappear.
"It's harder to sacrifice another person than it is yourself," Draco whispered through the tears that were beginning to prickle hotly at the corner of his eyes. Potter startled at that, and backed up a step.
"I never told you what happened to me, did I? Why Harry came to help me raise Julian."
Potter nodded, and followed Draco towards the hall. Their wands were on the sideboard, which struck Draco as odd—but absolutely everything about this situation was as strange as a six-toed Jarvey.
"Did you think about my offer?" Harry countered.
will work just fine.”
No words could truly describe it. Whole? Complete? Embraced? That's it
“I’m not finished. Last night, we rushed things, but I think it means something.”
Draco motioned at some money on the table, enough to cover his bill. “I’d just been about to leave, actually.”
Suddenly the rest of what the nurse said caught up with him and his head snapped up. "Whomever looks after him? Why- don't you mean me?"
"Well... yeah." Harry frowned. "Did you think I wasn't?"
So why was he lying here, feeling like he’d missed something?
Harry relaxed. “That’s good, then. And how was your birthday?”
Through his gasps, Malfoy asked, “Are my parents still alive?”
Merlin, he was right. “Yeah, maybe I didn’t think that through!” Harry laughed, and earned himself a shove that spilled the last of his soda.
It was obvious that Potter was thinking of the same moment in time. “I came close to killing you,” he whispered.
“Not as such — wait. You think I’ve been ordered to kill you?” Potter nods dejectedly. “Merlin, no. You’re just collateral damage here. And I didn’t save your life only to interrogate you.”
"I wasn't making faces for you, silly thing." Draco found he couldn't stay irritated with his brother around. "Fine, Potter.
Cora stood nearby; she seemed strangely surprised to see him.
Draco sucked the rind. It was bitter. "I don't follow."
“Are you trying to figure out how to apologise? I’ll help. ‘Draco, I’m so sorry that I — '”
As Draco held Julian, he remembered how Jack had acted afraid of him. That wasn't the world he wanted for his brother. Children were blameless, and they inherited the discord of their parents unless someone stepped in. He'd been set on his own course from the moment he was born, but that didn't excuse his inability to break away, not when others had been brave enough to do so.
“I wouldn’t have told you to come up if I was too busy. Are you going to get to it, or do you want to gawk at my cats some more?”
"She's dead, child."
Harry pales. “What if I attack someone?”
Had Potter lied when he said he respected him? Did the room change their thoughts and emotions as well as drive their libidos out of control? It made Draco sick to think of, but it was a possibility. Yet Draco himself hadn’t felt compelled to say anything untrue; he’d meant it when he said he’d lay down under the roses with Potter.
“I wouldn’t go that far. And anyway, complaining about work isn’t whining, it’s what everyone does. Welcome to adult life.”
to describe it..But he had wanted to be cosseted, to be assured everything would be OK -
—but met empty air.
Both Ron and Hermione kissed Julian goodbye, and hugged Harry. After a significant pause, Hermione also embraced Draco briefly, pulling away before Draco could react. Ron gave him a stiff handshake.
"I assume you have questions for me."
In some respects, the cabin had become home to Draco in a way the Manor never had. It was set up in a fashion that made sense to him: shelves for his work clothes and sleeping shirts; space on the counter for matches, spices and tea; odds and ends he had picked up within the past year on the table and elsewhere. He felt
“I told Harding I had a lead on you and your partner — Brookfield, was it?” Potter nods miserably. “It’s not a total lie. I’ll be able to go the rest of the week.”
"Not Julian himself," Hermione assured. "But you are connected to your family through the Manor, to every Malfoy that ever lived. Your magic may be attracted to that connection. If we can get you in the centre of the wards, tapped into the house, it might flow back into you like water down a drain."
Harry stuffed one in this mouth. “More for me.”
“Oh, Harry,” Draco said, quite deliberately. “You’ve never killed anyone. You've never even come close to killing anyone.”
did for this story way back in the first chapter! It's on Tumblr but of course I want it included here. I tend to put art at the end of fics. Thank you again for reading!
Draco flushes. “He keeps looking at… well. My arse.”
Draco wisely keeps that to himself. “I was planning on going tomorrow, actually.”
The house was cosier than Harry would have expected from Malfoy, and strewn with even more books than Hermione’s own little library in the house she shared with Ron. The stairs were easy to spot, through the sitting room, and Harry ascended them cautiously. Why didn’t Malfoy come down to greet him? Did he not actually mind Harry traipsing through his home? Harry found himself growing more curious as he came to the top of the stairs and turned the corner into an office.
‘I know exactly what you mean.” The long days spent camping, the rows, hunger, the strain on his psyche. It had been one foot in front of the other. He hadn’t even given much consideration to Ginny, to a career, to a life
come as a surprise - in the end it was his own choice to submit. He wasn't truly being forced.
Julian furrowed his brow, and Draco scanned the room for more green objects.
“Glad you aren’t dead, eh?” he asks, after the waiter brings over a cherry tart to share for dessert.
“Much as I’d love to, I have an early morning. I leave for Madrid tomorrow, remember? It’s a Saturday Portkey.” Harry does remember, and although he will miss Draco for the week, he also meant it when he said how proud he was of the career Draco has built for himself.
“So it’s not just because I’m a vampire?” he asks hesitantly.
“Yeah, alright.” Potter tried unsuccessfully to hide a smile. Draco couldn’t help but be moved; even with the tension between them, Potter still cared. Perhaps they could truly be friends after all.
, and so many things about him now had Harry wildly curious. He couldn’t follow him around using a map now that they were adults — he’d just have to wait to see him at the shop.
Telling Lavender and Cho that they could expect a visit from Malfoy did not go exactly as Harry planned.
Malfoy seemed to mull it over. “You could draw me a diagram of, or at least describe, the site you found it at. Perhaps context clues will be of use.”
As Harry’s breathing even out and he drifted off, Draco stayed awake, just watching him. Never in a million years could he have guessed that answering that advert could have brought him here.
“Oh, how nice, everyone is here already,” Lovegood remarked. She was wearing a blindingly yellow sundress and knee-high socks printed with what appeared to be Doxies. “This is Rolf.” Her companion waved; he was wearing an old-fashioned waistcoat but seemed to have escaped Lovegood’s unique ideas about accessorising.
"Why not just live full time at the Weasleys, or get your own place?"
"It smells like her. I miss her." He put down the sticky napkin and spoke in a challenging tone, daring Harry to poke fun at him. "I wanted her to hold me."
"I'd say your mother turned her back on Andromeda."
"I tell you what, Potter, if you're willing to follow me around, you can chat at me while I go about my day."
Harry did look at him then, green eyes blazing. "Did you
good at it. Maybe with Harry as a partner, and not under the control of the Ministry, it could be exciting? “There aren’t many vampires left in England.”
charm over the door of the canteen told him there were fifteen minutes left.
“How’s Weasley doing with his promotion?”
Potter flushed a brilliant red. “Um. Right.” He looked away from Draco, but seemed to drag his gaze back purposefully. “Malfoy. You know I’m sorry, right?”
"He did indeed. You didn't leave me instructions, so I gave him the bottle that was in the bag as well as some berries we picked on the way here, but he's probably hungry again."
"Saffron only shows herself to those she has judged sufficiently worthy."
"Not for much longer."
as anything, so it probably won’t.”
Back upstairs, Harry is pacing the parquet floor, his hands clenching spasmodically at his sides. His head snaps up when Draco enters the room.
Malfoy bristled. “I already told you, I’m not a shut-in!”
in Hell.”
“I’m not sure,” Draco admitted. “Most people do, don’t they?”
"Harry's gone." Draco scuffed his toe along the carpet. "Why are you back?"
"Are you joking right now?" Draco asked with a disbelieving laugh. "What would I do? Clean the floors with Filch? Hogwarts is a school for
It was completely manipulative, but Draco
Draco felt a tug at his arm. He was being led from the room, down a long hallway. He recognised the place - it was where he had been held in the days leading up to his trial.
"You can't take the Vow. It requires magic. No, this is a legal binding. If the Court finds out that you have revealed any of this, you'll be sent to Azkaban. Standard non-disclosure agreement."
"You're still an arse. Why don't you have your wand?"
With one last look of longing Draco put the wand back in its hiding place, carefully pressing the padding down so that nothing seemed amiss. In the en suite he washed himself slowly and packed several of his favourite hair potions into a small satchel. Holkey had laid a suit out for him that he felt was far too formal for the barbaric act that was about to occur. It was as if he were preparing for his own funeral.
“Yes, I can perform the rest of the repair spells on the Room from here.” Parvati stared in fascination at the trembling, sooty Malfoy.
Potter's eyes grew hot with anger. "His name is Julian. We're going to be visiting Draco from now on."
Rather than spitting messily, Harry swallowed with an impassioned groan. As Draco collapsed forward, Harry stood and wound a hand through Draco's hair. "Let me see you," he gasped, turning Draco's face upwards with a not so gentle yank. Draco could only stare as Harry stroked that hard cock over his face, brushing the tip against his lips, smearing them with fluid that was already leaking out.
Draco doesn’t have a chance to ask what he means; Harry’s hands are already pulling his belt loose and allowing his trousers to fall. Draco is wearing pants, thank Merlin, but they do little to hide his rapidly rising erection. Harry smirks, then runs his hands up the smooth pale skin he’s uncovered, just like in Draco’s fantasies. A pink tongue darts out, and
"I'm not stupid. It's a Muggle lock." She handed over the key. "And the receipts are magical, you can't tamper with them, so I'll
"Mr Malfoy, please calm down."
“Do you think we’ll
had been done to him exactly. Were the potions part of the spell, or would any trauma-causing brew have served the same purpose? Why did they pull his magic into that orb? Did it need a target, or were they saving it for something? The tiniest flicker of hope sang in his mind: maybe he could get it back someday. But Ms. Janney had said the process was irreversible. Draco wiped his snotty nose on his sleeve - stupid, really, as he only had so many shirts - and killed that hope in this heart.
Draco blinked. "I'd assumed, yes." They faced each other awkwardly, both holding the broom, neither making any move to pull it from the other's grasp. For one moment, Draco imagined taking the lead, with Potter twisting his lanky arms around his waist, sweaty and exhilarated behind him, breath hot on his neck. There was no way he'd allow that - would he? Draco allowed his grasp to loosen, the handle slipping down through their hands until Potter tightened his grip.
Instead, he numbly answered, "You still have my wand."
The door opened, and a middle-aged witch in plain but sleek robes gestured for them to enter. She raised an eyebrow at them — neither Harry nor Draco had made any attempt at changing their appearance, and they were both quite recognisable — but she made no comment. “This way, gentleman.”
Her words triggered something in Draco. He tried to avoid thinking about the past - it was a thicket of anger and regret. He suspected it was the same for nearly anyone who came through the war, on either side. So far he'd been halfway successful -although this conversation wasn't helping. But the
Harry waves his hand carelessly. “Well that’s not a problem. I’ll tell them they have to end your probation.”
"You seem to have given up a lot for one child, Potter."
“Interested.”
Parvati looked between the two of them, biting her lip. “Draco, if you still want that report on the Room, you can come by anytime.”
“That’s an understatement.”
Draco laughed, and Julian smiled. "Oh, I missed you so much."
“Climate spells,” Potter said in a rush. “I mean, that’s what we should do next, right? Especially since it’s raining. Or maybe we should have focused on the roof first. You don’t think there will be a leak anywhere, do you? Everything seemed pretty stable when I bought the place.”
used to make Draco smile like that.
Harry gritted his teeth. “This isn’t common. I don’t even know what language it is. Looks like runes of some kind, but Bill didn’t recognise them, and they aren’t in the standard references.”
The thing was, Draco
“It’s not the same!” Draco seems to realise he’s shouting now, and with a glance around the cafe patio — still empty — he sinks back into himself. “It’s not the same,” he repeats quietly.
“So you have to take your pleasure when you can, then.” Harry accentuated his point by leaning in and pressing a kiss to the side of Draco’s mouth.
Harry wasn’t sure he could remain so angry with her, either, after seeing how much she loved Malfoy. Family stuff always got to him. He didn’t think they would ever be friendly, though.
Immediately his body went cold and he was wracked with shivers. He grit his teeth against the feeling and remained standing. Another vial was thrust into his hand, and he drank that one as well, crying out as fire burned in his veins. He was aware of the first witch casting a complex motion towards him with one of the simple wands.
Cam huffed. “All day, my arse,” he muttered under his breath, but he scooped up the money just the same.
"Can't duel without Dark magic?"
"Your song."
She quickly shook her head. "Not to have you, no. But many of your classmates - Nott, Goyle, Crabbe - are all assuredly a result of it."
"The fuck does
“You’ve
As he expected, Julian didn't really appreciate clothes, but he did snuggle into the jumper once Draco reached the cabin and put it on him. "There. Nice and warm. Now we can go sit outside."
Harry snorted at that. “I thought ghosts were so strange when I came to Hogwarts. Most Muggles don’t think they’re real. They’re really afraid of death, too.”
him. The pain fades to a dull roar and Draco is vaguely alarmed to realise he’s hard again. He doesn’t have time to berate himself for being a sick fuck — and honestly, he doesn’t think he will later, either, as this doesn’t
Draco lifted him up in his arms, and practically danced over to Harry, who was watching them adoringly. "We were very brave today, Julian, Harry and I together. You have fantastically talented brothers."
Harry still
to him? His friends’ teasing and his own appreciation aside, he hadn’t really considered it an option.
“It’s one of the first recipes I wanted to learn. It’s my favourite.”
“Yeah.”
Draco's heart shattered for his mother, so heavy with the knowledge that her only child would soon lose everything, and would never have a family of his own. Not that Draco had put an inordinate amount of thought into the process. He just knew that as a Malfoy at some distant point in the future he'd be expected to carry on.
Lavender giggled, looking up from the portrait she was retouching. "Most of what you told me was how he looked. Merlin, Harry, I know you like a pretty bloke as much as I do, but I never thought you'd go for Malfoy."
“Professors can give each other points?” Draco asked, fascinated in spite of the situation.
“Oh really? That’s nothing compared to the shock you’d get if there was still a field!” He paused. “Wait. Why isn’t there a field? Where did you go?”
Or as… companions.” Harry would have said ‘fuckbuddies,’ but leave it to Draco to find the most prudish word possible. “In any case, once we were in a relationship… it took on a new meaning.”
"The trials were all alike. I wasn't sentenced as an adult, though."
"I will. Thank you, Hermione. Send Ron my love."
"Maybe I'll bring a couple up here," Potter prattled on. "It might be nice to talk things out on a ride, rather than cooped up inside." Finally he noticed Draco's ashen face. "Malfoy?"
"You know I never would. But yes, I promise." Harry's eyes gleamed, a pleased smile coming to his face.
"Merlin yes, do it." Harry didn't actually pull Draco's trousers all the way down, just unzipped them and shoved a hand inside. He stroked the shaft of Draco's cock, then returned to his balls, tugging on them just this side of painful as he licked into Draco's mouth, swallowing his sobs of pleasure.
“I can't—I want to touch you.”
Dangling forlornly from his wrist was a thread, torn and frayed.
“You think you’re sweet?” Draco said, eyes sparkling. “That’s cute.” His eyes caught somewhere behind Harry, and he let out a put-upon sigh. “You’ll have to excuse me for a moment. There’s Drover from Accounting, I’ve been trying to track him down by memo for a week. I should have known to look in here.”
"You know," Draco said in a low voice. He wasn't going to go down easily, even if it suddenly seemed inevitable. Harry had to be the one to admit it.
Draco goes red to the tips of his ears. “A pair?” he says faintly, but the clerk is already walking away. Harry is blushing as well.
"So I'm to be sent away to keep them quiet, is that it? Is my sentence longer or shorter than Mother's?" He was already picturing it: the cold sea air, the long stretches of solitude. Perhaps they would be allowed to visit each other in the lonely stone prison.
"Sex and childish shenanigans? Why not," Draco shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. "It's better than fighting."
"They forced me to drink several potions, which made me feel as if I were cold, then burning, then drowning. Between them, they cast over me with what appeared to be unfinished wands." She made a noise of comprehension, but Draco continued. "The final potion... it hurt like nothing I've ever experienced, but deep inside, not like
“No, I… I would like to.” Draco idly touched a pound coin on the table, running a finger around the edge. He regarded it like a foreign object. As his fingers moved, his sleeve rolled up a bit, and Harry caught a glimpse of black ink peeking out.
Harry spoke first. "We shouldn't fight in front of him." He was still holding his face. Draco nodded woodenly and went to pick Julian up, rubbing his back in soothing circles. "I'm taking him for a walk," he told Harry, leaving the room without waiting for a response.
Abruptly, Draco reaches into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled piece of paper: Harry’s letter. He holds it tightly enough to add more creases to the ones already there. Harry can still recall every little word that he agonised over.
"Shut up, you arse. My mother loved him," Draco swore fervently. "And she did her duty."
Malfoy gulped, but didn’t make a move. “Why are you doing this?” he asked shakily.
Draco dabbed the last bit of wetness from his face and watched her curiously. "I can't tell if you care what happens to me or not. One minute you're finding me work and the next you don't even blink while my world falls apart." She shrugged nonchalantly.
Harry stood firm, framed by the doorway, not yet venturing further into the Manor. "I'm part of your life now too, whether you like it or not."
