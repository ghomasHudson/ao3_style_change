His eyes flickered to the Slytherin table, where the students ate mechanically, their faces blank. Malfoy, who'd sent surprisingly genuine apology letters over the summer, looked thoughtful; not calculating or analyzing, but pensive.
He handed the quill back to the woman, who placed it in her drawer. "I'll be right back." She left and disappeared into another room.
"Well, I'm gay. We've both been harassed by other students this year--you for being the Savior and me for...my past. It might make people at least physically stay away from us both if we pretend to be romantically attached."
"For what? For courting a woman while dating me in secret, feeding me bullshit about being afraid to come out? Or that your well-placed ad got to me before you could?"
Cori smiled. "Then there you are." They leaned back in their chair and looked past Draco. "Silver! Claire! C'mere, I wanna introduce you to someone."
"I-" Draco bit his lip. "I can't get into trouble this year, Potter. If they catch us, the worst you'll get is detention with McGonagall, but me..." his chest tightened.
(Is that bad, to curse in my will? Whatever, I don't have time and I don't really care. Sorry 'Mione.)
Harry gaped at him. "Malfoy, you could die!" His eyes welled with tears. "I won't kill you, I can't kill you, I never meant to—"
In a way, this was almost better; as much as Luna itched to alert the Aurors to her father’s murder, it could lead them to Little Red. And she couldn’t stop now—especially not now.
"Because you have a choice. You see, you used a rare spell that allows the caster three choices when the run of memories is over. You may return back to the real world and live out the rest of your life. You can stay in the loop of memories until the end of your natural life. Or you can come beyond the Veil."
"You know, Potter, between your little jokes and this stunt you pulled, I'm one insult away from Apparating on the spot and leaving you here."
Scorpius gazed up at them with wide, curious blue eyes. His blonde curls were so soft against Draco's palm as he supported the baby's head. His smile was as infectious and heart-wrenching as Harry's, and Draco grinned as he blinked back the tears forming in his eyes.
Luna examined her nails. “Oh, I don’t know. I like to live the moment. And for this moment, I’m the one asking questions. So if you don’t want to find yourself on the wrong end of an Unforgivable, I suggest you answer truthfully.”
“Draco Malfoy, you are hereby sentenced to three months house arrest, followed by one year of probation,” Kingsley banged the gavel, the sound reverberating in the large room before chatter rose from the avid audience.
“There’s no ‘but,’ as far as I’m concerned. Draco, I love kissing you at midnight, at three in the afternoon, at six in the morning. Buzzed or sober, tired or energized, I don’t care. I want your midnights, and your mornings. And whenever else you’ll give me.”
soil my silk sheets with your street clothes, you heathen! Sleep in your pants or borrow something of mine!' And none of your clothes fit me, so," Potter shrugged.
“It’s part of the experience. You don’t have to waste your time schlepping to the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, but this is a major cultural city in the world, Potter.”
Harry grinned. "Can we continue this discussion over the breakfast table?" He wriggled out of Draco's embrace and jumped out of bed before offering his hand to Draco.
With a turn of the keys, the engine ceased its vibrating roar. Harry put on his high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat and cast a protection charm to shield himself from the potentially toxic elements on the foreign planet. He'd learned that lesson the hard way when he'd landed on Kuragin for the first time; the noxious fumes of the uninhabited planet made him nearly lose consciousness.
Twenty minutes later, after quite a bit of explanation and teaching, they had a pot of boiling water on the stove. Draco was leaning over, looking at it curiously.
"Harry wh--" His eyes widened as he felt the pull of a portkey, the sound of Harry's amused laughter echoing behind him.
Harry feels a sudden jolt, causing him to stumble back. He is still in his normal body, but this time he's at King's Cross. He waits for the eerie sense of dread to wash over him, but all he feels is peace, contentment. He sees a figure sitting on an otherwise empty bench, and the calm feeling dissolves and is replaced by anticipation twisting in his stomach. He clenches his fists and walks toward the figure, ready to have the confrontation with Albus Dumbledore he'd always craved, but his heart starts pounding as he starts to make out a lithe figure and white=blonde hair.
Draco inhaled sharply, sucking in his lip. Slowly, he knelt back onto the ground, this time closer to Harry. "Then what do you want to be?" If they weren't so close, Harry wouldn't have heard him speak.
60 days, they'd been on the road: him, Harry and Teddy. If you'd told him a year ago that this was how he'd be spending the first 60 days after Voldemort's victory in the war, he'd have called you loonier than Trewlany.
Harry's expression was as pained, yet kind. "Do you have any idea how agonizing it has been to miss you?"
"Oh, lay off him, Pans," Ginny interjected, flicking her long red hair over her shoulder. "Harry, we're all here. What do you want to do?"
"Hey! Watch it--wait, you okay, hon?" Someone with long purple hair and a kind, open face looked at Draco in concern.
Draco disappeared from their shared home in a swirl of green flames, knowing that Harry would follow them soon after.
Draco scoffed. "I told you, Potter, I don't need your pity! Don't sully your good name on my account."
I feel you constantly, your eyes on me. I yearn to touch you, to let myself fall into you, easily and with abandon. Every step I take away from you sends me further into withdrawal, an emotional purge from a Harry Potter addiction.
"I suppose I get why you'd want to live somewhere other than Potter Cottage. The scene of the crime, isn't it?"
Hands shaking, Harry poured the vial into the basin, the cloudy substance stirring with the addition. Once it settled, he took a breath, closed his eyes, and let himself fall.
He shuffled awkwardly away and into the club, his breath catching at the crowd of people dancing en masse in the middle of the dance floor. Harry wondered if it was accurate to call what they were doing "dancing;" it was more like dry-humping, with arses pressed against groins and hands on hips and groans drowned out by the heart-pounding music.
So here I still am, in the middle, somewhere, watching everyone else as they work out where they were and where they are.
Harry'd been sent outside to collect that day's mail haul when he saw one with his own name on it. After casting the protective spells, he'd opened it to see an unfinished and then scratched-out letter.
Draco closed his eyes. "No, he didn't--he couldn't. It was so gratifying and even fun to flaunt my happiness in front of him, but at the same time he's..." Draco swallowed. "He's still my..." He resented the tears the welled up in his eyes, and the way his voice cracked.
“Merlin, I’m batting a thousand in this conversation, aren’t I?” Potter gave him a small, sheepish smile.
Malfoy rose back up again, throwing his head back onto Harry's shoulder. His breath was hot and panting and his smirk was almost a smile, but all Harry could focus on was Malfoy’s gray eyes enhanced by thick, black eyeliner, slightly smudged and running with sweat and exertion.
“Or it could be a case like the fake one with Bellatrix, where someone’s getting some kind of revenge against the others, maybe for not appreciating them? Was there anyone, in any of your memories from Voldemort, where someone was a punching bag?”
"Don't you have friends you'd consider to be your family? That you might even like better than your blood relatives?"
Malfoy huffed. "It's not as if I can force you to come back, Potter. I've done my job, which was to make sure you were still alive and not being held captive somewhere against your will. I've done that. I can go back to the Auror department and tell them that you're not in any danger."
“Tell me, Harry, has that been working out for you? Or am I being more effective than the entire Auror department?”
He grabbed Malfoy's hips once more and spun him around so they were face to face, chest to chest, groin to—
Ron and Hermione had walked a few steps ahead of him and, noticing that he hadn't turned around, looked back at him in confusion and concern.
That said, this is your official warning: don’t fuck with me. Or you might find yourself at an impromptu family reunion.
“Remember, class, your homework for tomorrow is seven inches on the history of the Summoning Charm. You are dismissed.”
Potter looked at him with amusement. "Bossy. Anyway, I brought you back here. You managed to put on your pajamas, but after that, you climbed into bed, you pulled me down. Said I was in no state to Apparate. I reminded you that I wasn't nearly as drunk as you and that I could just use the Floo, but you wouldn't take 'no' for an answer."
"Watch where you're going, Scarhead." Malfoy sneered at Harry, bumping their shoulders together as they passed by.
It was intoxicating, the high that came whenever Draco bit him; when they rutted against each other as he drank his fill of Harry. It was about trust and mutual satisfaction. They both felt the mind-numbing effects of the bite, and Harry had learned to let himself fall into the nirvana, knowing Draco would be there to catch him.
“Right. Well, as fascinating as that is, Potter, was there something you needed? Because I’d really like to go now, otherwise.”
Anyway, Granger has been rather helpful. One of the facts I was able to absorb from her ranting was that, according to Muggle science, energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can change forms, can be converted and shaped into something other than what it once was, but it is constant.
Harry manages to rise on shaking legs, stepping over the puddle of water and the firewhiskey bottles. He stumbles into the living room, clumsy from sleep and residual drunkenness and haste. He kneels down in front of the fireplace and places a call to the only place he thinks can help.
“It was incredibly difficult at first. I worked myself to the bone every day so I’d be too exhausted to resist sleeping. The noise of the city at night is quite comforting when the thoughts in your mind are so loud, so intense, you think you might explode. Some people are bothered by it, but it’s like white noise to me; it’s a constant reminder that I’m not going to wake up to foreboding silence any longer. That there’s a world waiting for me outside my window.
Malfoy shrugged, "It does to me, too, and when everyone started whispering when you walked in, that must've been...intense."
They sat quietly as Draco cried until he couldn't any longer, until his cheeks were nearly raw with tears and all he could do was focus on trying to match his short, sharp breathing to Harry's, slow and deep.
"No, no Malfoy wait it's not safe. Clearly someone has it out for you and I can help you figure it out--"
Harry didn't care about the grass ticking his skin, or the tiny bugs flying above his head as he lay on the ground in front of the Black Lake. He didn't mind the humidity or the fact that his left leg was falling asleep. He didn't care about his cheek getting dirty or his neck straining from turning so long in the same direction.
Because it's 6 in the afternoon on a Tuesday. And if Harry could be arsed to do the math, it would make it about 65 hours since Draco had whispered, "I've got to go," and left Harry with nothing to kiss his lips but the rim of a firewhiskey bottle, nothing to caress him but the sheets of his bed, and nothing to fill his heart except the pain of loneliness.
Harry glared at Draco underneath the cloth, hoping that his heatless scowl would be enough to portray his annoyance at being led blindly. Draco just chuckled.
Malfoy gagged a little as Harry’s cock hit the back of his throat, but he recovered quickly and continued his ministrations as his tongue brought sweet torture to Harry's cock.
But it was when he decided to risk venturing into one Wizarding bar, heavy glamours in place, that he knew three years of anonymity had just come to an end.
Luna pressed her ear against the wooden door and glanced back up at the waning gibbous moon as she listened to the faint sound of painful groans from inside the cabin.
The other boy nodded. "Yes. It's a strange story, actually. My Father fought for...the other side, so I was required to take the Dark Mark. But, let's just say that I realized soon after that my Father had signed me up for something I had no business belonging to. So then I kept out of it as much as possible--until I saw you were still alive, and I knew I had to help." He shrugged. "So, might I have it back?"
"I don't want to! The only people in my life I want to love are Mother, Pansy, Blaise, and you, and he doesn't deserve it!"
Slowly, Draco forced himself to look at Harry, opening his eyes to let the other man see the tears beginning to well.
“She’s on her break, for the moment, so I’m both co-owner and hostess for the moment. Will you be joining Geoffrey this evening?”
Draco turned around, expression indignant. “So, it’s New Years! Tradition tells that whoever you kiss at midnight is supposed to be someone you stay with for the next year.”
Draco should walk away and pretend that he’d never seen him. He was a good person now; everyone at WDKMUS (Wixen District Kitchen and Magical Unity Service) thought so. He worked for a non-profit; he didn’t need to be charitable in his free time, too, especially after a long and emotionally taxing day of working his arse off to help low-income Wixen families.
Draco looked up from his favorite chair to see the remnants of a snowball drip down the window. Frowning, he rose from his seat when another snowball hitting the glass pane made him jump.
Harry's voice sounded gruff even to his own ears. He rarely had reason to speak, but he didn't expect his throat to feel so thick.
“Yes, I work at a non-profit for people without housing. We provide food, shelter, and employment searching services,” Draco hoped his casual tone belied the nerves churning in his stomach.
"Do you really think the Aurors would ignore your disappearance? It's a priority—albeit low, considering they passed it off to the Death Eater."
Luckily, their server approached them with two glasses of ice water and pretended not to notice the way Potter drank it greedily. While Potter recovered, Draco flashed the server a charming grin and ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter nodded quickly and disappeared into the kitchen.
Potter’s jaw clenched. “It’s my—well, it was supposed to be my honeymoon with Ginny, but...well, there’s little point in two exes going on a romantic getaway together, and I already paid for it, so…”
The pounding at Harry’s door was incessant to the point that he knew he could no longer ignore it. With a sigh, he threw the covers off his body, resenting the chill that hit his legs and vowing to return to his cocoon as soon as the interloper had fled his wrath.
Casting a quick silencing charm on the door and her footsteps, she crept inside. It was relatively small and quaint, with a red cushioned couch and walls painted yellow. An old telly stood in the corner, and a fire blazed in the fireplace, despite no one being there to enjoy it.
So, Lovegood, you did me a favor, really, by killing the others. Thank you—as a reward, I won’t kill you before you kill me; I’m sure I was on your list.
She walked through the graveyard, slowly moving her wand in the air over each mound of dirt, hoping to pick on any possible remnants of her father’s magical signature. But as she reached the last grave in the final row, she noticed the wetness of her cheeks, the skin tender from her tears. She wiped her eyes with the back of her wrist, hopelessness sinking into her chest.
"I will when you get that gorgeous head of yours looked at. You must've hit it pretty hard to think you're better."
Malfoy grit his teeth. "I think this is Pansy's idea of a prank. As my memory returns to me, I remember her getting that gleam in her eye after I brought you up in conversation and she said 'You just need a push, Draco, tell him how you fee--" Malfoy's eyes widened.
Harry rose from his chair and dashed out of the room. He barely heard Draco calling, "The bathroom's the other way, Harry!"
Later, Harry would wonder if it was the whiskey, the music, or Malfoy's bloody infuriating smirk that did him in, but before he knew it he was pushing through the crowd as if on a mission.
No, for Draco, falling in love was like boiling a pot of water; no matter how many times he impulsively lifted the lid to check for bubbles, it appeared undisturbed until his back was turned, and then it was nearly overflowing.
Out of all of the songs in Taylor's discography, "it's time to go" is one of the ones I relate to the most. It's just a bonus track on evermore. It tends to be ignored in favor of its more popular counterpart, "right where you left me," which is also fantastic. Still, it's in my top 5 favorite songs of hers, so it's no surprise that it's 3rd on my list of top songs for the year.
No, Draco didn’t need the stars, he thought as he and Harry walked home together, hand in hand, from dinner. Not when he had the whole universe at his fingertips.
Ron prattled on about quidditch, and Harry tried to listen, he really did. But his thoughts drifted inevitably back to Malfoy. He kicked himself again for not choosing a better surveillance point in class; maybe if he'd been watching he'd have seen why Malfoy'd fled class at the end.
And then Draco dug his nails into Potter’s head, eliciting the most sensual groan Draco had ever heard in his life.
“After eighth year, the Ministry gave me a list of organizations I could choose from. All of them were in London, except for one, here in New York.
"Yes, yes, 'Oh Smart One.' So surely if you can manage potions you can figure out how to cook! It's basic chemistry!"
When Lucius had kicked Draco out, he'd felt helpless and terrified of his own shadow, much like he had during the war. Now, the fear still lingered in the back of his mind, but Draco knew there was more to the world than he'd once known.
Closing her eyes, she took a deep breath and imagined soft white fur, sharp claws, and chest-rumbling howls. She smiled just as she felt her body and mind make the familiar shift, her limbs gaining power and speed, her skin no longer shivering in the Romanian winter.
"If you could recognize me under a stinging hex, no amount of drag--no matter how beautiful--is going to keep me from knowing who you are."
Draco stepped outside and the newly repaired door clicked gently behind him. Harry stared after him, and then at the piece of paper in his hand.
He froze, fingers still tangled in Potter’s hair, and he removed them when he noticed the others start to murmur amongst themselves.
Harry’s shoulders released their tight tension. He pressed his lips against Draco’s and pulled away with a small smile. “Thank you, love.”
“Good,” Harry grinned. “Now, can we have a bit of a lie-in before we pick up the flat? My head is killing me.”
Then, he started to slap her hand away. "Your fingers' natural oil makes my hair dirty, Narcissa; do keep your hands to yourself."
The other man raised his hands in surrender, his eyebrows reaching his hairline as he backed away, giving Malfoy an apologetic glance.
He didn't have to see the smirk on Draco's face. "You can't expect me to not have any fun with surprising you. You're so adorably pissy when you can't know something." Nimble fingers squeezed his own in silent reassurance as they continued walking slowly.
Draco tried not to grimace as he climbed into a pathetic excuse for a bed. The comforter was more of a sheet than anything else, and the linens were like sandpaper against his delicate skin. He lay his head against the scratchy pillow and stared at a blank, foreign ceiling for the 60th night.
He sat next to Ron, who was watching Hermione take notes with machine-like speed and precision. While the sight of Hermione in action was entertaining for a minute or so, Harry didn't understand why Ron stared at her all the time.
Harry stared at the letter, brow furrowed. It had been at the Shell Cottage mailbox--a wedding gift from Arthur to Bill and Fleur. Arthur'd been delighted to learn about the Muggle mail system. He'd even subscribed to Muggle catalogs to find more "treasures" and to see how it worked. And, naturally, when his son and daughter-in-law moved into their own cottage, he was ecstatic at the chance to have a pen pal using the Muggle system.
The earth was dry beneath his dirt-caked fingertips as he clawed his way through the soil, pulling himself up and out of the grave he'd known for longer than he could remember.
Harry gulped the last of his firewhiskey, letting the burn run down his throat and trying to elongate the length of his neck as he swallowed. He nearly smirked at the feel of gray eyes following the movement, but he knew outward cockiness wasn't what he needed--what they both needed--tonight.
The flatware used to gleam in the light of the chandelier, but dust isn't shiny, and time doesn't polish.
Despite his disbelief, he jogs toward the bench to confirm his hopes, his worries. His breath catches in his throat when the figure stands and turns piercing, stormy grey eyes at him.
I know it feels as if you'll forever be defined by the last seven years, but I'm eight years past where you are now and I can say with confidence that you are so much more capable—more courageous—than you think. And it's Harry, of all people, who is going to teach you that. Let him, Draco. Let him try to show you how he sees you through his eyes. You won't believe him entirely—Merlin knows I struggle to believe it sometimes—but if he's known you at your worst and chooses to see you at your best, then perhaps you can, too.
Harry weaved through the crowd, murmuring apologies and blushing profusely when he bumped into gyrating bodies, but no one seemed to mind, lost in the haze of alcohol and catchy music.
I first apologized to you that day in Diagon just a month ago, though at that point it was just for accidentally bumping into you on the street. The look of shock on your face made me want to laugh and cry all at once.
It was Draco’s turn to cough, though he liked to believe he had much more dignity as he sipped his water. Still, Potter looked unsettlingly smug.
Draco turned in his arms, looking at Harry with wet eyes. "Good. The last thing I want to do is break up with you, but I couldn't handle it if I lost you any other way, I--" The tears spilled at that. Draco's face flushed in embarrassment, in anguish.
Draco was soaked from the rain, the flowers in his hand unharmed, likely because of an impervious charm. His blonde hair was stuck to his forehead, and it looked darker from the water. His clothes were dripping, too, his white button-down shirt nearly see-through and his dress pants clinging to his legs.
Or maybe it was jealousy that he was confined to the Manor awaiting the end of his trial while Draco and his Mother had been acquitted due to Harry's testimony.
Harry didn’t waste any time. He stepped forward and threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair, kissing him deeply. Draco was ashamed at how quickly he fairly melted into it, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. Too soon, Harry pulled away.
Draco could only nod, but it was enough. Potter reached down and gave Taygete a pat on her side. "Let's go, Tay!"
Draco tells me that Wizards really don't have religion; we celebrate Christmas, sure, but that's less about God and more to do with the merging of Muggle and magical cultures.
Draco hadn’t enjoyed the surprise and begrudging respect that he’d felt at Ginevra’s choice of restaurant for the first night of the would’ve-been Weasley-Potter honeymoon.
Voldemort clicked his tongue. “I’m afraid that’s not how this particular game will work, boy. Now, answer me.”
Draco closed his eyes, a single tear falling from pale eyelashes. Somewhere, underneath the rage, something in Harry wanted to stride over to Draco and kiss it away until the blonde was laughing in his arms where he belonged.
away, not closing her eyes when her vision twisted into orange and yellow swirls before she disappeared with a pop into the thick, smoky night.
“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. “If I don’t do it soon…he says he’ll kill me.”
Draco bent down slowly, hesitatingly, just enough for Harry to finally close the distance and capture his lips.
After it felt like hours had passed and every tear had been drained from his eyes, Harry stood, cleaning the smeared blood from his skin and clothes. He knew he should call for help, but for the moment he felt himself walk to the cabinet, running his fingers along the smooth wood.
Draco smirked a little. Then, suddenly, he leaned in and planted a quick kiss on Harry's cheek. He was gone from the hallway an instant later, and if Harry didn't know better he'd think Draco had Apparated.
Instead, Harry swallowed against the lump in his throat, straightened his back, and squared his shoulders, a cool, Slytherin mask of indifference on his face. He'd learned from the best, after all.
"Potter, you do realize there are laundry spells, don't you? So that dirty clothes don't stink up one's closet?"
“I can help you there,” Draco reached into his pocket and handed Harry a small slip of paper. “This is the Floo of a great Mind Healer. They take Unbreakable Vows to keep sessions and clients confidential, you know, so there’s no risk.”
Draco froze, the mobile he held next to his ear nearly slipping from his fingers in surprise. He was jostled by the crowd in Diagon Alley passing around him where he was stopped in the middle of a busy walkway.
Teddy. Sweet, innocent Teddy whose parents and grandmother had been killed fighting to give him a better world. Harry was already a wonderful godfather, and Draco had done his part as Teddy's cousin and now caregiver, but there was only so much that two young men knew about raising a child.
I laugh and toss my cigarette to the ground, crushing the ash under my new dress shoes. "When have I ever?"
Outside, the sun rose over the horizon, its rays illuminating a lush green forest and bringing the dawn of a new day.
Draco grinned, bringing his lips down to Harry's for another kiss. The grandfather clock ticked away, counting the seconds until forever.
Luna cleared her throat and pitched it low. “Fenrir? It’s Lucius,” she said with as much of a posh drawl as she could manage.
Harry's heart clenched. He walked up to Draco and wrapped strong arms around him from behind, expecting to be pushed away. Instead, Draco leaned into the touch.
He looked around at the other eighth years in the circle. He supposed the tension and awkward feelings had dissipated since his apology and conspicuous personality change. He even played chess with Weasley, which was as close to best mates that the two of them would ever reach.
“I’ll be alright. But come closer, Lucius. Let me see you. The curtains are too thick, and I can’t reach my wand to open them.”
What he hadn't anticipated was for Potter to do so while sitting on the back of a Peruvian Vipertooth.
I've never been very religious, at least not as much as my Aunt Petunia. She used to have people over for a Bible study and I'd press my ear against the door and listen to them talk about love and peace and hope and all the rewards of letting God into one's life, and I wondered what sin I'd committed that made me undeserving.
He and Ron ventured outside, through the courtyard and into the open area beside the lake. Harry felt a surge of victory and relief at the sight of Malfoy sitting on the bench, his head tilted back with a soft smile as if enjoying the warmth on his face. His hair glittered golden in the sun.
It used to be biting, cruel, and full of insults. But now, when it was just the two of them on the couch, his head on Draco’s lap with long fingers carding through his hair, Harry loved when Draco would just talk endlessly. He’d go on and on about his job, the latest gossip courtesy of Pansy, his mother—any and everything, and Harry couldn’t get enough.
Harry was speechless for a moment, unable to do anything other than look at Draco, before he saw Draco brace himself and start to give Harry a resigned look.
Harry's gut twisted—with guilt, with bitterness. "How do you know that?" He spat, more angrily than he'd mean to.
Harry flushed, both from embarrassment and indignation. "The war's over! You deserve the same chance as everyone else."
Harry shook his head. "Flatmates don't do that—disappear for three hours after a fight without saying where they’ve gone."
Draco stood in front of the class, surveying the room and trying his best to affect the holier-than-thou air he'd perfected over the years. Green eyes stared sharply as if trying to penetrate the facade, but he ignored them.
You watch his hands from across the room, see him grip his pint with the fingers and hands that have been on you, in you. You see him tilt his head back and laugh, elongating the neck you've traced with your tongue, careful not to leave marks that would last until the morning.
"Well, Lucius, as riveting as it's been to catch up, I'm afraid I must depart. My boyfriend awaits."
Harry turned onto his side to stare out the window, marveling at the novelty of sleeping somewhere with a view other than cramped, blank walls.
Draco waited for Potter to take a cocky sip of wine. Then he let a slow smirk, tinged with meaning, spread across his face.
Satisfaction twisted in Draco's chest, hot and sharp; he looked at the man who used to be Father but who would now and forever be Lucius. The man's hair was thinning and becoming more silver than blond. Draco rubbed a hand over his own clean-shaven face, relishing the jealousy the flared in Lucius's eyes. Father had always liked his face free of stubble.
She rose from the bed, letting herself watch her husband as he lay completely still, sleeping no more.
Once on the street, he leaned up against a nearby wall and cast a privacy charm. He took out his mobile, listening to it ring against his ear.
Harry let out a short, humorless sound that was more of a grunt than a laugh. “Welcome to my world.”
Harry'd held himself together the entire time, plastering a small smile on his as Draco stepped into the Floo for the last time. As Draco had disappeared from Harry's life like the smoke surrounding him from the green flames, Harry'd wondered if he'd seen pleading in those gray eyes. As if he'd been willing Harry to say something to make him stay.
"Congratulations," Harry said evenly. He walked out of the office, the sound of Draco's soft sobs echoing in the hallway.
He stood there, his mind whirling with images of pale hair, glittering grey eyes, and softly smiling lips that leaned in to press against his skin.
touched down on the ground, kicking up red dust. Landing the ship used to be Harry's least favorite part of flying; at first, his instinct had been to fight against the pull of gravity, but Captain Lupin had taught him the art of using the force to his advantage, a guide to a smooth landing.
Draco bit his lip. “What if I’m not…enough for you,” his voice was quiet, making Harry’s tiny flat seem huge.
"If only you would use your powers of observation for discovering the cause and not the symptoms of my frustration, this conversation would be over."
Harry glared a little. "I can teach you to cook, I just can't explain why everything works the way it does. Here, let's make something simple, like pasta."
Draco folded the note and tucked it back into his pocket. He looked up at the sky with a soft smile. He wondered if London had as much smog as New York. He thought about Pansy and Blaise, and their flat he hadn’t seen. He remembered the rainy weather and mild summers, compared to the sweltering heat of Midtown in July.
Harry started toward him, but Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry's chest. Harry stopped, raising his hands placatingly. "It's not too late. You don't have to finish fixing it. We can destroy it—together. And then we can go to Professor Dumbledore."
With professors, it was "Mr. Potter," whether said with McGonagal's fond, stern exasperation or Snape's chilling drawl.
Soon after, when the Dark Lord turned their home into a military base, Lucius smelled of burnt wood; the dark circles underneath his eyes would make pale eyelashes stand out against his skin as they fluttered in his sleep.
I watch Greg stumble through the Floo when he has nowhere else to turn, a cheap ale on his breath and his t-shirt rumpled. I see him grin lazily at me before he staggers wordlessly to the guest bedroom that I don't bother to ask the house elves to make up. He'll just be back again, and I let him.
Draco groaned, forcing his aching body to sit up in his bed. He pressed a hand to soothe his pounding head and rub his eyes, scowling when he saw residual thick, dark eyeliner staining his fingers.
Draco burst through the door, his eyes red and wide with panic. Harry’s stomach dropped at the sight.
Draco glared at Pansy. “Things change, Pans,” he said, the warning laced his tone. The bint shrugged at him, unconcerned.
When I let myself think about it, I fail to understand why I'm so drawn to you. I used to loathe myself for feeling like just another among your followers, but my connection with you went beyond mere admiration. I watched you constantly, as you did me, and I saw the parts of you that no one looked close enough to observe.
Draco's head pounded in protest as he forced his eyes open against the streaming sunlight. He raised a feeble arm to defend against it, squinting and using the other hand to rub the sleep from his face.
Malfoy smirked. “Unlike you, I wasn’t raised in a barn, so I don’t carry diseases. But we snakes do bite, so mind your place, Weaselbee.”
Kingsley shook his head. “She says it was revenge for how they treated her during the war, that they had it coming. Either way, I’m glad to have her behind bars and awaiting trial.”
7. He doesn’t cry often, but when he does, it’s heart-breaking because someone so lovely, so utterly good should never be made to cry.
Pansy sighed. “We were, but then we came back here for a few more, and he got into my tequila when my back was turned.” She shook her head. “Tequila is his one weakness—well,” she smirked. “One of them, anyway.”
"No, wait, tell me," guilt curled in Harry's stomach. "I want to hear. I'm listening now, I promise."
and her friends all speculated on the identity of the vigilante. She made sure not to mention the figure in the
"Yes, I am angry--and the reason for that is obvious if you merely look around the room and see if you can identify what might be bothering me."
!" His voice was raspy and he coughed violently against his unused throat, but it was enough. His rib twitched and snapped, causing him to hiss, but he watched as light seeped from his body to take shape. The colors swirled as the details began to form: wild black hair, green eyes, tanned skin, unsoiled.
"Couples don't call each other by their surnames," Mal--Draco rolled his eyes. "We've got to be believable."
"Because we know you're trying to do better. I saw you trying to repair damaged parts of the castle. And we've seen you reading Muggle books in the library, helping first years, and you haven't said a rude word to anyone since you apologized. You're not the same person you were before the war, so we're willing to help make sure you get another chance."
you. But I won't say that because burdening you with my guilt wouldn't be fair, either, and because the last thing I want is for you to start apologizing for your boyhood misdeeds
Draco let the thought linger for a moment. He considered Pansy and Blaise the siblings he never had, and it wasn't as if his Father had really raised him.
Draco recalled Narcissa reading him bedtime stories of dashing knights and magical creatures, but his favorite had been of a powerful dragon that had defended against attackers with sharp teeth and poisonous breath. Saint Martha calmed the beast into submission, and then villagers had stoned the dragon to death.
“No! You came to me, remember? You told me, ‘Potter, I can’t do this, I’m desperate, you can trust me!’ But I’ve seen you sneaking into the Room of Requirement, constantly taking books from the restricted section. You were lying then and you’re lying now.”
"Then why, pray tell, are you wearing only pants?" Draco drawled, finally regaining some of his pride.
But with Harry, he could be his truest self, letting his love and happiness bubble up erupt within him, reckless and free.
Draco's mother once told him that having a child was like having one's heart walk around and live outside one's body.
“So, do you know this show?” Potter asked as the two of them settled into their seats. Draco had to admit, Ginevra had picked well. Row A of the center mezzanine offered a great view
Harry sighed. He wasn’t sure about the safety of Apparating or taking the Floo with someone in your arms, and the twists and turns of the Knight Bus could make a sober person sick up. With a grunt, he hoisted Draco up and into his arms bridal style, and the other man yelped and then giggled wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck.
"I can't believe you'd betray me like this." Draco shook his head mournfully, bits of snow falling from the top of his warm hat. "I trusted you."
Oh, you might've dyed your hair, changed your name, and shed your skin like the creatures under his command, his tongue, but I see you.
Draco's lips were perfectly parted, and Harry saw his chance. He stood abruptly from his knees and pulled Draco into a kiss.
He returns to the tattoo parlor alone. He winces under the sharp needle, but he's careful not to jerk away.
Draco started toward the door. He opened it and stepped through the threshold, stopping for a moment to turn his head so his face was profile to Harry.
Draco licked Harry's neck once more before gently but firmly sinking his teeth into the skin, drinking his fill. Harry groaned, his knees buckling slightly. They rutted against one another, Draco still managing to move his hips in tandem with Harry's. The heat of their clothed cocks combined with the bliss of the bite was enough for Harry's cock to twitch and spill into his pants untouched, Draco following shortly after as he licked up the remnants of his meal from Harry's neck.
Draco sighed. “I think about it every time I glance down at my forearm. At least this way, some good might come of it. I want to help.”
I want to slip out the door without you noticing. I want you to wake up, disoriented and confused with sleep in your eyes. I want you to call for me and be met with silence. I want you to search every room of the house and shout my name, trying to ignore the growing sense of dread that pools in your stomach before you realize that I chose not to let myself die in order to continue living with you.
Cori shook their head with a small, amused smile. "I'll send you a few websites. For now, just use my pronouns right and we'll be fine."
Malfoy shook his head rapidly. "Nothing. Forget I said that. I must still be lightheaded from the box--"
But Kuragin would be a prize; Harry was lucky to have reached it before a rival Explorer from another planet got his greedy, posh little hands on it.
And when the potion had slid down Harry's throat for the first time, and his mouth had stretched wide, he thought it might just clear the fog in his mind and give him the kind of happiness that'd always eluded him.
Draco turned to look at Harry and squeezed his hand. Harry squeezed back, twisted around to turn off the lamp, and returned to pull Draco into his arms.
The smile Draco loved so much melted into a frown, and he hated the sight. "Alright," Harry said with a resigned sigh. He carefully removed the bundle from underneath his shirt, revealing an adorable black and white cat with a blue collar.
Harry flexes his fingers, watching the words that are etched into his skin stretch with the movement.
The Lambs Club was one of Draco’s favorite upscale restaurants in the city, and as he walked up the familiar steps and through the door, he felt a sense of calm at the tasteful decor. The paneled walls were painted black, with small pictures of old Muggle celebrities hanging around the room. The red booths and chairs looked brighter in contrast, and the fully-stocked bar stood proudly against the wall.
Draco tried to keep his feet from shuffling against the cold porcelain floors as he approached Him where He sat on His throne, a regal silver to match His locket.
I suppose that's the point of this letter. Here I am, reflecting on what I wish I could tell you, past Draco, about yourself. The things I see in you—in us. The future we have.
His guide smiled. "This is the dressing room. Not many people get a backstage pass like this but--well--you seem like you need some help."
"Potter, I don't care that you're in Kyoto and sorry. You could be in Moscow and hungry, or in Paris and tired, or in New York and happy. Not my problem."
Draco's eyes roamed the crowd until they found Cori, Claire, Silver and Pansy chatting at a back table, laughing as if they'd known each other for ages. Draco felt a swell of pride. They'd been relieved, when Draco'd introduced Pansy to their drag family, that the family Draco had chosen got on well after just a few weeks of knowing one another.
I used to think that you adored the attention of the press. But then again, I used to believe a lot of things; you convinced me I was wrong about nearly every one of them.
Draco watched in shocked silence, trying to still his trembling body. He observed Potter, Granger, and Weasley huddle together and talk in hushed voices.
The flatware used to gleam in the light of the chandelier, but dust isn't shiny, and time doesn't polish.
"Overthinking--whatever it is. I can practically hear you panicking internally," Potter's rough, sleepy voice was far sexier than should be allowed. "It's fine."
"We're not dead, are we?" Pansy asked, wiping away slime from her cheeks. "Potter, you're the death expert, is this the afterlife? Or am I actually covered in ghost guts?"
The other Aurors around the room nodded and murmured in agreement. Harry’s lips twisted slightly, still bewildered. Why would Bellatrix just turn herself in to the authorities? She’d been missing for so long, most of the Wizarding World had forgotten about her. Either way, Harry supposed, it was only right she serve time for her crimes during the war. He didn't give it another thought once Kingsley slanted him a look for not paying attention to instructions. Harry smiled sheepishly before pushing Bellatrix and Little Red out of his mind.
He had always thought that Potter basked in the attention, that he flaunted his fame and enjoyed the fawning from, well, almost the entire Wizarding World, really. But now, as Draco looked closer, he could see the irritation in the way Potter kept his lips pressed together, the small smile plastered on his face not reaching his eyes. He could, even from the Slytherin table, notice Potter’s exhaustion with it all.
After the war, Narcissa knelt before the fireplace, scraping up the ashes there with a shovel the way she'd seen the house-elves do before many times. She could use her wand; she wasn't the one with limited magic. But she wanted to see it, the remnants of chaos.
I laugh and toss my cigarette to the ground, crushing the ash under my new dress shoes. "When have I ever?"
nowadays, his only reprieve is found in the alleyway behind seedy Muggle bars, taking anything He will give him: His cock, His hand, His come; never His arse, never His mouth. harry offers himself over every time, hoping He will just take and take until harry's just a living body, and nothing more.
I watch Blaise pour himself into his work. I watch him gesture wildly into the Floo when he finishes work calls that delay our friendly dinners, his eyes bright and intense as he rants in complicated jargon. I watch him shy from sensitive topics in favor of discussing his job and his co-workers, and then shifting to mine, and then back to his when the subject dries up. I watch him politely send me off; he has work to do.
He made it to the elevator in just enough time before it closed, smiling apologetically at the crowd of people packed inside. He tapped his leg nervously as he watched the floor numbers get higher and higher until finally the car reached the 15th floor.
Suddenly, the Floo roared to life, making Draco jump. Harry stumbled through with a panicked expression on his face, dusting the Floo powder from his formal robes.
Did Granger write that speech for you? She must've, the little do-gooder. I'd wager she was torn between helping you save face and the cruel irony of eulogizing her schoolyard bully.
It's peaceful—or it was until he heard a loud and concerning noise coming from near the greenhouses and decided to investigate and saw Potter sitting astride a bloody dragon.
And no one says "Potter" quite like Draco, spitting it from his mouth like it tastes foul. Now, Draco only calls him "Potter" when he's frustrated with Harry, but it usually doesn't pack quite the same punch. Harry loves trying to see if he can rile him up enough to say his last name like he used to, shooting from his lips like a bullet.
“A year ago?” Father shrugs. “Five? Twenty? Who knows. What matters is that you’ve both made your choice. And now, so have I.”
Malfoy Manor was colder than she remembered. Luna ignored the blaring wards, knowing she only had a little time before someone was alerted. But it wouldn’t take long; she only had to find—
So when Harry stood in the middle of downtown Muggle London facing the entrance of "Deliquesce," the gay club he'd heard about from a too-knowing, winking Seamus, he knew there was no turning back.
Pansy was as close to a biological sister as they'd ever had. Cori, like Draco, used they/them pronouns, but while Draco was he/him out of drag, Cori identified as nonbinary in their real life, too. Silver was nonbinary, too, but they used all pronouns.
"Well spotted. Now you should probably get going; you wouldn't want to sully your reputation by being seen with me," Draco couldn't help the bitterness that laced his voice.
"Because you're alive, Harry!" Draco said, slightly exasperated. "You're alive and you're here against all odds, and those shit-for-brains relatives of yours never celebrated that so I'm going to, damn it."
They lead Draco into a back room. A row of mirrors and chairs lined the wall, as people chattered and sipped cocktails and ran around with wigs, half-done makeup, clothes, and heels. Draco blinked, stunned.
If this would be an indication of what his eighth year would be, Harry wasn't sure how much longer he'd last.
Draco knew it was a statement, not a question. He bit his lip, blinking back the tears that formed in his eyes.
I walk and when I bump into another rushing figure, I am filled with dread, with anticipation. An apology is on my lips, first for the jostle, and then probably for crimes I didn't commit but witnessed and was too powerless to stop. Not that that matters, to them. And with the actor not available to repent, an accomplice is the next best thing.
“What is it that you’re looking for from me, Lovegood? I’ve told you all I can. If you’re going to kill me, then go ahead. My son-in-law might not be fond of me, but he’ll not be happy if my son loses a father.”
Draco's heart melted as he watched Harry cooing at the kitten, which licked the tanned wrist of the hand that gave it comforting strokes across its head.
When she stood, her hands were smudged with black soot, her dress dirtied from where she'd been kneeling. Her back ached, whether from the strain of bending over or sleeping on the couch for nights on end, her wand underneath her pillow. Just in case.
“Father!” I stumble forward, my arm reaching out futilely to stop him but instead grasping empty air. I look at the flames swallowing the only home I’d ever known. Perhaps an
Landing the ship used to be Harry's least favorite part of flying; at first, his instinct had been to fight against the pull of gravity, but Captain Lupin had taught him the art of using the force to his advantage, a guide to a smooth landing.
Harry moved his lips against Draco's still, shocked ones; he started to pull away, an apology at the ready, when Draco finally responded, moving against Harry's mouth with passion.
Either way, despite my embarrassment, I find I wouldn't change a thing. Even though you drive me mad half the time, you bring out a side of me that used to be rude and angry and bitter. Now, I see that I was angry that you made me want to be a better person. I lashed out all those years because I couldn't handle the fact that you made me want to change, after being told all my life that my blood made me perfect.
The other boy winced. "I was going to walk away, but you sounded so...I couldn't just...I'm sorry, Draco. I didn't give you a chance to explain."
Your hands on my hips, the stars winking in approval above our heads, swaying to the rhythm of our beating hearts.
Draco felt the tears welling in his eyes as he glanced around the room. He could feel Potter staring at him in shock, lips parted as if about to speak.
was his greatest triumph and biggest mistake. At first, he blamed it on completing his due diligence; every good potioneer should know and test the effects of their potion.
Draco was grateful for the chatter that filled the room with some sense of normalcy, but his chest clenched when he noticed the conspicuous silence at his own table. The first years were clearly terrified, huddled together at the end of the table, while the older students ate dutifully, their expressions blank, emotionless. He swallowed the guilt that rose in his throat like bile.
I sincerely hope you are; existing, that is. Others have given up hope. I’ve read every theory printed in the
The bruise on his cheek from last week's raid was slowly healing, despite the Healers' best efforts.
“Don’t stop,” came a whisper from plump, bitten lips. Draco looked down into wide, pleading green eyes and did the only thing he could.
But here, in the comfort of my dorm and with the distance of this journal, I feel ready and able to say the things I want to one day vocalize. But for now, let my written words be enough.
Draco sat up with a start. "If one of us is undeserving of this relationship, it isn't you. I never, for one moment, want you to doubt that."
His mother touched his arm tenderly, causing him to look into her soft gray eyes. A tear was rolling down her cheek as she smiled at him.
The lack of wind in Midtown makes the heat worse, but the sleeping sun provides relief from the summer’s sweltering blaze. Draco usually swallows down his longing for England’s cleansing rain, but on these nights, when he feels crushed like Atlas under the weight of the world, he lets the bitter melancholy rise in his throat.
His face looked back at him in the mirror; he saw the same familiar collection of features. His father's hair and face, and his mother's eyes; none of it his own.
I cannot believe I am being so inordinately reckless. Putting my thoughts to paper is idiotic, even if this journal is protected by a spell only I can take off; they have ways of getting information. They always do.
a hangover potion and drank it down, wincing at both the bitter taste and the fast-acting effects. He shook his head and looked back at the source of the disturbance.
That was a beautiful ceremony, wasn't it? It's nice to see that Hogwarts would mourn even its more nefarious students.
It didn’t take long for Luna to get to Romania. Getting a Portkey only took a day, and once she landed, she headed straight for the morgue.
He'd lie in bed after she'd gone, wondering if perhaps the dragon had reasons to attack. Maybe the villagers meant to kill it. Maybe it wanted to be left alone. Or maybe that's all it knew.
"I took her to the animal healer, and they said she was fine. She’s a British shorthair by the way. But they also said if someone didn’t take her she’d go to the pound and she’s so small and vulnerable and she nee-“
“Are we really back to Potter? Draco, please, we both want each other and now you know! Let me in—or don’t, but you’ll have to face this sometime. I’ll stay out here all night—rain or shine.”
"You've got 20 stitches, along your stomach." Draco closes his eyes, his own voice quieter than the steady beeping of the machine next to Harry.
Harry snorted. "You're a fast learner. Took me and Ron years to learn to just let her rant. We absorb what we can, but when she really gets going..." He trailed off, a soft, fond smile taking over his face. Merlin, he loved his friends.
His words were swallowed by Potter’s lips on his, insistent yet gentle. insistent yet gentle lips on his. Draco melted into the kiss, his heart racing as he wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck to deepen it.
"Potter, Potter, slow down," Draco said, holding up a hand. "Would you like some tea? And perhaps a shower?" Draco wrinkled his nose.
I wonder whether Robards thought he was torturing me by giving me your case; perhaps he decided it would be a proper punishment for me to spend my days looking at your scarred face in your file and coming up with ways to find you. If I succeeded, I’d be helping a former rival; if I failed, I’d be proving all their assumptions that I’m either nefarious or rich and lazy, take your pick.
“Excuse me, I’ll not be mistaken for someone with such atrocious romantic taste, no matter how good Weasley is at Wizard’s Chess.” Draco brushed a small piece of wood from his robes and ran a hand through his hair to shake out the dust.
"It's not pity!" Harry's voice rose defensively, his blood boiling. "I didn't fight a war just so that everyone would go back to hating each other."
Potter's hand is warm on Draco's arm as they make their way outside. The stars watch over them, greedy and protective.
There were moments when panic held Draco’s mind, his heart, in its icy grip, making him shake at the thought of losing Harry, of not being enough for him—of all of it being a dream from which he’d surely wake up to find himself in a dark, damp cell in Azkaban.
Harry shrugged. “If you don’t like those terms, I can come up with more. Now that I’m on bed rest, I’ve got plenty of time to think.”
Moonlight glittered on the East River, reflecting on the side of the buildings and the trees surrounding it. The streets were empty, free of tourists and locals and others who might draw Draco from his thoughts.
That night, I dream of standing in the middle of a tunnel. Potter is on one side, extending a hand and beckoning me to his side. On the other side, there is familiar darkness waiting to fold me into its cool, misty arms.
“Of course I can, Harry,” Draco’s voice was quiet. “I’m not expecting you to throw off your mental illness like you can
**this is technically a sequel to a microfic, but it can be read on its own. The microfic is here for those interested:
Potter opened his mouth, probably to ask Draco what he meant, but he was interrupted by the lights going down.
Draco valiantly ignored the twist in his chest when he looked across the room and saw Pot-Harry stumbling in his slow dance with Ginevra Weasley. They were laughing, their eyes crinkling in amusement as they found their rhythm.
Harry turned around to see Malfoy approaching him in the otherwise empty corridor. He nearly sighed. He was so relieved to finally have some space to himself without having to hide under his invisibility cloak. And here Malfoy was, albeit unknowingly, disrupting his respite from the pestering fans.
Luna’s lips pressed together tightly. “He’s…as expected, I suppose.” Harry felt his cheeks heat in slight shame. Xenophilius was a bit of a sore subject with Luna; he hadn’t been the same since his stint in Azkaban during Voldemort’s reign, constantly panicked and paranoid, a haunted look in his eyes.
Malfoy paused for a moment, before realization, and then anger dawned over his face. "That won't be necessary, Potter, I'll just be on my way--"
Harry glanced around for Malfoy's ship, wondering how he'd missed it in the initial sweep of the planet. "How'd you get here? Where's your ship?"
Suddenly, he brings his cigarette to the fabric of the curtain, causing it to catch fire. Panicked, I freeze, unable to reach for my wand by the time the flames crept up the fabric and spread to the ceiling.
The shout of his last name had Harry glancing over at the Slytherin table where the sound had come from, only to see a pale-faced Draco Malfoy rushing toward him. The whispers rose in volume. Harry's jaw tightened.
He hoped Colin was snapping pictures with his camera, assuming they had that in the Afterlife. He hoped he followed his heroes around like a shadow. Harry hoped he knew he was one, too.
But for the first time since being trapped in the dark dungeons of Malfoy Manor, Luna was running out of faith.
“Of course, I can change it if you don’t want him to, Harry,” Luna gave Potter a placid smile. “But with the way you’ve been staring at him all evening, I thought you’d be rather excited.”
Flames have an easy way of dancing, nipping at the air with scorching defiance; it's contained, yet free to thrive within its own space while it has energy, wood to fuel its life force.
The potter’s field was just as she’d left it; the graves were still identical and neatly spaced. She walked through the gate and surveyed the scene before sitting on the ground, not caring about dirtying her cloak.
, standing on wobbly legs as he licked a drop of Harry's come from his lips. Harry's cock gave an excited twitch at the sight of Malfoy's swollen mouth, flushed cheeks, and mussed hair.
Somewhere, among the graves marked by nothing by a wooden cross, lay her father’s body. But she knew her father would hate the knowledge that he would forever rest underneath the symbol of a religion to which he didn’t belong.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I think you know me well enough to know that's not what I mean. I want to help you like a normal friend would."
Sometimes, when it’s been a particularly long and stressful day of searching for you, I go and sit on that bench, just to feel your magic, to remember that you exist. The
"Merlin, no! That's not it at all, I guess I'm just...I'm confused!" Harry sighed. "I don't know...how you feel about me, I guess."
Draco let out a shuddering breath. "No," he said, his voice tight. "I'm not who he wants me to be. I'm not his son."
Harry was startled out of his reverie by the sudden announcement, as well as by Ron, who nudged him and gestured to Hermione, whose head was still bent over her desk as she wrote furiously.
It was the night before Draco was to be wed, and just a week ago had been their agreed-upon final meeting.
The air, like us, was trying to find the difference between hot and cold, with shivering mornings and sweltering afternoons. But you lend me your coat and hand me a glass of lemonade, and we're content to just feel it all.
Harry chuckled. "Come on, Draco, cooking isn't that hard. It's just like potions, which I remember you excelling at."
It rolled off Draco's tongue more easily than it should've for a boy his age. His blood raced as he felt the hatred eat away at the last glowing embers of love he had for Potter, righteous and furious.
The doors to the Great Hall opened, and Draco's head was suddenly filled with hopes of a green and silver-colored future.
Harry pursed his lips. "Nothing?" The questioning lilt of his voice betrayed the attempt at nonchalance.
"I know your job has its risks, Harry, but the least you can do is not create them for yourself. You said the Sorting Hat nearly put you in Slytherin; some self-preservation would be good for you."
He lets his wand fall loosely from his fingers and clatter to the ground, likely getting wet from the pooling water that's sure to damage the floor, but he doesn't care. He thinks he hears it clink against one of the two empty firewhiskey bottles scattered on the ground, and he doesn't care.
Harry bit his lip, considering, and then sat up. “Actually, there might be. Have you heard of Little Red?”
Potter groaned. "Merlin, I'm so sorry. I thought about you the whole time. How much I wanted to see you, or at least send you a letter."
Draco sighed, pressing his lips together as he thought. Finally, he lifted his gaze to meet Potter’s.
It’s similar to magic. Magic cannot be created, nor destroyed. It is, after all, a form of energy. You can destroy magical objects—you know that better than perhaps anyone—but the magic within cannot cease to exist.
"Anywho, it's incredibly prestigious, and it would give me the chance to experiment far beyond the bounds of Hogwarts."
Draco sat, frozen, as shock rolled throughout his body, tingling his fingers and making his head feel fuzzy.
A gentle smile settles on Draco's lips. "Yes, Harry, you can. If you want to, that is." Draco takes a deep breath, seeming to steel himself. "But you've got to decide."
But now, as he stared up at the ceiling, his new roommates sleeping soundly around him, he found himself able to calm his exhilarated mind enough to rest.
With a satisfied snort, Taygete launched back into the air, soaring freely into the endless diamond sky with a victorious flip.
Ron sighed. “That’s what the new report says, mate. But the son wasn’t there when the body was found—he’d been waiting in the truck, thank Merlin.”
They stared; not in competition, not daring the other to turn away first. They just stood there, looking at one another.
A pit of anxiety settled in Harry’s stomach as he read the story. Little Red was suspected of yet another murder; the body of a Neo Death Eater was found by Junior Aurors who happened to be patrolling at the scene. The corpse was wrapped in the same red cloak as the others had been.
After a few weeks of itching and peeling, Harry feels satisfaction curl in his chest as he examines the back of his hand.
I wish I could ask you what you believe in. I want to know what kept you going all that time, when your friends were your family, and then when you were in Azkaban. Was it faith? How do you believe in something just for the sake of it?
"First of all, are you alright? From your mission--I wouldn't put it past you to forego St. Mungo's in your haste to get here."
Miss Schegoss took the crowd's attention and Draco didn't bother to get changed before approaching Harry at his table again. Harry greeted him with a wide smile and a quick peck on the lips.
Harry gave him a small, sheepish smile. "I was waiting for the perfect opportunity. I wanted to do this at sunset, at the restaurant, looking out over the ocean on the last night of our cruise. I thought I put the box in my pocket but I left it in my suitcase and--well, you know the rest."
“You seem to have made a lot of assumptions about how I might spend my future, Potter. I’m neither dependent on my inheritance nor a power broker. Are there any other aspects of my life that you’d ‘always imagined’ for me which I can dispel?”
Don't act surprised; it isn't as if you were unaware of my gaze--as if you didn't seek it out. Seek out my praise, my love, my approval. They were all one and the same.
It was all too satisfying to watch the ropes wrap around Malfoy Sr., seeing him struggle against the binds and scowl.
“The only one I can really think of is Pettigrew, but he’s dead. And that Bellatrix story seems so obviously fake in retrospect—she was obsessed with Riddle. Like...I wouldn’t be surprised if the two of them…” Harry trailed off and gave Ron a pointed look.
In the three years he'd spent wandering through the country, he hadn't allowed the thought to occur to him that he'd want something else. So caught up he'd been with rejecting responsibility that he hadn't stopped to consider whether he might want it back.
Potter shrugged. “I realized I’ve basically been doing Auror work since I was 11. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in that kind of danger.”
"NO!" Hurt flashed across Draco's face for a moment before he schooled his features once more. Harry closed his eyes.
He ran a hand over his neck, shuddering as he fingered the scars left by Draco's teeth, his favorite of the permanent marks that marred his flesh.
The Cause of Draco’s Early Demise was dressed in a forest green button-down shirt that stretched across a broad, muscled chest and was tucked into fitted black trousers.
"Fucking Draco." He mumbled into his glass before letting the amber liquid burn the back of his throat, just to feel something there other than the telltale lump that always preceded tears.
Harry closed his eyes and thought about a future of gray eyes, slow kisses, and a lifetime of surprises.
It was unsustainable. They'd both known it, but they were too caught up in the excitement, the intoxication of releasing years of pent-up tension. Draco would often ask himself—as he watched Harry's bare back rise and fall with slow, sleep-heavy breaths—if it was worth it; the inevitable pain. And when he was alone in his flat, accompanied by a bottle of wine and his favorite takeaway, it was.
Draco closed his eyes and thumped his head back against the headboard. Of course. He'd finally had Potter in his bed, after years of fantasies and pining, and he couldn't remember any of it.
Too soon, Potter directed Taygete to land back where they'd started behind the greenhouses. Potter slid off first, wordlessly holding out his arms to catch Draco as he slid off Taygete's back. Warm, strong hands gripped Draco's waist and let his feet gently touch the ground.
Narcissa didn't cry when, many years later, when Lucius's breathing grew labored, his heart probably shriveled from Dark magic's aging qualities. She was stroking his hair for the first time in decades as he took his last breath, his pale eyes glassy and fearful.
"Yeah," Harry let out a humorless, breathy chuckle. "She figured it out, I think. She said to tell you that she's having her parents terminate the contract."
You've given up on the pretense of not staring at him. The sun is setting, and that means he'll soon be yours.
"On my count," Harry aimed his gun at the ghost, which was darting back and forth in the Ministry entryway. "One, two, three—now!"
When they finished applying their makeup and setting it, they reached over and put their wig in a secure travel bag, ensuring that it would be safe during Apparation. They stepped into their outfit for the evening–a simple black dress–and cast a protection spell on it to keep it from any stains or damage.
Draco closed his eyes, letting his head thud against the headboard and then instantly regretting it, gritting his teeth against the sharp pain. "Great. I bet Mother's furious."
The sight of Potter choking on air, his face red and eyes wide, was too perfect for Draco to maintain his composure. He lasted about five seconds before laughing while Potter had a small coughing fit to recover from his shock.
His mouth twisted into a wry grin; gone was the goofy, easy smile Draco'd resented from their youth. In its place was this amused grimace that filled its targets with dread.
Draco'd furrowed his eyebrows but nodded in understanding. He'd stepped into the fireplace with a pinch of powder and was gone, wrapped in green flames.
At first, receiving the Dark Lord’s task had been an honor. Mother and Aunt Bella were constantly reminding him of his role in restoring the Malfoy name, now that Father was disgraced, and Draco had swelled with pride.
"C'mon! It's coming!" Harry called behind him as he ran up the steps of the Ministry building. The crowd was screaming in terror as it swarmed in its escape out of the building, but he pushed through the mob to make his way up to the top.
Weasley glared at him. “Shut up, Malfoy. We didn’t see you, or we wouldn’t have come any closer in case being a prat is contagious.”
He’d successfully avoided these gatherings thus far, wanting to avoid the possible pitfalls of being drunk in front of Gryffindors who didn’t owe him anything. And while it was perfectly fine for Pansy and Blaise and Millicent to rub intoxicated elbows with war heroes, Draco preferred for his interactions with other houses to be carefully orchestrated and without error.
Draco reached up to kiss Harry properly on the lips. "I know, Harry," he said when they pulled apart. "I have you, and I have Teddy. I'd follow you both to the ends of the earth."
Harry bit his lip. "Draco, I'm sorry I don't like whipped cream. I'm sorry I forget to do laundry, and that I dragged you to Sunday dinner. I'm sorry that I worry you sometimes because my job is dangerous. I'm sorry I run late to our dates sometimes.
Narcissa let her gaze go hazy and blurred, even as smoke nibbled at her eyes. Finally, she blinked and raised her wand to
He had half a mind to turn around on the spot and go back to his cozy apartment where he could convince himself it was merely a hallucination. Honestly, he still could; Potter hadn’t seen him. If he just—
Narcissa liked to let her eyes go unfocused as she gazed longingly at the fireplace. Her mind was numb, hands folded neatly and heavily in her lap. Sometimes, when Lucius was asleep in the chair next to hers, she would let her lips part mindlessly and her limbs relaxed, like an antique marionette.
“But I still don’t understand—why did she target former Death Eaters?” Ron’s confusion was clear on his face.
Draco jumped and turned to Harry with wild, startled eyes that made Harry laugh, and then wince in pain.
They'd taken extra time to tuck tonight since their black bodysuit left little to the imagination. They knew their legs looked particularly long and enticing in fishnets, and the bodysuit was sinched at the waist by their favorite lacy black corset. Their hair was charmed long tonight, straight shocking white blonde down to their waist. Their red lipstick matched their heels. All in all, they knew they looked good enough to eat.
Harry checked his watch with a lopsided grin. “30 seconds, as promised. That’s how I wanted to kiss you back before you left.”
No, Harry would endure almost any physical discomfort if it meant Draco would keep talking until he was out of breath. Until he ran out of words.
All sense of time, noise, and sight dissolved as his body and mind narrowed with the singular goal of wringing himself of all the tears he'd been forced to suppress. Even the voice of his father in his head calling him
Anyway, Draco, I want you to imagine yourself at 26. You wear your hair loose and without that horrid gel that you used for so long, and it's short, unlike Father's. You're healthy, now, eating actual meals instead of subsisting on apples and fear. You don't have dark circles under your eyes, and you smile more—genuine smiles; they aren't the weakness that Father said they were. There's power in happiness.
. I wonder if your eyes have faded or your skin is wrinkled with age, or if you, too, are immune to the debris of time, waiting for me.
Potter turned to him with raised eyebrows. Draco flushed and let go of his arm, relieved when Potter didn’t keep walking.
Harry blinked. He felt his mind shift, the artificial haze fading to leave a dull ache; still, he felt the relief of clarity and reality settle in his chest.
He didn't believe it at the time. How could anyone care more for someone else than for themself? His father certainly hadn't. What if he wasn't any better? What if—
Luna turned to look at him, pride shining in her eyes. “Thank you, Dad, really—” she paused to remove the scarlet cloak from around her shoulders, letting her fingers linger over the fabric. “But I’m the lucky one.”
Kingsley shook his head. “It was a false confession. We even questioned Bellatrix under Veritaserum; we have reason to believe she was Imperiused to confess to crimes she didn’t commit.”
I've studied you all my life. I practiced in the mirror, trying to see your features in mine. I tried to emulate the way you walk, the way you speak, the way you think. I wanted to live in the world you created for me — I was grateful for it — because you were the smartest person in my life. You knew better, and you knew more.
Draco’s eyes trailed down the length of Harry’s body, making him resist the urge to squirm under the scrutiny. Elegant features twisted into a grimace, complete with a curled lip. “Is that any way to greet a guest, Potter?”
Harry's jaw tightened, the hand holding his outstretched wand trembling slightly. "You don't have to do this."
Draco shook himself. "Right, sorry." He hissed when he caught sight of the gash along Potter's side, poorly healed as predicted. Draco cast the appropriate charms and Summoned a potion from his stores. After Potter chugged it without question, his immediate trust doing funny things to Draco's insides, the gash was healed.
I don't know what I believe. Maybe religion would take some of the weight off my chest, give my heart some relief, but I don't like the idea of blind faith; I lived too much of my life throwing myself into danger and not always worrying about whether I'd die, and I don't know if I'll get the choice to come back next time.
Relief wrapped around Harry's heart like a warm blanket. "We'll see about that," his mouth stretched into a grin, cracking his slightly chapped lips. Draco's look of fond exasperation was worth it.
When the show ended, Draco and Cori sat at their mirror while Cori applied powders and liquids he'd looked at with curiosity on his mother's vanity. While Cori didn't let him look in the mirror until they were finished, he loved the sensation of the brush against his skin and felt himself transform into something new, yet familiar. As if something had been living dormant in his skin, just waiting to be revealed.
Now was the fun part. And from the moment a makeup brush touched Draco’s face, they became Tarasque.
"Me?!" Harry's body filled with white-hot indignation."I'm not the one who has explaining to do." He slammed the paper on the desk, making the furniture shake slightly.
Harry ran inside, letter in hand, to find Ron and Hermione. There'd need to be one more step in their plan.
At first, I thought it was Lucius, and that he’d come here to reunite with his old friend. But the man turned his head and I saw the same look of fear in his eyes that I saw in yours.
The glass shattered against the wall with a satisfying crack. Adrenaline coursed through Harry’s veins as he picked up a china plate and let it slip through his fingers and clatter to the floor, breaking into pieces. The rush was almost intoxicating, thrilling him to destroy it all. Make the cupboard empty, make it not crowded, not cramped, not full of things more breakable than him, things more precious and valuable, things more important than him—
Harry had always brought out Draco’s emotions in their strongest, most concentrated form. In his youth, the jealousy, resentment, and anger were acidic on his tongue; he’d spit them into the force of his words, hoping Harry could feel it, too. Now, the love and exasperated fondness he held for Harry melted in his mouth like his favorite decadent dark chocolate: rich and satisfyingly bittersweet; he wondered if Harry could taste it on his tongue.
Still, Harry thought that sitting on his back porch with a glass of wine at night and seeing the glittering sky was a sufficient substitute. The lights of London weren’t able to dull the stars all the way out here, but even the suburbs had lampposts.
Draco groaned, forcing his aching body to sit up in his bed. He pressed a hand to soothe his pounding head and rub his eyes, scowling when he saw residual thick, dark eyeliner staining his fingers.
When he lept down from Hagrid's arms, he heard a brief shout of "Potter!!" before a wand was tossed in his direction. He plucked the Hawthorne wand from the air, sparing only a passing thought to regret that he hadn't seen the mysterious helper. The thought left his mind as he faced Voldemort, exhilaration rushing through him as he taunted Riddle by revealing how he'd been helped by Snape all along and had won control of the Elder Wand from a nameless, faceless Death Eater. Riddle cast, he cast, and after the lights from the two wands intersected, it was over.
Harry sighed and bent down, taking Draco in his arms and nearly stumbling when the blond let his body weight fall into him.
“Draco, we’ve been doing…whatever this is for a couple of months now. When have you known me to sneak out in the middle of the night?”
Draco let out a high, keening whine and burrowed himself further into the couch. “Don’ wanna. Tired. Stay here.”
Draco steadied himself, trying to grasp at the copper-colored scales for some sort of leverage. Potter chuckled, looking over his shoulder at Draco.
Tell me, so my future child knows how to distinguish love and fear. So I don't become a real ghost. So my feet and body can take up space without shame or terror or consequences.
"Harry, I--" Draco turned around but was startled into silence at the sight of Harry on his knee, a hopeful smile on his face and a small black box in his hand.
Reluctantly, Draco moved further up onto the bed, letting himself be wrapped in Potter’s strong arms.
. It was artfully tousled, rather than shaggy and messy, but it was still long enough to nearly reach his eyes without obscuring his vision or bottle-green eyes. Judging by the wolf-whistles and scattered applause, it seemed their peers agreed, and Potter’s nonchalance was betrayed by the blush coloring his cheeks.
Harry didn’t bother to clamp down the scream that rose up in his throat at the blinding pain. The spell ended, and he fell to his knees, panting and ignoring the titters from the surrounding Death Eaters.
You're adorable when you're surprised, you know. Your cheeks get pink and your lips part a bit, but my favorite part is how wide your eyes get because for a moment I can see every emotion dancing within them.
"Mr. Potter, to what do we owe the pleasure?" Narcissa Malfoy looks a little older through the green flames of the Floo.
Draco nodded. "I'll get him if he cries, so you can sleep. We have a long day of driving tomorrow, don't we?"
“It’s a party game. You take turns saying three statements. Two of them are true and one of them is a lie, and the other players have to guess which is a lie.”
But in the end, the rumors and conjecture were as outlandish as the creatures whose existence they denied. People believe and see what they want to, she’d learned, and if they chose not to see her, then who better than her to change the real world of which they were selfishly blind?
Gods, the opening feast. He scowled, stomach twisting as he recalled the evening that should have been only celebratory but was turned into humiliation by that Potter boy. How dare he reject him?
“What is the meaning of this?” Parchment crinkles in his tight fist. With his other hand, he brings a lit cigarette to his lips, letting the smoke curl in the air; mother must be out of the house.
He ignored Hermione’s knowing gaze and Ron’s eye roll as he unabashedly stared daggers at the bloke practically groping Draco at the bar. Harry saw Draco’s eyes widen imperceptibly, noticed his smile falter and his cheekbone twitch.
Relief washed over him, and tears sprung behind his eyes for the first time since he’d sobbed in his mother’s arms when the war finally ended. Now, he blinked to focus on scanning the room until he landed on Potter.
Draco took off his reading glasses, rubbing absentmindedly over the bridge of his nose. “So, remind me again. Who have been the victims so far?”
He helped Malfoy undo his zipper and push down his trousers and pants, freeing his cock to bob eagerly in the air.
Harry wanted nothing more than to shoot across the sky, cut through the smog of the big city and drag Draco with him, numbering every star they passed along the way.
I wish I could offer a stroll or a shopping trip through Diagon the next day, but we both know I can't, I won't. The kind ones stare, the bolder ones glare or hiss accusingly, and the angry ones waggle their fingers and shout and slap.
Harry's hands shook, whether from rage or the shock of his heart breaking in real time, he didn't know.
And I promise to do all of this for as long as I can, as long as you let me. And if you do--if you promise to love me for the rest of our lives--I promise to do the same. Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?"
“Okay, let’s start off easy. I’m an Auror. I live in Grimmauld Place. And I went to Romania for six months after eighth year.”
With a growl, he moved toward the window and opened it to chastize whatever teenagers thought themselves comedians by pelting his window with snowballs.
I don't know how long it's been since you left. It's been some amount of seconds, minutes, and hours. I can't count time anymore. I stopped trying.
They kissed and kissed and kissed, with Draco coaxing little grunts from Potter with every pull of his hair and swipe of his tongue. He didn’t care about the whispering from the other students, or Pany’s peal of laughter, or Granger’s knowing stare at his back.
He opens his eyes. The grave of Albus Dumbledore still manages to be grand and imposing against the gray clouds and flashing lightning.
He wondered what Astoria would say if she could see him now. If their current level of communication as soon-to-be-weds was any indication, their marriage contract was more of a business venture than a romantic one.
Harry was already up and out of his seat, taking out his wand as he moved to Draco’s side. “Let’s go. I’ll side-along to the front yard so we can figure out the best way inside.”
She sat for a moment more and then stood, wiping her cheeks. She turned and walked out of the graveyard, wrapping her cloak tight around her shoulders.
Still, even Harry's brilliant smile wasn't enough to distract from the obvious slight anticipation in Harry's deep green eyes.
And those nights became less frequent. Less intense, less and less and less until eventually, Draco’s chest rose and fell each night in peaceful slumber.
You don’t have to have read Fog or Wish for this to make sense, but here is the fluffy epilogue to Harry and Draco’s storyline! Enjoy.
Harry shrugged. "We don't have a choice, do we? You don't have a license--and why would you? Besides, you're great at looking after Teddy in the car. This set-up works, and it's for one more day."
Harry scoffed. His breath fogged in the air. "I told you this was happening today. It's not my fault you weren't listening."
Harry placed a firm hand on Malfoy's shoulder, making direct eye contact but saying nothing as he gave the other man a chance to back out, to step away before they went any further. Nerves filled his stomach for the first time since he’d spotted Malfoy across the club, and the sight of his hand boldly clasping Malfoy’s shoulder in a silent request brought the gravity of the moment to the forefront of his mind.
“I certainly do not,” Draco scoffed. “Romantic would’ve been if you had the good sense to kiss me back, you git.”
Suddenly, startled at the abrupt sound of chattering students exiting classrooms, he exhaled, deflating himself. The raindrops were heavy against his eyelids as he opened them to cast a
Harry thought about this. The way Draco brings home treacle tart and leaves it in the refrigerator for Harry. The way he silently, wordlessly draws a bath for him when it's clear Harry's had a long day. The way he factors in twice-monthly dinners with Ron and Hermione and Sunday dinner at the Burrow, despite his discomfort. The way he gets up before Harry every day to get the Prophet and throw away every article with his name in the headline or his picture in the columns.
He considered his options. This was Lovegood, after all. She wasn’t the type to make him do anything that would put him in physical danger. More likely, she’d make him go look for nargles in the morning, or something. But if he chose truth...who knew the kind of question she’d ask him to reveal?
His twin stumbled as the light dissipated, taking off his glasses to rub them on his fresh robes before placing them back on his nose.
Your hands on my hips, the stars winking in approval above our heads, swaying to the rhythm of our beating hearts.
Draco cleared his throat. “No thanks, Granger, I’m afraid I’ve too much work this evening. I’m sure you, of all people, understand that.”
be the central source on the topic. They spun their theories and tales. They’d never accuse her—sweet, innocent Luna—of taking justice into her own hands.
Voldemort glared—or he would’ve if his eyes weren’t already snake-like slits. “And see, here I thought you might want to spend your final moments playing a little game.”
Until I find out, I'm going to believe in Draco, and Ron, and Hermione. I'm going to believe in what I can control. And I'm going to ask Luna more about what she believes because I think she might be onto something.
Smiling, she reached into her pocket and activated the Portkey, closing her eyes against the twisting world around her.
Draco glanced down at the Dark Mark on his arm and wondered why he still dreamed of what he knew he didn’t deserve.
Draco's chuckle was rich and gave Harry pleasant goosebumps. "I promise you've been here before. Surely you know by the air around us that we're outside, at least."
She sat for a moment more and then stood, wiping her cheeks. She turned and walked out of the graveyard, wrapping her cloak tight around her shoulders.
He hides these two scars well, with carefully-placed fringe and high-collared shirts. He's come to accept the marks that Death has left on his skin, like eternal IOUs.
They don't know many of the details of that fateful night. As they sorted through the wreckage, Aurors found his diary by the bed, the words slightly smudged in some places from long-dried tears.
. Lyssa, thank you for your encouragement, beta skills, brainstorming help, and support. Everyone, go check out her Tumblr. She's crazy talented.
Ron snorted. “Yeah, ‘m not sure why the Prophet finds out about these murders before the Aurors; it’s embarrassing. Anything in the Quibbler?”
But with Harry, the heat wasn’t so sweltering, the world wasn’t as suffocating, the darkness wasn’t so foreboding.
Draco closes his eyes. "I can't love him, you know. And he can't love me. And I can't pretend for him. I refuse to pretend any longer to be something I'm not."
Harry clenched his jaw, ignoring the worried expression on Hermione's face and the stormy one on Ron's, turning to Malfoy with a dark glare. "You bumped into me, and you know it."
From this angle, Harry could see people who hadn’t been visible from the entrance and his heart stuttered in his chest when he caught a flash of white-blonde hair.
and struggled to rise back to his feet. His hat had fallen off his head during the fall, now sitting just a couple feet from his trapped body.
He tensed at the sound of the door opening behind him, but he didn't turn around, hoping that the person would see him and leave him to his misery.
“She’ll still be tried for those as planned, but Little Red’s have been expunged from her record. Besides, we have bigger problems now.”
Malfoy nodded again. He took the wand from Harry’s hand, closing his eyes. Harry let in a sharp breath at the sight of a soft smile on Malfoy's lips as he reunited with his wand. The image was more compelling than Harry imagined, as evidenced by the butterflies that filled his stomach.
Draco reached into the bag and cast a few charms on a small object, enlarging it to its regular size; Harry recognized it as a wicker basket.
A few minutes later, the other customer had handed the woman some coins and walked out of the stop. Harry hadn't noticed; he was preoccupied with staring at the self-playing harp in the corner of the room.
"Are you sure? I don't want to--you shouldn't have to comfort me about this, about him. You, of all people,
Harry hadn't thought to bring anything else when he'd left England three years ago; well, not the car, that'd been a new addition when he'd arrived in America with his other belongings.
He nodded his thanks at Lyssa, who turned to look in the main dining room. Relieved to have a moment to himself, he ran a hand over his face and closed his eyes. He could do this. He could have dinner with Potter. He would not let himself be flustered.
Harry grins. He walks up to Draco and takes a smooth hand in his own. A sense of deja vu washes over him, the sensation welcome and warm.
Potter’s smile shook him from his thoughts. “Prat. I meant that you were right—Ginny’d have been shocked. I think she’d have liked it, in the end, but that is not what I thought it was.”
Harry lay on the floor of the Forest, trying with all his effort to stay completely still. Voldemort and the other Death Eaters were too caught up in their victory to confirm his death, but any slight movement right now could throw his chances.
Malfoy licked his lips and looked up at Harry through his lashes before wrapping his mouth around his cock.
Draco pursed his lips, swirling the wine in his glass and taking a sip as he considered the answer. “You don’t actually live in Grimmauld Place?”
I think you know what it’s like, to be underestimated. Overlooked. Even mocked. I can relate. Perhaps we are more alike than we think, Little Red.
“Perhaps spending a little time in the cellar would jog your memory, hm? Don’t worry; there aren’t too many rats down there. I should know,” Luna thrilled at Lucius’s grimace.
He glanced up at the full moon shining in approval, letting the wind blow back his hair. He looked at Harry's messy head with fondness; the high-speed winds certainly wouldn't do that hair any favors.
Harry would endure almost any physical discomfort if it meant Draco would keep talking until he was out of breath. Until he ran out of words.
Malfoy was right in front of Harry's face now. There were flecks of blue in the grey eyes. "Talk about distracting! I can't walk down the same corridor as you without walking into you with how much I'm staring!"
They all chucked. "Thank you, dear," Cori gave him a knowing look before tilting their head in thought. "You know," they said with pursed lips. "You'd look just
Draco tossed and turned with a frown, eventually pulling the drapes closed around his bed to shield himself from the world for a few hours more.
He settled into the familiar corner booth, deliberately taking the seat that faced out toward the other diners; let himself have varied visual distractions while simultaneously being the most interesting sight in Potter’s view.
Luna took the Portkey from her pocket, wrapping her cloak tighter around herself as she was pulled away. She disappeared as thunder signaled a downpour of rain from the sky.
It sat openly on His chest, an almost exact replica, but where the original had been gold, this was a startling, strange silver.
"There you are, Harry, just keep following my lead. Yes alright you can look at our feet for now, but eventually you'll have to keep eyecontact."
But Potter was the first friend Draco’d tried to make on his own, without the convenience of a pre-established, generations-long social alliance, and the rejection had stung more than he cared to admit.
I would thank you for taking time out of your busy Savior Funeral Victory Tour schedule to attend mine, but it was the perfect opportunity to sneak in your bloody post-war agenda. That must have been satisfying—preaching about second chances and redemption next to the casket of the boy you hated to his dying day.
Draco was about to narrow his eyes and tell Potter that he hadn’t exactly predicted this future for himself, either, when their server returned with the bottle of wine and two glasses. As the server poured the wine, Draco’s brain stuttered.
He spread out his arms and legs, weaving his fingers through the blades of grass. He wondered if he, too, could sink into the earth and intertwine himself with the roots; perhaps they, fibrous and thin yet enduring, could wrap around his veins and grow to his heart to raise the weight from his chest.
Still, the area had its charms, but to find them you had to go beyond the merry-go-round and the restaurants, and stroll through the suburban haven that was Brooklyn Heights.
It was his own damn fault, too. Draco'd made it explicitly clear at the beginning of their little...liaison that it could never go further, never be more. It was simply a way for Draco to blow off steam and stay within Pureblood social customs. While he and Astoria were betrothed, it was accepted for their pre-marital affairs to be an open secret until the rings were exchanged and vows said.
Draco watched as the queens performed one by one over the course of the night, his leg bouncing in anticipation. He was mesmerized as they captured the crowd's attention, dancing and lipsynching to the songs with practiced ease.
Harry approached him slowly, like a skittish wild animal. His arms trapped Draco in a tight embrace, and Draco let himself be captured.
“So when this is all over, don’t come crying to me with your regrets and your pleading for my help. Remember this after the war, when no one else would’ve advocated for you, saved you. You’re the enemy.”
The Weasel stopped talking as he and Potter approached Draco’s bench. Draco turned to scowl at them.
It's a shadow of its former self, the disapproving sneer that had crossed Father's face as Draco left for the evening. He wasn't sure whether it was the eyeliner, tight black jeans, or crop top that was stoking his Father's disgusted ire this time.
The students stood, gathering their materials into their bags. At the desk in front of Draco, the Weasel was rambling about some nonsense that caused Potter to laugh, revealing one of his dimples. It made Draco’s stomach flip in ways he had learned to actively ignore over the past three years.
, it is--and it would be even better if you let me finish my bloody sentence," Draco scowled half-heartedly.
Harry, you made a rebel out of me. I never thought I'd be making love proclamations and ending wedding contracts and willingly standing in the middle of the rain but nothing with you has ever made sense but it's always felt right. You're mine. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me and I refuse to do anything but love you, forever."
he'd whispered to Ginny as they pulled away from their first kiss after the war. His hands slid off her soft hips and her hands untangled from his hair. She looked suspicious,
They pushed through the crowded streets of the theater district, careful not to bump into wandering tourists and rushing locals who moved to escape the teeming horde.
Next, they picked up their favorite liquid contour, but they used it lightly. The first time they’d contoured their face, Cori’d laughed so hard they had tears in their eyes.
Harry scowled. "Seeing as I had more to forgive than almost anyone, it's pretty self-righteous of them to think they're above it all."
"It's where your blood traitor father and mudblood mother took their last breaths to save you. Gods, they must've regretted it when they saw how you turned out. They should've handed you over to the Dark Lord when they had the chance."
"He's perfect," Harry breathed, gently stroking Scorpius's head. The baby turned his piercing eyes on Harry and giggled, and Draco wanted to bottle this moment—the sound, the smile, the tears in his and Harry's eyes, the joyful ache of his chest—for eternity.
Ron glared. “Shut up, Malfoy. We didn’t see you, or we wouldn’t have come any closer in case being a prat is contagious.”
Snow continued to fall in the clearing, covering up a trail of fresh paw prints that disappeared into the thick forest.
Ron gave Malfoy one last glare before he let Harry steer him away from Malfoy, who widened his smirk in satisfaction. They walked away, Ron continuing his rant as they made their way to Gryffindor Tower. Harry looked over his shoulder, catching one more glimpse of Malfoy basking in the sunshine.
"Darling, we think it's possible we've caught Harry Potter, but we want to be certain it's him before we call the Dark Lord. Could you identify him if you saw him?"
Draco didn't look at the way hurt and shock were written on the other man's face; he already knew every expression, every twitch of an eyebrow, every quirk of those lips, and what they all meant.
And he's also a "sappy sod," and a "fucking tease" and "my fiancé" and "the future father of our children, so you better not die today, Potter!"
After the war, everyone had been surprised to see Harry smiling--all the time. Most people chalked it up to relief at having finally killed Voldemort, but some others took his apparent joy for apathy toward those who'd lost their lives in the war.
Draco sighed. “Well, there are a few others with similar rank to the victims, like Macnair, Rowle, or Yaxley.”
After this, his moment of seizing the closure that Potter's stupid bet had necessitated in the first place, he would move on.
Harry didn't need to be told twice. He grabbed Malfoy's hips and spun him around, bringing Malfoy’s arse against his crotch and his back against his own chest.
"At least Dumbledore isn't trying to commit genocide! Voldemort has killed and will kill again, and you know it."
"Whether or not you're going to tell me why you actually called. You must have better things to do in Kyoto than talk to me."
Harry jumped, his head jerking up to see Draco looking at him blankly, which made Harry's stomach twist with guilt. Draco made his face unreadable when he was internally panicked.
Draco slumped against the sink, the tears now racking his body in convulsive sobs. He shook with the effort not to hyperventilate, but the dam broke within him, releasing months' worth of fear, desperation, and self-hatred.
Potter sputtered, nearly spitting his wine out of his mouth before he swallowed and started to cough.
'Oh, he's so devoted to you, Harry,' their voices saccharine, practically dripping with it. 'He just speaks so highly of you, so very smitten. You must be so happy together.'
Despite the light blush that colored his cheeks, he felt affection warm his chest; with her short brown hair and quick instincts, Lyssa reminded Draco a bit of Pansy every time he saw her.
"I'm sorry for shouting, Draco, I just--" He looked out the window, his heart sinking when he saw the darkened sky outside.
After all, as long as he had a pulse, sperm for insemination, and a sound enough mind to sign over half his vaults, he'd have done his duty as her future husband as far as she was concerned.
"I'm fine," Draco's voice was rough from crying, and he was sure his tear-stained cheeks and red eyes undermined his attempt at nonchalance.
Draco focused on the champagne that slid easily down his throat. Next to him, Astoria quirked an eyebrow, her small smile both amused and questioning. He set down the glass and reached over to squeeze her hand once, allowing her to return the gesture before pulling back.
Potter pressed his lips together. "Well, the way I see it, we have two choices. The first is, I can go and leave you to your Sunday morning. Or--" Potter looked away. "We could get up, I can make us breakfast, and I can get to know you better."
I am mostly unbothered here, in my ghostly scene; waitstaff and customers look at me and through me and hope to avoid my fate; little do they know that heartbreak is as certain as death, and they will join me in this lonely cemetery. For a broken heart will beat; I still live day after terrible day.
My room is my only haven from this war; I don't recognize the rest of my own home anymore. He's taken it over. Even Father's clearly distressed, and while Mother is the most blank-faced of us all, I can see the glimmer of resentment, of anger in her eyes. Toward Father, toward the Dark Lord, toward the war. I can't say I blame her.
Draco clenched his jaw and looked away. "Happiness is easier to manage when it's artificial. I ran away from the only thing that ever brought me close to real happiness. I can't handle it."
She felt another remnant of her naivety crumble into dust within her heart, something pure now tainted. Good; no longer would her idealism be her blindspot.
Given such license, Harry’s mind sure felt it had a lot of catching up to do; it brought images of blonde hair shining in the moonlight, gray eyes that held mirth instead of cruelty, cool, long nimble fingers wrapped around his own calloused ones as he lead the attached body into the crisp air.
Draco stood near the hostess stand, smiling indulgently at the woman behind it. She grinned in response.
You deserve more. Your tea should be made by soft, uncalloused hands. Your bed should be warmed by people with kind eyes and clear hearts. Your flat should be full of your family and friends, brimming with love.
I hadn't planned on it at first, but I've been doing songfic prompts on Tumblr and the number for this song was requested.
But first, it was time to indulge every Hufflepuffish instinct in his body, purging the emotion from his heart and wringing it of pain until it was shriveled in his chest.
His face looked back at him in the mirror; he saw the same familiar collection of features. His father's hair and face, and his mother's eyes; none of it his own.
Harry grinned and rose from his knee to pull Draco into a nearly bruising kiss. When they pulled apart, they pressed their foreheads together and looked as Harry slid the ring, a simple silver band with tiny emeralds, onto Draco's finger.
"You set up wards on Kuragin? But Truiepets hasn't made a proper claim yet! You can't land on an empty planet and call it yours! That's a violation of intergalactic law!"
So there Draco was, trudging through Knockturn Alley and avoiding the curious stares of those passing by him. It was getting dark, the western sun setting in the distance. He shivered against the biting, frigid air. He felt a rush of gratitude toward Pansy for letting him stay in her flat while he got back on his feet. He knew his mother, who'd come to her senses and left his father for a townhouse in France, would gladly take him in, but he knew if he left London he'd never gather the strength to return.
You didn't choose the scars on your chest, nor the Mark on your arm, but the fact that you trust me with your body, with your heart, is something I will cherish forever.
Draco's chest seized, sharp with regret. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "I thought it was what's best for both of us, I—"
(If anyone cares about why I wrote this chapter, I was prompted summer, day in the life, and NYC, on Tumblr, and those three were practically made for this universe because Fog literally takes place in the summer in NYC.)
"Water," he rasped, and Draco immediately reached onto a nearby table and placed a glass of water into Harry's free, shaking hand. It was probably from a sink in the hospital bathroom, but it was still one of the best cups of water he'd ever had, a cool relief sliding easily down his throat.
“Now that you mention it, your having a pet snake would not surprise me in the least. The way you asked questions of the server last night tells me you know your way around a kitchen. So that leaves the last statement as the most likely lie—which means…” Draco trailed off, his throat suddenly dry.
"What, nothing? No defense, no denial? At least you're not lying to us--again." Bellatrix was snarling now.
A knock at the door disrupted Draco's thoughts just as he was picking up his book. He frowned, a little miffed. He'd just been getting to the good part, where the two boys were about to drive off into the sunset together. He couldn't be arsed to take off his reading glasses when he answered the door.
Luna had spent too much time convincing herself that the world didn’t need to believe in the magic she saw. It was their loss.
He stood over Potter and saw green eyes grow wet. He wondered if Potter's tears were a sweet relief.
I've gone somewhere too small and nameless for a map, yet just big enough for me to carve out my own little corner of the world, in the shadows where I belong. Anonymity is my friend, finally, after shouldering the burden of my surname.
"Okay," Harry said, his back now to Draco as he looked in the refrigerator. "Now we let it cook for about ten minutes. In the meantime, we have to consider the sauce. We can do marinara, pesto, or just put parmesan on it, really. I like it best with just garlic and parmesan, but you--"
He rose to his feet on slightly wobbly legs—from the firewhiskey and absolutely nothing to do with the way his stomach was churning with nerves—and moved to kneel behind Potter. The other boy was stiff, his back muscles tight with tension even through his t-shirt. Draco wondered whether Potter could use a back massage as well—
It was quiet, simple. He went to work as a potions master and came home to his flat, where he made dinner and read a book while he ate. Then he was in bed by 10 p.m. and asleep by 11.
A journal, a calendar, a pen, a wallet, his wand, a duffel bag of clothes and toiletries, and his 1999 Audi A4.
Harry snarled, his mouth twisting into a fierce scowl. He pointed his wand at Malfoy's neck, and the other man's eyes widened, his mouth twitching into a relieved smile.
They pulled away to breathe, and Draco's eyes were bright, his lips swollen and well kissed. Harry's need for oxygen was all that stopped him from leaning in again.
Voldemort, often, called him by his first and last name. "Harry Potter," he'd say in his soft, almost hissing voice. Because with Voldemort, he was neither Harry nor Potter--he was Harry Potter. He was the enemy. The target. The child who wouldn't die at his hand, no matter how many times he tried.
He was proud of himself, really, for holding out so long without risking their friendship and pouncing on the other boy with Gryffindorish reckless abandon. It was his fear of losing Draco after only just moving from awkward acquaintances to genuine friends that kept his impulsivity in check. That held him back from seeing if Draco's lips were really as soft as they looked.
"Well, you'll have to think of a name for your drag persona. Of course, you can use your real name if you want, some people do that."
Harry clenched his jaw, his just-shed invisibility cloak dirtied on the forest floor. He ignored the Death Eaters surrounding Voldemort, instead staring at the man head-on.
Draco’s father would likely think it was rather gauche to still have the Christmas lights up after New Years, but then again he probably would leave them up all year-round if it meant Draco didn’t dress in a wig, dress and heels every night.
"Potter, I am a potions master. That requires extensive medical training and knowledge. If you won't go to the hospital, at least let me look at it."
"Potter, I--" Malfoy stopped for a moment. "I'm sorry. For everything. I know that doesn't make up for--what I did, but I hope maybe I can show you that I've changed over the summer."
Your smile is warmer than any sun, your kiss more cleansing than the rain, your touch chilling me more than deep winter snow.
Draco gave him a soft smile. "You've been reliving our memories over and over for ten years, love. You cast a spell on the Pensieve to pull all of you in here and to keep yourself in here until you caught up to where you left off. "
“But, mate, if it’s not some bitter former Death Eater, do you think it’s just someone who wants justice?”
Harry didn’t think about Draco; he tried not to, anyway, but on nights like these, when the silence is too loud, he can’t help but let his thoughts roam free.
Harry pitied the living; he pitied those who feared the bliss of a bite, the thrill of being the prey; and now he pitied himself.
She stood outside the manor's gates, watching smoke and fire consume the house. The flames bit at the humid evening air, cracking with glee at being uninhibited with several floors-worth of kindling.
“So—let me get this straight. In the, what, twelve hours since we’ve had this case, Little Red has not only murdered another neo Death Eater, but they’ve wrapped him in a red cloak and dumped him into a river? And he was found by a father and son who’d gone fishing?”
"I'll show you staring," Harry said, his eyes on Malfoy's lips. Quickly, he grabbed the front of Malfoy's robes and smashed their mouths together. Malfoy adapted quickly, wrapping his arms around Harry's neck to deepen the kiss.
It’s over too soon, and later I’m watching the slow rise and fall of his chest as he sleeps. The judgmental moonlight glares accusingly at me through the window, but I pay it little mind. There’s privilege in having a natural shine. They would know, the moon and Harry.
Cool wind kissed his skin as he and Potter flew out of the Room and into the outside air. They landed on the ground with a thud, tumbling off of the broom, followed shortly thereafter by Greg and Weasley. Potter managed to stand first, dusting off his clothes and
He lifted his wand and looked down at himself with a feral grin. "See you in a century, Harry," he said, lifting his wand and watching as the dirt poured over the body, trapping it beneath the earth.
Harry frowned. But before he could voice his pondering over why Malfoy'd all but sprinted from the classroom, Hermione had finally snapped out of her note-taking daze and joined Harry and Ron.
Harry looked at him for a moment before a lovely, friendly voice seemed to whisper in his ear, "Go for it. Shake his hand. You won't regret it."
He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, wincing as a sharp pain exploded in his side with the effort. Memories came rushing back: the raid, turning his back for a split second to shout something at Ron, blinding pain, then darkness. He tried to sit up in the hospital bed, but he let himself lie back down when his side throbbed once more.
Harry noticed Draco’s jaw tighten. He ached to reach up and relax it with a gentle touch, but he kept his hand at his side.
It wasn't a substitute by any means. It would never replace what it was made to mimic. In some ways, it was hopelessly inadequate.
“You mean the trust my parents had set aside for me since before I was born that was confiscated by the Ministry along with 90% of the Malfoy vaults? That inheritance?”
Still, Harry knew better than to assume that a place was uninhabited simply because it appeared empty at first glance. His home planet, Hogwarts, had been diligent about educating its citizens about the horrors of colonialism on Earth. Seizing land through subjugation and slavery and violence, humans of the past had been barbaric, inhumane.
I imagine this vision sounds rather familiar; it's one with which you like to comfort yourself when you find yourself on the verge of a panic attack. You give yourself the respite of delusion, imagining a future in which you're not only alive, but you're thriving with everything you've ever wanted: true friends, stability, and
Harry squints against the sunlight that streams through the window and irritates his sleep-heavy eyes. He doesn't know how long he's been asleep, and the daylight is the only indication of the time. He reaches blindly on his bedside table, muttering a curse when he knocks over a half-empty glass of water along with his alarm clock and what he thinks is his wand.
"No, Harry. You deserve this. You died, but you decided to come back to this twisted world. While I think we should celebrate that choice every day, I think you'd strangle me at some point, but you'll just have to suffer through a little extra spoiling from me for the month of July." Draco's face was intent, fiery.
Potter dropped to the cold tile floor with a scream. Draco tasted acid as he watched the other boy writhe in pain as the spell wracked his body, an agony Draco knew well.
Pansy snorted, the traitor. “Oh, please, as if you didn’t initiate every game of Truth or Dare in the Slytherin common room.”
And I'd follow you. I'd grab my broom and we'd make our escape, dodging dark spells from my father, my aunt, the Dark Lord himself. But we'd make it out, I know we would.
But this—this was his opportunity to show Potter, and himself, how much he’d changed, how his inherited arrogance became hard-earned pride. Potter would go back to London bewildered and in awe of his weekend––not from the rush of the city, but because he’d spent it with Draco.
And every morning when I woke up next to you, I'd walk into the kitchen and look at the clock to make sure that time had passed.
The man nodded, scurrying out of the now silent bar, the bell attached to the door tinkling behind him.
So when Harry walked into the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione for the first day of eighth year, and the entire room broke out into whispers that made them sound like a snake pit, Harry froze.
When Taygete finally righted them and began to fly smoothly, Draco let himself look down, and his stomach dropped as Hogwarts got smaller and further behind them.
Teddy had a family, though; Draco and Harry were going to make sure of that. Even if their now year-long relationship failed at any point, Merlin forbid, there was a solid unspoken agreement that they'd both care for Teddy, no matter what.
Harry cast several detective charms on the enormous box. The words “Handle with Care” were stamped on it in large red letters. There wasn’t a return address, making the package all the more suspicious.
He walked up the stairs, his step lighter. He threw on a soft jumper and trousers and attempted to fix his hair before he walked back down the stairs toward the fireplace.
Not the grandfather one; no, the plain black one I bought when I first moved out on my own after the war. You rolled your eyes;
The sight of Malfoy with his smudged eyeliner and his lips stretched around Harry's cock did him in. He spilled down Malfoy's throat, shuddering as he felt Malfoy swallow and gently suck at his sensitive, softening cock.
Draco let himself be pulled up and canceled the alarm on his wand. As they walked, he took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Potter entwined their fingers, anchoring him to the ground.
He knew that the red and gold curtains that hung around his bed meant that he was in Gryffindor, and he mentally thanked the magical hat for not sorting him into Slytherin with that Malfoy git.
The spell settled over the Pensieve, causing it to glow for a moment before the light sank into the metal.
If Malfoy was startled by the question, it didn't show. He pursed his lips, aristocratic features appearing thoughtful. "I assume you mean to ask how I found you, and the answer to that question will come later. What I find to be more relevant is the question of what I'm going to do when I get back to England, and whether or not I'll be going alone."
“No, you see, I tried for a bit before I realized that nothing warms my bed like a good cock in my arse.”
You've given up on the pretense of not staring at him. The sun is setting, and that means he'll soon be yours.
Harry's allowed to be himself. He can be in the middle between angelic and subhuman. He can be anything, as long as he's with Draco.
Harry'd known this when they'd first started dating; his scathing retorts, now no longer malicious and more of a bone-dry wit, were harmless, even funny.
Still, even Harry's brilliant smile wasn't enough to distract from the obvious slight anticipation in Harry's deep green eyes.
I'd like to think you couldn't keep your promise, that you had no say in the matter, rather than the chance that you changed your mind.
it's not enough, it never is. He babbles empty promises of a bed and staying for breakfast, but it's always when harry's had Him on the edge for ages and His cock is heavy and leaking profusely on harry's tongue and He'd probably say anything to come. harry looks into desperate, blown gray eyes and thinks that he might see flickering emotion behind the lust.
Harry didn't bother to hide his curiosity, and he nearly jumped out of his skin when the bartender tapped his arm to hand him the shot.
"I wish you'd leave me the fuck alone!" Malfoy growled, forcefully casting a defensive spell, which Harry blocked.
Draco blinked his eyes open. He reached up to let a strong, calloused hand grasp his own and pull him up and onto a broom.
But at night, it's your bed he stumbles into with flushed cheeks as you pull little grunts from between his lips. He likes your hair, the way it gleams in the moonlight. He likes touching you, fucking you in the dark, where the world is draped in shadows; it's easier to suck cock when you can pretend you can't see it. He likes to feel you, more than see you.
Still, you’ll never be irrelevant enough to be forgotten. That gaudy statue of you still stands in the middle of the Ministry atrium for all to see, your 17-year-old self immortalized in the very pose you had when you saved the world.
“Take several days off of work to care for the other when they’re injured. I’m not even sure friends do that.”
It sat openly on His chest, an almost exact replica, but where the original had been gold, this was a startling, strange silver.
Draco let himself smile softly, fondness curling in his chest. “They visit me from time to time. And the same, by the way, with Teddy and Aunt Andromeda. I see them every so often, either when they come here or I visit Mother. They all understand why I can’t return. Besides, who doesn’t want an excuse to travel to New York?”
“Dad, I don’t know where you are,” she whispered as her eyes filled with tears. “But I hope you’re proud.”
Finally, the door opened. Pansy walked out, her smug smirk as wide as Draco had ever seen it, and her brown eyes sparkling as they bore into his like they wanted to extract all his secrets. Draco gulped.
“Keep your enemies under close watch,” Father always said. That’s why Draco was staring at Potter all the time. It was merely surveillance. Gathering intelligence. But he couldn’t tell Pansy, of course; she wouldn’t understand.
I let my emotions run wild because of you. I lost my inhibitions and my sanity because of you. I lied to my friends and family because of you.
Still, it would be rather stupid of me to let you off the hook, right? After all, you killed my former friends—and you were probably targeting me next. As forgotten as I was within my own ranks, your little Order friends were terrified of me. You were, too. Your eyes would always widen just a bit more when I was sent to make sure you were still alive in the dungeons. Not that any of us really cared if you lived, but it might have stunk up the place, and we couldn’t have that.
Summer in Manhattan was far hotter than outsiders would expect for a city in the Northeast; the air was sticky, making Draco’s hair curl at the bottom and Harry’s even messier than normal. The skyscrapers blocked the relief that locals would feel from the breeze.
As they walked along the corridor, Ron and Hermione continued to squabble over whether or not they needed to go to the library during their free period.
Draco once thought he would forever be defined by his name, or the mark on his arm, or the wealth in his family’s vaults. He thought that his value came from power, influence, and self-determination.
"Well, I-" Harry rubbed the back of his neck. "People are always telling me how highly you speak of me, how much it's clear how you feel about me and, well, I never hear any of that from you."
None of the people around him notice you; it's better, this way. She can have him during the day; she can rest her red hair on his shoulder and even take him to her flat for an afternoon delight, which is probably as kinky as she gets.
"Alright," he said, trying not to stare at Malfoy's lips and consider what it might be like to kiss him.
Draco let out a short, humorless chuckle. “You were in a coma for two days, Harry. The only reason they’re discharging you is that you’re going home with a Healer.”
And the crowd seemed to agree. Men and women and people somewhere in between seemed captured by their performance, watching them lipsync to Joan Jett's slightly raspy tone. Draco didn't understand why more people didn't get into Joan's music. She was an icon; they were glad to have discovered her during what Lucius called their Rebellion.
Already, he was running late. He still had to Apparate to the Ministry to retrieve the portkey. How did he manage to cock up his new life in America before he even left England? This had to be some kind of record.
Her father believed in the mysticism of magic; in the creatures and phenomena that thrive off of faith itself in order to exist.
You said nine months. I said ten. We bickered, then we argued, then we shouted. I showed you the calendar with our first date blocked out ten months ago. You threw up your hands. You said,
Draco shut his eyes, not saying anything for a moment. Harry stared at him, hard, trying to put on the mask of an interrogating Auror; cool anger was easier than revealing the anguish squeezing his chest.
"Well, I for one am going to celebrate being alive with a nice, long shower." Draco walked away, turning his head back at Harry. "Coming, Potter?"
The spell settled over the Pensieve, causing it to glow for a moment before the light sank into the metal.
I think you’re smart enough to know who I am. After all, who is Little Red without the Big Bad Wolf?
Draco allowed themself a small smile at their friends before Tarasque continued their sweeping search of the crowd when their eyes fell on two piercing green ones already staring at them.
His face was plastered on the cover of the newspaper, grinning from the cards of chocolate frogs, painted solemn and heroic in a painting in the Ministry.
“Of course not! You’re one of the strongest people I know, Draco, but asking you to relive that time in your life more than you already do…” Harry’s throat tightened.
He nearly yelped in shock but bit his tongue just in time to block the sound. A tanned, muscled back rose and fell with sleep-heavy breaths, and a head of black, messy hair was pressed into the mattress under Draco's spare pillow.
But, sometime last night, Draco had decided to give himself the chance that Potter seemed to think he deserved. The chance to change things. To have a fresh start. To make up for lost time.
"Hi Draco, I'm Silver." said someone with red lipstick and short black hair cut in a bob that reminded him of Pansy.
"No, but I am your friend. And your flatmate. And I don't want to be worried sick for three hours when you fuck off to Merlin knows where because you're feeling pissy!" Harry snapped, letting his anger creep into his voice.
“I’d begin by looking over the report from this morning’s patrol and go from there. I’ll be here for whatever you need, but so far, you know everything I do.”
She made a come hither gesture with her finger. “Follow me, Potter,” she all but purred. Potter gulped. Draco felt lightheaded.
There was no need to hide in the shadows; he refused to lurk in bitterness and anger until his soul rotted like Malfoy men had done for generations.
"It was dark and you couldn't see very well. You hit the breaks too soon; we ended up driving into a tree in a nearby forest. I'm fine, other than a little whiplash, but you just came out of surgery."
Potter rolled his eyes, then looked thoughtful. “I’ve got an idea. How about a way to make it a bit more fun?”
Xeno looked up from his book with a start, his eyes wide with fear until he saw his daughter. He placed a trembling hand on his chest. “Darling, you startled me.”
They missed the rest of their reservation at the restaurant, deciding to take room service later on in the evening instead. It didn't matter. They'd have tons of opportunities in the future.
Draco’s hands were shaking. “My f-father. He’s—the wards of the Manor—I was going to go alone, but then I thought to get you, and—”
Yes, he observed this from across the room. You get to know a bloke after living with him for almost a year; besides, Harry was very perceptive—constant vigilance and all that.
Weasley gave Draco one last glare before he let Potter steer him away from Draco, who widened his smirk in satisfaction before letting the mask fall away once he was alone again. He sighed, tilting his head back as he let his breathing match the rhythm of the waves.
The fireplace was clean, free of ash when she stepped forward. She closed her eyes and waved her wand, whispering the spell softly. She apparated out of the house just as the fireplace burst into flames.
The other students in the circle started snickering and whispering to one another. Potter’s face had taken a tomato-like hue, but he didn’t protest or deny the accusation. Draco sat, stunned, as he took in the scene.
I look between both ends of the cave. I know the darkness, cowered within it. Potter's smile shines with foreign promise.
6. He loves the American Muggle film “Young Frankenstein.” He insisted on showing it to me one afternoon, and he spent the whole time patiently answering my questions about the plot and the characters and if anyone else showed it to me I’d think it was obnoxious. But with him, I loved it.
No, Harry knew all too well that Parseltongue was like the wind created by a dagger flying past his ears, whispered threats and atrocities that kept him wide awake at night. The words spoken so softly echoed endlessly in his ears.
When Harry approached them when they were still dressed as Tarasque, Draco'd hoped he wouldn't recognize his old school rival. But he just chuckled.
"Draco! Merlin, I'm so sorry, I thought I had time and then everything got all screwed up and I got here as fast as I could."
I picture you reading this at, oh, roughly 17 years old. You're newly Marked and starting to realize what it is your father has gotten you into, what it is you've agreed to.
"We'll figure this out together, Draco," Harry whispered as they both gazed up at the sleepy, twilight sky. "We're a team, you and me."
He didn’t glare or scowl. He didn’t pick his words like heat-seeking missiles designed to target what he knew were Potter’s weak spots. He didn’t let his pride swell into defensiveness.
Harry smirked. “Good.” He released the man’s arm and let him right himself. The man froze, looking between Harry and Draco expectantly.
Draco smirked. "Harry was closer to killing me than I did him. And besides, I've found that sucking cock is a fantastic way to apologize. He and I have a lot of regrets, so we've got plenty of practice,"
It's incredibly stupid to imagine such things. Because even in a world of magic, the most fantastical vision I can conjure is one in which I'm worthy of being saved by you.
"Your birth month. We're going to celebrate your birthday a little bit every day this month until the 31st, when--well...that's a surprise."
Harry held Draco's gaze. "I know I missed the opportunity to make it perfect. To make it romantic. But we've had tons of wasted opportunities, right? And they all turned out okay. The times we could've been nicer to each other in school, the months we spent dancing around each other and dropping hints before we finally got our shit together. Draco, this is just one more incident where I messed up the timing, but I'm not worried because we're always right on time. So, Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?"
Harry pushed Malfoy against the tile wall and locked the bathroom door with a casual flick of his fingers, watching with satisfaction as Malfoy's eyes went wide and dark.
It occurred to him that, even after all this time, he still sought Potter’s approval. But he was hard-pressed to deny the 11-year-old boy inside him what he’d wanted since that fateful rejected handshake: the chance to prove himself.
It was a bit risky, he knew, to be standing outside alone at night. But the pull of nostalgia in his gut was stronger than the ache of his feet and the worry of danger.
Harry cringed and turned back to face the table to see Ron and Hermione looking at him, expressions full of nausea and amusement, respectively. He held up a hand in a small wave. Hermione shook her head and smiled fondly.
Draco knew he should walk away. It would be so very, very easy to leave Potter and disappear into the warm anonymity of the city crowd. He could get takeaway from that Indian place, as a reward for not breaking the Statute by hexing Potter on sight in the middle of a high-traffic Muggle area.
He let nostalgia and hope wrap around him like a blanket, warm against the chilly wind off the river.
It took him a week to travel across the continental United States. Since then, he'd been bouncing back and forth between Muggle stops in his favorite states: Montana, Texas, Virginia, and Massachusetts. As long as he used glamours and kept to Muggle areas, he could seamlessly blend in with the crowd, his British accent his only unique characteristic. He stayed for several months at a time in each place, but never long enough to get too comfortable, too easy.
“H-hello?” a low, gruff voice called from a four-poster bed. Curtains were drawn around it, concealing the speaker’s face.
Lucius hadn't looked at Draco when he spoke, the distinguished, aristocratic features facing the ancient walls of the Manor.
Draco doesn’t look up at the hubristic structures that scrape the clouds, as if the night sky rudely sits in the way of their ambition to reach the moon. The harsh flashes from Times Square cause their windows to glitter like mirrorballs.
"I know you were on the opposite side, but it doesn't look like you were very much involved--and you did come in very helpfully at the end there, so..." Harry stuck out his hand. "My name's Harry. What's yours?"
He let the light of the glowing neon sign draw him inside. He suppressed a bubble of relieved laughter that rose in his chest when the bouncer gave him a bored look and matter of factly asked for his ID.
I started measuring time by our fights. Monday was over the dishes, Tuesday was about Ron's birthday party, Wednesday was over what your father told you at dinner, and yesterday was over how long we'd been together.
Potter stopped walking. Draco followed suit, looking at Potter curiously. The other man’s green eyes gleamed with some inscrutable emotion.
Malfoy looked at him in confusion as Harry reached into his pocket and handed him his wand, stifling a chuckle when Malfoy’s eye widened.
Suddenly, familiar arms wrapped around his waist and Apparated them both to a nearby alleyway they'd come to think of as theirs. Harry turned within Draco's hold and kissed him, running his tongue along his teeth and carefully tracing the fangs, making them both shiver.
Harry'd taught Draco to seek sources of happiness other than the moments of Father's approval he'd gathered and coveted his whole life. There was a joy to be found in the simplest moments: a cool, soft pillow, an in-joke with a friend, the slow slide of the perfect kiss.
