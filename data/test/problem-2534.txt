“Do you think he’s doing ok? I’m a little worried for him.” Harry muttered, pointing to the sleeping form on the other bed. Draco responded with a croaky mew. Making Harry chuckle softly. “You’re right. He’d tell me if something was up. I think he’s starting to trust me.” There came the pats. Draco happily accepted them, bumping his head up into his hand and  wrapping his tail around the others waist, letting the cat take over a little as he lay down over the others lap. He was about the size of a Labrador, just really long, he shouldn’t be too heavy. Not like this anyway.
“Draco you know we’re your friends right? We’ll look out for you..” he looked up at her.
“Hermoine should do it. She’s known to have to balls to bring up such problems.”
“I’ll err.. I’ll go get changed then. See you in 15?”
“Oh Draco! You’re here too!” Lovegood said, sounding far too dreamy and happy for who she was greeting.
“Decide to stay miss?” Draco asked with a raised brow. She paled a little, clearly having said something she perhaps wasn’t meant to say.
Draco grumbled. Couldn’t say no now huh.. he sighed, too a deep breath and brought the bottle back to his lips. Drinking as much as he could in one go… it took him three breaks before getting it. When he was done he felt ready too puke. This stuff was a bit too sweet to drink too much of in one go.
He looked around. Helpless, anxious and full of fear. “Thinking you could hide from us Malfoy? We saw you stalking the halls alone today. Lucky for your puny little friends because they would’ve been next.” A deep, manly not student fitting voice said next to him. He tried to look at the figure next to him but he couldn’t turn his face.
The others egged him on. This was going to be a long night and… to be honest he was living for it. Perhaps this was what he needed a good night of drinking with new found alliances.
“Most unusual indeed… a powerful magic if over you. you’re more ridded with dark magic and hurt. But there is an overwhelming will to do good. To do better. You wish to heal others… more so than yourself, not a very Slytherin trait is it now.. You’ll be a seer.. a healer. Now off you go. Go meet your roommate.”
Took me a bit longer to get this chapter out. I've been working all week.
They made their way to the kitchen. there were no rules against asking the elves for tea outside of tea time. Draco was however a tad surprised to find Pip running up to him, holding her hands out for a hug.
“You’re an ass Malfoy.”
He nearly drooled at the sweet smell coming from the pot. When it was done he spread the contents over the two jars. Sealing them off and putting them under a cooling spell.
“It’ll be fine Draco, come on. He’s a real softie. He won’t lay a finger on you. At least it wasn’t the Weasley. My room borders his.. you should’ve heard him going last night. A true mess. Longbottom kept apologizing for his behavior till I asked him about the plants he brought.”
Harry handed him a picture from the notebook, Draco put his chocolate away, taking the photo and putting it in his lap, his hands were a little shaky. Harry knew nothing, he couldn’t look suspicious. He stared at the picture…
He looked over his own neat and loopy handwriting. “It shouldn’t be took hard. We can add pumpkin seeds too if you’d like can you gather the ingredients?” he asked harry, who looked a bit stunned.
“Oh shoo. We should be fine. Just don’t you know.. act like a git.” Harry hummed, walking up to the animal, carefully patting its head. The horse seemed rather friendly, pushing its nose against his hand. “Come here.” He motioned for him, taking his wrist. Draco didn’t struggle, but he did stand as far away as he could. Letting Harry bring has hand up to the horses cheek. “See… you’re fine. Just pat her.”
“Oh that sounds like fun! I honestly love it despite..” he paused. “Maybe we could exchange recipies. I never quite get bread right. Something about being impatient.” Harry joked. Deciding it was time to get up too. “Wanna work together for this class then?”
“Potter?” he asked. Looking at the mug. “Trying to poison me are you.” he added, taking it nonetheless.
“So. What you do is.. you let the magic flow through you. Let it run though your veins. To me it feels like a burst of energy. I can barely contain it. It feels like a scream building up in my chest and then.. boom. Try focusing on that.” Harry said. His voice was low. Concentrated on the task at hand.
“I am. Are you?” Potter smirked, wrapping a hoodie around his waist.
“Impressive indeed.” He nodded, relaxing a little. It was good to have at least someone. “You might have to teach me that one. I only got in safe by being an hour early.”
Draco simply nodded in reply. Why was he so emotional all of a sudden.. fucking hell..
“Alright.. Breakfast then?” Harry asked.
“She’s with Neville.. We’re.. not on good terms.” Harry looked away for a moment.
“Sure Dray. Be careful yeah?” Blaise hummed, taking his bag.
Dinner had been nice. He’d handed Hermoine the vails. Claiming he found them in his bag from over the summer. She agreed slipping one to Ron would be the best idea… and indeed. Over dinner. Ron seemed himself again. He was smiling.
Draco nodded slowly, grabbing the halter and lead, leading her to the brushing station and getting her ready. There were probably spells for brushing her but he liked doing it by hand.
Draco nodded. Still a bit stunned by the friendliness of the other. “I.. yes that’s correct.” He whispered.
“I have no bloody idea. I just made a run for it. Potter owes me really.”
A few minutes of bantering later he found himself walking to the gates with the rest of his year mates. Pansy, as per usual, had been right. everyone was there. Some already red cheeked and holding half empty bottles.
“Pansy?” Potter snorted, pushing a mug of hot chocolate in front of his book.
“As you said we have looked everywhere. Maybe he’s gone off to smoke something.” Blaise didn’t seem convinced by his own argument.
“You deserve to be here. You know that right? Don’t die on me. I can’t stand anymore death around me.” His voice hitched. There were tears on the brim of falling.
He felt a hand on his shoulder. The guard from earlier had a rather sympathetic look in his eyes. One he didn’t deserve. One he felt like he could breathe a little better he kept his eyes on the floor. “I am guilty. You can send me to Azkaban. Or execute me now. It’s ok. I cannot live with the guilt. I will willingly undergo any punishment…” It came out as a whisper. A desperate whisper.
So here he was. Dressed in what Blaise had called “Jeans, try them they fit nicely”. They were uncomfortable. He already had a great dislike for the stiff fabric. But one look in the mirror told them that they did indeed fit great. Did wonders for his ass really.
He made Potter jump by suddenly standing in front of his spot on the counter. “I cleaned up the first round. Your turn. Goodluck with the saucepan. It’s stained pink.” Draco grinned cheekily.
“I’m fine. I talked to Luna and.. I don’t know. everything was a bit much and I needed a good rest. When did you get back?” small talk. Small talk was good.
“Oh what?” Pansy hadn’t been following their conversation. But she was the perfect subject changer. “Me and Granger? She keeps offering me friendship. Its horrible. But she’s proven an alight help with homework. I guess.” Pansy shrugged. Going back to her conversation with Megan about Quidditch and how hideous of a game it really was.
When the dough has doubled in size, start forming the bread in the shape you’d like, after let it rest for another hour under a warming spell. Do not use the rising spell this time. If you fuck up you have to start over.
He cast a small lumos… the others face was tear stained, his breathing heavy… nightmares. Bad ones like his own. “Harry?” he asked softly. But the other didn’t wake. He just seemed to panic more. He tried again. “Harry wake up.. you’re dreaming. It’s a dream. It’s not real.”
“Who operates this second cockpit?” Harry asks. “Engineers? Scientists?”
As November approached, the weather got colder, and Harry stopped seeing Draco at the outdoor court on his way home from work. Instead, he found out from Ron that the basketball club was having unofficial practices almost every afternoon, in preparation for their practice match against Rosenberg University.
Healer Park appeared concerned. "How so?"
They opened the parcel together after Healer Kim’s review. They sat side by side on the couch, a full English breakfast laid out on the coffee table. The Auror Office had compiled all letters and packages for the two of them and delivered them in one bundle. Ron had sent Molly’s cookbook as promised, together with letters from his entire family. Hermione, Luna and Neville wrote their own separate letters. Seamus and Dean sent ‘Get Well Soon’ cards. Teddy had written a letter for Harry and Malfoy each, something Harry could see Malfoy being incredibly touched by. Malfoy received letters from his mother, Andromeda and Parkinson.
“Malfoy, you may feel fine
sex lives,” Harry amends. “I only do this with you.”
"Can we talk to our friends?" asked Harry.
Harry shakes his head, grinning. He's never going to forget
Harry types:
“Oh, I wouldn’t know,” Harry answered flippantly. “I only watched you.”
“Yeah, you fixed this just in time.” Draco slowly opened the fan and drank in the intricate pattern of a white peacock’s tail on the crisp paper. “Thank you.”
Harry is pleased to note that Draco has forgotten about his embarrassing slip-up and is now focussing on Harry instead. “I notice everything about you. I know you hate the spicy rice the school serves every Monday night. You put double the amount of sugar as usual into your morning tea if you’ve slept poorly. You read by the lake when it’s sunny out. You only drink coffee if Minerva offers some to you; otherwise, I think you hate it. I… I know a lot more, but I still don’t think it’s enough,” Harry declares. “I want to keep learning things about you until I perish.”
The tension in Draco’s muscles evaporated. His eyes wandered over Harry’s stunning smile, light chocolate skin, the sparse stubble along his jaw, his broad shoulders and wide chest. His vocabulary had somehow shrunk over the span of ten seconds, so the only thing he managed to say next was a boring, “Nice to meet you, Potter.”
They walked together, with Hermione leading the way because she was the only one out of the three who had studied the building's layout and knew where their first lecture was. Harry sleepily trailed behind his two best friends, backpack hanging from one shoulder.
Harry glimpses Draco smiling before he closes his eyes and their lips meet in a gentle kiss.
“You better, Potter,” Malfoy snaps. After a pause, he withdraws his arms and yanks the blanket to cover his whole body, including his head. Harry hears a sniffle as he gets up from the bed and goes to the bathroom.
Just inside the door is a small foyer where Draco has all his shoes arranged by purpose and colour. Harry takes off his own shoes here and enters the room properly in his socks.
"Weasley and Granger survived a
Potter, dressed in black formal robes, greeted him with a kiss.
Draco, an athlete himself, understood perfectly. He found it refreshing to listen to someone talk passionately about something other than basketball, even if it’s a sport he knew nothing about.
“Probably nothing. Or everything.” Potter shrugged. “Depending on whether your soulmark has anything to do with me.”
“Security and resources, Auror Weasley,” Robards answered vaguely. “You’ll understand when you become Head Auror.”
Draco wanted to know more, but unlike Harry, he kept his questions to himself, hopefully for another time. It was untoward to show too much interest in a person during the first meeting; at least, that was what Lucius Malfoy always told him.
They ascended the staircase and entered the first door on the second floor. Harry’s room was disorganised and messy. Books and folders were piled up on the study desk. The bed was unmade and the wardrobe doors were left wide open, the contents haphazardly stuffed inside.
He halted at the door when he saw Potter in the waiting room. Potter was seated in one of the two armchairs, slouched and flipping through a magazine. He hadn’t noticed Draco yet.
Harry gives him the figures and Draco’s thumbs fly over the keyboard on the screen.
"Did your Mind Healer teach your breathing and relaxation techniques?" Draco asked.
Potter was gazing at him with adoration and awe, a brilliant smile adorning his lips, not unlike how the real Potter looked at him. Then his mind moved from his imagination to memories, showing him flashes of Potter and the joy on his face whenever Draco showed up at his home, slept in his bed or woke up next to him in the morning.
He had taken one look at Harry — old sneakers, jeans ripped at the knees, plain T-shirt, messy black hair and round-rimmed glasses — and walked across the room (
They were already under the covers when Draco lifted his wand to cast
"I did. The nightmares were worse back then. The Mind Healers helped with most of them, except… except one thing. The nightmares I have now are mostly just about this one thing."
Draco shrugged, watching Harry help a Junior Auror correct her stance. “I’m finally his
The nightmare this time had been more vivid than yesterday. Yesterday, he didn’t even remember the details of the dream after Malfoy woke him up. He could pretend that it wasn’t about Malfoy. But the conversation with Ron that morning had forced him to admit that he indeed still dreamed about him. And that made his subconscious open a horrible can of worms in his head.
Draco continued to stare at him thoughtfully. “What are you suggesting?”
After several minutes of awkward silence, Harry fidgets. “Can I use your bathroom?”
"You're extremely hot,” Harry whispers huskily. “You're always covered up. So whenever I catch you with your sleeves rolled up or your collar unbuttoned or when you're not wearing socks and I can see your ankles, you make me go dumb. And don’t get me started on your hair, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your arse. You drive me crazy, Draco. Every part of you. Every inch."
“Are you going to tell your dad you’ve won the award?” Harry asked later when they were both in bed with a blanket pulled over both of them.
“No, I just really need to use your bathroom,” Harry assures tightly. “I’ll come back, if you want?”
“If you don’t want me to carry you to the hospital wing, at least let me in,” Harry warns, trying to sound stern.
“Maybe next time,” Harry said, smiling. “After watching a game like that, I’m itching to play some volleyball.”
than just two blokes spending two weeks off-work together.
"Yeah. I said you were hot yesterday, didn't I?" Harry feels this has been a dead give-away.
Potter blinked up at him. With a nod, he sat up cross-legged, facing Draco on the bed.
Draco was glad to finally see familiar faces, though he pretended to be disinterested as they approached.
“Agreed.. Wednesday. Lets go for a run. I’m a little rusty and both our techniques could use some work. I don’t know what sort of sport they’re having us play but I doubt they’ll let us play with anyone but each other.. I say we call a truce for at least sports. In turn once a month all your Hogsmeade drinks are on me.. I want to win this.”
He cut them both a slice and put a thick layer of butter on before spreading some of the now cold jam on it. He handed one to Harry, smirking as he toasted his own slice against it. “bon Appetit.” He hummed before taking a bite.
Once he had caught his breath he reluctantly followed potter to the healers quarters. For once not bothered by the mud he was dragging in. there was a sense of pride. He had finished, first, despite not being in the best shape. He hadn’t been killed by Potter. He only slightly felt like dying. It felt good. Not that he was going to admit that to Potter.
“You’re a good friend Blaise.” Draco uttered, simply hiding his face in the others chest again. They stayed like that for a while. Eventually making their way back to the dorms. It must have been pretty late. No one was in the common room anymore… except for Neville and Potter. Who were sat talking softly in front of the fire. Talking in hushed voices.
Harry did as told. Focusing his energy as he was told. Around the room wind was blowing, he heard the sound of water rushing by, stones clicking together.. fire burning. He felt his hands heat up. he opened his eyes, opening his hands. He was holding a bright fire in his hands.
He preformed some tests, putting a little jam on the plate and pushing it back to see if it rippled. He had to boil it down for about 10 extra minutes.
“No.. I’d rather not.” He turned. Potter was sat on the edge of his bed.
“My my fancy. Sure, Baileys and I’d also like one of those oat cookies. You did after all pull me from my important reading.”
“Sure Harry.” He mocked. They weren’t on a first name basis yet right? Too soon. They year had only just started.

Harry took it, letting himself be pulled up, hooking their arms. “Let’s go give them a show then.” Now it was Draco’s turn to flush lightly. He hadn’t expected Harry to treat him as his date. What would the others think. Only the 8th years really knew they got along pretty well… he could ruin Harry’s reputation. Maybe this was a bad idea…
It was healing. He still had his nightmares. He still had trouble feeling accepted. He still nearly jumped out of skin being touched. But having actual friends instead of alleys. Having people see him as he was now, instead of who he was… it felt freeing. He leaned onto Pansy’s shoulder who in turn leaned her cheek on his head.
“Tomorrow. 3pm in the dorm. If you’re even a second later you owe me more frogs” he hummed, opening one and popping it into his mouth, going back to his book.
He knew all elves were free elves. Especially theirs. She knew she could go if she wanted. He just hoped she wouldn’t be offended.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well yes Potter. Or do you not like fluffy bread?  We can make a blueberry jam in the meantime if there’s ingredients. Now off you go.” Draco smirked, glad he could show off a little for once.
The yule dress was much easier to find. a sparkly grey dress with a similar bodes and a lacey cape to go with it. When Hermoine tried to look at the tag it was snatched from her hand. Blaise and Draco both treating her to the dresses since she deserved a treat. She had flushed and made them promise to accept at least a butterbeer then.
a rather quick update this time. I'm still not sure on how much drama I would like to include. Hence today some fluff.
“How?” Draco snorted.
Instead he carefully ran his hands through the others hair, pushing it back into place. Harry was propped on his chest but over time he could see the others furrowed brown relax. His breathing steady and slow. His arms squeezing around his waist. He smiled softly. Thankful he had been able to help the other.
Ofcourse. Zabini had been neutral. Not picking a side. Not that people didn’t blame him. He was still a Slytherin and he would be discriminated against either way.
But Kingsley interrupted. “Are you done mr Potter? I am having a hearing. You rudely interrupted my first sentencing.. we indeed have taken the better actions of the youngest Malfoy into account, those mentioned by the likes of you and ms Lovegood. Now if you will please take a seat and join us. In peace.” The prime minister didn’t seem upset. He was scolding but he sounded rather proud.
“Want to try.” He held out a cigarette.
“I think around 3. Did you see the cat? He was here last night.” So he was going to bring it up.
Draco grumbled sitting up. “What are you waiting for?”
“Shut it Potter.” Draco muttered. Trying the pen out before handing it back.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He was full on bawling now like a child. “I’m sorry for being mean all the time.” He sobbed into the others chest while he received some awkward back pats in return. Those pats soon turned into a hug, a tight warm hug.
“Pans. Shut up. I did not. I just had a good night sleep.” He hissed in reply. Continuing on whatever potion they working on.
“Say pip.” He croaked softly once the bread was in the oven after its final rising period and she as making him a hot chocolate. Yes it was the middle of summer. But he had a sweet tooth and she’d let him have anything as long as he got something in his stomach.
It really was true, working out had cleared his mind. He felt a lot better after it, even if he hadn’t liked it all that much.
“Done. You ready to taste our homemade bread?” he asked Harry, moving on from the previous topic.
She did as told and he pulled out the little box from his pocket, carefully placing it in her teeny hands with deinty fingers.
When pip returned with their tea and a plate.. loaded with buns he let her have another hug. Smiling as she waved them off.
“You’re.. no being you today. Well you are. But you’re not antsy. So what has happened?”
“You know some healing spells? I refuse to go to Pomphrey’s. I don’t want anyone to hear of this.” Malfoy uttered, not refusing when Blaise stayed silent. Just pulling him into a careful hug.
“For Merlins sake Ron. I cannot keep up with you. its team work, not Gryffindor takes the lead and drags you through the damn pit!”
“Sure.” Draco snorted. Stiffly getting out of bed and stretching himself out. The man was like a cat in the mornings. Stretching and yawning for a good few minutes before moving on. When the others gaze finally turned to him. His eyes widened.
It was a few weeks later. Classes had continued and Draco felt himself drowning in his schedule. Between the runs with Potter, which had been making him feel a lot fitter and distracted him from his thoughts, homework and classes he found himself to have very little time to relax and focus on himself.
“You’re telling me you’ve never you know.. put on shite music and danced to it with your friends? You’re disappointing me Draco.” Harry teased, hitting his shoulder playfully. Since when did they do that? “Don’t worry. I’ll lead.” Draco could sense his smirk.
“Whatever.” Draco looked away, letting the other get his buttons undone. He froze when he looked back. Potter was staring at the scars wrapped around his chest. Starting at his right hip and wrapping around him all the way up to his throat. He instantly tried to move away. But found himself frozen in place. Carefully and slowly Harry reached out. Tracing one of the lines across his chest. He opened his mouth.
He split the vanilla pod, juiced the lemon and crushed the blueberries lightly in a large saucepan. Putting the fire on medium heat and dropping everything in.
so what did you guys think?! I love reading your comments about the story, tips and just stuff in general!
“Of course the great Harry Potter knows how to ride bloody griffins. Is there anything you don’t know?”
They Apperated straight to Olivanders. Draco went pale when he saw the old man in question still there. Sitting in a wheelchair. His hair was a bit fuller. He had gained some weight. But he looked healthier. He was alive.
He smiled at her. “I suppose we should.. How many curses have you had thrown at you so far?” he tried. Making her grin.
Hermoine was the first to go for a band. She seemed rather excited about the whole ordeal. Eager to learn more about the ritual. Anderson put it on her arm, taking out his wand, which was in quite the state. He aught to learn something about proper wand care…  he muttered a spell in a language Draco had never heard before.
Harry laughed beside him. “Are you ok? Can you walk?”
Step three:
“It’s fine Malfoy. It makes sense don’t it. We would make very unlikely friends.” Potter didn’t sound disgusted. He was open to talk and for friendship.
Weigh everything and sift the flower. Make sure it’s all set up before start.
“Seems like you’ve come in the right time.. my roommates missing, I’m afraid something’s happened to him. Will you keep me company again? I’ll take you to Luna tomorrow. She’ll know what to do about that paw.” Potter muttered, patting on the bed beside him before he realized Draco couldn’t jump up there. He carefully helped him up there. Laying down and very carefully stroking the literal leopard. Not questioning the fact it was a literal leopard, it nearly made Draco raise a brow. But his mind was too foggy to care. He just flopped onto his left side, curling his tail around himself and taking the tip in his mouth. Holding it in place.. before he knew it he fell asleep. Save and sound in Potters arms. He faintly heard him mutter about not wanting to lose another person.
“That one. He.. escaped. Over the summer I’ve visited a farm where he went to live with other Griffins. I learned how to ride there. I just.. needed to get my mind off of things you know? finding new hobbies and such. I’m in no way a professional. But I know how to stay on.”
She hummed in response, nuzzling into his side. “I might. I don’t know why they send us back… do they want us dead? Or are they planning on blaming the first best incident on us to send us to Azkaban either way?” Pansy hissed, silent enough for no one else to pick up on it.
He drew an upside triangle. “Water. An element of healing and peace.” He draw another upside down triangle with a stripe though the bottom of it. “Earth. And element of grounded, logical and hardworking people.” Regular triangle “Fire. Courage and passionate.” Regular triangle with a stripe through the bottom. “Air. The element for social butterflies. They are known for their joy.” Anderson hummed.
“You ready git?” Potter challenged him.
“You. I can’t leave the dorm if you aren’t. Hurry up. I’m starving.”

“Yeah lets to that.”
Blaise snorted in reply. “I don’t know Draco. You seem to like him dragging you around fine enough all the other times.” He hummed, earning himself an elbow to the gut.
He was a little taken aback, but carefully took her hand. “I’m glad you’re willing to give me the chance at redeeming myself even in the slightest. I’ll do everything to avoid disappointing your trust in me.” She smiled in reply. Squeezing his hand. Before letting go. Their conversation turning to other pleasant things. Pansy left them at some point to go pester someone else.
Next up was the pole slide. A high fence they had to get on top of, with several thick poles going down, on the end there was a jump to the next pole. Again they matched each other’s beat pretty much perfect. There was another shot. Mandy and Sally had fallen in between the poles. “I can’t believe were actually doing well.” Potter panted besides him.
“You know you can call for me when stuff like this happens right? I’m your friend Draco. Always have been.. and seeing this. I don’t care for appearances if it means I can make sure you’re safe.”
He couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like.. having this for the rest of his life..
He was woken up by Pansy, who was gently stroking the hair out of his face. “Dray? Are you awake?” she asked, gently cupping his cheek.
He heard potter laugh in between his panting. “Final one. Come on. We’re just behind them.” He called.
“He’ll push you away. He’ll fight you. He’ll be a right git to try and rid of you. but I’m asking you to please keep pushing. Eventually he’ll accept it. Especially from you. My god Potter.. If you knew how many “Potter” rant’s I’ve endured over the years… Point is. He needs you. I believe there’s a reason you two were put up together. Both the golden boys of the opposite sides.”
He felt a hand on his back, pulling him back to reality.
“Sleep like this thank you, I’m already asking enough of you, one last favor to add to the tally.” Came muffled from his chest, making him snort.
And hurt it did. It hurt so bad. He lost track of the amount of spells, punches and kicks. The sharp pain and deafening sound of his right forearm being broken. He could feel it snap. He felt every bit of pain but he couldn’t do anything. At this point he couldn’t even scream anymore. All he heard was the maniacal laughter of the demons that had decided to haunt him. Where was potter and his savior complex when you needed him? Where was he when you were being nearly beaten to death? Those were his last thoughts before he lost his consciousness, his vision turning black and the laughter turning into ringing, the pain turning into a buzz running though his body.
Fortunately for Draco, Harry was always watching him.
“Yes, we promised to grab a meal afterwards,” Hermione replied, still seated. “Aren’t you joining us?”
“One day, I’ll take pleasure in proving you wrong.” Harry’s gaze flickered to the side and lingered on Draco’s left ear before he sat back. “I work part-time at a grocery store after classes. I can take time-off on Thursday.”
After Healer Kim left, Draco threw his pillow at the bespectacled idiot. It hit Potter square in the face. “Fuck you! This is all your fault!”
They slept facing each other until morning.
interesting, so now suddenly you love basketball.” Ron rolled his eyes. He looked up at the ceiling, above which was Dean’s room, listening for noise before asking in a whisper, “Listen, are you even sure he, you know,
"It's too late to start over." Harry inched even closer. "I already feel too… My feelings for you are just too... Let me kiss you.”
“Shut up Pans. At least you weren’t dragged into the water.” Blaise looked worse. His white tee was caked in mud and he was dripping everywhere.
He looked to his father. The man didn’t even look at him. He felt so numb. Spacing in and out. Were the lights always so bright?
“I should. Go on. Open it.”
Malfoy seemed to regain his control. “Shedding season huh?” he asked.
He nodded quietly. “You shouldn’t have to thank me. I should have done more to get you out.” He whispered, his voice tight.
“You didn’t.. I didn’t know what the curse did as I cast it.” Potter uttered, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I thought I killed you.. I regret it.”
“I’ll fetch Poppy. Do watch out for yourself Mr. Malfoy…” she sighed, giving him a rather soft look before she left.
“My my Potter. Asking me on a date are we?” He smirked.
The students happily followed him to one of the outer towers. A place that used to be mostly of limits during their last years. It had a view over the lake. Decorations were rather scarce, but enough to make the tower feel warm and cozy.
1 large lemon. Do not enlarge it. If you find two small ones that’s good to.
“So. I heard you and Potter went to train by the lake huh?” Blaise asked, putting more mashed potatoes on Draco’s plate. He had taken Pansy’s side on making Draco eat more. Filling his plate every time he managed to empty it till the food vanished.
“How…”
So he asked Blaise for advice.. Blaise was rather approachable. Other than Pansy who shot him daggers anytime he breathed wrong. Yes Blaise was the better option out of the two people Malfoy hung out with. He’d done it Monday morning. As soon as he could.
“Oh I see… bout time.” Pansy shrugged.
“So what do you say. Friday we sneak out to Hogsmeade for a pub crawl. Drink till you drop.” Ron smirked around. Seamus whom was sat next to him beamed at him.
“No?”
500gr of flour
He looked up. right… Trail day. He got up. with some trouble. How long had he been sitting in that corner?
“Who says I’ll ruin it?”
“Shower first. I smell like shit.”
“I don’t know.. it looks a bit too dark.”
“Next time there will be spells fired towards you, creature will be simulated to jump you. take your time to get around todays parkour… 5 minutes to discuss a technique.” Anderson hummed, that man was far to excited. Getting up on his broom to watch over the field.
Neville and Blaise.. a very unlikely pair.. but they seemed to get along? A friendly nod between the two as they walked out. Not quite surprising there, Blaise could practically make everyone like him and Neville.. well he was brave, but quite simple minded. He had probably lapped up every lie Blaise had thrown his way..
Draco nearly lost his balance. Grasping the saddle. He remembered what harry told him. Right.. Watch the right leg.. soon he found a rhythm. Missing the beat just a few times as Amour trotted around Harry.
Draco paled a little next to Harry. The thought of this.. friendship ending so soon. To lose harry, whom he was trusting more and more.. it scared him. He knew this offer wasn’t for him. He had to finish the year and he wouldn’t want it differently. He had lost nearly two years of studying and he was far from ready to face the world outside.
“M’fine. I don’t usually drink.” Draco muttered, shivering under the cold air, making a half assed attempt at getting into the coat.
He got a muffled thank you as the other pulled the hoodie on, his hair a static mess as he pulled it over his head, making Harry reach out to fix it.
Surprisingly were Longbottom and Daphne, chatting happily together. Draco would Question her on that later.
He got back to the task at hand. He wondered where all the bread went. They made three breads everyday for the last week. He knew the elves for one didn’t eat bread, it messed up their digestive system and he and his mum never ate that much anyway.. he decided not to question it.
“I’m sorry if it hurt you too.” Draco muttered as soon as the door closed behind them.
“This dance doesn’t count. This was forced upon us. I’ll lead us. Just follow me.” He muttered, standing up with the rest. Holding his arm out for Harry who took it. Not reluctantly. More so nervous. Draco found himself to be glad Harry didn’t seem to mind. It was too late to find a date now…
“I snore? Potter… you invented snoring. It’s like you’re chopping down the forbidden forest every night.”
I've been sitting on this chapter. Wanting to add enough words to get the count up to 20 000. as you see. I have failed misserably. But you deserve at least one update.
“It wasn’t Cedric this time. It was.. Sirius.. then You.. then Lupin.. then Hermoine.. he killed everyone and then he began chocking me out. Holding me up so I could see everyone that was gone..” he chocked lightly.
He’d worked mostly in silence, not realizing Harry was just watching, mesmerized by the way he did it all. He followed each step carefully and clearly, completely shutting out the outside world, it was like he was working on potions. He was efficient with it all and could get lost in it.
He looked at his mother. She opened her arms to him. He fell into them. she rarely hugged him… but it felt safe. It felt so much better. He didn’t put up a mask anymore. There was the clicking of camera’s. He didn’t bother with them. he just clung to his mother. Sobbing with her. He had never dared to believe this.. he had never dared to believe he would be allowed to live after all he did.
Harry let Blaise guide him to his dorm, kicking Neville out who raised a brow. Harry shook his head. It was ok.
“Draco. You’ve been sat here for three hours and I know you’re not enjoying this book. When you’re distracted you forget to control your expression and I can see you cringe. Come on.”
They quickly got to work. Everyone else was too. Seamus managed to fuck up by using a second rising spell, the dough exploding everywhere. Hermoine and pansy’s station was a flour covered mess. Lisa and Megan were avoiding rising spells all together. They had started on a butter recipe during their first rise.
“Red huh.. I really do have a good influence one you.” he snickered.
“Ah of course you share a room with the man of your dreams.”
“Alright! Times up! Starting position!” Leigh called from the side of the line. Potter slapped the pole into his hand, he gripped it tightly, anxiety and adrenaline building up in his chest. Releasing as soon as he heard the booming starting shot.
“Work together. Trust each other. Nothing in here can do any serious damage. Ready. Set. Go.” She cast a timing spell on them.
They made their way back to the castle. It was honestly more a blur than anything else.
He stared up at the ceiling, a croaky voice shaking him out of his thoughts. Nearly making him jump at the closeness of it.
“I’m sorry..” He mumbled, stumbling over his own feet. “You kept disappearing. Why’d you leave me alone?” he asked quietly.
“Blaise.. What happened to him.” It wasn’t a question. He demanded to know.
Draco stared into Harry’s eyes, he’d lost his nerves from earlier and now he was leading there were no more foot crushing incidents. He looked strong, like the way he had looked when he taught Draco how to ride horses, or when he was doing something to help others.. it was a look Draco was growing fond of, very fond.
There was more grumbling… Don’t mess with leigh. Got it. They did their pushups before professor Anderson appeared n the field. Handing everyone a pole. “Field is set up. now today is a rather easy run. But I want all of you to keep your wands ready. If there is anything you don’t want to get wet.. take it off now. Before you loose it forever. Questions? No. Great. Just run straight forward. Watch out for your teammate.”
“Just a little would be fine..” Hermoine muttered behind them as she let herself be dragged into the first store.
“A fine one.”
“I say we check out the stables. It’s warm and dry and he could be hiding out in there.. If he isn’t there lets take that bloody awful horse of yours out for a walk with us.” Draco said, walking up to the stables, truth be told over the few visits he’d paid the animal it had grown on him a little. She was a lot calmer than the crazy gelding Finnigan and Thomas had obtained.
Harry Potter     /  		Draco Malfoy		G+S
This chapter contains some depictions of violence and some flashbacks. Please do keep that in mind.
Once the class was dismissed he stopped Draco in the hall. He would have to ask him now or it would be too late. “we’re going to Hogsmeade tonight. Most of the 8 years are going. I’ve been meaning to ask you to come too. so like.. if you want too.” he tried to sound cool about it. Looking at Malfoy who was raising a brow.
“I was chosen yes. By my father and HIM. But I didn’t want to be. I was afraid of what would happen to mom. Just as she was afraid for me. Father just wanted to be his little bootlicker.” He felt his fathers eyes on him. But he couldn’t stop speaking the truth. He wanted to hug himself, but with his hands cuffed it just turned into him pushing his arms into his sides. His chest felt heavy. He felt like all the air had been drawn out of him. Feeling so painfully aware of the all the eyes on him.
“It’s nearly 1am and everyone else is going to head back soon anyway.”
“I’ve got some recipes. If we don’t end up cooking more we should do so after Hogwarts. You’ve got the patience it takes and I’m certain it’ll work out.” Harry replied, finishing his slice and making himself another.
“Fine. Let me finish this chapter.”
As she said that the tables filled.
“I’ll take you up on that. it would be nice to have a family.” she hummed, smiling and giving him a wink before dragging him back off the dancefloor.
So they did. Pansy looked like she had gotten even less sleep than Finch. “She talked my ears off. She talked about the power of unity and friendship and all that FAIRY BULLSHIT.” She took a heated angry breath. “Who thought this was a good idea. I didn’t even talk to her. She has planned study meetings with me for the coming month. We don’t even know our classes.” Great. Another friend in distress. Perhaps Draco should stash some sleeping draught for his friends too.
“Thanks I suppose.” Harry knew he was trying not to sound too pleased about it. But it was rather evident when he heard the pen click a few times next to him and caught Draco studying it before looking back up at their teacher.
“yet it is Scum.” Aah.. a Hufflepuff he had been forced to put into detention. He felt his wand being taken from his pocket. But he wasn’t completely defenseless. He knew some minor wandless magic.. enough to make a hex jump back.. but they weren’t planning on hexing him.
“What kind of backwards logic is that?” he chuckled, turning to look at Harry. He looked tired too. thankfully. That at least meant Draco wasn’t as out of shape as he felt.
“Don’t make me regret it… Wednesday. Put it in your schedule.”
He did as told. Amour going back to walk with ease. He felt incredibly giddy. “I actually did it!” he called.
“You can eat here but if pip catches you making a mess. Pip will have to scold you.” The held up her tiny pointy finger before disappearing again with her friends.
“We’re having a cooking class instead of sports since even leigh seems to realize that making us run over a field and ride horses hungover is cruel.”
Harry, still looking a bit dazed and confused nodded sheepishly. “Yeah.. err.. thanks.” He muttered, his morning voice was deeper than usual and it made Draco’s stomach flip a little. He nodded curtly before gathering his stuff and speeding towards the shower. feeling a little embarrassed by it all.
“What is that supposed to mean?!” he hissed, louder than he should have, earning a glare from Slughorn. Pansy just gave him a sly smirk. Moving the conversation to something else.
“Any hexes, jinxes or any form of harmful magic aimed towards another student will be punished with detention and expulsion. I will not tolerate any more harm done in this school.” She stared around the hall, glaring at the Gryffindors especially before looking to the new teachers.
The two others shot up the moment the door shut.
He let out a single sob, which gradually turned into full on crying. He knew he deserved this.. but merlin did it break him and his spirit. He had been too happy, that shouldn’t be enjoying himself. Merlin forbid he felt happy or safe. He should have been more vigilant and watched out for himself. he should at least have defended himself instead of simply being taken and beaten by a bunch of children.
They stood on their usual spot. Draco behind him. He had given up on trying to take the lead. Harry was overall better at that, keeping in mind the others shortcomings, though he was starting to catch up more as they got into a routine.
“I know.. It must have run into the threstrals or griffins maybe? I feel bad for it, it’s rather friendly. I think you’d like him.”
He turned to look at Ron and Hermoine. Ron was holding a small whirlwind, Hermoine was holding a mountain in a small glove.
Kingsley was looking behind them. Draco would turn around if he hadn’t been spelled in place.. or felt like he would faint if he made a wrong move. Perhaps he should have eaten what had been offered to him despite the spit on it.
“Nothings happened? I’m just having a good day.” He shrugged noncommittal.
“Hey.. hey now its alright.. I forgave you already remember. I wasn’t nice to you either. Clean slate. No need to apologize.” Harry said, his voice strangely calm while dealing with a drunk Draco.
Shortly after the war had passed Draco and his parents had been arrested. They had been put into cells awaiting a trail… Draco was surprised he even got a trail. From what he heard Theo’s father had been put into prison right away. Goyle was is St. Mungo’s. He had lost his mind completely after what had all happened.
“Will do. Save me a seat at dinner yeah?” Draco said, turning on his heels and making his way to the library. He’d been looking into getting some plants to spruce up his dorm. Rather than asking Neville and getting pulled into a 3 hour conversation he thought it would perhaps be best if he did some research first.
“But I’m here.. and Hermoine is in her room with Pansy Harry. Were at Hogwarts in our dorm, the 8th years dorm. He’s gone.. you’re safe. Here. I’m safe here.” He spoke in a soft and gentle tone. Yet it was demanding enough to make Harry look away from the spot on his bed he was staring at and instead face him.
“Horses Blaise. Can you believe them. have they not learned since second year?!” Draco complained, dramatically splayed over his lap and looking up. “I am disgusted.”
He closed his eyes and did as told. Trying to let his magic go. When nothing happened he dropped his hands. “I can’t Potter. My core is probably too dark it’s been ruined.” He whispered. He hadn’t meant to say that last part. Nor had he meant to sound so emotional when saying it.
Draco’s eyes met with Blaise’s even he looked nervous… They would probably be paired up right? I mean. They were unlikely friends, Blaise was of a much lower stance than him when they became friends. Though the guy had worked himself up over the past while. He was friends with people from all houses, friends with benefits might I add. The bloody succubus.
“Draco are you crying? It’s ok I.. it’s fine. I’ll always be nice to you if you’re worried about that.” he just nodded silently in reply, quietly wrapping his arms around harry.
“Better.” Draco mumbled in reply. Finally changing into his Pjs in the bathroom. When he got back, Harry was asleep. Not even under his covers. He pulled them over the other really quick before going to his own bed. Passing out as soon as his face hit the pillow.
He fell asleep on the sofa, without a potion this time. Dreaming nice dreams. And only waking up the next morning.
“Will do.” Harry nodded. “I’ll let you get your sleep then. Sleep well Draco.. and..” he seemed hesitant to say the next part, closing his mouth as if deciding against it before opening it again. “..I won’t let you get hurt like that again. You’re my friend now whether you want to be or not. Hermoine and I will look out for you too. Ron will come around too..” before Draco could reply. He disappeared into the shower. His chocolate untouched.
If you want to feel free to leave a comment with tips or just general stuff! I'd love to hear of you guys!
“Draco Malfoy wanting to try a muggle hoodie? That’s one for the books, sure. Let me see if I’ve got a clean one.” He hummed, beginning to dig through his trunk, soon coming up with a somewhat clean Hoodie he’d gotten in London a few years back. Bold letters saying London across it and some random date.
Except when Draco was drunk.
Because Harry has had a big crush on Malfoy for more than a year and he is finally going to confess his feelings.
“I call you Harry in my head.”
Harry only stood up when Ron's Patronus passed through the door and stopped near his ankles. He cursed after hearing the message.
The court was surrounded by a green wire fence at least five metres high. Inside it, Draco’s blond hair appeared white under the evening sun as he bent down to pick up the basketball. His black T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms made his pale skin stand out much more prominently. His long hair had been tied back and somehow stayed against his scalp. He appeared to be alone; just him, the ball and the hoop.
“Potter? Thank you for dropping me home.”
Harry contemplated this. He would need to ask his boss for another day-off, or switch his roster around with a colleague so that he would be free that day. He nodded resolutely. “That’s a good idea.”
"What was that for?" Harry wheezes, chuckling despite the pain.
“Potter? Potter, wake up!” Draco placed his other hand on the Potter’s shoulder and shook him as hard as he could. “Wake up!”
“Don’t worry about that. My mother pays for all my bills and she always lets me do whatever I want.”
It didn’t take much for Harry to convince Hermione to go to the Hogwarts-Rosenberg practice match with him. Hermione was a diligent student and spent any free time studying or revising, but she always remembered to make time for her best friend-slash-boyfriend. In fact, despite not playing any sports herself, Hermione had a good understanding of the mechanics of both basketball
They take several minutes arguing over the best position to eat while hugging. When Harry points out that only Malfoy needs to hug him (and not the other way around), Malfoy’s face crumbles in despair and Harry embraces him for five minutes until he stops crying.
Harry never figured out what Malfoy meant by that, but he became obsessed with seeing that smile again.
“I don’t believe that. What could you have done to make him dislike you?”
Potter shrugged, mumbling, “I remember a lot of things about you.”
Teddy Lupin hates strangers.
Harry’s eyes twinkled behind his glasses. “Nice to meet you too, Draco.”
"Prayer for the Dead and the Living," said Draco, attempting and failing to tame Potter's hair. "Very old Wizarding custom."
“Potter." Draco unapologetically watched Harry bend over his duffle bag in search of dry clothes. "It's been seven years since the war. Are you still…”
Ah, yes. That had been Potter’s fault. Draco distinctly remembered Potter yelling
He has entered a laboratory of some kind, but what attracts his attention is beyond the glass panel at the side of the room. Beyond the glass is, undeniably, a large farm of what looks like giant, pink wheat. The stalks are seven or eight feet tall and shed a flurry of golden seeds that fly around the chamber like gold dust and stars.
“The public bus?” Harry’s eyes widened in disbelief as they both got to their feet. “You don’t… I mean, I expected you to have a fancy car or a chauffeur or something.”
"I'm hungry," Draco said. He also wanted to see Potter earlier but he kept that bit a secret. "May I borrow Kreacher?"
Draco confirmed that there were no purple pustules on Potter’s face and he prayed to Merlin that there were none on his either.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. “We’re not children anymore, Malfoy. The war is over.”
volleyball, so she was the perfect person to play translator to Harry, who had never watched a real basketball match before.
“Yes, let’s make more. Together,” Draco says. “If we fold one thousand of them, Uncle Harry will grant you a wish!”
. If you can’t, stop doing it.”
They Apparated to Muggle London, where they walked around in a large park and enjoyed the autumn breeze, hands clasped between them.
Then they never spoke to each other for years. Draco had been stuck with a horrible partner for two years before Potter entered his life again. As annoying as his carelessness was, Potter was a great partner. He was a natural leader who listened to others. His magic, wild and powerful, inspired both awe and fear in those who witnessed it.
“Would you like some tea?” he asked, placing a tray on the coffee table. On it were a teapot and two cups. He gestured for Draco to move, and as soon as Draco sat up, Potter plopped down next to him.
He returned to bed with butterflies in his tummy and a silly grin on his face.
"Alright," Draco prompted when Harry paused for too long.
Draco gingerly placed his hands on Harry’s back. “You’re such a pain in the arse, Potter.”
Draco remembered the conversation Potter was referring to perfectly. While he had been glad to be rid of his horrible ex-partner, he was also particularly relieved when he discovered Potter was the replacement. Potter wouldn't see him as just a Death Eater. Potter wouldn't throw him under the bus. Potter would give him a chance to prove himself. He felt safe with Potter, had trusted him to win a war and now trusted him with his life.
"Are you kidding me?" Harry demands, literally shaking Malfoy back and forth. "You're Draco Malfoy! You're never
In the end, Malfoy props a large cushion against the armrest and makes Harry lie across the sofa with his back against the cushion. Then Malfoy pulls one of Harry’s legs until it drops to the floor. This creates a space between Harry’s thighs that Malfoy settles into, his back against Harry’s chest. He bends forward to fetch a plate of dinner and a fork from the coffee table and leans back. He winds one of Harry’s arms around his own waist, leaving Harry’s other hand free to feed himself using the fork while Malfoy holds the plate.
“Your shots are pathetic,” Smith jeered. “Your head is obviously just for decoration.”
The apothecary stocked an amazing array of products, with multiple sections each offering niche potions or ingredients for sale. They were here to purchase ingredients for the simple medicinal potions Draco brewed and stocked at home.
“Yes,” Draco answered, surprised, a hand immediately going up to touch his left ear. “How’d you guess that?”
Draco smirked. “I thought you’d never ask.”
But Draco couldn't concentrate on what Harry was saying. He was seeing doubles and his chest felt tight. "Harry, stop…"
"Yes. I'm a member of the Soul Squad. We study anything related to the human soul. The Soulmate Detection spell is a simple spell, created by the Unspeakables themselves.” Draco paused before adding. “Of course, I've tried it on myself."
“Thank Merlin. You’re as healthy as a peach now. I believe the potion is also out of your system. Now if you excuse me, I have three students in the infirmary needing Pepper-up. Good evening, gentlemen.” She heads towards the door, casting an adieu over her shoulder.
Draco stumbled and caught himself on Harry’s arm. He knew that he should have stepped away immediately, but something in Harry’s gaze made him pause. The intense way he looked down at Draco was alluring —  had his eyes always been this
to look guilty. “I’m sorry, I
Before walking away, Malfoy gave Harry a genuine smile, which was both beautiful and surprising, leaving Harry mesmerised and a bit dazed.
The dining room had a high ceiling, an ornate chandelier and walls adorned with landscape paintings and portraits alike. Harry wasn’t sure how to act around the man who had tried to kill him on more than one occasion, but seeing Lucius Malfoy sickly and confined to a wheelchair reminded him that the war was over, and people could change.
Malfoy punched his elbow, snapping him out of his reverie. With a wince, Harry cleared his throat, “Um, what do you want for lunch?”
angry,” said Malfoy. “I hate that we’re infected with spattergroit. It’s a horrible ailment. Do you know about the Quidditch World Cup in 1877?”
Draco yanked his hand back, his body getting defensive and ready for the incoming ridicule. “Think my name’s funny, do you?”
His disguise was a spoiled rich kid who’d never spent a day under the sun, and Harry admitted that the role was tailor-made for Draco.
Fair hair swayed gently as Draco quietly fanned himself. His movements slowed when he sensed Harry, disguised as a waiter, approach him with a glass of champagne balanced on a tray. With a small bow, Harry handed the glass to Draco, who accepted it (along with a tiny piece of folded paper, a secret message from the Head Auror) without looking at him.
"I could have killed you too!" Draco pointed out irritably. "Doesn't matter. We didn't kill each other."
He was pushed into a metal chair, ropes winding around his body, while excited exclamations buzzed around him. They were beyond themselves after successfully kidnapping Harry Potter. Oh the ransom the Ministry would pay! The notoriety! The attention!
“Harry Potter!” Professor Scrimgeour struck Draco’s table with his ruler, the loud noise making the young man wince. “Move it, lad!”
Harry chuckled, sounding amused. “Not at all. My godfather was named after a constellation too.”
The food did not turn out up to Harry's standards. Even though he had been making breakfast for days now, this morning felt different. He wanted this to be special.
Harry nodded, beaming.
“You mean yesterday. It’s 2 o’clock in the morning,” said Draco tiredly.
Captain Malfoy asks his guards to wait outside before inviting Harry inside his private meeting room. There is a large oval table with steel chairs, but Captain Malfoy isn’t sitting. Instead, he stands by the windows, hands behind his back as he surveys the void outside.
"Potter?"
It was unexpected how they both played different games and were marvellous players in their own right, but still managed to push each other up.
Harry blinks. “Uh—”
“Well, your name is very unique,” Potter remarked, amused. “Aren’t you going to show me yours?”
Harry laughs, hopelessly enamoured.
good in them. His face is pointy, sharp, and strikingly fair. He leans against one armrest, grey eyes honing in on Harry like a missile. There is a smudge of dirt on his forehead but it takes nothing away from his remarkable glamour.
"Why didn't you tell me?"
When they reached the pavement in front of his house, Draco took his time getting off the bike, purposely letting his hands linger on Harry's muscles. After he returned the helmet, he took several steps to the door before turning back to Harry.
Malfoy’s feverish heat blazes over Harry, who feels obligated to point out the obvious. “You’re hugging me.”
Harry heard the
“I didn’t do anything. You came up with the solution on your own.”
"Disappointing." If Draco felt Harry's fingers gently carding through his hair, he didn't say anything. "I don't think I like… girls."
Malfoy squirms, as if unsure what to do with this new revelation, which makes Harry anxious. This isn't how Harry wanted his confession to go. The last thing he wants is to make things awkward between them.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says hastily as Malfoy rubs the back of his flushed neck. “Shit. I’m sorry. You’re just really hot. I mean, literally.” Harry’s face heats up. “You have a fever.”
“I was
Professor Rufus Scrimgeour scowled distastefully at the vacant seats in the front row. Aside from Draco Malfoy, most of the students had chosen to sit behind the third row. Slamming his metre-long plastic ruler on his large desk, Professor Scrimgeour pulled out a piece of paper from his leather bag and made a big show of waving it around in the air.
Harry smirked. “Something better.”
"You mean we can suddenly pass out…?" Harry trailed off, glancing at Draco, who completed the sentence.
So Draco showed him. He knew Potter learned best by doing. He even squeezed Potter's hand to show him how hard to grip his fists and how to relax them. Potter got it quickly, falling into a soothing rhythm of breathing in and out.
What happened after that, though, he struggled to recall.
Have you any idea what that's like?"
Potter's gaze was sad and disappointed; Draco could not bear to look. "But I want you to be there. I want to spend my birthday with the people I care about, and you're one of them."
his own
So this left him with just
Until Halloween, when Draco accidentally blurted out that he was dating Harry Potter over dinner at Malfoy Manor.
Harry would have liked to admire Draco’s smile longer, but he is caught red-handed when the latter turns and sees him.
Harry breathed heavily. The wind was picking up and he figured they should get moving, but he couldn’t move, not when Draco was gazing at him curiously. “They couldn’t locate your soul. They needed me to find you.”
Draco closed his eyes and saw accusing glares directed at him. "People."
Harry finds himself grinning.
Draco could almost hear the unspoken words: 'I
"Harry, this better not be your guilt talking," he warned, unable to look away from Harry's mouth. "I don't want to be your charity case."
“See you on Thursday, yeah?” Harry grinned as he waved. Draco waved back, which made him beam even wider before he turned around. At the entrance, he joined a tall guy with red hair and a woman with large, bushy hair.
Potter visibly deflated, like all energy had been sucked out of him. “I’m, I’m sorry you had to see that. Damn it, this is bad,” he muttered that last bit under his breath.
“Pass the ball, Malfoy,” Weasley said, jogging away.
Written for the prompt: a slow burn being like… I’m not in love with them! cut to scene of the person in question staring dreamingly at the object of their desire.
Harry adored this man. So much. He could die.
“Only Uncle Harry and Grandma are family,” Teddy protests petulantly, hugging the stuffed toy close to himself.
It was two days after Draco had walked out of Grimmauld Place; the taller man had not owled or visited since. Harry had tried writing, but words had always failed him at critical moments so all his drafts had been Vanished or angrily ripped apart. Today, he tried again. He searched within himself for values he held dear, Truth and Honesty, and hoped they were enough.
has been tasked to escort and protect her throughout her entire voyage to the Andromeda Belt, where the Starfleet Federation will be joining the other superpowers in the galaxy for the Millennial Peace Conference in the Belt’s largest star:
"Hermione always told us not to eat or drink after brushing our teeth," said Potter, smiling a little. "Something about cavities? Her parents are dentists, you know."
“I’m sorry.”
The wait was pure agony. The isolation and loneliness made it worse.
"Your friends will be there, Potter."
Like Draco had suggested, they made the best out of their situation.
So when Hermione barged into the Auror Office and hurried to his desk as though chased by lightning, screaming "Malfoy is in trouble!", what would you expect Harry to do?
Draco’s soulmark appeared on his twenty-first birthday, branching lines covering the inside of his right forearm. From the pulse point of his wrist, a single black line diverged and split even further until there were a dozen endpoints, the tip of the farthest branch stopping just short of the fold of his elbow.
Before they left, Narcissa wrapped a dark purple scarf around Harry’s neck. “A gift from me, Mr Potter. It used to be my honour of being the one to make my son smile, but after the war, after our mistakes, I believe that honour now has been transferred to you.”
Harry hears Draco locking the door as soon as Madam Pomfrey leaves. When he returns, he sits next to Harry on the sofa, his back rigidly straight and eyes avoiding Harry.
True to his word, Ron would grudgingly tell Harry how Draco was doing at every practice, so Harry learned enough about the people Draco was often seen with: Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle and Theodore Nott.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, feeling something odd about Harry’s answer, but couldn’t focus enough to determine why. “I… I’m sorry I asked.”
The twins – Parvati and Padma Patil – are at the navigation controls. The black-haired man, Michael Corner, stands behind another brightly colored panel, controlling the camera bots that transmit video images onto the monitors. Zabini is there too, watching over Corner’s shoulder like a hawk.
“Congratulations,” Harry said, grinning. “I knew you’d make it. I wish I could see you right now.”
"What's happening?" Harry straightened up when Draco was called to the bench and replaced by Anthony Goldstein.
Malfoy clasps Harry’s chin between his fingers, grey eyes serious and smoldering. “Harry.”
Closing the door with a scoff, Malfoy walks past Harry towards the sofa, sniffling along the way. He is wearing at least three layers of jumpers and a pair of thick cotton joggers, which look really odd yet really good around his slender legs. He flops down onto the sofa and grabs a small hand towel that he wipes his nose with.
Potter tugged back his right sleeve and dropped his forearm on the table for Draco to see. Right at the centre of his forearm were multiple black dots which Draco recognized immediately.
"Why are you just standing there, Potter?" Malfoy snapped, not looking up from his task.
“Ron,” he said, sensing his best friend turning towards him, “am I a selfish person?”
“Hm, no idea what you just said,” Draco quipped as he brought his hands up to cup Harry’s jaw and continued kissing him.
“But I feel fine,” said Draco. “Are you sure we can’t go home?”
Harry landed on two feet in a shallow puddle of mud.
“You still feel cold?” Harry asks. When Malfoy nods, he slowly backs himself against a wall and leans on it for support. Malfoy follows and leans against him.
Despite being three storeys up, the room is dark and dingy. Only one light bulb functions, but it flickers off and on every few minutes. The neon signs across the street are more reliable and constant sources of light. Harry sits at the desk by the window, wearing nothing but a pair of low-riding joggers, and leans back against the chair as he draws on a lit cigar.
get a prize?”
In search of Harry, Draco went to the kitchen and halted at the doorway.
Draco doesn’t look up from the handheld device he is typing into. “What’s the weight and mass of your ship? Including your crew and weapons.”
“Britain didn’t join the World Cup in 1877," said Harry, who was rather proud of his knowledge on Quidditch trivia.
The section Draco was in was darker than the rest of the shop and felt rather claustrophobic, with narrow walkways in between tall shelves packed with potions in various containers. Draco had his head in one of the large display glass cases. He picked up one vial, peered at it closely and then, with a sour expression, returned it back to its spot. Harry looked curiously at the assortment of products on the shelves, turning around while he walked. Until he bumped into Draco’s back.
More importantly, he trusted Draco's judgement. He defended him whenever other Ministry officials tried giving Draco a hard time. He liked telling Draco about his friends, about his godson, about Quidditch, and other random tidbits, even though Draco never shared stories of his own. Sometimes, Draco felt Potter was protective of him, and even though this
“Tell everyone I’m sorry.” Harry smiled ruefully. “My partner almost died.”
“No, you don’t have to—” Draco tried, but Weasley had already placed the receiver down. He barely managed to talk himself into just ending the call when the phone was picked up again.
should be the one thanking
Draco was infatuated.
Then he sat on the bed and waited.
Draco lifted the spells chaining Harry to his chair but before Harry could stand up, Draco pushed him back. He planted his butt on Harry’s thigh, forcing Harry to quickly wrap an arm around Draco’s waist and stabilize him as the latter swung his legs up. Draco wound his free arm around Harry’s shoulders and adjusted himself until his thighs were lying perpendicular on top of Harry’s. When Draco moved the fan, Harry felt the air tickle his own face.
The potion activated as soon as it touched the pustule, burning the infected tissue and simultaneously healing the skin cells beneath. The sight was just as impressive as the first time around.
Pansy brought home lunch. She worked as a model for a Muggle agency. Her agent kept putting her on various diet regimens, so her choice of food always astounded Draco. Luckily, she remembered to buy regular food for him.
“I call this,” Draco says, silver eyes gleaming, “The Faith Apparatus.”
The entire ship sharply lurches to the side, making Harry’s stomach turn over, and then immediately rights itself again. The manoeuvre gives Harry whiplash, but he manages to remain upright by holding onto the back of Hermione’s chair. Dean and Seamus aren’t as lucky – they have both fallen to the floor.
Harry completely fell for Draco the day their midterms results were announced. To celebrate, Harry smuggled two bottles of beer into their room. Alcohol was forbidden in the dorms, but Draco had never gotten drunk before, and he claimed he was dying to try.
They talked a bit more. Eventually, Draco felt Pansy give him a hug. "Do you know what to do now, darling?"
Harry accepted the bouquet, lost for words. “Red roses, Draco? Seriously? For me?”
The chamber mimics a cockpit, but a much less sophisticated one. There is a smaller version of a Captain’s Chair in the centre of the cockpit, overlooking the large viewing screens that display the vast space beyond. Beneath the screens were two seats for navigators, and another off to the side for communications. There is nobody sitting there, and the stations are turned off.
"Thomas, Finnegan, Longbottom. I think other Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw too but I don't recall their names."
After registering, Draco was instructed to take a seat. The only available one was beside Potter, who now had his gaze fixated on Draco, magazine forgotten.
Much to Harry's relief, instead of being offended, Draco laughed. He did, however, change the subject. Despite bringing him up often, Draco never appeared to enjoy talking about his father. "Our match against Rosenberg is next Monday. It’s an open game, so you can come and watch us if you want.”
Teddy takes a moment to study this new man. He reaches out, taps Draco’s fingers and instantly draws his hand back.
Draco hesitated for a moment, but then he mumbled "Fuck it" and proceeded to unbutton his pyjamas. "You want to see my scars, Potter? Fine." He didn't stop with the buttons. He tore off the pyjamas completely, exposing his arms; His Dark Mark strikingly dark and obvious on his pale skin.
belly and slide smoothly into two openings on the roof of
“Never took the test. Never needed to.” He tried to recall who among his friends could drive. He knew Blaise could, and maybe Vince too. Pansy and Theo definitely couldn’t.
Harry laughed quietly. “You’ll have to tell me beforehand when you’re going to call. Otherwise, I’ll stay up all night waiting.”
Draco was tight-lipped and rather embarrassed to share the details
“You’re done with most of the class. All I want you to do is go up to them and see which one would like to bond with you. You’ll be working with one per team in two weeks’ time. The coming week you’ll have to work on your relationship and getting some basics down. Today though. Just find a partner.”
“It’s fine. We were drunk as all hell. I should’ve gone to the bathroom to change.” Draco interrupted. “Please forget about it alright? Let’s not make things awkward. It’s in the past. I don’t hold it against you. You shouldn’t hold it against you either.”
Malfoy walked up to it. Carefully patting it. “We’ll have to get used to it Pansy… Death surrounds us..” he whispered, getting into the carriage. Where he was greeted by a familiar face. “Blaise.” He said.
It didn’t take them long to make him pass out. He didn’t exactly know how long he was out. But long enough for it to be dark and for Blaise to find him. “My god what have they done to you love.” Blaise uttered.
“I’m going to assume you’re stealing the shower first?”
“Very good!” Anderson said, signing for them to sit back down. “Do keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with not finding your element right away. It takes a lot of energy and knowing yourself plays a big part.” He said, spelling a piece of chalk to write some things down.
It was nice until they went to get back in and Draco realized that cigarettes  could hit you worse than alcohol. He stumbled, falling on harry as his world went black for a moment. “Merlin..” he uttered.
Draco snorted, shooing them off and taking his book. Finding a spot on a sofa in the common room. Everyone was too busy showering and cleaning up. he was safe for now, but he kept his wand close, just incase Weasley decided to come for his ass.
“I…” Potter stayed silent, making Draco turn to him finally to face him. “It’s a good distraction. I’ve done nothing but working out all summer to move my thoughts and tire myself out to you know.. get some sleep.” He flushed a little.
Unfortunately he wasn’t too in tune with the cat and when he got head scratches.. he purred. Rather loudly too. Fortunately the only affect this had on Harry, was evening his breathing out further and taking him out of whatever nightmare he had. All Draco had to do. Was make sure he turned back before Potter noticed he was ever here.
“It’s fine Harry. I know it’s a bit too much for him.” Oliver said. “He needs time. I don’t mind br…” Before 	Draco caught the rest of the conversation he was pulled back to reality by Pansy Dropping in his lap. “Draco my love, my most favorite boy on this earth. Tell me darling. How did you pull it off?  I nearly made an attempt on Grangers life.” She dramatically exclaimed.
The elf dared to open her little arms. Giving him a hug. Making Draco laugh. The first time he’d laughed in a long.. very long time. It was as clear as a waterfall. He felt a little giddy. It was nice.. having someone care about you. someone to give gifts. A friend.
Because I am a perfectionist. Here is a little chart of house and roommates:
Cozy tea time soon turned into cozy forgetting-about-dinner-time. It was around 8 pm. Long after dinner had ended when Finnigan loudly complained about being hungry. Someone cast a tempus charm yelling the time.
“What do you mean love?” he asked, glancing at her with a raised brow.
“That’s me professor.”
“Everyone deserves to have someone that’s nice to them. you do, I do. Everyone does.” Harry said back, leading him though the shack and into the basement where a riggedy old tunnel was.
Hermoine Granger /   	Pansy Parkinson	G+S
“Now. Three seconds in. 5 seconds out. Listen to my breaths alright. You can squeeze my hands. If you start feeling too panicked.. you can tell me. I’m here.” He forced himself to keep meeting the others gaze. Harry still looked panicked, but did as told, following his breathing. The squeezing on his hands became less and after a few minutes his shoulders relaxed again. “better?” he asked quietly.
Granger’s eyes grew big before they glazed over. She straightened up.  Anderson muttered something else. something about Grangers future and her being meant for great things, he managed to catch the word earl... She seemed to take in the words before disappearing through the door to the female dorms.
“What you drink is hardly tea.”
“Let me help you. This is rather pathetic.” Harry chuckled. Already in his Pjs.
“Sure darling. Come on now Draco, sit up.”
“Good job! You’re a natural!” he sounded so genuine, Draco couldn’t help but feel accomplished, smiling at the other.
“there you go.” He whispered, simply taking Harry’s hand again. Feeling the other untense at the touch again. “It really got you bad huh?” he whispered. Harry nodded as a reply. Putting the glass away again.
“Who says I haven’t found it already?” Draco drawled, rolling his eyes.
“Don’t ever apologize for needing help Harry.. I… I promise I’ll be there for you alright? I might not be perfect. I might not be a fantastic help but I’ll do whatever I can.” His voice was determined. Steady.
He’d lost track of his coat somewhere, not that he was truly bothered at this point. He was snugged in between Pansy and Hermoine. Giggling like a moron as they dragged him to the next pub where they dropped him off on a table to sit with the others for a moment. They were told to keep an eye on him and stop giving him drinks.
“so what do we do first?”
When he finally woke up again his vision was clear. His mind was clearer too. though he did feel a faint buzz.. that probably had to do with any numbing potions he’d been given. He looked a his fingers. He could stretch them again. That was a relief. He groaned slightly, looking around the room. It was dark again.. he must’ve been in a bad state huh. Now if he could just silently make his way to his dorm…
“Surely darling.
Lisa Turpin and Megan Jones, another Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff hadn’t made much noise either.
A cold shiver traveled up his spine. He tried to will the spell over himself down. He managed to get it down enough to speak. “Where do you think this will get you kid?” he barked, sounding far more confident then he felt. “they can’t send me away. If you kill me they’ll find out and you’ll lose your wands. Just stop it already.” He hissed, focusing on freeing himself from the spell more.
“That elf is scarily like you Dray.” Hermoine muttered, bumping him as she made her way over to the table.
Draco nodded. Letting Harry move his hands. Why was it so hard to breathe when Potter was close? He moved his focus from the others face to their hands. Relaxing and trying to conjure his core.
“Of course you’d do that git.”
Aside from needing to take pain numbing potions and having to rub ditany on any cuts and bruises left he felt rather alright. But due to the concussion he was advised to stay out of class till at least after the weekend. He’d told her he’d do just that before leaving to his dorm. Collapsing into his own bed. Hoping to catch some sleep before the others would come back to fuss over him. His body was tired from the healing.
“Me? Angry, of course not. I’m just a little worried about some stuff, lets get you into your Pjs alright?” he tried to smile, looking at the pouting guy in front of him. he remembered the last time Draco had gone to Hogsmeade.. had it really already been months ago? They had been a little more cheerful last time. But he didn’t mind.
Upon hearing Draco’s voice, Harry tripped over the threshold and clumsily stumbled into the apothecary. As he straightened, he inwardly cursed Ron for making him visit Draco
“Maybe we should talk with the Healers,” Potter suggested when they reached the waiting room still holding hands. “Get their advice.”
. The Krurians have strategically targeted and conquered dilithium-rich planets, conquering the supply. The Federation and her allies are running out of supply, and without the dilithium, their warp-dependent spaceships’ usefulness would be severely diminished. Having a renewable alternative source of energy would be instrumental in turning the tide around.
There was a startled gasp. “Malfoy? Is that you?!”
Harry’s eyes never left Draco as he worked. “You’re making the antidote?”
to Draco's insides.
Malfoy somehow manages to wrap his arms even tighter around Harry. “Are you leaving?” he demands with a quiver in his voice that Harry attributes to the cold.
He heard someone yell his name before pain struck across his cheek.
“If this works, we can easily beat them,” Greg added.
Malfoy grabs something from the coffee table — his new elm wand — and casts a Tempus. “Soon.” He glances at Harry through narrowed eyes. “I don’t want you around when I take it.”
Rom smiled. “Sure, mate. I’ll owl you the cookbook. Glad you’re doing okay. So…” he paused, face turning concerned, “no nightmares?”
“Why do you have that?” Harry’s voice trembled with barely disguised fury as he kept his eyes on the orb.
Blaise, fortunately, was a more experienced player than Draco. Once Draco got over his ball-hogging, Blaise carried the team on his shoulders and dominated the game along with Greg. They had a lot of points to catch up on, thanks to Draco’s stubbornness in the first half.
They woke up later than usual and shared a long shower. By the time they were dressed, it was already time for Healer Kim's session.
” Draco demanded.
Being the centre of Potter’s attention was like standing on the surface of the sun. Draco’s skin burned at every contact with Potter’s hard body, but with the heat came pleasure.
Harry crossed his arms, vexed. “Ron and I have the highest percentage of solved cases, I’ll have you know.”
Draco had lost count of the number of times he fantasised about Harry’s bed.
Draco glanced at their clasped hands pensively. “I’m not sure. I’m not sure how I feel about this. About us.”
Professor Scrimgeour started shouting names in pairs and then pointing at seats in the front row. He would wait for the two students to sit down before moving on to the next pair. He carried his metre-long ruler like a weapon, brandishing it at students who walked too slowly while he yelled at them to hurry up.
Harry grabbed Draco’s arse, intending to say '
Blaise had gotten the ball close to the hoop, getting ready to shoot, but at the last moment, he bounced the ball back to Draco, who caught it between his hands.
at flirting. He had never done it before, let alone with another bloke. His attempts mostly involved him being unapologetically honest and generous with his compliments. Although Draco never verbally acknowledged his teasings, his body language — the pink tint of blush on pale skin, the twinkle in silver eyes and the tiny smile tugging his lips — always spoke volumes.
“Huh? Yeah sorry, I was distracted.”
Hermoine had told him he shouldn’t assume whether the other was or wasn’t gay, not how the world would act upon it.
“Were starting with a small warm up. 2 rounds around the pitch and then straight back to here. If I catch any slack.. more pushups.” Draco groaned, Merlin this woman was dreadful. He reluctantly ran with the others. It went surprisingly well, it only had him panting slightly as he returned to his spot. He stole a glance at Blaise, who clearly had never ran for anything in his life. He already seemed like he was going to pass out. Leigh didn’t really take note of that though, making them go back to pushup stance as she continued her speech.
