“I’ll go easy on you, I promise!” Dean said a little too earnestly.
“You have a nice place.” Harry hummed conversationally. In the months since his pardon had gone through, it seemed as though Draco had really built himself a home here in Rye.
Draco opened his eyes and grabbed for the essence of dittany. His novice healing spell had stopped the burn from spreading up on the seventh floor, so he ignored that step. He carefully peeled off layers of singed fabric from Greg’s burns and retched at the smell. He cleaned each burn with painstaking precision until no trace of ash remained. Once he was satisfied that the burns would not get infected, he coated them in the dittany.
“Good! Now that that is settled, what did you want to ask me about?” Bill sat back and took a long sip of his mead.
“Until the very end.” James smiled warmly.
“Your girlfriend doesn’t seem too happy.” Draco commented, putting Harry’s left hand on his waist before taking his right hand and gently leading him in a basic four-step dance.
“Mr. Shacklebolt.” She inclined her head respectfully while still maintaining eye contact as she approached the high table for her dose of veritaserum.
“I make absolutely no promises.” Harry rolled his eyes as he removed the candles and cut the pie.
“Bloody brilliant, mate.” Theo grinned appreciatively, picking up one of the half-made buttons and throwing it at Draco’s face.
The Ministry has fallen.
“I know you don’t! Are you stupid? No one wants to think about painful things, but you have to in order to heal and move on. So get ready for some tough love, Potter, because apparently, you need it.”  Pansy crossed her arms and cocked her head in a defiant stance.
“I don’t know, I haven’t seen you cleaning anyone else's face off. It’s kind of intimate, ‘innit?” He grinned suggestively, causing more heat to rise to Harry’s cheeks.
He descended to the ground floor, internally cursing when he sensed a ward on the door leading to the lobby. He detected the magical signature of their target as well. Harry grabbed his Partner Journal and quickly scribbled a note to Zach with a self-inking quill, warning them about the wards and confirming that their intel had been good. The words disappeared and Harry held his breath. The Partner Journals had been his idea. Hermione had helped him engineer the spellwork for them based on the abilities of Tom Riddle’s diary, but seeing the ink disappear always forcibly reminded him of those dark days of his second year. It was an invaluable field tool, but that didn’t mean he had to like it. Zach’s writing appeared on the page, updating him about the security measures out front and Harry had to hand it to their target. He had done a thorough job of protecting himself.
"Am I
"I don't think he knows that"
“I would love to but I am a bit trapped at the moment” He said, glaring back at him.
"Not as much as I would like." That was surprising. "And I don't think she would like to know me... and with what happened to her daughter"
. Cute, Potter, very cute" Draco walked past him towards the other two gryffindors, walking as if he owned the school. Christ, he seemed the same boy he had met all those years ago. Harry had to remind himself that Draco probably felt outnumbered and was faking his arrogance.
Ah. Harry nodded, still trying to focus his eyes -he was going to end up with a head ache but he really wanted to know him more. And he... Maybe it was time to let someone else know him as well? He was terrible at sharing anything about his life, or his feelings or dreams... Did he have any dreams? Merlin, he had tried not to have any as a child but they had been there. At first his dreams were all about leaving the Dursleys, maybe having a nice job and a little house. After discovering the wizarding world, his dreams had been much more loud, giving him hope for the future. At least for a while. At least until Sirius died.
Draco rolled his eyes, hard. "It is not about war! We are an important family, we have... We have money" He seemed unsure about that "And power is the most important thing! Can't you understand that?"
Harry shrugged at his comment, but the smile on his face told Draco everything he needed to know.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Two truths and a lie"
Anger flashed from Draco's eyes and he wondered if his question had been
Draco then did something he never thought in a million years could be done -or maybe he wasn't a normal teenager and hadn't fantasized enough in his lifetime-, he barely pulled away, taking only Harry's lower lip between his teeth and biting down hard. Harry groaned, but even thought it hurt, he felt alive, incredibly so. And it
"Of course" Draco knew how much Harry deserved it. Still, it was hard to think about what to get him. Harry didn't have anything but he didn't put that much weight on material things, which made it all the more complicated.
But what did he even want?
The bedroom was still light up, and even though they were behind thick curtains, they could clearly see each other. This wasn't like last time, when they had been safe in the dark. Draco didn't seem bothered by it, moving his hands through his chest and back as if he was feeling the world for the first time.
"I was told not to cry"
"We came to see how you were, everyone's-" Draco tried, but Elliot interrupted almost immediately.
"Yeah, I'll play..." He looked towards Draco, looking for support and found the slytherin with a small smile on his face.
They weren't hungry like the night before, just soft, caring. Draco was sure he had never felt... So much love for someone as he did in that moment. He remembered something his father had told him once about Narcissa, how she had made his life bright, so much so it sometimes scared him. Draco had been young at the time -so young- but the words stuck, and now he understood. Sadly, he doubted Lucius was the father he had idealized during his childhood. Had that man ever existed? Yes, he had been cruel at times, harsh more than caring but he had loved him, had he not?
"Now who's being traditional?"
But he hadn't been able to resist it, right? He had been there, he had seen the pained look on his face, the way he bit down on his lip drawing blood, the things he blurted out he would never say out loud. This didn't make any sense.
Harry had no idea what time it was, but he knew it was late. They had
"I-... Yes. And the W-... Ginny"
happen? I couldn't ask Elliot and you were busy"
"I am sorry. I do not expect to be forgiven, but I
He wanted to send her, but Hedgwig's wing would never fully recover from that dreadful night. "Hey, girl, don't be mad" He smiled when the white owl tried to tear a piece of the letter with her beak, demanding more seeds "Alright, here, special for you"
"I wasn't hungry, father"
"You have
"I never killed anyone." He said and cleared his throat. "I can say you-know-who's name. I love my Father"
He looked down at his own hands, feeling guilty at the things he had called his father moments ago. People would never understand them. Not even Harry, not really. They would forever be Death Eaters at worst, cowards at best. No one would ever see the love, would they?
Remembering the odd meeting he wanted to spy on he finally moved towards the boy.
Harry shook his head "No, Draco. That's not how we work. We tell each other things, alright? And my friends are
Draco wanted to say that of course James Potter had been nice, and good, and
" Draco whispered, pressing a hand on Harry's knee. His startled reaction was enough to make him smile. It was incredible how little Harry ate. It was true that he had been a whole year on the run, eating whatever they had -which he had said hadn't been much- and surviving purely on adrenaline but now they were safe. And Harry needed to stay healthy. He needed to start taking care of himself.
Harry"
"Harry-" Draco was touching his cheek, and he almost didn't realize it.
There was a long, awkward silence, before his father stood up. "Smart of you to associate with Potter, of all people" That was his opening line, which made Draco's stomach turn. This could only get worse, and he didn't know if he was ready for it. He had run the scenario in his mind several times, but reality was worse.
Harry gave him a look. "I'm going to go find him... and..." He looked at them for a brief moment "I'm going to bring him here for the night, so please don't give me or him a hard time and just... don't say a word about it to anyone. Alright?"
"It all looks the same to me" Draco went back to writing but with a smirk on his face "Your drawings are almost a perfect copy"
"Banished? Yeah, but Mother is softer than you would believe"
"Not yet"
Harry didn't look up at the sky, he kept his eyes on his face, trying to find something he didn't like... he failed.
Harry moved through the corridors without being seen, and went straight for the Infirmary, if he was lucky they would still be there discussing what had happened. If not, he would have to find a way to get a teacher to talk to him about it, and that could prove difficult.
Harry frowned, McGonagall couldn't possibly think Malfoy of all people had done this. The whole attack reeked of magic and he didn't even have his wand. True, Slughorn wasn't the most capable keeper of said wand but he would've noticed if it wasn't there.
"I doubt that"
Draco shrugged and his hands traveled through Harry's arms to his wrists. "I don't know, ask him"
What about your parents? Are you ready?
"Yeah I guess" Harry tried not to think how few people he had to send letters to. "Sometimes" He cleared his throat "Usually to Ron or Hermione"
"Ron, back off"  He frowned looking at him "Look, I know what you all think and that's fine. I just... He
name"
"Well, well. Never thought I'd see Harry Potter in one of these"
"She told me she was going to the game, but she was still in the common room when I left. If she left after I did maybe she saw something or someone?"
, and his favorite:
Once he was inside his bedroom, he locked the door and sat on his desk. Potter's letter felt heavy inside his pocket, he hadn't read it yet.
If Draco had considered talking to McGonagall the idea of her calling Lucius made his stomach turn. "No, thank you. I don't want to escalate this. It was just... It was nothing"
"Malfoy" he whispered, sitting next to him and slowly touching his arm. The boy tensed up. "Please talk to me"
"I think we should ask for another one" He said while running his fork through the pie "Don't you think?"
"The Aurors' history"
He looked up at him, uncertain but hopeful "I just want her to be okay. To be the same she was before"
And he stayed there, holding his hand. Draco closed his eyes, squeezing hard and trying to relax, to find his breathing again.
"Yeah, it could be" Elliot whispered, moving his hand to hold his'. There was a brief moment when neither of them spoke, holding the other's hand and trying to calm down. He wasn't sure if Noah
"No" Elliot sat in front of him and looked at the two intruders "He's Noah, we are friends. And you can say whatever you want to say in front of him"
The piece of pie was soft and incredibly delicious, Harry didn't remember when was the last time he had enjoyed something sweet. When it had became clear that Draco wanted to go to Hogsmeade for breakfast, Harry felt unsure about where they would go. Would people stare? People always stared. And not only that, but they were breaking the rules by being out of school on a Tuesday on their own. Draco didn't seem to worry about it one bit though, going straight for the Three Broomsticks. It was one of the most decent establishments out there.
“Harry's right. We just have to put a small charm on Elliot, or in Elliot's blood” Elliot groaned “And we might find their stash and maybe the attacker as well”
They had talked about
There was a groan and when Draco finally spoke, his lip was bloody "It's inside the potions' classroom. Hidden behind... the other vials"
Harry chuckled "It's fine. I like cooking... And Hermione would kill me if I had a house elf. Unless he was... Properly employed"
Hi everyone. First of all I'm sorry for how long it took, there's no way to apologize enough. Truth be told COVID was hard, and I am in healthcare so it was even harder. And even when it was not, I wasn't in the right mindset. I'm sad because this epilogue was much better in my head, it had been in me for like half the fanfic and I knew how I wanted to end it, but then things happened.
"If you are really great you could invent new ones. Some great wizards have-"
Draco reached for one of his books when realization hit him. It wasn't as clear as he wanted to and it didn't make him feel as good as he hoped. Across the room, Bell was talking to Elliot and guiding him outside of the classroom.
It was easy to panic, in a situation like this when someone places their whole trust in you, but Harry felt exhilarated. He was good thinking quickly and making choices and Draco was letting him do all of that.
Everything happened too fast after that. Harry felt one of the creatures legs touch his side and push him across the room. It hurt like all hells. His back hit a wall and he fell to the ground without really being able to move for a couple seconds. He thought he was going to die. Those two -three? four?- seconds he laid there trying to catch his breath he was convinced it was the end. The creature could simply stab him with one of its legs or breathe fire of whatever it did and he would be done.
"Leave! What's so hard about that? Everyone is upset that you are here, just leave or we will make you leave!"
Finding a piece of cloth in the dark wasn't the easiest, even if some moonlight came through the windows. Draco was about to give up and just dry his hand over his pajamas when the lights turned on, as if they had a life of their own.
"Why?"
Narcissa got up so fast Draco almost expected her wand to be raised, but of course she didn't have it. He had never seen her mother as hurt and angry as she was then. He was sure she was going to slap him, and perhaps she should, but he didn't care. He needed to say it! He needed to. He was tired of so much hypocrisy. He was tired of not knowing anyone from his extended family. True, he didn't have much family left, but... Things could have been different. Much, much different.
It was truly sad that Elliot had left the Library before Malfoy even got there because if he had been there Noah would have told him to do something. And Elliot would have listened to him, even if he hated Malfoy. He would have stopped what was happening before that auror got involved.
"Wrong"
"You know there's a chance someone is going to see you in the Tower, right?"
"I wanted to talk to you"
"Write it down?"
"Not necessarily"
Finding Hermione wasn't always easy, sometimes she would hide herself up in the library -and it was a
"Hey! Harry, I was looking for you. Is everything alright?"
"So I guess you are going to come here at night now"
Harry kissed his chest, and moved to look at him a bit better, placing his hands on either side of him. This new position got him a bit on top of Draco, but the blond didn't seem to mind. He didn't even open his eyes.
Draco tried to calm down his heartbeat, he had done it before, he could do it again.
He silently hoped they wouldn't involve aurors because... Well, it was hard to explain, but he didn't want Draco to end up in Azkaban.
There were no dementors on the train, but Harry felt as if a cold black hand touched his chest and took everything that made him happy.
"I figured" Draco smirked, his eyes going around the room. At least he had a couple couches and a fireplace.
"If he's still asleep I don't see how it would help us"
And he also wanted the auror to go the fuck away.
"Any better?" Harry asked, sitting behind him almost trapping him between his legs.
Ron nodded once, before laying his head on Hermione's shoulder for the rest of the journey.
Noah was frowning at the paper "I drew it when I woke up, it was the only thing I could remember without having a terrible headache"
"I've been thinking about this for a while now. I guess I'll keep it short... I don't want you to be an auror" Harry felt as if someone punched right at his chest, all of the air escaping from his lungs. There was something else, a strange anger bubbling inside of him. It wasn't directed at Draco, it had been there for a while, and he didn't know what to do with it.
"So, wait, are you any good at this?"
Noah wanted to stop thinking about Bea. It was obvious that she wasn't interested, and he was sure she didn't even think about him. Ever.
Great. He must look
"Fiancé"
Harry took a deep breath before opening the door to the compartment and facing his friends. They both looked as if they had been crying, and Hermione was holding one of Ron's hands with both of hers.
, or there
"Well I'm the heir, right? At least for now" He looked straight into his green eyes and shrugged "I would like to name my kid after a star or a constellation" He looked up again, the darkness of the night making his eyes look dark as well "I think it's... nice. To be able to look up and see it, up there"
There was a long silence between them, before Elliot turned and left. It took him a couple moments to realize something had changed between them. For the better.
"Ah!" Harry blushed slightly, his lips clearly kissed. With a couple wand movements Draco felt clean and fresh again, but suddenly very cold.
"Why do you think that is?" Slowly but surely Harry made sure to be in the perfect position to defend Draco if he had to. It was weird being this worried and scared and exhilarated at the same time. Maybe it was in his blood to become an auror...
"I was planning on studying, you can stay if you won't interrupt me"
"Maybe you should ask if he wants to do something first"
Draco tried not to laugh in between kisses, but Harry was clearly having a hard time with only one hand.
"We should sleep"
"No" He pulled one of her hands to his mouth and kissed it. "But you need not worry about my reasons"
Alright. He would have to say it in the middle of the corridor and he wasn't sure if Draco was going to like it, but he would have to deal with it. "Harry birthday, Draco"
"I think I... get it?"
"Uh, why? No one. I mean... I don't know"
Harry frowned.
Harry followed him to the Potions' classroom, dreading the test. Even though he really tried -and studied- he wasn't a very good student. He got good grades, but it wasn't
. They dont do that yet. And thanks to our little war, we have less powerful mages than ever. We were so stupid" he covered his eyes with both hands.
him and his Death Eater family.
"It's pointless to deny it now. Someone saw us, and it's not like they didn't suspect anything and... My parents know. So why bother?" There was silence from the Gryffindor. "But if you want to deny it..."
"Yeah, extremely boring if you ask me"
He groaned, clutching at his legs a little bit more and realized it was his turn to reveal something of himself. Great. A couple of years back he would have been appalled at the idea, but right now? What did he have to lose? A little voice in his head warned him that this was Malfoy, a Slytherin so cunning he would probably use every single piece of information from him or from any of his enemies to gain advantage in life.
"Can you walk?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Merlin, Father... Old families like ours allow... Allow
Harry stopped smiling and focused on her. Great, thought Ron, now he was going to get stressed. Really, Harry was going to get a heart attack one of these days.
"Don't you fucking touch him" Draco stared at him, and even though he was sitting just as he was, he seemed ready to jump at him.
"Just calm down" He said to himself, not quite sure as to how much time had passed. There were no sounds coming from the corridor, so he imagined he had been in there longer than expected.
"I know" Draco's fingers touched his cheek very softly, and he gave two soft kisses to his lips. "So the bedroom is upstairs, what else?"
"Potter?"
"Why do you have a plant in here?" Draco said, arching an eyebrow. He sat across from Neville, and pulled out his books, placing them carefully over the table. It had been pure luck to find him in there.
Life was good. He wanted it to stay that way.
"You have no idea what we have to do, huh?" Ron chuckled trying to figure out the recipe while Hermione gave them worrying looks.
"Why?"
hiding something - and something big by the looks of it.
Harry was quiet, only holding him close to his side "I'm happy you have them, Draco"
Thank you,
Harry nodded, speechless and a bit surprised at his words. Of course, something inside of his brain was screaming that he had never tried to appease anyone, that he didn't care about his heroics, but he knew it was a lie. Perhaps he had tried to prove he was... worth something. Perhaps he was still trying to prove it.
"We are not doing that" Harry whispered, but he wasn't sure. "We talked, we-... we are going to fix things" He gave a step forward, placing a hand on Draco's cheek "We'll fix it"
"Why? Because you were one of the good guys?" Harry almost expected Draco to pull away from the embrace, but he actually buried his face a bit more against his neck.
"I just... Hope you know I wouldn't hurt you"
Draco swallowed, wanting to say that he didn't know if he would be able to live under the same roof as them if everyday would be plagued of venomous comments and insinuations. He already felt enough shame as it was, he didn't need a repeat of the previous day.
"Professor?"
Draco shrugged, but his hand reached across the table, holding his'. "Why do you think?"
all at once, but Harry couldn't just bottle everything down and then snap at him and say those things.
"I know" His hand touched Harry's cheek, feeling the light stubble. Had he forgotten to shave that morning? "It's not what he's saying, it's just... That he's saying it at all. He's supposed to be my father, to...
"Yeah?"
She smiled, leaning in to press a soft kiss to his lips "You told me you would protect him. You said
"But you were so relaxed"
"So that's what he or she took from them"
Harry had always found strange how people went back to their everyday lives after something bad happened. He imagined no one ever truly stopped unless something bad happened to
Draco deserved only the best. This was a realization he had gotten a while ago, and something he though every time he saw him. Especially when he saw him asleep. It was the brief moments were Harry thought of all the things he wanted to do with him, and everything he wanted to give him. He wanted to show Draco the world, the real world and not the twisted version his parents had fed him. Harry wanted to take him to muggle London, show him the colorful signs, the shops, the pubs, everything.
Harry turned around because not doing so would be foolish, she was already there and things were only going to get worse before they could get any better.
Nothing left now but to wait.
“Ah, bless. I remember the day we got together.” Fred grinned nostalgically.
“Oi, watch it!” the unknown Hufflepuff hissed.
“I…” He struggled with the surge of emotion welling up inside of him. “Thank you. That really means a lot.”
“It might just be the leather.” Draco allowed. “You’d look devastating in a leather jacket.”
“Exactly!" Harry grinned. "You don’t have to worry about any of that though, I can handle that part. You just have fun.”
“What?”
This was all Harry’s fault.
“How did she get a hold of Polyjuice potion in second year?” Draco was astonished. It should have been impossible for a second year to access Polyjuice potion. He’d tried.
“Alright Nott, spill it.” She growled.
Merlin, Malfoy was big.
“I remember the beard it gave him,” Blaise smirked. “bless him for fleeing to the common room instead of the hospital wing. I would have been loath to have missed that!”
“That’s what I’m counting on.” Harry whispered, emerald eyes searching for answers to unasked questions.
“Draco, take this scum out to the courtyard. If you’re too gutless to finish them, leave them for me to deal with later.” She hissed.
“And Blaise is too self-obsessed to notice.” Pansy chimed in.
“I accept the charges.” Lucius seemed to pale at the admission.
Theo shot everyone a long-suffering look as she dragged him away.
“Enough. He said he doesn’t recognize them. He has no reason to lie.” he threw Aunt Bella away from them before straightening his robes with as much dignity as he could muster. “Let us not forget who the enemy is, here.”
“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade to keep an eye on things. I didn’t see you get off the train with your friends so I started to worry.” She kept her gaze straight ahead as they started down the carriage-carved path. “When the last carriage left for Hogwarts and I still hadn’t seen you I hopped on board and started combing each compartment. I figured you must be hiding under your cloak or something so I tried summoning it.”
Why did it feel like the world was ending just because he wouldn’t be seeing Draco anymore? An agonizing silence ensued while Harry wrestled with his emotions. Draco was the first to break it.
“Really? That would be awesome.” Harry was taken aback by the thoughtfulness of the gesture.
That wasn’t home either.
"I'm glad." She touched his elbow affectionately. "Have you seen Harry? I wanted to give him a pair of tickets too."
“I never said it was! But you can trust us, we are on your side. Everyone in this room has been fighting! We’ve all been driven here by the Carrows hunting us down. We’re loyal to you- to Dumbledore!”
“SECTUMSEMPRA!” Harry bellowed.
“I suppose.” Draco pursed his lips with a guilty expression.
“Where are you going?” Ron called after him. He was already halfway down the lane that led to the shrieking shack before he turned back to wave at them.
“But I-”

“I did what I could with the shoddy subject matter I was given to work with.” George sighed dramatically, only cracking a grin when Harry elbowed him in the ribs.
Draco was marked. There was no atonement for him.
“Pans, your choreography is perfect, your dancing is perfect, and this ballet is going to be perfect.” Harry chuckled, tugging affectionately on her ponytail when she looked like she was about to argue. “Chill out, you worry too much.”
They discussed his mother’s job as a Criminal Profiler, the juicy drama circulating her precinct, and the petty dramas that were affecting their prospective friend groups over the next few hours. She even remembered to ask about his book series and he happily informed her he was just starting the third installment. She never had time to read anymore and it used to be one of her favorite hobbies. Draco took to telling her about whatever he was reading so she could vicariously enjoy the story too. He loved sharing his favorite stories with her. It somehow felt like it made them closer. Draco was gratified by her gasp of shock when he revealed the big plot twist at the end of the second book.
He wasn’t sure why, but he detested change. New was daunting, there were too many unknowns. He’d had quite enough of uncertainty during the war- everything was constantly changing. There was no normal, no routine- and that’s exactly what Harry had grown to love. He braced himself for the worst and took a hesitant sip of Draco’s drink. Sweet and bitter flavors combined to create a unique taste that wasn’t half bad.
“Sod off.” She arched an eyebrow at him. “How long have you been in love with Draco and why didn’t you bloody tell me?”
“Brave Master Regulus was the most honorable resident of the Ancient and Noble House of Black.” He intoned.
Deathly cold torrents flooded the chasm of his soul as a vision of Sirius falling, his last laugh still etched onto his handsome features played over and over again in his mind.
“Can do. What name should I save it under?” He asked genially, grabbing a notepad and a pen.
“That’s probably a good idea.” Harry called, already disappearing through the archway.
“Don’t mention it. She was out of line.” The woman waved him off. “I don’t agree with your choices either, but I won’t deny you your right to make them.”
“Come off it, what happened? Did Harry cancel on you?” She crossed the room and studied his face.
“Go on then, tell me off. Tell me how wonderful and flawless your life is and how hard it is to be perfect.” She challenged.
A mixture of emotions flashed across Draco’s face before he burst out laughing.
“Blimey, do you think it will work after that fire?” Ron glanced back at the now blank stretch of wall. “Should we split up and look for her?”
“Mmm...that feels nice.” Draco hummed softly.
“She’s good at that.” Draco grinned.
"You bet your arse I was. I even ran away to your dad's." He laughed. It was like a switch flipped in his brain and his face progressed from happy to horrified in .2 seconds. "Harry- Lily's sister and them… they're not...are they... abusing you?"
“Maybe we could write it on the walls. You know, chamber of secrets style? The whole school saw that! And it stayed up all year.” Blaise retorted.
Harry couldn’t be dead. He just couldn’t.
"What about seeing Potter in all of his Quidditch gear?" Theo elbowed him in the ribs.  "It would be a damn shame to miss that, eh?"
Pansy caught Theo’s eye and gave him a meaningful look before getting up and walking out into the entrance hall.
“They barely gave me enough food to survive, let alone treats.” He grimaced, looking back down at his hands. “There was this one time Mrs. Figg had broken her ankle or something and couldn’t watch me on Dudley’s birthday so I got to go to the zoo with them. They bought Dudley and his friend great big knickerbocker sundaes and the lady behind the counter had asked me what I wanted before they could shoo me away so I got a lemon ice pop out of the deal. That was the closest thing I think I ever had to ice cream until I got to Hogwarts.”
Draco slowly released his grip on the plexiglass, flailing slightly when one of his feet tried to slip out from underneath him. He caught his balance and turned to beam at Harry.
Harry didn’t reply.
“Why is that?” Harry’s thoughts strayed to Sirius and how much he hated being a Black. He had thought it was just because Sirius’s parents were blood purists, but the way Draco said that made him start to wonder.
He tried to open his eyes but his eyelids refused to cooperate.
“Fair enough.” Harry chuckled.
“We’re his army!” Neville cried in outrage “Dumbledore’s Army! We’re all in it together. We’ve been keeping it together while you’ve been off on your own-”
“Off the record?” Bill regarded him curiously. “Consider me intrigued.”
“Will you stay?” Draco’s voice was shaky, but when he pulled back to look up at Harry his silver eyes were set with determination.

Harry shuffled through the other loose bits of parchment and sketching paper, drinking in picture after astonishingly detailed picture. They were mostly of him, more often without his friends than with, and a couple of Pansy and the other Slytherins.
“I sent him an owl yesterday though. He should have responded by now, even if it was just to tell me to sod off.” Draco huffed, tracing the flow of the grain on his kitchen table while Hermione sipped her tea.
He set the bottle down on a convenient end table before being pulled into a formal dining room. Everything turned into a blur of voices and hands grabbing at him and he lost track of time. Whenever he thought he was almost free more people seemed to pour in to regale him with their war stories and to shake his hand. The whiskey thundering through his veins enabled him to smile and give bland responses instead of screaming. Just when he thought his head might explode from all of the pressure to play the friendly hero there was a brief lull.
Draco’s hand was shaking. He didn’t even try to stop it.
Blaise struck an imposing figure in his form-fitting t-shirt that accentuated his biceps. He still had his dreadlocks gathered in a tight knot on the top of his head from practice, highlighting the intimidating cut of his jaw and his hazel eyes were blazing with fury. He had pushed Luna behind him, shielding her with a defensive stance from the volatile man in front of them.
"Andi, Teddy, this is my boyfriend Draco Malfoy." Harry immediately stood to take Teddy from Andromeda, kissing his hair.
“That’s quite alright.” Hermione said calmly and Pansy wished with all her heart she could become invisible.
"You wouldn't dare!"
Harry rolled his eyes then set the bundle down on the table and looked at Draco expectantly.
"Oh yes please!" Draco said eagerly.
"So you like it? If not I can um- return it." Harry said meekly.
Draco took a tentative hand and peeked inside the bundle then froze.
Harry rushed up to the castle and straight to library where he had said he'd meet Draco the previous day.
Harry had woken up early that morning to ready his surprise for his beautiful boyfriend Draco.
"All ready" Hagrid said handing the bundle to Harry gingerly. "Yer want some tea before ye go?" Hagrid added.
After a moment Hagrid's opened it and said "Mornin' Harry. You come Fer the package?"
First thing he had to do though was to down to Hagrid's hut where Hagrid had let him keep Draco's gift.
They both laughed as the kitten squirmed in between them seemingly demanding attention.
Within a few minutes Draco had strode into the library and quickly spotted Harry.
When he arrived he knocked quickly on Hagrid's door and waited.
"So very eager, maybe I should make you wait just for the suspense" Harry teased.
"Tell Draco I said happy birthday" Hagrid said kindly.
Harry just smiled back and said "I got you a gift. You want it now?"
"I love it. Oh I love it Harry!" Draco said and he turned to Harry and kissed him softly and then a little more passionately until a little fury head peeked through their arms and started meowing.
She drops the wand but her knuckles still clench tightly around it. “Let me know on the hex,” she says to Harry before stepping back.
Draco reached for the hem of his shirt.
Now, Draco had sucked cock before. He hadn’t just been sitting around pining after Potter for two (nine) years or something ridiculous like that. But he’d always wondered about Potter’s cock. Potter’s cock sucking skills had popped into his head the first time he’d
to know the answer to. “Does it hurt?”
Happy reading! :)
“Just
“The answer is that they are all as likely as each other. We have no idea how asphodel root will choose to react with the ingredient. There is no pattern to it. Like I said, no formula.”
Shit. Malfoy hadn’t meant to say anything. How had that even come out of his mouth? And he certainly hadn’t expected Potter to stop. Shit. Potter was looking at him expectantly. Draco found himself trapped between the way he wanted to act and how he was supposed to act around Harry Potter. He hadn’t felt like that since the day he - wait. “What day is it?”
“Nothing! It’s not me!”
Potter didn’t even hesitate. “Remember when you sucked -“
Of course, this is when Harry loses his shit because Malfoy knows. Of course, he knows. Why the fuck would anyone come up to someone THEY NEVER SPEAK TO and ask, “Late Night?” unless they know that person is dreaming of them in a sexual manner every night and in just the most recent night jerked off to a memory of it and even moaned their name? No one. Ever. There is no other reason to say such a thing.
After a myriad of tosses and turns, Harry notices Ron roll over to face him. “Why are you still awake?” He whispers.
Relieved, Draco lets himself smile. No hospital tonight. “Don’t worry Potter, I’ll behave myself. I can be
Hermione stood up, making a show of assessing each member of the circle.
Malfoy’s eyes glinted. “A special one for me? Now I’m really sad you ruined it,” he said, pulling out his wand.
Pans?” Now he
you doing?”
Potter didn’t like that. He pushed his mug away with more force than strictly necessary. “You’re a real asshole, you know?”
He caught movement in the glass and quickly dropped his hair, turning his face down to his table, but straining his eyes up to watch - it was Potter, coffee in hand, heading towards the entrance, eyes fixed ahead, not even acknowledging Draco in the slightest.
Don’t stop,” he said to Draco. Distraction or not, being kissed on the neck was a particular weakness of his, and he wasn’t about to give it up that easily.
That unsettled Draco. Potter was supposed to bite back with something witty, something to fuel the fight. Not - do whatever the hell he was doing now. Still, Draco kept his cool.
Harry’s hands stopped him. “You don’t have– ”
Harry’s eyes flickered between the batches of cupcakes baking in six different ovens while he mixed the next round of batter in a heavy glass bowl. “Three hundred and sixteen.”
There was a part of Draco that was glad every time one of his tests failed. Another, less brave part, the bigger part of him, was terrified. Petrified. He had to make it work. Failure was not an option. Failure was death.
Harry looks back to Malfoy who has lost the advantage with his two opponents. One holds his arms behind his back while the other holds onto his hair, jerking his head to the side and– shit. He’s going to
“P– Harry,” he started, but what else was there to say?
“You don’t know,” Draco just repeats over and over again. He drops his shirt and slides to the floor of the closet, not looking at Harry. His face scrunches up violently. “You don’t know.”
“Are you doing that?” Draco asked, looking back up at Harry for an answer.
“Ah yes, you’re finally here, m’boy. Dreadful business detention, isn’t it? I’ll be glad to see you out the door in an hour. You’ll be reordering the supply cupboard today.” He gestures to the open cupboard door. “Your peer has already made a start.” His nose scrunches unfavourably at the mention of Malfoy.
Harry recognised the voice instantly but he still held his breath as Percy stepped back and the new Minister walked into the house. He’d traded in green robes for sleek black ones and his trademark hair was hidden under a tight black beret but those grey eyes and pointy chin were unmistakeable.
The phone stopped buzzing.
Harry pulled down the sleeve of his - well, Draco’s - sweater. It was chilly. But he wasn’t quite ready to go inside yet. Teddy had been trying out his new broomstick for hours and Harry didn’t have the heart to tell him to stop. Not when his eyes were so wide with childish delight, not when he kept calling out: “Look daddy, look at me!” with those big beautiful smiles.
Harry watches Hermione’s notetaking with a strange distance. He had almost forgotten Malfoy was a case and not…not…He stops himself from thinking anything further. "Malfoy says it’s under control,” he says.
“Oh for merlin’s sake,” interrupts Potter, his face reddening again, although Draco suspects it might be more in anger than embarrassment this time.
Harry hesitates. He isn’t sure Ron has pieced together his rather obvious feelings for Malfoy yet. “I kissed Dra – Malfoy.”
the one who asked me on a date,” Potter says, looking quite indignant as he does.
“You had plenty to say the other night,” Harry said, hoping to goad something more out of Draco. He had come on to Harry more than once, after all.
The familiar tinkering of a bell drew Harry’s eyes straight back to the door, but it was only a couple leaving, hands tightly intertwined. Harry turned back to Malfoy to notice his eyes glued to the door as well. There was a tightness in Harry’s chest he couldn’t quite recognise yet.
“And I’m sure Narcissa Malfoy will enjoy a visit from the person who put her husband away,” Hermione says.
soon, she’s going to lose interest.”
“I am not–” Malfoy objects but Harry is already pulling him under. “At least give me my wand back,” Malfoy whispers.
“And then they lead up to those five offshoots there?” Draco traced the pattern with his hand.
It might have been the firewhisky talking – who was Harry kidding? – but Malfoy’s gaze was hypnotic. Harry chuckled weakly.
“Was not!” Dean argued, his face bright red. “Seamus made up that rumour.”
“Excuse me?” Draco whispered, staring at Harry strangely.
, but he wasn’t able to help us.”
Harry watches Malfoy’s eyebrow descend back down his pale face. Their faces are really very close.  Harry can see every small detail, like the way Malfoy tightens and relaxes his jaw repeatedly and the way his eyes dart frantically over Harry’s face as if he is looking him over in just the same way. Harry looks away, suddenly uncomfortable. “Why are you here?” He asks to his lap.
“From you?” Harry pretended to think. “Oh nothing. I’m just standing here.” He had been going for a walk of the grounds, but standing put here, irritating Malfoy, was a much better option.
“Let’s call it even.”
Potter made a small sound like he wanted to laugh but was holding back. “You know what I mean.”
“Minister, may I introduce you to Healer Malfoy?” Potter said politely, addressing the woman beside him that Draco had failed to notice. He turned to Draco. “Healer Malfoy, I trust you know the Minister for Magic, Clarissa Jones?”
When Potter stopped laughing, he seemed to finally find his words from earlier. “You should sit with us.”
And far worse, Potter wasn’t here. The day Draco had been dreaming about for months wasn’t the salvation he thought it would be. But talking to Potter, at least, renewed Draco’s hope.  Yes, Potter wasn’t back. But he was alive. And there was no doubt that he would come eventually. Horny teenager or not, Harry Potter always saved the day.
Malfoy smiles at Zabini. “Thank you.”
“I like your hands.”
Luckily, Potter didn’t seem too concerned about the champagne either. At least, when Draco pressed up against him, it was clear there were...other thoughts on his mind. Other thoughts that stretched his robe just a little in the front.
“He has a soft side too,” Malfoy says, looking up now, his eyes innocent enough to almost convince Harry.
waiting.” Potter dropped his gaze, and his Auror likeness along with it. “You never returned the favour, you know?”
“You’re not –“
“Wait, what are you - “
Now, Harry wastes no time in yanking those underwear down so he can finally, FINALLY see – oh. Harry thought he was ready for this, he has imagined it so many times, but nothing compares to actually seeing Draco’s Malfoy cock in the flesh…at least in vivid dream flesh. Harry just…he wants to touch it, he wants to fucking taste it. But he’s frozen. Frozen just staring at Malfoy’s dick. Can you imagine if this was happening in real life and not a dream? It would be humiliating.

Except the closer he got Potter to the edge, the more
Harry’s pauses in front of Kingsley’s desk. He puts on his sincere, noble face. The one that makes Kingsley give in to him every time. “If he’s really guilty of anything, I’ll have no hesitation bringing him in,” he says honestly. "But to put someone in the field who already believes he’s guilty before any proof? That’s dangerous. Hermione and I are the only Auror team here who will give him a fair chance.”
Harry wondered what Draco would think if he knew Harry had been comparing their morning to muggle movies. He smiled, realising Draco made quite the unconventional heroine.
Harry stands up quickly, his heart pounding in his ears. He hardly feels it when Hermione puts a hand on his shoulder.
Draco smirked. “Oh no. I don’t claim to be. I’m going to hold this over your head forever.”
“There he is right – hang on. What does that mean?”
Harry shivers, but whether it’s from the wind or nerves he cannot tell. He waits for Draco to say something, to explain, but nothing is forthcoming. Harry grits his teeth. Again, he tries to start with something easy. At least comparatively.
“About my recovery. Since you’re checking up on me and all.”
potion?” Malfoy’s eyes dart across his own body, from his exposed ankles to the open button at his collar where the potion has leaked beneath his shirt. He jerks his head back up. “Are you trying to
“Good. Then I’ll see you next week.”
Oh merlin, he
“I’m not leaving without answers,” Harry asserts, although his delivery is a little marred by the fact he can’t even say it to Malfoy’s face. Merlin. What is wrong with him? Why can’t he just lift his head?
is going on?
Harry watched on, horrified. Not only was he forcing Malfoy to show his Dark Mark, something he had kept hidden so well no one had ever seen it, but he was also forcing him to strip to his underwear in front of the entire eighth year.
Potter took Draco’s cock in his mouth and started a fast rhythm quickly, one that was bound to have him coming soon. Potter enthusiasm for Draco to come on his face was obvious. And hot. Did he mention hot? And now Potter was making noises that Draco could feel from the tip of his cock to the back of his neck, and -
“Please don’t say anything, Harry,” interrupts Draco once more. “It’s just going to make this harder. Just let me…I need to tell you something before they cure me. It’s important.” Draco’s eyes are wet now, and staring into Harry’s intently. ”He’s…I mean I’m going to tell you it’s not true, but I like you, Harry. I’ve always liked you. Before all of this. I don’t want to live the way I do. I’m scared and stupid and a coward, but you can help me, Harry. Maybe, I’d do it for you, Harry.”
The sly smile becomes genuine. “I am, thank you.” Potter leans forwards in his seat slightly. ”So, what year did you – “
“Until you’re cured?”
Of course. Who else is there to blame?
Malfoy stared at it for a second, his eyes wide. “My, my, Potter. This
“It’s not that simple.”
As soon as the two women disappear around the corner, Malfoy jumps out from the cloak, heading straight for the disguised wall. He taps his head with his wand and reactivates his disillusionment charm. Harry lunges for Malfoy’s shoulder and grabs it just before it disappears.
Harry pulls off his invisibility cloak and steps in front of her, ignoring Malfoy’s panicked whispers behind him.
Malfoy’s eyes narrow and he holds out the hand without Floo powder. “Give me your wand.”
“How did you–”
He knew exactly whose laughter and exactly where from. There was no need to look up. But as always, he did.
Draco snorted at Potter’s dramatics. But he could sympathise.
“Absolutely not.” Harry rolled away from Malfoy. He was tired. And he wanted to finish his dream.
And then those lips actually started sucking. And Draco lost control of all his motor functions. At least that was the only explanation for the excruciatingly
“You didn’t want to listen to my news earlier. Kingsley’s retiring.”
“Who is – “ Harry tries to ask, wondering if by him, Draco means his father, Lucius Malfoy.
“It’s not my tongue you need to– “ George trailed off under his mother’s glare.
“After the whole school watches me destroy you at every Quidditch match this year,” Power elaborated, mimicking Draco’s smirk (except with far less style of course), “do you really think they’re going to believe you could ever beat me?”
He returns a short time later with his hands outstretched. He’s holding a green apple. A single green apple. Draco stares at it.
Harry looks up. “What?”
Hermione fixes them both with a deathly stare that is probably not dissimilar to the one a Basilisk uses to petrify its victims.  “That was before he tried to hurt you both,” she says seriously.
“You hate the sun.”
He was certain it was at least partially (if not completely) in his head that everyone was watching them leave with knowing eyes. Not that they were going to, you know, do anything. Draco wasn’t really sure of Potter’s intentions. Although if Potter were to initiate anything, Draco wasn’t confident he’d want to reject him. Which was strange. He hadn’t any desire to be with anyone else since Blaise. But, as Pansy kept telling him, it was about time.
Malfoy blinks slowly. Once. Twice. Five painfully slow times before he answers. “No. Should I?”
“Harry, are you
“And what is this?”
Now in all his readings he couldn’t find an instance of wizards or witches who shared wands having a connection where they watched each other masturbate – those texts might be in the restricted section. But he did find many instances of a wand that remained in allegiance to two people, allowing those people to connect almost spiritually so that they could remain in contact even when apart. And the way it was described, inhabiting a physical body but usually accessed via dreaming, seeming a lot like the way he’s been seeing Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for

Draco fiddled with the buttons at the neck of his dress robe.  He looked good. He
way? I didn’t realise your daddy owned the footpaths.”
“Unless you what?”
Malfoy grins slyly. “Potter, back to breaking the rules, at last.”
“What was that?”
Draco drew his eyes up from Potter’s jaw - had that widened as well? No, Draco was reading into things now. He hadn’t seen Potter in months. Not since the end of school. A lot had changed, but plenty hadn’t. The hair - that made Draco feel slightly better about his own - so untamed and unpredictable, never committing to a single part line, the smile, cheeky and knowing and above all, warm, and those eyes, just as piercing and still framed by those boyish round glasses.
“One question, Potter.
Harry returns his attention to stroking Malfoy’s stomach while he assesses the remaining cut on Malfoy’s chest. It’s not as deep here so he hopes, for Malfoy’s sake, that it doesn’t hurt as much. He lifts the bottle around Malfoy and, carefully this time, lets a single drop fall onto the wound.
“I have an informant willing to tell you everything you need to know about a conspiracy to attack the Ministry of Magic on the full moon. You can have all the credit. The Minister herself is bound to take notice.”
“Indeed. If – “
“Truth or dare?”
Draco, but how can he even be sure that Draco is in the room with him right now?
can anyone
Draco scanned the room as an excuse not to meet Potter’s eye. “Well, I certainly hope so. You were on duty this morning. If you were just standing around doing nothing, then I can only imagine the fate of your patients.”
he did,” Draco continued, trying to play it cool - at least, as much as possible under the circumstances. “He was giving me a bloody hickey for merlin’s sake!” He wanted to add that Potter could have been a goblin and the outcome would still be the same, but the veritaserum wouldn’t let him exaggerate quite that far.
Inside, the room is the same as Harry’s last visit. Small space, smaller bed. The walls are bare except for a tall fireplace squished in behind the bed. Even the exploding snap cards remain in the middle of the bed where Harry had left them last. Which can’t be right of course. Malfoy must have moved them when he slept and then returned them there. Which is also odd. Who else does Malfoy have to play exploding snap with? Harry thought he was the only one who knew about his place, apart from Ron and Hermione…and Blaise. But Blaise and Malfoy couldn’t be seeing each other again? Could they?
“So you
“Chummy?” Draco repeated. “They’re my friends, Harry. Of course we’re
He could hear the stupid creature - it almost sounded like it was laughing at him - but he couldn’t see it. Where was the damn thing? He cast stunning spells around the cabin recklessly, waiting for the stupid noise to stop so he could rescue his pin. But no matter where he cast, the creature’s laughter continued.
you’ve finished your potions.”
Although perhaps he’d gone a little far because Potter’s face twisted into uncertainty for the first time. “Malfoy, if you don’t want to, that’s fi - “
“Clothes.”
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. “Of course. Verity–” a woman appears at Malfoy’s side immediately “–please take Mr. Potter’s coat and show him to the sitting room.”
“We should get Hermione,” interrupts Ron.
Wondering why I’m still writing to you,
Draco meant to warn Potter but his impending orgasm left his words a little garbled.  “I’m - Potter - yes - on - Potter - yes.”
Although his face remains etched in confusion, Harry reaches for the phone and brings it to his ear. “Hi Pansy,” he says, his tone cautious. Rightly so when you’re dealing with Pansy.
They visit the library every night after class. Harry would much rather be visiting Malfoy’s dorm every night. Which taken out of context, is a little disturbing. But he has to know if Malfoy actually sleeps there or not, and if not, where he goes at night. The unmade bed Harry witnessed when he woke up in Malfoy’s room last week
Draco darted into an empty classroom and locked the door.
Harry’s in Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office in seconds. He doesn’t bother to knock. “What have you found out about him? Who have you assigned to investigate?”
Harry senses the finality in Hermione’s voice. He turns away with a shrug. He isn’t sure what to believe. But after so many weeks in the dark, it can’t hurt to have more answers. And if one of the Draco Malfoys is going to explain, then he’s eager to listen. But he can’t promise anything more than that.
Draco could tell Potter was close because he had picked up his pace and his pants had become heavier. His dark eyes were on Draco’s as he rocked back and forth, his expression alone egging Draco’s own orgasm along. But it still seemed like Potter would be the one to get there first.
Malfoy is interrupted by three simultaneous voices.
Harry sees Draco Malfoy’s scars every day now. They don’t bother him as much as they used to but of course he’ll never be truly rid of the guilt. It may sit dormant inside his chest but the remaining weight of it will be with him forever.
“I’m not,” Draco says, gripping onto the bar top tightly to balance himself on his stool.
Harry presented the coffee to their first customer, a man who showed the signs of creeping impatience. Harry put on his best smile as he handed over the cup. “I’m deeply sorry for the wait, sir. I hope you have a great day.”
Something is seriously wrong with Draco Malfoy.
Harry can see Hermione becoming agitated.
“Who’s there?” calls out Malfoy as he starts to walk towards Harry’s pillar.
Draco didn’t have time to play coy tonight. He made a beeline straight for Potter, only pausing to receive two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter. Potter looked up as Draco approached, narrowing his eyes at the glasses.
Blaise looked as polished as ever, from his tailored paisley suit to his immaculately applied eyebrow liner. He returned Draco’s smile, flashing his surgically whitened teeth. “I could hardly miss the event of the season now, could I, Draco?”
Harry gulps. This shouldn’t be arousing. “If you’re not an alpha, then why are you being so aggressive?”
The Malfoy by Harry sighs and turns to the intruders, wand raised to them, but keeping the knife in place. “I just asked for one day in peace. One fucking day to work out how to fucking kill you. Is that so fucking hard?”
“No, don’t– ”
And he’s even more confused when the smirk drops, and
Seconds from collision, Harry jerked his broom up, halting his trajectory as Malfoy did the same. They ended up, faces barely an inch from each other, their gloved hands brushing each other’s knuckles where they gripped their brooms. They stared at one another a moment, both panting, until Malfoy broke into a grin.
“I don’t,” Draco said quickly. He was just making a point for merlin’s sake - did Potter have to be so…so…urgh.
Teddy screamed in glee and ran while Draco chased him around the yard, slowing his pace to allow Teddy to evade his clutches a few times until: “Gotcha!”
drinking it would be telling in itself.
“Oh.” Draco suddenly realises he has completely dropped his disguise of indifference. Asking Potter to spend a third night in a row with him, and the fourth night over the course of less than a week is desperate. And sad.
Thankfully, Potter didn’t have a retort for that. It was better when Draco got the last word. Except right now he didn’t really have the option for a dramatic exit, since he’d committed to tea and also, you know, it was
“Should we try this again?” Draco asked. He accepted the glass of champagne from Potter and held out his other hand. “Draco Malfoy.”
“This is
“Malfoy,” Harry whispers into the empty space, “Are you there?”
“Bloody hell,” Ron said, poking his head into the kitchen. “How many cupcakes are you making?”
He knows (okay, he hopes) if he can just get Draco, Malfoy, alone, he might be able to find
At the thought of Potter coming in the position they were in, Draco was reminded of their phone call the previous year. He’d been so humiliated by all the things he had said but here, now, with the same horniness in possession of his mind, Draco thought that perhaps they’d had some great ideas that night. And Draco hadn’t forgotten that Potter had wanted to come on him. That had starred in plenty of following masturbation fantasies. And right now, it seemed like the fantasy might actually come true.
“You’re awfully eager to visit my apartment, Potter. Are you sure it’s
Potter started pulling his pants up, barely a second after his cock popped from Draco’s mouth. His come was still trickling down Draco’s throat and he was
But Draco could be brave too, right? He’d proved that in the field as an auror many times. Although those times, Harry had never been staring at him as intensely he was now.
“Yes, what a surprise we’re both at an event our whole division was invited to,” Draco responded as drily as he could manage. He was not doing this again. Not tonight. Not here.
Harry isn’t sure where to look. He wants to look at Draco,
“If you can really mean it,” Harry challenges. He regrets it a little when Malfoy takes a step towards him, his face reddening in anger. He really needs to learn to tone it down on the sass when he is the one tied up and wandless.
“You don’t look like you’re playing Quidditch.”
“Is everything alright, mate?”
“I dare you– ” he started again. The room was getting impatient now, but Malfoy’s intensity held. What could he possibly ask?
