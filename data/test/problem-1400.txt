“Draco,” Draco told him, realizing he hadn’t introduced himself.
“Yeah. The spoiled heir to the Slytherin Kingdom,” he snorted in response.
Draco settled next to his friend on the bench. “So…where did the outfit come from? It’s…” Well, frankly, it was gorgeous. And it suited Harry’s looks. It was a tabard made of black velvet, and was trimmed in gold with leggings and even boots to match. Harry's outfit was almost a dark version of Draco's. And it suited him at least as well as Draco’s own hand-made robes. “You look…wonderful.” True, Draco had always admired Harry in his leathers, but still…the effect was enough to make him almost forget that Harry couldn’t be the one he chose.
“Yes. But apparently I neglected to teach you one thing—that even kings must have humility.”
The kiss didn’t stop until they heard an angry shout from across the garden. A shout from a very familiar, and rather horrified voice. “Draco! What are you…! Dear god!”
He was dishing out a bowl for himself when Potter entered, taking the bowl from him and taking a careful bite, then smiling at the taste. “Now this is more like it!” he said with a grin.
Draco looked up, surprised, and saw Harry was holding out his hand. Draco's world was suddenly spun around on its axis, and everything he'd known before stepping into this room today was turned on its head.
Harry looked up from the bench he was sitting on, an abstracted look on his face. “Draco…” He stood. “This was a bad idea. I should go.”
“No! I have put up with your tantrums and insults to our guests long enough. You will marry who I say. And I say you will marry the next man to come through those doors, be he peasant or king.”
Draco sighed, then nodded. Hopefully by tomorrow, Harry would have rescued him. He had to hope for that now. "I will see you then?"
It was simply too much of a temptation for Draco to say no. “All right.” He smiled. “Thank you.” He moved to the road, where the horse was grazing, approaching it slowly, watching carefully until he was sure the horse would accept a touch. He couldn’t help but wish he had an apple to offer the beast. The horses at home had always been fond of apples. “You’re a good beast, aren’t you?” he murmured.
"You would?"
Harry frowned at him for a long time, and Draco could tell he was trying hard to remember. "Well, there was a visit to Brighton once. But I spent almost all of that holiday in my room. My aunt said I'd pushed Dudley into the water… or something." He winced and put a hand to his temple.
Narcissa gave Harriet a long look, then nodded as well. “At least she cleans up well.”
Potter shrugged. “Because I can.”
Why it was so important to him Harry remember their day together, Draco couldn't have said, but he felt desperate for him to know he hadn't always been the boy Harry remembered from school.
"You don't remember?" It was worse than being called Malfoy.
Draco looked up at him, and now that he remembered, everything felt different. He stood and moved to the bars, causing Harry to pull away. "What are you up to, Malfoy?"
This time, it was Harry’s turn to blush, and Draco raised an eyebrow as Harry turned away. “Wasn’t so bad,” he heard him mutter.
“I don’t want to hurt you, Draco…”
"Oh, nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about," she said, continuing with the same evil grin.
"No. I’ve never known anything but this tower and her and…Fenny." For some reason, saying the man’s true name scared Draco, so all he could manage was the nickname the witch had given him.
The man holding him was silent for a moment, then slapped Draco. "You're a fucking idiot, you know that?" He stood, and Draco tried to catch his arm, but the man pulled away before he could. "Next time, I'll let you die, bloody snake. If this is what helping you gets me…"
"Then perhaps we should listen what they wish to say for themselves, don't you?"
The thought brought Draco up short. He glanced at Dumbledore, then at Sirius and Remus, who were ribbing each other good-naturedly, and then at Harry, who was smiling at the display. Dumbledore had said, hadn’t he, that what he needed was a friend? And that maybe Harry could be that friend? The more Draco thought about it, the more he realized that the wizard might have been purposefully nudging him in this direction.
“Right,” Draco snorted. “Like that would happen. Likely I’ll have some boring power that will help me with paperwork.”
Harry blinked at him for a moment before answering. “Uh…sure. So…Blaise said that this shouldn’t take too long?”
Moony put a hand on Padfoot’s shoulder. “No…wait, Sirius. Look at him. He looks as startled as we are. I don’t think he knew he could do that…Like…he’s new to the form.” He shot a pointed look at the other man.
“What? I don’t know what you want, Draco. Are you okay?”
"I don't care. It's worth it. Even for one more." Because he needed to know, even if it meant the other boy would hate him.
Though he struggled to return to his dreams, he found it hard to sleep in the days that followed. Perhaps he'd slept too much. Instead, he began exercising and organizing the house, moving the books from shelf to shelf, rearranging them in alphabetical order, then again by size.
“No.”
Potter put the lot on his back, then started out the gate once more. Draco sighed, then turned into the house to see what he could find.
"I am still not satisfied."
“Aw, lay off him, Cissa. Can’t you see the kid is just tired? Give him a break.”
He wasn't sure what to expect at first, but she was nothing like what he'd always been led to believe. She was highly intelligent, witty, and even sly when it came right down to it. Though Draco wanted to hate her, he found himself strongly reminded of his mother.
He was quick to move into the room adjoining Draco’s. Draco still wasn’t sure why his mother had insisted upon that room. After all, there was another on the other side of his room that would have done as well. And it didn’t have a door that opened into Draco’s room at all. Surely his privacy was at least as important as making Potter happy?
“Too late, mother. You agreed. Formally. In front of witnesses. Harry and I will marry come the midsummer holiday, and he and I will take over the kingdom.”
The boys talk some more, and Harry convinces Draco to continue
“You…don’t want them to know? But…your birthday…”
Draco shook his head. He hadn’t meant to upset the last one. He’d just been so frustrated by the whole process that he’d reacted naturally.
Potter laughed. “I didn’t. She approached me. I mean…after I moved in. She asked my intentions, and…apparently she liked what I told her.”
Harry stayed silent for a long time before answering. “We were kids, Draco. I’d say…a few things have changed since then. At least…I’d like to think so.”
Horrified, Draco nearly found himself sitting down in the puddle once more, his legs went so weak with shock. “So this was all just…what? Your way of getting back at me?” Even as he spoke, anger began to take hold. Draco was trembling slightly, thinking of all the things Potter had forced him to do. “You…bastard!” He shoved at the man, but Potter stepped back, not wanting to muss his own clothes, obviously, and Draco growled. “As soon as my father appears, I’m leaving. I don’t care what he says!”
"Harry?" he asked, his voice trembling, his arms aching as he felt the window somehow pushing him back into the room. Bella’s spell. It had to be!
His son, Draco, was not too pleased with this proclamation, feeling he was too young to marry just yet, and swore to himself and his closest friends that he would never marry if he could help it.
“Look at that one, Harry,” Ginny is saying, pointing at a long, white gown in a shop window. “Wouldn’t I be spectacular in that?”
“And how do you know? Do you know this boy? For all you know, it is. Perhaps what Draco truly needs is a friend.”
When Draco finished, Potter was staring at him as though he had a horn growing from his head. "So…wait…your father trusted
After Shacklebolt left, Harry stared at Draco for a long time, and Draco's skin itched from restraining himself. He was about to explode when Harry finally spoke. "I went to see my aunt last night. She told me the reason I stayed in my room in Brighton was because I'd pushed Dudley into the ocean."
Draco flushed when he realized what Potter was implying. “I didn’t!” Even as he denied it, though, he could feel the stickiness in his pants.
Before he could say more, Fenrir was over him, his grin echoing the one Bella had used. "Let me do it, Bella. He’ll never think of leaving you then…"
It was so peaceful. Harry scratching at his head, the hum of their voices, the soft cloth of Harry’s robe under his scales… Draco snuffled a bit, his eyes closing in pleasure. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this relaxed. And it was all because of Harry.
However, before Draco could respond, a great clattering sound came from the courtyard. “What in the world is that din?” He stood and moved to the window and gazed out to see what had happened. What he saw made his heart leap in his chest. “He’s back.”
"There's an original comeback." Draco turned away and settled on his bunk once more, watching the two friends as they talked softly. He caught a few words, particularly the Weasel's name, but held his tongue. After all, getting Harry angry about his best friend wasn't likely to get Draco on his good side now.
Draco shook his head, backing up until his legs hit the bed, and he tumbled down onto it. "No! I haven't! Really!"
Draco wanted to ask what he meant when Snape turned him and pushed him toward the door. Would Snape take him to the Headmistress? The idea wasn't a pleasant one. McGonagall could be worse than Snape when riled. Especially when it came to Slytherins.
"I will," Potter said, appearing suddenly more guilty. "I wish I could bring her here to see you."
Draco flushed. “I don’t know.”
"Yeah, well even before the Manor, I knew you didn't want this any more than I did, Draco. Which means you deserve help."
“They tell me that these were my father’s formal robes,” Harry said softly.
The first time he'd seen him, Draco was shocked. "What are you doing down here, Potter? Shouldn't you still be celebrating your victory?"
of inspiration.
Harry and the new guard looked at him, surprised. Harry scowled. "What do you want now, Malfoy? Whatever it is, forget it. I'm going home, and I'm going to take whatever it takes to get rid of this headache, and then I'm going to bed. Hopefully, if it's a good night I won't think about you at all."
Draco decided that maybe those dreams hadn’t been a bad thing after all. Not with this sort of reaction, at any rate. And that he hoped Harry intended to provide a
“Harry,” Potter said, before pulling Draco into another kiss.
Draco shook his head to clear it, glowering into the mirror. This was precisely the problem! He couldn’t want Potter! Just the idea was ludicrous. Yet each morning, he woke with those eyes foremost in his mind. This last dream had been the most intense of all. He couldn't even allow himself to remember, but god, he wanted to. Just remembering the feeling of Potter’s lips on his; of their bodies pressed together… Just thinking of it again made his lips and skin tingle.
Draco shook his head, then tossed his head to indicate he’d been inside the walls. Harry seemed to understand. “Can you fly us inside?”
And they lived happily ever after. (Except for Lucius, who even after the boys managed to have two heirs, one for each kingdom, continued to be bitter that his son married into the Gryffindor family, rather than claiming their kingdom for his own, as Lucius had felt was his birthright.)
Her eyes widened. “Ooooh, you’re that prince-fellow, aren’t you?” she asked with a grin. “So then you know our Harry?”
He wished he could ask Harry questions about it. What it was like to be without his parents that way. How he felt about becoming the ruler of a kingdom at so early an age. What it was like to be able to make his own choices in life… It all puzzled Draco. There was just so much to ask. But at least Harry kept talking.
"Yeah, but you telling me isn't the same as remembering, Malfoy."
“Lucius,” Narcissa said in her calmest voice, “calm down. I am quite certain Potter won’t hurt us. He does owe me a life-debt, after all. And he will likely get bored with watching us soon enough.”
Draco nodded then waited for the dismissal so he could go back to his rooms. Lucius seemed to know that he was up to something, as even with Draco’s assurances, he stretched out his permission, leaving his son standing uncomfortably in front of him for several minutes before he finally nodded. “We will see you tomorrow, then.”
Potter pulled even closer, stroking his cheek gently. “Please,” he whispered.
“No…” Potter realized what he'd done and dropped his hand, flushing slightly. “I’m sorry…I just…are…they all like that?”
Harry turned to look at him. “Too bad you can’t stop it. You see…turning down an offer of this sort for your son would mean that people would wonder. After all, why would you not want your son to have a match so good? Unless you had a hand in deposing the family of said match, and are worried people might find out?”
All Draco could do was hope he was right. He’d flown so far already. Whoever these three were, they were his last chance. He took a deep breath, and stepped out from under the cover of the trees he’d been hiding in to listen.
“And ‘Harry’ is better?” Draco asked, barely managing to stifle a laugh.
“Not like that, Pansy. Just…he finds you interesting, that’s all,” Draco said, pushing forward his rook to check her king.
For our Hope saved us, just like everyone knew he would. Potter defeated Voldemort, and it was because of me he could. For in taking my wand, in defeating me, he became the master of the Elder Wand. Not that I'd known at the time, of course, but still a far better outcome than Voldemort winning and destroying the Wizarding World.
“No need, highness. Here she comes now,” Blaise said, moving closer to his side. When Draco looked towards the door, he was horrified. Harriet looked as though she had literally tumbled from the bed and come straight to the hall. Draco's eyes widened. What had he done? Had he ruined any chance to marry someone he was actually compatible with?
“And what does that mean, Potter?”
“I…I don’t know, Draco. Just…makes me wonder.”
If we look close, we can see this news surprises Draco, but he hides it well. “Indeed? I’m sorry.”
Supper dragged on, unendurably long, with Potter and Narcissa chatting amiably the entire time and completely ignoring the other two occupants of the table. Finally, when the last course was finished, Potter rose to his feet.
He shifted to see a young man with bright red hair riding a chestnut stallion, staring at him from the road.
Draco chanced a glance at Harry now that the worst was over. After all, Harry had kissed back, hadn’t he? That must mean something. He wasn’t disappointed. Harry didn’t look horrified. In fact, he looked—almost pleased.
Harry nodded. "We could start with dinner tonight. You could tell me what worked. Before. And we could come up with a list of people who might be allowed to visit you. If you wanted?"
Harry scowled at him. "Whatever kind of trick this is, it won't work." He turned away and moved once more to the spot on the far wall where he could see down the hall, but also into Draco's cell.
It was a shockingly long afternoon. Draco had assumed that not having Potter pop up everywhere he went would be just what he wanted, but instead, he found time dragging. He kept finding himself looking about for Potter, waiting for him to appear, but no such luck.
“So…we should take you to them, then,” Harry said, seeming far more certain now, but Draco shook his head. That was a bad idea. He couldn’t care less if his parents found out he’d gone outside, but learning their heir was a dragon? That would just not go well. And then there was the fact that the knights would probably slay him before Harry got a word in edgewise…
The other change was the addition of "assignments" for the day, conveyed by the house-elf. Sometimes they were simple tasks—sorting through the books in the library, and boxing up a certain number to donate. Other tasks were more complex, like figuring out the missing line to a potion where it was worn or cut away in the book it was in.
In the morning, when he woke, Potter was sitting at the table, watching him. “New chore today, Draco. I told them you’d help up at the palace, preparing the feast. The king will be married tonight, and so they’ll need all the hands they can get.”
"I've got plenty. And I kind of like it; reading it to you, I mean."
“Annoyed? And how many times must I tell you, Harry… Call me Draco.” He smiled. “I thought I could use a bit of a ride. Is Egan recovered from his colic, or should I take Fallon today?”
Draco sighed, then reached out for the water skin, wincing as he tried to open the thing, then took several large swallows before handing it back. “When will we stop for lunch?” he asked.
The first man laughed. “Yeah, well, with that mother of mine so pleased that her sweet niece had nabbed the King…you’d have left too, Remus. Besides, I was much happier spending time with your father, Harry. He was a good king.”
So instead, he worried. Soon it would happen. Soon he would be just like Fenrir. Would he laugh at their jokes then, too? Just the thought made him shiver. He wasn't sure he ever wanted to be like that.
Harry turned back, his eyes wide. “You didn’t…”
“That…” Harry stroked his cheek again. “That I think I might…love you. That I certainly would, given time. That I wanted to make you happy.”
Harry muttered something under his breath.
"Probably not," Harry agreed. He smiled at Draco, squeezing his shoulder, and seeming to sense his distress. "I’ll be back as soon as I can, okay?"
The second man put a hand on the younger man’s shoulder. “We do, too, Harry.”
Draco blinked after him. Now what in the hell was that supposed to mean? He sped after Potter, but his broom was still no match for Potter’s. It wasn’t fair. Time to upgrade, obviously. Maybe he’d go into London. The idea of getting away from Potter again made Draco smile, and he did a one-eighty, then swooped back towards the house.
"Draco, who is this… urchin?"
Draco turned finally toward the ‘girl.’ Her hair was long and rather bedraggled, her clothing covered by a thick woolen cloak. But at the moment he looked at her, she glanced up, and suddenly he found he could do nothing but stare into a pair of the brightest green eyes he’d ever seen in his life. Mentally shaking himself when he realized he'd been staring, he turned back to Blaise. “A princess? And does this princess have a name?”
"No worse than sitting and reading a book."
“Undignified, perhaps, but hardly skills that will kill you, Draco.”
Potter blinked at him, and Draco grinned. Oh, he was definitely hiding
“Well…the dreams…but…they’re just dreams…I thought…”
"Never," he said, nearly believing the word as he said it.
"I mean, come live with us. We won't call you a freak, I promise." He held out his hand. "My name's Draco. What's yours?"
Draco rolled his eyes. “On the palace grounds, of course. I’m certain any of the palace guards can point the way,” he added with a slightly sour smile. Then, before she could ask more questions, he pushed Egan forward and back onto the path and was out of sight before she could utter her wretched greeting again, or make up something for good-bye.
If the walking didn’t do it, or the sun, Draco was beginning to think that Potter’s “food” would. But he’d learned his lesson. He always tried to eat a bit at each meal he was allowed, even if he felt as though he were about to throw it right back up. He had to, or he knew he’d never make it. And then how could he send a letter back to his father telling him how this man was torturing him into an early grave? How could he rule their kingdom if he was dead?
“I know what I’m doing, Ron. Just…trust me? I think he’ll agree, it was a good lesson learned.”
The man nodded. "A few tricks. Are you not magical then?"
“I said ‘Potter’ in my sleep?”
“Over here.” Draco heard Harry’s voice coming from just around the bend in the path, so he moved forward to see him, smiling at first, but then stood agape as he saw the new clothes that Harry was wearing. “Look at you…wow.” Not that Harry had been difficult to look at before, but this outfit was even more flattering than the black one from the night before had been. It matched the green of his eyes almost perfectly, except for the fact that it was a few shades darker.
“A prince?” Potter looked almost like he wanted to snicker, but he didn’t, so Draco did his best not to glare at him. Instead, he focused on the next dream.
It was cool outside, and Draco let out a sigh of relief, only to hear the sound echoed somewhere nearby. He was about to move away when he saw who had made the noise—Harry.
Perhaps there is something he overheard? Let us go see what Harry and Ginny are talking about…
"Others, Headmistress?" Snape asked, confused.
The man chuckled, then took a swallow from the skin before passing it back. “Well…I don’t know that you can quite consider me
He deserved everything he got.
Potter snorted. "Why on earth would I? Can't stand the prat. Always bullying me, pushing me around. One of the best things to happen this year was getting away from the Dursleys."
"Just me. Except when my aunt comes to visit." Draco wanted to ask for his help, but at the same time, he didn’t know this young man. He might be worse than the witch or Fenrir. "Do you live nearby?"
The tall, regal man who faces Harry is Draco’s father, Lucius. “What do you want with us, Potter? I have paid my debt to society, and my son and wife were ruled free of any wrongdoing.”
"Good." She turned back to the basket that usually held the food she brought him and handed it to Fenrir. "And just to make sure, we’ll let you go without, just so you can know what it means to defy your auntie, shall we?"
And worse, his mother looked furious. Draco pulled back, a bit ashamed. Remus was right. She was just trying to help him. But really, did she need to marry him off to do it?
"Of course."
“No? So…they’re nearby?”
He was a good deal older than the other applicants for his “affections.” Nearly as old as his parents, if he guessed right. And while he was dressed quite well in a formal black robe with what looked like a million buttons, the sour look on his pinched, pale face was enough to make Draco shiver. The nose wasn’t bad, though some might have seen it so. But the hair? Black and greasy, as though he had never washed it in his life.
“Cousin?” Harry asked. Draco was curious too. After all, Sirius had mentioned a cousin once before. Had he really meant Draco’s mother?
Draco let Potter move to the far side of the bed, then watched despite himself as he took off his robe. He was dressed only in a short night-shirt. It was a rather warm night, and Draco felt overheated already. He told himself that absolutely none of it had to do with how well-muscled Potter’s calves were.
“Then why do you look as though you’re going to jump out the window?”
"Draco!" his father called after him.
Draco blinked at her. “You mean…?”
It took a moment for the shock of what Harry was doing to wear off, and another for Draco to realize what he meant. He fumbled with the potions, then threw one at his aunt, and she was engulfed in a bubble, and no longer able to move forward in the air. Draco watched as the bubble slowly sank towards the ground, Bella struggling inside to break free, and then Harry zoomed away and she was out of sight.
The horror must have shown on Draco’s face at that, for Weasley was quick to reassure him. “I promise he doesn’t bite. He’s actually quite soft-hearted…” He blinked for a moment, then frowned. “Well, most of the time…” He muttered something under his breath that Draco didn’t catch, then turned and pulled the cart onto the road.
"Eegh… That was horrible. We…can leave now?"
Potter looked as though Draco had slapped him. “No. Is that what you think I was doing?”
Now he had a new reason to know, though. He didn't want this to end after five years were up. He wanted to know for sure who he was spending his evenings with. And he wanted more.
After a rather annoying breakfast, Draco went out with his broom, hoping to distract himself. It was great—right up until Potter caught up with him. “Still no training?” he asked him dully.
“What do you mean, later, Sirius?”
“Blaise?” a voice asked in his ear.
And a third player in our little drama. There. The girl with the long red hair as red as the bloke sitting with his girlfriend and with Harry? That is Ginny, the selfsame Ron's sister. She’s dancing with all her old boyfriends, in the hopes that Harry will notice and be jealous.
Draco pulled away at that. The king hadn’t even arrived yet? He was still out of the country? He must be retrieving his consort, Draco thought to himself. And now he felt a fool, being worried his former suitor would see him. Weasley was right. If the king knew what a peasant was doing to the man he might have married, he’d never have allowed it. Even if he
Finally, Harry spoke. "Is that really what you believe, Malfoy? It's your fault?"
"What? What do you mean?"
All Draco could hear in his head was Bella’s mocking voice, saying how he was fit for nothing but being her pet. And whatever else, he had to agree—he was in no way fit to be anyone’s king.
She smiled. "Once, Draco, your mother and I used to be close. I hope we will be again. But you shouldn't thank me. I hadn't even considered it. Not until Harry suggested it."
Draco nodded slowly.
Now he'd met his host, he couldn't help thinking of him, either, and wondering who he might be.
"Not that it's any of your business, Malfoy, but we were already broken up."
There were shouts from behind him: delight, astonishment, horror from a few, then his guards, gormless as ever, tore open the door without a word and ran up the stairs, shouting his name as though they didn’t know he couldn’t possibly be in there. Apparently, they believed their own lies. He shook his head and rolled his eyes, turning back to Harry.
Yes! Draco was so excited, he nearly jumped into the air, but managed to stop himself, nodding instead.
He heard the rumble of the cart-wheels rolling over the ground behind him, and turned to see Weasley approaching. He looked a bit surprised. “Wow. Pig doesn’t usually let others touch him. You must have the magic touch.”
“There isn’t going to be one.”
“Why not? I mean, in a house that size, you must have hundreds of rooms, right? There has to be one closer to yours than the guest wing.”
“Excuse me?” he asked incredulously.
He was scared to ask where his parents were. He wasn't sure he wanted to know.
“No? You’re not? You don’t like him?” Well, that wasn’t a helpful question at all. Draco huffed again. “So…you do like him, then?” Harry asked, confused.
“So…in the morning…the servants asked if we could deliver a few cords of wood to the palace. It seems they’ve been baking overtime for the wedding, and they’ve used up all the wood. So I told them you’d bring them more tomorrow.”
Of course, the house-elf still refused to answer questions, so Draco needed to figure this out another way.
“Happy? You mean by haunting my steps, and tormenting me?”
Before Draco could retaliate, though, Harry flipped them again, his lips finding Draco’s neck once more, fastening on the spot he’d been sucking on before he’d flipped them as he ground harder against Draco. “God…yes…” Draco arched up against him, finally letting his eyes fall closed as Harry took over. The sight of him was just too much now. He knew he wouldn’t last too much longer at this rate. He’d needed this ever since he’d woken from that final dream, and with Harry, here, pressed against him, willing and warm and kissing back; it was all he could do to hold on. “Harry…oh…” He shuddered. “Close.”
"Did you plan something bad?" he asked, and the look on Harry's face stated plainly he wouldn't believe it if he said he did.
The reception line seemed to take forever, and, of course, each girl as well as a few of the younger men, did their very best to catch his interest. The closest he could come to feeling interested in any of them was when the duke of the lowlands introduced himself. Duke Zabini was a lovely man with dark brown skin and a wicked smile, with twinkling eyes to match, and hair that looked like it would be glorious to wrap his hands in. But he wasn’t Harry. Even as he shook and kissed hands, his eyes scanned the room every so often for his friend, hoping he would appear.
Some would say I'm taking a bit too much responsibility for the darkness we've so recently been through, but I don't. I know what I've done. I deserve worse than I am getting. Not that anyone else thinks so.
Harry nodded. "I was surprised when I realized, but then I realized it made sense. I mean, we're alike in a lot of ways, Draco. But if you don't want—"
Draco nodded. "Yes. I think so. Might be a few days in the telling, though, depending on how long you can stay."
It was a ground-shaking moment for Draco. Harry Potter had just said please to him. It was enough to shock him into returning to the couch and settling there once more. “All right.”
“Yes,” Harry whispered, grinding against him faster now, his lips covering Draco’s once more. So real. It was all Draco could do to wind his arms around him, and then he was crying out into Harry’s mouth as he found release, clinging to him until he felt Harry do the same. Then they collapsed against the couch, both drained and panting. “Fuck.”
“What he means, Harry, is that he ran away when he was young.”
Draco’s stomach gave a grumble at that, and Fenrir laughed. "I think he has a clue already, Bella."
The words sent an electric jolt through Draco’s system. ‘This.’ He and Harry were really going to…do more than kiss. He couldn’t help but pull him in for another kiss before answering. “Does it matter?”
"What? You'll hex me? And spoil any chance of being an Auror?"
“Of course not!” Draco relaxed infinitesimally. “Just bring the cart with you!” Potter said in a generous tone.
At this Robards snorted, but Shacklebolt sent him a quelling look, then nodded at Harry to go on. "I do, Harry."
“Draco…”
Potter nodded, smiling. "Yeah."
“I welcome that friendship, sir. I would be quite pleased to have you and your son as my allies. I think both our kingdoms would benefit from it.”
“Potter. I came to offer my congratulations.”
“Wait a minute!” Potter grabbed his wrist.
“I hate this. Being forced to marry someone just so I can have my power. Why do I have to marry anyone?” He met Harry’s eyes, and felt his heart beat faster. He’d never told his friend his true feelings for him. After all, it would hardly be fair to Harry to know it. It wasn’t like they could act on it, even if Harry were interested. “I wish you could come to the ball, at least. Then there would be
“Marrying a Gryffindor?”
The Queen was not pleased at that. “Draco! I thought I was clear.”
"Please, Potter. You're not even an Auror. Don't you think you're being a touch full of yourself there?"
to your own bed, Potter! Get out!”
“Is that possible?” The last had accidentally fallen down the stairs leading up to the throne room, and had needed to stay on an extra week to watch for head injuries.
"Why? Where are your parents? Are they on a trip?"
"It’s okay, Draco. All you have to do is drink this." Harry handed him the potion, and Draco tossed it down, shuddering at the taste.
“Now you look here, ‘Harriet…’”
"Well, I saw—" He glanced at Draco, then back up at Shacklebolt. "Voldemort forced him to use the spell to punish another Death Eater for failing him, sir."
“Don’t slouch, Draco, it’s not becoming,” Narcissa chided.
"I'm… not sure how to take that, Malfoy. I thought you hated me?"
Potter showed five minutes before it would have gone off. Apparently, he’d been taking advice from someone about how to dress to impress. Tight jeans, a loose white shirt open at the neck and revealing flashes of his chest, which made Draco flush again and remind himself that this was
Personally, Draco couldn’t help but agree with Sirius a bit. He loved his mother, but she did have a tendency to want to manipulate things the way she wanted them to be. He nodded, and the three looked at him.
Draco stood to leave as well, but Lucius was not finished chastising his son. Neither son nor father noticed that the door had been left open a small gap, nor did they notice that there was someone just outside listening to every word that was said.
Harry thought about that, then smiled and nodded. "All right. Come on. Let’s go find a room for the night. We’ve got a long way to go." He put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and together, the two of them walked down to the village, where Draco’s life would finally begin.
It was worth it. Potter looked rather worried, now. Draco wished he could gloat, but that would come later. After he’d talked to the king. And preferably in private.
All to no avail, though. Potter shrugged. “You need the toughening up, pretty boy. Now get some sleep. You’ll need it if you’re going to pull the wagon again tomorrow.”
“They must be frantic, then. I mean…if you’re missing…” Draco nodded encouragingly. He couldn’t get close, but these three could, and at least they could tell his parents what had happened to him.
The thought worried Draco. That meant Lucius cast the spell on him after Harry, if the spell on Harry was still so strong. "Are you still in contact with your family, Potter?"
Still, whether or not Harry went to talk to his family, Draco knew nothing would change unless Harry himself remembered. So he'd have to find a way to break through the spell, despite the headache he knew it was likely to cause him.
“Not exactly the words I would use,” Draco managed in a mutter.
Draco sighed. “Yes, mother.”
“Get off, Blaise,” he mumbled, shifting away, and still mostly asleep. “Go back to your own bed. Not in the mood. Told you.”
"I know. You're lucky your parents would do so much for you." Harry smiled. "So what happened after they touched, then?"
Harry's eyes widened. "That's not about your parents, Draco."
Draco’d thrown the third potion, and Fenrir had again backed off, wailing. This time Draco caught a glimpse of Fenrir, and noticed that the area where the potion had hit was bubbling. Obviously, it was toxic stuff. Except that couldn't be true, could it? Around Bella, it had just made a bubble. Maybe each potion was different?
When Potter pulled away, he looked cautiously hopeful. “So…will you stay?”
Then something changed. A new group of guards came to watch the cells. And one of them was Potter.
Potter shook his head again, crossing his arms, his expression more neutral now. “No. I’m more than capable of defending myself,” he said confidently.
"That's two questions, Malfoy. And I won't be able to tell you even if it weren't. You know that."
"Do you think your father really would do that to a child? Especially you?"
He nodded. "Yeah. His parents are my guardians." His voice suggested he wasn't too pleased by it.
His captor looked down at him. "You can't have visitors, Draco. You know that."
Draco felt his cheeks heat, knowing how the next would sound to Potter. But he forced out the words. “Neither. It…I was a prince.”
Ignoring his growling stomach, he used magic on each long strip of cloth, then folded them and returned them to the baskets, more pleased than he had been with the work than that he’d done the day before. Then he started on the napkins, finishing the last just in time to pack it away as Potter walked through the gate.
This reverie was broken when Harry appeared, leading two horses—Draco’s own stallion, Egan, and a docile mare that Harry was allowed to use for his own needs that he had named Lily. “All ready, Hi—Draco. Shall we?”
Still, it was difficult to watch Harry mount his broom and fly back through the trees. It felt like he’d never see him again.
“He seems a nice enough bloke, Sirius. Why not trust him?”
"And I got splinters and bruises and blisters!"
Draco nodded. “Worse than the last.”
“Your mother doesn’t seem to mind me…”
“There are many girls here today who might make an excellent queen for Draco. Perhaps we should make a contest of it? The girl who restores him to his true form will rule at his side?” The Queen suggested.
Daniel turned, shaking a pale pink-and-blue streaked mop from his eyes. “Hey,” he said with the fakest grin Draco had seen in his existence. “Come on, Harry,” he said, draping himself over Harry’s shoulders. “I think I see a table in an alcove over there,” he said, pointing back towards the doorway that led to the more ‘private’ areas of the club. Draco couldn’t quite hold back a growl at that.
“Not about to,” Draco said. His own breath was coming faster, and he licked out over Harry’s lips, pressing his tongue into the other boy’s mouth, moaning as they ground together. He knew it could get better than this, but with this feeling so good, he knew he could wait for more. It was Harry’s first time. He passingly wondered if that meant at all, or just with a guy, then decided it didn’t much matter just now. Hopefully Harry’d be up for another round later. And either way, Draco would be his first. He tried not to think that Harry might not want this again. If this was just a one-off because he was horny…
Draco blinked, staring at Potter, waiting for the rest of his little gang to appear and tell him the joke was on him. It didn’t happen. “What? Why on earth…Potter, that makes no sense.”
Hanging his head, Draco nodded. He wasn’t sure
“They…don’t know you’ve changed?” Harry asked slowly.
“Sirius?”
Harry blinked at him. “What? When?”
Draco frowned at the odd question. "Um…no."
Even without a vocal response or change in expression, Draco knew that his father was scanning his words for a lie, and couldn’t help but feel relieved that not a single word had been untrue. Just a stretching of the truth. He didn’t honestly know how Harry could manage to get Lucius’s approval, but he was certainly willing to let him try.
He wasn't sure how long he lay there, refusing to get up, when he found himself slapped awake.
"Well, what if we did something unexpected?"
Finally, Draco’d had enough. It had only been a week, but he needed to get away. He went to spend the weekend at Blaise’s, not bothering to let anyone know.
He left the room without another word, going to the bathroom and going downstairs to get some toast. When he returned, his host was gone again. He hadn't actually expected him to stay. Though he'd secretly wished he would.
Draco smiled. "I do. I even managed to get some parchment and a quill from one of the other guards, so I didn't forget the idea I came up with." He waved a stack of paper at Potter.
Finally, on his third day of lurking in the Ministry atrium, Potter strode past, lost in his thoughts. It took three times of Draco calling out to him for Potter to hear him. When he saw who it was, his face clouded. “And what do you want, Malfoy?”
"I guess," Potter said softly. He sighed. "I'll see you soon, Malfoy."
"No, but it means the longer after the memory, the more likely the spell will fail, Harry," she told him.
"If I don't stop the parties? Detention for the rest of the year."
Draco didn't know what to do.
“So…did the next take place at my house, or yours?” Potter wanted to know.
When Potter appeared to greet them as well, Draco sneered, then moved to the gate, hoping to see his father’s carriage arriving, but it was nowhere in sight, so all he could do was wait.
Draco doesn’t seem too pleased at the dismissal, but it should be obvious to anyone who watches that there is more to it. Particularly when he returns home to the Manor rather than to his flat, and proceeds to hide from the world.
"Right. So…what was the next dream about?"
Now she spoke, in her most airy voice. “And he will remain just so until someone—his true love—comes to break the spell.”
“I can handle myself, Ron. Just…calm down, okay?”
Draco nodded. He couldn’t help but hope that this was the thing Harry had been hiding from him, but when he stepped out into the gardens, the man he saw there looked nothing like his lover. “You’re not Harry.” It was hardly politic, he knew, but he had so hoped…
"We’re nearly there, Draco," Harry said quietly, interrupting his thoughts. "She wouldn’t dare attack us there, so you’re almost free."
“Sorry,” Harriet yawned as she entered the room. “I overslept.”
“Fill your stomach and keep you warm until lunch, at least,” Potter said, and Draco nodded and sighed, picking up a spoonful to take a bite. Bland, but not horrible tasting. Just a bit slimy, though, he thought.
“What do you mean, ‘It worked?’” his father asked, barely holding back the snarl. “You were kissing a
The rush of memory left Draco dizzy, but when it passed, he remembered every moment of that afternoon. How well they'd gotten on. How different it had been from their years in Hogwarts together.
"Uh… never mind." Potter's face was a little red now, and Draco couldn't help wondering why.
“Burn it,” Draco said with a sniff, sitting down on a nearby bench to wait for Potter to right his world once more.
"That won't be fair," Draco said with a scowl.
“Fine,” Draco sighed. He could surely manage that, right? “You don’t toss and turn, do you?”
He settled on the edge of the cart and began to eat his lunch, but was interrupted by a voice. “Oi!”
Moony shrugged. “Ask.”
"You stood up for me. Because he picked on me."
Draco turned away. Potter wasn’t the sort to prevaricate easily, so it really looked like this wasn’t some sort of trick. “I know. But…not…not in my dreams.”
“Mother! I don’t want some brainless—ow, damn it, Hannah! That hurt.”
She captured the rook with her knight before turning back to the conversation at hand. “Blaise Zabini, your personal guard, finds me…interesting? Interesting like…a bug under a glass, or…?”
“What? That’s where it ends? With us…”
Harry scowled. “Don’t.”
And so did the dreams Draco was having. As did the memory of that morning, waking to feel Potter wrapped around him. How…right it felt to him, now. And every time he thought that, Draco would grow disgusted with himself, and leave the house to find other distractions. But he was never gone for long. And Harry was always there when he returned.
Shacklebolt nodded slowly. "I see."
“You are home, Draco,” came Lucius’s drawl from the door. “When I arrived, you looked happier than I have seen you since you were a boy.”
Still, it didn’t stop him from going to visit him in his stables. And it had been the perfect excuse to get away from his parents. That he needed a bit of fresh air to help him think.
He nodded, looking weary. He turned to one of the guards nearby. “Send for Dumbledore. Looks like we’ll need his help to fix this.” Once the guard had disappeared, he turned back to Harry. “My apologies, King Harry. As you can imagine, things have been in a bit of an uproar here this morning.”
Finally, the girl was done, and she and Draco’s mother left him alone to brood. How was he ever going to manage this with someone else, when Harry had been the only person ever to feature in his daydreams of that sort? His night dreams, too, when it came to that. Draco squirmed, recalling the latest.
gay. But there he was…dancing with a rather attractive young man wearing skin-tight—practically painted on—clothes, who seemed to have wandering hands. Potter kept brushing them away, though. Didn’t stop the git from dancing with the slut, though.
"Regardless, Harry, she will need to be processed. If she had stayed home…" The new Minister, Shacklebolt, didn't seem to be pleased, but it didn't make it any easier to hear.
“Your mother isn’t here, and I’d really rather you didn’t use that horrible name, thank you.”
The guard stepped forward then nodded at Draco cautiously. “Yes, Highness?”
The slim hope Draco had had for praise for what he’d managed to accomplish faded in that moment. Not only had he not even considered supper, but he still had to get the basket back up to the palace before nightfall, which was in less than an hour. He’d never manage both.
Harry's reaction to Of Promises, Frogs, and Princes, and an intro to Draco's second tale.
It was a mess.
"True. But there’s knowing, and there’s feeling, Fenny. And I want Draco to really understand. To feel."
“Right. And that’s supposed to make me want to meet them?” Draco scowls at Harry, then stalks to his room, and all Harry can do is watch him go, and sigh. Do you empathize with his plight yet, dear reader?
He'd pulled the bench closer to the bars, so he could see Potter's face better while he talked. He wanted to be able to change the story if he needed to.
“I was not aware that my son was on house arrest, Potter.”
Potter muttered something under his breath that sounded a bit like “finally,” but Draco couldn’t understand why he would say that. Then Potter nodded and made his way up the stairs. Draco watched after him until he disappeared from sight, then made his way to the library and retrieved a book to divert himself with before going to the sitting room, hoping that he would be a bit less distractible now.
“Inheritance? But you don’t have…” Draco swallowed the final word. His friend had always been a bit sensitive about his lost parents. No one had ever managed to find out who they might be. One of Draco’s fears was that someday someone would take Harry away, and he would never see his friend again. “What else did he say?”
Dumbledore smiled. “Why, a kiss, of course.”
Draco's anger choked him at the words. "How can you… have you ever been left alone? Completely? No one to talk to for months on end? How the fucking hell would you know how bad it feels? You have no right to judge my feelings!" Draco struggled to get out of bed, only to find it had been too long, and his legs weren't ready to let him stand. "Fuck… get out. You don't want to know me, then don't. But don't you fucking judge me, P…" He realized what he was about to say, and stopped abruptly, closing his eyes. "Get out. Whoever you are."
“I won’t. I just…” He fumbled with his own trousers now, pushing them down then pressed down against Harry, which drew a strangled moan from both of them.
“But you look so good in white, darling.” She smiled. “Not that anyone would care what you wore, but it is always better to wow. Especially in this sort of situation.”
“I don’t know! To…torment me.”
“What on earth is this? Is this how you usually sleep?” Draco asked, trying not to laugh.
Understand, I had no concept of what my father truly meant. Yes, I believed Muggles and Muggleborn were a blight, it was their fault we needed to be so careful and sparing with our magic. But I had no concept of why, or what might happen to those people we deemed Muggle or Muggleborn. It was an abstract concept at best.
“We’ll get it figured out, Draco. I promise. Come on.”
Harry shook his head and stepped forward once more, meeting Draco’s eyes. “Don’t suppose you can talk, can you?” he asked Draco softly.
Before Harry could answer, the Minister interrupted him. "Very well, Mister Potter. You will be allowed to speak before we determine Mister Malfoy's sentence." He conjured a chair for Harry to sit in, then once more focused on Draco. "Do you want to say anything before we continue, Mister Malfoy?"
Draco blinked. “Excuse me?”
you want, Harry?”
“Really? Maybe…I heard them once, and that’s why I’m having these dreams?”
Making a face, Draco shook his head. They’d never get anywhere at this rate. He huffed, and a small puff of smoke emerged from his mouth. He started.
Surely that couldn't be right? Draco started again. And ended up with the same answer. He wrote it out once more, but still there it was, in black and white. Harry Potter.
“We’ll be right behind,” Moony assured him with a smile. The two men waved, then Draco gathered himself and sprang into the air, hoping that Harry had a good grip. At least it was a quick flight, he thought to himself.
, then I’ll leave.”
"What? No! Please don’t leave me here!"
The two of them worked in silence for a few minutes, the red-head pulling out an axe from his belt to cut dead trunks into logs and even halving and quartering larger ones. Finally, they stopped for a break.
Unfortunately, Draco had no such illusion for himself. Just the thought that he might run into the other man made his heart sink in his chest. How could he face someone who was his true equal when he’d been turned into—well, there was no other word for it, really—a drudge? Especially when he’d insulted the man so badly.
Potter glanced down the corridor, then moved closer. "They released her," he said softly. "She helped me and, well… because she did, this is all over. It was enough to get her a commuted sentence for her part in the rest."
“Okay…I see what you mean by obsessed…but I’m not the only one…”
"Wait… please… bored. Need… something to do. Someone to talk to."
Harry stood. "If my evidence was not good enough, sir, I can clarify."
Pansy managed to keep her head, but only barely. As it was, her voice was a bit high and strained. “My hand? Why would he… He’s never said more than ten words to me the entire time he’s been your personal guard. Why now?”
Draco thought about this. It might be true. But then he remembered he was the wronged party here. He huffed. “So…do I have a room here? Or should I go back to the shack?”
"To find out?" she asked softly.
"Yes, father," Draco called out the window. "Come on, Harry." Never did he consider his father how his father might react to his new playmate.
The invitation stated all students should come as they were, and that the masks would disguise any house colours any student might choose to wear.
But Draco knew that it was only a matter of time before Fenny did anyway. He was growing up, and for some reason, this upset his "aunt." She told him that soon he would have to prove his worth, and that he would do so far better if he were like Fenny than as he was, which even Draco had to admit to himself some days was just a plain and rather ordinary boy.
“Potter! Shacklebolt’s looking for you!” a bloke who’d just entered called out.
“What better place, indeed,” Dumbledore said, casting a glance toward the two boys. Draco’d placed his head on Harry’s lap, and was only vaguely aware of the scrutiny. “He seems to have made one friend already,” he added with a pleased smile.
“No.” Potter caught his wrist. “I didn’t seek you out in the night, Draco. You sought me. Doesn’t that mean anything to you?”
Draco nodded. He didn't want Potter getting in trouble. That would only mean he couldn't come watch him any longer, after all. "Okay. See you soon, then?"
Harry shook his head. But he didn’t look angry. Draco wished he did. That hurt, hopeful look went straight through him. “No.” This time, he didn’t fight his hand as it rose to stroke Draco’s cheek.
Shacklebolt looked up at him, then glanced at the head of the MLE, who muttered something in Shacklebolt's ear, and the Minister shook his head. "You were assigned another task you managed to accomplish that year, I believe?"
Queen Narcissa seemed barely able to bite her tongue, but when Draco managed to hold his own, she nodded, then turned to the girl. “And you do not object to marrying one of the Slytherin Royal Family?”
. He wasn’t sure how he would be able to pretend it didn’t affect him for long if it continued. “Let’s get this straight, Potter. Dreams or not? We are not friends. You made that decision a long time ago.”
"Acting like I've murdered you or deserted you or something equally maudlin."
"So tell me. When did you cast it? While I was rescuing you from the Fiendfyre? At the Manor? When?" Harry was glowering at him.
Moving carefully back over to where the three were still talking to the wizard, Draco placed his head in Harry’s lap. Harry’s fingers immediately went to the ridge of his head and began to scratch. One thing that Draco had learned in all this, even despite his size, it was quite easy for people to forget he was truly human and intelligent while in this form, and he was learning all sorts of interesting things as they talked around him.
The King turned back to Harry after a moment of examining the overlarge reptile that Harry had suggested might be his son, and scowled at him. “Just what are you playing at? What makes you think that that is my son? We were under the impression that he was in his tower…and simply unable to get out due to the vines that had suddenly grown around it.” He shot a warning look at Draco’s guards, who shrank back. Draco knew they were thinking about how angry he would be if he discovered they had been lying to him. Draco knew they would never have told him they’d lost track of him. Especially after a dragon had been seen. His father would have been sure to cut off their heads before going to find his son.
"Did you want to say anything to say in your defense?" the Minister asked.
The words alone were enough to bring heat rushing to his cheeks, and Draco turned away again, the cooler air coming from the window helping him calm a bit. “It’s getting dark. My parents will be worried.”
Harry covered Draco’s lips with a finger before he could continue. “Do you trust me?”
"It’s alright, Draco. He can’t reach us unless he’s got a broom. But we’ll keep higher, just to be sure, okay?"
“So…the mountains, then?”
That was a surprise. Draco turned to look at him, an eyebrow raised. “You do? Why?”
And so, like any boy placed under what they considered unnecessary restrictions, he found a way to escape from time to time.
“And where is that?”
Draco smiled. "A sort of wish fulfillment for me," he said with a smile, trying not to flush.
Stay tuned, dear reader, the answers are forthcoming.
"I have! Please, I made that…"
Then Harry was behind him, a hand on his back, and it was all Draco could do not to turn and curl into his embrace. “No. But my parents…”
Harry bowed. “Majesty. My name is King Harry. I came to celebrate our countries’ alliance and bring your son a gift for his birthday.”
“Lady Pansy. Speak to her for me?”
"Well if I'm telling you the truth, it could mean everything. So I'm curious."
Draco’s heart rose at that. So long as Harry asked the right questions… He nodded again, this time more eagerly.
“You. Help Draco? And why would you do that? Even more importantly, how?”
The thought made Draco uncomfortable. He looked away so he didn’t have to meet Harry’s eyes. “It was just a dream.”
Draco smiled. “Because he finally had something to offer in return to get my help.”
The words sent something warm radiating through Draco, and if he’d been able, he would have smiled. Instead, he nodded once to Harry, hoping he would understand that he felt the same. They would be allies as long as Draco had anything to say about it.
Narcissa beamed at him. “You have favorites? Which?” She glanced around the hall as though the hopefuls might glow so that she could pick them out to speak to them.
“No need. I’ll be there faster than you can blink.”
"Please, just one thing. Research memory charms? Or better still, have Granger look for you. Find out the possible side-effects. If you don't see anything that makes you wonder, I won't bother you again. All right?"
Draco couldn’t imagine growing up anywhere but the palace. He’d never even considered that there even
"Life isn't like that, Malfoy. Maybe you knew things you shouldn't, and did the wrong things, but you couldn't have stopped him, either. I know that better than anyone. And well… Dumbledore was already dying. It's why he asked Snape to step in for you when it came down to it."
Biting his lip, Draco met Harry's eyes. "Are you straight?" he finally managed after a few minutes struggling to find the words.
Blaise turned and looked in the direction Draco was glaring and upon seeing Potter, he let out a laugh. “Oh, come on, Draco. He can’t be that bad, can he?”
He’d not told any of his friends about what the boy hero had asked of him, but Blaise was good at getting those sorts of details out of him. He’d had to swear Blaise to secrecy, and even after his friend had promised, Draco had had to endure quite a bit of teasing about it.
Draco’s throat closed, and he turned away, unable to speak again.
“Of course, father. Who else would it be?” Draco asked with a laugh.
Draco glowered. His father wouldn’t, would he? Harry was his friend! He’d helped him! He curled his tail around the bench, encircling both Harry and Sirius.
As the evening drew on, talk turned to politics of the day. A far safer topic now than it might have been before the war. There were new departments in the Ministry, and Draco and his host found themselves debating the merits of each. Spiritedly. And quite enjoying the debate.
"Potter, you don't know me. Whatever you believe I wanted—"
There was a sigh, then the door opened again. “It’s okay, Hermione.” Potter appeared, moving to stand next to her. “If I can handle Voldemort, I can handle Draco Malfoy.”
Harry shook his head. “No. Sirius and Remus, my personal guards are with me. But Draco needed help so I came back here with him after he finally made clear to us who he was.”
"Her…um…pet," Draco mumbled.
But Draco couldn't shake the sudden realization, and turned away. "Did you want anything else?" he asked.
And that was where Draco’s dreams always cut off. After all, he had no clue what two people did together in that sort of situation. Let alone two men. He knew it had to be much more complicated, then.
The wedding plans still seemed to be proceeding, which also didn’t seem to improve Draco’s mood. After all, he’d told Potter he wouldn’t be staying. What did Potter know that he did not? The very thought that Potter knew something that he didn’t made him nervous, and Draco
Still, soon enough, Draco convinced his friend that they needed to go clubbing, and it was easy enough to get caught up in the music and lights and smoke and alcohol, and soon Draco felt the most relaxed he’d felt in ages.
The boy seemed startled Draco wasn't scared of him. "What? No! I won't! Mum and dad say it's so!"
Scowling, Draco was about to let the other man learn of his displeasure, but then the door opened, and Blaise and Pansy appeared, a dark green dress draped over her arms. “So, where is your bride-to-be, Draco?” she asked.
"You don't mind?" Draco asked him softly.
He couldn’t let that stop him, though. He had to get rid of these dreams. The last had been the most vivid yet. And if they didn’t stop… He shivered, hugging himself, and tried to banish the images from his mind.
"Please," Draco said, earnest now. Potter or not, he was sick of being alone. And if it was Potter… "Please stay and talk to me?"
“Father…”
“Dear god! Is that beast yours?” he asked the ragged man.
“Right, Potter,” Draco sneered. He knew that Potter had somehow planned this, but he wasn’t about to say so. “We were just leaving, anyway.”
For a moment, Potter was quiet. Then he tugged took Draco’s wrist and pulled him closer. “I should have tried this before,” he said softly. His hand moved up to tangle in Draco’s hair before he could pull away, then pulled him into a kiss.
Lucius sighed, then slipped the silken piece of fabric over his son’s eyes, then tied it securely. “And now?”
“Nothing horribly exciting. Animal empathy.”
"I plan to," he said, and Draco was surprised there was no trace of anger in his voice.
Even before he could stop it, Draco found himself smiling. He clasped Harry's hand. "I'd like that."
Frowning, Harry glanced at Hermione. "I… don't know."
Finally, he turned toward the cottage. He still couldn’t call it a home, but his bed was there. And Potter would probably look for him if he went missing. He hadn’t exactly seen the other man’s temper, but he wasn’t particularly sure he wanted to, either.
"Well, this one, you gave me the idea last time. I mean, what if we'd met earlier, you know?"
Sirius shot Draco a distrustful glare. “Tending to him?”
Draco watched as Harry looked down the hall for the third time in the past hour. "I'm sorry if I'm boring you, Potter."
"I did, sir." Draco closed his eyes. He didn't know what Harry had up his sleeve, but he didn't believe it would work, regardless of what Harry might believe. "This court knows Mister Malfoy and I were never friends in school, but I learned a few things about him in the past few years. Though he stood on the wrong side of this conflict, I never saw him do anything not directly related to protecting himself or his family. I don't believe he should be held accountable for his actions, nor should he be punished for trying to save his parents."
“Well, I
Her eyes closed, but the man’s eyes softened. "We had hoped," he said, and though his voice sounded calm, Draco could hear the steel control underlying the words. "But it had been so long…"
It seemed he dreamed, as there was a whisper somewhere in his memory. “Silly boy. You don’t have to make it this difficult on yourself…” He felt someone draw a cover around his shoulders, and he snuggled deeper under the warmth, sinking deeper into sleep
Harry laughed. “You mean after we leave this room?”
It was a long time after Harry left before he even attempted sleep.
Draco looked up into those green eyes that he’d always hated because they had always glared at him before now, even though they were a colour he knew Potter would never properly appreciate himself. “I don’t know. I’ve…never had to choose. That choice was taken from me.”
Harry nodded, taking the tray when Draco handed it out to him. "I'd say that more than earned an extra question if you want, Draco."
“Well, I didn’t,” Potter said, and as he turned away to move to the couch across from him, Draco could hear a soft snort. When he looked at Draco once more, his face was calmer, though Draco thought he saw a gleam of interest in his eyes. “What kind of dreams are they? I’m not…hurting you, am I?”
McGonagall held up a hand. "Severus, don't you truly believe those students caused their own problems? I do not recall Mister Malfoy or Mister Potter have have such difficulties?"
Snape whispered in his mother’s ear again, and she smiled. “So, tell me, girl. How do you feel about marrying into the Slytherin Royal line?”
It never came. "After you left Hogwarts?"
”At the end of the ball, yes.” Lucius’s lips thinned. He obviously knew Draco was hiding something, but had no clue as to what.
The words made Draco grin. “Oh…call me that again…”
Once upon a time, there was a prince whose mother wanted him to marry a proper princess, but he had his sights on a different sort of mate.
Draco nodded. "And faster?"
“You…wanted…me?”
Draco blinked, unsure what to say. He hardly wanted to speak ill of his father, but he knew Lucius held few limits when it came to his own power. But what if Potter told the MLE, and they used it against him in court?
"I understand, sir," Draco said again. It was a risk he had to take.
As the last four guests approached the bassinette to give their gifts, the neglected wizard appeared.
Harry was watching him now, his head tilted to the side. “But you do understand us, don’t you?”
"You like the protection I offer you, don’t you, dear nephew? The food I bring? I take good care of you. You wouldn’t leave auntie, would you?"
Harry asks to stay at Malfoy Manor.
The boy stood, reaching for his glasses and adjusting them on his face before peering at Draco. Draco realized they were about the same age. He dusted himself off, then nodded, meeting Draco's eyes with the brightest green eyes Draco had ever seen. "I guess. You shouldn't have done that. What if he doesn't come back? What will I tell my aunt?"
Draco watched him, amazed, as he swooped in a circle, then alit on the windowsill. "Wow…I’ve only ever seen her do magic before. Can you do other things?"
"H-Harry." He looked down at Draco's hand, then up at him, and Draco began to wonder if he would shake it. Finally, he reached out and clasped it. "Why are you being so nice to me?" he asked, amazed.
“I don’t know. I assumed she would be here with you, mother.” Had Harry fallen asleep after he’d left, and not woken? “I’ll send Blaise to collect her, shall I?”
When Draco had finished, Harry looked at him for a long moment before he spoke. “You know…that kind of reminds me of a fairy-story they read us in nursery school. Rapunzel. Ever heard of it?”
"Good. Then, when that…‘bird’ appears, you’re to call me. Immediately. Clear?"
"But this one… well, you'll see."
time, when it would finally alleviate his suffering, remembering all the times he’d just randomly appeared where Draco’d been going. Still, he shook off his annoyance and sat down near his father, who looked about ready to blow as well.
“I’ll be fine, Sirius. Just…hurry? I don’t want to be there without you for too long.”
Of course, that was when Bella chose to appear once more, directly in front of him. "He will never be free, and he knows it. What is he fit for, anyway? King?" She laughed. "He knows he’s fit for nothing more than to become my pet as I planned all along. After all, Fenny can only last so much longer. He needs someone to train…"
"You'd be dead?" Draco suggested. "You know father would have handed you over to the Dark Lord, Harry. If I'd had any more access to you, he'd have made sure of it."
Meeting Draco’s eyes, Potter shrugged. “Dunno. I just do…Please don’t go?”
Harry opened his eyes looking down to meet his eyes, a goofy smile on his face, his glasses slightly askew. “Wow…” He kissed Draco again, softer this time, then stroked his cheek again. “That was…”
“I don’t know. You seemed to be getting on with the dark fellow,” Harry said.
Potter smiled. "I'm glad it is."
"H-home, sir."
"Draco…" The woman was speaking now. "He’s already left. I think he wanted you to have time alone with your family."
There. That blond in the sleek and expensive outfit, dancing with everyone and settling on no one? That is Draco. He likes to pretend he is happy, but he knows something is missing. Though he would never deign to notice his one-time-obsession. Or ever guess that that obsession might now be obsessed with him.
Oh, dear. All Draco could hope was that Blaise and Harriet had prepared an answer for this.
don’t have to
Those stunning green eyes met his once more, and she smiled. “Are you telling me you didn’t know Kings Salazar and Godric were once the best of friends before they had their falling out?”
So many feelings raced through Draco, and he battled with himself for several moments before looking up to meet Potter’s eyes once more. “What?” he asked softly.
Who am I? Oh, well, I'm sure most have heard my name. Or at least my father's. Draco Malfoy. Yes, that Malfoy. The one who let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. The one who caused Dumbledore's death. The one who foolishly took the Mark shortly after his sixteenth birthday because it was the only way he could think of to free his father. Never mind father deserved to be there.
"And you are now Marked as one of his followers, as your father before you?"
The following weeks, Draco tried to fall back into his normal patterns, but for some reason, he couldn’t recall what they were. The few he could remember no longer felt right. Like he didn’t fit. He felt awkward, and strange, and even clubbing with Blaise no longer helped to distract him.
Draco focused on Shacklebolt, where he sat next to the leader of the Wizengamot, who had a stern expression, and the head of Magical Law Enforcement, who smirked slightly. Obviously, he was enjoying the fact he had all these Pureblood families under his power to sentence. Draco recognized him as a half-blood, if he remembered right. But he wouldn't let the man see his fear. He was still a Malfoy, and he would face his fate with dignity.
"But we agreed the charges against him are more than enough, Robards." Shacklebolt tapped his papers against the desk as though to straighten them, even as murmuring filled the courtroom. Sighing, he picked up his gavel and tapped it instead. "I must ask everyone to keep silent. This is a formal hearing, and we require silence to proceed. Any further disturbances will be dealt with as necessary." He waited for everyone to quiet, then focused on Draco once more. "Mister Malfoy, after you left Hogwarts that year, where did you go?"
He nodded. “Yes, mother. She is…suitable. And intelligent.” And male, but he wasn’t about to say that out loud.
"Sorry," Harry mumbled.
“You are a foolish boy,” Snape was telling him now that the women were gone.
"Right," Draco drawled. "What can you do to stop me they can't?"
Potter thought about it for a moment. "What are you offering in return? Or was the contract it?"
Draco turned to look at him, wide-eyed. How did Harry know that?
"What?" The word made no sense. At least not at first. Until he remembered his conversation with his host. Yes, he'd suspected he was Harry. That didn't make it true. This did.
“So…then…if I were to…”
You see, I never thought I would have a chance to fix things. Then Potter and his friends showed up in our Manor. It was him. How could I not know? I'd seen him after so many Quidditch matches and scrapes. I knew what he looked like as well as my own face.
Once they were gone, Lucius turned to his son. “It cannot be anything beyond friendship, Draco. Are we clear?”
The entire crowd turned to look at Draco at Harry’s pronouncement, and he couldn’t help but be glad that he wasn’t able to blush through his scales at the unexpected attention.
“Two.” The worst two. And the last… Draco leaned his forehead against the cool glass.
At first it was almost like freedom, because it wasn't Azkaban. He could do as he wished. Read at all hours. Sleep late into the day. Wear what he wished. Still, Draco found himself hating his prison. He couldn't leave, there was no one to talk with but an elf, and he knew it would be years before he would be free. How, he asked himself, was this any better than Azkaban, where his father now resided?
“You have to! I…” Draco took a deep breath. He was obviously not going to get anywhere this way. “One night. No touching?”
"This will stop the headache?"
to do, really. He looked at Harry, hoping he might have a solution.
“I want to know,” Harry whispered. “Even if…” His hand made another aborted movement, and Draco reached out to take it.
“Father…please tell me…” he whispered.
So he found himself separated from his parents, locked in the cells at the Ministry along with far too many other witches and wizards who'd found themselves on the wrong end of the war.
Potter flushed. Draco’d never seen that before. “You never did take a good look at me that day, you know. Surface only?”
“Yeah. It seems…there was someone else.”
The evil smile almost made him pull back his hand, but then Tom was grasping it, and he almost couldn’t hold back a sigh of relief when the man released it once more without trying to drag him off. Instead he grinned. “Have a lovely party, Prince Draco.” And then he spun around and quite literally vanished.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco stood up, turning to move toward the door.
“And Draco?” Harry asked her.
His minor place as a Death Eater wouldn't make any difference when it came to his sentence. The fact he was a Death Eater at all doomed him to be sent to prison. But at least he wouldn't face Harry any longer once they sent him to Azkaban.
Draco tried to fight another flush, raising his chin, but refusing to look away this time. "So? It’s not like you were ever going to like me, so why shouldn’t I treat you that way?"
Approaching the sables, Draco smiled to see Harry sitting out in the front of the building, pounding away at the anvil and working on shaping what he assumed was a horse-shoe.
“Harry?”
Turning back to Draco, Harry watched him for a moment before speaking again. “So…you’re from the castle…you live there all the time?” Draco nodded, more excited. “And…are you friends with the Prince?”
At least the other boy seemed to understand the stakes. "Yeah," Draco said softly. He reached out for his hand, needing to comfort as much as he needed the comfort himself, then froze when he felt a hand on his shoulder.
King Lucius tried not to frown at this pronouncement, but there was nothing he could do. Draco would have to learn that he had made his own choices, and this was what had come of it. He would worry about what would come once his son had learned his lesson. If that did not happen, well, he would have to find another heir anyway. He nodded. “And so I shall. And your name, sir?”
As their travels dragged on, Draco was certain he would die. Of heatstroke. Or possibly splinters and blisters. The bottoms of his feet felt like one solid blister. And when he’d taken off his shoes the night before, he’d been certain he’d seen some blood. Not to mention the state of his beautiful hands. His well-manicured nails were now ragged and broken where they hadn’t torn off completely. His hands looked no better than any common peasant’s already. It was horrific.
"I don't care why, Draco. You broke your promise. Here I was, stupidly beginning to believe I could trust you." He crumpled up the parchment, tossed it in the fireplace and set it ablaze. With a turn, he was gone. Draco was left alone once more.
“Oh, the man over there.” Harry nodded back towards the glowering man who had directed Draco to Harry.
Fingers swept across his forehead, and he opened eyes he hadn’t even realized he’d closed, looking up into Harry’s worried eyes. “Hurts?” he asked. Draco didn’t bother with words, just nodded. Harry kissed him again, then shifted and took him in hand, pulling a moan from him.
The blond seems not to want to answer, but he has been caught peeking, so he nods at the happy couple. “Potter. Weasley. I hear congratulations are in order?”
Somehow, hearing the words made it scarier. He supposed he'd expected to be reassured by knowing one way or another. But his own sentence still lingered in his future.
Draco jumped up from the bed, fear and joy equal parts in his heart. "Yes! Please!"
Harry smiled. "All right." He settled against the wall. "So what will you tell me today?"
“You do realize those are your only shoes, right?” Potter asked cheerily from the fireplace, where he was stirring up a pot.
"The headache is only a side-effect of the spell, Potter. Once it's broken, it won't be able to have any effect on you any longer."
He knew he did, but it was one thing to say it, and quite another to do it. "Easy for you to say, Pansy. You're not Marked. Besides, it could beanyone. What if…" He sighed.
Draco swallowed, focusing on his tray. "Thanks," he said softly. "It means a lot to me."
Harry had found a spot on the top of Draco’s head, and was scratching it in a way that was utter perfection. Draco leaned into his hand, but hadn’t realized he was making any noise until Harry’d said something. He blinked at the young man, then tried for a smile before realizing his face just didn’t work that way any longer.
“Thank you, father. I can take it from here.” Even as he stepped away from his father, he could sense others around and in front of himself. How he’d missed this before, he didn’t know. Each person had a singular signature, and Draco moved through the room, deftly avoiding the others, searching for the green-red-gold that was Harry, smiling when he “saw” him standing near four other signatures—one black-gold-silver, one brown-red-grey, one black-green-silver, and the last a bright burst of vibrant colors, some of which seemed to have no name he could think of.
Potter shook his head. "I can't, Malfoy. Not until your trial's done. You're supposed to be kept separate from the trials. They don't want you using someone else's defense to get free."
Narcissa turned to glower at her cousin. “He hardly needs you as an example, Sirius. Personally, I worry about Harry, with you at his side. Does he know just how deviant you are, Sirius?”
Draco watched as Potter left the room, his mouth agape. He’d been expecting Potter to say
“Did you like it, Draco?”
After Draco finished, he watched Harry's face silently, waiting for his reaction, worried the longer it took for him to do so.
"Headmistress," he said.
He simply had no clue what he could do to prevent his fate. He’d never been anywhere but this tower. He didn’t even know how to escape it. There were no doors, just windows. The witch and her pet just appeared and disappeared at will. Literally. If only he knew how to master that trick… But he did not.
A good question, that. And Draco didn’t really have an answer. “They’re bothering me more. To speak about them, I mean.”
"He was being a bully. Father always told me that was how Muggles treated us. So I assumed you were like me. I had to stop him."
"All right," Harry said, still grinning. He pulled his broom from the wall where he’d braced it, then straddled it. "Just straddle the handle, and hold on tight. It’ll probably be a bit scary at first, since you won’t be able to steer, but you’ll be fine, okay?"
Draco shrank back, horrified at the very thought. “Father, please…”
Harry’s hands slid away, and he looked down. “I’m sorry. I thought…”
It didn't stop them from trying, though. And each time a partygoer got caught, the punishment seemed to go up. Draco knew they hoped to discourage the gatherings, but none of the students seemed willing to give them up now.
“Ah, well, you’ll prettify the place up, now, won’t you?” Potter asked. “Come on. I’m just aching to try out those down mattresses your father gave us. And in the morning, it’s to market.”
“But…what happens if I can’t?”
Slowly, he began to undress, leaving the dirty robes where they could be found and cleaned by the servants, then made his way to the chamber where his bed sat, dressed only in thin cotton breeches.
, Potter.”
The day of the feast, the King and Queen spent the day showing off their new son to their people. He was dressed in a long, lacy gown that had been worn by generations of princes and princesses before him, laid out in a golden bassinette so that the people could file past to get a look at the sweet face of their future ruler.
"Your fellows," the head of the MLE said flatly.
“God…Draco…no. I…did a lot of thinking. After the battle. What that meant. What
So many answers came to Draco in response. It was easy to reject some, but others not as much. “And your friends? My family?”
Potter turned to look at him from where he was walking ahead of him. “Well, of course, Draco.” He took the water skin off his belt and held it out to Draco, who blinked at it. He wasn’t even sure he’d be able to close his fingers around it. What he was sure of was that the water would not fill his stomach.
"Y-yes."
“I…don’t know if I can,” Harry said softly.
He had no clue how he was going to fall asleep with his whole body aching the way it was, but he must have, for suddenly there was the bright light of the sun in his eyes, and a shadow standing over him. “Come on, pretty boy. Time to get moving. We’ve still got a long way to go.”
After another moment of hesitation, Harry nodded. "All right. What can it hurt, right?"
After a moment, the man nodded. "I'll see what I can manage." He turned to leave, and Draco felt more alone than before.
"Hey," Harry said, smiling at him.
“Even if?”
It was a mistake he wished he’d never made the next morning when he woke to a body curled around his. Of course, at first, he didn’t quite realize just
“Guess not enough to not want that.” Draco stood as well, leaning in and hesitantly pressed another kiss to Harry’s lips, gasping as Harry returned the kiss, his fingers rising to twine in that black hair he’d always wanted to touch, but had made fun of instead to convince himself he hadn’t.
“I am one of several, yes.”
. It was my fault Dumbledore died. Even if I didn't kill him myself."
Whimpering, Draco stumbled to his feet, though all he wanted to do was curl into a ball where he lay. When he took hold of the handles for the cart, he whimpered again as his aching fingers closed around them as tight as he could manage.
“I thought you had to get to work, Potter?” he asked sourly.
“Your friends aren’t much better, P-Harry. I mean…look at how they looked at me when I came in. And that was without you fawning all over me. If they find out you like me?”
Draco shook his head. “No. Not really.”
Draco tried not to respond to that, but it was a difficult thing. He hadn’t realized the man’s senses were so strong. All he could do was try to bluff it out. "You mean the bird that came to see me?" He asked.
“That might be a good many, Potter,” Draco said, unable to keep a smirk from his face.
When he caught sight of him, recognizable by the set of his shoulders and the way he scanned the room, Draco moved to intercept him. He saw the moment the other boy caught sight of him, and couldn't help but feel a warmth fill him as the other boy moved to meet him halfway.
"Potter, stop."
“Please, father.”
“Well, any country bumpkin can come here and pretend to be a princess, Draco. Surely you know that I have to test to be certain she is, indeed, of royal blood?” Behind his mother’s shoulder, Snape was smirking, and Draco felt his heart sink into his stomach.
Look at this. Ginny has turned to lead Harry to the bakery, and the two rivals come face to face.
But unbeknownst to the two arguing, another person had entered the room, and he chose this moment to clear his throat. The two turned, and Draco’s eyes widened as he took in the sight of the bedraggled man before them. His clothing was made more of patches than of whole cloth, and his hair was horribly bedraggled—or at least, the bits of it he could see beneath the peasant’s cap was. And horribly greasy from not being washed for some time.
And only we are left to witness Harry's face crumple. He stays alone in the living room for a very long time.
Draco scowled at him, ready to lambaste him for the gaffe, when he noticed the clothes Potter was wearing. Thick black velvet embroidered with gold, and glittering with gemstones along the front. A far cry from the clothes of a peasant. What was going on?
Padfoot shook his head. “Afraid not. Dogs and dragons don’t really have much in common, I’m afraid. I wouldn’t be able to understand him any more in that form than this.”
“No!” the King cried out. But it was too late. The spell was cast. And Tom was gone.
After dinner one night, almost a month after Potter had first arrived, Draco knocked at the door between their rooms. “Potter?”
“That is true, Harry. But that is because it is not a spell, truly. Merely started by one. He needs to choose to come back. And right now…he seems rather more happy as a dragon than he might be as an eighteen-year-old boy who is about to be married, wouldn’t you say?”
Potter looked surprised at this, then looked at Draco’s hand warily. “What do you mean by…start again?”
By the time the dishes were vaguely clean enough, Draco felt like a year-long bath wouldn’t be enough to make him feel clean. And he still had two more chores to accomplish. He sighed, then picked up a broom. But this task went little better. After all, the floor seemed to be made of packed dirt. So how was he to know when it was clean? It seemed a never-ending task.
“Draco…”
“That right?” Potter asked with a slight smile. “So…then it wouldn’t bother you to know that you were...
And we see that Draco understands now—perfectly—that it is he who is the someone else. He smiles softly. “Yeah.” He stands, but before he can hold out his hand, Harry beats him to it.
If Draco had been able, he would have gaped. He covered his astonishment at that as best he could.
“Go with them? Go with them where?” Draco asked in what he knew was far too sharp a tone. It was taking everything inside him to keep from shouting for the guards and clapping Harry in chains just to keep him here where he wanted him.
The King looked at him for a long moment, then nodded. “Very well. But if you hurt my son…”
"The first weekend in July of nineteen-ninety-six, sir."
The king nodded. "Narcissa’s sister was never a kind woman, and we feared she had hurt you, or worse. But you seem…quite whole," he said, a near-smile tickling his lips.
Something told Draco Harry might have other reasons, and now they weren't facing the Headmistress any longer, he couldn't keep from asking. "But you could have gotten in trouble with me. I mean, you don't know why I did it."
“All right. I suppose I’ll see you tonight? Or will I be serving as well?” he asked, shocked at how calm he managed to keep the words.
Draco quickly nodded too, still trying to recover from the shock Harry was actually helping him.
Snape scowled. "Very well, Headmistress. But I still think—"
“Then why?” Draco whined.
“Okay. Two. So…you’re almost done. You’ve told me the rest. Surely…”
"Tomorrow," he assured her. "Harry and I traveled quite some way, and…"
“May I ask…the name of my ‘protector?’” Draco asked as he passed him the water skin.
"Why are you telling me, Potter? It's no business of mine." Not that Draco didn't want to know, but he was startled Potter would share something like that with him.
