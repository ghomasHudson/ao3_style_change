Draco chuckled, "Yes that makes perfect sense, having been your girlfriend, your best friend's sister, and a good enough friend to floocall you about going to the club," he said, "I can't imagine how I got the impression that she would know anything about you."
Draco sighed, and acquiesced, “Hello, Hermione.”
"Mmm. I think you can manage both," Draco licked his lips and Harry nearly tackled him to the ground right then, fuck the consequences. He tried for a deep breath.
"Is that why?" Potter asks, rudely interrupting because, it turns out, he's still a self-righteous prick. "Is she right? You want to use her to get your reputation back?"
"Hello Lovegood," Pansy answered, keeping her eyes on Harry. Then, "Potter," with a slight nod.
He grimaced.
Malfoy had turned out to be, Harry was barely able to choke out the next two words, “A client?”
Harry took a breath and focused on the lights in the hallway, willing them to flicker dramatically. After a beat, he swallowed the jellybean and opened the door. "What's going on out here?" He asked, twitching his fingers slightly to restore the light to normal.
Across from him, Blaise was sitting on the matching couch dressed in what was left of a pearl-grey suit. Harry knew it was pearl-grey because that was the same color of the cabinets he’d chosen for the kitchen in the Burrow. The jacket was slung over an armrest, Blaise wasn’t wearing a tie and had the top two buttons of his shirt loosened, and his sleeves were rolled up to the elbows. Neville sat down beside Blaise, in jeans and a Puddlemore t-shirt, and gathered up the magazines that were scattered across the coffee table that sat between himself and Harry.
"Dudley," Harry said, obviously uncomfortable, "you should have called first. It would have made this," he gave a hesitant smile, "better."
"You think you can just ask for me and I'll give in, Potter?"
Harry didn’t reply, but Scorpius saw something dangerous flash in his eyes. He was used to seeing that look when Harry was talking about a particularly difficult arrest at work. He had rarely seen it when Harry was speaking with family.
"Last night was well worth being tired for my meetings today." It was a man's voice, it sounded like the loudmouth from last night, but his voice was rougher now.
Harry rolled his eyes, pulled out a chair across from him and sat down. “No, it’s just the post” he said, annoyed with how defensive it sounded.
The birthday party had been going for hours. It felt like the entire Wizarding World was packed into the Leaky Cauldron. Ron and Hermione had just left and Harry was watching Neville and Hannah expertly handle the bar. Those two had taken the Leaky to new levels since Hannah's father, Tom, had gifted the place to them for their wedding.
you, but I bet she wants you there." Pansy glances up now, giving Draco a significant look. "Potter will be there," she says.
Draco shook his head, trying to rid himself of the thoughts, and put his pen down. It was clearly time for a break and a cup of tea.
“Sort of,” she said when the match ended. “He went to some fancy private school that I’m supposed to be attending in September. Dad just wants me to get some information from him so that I don’t walk in blind.” Astrid and her Dudley had gone over this back story on the way home from Harry’s so she could talk about it with friends.
Harry kisses him back greedy and possessive, pulling Draco closer.  “I don’t know how I can miss you so much when I see you every day,” he says, his voice rough with desire, “but I’m starting to think it’s because of the way you greet me when I get home.”
Draco looked at him then, with a small smile, his silver eyes intense.
Harry stayed quiet, fixing Pansy with narrowed eyes. Maybe if he focused enough she would disappear, after all, Harry had made Aunt Marge balloon up and float away.
Draco huffs a laugh, which turns into a chuckle, which breaks into full laughter that he's shaking with. "This is just perfect."
Lucius cocked an eyebrow, “Do you truly believe we only keep files on people employed at the ministry?”
Lucius looked at him with disgust, “Are you implying that I wouldn’t have this information readily available at any time?”
Harry paused for a moment then cooly met her eye and said, "That's true actually. The hat wanted to put me in Slytherin."
"What are you going to do for work?"
Harry shrugged vying for innocence, "I don't really remember the whole conversation." Then he smiled, "See you at noon," and cut the link.
Blaise glanced at Draco who was eyeing the two of them like they were a curious puzzle he hadn't solved. Blaise reached out and pinched Draco's bicep.
Harry lifted an eyebrow, “Why? Going to refer me to someone?”
To his left, Draco chuckled briefly before covering his face with his hand and pulling himself back together. “I apologize,” the effect of his usual clipped tones was slightly ruined by his obvious attempts to reign in his laughter. “I don’t think this is funny. I just- While I agree with Harry that an inner-house party is commendable, a foam party is not.”
Potter shot one last glare at George's smirking face before responding. "What are you looking for?"
The fluffy insides melting in between his teeth as the syrup run slowly down his throat. He thought yet again that nowhere did breakfast as good as Hogwarts. Looking up as he continued to chew, he spotted Ginny standing as still as a post in the middle of the hall.
The clunk of the half-empty pint glass on the oak table was suddenly the only noise noticeable between the two men.
“I. Did. It.” He breathed out. Falling into the back of his chair as he screwed his eyes shut.
Air suddenly stopped gathering in Draco’s lunges.
“-I said, please sit down.”
His breathing was heaving thumping down on his lungs as he made eye contact with Ron and Hermione, him trying to convey a silent plea to stop the gossip between their friends.
“Malfoy.”
“It’s a week before Christmas, did you honestly think the Great Hall wouldn’t be decorated?” Hermione asked in disbelief, looking between the two boys.
He’s spent most of the day trailing around Hyde Park. He’d never admit it to Ginny but he couldn’t stand to be alone more than necessary in that house. It was only when it started to get dark and the tourists all started dispersing to go to their scheduled dinners that he went back to the house.
“Harry Potter is your mate? I understand your hesitation.”
*****
Harry wrapped his arms around her, letting his chin rest on the top of her head and his fingers played with her hair. Ginny smiled into his exposed chest, her breath falling in rhythm with his.
“Allure?” Draco nodded, stopping at the intricate snake pattern on the wall, “Veela produce allure to attract their mate, as you are unbonded you probably are producing it without you realising.”
“Okay, but-“
“You can’t do that, it’s immoral!” Granger snapped, Weasley trying to pull her back into his shoulder. “How did you even get Veritaserum?”
The room feel into a level of silence where all you can hear is your pulse thumping rhythmically through your ears. Swiftly Thomas turned to face Draco, a look of uncertainty mixed with anger apparent.
“No Potter, you haven’t,” he breathed deeply. “I just- well, I just haven’t found my mate yet.”
“I know,” she smiled and twirled away.
He could feel the crispness of the dried blood merging with the cotton on his back sticking together, it was inevitable that it would bleed again. The time had moved on but he wasn’t sure if it were mere minutes of hours. He was immobilised.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from pleading an enthusiastic,
Draco looked him over carefully, "I know it's not on purpose. You just don't know how to do anything without giving all of yourself."
Thank you so much for reading and being gracious about any editing mistakes! 💚💚
Draco forced himself not to linger on any one item, but he couldn't help notice the collars. He looked at the list, "What about magic blindfolds?" he asked.
Coming up - Grimmauld Place 🐍
"I'll take one too," Draco said, using that easy smile he apparently had more, on the sales clerk, "if you don't mind."
Harry briefly worried that the tight jeans his cock was trapped in would split at the seam if he got any harder. He bucked his hips up, seeking more friction.
Hopefully a new update will be ready by Wednesday! I know this one is later than my goal, but I have a schedule now! Wish me luck on keeping it :)
You can't misinterpret the sound of a good spanking, and someone was receiving one next door. Finally, he heard the man next door groaning and Harry assumed whoever was over there had gotten off. Harry took the opportunity to remove himself fully from the bed, shoving off his blankets and springing to his feet. He moved the bed a few inches from the wall, sending it a fresh glare before getting back under the covers.
“Thomas,” he managed to croak out with some attempt of a snark.
Sceptically, Ginny stood back up looking down at Draco. He looked high as a kite, bloodshot eyes framing his sweat-drenched pale face. He was leaning back again the cupboard wall but she could see tiny cuts in his shirt with what looked like blood seeping through. Her eyes darted towards his skeletal hand resting on his knee and she could make out nail cuts all inside his palms. There though, just under his hands was a damp patch surrounding his crotch. She felt sick.
“Will you tell me what happened with Dean? And what’s happening now?” Potter glanced back down to Draco’s face, tightened his hold on Draco who was finding it increasingly hard to concentrate.
“-Don’t worry about it,” she slurred, raising her glass in the air dancing. “I get why you do it now.”
“Draco,” she slowly stood to her full height. “You may not be one of my patients, and I may not understand the choices that you have made in your life, but I will always respect your privacy as any decent healer should.”
Another piercing pressure erupted from his lower back. His hips jolted forward in reaction and one knee gave out causing him to stumble off balance.
“H-Harry…”
“He has a girlfriend Pans and she’s… Nice, he even smells like her most of the time… It makes me want to rip her limb from limb.”
- even if those were the spell that won them the war! Worst of all, if he felt like anything fishy was occurring the staff and Order would straight away put him down telling him just to focus on his studies. He was expected to just be a normal seventeen year old wizard but carry the burden of being ‘the chosen one’.
“-Not important,” Potter brushed off. “I guess it’s your turn Malfoy?”
Each squeal was periodically timed and dashed passed his ears in a descending atonal scale, not dissimilar to the enhanced version of the Merpeople’s riddle in fourth year. The feminine tones crescendoing on his approach to the area in question and his pulse quickened, the hospital wing.
Potter shifted on the charmed bed, careful not to break their contact. Draco accessed his mate’s face, he looked tired and frustrated, something which Draco had a strong urge to fix but he also noticed Potter’s eyes flickering to Draco’s bare torso.

during the war-“
“I’ve heard you refuse to mate,” she rested her hands on top of each other on the desk. “I’m sure you’re aware you have only a matter of weeks if you don’t?”
She cackled as he hip sways, “don’t blame you the way your jaw’s swinging”
Potter. I am treated as
Back off my holiday and I've managed to get myself a new job! This chapter is a bit of a filler for the next one. I'm not completely happy with how this chapter is but I just wanted to get something up xx
“What did you just say, Ginny?” He growled, standing up and looking clearly at his girlfriend in front of him.
Harry instinctively slipped his hand deep into his coat pockets and sighed.
“Somebody should tell him to leave!-”
He took a deep breath, his eyes blinking manically. The same fingers that had been dancing over Draco’s cheek now rubbed over confused green eyes. In what felt like seconds, those fingers gripped the doorknob and he ran. Leaving the pale blonde boy alone in the cupboard.
*****
He attempted to rise half his mouth into a crooked smile and shook his head. “No, he’s happy.”
Potter let out a humourless laugh and straightened himself out on the tiny bed cot.
******
“Tell me why I’m here,” he exasperated, “why did I have to hold your hand for two days? Why were you dying? What’s wrong with you?”
The tiled floor of the cupboard was littered with a thick layer of dust and Draco’s crumpled body. The tears had stopped almost as quickly as they had arrived, the trails of them dried onto his sunken cheeks. His grey eyes perpetually staring at a tin of
He tried to shake his head, but he could taste bile coming up his throat.
Two days later was his seventeenth birthday.
Unfortunately, Harry suddenly felt himself again but with a burning rage building in his stomach.
“I had a little biiiit,” she giggled, twirling around to the steady piano accompaniment.
“I didn’t! I wouldn’t!” Liquid slowly descended from the corner of Draco’s hazy eyes.
He could. He could hear every last laugh down the corridor, every last person gasping his name in hysterics. He could hear it all.
Harry quirked his mouth, he’d spent all afternoon going through theories behind Malfoy’s odd behaviour. They had discussed the possibility of the dark mark reacting around Harry’s presence, Malfoy having PTSD and the prospect Draco had had his pumpkin juice spiked.
She sighed, “Madam Pomfrey could end up in serious trouble if you don’t.”
“It’s a bit of a fucking predicament, right?”
“Muggle?” Draco inquired, still staring across the room. “Florence Nightingale was one of the founders of St Mungos, it’s engraved above the doors. Are you really that obtuse Potter?”
Potter rolled his head back against the wooden shelves and let out an exasperated groan to the ceiling. “Still got like six minutes left, Ginny’s gonna kill me."
Draco clenched his fists and felt his traps tense around the open wounds on his back.
“He was dying-“
A flash of red hair darted between the crowds on the staircases up to the third floor. Harry manoeuvred through the robed bodies until he could wrap his hand around her wrist pulling her back to him.
“Ah, so you did just want a fight,” her hand slipped down from his cheek on to stubbled jaw, slowly caressing down his sweating torso until she rested her hand gently over his crotch.
“Answer me!”
The double-click of her kitten heels slapped against the stonework of the corridor, the signifier of her departure. For now. He let a deep breath from the bottom of his lungs slip through his nostrils, leaving an airy chill on the lower half of his face.
The tense man let out the breath of air he didn’t realise he was holding. His mind quickly switching from worry to panic.
“I don’t know what you are talking about Potter,” he managed to wheeze out. He kept a clenched fist pulsating under robes, the occasional droplet of blood rolling into his palm.
McGonagall drifted up the steps to the risen part of the office, her feet taking her around the expansive desk to sit in a regal chair. It wasn’t the same as Dumbledore’s but it still oozed power and a need for respect.
“Dean, truth or dare?” Draco’s eyes lifted, watching the boy sip his drink confidently.
“Mr Potter, I’m so sorry I haven’t the time to explain but please just come with me”.
Blinking Harry stared down at the pureblood, his mouth dry. Slowly, he pulled the cold chair back across the stone floor causing a screech that almost matched Malfoy’s high pitch. He carefully perched into the chair, feeling the chill of the untouched metal penetrating through his jeans and hitting his thighs. Raising one shaky hand, he hovered his palm over the talon and slowly lowered it.
“Mr Malfoy?” Not again. He slowly turned to face an emotionless Professor McGonagall. “If you wouldn’t mind joining me in my office now?”
I am going over some of the other chapters and just going over some issues like spelling and grammar as I've never had a beta so little changes may occur but nothing major.
“Well, explain it to me then!” Ginny quickly stood up, placing herself strategically between Harry and the exit.
The uneven spiral staircase up to the classroom was always a difficult mission, odour ridden teenagers shoving up against you trying to get the best seat in the class. He followed his normal regime, keep tense with an arm to the wall, squeezing through the crowds so nobody would notice.
“H-He, he…” Draco feebly pointed over to the corner, “he attacked me!”
“Sorry,” she muttered. “Let’s go in, yeah?”
“…Malfoy.”
The brunette sighed, feeling a thick lump rolling about in his throat.
to Thomas?”
“Come on, let’s sit you down,” he carefully wrapped an arm around her dainty waistline and guided her to a section of the Gryffindor table that was empty.
“I’m not obsessing! I’m merely viewing the whereabouts of everybody.” Harry replied without even looking up from the yellow stained parchment open on his lap. If his eye had been on the feet labeled Draco Malfoy… Well there is nothing wrong with being vigilant.
“I-I’m a Death Eater, I’m sick and dangerous. The Ministry are just doing their jobs and preparing to tick another Death Eater off their list. That’s all.” The scabs on his back bag to itch. “I really don’t need your pity or-“
“Who invited him?”
“-Blood?” He pushed her back to look in her sore eyes, searching for an answer.
*****
Draco didn’t make it to the bed, he crumpled down onto the floor. His robe catching on a splinter of wood on the doorframe.
“What do you want Parkinson?” He glared.
“Oh,” Potter glanced down to their connected hands feeling Draco tense. “This is what Ginny meant.”
“Really Malfoy? Don’t think you’re getting too old for this act?” Draco twisted his head to face his Mate, every second burning into his irises. Potter sat back on his heels.“…You need to start actually owning up to the shit you put others through, if it wasn’t for Pomfrey you wouldn’t even be here right now Malfoy…”
Shrugging, her gaze drifted past him towards the doorway, “so where is he then? Having to recover or something?”
He kept his head low, avoiding her stare. There were tiny chip marks in the mahogany, he ran his nails in the grooves wondering what had caused them in the first place.
Dean Thomas frowned down at Malfoy. Even through there was only an inch between the two boys, Draco felt tiny in front of the Gryffindor. Draco instinctually wrapped an unsteady hand around the bottom of his wand that poked out of his trouser pocket.
“The Ministry are also aware.”
“Your back looks like you had been burnt, it was so blistered. In my professional opinion, you really need to-“
“You asked for what will help,” she gave him a pointed look across the table. “That is your
Nervously, everyone slowly turned back to the game. Draco smiled at Pansy, “You’re a bitch.”
“Gin?”
Robotically Draco stood up, letting the alcohol sieve through his body. He stumbled over to the group and fell straight on his arse next to Pansy and Shitland. He knew they were all looking at him, he could even feel Potter’s gaze boring into his cheek.
“Yeah, then I can just be left alone,” he paused. “Unless…”
“W-what?” He stuttered.
“Malfoy.”
A large intake of air slowly exhaled through Draco’s nose, the blonde boy didn’t even realise he was holding it in.
*****
“You heard me,” Draco replied in a harsh whisper, his eyes diverting to the inky stain on his arm.
“What are you?” Draco swallowed deeply, unsure that his planned lie to Potter would work now. “Malfoy? What the hell is going on, why are aurors guarding you? Why are you making weird noises?”
“Pomfrey said that without me he’ll die,” Harry groaned. “Why can’t he just find his actual mate and not drag me into this?”
Even with ‘allure’, Draco was sure he looked a right mess. For one, his hair was absolutely filthy, two, he had dried blood all over him and third his pale skin appeared ghostly in the candlelight.
“Hmm.”
“It doesn’t work like that, he hates me more now than he ever has anyway,” he croaked. “Who would want a convicted Death Eater and attempted rapist near them?”
Madame Pomfrey closely watched the Malfoy boy’s face, accessing his emotions.
“You finished it.”
Everything was too much. He slammed his eyes shut. All of his thoughts clouded by the subtle smell of soap and brooms. An intense force putting pressure on his spine.
“Mmmmm, but there wasn’t a lot left”.
“Draco,” she sighed “Your wings have begun sprouting.”
The blonde frowned.
“You love it,” she winked.
Pansy quickly shuffled onto her knees, an unsteady arm reaching out to point at him, her green eyes wide in awe. He could see clearly that her crisp white blouse now had two equal slashes through it with red slowly seeping to the cotton. He peeked down to his hands and saw his fingers replaced with short bloody talons. The scales surrounding the sharp appendages blended seamlessly with his pasty white skin. “D-Draco, you have w-wings!”
“You don’t talk to me anymore,” she whispered softly to the floor. “All you ever seem to do is bring me here and once we’re done, we’re done.”
“But that’s the thing Professor,” he spat. “People expect
“Language Mr Weasley!”
Draco dropped his head into his hands, letting his boney fingers sift through his greasy hair. It felt like his ribcage was on fire, scorching his flesh from inside out. “Please don’t make me say it… He just doesn’t want me.”
The headmistress glided over to the desk where Draco was perched. He could see Potter rolled his eyes. He pretended it didn’t rip out his heart.
“Oh hello,” Ginny beamed down on her boyfriend.
Draco’s head emerged slowly from behind his manmade cover, the red in his eyes matching the patches of blood on the wings. Pansy leant in closer, on her hands and knees. The Veela appearing taken aback.
Harry took a deep intake of breath, filling his lungs to the max before slowly letting all the air swift out through his nostrils.
Draco sighed. It was common knowledge that after the war, one of the first laws Minister Shakelbolt approved was the restriction of Death Eaters accessing aid at St Mungos. It was lucky that he got a second chance at finishing his 7th year. A sense of unease fogged up his chest, it was getting tighter. This was it, this was the end for Draco.
The teen witch pulled the curtain to one side and perched on the side of the bed, revealing the girl’s dormitory to Draco. Her hair had begun waving at the ends and her face bare of make up, she looked much younger now.
“-I-I-,” he looked close to vomiting, his mouth twisting in pain. “-Katie. Katie Bell”
She slowly crossed her legs, not taking her eyes off his grey ones.
McGonagall turned to face Harry wide wide eyes, “you heard Madame Pomfrey, get in Potter”.
The corridor fell still for a moment until a sarcastic laugh erupted from the bottom of Potter’s gut, it was cruel and taunting.
“My, my, my… What do we have here?” Cooed Pansy.
Harry forced out some disinterested noise his head still stuck on the map.
I'm pretty sure this is the longest chapter I've posted so far but I felt like I owed you guys it after waiting for so long! I've literally just finished it so I can't be one hundred percent certain about errors, I just wanted to get it up. Please enjoy xx
It had been a private thought that pretty much everyone had had when returning to school in September: would Hogwarts be the same? Of course, there was superficial damage and wings that were restricted due to the unsafe structure, but Hogwarts itself seemed as normal as ever, not an echo of war in sight.
“Did you know inexperienced Veelas attract more Wrackspurts than the average wizard?”
The agonising sensation was still at the forefront of his mind but it was lessened by the tiny tender buzzing in his blood. A confirmation of his worst thoughts. Potter was close.
“Why didn’t you say anything if you knew?”
“Well that’s what’s caused all this shit.”
His breathing became erratic, he bought his head down into his lap and slowly started rocking back and forth. The darkness engulfing his every emotion, only the soft tones of Luna humming connecting him to the outside world.
Harry blinked at his girlfriend and tried to pull himself further up the chair to a normal position.
Draco ran his tongue over his teeth, “can’t refuse what isn’t on offer.”
“So, let me get this straight,” she paused. “The Malfoy boy told you he was your temporary mate because you kissed?”
Raped.
“Right-“
“Oh fuck,” Potter rushed, “have I just asked you some super personal veela question?”
“That’s all I can ask for.”
At the sound of Harry’s timbre, she turned to look him, her eyes wide and concerned.
Clumsily, Draco wrapped himself tighter in his robes, having to bum shuffle slightly on the tiles to free the excess fabric he was sat on. He wanted to flee but he was a still as the water on the lake. All the memories of Potter swirling in Draco’s mind. Disgusting. Pathetic. Stay out of my way. Disgusting. Disgusting.
“You have potions,” Draco sighed as he pushed himself up on his elbows with great difficulty, “I’ll see the school year out”.
Harry stilled. He stepped back abruptly, eyes cemented on Draco’s crotch.
“G-Get the hell o-off me!” The burning was only getting worse with the prolonged physical contact. Only a mate can touch their Veela. Draco swung his back and forth like a shimmy to escape the touch but Thomas’ grip was too strong. “P-Please…”
“How would it have looked Gin? I can battle against dark forces from the age of eleven but I’m too scared to get in a cupboard with bloody Malfoy!”
“For fuck sake Draco!” She flung her arms in the air dramatically. “The first time you decided to be bloody selfless.”
“I can barely walk in these-these…things!” He beckoned down to the incredibly tight black trousers suffocating his groin. They were Pansy’s, and that made the whole situation ten times more humiliating, people could literally see the outline of his bits and pieces. It was explicit. He also had to wear a charmed black t-shirt that she wore to bed. She had told him it was fine if his wings made an appearance as she wasn’t too attached to it. Not that it made him feel any better.
Harry jolted back, looking down to Draco’s spindly white fingers in confusion.
“Can you at least charm this chair into a sofa then Professor?”
The countdown had stopped and all of Draco’s focus was directly on his mate’s parted lips nearing his. Harry’s lips slowly brushing across Draco’s lower lip, an acidic taste forming between the two boys. A slight flicker of Harry’s tongue, hydrating the Slytherin’s dried lips, each flaked piece of skin suddenly penetrated by his mate’s saliva. He couldn’t move, allowing Harry to suckle on his bottom lip, pulling and releasing. A bubble of ecstasy erupting, droplets of tears seeping from his eyes and delicately landing between him and Harry adding a twist of salt to their taste.
“Now, either I don’t have the right ‘equipment’ or I was just too easy for you.” Pansy’s breath invaded Draco’s space and even though they weren’t touching her chest was brushing against his loosened tie. “Do you want me to fight you because it would be my pleasure?”
She hummed thoughtfully, “and what do you think of all
“Dean isn’t normally like that-“
“You can’t come here anymore,” Pomfrey sighed as she waved her wand over Draco’s head, taking his vitals.
“She’s doing it again. Harry?”
Pomfrey carefully approached him, like he was a baby cub and she was out on the Boxing Day hunt. She pulled the steel framed chair from the next bed and dragged it to his bedside. Letting the screeching of the chair legs on stone consume the whole wing.
“I’m tired, Pansy. I’m so fucking over this, nobody wants me here! You even resent me a little bit. I wanted out, is that so hard to comprehend?” He spat out, hands flailing everywhere.
“B-Because,” Potter exasperated with his hand flapping in the air, “veelas are girls! That’s why!”
Both boys looked at the whimsical blonde like she had grown a second head. Whatever dangerous game Luna was playing, Draco was sure he didn’t want to be part of it. He braced himself to leave.
“So what about you Harry? Christmas plans?”
Her thin cherry lips quirked into a sweet smile, “you weren’t very discreet Draco.”
“Please, can someone just tell me what the hell is going on?”
“Malfoy is fine,” Harry rushed and looked directly at his best friend. He couldn’t believe he had left Ginny alone. The whole reason he had gone to the Hospital Wing that night was to try and pacify Ginny, so how could he have completely forgotten about her.
Running a hand through her tamed hair, Pansy quickly shook her head, “no.”
A couple hours in and Draco was nursing a bottle of firewhisky on the staircase to the dormitories. He hadn’t seen Pansy in an almost an hour, it didn’t matter. He was solely focused on the figure sat underneath the Weasley girl. He took another swig, letting it burn down his throat. The Golden Trio had arrived with the other Gryffindors just after his own arrival. Thomas was there too. They were greeted like royalty, Potter landing a seat right in the middle of the room on an ornamental settee. Crowds engulfing them like flames. Potter sat there laughing with his arm casually draped over his girlfriend's waist as she perched on his knees.
Looking directly at the Headmistress, Harry could see the darken lines framing her bloodshot eyes and the sagging layers of pale skin.
“No Pansy, I wish it was that easy,” he allowed his voice to seep out. He let his eyes drift over the pathetic wings resting on his legs. “They won’t go back in, this shouldn’t have happened.”
“I shouldn’t have brought up the past, I knew you were traumatised about not being able to, you know, do it. It was unfair.”
“But-“
Draco could feel Potter’s eyes burning into his lowered head, but he couldn’t lookup.
Draco could feel a burst of fiery anger bubble throughout his veins as he stared at his mate. His internal talons pushing against the back of his hand ready to break out.
Harry frowned, “that’s the game Ginny? You kissed Gareth Millard barely twenty minutes ago!”
Sharp tones continued to murmur from the aged oak door. Draco couldn’t blame her, she’d been living out this routine four times a day for three days. The aggressive knocking, the demands, the threats. He’d heard it all before.
It's a Christmas miracle. I've updated.
“I just wanted to know what I did,” her voice barely a whisper. “I thought it would make us closer”.
“Why? Don’t I deserve the truth, Harry?”
The girl looked up at his boyfriend with big eyes and pulled a small smile onto her lips, “s’alright. I just want us to be okay… And I’m sorry I finished it”.
“We kissed.”
I've recently got a new job and literally have just got back off holiday so this is a super quick update as it has been a while.
“Did I do it to get a two-page article about being a bloody freak of nature in the Prophet? Or to make more people throw hexes at me down the corridor; or maybe it’s because I want the Ministry and the Department for Magical Creatures breathing down my back for any more reason to ship me back to Azkaban,” he spat viciously, his volume only growing. “Or did I do it to get the attention of the Harry bloody Potter and have people believe I tried to rape him too?”
“Not a lot,” she smiled innocently. “You’d had most of it, so I just finished it”.
While they were all interesting and slightly amusing options, none of them felt right. He couldn’t put his finger on it but Malfoy had been acting sketchy since the beginning of the school year. It was apparent the boy had no friends and yes, Harry was aware of the teasing but there was something else.
“I held your hand.”
After a few moment, the Healer stood from behind her tattered desk and headed towards the exit, quickly flinging the door open.
Draco knew his wings would be beautiful, most definitely the most attractive part of him, Veela or not. He hoped he would get to see them. He knew his personality was nothing to be desired nor was his body after the physical strain it was going through. However, a good Veela should never reveal his wings, unless it is to his mate and that wasn’t an option for Draco.
His mate’s voice pulled him from his head, “hmm?”
“Honestly Ron! I think he just feels guilty. You said he’s been following you, but he never makes contact or tries to get close. Perhaps he just wants to keep an eye on you, maybe return the favour after you saved his life?”
The warmth coming from Potter’s hand suddenly felt like it had cooled off slightly within Draco’s body.
“Looks like the ‘oof still does work then mate,” Ron choked out from his mouthful. Harry smiled and throw a nod over in the direction of his best friend as he sat down.
He’s reheated some shepherd’s pie that Molly had made with a warming charm and chewed through the tepid mince. After chucking his plate in the sink for later, he headed up to the second floor to the library; the least hated room of the house.
“To temporarily mate with me,” he erupted, “Jesus.”
With another curt nod, the redhead raised up on her toes and planted a chaste kiss on the corner of his lips careful to avoid directly where Malfoy had supposedly been.
Draco wasn’t familiar with this muggle game, but seven minutes in each other’s presence seemed just about doable.
“Auror Scavage, I thought I informed you to keep this area clear!”
“What?” Harry resumed swilling his drink, “asked about what?”
“You have to do something or you know what will happen.”
She took a few steps back and slumped down a bookcase onto the floor.
His cheeks flushed vibrantly, shaken palm slapped over his mouth. Katie sat awkwardly to the side of him glancing at the carpet.
“I know.”
“What were you thinking? Sometimes I swear you’ve got a death wish Draco,” She spat across the cotton sheets pacing back and forth at the end of his bed.
“Draco…” Pansy appeared in the background of his reflection, a shocked face encroaching in his view.
“Truth or dare Harry?” Potter glanced to his friends laughing, Draco wanted that sounded embedded in his mind forever.
“I-I swear, I didn’t touch him, I swear,” Draco finally stuttered out.
“Who do you fancy in this room?” A girl who Draco didn’t know chuckled. The boy, wide-eyed, shook his head.
Wide eyes, Draco pushed himself further up the bed, ignoring the twists of pain and peeked his head around the drapes trying to avoid eye contact, “um morning Pansy.”
“Ravenclaw are hosting a social gathering Friday, you should come…” Luna’s smooth Irish accent filled the empty corridors, it was strange to have a conversation with a willing participant. “Dean isn’t a bad person Draco, but I do think he is wrong.”
allure just made him want to be vengefully close to me. He knew everyone would naturally believe him over me, and he took great pleasure in telling me that afterwards.”
A deep chortle interrupted him.
“-No Potter, you asked your question. Now it’s my turn,” Draco returned his sight to the other boy, assessing his body language. “Do you regret saving me from the fire during the war?”
“Or in Azkaban!”

The insides of his mouth were red raw, blood flooding his throat in pain by the time the next round kicked off. He harshly swallowed it down.
Everything felt too familiar, the waft of sausages and soap invading his nostrils. Those dark brown eyes penetrating his skull and the stone wall grazing the scabs on his tender back.
Silence. The whole common room dissipated into an overbearing silence, letting his name echo around each and every person. Nausea drifted into Draco’s system, the firewhisky threatening to burn his throat yet again on its way back up.
“You managed to hear about the ferret down at Hagrid’s then?” Ron frowned suspiciously.
“Excellent Miss Weasley!” Flitwick clapped. Draco raised his eyelids and watched the Weasley Girl straighten her back at the praise.
“She knows,” he threw his arms up exasperated. “I told her I did it. She didn’t believe me, Pomfrey-“
“Right,” Harry inhaled. His mind was spinning with this information. People genuinely believed he hurt Malfoy because he was spiked. Jesus Christ, things were getting messy.
“Malfoy asked the exact same thing,” he huffed darkly, eye’s settling on Dumbledore’s empty portrait . “And no, just what he’s told me but he’s not exactly a reliable source of information.”
“He’s still not here,” she breathed out, tears gathering in either eye. “You did this.”
Harry faulted.
“And why can I not be veela Potter?” Draco feigned disinterest as he glanced upwards to face his mate who looked equally confused and angry.
Draco frowned, “why do you look like a trollop?”
Harry cracked a dry eye open and took in his surroundings.
She started laughing.
Hermione gasped, “Harry, you can’t possibly spend Christmas alone!”
A frown formed on the pale boy’s face.
Harry licked his chapped lips and rolled his tongue against the back of his teeth, “yes”.
“Ginny,” he turned to Draco, his face stony, “she said she found you covered in blood and uttering weird stuff about love…”
After a few seconds, he let out a wheezy cough that echoed around the stone room.
“Harry stop,” she whispered, trying to wiggle out of his strong grip. He clearly didn’t notice as his tongue lapped up the side of her jaw, arms caging her against the wall. “Stop it Harry.”
As a veela he should have felt proud to catch that intimate glance, but as Draco Malfoy, he was utterly ashamed. He was far too skinny and marked all over, there was nothing for him to feel proud of. He discreetly tried to pull the mangled sheets up higher, but Potter noticed and reverted his gaze to the ceiling.
The healer continued her whispers of comfort and after a few minutes, Draco’s small trills went to wheezy cries and then shaky breaths.
“Yer a sick bastard,” Finnegan pipped up, tightening his grip on Thomas.
Deep down, Draco was more than aware of this eventuality. After discovering there were no more potions for him, it was a frequent worry. He couldn’t expect anyone to want to go out of their way to aid an Ex-Death Eater. His death was fast-approaching and it was probably going to meet him before the month was up.
I honestly don't know.”
Elegantly, Pansy twirled in front of him, her hair bouncing around her chin. She did decide to change. Into a black dress that Draco didn’t think look any less ‘trollop-y’, but who was he to judge in his current predicament. She liked it and it distracted Draco from his attempted suicide mission.
“The war,” he replied plainly.
“Y-you’re Veela?”
Unfortunately, life has been really crazy at the minute. My department at work has been shut down and I was made redundant so I've not been in the right mindset to be writing. So this chapter may be a bit stiff but hopefully it will fill the gap! Please let me know your thoughts xx
“Why hasn’t he been expelled yet?”
“Did you say something Dray?”
After his conversation with McGonagall, Harry couldn’t face going back to the Hospital Wing. He’d spent every minute there with Malfoy since Sunday and the thought of having to go back there was causing his insides to churn.
“Why?” He croaked out.
The older woman clasped her skeletal hands together, her eyes watching them meet on her lap.
Scavage stepped forward, “I ain’t been an auror for sixteen year ta be lied to by kids. Now, I’ll ask ya again Potter. What ya doing ‘ere?”
“-Until I find his other mate.”
Suddenly his shoulders were on fire, every pore of skin exposed to Thomas’ palms shaking him back and forth.
“What? I mean do you really think that would help?” He spluttered out, his breathing going double time.
“-Hey Luna.” A velvety voice waltzed down the corridor, those two words leaving Draco’s core vibrating. He didn’t need to look up to know why he had suddenly started perspiring.
“No. They can’t be,” he furiously shook his head, this was not possible.
“That’s what she said.” Draco let out a pitiful laugh.
Luna’s bright blue eyes appeared over the pages of the Quibbler, frowning slightly.
“Yes. Was,” she sighed. “You will have to discuss the details with Draco when he wakes, there are things only he can address”.
Draco blinked at the secretive Gryffindor; he could feel the heat beneath his skin start to increase in temperature. He mumbles his next question.
“I’m serious Malfoy,” he took a quick step forward encroaching on the Slytherin’s space and like a dance, Draco mirrored his step so he had his back against the wall.
Deeply swallowing, Ron wiped the evidence of his breakfast off with the arm of his jumper, “I had no doubts, you said it would and it did! Harry here though, well he wasn’t too sure.”
“He knows you need treatment for an affliction, and you cannot receive it,” she inhaled deeply. “He is also not stupid Draco. He knows it’s something about him that brought you back and I am positive he will have many questions for you.”
“You know nothing of veela do you Potter?”
“That’s enough Mr Potter.” Potter crept back to the Weasel like a kicked hippogriff. “I will have to contact the Wizengamot Draco… Though, I would be intrigued to know how you brewed  this potion on school grounds too.”
“Why not?” Potter’s response didn’t miss a beat. “I mean is that why you’re here?”
“-my what?” Draco turned to suddenly face his mate; his eyes wide. Pomfrey had conveniently forgotten to tell him he had bloody talons for hands. Also, the fact that Potter had seen.
With a careless brush against Draco’s robes, the slightly hunched over Weasel advanced further up the stairs and disappeared into the crowd leaving an uncomfortable presence lingering next to Draco’s side. A stolen glance confirmed his feelings. He easily recognised those vibrant eyes complimenting a bemused facial expression. He paid no mind to the Ex-Death Eater, just watched his best friends depart.
Before Draco could even capture his next breath, Potter was in front of him. His clothed knee mere inches away from Draco’s, his rhythmic breaths smacking Draco in the face.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it”. Harry glanced at his friend whose face had sunken like a sad puppy and was arched over his beer. “Ginny’s worried about ya, so’s Mione and even though Dean couldn’t make it tonight, don’t mean he hasn’t asked about it”.
Let me know your thoughts in the comments please? Pretty sure this is my longest chapter to date!
“-Bloody good at potions and wouldn’t put it past him”
He gritted his teeth and clapped his eyes shut, “stop Pansy. Just stop.”
*****
Potter spoke first, “Luna-“
“Gin, I don’t know how you knew about it but that was the last bit I had,” he pathetically whispered as he slopped backwards into the chair.
He stared at her with irritation. That didn’t matter.
*****
Draco let his sunken eyes flicker around the abandoned desks before landing on his captor.
“You-you didn’t?” Harry nodded, “Oh my god. Someone else must have attacked him! I-I just thought you were protecting yourself!”
In seconds it was all over, Harry's eyelids fell into a frown. Perfection morphed quickly into something all too familiar.
*****
“Punch Malfoy.”
“You were gone for forty minutes,” he uttered an exasperated snort.
“Oh, I think I’ll just have a quiet one at Grimmauld Place.”
Shame filled him. One kiss, that was all it took and of course Potter had to be privy to Draco’s shame.
“What on earth are you talking about?” Draco frowned, he attempted to sit up further without vomiting.
The blonde boy crunched his eyelids down in pain, preparing for what was next.
“So the rules are simple,” Finch-Fletchley blurted out to the teenagers. “You two have to go in the broom closet down the hall and stay there for seven minutes!”
Draco shut his eyes, enjoying the dullness his eyelids gave him.
Empty emerald armchairs were scattered around the dark room and a crisp sound of flames flickering from the fireplace filled Draco’s ears. He kept his head bowed and limped forwards to the dormitories, letting his fringe fall in his face. Every step he took, his worn Italian oxfords scuffed the surface of the plush carpet.
Zabini whisper-shouted. "About how he smells, and his skin, and his pretty eyes, and his perfect hair, how he showers too much, and has a nice smile, and should I keep going? Because I can. You certainly do. You go on about him all day."
, which she dodged. She shot out
"Uncle Harry," Astrid's voice was sweeter than it had been before, she was looking up at him with large innocent eyes. Scorpius' focus sharpened at the change as he watched her take Dudley's hand. "My Dad told me that you would know what to do. Will you please just answer a few of my questions? I'd be willing to offer something in trade. I am quite good at chores." At the end she flashed Harry the most earnest smile that Scorpius had ever seen, with the obvious exception of Harry's own smiles.
Draco grimaced, "I think so."
Blaise sat between Draco and Romilda Vane. "You seem better lately," he said to Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
When she passes Draco in the hallway she gives him a saucy wink and heads upstairs.
Harry huffed and decided to let it go. They turned a corner and stepped up to the shop. There was a guy standing out front blocking the entrance. When the boy turned around Harry recognized him as Zacharias Smith.
Draco smiled, "How you what, Potter?"
"Are you familiar with all of these?" she asked.
Neville drug in a deep breath, held it, and let it out in a rush. "All right. Ok. I'm ready."
“It said I was meant to
Draco sat in his office, reading over the reports sent from Love and Lust about vampire bites. The door opened and he looked up to find Granger smiling at him.
The article had been in the morning edition of the Prophet on Friday, June 26th. That morning, Harry was already in the west wing working on the dorms when Pansy showed up at precisely 9am.
“Oh, I would,”
“No problem,” Harry replied.
"No," Narcissa said, never looking away from Harry. "We are not done here. I addressed you. Please, finish the sentence."
The two of them snuck into their rooms to change for the interview. Hermione had set them up to meet with Rita and her photographer in the great hall.
“How do I choose who I want?”
The door opens but Potter isn't in his robes. Draco's eyes drop over the t-shirt, spread tight across his muscled shoulders, and dark jeans. He almost looks like he's going out to pull. Draco shakes his head to clear it of thoughts he should
Harry always left at 5 so he could miss any other students at the floo, but he and Pansy lost track of time. At 5:30 they got a visitor.
By the 2nd weekend in July Scorpius realized the summer was moving too quickly. He was brewing Pepper Up potions for his father’s business during the week, weekly Quidditch games with Teddy and the Weasleys, keeping up with the reading list Hermione had set forth at the beginning of Summer, and spending his weekends with Teddy and Astrid. Though, to be fair, Astrid was more than willing to help keep him focused on the reading list. The moment Scorpius was done with a book he would pass it off to Astrid, which at least gave her a break from the Hogwarts textbooks she was burning through. Astrid liked to sit with him during potion-making on Fridays too, filling him in on her muggle life and asking a steady stream of questions about his brewing.
Catching his eye, Hermione asked, "Harry pulled some kind of prank on you?"
“I’d like to go over the file with you,” he replied, “if you have time.”
Pansy dashed over to him, saying, "Draco, I need to-" she looked at Blaise and narrowed her eyes. "You evil rat! You've already told him, didn't you!?"
James nodded, not really able to remember what they were talking about. The press of Teddy’s fingertips was bursting through him like a streak of magic. He took a steadying breath, but it didn’t help. He was definitely getting hard. The stupid water, even with the jets, was clear. James bit his lip, trying to think of some way to fix this before he ruined it. He wanted to stay here, to enjoy Teddy. He didn’t even mind getting hard with no immediate release.
"What do you mean it's faster at a wizard club?"
Potter stepped forward, to tug the letter from his hand and read it over.  He smiled down at it and said, "Hoi Polloi has the best burgers in London."
Well, that was his last refuge demolished. Once Granger had it in her mind for Draco to do something there wasn’t much argument to be made. As her word was the main reason the Ministry had let him start work here, Draco knew better than to cross her.
“Potter,” Malfoy replied, absently pushing his hair back from catching on his eyelashes.
"Malfoy."
"Do the boys spend a lot of time together?"
"And Remus," Teddy added.
All three of them eyed him wearily. "What proposal?" Seamus asked.
Pansy smirked and said, “How’s Rita Skeeter, Granger?”
Potter's flush darkened.
Just feel that warning should exist... Since the idea is so sexy 😘
By Friday morning, Harry thought he may have well and truly lost his mind. The last two nights he’d listened to the Wallbanger-
Draco hears his own voice come through the door.
Draco could feel Potter's magic whipping around like a lion caught in a trap. "Why did you agree?" Potter asks, and Draco feels that wild anger directed at him.
tomorrow, Minister."
"I do," Harry said, a bit petulantly, "I've had one offs."
Harry stared at her for a moment, trying to understand. Then he huffed a laugh, "Do you mean nargles?"
"Welcome to the most noble and ancient house of Black," Potter said, pushing open the door.
“Are there restrictions?” Draco asked cautiously.
Huffing, Hermione folded her arms. "This is ridiculous. Where did you even learn about muggle comic books?"
“No,” Draco said, still looking at his Father, “I’m the only one he will need approval from.” He flashed a smile that held no warmth, "Remember? There was a trial and a ruling, and the ruling was that I would be in charge."
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
“Don’t worry, I’ll let you know when I want to cash in the favor,” Pansy said. She pulled on Draco’s sleeve, leading him away.
"You think you’ve earned it?" Draco asked, biting into the pulse point of Harry’s neck. His hands slid down to Harry’s hip. One slipped lower, elegant fingers brushing lightly against Harry’s skin, touching everything except his cock.
Draco chuckled, "Why do you keep telling me things Pansy recommended?"
Startled, Harry said, "No I'm not. What are you on about?"
Harry thought, watching Neville's fair cheeks bloom pink. Neville had no reason to be worried about Zabini, Harry thought he was mostly harmless.
“You look good too,” Draco said, leaning over Harry’s shoulder to look at the mirror, his breath puffing against Harry’s neck. “You should add more sex appeal,” Draco said, slipping his hands around Harry to tug his tie into a messier knot and undo his top two buttons.
“Luna Lovegood?” she countered.
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
The lustful look Pansy gave Hermione made Harry's cheeks heat, and he wondered if he was that obvious when he looked at Malfoy. She turned back to him and said, "All right, Chosen One, stop by my studio after this and my assistant will have three outfits ready. How are you planning to do approach him and where have you thought of taking him for dinner?"
been studying. That was interrupted when Malfoy had returned from the showers with still wet hair in a bathrobe. Apparently, this was something Harry was just going to have to get comfortable with seeing while being in the same dorm as Malfoy. The git took two showers a day.
Harry dropped to his knees instantly, and wrapped his lips around Draco’s cock. Draco shamelessly gave himself up to Harry’s mouth, tugging at his hair and convulsing when he started to spill cum down Harry’s throat.
Harry felt his lungs constrict and tried to breathe. He backed up to press against the freshly closed door.
Slughorn handed them each a vial. “Here we are then. Go ahead and drink that up. You might have a few lingering effects for the next 24 hours, but I doubt you’ll even notice.”
"Of course, you will need to continue to find a way to be consistently on time," Loire said with a smirk.
Mwahahaha!
“Hello Savior.” A coy smile touched her full mouth, then it was gone, leaving him to wonder if his pounding head and lack of sleep was causing him to see things.
Let me know if you like it <3
Of all the people to call during Malfoy's surprise visit, why her?
"I know," she said, cutting him off. All of them had given her a separate lecture about the dangers of being in the manor. She wasn't allowed to wander, talk to portraits, or look through any wardrobes. "I'm not going to do anything like that. I promise. I just want to use the loo, and maybe say hello to Hermione Granger," she finished with a sly smile.
She moved to enter the room but stopped when he stayed in the doorway. "You have to tell me," he said, "what you're doing in there first."
Charlie shrugs, putting the fire whiskey on the bar. "Are you sober then?"
Ginny smirked, and said, "Only if we're snogging."
However, it was clear that she wasn’t going to get very many answers until she was looking at references from the actual magic users, be it a book or a person. So, in the end, she decided to distract herself with friends and video games. Natalie, a friend she had since she was seven, was the only one she talked to about where she was headed for the weekend. Natalie's family had move to Italy last year, but the girls kept in contact through Skype and made time to game nearly every weekend.
When she came out of the wardrobe she told Scorpius that she was looking for Narnia and briefly described how Lucy had gotten in for her first visit. She half expected him to laugh and treat her like a child but he didn't, he just said, "When you meet Hermione you should ask her about that," and went downstairs.
"Not gay," Zabini said carefully, "I think you're bisexual."
Stepping into McGonagall’s office, Harry was happy to see it was empty, his body was still full of adrenaline from not losing his shit on Lucius.  He cast a tempus charm, 7:30pm. Great, 30 minutes to get ready. When he stepped off the staircase into the hallway he found Draco waiting for him. For a moment neither one of them spoke or moved, just stood, looking the other one over. Harry pulled the galleon from his pocket and sent Hermione a message -
Blaise glanced at Draco and raised a questioning eyebrow. He received a single nod in return. "Yes," Blaise said.
, after all."
“I- er…” Harry broke eye contact and looked at his now cold food.
He looked at the Headmistress with pleading eyes.
In the broom shed, Harry released the protective charms from his newly acquired LightningBolt broom. He’d received it as a gift from Randolph Spudmore the weekend before eighth year. Randolph had sent it with a letter, detailing the broom’s similarities to the Firebolt, and telling him to please stop by for tea someday. Broom in hand, he stepped out of the shed only to find himself staring into the silver eyes of Draco Malfoy.
"Thanks." Neville took a healthy swig from the flask and handed it back to Harry. "Fuck, Harry. That's really good whiskey."
"I payed for the ice cream," Harry said.
Yes. That would work. He could pretend they were both look-alikes and it would be fine.
The woman leaned across the counter, offering her hand. "I'm Ms. Granger, nice to meet you."
She gave him a nod and offered a tight smile in return.
"No," Draco said, interrupting him. Then, addressing Potter, he added, "I thought you said he was going to cooperate."
He thought.
“I can’t imagine you’ll handle it any better than I do,” Draco said, pulling on his shirt.
“Ron and I broke up, two nights ago.” She does her best to sound unaffected by that information but her emotions are still raw from the night.
Harry talked to Hermione and Ron about the offer all through dinner. He found himself getting hesitantly excited about the idea. That night Harry laid in bed with his head on Draco's chest while Draco and Pansy read the letters out loud to each other. When Harry fell asleep it was to the pleasant sound of Draco's voice in his ear.
Draco’s eyes are bright and clear, that lovely storm grey. “Harry,” he voice gentle, quiet. Then, Draco starts to
Flabbergasted, Harry asked, “What?!”
"I thought you only wore those for special occasions."
On Tuesday Harry showed up 20 minutes late again, to avoid any other students, and had brought a wireless. The music helped pass the time and every once in a while he could hear Pansy humming along to a song.
"Potter?" Draco ran a gentle hand over Harry's cheek.
Astrid looked down at the table, "Oh," she said.
Harry was surprised to find it only took a bit of focus from him for the wall to come solidly back into place. He spun on his heel to the loo, eager to take the fastest shower of his life.
“It’s all right. How did you find out about Malfoy?”
There was a heavy silence in the room as Harry seemed to digest this information. He took another sip of his tea and then set the mug back down on the table. “Ok,” he said as though it were the final word. “What questions do you have for me about Hogwarts?” he asked.
Both girls grimaced. They were each part of the Sacred 28, and Blaise knew neither of them were looking forward to talks of marriage.
Blaise huffed, and stood up. "This is ridiculous." He glanced around the common room but there were no other tables available.
Romilda read the card to herself first, then smirked at Harry as she read it outloud, “Never have I ever fantasized about someone in this room."
A smirk played on Blaise’s lips, “I know that he what?”
"I don't believe that last one," he said, and offered something almost like a smile. Almost.

Say hi on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit
-Corner him.
His Puddlemore shirt slid under Draco’s fingers, body taut and firm. “Mmhmm. Ice cream date.”
“You compiled all of that in the last hour?”
Harry ducked his head, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. “No,” he replied petulantly, “of course not. I’ve never been gone for Malfoy.”
Harry froze like a startled doe caught in a
"All right, get down. I'm going to cast."
Harry turned to look at her and noticed the way Pansy's eyes were trained on the dress Ginny was wearing. She seemed to be conflicted between admiring the redheads trim waist or lingering on her bare calves.
"I told them I want to finish school," Harry said, fidgeting with the hem of his Eve 6 t-shirt. He felt guilty for not wanting to be an auror, for not joining with Ron and spending his life fighting the bad guys. But he couldn't spend his entire life fighting and still find any joy. He had woken up screaming enough to know he didn't need more experience to fuel his nightmares. Voldemort was gone, Harry could finally live for himself.
Both Slytherins turned to stare at the space where the wall had been, eyes wide and jaws dropped.
Pansy actually laughed at that, and Harry could see Draco trying to bite back a smile. “You’re
After that, Pansy spends nearly an hour on the phone with her assistant regarding Harry's clothes. Then she gives him a lecture on the benefits of being a walking billboard for her company, and forbids Harry from getting any come on her clothes. The idea that Pansy thinks his chances are high enough to issue that warning makes his stomach erupt into butterflies. She slips a piece of paper into his hands with the address for her warehouse on one side, and Draco's mobile number on the other.
Suddenly the crying intensified, each scream sounding truly agonising. A sharp feminine trill invaded Harry’s ears causing him to squint at each beat.
The dimly light round table flickered in the candlelight as Harry watched the front door swing back and forth with patrons coming and going. It was Friday night, which meant it was a theme night, and this week it was jazz. Harry wasn’t even slightly interested in jazz music, nothing about the atonal noise really made sense to him, but the Leaky was the closest watering hole to work.
“You are more than free to check my anatomy Potter,” he slowly responded, trying his hardest to ignore the sudden flutter in his stomach.
The Headmistress inhaled deeply, taking in the disheveled appearance of the boy sat in front of her. She sighed, “The situation is… Unorthodox.”
He didn’t understand. All his body felt was muted pain and an overwhelming amount of warmth. After the past week, he should be dead. He’d done the reading; he knew the facts. He was an abysmal and unwanted veela, he was supposed to be dead.
“Mate, we did tell you.”
“If I’m honest, I don’t know,” she carefully adjusted her skirt making sure not to brush Draco’s bare torso. “He arrived in the morning two days ago, I thought it best to ask if he would stay with you and surprisingly, he did.”
She sucked her lips together staring deep into those familiar emerald eyes, “you went with him.”
She was half-dressed in her training uniform. Her baggy top falling just under her bum, as he noted her crumpled leggings thrown off in the corner of the room. She had a light sheen on her skin and a relaxed disposition.
bet. However, to keep things simple, Malfoy needs you. He will die without you.”
“So, what does that mean?”
Her mouth fell open. A number of pale faces looking up from their own conversations and scowled at the Death Eater.
The two Slytherin’s strolled down the corridor of the castle down towards the Ravenclaw common room. Draco slightly waddling behind Pansy, his hand deep in his pockets trying to push the charmed trousers down a bit.
He nodded, forcing a twitch of a smile, “I appreciate you trying to look out for me, but you shouldn’t get yourself like this for me.”
“Amazing,” she erupted in a fit of giggles and jumped off her bed, stalking up to Draco. Once in front of the decaying boy, she suddenly stopped, all emotion dropping off her face.
“You smell better than her though.”
“You look amazing Draco,” she clearly wanted to reach out but restrained herself. “If he is in there, well he’ll be crazy not to fancy you.”
Draco swallowed the pool of salvia gathering on his dry tongue. If he was going to do this, he had to do it now.
“-I’m sorry Potter,” her spindly fingers motioning him to stop. “What has a drunken kiss between students got to do with Mr Malfoy and yourself?”
Harry spent the proceeding nights under his scratchy bedsheets with a lumos enlightening his makeshift-den and the map perched on his knees. So when it turned 3:27am on Tuesday morning and the stubborn git suddenly disappeared in front of his eyes Harry knew something was happening. No student could apparate within the grounds of Hogwarts, unless there were other forces at play and that left Harry with a deep dread lining the walls of his stomach and the memories of the vanishing cabinet at the forefront of his mind.
“Mr Malfoy?” Flitwick stood at the end of his desk with a pointed look on his face. All of the students had stopped, each face homing in on him. Confident hands quickly recoiling to their owners.
“Shh, just slow down a bit Gin, you’re getting yourself worked up,” he planted a soft kiss on the top of her head. As he petted her shine hair her breathing began to calm. “Right, so let’s try again. What did I do?”
“Sorry I’m late, I was- Oh,” his head was down but he felt the dark gaze of those emerald eyes bore into the side of his skull. “What’s he doing here?”
“Look, I just came to tell you to keep a distance from Harry-"
“Like I said, I just found him on the floor. Covered in blood…among other things,” Harry’s cheeks reddening. “He was delirious, saying lots of weird things-“
Harry rolled his head back and drew a deep breath, he took note of the pasty yellow patches littering the ceiling. As his neck straightened he let the air in his lungs out slowly.
“Gin, what ya mean?” He tried to sound as stern as he was feeling, but it came out in a mush of words. He turned to the open novel next to him and clumsily grabbed the small vial tucked in the corner of the pages and downed it. He allowed the harsh metallic liquid down his throat and stared at the ginger girl as the potion took effect.
“Draco, I know you didn’t.”
Naturally, the giggling decreased and they were both left in silence once again.
The group fell into silence at the sound of their old Headmaster’s name. Bricks might not echo the devastation that took place but names cut deep.
“You’re acting weird Malfoy,” Harry glanced over the feeble boy’s body. He gathered his books clumsily under his arm before walking out of Draco’s eye line.
“He?” She blinked hard. Draco groaned in response, this couldn’t get worse. “You know who your mate is?”
“Dray! Be serious, they won’t just magically appear under your nose!” If only she knew.
“No,” his voice was hoarse and barely carried. His lifeless grey eyes reappearing to look at the Healer with as much certainty as he could muster, “No.”
He knew that voice almost as well as his mates. The timbre slightly off and a slight sharpness present, he still didn’t move.
It took Draco a minute to process, “so how do I stop it?”
“I’m just trying to help you!” She squared up to him, ignoring the prying eyes, “I thought after everything you would stop being such an arsehole!”
“Well Potter,” he grimaced, “we don’t always get what we want.”
“Malfoy,” his deep voice whispered only centimetres from Draco’s ear. “You look delicious.”
“You did something to me.” Draco squeezed his eyes shut to avoid the stare, “you’ve been taunting me for weeks! Staring over at the Gryffindor table constantly, hell you even go to our Quidditch practises!”
It was everything, yet nothing like Draco had thought. To see care in Potter’s eyes directed at him. People spoke frequently of him having his Mother’s eyes but there was no doubt they were very much his own. They were like dried parsley, crisp with a hint of darkness around the edges. The kind of green grass turned in the winter mornings when the dew consumes each and every blade. A true indicator of the change of the seasons, a sign that there is always better to come. They held a brightness that until then was only reserved for the moon as it had its nightly dance across the shimmering waters. At that moment Draco knew his pain was completely worth it. This moment was all his.

Teddy grinned like a kid on Christmas morning. "Learning," he said.
"What do you mean?"
“Malfoy’s are skilled at information retention,” Draco drawled. He looked at Astrid then, “I bet those answers only gave rise to more questions, didn’t they?” The girl blushed, looking chastised. “It doesn’t bother us Astrid,” Draco said softly, “curiosity is a sign of intelligence.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry no longer cared about the moment. He couldn't let this go. He put his hand on the other boys chest to stop him from moving past, "No. I have to know why she's ok with you."
You're going to hate me. I'm sorry.... sort of.
Then, without conscious permission, his eyes slid from Lucius to Draco. His head was still bent down and his hair was long enough now for the fringe of it to cast a shadow over his face. At that moment Harry could only remember one phrase being spoken that night at the Manor. He took a deep breath and said, “I can’t be sure.”
"I know this was a bit unconventional," Harry said, "thank you for seeing us and taking care of- of the problem."
"It puts my livelihood hood at risk if I do this," Blaise said.
Potter handed the note back, his fingers brushing against Draco's as he pulled his hand away. Draco shoved the parchment into the pocket of his robes. "Can we go in?"
Draco slips a finger under her chin and tilts her face up to his for a chaste kiss. "If I'm honest, that's not the only reason, a woman like you deserves to see beauty in places other than the mirror."
He promised himself he would bang back if he heard even a whisper of sound. Or groan. Or spank.
Potter turned back to Draco and said, "I'm going to catch a quick shower and I'll be right out."
But it wasn't like that. He didn't think of Malfoy in a sexual way. He'd been
Harry tilted his head to the side and Draco started to bite his neck. "I want you to do it because you want me. I want you to want me with as much hunger as I want you. I want you to know it's not just a fuck."
Draco's shirt was put into a dressing room on the right side, and the sales clerk hung Harry's items in the room opposite, on the left.
"Holy shit," Hermione whispered. Everyone turned to look at her.
Harry blinks at him, tilting his head. "Er-" his heart stills, skipping a beat before it picks up again at double the pace.
They both stop and stare at each other. Pansy opens her mouth to talk but Draco holds up a hand and she waits. “What do you mean, you’re sorry?”
Next chapter will include ideas on how Harry can get Draco's attention.
Harry’s already confused brain took another spin, “Blaise?”
The last thing she sees before he disapparates is a familiar smirk on his surprisingly kissable lips.
Kreacher sighed heavily and said, "Harry Potter is not knowing anything about being a wizard."
Pansy gave him a measured look and said, "Just like you've been using me, in the same way, all month to keep yourself hidden from the other students."
Along with the invitation Narcissa had sent an advertisement for a potions assistant in Diagon Alley. On its own this wouldn't have been enough to persuade him to return to England, it was the note on the back of the invitation that had secured his presence.
Draco laughed, and Harry smiled weakly through the confusion.
"Fuck off," Draco says, pulling back. "You don't get to touch my hair until you've earned it." Before him, Draco can see the wet spot form on Potter's light grey boxers, precum leaking out from Potter's cock at the statement. "Oh, you like that?"
Draco looked back at him confused, "Just Luna what?" he asked.
At the same time Draco said, "Fourth year?"
?" he asked.
Halfway to their destination, a small girl approached. She didnt say anything, only skipped over and handed Harry a chocolate then skipped away. Having seen that he allowed this, the crowd grew bold. They circled around the trio and started to call out to Harry, shouting requests, declaring love, and even offering a couple of addresses. His body grew tense as he felt people closing in, he could see them starting to push each other out of the way, trying to get close enough to touch him.
Harry looked down and watched as Draco expertly moved his hand, twisting his wrist every so often, until he gave himself over to his climax shamelessly. His body shuddered, held up by his boyfriend's arm, which pulled him forward into a kiss that swallowed his breathless moans.
I mention 3 different ships in this chapter, as everyone gets ready for the costume party. Links to art at the bottom if you're interested!
Harry swallowed and said nothing, then broke eye contact and gave Hermione a pleading look.
"Sit down Potter. I can't stand you acting like a caged animal," Loire said calmly, eyeing Harry's stumble.
"It did," he assured her, "my bracelet is set to private, so only I can see the messages coming in or going out. Yours is too. Harry had his on public so you could see how it worked."
When Harry arrived at the ministry he was greeted with the incredibly unnerving sight of three Malfoys waiting for him. Narcissa and Draco had taken the floo just before him, and Lucius had come from the manor. Harry tried to offer a greeting but ash from the floo was stuck in his throat and he ended up choking and coughing until Draco produced a cup of water for him to drink.
Draco grimaced, “Merlin, no. I would hate working there.”
"Hey," he said to Pansy, grabbing her attention, "back me up here. You know he didn't stay the night."
Pansy smothered down her sudden wave of giggles, and Hermione suspected that the girl had already put some of the pieces together. The 3 of them went over to the table where Harry and Blaise are working on their joint project for Charms.
After Harry and McGonagall replayed the events of Umbridge's visit the office took on another uncomfortable silence.
It had been one month since the gala, one month since the
Ginny laughed brightly, "Wow. You two are more fun together than I would have guessed. " She looked at Pansy, "So, what do you call me?" she asked, her voice light with amusement.
Madam Malkin’s wasn't crowded this time of year, usually the worst of it was August. Because of that, Astrid and Scorpius were both able to get walk in appointments for robes. When the attendant tried to move Scorpius to a different room he felt Astrid's hand slip into his and tug him back to her.
Zabini gave him a forced smile, "Why don't you come over here?"
Ginny looked up at him with narrowed eyes, "Why do you look so smug Zabini?"
Draco thought back to his list and tried to think of the tags. Maybe he could just verify a few of them.
“Shut up, James Sirius Potter.” Teddy splashed him with the enunciation of each name and James ducked out of the way. Unable to stop himself from scooting a bit closer to Teddy.
"Merlin," Neville said, brushing his thigh against Blaise's cock. Neville looked down, then back up at Blaise. "Are you under a lust potion?"
Both men grimaced at the statement. The boys had become fast friends. Harry worried that separating them would cause a desire for revenge on their part. Considering what they were capable of when just making mischief for fun, Harry didn't want them entertaining ideas of retaliation.
The boys glanced at each other, then turned their attention back to the argument before them.
"So you're still convinced I-" he said, cutting himself off as Draco walked up clad in a bathrobe with wet hair and a basket of products.
Draco swallowed through a wave of nausea, images of Potter limp in Hagrid's arms flashing through his mind. He pushed on, "Do you know when the next full moon is?"
Several lines borrowed from songs that make me think of these perfect boys.
"Yeah?"
Draco hums in response, mouth biting lightly at Harry’s neck and then again, harder, on his collarbone. Harry keens, arching into the sharp edge of pain and pleasure.
A cinnamon roll chased with a shot of firewhiskey.
Draco made his way to the back entrance and walked up to a table where a girl dressed in Gryffindor robes was sitting. She was holding a clipboard and reminded him, uncomfortably, of a young Hermione Granger, with dark skin, wild curls, and sharp brown eyes.
Draco feels his mouth curve into a familiar smirk, "Has he ruined my chances?"
Inexplicably, Draco blushed and became very interested in one of the portraits hanging behind the Headmistress’ desk.
Draco leaned in to speak softly in Harry's ear, "She told me," he said, "that you're dangerous."
"Yes, Lisa?" Hermione's voice came through the speaker, and Harry could tell she was smiling.
😳 Smut is so hard to write! I hope you liked it :) I feel like this scene was pretty sexy 😘
When Harry came back to the common room he stopped to say thank you to Neville who was chatting with Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott and Terry Boot. Neville stepped away from the group to pull Harry aside and told him that students he had escorted with Filch were mostly quiet on the way back. Only muttering to themselves about their detentions.
She walked around the desk to take her seat, a smile on her lips. "How about we start that now," she said.
"Hey, guys," Harry said, "I need to tell you something."
As she walks from the entrance to Diagon to the new French cuisine restaurant, Suçon.
She ran up and pulled at Draco's sleeve. "Come around back and see Neville's greenhouse. George is letting him keep it here until the school year is out," Luna said. "You can ask him about the cactus thing he has back there."
They reached the door to the building and started up the stairs. "Why were you involved in that discussion?"
Both bottles were passed around throughout the night, until the last drop was gone.
Teddy pulled James close by the lapel of his jacket.
First duel scene, I hope you like it :)
"Thanks Gin," Harry said without turning around.
The moment dinner was finished Scorpius and Teddy asked if they could go out to the manor's Quidditch pitch to fly brooms. Draco granted the request on grounds they take Astrid with them. Astrid kissed and hugged everyone at the table before leaving, even Andromeda, whom she'd only met for the first time last weekend, before she left with the boys. She wasn't sure how long they planned to stay, but she found it unlikely they would still be here when she returned.
Hermione doesn't reply to her and she doesn't give Draco the chance. She spins around, grabs Draco's hand and drags him to the women's room, throwing a Ministry level locking spell at the door.
"Um, hi," he said cautiously.
Harry thought.
"No." The answer came from both women.
"Yes well," Draco replied. His hand gestured towards his body, sweeping from his chest to his thighs, as though that were a reasonable response.
“Pretty much,” Blaise replied from his spot on her bed, which was currently empty since Pansy was laying on Daphne’s bed, topless with a sheet draped over her body.
"Merlin," Draco said, before his tongue licked up Harry's shaft.
Harry rolled his eyes,
"Ok, and can you describe Draco's hair?"
to notice that he could see some lace from her bra at this angle.
lecture about pronunciation, and had Astrid say the words aloud 3 times, they took the floo to Diagon Alley. At Olivander's they went through seven wands before Astrid found one that agreed with her. It was vine wood with unicorn hair at the core, which didn't mean much to Scorpius, but he did catch a knowing glance between Harry and Draco.
“Stay quiet, I don’t have my wand to cast a muffliato,” Neville said, biting and sucking a love bite onto Blaise's pulse point.
Potter, who has his lips on Draco’s neck again, starts the chuckle, soft breath puffing hot on Draco’s skin. Potter pulls off and turns to Pansy saying, “It’s nice to know that you and I have something in common.”
Blaise let his smile grow and nodded yes. "I do think the sweater would look good on you though." He glanced discreetly at Potter to see the boy peeking up at Draco over the magazine he was pretending to read. "Since you figured it out," Blaise said, leaning forward to undo the two buttons Draco had managed, "You should do it toppless."
It was the 1st of October when Harry finally made it to DADA on time. Harry had coerced Pansy into walking with him with the argument that she would be offering him protection instead of the other way around. Pansy didn't have to do more than glare at the students who tried to approach Harry, and they would turn around or stop a few feet away. The two of them even managed to get there a few minutes early.
Her eyes snapped to his as though a spell had been broken. "Sorry," she said, then turned to Ron. "You can not go," she said firmly.
"Hello Miss Parkinson, Mr. Potter."
Draco swallowed hard, opting to take another sip of the Ogden’s Kreacher had supplied before responding. “Yes, let’s get started.”
Harry sat on a plush office chair and looked over his coffee mug, across the desk, at Blaise. It was his third cup of the day, and he was so tired that the chair felt comfortable enough to fall asleep. After a few moments of silence he realized that Blaise was waiting for him to respond.
Of course, Draco was going to confront him in the common room surrounded by people.
Dad glanced at Mr. Malfoy who looked to be fighting a smile. "I guess that clears Scorpius," Mr. Malfoy said.
Blaise, who had been attractive for as long as he could remember, trained in the arts of seduction by his mother, and raised in the Slytherin dorms, hardly knew what to do with Longbottom. The only experience Blaise had with someone who was a late bloomer was Pansy. Except Pansy knew that she was hot now, where Longbottom still seemed unaware. The only thing Blaise knew for sure was that he needed to be careful around the boy. Longbottom wasn't just a Gryffindor, he was a war hero, and Potter's best friend.
he thought.
“I don’t care what you think you’re doing here, Potter,” Pansy says. “I wont have you walking around my home looking for dark artefacts and being a general condescending gryffindor.”

He focused, keeping careful eye contact with her instead of looking at Draco. Chewing his cheek he debated the answer, unsure if his boyfriend was ready for the level of honesty he was about to offer.
When Harry comes in from the shower he's dressed in fresh joggers and a t-shirt that stretches across his shoulders. "All right 'Mione, tell me about this date."
"What do you mean, encouraged?"
he thought,
The sales clerk hung a number 1 on the hook near Draco's door, and a number 5 next to Harry's.
She walked towards him, "Yes, I've heard that about you. Though, lately, I've heard you live to serve a handful of people, rather than the entire wizarding world."
“Harry-“
“I’m sure you are aware of why I’ve asked you here as I received your owl this morning,” she spoke quietly. “We need to discuss what happened with Dean Thomas.”
Pulling one of the grey metal visiting chairs from the end of the bed, Pomfrey ushered Harry to sit at Malfoy’s side.
He frowned, tilting his head to look at the girl, “allure?”
“W-We got there and I obviously had to kiss him so I did, and then, um, he just…” Harry trailed off keeping his eyes on his girlfriend trying to read his expression. “That’s why I came back early, as soon as he, um, yeah, I literally left.”
They strolled silently through the grounds towards the Quidditch pitch, Harry wrapping his arm tightly around Ginny’s small waist.
“Why?” Draco frowned, his eyes not moving from the place where their skin met. “What did you tell him?”
“You’ve got this allure thing anyway specifically for getting the attention of your mate,” she was exasperated. “Just use it!
Her face contoured and her heavily lined eyes dropped to the floor for a moment and then looks at her legs before returning to his gaze.
“Now who knows what the Illegibilus charm does?” Flitwick paused, his head pointed up at his students. “Anyone?”
His spine cracked, he felt the soft touch of feathers grazing his back under his robes. This wasn’t right. He didn’t do anything. They were wrong. His mate was wrong. His cheeks continued burning up and a cry stuck in his throat. He was spinning again, dancing in a circle with his mate meters away.
“I don’t think you can Mr Malfoy,” her voice was strained, eyes darting from her hands to his face and back again. “You see I’ve just given you my last vial.”
“You can’t be a veela,” Potter spat, “you’re lying.”
Hermione sighed dramatically, her wiry hair struggling to remain behind her ear in the wind.
“Being in love and them loving you back unconditionally must feel nice,” his voice whispered more to himself than anyone else.
The witch let out a deep breath, letting her lungs relax. Finally.
Harry blinked, “why-“
A wash of pure hurt washed through Draco’s stomach, sinking deep in the pit of his tummy. This was not part of the plan; Potter is supposed to be happy.
“Gin, I’m gonna head off,” he crocked out to his girlfriend who was sprawled across the rug with Hermione.
Jesus, Harry was gain a temperature by the second. Why was there nothing to drink?
“Are you alright?” Potter tightened his palm on Draco.
“What?” Harry blinked.
“-Dray, Dray, Dray…”
Instinctively Ron wrapped his arm around his girlfriend, “we’re going to look for ‘Mione's parents and maybe spend Christmas day on the beach.”
“I can’t treat you anymore,” Pomfrey tucked her wand back into her belt and perched on the side of the bed. Her burgundy robes were a harsh invasion of colour on the cream sheets. “I fear I will be under investigation soon.”
“-No!” He stepped back, out of reach. He wings flaring up.
The closet could barely hold one of the boys, let alone two. The sharp angle of the shelves dug into his back as Potter shut the door. Draco’s eyes flickered shut, his senses submerged in the woody scent filling the broom closet. He had never had Potter’s body this close by choice before, Draco’s arm hairs were on end and carefully tickling against Potter’s jersey t-shirt.
“Hermione! Seriously?”
“-Minerva! Bring him in now”.
“So he isn’t going to die?”
A surge of repressed anger bubbled inside Harry. The fact he was put to slaughter for the benefit of the wizarding world but now still called a child at eighteen left a sour taste in his mouth.
“F-Fuck off Potter.” He could feel the familiar stinging of his vertebrae.
Red trail marks burnt down his face from the tears and his chest was harshly pulsing as he stared at the woman perched on the side of his bed.
“What do you mean?” Thomas whispered carefully, his back still facing Draco.
Harry placed his hands at either side of her arms, turning her towards him, “what happened?”
He felt the weight lift from the mattress leaving him alone. Once again.
“Well,” Potter breathed deeply, “I want you to say it again.”
Growing up in an oppressive bourgeoisie society he was far from encouraged to share anything with anyone. Geez, his Father decided to not to let him know about his Veela inheritance right up until the month of his birthday. So any other time Draco would have shrugged it all off and sat brooding until she left. But perhaps it was due to the ripping sensations around his spinal cord or being rejected yet again that allowed Draco to erupt.
“I suppose you could say that,” Draco looked potter directly in the eyes. “Why are you so quick to believe that I did
It was the fourth lesson of the day and, as far as days go it was fairly quiet. The suppressants were still making their way through his system and it seemed most of the student body felt acknowledging him was too much effort today.
“Lovegood said it’s allure or something…” She nodded and slipped back into her seat watching the jittery boy play with his hands. “…I didn’t even know I could do that.”
His eyes quickly regained focus, “I’m sorry, I didn’t realise you were so threatened by Malfoy these days!”
“Ginny, you need to tell me what’s going on,” he whispered softly, taking her palm between his. “You’ve done this all week.”
The droplets around her eyes fell, trailing down her cheek.
“Malfoy,” Harry plainly stated as his hands gripped onto the chair’s arms.
The Headmistress hummed, “apparently so.”
Biting down hard on his tongue, he forced his side into the oversized door, throwing all of his feeble weight into the motion to enter the wing. The door fell open with him landing on the stone tiles in a fit of panic. The rough edges of stone lying under his fingers. He knew it should feel freezing to the touch but alas he felt nothing. Unable to find the strength to stand, he allowed defeat to wash over him, the pain too much.
“What do you think?” Ron harshly whispered. “Maybe about the moods, or the outbursts, or how my sister is crying to our Mum because she thinks you’re suicidal or some shit.”
“I did,” he croaked, running a hand over his stubbled jaw. “Please, just send me away…”
All of the scaring on his torso has been lightly covered in fresh skin, his hair glossy and vibrant plus his face free from sleepless nights and crying.

“I’m not expecting anything of you Potter. Though, if you chose to let go, the boy
Draco stilled. Potter let his eyes fall over the bed-ridden boy again. Taking in all the damaged his body had endured and finally found those icy silver irises staring back at him.
“I’ll leave you to rest up and decided what you are going to tell
“Malfoy. About what?” He tone was short and demanding.
“Well it’s a good you’ve got to get changed too then,” she stated before sashaying passed him.
Harry hummed, flicking his gazeover to his friend.
“An apology… I wanted to a-apologise.”
Her sobs became harder, each one pulling her shoulders up higher than the last.
“What-,” the boy started.
The question caught her off guard, “how does what feel?”
Thomas halted. His neck allowing him to peer over his shoulder at the voice of a vulnerable Draco Malfoy.
He hadn’t noticed right away but now she was directly in front of him. She was wearing these peculiar acrylic block heel things, an incredibly short denim skirt with a bright yellow belt and a white vest that showed off the vibrant pink shade of her bra straps.
Draco began chewing his lip again, mulling over the right words to form the best answer. After several seconds of silence, he looked across the room to the other bed.
Nervously, he spun around to look at the girl face to face and smacked her in the shoulder with his wings, “ow, Draco!”
Her perfume was invading his senses, a strong overbearing smell of berries capturing him. Her manicured hand rose to brush his cheek and he felt the surging burn under his skin even before she touched him.
Out of the doorway, Lunny Lovegood stepped dramatically into Draco’s view wearing a pair of bazaar glasses and a dopey smile. Her pleated pink skirt swung around her thighs, just above a pair of mismatching knee socks. Draco nervously pushed himself back against the wall staring at the peculiar blonde.
Occasionally she placed her plump lips on the side of Potter’s face and whispered in his ear. She was laughing again, her white teeth reflecting in the crimson flickers of the fire. She looked perfect, not a sign of blemishes anywhere. She has nothing to hide. The look Potter gave her made Draco’s eyes water in pain. He looked happy.
“I’m sure you grew up getting everything you could ever desire,” McGonagall sighed. “…However, consent isn’t one of those things.”
A humourless laugh made Draco’s blood race. Potter was shaking his head.
He sighed, carefully placing his cutlery down on the plate. “Yeah, I’ve got it.”
She inhaled deeply and pulled back to look directly at Harry. Her eyes filled with harsh contrasting red lines.
A slight smile twitched in the corner of his mouth his eyes still circling, “being in love.”
“Ah Mr Malfoy, I see you’ve decided to grace us with your presence!” McGonagall stepped forward, her harsh accent intruding his eardrums. “Now please give me one good reason why I shouldn’t contact the Ministry this second?”
“I just don’t understand why she does this mate,” it was clear Weasley’s voice was getting closer to his back as he followed his girlfriend begrudgingly. “It’s bloody divination, she’s crap at it anyway.”
“What?” Draco raised his gaze from the icy cobbles to Pansy’s eye line. She was right, there as plain as day, a sixth-year boy staring at Draco. Instinctively, he pulled up at the itchy scarf covering his mouth and looked back to the stonework.
“Nobody believed me and they won’t. I taunted him, I made him-“
“Gin, you didn’t need to do that,” Harry softly chipped in.
A wave of heartbreak washed over Draco as Potter scrambled his limbs back into his own robes. The affected areas of skin frozen by the lack of warmth.
“-Harry!” She elbowed him right in the side before glaring, “are you even listening to me?”
you to investigate literature on
veela mates-“
“…Tell Luna I’ll catch her another time.”
She dropped her gaze to the worn desk in front of her, “Potter, that’s not how veela work.”
“You’re going to have to explain yourself Potter, as I am not with you.”
“Nah, you’re right. I’m being stupid, course I want that.” He pushed his chair back to stand, “It’s my round yeah?”
“About the love potion someone slipped him at the party?” Ron dropped his arm from Harry’s shoulders and continued walking. “Rumour has it one of the Ravenclaws slipped him it, that’s why nobody has called you out about you roughing him up a bit, self-defence and all that. But people are wondering what he actually did in there to make you do that? I’d have loved to see you wipe that smug look off his face, specially after Dean. That’s karma for you.”
McGonagall wetted her thin lips, “do you know anything about Veela?”
“Harry you need to stop obsessing over all of this, it’s unhealthy!”
Thomas shoved Draco right into the wall, his sprouting feather snapping against the corse contact with the stone. He wailed out in agony and sank, greeting the cool floor with relief, his dirty blonde hair stuck to his forehead.
“-Like what?”
The boy shrugged.
Since Malfoy revealed the truth to Harry, he’d somewhat expected the Slytherin to just get up and go back to class as normal. To use whatever the hell he needed from Harry and then just let Harry leave. However, what actually happened was Malfoy then passing out, something which Pomfrey then told him was very frequent and not to expect much more conversation. So he just sat there for days, gripping onto a sharp talon and letting his mind runaway with theories on what was going to happen next.
“Who wouldn’t want you Dray?” Her eyes were bouncing around the room to avoid looking in his vacant eyes. There was a strong atmosphere in the dormitory that felt like giving up.
“How did-“
plate.
His mind was clouded, everything was full of Potter. He was so close, if he outstretched a finger it would brush with the tanned flesh.
“Harry!”
“Please do not see me as an ignorant fool Poppy, how long have I know you for now? Thirty years? I do not want to have to investigate your position but for the safety of my students I will.”
“Finnegan,” snapped McGonagall, not taking her eyes off Draco’s. “This is a very serious matter Malfoy.”
“-Malfoy?”
The boys froze, both surprised by the words that had come out of Draco’s purple lips. After a few seconds Potter shook his head for the second time and headed for the door.
She curtly nodded, pulling herself off the rug and brushing down her velvet dress before storming passed Harry towards the stairs to the dormitories.
Eventually, everyone calmed down, their rage dissipating into their drinks. The game continued, secrets slowly unfolding.
Over the next couple of days, Draco resided in the girl’s dormitories, only leaving for classes. He had even taken up eating in the Kitchens with the house elves after meal times. Fortunately, his wings hadn’t made another appearance yet, he wasn’t sure he would be able to afford them bursting out through another pair of his robes.
“Who?” He let his eyes dart around the room, “and what did I do?”
If he were honest, he hated the whole bloody house.
“I have already said, I am allowing him to rest and nothing more.”
Her lips pursed again, she looked up to the stonework celling taking in his words. A long sigh emitted from her nose, a tell-tale sign for Harry that she knew she was in the wrong, “okay. Tell me what happened then and we can move on.”
“Er, you don’t need to-uh-kiss me,” he uttered.
Using his spare hand Harry rubbed the lingering sleep out of the corner of his eye.
“Yes, of course, you do Gin… I love you but it’s just not that simple.”
Pansy gravely laughed, “so do it?”
He couldn’t lose his composure, but that comment injected itself into Draco’s blood and pierced a fresh set of wounds on his back. Potter watched as Draco dug his bony fingers into the stained sheets.
*****
He slapped a hand over his face and rubbed his swollen eyes. “Pansy. I’m sorry.”
“He could be your mate Dray!” She nudged into his side hard, ignoring Draco’s weeps of pain. “You should go over!”
Harry’s eyes dropped and a let out a irritate groan, “he came.”
Thomas suddenly appeared enthralled by the stonework on the floor. Was the Headmistress saying what Draco thought she was saying?
She hiccuped, “just weird stuff about being in love and making someone happy. I was scared and I thought maybe you did that. I was going to get someone, I was but then I thought it might get you into trouble and now I can’t get it out of my mind. Nobody’s seen him since, what if he blacked out and died because I didn’t get help?”
Suddenly an ungodly shriek slipped out of Draco. It was deep inside him but had been dying to get out from the moment Draco felt his mate’s palm on his. Potter sunk to his knees in the doorway. The palms that had been touching Draco now protecting his ears. He turned to face Draco and as soon as their eyes met Draco stopped.
Both women glanced at each other, a wordless exchange.
“I have told you this Minerva, I am simply letting the boy rest.”
Potter shifted uncomfortably under the scrutinous gaze.
Potter had reached the large oak door and pulled it back, letting a brisk breeze enter the wing. He hadn’t looked back.
“Harry, mate. What the hell is going on with you?”
“So?” He exasperated, only the deep base of the music from below filling the silence.
on the opposite shelf.
“That’s all you’ve got to say to me Malfoy?” His voice was croaky, but a dark tone lingered. “I’ve been here for what? Two days? Holding you fucking talon and-“
“I knew he wouldn’t do the whole thing! Seamus, you owe me five gallons mate,” Ron exclaimed pointing towards the doorway. The whole group’s attention flickered over to Harry shuffling back over to the settee with an unreadable look upon his face.
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
“How much did you have Gin?” He lunged across to her, taking her shoulders in his hands, staring at her face trying to read something more.
Potter continued with whatever story had driven him to the bedside of Draco, but all the veela could focus on what he had just said. Potter had triggered the fresh memory of him asking the Weaselette to make Potter happy. She had seen him. She had witnessed him sat there in a broom cupboard, covered in blood and his bloody semen, begging for Potter’s bloody happiness. She would have told Potter, of course, she would have told Potter. They would have been laughing. Laughing at him.
Draco paled, more tears threatened to spill over. His heart thumping against his ribcage.
“Ginny, I need you to fully explain to me what you’re saying because I didn’t lay a hand on Malfoy.”
******
“It’s chosen you as a
“You must leave now Potter! You, of all people, cannot be here,” she barked waving him away quickly.
The Malfoy boy mumbled something under his breath and shuffled forward quickly.
“McGonagall told me today,” Potter tumbled slightly back into the shelves letting some items fall to the floor between them. “You would have gone back to prison.”
There wasn’t much dignity left in a person after a stay in Azkaban. Still, nothing could quite prepare him for Divination.
Her glazed irises caught his with a look to continue.

Let me know what you think to this chapter and feel free to call me out for being the worst at posting x
Draco’s lungs were beating double-time to accommodate the sheer anger he felt, he could feel dampness on his cheeks, but he couldn’t remember when he started to cry. Potter just stared at him. A sudden twinge hit his spine and he jolted forwards feeling a fresh stream of blood warmly trail down his spine. He clasped his eyes shut and pursed his lips, praying his body not to dishonour him in front of Potter. He sunk his teeth deep into his bottom lip, letting the metallic liquid flow into his own salvia when a bolt of warmth trailed through his body. All his rage suddenly feeling miles away and his pain numbed.
Potter blinked, “but you’re not dead.”
Pansy had been full of delight at the prospect of reviving their friendship, asides from their conflicting timetables she rarely left his side. It was starting to grate on Draco if he were honest. They were strolling through the bitter wind of the courtyard, the branches of ice bare with only a hint of overgrown moss surrounding the trunk. It would be a while until they stumbled into spring, Draco was thankful of that. The harsh chill surrounding the castle was weaving its way around, this meant the blonde boy could hide. Layers upon layers. Practically everything he owned was wrapped around his thinning body. Double knit and Aran yarn weaving his own personal cocoon. Except Draco wouldn’t make it to the Springtime. He wouldn’t become a butterfly-
The smell of sandalwood and jasmine filled the air, which wasn’t surprising. It was the scent most often trailing Malfoy. Harry didn’t mind that cologne, but he preferred the other one, the one that made Malfoy smell like a creamsicle sugar-quill from Honeydukes. Not that Harry cared what Malfoy smelled like, he just liked sugar-quills.
The barest smile played at the corners of Draco's lips. "You think Potter fancies me?"
of a camera. "So did I," she says.
“Yes, well,” Hermione said, locks of curls shifting as she glanced down at the floor, "the Slytherin's are a lot better now that the war is over. Surely you've noticed."
Zabini leaned close and tapped a finger on Harry's left temple. "Potter, I'm in here. You don't have to lie to me. I already know that you're smitten. I know all about it."
"Surely Neville knows you want to date him. We all saw you kiss. It was pretty obvious,” Daphne said. She was curled up behind Pansy, using her wand to draw a dragon across Pansy’s shoulder blades. Apparently, they had gotten the idea from a muggleborn Ravenclaw who was giving out 'temp tattoos' the day before.
Hermione spun and kissed Neville, who blushed like a first year from the friendly peck. Draco spun and the bottle landed on Pansy, which wasn't surprising. Draco was likely terrified of kissing anyone else in the room besides Blaise.
Harry thought, recognizing the voice. He stared at the wall in shock.
“It’s a compliment,” Draco answered. “Sort of. She knows you are related to Harry, Harry is a powerful wizard and the Potter name holds a lot of weight. Dursley,” he paused and glanced at Harry, “doesn’t.”
Draco's head was bent down, looking at a piece of parchment. His white-blonde hair fell forward, grazing his cheekbones. And really, Harry thought it was just unfair Draco was able to pull off that hair style in his late thirties.
This time she gave him a real, albeit small, smile.
Potter leans forward to nibble his ear, “Do you think you can do it? Seduce her? Hermione isn’t easy to coerce and she doesn’t even know that you and I are together.”
Harry thought.
Draco stands, spelling his grey trousers and black button-down free of wrinkles. “All right Potter, lead the way.”
Harry blushed, "No. Not- it's just an event. I need a date to a gala event in July. No wallbanging," he said, the words catching in his dry throat.
Pansy groaned, "Oh gross! Stop flirting," she said, throwing a quill at Harry, which he caught and set down on her desk. He leaned down to grab Draco's hand and pull him to the other bed.
Draco met his eye and spoke clearly, "I said suck my cock, Potter."
And Harry kissed him, just to shut him up, moaning when Draco melted into it.
“Draco,” Blaise said his name carefully and laid a hand on the blond’s forearm, “I need you to trust us. I was there, and I’m telling you in no uncertain terms that if you play this right, you could have him wrapped around your pinky finger.”
Harry bit back a groan, willing himself to keep in mind that he was in a restaurant with other people. The promise of Draco's text combined with the picture had him considering a quick wank in the loo. When he looked back up it was to find Dean and Seamus staring at him expectantly.
Elphias Doge stood from his chair and shouted, “That question is completely leading the witness, not to mention offensive in its wording. Tom Riddle wasn’t the lord of anything in his time, he was just a desperate fool!”
Draco stared at Potter's stupid hopeful face, all earnest and expectant. He really was unbearable. And good looking. Unbearably good looking. Realizing that it would take a stronger man than Draco to say no to those piercing green eyes, Draco replied, "Fine."
“And It’s green?”
A steady pounding came from the door. "Get out of the closet!" Even angry, Blaise's voice still dripped like honey.
Astrid felt angry on his behalf, she didn't believe anyone should be forced into a marriage. She hated the way marriage was touted as some cure all. Her parents had married too young, and spent years working hard to build a good relationship.
Once they were both gone and the door was locked Harry realized how tired he felt. He went through the motions of getting ready for the night, then tossed himself on the bed and gave in to sleep.
"Just a quick shower," Draco said, and Harry could feel the smile against his skin.
"Are you wearing that clubbing jacket again?" Hermione said accusatory, pushing Ginny's face out of the way.
"Tomorrow."
“Of course.” Hermione opened the file and skimmed through Draco’s report. “This looks like about what I expected,” she said.
Harry struck out grabbing Draco's left arm, his hand wrapped around the black robes, but they both knew it was also wrapped around the Dark Mark. Predictably, Draco froze with his eyes wide, staring at Harry's hand. Harry took advantage of the moment to spin their positions and press Draco against the door. He was careful to lean in only from the waist up, just in case his cock got hard.
Harry thought, and cast
Blaise looked over at Draco who had his head down, chest heaving as he tried to draw in enough air. Pansy was murmuring quietly to him with her head on his shoulder. Blaise fished a bottle out of his bag and handed it over. He’d brought a copious amount of potions, stolen from the apothecary of his soon to be step-father, in preparation for this school year.
“Hello,” she said.
“Hi, Draco.”
Before Harry made it across the room to Ron he was already out of the
"It's all right, I'm not going to try anything. I just," Zabini shifted on the couch to make room, "I think I can help."
"Salazar's saggy… this place could be amazing if it were properly…. Why do you live here if you hate it?"
against her onslaught of spells. Finally one of the protective shields stuck and his breathing started up again. He cast a
“Hermione, one of my best friends, created the charm when I was in school. We used it on galleons at the time,” he pulled a coin from his pocket and passed it to her, “it’s Wizard money. But, I lost mine a few times, so I made something that I could strap on. Draco wanted it to be fashionable, of course, so he made the final design.” He turned his wrist over to show how the gold tapered down until both sides met, hooking into a silver dragon clasp. She watched in fascination as the dragon wings spread lazily and then folded back in on themselves.
“Do they? I’ve heard the company you keep might hold you back from that position.” He means for the words to come out playful but he can hear the undercurrent of concern in the statement. He hopes Potter doesn’t notice.
"Yeah," he said, not quite meeting Draco's eye.
"Have you been," Draco scrunched up his nose in disgust, "
Luna's eyes brightened, "I know just the thing!" She spun about and lead him to the west wing. Once there, she threw open the door to reveal a staff room being expanded built into a dormitory. "This is going to be for you guys, the 8th years," she said.
"Oh. Er-," Harry felt his cheeks heat and cleared his throat. "I got turned around. In a closet."
Wednesday night had been really difficult, as it was the first night Harry knowingly listened to Malfoy with another man. He wanted to be angry, as that was a familiar Malfoy induced reaction, but instead he was just a turned on jealous wreck. Thursday night had been nearly unbearable. Instead of only one person getting plowed into the mattress, it was a couple. Or at least Harry assumed they were a couple from the phrases “thank you, my love” and “this is the best anniversary present you’ve ever given me” coming through the wall during the afterglow.
