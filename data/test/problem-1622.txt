"Sorry..." Harry uttered, bringing a trembling hand up to press on Draco's pulse point in the junction of his neck and shoulder. He undid the collar by three buttons and pushed it away from Draco's alabaster skin, the tie loosening considerably.
But that's exactly what happened. He had to accept it at the age of six. And now his two best friends were looking at him like he'd betrayed them.
He struck. Draco gasped sharply as he felt a pair of fangs pierce his skin. The momentum of Harry's weight toppled them off their stools onto the floor. Draco grunted as Harry's teeth jerked from the impact, but he remained latched on, drinking deeply.
Harry stormed off to Potions, his bag swinging madly at his side. He ran his tongue along the lengthy enamel of his fangs, feeling the bottom of the little channels dismissively.
He always kind of had an inkling but fuck, he didn't know if he was ready to admit to himself that he fancied... Harry felt even more ashamed now that he had pinpointed who that body belonged to. Lithe and perfectly pale, such a comparison to his own honey cocoa skin, and barely visible little blonde hairs on his chest that he saw every time he was generous enough to offer his blood.
"I can kind of see in the dark a little better than a normal human, but not much, my sight is pretty abysmal anyway."
Harry heard Ron and Hermione groan in his favor, but he was too hungry and achy to be mad about it. He slumped down beside Malfoy, rubbing his hands over his face in an attempt to block out the scent even just for a moment.
He eventually caved on the third week when his stomach constricted uneasily in Umbridge's class. He dropped a note in Malfoy's robe pocket when he feigned crashing into him in the threshold. They snarled some weak insults at each other before parting ways.
He scribbled 'We need to figure out where to go so you can feed me, I need some soon.' in his rather messy handwriting, and passed it to Draco discreetly.
Dumbledore glanced at Harry's extended fangs and turned in his chair, refusing to look Harry in the eye.
Harry's mouth unlatched with a pop. Draco shivered as the long, rather thick fangs withdrew themselves from his body. Harry leveled with him for a moment. Fuck, wasn't that a sight to behold. He had a trail of shining crimson blood trickling down his chin and leaking from the channels of his fangs. He ducked back down and began licking the wound so gently, Draco had a shock of arousal spike through his groin.
He ran his finger along one of the grooves, an angular divot diagonally running across his spine. Harry arched and made an unintelligible sound in his sleep. It sounded almost fearful, terrified even. The skin was so smooth there Draco wasn't surprised it was so sensitive.
"Yeah they look brand new, only fluff right now. It almost looks like they're going to eventually burst out like a butterfly when they're ready."
Harry rubbed his throat, sitting up to start dicing ingredients. It was automatic and calculated, until the knife slipped from his fingers onto the cutting board with a dull clatter. Draco glanced over to see him with his hand covering his mouth, glaring into the table. Draco's fingers pinched the cork of the bottle, his other hand holding the open vial of salamander blood.
He blinked furiously, it was a feeble attempt to release the constriction in his chest and push down the hot tears threatening to well in his eyes. Doubt was replacing his anger. Maybe he was an animal. A monster of his own making. His own mistake.
"Could I see your fangs?" Draco murmured, still looking a bit bored even though his cheeks were very pink.
Harry looked up, weary and exhausted. Draco saw them. White knives in his mouth sticking out sharply.
Hi, everyone! I’m lolitarose23 and I’ve adopted HotMouth from Raserwolf. I really enjoy this story and love the premise so much, so I decided I’m going to do my best to keep it going!
"But you're a vampire! You've bitten me! I'm still alive? I'm not a vampire too?!" Draco spluttered, feeling his rapid heartbeat in his throat.
Draco wriggled around to grab his wand from his robe laying above his head and mumbled a tempus charm. It was 2 am. He yawned hugely, accidentally jostling Harry. He snorted and blearily blinked, staring right at Draco, completely unfazed. Draco watched in astonishment as Harry yawned. His fangs stretched out with his mouth and his tongue curled like a cat before clicking back together as his mouth snapped shut.
If any of you would like to use the premise/ concept, please feel free to do so. If you are interested in adopting and continuing the work, please comment and let me know, otherwise, like Sensitive Touch, it will be coming down.
But that night was when Harry had a dream unlike any other he'd had before. It wasn't the strange dark hallway like he was expecting, but it was the chest of a boy. A lean lithe chest with pert pink little nipples and an enticing vee. He felt his body reacting to the image in his head. Something he was terrified to feel. Arousal. He was afraid, but that body was so nice and almost familiar. He couldn't see the boys face but he was nude and he kept moving languidly, enticingly. The boy turned and Harry practically drooled over the pretty lines and cute arse that was presented to him.
And on top of all that, Cho kept coming onto him when they so much as looked at each other. Harry didn't feel any attraction to her whatsoever and that confused him even more. Here he was with a pretty girl trying to entice him and he wasn't even fazed. What was wrong with him? He kept seeing angular pale hands in his dreams and it made him even more confused.
Harry rambled to Ron and Hermione for several more minutes, explaining what he knew about his condition.
"Dammit! Draco drink this!" Snape grumbled, searching through his many pockets to pull out a tiny, ruby red, spherical bottle.
It wasn't even like he was to be considered a creature. Like how Lupin seemed to suffer an ailment, Harry seemed to simply have a condition.
He was thrown onto his bed and pinned on his back by one pair of very large hands on his chest. A second pair tilted his head back so far, he had no choice but to open his mouth. He struggled against them, his line of sight full of bushy brown hair and flaming red waves.
His mouth flooded when he entered the classroom. He could smell creatures blood. His urges were becoming harder and harder to ignore. His body was burning up on the inside while simultaneously being cold as ice. Snape glared at him, raising a brow at his trembling.
Some looked years old by their diluted whitish hue against his dark skin, which ruled out anything to do with the tournament of the previous year. But the most confusing ones were the deeply pink and red ones that were covered in a shiny film of skin like healing open wounds. Recent. A few were visibly infected from being in such a state for so long, others were badly scabbed very darkly with old blood, especially in the strange angular notches between all the others. There was a single reddish slash across his left arm like whoever had inflicted the injuries had missed the broad plane of his back and struck his arm instead.
Draco couldn't believe he'd never noticed exactly how much Harry's fangs actually stuck out normally. It was one of those things you couldn't unsee once you knew it was there. They were obviously incredibly sharp even when retracted fully into his gums and they extended out when he gave a small yawn moments later.
Harry bit his lip in thought, unbeknownst to Malfoy watching him out the corner of his eye, and replied 'Meet me by that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy on the seventh floor at 9:00 tonight and I'll tell you if I've figured anything out?'
They followed Snape up to the headmaster's office. Snape shoved Harry in front of him and stormed toward Dumbledore, dragging the boy along.
Malfoy set down the ingredients delicately adding an aggressive flourish of his hand to snap Harry up. He glared at Harry. He looked... strange. The pupils were huge within his irises, his mouth looked too full, and the richness had left his dark skin.
The nights events after the two fall asleep and Draco wakes up to find himself in a bed with a groggy Harry.
Harry's eyes went very wide and his face fell entirely. He hurriedly scooped up his shirt before hastily putting it on and messily topping it with his vest.
The atmosphere grew tense between Harry and Malfoy over the next few weeks. Harry hadn't spoken to him since the night in the Room of Requirement, he felt too awkward and vulnerable. How could he have been so stupid as to forget just how fresh Vernon's lashes were on his skin and how minimally they had healed? He couldn't believe he'd actually fallen asleep with his biggest secret facing Draco Malfoy. Well at least he hadn't seen the worst of it.
They stopped before an ornate door, Harry pulling Draco inside as he raised his brows in an impressed expression. The room inside consisted of a cozy couch and an impressive bed that made Harry's ears burn with the blatant implication.
Draco couldn't help the fact that his eyes roved over Harry's heaving sweaty chest and rather skinny but lean stomach before flicking up to his unfocused emeralds.
Though this work is much shorter and incomplete, similarly to Sensitive Touch, I will be taking it down soon due to a lack of pride in this work. Check chapter 46 of Sensitive Touch for more details on my decision and many thanks to you all.
He licked and lightly sucked on Malfoy's neck, bringing the veins he craved to the surface. Harry repeated the feather light kisses before he struck, his thick fangs sinking deep into Draco's trapizium. Draco let out a small squeak and gripped Harry's shoulders as he felt his tongue rolling when he gulped. It was desperate yet tentative, forward yet frightful and nervous.
"The books never mention that intent goes a long way... You won't turn." Harry assured, with an amused sort of expression sneaking into his rather pleasurable looking one.
Harry refused, the whole class watching on edge as the scene unfolded. Snape strode intimidatingly over, glaring daggers down at Harry. Harrys head slipped and thunked down on the table, but he didn't get back up.
"What are those scars Potter?" Draco asked, failing to keep the haughtiness out of his voice out of habit.
That was rather personal he thought, as he tried to get the image of Harry's back that was burned to the back of his eyelids out of his mind. The soft baby feathers shaped like wingtips sticking out were endearing and he honestly felt a bit cheated. He and Harry had had a civilized conversation for the first time without sparring and while he more than understood why Harry wasn't keen to trust him with something as intimate as his scars, he still couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.
"Y'know I find that bat thing pretty funny, vampires are supposed to have wings that they can control the visibility of, not turn into bats." Harry said matter of factly.
Harry leaned over, only a few centimeters away from being in Draco's lap and licked the junction. Harry savored the taste of Draco's sweat on his tongue, pressing a kiss to the place he thought best to bite, and began lapping hungrily.
"Well... My body doesn't make it's own blood." he began, trying to piece together everything cohesively.
Draco blinked in confusion as he woke. A very unfamiliar ceiling hung above him and there was the intense warmth of another body next to his. He looked over to see Harry curled up beside him, his hair a mess and his fangs poking very slightly out of his lips as he breathed slowly.
Here's a little treat chapter for you guys before we get into the nitty gritty of this story! Hope you enjoy!
This was a spur-of-the-moment decision, so it might be a bit before I post a new chapter. I need some time to figure out where I want to take this story. I’m hoping to stay close to Raserwolf’s original concept.
He groaned loudly and smashed his face into his pillow, his canines piercing his pillowcase as he bit down. His erection was pressing painfully into his lower belly and he had a sudden wave of hormonal urge come over him. It couldn't hurt... Right? It had been pain beyond pain when his uncle had prized him open with his foul girth, but he vividly remembered how terrified he'd been when a little spot inside him felt so good through the terrible ripping pain.
Harry did, blood pouring profusely from his mouth. Draco tentatively stuck his finger between Harry's teeth to pull back his lip. He'd bitten his tongue with his exposed fangs, his saliva slowly mending it. He retracted his finger and rubbed it off on his robes.
Now he sat cross legged on the bed in the room waiting for Malfoy, twiddling his thumbs and sucking on his fangs. Harry perked just as the door opened, the discomfort boiling in his stomach cooling a little when he saw a white blonde head come through.
He sat on the edge, looking expectantly up at Harry. Harry sat beside him, scooting further onto the mattress. Draco followed.
Harry felt a sinking sense of cold dread shoot through his body as his fangs unsheathed in their entirety. He wriggled furiously, snapping his mouth shut to hide his teeth, but the damage had already been done.
The one thing the books got right was that he could smell blood extremely well. If he was right up next to somebody's jugular, his mouth would water copiously.
"I killed eleven birds and a opossum... I cried for days after... I felt so bad... I never want to lose control ever again... I promise I won't hurt you."
She didn't realize because Harry was not the book definition vampire. He wasn't pasty white, he certainly didn't have heightened vision, and his fangs didn't stick out for all the world to see. On the contrary, he was a bespectacled Desi teen with an abnormally slow heart rate. That was all. He wasn't dead. Last time he checked, his heart was beating perfectly fine.
His stomach dropped. He knew exactly what she was inferring with the damned Prophet article. Those bastards behind the paper had confronted Ginny mere moments after their break-up was announced. Harry couldn’t blame her for telling them why they had split, she was still hurt, and he understood the reason. But it wasn’t his fault he was gay, and he hoped that one day she would understand him.
Harry gave an exasperated huff. He supposed he had no choice but to admit it all now. Pulling back, but keeping his eyes firmly planted to the black buttons in front of him, he repeated his answer.
“And do you want me to do that?” Draco whispered, thumbs pressing into Harry’s pelvis. “Do you want me to fuck you?”
They began normal enough, Draco flitting through his dreams sporadically. A flash of grey eyes would appear, or he would materialise full-bodied; like that one dream, where he and Draco flew around the Quidditch Pitch at Hogwarts.
Harry felt his pulse jump in his throat as the hand moved up to cup his face, Draco’s thumb tracing the line of his bottom lip.
“What are you doing out here all by yourself?” Draco asked as he matched Harry’s stance on the railing.
As the elf disappeared, Harry’s mouth had gone dry, his stomach curling into knots at the idea of meeting both Malfoy men again after so long. Their ire and arrogance still made Harry’s blood run cold. Narcissa, even though Harry was always nervous around her, proved to be a reasonable person. Lucius, however, was not. And he had raised his son to be the exact same way.
Turning them, Harry pushed Draco against the table, pulling out his wand and slicing down the expensive silk shirt to pop open his buttons. Draco chuckled against his mouth but made no protest as Harry quickly worked open his trousers and dove his hand in to wrap around his considerable length.
Lucius Malfoy looked at him with a predatory gaze, his icy eyes unyielding in their discontent. Draco stood behind him, and though nearly the same height, looked small in comparison. Harry blinked, realising just how much Draco looked like his father. They had the same pale hair, sharp jaw, and grey eyes, but the rest of his features favoured Narcissa. The perfectly straight line of his nose and the shape of his mouth was nearly identical to his mothers.
“Draco shares in your preferences,” Narcissa smiled gently at Harry, picking her teacup back up. “We love our son, Harry, and we don’t care who he chooses to love.”
Draco locked his jaw, letting her words settle in the luxurious yet somehow cramped hotel room. Carefully, Draco re-arranged Teddy to be facing him, balancing his feet on Draco’s thighs.
“Ah, your Majesty,” a servant girl spoke from behind them, earning glares from her cohorts, “would you like us to relieve you of your capes?”
“We can’t go to sleep without having sex.” And that was just a fact. A fact that Harry was ignoring and, in doing so, severely pissing Draco off.
“So I’ll have to make nice with people who had tried to have me killed. It’s not like I wouldn’t have had to do that anyways.” Harry shrugged then grinned, gesturing at his regal robes. “Perks of being king.”
Without a moment’s hesitation, Harry drew his wand from his trouser pocket and side-longed them to Grimmauld. As they dropped into the kitchen, Draco wasted no time before claiming Harry’s mouth again. The force of it pushed him against the table, both of their hardened cocks pressing together between the barrier of fabric.
“Ron!” Hermione gasped and ran to his side, getting caught up in one of his best friend’s famous hugs.
With their hands bound the way they were, one of them would have to switch to the other side in order for them not to be reaching over their bodies. Of course Draco would have to be the one to do it.
The question was awful. Would Draco have let Harry bed him? Yes, it was his duty. Would Draco have let Harry brutalize him? Well, there was the fantasy and there was the truth. In the fantasy Draco had Pansy’s knife under the pillow, carefully waiting like Draco had the whole thing planned from the beginning, like he was in control. When Harry displayed any sadistic tendencies that would have maimed Draco for life he would casually pull the blade out, stabbing directly into Harry’s stomach and tearing until Harry stopped moving. The movement would be clinical and neat. Everything done to the precise plan in Draco’s mind. But that was only a fantasy Draco used to help him, to empower him and make him believe he had a choice. In truth, what would Draco have done if Harry had been a bastard unworthy of a Malfoy? He would have frozen in fear and cried through the pain, riding everything out with the idea of seeing his mother in the morning.
Hysteria crept into Draco’s chest. “I fucking know, Potter!,” he cried, then forcefully lowered his voice. “I mean, it’s an important ritual.”
“Well, I mean,” Harry blushed, and how a man as strong as him could look demure was beyond Draco, “I wouldn’t be averse. If you insisted.”
Draco swallowed thickly, then reached up and took off his crown, getting his first good look at the thing he’d worn for the last few hours. It was as described to him. It had most likely belonged to the late Potter Queen. Had she been where Draco was now? Uncertain and distanced from the man who would soon bed her? Had James Potter been more of a romantic than Harry was? Or had he done the exact same, utilitarian swiftness to get their clothes off as quickly as possible.
"Draco Malfoy?" He asked Marge. Again, absurdly, she nodded. "The Draco Malfoy who was a death eater? Who lived with Voldemort for months?” Harry said wryly, “That Malfoy?”
Draco scoffed but it came out more as a cry. “I am,” he started, “I mean-” Draco laid back down, stretching himself out on the duvet “-I want to.”
He was acquitted on all charges, released from the chains binding him in front of an audience of judgment and shuffled out of the courtroom to a private hallway.
“Ha!” Kennedy barked. He was a bit too loud and reclined in his seat with his hands behind his head. “I’m sure of that, Harry.”
Feeling an embarassed pinch in his chest Draco hunched his shoulders, but when he looked up at his mother she had returned to her prophet, unconcerned at Draco’s actions.
Teddy’s eyes flicked between the two adults staring at him suspiciously, an eerily familiar nose wrinkling as his face started scrunching up.
The servant girl approached first, holding a massive broadsword in its sheath. Already Harry could tell that it was lovingly crafted and carried small jewels around the hilt, if a bit plain in design.
Along with all those papers were two sets of birth certificates (one magical, one muggle) and a letter from Malfoy himself.
Teddy twitched from where he’d been fiddling with the entertainment system and slowly turned around, eyes lowered and feet scuffing the ground.
Of course Draco hadn't learned that until a few weeks into his detainment, shucked away into a cell in between some of the most horrific death eaters Draco had had the unfortunate opportunity to grow to know. The guards were on loan from the Romanian ministry, and had little pity for those they were guarding. Even so, a month into his detainment a guard addressed him, gruffly telling him his father's fate and then awkwardly shuffling away when Draco began to sob.
“In the presence of witnesses, I bind myself to thee, Harry James Potter, and I accept your name and your house onto my life. I swear to honour you as my first and only husband, to serve you as a husband should, and to protect you with all the courage I carry in my lungs. To these things, I swear.”
“In the witness of my allies and my people, I bind myself to thee, Draco Malfoy, and give you my name and my house in offering. I so swear to honour you as my first and only husband, to serve you as a husband should, and to protect you with all the might I carry within my breast. To these things, I swear.”
So. It had been six years since the war, three and half of which he'd spent locked in depression and another year and half after that fighting back. He'd done it, though
“Um…” he started, then shook his head. White sheets were used on Malfoy wedding nights in order to gather the evidence of consummation, but it had been generations since the last same-sex marriage occurred. Maybe…no one bled when it was two men?
“Well,” Harry said slowly, his voice obviously meant to be soothing but came out as more hurt, “of those two options, I hope I’m thick.”
“There there.” The woman shushed, gently brushing his cheek. Teddy looked at Draco beseeching, as if vying for a rescue.
he got professional help. Ginny had kept her distance after their relationship fell apart, but the day she finally chose to see him was the same day she'd marched right back out and found him a mind healer.
“I mean,” Harry joked, trying to interject some levity “even if we did have such a tradition how would anyone even know? We could just lie.”
So he was sheltered and waited upon; Harry already knew this, had already known this before they’d gotten married. It made sense that he wasn’t pleased about the arrangement, that he was tense and quiet beside him. Then why did Harry feel so personally about it? Harry himself had felt twisted up about the whole affair, so of course someone with less experience with…life would feel even more nervous.
In the beginning, after the war, Harry had felt both a steadying feeling of peace as well as a calm drive to help the people who'd been affected by all that had happened. Weeks went by with Harry at hospital bedsides, letting people he'd never met but who had fought know they were going to be okay. That it was over. That there was hope again. He cried when they cried, but when he left at the end of the day he was at peace, because he'd helped someone find their own.
Malfoy sighed, whispering even lower to him, then hiking him up in his arms and marching back to Harry.
An unspoken message passed between them, leaving Harry warily eyeing the dagger. Before he could comment Parkinson was on her way and Draco was sheathing the blade once more, but instead of sending it off with the rest of the gifts he slid it into his belt.
“I think it’s a celebration.” Teddy pronounced, running his (pre-cut) bites of meat through the gravy. “For Thomas.”
Harry hadn’t removed his trousers so neither did Draco. What he did do, in one quick movement Draco doubted Harry noticed, was slide Pansy’s dagger into his waistband and hope the heavy metal would stay there without his belt. He didn’t- he wasn’t going to
Harry opened his mouth and pushed out his fangs. Draco reached up and prodded Harry's left canine with his finger very gently, running his digit down the length of it.
"I mean I think you're pretty controlled if we haven't been able to notice for four years." Hermione commented, still looking highly contemplative.
They withdrew, letting Harry whip his body about like a decapitated rabbit. He shot up, feeling the points of his fangs peaking out of his lips. His breathing was hard and fast, his hands were clammy and trembling.
Their eyes met and Harry went ruddy under his dark skin. Draco felt his face grow warm. He reached his hand up to feel the spot on his shoulder, but brushed Harry's crotch instead. He didn't really know what he was expecting but it certainly wasn't for Harry to jump about a foot and yelp almost painfully, scrambling off him with fear in his eyes.
It was several minutes before Harry unhooked his fangs and licked the wound shut. Draco stayed very still as Harry stretched out beneath him and cleaned his teeth.
"Well... Not entirely I don't think. I'm still basically human but with like a bizarre form of... What's it called? Anemia? Yeah that. And I haven't got my wings yet so I dunno."
Crookshanks lept onto the table with a soft thump, curling up on Hermione's open book. Hermione was too angry to care. Harry groaned, his detentions with her were making him lose significant amounts of much needed blood and he still hadn't talked to Malfoy about how they were going to arrange everything. He licked his teeth in thought, feeling an angry twinge in his shoulder blades as he thought of Malfoy's awed expression. It was almost... attractive.
"She's worse than Snape and Quirrel combined! And Quirrel had Voldemort stuck to the back of his head!" Harry spluttered.
Harry felt his heart stutter into an anxious rhythm as Malfoy drew nearer, slipping off his tie and unbuttoning his shirt. He sat on the edge of the bed, faintly pink in the face at Harry's avid eyes roving toward his chest and exposed shoulder. Harry scooted over on his knees, feeling his restraint begin to fray as Malfoy's alabaster skin glowed in the low light of the room. Malfoy turned to face Harry, trying not to focus on just how absolutely unhealthy and almost daunting he looked in this lighting.
His body simply didn't produce its own blood. He could last about a few weeks without any intake before he stated going mad with hunger and lightheaded from the lack of new blood in his veins. The majority of his nutritional values came from the blood he drank, as he didn't absorb everything he needed from food.
Ron and Hermione knew he was a vampire, yes, and while he considered that to be one of his big secrets, they knew nothing of the other two. The second he knew they suspected was worse than he let on, but the abuse from the Dursley's was evident all over his body, and it wasn't like he was making much effort to hide it. The third was unshakable. Unspeakable. He couldn't even bring himself to process the gravity of what had happened to him, but he hated to think about it. Rather, he couldn't bring himself to recognize it. Recognize that he wasn't resilient and accept that he couldn't do everything and fight everything alone. He felt disgusting. Forever unwantable. But he never let even the faintest inkling that he might not be okay slip. He didn't want his friends to worry. He didn't want Sirius to do something stupid and reckless.
Mother hummed, saying nothing but Draco watched as she glided up behind him, resting a hand on his shoulder and meeting his eyes in the mirror. Ah, he hadn’t hid his reaction well enough. That mix of concern and scorn was something only Narcissa Malfoy could accomplish.
There was blue in other areas as well; on the clasps, small panels in the sides (almost completely covered by the tunic) and other such things, but Draco could barely stomach to look at them. The colour clashed with the red of his soon-to-be husband’s house, turning his beloved blue into an almost grey colour, sucking the life out of it and making it seem like a dead husk next to the bright crimson. It felt like a perverse foreshadowing to the marriage Draco was about to enter into; Potter turning Draco into something other, taking all that was special about him and draining it.
Harry smiled painfully at the woman, taking her hand in a shake and sitting himself opposite the tiny, cluttered desk she sat behind. It seemed like too much work for such a small desk, let alone one woman.
Harry pressed his lips together but shrugged, refusing to let Kennedy’s special kind of strangeness ruin his day. Kennedy was a more senior auror than Harry, but not by much. Not a strong contender for promotion any time soon, he was still a competent auror deserving of respect. It was just especially terrible he was afflicted with a particularly bad case of hero-worship that caused him to overstep a few social boundaries. It put Harry off a bit, but it could certainly be worse.
Harry was stripping off the tunic that rested over his robes and with a start Draco realized how much he’d lagged behind. Toeing off his shoes, Draco’s hands went to his belt where he froze at the feel of Pansy’s dagger.
Teddy did as he was told without a word of complaint, and the two of them migrated to the table where they were treated to the sight of a lovely Sunday roast.
Both his friends cracked smiled, and Harry let it ease his anxiety. Yes, he hadn’t actually met his betrothed and that was, well, his major point of nervousness. Harry liked to think he was good at reading people, and even if they’d just met for five minutes he would feel much less stress going into this thing. Unfortunately it had all just been advisor's and diplomats he’d been able to meet face-to-face, with correspondence from Lucius Malfoy being done through letters. He hadn’t shared a letter with his son.
, and even though it confused him and made him uncomfortable and even made his stomach clench if he thought about how it came to be, it was still good. He was still lucky to have discovered such a…
Fluff and angst you know the drill. Introducing a cat, a draco perspective, and a child that loves it when adults listen to him even when he hates them. God I love teddy hes just such a wacky kid.
Hermione eyed him up and down. “Kingly.” And then to his immense horror, she bundled up her skirt and sunk down into a low curtsy.
Tucking Teddy into one arm, he extended his other hand in the mimic of a handshake. Teddy stared. Reaching out, Draco took Teddy’s hand in his and gave it a decisive shake. “There. Thank you so much for forgiving me.”
Breathing twice, he knocked gently then stood back. Stood tall. Good fucking Merlin what was happening-?
Harry raised his cloak and Draco ignored the pink that rose in his cheeks as he ducked underneath it, quickly coming out the other side and cursing uncouth barbarian traditions that, if only for a moment, had Draco pressed between the stifling heat of Harry’s back and his cape. Harry had hopped over the slack of the silk and before anyone knew the wiser they had righted themselves and started their trek outside of the great hall to the open garden, soon to be followed by everyone inside.
Potter’s hand tensed in a way Draco knew was made to help him rise to his feet. Draco rose under his own power.
Harry sighed, suddenly exhausted. The image of the fear in Teddy’s eyes as he saw Harry for the first time was cycling through his brain.  “Ask Melinda from the Child’s Interest division. She seemed to know you.”
Harry regarded the sword politely, though not pulling it from its sheath. He’d hadn’t been gifted a sword yet at all today, and most knew why.
“Hi, there.” He murmured, letting his voice pitch itself higher. Teddy stared. He wasn’t fussing at least.
Harry hummed, savoring the flavour as they fell into silence again. Surprisingly, the silence didn’t last long as Malfoy continued. “I like cooking.”
Her eyes burned into his as she sipped her tea, and Harry’s heart sped. What was he supposed to think of this? Malfoy was...
“Oh no, Potter,” Draco said sternly, though Harry could hear the amusement in his voice. “You’re going to tell me
He had haunted his dreams for so long, and now that it was happening for real, Harry could barely contain his desire.
Snorting, Harry couldn’t help but retort, “I’m sure we all know by now how big your cock is Draco. You’ve obviously been proud for some reason, and it certainly isn’t your winning personality.”
Draco wasted no time in claiming his neck, roughly nipping the skin and leaving what was sure to be impressive purple marks come the morning. His hand continued its rhythm on Harry’s cock even though Harry’s pace had slowed.
“We require your assistance once more,” Narcissa continued, waving her hand over the roll of parchment. It unfurled and floated to Harry, and he took the paper gingerly, scanning the words written on them.
Harry let out a small squeak of surprise before melting into the taller man. His shoulder pressed against Draco’s chest as he moved closer, Draco’s hand gripped his tightly while the other moved to tangle in his wayward hair. When Harry let out a small sigh of pleasure, Draco responded by pulling him even harder against him.
Looking up at the Slytherin, Harry cupped his face with a smile and pulled him into a gentle kiss. “Fuck the contract.”
The words sent a shiver down his spine, and as he felt Draco’s length rub between his arse cheeks, desire began to stir in his belly once more. Merlin, he just wanted Draco to fill his arse and fuck him into the table. He said as much out loud, and Draco chuckled into his hair.
Resuming the determined kisses on Harry’s neck again, Draco nibbled the tender flesh, causing his skin to break out in goosebumps. His hips rocked forward, desperate for some type of friction, the ache of want and need for release straining his cock against his pants.
Draco had never given them away, and Narcissa had lied to Voldemort’s face; without them, Harry could very well be dead right now instead of sitting here having a very uncomfortable conversation with the Malfoy matron. They had all been sentenced to a year with no wands and house arrest, and until now, Harry never heard from or saw them. They still held a seat on the Wizengamot, but never attended the meetings.
“Do you no longer want my help, Malfoy?” Harry replied, matching the abrasive tone. They glared daggers at each other, and Narcissa sighed impatiently.
The words must have spurred something in Draco because he began to knock into Harry with such force, such speed that his arse cheeks slapped against smooth muscled thighs, the sound loud and reverberating in the cold stone kitchen.
Harry took a sip of his champagne, allowing a moment for the bubbles to pop in his mouth before swallowing. “Just needed some air.”
“Draco, please...” Harry whimpered. He needed the oversized cock buried inside of him; he needed to be fucked, and fucked properly.
“When we read the Daily Prophet article that came out a month ago, I must admit we were surprised, but well, it gave us an idea that we hope you would be willing to help us with.”
Of course, the Daily Prophet had run a front-page article the next day. When he closed his eyes, he could still see the headline.
Harry propped himself on his hands; his elbows buckled as Draco filled him again, adjusting the stretch of his arse. His mouth was unable to form words in reply as the promised fucking truly began.
Harry gripped the front of Draco’s shirt as teeth sunk into his collar bone, hurried fingers working the buttons of his white shirt open. The feel of nails scraping his flesh caused his back to arch, and he let out another breathy moan.
Harry shook his head, blinking rapidly at Narcissa. His brain couldn’t fathom what the witch was asking of him.
Harry couldn’t help but whimper at the burn of being so thoroughly stretched, and Draco began to rub soothing circles over the swell of his bum.
With a sudden shift, Draco shoved him into the wood, the sharp edge digging into his hips as he was forcibly bent over it. Draco leant over him, whispering harshly into his ear.
Harry suddenly felt the urge to sprint from the room, his legs filling with nervous energy as the moments ticked away. Why was he even entertaining this idea?
“Come on, Potter,” Draco grinned, gripping his arse cheeks and squeezing. “Third time’s the charm. Let’s go to your bedroom.”
“Is there a line of suitors out the door?” Harry quipped, grinning at the scowl he received in response.
“What do you say to trying this out for real? Fuck the contract.” Draco’s voice came out small, as if he was afraid Harry would say no.
Harry gripped the back of Draco’s suit, trying as hard as he possibly could to keep his face hidden. “Dirty ones,” he mumbled.
“My son is suffering. Every day is a struggle for him; his friends have abandoned him; he has no prospects, no future. He sits in the library every day reading books, barely eats and hardly ever leaves the house. It’s been... very tough for all of us, but especially on him.” the witch blotted her eyes with a conjured handkerchief. “When Lucius and I read that article in the Prophet, we came up with this plan, and that is why you’re here, Harry.”
“I’ve dreamt,” Harry started, gasping as Draco’s lips trailed down his chest and latched onto a nipple, “that you sucked me dry.”
He watched as Draco’s throat bob, and his finger’s stopped their ministrations to lay fully against Harry’s hand.
And it truly had been. Harry had no respect for Lucius, but a life sentence to Azkaban for Narcissa and Draco was certainly too extreme. The Malfoy’s were desperate fools who clung helplessly to the edge of Voldemort’s robes for most of the War, only to turn and flee at the end.
The size of him made Harry’s heart pump faster in his chest, and his own freed cock twitched against Draco’s leg.
He was only allowed to look, after all. Their fake relationship was just that. Fake. They came to parties together, occasionally had public dates, but none of it was real. The worst part of it was that, at some point, Harry was hit with a sudden realisation that he had developed
Narcissa gestured to the light blue couch across from her when they entered the sitting room, and Harry was again startled at the modern and inviting decor. He took the seat reluctantly, perching just on the edge of the settee should a need arise to bolt from the room. The tinkling sound of a bell filled the space, and just as suddenly as the sound started, a different house-elf from the one that opened the door popped into view. A tea tray floated in from the door, settling on the table between him and Narcissa.
The parchment was passed back to him, and with a thick bob of his Adam’s apple, Harry signed his name too.
Harry’s voice came out in barely a whisper, the words terrifying him. He didn’t know if Draco felt the same; he didn’t know if what they had between them was truly just a farce or if, like Harry, something had changed for him at some point.
Harry wasted no time in gripping himself, jerkily trying to wank his cock in time with Draco’s fierce thrusts. Their moans mixed in the warming air, and it wasn’t long before Harry felt his balls tighten with the ache of the impending release.
Harry nodded, choosing to stay silent. The bergamot of the tea sat thick in his throat, and he was sure had he chosen to speak at that moment, his voice would come out gruff.
Narcissa’s red-painted mouth curled into a polite smile that was sure to be something she put on when she had to be diplomatic. “Name your price. Would you like to own a quidditch team? We’ll purchase one for you. Anything you want, we will make happen.”
Harry chuckled and turned to face him, circling his arms around Draco’s waist and pressing his face into his firm chest. Draco was much taller than him, and it was one of the things that drove Harry mental―in a
Draco placed a finger under his chin and tilted Harry’s head up, their gaze’s meeting. He had expected Draco to be grinning, but instead, his face looked serious, a fire in his irises that had Harry’s cock twitching in his pants.
They stayed silent as Harry slowly stood and walked to grab his pants, sliding them up his quaking legs.
He stayed there, moving lazily as his cock continued to twitch with the aftermath of his orgasm. Harry could feel his cock slowly soften until Draco pulled from him and sprawled in a nearby chair with a huff.
“Does Malfoy even know about this?” Harry asked, suddenly wary at the thought of having to deal with Draco discovering this...
Not even a minute later, the wooden door swung open silently, revealing two tall blond figures on the other side.
Draco quickly unbuttoned the fabric and yanked, freeing Harry’s cock from its confines. The soft skin of Draco’s hand firmly enveloped him, and Harry looked down just in time to watch the pink lips of Draco-
Harry grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning charm to rid themselves of the evidence―though his sore arse would remind him of this night for days to come.
Downing the contents of his glass, Harry ordered another and made his way to the large terrace, the stuffiness of the ballroom overwhelming him. As Harry Potter, he was expected to attend, required to by Kingsley, but these Ministry Gala’s bored him to tears, everyone always dressed to the nines and looking to line their pockets. He supposed this was why Narcissa asked him to pretend to date Draco, and he had undoubtedly not wasted the opportunity.
Pumping faster, Harry shuddered as his orgasm wracked through his body, and cries of pleasure left him as he came for a second time. His legs turned to jelly beneath him, and he pressed his head to the table, not even caring that his stomach became smeared in his own fluids.
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes, “Draco, if you don’t bend me over the edge of this table right now then I suppose I’m just going to have to go back to that party and find some other bloke to shag me senseless—”
Draco smirked and trailed a finger down Harry’s length, and Harry jerked a bit at the feel of being touched there. Per the contract, he hadn’t had any lovers for the year they had kept up their charade, and his hand only did so much. Suddenly, the finger was replaced by Draco’s mouth as he fit his lips over the bulge above Harry’s trousers, his tongue lapping at the cloth, dampening it as Harry shuddered beneath his ministrations.
The intoxicating flavour of the leaking precum filled every taste bud of Harry’s tongue as he swiped it over Draco’s cock. The width strained his jaw as he stretched to fit him in, but he didn’t care. The only thought flitting through his mind as he began to draw Draco deeper into his mouth was that he couldn’t wait to feel it stretch his arse wide.
Breathing shallowly, Harry tried to take Draco as far as he could, barely managing to get half-way down before he gagged on the length. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, nails scraping his scalp when he tried again.
Malfoy since he stood up for him in the Wizengamot. But now, as he stood at the imposing front door of Malfoy Manor, he couldn’t keep his mind off his childhood rival.
“That will be all, Tivy.” The witch dismissed the elf, taking her seat in the matching settee opposite Harry and pouring them both tea. Once they had each taken sips of the steaming liquid, Narcissa set her cup down and folded her hand demurely in her lap. It was an odd thing to see; it looked as if she suddenly lost all the confidence she previously had on.
“Good Godric,” Harry whimpered, his voice squeaking at the strain. He felt fuller than he ever had, legs quivering as he was pushed further into the table, the legs screeching as it shifted minutely over the flagstone floor.
Gryffindor courage filled him knowing he caused this kind of reaction, and Harry pulled back, panting for breath but determined.
Growling, Draco leant forward and captured him in a kiss again, tongue darting out to taste Harry’s. This time, they both groaned, and the kiss turned heated, Harry pulling against Draco’s back to press him closer. He could feel a hard length press into him and knew instantly that it wasn’t his wand, and that Draco certainly wasn’t exaggerating about the size.
“I think they’re adorable,” Harry said, grinning as he pulled them down. The grin didn’t last long; as it disappeared the moment Harry took in the sight of the impressive cock before him.
“Continue.” Draco’s deep voice mumbled against Harry’s chest as he peppered kisses across to the other nipple, working it the same way.
Harry watched over his shoulder as Draco continued to pump his fingers; his pale cock, twitching and swollen, bobbed behind Harry and he found he couldn’t look away. Involuntary moans escaped his lips, and his eyes flicked up to meet Draco’s. The sight of those fiery grey eyes as Draco finger-fucked him caused something to stir deep in his belly.
“Harry, I—” Whatever it was he was about to say, Harry never found out, because instead of finishing the sentence, Draco surged down to kiss him.
Large hands reached up to twine through his hair, mussing it more than it naturally was. The sudden force of Draco’s mouth on his again had Harry moaning, and they hungrily devoured one another. Their teeth clashed together as they learnt each other’s mouths, and when Draco began to pepper kisses across Harry’s cheek and down his neck, they both jolted in surprise when the terrace door opened behind them.
Beyond the head table were individual circular ones, each with a lavish centerpiece and luxuries in the hope that those who had to sit at them wouldn’t take offense that they hadn’t made the cut to sit at the head table. Hermione was at one of those tables; her parents were physicians and she herself was indispensable to him, but when there was foreign royalty you had to always show them the highest regard.
Hermione growled. “And just what do you mean by that? Are you seriously telling me you always intended to marry for political reasons? You?”
As soon as he was on his feet the cheering started, with the nobility on the ground applauding respectfully while the commoners above yelled their support in a gauche manner. Hankies started to rain down from above as commoners waved them, eventually throwing them down below in a confetti of colour. The nobles on the ground were on their feet, watching as he and Potter weathered the attention.
Teddy rummaged around in a small set of shelves filled with tapes, emerging with a purple VHS. “Have you seen this film?”
“Draco?” Harry asked, “If I had gotten…demanding. If I had made you bleed-” Draco’s eyes snapped to Harry’s, the tension in his body returning as quickly as it had left “-would you have used the knife? To defend yourself?”
Harry laughed uncomfortably, running a hand through his hair. His mail was also one of those many messes he hadn’t quite gotten to yet, creating a pile so vast it had taken over the dining room in Grimmauld Place. "I haven't been all the way of sorts after the war. I'm very sorry if you've written and I missed it."
Harry nodded, letting himself be examined with all the grace he could muster considering the circumstances.
Risking a glance back Draco tried to search out his mother, only to scowl as he saw how Harry’s cape crossed over his own, symbolic of their union as the practice had obviously intended. Harry’s red cape was on top and, stoking the fires of Draco’s inferiority, it was noticeably longer.
Harry rubbed behind his neck. “I know this will be, uh, awkward, “ he gestured with his still bound hand, “but it’s just for tonight.”
“Okay,” Harry sighed. Draco’s heart flew to his throat, but Harry continued, “okay. We’re talking about this.”
“Potter if this has something to do with the fucking Basilisk so help me god I will have your head for dinner and my mother will get more flowerbed fertiliser.” Blaise looked alarmed.
The next morning (Of which POtter had stayed on the common room couch, which every slytherin will deny readjusting his blankets and pillows or checking his temperature.) when he waltzed into the Great Hall in his bloodied grey trackies no one even blinked. Not even at the large, large bottle of whiskey he held. Which he walked over to Draco and plonked on the table.
“Well, its a bit different because I am making said shit. Besides, Minnie told me I need a hobby.” The headmaster looked affronted.
“If I walked away now, who would dob me in?” The entire common room raised there hands, fucking house unity. Fucking Potter and his curls. And fuck those grey trackies in particular which as he lay unconscious on the floor and the material fell on his body it was clear he was not wearing any underwear.
Draco refused to be dragged into Potter shenanigans. Not this year, not ever (He was pointedly ignoring how his skin warmed whenever he saw him scantily dressed looking worse for wear, there was nothing hot about an apathetic troublemaker he told himself, even if he had the physique of an athlete. No, especially then.).
Four days later of eerie peace Potter burst through the Slytherin common room at night only wearing low slung tracksuit pants. Once again every Slytherin immediately frowned, confused how he had managed to escape the dungeons with eyes that had green and persuasive skills so good he could get in without a passcode. Draco looked up at him, raked his eyes up and down, and refocused them on the book, ignoring him with everything he had.
“You. Chose necromancy as a hobby, then decided it's a genius idea to raise a dead basilisk as what I presume is your first endeavour in your new hobby, have not had a wand since the battle of Hogwarts and have unthinkable amounts of power.” Draco had been yelling at him while moving closer. “I do not want to have to console my mother at the funeral of her new favourite person for whatever inexplicable reason because you do not value your life.” The last three words of his spiel were accompanied by cold hands shoving a hot, muscular chest three times, each on beat, ending up with Harry’s back against the door and Draco standing uncomfortably close. Fuck, Draco should not been turned on right now, and HArry did not make matters better.
“Draco, is that why your mother has so many flower beds?!” He shot him a glare. Not the time. Potter grimaced, Snape looked alarmed as he got, which was not a good sign. Harrys flicked through his book quickly, searching for something while intermittently looking around in mild concern.
“Fine, I like the bun by the way.” Harry smirked and wordlessly summoned Draco's apple into his hand and took a bite. Draco flipped him off and the hall took that as a sign the conversation was over.  Several of the teachers added money to a pot.
In all the millions of scenarios Draco had refused to let himself entertain, this was never one of them.
“Blood on the sheets,” Draco replied promptly. Harry turned slightly green so he hurried along, “And I mean, the marriage isn’t valid unless it’s consummated.”
Like Draco knew he would, Teddy’s anger quickly turned to tears. Great heaving childish sobs that choked his words filled his small bedroom and made Draco’s heart clench as it always does. Teddy was one for tantrums, even though he can be very polite, and like all his emotional outbursts Draco just leaned in and held him. Not saying anything, leaving the space open for Teddy to communicate, Draco rubbed his back and let his shirt get wet under Teddy’s cheek pressed to his shoulder.
Draco heard the man shuffle around before coming up behind him. Draco tensed, and felt as Potter tensed next to him.
“Well,” Harry said slowly, casually returning to his side of the bed, “I’m pretty sure that answers that.”
The film turned out to be quite cute, if a little dated. Mostly Harry just let himself revel in the strangeness, if only because he was sick of feeling awkward. He was sharing a couch with Draco Malfoy and that was just his life now. He was watching cartoon cats play jazz music and watching his godson pop up and start kicking out his legs in mimicry. He was feeling amused at the idea that Malfoy would be compared to an extremely mothering and feminine cartoon cat and delighting in how Malfoy would squirm at the comparison. It was
Harry wondered, as he reached the raised podium and turned to face the room, if they would add this occasion to the stone. Then he remembered that he was the one who would have to make that decision.
The ministry had come to claim him into their custody about a week after the battle of Hogwarts. Well, the international wizarding agents who were currently operating in the ministry that is, considering the Dark Lord had corrupted the majority. They'd come for him and his family at the manor. His mother had been begging his father that entire week to flee, to abandon their home that had been so abused by the death eaters and to move away. Father had had none of it, frantically sending letter after letter out to his political allies who'd never overtly sided with the Dark Lord during the war, confident he could escape charges as he'd done the last war over seventeen years ago.
3. There will be no, uh, game of thrones-esque non-con or anything of the like, but there will be discussions around it so...
Harry recognized the dismissal, but the new monster is Harry’s chest reeled. “I can’t leave without-” he didn’t know how to end the sentence.
Draco steeled himself, chin high and back straight. Posture that was immediately undone with the undignified crawl across the duvet to the other side, leaving room for Harry. He didn’t watch the other man get into bed, instead lying stiff and silent, staring up at the canopy unblinking.
Draco Malfoy. Well, he wouldn’t be a Malfoy for very long now. Draco Malfoy Potter. It had been decided, through the tedious and numerous meetings Harry had suffered through, that Draco would keep his blood family’s name as a middle name, but his true house and allegiance would be Potter. He would be a Potter. The first new Potter in over two decades.
“But from where I’m sitting,” Harry suddenly said, eyeing him up and down, “I really don’t think you want to.”
Melinda, as Harry had learned, was Andromeda's longtime friend who worked in the Children's Interest division at the ministry. The majority of the division was just tracking underage magic, something Harry bitterly found out himself after certain revelations about his own childhood, but there was a branch that helped relocate children and worked with private orphanages.
Swallowing his nerves Draco quickly moved towards the bed, gliding past his husband and ignoring the heat coming off the other man’s body. He reached the bed and heard the heavy half-run Harry did to catch up to him. The bed was a four-poster monstrosity with the typical blood-red colouring in both the canopy and the duvet. Draco hesitated, then blanched.
Hermione huffed, organizing the parchment in front of her in order of importance. Despite her undying quest to keep Harry unwed she’d dressed for the occasion, a simple pink gown worn with red accents. Her hair was another matter, strewn about as she repeatedly scratched her head. Normally Harry would be in the same state, but through tenacity (or, Harry suspected, witchcraft) Madam Malkin had tamed his hair into something presentable.
The nerves he’d been doing such an excellent job at avoiding flared brightly up his spine before Harry shoved them back down again, folding imaginary creases down his robes.
Harry sighed, but his mood was still high. Not even walking into work to a thick file on his desk could ruin his mood.
An older woman with red hair was quietly sobbing, pressing a tissue to her eyes as Potter spoke. In fact, as his words rang out across the hall, Draco could spot a number of wet-eyes and swoons from the crowd.
Malfoy groaned, covering his face with his hands. Teddy whipped back around. “Daddy didn’t get it even though I explained it a million times.” He said dramatically, rolling his eyes.
Malfoy exhaled, straightening up and dusting his pale blue jumper. “So,” he said, not making eye contact, “supper will be ready soon. We’re having roast.”
Ignoring the weakness in his limbs caused by a relief Draco refused to let himself feel, Draco pushed himself up until he was sitting, finally the same height as Harry. “Look,” Draco said, still feeling the press of expectations, “we still have to.”
“It has to be on Lupin’s side.” Andromeda exhaled slowly, her breath shaking. "I gave you the information, Harry."
“Thank you all for coming to share in this joyous occasion,” Harry began, and Draco couldn’t hide his flinch. “With all the suffering and strife that we’ve fought through such an occasion is a new beginning, and I hope all of you continue to find joy in the feast and entertainment provided. Unfortunately” -he was grinning despite his words- “we have reached the part of the evening where my new husband and I must say goodbye. Thank you all again and please don’t stop the festivities on our account.” Harry raised their bound hands. Somehow Draco mustered a polite smile. “Good night!”
Draco’s neck snapped with how quickly he turned. “Excuse me?” he asked, the words finding a horrific meaning in his skull.
As they neared the great hall his two friends quietly left him to enter first and take their seats, the titters Harry heard from beyond the door dying when they entered and a respectful hush took its place. The servants fanned his cape out behind him then bowed and left, turning to the adjacent stairs where they would watch the ceremony from the balcony above with the other common folk. The nobility would be on the ground floor with his friends taking a place of honour near the front.
“Of course we have a television. Teddy’s friends, not to mention their parents, would assume I was some religious nut and depriving poor Teddy of all the luxuries the middle-class could offer.”
“Oh, dear,” Draco whispered, picking Thomas up upon insistence. “You are such a suck.” Thomas absolutely did not care, rubbing his face against Draco’s the whole trip to the bedroom.
(Which doesn’t mean Harry didn’t immediately search for any kind of documented information of Draco Malfoy post-war using his auror clearance. With the exception of unsubstantiated suspicious sightings in Diagon Alley, Malfoy had completely disappeared from the wizarding world.)
Anger flared brightly in Andromeda's eyes, the most emotion he'd seen of her yet, until it stuttered and died with a quiet sadness.
Harry inspected the film. It had a number of different cats in different states, some playing instruments. “
bringing tears to his eyes. He shouldn’t be here. Draco was bred and raised to become the monarch of his own kingdom, with his own wife to take his name. This, this
When it was time to say goodbye Harry recognized he’d finally relaxed somewhat, had normalized a bit more of the nonsensical situation he’d found himself in and parsed out a bit more of his feelings. He was prepared to do it all over again next week, and said as much.
tw for expectations of dub con. Basically yall know the messed up wedding rituals usually present in medieval stories? A lot of those things will be addressed this chapter so if you have any squicks or triggers be warned.
But nothing happened. His husband just deflated, running a hand through his hair. “Fine, I’m thick. But I’m also fucking exhausted and I don’t know you well enough not to offend you, something you’ve made obvious. So tell me what’s wrong so we can both go to sleep.”
He had a purpose. He had a life. And he had yards upon yards of messes to clean up from when he'd let all his responsibilities go.
Resentment rose fast then died just as quickly. Draco was too resigned to hold onto his anger any longer than a moment. Potter had no idea the position Draco was in, had no idea what it felt like to allow someone he’d long considered an enemy access to his child. And Teddy
Quiet fell between them, their mutual failure taking up all the air. Six years. For almost six years Lupin's son had been raised by absolute strangers while the people who were trusted to care for him wallowed in grief and pain and illness and who knew what else. Regardless of all that, regardless of what his healer would say, the responsibility towards children always came first.
Lucius’ son, well, Harry didn’t know him but he knew a lot of conflicting opinions. He’d spent almost his entire life holed up in his father’s castle, starkly contrasting Harry’s life of constant war. He was well-read and, to quote Lucius, a good son. But, uh, other opinions of those that had served in the Malfoy castle weren’t as charitable, with the best thing Harry could wring from them simply being “he is not as bad as Lucius.”
“Hurry up before the cat tries to escape.” Sure enough a chirping yowl came from the living room and the quiet padding of paws followed.
They lapsed into silence once more, though much more companionable than Harry had ever achieved with Malfoy. It was very strange.
The castle was ancient and massive; under renovations as it had suffered greatly under Voldemort’s occupation of his lands. The corridor he currently he walked down was mostly finished as the stone stood in neat patterns and tapestries hung proudly on the walls. All the corridors where guests would be staying as well as their chambers had been restored almost fully, but the signs of the recent rushed renovations could be seen if Harry looked hard enough. Scuff marks in corners, creases in the tapestries. Harry didn’t care for that sort of thing, which is why his nerves flared brightly once again. If he, who couldn’t care less about the fiddly details, could see such things then surely his guests would notice as well.
Since begging was obviously not working Harry slid a prime cut of roast bird off his plate and onto Ron’s. Ron looked at him like he’d hung the stars.
"I'm sorry? I believe I misheard." Because he had. Regardless of the ministry’s incompetence and Malfoy’s acquittal there was no way that would have gone through. His reputation alone is enough to get himself bullied out of Diagon Alley, let alone adopt a child.
“Come in quickly!” A harried Malfoy demanded, gesturing wildly, then slamming the door shut as soon as Harry shuffled in. A squeal sounded from the living room and Draco sprinted towards it, Harry on his heels completely dumbfounded.
Andromeda sighed. "He's with family, if that's any comfort. Some distant cousin took him in, at least that's what Melinda said."
Harry almost rolled his eyes at the offense in Malfoy's tone, but was quickly distracted as Malfoy started trying to physically
He’d only had two occasions to wear it so far; his coronation and the diplomatic meetings that went into creating this whole affair.
The woman sighed. “We’ll try more relatives, but if no one takes him in then we’ll just have to care for him until a spot opens up at an orphanage.”
"You know, stunning you wasn't an idle threat. You're not exactly my favourite fucking person at the moment, Malfoy."
. The thought of showing any bit of weakness, any bit of vulnerability to the person who'd broken his nose or let death eaters into Hogwarts or tried to kill Dumbledore, well, it was impossible.
Too late, he saw the light in Harry’s eyes and how it drained away at his words. For some reason Harry had learned to find the idea of Draco stabbing him endearing. A kind of light amusement and pride at the idea of Draco sticking up for himself against an evil version of him. Too late, Draco realized he should have lied, should have said he’d gut Potter like a pig if he got too handsy. Too late, he realized he’d just lost the first bit of respect he’d ever gained from his new husband.
Teddy made a sour face, curling into Malfoy’s hip and grabbing at his belt loop. “Is supper almost ready?”
Teddy pursed his lips and flicked his eyes back to Harry, pulling his heart when he saw that no, not all the fear had been removed from Teddy’s gaze. Teddy shook his head at Malfoy’s question and tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck.
Harry clawed at his neck trying to draw in breath but the rage was too much, his face was twisted and the smell of blood was so close he could taste it.
Harry shook himself. If something had happened to Narcissa then he would have found out by now. Still, it was another question that needed an answer. Eventually, though Harry is not prepared to disturb the peace just yet, he’d have to start asking these questions. Mostly he would have to ask, well, living in a muggle neighborhood and sending Teddy to a muggle nursery was telling, but it wasn’t enough. He needed Malfoy to tell him point-blank that he wasn’t teaching Teddy anything inappropriate. The whole absurdity of everything had kept Harry restrained but Teddy’s father had been a
It was Harry's turn to hum. In the two days since he'd done very much the same thing to Malfoy he'd gone into work to look up Malfoy's file and all his goings-on. There was scarcely anything there, just a few incidents of spotting the man in Diagon Alley that the prophet had found scandalous.
Harry rose to meet her and accepted the envelope, only to be startled at the wetness on Andromeda's cheeks. She'd cried throughout the entire visit without Harry hearing a sound. Harry remembered what that felt like.
A flash of red had Draco closing his eyes. A phoenix embroidered in Potter colours stretched the length of the cape, the bird beginning at Draco’s shoulders and the trail of wings flowing into flame the further down it went. It was the ancient symbol of the house of Potter, but it rang more potent with the current state of the lands than it ever had before. That a Malfoy should wear this creature spoke leagues. Draco hated it.
