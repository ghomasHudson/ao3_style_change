within the safe confines of his own head stretched into months; his supervisor was ecstatic at the renewed vigour which Draco’d been applying to his academic work, conducting a series of carefully controlled experiments which he was vaguely feeling optimistic about. He had drinks out with his friends every Friday evening like clockwork and only thought that he’d rather be a home half the time. Unfortunately, one Thursday evening in mid-September, his routine was disturbed by something that he’d been expecting, but hoping against all reason wouldn’t happen.
The song finished, and the room broke into applause before the band leapt into an upbeat song with a fast tempo.
He threw himself into his work, retreating into the potions lab at the uni, only emerging to pick up his shifts at the muggle cafe and to sleep. Pansy didn’t bring up Potter again, although he could feel her watching him. Considering.
By some minor miracle the table burdened by towering platters of canapés was blessedly free of people just as Draco’s stomach let out a low rumble, giving a witch near him with hair so dramatically styled that Draco feared what would happen were she to approach an open flame cause to turn around, recognise his distinctive Malfoy-ness and give a large sniff, her nose in the air as she turned back to face her companion.
The thing was, that he wasn’t sure why he’d run. He didn’t understand why his fear had spiralled into this all-encompassing thing, why the Potter of his nightmares had become a hate filled spectre, cutting him to the quick. Potter had emerged from that final, terrible night at Hogwarts a hero, hand in hand with Ginny Weasley. He’d testified through The Trials, chin in the air. He’d testified to acquit in some cases; at Draco’s own. Draco had found himself incapable of looking at him while he’d done it. Potter’d been fast tracked into Auror training, his name and photograph heading all the newspapers every time he had been even peripherally connected with an investigation or arrest. And then something had changed. Ginny Weasley moved to Holyhead to join the Harpies, the breakup a front page story in all the tabloids, and quite a few of the broadsheets besides. Potter quietly left the auror programme and as far as the newspapers knew had been spending his time as an unemployed layabout, with an extensive stint spending time lying on Mediterranean beaches overseas. Draco’d spent so much time avoiding the wizarding world and Potter both that he had never considered that maybe, Potter was avoiding some of the same things he was.
“She’s… Luna.” Her pale cheeks pink slightly as she absently touches the crescent moon pendant which hangs around her neck. Harry grins again. Somewhere under that now-muscular exterior lies the girl who blushed at him on the train platform. “She’s still off gallivanting with that Scamander bloke. I’d be jealous if I didn’t know better.”
“It’s not Ron.” Harry’s flat voice seems sufficient to snap Neville’s mouth shut and colour his cheeks, and immediately Harry wants to slam his head against his desk. “I’m—I only meant that Ron’s too good an Auror to quit now. He’s steady on track to become Head Auror, and I think he was talking about coming to Hogwarts to make me feel better. Plus at the Ministry, he’s closer to Hermione, and we all know how sickening they are even after all these years.”
“I’ve reviewed your curriculum and I’m very pleased, as I think Filius would be. I must say your willingness to step in at such a late hour is commendable.” Harry smiles once again; even as she attempts to thank the still-mysterious newcomer, McGonagall sounds fierce, as though she is begrudging even her gratefulness. “Tomorrow your first class will be with the first-year Hufflepuff and Slytherin students. I will have a timetable for you as quickly as I can.”
The figure is tall. Slim. Fair. An expensive-looking black suit fits snugly against the lean body which lopes gracefully beside McGonagall. Pale hair pulled back at the nape of a paler neck. A flash of a haughty smile. Just a glimpse of the right side of the newcomer’s face has Harry’s heart pounding in some strange tattoo of anger-inducing familiarity. Neville’s voice echoes with the same righteous indignation which bubbles like firewhisky in Harry’s chest.
Nearly a month into the term and Harry finds himself tossing and turning, vision stained red whenever he closes his eyes. Pain lances from the base of his spine down his leg, into the tips of his toes, and no matter which way he lies, he can’t escape it. With a sigh, he stands, pulling a sweater over his head as he limps through the door.
“Yes,” she says, her breathy voice catching on the wind as though it’s made from the breeze itself. “She told me not to tell you that, but you guessed it all on your own. That doesn’t count as telling, I suppose.”
He sputters to a stop when he turns to find Harry standing just before him. His lips are slightly parted in uncharacteristic surprise, and if Harry hadn’t been so overcome with gratitude, he might take a moment to revel in that astonishment. As it is, though, he knows that his eyes are shining with unshed tears, that they are standing far too close together, that Draco’s breath is stuttering.
“So, Hermione,” Harry says, and her gaze snaps to his as though she’s about to turn her rage onto him. “I spoke with Malfoy today.”
When they do move, it’s in tandem, jackets tucked over arms and coins flipped to a still-smiling Rosmerta, who gives them each a cheeky wink before swaying to pour more drinks across the bar.
“It’s bloody early, Hermione,” he says crossly, stifling a yawn and peering down at the familiar face staring up at him from the embers. In true Hermione fashion, she smiles brightly back at him—suspiciously brightly, in fact, even more brightly than her delivering-bad-news smile. His eyes narrow. “What’s worth waking me up over? You know the students arrive tonight. I’ll need all the sleep I can get.”
Excitement is palpable in the air, electric under the enchanted ceiling which crackles with white-purple lightning. Then the pair walks by.
The Three Broomsticks is crowded and warm, the orange glow of enchanted lights casting a haze of comfort over the pub’s patrons. Merry conversation fills the wide room with a low hum; Madam Rosmerta passes drinks to the crowd with an unwavering smile on her face and tips a wink to Harry when they make eye contact. The smell of butterbeer and firewhisky stings their noses pleasantly and laughter erupts in the corner, loud and hearty, and Harry takes a moment to breathe, to remember that he no longer needs to be aware of every exit, every face.
“Oh, Harry. Forgot to tell you.” Ron’s speech comes hastily as Hermione shoots him a look, and his face is almost as red as his hair. “We’ve made a breakthrough in the Belfort case.”
“I wish Professor Binns would never have updated his lesson plans,” he manages wryly, drawing nervous chuckles from a few students. For this moment, they look at him not as their annoying professor who makes bad jokes and assigns too much homework, but as the legend their parents told them as bedtime stories whispered by candlelight, the one who defeated the Dark Lord, the Boy Who Lived. He hates it. His mood fouls and he makes some passable attempt not to show it on his face. It isn’t their fault, after all.
There’s a pause in which Harry becomes afraid that Draco might touch him, might use those deft fingers to apply the potion. But is he afraid of that touch, or is he afraid of how he will respond to it?
regard the notes from the first chapter. also, sorry it took me so long. life, work, everything that entails. if anyone's even reading. as always, feedback is appreciated.
Four students sit before him as the sun sinks below the horizon and the stars begin to fade into view. A breeze rustles the curtains through the open windows, makes the candle flames flicker and stutter. Harry regards the seventh-years with a passive expression, mouth set in a serene line, hands clasped in his lap. Finally one of them breaks — her hand wavers as she raises it and he can see equal parts excitement and apprehension in her bright eyes.
The Charms classroom is… not what Harry had been expecting. Draco had changed it drastically, of course, but it is not the austere and foreboding place he’d always associated with the Malfoy family. Deep black wooden seats circle the room, leaving the floor open for lessons, for practice. White chalk still marks the chalkboard in Draco’s small, neat handwriting. Fairly unremarkable, even to Harry’s untrained eye, until something drags his attention upward.
“Right,” Harry nods eventually, stubborn as he gazes at the horizon, no matter how keenly aware he may be of the fact that their shoulders are almost touching. The darkness makes them different. Bolder. Or perhaps only more comfortable. They’d both lived their lives in the dark, after all. Made a show of fighting it to pretend they hadn’t grown to be part of it.
“I assume the same thing that happened with you and Pansy,” Harry says dryly, coughing as he takes another drink of the ale. “We realised that sometimes feelings don’t last after school. We’re still friends. Close friends. It’s better that way.”
A hard slap was the first thing Draco felt when Potter came back. Then he was shoved against the wall. “ What were you thinking? Are you trying to upset me that much? Didn’t I tell you to wait for me upstairs? Can’t you even follow orders properly you useless slut? That must be why your side lost the war apparently Voldemort wasn’t so good at leading. You can’t even follow simple directions stupid whore!” Draco pushed Harry off of him. Furious himself. “Sorry Potter. That I wasn’t good at pretending that I don’t exist. Whatever that kind of a bullshit order that was. Maybe my presence is just too strong to ignore it! And by the way I think you forgot a thank you in between those insults!” Harry laughed dryly and pushed Malfoy hard against the wall again. “ Really? What should I thank you for? Thank you that you got me in this stupid situation with Hermione. Thank you that she is going to get on my nerves now about you. Thank you that she now knows that you are here with me, that I have to find explanations for that. Thank you for what exactly Malfoy?” The blond haired man shook his head in frustration. “Are you really that blind Potter? I just saved your sorry ass. Would you have liked it better if she knew what really happened. Miss super clever over there would have digged up everything and you know that. Would you rather have a discussion with her whether she agreed if you have fucked me properly and hard enough or if the unforgivable curse that you threw at me was performed perfectly enough. She would probably have a strong opinion about some of you sadistic character twists. “ Harry was breathing heavily. He pointed his wand at Draco who prepared for the pain. “So why didn’t you?” Draco opened his eyes. He didn’t even remembered closing them when he prepared for the curse to hit him. “What?” Harry dropped his hand with the wand slowly and sighed. “ Why didn’t you tell her what really happened. Why did you cover for me. I don’t get it. I did these horrible things to you. I just treated you like shit for two days straight. Why didn’t you tell her that?” Draco looked at Potter for a moment. “I am not sure. Maybe because I think you are just as broken as I am. I saw you sitting at the table crying to yourself. You are going through some stuff too. Maybe it was because I somehow feel like I deserve to be punished, that it isn’t your fault but mine.” Dracos voice started to crack a little and it trembled slightly with his next words. Opening up seemed like the only option he had now if he wanted to fix things but it felt like it was impossible. “And maybe because you were my idol, my hero in school. I was always jealous of you. Your friends your popularity. The love everyone had for you. Since first grade until someday understood that I might have a slight crush on you as well maybe that’s why…” Slap. Harry pushed him hard against the wall again. “I hate you, Malfoy. I despise you. I …” Draco kissed him. Easy as that. It took him everything to do that. And Harry Potter actually kissed him back.
Hot burning pain shot through his body. Draco did not know where he was. His hip was burning. He tried to get away from the pain but he wasn’t able to move. He was bound, no he was chained to a wall. Right. His eyes had to get used to the light that was shining all too bright compared to the embracing darkness from before. Draco squirmed and screamed. He cried and struggled with all his mind. He had never felt pain like this before. This was something new that he couldn’t name yet. His eyes found Harrys. A green burning glow that looked almost soulless. And in these green orbs, these green deep fields of pain he saw a reflection of himself. Dracos gaze wandered down his body to his hip bones. All his clothes he had worn before were laying beneath him a mess of ripped fabrics undefinable of what they had been before. Steaming iron was pressed onto his right hip bone and with an unsatisfying sizzling sound it exposed a horrible picture. Draco almost had to gag when a wave of a scent like from a barbeque reached his nostrils. This wasn’t some delicious food, like an oven roast for Christmas. This was his burning skin. His eyes began to water when he finally was able to put together the letters that had been burned into his sensitive skin slightly above his cock on the right side of his hip. PROPERTY.
Maybe there was no good and bad. Everyone consists of choices some good and some not so good and at one point there is no turning back. Or maybe there is. Isn’t everyone capable of doing good and bad things. Didn’t his mother take him to trips where he had watched her inflict pain on muggles. But also didn’t his mother protect him as good as she could from being tortured. Didn’t his mother once stopped some of the other death eaters from torturing a muggle child because she said it was wrong, it was just a child. She did good, she did bad. Maybe he was the same. Maybe Potter was the same. They all did good and bad things. No Potter only did bad things to Draco. Sectum Sempra, Nasty words in the school halls, hands around his throat while fucking him raw cracking bones and Crucio. No Potter only did bad things to Draco. He had saved him though during the war when everything was in flames, he had testified for him in court via owl, he had let him slept in his bed when he was cold. Malfoy was confused and he hurt so much. Maybe he did deserve this maybe he didn’t at some point Draco stopped wondering whether he deserved this, stopped trying to understand what was happening to him and why and stopped blaming himself or Potter and just drifted off to a uncomfortable sleep.
Somehow Harry had managed to get lost when he started to wander around to get a free head and a blank mind. He had wanted to walk back to the hotel that actually wasn’t too far away from the party but what started as simply walking and trying to free his mind turned into running and screaming inside to make all the voices inside shut up. So somehow Harry had managed to get lost and he was in Diagon Alley. Harry looked around to find his way back. He actually asked some of the last few wizards and witches on the streets for directions but they were not really helpful. Then Harry saw something that caught his eyes. A few witches in a back alley dressed very let’s call it different. Harry was standing there under the Hood of his cloak staring in their directions. Some of the witches moved a little around trying to gain his attention buy mumbeling arousing sentences but Harry wasn’t that much into that kind of business. He wanted to leave when a woman with long blonde hair and heavy make-up walked straight up to him. “Are you lost – honey?” Harry freezed in place like he was hit by a curse. He knew that voice even if it was slightly higher pitched and sounded a little horse he knew that voice. He would recognize that voice anywhere. “Malfoy?” he asked unable to move unable to barely recognize that face under all that paint in this dark alley at 4 o’clock in the morning. But still he was sure. It wasn’t really a question. Harry saw the confusion and the embaresmment in his grey eyes. Yes it was him. He threw back the hood of his cloak to get a better view and looked Malfoy straight in the eyes. Yes it was him even if his face was painted with tonnes of make up und grief and desperation, cheap false hair falling over his shoulders and body thin no not thin boney, no starving – it was him that hooker was Draco Malfoy.
Betrayal. That was the first thing he felt. Like a hard slap in the face, daggers in his chest and a choking hand around his neck. He could not breath, he could not cry he could not say anything. Then real pain shot through him like a lightning. White pure pain from his bottom and a real slap in his face and a real hand around his neck and real daggers – no  his chest was fine but it hurt. “I said scream.” But Draco couldn’t. He couldn’t give him the satisfaction. Of course it hurt and he did not expect it but really he was a hooker after all this was what he was here for. His body was screaming for it to stop but his mind went black like it always did when he slept with someone. He focused on the spot Harry was occasionally hitting deep inside him during his brutal paste. Draco ignored the blood from his ripped entrance, the slaps in his face and the cruel voice that told him all the bad things that he already knew. This was nothing he couldn’t handle. This was business this was – crack. He heard the familiar sound of bones cracking and for a moment he was unsure of what exactly happened. Then he felt it and finally he did scream. Like bloody hell screamed.
Memories of horrible times flashed through him. Weeks of being locked in a closet under the stairs only getting food every 3 days for he was not good enough at pretending that he did not exist. It had started early. He remembered being put their when he was still a toddler. Uncle Vernon had given a poker game with friends at his living room and as a punishment he had gagged Harry in the closet for 9 long hours no food, no water, no toilet. He had been bound so he couldn’t trash around either. Because last time when Vernon had friends over Harry got scared alone in the dark for so long that he came out and started to cry. This time Vernon had made sure that he would not get disturbed.
Slowly the members started to undress until the only wore their underwear. The blonde man roughly forced Yoongi up and ripped away his clothes. “ My name Danny and I am the leader of this group. You will always follow my orders if you want to make sure to stay safe! You will all address me as Sir! Is that clear?” Again Namjoon calmly translated for the others. Hesitantly all of them answered with yes sir. “Don’t hurt them…” Yoongi pressed out between clenched teeth. Namjoon silently cursed the  independent brave boy. Danny took his Yoongis chin forcefully in his hand as he made Yoongi look up to him while he pressed the barrel of the gun to the boys lips. One of his Hyungs screamed for Danny to get away from Yoongi but was shut up with a hard slap to the face. Namjoon could only watch in horror as Danny pressed the gun against Yoongis gritted teeth until he brushed it past his lips and teeth forcing the gun inside Yoongis mouth. “Suck it!” Danny ordered. “If you are so brave give me a show worth seeing if you really want me to not hurt your friends!”
The boys arrived at the location for their new video shooting for a little outdoor home concert on Youtube. They have been planning that video for weeks with the team and are so excited for this day. When they arrive at the location tho something seems off. Namjoon is the first to get out of the car and its clear that something is not right. There is nobody around at the big forest. He turns around as the other band members get out of the car. He shots them a worried look. Yoongi walks up next to Namjoon frowning. The new driver of the car gets out of his seat and walks over to them. Before Namjoon can say anything he is faced with a gun pointed at his head. Yoongi turns to the driver to ask him if he maybe he just got the wrong address or drove to the wrong part of the forest when he sees the gun pointed at the band leader. He acts quickly without thinking pushing Namjoon to the side as he protectively steps in front of the gun shielding the other members who start to look worried. The man before them chuckles slightly as he puts a finger on the trigger of the gun. “What do you want?” Namjoon asks in Korean slightly trembling voice but still very calm and polite tone. The new driver has only been there for a week yet, he is an American Korean who just recently moved to Seoul. He looks at the half Korean man that now points the gun and Yoongi. “ I am sure we can work this out like civilized people. If its money you want we can call the agency right now so you can tell them your conditions. There is no need for violence! We will be cooperating with you so please put down the gun.” The other members try not to panic to much as they stare at the scene before them. The man laughs dryly as he looks directly at Namjoon. “I have enough money… that is not the reason for this. Actually I get payed quite well for delivering you guys here.” Namjoon freezes as he hears approaching footsteps. Before he can turn around tho he feels the barrel of a shotgun pressed to his head from behind. The gasping sound from the other band members tells him that the same just happened to them. “All of you put your hands over your head and turn around slowly!” a male voice states in English. Namjoon repeats the sentence for the others in Korean and all of them do as the are told. A team of 14 armed Americans face the 7 members. Every member now has one man in front  of them while the barrel of a shotgun is pressed to their backs by another one. They silently follow their captors into the forest. Namjoon shots Yoongi a warning look as he can see anger building up in the though rapper. He slightly shakes his head symbolizing his friend not to make trouble and stay put. Taehyung tries to turn around to find Yoongis gaze but the man behind him slaps him with the barrel of the shotgun hard telling him to keep walking. They follow the group to a clearing in the forest where a big house is located. The 7 boys silently walk inside the building where they are lead downstairs to a big room. There are 7 beds in the room that actually look pretty clean but what makes the members gasp in surprise is not the nice silky bed sheets or the comfortable looking pillows but the massive iron shackles attached to the ground next to ever bed. Every member gets led to one of the beds. “Take of your clothes!” A blonde man instructs the boys. And Namjoons eyes wide in shock. Yoongi glares at the man while Jimin and Jungkook yelp in surprise. Seokjin looked confused so did Hoseok. Namjoon saw Yoongi move and tried to stop the rapper but he wasn’t fast enough Yoongi crushed his body against the blonde man and threw a hard blow to his chin. Immidiatly all the guns and shotguns were pointed at Yoongi who angrily yelled at the blonde man who just chuckled as he punched Yoongi hard. “I said take off those damn clothes! Right now or dear Suga will have a bullet inside his skull. We can test how bulletproof he is right now!” He said as he hold his gun to Yoongis head while licking away some blood trickling down his chin. Namjoon repeated the order in Korean voice shaking now. The members stared at their captors with wide eyes. “Don’t…” Yoongi said while turning around too look at his Hyungs. BANG. A loud scream echoed the walls as Yoongi fell to the ground. The blonde man had fired his gun shooting Yoongi into his knee. “Don’t make me repeat myself! The next bullet will end him!” The blonde man said coldly pointing the gun he just fired at Yoongis head again. “ Not so brave anymore huh?” He chuckled at the boy on the ground. Namjoon could only watch in horror as the boys around him reacted with gasps screams and trembeling. Jungkook tried to run over to his Hyung but stopped in his tracks as he was hit by the man next to him. Namjoon couldn’t believe the words that left his lips when he told his fellow band members to take of their clothes, a single tear running down his cheek as he looked at Yoongi on the ground.
They kept walking in silence for the rest of the time. Harry was a little worried about Draco and started to study him even harder. He was wearing long over knee Boots, they were broken on and badly fixed as well as most of his sloppy and cheap clothes. The wig he was wearing was also extremely cheap and looked like it had been worn one too many times. Malfoy was unmorally thin he looked like he was half death. Some of his skin showed light bruises that he tried to hide under cheap make up. He looked awful. Before Harry could think of what he could possibly say Draco stopped right in front of him. “There you go the Owls Inn. Good bye Potter.” With that Draco turned around to walk back where he came from. “Wait.” Malfoy did. “What do you want Potter, fancy a fuck now? You want revenge for the time back at Hogwarts and want to mark me with your come while you tell me that I am a cheap slut? Come one I don’t have all day. Some people have to work for their money.” Harry frowned. Then he asked. “ How much do you earn a night?” Draco laughed and came closer to him. “The whole night you say? 300 galleons but Potter a hotel like the owl’s Inn is not really the kind that would let a former death eater inside you know. ” Harry just laughed. “Come on Malfoy, I am Harry Potter. They let me take in whoever I want. But if you are so worried here, take my cloak they won’t see you then.” Draco eyed the cloak for a moment before taking it. He put the hood deep over his face before following Harry inside.
Over the next few weeks Merlin didn’t let Arthur leave his chambers, breeding him every day and fucking him all over the place. Arthur had turned into a perfect slut willingly letting Merlin take him, his dick had shrunken into a micro penis by now. Arthur had finally accepted his place. He was standing at his window looking over his kingdom, tenderly caressing his slightly swollen belly under the nightgown he was wearing. A maid entered his chambers with a beautiful long white gown, embroided with hundreds of pearls. It was his wedding day today to become Merlins perfect queen and the crownation day for Merlin to become the rightful king alongside his beautiful bride and soon to be mother of their perfect spouse.
“Bright as always Granger. I have to say.” Malfoy was standing in the door. A long Cloak he took from Harrys closet covering up his body. “Potter found me on the streets and offered help. Always the concerned golden boy. We got into quite a fight during lunch before Kreacher announced that you were already on your way. So I left to grab my things and get out of here but it seems like you can’t be fooled that easily.” Harry didn’t know what to think should he be thankful or angry. What did Draco think he was doing? Clearly he was not helping. How was he supposed to explain to Hermione that he took in Draco Malfoy after all. A traitor and coward and hooker. Harry Potter was fucked. “Draco Malfoy?” Hermione shot Harry an inscrutable look. “ Harry why exactly were you trying to hide this? And what do you mean he found you in the streets Draco. I am seriously confused.” Harry started to feel very uncomfortable in his body right now. “You know Hermione after all that happened during the war and what… you know … I mean I wasn’t sure how you would react and…” Draco laughed dryly. “ He probably was a little embarrassed because I am a hooker and maybe he did not want to explain why he brought me home.” Hermione was shocked. “Excuse me… what? Are you saying you two are… I mean…” Draco just shook his head and took a seat across from Hermione and Harry. “Not what you think Granger. Potter got lost after some Party in Diagon Alley and didn’t find his hotel but he found me selling myself on the streets and I gave him directions. He didn’t really like how I ended up though and tried to talk to me but I seriously don’t see the point. It’s not his fault after all. It’s just how life is. Once you take the wrong turn there is no going back. No one forced me to do this but there is nothing much really I can do either.” Hermione sat there stunned for a moment. Then she started to slap Harrys arm. “ Harry James Potter! What is wrong with you! Why would you want me to come over to talk about this stupid engagement party when there are real Problems that we have to solve! Are you serious? What is wrong with you!” Harry tried to shield himself. “Hermione please would you stop… Like he Draco said there is nothing much we can do about this and I can handle it..” Hermione kept hitting him. “Oh no! I see how you can handle this! No kidding! This is a mess and I am not leaving this with you! The three of us will have a meeting. I will do research on what to do now and we will discuss this together! Maybe we should ask Ron to … now that would not be helping. Maybe Kingsley or Molly. We need someone with connections and life experience and I need to organize this…” Draco frowned. “Is she always like that? Granger listen I appreciate it, really but I don’t want some sick trials again with people telling me what I have to do with my life. It is only 3 more years of probation after that I get my magic back and can finally get back to a normal life as well so thank you very much but I can handle the situation myself. I am a grown men and I have been fine for the last two years on my own. So thank you very much and as I told Potter before. No help needed.” Hermione’s lip started to tremble in frustration. “Harry. Did you know about this? Say something we have to do something.” Draco just shook his head. “ No you don’t. We never were friends so seriously just stay out of it.” Harry stood up. “Hermione maybe we should reschedule. I will talk to Draco and maybe we can find a solution after everything calmed down but I think it would be best if nobody pressured anyone into doing what they don’t want wouldn’t you agree. I think we should slow down a bit.” Hermione just sighed. “ Fine. But under protest. This is not over, and there will be a lot of explaining. I am going to research our options here and I will owl you Harry.” Harry just nodded and showed her out a little frustrated. When Hermione had left he came back to Draco furiously.
Harry woke up early in the morning. He had slept for probably only two hours maybe three. The first thing he did was taking a look at his whore. With a smile on his face he saw the lightning scar and his initials. He licked his lips this was going to be the perfect revenge. For a moment regret shot through him while he watched Draco sleep so peacefully. No he deserved this. Draco Malfoy was a monster, a coward. He was the reason for so many deaths. He deserved this. The black haired man turned around and without making a sound he disappeared. He went to grimmold place first ordered Kreacher to get everything he needed for his new servant. And afterwards he did some work, mainly answering letters. This was his life now. He didn’t really become an auror like he always wanted to be. Well he did but he actually did not work as one. He worked as Harry Potter – Hero of a nation. He smiled for cameras used products he got for free or even got payed for and told people what they wanted to hear. In newspaper interviews, the radio or TV. He simply was a celebrity like he had always been. Only know he did not try to run from it any longer he did what people expected from him ignoring the darkness that was consuming him from the inside. He was Harry Potter, a hero, the golden boy, the good man.
“Draco…” Malfoy cut him off right away. “Spare me Potter. You think you are so high above all of us. You had it hard because mommy and daddy got killed? You didn’t even know them. You lost friends during the war? You’re not the only one: Everyone did. You think that was hard? You think that was pain? You’re telling me I don’t know what a lifetime of pain is. You didn’t even know anything about the wizarding world for years being save in you little loving muggle family, away from all the pain and the war and the horror!” Tears welled up in Dracos eyes. He had enough. Not being able to defend his body was one thing but his mind was his. His aunt had trained him years in Occlumency and he had promised himself that no-one would ever attack him there. His mind had been his save place and Harry Potter had even taken that from him. He wanted Potter to feel the same humiliation that he just felt. He wanted to force Potter to go through his worst memories like he just had to. Clearly Potter had never felt pain like Draco did. Draco deserved at least this one outmatch over Potter. Golden Potter with his perfect life and perfect friends and perfect everything who always hid behind the excuse that his life was so bad because Voldemort killed his parents, always bettering Draco in everything. He had enough just this once he wanted to be better in something. He wanted the satisfaction of knowing that his life was far worse than the one of goldy golden Potter and he wanted to humiliate him and rub it in his face. And somehow with all that emotion Draco had managed to break through Harrys light barrier around his mind. After all Harry was never really good at Occlumency. Of course he had trained with Snape but that was years ago and he wasn’t really good at it at that time either. Draco saw and felt the horrors that had accompanied Harry through his life and the war as well. The traumatical abuse and torture of a young child by his own family. The loss of so many off his friends. The horrors he had seen through Voldemorts eyes. Slowly he began to truly understand what made Harry into the man that was standing before him, the boy he had known in school. A boy that had just tried to survive the torture that his life had been like he did himself. What Draco thought had been Arrogance was the mask a broken boy had worn to never been called weak again. What Draco thought had been Cruelty had been a child’s only option to defend himself. What Draco thought had been the acts of a fool had been attempts to save the friends and family he had left. Draco saw how Harry had rebelled against the dark lord and how he paid for it with so many of his friends and family. Draco saw how Harry cast a spell he didn’t know in anger, Sectum Sempra, and felt his pain when he didn’t know how to take it back or how to top it to save Draco. Draco saw how Harry got tortured so many times over the years, how he got treated by the people around him, how he lost almost everything but never stopped fighting and he saw how Harry felt like he was a murderer like he got the impression that all the blood was on his own hands. Draco saw so many things he didn’t know about Harry Potter and he couldn’t take it any longer and left the mind of the broken man before him. Realization shot through both of them. They both were broken. They both were branded by darkness. Thy both needed help.
He broke the kiss gasping for air. It had been a long and wild kiss almost like they were eating each other - two starving men unsure how to survive. Harry looked at Draco. He saw lust in his grey eyes but something else too, fear maybe confusion maybe sadness. Harry just stood there still, motionless. He had been obsessed with Draco. It had started in 6th year. Harry had told himself a hundred times that it had only been because he knew that Draco was planning something but all his friends had been worried. Harry had pretty much stalked Draco. And his mind had wandered off to images of the blonde haired boy more than once when he had been lying in bed during that time. Harry did not know what he was feeling. Was it hate, was it love was it both. No he hated Malfoy. He loved Ginny. He liked girls. He didn’t like Draco. He hated Malfoy. Harry Potter had always hated Draco Malfoy. Sectum Sempra, he almost killed the man before him. Harry had been obsessed with Draco being a death eater and not the boy himself. He had followed him around to find out what he was up to . He had thought of him in bed because he couldn’t let the topic go. He loved Ginny. Ginny who had been like a sister to him. Ginny with her warm smile who always felt like family. Ginny whose brother was dead. Because of Voldemort, because of the death eaters, because of Malfoy.
Memories of horrible times flashed through him. Memories of the night his parents died brought back by the dementors that tortured him in 3rd year. Memories of Cederic Diggory dying, of Sirius dying, of Dumbledore dying, of Dobby dying. Flashbacks of hundreds of people he had seen tortured and killed through Voldemort’s eyes. Almost every night when he went to sleep during school times after 4th year he had wandered into Voldemort’s body during sleep. He had seen him torture children, women, men he had seen him kill hundreds of people and it always felt like he did it. Harry always felt like a murderer. Blood on his hands. Blood of innocent people, of friends, of family.
At 8 pm Harry entered the lobby of the hotel. He spotted Draco right away. He was sitting in an armchair far away from the main desk and Harry smiled. Draco was wearing Gryffindor red lace underwear that could almost be seen through a thin almost seethrough short Red dress. The dress was embroidered with a gold pattern. Draco was wearing black socks with suspenders and black high heels. He didn’t look like a cheap whore anymore. He looked like an expensive whore now. A thin black cloak with a little hood was barely able to cover Draco’s body and outfit. But the hood gave him the only cover that he would get. He was able to hide his face. But his body Harry would show off. Even if it wasn’t in good shape just jet. Harry walked over to Draco. “You almost look stunning. Though the perfect clothes can not cover your imperfect body it was the best I could do. Now be a doll and accompany me to dinner darling.” Harry said mockingly. All Draco did was standing up and taking Harrys offering arm like a good girl. Draco had probably never felt more embarrassed in his life than right now. Harry grabbed Malfoys arm hard. “ I could not hear your thank you for the new clothes Malfoy. It might be a little loud in hear so maybe you should speak up a little.” Draco bowed his head and with a clear voice he said. Thank you for the beautiful clothes Master, I am sorry that I can’t make them look as good as they should look.” With a smile Harry started to walk out of the hotel with Draco. “ That is a good girl.”
An hour later Draco found himself sitting on his sofa in soft pyjamas nursing a rich Bordeaux Pansy has pulled out of her purse with all the dramatic flair of a muggle magician extracting a rabbit from a hat. Pansy sat opposite him in pyjamas that she’d also withdrawn from The Impossibly Small Purse.
Draco turned his head to look behind, confirming all his worst, bespeckled fears were indeed standing only a short distance behind him, albeit looking confused rather than the furious black hair vengeance demon with glowing red eyes that has taken up residence in Draco’s nightmares of late. In a split-second, Draco noted that Potter’s emerald green sweater matched his eyes. Dozens of possibilities with the gold tinge of wish fulfilment swept over him but the pit of dread in his stomach that reeked faintly of cowardice won out, and he ran. The restroom door swung shut behind him, and without waiting for the relative safety of a cubicle, Draco turned on the spot and disapparated into the welcoming compression of empty space with a crack.
“Maybe it would’ve been better is you’d slept with the barman.” Draco heard the drag of a glass across the wooden booth. “Finish your drink darling and let’s get out of here.”
He’d known that Pansy and Granger were acquaintances at the Ministry. He knew that Granger worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and by her uncompromising nature and relentless pursuit for equity and reform had attained something of a reputation for ruffling feathers. It was natural then that she would cross paths with Pansy in the Minister’s office. He hadn’t known, however, that Pansy’d been spending any time with Granger outside of what was necessary to ensure the right feathers were smoothed, or the right plutocrat threatened. He never would’ve guessed that they would talk about Potter. Or him.
“I love your dress” Draco elected to ignore her lack of greeting, and thanked his lucky stars that her dress wasn’t as sharp as it looked.
“I’m sorry I ran. I panicked.” Draco is even surprised to find that he is sincere, after the platitudes have left his mouth. He is sorry he ran that night. Sorry that he let his cowardice get the better of him. Sorry that he had showed Potter once again, that he was everything Potter had ever accused him of being. Before he can force the words back into his mouth: “People are watching.”
“For chasing you, that night. It was… rude of me. Finding you, in a place like that — of course you weren’t looking to reminisce about the good old days. I guess I was surprised.”
“Potter”. Draco had been aware of course, that attending events such as these brought with the the danger of ending up in proximity with Potter and any number of his Gryffindor ilk, however had thus far done a rather marvellous job of avoiding him.
Several times more hard liquor than Draco usually drank at these charity events imbuing him with more courage than he’d felt in the rest of his life combined, he found himself sometime later taking Luna’s hand and leading her, giggling and also slightly beyond tipsy, back towards the kaleidoscope floor as the band launched into
The 2004-era chart topper most notable for featuring in the scene in which Pansy drags Draco to a nightclub is
Draco blamed the alcohol for what happened next, and had a very strong suspicion that Rolf and Luna had somehow engineered it.
Pansy took a sip of her wine, and looked at him, considering. The warmth of her wine and her company suffused Draco, and he felt himself disarm, sinking into his soft fabric lounge.
“It was nice to see you, Draco. Give your mother my best” Potter said, and left. Their clasped hands were the last part of them to remain in contact, and he imagined perhaps, the way that Potter’s hand had lingered in his more than civility required. Draco. He pretended that he wasn't savouring how his name sounded rolling off Potter’s tongue. He watched Potter as he joined Granger and Weasley, and together, they left, shaking Armeriliana Rosenthorpe’s hand on their way out through the fairy-clad blooming moon dew archway, and then disappeared into the night.
— it wouldn’t go to be totally uniformed — he felt a twinge of resentment for his self-imposed sometimes-exile. The laughing faces in the society pages, which in generations previous had always featured Malfoys in pride of place, were instead filled with people of unremarkable pedigree—first war heroes, now celebrities. The new world order. And always, ducking out of the photograph as if it was all beneath him, a shock of messy black hair, and something like guilt welled up anew. A debt left unsettled.
Draco had never in his life planned to become bosom friends with Luna Lovegood of all people however at the end of the day she hadn’t given him much say in the matter. She had turned up on the doorstep of his flat shortly after Draco had been accepted into his potions post-grad, when he had been panic-level deep reading through every paper published on salamander scales for the last two hundred and eighty years.
“Looks that way.” Clearing his throat, Harry watches as Malfoy slopes toward him, his lean figure cutting through the snow like a knife. He hadn’t prepared for a conversation; pain lances up his leg and settles in the base of his spine and he does his best not to grimace as Draco leans against the wall next to him. “What brings you out?”
“It’s getting late,” he all but whispers, shivering despite the charmed warmth of the pub. “We should probably go back. Lessons to prepare, right?”
I haven't updated in a year. But I hope this semi-long chapter will make up for that. See my first chapter for important notes regarding the story as a whole. I'm sorry for the delay; 2020 was a rough year for a lot of us.
“What about that Dippet bloke? Your partner. You said yourself he’s a genius with a wand and he’s left the Ministry, and could be McGonagall knows his family, since he’s Armando’s great-great-great grandson, or nephew, or something.” Harry splutters but keeps his face buried in his teacup, hoping Neville doesn’t see the way his own cheeks darken at the mention of his former partner. Clearly, however, Neville’s so consumed by thoughts of their future coworker that the boggart could hop out of its cupboard and he wouldn’t notice. “Or there’s the Prentiss twins, they both wanted to be professors when we were in school…”
They lapse into strained silence once more, their usual twilight boldness unable to help them now. Harry finds himself tapping on the wood of his cane, tapping his other fingers against his leg, looking everywhere except at the pale face which considers him from above the cauldron.
Harry likes to think he’s cultivated a calming atmosphere. He surveys his classroom with a discerning eye: would he have felt comfortable here, learning spells to protect himself and his friends? Candles sit on every spare ledge, endlessly burning with the help of a few clever tricks, lending their warm and flickering glow to a room bedecked with wide windows and gentle sunlight. A cupboard rattles in the corner. Sneakoscopes perch on their edges along the wide shelves beside objects which whir and spin unthreateningly, while enchanted keys flit, feathers rustling, near the ceiling. He’d thought, perhaps, to add a grindylow to his collection, but Luna had regarded him with some measure of bewildered astonishment when he’d mentioned it, so he’d chosen instead to include portraits of dangerous creatures to the mix.
He holds out a hand and she looks at it with confusion. After a moment, she places her wand in his palm, hesitant, unsure. Harry studies it. Rolls it between his fingers. Smiles, just a little, wondering what bit of magic had flowed from her in that dim and cluttered shop.
“Potter.” Draco’s voice is smooth and cold and it startles Harry’s heart into a strange, uneven rhythm of subtle panic. The teacher’s lounge again. Just the two of them again. Steam erupts from the kettle as Harry’s magic throbs from his fingertips, the water boiling and screaming as it bubbles and froths. With a cough, Harry stops it, focusing for a moment on pouring his tea, waiting until his cheeks cool to turn around.
“I couldn’t!” He can only see her face, but Harry’s sure she’s wringing her hands in worry, and a small, mean part of him is happy for it. She should feel guilty. “Harry, Professor McGonagall made me promise not to say anything, and to be fair, she made the smart decision, because we all know how antagonistic you two are toward each other, but you know I would have told you if I could.”
“Of course, Miss Baker.” He gestures toward the empty seat across from him and she takes it, fidgeting nervously as she does, unable to meet his gaze for more than a few seconds at a time. Harry waits patiently, his hands folded in his lap, eyes steady as he watches her face.
“I can’t do it.” Finally she speaks, dark gaze settling on his own. “I’ve tried and tried but I can’t make it happen. I sit in my bed and I try to make my books levitate, or I try to Summon things without my wand, and I just can’t do it. It’s infuriating!”
He sinks into one of the plush armchairs as Harry turns to busy himself with the tea, reluctantly pouring one for Draco as well. His cane rests against the cupboard and Harry eyes it with reproach, as though its existence is some personal offence. Eschewing it, he does his best not to limp as he walks to the chair opposite Draco’s, depositing the tea before him with a perfunctory clatter. There’s a moment of awkward silence wherein Harry stares at the table and Draco looks at the wall.
Harry moves toward the student, but before he can even summon an indignant shout, a spell whistles past his ear and collides with the chest of the fourth-year who uttered the insult. The boy is flung back and held against the wall, his eyes wide with terror as the black-clad attacker descends upon him like a wraith.
“We don’t have time tonight for a lesson. But we’ll meet every other Tuesday, here, after dinner.” He locks eyes with each of them individually. “Intuitive magic is extremely difficult and it will leave you exhausted. Make sure you pay attention in Potions — an Invigoration Draught will come in handy. Now. Go back to your common rooms. Don’t let Filch catch you; I won’t be covering for you.”
Enchanted lights hang above him, sparkling and colourful, celebratory of the upcoming holiday without being garish. The red and green only add to the alcoholic fervour which has set Harry’s nerves alight; he can feel how sallow his face must look, its usual russet glow offset by the anxiety pooling in his gut. Somewhere deep in his mind he knows he should stop drinking lest he make a fool of himself. He counts to ten, drums his fingers on the tabletop, decides he will give Malfoy one more minute before he returns to the castle.
The click of the door opening echoes, cavernous, pulling Harry from his moment of introspection. But Neville’s grinning face is always a welcome sight, and Harry can’t help but reciprocate, smiling widely as he watches those long legs carry Neville down the stairs. Longbottom towers over him, his strides smooth and clean, and Harry immediately banishes any resentment that leaks through his enthusiasm to see his friend.
“Yeah.” Neither of them move, at first. They look at each other over the tabletop, mouths set with untold stories and frozen secrets.
“I think you’re in the clear.” Amusement colours his voice, easy smile still lingering around his mouth. She smiles back, seeming to glow in the early morning light, her fingers working up to twitch a lock of his hair between them.
The laughter dies on his lips as he heaves into consciousness, his leg aching, head throbbing with the fading sounds of screams and whispers. Dust motes hover, stagnant, in the beams of sunlight which filter through the long curtains. Sunrise has cast an orange glow into the morning air. Harry groans, rolling over, pressing his face into his pillow in some futile attempt to smother himself back to sleep. He can feel his heartbeat thumping frantically in his chest; he is no stranger to unpleasant dreams, but they never fail to leave him feeling helpless, terrified, as though he’s stuck in the past with all the demons contained there.
“What?” Harry doesn’t mean for it to come out as harshly as it does; Luna’s sideways glance at him holds no reproach, despite a raised, pale brow.
“So ‘Arry,” Hagrid hedges, not able to meet Harry’s gaze. “Wha’ d’you think of tha’ Malfoy bloke teachin’ here? I reckon it were quite a shock to yeh!”
“Dippet couldn’t fix a leaking cauldron.” His voice is harsh and his hand flexes around the flagon, a pale fist as tense as the pale jaw which works above it. “I don’t know much about the curses on these objects. But I knew enough. Enough to stop the bleeding… To stop—well. To get you to St. Mungo’s. Besides, Dippet was too busy shouting to help.”
“Wrackspurts,” she says delicately, taking a step back from him to observe their beastly companions. They’ve eaten most of Harry’s offerings, moving now toward the pair, to inspect their pockets and bags for any further whiff of food. Unimpressed by their findings, the thestrals disperse, wandering through the field as the sun casts its light upon their inky skin. “I’ve always thought it. They’re why your hair stays so messy.”
“We meet again.” The morning has not yet begun to break through the black of night, but they have both entered the grounds, breathing puffs of steam into the dark sky. Draco’s voice is dry, quiet, and still it makes Harry flinch and shrink against the wall. He’s never been jumpy. He chooses not to think about what this sudden startle reflex means.
“As we have now been colleagues for some time, Harry, I would not be offended if you were to call me Minerva.” His anger quickly turns to bemusement; her use of his first name has never ceased to surprise him, but the idea of using hers is so foreign to him he had never even considered it. If her aim had been to shut him up for a moment, she’d certainly succeeded. “If I recall correctly, you and Mr Malfoy worked together for several years at the Ministry. Were the two of you at war even then?”
“They like you,” comes a crystalline voice, a lilting and silvery thing that seems to come from the mist itself, and Harry smiles even wider. The thestrals do not scatter as they would for any other newcomer; they simply continue eating, content as they swish their black tails. Harry turns, unsurprised to see the pale figure ensconced in a blonde halo, her cherubic smile serene and unaffected by the past which had so disfigured her peers.
“Morning,” Harry says, soft and gentle. The mood changes quickly; thestrals swarm him with coos of excitement, battering him in their attempt to get to the meat they can smell in the bag dangling at his side. A foal nips at his hand and he laughs, reminded painfully of Hedwig, of the way she used to peck at his hands when he held food near without surrendering it. He scatters the meat about, trying his best to be fair with its distribution, and he smiles sadly as he watches them pick at the garish red scraps. Tentative, he holds a piece out for the foal, watches as she sniffs and then gingerly removes the meat from his hand.
“Ronald!” His mother’s voice interrupts him and Ron flushes again, narrowly avoiding a spoon that has come whizzing past his head. Harry grins widely, and they all move to the table, crowded together around a family meal that makes Harry want to laugh and cry all at the same time.
“Of course I was afraid,” Harry replies, his voice quieter than he’d thought it would be. Every year he gets some variation of this question and it never gets easier to answer. “I was afraid every second. I tried to be brave but I knew what I was risking. I watched my friends die… my family… I knew I would watch people die around me until the end. And that was the worst part.”
A silver flash catches his eye — Draco, standing from the table, glancing momentarily in Harry’s direction before sauntering away.
“Potter.” That cool voice is as infuriating as it had ever been, though now it is imbued with true calm where in younger years it had been filled with some desire to be noticed, to be seen, if even by its enemy. “Don’t let me interrupt whatever conversation you’re having with yourself.”
“Git,” Harry mutters, though he’s grateful for the teasing, comfortable with even false animosity. But he finally turns, looks up at Draco’s smirking expression which is still turned straight ahead, the shimmering scars cast into shadow. Thinking for a moment, he shrugs, swallowing as he turns away once again. “All right. I suppose if this is all a scheme to poison me, at least McGonagall will have to know who the culprit is.”
Their youthful faces have gone from interested to ashen. But this is only the beginning of the questions.
“Who d’you think she’s chosen? I know Padma’s had her eye on Hogwarts for a while since she quit the Prophet.” He accepts his tea from Harry and stirs an alarming amount of sugar into the steaming cup, dark eyes alight with an unsolved mystery. “Or—could it be Ron? At the Weasleys’ that night, he was talking—“
“Luna,” he says fondly, wiping his hands on his trousers before meeting her for a long embrace. Lavender, honey, smoke, elderflower; she smells familiar and floral, like something he remembers from a dream. As they pull back she smiles widely at him, radishes dangling from her ears and a sun charm held tight to her throat. He holds her at arms’ length for a moment before dropping his hands, steadying himself on his cane. “Ginny send you to check on me?”
“I was sorry to hear about your father,” Harry lies, hiding his face behind the ale as he takes a drink. That was a funeral he hadn’t attended; Lucius Malfoy had never been a man Harry could see himself absolving of his sins. Draco barks a harsh laugh, taking a drink himself, some dark humour Harry doesn’t understand settling, heavy, on his brow.
“D’you know who made these?” His tone is conversational, aimed at whatever presence has interrupted his sullen introspection. “I’ll probably eat it anyway, so just tell the truth—“
She scurries from the office with a tumbling mess of appreciative words, and Harry knows that she will practice against his advice, more and more advanced spells until she winds up in the hospital wing.
“Don’t do that.” Draco somehow sounds amused and irritated at the same time, lips curled in something that might be a smile. “You don’t have to be a hero all the time, Potter.”
“Thank you,” Harry says in a whisper. Understanding dawns on Draco’s face. Perhaps he has been using the potion so long he’d forgotten what the pain really felt like — until now. Harry reaches out. Grasps Draco’s hand in both of his own. He can feel the unsteady pulse in that translucent wrist.
“Oh, Harry, I just—I wanted to see how you’re doing. I know sometimes the school year can be stressful, and I had some ideas about lesson plans if you’re having trouble, or I’m happy to just hear whatever ideas you’ve come up with so far. Education is very important, after all.” Each word comes more and more quickly as though they’re fighting to make it out of her mouth, and Harry smiles with some bemusement until it dawns on him. Guilt. The smile looks guilty and the words are all guilty and even Hermione can see the exact moment when Harry Potter becomes angry.
“State your name.” The gargoyle sounds bored, tired, as though guarding the spiral staircase has become more a chore than a duty.
a bit petulant, but I know Draco’s done nothing to endear himself to you.” Not hurt, then, though of course she’ll get her scolding in. Harry has to stifle a smile at that. It’s like they’re in school again and she’s chiding him for not doing his potions assignments or for teasing a first-year. Perhaps he's still a child after all.
Pinprick stars glow in the black sky. The moon shines, round and heavy, illuminating their path with pale light that makes Draco shine silver and casts Harry into shadow. He laughs at the thought, granting him a confused look from his companion, which he duly ignores, simply continuing to focus on his steps, the uneven ground they traverse.
“It needs to simmer a moment.” Malfoy’s voice is closer than Harry had been expecting and he takes a startled step back, hand flailing for his cane. The two consider each other over the silver curls of steam which waft upward from the potion.
“I know I have rather large shoes to fill,” Malfoy says, his voice uncharacteristically subdued. This draws a smattering of laughter, though his own tone does not sound amused. “I can’t promise to fill them, but I can promise to try. I’m relying on all of you to help me.”
“Professor?” A cautious voice draws his attention away from the stacks of parchment on his desk. He knows the voice, but it carries an unusual air of uncertainty now, a lack of confidence, a vulnerability that makes him pause. Looking up, Harry gives the girl a reassuring smile, hands pausing in their shuffling and organising. “Can I talk to you for a moment?”
“Your wand is a conduit for your magic.” He points at the length of willow she’s clutching in her hand. “Without that conduit, the magic has to flow from you. It didn’t hurt when we were young; back then, we were an excess of magic just waiting to burst out. But when you use it consciously—it takes its toll. Your hand will feel fine within the hour. Intuitive magic isn’t for more intricate spellwork; the more magic you do, the more damage you do too. I will say—your intuition is rather creative. Most simply go for the redirect. You completely removed the Sneakoscope from its trajectory and made it appear elsewhere. I’m—very impressed.”
“Did you hear?” Anxiety thrills through Neville’s gentle voice, gilded with excitement, and he places his hands on Harry’s desk as though imparting some vital news. Harry’s only response is an uptick of his brows. “Flitwick’s retiring. Health reasons. Rumour is that McGonagall has already chosen his replacement.”
“Yes,” Draco interrupts, bemused, as though even he is unsure whether he accepted because he wants to go or simply to shut Harry up. Either way, Harry is grateful for the chance to stop talking, and he vanishes the teacup  in some attempt to do something with his hands.
“Harry Potter.” Harry is aware that his own voice is cold and prickly and tense as though it is under some immense amount of strain. Spine rigid, he waits for the message to be relayed to McGonagall, but try as he might, he cannot swallow down the anger that stains his vision red. Perhaps she knows what he’s come to say. Perhaps she won’t allow him entrance at all and he’ll be left to stew in his irritation, an angry student all over again. Surprisingly, however, the gargoyle springs to the side, its flat expression showing its utter disdain for Harry’s scowling demeanour as he moves to stride up the stairs.
“That kind of thinking ruined my family.” It’s a simple phrase but it takes Harry’s breath away, makes him turn toward the man he’d spent so many years trying to avoid. From this angle Draco is like a statue: perfect, sharp, features chiseled from marble by the steady hands of a master. From this angle there is no hint of the wounds which dance angrily across the other half of his face. “I don’t… I don’t want any of them thinking it’s right. I don’t want any of them to fall into the same trap I did.”
“I don’t mean to be rude,” McGonagall interrupts, considering him with a knowing look that he distinctly dislikes. “But the school year does begin tomorrow, and as you can imagine, I have much to do to prepare. My decision regarding the Charms professor is final, I’m afraid, but if you don’t mind my saying so: perhaps if you take a moment to speak with Draco, you might find that you have more in common than you think.”
“So you thought I’d confide in you?” Now he laughs, a sharp sound, mouth twisted into that smirk with which Harry is so familiar. “You were always a bit dull, Potter, but I thought you had to be at least a little clever to defeat the Dark Lord.”
“No one in your group has managed it yet,” he offers vaguely, plucking a Sneakoscope from the desk and turning it in his fingers. “It’s an extremely difficult form of magic. It’s fickle—more of an idea, an intention, than a defined spell. Think of it like your mind trying to solve a problem. You can’t try to force it to solve it the way you want it to be solved; you have to let the magic do it on its own.”
“And finally, an introduction must be made. As most of you have undoubtedly heard, Professor Flitwick has taken ill and will be unable to teach for some time. This term, Charms will be taught by Draco Malfoy.” Her tone is blunt; she invites no argument, and Harry is sure that this is directed at the professors as much as the students. At once the Great Hall erupts in murmured conversation, a hush that evolves into a roar, growing in volume until Draco himself stands to address the crowd of students.
The class dissipates with a low hiss of conversation, some choice curses toward the assignment smattered amongst the general gossip which tends to accompany the first day of the term. Second-years are amongst Harry’s favourites of the Hogwarts students; the novelty of his presence is far outweighed by their general annoyance at professors, as well as their lack of knowledge of the Second Wizarding War. He prefers the snide comments and the eye-rolling. Prefers being known as the teacher who would assign something difficult on the first day of the year rather than as Harry Potter, the Professor My Parents Talk About Over Pudding.
Draco’s lips part as though he might say something else, but the clatter of the porcelain on the serving tray snaps his jaw closed.
“Now, Miss Baker. Please get out of my office.” Her face falls for a moment before she sneaks a glance at the clock and manages a look of chagrin even under the weight of her smile. “I would like to get some sleep before tomorrow.”
He drops his wand arm and, by extension, the student, who looks dumbfounded. Serene, placid, Draco glides past Harry, ignoring the shocked expression which hangs limply below unruly black hair. Harry watches him go and feels deflated. His own rage seems to have nowhere to go, so he turns to the slack-jawed student and narrows his eyes.
“Save your apologies,” Harry quotes wryly, which grants him a small smile twitching across Draco’s mouth. They watch the students for a moment, and Harry wonders if Draco is thinking of his first years at Hogwarts, the moments of gaiety where even his bullying was juvenile, worth nothing more than hurt feelings and harsh words. Or is he thinking, perhaps, of a winter spent indoors, sobbing in a room filled with rubbish, wondering what will become of his family?
“Professor,” a timid voice manages, wavering. “Were you afraid? He Who Must N—I mean… Voldemort—he couldn’t even defeat you when you were a baby.”
A hush falls over the students as Harry enters the classroom, sunlight streaming through the windows to illuminate their eager faces in a soft yellow glow. His eyes narrow behind the round spectacles. Fourth years are never this attentive—not even during the interesting subjects like Patronus charms or his joint lessons with the new Transfiguration professor. Hesitantly, he places his things on the desk at the front of the room, thinking of the date.
When Harry woke up early in the next to Draco Malfoy he was confused. After putting together the events of the last night he remembered the pathetic feeling of being too hard on the man. Harry had allowed Malfoy of all people to sleep in his bed. Not only his bed. Ginny’s bed. They had picked it out together last year. Before she had left him. Could you really say she left him. She kind of did but actually Harry had built a brick wall of cold stone around him. He had driven her away with all he could and after months of taking it and understanding she finally didn’t anymore. She had begged him to get help and work this out somehow but Harry just didn’t talk to her anymore until one night she left and he did nothing to stop her and he did nothing to get her to come back. Of course he loved her. He had loved her for ages now but that wasn’t the point. Everyone he loved died or got hurt. So why bother to fix this it wasn’t worth the time. But letting Draco Malfoy sleep in that bed that is love had slept in with him – that was something he had to fix. This was worth his time.
