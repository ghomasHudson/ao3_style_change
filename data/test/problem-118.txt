“That means we get married on my 20th birthday.  That’s still a year and a half away.”
Draco seemed to want it just as much, arching his neck when Harry hit a good spot, his pale skin turning a deep pink when Harry sucked and kissed at a certain place a bit too long.
-Bike Rental:  They go to ‘On Your Bike’ for bike rentals, “nestled in unique arches under London Bridge”.
It was a jolt, seeing the contrast in his own dark, sad emotions to the sleepy, soft expression in Draco’s light blue-grey eyes. He seemed relaxed and unguarded.
“I think you need to pick a thicker, rougher blade of grass,” Harry said, splaying his hands out to show Draco the one he’d been using. It reminded Harry a bit of his DA days, training other students, and he could see the glint of determination in Draco’s demeanour as he bent his head to the task.
With a slight growl, Draco started pacing back and forth over the worn carpet in front of Harry.  “I just came from an interview.”
“No, of course not,” Draco said, stopping and slumping down on the edge of an easy chair.  “But it’s enough, Potter.  You saved me then, you saved me at the trial, and now you are trying to get me a job?”
“I’d never seen such crazy bedhead.”
It was a bit nerve wracking, waiting for Draco to arrive.  Even though he’d been over a few times, Harry started straightening the books on a shelf, and tucked some of the uglier old decorations out of sight.
“What is wrong with his face?” Draco said, staring at Harry far too closely.
Draco let out a huff of frustration and started pacing again.  “She just seemed amazed at everything I did, took lots of notes, and smiled at me.  A lot.”
Harry threw a final rock over the pond, pleased when it skipped a few times, satisfying his competitive nature.  “Fine.  Let’s go.”
But Harry didn’t let him up.  Auror training came in handy for times like this.  “We can  skip breakfast here and eat out later.  And we can check out a bit late.  She’ll just charge us a bit more.”
Harry sighed, looking upward.  “Look, I got dumped to live with my aunt and uncle and they weren’t to happy to have me there, OK?  Whenever I could, I spent time away from the house.”
Harry opened his eyes and glanced at Draco.  “Um, yeah.  I think it from being on the run so much this year.  Most of the time, we have been outdoors.  Out of sight.”
He must have eventually fallen asleep, having no idea how long until Draco had blown out his candles and slept as well.  Likely turned on his side also, turned away.
These past few days had shown Harry other sides to Draco. He had not been sneering, no sharp barbs. They had actually had conversations and even laughed together a few times. Skipped rocks together, for fuck’s sake. Was he starting to see Harry as a friend? After all these months of being around Voldemort and the Deatheaters, was he enjoying being away from all that? With someone his own age, even if it was his old school rival?
Next time he glanced over, Draco was napping. Obviously thinking Harry was no treat at all.
“What?  Right now?” Draco pulled back to stare down at Harry.
A few minutes more about how to brake, and general safety, and the staff stepped back.  Draco was already setting off along the wide pedestrian pathway, and Harry pedalled fast to catch up.
“Harry,” Draco gasped, tilting his head back as he sucked a faint pink mark into the fair skin on his neck.
Draco was sitting on the other end, legs crossed, twirling his wand.  Completely unconcerned.  “Satisfied?  I told you there was no way out.”  He pointed the wand at Harry’s wrists, and the binding disappeared.  “I don’t think you need that when you are outside.”
Could he grab a rock or a stick and hit Draco hard on the head? Leave him unconscious and get away? He didn’t relish the thought of hurting him, of hurting anyone, but his life was at stake. So much was at stake. Voldemort was gathering more power by the day, and without Dumbledor, could the Order of the Phoenix fight him? Defeat him? Was the prophesy correct? Could only Harry defeat him?
Even though he was aroused, Harry didn’t push for more.  He was loving this, kissing along Draco’s neck, his face.  His lips.  Harry kissed him again and again.  All the ways he had been wanting to for weeks, but had held back.
Harry got up, turning back to the castle with shoulders slumped.  It was large and boxy, made of dark blocks of heavy stone, built as a fortress.  Impenetrable.
Gathering himself, Harry clenched his teeth and walked unassisted to the cell.  It was slow, but he managed it.  He sunk down on to the bed, holding back a sigh of relief.
He strolled out of the busy market, Draco at his side, and spotted a sign.  “How about that?”
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, a bit surprised.
Several other wands shot towards him, and he caught them with his natural seeker skill.  All the wands from the skirmish at Malfoy Manor.   He got off Draco, standing with shaking legs.
After binding Harry’s wrists, Draco opened the door.  Harry moved slowly, like he had no energy, down the hallway, up the stairs, and then outside.
Draco gave him an exasperated glance.  “We have dinner reservations.  Quick, get your clothes ready while I jump in the shower.  We can’t be late!”  He rushed off, slamming the door behind him.
Harry broke the eye contact first, looking down.  “I had to do it.  You know I had no choice.”
Unrepentant, Draco leaned in for a kiss.  “It worked, didn’t it?  It got you into my bedroom, and naked on my bed.”
Harry had to swing past him twice before Draco swung up behind him on the broomstick, clutching Harry’s waist firmly.  Pure relief shot through Harry at the close contact and he headed right to the exit.  They all had to make it.
“Wait,” Harry said, almost too loudly.  Had he sounded a bit desperate?
“Very much so.  You?”
It became a bit of a silly, playful competition after that, rubbing and eating food off each other, shoving it in each other’s mouths.  A slow paced food fight.  By the end, the tray was empty, they were full, Draco’s hair was stained a pinkish-red from some strawberries, and Harry had cracker crumbs in some very uncomfortable places.  It was worse than sand at the beach.
Somehow, being in this remote spot, away from everything, Harry had let that fact slip away. It was back now, a burning feeling of dread running through him. What could he do? How could he escape?
It was warm enough that his pale skin was getting a bit rosy, either from the warmth or a light sunburn.  It was a nice contrast against his light grey eyes and the silver white tone of his hair.  The sunlight caught the faint stubble along his jawline, the fair colour of it making it invisible most of the time.
“What...you don’t like this?”
“Date,” Draco repeated, his expression a mix of frustration and confusion.
Draco must have sensed he was being watched, as he shifted a little, and his eyes slowly opened.  His sleepy gaze widened when he saw Harry lying so close, and met his gaze.
“Yes, of course,” Draco snapped back, looking down his nose at Harry.  “But you don’t exactly see them up close like that.”
Confused but curious, Harry slowly left the cell and went to the bottom of the stairs.  The thick door at the top was open too.
Draco sighed, and sat up, running his hand through his hair.  “What are you trying to say, Potter?”
He grabbed the mug and sipped.  Strong tea, hot and sweet.  It tasted wonderful.
Harry shook his head.  “I have to.”  Looking away from those beautiful eyes before he changed his mind, he shouted out firmly
-A/N:  Things going pretty well so far... but will that last?
Draco eventually finished his drink, and stood up, stretching like a cat.  He strolled over to Harry, looking down at him, still looking quite smug.  “Totally at my mercy.  Whatever shall I do with you?”
”Touch yourself,” Draco whispered, his voice a bit rough.
“Why June 5th?”
“Confused about what?” Draco asked, coming a bit closer to look into Harry’s face.
Hearing his name now, like this, was almost too much.  Harry moaned, shifting off to the side with his lower body, turning his head to rest it against Draco’s chest.  Trying to catch his breath, to keep his head from spinning.  Too much.  Feeling too much at once.
“No!  I don’t want fucking coffee!” Draco snapped.
“Just an ordinary childhood,” Draco said dismissively, and went back to his book.  The title mentioned Merlin, and Harry assumed it was historical fiction about that infamous wizard’s adventures.
Draco moved to kiss down Harry’s neck, nuzzling into his ear, his breath warm against his skin.  He was breathing faster too, making small pleased noises that turned Harry on completely.  Draco must have noticed, at some level, as he went back to kissing Harry, rocking against him.
Harry shuddered at the sensation, and turned his head to look at Draco.  “Oh,” he said, realization coming to him.  So many pieces clicking into place.
He glanced over at Draco. He was lying on his side, hands tucked under his cheek, still napping. He looked younger like this, and it was a reminder that they were both just barely adults. Draco was a few inches taller than Harry now, slim and athletic in his build. His face had slimmed down, showing his cheekbones a bit more, and his jaw a little less pointy. He was looking more and more like Lucius by the day.
It was longer, and farther than they had ever gone before.  Harry loved it, but he was getting close to the edge.  “Um, Draco,” he panted, between kisses.
-A/N:  Heating up a bit.  ;)
Harry played with him, slowly slightly like he was getting tired, letting Draco think he was about to catch him, and then turning sharply with a burst of speed. It reminded Harry a bit of his manoeuvres on the Quidditch pitch. He had been quicker there too.
“So, you found the place OK?” Draco said, letting him go to head over to the kitchen.  He opened a bottle of wine with some magical instrument, and poured out a couple glasses of red.
“Let’s go inside,” Draco said, pulling back.
He doubted Ron would be much help here though. Should he seek out some gay or bi men?  Charlie?  Talk it out with them?
Draco’s eyes widened.  “Me neither.”
Within a few minutes, they were both breathing hard.  Harry’s bound hands went to Draco’s jeans, and soon had them undone.
“Do you know this house well?  It belonged to relatives on your mother’s side, right?” Harry asked, pulling Draco down the hall and down the stairs.
There was a frantic minute or two more, full of panting, groans and swearing.  Ending up in a sweaty heap of euphoric exhaustion.
“Sheesh,” Harry groaned, pulling a blob of mud out of his hair.  Shaking his head, he just stood up and walked deeper into the pond.  When he was waist deep, he took a deep breath and dunked below the water, scrubbing the mud off his hair, face and clothes.
This was much better, and they made several variations before heading to the pond.  By then, the sun had come out and it was a very warm spring day.  Launching their boats, most stayed upright and didn’t sink.  They tried to get them to move, waving their hands or the unfolded paper sheets to create some breeze.
They continue down past the ground level that has the kitchen, down into a true basement.  It was noticeably colder and darker, and Draco’s hand tightened on his own.
The closest thing Harry had to a father was Sirius Black, even though it was for far too short a time.  If he hadn’t been killed by Bellatrix, how would he have responded to Harry’s actions?  If Harry told him the full story, would he be OK with Harry’s sexuality?  OK with what he had done to escape?  The thought of Sirius looking at him with disappointed eyes was painful.
The question stopped Harry before he could continue in his rant.  “Oh...um...”. He searched his memory.  Where had he heard the term before?  On deeper consideration, it was likely from overhearing it on a muggle TV news program at the Dursley’s.  It had something to do with treating enemies correctly, didn’t it?
He immediately regretted letting that comment slip out, as he saw the shock on Draco’s face.  “What?  No toys?”  The concept was completely foreign to him.
Harry swallowed hard, clearly feeling uncomfortable. A bit nervous.  “Um, at the castle, what happened... um, between us...”
This was accompanied by resting his hand on Harry’s forearm, a small display of affection their hostess noticed and beamed at.  “You two are so cute together.  How long have you been a couple?”  She placed a large scoop of the eggs on Harry’s plate.
“They will be back soon and find you,” Harry said softly, unable to meet Draco’s accusing eyes again.  He wanted to say more, but what could he say?
“Some things concerned me.  Made me wonder if I was more into this than you were,” Harry confessed, the words coming out in a rush.
Harry shrugged a shoulder.  “I told the truth.  I wanted the trials to be fair, not vindictive.”
‘Stand up,” Draco said, pulling out his wand.
Bellatrix peered at him closely, her dark, beady eyes lingering on the swollen areas disfiguring his face.  Harry almost felt a tinge of hope, but then the snatcher’s grubby hand pushed his hair back from his forehead to show his scar.
He watched as Draco dug heartily into his own plate of food. It was nice to eat with someone, and he wondered if Draco felt it too. He’d been stuck in this castle just as long.
It was a good response, but Harry wanted even more.  He stuck out his tongue, doing long strokes over Draco, savouring his first taste of cock.  It was even better than his frequent fantasies of this moment.  The tip was wet, and Harry swirled his tongue over it.  He opened his mouth, taking it in, sucking for more.
The words sent a surge of excitement through Harry, making him even harder, if that was even possible.  They had hardly made it through the door before they ended up making out on Draco’s sofa.
Ron shrugged.  “Well, feel free to talk about anything.  Ever since Charlie came out to the family a few years ago, I’m used to hearing about things like that.”
Harry wasn’t going to argue with that.  It felt good to have his hands free.  “Fuck.  So there is really no way to get out of here?”
Draco scoffed, looking away, rubbing a hand near his eyes to wipe away some moisture.  “That wasn’t a hard choice.  It was a selfish one.  Putting myself before my family.”’
Laughter mixed with irritation, a feeling he really only had around this cocky git.  But it killed his nerves, and he stepped into the shower like he’d done this other people dozens of times.
“It almost feels like being on a broomstick,” Draco said with a laugh.
Harry was surprised. His favourite. Did Draco know and bring it on this picnic on purpose.
“Goodbye, Draco.”
Draco just glared at him.  Blaise and Goyle had no idea what he was talking about.
“Can’t take you anywhere,” Draco said pulling out his wand.  “Hold them out and I’ll clean them.”
Like with everything else, Draco was competitive, kneeling and hanging on to a bush at the edge of the water in order to extend close to his boats, blowing on their fragile paper sails enthusiastically.
They found a rhythm, slowly getting faster and faster.  Harry rocked up into each thrust, finding the perfect angle, moaning out Draco’s name.  Feeling so connected, so good.  At a certain point, Draco couldn’t hold back, moving faster.  Harry stroked his own cock, lube everywhere, just needed a bit more to get over the edge.
Draco’s eyes heated up, and he pulled out his wand.  A quick spell, and Harry’s wrists were bond tight.
His head was pounding hard enough he got over his instinctive mistrust of Draco and took the bottle.  “Do I drink the whole thing at once?” he asked, already bracing himself for a foul tasting brew.
The candles on Draco’s side were still burning, the almost overwhelming scent of vanilla mixing with the smoke coming off Harry’s extinguished ones.  He closed his eyes tight, trying to steady his breathing, relax, and actually fall asleep.  He was tired, from this whole strange excursion.  But he was too tense to fall asleep, conscious of Draco lying still on the bed beside him.
Harry wasn’t buying it. “Or I could use my wand to clean us.  And
“Says the man who was fighting with me only a few days ago.  Saying no more kinky stuff,” Draco whispered back.  He took a half-step away from Harry, still dancing, but not pressed up together.
“How about June 5th?”
“Here, let me,” Draco said, standing right behind him.  His arms came around Harry, working on the tie with deft fingers.  Harry could only stare at his attractive reflection in the mirror, feel the warmth of his body pressed against him, take in the spicy scent of his cologne.  A wave of feelings for this man almost making him dizzy.
Rolling his eyes, Harry looked over the tray.  A beautiful charcuterie.  Cheeses, crackers, olives, nuts, fruit, salami, pickles.  He picked up a juicy chunk of pineapple, and pushed into Draco’s waiting mouth, deliberately dripping it on his chin on the way.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco gasped, leaning against the bars.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed.  “But you did that spell on me, cleaned me, cleaned my clothes, and then seemed a bit strange afterwards,” he said, watching Draco closely.  “It’s because it’s usually something people do for others after, um, sex, right?”
Draco looked confused. “My magic,” he repeated.
Stepping out of the office, Draco smiled at the wizard at the reception desk and walked out of the building as quickly as he could.  It was hard to control the anger bubbling up beneath his polite facade.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed when he heard Draco return later with his supper.  “Why?  Are you giving me more potion?”
It made sense.  Lucius had the upper hand now.  Harry Potter in a very secure place, ready to bring to Voldemort at the best possible time.  He would use this to his advantage.
Harry couldn’t respond, of course.  He could only watch as Draco covered him with a blanket, tucking it snugly around him, and then leaving the room.
Scoffing, Harry reached over to his jeans to pull out his wand.  “You don’t exactly look like someone who knows how to cook.”
Harry blinked at him, confused.
“Not too tough, I hope,” Draco said, squeezing his hand lightly.
Harry felt a surge of emotions for this man, seeing him waking like that.  He shifted closer, moving in to give Draco a light kiss.  Pulling back a little, wondering if he had gone too far.  If he was taking advantage of the situation.
Harry nodded.  “Very, very OK.”
Harry had fantasized about this so often, he just followed his natural urges, his instincts.  Experimenting with his tongue, his lips, his teeth.  Sucking, licking, kissing.   Listening to Draco, feeling a zing of arousal each time he moaned, doing whatever caused it again and again.
Rolling his eyes, Ron let out a scoff.  “The whole world knows.  Your first dates were covered by all the papers.  But they haven’t reported much for a while.  Is it still going on?”
Despite the pleasant evening together, there was still a tension between them.  Walking on eggshells, being a bit too careful, too reserved, around each other.  And Draco was being far too nice.  It was unnerving.
-A/N:  This is the first thing I’ve posted since the pandemic started, so I’m feeling a bit rusty!  It feels good to be writing again.
Draco arched an eyebrow.  “So, I can just ask you over here for a glass of wine?”
“What?”  Harry’s eyes widened, and his breath catching a bit at that.  Wasn’t that a step backwards?
Harry wasn’t, but used the excuse to move in closer, tucking his face against Draco’s neck.  He smelled so good, felt so good, entangled together.
Harry felt the bed move as Draco jumped out of it, rushing over to his case and yanking out clothes.  He propped himself up in one elbow.  “What’s going on?” he asked sleepily.
But Draco still said nothing, his cold, dead stare speaking for him.
Kissing along his jaw, Harry laughed too, feeling happy.  “That part is incredible too.  But I think that part is easier to get with other people.  This part is just with you.”
A heavily laden tray floated into the room, and Draco guided it to rest beside them.  With another flick, the red wine settled on the nightstand.
“Really?  So, now you have a Tag fetish?” Draco said, smirking.
Draco reached across the table, taking Harry’s hand in his.  “Do you like this?”
“Oh?” Harry said, tipping his face up with a pleasant smile.  “How did it go?”
-A/N:  A better end of the day than the night before.  ;)  Only one chapter more.
Instead of going back to their table, Draco took him to the dance floor.  There were already a few couples there, swaying to the music, and they got no funny looks when joining them.
“Perfect,” Harry said, rolling Draco on to his back.  He did a slow grind against Draco, making them both pant.  Grabbing Draco’s wrists, he pinned them back against the sofa as he gave him a deep, dirty kiss.
Draco chuckled.  “Only a few months, but we met when we were eleven.  We went to the same school.”
It was obvious that Draco wasn’t following the explanations.  They were too muggle-centric.  “Hey, just watch me.  You move your feet in circles on the pedals to move forward, and steer with your hands.”
Maybe Draco saw this last emotion flit over Harry’s face, because he pressed his lips together, stood a bit taller, and walked briskly to him.  “You’ve been avoiding me.”
“It’s an old family castle.  Malfoys lived here before we built the Manor.  It dates back to some of the fiercest wizarding wars and has incredible defences,” Draco drawled, with a proud tilt to his chin that he always got when talking about his pure blood family.  “No one can come snatch you from here, not even house elves.  Only Malfoys can get through the wards, or those they permit.”
Harry had never made out with someone before, but he was pretty sure that was what they were doing.  They shared soft, light kisses, building into harder, deeper ones.  Draco teased him with the tip of his tongue, tracing along his lips, and into his mouth.
He had lost most of his appetite, just contemplating it, and only ate some toast this morning.  All night, strange, disturbing dreams had awoken him, his heart thumping and an overwhelming feeling of dread.  This felt so wrong, in his heart, his gut.  But in his head, his cool, rationale head, he knew it was the only way.
Draco was wearing black jeans that made his legs look endless and his ass amazing, but Harry had only been able to watch, not touch, when he was lying on his back.  Draco crawled over him, looking absolutely delicious, his eyes dark and intense.
Draco gave a bit a strangled chuckle.  “We don’t dock for an hour.”
It reminded Harry of the bounty of foods at Hogwarts feasts, and he felt a pang of longing for those younger, simpler days. When the only thing he had to worry about Draco was if he’d beat him to the snitch in the next quidditch game.
OK, they liked each other.  Had interesting conversations and enjoyed doing things together.  Harry loved Draco’s competitiveness and his intelligence, his sharp tongue and quick wit.
”Yes, yes,” Draco groaned, tucked along Harry’s left side.  His hand cupped over Harry’s, moving with him, as he pressed his lips against the hot skin of his neck.
Eventually, Draco propped himself up on one elbow, and released Harry with a wave of his wand.  He still looked quite pleased with himself, Harry was happy to see.
Again and again, Draco’s face flashed through his mind.  That frozen, hurt expression.  The way his eyes seemed to dim, his posture slump.
“Next time, we will have to make it a contest,” Harry said, rubbing his hands together to get some of the mud off them.
Trying not to smirk, Harry gave him a half smile.  “OK, OK.  How about tea?”
Harry’s heart was thumping by the time the door locked behind them.  Shut in their own private room.  He kissed Draco, just needing him.  Draco returned the kiss, just as eagerly.  They stripped, helping each other, working their own clothes off, between heated kisses.
This felt so right, so natural.  Kissing, touching.  Being naked together in the large bed.  Nothing held back.  The lube came in handy rather quickly, sliding against each other in a way that quickly spiralled out of control.  It had been too long since they’d been together to go slow.
“Why don’t you use the bathroom first?” Draco said, opening his suitcase, and pulling out some light blue pyjamas.
This was it.  The moment Draco could finally stop their... rivalry, if that’s what you would call it.  A few words, and Draco could have payback for all the trouble Harry had gotten him into.  Being turned into a ferret by Mad Eye Moody, besting him at Quidditch.  The horrible spell in that bathroom fight that had almost killed him.
The server came by just then with their main course, and Draco released his hand, leaning back to give her room to set down the hot plates.  Harry dug in eagerly,  savouring the tender chicken, mushrooms cooked in red wine and herbs, and creamy potatoes.  A rich chocolate cake with raspberry sauce finished off the meal.
“I don’t think I’ve ever felt this happy,” Harry said.  Hoping it wasn’t too much.
“Well, I think that is all the questions I have for you, Mr. Malfoy,” the witch said as she stood up, holding out her hand.
Harry did his best, trying to stay still, relaxed, as Draco kissed up his inner thigh.  He widened his legs, giving him better access.
This could be something.  Draco already seemed to be letting down his guard around Harry, acting more like friends.  What if Harry tried for more?  Could he get Draco’s trust?  Get him to care for Harry?  Convince him to let him go, or just get him to relax enough inside the castle so Harry could grab a wand?
“Fuck,” Draco panted, moving away to lie on his back.  He pulled out his wand and released Harry’s bonds, and then did a quick scorgify spell over both of them when Harry shifted to lie beside him.
Before he got distracted, Harry did the same for Draco, watching his expression as he touched his cock for the first time.  Nothing in the way.  Loved it when Draco moaned, his hips arching upwards.
Draco shrugged.  “There were times I wished I could have been left alone like that.  My parents were always watching me, training me how to behave, sending me to lessons.”
Draco sighed.  “I’ll tell you on our tenth wedding anniversary, OK?  If we both live long enough to see that day.”
Draco looked a bit uncomfortable.  “Um, well, yeah, Potter.  For adults, anyway, it is something only done in, um, intimate situations.”  He cleared his throat, looking away.  “Parents do it with little kids often, of course.  A sign of parental love, caring.”
Draco murmured the simple spell, and Harry felt that surge of power along his skin, seeming even more intense this time.  He gasped, closing his eyes tight, the sensation seeming to zing right through his body.
Suddenly Harry wasn’t minding that Draco had been talking about them.
Without even knowing what he was doing, Harry took a step closer.  Draco opened his eyes, a flash of confusion in them at seeing him standing so close.  But then they flicked downwards, to Harry’s mouth, and he took it as an invitation.
Maybe it was just being together a longer while?  Being adults with busier schedules?  Maybe sex would be like this sometimes, a bit more rushed or one-sided, just due to lack of time.
“Or...?” Harry asked, unimpressed with that option. It was only mid afternoon, and he didn’t relish the thought of being stuck back in the dark cell.
Draco smoothed his palm over Harry’s, spreading the lube, warming it.  “Yes, lots for me, lots for you.”
Seeing him spread out, naked, against the dark grey bedsheets, made Harry pause and blink.  “Fuck, you are so gorgeous,” he murmured before leaning down to kiss Draco.
When he opened his eyes, Draco was still close, his grey eyes warm.  He waved his wand, saying a soft spell, and Harry felt the tingle of his magic again.  The bonds were still there, but a bit looser.  He could breathe easier, and open his mouth.
Draco took a big bite, his eyes closing and letting out a pleased him.  “Delicious.”
Lucius clasped the back of Draco’s neck with a large paternal hand, looming over his shoulder to peer at his only offspring.  “Draco, look closely, son,” he implored.  “If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven.  All would be as it was, you understand?”
Wrapping his hands around the warm mug of tea, Harry sipped it as he watched Draco go.  Could he really do this?  This half-formed plan?
Harry swung his face around a little too fast, and grimaced in pain.  Eventually he opened his eyes to peer through the gloom.
Grabbing the bottle of wine, Harry took a swig as he watched Draco walk naked out of the bedroom.  Was he ready for this?  He took another glug of the wine to help settle his nerves, and followed him.
Draco had picked him up after work on Friday, barely letting him go home to change and grab the bag he has packed, before aparating them far away.  He had kept the details a surprise, and Harry felt excited anticipation to see what the weekend would hold.  Brave new territory for both of them.
For all the times they had been in each other’s beds, they had never slept the night together.  Harry had never done it with anyone.  And to do it like this, fully dressed in pyjamas, not even touching the other person, was not how he had ever imagined it.
-I have finished the drafts of the rest of the chapters.  There are eight chapters total, around 16K words.
The words and the warm breath against his ear, plus Draco so close, had Harry very aware of how long it had been since they had been naked together.  How good it was.  “What else do you think about?”
The shower was still going.  “Um, OK, Draco.  I guess I’ll just let myself out then.”  It felt a bit awkward, speaking loudly through the bathroom door.
Harry shrugged.  “How do they treat you?”
Draco nodded, mulling it all over.  “So, I got it all wrong.”
“What?” Harry prompted.
But then Draco pulled back the covers on his side.  “Well, we better get our showers done fast.  Mrs. Owens only serves breakfast for another hour or so, and I booked us on a walking tour afterwards.”  With that, he was out of bed, and closing the bathroom door behind him.
Harry played out scenarios in his head, and nothing seemed feasible. Draco had the upper hand, and would get to his wand before Harry could. Plus, he had the house elves, however many, at his command as well.
-This is kind of slow paced, sexy fluff, isn’t it?  Lol.  Both guys are just figuring things out.
Laying back in the bed, Harry went under the blanket again.  Was Draco doing the same thing?  Whacking off?  What was he thinking about?  Who?  Was there someone in Slytherin he liked?  He couldn’t recall Draco with any particular girl at Hogwarts.  Or was there a certain guy?
Draco was getting so comfortable around Harry he almost forgot to bind Harry’s wrists before entering the castle.  Harry held his breath as Draco opened the door, ready to follow him in.  Draco stopped so suddenly Harry almost ran into his back.
After months of camping with Hermione and Ron, it was wonderful to have well prepared food.  French toast, bacon, maple syrup and juicy oranges.  It all vanished, almost by magic, and he was soon sipping his tea, hands wrapped tight around the warm mug.
Returning the kiss, Harry let his hand slide down Draco’s bare back, stopping at the towel tucked around his waist.  “I’m not saying I didn’t like how tonight went.  I’m just saying you don’t need to do elaborate schemes.”
-I’m considering writing a sequel, following as Draco & Harry date and fumble to figure things out.  Let me know if you’d be interested.  :)
“Are you just going to keep me down here?  Alone, in the dark?  It’s inhumane!  It’s against the Geneva Convention!” Harry grabbed the full lunch tray and set it on his bed.  He didn’t want Draco to have the chance to snatch it back.
“Well, no need to get lunch,” Harry said, standing up from the table.  Between this foodie tour and the big breakfast at their lodging, Harry was stuffed.  Delicious food, but he needed to move around a bit.
“Let’s get it off you now,” Draco said, and waved Harry forward.
He would have made them deeper but the spell seemed to restrict that.
“Hot,” Draco said, stepping closer and giving Harry a light kiss.  A test.  When Harry didn’t move away, a tight hug came next, and a kiss by Harry’s ear.  “Just seeing you like that. I think about it when we aren’t together.”
Harry wasn’t one who hid away from things though.  He straightened up, squared his shoulders, and took a deep breath before he opened the bathroom door.
“Oh really?  Tell me more,” Harry purred, cuddling closer.
Harry splayed them out, and felt the slight tingle of Draco’s spell dance over his skin.  His breath caught, and he closed his eyes for a second.  When he opened them, Draco was waving his wand over himself, cleaning off his own hands and some mud splatters on his clothes with a tsk.
Harry shook his head, panting.  “No, we can’t.  We should go out, like for a nice dinner.”
Harry swallowed hard.  “Things were going good, dating, getting more comfortable with each other,” Harry said, waving a hand in the air as he fumbled for the words.  This was completely new and strange to him.  Awkward as hell.
But under one hand, he felt something hard.  Draco’s wand, tucked up his sleeve like most witches and wizards did.  Harry didn’t let himself think for even a second.
“Clean it up, Potter,” Draco said, chewing the fruit.
But through all that, he saw Harry coming towards him, his sharp eyes finding him and holding him.  He stuck him arms out, getting ready to grab hold of anything.
Harry was stopped nearby, one foot on the ground to keep upright.  He tried not to laugh at Draco’s unsteady progress, but was glad that everyone was distracted, watching Draco and trying to keep him from falling over.  He slipped his wand down from his sleeve slightly, and did a quick wave with a soft spell.  It straightened Draco up, helping him balance better, and Harry could immediately see him grasping how to pedal and steer.
Draco chuckled lightly, no doubt noticing that Harry’s voice had been a bit rough.  He gently bit Harry’s earlobe, flicking his tongue over the trapped skin.  Savouring Harry’s gasp.  “Hmmmm.... gags, ropes, paddles, whips.  All sorts of naughty things.  Would you let me try them on you?”
Draco stood up, walked a few steps and paused, facing away.  “No, of course not.  I swore the house elves to secrecy and just told him you got away.  He was furious.”
It was late afternoon by the time they got back to their room.  Harry went into the washroom, using the facilities and then splashing his face with water and drying it off.
A strand of his white blond hair fell forward, almost into his eyes, and the spring sunlight made it almost glow against his pale skin. His skin had a bit more colour in it from these past few days, from sitting outside together here, than he’d had back at the Manor.
“Pick a restaurant you want to try.  Owl me the time and date,” Harry said, pushing Draco out the door before he gave into temptation and took him up to his bedroom.
Draco rolled his eyes, and paced around the room.  “No!  Things are going great!  We are dating publicly, and no one seems to really care.  We are getting along great, having fun.  And suddenly it’s lame excuse after excuse from you.”
“The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, asks for a favour, and she is just delighted to overlook my shady past?” Draco sneered, running his hands through his hair, leaving it in complete disarray.
Ron and Hermione tossed him a basilisk fang, and Harry stabbed it into the diadem.  They tossed it back into the burning Room of Requirement, hearing the screams from that part of Voldemort’s soul scream as it died.
There were iron bars, and beyond that a figure wearing a dark grey cloak, a thick hood pulled up over his head, shadowing his face.  A pale hand pushed the hood back, revealing Draco.
It was a bit of a barb.  Harry had used the excuse of working nights to avoid seeing Draco too much, obviously.  “Well, I’m glad you have settled into the job.  Made some friends.”
If he knocked Draco out, there was no way for Harry to escape. He couldn’t enter the house, that it was warded to only let Malfoy’s to enter, and the others that they allowed. Could he tie Draco up, and force him to enter the castle? Force him to tell him where the wands were?
Even if he hadn’t, Draco had to admit his own failure to his father.  A son, just barely an adult, wanting to prove himself.  Given this big responsibility.  Maybe he had even asked his father for it.  Harry thought back to overhearing Draco talking to Snape when he had been ejected from Slughorn’s Christmas party in their sixth year at Hogwarts.  Saying he had been chosen.  That this was his chance.  Had he said similar things to his father?
They went outside afterwards, the sky fully dark and the lights of the city reflecting on the water.  The fresh air helped clear his head, a bit fuzzy from several glasses of wine.
“Hold on,” Draco panted, moving off Harry to reach into the bedside table, pulling out some lube.  “Is this OK?”
“‘Come over for some wine,’ now means...”
Harry turned, leaning against the wall, feeling awful at the expression on Draco’s face.  They had come too far, done too much, for Harry to ghost him now.  Leave without talking.  Maybe whatever was happening would be the end to this fragile thing they had started, too much for what they had built up.  It couldn’t withstand much of a storm.
Draco turned his head to look at Harry, his grey eyes seeming enormous in his pale face, shiny with unshed tears.  “I want to... but I can’t.”
Bellatrix’s lips twisted into a smirk.  “Get Draco,” she commanded, likely to a house elf or some other servant nearby.
Chuckling at his expression, Draco gave him a lazy smile.  “What?”
He had to decline sharply to get through the doorway, and the weight shift made them lose their balance, crashing to the stone floor in a pile, the broomstick skittering away.  Stunned and breathless, Harry tried to grab hold of Draco.
They went back inside, Harry leading the way, and Draco behind him.  He waved the wand at the door and it opened for them, magically locked, obviously.
Harry let out a breath, and gave Draco’s hand a squeeze.  “I think we both deserve to have it be special.  Let’s take it slow.  Date.”
Harry awoke, groggy, head pounding.  With a shaking hand, he ran it over his face.  His features were back to normal, the effects of the stinging jinx worn off.
He was tackled a moment later, Draco getting him flat in his back and kissing him until he was almost passing out from lack of breath.  “I love you too, you idiot.” Draco said, pinning Harry down and grinning at him widely, before kissing him senseless again.
But then he shifted.  Away.
“Oh, I, um...,” Harry said, noticing that Draco was watching him closely for his reaction.  “This looks quite comfortable.”
It seemed like a blink of the eye and Draco was over him, straddling his hips, his wand in his hand.  “Put your hands up over your head, near the headboard,” he instructed, eyes already growing heated.
Harry was almost up against the bars now, just wanting Draco to be able to see his face, his eyes, and to know he was sincerely sorry.  “I want to say sorry for what happened earlier.  I read the signals wrong.  I’m an idiot.  I never should have-“
“Having fun.  Was that what we were doing?” Harry shot back, anger flaring inside him too.
Leaning in, their noses bumped and Harry turned his face a bit.  Their lips connected, and his hand went into Draco’s wet hair, holding him there as the kiss deepened.  Harry liked feeling his magic on his skin, but Draco’s lips were even more intense.  He just wanted more, more.
“I can’t be sure,” Draco said finally.
But Draco looked completely uncomfortable.  His legs were splayed out on each side of the bicycle, bearing most of his weight, instead of sitting fully on the bike seat.  His arms were straight, leaning back so his hands barely touched the handle bars.  A guy from the store was patiently trying to explain how the bicycle worked to him.  Harry had told him that Draco had never learned how to ride one.
“I sent them to the store.  Told them to come back in two hours,” Draco said, his leg slotting in between Harry’s.
“Fuck,” Harry gasped, as he felt Draco bite into the tender skin below his ear.  It hurt, yes, but it also made his breathing quicken and he arched slightly off the bed.
“Potter...,” Draco groaned, sounded annoyed now, and putting a hand on his shoulder.
Harry closed his eyes, excitement curling through him, as Draco’s face drew nearer.  He wanted this so badly.  He could feel the warm breaths against his mouth.  Draco was so close.
Too aroused to argue, Harry did as bid.  The binding around his wrists attached to the headboard, but weren’t that taunt.  Draco kept kissing Harry, and they were soon lost in it, often taking short breaks to cool down.
That got him a long look, Draco wondering if Harry meant it.  Evidently his act was good enough.  “Put your hands through the bars.”
Harry thought back on their years together at Hogwarts, and the times he had seen Draco with his parents.  They both saw him off on the Hogwarts Express, with hugs and fond looks.  Draco often received generous care packages at breakfast by owl, sharing the treats with his friends.  His father was always at the Quidditch games, his head at a proud tilt as he watched his son and the whole Slytherin team whiz around the field on the brooms he had bought.  Draco worked hard on the Quidditch pitch, and in his classes, top of the class.  Except for Hermione, of course.  A fact they all loved.
Draco stood, walking over to Harry, looking a bit uncomfortable now.  Had Harry said too much?
Looking downwards, Draco seemed to be searching for the right words.  “Um, I think some things got mixed together.  Being around each other, getting to like each other more, but still having to bind you every day.”
Draco tutted at the wine dotted all over both of them.  “Can’t take you anywhere,” he murmured, and grabbed Harry’s hand, yanking him into the bathroom.  “We better let these soak in some cold water right away.”
“Oh.”
Wrapping his long legs around Harry, Draco reached for the lube, flipping the cap and pouring a generous amount in his palm.  “Give me your hand,” he said, his voice rough.
Shaking his head, Harry was again impressed by how far Draco had come.  From sneering at ‘mudbloods’ to working under one.  And seeming to really like and respect her.
Draco gave a small smile in return.  “I like it more than I thought I would, frankly.  Olivia is a no-nonsense, direct sort of boss.  She tells me when I fuck up, when a potion isn’t up to her standards.  Makes me redo it until I get it right.  I’ve learned a lot with her.”
In the end, he could get away, save himself, help others.  Hopefully kill Voldemort.  Draco’s feelings may be hurt, his pride stung, but those were things he would recover from.  There was no doubt he had to do this.
Draco’s eyebrows raised a bit at that, but then he nodded, looking pleased.  “Something spicy?”
What was the alternative?  At any moment, Lucius could take him to Voldemort, and this slim opportunity would be gone.  All was fair in love and war, right?
Harry kept him at a slow pace, not wanting him to get hurt and ending up in a muggle hospital.  But as they travelling away into less crowded areas, they were able to pick up speed.  Harry loved the expression of wonder on Draco’s face the first time he coasted down a small dip in the path.
But he had never expected anything like this.  He was able to dismiss the first few signs, but eventually he clued in.  Draco, being just a bit too nice, carrying his suitcase for him, opening doors.  A kiss of the cheek in greeting, and a big smile.  Cuddling together in the back of a black cab as they travelled through muggle London.
“But I do look like someone who can order delicious food from a deli, right?” Draco said, sitting up and plucking the wand from Harry’s hand.
“Shower!  Now!” Draco almost shouted, looking stressed.
Draco gave him a small, satisfied smirk, peering up through his messy hair.  “It didn’t take much, did it?”
“Wake up, lazy bones,” a soft voice near him cajoled. Harry opened his eyes to find that Draco was awake now, leaning on one elbow as he peered down at Harry.
Harry walked around the Room of Requirement, the buzzing hiss of the horcrux in his ears, in his scar.  He could feel that it was close.
Grinning, Harry shook his head again.  “Well, no, but before we, um...”
He scrambled to his feet, pure adrenaline helping him, and ran along the imposing hedge.  It was thick and full of thorns.  Despite this, he tried to push through it, only to be zapped back again and again.  Undaunted, he kept trying, running along the hedge and trying again and again.  Searching for the tiniest gap in the defences.  Eventually, panting and exhausted, he dropped back on the bench.
They gathered around Dobby; Griphook, Hermione, Ron and Harry, ready to apparate far away.  Bellatrix howled in fury, and threw her dagger.
“Um,” Harry said, trying to find the right words, “can I ask you something?”
“Draco, please, please,” Harry said softly, standing up from the bed and walking slowly towards him.  “Can we talk?”
The next morning, he apparated a few different places before going to Shell Cottage.
Draco returned his smile easily, obviously pleased at his accomplishment.  But within a second, he pulled back the emotions, his face neutral again.  “Yes, well, thank you for the high level amusement, Potter.  I think it is time to head back inside.”
“Fuck, that sounds boring,” Draco’s voice broke through his rambling answer, and Harry’s eyes snapped to his in surprise.  There was a bit of a teasing glint in them that made Harry relax again.
Harry walked slowly, feigning weakness again, trying to look around as unobtrusively as he could.  Draco occasionally prodded him with his wand to keep him moving along.  He headed down the stairs back to the dungeon, and felt a sudden wave of dizziness.  His bound hands scrambled to steady himself against the wall, but it was Draco’s firm grip on his shoulder that stopped him from pitching down the stairs.  Without a word, he moved to Harry’s side, an arm slung along his lower back, the stairway luckily wide enough to allow them to continue that way to the bottom.  Draco released him and stepped away, his eyes watchful for signs Harry was still unsteady.
The morning seemed to drag.  After eating, Harry tried to nap but did not feel that sleepy.  He explored the cell, feeling over the walls and the iron bars.  It was solid and surprisingly clean.  Had the house elves been down here before he arrived, cleaning it for Harry’s arrival?
Draco shook his head, crawling off the bed.  “I think I like your earlier suggestion of a shower.”
It was a bit strange, feeling Draco smooth the shampoo over his hair and working it in.  His touch was tentative at first, but he soon realized he needed to be firmer, push his hands through the thick, wet hair to get down to Harry’s scalp.  Soon, Harry was practically moaning as Draco did small massaging circles with the pads of his fingers.
Harry laid in the bed, feeling a bit stunned, as he heard the shower start up.   Eventually he sat on the edge of the bed, pulling his clothes back on.  He stood, rolling his shoulders, feeling a bit achy from the bonds.
“No friends, no toys.  What did you do?”
Harry chuckled.  “You still don’t know much about muggles, do you?  I’m a bit surprised you booked all this stuff this weekend in the muggle parts of London.”
In that instant, Harry’s arm was yanked hard, away from Dobby’s touch, and he fell.  His head cracked hard against the stone floor, and the world went black.
“This really means something to you,” Draco said softly, seated on the other end of the bench.
Luckily, they came across some Quidditch brooms and started flying out of the room.  Harry heard a scream, and saw Goyle falling from a high stack of furniture into the fire.  It was awful.
Harry’s welcoming smile dimmed, and he quickly glanced around.  He looked as guilty as four year sitting beside an empty cookie jar.  Covered in cookie crumbs.  “Um, is Grimmald Place OK?”
Draco scoffed, and took a sip of his wine.  “Why would we?”
They both got busy finding the right rocks, a bit of competitive spark already forming.  Pretty soon, they both had a small pile.  Harry showed Draco how to stand at a slight angle to the pond, and do a sidearm pitch with a flick of the wrist at the end.  Many rocks disappeared with a big splash with no skipping, but Draco clenched his jaw and threw rock after rock.  He watched Harry throwing his, modifying his technique, getting better.
Looking pleased but also irritated somehow, Draco let himself be led.  “What the fuck are you up to, Potter?”
Draco backed off, soon disappearing into the darkness.  Harry could hear him walking up stone stairs and a large heavy door slamming shut.
Harry’s heart continued to thump.  He was sure he saw a flicker of recognition in Draco’s eyes when he had first seen Harry.  Why all this prevarication?  Was the stinging jinx Hermione had done so strong?  He could hardly open one eye and most of his face felt stiff and puffy.
He took in Draco’s surprised expression before he turned and sprinted across the wide lawn. But in only a few seconds, Draco was on his feet and narrowing the distance between them.
“Oh really?” Harry said, feeling a bit amused, but also irritated.  It was their private business, after all.
Harry closed his eyes, the feel of Draco’s magic on his skin affecting him even more strongly after not seeing him for so long.  He was already breathing faster, already aroused.
Standing up, Harry rolled his shoulders.  He had no idea how long they had been up here, but he knew he’d have to do some stretches later, maybe even soak in a hot bath.  So worth it.
Draco’s expression had turned to hard fury.  Deep hatred.  His eyes seemed to glow with it.
“What stuff?”
Watching Draco’s hand tracing over his cock was so erotic Harry arched his hips off the bed.  He wouldn’t last much longer, and he desperately wanted to be naked.  To see Draco naked.
At the door, there was an uncomfortable moment.  Harry wanted to kiss Draco goodbye, but was afraid he’d pull away.  Despite what they’d been doing half the night, Draco could be skittish when Harry initiated things.
“But we’ll keep the jail cells,” Draco murmured, kissing Harry’s neck and nuzzling closer.
“With that type of wine?  Hardly.” Draco said, shutting off the tap and tugging Harry along. “Let’s find some clean shirts.”
Harry sighed, closing his eyes.  “This is completely my fault.  I thought if we dated a bit, took things slow...”
Draco’s eyes seemed to go a bit unfocused at that, and his lips parted.
It was mid-afternoon and a mild fall day.  They had just finished a foodie walking tour of Borough Market, sampling British classics like fish and chips, sausage rolls and creamy cheeses, all paired with alcoholic drinks like beer, cider and mead.  Their guide had been knowledgeable, and the half dozen other participants had debated over which foods were the best.  Harry had got caught up in it, mentioning a few markets he had gone to in the past.
That made Harry turn away too, looking at the ceiling but his thoughts far away.  He luckily had no memories from his baby or toddler years, with the first thing he could remember was a lime green ball Dudley had been playing with in the garden.  He had been called inside and Harry had a few blissful minutes playing with it before it was snatched away.  He had no memories of his aunt using a cloth to wipe his face or hands if he was a messy toddler, and certainly none of his actual parents using a scorgify spell on him as a baby.  It all made him feel a bit sad.
“Let me go.  Give me a fighting chance.  Already it is one of the most powerful wizards in the world against me, a drop-out who is barely seventeen,” Harry continued.  “Please, Draco.”
“I liked the bike riding,” Draco confessed.
Harry walked down the twisty side street and found a door with the right number on it.  There was a bell pull on the side, and Harry gave it a small yank.
“That’s a lot of lube,” Harry said, holding out his hand.
He awoke, feeling warm and lazy. The sun was bright but not strong enough to burn. It was only March, and sunny days were rare in England this time of year.
“I want you, right now,” Harry whispered in his ear.
“Lay it flat along the side of your thumb, and then press your other thumb along the other side,” Harry explained as he slowly demonstrated. He cupped his hands together, keeping lots of space between his palms, and raised them to his mouth. He blew steadily into the tiny space between his thumbs, wiggling his hands to make small adjustments, until suddenly a screechy whistle noise pierced the air.
Was there kindness deep inside Draco?  Despite being raised by Deatheaters?
Harry watched as Draco squirmed a bit.  “I think you were just playing with me, didn’t really mean anything by it.  But you said something about how I was being kinky, that I liked tying you up.”
Harry’s mind was a blank for a few seconds.
Rolling his eyes, Draco squirmed a bit under the close scrutiny.  “I was upset... after we had that fight.  It felt like I was screwing everything up and I had no idea how to fix it.”
“The day you came to the Manor,” Draco eventually supplied.
He reached downwards, the only warning Harry got before that warm, slick hand was wrapped around his erection.  It felt amazing.  Perfect.  But even better when he started moving it.
“By the end of the night, they were all telling me how to fix things.  They suggested this place and a whole bunch of other things,” Draco finished, still looking embarrassed.
These weeks of dating had been good.  They had weathered the storm of paparazzi, but after the novelty wore off, they weren’t in the paper that much.  After the trials, the wizarding world really seemed to want to move on.  Harry was happy to be out of the public light more than he had been for the past ten years.
A few minutes later and they were cleaned up and falling asleep.
Harry groaned in frustration.
Rolling on his back, Harry stared up at the clouds. It was relaxing, in a way, being in this quiet place, not having to move from place to place every few days.
If Harry had to face Voldemort, he wanted it to be at least a fair fight. With friends and allies nearby, supporting him. With a good wand in his hand. All this year, Harry had been mentally preparing himself for that face off. Knew there was a good chance he could die.
“Well, well,” Draco said, coming around a pile of furniture with Goyle and Blaise, all with their wands drawn. “What brings you here, Potter?”
With a sigh, Harry moved over to the sofa and sat down.  “I guess we can have some later.  Something on your mind, Malfoy?”
-Yes, Harry is being a bit of an idiot here.  But he’s young & not that experienced with relationships...  Here’s hoping he smartens up.
Suddenly there was a flurry of motion.  Harry realized that Bellatrix was attacking the snatchers for some reason.  It was over in a flash, with her ordering Wormtail to put the boys in the cellar.
“Thanks,” Harry said, and meant it.  Although strangers had sometimes shouted unkind things at him, his friends and co-workers had seemed unfazed when articles about dating Draco had first appeared.  It relieved him of the need to come out more directly with them, in a way.  It wasn’t treated as a big deal by most people.
Harry closed his eyes as the magic swept over his bare skin like a lovers hand, leaving tingling sensitivity behind.  He opened his eyes to watch Draco clean himself, his hair even smoothing into its normal style.
Draco was sitting on the edge of the bed, but he stood up as Harry came forward.  “I’ll just be a minute.  Get comfy,” he said softly, kissing Harry on the cheek and darting into the bathroom.
“No more for me, I’m stuffed,” Draco replied with a smile that seemed too large for his face.  “But give some to Harry.  His appetite is bigger than mine.”
Draco broke off the kiss, panting, but not moving away.  Harry’s hands went under his jumper, touching the warm, bare skin near his waistband.  Draco let out a small moan that went right through Harry, and went back to kissing him, his tongue pushing into his mouth.
It was almost a relief to have the cell door swing closed behind him, and to feel the tingle of Draco’s magic across his skin when the wrist bindings disappeared.  Harry went to his bed, lying on his side turned away from Draco, and only heard him walking away.  Leaving him alone.
“Taken you to the flashiest restaurants, got you a bit drunk, flirted with you shamelessly,” Harry drawled, trying to lighten the mood.
“Is this really necessary?  You have a wand, after all,” Harry grumbled lightly, but followed the orders.  As Draco said the words of the spell and waved his wand, Harry felt his magic on his skin, sending a tingle up his arms.  “Or maybe you just have a thing for tying me up?”
“Geneva Convention?  What are you talking about?”
“Would we be here, together, if it wasn’t for that time together at that drafty old castle?” Draco said, waving a hand in the air for emphasis.
Harry slept very soundly that night, not waking until Draco was shoving his breakfast tray below the door.  He had taken the last of the headache potion, knowing he needed his rest.  He needed to be stronger, be able to escape if he saw an opportunity.  Draco had a fairly secure system going, but he couldn’t be on guard every second.  And the more Harry could do to assist that the better.
“It has about three doses.  It should last the rest of today.  I can give you another bottle tomorrow if you need it.”
Draco nodded, and pulled back.  “I hope you don’t mind, but I think I’ll jump in the shower now.  I have an early start tomorrow for work.”  He rolled off the bed and was heading to the en suite before Harry had a chance to respond.
He had used that name several times during this trip, but this was the first time it had seemed natural.  It hit Harry hard, and he moved closer.
Goyle shifted beside him, not liking the lack of action.  “Come on, Draco.  Don’t be a prat. Do him.”
Harry felt a bit stunned as they set down their luggage in their room.  It was a fair sized bedroom, with its own en suite and a large bed.  What really struck him was the decor.  It looked like a floral garden had exploded on everything.  The wallpaper and drapes had a matching pattern of large roses.  The bed quilt was a patchwork of floral prints in many pastel shades.  There seemed to be at least twenty pillows on the bed, carefully arranged, each embroidered with a single bloom.
Draco still had a mixture of emotions showing on his face.  Anger, resistance, doubt.  But his eyes did flick downwards.  Was he remembering those kisses?  Did he think about them as often as Harry did?
Was this what it felt to be an old, married couple?  Being together, but not really?  Didn’t sex drop off as people got over the honeymoon phase?  The novelty of it wore off?  It certainly hadn’t for him.
Sighing, Harry took a few steps forward.  “I’m a bit confused.  That’s why I’ve needed some space.”
It was a long night, with his thoughts keeping him up instead of the pain.  He was in some remote castle with strong defences, so he doubted the Order of the Phoenix members or Dobby would be able to either locate him or get him out.  He was wandless, defenceless and alone.
“You look great.  Let’s go,” Draco said, stepping back and grabbing Harry’s hand, rushing him out of the room and down the stairs.  Mrs. Owens waved to them as they passed her in the main floor.  Harry could see her ‘Awww, aren’t they a cute couple’ expression, and felt a stab of unease.
This kiss wasn’t soft.  It was intense and deep, and Harry could only sink into it with a pleased hum.  He had been craving a kiss like this for weeks.  Nothing held back.  Draco pushed his tongue past his lips, teasing and playing, and Harry could feel his body responding.
“So, you are stuck here too, just as bored as I am,” Harry chuckled dryly, liking that.  Misery loves company.
“The sex was good,” Harry said, unable to deny it.  Even now, he could feel a strong pull of attraction, seeing Draco like this, being in the flat where they’d had sex so many times.  He turned away, moving to the window.  Trying to slow his breathing and think more clearly.  If they were going to talk this out, he needed to bring up what was bothering him.
Harry’s heart beat faster.  Was this it?  Draco setting him free?  Acting like the doors were left unlocked somehow?  Not taking too active a part in his escape?
Draco was sitting with his head clutched in his hands, white blond hair messed up.  His chest was heaving, like he was breathing hard or...
Harry desperately wanted to look away.  Sink to his knees, beg Draco for forgiveness.  Kiss him, hug him, make sure he was OK.  But his duty came first.  Before everyone and everything.
That did ring a bell.  “But surely I should be allowed outside for fresh air?  Exercise?”
The shower was maybe a bit too hot, but Harry didn’t care.  He had been shaking, feeling a bit cold, when he had floo’d home.  And if his face was a bit wet, it was just from the shower, right?
Opening his eyes, Draco peered down intently at Harry, his expression hard to read.  It wasn’t that bright down here, Harry’s wandlight putting half his face in shadow.  He moved around the bars, urging Harry to stand, backing him up until he fell.
Draco jumped slightly at his touch, his breath catching, but after a moment he seemed to calm down.  He turned towards Harry, his eyes downcast.
“Sorry about that,” a voice said nearby.
Harry grabbed his hand and squeezed it.  “It’s incredible.  Looks delicious,” he said, but his eyes were going down to Draco’s lips again.
“No,” Harry snapped, and had to calm down a surge of emotions from the memories.  “My cousin was a bully, so other kids stayed away from me.  Didn’t want to make him mad.”
-A/N:  Slowly building some trust....
Draco stood beside him, taking it all in.  Harry had been busy down here, moving the clutter away, cleaning it thoroughly.  Along the one wall, there were three jail cells.  One had an open door.
-A/N:  Thanks for reading this story so far.  I’m still feeling a bit rusty writing after not being able to for most of the pandemic.
“Decency?” Harry shot back, a bit of anger creeping in now.  “I could hardly live with myself if we left anyone to die in that fire.”
Lifting his arms, Draco rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders.  “Yes,” he said, and shoved Harry back on to the bed.
“I didn’t fake it, Draco,” Harry said softly, their lips barely parted.  “I wanted you.”
Harry tried his best to look innocent, but knew his face was giving him away.  “OK, fine, I vouched for you with Olivia Redd.  But you would be great in that job.”
Harry sat up straighter at the question. “Um, yes.  I think I can manage.”  He wanted to sound strong enough to do this, but not seem like a threat.
Harry picked one up, holding it towards Draco.  But Draco just gave him a funny look.
“Are you feeling better?”
“Good,” Draco said, stopping right in front of Harry to glare down at him.  “Far too good.  Suspiciously good.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Draco pulling on a suit jacket, and knew he’d need to step it up a little.  He pulled out a paisley printed tie, and fumbled with it in the mirror.  Swearing softly to himself as the knot came out lumpy.
Draco fluffed up the pillows, reclining like a king against them.  “Shut up, and feed me.”
Tonight, they had crossed some kind of threshold.  Crossed some line.  There was a new comfort between them now that had come with being naked together, being so open and intimate.  Harry had never felt like this before with anyone.
Harry ate the spicy stew, liking the level of heat.  Draco’s face flushed a bit, but he seemed to like the zing.   Having kheer for dessert as good, the Indian-style rice pudding cooling the heat the lingered in their mouths.
“Many people?  How many?”
Luckily, the door let him exit the castle, much to his relief.  Now for the final step.
Surprisingly, Draco seemed to agree as he followed Harry as he strolled over to the pond.  They searched for rocks and worked on their technique.  Harry gave Draco occasional tips but mostly left him to figure it out on his own.  Pretty soon, he was skipping them pretty well.  Damn git.
Draco pushed him, hard, and Harry fell on to the sofa.  Immediately, Draco crawled over him, holding him down and kissing him intensely.  Harry could hardly catch his breath, but he didn’t really care.  This would be a good way to die.
Were they going to have sex?  This whole day had been such a diversion from how they normally were, Harry had no idea.  Draco, sending him warm looks and calling him Harry, acting so couple-ish around Mrs. Owens and at the restaurant.  But any touches had been fleeting, a quick squeeze of Harry’s hand or a guiding arm along his back as they entered a room.  Nothing signalling Draco wanted more.  No lingering looks, no heat in his eyes.
Draco turned his head to meet Harry’s gaze.  “I think, back at the castle....”
He awoke from a light nap to a strange sound.  The cell door unlocked and swung open, but Draco wasn’t there.
But Draco’s eyes warmed, a smile curving the corner of his mouth before he leaned into Harry, kissing him back hard.  Harry gathered him in his arms, holding him tight, kissing, lost in the feel of him.  Of this.
Jeans and socks came off next, leaving them in just their underwear.  Harry couldn’t stop running his hands over Draco, loving his pale, smooth skin.  He had light body hair on his legs and other places.  Draco seemed to like Harry’s body, a bit shorter, but a sturdy, more muscular build.
“I must have missed that in my desperate attempt at escape,” Harry drawled back.  Anything to keep Draco talking, to stay outside, and maybe get an way to escape.  “Can you show me?”
“It’s your fiancé’s birthday?” Draco replied, raising one eyebrow.
-A/N: Boys being a bit naughty...
Suddenly realizing how long he had been lost in his thoughts, Harry scrambled to think of a reply.  “Um, I was outside as much as possible.  I learned how to avoid my cousin, to avoid being noticed.  I would watch other kids playing, exploring, watching nature-“
Draco sat back, crossing his arms over his chest.  “I don’t need your pity.”
Harry tied the message to the bird’s leg, feeling a thrill of excitement as it went back through the window.  He only had a few hours to make sure everything was ready.
“Vindaloo, with lots of ginger,” he said, pulling Draco off the bed.
Draco moved the pillows, and sat up beside Harry.  “I was hoping this weekend would prove that I’m over the past.  No tying you up.  Calling you Harry.  All the rest.”
Draco seemed just as inexperienced, which made Harry feel a bit more comfortable.  But even Harry could see things weren’t going that smoothly.  Draco was a bit moody, cuddling with Harry at a game on a chilly day, and then seeming aloof when they went for a hot drink afterwards.  Seeming to want to be alone with Harry to make out, but pulling away like he had earlier.
Looking for signs of imminent attack, Harry thought, and sighed to himself.  He held his hands out, just wanting to give Draco no fodder for his suspicion.  Not wanting to reverse the trust he had been building.
That left only one choice. One horrible, awful choice.
“So, what are we going to do today after lunch?  Make mud pies?” Draco joked, picking up his sandwich and taking a large bite.
He heard the shower turning off.  Draco would be out in a minute, likely pushing Harry to get ready.  Sighing, Harry crawled out of the bed and got clean clothes out of his weekend case.
Even though he was pretty full, Harry couldn’t resist taking a generous helping. He sighed with the first bite. “This brings back memories of those days.”
The words reminded him of how he’d left Draco at the castle, and it sent a pang of guilt through him.  If he did this, as foolish as it was, he wouldn’t have to feel as guilty anymore.  Some payback for Draco.
“No.”
“Going to throw that at me, Potter?”  Draco sneered, standing straighter and pulling out his wand.
Instead, there was a dining room table covered with a dozen different foods.  Pancakes, strawberries, whip cream, sausages, bacon and eggs.
“Like an ex-Deatheater!  A traitor!”
Was there something there, or was it simply teenage hormones?  Being the only people around each other?
It was a blur after that, his heart pounding in fear as they were pushed and dragged into the cold, dark manor.  He could here Hermione gasp in pain, likely from the man twisting her arm, and Ron pulled away from his captor instinctively to try to help her.  But none of them could do anything but ineffectively squirm in their bonds.
It was strangely intimate, getting ready for their date in the same room.  Harry turned away as he pulled on some black trousers and an indigo dress shirt.  Should he wear a tie?
“I could ask you the same,” Harry said, wanting to pull out his wand.  He was probably better in a duel than Blaise and Goyle.  Surely there was a way to get out of this without hurting anyone.
But then Draco rolled them over, straddling Harry again.  His wand was out.  “Put your hands up by the headboard,” he ordered, his voice a bit rough.
What had he done?  Harry hadn’t thought about those years for a long time.  He hadn’t known anything different until he went to Hogwarts.  How much had he missed out on in his childhood?
Draco chuckled, pulling his hand away and rubbing it.  “You did that wandless?  Shit,” he said, giving Harry an impressed look.
Draco tugged him to a bench, and Harry didn’t resist sitting down.  Even walking this far had weakened him.  But it still felt good to breathe the clean, crisp air, and to feel the weak sunlight on his face.  He closed his eyes, tilting his face up to savour it.  He took slow deep breaths, feeling some of the tension inside him unwinding.
“I wasn’t acting, Draco.  At the castle,” Harry said, fumbling for the right words.  “We were spending all that time together, and you were being fairly kind to me...”
Draco gathered Harry in a tight hug.  “We are both new to relationships, and despite all that’s happened to us, still young in many ways.  You are too important to me to rush into something like marriage.  It’s a life long commitment to me, Harry.”
But Draco was taking his hand, leading him back in.  The servers had been busy, clearing away a few tables to make some space.  A singer had joined the pianist, crooning out some old tunes Harry vaguely remembered from his childhood.
“Shut up,” Draco said firmly.
“My manager is like that too.  He gives zero fucks that I’m Harry Potter.  Just sends me on tough assignments like any other new auror,” Harry said, taking another sip of wine.  It was going down very easily.
“Well, it’s probably best you enjoy it while it lasts then.  Get him out of your system.  I think you’ve been a bit hooked on him since Hogwarts.”
“Draco, please, please,” Harry begged, too aroused to hold back.
“What about dinner?” Harry gasped after a couple minutes.
They were first off when the boat docked, thanking the staff before rushing away.  The cab seemed to take forever, driving back to their inn.  Harry was tempted to apparate them back, right to their room, but held back.  But it wasn’t a good idea in muggle areas.
The voice jarred him out of his thoughts, to find Ron giving him a bemused look.  “Sorry, just feeling a bit confused about it all.”
Draco just stayed turned away, but his shoulders seemed to slump a little.  “Fine.  It’s all over and done with, OK?  Let’s leave it all in the past and try to forget it.  No more trying to help me, Potter.  Just leave me alone.”
“Watched Quidditch games with the family, played it ourselves with starter brooms, read books, nights out to see concerts or plays,” Draco supplied, not sounded too interested in the topic.  “What do muggle kids do?”
Drawing back the covers, Harry crawled into the bed.  Draco was fumbling around for something in his case.   “I don’t need scented candles or anything.  Just you, Draco.”
“Yes, they have lived here for a century, at least,” Draco drawled, with a condescending tone Harry recognized from their time together in school.  “But I didn’t visit much, as charming as it is.”  He was glancing around at the dirty, jumbled mess.
The other man was still wearing his untouchable, icy expression, his eyes dull when they met Harry’s.  “What is there to discuss?”
Harry prepped him too, covering him with lube and stroking him slowly, guiding him into place.  Holding each other’s gaze as Draco pushed inside, both groaning.  He took it slowly, only pushing deeper when Harry pulled at his hips.  Fully inside, Harry wrapped his legs around Draco, hugging him tight, taking deep breaths.
“What was your childhood like?”
“No, no,” Harry said, kissing along his shoulder.  “Call me Harry.”
Harry returned the smile a bit stiffly, and turned on his side, away from Draco, and blew out the candles.  “Um, Goodnight.”
Harry could only sigh and moan in pleasure, the stiffness in his back fading under his touch.  How much of that tension was from his work, from sleeping on a different bed, and how much from this situation with Draco?  Feeling so unsure how things stood between them.
Heart pounding in anticipation, Harry opened the door precisely at 7 pm to Draco’s knock.
Abruptly, Draco lurched out of his stillness, and spun on his heel without a word, and left.
Harry turned on his side to face Draco, and leaned in for a kiss.  “Well, that was incredible, Draco,” he said, feeling so much for this man.
Harry sat up, right beside Draco, and reached over to take his hand.  “That this is amazing, more than I dared to hope for, but, um, I’m actually not that experienced.  I’ve been concentrating on fighting a crazy dark wizard for the last few years.”
Chuckling, Draco shrugged a shoulder.  “We have to get clean somehow.”
Draco was thorough, kissing up the side of Harry’s cock as his lubed fingers gently pushed in and twisted.  Licking and sucking, as he found that really sensitive spot.  Tapped and stroked it, until Harry was arching off the bed, begging for more.
The whole house smelled wonderful, and Harry had taken a long bath.  He shaved carefully, wanting his skin as smooth as possible.   He hemmed and hawed looking over the clothes in his closet, chuckling at himself.  This was getting ridiculous.
Pulling at his wand, he apparated to the Ministry of Magic. Pretty soon, he was getting off the elevator for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.  He marched in, and glared down at first wizard he saw.  “Get me Auror Potter.  Now!”  The young man jumped, and then scrambled into the offices.
“You are giving me potions and saying you are sorry.  Maybe you could just let me out of here if you feel so bad,” Harry said, with dry humour.
Eventually he pulled back, breathing like he had run a mile.  Draco stared back at him, dazed, confused, lips a bit swollen.  And then he was gone, almost running out of the pond.
Draco grinned, pulling him to the far edge of the boat, leaning against the railing.  “A sunset cruise along the Thames.  With a four course meal and live entertainment.”
“You like what you like,” Draco replied with a warm look.  He picked up his own cup, taking a sip.  “What do you want to do now?”
“Exactly.  When you can’t do magic, you have to learn how to use what’s available to you.  Skipping rocks is something most kids try to get good at.  A totally useless skill,” Harry explained, ignoring the slightly snide tone from Draco as he searched for another rock.  He found a few, and sent them out along the water.  Most skipped at least once or twice.
Hearing his name like that sent Harry over the edge, hips pounding up into Draco, filling him up completely.
Harry stepped even closer.  Within kissing distance.  “Did you like it?”  He knew he liked Draco’s magic, the tingle over his skin.  A zing of power.
It got to be too much at times, and Draco dropped down on Harry, both panting hard, sinking into each other.  He could smell either Draco’s shampoo or a light cologne, some enticing mix that made Harry want to burrow in closer to inhale deeply.
“Well, that dungeon cell is surprisingly clean, but I think anyone would want to get out of it after a day or two,” Harry replied with a bit of a humourless chuckle.
Draco still looked uncomfortable.  “Well, she could see I wasn’t myself so she invited me out for drinks with some of her friends.  Muggle friends.”
“Hurry the fuck up, Potter,” said a voice behind the material.
-Grass Whistle:  Step by step method for this very essential skill
Draco groaned loudly, and Harry eased up, taking it all.  His inexperience showed, leaving him gasping for breath and quite messy
“If it’s not pity, it must be guilt.  For what you did,” Draco said, his gaze unwavering.
Draco gave a curt nod and linked his arm over Harry’s.  Within a few seconds, they were standing in a shabby living room.
He closed his eyes, focusing on his breathing.
“And then you said that stuff...”
When he woke up after his final shift, it was because an owl was tapping on his window.  He opened it, allowing the brown eagle owl to enter, and untied the message from its leg.
Anger and frustration bloomed inside Harry. Obviously Draco had been making his own plans, and predicted what Harry may try.
Harry felt bored and restless by the time Draco finally unlocked his cell door, and guided him upstairs with his hands bound. How many days had he been here? It was getting hard to remember....
But Draco moved away, kissing over Harry’s hip bone.  Leisurely licking, kissing and sucking at the skin there, before moving to a new area.  Teasing.  Making Harry pant and  arch up off the bed.
It took Harry a second, feeling Draco’s arms tight around his chest and his warm breath against his neck, panting hard. Their legs seemed tangled together, and it suddenly struck Harry how intimate the position was. They had crashed together during matches, but had never been like this.
Harry shivered at Draco cleaning them up, snuggling close, breathing him in.  “This is the best part,” he sighed, relaxed and practically boneless.
Bellatrix and the others continued to bicker on, but Harry could only watch Draco.  His worst enemy from school had him in the palm of his hand, and could crush him at any moment.
Eventually he gave up.  “Never mind.  I never had much of that stuff anyways.  I had no toys of my own.”
Strange how something he had done many times seemed so much different this time.  Harry stepped right up to the bars, and put his hands through them.  He rested his face against the cold metal, closing his eyes and holding his breath.  He could feel Draco watching him closely.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbled, and picked up the breakfast tray.  Had Draco done that before?  Scorgified Harry clean when he had been unconscious when they first arrived?  In the days after when he was sleeping heavily?  The thought was strangely disturbing.
A hand went into his hair, pulling him against the bars.  Draco kissed him, hard and urgent.  Obviously just as affected.
-A/N: Talking it out a bit, but not doing that great a job of it...
Ron was watching him from the other side of the table, sipping a beer.  His plate was empty.  “Is that Malfoy’s owl?”
Finally, one of Draco’s rocks skipped twice.  “Yes!” Harry exclaimed, feeling a bit proud of his student’s success.
wands!”
With nothing else to do, Harry ate the rest of the meal.  Spicy vegetable soup, roast chicken, potatoes, and even chocolate pudding for dessert.
Unfortunately, Draco was taller than Harry, with longer legs, and he was gaining on him.
“But...?  Obviously there is something wrong, something-“ Draco started, his anger fading, a pang of hurt coming through more.
“So you have never...?  Or just never with a guy?”
“I thought over your... request,” Draco said with a wry tone.  “I think it’s only fair to let you outside for a brief period each day.  We need to keep you healthy, after all.”
Draco shifted off him, lying on the bed beside him, and Harry turned his face that direction.  He felt wonderfully relaxed.  “Thanks for the massage,” he said, and leaned in to give him a light kiss.
“Once we determined you were just knocked out, we put you in the dungeon to rest.  He left me here to guard you.”
Harry washed his hands after completing the search, and with a shrug, stripped down and washed as well as he could.  There was no towel or facecloth, but he managed with the warm water, soap and his hands.  He cringed pulling his dirty clothes on over his damp skin, but it was the best he could do.
As soon as he let go, Harry’s slick hand was wrapped around his cock, unable to hold back anymore.  His hips snapped upwards, fucking his fist, his eyes clamped tight.  “Fuck, fuck, fuck...,” Harry moaned, the whole night just overwhelming.  He had to cum, cum hard, right now.
Harry unbuckled his uniform, slipping off the thick red robe and hanging it on a hook on the wall.  The snug black long sleeve t-shirt and slim fit trousers he had worn beneath were a bit dusty.  He ran a hand through his unruly hair.  “I’m going to make some coffee.  Want one?”
It happened so fast, Harry didn’t have time to think.  Draco was tugging his t-shirt upwards, so Harry lifted his arms.  A second later, Draco’s shirt was in the sink with Harry’s, and he was turning the tap on.
Harry chose to ignore the slightly derisive tone that he heard whenever Draco said the word ‘muggle’.  “Um,” he said, thinking back to what Dudley and the other kids in the neighbourhood and school had done.  He hadn’t had friends, had mostly stuck to himself.  “Ride bikes, visit the playground, play football, watch TV and movies, play with computers…”
It was a long night.  Harry was up for most of it, reliving every delicious second, usually with his hand under the covers.  The rest of the time, he wondered what this could mean.
He apparated to a forest Hermione had taken them to last fall.  It had trees close together, lots of places to hide.  He made a pile of leaves, put up some protective wards, and waited.  If there was anyone following him, they would do it within the first day.  He didn’t want to lead them to anyone on his side.
The snatchers’ grips were strong as they were pushed up to the iron gate.  Harry tried to keep his face neutral as a witch stepped into view on the other side.
“Oh really?” Draco brightened up at that.  “What was wrong?”
“Not that type of wine,” Harry said, mockingly.
“Says the guy who is into bondage,” Harry shot back, chuckling.  “It was mostly about when you tackled me, having your body against me, hearing your fast breathing...”
“Oh,” Harry said, his voice scratchy.  He sat up, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed, and ran his hands over his sleep-mussed hair.  Feeling a bit embarrassed that was Draco seeing him like this.  Usually he woke up early enough to wash a little, and run his wet hands over his face, straightening his hair as much as he could.  Draco froze, his eyes scanning over Harry, and he braced himself for a derisive comment.
The direct statement took Harry completely off guard.  He searched Draco’s eyes, and could see the determination there, plus maybe a bit of hurt.  It said a lot that he could read him better now than a few months ago.  How many dates had he gazed at his face over a table at a restaurant, or at a bar or a game?  How many times in a bed?
“More eggs?” The woman wearing a pastel floral dress held a cast iron skillet towards them with a warm smile.
Harry felt the urge to reach out and push that hair back. To feel it’s silky smooth texture, so different from his own. What would Draco do if he did that? Would his eyes warm even more? Heat up?
Those words were just incredible to hear.  Harry hugged Draco tight.  “Fuck.  How did we get here?  How did you come to mean so much to me?  How am I so lucky?”
Standing in the department’s lobby, he glared at anyone who came by, making most of them scuttle out of sight.
“Yes, like an apprenticeship,” Harry said, letting his cheek rest against Draco’s shoulder.  “I am sorry for what I did to escape, Draco.  But I can’t let things get more, um, physical between us until I know you forgive me.”
Harry wanted to scream in frustration.  “You knew it was me. You didn’t say anything.”
“Yes, and you have house elves doing all the housework with magic,” Harry said.  He had basically been the Dursley’s house elf, cooking and cleaning as his aunt had ordered, living in a tiny space instead of a proper bedroom, wearing cast off clothes.  “We didn’t have that.”
Pleasantly full,  Harry laid back against his cot.  It was a simple bed with a thin mattress, but at least it seemed clean and had a warm blanket.
Still Draco held Harry’s eyes.  Seeing who would look away first.  Could Harry look him in the eye, hold his gaze, after what he had done?  Draco seemed to be daring him to do so.
Sighing, Harry finished his drink.  “I think I’ll just go home.  Feeling a bit tired.”
“Well, it got pretty relaxed after a few drinks,” Draco said, chuckling now himself.  “They were complaining about their husbands and girlfriends, and I might have contributed a thing or two.”
So many normal things disrupted this year. Draco hadn’t returned for his seventh year at Hogwarts either, after his involvement in Dumbledor’s death. Harry had heard rumours that Voldemort had been staying at the manor quite a bit, but he obviously hadn’t been there when Harry had been brought there. How much had Draco been around him? Eaten meals with him and other Deatheaters? Harry shuddered at the thought.
The request was a bit shocking, but Harry obeyed.  It was so intimate, doing this in front of someone else.  Knowing Draco was watching as his hand wrapped around his own cock.  He couldn’t hold back, his hand moving over it.
Fuck.  Harry’s hopes of a rescue went even lower.
“Selfish because I cared about you, Harry.  More than I cared about my family’s honour,” Draco clarified.
Harry scoffed.  “Hardly.  This is far too small to put a dent in that melon.  But it’s perfect for this.”  With that, he flicked his arm out towards the pond, and the rock skipped along the surface three times before disappearing into the water.  “Hmmmm.  Not too bad considering I haven’t done that for years.”
“You’re welcome,” he said, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips and then meeting his.  There was a good amount of heat in them, and Harry felt an answering pang of arousal.  He was always horny in the mornings, and waking up beside Draco made it even more intense.
Nodding, Harry leaned in until their foreheads touched.  “Yup.  In fact, let’s make it our code.  Our euphemism.”
“Even better than what happened a couple minutes ago?” Draco chuckled, clearly not agreeing.
Shaking his head, Harry looked at Draco, loving how messy his hair was from their earlier activities.  “No.  But we are young, relatively good looking men.  We could be having sex with tons of people, and it would be good.”
Harry stepped out of the floo, feeling a bit too tired to apparate hone.  Why was he feeling so off?
It was hard to say who moved first, but they were on that bed a minute later.  Kissing, touching, completely tangled up.
At the top, there was a bright, open living space, with large windows showing the busy streets below.  Draco rose from the sofa, smiling, and enfolded Harry in a hug.
Harry was ready to agree to anything at that point.  He was nervous, but excited, scared of hurting Draco.  But he knew now from experience that it felt good if done right.
At the door, Draco hugged him tight.  “Night, Potter.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Forgive me for not packing a suitcase before you kidnapped me.”  He immediately has reverted to snapping a reply, like when they had exchanged insults at Hogwarts.
Draco moaned, his hands clenching in his hair.  “Oh fuck, fuck that’s good,” he said a bit breathlessly.
“It’s my mother’s. It’s powerful, but not the same,” Draco said. “Doesn’t quite understand me.  Know what I mean?”
But Harry didn’t complain as Draco slid the tray under his door, his hunger forgotten as his feelings about what happened earlier took over.
Opening the door, Draco sent Harry outside once his bonds were off, and closed the door.  When he came out with his own tray of food, Harry was already sitting below a tree.  It was flowering, pink petals occasionally drifting down to scatter in the grass below.
“Surely you have noticed them flying above you?” Harry asked, a bit bewildered.  He had already made five planes that successfully flew, although not very far.  All of Draco’s had crashed like they were under a jinx.
He stripped and washed, dunking his head under the tap, grateful the water was warm, at least.  He used his hands to sluice the water off his skin and hair, and slipped his clothes back on.
Draco kept splashing him, bending his legs to scoop up big waves of water with his hands and sending them Harry’s way.  Not all the water reached him, but water was everywhere and Harry slipped where he was standing, landing on his ass in the mud at the edge of the pond.
Draco seemed to being feeling it too, and when they went outside, he quickly got rid of Harry’s bonds and stepped back into the castle for a brief minute. He returned with a basket that he set down on a sunny patch of grass.
Draco scoffed.  “If you believed that, why would you be doing all these favours for me now?”
Draco’s hand never wavered.  “You have something of mine. I want it back.”
Just touching Draco sent a spark through him, especially after so many days apart.  Harry was tempted to shove Draco in the sofa and kiss him senseless, but he held back.  This was going to be so good.  At least he hoped it would be.
By the time it ended, Draco was looking a little dazed.  “Fuck, Potter.”
It made Draco jump in surprise, and he dropped his blade of grass. Harry chuckled, then pressed his lips to his hand again to make the noise again. Moving his hands, he could vary the pitch a little, and played around as he watched Draco try to copy his example.
“What’s wrong with the one you have?”
Lying on his back in the centre of the bed, Harry stared at the ceiling in disbelief.  All that kissing and touching, alone together in this big, comfortable bed, and that’s it?  He was still hard, almost aching from being aroused so long, and considered finishing himself off.  Just for the release.  But the idea of doing that was too depressing.  Within a minute or two, his erection faded.
He barely had a time to look around before Draco was taking him outside.  It was even brighter, a bit cold.  The sky was overcast with high pale clouds.  The grounds were well kept, with a rolling grass lawn and tall, trimmed hedges.  A few trees here and there, but no flowers.  A bit stark.
Harry couldn’t just sit here and wait to be taken to Voldemort.  He had to escape, somehow.  He had to find a way.  He had to do it himself.
“It’s never felt like that with anyone else.  You do a scorgify spell, and it sends sparks along my skin,” Harry said, trying to make a gesture.  His bound hands didn’t help in that.
“Well, if I’m too much of a bother, you could just let me go,” Harry said, letting out a chuckle in spite of himself.  Draco looked funny when he was angry.
He could recall thinking that those girls had been very pretty, and seeking out ways to be alone with them.  He really couldn’t remember having similar thoughts about Draco until the castle.  Seeing him lying on a blanket in the sun after they had eaten, looking relaxed.  He could remember noticing his skin, his eyes, his hair.  Feeling the urge to touch him.  It was mixed up with talking, and doing those silly things together, like skipping rocks.  Hearing Draco laughing with him, instead of at him.
It was wonderful, stepping close behind Draco, rubbing the sponge over his shoulders and watching the bubbles as they descended down his wet back.  His hair was already damp, a darker blond shade and slicked back off his face.  Harry moved the sponge down his spine, and gave it a squeeze, sudsy water running over his small round ass.
“Save it.  Gryffindors have nothing on Slytherins when it comes to lying,” Draco snapped, and looped his arm through Harry’s. He dragged him to one of the large fireplaces, and floo’d them to his place.
Eventually, Draco hugged him back, relaxing against Harry.  “I want that too.”
Harry took a small sip.  It was a bit like Pepper Up, but with a bitter undertone.  It wasn’t too bad.  Within a couple minutes, the pounding faded and he felt a little better.
Draco would be furious if he came back an hour or two later and just found Harry well rested.
Draco sighed, looking up towards the ceiling, considering it.  “The idea of designing healing potions is appealing.  She seems very experienced.”
Draco nodded slowly, trying to understand.  “Oh, to hang out with your friends.”
“This house has something in common with another one of your family’s homes,” Harry said, pulling out his wand and uttering
Harry shuddered at the screams and gasps of pain coming from upstairs.  Ron looked a bit crazed.  Despite this, they soon had the other people in the cellar apparated away with Dobby’s assistance.
It took a lot, but Harry shook his head, stepping away.  “Everything is getting mixed up together. I think we need to be able to be together without any of that stuff before we experiment more.”  He was still breathing fast, and tried to push down his baser urges.
In the end, Draco wasn’t very good at making paper airplanes because he didn’t understand them.  Harry could tell he was frustrated, which was the last thing he wanted.  “Um, how about we make paper boats instead?  We can even try floating them on the pond afterwards.”
“Harry, Harry,” Draco groaned, shaking against him, beautiful in his pleasure.
It really hit him when they reached their destination.  A charming cottage at the end of a tree-lined lane, with a hilly park beyond.  Draco rushed them into the Bed and Breakfast, being immediately greeted by Mrs. Owens like they were old friends.  She soon had they assigned to her best couples’ room, with a view of the park.
He must have been showing his thoughts pretty clearly, as Draco seemed to take pity on him, hugging him close and kissing him deeply.  Harry squeezed him tight, loving the feeling of being in each other’s arms.  What had happened earlier was more about sex and exploration, but this was about liking and being increasingly comfortable with each other.  Both were exciting steps for Harry.
Harry stopped breathing for a second, as Draco hugged him from behind, pressing in close.  This was really similar to the position they’d been in when Draco had tackled Harry, in that game of Tag.  His breath came out in a rush when Draco pushed his hips tight against his ass.  Harry could feel how hard Draco was, rubbing and grinding against him.
“We have to go back for them,” Harry shouted at Hermione and Ron, turning his broomstick around.  He had said ‘them’ but there was only one man he headed straight for.
“Did you have a question?” Draco said, his feet braced far apart, his arms crossed over his chest.
Harry grinned.  “OK, so what did you do?”
Draco was perched on the top of a huge pile of furniture, looking around in desperation and coughing from the smoke.  His skin was shiny with sweat from the heat of the fire climbing all around him.
Harry grabbed his wand back, and dropped it on his jeans.  “Are you done now?”  It was a bit disturbing seeing someone using his wand so easily.  In many ways, it was like an extension of himself.  A part of his magic.
“Thanks to you,” Draco said, pointing a long finger at Harry.  “You just had to save me, didn’t you?  Just like in the Room of Requirement!”
“I want it,” Harry replied, and proved his words by taking Draco back into his mouth, letting him slide along his tongue even deeper than he’d dared before.  He sucked harder, bobbing his head a little, his motions restricted by the bars.  And Draco’s hands, back into his hair, clenching whenever he hit a really good spot.
“I’m liking the idea of that house more and more...” Draco said, giving Harry’s skin a playful nip as his hands moved over his bare chest.
It was the most blatantly sexual thing they had done together so far, and Harry moaned, pushing back, matching his rhythm.  He could hear Draco’s fast breathing, and knowing it was because he was aroused turned him on even more.
“Shut up!” Draco shouted, and jumped to his feet, wand pointing steadily at Harry.  “Back to your cell, now!”
Draco locked him in and left without a word.  It wasn’t until he was fully upstairs that Harry realized he still had the binding around his wrists.  Had that been intentional?
Draco eventually woke up, looking sleepy.  Harry kissed him softly.  “Feeling OK?”
The kisses were light, exploring Draco’s lips and then going along his jaw, his neck. Nuzzling in and inhaling deep.  Tasting his skin.  Feeling Draco squirm at having his earlobe nibbled.
Shifting to be between Harry’s legs, Draco leaned in close.  Harry could feel his warm breath against the tip, and his mind provided a mental image.  Oh, he needed to see this as soon as possible.  Wanted to see Draco take him in.
Draco stopped, glaring at Harry at first, but then his expression eased.  He tilted his chin at a proud Malfoy angle.  “All the men I’ve dated do that,” he said dismissively.
Ron chuckled, picking at the paper label of his beer.  “Are you expecting him to propose or something?”
Closing his eyes, Harry felt the tingle of magic along his skin, from his hair down to his toes, his clothing rustling like it was in an invisible breeze.  His breath caught at the sensation.
“The day you kidnapped me,” Harry corrected, and leaned in for a light kiss.
Draco was watching him closely, his expression smug and far too pleased with himself.  It reminded Harry of Draco in their Hogwarts days.
“Yeah, I’m so good at that,” Draco said, with a bit of a grin.
The use of his last name was still jarring.  Even after all these dates, Draco still used it, surely knowing how it bothered Harry.  One of the many ways he toyed with him.
He stood, and wobbled enough he had to brace a hand against the wall.
A simple message with no signature, but it hardly needed one.  Malfoys always used eagle owls for their messages.  The large brown bird glared down at Harry with its orange eyes, clearly waiting for Harry’s response.
The words struck Harry, and he gazed at Draco’s profile, his thoughts whirling.  “Where are we?  Why am I here?  Can’t you leave?”
“Um, yeah,” he said.  “It’s about tying me up... why do you always want to...,” Harry fumbled.  “Is it because you don’t trust me?  Think I’ll go too far?”
This time, Draco was the one eventually passing the lube to Harry.  He seemed to enjoy the prep just as much, and got on all fours.  “Like this, OK?”
Instead, Draco stepped over Harry, a foot beside each of his hips, and lowered himself right down to straddle him.  Harry could feel his heart rate getting faster, as Draco leaned forward, looking right into Harry’s eyes.  “Hmmmm.... what should I do?” he said softly, and then he glanced down at Harry’s lips.
Wrapping his arm around him, Harry gave him an inquiring look.  “Can I do something for you?”
The head snatcher stepped forward, objecting to those comments.  Claiming his credit for capturing Harry.
Draco sighed.  “If we spend all our free time before then fixing the place up.”
Although this wasn’t really Harry’s kink, the fact that Draco had put the items out, had planned this all out, was incredibly hot.  He nodded, climbing on to the centre of the bed.
-A/N:  Things getting a bit more intimate.
“Yes?” Harry prompted, when Draco stalled a bit too long.
He pushed off, wobbling a fair bit until he got his balance, pedalling and trying not to run into anything.  Luckily, it was pretty empty of people where they were.  After a minute or two, he was slowly biking back and forth near Draco, letting him learn by watching.  From all the things they had tried at the castle, Harry had found that was how Draco learned best.
A bit surprised at the request, Harry obeyed, and felt the magical binding secure his wrists again.  So Draco was OK with Harry being unbound outside, but not when moving through the castle?  Why?  What was he trying to keep Harry from doing?  What was he afraid of?
“I hope you eat more of this than you did your supper,” Draco said softly, sliding the breakfast tray beneath the door.
Sighing, Harry picked up his tray and took a pull of potion first, needing the relief.  Then, he dig into the breakfast.
Through slitted eyes, Harry held his breath and tried to calm his breathing.  Draco stood before him, looking over his face slowly with impassive grey eyes.  His skin seemed even paler than usual.  He was in the black suit he had worn on the Hogwarts train last year.
It was satisfying seeing the way Draco flushed, his breathing already faster.  “Do you want more?”
Draco scoffed.  “Well, there are some amusements.  Watching you just now running around like a headless chicken, for example.”
It was hard to put into words what he’d struggling to figure out himself.  “Well, I think men are more comfortable having a casual relationship.  They don’t push for it to be more serious.”
It took Draco a second, and then his breathe caught.  He looked down at Harry, his gaze even more heated, and did a slow rotation of his hips, pushing firmly against Harry.
Harry nodded, not completely sure what he agreeing to.  He was 99% sure it involved Draco and sex of some type, so he was on board.
Draco opened a light blue eye lazily, peering at Harry. “Yeah, but what then? You can’t leave without a wand. Only I can get past the house wards to open the door.”
Draco stood and shook it.  “Thank you for the interview, Ms. Redd.  I hope to get an owl from you soon.”
Draco came out a few minutes later, changed into deep red pyjamas that looked good against his fair colouring.  He smiled at Harry as he got in his side of the bed.
Reaching out, Harry tipped Draco’s chin up so their eyes met.  “I did work at getting you to trust me, hoping it would relax your guard and I could find a way to escape.  But when we kissed, that wasn’t part of the plan.”
Seeing them, Harry swallowed hard, and his eyes flitted to the bed.  The only bed.  The one they apparently sharing for the next two nights.
There was no denying he had been attracted to Cho, and then to Ginny.  Had liked kissing them, being with them.  But Draco had always been on his radar.  How often did he glance his way during meals or in classes?  Fly against each other in games?  Spy on his movements in the hallways? Had part of that been an attraction that he hadn’t been self aware enough to understand?
“This is hardly our holiday getaway, Potter.  Instead of a beach, we only have a small pond.”
“Cold?” Draco said, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and pulling him against his side.
If he couldn’t physically attack Draco, could he convince him instead?  Work on his good side?  Did he have a good side?  Was that why he hadn’t identified Harry to his family?
Two days later, Draco was at the Ministry, sitting on the edge of the fountain in the main hall.  He stood up as Harry was walking towards the floos, his normal route after his shifts.
But with this strange version of Draco?  He terrified Harry.
Harry shook his head.  “It’s OK.  With everything that happened, it’s, um, understandable.”
That seemed to catch Draco’s attention, his head tilted slightly to the side as he looked back at Harry.  “I don’t know half of those words,’ he admitted.
Draco’s skin flushed even more with anger, and he glared at Harry.
OK, they were intensely attracted to each other.  All night, Harry could only think of kissing and touching him everywhere.  Making him pant, shudder and moan.  And the thought of Draco’s long, pale hand running over his skin...
“I’m not nice?”
How long had he been away, leaving Harry to dwell on his thoughts?  He felt stiff from not moving, so it must be at least an hour, maybe two.
Knowing Draco was watching made it all impossibly hotter.  Harry pulled his hand away, moving it towards his mouth.  But Draco grabbed it, pulling it to his own face.  Harry closed his eyes as he felt Draco’s tongue dragging over his palm.  Getting it good and wet.
“There’s lots of room for you to have your own potions lab,” Harry said back.  He had been half joking by suggesting Draco move into the house, but Draco agreeing to it sent an excited thrill through him.  Accompanied by dozens of images of how it could be.
“And why do you want to tie me up most of the time?  You say it’s just a kink, but I wonder sometimes if you still don’t really trust me,” Harry continued, running his hands through his hair.  “If the stuff from the castle or from before is still there, fucking things up.  A dark shadow hanging over us.”
Harry knew he just had to honest.  “I still want you.  So, so much.”
“Past tense?” Draco asked, trying to say it jokingly, but his eyes were watching Harry closely.  He cared about the answer.
Harry grinned at the idea of a wizarding daycare, full of toddlers playing with toys like that.  “And when you got older?  Like 8 or 9 years old?  Did you play sports or games with your friends?”
“Along with vegetables and herbs for the kitchen,” Harry added, able to picture them working outside together, shovelling soil.
“It had its moments,” Harry agreed, and laid down on the blanket. “Oh, I’m so full. Is this part of your evil plan, making me almost sick on good food that I’m too lethargic to move?”
“What is this?” Harry whispered to Draco, who was sipping his wine.
“You would have preferred I left you to the Fiendfyre?” Harry asked, raising one brow.
Harry was a bit tired from running around so much, his head feeling a bit sore, and he hoped the headache wasn’t going to come back.   Perhaps he had overdone it, mostly recovered from the concussion, but not at his full strength yet.
“What then?” Harry pushed.  It was awkward, asking, but he needed to know.
He looked amazing, dressed in a black cashmere V-neck and black jeans.  He held a bottle out with a smirk.
Shrugging a shoulder, Draco took a bite from his buttered roll.  “From Olivia, and  people I know from work.”
Sighing, Harry ate his breakfast.  Draco was at least being attentive, seeing that he needed his clothes cleaned.  He was never late with the meals either, and the food was tasty.  Harry was a prisoner.  It could have just been bread and water.
So that is what Draco was doing besides picking up the basket. About half his plans went up in smoke. “That makes it a lot more fair, actually. I can probably win if we fought.”
Draco must have heard the doubt in his tone.  He huffed, and tossed a throw pillow onto the rug.  “Fine.  Your head can go there.  I’ll even tuck a blanket over you.”
Draco scoffed.  “Maybe some minnows.  Tiny fish.  Nothing worth trying to catch.”
Draco just smirked at him.  “Come on.  You’ve said all along that I need to learn to trust you, right, Potter?”
With a quick wave and a mumbled spell, a rope wrapped snugly around his wrists, binding them.  Only then did Draco unlock the door with another spell.
Smirking a bit, Draco turned towards Harry.  “Most older wizarding houses have holding cells.  Part of our long, violent past.”
“But...,” Draco prompted him.
What would it be like to have a relationship with a father, and mother, like Draco had?  Loving, but following such an evil path?  Harry knew Draco was conflicted, wanting to please them but less engaged in helping Voldemort in recent years.  Lucius already had lost favour by the failure to get the prophesy at the Ministry of Magic.  Had he told anyone that they had Harry Potter?  Would he have lost face again to Voldemort and the Deatheaters?
They headed inside eventually, and Harry was feeling even more confident in his plan.  He had made some good progress today, getting Draco relaxed enough to talk fairly freely.  Draco was bored enough to let Harry entertain him, with talking or whatever else he could find to do in this remote location.  The more time they spent together, the more relaxed Draco would become.  It would only take a second to grab his wand and escape.  Harry doubted the grounds were warded to prevent people leaving, just from entering.
“Not that!” Draco snapped.  He waved his hands around, clearly still incensed.  “They don’t treat me nicely.”
“I forgive you,” Draco said, his eyes dropping to Harry’s mouth.
“What happened at the Manor?  It was such a blur,” Harry said, lifting a hand to rub over the tender spot on the back of his head.  He wouldn’t be surprised if he had a little memory loss from the concussion.
It was too much, and Harry cried out, shaking and shuddering through the hardest orgasm he’d ever experienced.  He dropped back on the pillows, sweaty, panting, chest heaving, hardly able to see straight.   “Merlin’s beard, Draco...”
There had been times after sex, they had actually cuddled, basking in a mutual afterglow, and Harry felt relaxed enough to fall asleep.  Almost.  He had deliberately resisted it, partially because he wasn’t sure if Draco wanted it to happen, not wanting to screw things up that way.  But also to extend his time with Draco, especially in that state.  Rumpled, relaxed, happy.  So fucking gorgeous Harry wondered what they were doing together.  Feeling lucky to be in such an intimate state with him.  Naked together, sharing it all.  It was the times he felt the closest to Draco.
Why did it bother Harry anyways?  He’d had an amazing orgasm, and Draco seemed to have enjoyed it too.   Next time, Harry would insist on focusing on Draco.  It would all even out over time, right?
Being blindfolded was a new sensation, and it made Harry feel a bit vulnerable.  So many things had, being with Draco like this.  Physically vulnerable, but also emotionally.  Needing to trust Draco so much.  But Draco had not abused this trust.  That thought helped Harry sink back into the soft pile of pillows, getting back into the moment.
“And grow ingredients in the garden,” Draco said.  Obviously ideas were zipping through him as well.
Harry sighed.  He strongly doubted it.  Draco had been a loyal son his whole life.  If he hadn’t split from his family and Voldemort over his task to kill Dumbledor last year, he wouldn’t do it for a few (incredible, amazing) kisses.  And Harry couldn’t stay here for weeks, waiting for those feelings to develop, never knowing if they would get there.
Were they still virgins?  What counted as sex?  Did it matter if it was gay or straight?  Did it have to involve... penetration?  What about lesbians then?
It just made Draco chuckle though.  “Hold still,” he said, doing the scorgify spell.
“I liked what happened afterwards, when we got back here,” Draco said softly.
Draco’s eyes flashed, and he sat up straighter.  “My turn now,” he said simply, grabbing a handful of blackberries and rubbing them down Harry’s chest.  His mouth followed, licking up the mess and eating the fruit.
He looked very young like that, fumbling for what to say.  Unsure, instead of his typical cocky demeanour.  They were still virgins after all.
There were a few other cells, similar to Harry’s, and windows covered with iron bars in the passageway.  The stairs were made of stone, and led to a thick, oak door with metal braces.  It took another spell to open it.
“Where are we?  Why did you bring me here?” Harry blurted out, the main questions on his mind all night.
Harry sipped his tea.  “It’s tasty, and not that much different, but...,” he said, shrugging a shoulder.
With a small smirk, Draco held his glass towards Harry, who clinked his against it.  “So, this helps you get ‘lucky’?  Do you really need much help in that area?”
Letting out a frustrated huff, Draco looked away.  “No, no.  But I think it was being stuck there so long, with nothing to do... maybe that idea stuck a little more than it would have otherwise.”
Harry gave him a small smile in return.  “Um, that was nice of you, but I think I’m OK.  I’d like to eat outside, if that’s alright.  Get some fresh air.”
He grimaced as he stood, zipping up his jeans with one hand, and went to the sink to wash his other hand clean.  Another reason to miss his wand.  It made clean up afterwards quickly and easier.
These questions kept circling and circling around his mind, until he fell into another deep sleep.
“What?  No way,” Harry immediately countered, leaning back on the sofa.
“What you did for me last time,” Draco said, his voice raspy near Harry’s ear, “I want to do that.  To you.”
Eventually, he almost defiantly picked a more casual outfit.  One of his oldest pairs of jeans, a medium blue t-shirt, and a loud Hawaiian print shirt unbuttoned over that.  Draco would probably hate it, and would probably say so right to Harry’s face.
It was only then that Harry noticed he was stepping onto a metal ramp of sorts, bridging between solid land and a large boat nearby.  Smiling staff greeted them, passing them a glass of white wine.
Draco entered the bathroom as Harry was combing his wet hair, wand in hand.  He pulled the plug on the sink, letting the water drain out.  With a flick of the wand and a mumbled spell, he passed Harry his t-shirt, clean and dry.
